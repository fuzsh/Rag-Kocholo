        "text": "Â\n\n(photo by Brad Joblin)\n\nÂ\n\nkk:Â To go back to a point you made earlier, I've always thought, as a listener, that the \"Jukebox\" CD you did with Randy Bachman must have been what it was like for you guys way back when, when you were just learning how to work together at your craft, sharing your different musical tastes with one another ... he'd show you something he liked and then you'd turn around and shoot one back at him ... a whole evolution process, if you will, as you learned to write songs together.Â The songs on the \"Jukebox\" CD would almost seem to me to be the kind of stuff you used to play to each other as you were learning your craft. Â\n\nBC:Â Â Yeah, the \"Jukebox\" CD ... that's a VERY good example ... the \"Jukebox\" CD was TREMENDOUS fun for us.Â He picked things he liked and I picked things that I liked and there was no pressure for song writing ... there was no pressure on creating.Â All we did wasÂ do our own version ...Â kind of put our stamp on those old songs.Â He did a GREAT job on The Beatles and \"I'm Happy Just To Dance With You\", almost a jazzy ... almost like a different song ... and I think that we did a really cool job of \"Judy In Disguise\" ... instead of the horn line that John Fred and the Playboy Band did, we did all those horn lines with guitars.Â And I loved singing the Sam Cooke song and I loved doing the Edwin Starr \"Double-O-Soul\" song.Â We had a lot of fun doing that, man ... that was REALLY fun doing that album.Â\n\nkk:Â My favorite song on there is the Cliff Richard song ... which I'd never heard before.Â That song wasn't a hit here in America so I discovered that song through YOU, not through the original Cliff Richard recording. Â\n\nBC:Â Oh, \"Don't Talk To Him\", yeah ... you know, I think fanwise ... I have a bunch of fans that follow me online, they're called \"The Faithful\", and I think that was voted the favorite song on \"Jukebox\" ... everybody LOVED the Cliff Richard song.\n\nÂ\n\nkk:Â And it was NEW to me which goes back to the point you were making earlier about still discovering new music today at this age ... I discovered that song ... even though technically it's 45 year old music ... I first discovered that track through YOU GUYS, not through Cliff Richard, 'cause that didn't get played here when that song was out and was a hit. Â\n\nBC:Â Yeah, that was a pretty well-played thing in Winnipeg.Â We were very fortunate in Winnipeg in that we got to hear some of the British stuff that Americans didn't get to hear ... some Georgie Fame and some Gerry and the Pacemakers that really didn't get off the ground in the States ... Billy J. Kramer was another one.Â The British Invasion was very, very extensive in Canada, I guess probably because we were part of the Commonwealth.Â and Canadian Capitol Records,Â they had just about everybody ... from The Beatles and Dave Clark on down ... Hollies, Animals, Ciff Richard and the Shadows ... EVERYTHING was on Capitol.Â It was a very cool time in Canada.Â We took that British Invasion square in the face. Â\n\nkk:Â That's actually what we're covering right now on The Forgotten Hits Website ... we're doing a whole series onÂ the hundred biggest hits of the British Invasion ... and the response is just phenomenal ... it's just amazing how many people relate to this part of their lives. Â\n\nBC:Â Oh, I imagine it would be ... and The Beatles would score VERY heavy in there ... Wow!Â What would be the #1 Song of the British Invasion?Â My God!Â Well, you know what, \"A Whiter Shade Of Pale\" would have to be right up there near the top.\n\nÂ\n\nkk: That's a GREAT song. Â\n\nBC:Â Although they didn't have a string of records, Procol Harum, but \"A Whiter Shade Of Pale\" was as big as any Beatles record.Â And I remember when that it, it was #1 forever.Â That was a big, big record.Â\n\nI think The Beatles would be right up there ... I think \"A Hard Day's Night\" would have to be one of them ... that record hit like a ton of bricks.Â \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"Can't Buy Me Love\" ... those two hard rockers, they hit like a ton of bricks in the '60's.Â Â\n\nkk:Â OK, well here, that's a good segue into this next question ... I was BLOWN AWAY by the fact that The Guess Who never really had a major hit record in England.Â How the heck can that be?!?!Â Seriously, what's the deal with that???Â Like most bands of the day, The Guess WhoÂ were heavily influenced by the sounds coming out of England at that time.Â Untold THOUSANDS of kids picked up a guitar or a bass or a drum kit ... (or, in your case, a piano!) ... searching for rock and roll success ... and you guys were no different.Â Â How is it even REMOTELY possible that The Guess Who had exactly ONE Top 40 Hit in Great Britain?Â And that one ... \"American Woman\" ... only peaked at #19.\n\nBC:Â No, not so much.Â \"American Woman\" did okay but RCA in England never really worked that hard on us.Â I actually did better with CBS with \"My Own Way To Rock\" many years later.Â But we didn't really happen that much in England.Â I don't know why.Â It's just one of those things.Â I mean there's a lot of Canadian acts that are HUGE in Canada that never had any success in the States.Â Sometimes I guess it just doesn't translate well across borders ... I don't know ... we were pretty lucky.Â We had a lot of success in Australia, too.Â But as I look back, I think we were pretty lucky, especially considering where we came from, which was this little dot on the map in the middle of snow!Â Â\n\nkk:Â Did you guys ever tourÂ England in the day? Â\n\nBC:Â We did a promotional tour in 1970 ... it was just very brief ... very, very brief ... we were only there about five or six days ... nah, never really worked on it much.Â We were too busy touring the States!Â We toured the States ENDLESSLY!Â Â Â\n\nkk:Â And I would go see The Guess Who faithfully when you guys would come to Chicago ... and, of course, a lot of the solo shows, too, when \"Stand Tall\" became a hit.Â\n\nBC:Â I remember The Arie Crown ... The Arie Crown was always a favorite place to play.Â And we played a lot in Texas.Â We played a lot in El Paso ... and then we would go across and drink tequila in Juarez ... I'll tell you one thing, man, you wouldn't be doin' that today!Â It's not the same as it was in 1970!Â Look at that, 43 years later ... it's not the same!Â We used to cross the border regularly and drink tequila till five in the morningÂ and sometimes I'd even shoot the worm ... but we wouldn't be doin' that now!Â I can tell you that!Â (lol)Â Times have changed! Â\n\nkk:Â (Laughing)Â Hey, you don't have to tell me ... I watch that TV show \"The Bridge\"!Â You go across the border today and you may not be coming back! Â\n\nkk:Â We can't do an interview like this and not bring up this question so please, grit your teeth and bare with me one more time.Â Â\n\nIt is no secret that it hasÂ been a realÂ point of contention for you that, as the driving force and focal point of The Guess Who, you do not have the legal rights toÂ useÂ the name ... that it is insteadÂ owned by the former drummer and bass player whose names 99.9% of the world, with all the money on the line,Â couldn't come up with on a \"phone a friend\" segment of \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\".Â Â\n\nIn 25 Swear Words Or Less, tell us a little more about this situation so that the fans out there can better understand why even when you and Randy Bachman have appeared together, you cannot use \"The Guess Who\" name.\n\nBC:Â Â At this point I honestly don't know who owns it overall â¦ maybe Kale and Peterson, maybe more â¦ I don't know for sure. To me personally, it's a shame that now sometimes there are five people on stage calling themselves \"The Guess Who\" and once or twice, not one of the five was on any of the records. I guess it's like \"The Platters\" or \"The Temptations\". You can go and see these acts but it's not the people who made the records. To me it always seemed like owning a McDonald's franchise or a Dairy Queen â¦ nothing to do with the magic of the records â¦ the true followers know who made the recordings â¦ and the recordings will live forever.Â Â\n\nBEGIN SOAPBOX MOMENT:Â Â\n\nHere's my take on this whole Guess Who thing ...\n\nWhat seems to botherÂ BurtonÂ the most is the fact that you've got this \"fake band\" running around, using the real records to draw people into the concerts.Â Simply put, it's misleading and deceptive to the fans.Â Of course the REAL fans know better 'cause they've been around it and have heard all the stories ... but the casual fan who sees or hears this ad and thinks, \"Hey, that's a show I might like to see ... The Guess Who had a lot of great hits\" is potentially going to buy a ticket to that concert and not get to see the people who recorded all those hits.Â Â\n\nBurton feelsÂ very fortunate that after he joined the band, he was the one toÂ have written and sung EVERY hit The Guess Who ever had ... and yet this OTHER band, who have the legal right to the use of the name are using HISÂ voice on those records in order to sell tickets to their shows with a completely different singer who's trying his bestÂ to SOUND likeÂ Cummings ... and that's taking advantage of the fan base as well as tarnishing the memory of those great records when they're sung by somebody else, misrepresenting themselves as \"The Guess Who\".Â Â\n\nBurton mentionedÂ SEVERAL times during our interview that he isÂ VERY proud of the fact thatÂ he can still sing those songs and sound like the records ... all in the original keys and with all the original arrangements ... fans are constantly coming up or writing in,Â tellingÂ him how goodÂ he still sounds ... and, at this stage of his career,Â that really means a lot.\n\nÂ\n\nWe've been over this pointÂ time and time again in Forgotten Hits ... and sadly it reallyÂ has become a case of \"Buyer Beware\".Â It's the Rock And Roll World we live in today.Â SO many acts have continued on, trying to earn a living playing the music that got them there in the first place ... and we would never deny them this ... after all, in most cases, some of THESE guys were on those hit records, too ... but there needs to be a certain \"honesty\" in representing what you're putting up there on the stage.Â Perhaps the best parallel example I can think of is Creedence Clearwater Revisited.Â Now don't get me wrong ... I was one of the biggest CCR fans on the planet when these guys were out making hit records ... and there is absolutely NO doubt that the rhythm section of Doug Clifford on Drums and Stu Cook on bass contributed GREATLY to the sound and success of those records ... but the guy who wrote and sang every hit they ever had is nowhere to be found.Â Instead, they're trying to mimic the sound of these records with a sound-alike singer, much the way Jim Kale and Garry Peterson are doing with their version of The Guess Who.Â There's a version of The Grass Roots out touring right now without a SINGLE member of the original band ... they're just using theÂ name.Â They're faithfully recreating all ofÂ the group's biggest hits ... but they're NOT The Grass Roots!Â At best, they should bill themselves as \"A Tribute To The Grass Roots\" and leave it at that.Â You still get the same music ... the same vibe ... but without the misleading moniker.Â Peter Noone, who was the voice of Herman's Hermits throughout the '60's, competes with a British version of Herman's Hermits led by their original drummer, who never sang a note and didn't play on half of their recordings in the studio!Â Paul Revere INSISTS that absolutely NO original recordings can be used when promoting his upcoming concerts because he doesn't want ANYBODY buying a ticket thinking that they're going to get to see Mark Lindsay up there singing the hits that night.Â In fact, he supplies the promoters and radio stations and advertisers with clips of five songs done by the current band, live in concert, to more accurately present what you're going to see and hear if you buy a ticket to their show.Â And the truth is that, thanks to Paul's insistence on this matter, they're contractually obligated to do so and abide by this method of \"truth in advertising\".Â And I'll tell you what, it's still one HELL of a show ... but he's not trying to FOOL anybody into seeing it.Â (Burton may be surprised to hear that although the previously-mentioned Carl Giammarese and Nick Fortuna are long-time members of The Buckinghams and were there for all of the hit records, they played bass and guitar on those records and never sang a single hit.Â The vocals on those hits belong to Dennis Tufano, no longer with the band and now working as a solo act.)\n\nÂ\n\nNow in all fairness, some of these artists have chosen to walk away from these musical institutions at some point in their careers, only to try and reclaim their rightful spot years later, by which time the remaining members who kept things going have already re-established themselves as the \"current\" make-up of the band and, in many cases, built a new and loyal following in the process.Â The recent \"Truth In Music\" laws require that at least ONE original member be part of the hit group selling tickets to the public and, by this definition, groups like The Buckinghams, Paul Revere and the Raiders, The Guess Who, Creedence Clearwater Revisited and Britain's version of Herman's Hermits qualify ... but as we have seen SO many times here over the years, it is always best to do your research FIRST before buying your tickets to some of these shows.Â If you just want to hear the hits played well, faithfully honoring and respecting the music you love, then every one of these bands will give you your money's worth.Â But if you want to see the guys who wrote and/or sang those hits, then you'll want to catch Burton Cummings, Mark Lindsay, Dennis Tufano, Peter Noone and John Fogerty ... 'cause there ain't ANYBODY out there who are going to do these songs any better!!!Â Â Â\n\nEND SOAPBOX MOMENT Â\n\nkk:Â Last year you released a live CDÂ of your performance at Massey Hall, which I'm told is the equivalent of performing at America's Carnegie Hall.Â\n\nCD available here:Â Â Click here: Amazon.com: burton cummings massey hall: Music\n\nkk:Â Clearly a number of honors have been bestowed upon you back home in Canada ... you're a member of Canada's Walk Of Fame not once, but TWICE ... as both a member of The Guess Who and as a solo artist.Â What do these accolades mean to you in the scheme of things? Â Â\n\nBC:Â After a certain point all these awards started coming my way. I'm particularly happy that my Mother lived long enough to see me inducted into the Order of Canada. That's the highest honour that Canada bestows upon a civilian. Â\n\nkk:Â In addition to all of these honors bestowed on you of late, there's even a THEATER named after you in Winnipeg now! Â\n\nBC:Â (Laughing) It's still a pleasure and honor to have the old Odeon Theatre named after me in my hometown of Winnipeg. It's a beautiful old building with the ghosts of decades and decades lurking in the wings.Â I used to go and see movies there for years. My Mother and Dad even went to the movies there before they were married. I love seeing my name on the building, and love hearing it referred to as \"the Burt\"!Â (laughing)\n\nÂ\n\nkk:Â (laughing) Which begs, of course, the most obvious question ...Â\n\nWith all these accolades being bestowed in your honor, there still seems to be one TREMENDOUS oversight in the music world that truly is nothing short of unjust and unthinkableÂ in light of the music you guys created.Â For the past two decades we have campaigned for The Guess Who to be inducted into The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame.Â It is a COMPLETE injustice that this hasn't happened yet.Â What would this mean to you at this point in your career ... or does it mean nothing at all after all this time?Â That is to say, would any recognition nowÂ beÂ diminished by the sheer stupidity of the oversight and snub for so many years?Â And, if you WERE inducted now, would you feel any differently?Â And finally, in light of the somewhat \"strained\" circumstances between some of the former members of the band,Â who would you bring up to accept the award and perform??? Â\n\nBC:Â The Hall of Fame hasn't seen fit to name the Guess Who before now, and at this point in time, the name doesn't mean what it once did. I honestly don't think I could stand up there and be inducted and then watch those \"other people\" go right back out on the road calling themselves \"The Guess Who\". What so many of us feel nowadays is that the name means very little, but the memories and the recordings are the real treasure. Remember what happened with Axl â¦ enough said.Â Â Â\n\nkk:Â Burton, we can't wait to see the show.Â There are still a few seats available to see The Burton Cummings band LIVE at The Arcada Theatre (with The Zombies!!!) on Friday, September 27th. (Hey, they're ALL good seats at The Arcada!!!)Â Go to www.oshows.com for more ticket information.Â Great to talk with you! Â\n\nBC:Â Hey, thank you, my man ... it was good talking to you ... and we'll see you at the show.\n\nÂ Â\n\nVERY special thanks to Burton Cummings, Sam Boyd and Lorne Saifer for helping us put together this AWESOME interview ... I sincerely appreciate it ... and I think we did ya proud!!!\n\nCheck out Burton's website here:\n\nÂ\n\n*****\n\nÂ\n\nTHE GUESS WHO /\n\nBURTON CUMMINGS HIT LIST\n\nHere is a recap of the chart history of The Guess Who ... as well as Burton Cummings as a solo artist.Â Â\n\nPeak positions shown for are for the US Charts, the Chicago Charts and the Canadian Chart.Â (Their British Chart peak position is shown for the only two Guess Who singles that charted there, a fact that STILL completely blows my mind!)\n\nBBCÂ (Before Burton Cummings)\n\nIn fact, this group is actually Chad Allan and the Expressions ... their record company put \"Guess Who\" on the label, thinking that curious disc jockeys and program directors might play it just to see what it was.Â The name stuck ... and they've been The Guess Who ever since.\n\nTheir first chart hit was a remake of the 1960, #1 British Pop Hit \"Shakin' All Over\" originally done by Johnny Kidd and the Pirates ... Great Britain ignored it ... as they did ALL of The Guess Who singles (with the exception of two!!!)Â Â Â\n\n1965 - Shakin' All OverÂ (US - #13 / Chicago - #10 / Canada - #4)\n\n1965 - Tossin' And Turnin'Â (only charted in Canada - #35)\n\n1965 - Hey Ho, What You Do To MeÂ (US - #125 / Chicago - #39 / Canada - #33)\n\n1966 - And She's MineÂ (only charted in Canada - #33)\n\nIn 1967, Burton Cummings joined the band and the group scored it's first British Hit.Â Incredibly, they would only chart in Great Britain one more time.Â (\"American Woman\" hit #19 in 1970)Â Perhaps even MORE incredible is the fact that this GREAT, little known gem didn't chart ANYWHERE else ... not even back home in Canada!Â\n\nÂ\n\nReminiscent of The Dave Clark Five's ballad \"Come Home\" (especially the intro), the group was heavily influenced by what was coming out of England at the time.Â Nearly fifty years later Burton Cummings would resurrect the old Cliff Richard hit \"Don't Talk To Him\" for his \"Jukebox\" reunion album with Randy Bachman ... another FINE example of early, pre-Beatles British pop music.\n\nTHE GUESS WHO:\n\n1967 - His GirlÂ (UK - #45 ... this record did not chart in the US, Canada or Chicago)\n\n1969 - These EyesÂ (US - #3 / Chicago - #2 / Canada - #1)\n\nThis is the record that broke thru for the band ... things were never the same after this!\n\n1969 - LaughingÂ (US - #5 / Chicago - #10 / Canada - #9)\n\n1969 - UndunÂ (US - #22 / Chicago - xx / Canada - #3)\n\n1970 - No TimeÂ (US - #3 / Chicago - #1 / Canada - #9)\n\n1970 - American WomanÂ (US - #1 / Chicago - #1 / Canada - #1 / Great Britain - #19 ... their ONLY other chart hit in the UK)\n\n1970 - No Sugar TonightÂ (US - #1 as a tag-along B-Side / Chicago - #1 as a tag-along B-Side / Canada - #1 as a tag-along B-Side)Â Also charted at #39 on its own in Cash Box Magazine here in The States\n\n1970 - Hand Me Down WorldÂ (US - #13 / Chicago - #7 / Canada - #3)\n\n1970 - Share The LandÂ (US - #5 / Chicago - #3 / Canada - #3)\n\n(They played the heck out of the B-Side of this record ... \"Bus Rider\" ... here in Chicago ... but it never officially charted)\n\n1971 - Hang On To Your LifeÂ (US - #22 / Chicago - #4 / Canada - xx)\n\n1971 - BrokenÂ (US - #51 / did not chart in Chicago or Canada)\n\n1971 - Albert FlasherÂ (US - #22 / Chicago - #31 / Canada - #5)\n\n1971 - Rain Dance (US - #11 / Chicago - #24 / Canada - #3)\n\n1972 - Sour SuiteÂ (US - #41 / Chicago - xx / Canada - #7)\n\n1972 - Heartbroken BopperÂ (US - #26 / did not chart in Chicago or Canada)\n\n1972 - Guns Guns GunsÂ (US - #66 / did not chart in Chicago or Canada)\n\n1972 - Runnin' Back To Saskatoon (Live)Â US - #74 / Chicago - xx / Canada - 5)\n\n1973 - Follow Your Daughter HomeÂ (US - #61 / Chicago - xx / Canada - #12)\n\n1973 - OrlyÂ (Only charted in Canada, peaking at #19)\n\n1973 - Glamour BoyÂ (US - #83 / Chicago - xx / Canada - #11)\n\n1974 - Star BabyÂ (US - #30 / Chicago - #3 / Canada - #14)\n\n1974 - Clap For The WolfmanÂ (US - #6 / Chicago - #11 / Canada - #3)\n\n1975 - Dancin' FoolÂ (US - #24 / Chicago - #14 / Canada - #13)\n\n1975 - Seems Like I Can't Live With You, But I Can't Live Without YouÂ (US - #88 / did not chart in Chicago or Canada)\n\n1975 - RoseanneÂ (US - #105 / did not chart in Chicago or Canada)\n\n1975 - When The Band Was Singin' 'Shakin' All Over'Â (US - #102 / did not chart in Chicago or Canada)\n\nBURTON CUMMINGSÂ (solo artist)\n\n1977 - Stand TallÂ (US - #5 / Chicago - #3 / Canada - #2)\n\n1977 - I'm ScaredÂ (US - #61 / Chicago - xx / Canada - #11)\n\n1977 - My Own Way To Rock (US - #74 / Chicago - xx / Canada - #16)\n\n1977 - Your Back YardÂ (only charted in Canada, peaking at #21)\n\n1978 - Break It To Me GentlyÂ (US - #81 / Chicago - xx / Canada - #4)\n\nNOTE:Â In 1979, \"Takes A Fool To Love A Fool\" charted on Billboard's Country Chart (#33) ... but nowhere else.Â Â\n\n1980 - Fine State Of AffairsÂ (only charted in Canada, peaking at #11)\n\n1981 - You Saved My SoulÂ (US - #32 / Chicago - xx / Canada - #13)\n\nThe response to our interview was phenomenal ... and the emails poured in ... far more than we could ever print here.\n\nWe have, however, selected some of our favorites ...\n\nÂ\n\nJust finished your Burton Cummings interview ... it's awesome! Great job!Â (Let's give away a couple of tickets!)\n\nRon Onesti, President / CEO\n\nOnesti Entertainment Corporation\n\nThe Historic Arcada Theatre\n\nwww.oshows.com\n\nAnd that we will!Â Thanks, Ron ...Â\n\nReaders ... get your emails in to me as soon as possible ...Â\n\nWe'll collect them all week long ... and then next Friday, the 20th ... exactly ONE WEEK BEFORE THE SHOW, we'll pick our winner ... a pair of free tickets to see Burton Cummings LIVE at The Arcada Theatre on Friday, September 27th, courtesy of Ron Onesti and Onesti Entertainment.Â You MUST be able to attend in order to enter.Â It's an EXCELLENT opportunity to see one of the greatest voices in rock and roll history ... a true living legend, live in concert ... so don't delay ... email me TODAY!!!Â (kk)Â\n\nforgottenhits@aol.com\n\nÂ Â Â\n\nBest. Interview. Ever. Seriously, kk, you blew the doors off with this one.Â I'd say it belongs in Rolling Stone so that the whole world can read and enjoy it -- but forgotten hits has become WAY cooler than Rolling Stone!Â Thank you so much for sharing this with us.Â Forgotten Hits just keeps getting better and better.\n\nJaniceÂ Â\n\nThank you, Janice ... and whereas normally a compliment like that would mean so much more, we all have to remember that the idiot running Rolling Stone ALSO heads up The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame ... and he has yet to find The Guess Who even worthy of a nomination, much less induction into his hallowed Hall. Here's the thing about Jann Wenner, a guy who has obliterated ANY sense of respect he ever had in the music industry ... his cocky, arrogant, know-it-all, \"I know rock and roll and you don't\" attitude has rendered his opinion and organization useless to virtually all of the rock and roll world.Â He has been SO off the mark with his decisions about who gets in and who doesn't that the status that SHOULD be associated with Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame induction means absolutely nothing anymore.Â Meanwhile, he continues to use and exploit artists that he would otherwise ignore as \"not worthy\" to help sell his magazine and drive folks to his website.Â Â\n\nCase in point:Â The Monkees.Â No how, no way are these guys EVER going to be taken seriously enough to be inducted into The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame ... they weren't even a \"real\" band ... they were a pre-fab, television concoction created to sell records and appeal to a teeny-bop audience ... and Jann Wenner would be the first to tell you so.Â Yet when Davy Jones died, Rolling Stone did a full-blown spread on his career.Â When the other three reunited to tour again, it was big, front-page news in Rolling Stone, down to \"exclusive interviews\" with Michael Nesmith ... ANYTHING to help sell magazines, all the while blatantly laughing and snubbing their noses behind their backs.Â Â\n\nÂ\n\nThe Guess Who remain the biggest rock and roll act to EVER come out of Canada.Â The fact that they've never even been CONSIDERED for Rock And Roll Hall of Fame induction is EXACTLY what renders that organization useless and meaningless in the mind of the world.Â Truth is, The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame has virtually ignored Canadian artists all together ... save Neil Young and (last year) Rush, you won't find ANYBODY else \"worthy\" enough of induction.Â Randy Bachman went so far as to publicly call them \"prejudiced against Canadians\" last year.Â There's enough evidence here to support that theory.Â Â\n\nÂ\n\nSo while I thank you again for your compliment ... I, too, think this is one of the best pieces we've ever done on the site ... the thought of seeing it run in Rolling Stone (who, by the way, doesn't accept outside manuscripts ... again, Wenner's a complete control freak!) just doesn't hold the same appeal that it might have thirty years ago when Rolling Stone Magazine was still considered \"relevant\".Â But thank you just the same ... and I appreciate the kudos! (kk)Â Â\n\nHi Kent!\n\nLove Burton Cummings!!\n\nI saw him in the early 80's. He opened for Alice Cooper. I thought that was such a strange combo at the time. Ask him what he thought of it? I thought his show was better than Alice's, as well :)\n\nI love readingÂ your stuff. Â\n\nDebeÂ Â\n\nAs you know by now, we've already talked to Burton about this strange pairing.Â (I had seen him not six months before that Alice Cooper show warming up for Melissa Manchester ... how's THAT for musical diversity?!?!?)Â kkÂ\n\nÂ\n\nCheck out this clip ... Burton talks about some of the acts The Guess Who opened for in the early years ...\n\nIn fact, you'll find an entire Burton Cummings Channel on YouTube, featured videos posted by Burton himself.Â (Some GREAT stuff here, most of which was filmed by Burton's videographer Lillian Sarafian, who has been capturing Cummings on tape for over thirteen years now.Â (Much of this will soon see the light of day in a brand new video series called \"Ruff\", which Burton mentioned in our interview.) kkÂ Â Â\n\nÂ\n\nWhen you talk to Burton Cummings (a big comic book collector) ask him about his comic book collection ... and the age old question D.C. ... or Marvel? Â\n\nSee you there on the 27th!!\n\nÂ\n\nMike DeMartino\n\nPresident of the Lovejoy Music Club\n\nHey Burton, which is it?!?!?Â (I was always a DC fan myself growing up ... some day I'll have to tell you about my life-scaring comic books moment ... even all these years later it's one of my life's most emotional memories!!!)Â\n\nWe've heard from a number of readers who pickedÂ up tickets to the Arcada show after reading our interview.Â There are still a fewÂ seats left ... but you'd better hurry.Â Complete information here:\n\nClick here: Arcada Theatre | Oshows\n\nHey Kent,\n\nGreat interview with the awesome voice, Burton Cummings!!!!!Â Now you have to interview Dave Clark of the Dave Clark 5 and, if you do, you could ask him why it took so long to release his stuff and is he hiding any more songs he hasn`t released yet???Â I hear he has more stuff but hasn't released them, but I could be wrong.Â Â\n\nJoe Wojdan\n\nKeep up the good work!!!!Â\n\nilovethedc5@aol.com\n\nGreat and enjoyable interview Kent. I immediately checked my inventory of Guess Who and Burton Cummings songs on my computer and found holes in my Guess Who material and went on Amazon and purchased the Guess Who Ultimate Collection, even though I had many of the songs. Now I only have to convert a somewhat bizarre song of theirs from vinyl called \"Your Nashville Sneakers\" that I always liked to complete my favorites of theirs.\n\nIt's a travesty that Jann Wenner has kept this great group that epitomized rock and roll out of \"HIS\" hall of fame.\n\nDanny Guilfoyle\n\n\"Your Nashville Sneakers\" is one of MY obscure favorites, too ... in fact, we featured it as part of the series!Â Thanks for the kind words, Danny ... much appreciated.Â (kk)Â Â Â\n\nHi Kent, Â\n\nI am loving reading the Burton Cummings interview. Â\n\nI got to see The Guess Who on their Share the Land tour, and saw one of their reunion shows as well.Â\n\nÂ\n\nMy home in North Dakota wasn't far from theirs so I think we always felt like they were a local band.Â\n\nÂ\n\nWe even heard songs like His Girl on our local radio stations.Â\n\nÂ\n\nHe always seems like he really likes to talk about music not just making it, but the songs that were big influences on him. I wish he was coming to the Twin Cities.Â\n\nÂ\n\nBillÂ\n\nÂ\n\n\"His Girl\" is a GREAT early effort. Incredibly THAT one charted in England ... #45 in 1967 ... but didn't chart HERE or in Canada!!!Â (Maybe it's because it has that real Dave Clark Five / \"Come Home\" feeling at the beginning???)Â Great song 'though ... and I'll bet most of our readers are unfamiliar with it ... so that's a good one to run today.Â I think \"His Girl\" would have been a GREAT \"break-through\" hit for The Guess Who here in The States had it been given the chance ... but in reality, it wouldn't have had the MASSIVE impact that \"These Eyes\" did ... so in the end, things probably worked out for the best just the way they did.Â Even so, I don't think \"His Girl\" should fall into the \"completely forgotten\" category ... it's a damn good record!Â (kk)\n\nHey Kent,\n\nÂ\n\nGood Burton Cummings interview! The Guess Who was one hell of a band! Under rated in a lot of respects. Bus Rider is one of my favs!!\n\nÂ\n\nMike\n\nÂ\n\nOne of mine, too ... and they played the hell out of it here in Chicago.Â I always felt this deserved to be a Two-Sided Hit as this was a KILLER B-Side ... but I have always maintained that it was the use of \"God-Damn Glad\" in the lyrics (circa 1970) that knocked it out of the box.Â (Apparently a lot of folks agree ... in our Top 200 All-Time Favorite, Forgotten B-Sides Survey a few years back \"Bus Rider\" came in at #51!)Â The A-Side was \"Share The Land\", a Top Ten Hit in its own right.Â (kk)\n\nÂ\n\nThe Burton Cummings interview is one of the best you've done, Kent. Thanks to Burton and all who assisted. Fun reading!\n\nÂ\n\nDavid LewisÂ Â\n\nI pushed hard for this one as this music has meant so much to me for so many years.Â I found Burton to be very supportive, forthcomingÂ and cooperative.Â AndÂ again I have to thank Road Manager Sam Boyd for setting this whole thing up for me ... as well as Burton's business manger Lorne Saifer, who worked behind the scenes to help this whole thing happen.Â I believe the end result is one of our best efforts ever ... with a MAJOR music superstar.Â (kk)Â Â Â\n\nKent, Â\n\nI just mentioned the cool Burton Cummings interview on StumbleUpon, Twitter, and Reddit. I applaud your fine work in tracking down the songwriters, producers, musicians, and artists responsible for so much of my favorite music.Â\n\nÂ\n\nAll the best,\n\nJeremy\n\nThank you, Jeremy!Â Readers, please help us to spread the word ... this was a GOOD one!!!Â (kk)Â Â\n\nKent, Â\n\nPlease enter me in the drawing for Burton Cummings concert tickets.Â\n\nI was very fortunate to see Burton AND Randy Bachmann with the Guess Who a few weeks after the 9/11 events in New York, Washington DC and Pennsylvania. Iâm not sure of the circumstances of the re-uniting of the group but it was a short-lived reunion. They appeared at the Milwaukee Auditorium, with Joe Cocker opening. After an opening of Shakinâ All Over (with Burton doing a fabulous job on vocals and keyboards - sounding exactly like the original recording) Burton gave a short but stirring salute to the spirit of the American people, ending with a promise to the terrorists, âYou have no idea what you are going to receive in return for thisâ (sic). Iâve always felt fortunate to have seen this performance and would love to see Burton perform on the 27th.\n\nIâve also seen the Zombies twice in the past three years and they do a great job. Colin Blunstone has kept his outstanding voice and Rod Argent is not only a gifted organist but possibly the coolest senior citizen on the planet.Â\n\nKeep up the great work and please pick my name for the tickets.\n\nBob Verbos,Â\n\nNew Berlin WI.Â\n\nP.S.Â My wife and I saw .38 Special last week at the Utah State Fair.Â This is the third time Iâve seen them, and they always put on a great show.Â They also have a Chicago connection, since Jim Peterik co-wrote several of their hits, including their biggest, âHold On Loosely.âÂ Â\n\nlol ... oh, if it was ONLY that easy!!! (lol)\n\nWe saw .38 Special a few years ago ... and Peterik showed up to play with the band during their encore ... great show.\n\nWe also saw that Guess Who reunion show, too ... right after 9/11 ... at The Rosemont Theater.Â GREAT show with Joe Cocker as the opening act.Â We had second row balcony seats as it was a complete sell-out.Â I remember that we were supposed to meet some friends who had main floor seats downstairs but with the heightened security, the ushers wouldn't let us in to say hello, even during the break between acts.Â I was totally bummed as ONE of those friends was going to introduce us to Burton after the show.Â Sadly that never happened and we still haven't had the pleasure.Â (Hopefully that'll change at the show at the Arcada.)\n\nAnyway, consider yourself entered ... but as I type this you're one of 37 people (and there's only ONE pair of tickets to be given away).Â But you can certainly BUY tickets for this show ... so please be sure to visit the OShows Website after Friday if it turns out you're not the lucky winner!Â (kk)\n\nKent,Â\n\nA couple of things on the Burton Cummings interview.Â I wish you'd have asked about the great B sides the Guess Who had.Â SOOOOO many of the B sides got lots of airplay, even if not charted.Â \"Bus Rider\", \"Do You Miss Me Darling\" and the ones that eventually became A sides on their own as well!Â Also, the story behind one of the band's Canadian hits that came JUST before the breakthrough with \"These Eyes\" called \"When Friends Fall Out.\"Â That song seems to have been what happened to the group in the end, not in the (hit) beginnings!Â GREAT song with \"Moonlight Bay\" influences.Â Glad he mentioned \"My Own Way to Rock\" because I loved that one.Â Another one I would love to have known more about was the sawn song \"When the Band Was Playing Shakin All Over.\"Â Got airplay around here (along with \"Rosanne\") and was a cool epitaph of sorts.Â Their performance on Midnight Special in 76 (?) was great when they sand \"Dirty\" (lyrics switched around from LP version) and \"Diggin Yourself,\" which I loved getting on tape back then off TV.Â Made me believe there was no reason to think the Guess Who were about done. Â\n\nAs for the Guess Who going around now without lead vocalist, it was a bit like that when Burton took over from Chad Allen and had to sing \"Shakin All Over\" without Chad, no??Â Â\n\nClark BeschÂ Â\n\nThe memory of The Guess Who HOSTING The Midnight Special (right around the time of their \"Artificial Paradise\" album ... 1973 maybe?) is exceptionally vivid for me ... after hearing \"Bye Bye Babe\" (another song that absolutely should have been an A-Side ... and a HUGE hit), \"Orly\" and \"Those Show Biz Shoes\", I ran out and bought the album the very next day.Â I did ask a few more questions about the transition from Chad Allan, lead singer, to Burton Cummings, lead singer, but unfortunately these fell into the \"unaswered\" category\" by press time.Â And I would have liked to have spent more time on some of the solo material as I have a whole list of favorites from this era as well ... but we simply ran out of time.Â (I was able to feature a few of my favorite solo tracks during the interview, however.)Â kkÂ Â Â Â\n\nHello kk! Â\n\nWhen the 45 version of \"American Woman\" was released in early 1970, there was a rumor that the last phrase sung was \"Goodbye American shit!\" In the Charlotte, North Carolina, area the radio stations always spoke over the ending so it became a conspiracy thing and all the kids were buying the 45 and some would swear he said it. It did not hurt the phenomena either that some 45 record versionsÂ excluded that last line! Did you experience that phenomena in Chicago?Â Â\n\nHere is the last line (turn it up):Â Â\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8uANfdxRt0Â Â\n\nHere's an excluded UK version ...Â Â\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4wTnYt8s-c\n\nI read once where Burton Cummings stated he was saying \"chick\" and it cleared it up for me. So that had to have been an issue! It certainly spawned a lot of sells of the 45 record in the Piedmont area of North Carolina!Â\n\nAlso ... I don't think that The Guess Who gets proper credit in the category of FUZZ! Â\n\nThe Guess Who's tune \"No Time\" from \"Canned Wheat\" set my fields on fire with that gift and made me really happy more of that style of guitar driven fuzz (twin guitar fuzz)Â that Davie Allan made famous was coming and coupled with Burton Cummings vocals made that song timeless (no pun intended)! A lot of fuzz songs were just harsh fuzz being true psychedelic ditties but there are some melodic well done tunes thatÂ had that specialÂ formula!Â \"No Time\" in both versions are standing proof as were several LPs from The Guess Who. These ears stand tall with that tune as well as others they played!\n\nLoved reading that interview!Â\n\nVibeman\n\nI always heard it as \"chick\" ... so I guess I never really questioned it.Â I don't remember there being any controversy on this at the time.\n\nHowever, I DO remember something about The Guess Who being invited to perform at The White House ... and that some of the nation was shocked by this decision as \"American Woman\" was not considered very complimentary to the US (and women in particular) at the time.Â I probably should have asked him about this (but had forgotten all about it until I read your email.)Â Burton, if you happen to be reading this, what say you?Â (kk)Â\n\nHi Kent,Â\n\nGreat job on the BC interview.Â\n\nIt was some of your best work.Â\n\nThank youÂ\n\nSteve Sarley\n\nPlease enter my name in the free concert ticket give-away.Â The Guess Who are one of my all-time favorites and I would love to see this show.\n\nDoug\n\nLike I said, we're only able to pick one winner ... but you can always visit the Arcada Theatre website and secure your tickets now before they're all gone.Â I have a feeling this is going to be a VERY hot ticket ... especially based on the response we've received for our interview.Â (In fact, I believe we had something like 1800 brand new readers ... all from Canada!!! ... who discovered Forgotten Hits as a result of this great word of mouth!Â Awesome!Â (kk)Â\n\nÂ Â Â\n\nKent, Â\n\nJust read the first installment of your Burton Cummings interview -- EXCELLENT -- so looking forward to the next two installments.Â I find Forgotten Hits more in touch and more relevant than any other music publication -- THANK-YOU for all of your expertise and hard work -- it is greatly appreciated.Â Â\n\nÂ\n\nFor a real kick Google:Â Blackbird Guess Who Pandora -- and listen to Burton Cummings' spot-on version of the Beatles song (after you click on hit PLAY SAMPLE).Â It's on the Guess Who's album:Â \"Let's Go - The CBC Years\" -- I think you will find it very impressive!\n\nBest Regards,\n\nTim Kiley\n\nThanks for the kind words Tim.Â I was listening to the \"Let's Go\" CD last week as a matter of fact.Â In fact, that's where their version of \"Time Of The Season\" came from that I posted in Part One of our interview.Â Interesting to hear the band as the were right on the cusp of hitting the big-time themselves.Â Â Still playingÂ songs by other artists on the TV show while their own first hit single \"These Eyes\" was beginning to climb the charts.Â (kk)Â\n\nAnd then ...\n\nHi Kent,\n\nJust finished \"Burton Cummings Part 2\" -- really EXCELLENT interview -- Glamour Boy, one of your all-time GREAT Burton Cummings' songs.Â Really loved that you brought up the fact that his music covers so many genres.Â Another tune of his in the jazzy category is \"Sing Shiny Stockings\" off the Dream Of A Child CD and another stellar tune of his is \"Heavenly Blue\" off the Woman Love CD, but I am sure you have heard them all.Â Loved the song you featured of his in the Country genre ...Â I had not heard that one before.Â I am sure you are getting a ton of feedback on your interview with Burton -- GREAT stuff -- looking forward to the final installment tomorrow.Â That's a helluva double-bill, The Zombies and Burton Cummings -- now there's an artist line-up that would have no trouble playing until breakfast -- love that song by the Zombies, \"You Make Me Feel Good!\"Â Have a GREAT weekend!\n\nThanks Again,\n\nTim KileyÂ Â Â\n\nMore!!!\n\nHi Kent,\n\nAgain, GREAT interview with Burton Cummings ... I really enjoyed it.Â Also thanks for featuring \"Albert Flasher\" in Forgotten Hits today, certainly one of the Guess Who's most durable hits -- it has almost a little history like Bob Seger's \"Old Time Rock & Roll\", a song that only charted at #28 in Billboard but when \"Old Time Rock & Roll\" was featured in the movie \"Risky Business\" it went on to become a classic (much the same with the Righteous Brother's \"Unchained Melody\" in the movie \"Ghost\").Â \"Albert Flasher\" only charted at number #29 in the U.S. but was featured in the movie \"Almost Famous\" and when you hear Burton sing it, watch the crowd and you'll see why this song has had the longevity it has -- when you hear Albert Flasher you know that Burton has tapped into a vein of gold in timeless magic rock n' roll much the same as a Fats Domino, Little Richard, or a Jerry Lee Lewis song.Â Listen to the song \"Lucille\" by Little Richard, absolutely timeless -- it's the same with Albert Flasher, just like a good Canadian whiskey, it just gets better with age.\n\nWhen Burton Cummings joined the Guess Who in January of 1966, shortly thereafter the first song he recorded in the studio that he did lead vocals on with the Guess Who was a song that Neil Young wrote (as you know, Neil spent his junior high and high school years in Winnipeg) called \"Flying On The Ground Is Wrong\" that spent time on the Canadian charts -- give a listen to it, and you'll see it sounds even better than the version recorded by Neil Young's Buffalo Springfield with Richie Furay on lead vocals.Â It'll give you an idea of how the Guess Who sounded right before the collaboration of Burton Cummings and Randy Bachman took their music in the direction that they became even more famous for.Â You take the talent of Burton Cummings, and you stir in the Winnipeg music scene, and add a bit of British Invasion with a sprinkle of youth and dreams and you come up with a whole lot of great music, happy record companies, and loyal fans -- fame was only a by-product.Â I think Burton would be the first to tell you that his career wasn't about the gravy, it was about the potatoes, music always was his mistress -- though the Guess Who brought him fame and creature comforts, I think to this day the band that remains a soft spot in his heart is the Deverons -- whereas the Guess Who meant the business of music, the Deverons meant the fun of music -- and when you see him perform, you'll see he still is having fun -- and when you go to the show you will, too.Â I think to him music always had the feel of \"Mom, look what I colored in school today!\"Â He has never forgotten the person that made it all possible for him.Â You are in for one helluva show.\n\nPeace,\n\nTim KileyÂ Â Â Â Â Â\n\nNo doubt about it, Burton has a soft spot for The Deverons ... that's really when it all started for him.Â But if The Deverons were the vehicle that got him into show business, then The Guess Who became the express train that took him to the top.Â We've heard from a few readers over the years who remember seeing Cummings with The Deverons and being able to tell very early on that this guy had something special ... and was going to make it big.Â He probably would have ended up being a star either way.\n\n\"Albert Flasher\" has always been one of my favorites ... it almost feels like Burton wrote this one as a piano warm-up exercise!Â He is ALL over the keyboard ... and I've always felt that this should have been a MUCH bigger hit.Â (I think part of the problem was the flip-side, \"Broken\", split the vote and, as such, NEITHER track became as big as they deserved to be.\n\nHaving seen The Guess Who, Burton Cummings and/or Randy Bachman close to fifteen times now, you don't have to tell me how entertaining this show is going to be ... I can't WAIT to see him again!Â (kk)Â Â Â Â\n\nKent,\n\nThis is a wonderful interview.Â Congratulations!\n\nBest,\n\nBob Rush\n\nYour Burton Cummings Interview was a home run -- no wait, I take that back -- a GRAND SLAM!Â\n\nI have read many articles and interviews on Cummings and the Guess Who in the past but nothing ever as in-depth as your piece.Â You guys covered it all.Â Kudos on a job well done.\n\nJohnÂ\n\nGreat job on the Burton Cummings interview, Kent.Â Â I never had the opportunity to talk with him during my radio heyday, so I was pleased to see that he's a great guy andÂ still has the enthusiasm of a youngster with regard to music -- his and others' as well.\n\nAnd you're right -- Cummings and Bachman's version of \"Don't Talk to Him\" is terrific.Â\n\nOh, the broadcasting and format myths we could bust if someone would just give us a little radio station at the end of the dial ...\n\nScott PatonÂ Â Â Â Â Â\n\nWhat an excellent job, and what a thrill it was to learn about Burton and learn about him beyond the records.Â I loved the Cliff Richards cover, and that take on You Ainât Seen Nothing Yet was wild!Â Jealous of you getting to go see him on stage.Â Â\n\nCW Martin\n\nI can't wait ... but it IS a real kick to be able to take another Chicago-area Forgotten Hits Reader to the show, thanks to Arcada Theatre head-honcho Ron Onesti!Â Meanwhile, there are still a few good seats available:\n\nwww.oshows.com.Â (kk)Â Â\n\nTwo other great Guess Who tracks I wondered if you knew (I'm sure you do) that werenât hits but shoulda been are A Wednesday In Your Garden and Flying On The Ground (Written, Iâm told, by Neil Young).\n\nCW\n\nYou'll find BOTH of these tracks mentioned elsewhere in today's comments page ... obviously fan favorites!Â (kk)Â Â\n\nReally, really enjoyed the Burton Cummings interview.\n\nLoved all their classic-hit songs ... was great to re-think about those songs again, especially \"Share The Land\" (which I had forgotten about!)Â ... great, great track.\n\nBravo!Â\n\nDavid Salidor\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nIt sounds like some of our Forgotten Hits Readers having been telling Burton about our publication ...Â Â\n\nVery cool ... so he finally figured out that your operation's pretty rockin' (you've really picked up steam since you first got going) ...Â Definitely will letÂ the Guess Who fans in our group know about it.Â\n\nI've yet to read today's second piece, but the first was brilliant, dude - and I have posted the link in a couple places and gotten FB likes and comments about what a great interview this is. Â I'm sure Burton was impressed at how well-informed you are.\n\nDanÂ Â Â Â\n\nI have him as a friend on Facebook and have dropped him a couple of notes about the site as he had appeared on there a few times recently and that he should check it out as it would be a good read if nothing else, but that you do a great job interviewing people and it has a large following. Next thing I know ... you have this coming up! LOLÂ Â Dunno if the extra push did any good, but I am glad you finally got the interview from him. He personally writes a lot on his FB page about stuff in the past, so this one should be good!\n\ndocÂ\n\nOver the past severalÂ years at leastÂ four or five people on the list have mentioned that they thought they couldÂ hook us up for an interview ...Â but itÂ never happened.Â Honestly, it looked like this one might fall through a couple of times, too,Â but with the show coming up in a couple of weeks, I really pushed to keep this on track.Â Fortunately, Burton's road manager, Sam Boyd, is a long-time Forgotten Hits Reader and really enjoys what we do here ... so he helped to set the whole thing up.Â Burton called me at an appointed time and we talked for about 45 minutes.Â Meanwhile, I had emailed him DOZENS of questions both before and after our phone conversation ...Â and then he began emailing me back responses to cover some of the topics we missed during the first go 'round.Â (Even at that, there were still several more questions thatÂ ultimately got dropped from the website interview simply because we never got around to them.)Â Incredibly we were still talking late Tuesday Night / Wednesday Morning ... so I had a rather frantic Thursday trying to get enough edited in time to still hit my self-imposed deadline of Part One going up on the site on Friday ... certainly the most pressure I've ever put on myself to do so (I've probably got 15 hours in Part One alone!) ... but it was important to me to have this run two weeks before the show so that fans would still have the time to get a ticket.\n\nI've heard from several people that he can be difficult at times ... but I saw absolutely no evidence of that.Â In fact, most of the interview felt like two old friends, talking about their shared love of music ... as Burton Cummings is, himself, a FAN ... and, as he told us, quite the collector.Â Many of those same people (along with quite a few others)Â wrote in to say that they were amazed at how much I got out of him ... but we haven't even scratched the surface yet ... as this was after Part One ran on the site.Â I've still got two more days to go and the best, as they say, is yet to come.Â\n\nI found him to be COMPLETELY behind me on this (and I've heard he's been quite complimentary of the results so far) ... very cooperative, very forthcoming and very appreciative of my wanting to get the facts down and help push the concert ... so time will tell if we do more ... who knows, maybe he'll become a regular Forgotten Hits reader and contributor, too.Â But I've gotta tell you ... as a life-long fan, this was an INCREDIBLY cool thing for me to do!!!Â (kk)\n\nÂ\n\nkk -\n\nYou raised the bar when it comes to rock interviews with your piece on Burton Cummings.Â (Thanks aÂ lot, ya bastard!)Â I guess I can cross him off my bucket list ... you covered it all ... there's nothing left to ask him!\n\nAll kidding aside, you did a GREAT job with this and with, from what I understand, a sometimes difficult interview subject.Â You two seemed to definitelyÂ have hit it offÂ and itÂ shows in the final outcome.\n\nSincere compliments on a job well done ... Forgotten Hits just continues to grow and I, for one, am very happy to be part of the forgotten hits family.\n\nChuck\n\nThis one meant a lot to me ... no question.Â Burton mentioned an online group of fans of his called \"the faithful\" and I would be remiss not to do the same.Â Â Just about aÂ year ago, I was sitting here computer-less with no financial means to solve this problem.Â For all intents and purposes, I was struggling with theÂ very real possibility that, after nearly fourteen years,Â this might be the end of Forgotten Hits.Â But a group of devoted readers got together and raised donations to get us back in the game.Â Were it not for them, this interview might never have happened ... so once I again I thank MY \"faithful\".Â Tell you what ... scroll back and look at the work we've done here in the past year ... the idea that NONE of this would have happened is literally unthinkable to me.Â SO many new opportunities have presented themselves in the past year and, thankfully, I was around to take advantage of the majority of them.Â So thank you again, the Forgotten Hits Faithful, who have stuck with us for all these years ... and are encouraging me to keep it going for at least another sixty!!! (I'm not sure THAT'LL happen ... lol ... but hey, right now I'm feelin' pretty good about what we've accomplished here!)Â kkÂ\n\nIf you are a fan, join our group on Facebook. Â Burton drops by from time to time.\n\nWe will be playing the September 7th concert on www.fenx.us on Sunday if you would like to listen.\n\nIn fact, I will be running a series of Burton Concerts from this year and last.Â Â Â\n\nThe Guess Who at the Cresentwood Centre 1966 with Chad Allan and Burton CummingsÂ\n\nThe Guess Who reunion at the Cresentwood Center in Winnipeg in 2000 with the 4 originals including Jim Kale Burton Cummings in Cornwall 2012Â\n\nBurton Cummings at the Red Robinson VancouverÂ 2012 Burton Cummings Live at the Imperial Room Toronto 1982 Burton Cummings Solo Live at the Red RobinsonÂ Â\n\nTuesdays, Burton's long time Album designer has a show.Â Ernie Celafu from Pacific Eye and Ear, which runs at 8 pm Eastern.Â\n\nAnd thank you for running (and crediting!) my photo of Burton and the band on your website ...Â you'll see one of photos included in inner sleeve of the \"Massey Hall\" CD, too.\n\nKevin Suter\n\nAwesome interview ... BurtonÂ emailed me that he had a great talk with you.\n\nThanks for doing it and if you need anything else let me know.\n\nCheers.\n\nSam Boyd\n\nTour Manager\n\nKent ...\n\nEnjoyed your Burton Cummings interview.Â Â\n\nAccording to Ron Smith's Book \"Eight Days A Week,\" 9/17/1975 - \" Guess Who Day \" is declared in Winnipeg.\n\nFrank B.\n\nWell, that would be TODAY!!!Â So Happy Guess Who Day everybody!Â (kk)Â\n\nÂ\n\nJust got through reading the interview on your web site about Burton Cummings. Awesome job!! I have been a life long fan and was fortunate enough to have seen the Guess Who a couple of times back in the day. I just moved back to the Chicago area and would love to be able to go to the show at the Arcada Theatre (which is only 20 minutes from my home) to see Burton once again - especially along with the Zombies!! Are you freakin' kidding me!!!! Just saw Tower of Power there a while back - what an awesome theatre.Â My son (16) plays piano and loves it when I put on my Burton Cummings solo piano CD. Even he, at 16, is influenced by the classic rock masters!!Â\n\nBest Wishes,Â\n\nRandy DiehlÂ\n\nBartlett, IL. Â\n\nThe Arcada Theatre is a GREAT place to see a show ... and this is gonna be a good one!!!Â Hope to see you out there!Â (kk) Â\n\nÂ\n\nKent,Â\n\nLike you, I've seen the Guess Who multiple times, once without Burton and once without Bachman and with Bachman billed as the Guess Who and just as Burton Cummings and Randy Bachman. I, too, was at that Rosemont show. Dunno how I missed you that nite. Sadly, there's no way I can make that show on the 27th, so that's one less entry the eventual winner has to compete with. However for those of you who can't decide, let me say one thing: GO!!!! You will not be disappointed. Not that Burton needs my official Rock And Roll Never Forgets endorsement, but he has it anyways.Â Â\n\nJackÂ\n\nÂ\n\nJust finished your Burton Cummings interview ... what a masterpiece!Â I saw the mini Guess Who reunion show in 2001 at The Rosemont Theater, too ... what a show!Â Would love to see Burton in concert again.Â Throw my hat in the ring ... but either way, I'm going!Â If I don't win tickets on Friday, I'll be buying them Friday Night!Â\n\nBob Â\n\nYES, Kent!\n\nLove the interviews!\n\nDebÂ Â\n\nHave never heard Burton Cummings live, but I congratulate the ticket winner as I know it will be the time of their lives.Â More great music.Â\n\nShelley J Sweet-TufanoÂ Â Â\n\nI'm applying to win the two free tickets to see Burton Cummings!Â Â The world's best voice (according to some guy named John Lennon.) Â\n\nThanks,Â\n\nMaureen LillaÂ\n\nLoved your discussion with Burton Cummings.Â Â Please add me to any of your lists soÂ I receive any email from you guys.Â Have a great day and all stay well.\n\nShawn Riley\n\nWelcome to Forgotten Hits, Shawn ... I think you're gonna like it here!Â (kk)Â Â Â\n\nSome corrections are in order with regards to your Guess Who article.Â\n\nIf you check, you will find the original name of the band was \"Chad Allan and the Reflections\" ... The name \"Reflections\" was taken by another band and thus the change to \"Expressions\".\n\nAlso, I believe (99 percent certain) that Burton Cummings joined the Guess Who in 1966 not 1967.\n\nLastly you might want to check on the song \"Timeless Love\" that I think charted on the US C/W charts.\n\nI just want to keep your site correct ... Would appreciate feedback.\n\nRichard Stonely\n\nWell, I think at best we're talking about \"technicalities\" here.Â\n\nChad Allan's band may have started out as \"The Reflections\" in 1962Â ... but at the time they recorded \"Shakin' All Over\", they were already known as Chad Allan and the Expressions ... soon to be re-christened The Guess Who (technically just \"Guess Who?\" ... the \"The\" was added later ... and the question mark was dropped) when that record was released.Â They've been The Guess Who ever since.Â\n\nMy research says that when Michigan's Reflections scored a hit with \"(Just Like) Romeo And Juliet\", Allan's group released their next single (\"A Shot Of Rhythm And Blues\") as Chad Allan and the Original Reflections.Â However, since BOTH groups were recording for the Quality Record Label, they quickly became Chad Allan and the Expressions ... prior to recording their cover of \"Shakin' All Over\".Â\n\nBurton's first charted record with the band came in 1967 as stated (\"His Girl\") ...Â heÂ first joined the band in the Summer of 1965Â as their keyboard player ... but he didn't move to the forefront until then, by which time Chad Allan had moved on.Â And finally, \"Timeless Love\" did NOT chart on Billboard's Country Chart ... so overall I think we did okay!!!Â (kk)Â\n\nHowever, while digging deeper I did discover a few things I didn't know ... Â\n\nIt was Pirate Radio in the UK that broke their single \"His Girl\" (which failed to chart back home in Canada or here in The States).\n\nAnd, on their 1966 LP \"Hey Ho, What You Do To Me\", the band recorded \"Hurting Each Other\", a song that would become a huge #1 Hit for The Carpenters six years later. (Jeez, who DIDN'T record this song?!?!)Â Yet EVERY early version failed to make an impact on the charts!Â (Burton, I love you guys ... but this is a God-Awful rendition of this song!!!! lol)Â kk\n\nKent -\n\nThe Burton Cummings interview was a fantastic read. You covered plenty of new ground and somehow kept it from becoming a rant about the imposter band who owns the name.Â\n\nBTW - Richard Perry says \"You're So Vain\" is about a composite of men, but mostlyÂ Warren Beatty. Â\n\nBe Well, Â\n\nCarl Wiser Â\n\nwww.songfacts.com\n\nI had always heard it was a conglomerate, too ... with Warren Beatty being the lead character ... and (as mentioned in the interview) Mick Jagger being a player as well.Â Knowing Mick, he probably got a real kick out of singing about himself as a possible candidate!Â (kk)\n\nÂ\n\nI am writing to join your many fans in congratulating you on a job well done with the Burton Cummings interview.Â He was one of my bucket list interviews and I got the chance around 20 years ago when Rhino released the Best Of Burton Cummings.Â It was one of my favorite on-air moments.Â Your interview and special featuresÂ brought back a lot of good memories.Â The song Star Baby got a great deal of play on WLS but was only #39 in Billboard.Â I remember them on the Midnight Special singing Clap For the Wolfman with Wolfman Jack joining them on stage.Â I enjoy all of their A and B sides.Â When Kurt Winter and Greg Leskiw joined the group, Â theÂ two-guitar attack made for some great tracks.Â The Burton Cummings song You Saved My Soul was the track my girl friend andÂ I called our song.Â Â I have now been married to my girl friend for 26 years!Â Â The song was from the movie Melanie which I have not seen since the early 80s on HBO.Â Â Thanks for bringing backÂ the memories!Â\n\nPhil - WRCOÂ\n\n\"Star Baby\" was HUGE here in Chicago (it peaked at #3) ... we used to play that one in OUR band, too!Â I will never forget seeing The Guess Who perform \"Clap For The Wolfman\" WITH Wolfman Jack on \"The Midnight Special\" ... Wolfman had become SO associated with the show as its host ... \"American Graffiti\" may have introduced him to a national audience but \"The Midnight Special\" put him over the top.Â I've never seen \"Melanie\", Burton's shot as an actor but it gets a pretty favorable review on imdb ... Â\n\nClick here: Melanie (1982) - IMDb ... in fact, it looks like it even won a few awards!Â (LOVE the song \"You Saved My Soul\" ... been playing it a lot here this past week!)Â Thanks for the kind words, Phil ... now I wanna hear YOUR interview with him!!!Â (kk)\n\nÂ\n\nI've been crazily busy lately, but never too busy to read Forgotten Hits. I've meant to comment on your interview with Burton, which was fantastic.Â\n\nHis Girl got lots of airplay back in 1967 in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and we had the single around the house. The flip was It's My Pride, which has found its way on to the Nugget series, I think.Â\n\nThe other thing that your interview did was to get me off my butt and finish buying the Guess Who and Burton solo stuff that I want on CD. You should get a kickback from Amazon. <grin>\n\nThanks again for all the great info.\n\nBill\n\nÂ\n\nI have been a BIG Guess Who fan and BC fan for 40 years. I simply loved that interview!\n\nKeep up the great work! I DIG IT!\n\nJeff Lamb\n\nHi Kent,\n\nCongratulations on all of the well-deserved accolades you have received in the presentation of the superlative Burton Cummings interview in Forgotten Hits ...Â as with a song, you can tell when it's a hit!Â\n\nI'm sure Burton Cummings, his Manager Lorne Saifer, and Tour-Manager Sam Boyd must be very pleased with the results and its content.Â What a great preface to what I'm sure will be one of the best music shows to hit Chicago this year!Â Burton Cummings' voice and compositions and their longevity speak for themselves.Â\n\nGreat interview again Kent, love Forgotten Hits -- continued growth and success!\n\nBest Regards,\n\nTim Kiley\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nKeep up the good work. Would love to see Burton Cummings, especially after your piece.\n\nKen Voss\n\nÂ\n\nKent ...\n\nYour interview with Burton Cummings was SPOT ON!!!!!Â What a cool dude ... I'm glad to see that he is still passionate about all of those old great songs ... shame he and Randy can't reconcile their differences 'cause a Guess Who Reunion would be KILLER!!!!!!Â\n\nAs always, keep up the great work you do, because all us oldies fans and old time radio folks sure as hell appreciate it!!!!!!!Â\n\nRock On!Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nPete G\n\nÂ"
