        "text": "Sorry, but this is an utterly nonsensical statement that is divorced from all reality.\n\nWe'll have to agree to disagree on the credibility issue. I've have twice now clearly outlined my position with regard to this. If you're determined not to get it, there's not much else I can say.\n\nAs for the \"poor, ignorant public,\" what you have to remember that they are different from you and me. They're not music freaks — they just view music as a pleasant background part of their lives. They won't be motivated to do the kind of research you're talking about. And it's very possible that many of them could go to a faux Guess Who show and come away perfectly satisfied. Good for them.\n\nBut the ignorance of the public still doesn't make passing off crippled versions of a band as the real deal any more ethical. And I will repeat: damn the legalities. The letter of the law and ethics don't necessarily always intersect.\n\nIn the past 25 years I've seen shows by \"The Vogues\" and \"The Shangri-las\" (fortunately, I got free tickets in both cases) in which the people standing up there on the stage had ZERO connection to any of the people who performed on the records that made those names famous. And I mean, ZERO. At each of those shows, one of those onstage said \"Here's a hit we had back in 1965.\" No you didn't.\n\nIn both cases, they had the legal right to do what they were doing. So are you OK with shows like this?\n\nThere is no faux Guess Who.\n\nWe were not talking about The Shangri-las but at least you saw them, so you have a shred of credibility.\n\nThe public I saw at the Peterson/Kale GW show were loving it. I was shocked and amazed to see, post show, a long, winding line up of autograph seekers clutching their GW records - which everyone in the band took the time out to sign and then chat with the person. No one cared that Burton wasn’t there, or felt cheated, largely because the show was damn good and the band were tight and exciting. But, I have no skin in this. I go see Burton and dig what he brings. I go see the current lineup of the GW and really enjoy that (I like their last record too). Neither comes close to what the band once was, but that was a long time ago.\n\nAs noted, you just don't get it. Let's see if I can try one more time:\n\nI DON'T HAVE TO SEE A SHOW THAT FEATURES NO ORIGINAL SHANGRI-LAS — IN PARTICULAR, NO MARY WEISS — TO KNOW THAT IT'S BOGUS AND NOT WORTH PAYING MONEY FOR. THERE IS NOTHING ANY OF THE IMPOSTERS COULD DO, INCLUDING A FULL STRIP-TEASE, THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THE SHOW WORTHWHILE.\n\n(By the way, as it was, \"The Shangri-las\" did exactly TWO Shangri-las songs the entire evening. Everything else was covers of other girl-group songs. What a joke! And the best part? People were lining up in the foyer of the theater after the show to get these imposters' autographs!!)\n\nIt's OK. I won't blame either you or the public for having lower standards that I do.\n\nBut you've dodged the question of ethics. If the show had been billed \"The Guess Who (featuring Jim Kale and/or Garry Peterson)\" or \"Garry Peterson's Guess Who,\" I would have less of a problem with it, because that would at least imply that it doesn't feature Burton Cummings.\n\nLOL. So should Fleetwood Mac in 2019 be \"Neil Finn (formerly of Crowded House)'s and Mike Campbell's Peter Green (who is no longer in the band)'s Fleetwood Mac (probably never featuring Lindsey Buckingham again)\"? I'd love to see rock band billings on concert posters in your ideal little world.\n\nHuh? Where did I say that it's \"exactly comparable\"? Your premise is that bands who no longer feature any or all of their \"principal singers/songwriters\" shouldn't be billed as simply the band name. Well, there's tons of grey area there. In your ideal world, who assigns importance and weighting to each individual member of a band to deem it within or not within the appropriate ethical bounds?\n\nIn the actual world, people paying for the tickets assign their own importance to a band's lineup. If they go and see the Guess Who in 2019 without doing any research (which, today, means a couple minutes of online browsing), they place little or no importance on who is in the band. I haven't heard stories of swarms of people demanding refunds because Burton Cummings wasn't there that night. Why? Because it's not an issue to the people who were there. The band billed as \"Garry Peterson's Guess Who\" wouldn't make a bit of difference in the band's current popularity. Outside of serious fans, no one knows who Garry Peterson is. The practicality of having a bunch of asterisks and qualifiers trailing after the name of every band not conforming to your \"ethics\" is zero.\n\nYou brought it up in the context of this discussion, using Fleetwood Mac as what you apparently thought would be a useful example to make your point. It is not a useful example, because there's a considerable difference between a Lindsay Buckingham-less Fleetwood Mac and a Burton Cummings-less Guess Who.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnyone with a lick of common sense does.\n\nLet's test your \"gray area\" theory. Please answer honestly — would you be OK with:\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revisited going out as Creedence Clearwater Revival?\n\nDave Grohl and Krist Novoselic deciding to do a few shows billed as Nirvana for old time's sake?\n\nA Mick Jagger-less Rolling Stones?\n\nPaul and Ringo doing a live show billed as The Beatles?\n\n(Numbers 1, 2 and 3 are pretty comparable to the Guess Who situation. And just to head you off at the pass, each band's relative degree of renown has no bearing on this question.)\n\nBecause some people are undiscriminating or just plain stupid doesn't mean you get a free pass when it comes to ethics. Furthermore, if it's \"not an issue\" with a phony billing for these folks, then it won't be an issue for them with an honest billing either, right?\n\nUsing your argument, a lot of people are OK with using a generic product rather than a brand-name one. So that being the case, why not just let ALL brands of cellophane tape call themselves Scotch Tape on their product packaging?\n\nI've never heard a strong argument in favor of the premise that bands are in some special category that makes them exempt from Truth in Advertising laws. Have you? (Note that I'm using \"laws\" in a figurative sense here; as I've said several times, the law and ethics are not necessarily co-joined.)\n\nAnd why is that? Can you explain how impossibly difficult it is to append either a band member's name to the concert billing, or failing that, \"A tribute to\"? What, exactly, are the insurmountable obstacles to doing this?\n\nThere are probably dozens of '60s acts who I like a few songs by but, if they were to do a show in my hometown, I wouldn't necessarily have a clue as to whether they were the real deal or not. In the case of the faux Guess Who, the ages of some members should give them away, but I wouldn't be shocked if some folks are getting bamboozled by this. At least until seeing the show.\n\nAs far as the latest reunion... I saw Bachman-Cummings about a decade ago, and saw Burton do an excellent solo gig not long after, so I will pass.\n\nWhen Colin Blunstone and Rod Argent first decided to work together again after many years, they were actually billed this way, under their names. I saw them on their first US tour. It was only for subsequent tours that they went back to the Zombies name.\n\nAs Colin was the band's lead vocalist on the vast majority of their recordings, and Rod Argent's keyboards defined the band's sound (he wrote all three of the band's chart hits and the majority of their album cuts as well), I would define the two of them as \"principal members.\" So this isn't anywhere near the example of \"The Guess Who\" or other egregious fake bands.\n\nAs for The Grass Roots, there wasn't anything particularly distinctive about the members of the band who provided their musical backup. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that studio musicians played on many of their recordings. Also, all of their hits were composed by outside writers rather than members of the band. So I wouldn't get too worked up about who made personal appearances under that name. Though I do agree that with Rob Grill is gone, whoever is touring as them now ought to have \"tribute\" appended somewhere.\n\nWarm memories, hit singles: Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings reunite for charity show | The Star\n\nFormer Guess Who bandmates Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings reunited on Thursday for a charity concert of warm memories and unforgettable hits that marked their first time performing together in a decade.\n\nThe on-again, off-again musical partnership reached a high note at Music Under the City Stars, a fundraiser in support of Canada’s Walk of Fame at Toronto’s landmark Casa Loma, where the duo reminisced about the good times.\n\nThey shared the stories behind their songs, including “American Woman” and “No Sugar Tonight,” and poked fun at each other about getting older.\n\n“This is the way they sounded when they were being written, before they became records,” Cummings, 71, explained before kicking off the 90-minute set of stripped-down takes without a backing band.\n\n“This is sort of like Randy and me inviting you into our living room in the old days.”\n\nFor the audience of roughly 200 people at the dinner and concert fundraiser — which went for $2,500 per seat — seeing Bachman and Cummings on friendly terms was a rare delight.\n\nThe Winnipeg-bred musicians have long battled over their personality differences and last performed together in 2009. Bachman wrote in his 2014 book Tales From Beyond the Tap about what he considered inequitable distribution of publishing profits between the two songwriters.\n\nNone of those squabbles were apparent as the musicians sat on opposite sides of the stage while chatting about their spot in Canadian history at an event that doubled as an announcement of the next generation of Walk of Fame inductees.\n\nAmong the names who will be honoured this year are the late Mr. Dressup children’s entertainer Ernie Coombs, actor Will Arnett and Olympic speedskater Cindy Klassen.\n\nBachman and Cummings are both two-time Walk of Fame inductees themselves, once for the Guess Who and the other in Bachman’s case for his work in Bachman-Turner Overdrive. Cummings has recognition as a solo artist.\n\nBoth artists acknowledged their post-Guess Who hits during the show. Bachman chose to perform songs that included “Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet” and “Takin’ Care of Business” from his days in Bachman-Turner Overdrive while Cummings sang his solo efforts “Stand Tall” and “Break It to Them Gently.”\n\nStill, neither of them could escape the fact they were reunited on stage to celebrate a certain part of their youth and the infectious classics that era inspired.\n\nBachman recalled how “girls were crying on the front lawn” of their house after news spread that Cummings had split from his R&B band the Deverons to join the Guess Who.\n\nTheir careers took off with “These Eyes,” which Bachman and Cummings co-wrote. The international hit single is a vocal feat that involves Cummings scaling the octaves each time, Bachman acknowledged.\n\n“It sounds easy, but if you’re trying to sing it, it just goes up and up and up,” he said.\n\n“I don’t think Céline (Dion) could sing this song. I’d love it if she tried.”\n\nBy David Friend The Canadian Press Sat., July 20, 2019"
