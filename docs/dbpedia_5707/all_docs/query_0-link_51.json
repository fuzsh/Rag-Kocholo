        "text": "So what's the deal?\n\nBachman & Cummings don't own the name The Guess Who, but they are on tour this year as Bachman & Cummings. Is it just those 2 or is there a supporting band? I saw The Guess Who in 2001 & 2002 and they were pretty good. How does this tour stand up and what should we expect??\n\nSaw that PBS special a year ago. Satisfying, but not knock-it-outta-the-park, IMHO. Like the new groove they gave \"American Woman\". They did more Cummings solo stuff than the Guess Who tour. The special that was re-edited for PBS was a one-off, I believe.\n\nI'm a firm believer that a true test of an artist is what they bring to the table besides what the older fans expect.\n\nWell, that was 34 or so years ago, so I don't know why you'd expect him to not change. Name a screamer from that era that can still do it?\n\nGAH! I saw them do it in 01, but watching an aged, overweight, Cummings with his shirt open, running his tongue up and down a mic stand was a bit gross if you ask me.\n\nAll 3 time that I caught them, they didn't do any Cummings solo stuff, but they did loads of BTO. Burton has lost his high vocal range.\n\nSo IS THERE a backing band, or just Randy & Burton like the PBS thingy?\n\nThat show is available on DVD, and is great!\n\nThe Sting song is \"Shape of My Heart\" btw...\n\nI saw them in Stratford in 2006. Burton had banged up his shoulder, still he did a pretty good job. Yeah, he's lost a ton of range, but my quibble is more about the vocal vamping he does, along with how he's changed his vocal phrasing, giving him this ersatz soul kind of thing. Randy was sounding wonderful, and the band is tight, but also on a tight leash. They leave the pyrotechnics to Randy. A new guitarist is with them now too - used to play with Ron Sexsmith...\n\nThey are FABULOUS.....Burton and Randy tour now with the\n\nCarpet Frogs and put on a terrific show. I last saw them about\n\ntwo years ago and I certainly didn't notice anything amiss with\n\nCummings' voice....hey, it's not 1969 anymore.\n\nI'm going to see them in Detroit Friday night. It will be interesting\n\nto see how many folks they draw to the 18,000-seat shed.\n\nBachman Cummings did a sumemr tour in 2006 where they played Toronto on June 23.\n\nIt was very good. Both seemed re-energized and they did mix up the setlist quiteabit compared to the previous couple of Guess Who tours.\n\nI thought it was really good that they added some solo BC songs into the set. Never understood how the Guess Who could play 3 BTO songs and let omit Burton's solo material.\n\nSo THAT'S been fixed!\n\nZGot to see Bachman/Cummings last night. Good show! Burton actually sounded really good, too! They've got a crack band of younger guys. None of them could have been over 40 and all their material was performed authentically, which is great! A few surprises- fairly tame versions of Chuck Berry's 'Little Queenie' and Bo Diddley's 'Who Do You Love'.\n\nI just wish they'd get hip and do some older material like- It's My Pride (I'd soil my jeans if they played that one), Shakin' All Over, etc.\n\nSeems they've scaled back their show a bit from the 2000/2001/2002 shows- They did not perform- Guns Guns Guns, Running Back To Saskatoon, Glamour Boy, Rain Dance, Bus Rider, Friends of Mine all of which I've seen preformed within the same concerts.\n\nAll of this... if anyone really cares.\n\nThey only played, what, 90 minutes last night?! On at 8:30,\n\noff at 10. I've been going to shows at Pine Knob for 29 years\n\nand that's the shortest set by a headliner that I've seen - who\n\ndo they think they are, Van Morrison? I enjoyed them,\n\nhowever....like I always do. Good sized crowd, too - for an act\n\nthat really has no profile in the U.S anymore.\n\nWhen I saw them (as the Guess Who with Garry Peterson and Donnie McDougal) in 2001, they opened with \"Shakin' All Over\", but they had dropped \"Runnin' Back To Saskatoon\" which was a disappointment to me (RBTS is my favorite Guess Who song).\n\nNo \"Bus Rider\"?????????????? (My second fave Guess Who song) And you didn't feel deprived?\n\nMS: do you have the Rinnin' Back Thorugh Canada video?\n\nIn 2001, they were the headliners on a bill with Joe Cocker. Judging by the audience's reaction at the show I saw, the order of the bill should have been reversed. I don't mean to impugn the Guess Who's show (I loved every second of it - I knew and sang along to every song in their set), but you are correct. People know the hits but in the US they are kind of faceless. In Canada, Burton and Randy are much more recognizable. You'll notice that the \"county fair and casino\" version of the Guess Who (with Garry peterson adn Jim Kale) rarely tour or even perform in Canada while Burton and Randy are constantly touring Canada with rare excursions Stateside."
