        "text": "Burton Cummings is a Canadian rock and roll musician who has been performing since the mid 60s. It wasn’t until 1976 that he decided to pursue a career on his own, performing his own material, which was around the time that he made the move down to Sherman Oaks in LA. He began writing and singing in films in the late 70s. He is truly amazing to watch live, with his amazing piano skills being showcased, performing some fantastic boogie-woogie style piano as he goes. One of the things that really draws in these patrons tonight is that he is constantly smiling and is so grateful for how far he’s come over time doing what he loves doing. “Stand Tall” is the biggest song of his set this evening and inspires everyone in this room to sing along. He’s all about getting the audience involved and making them feel at home whatever city he goes to. “Break it to them Gently” lights up this audience this evening too.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nIt was a fabulous night with Canada's own \"Piano Man\"! Burton Cummings, co-founder of the original, best-selling Canadian band, The Guess Who, put on a brilliant show. Just him, alone at the keyboard. This emphasized how good his voice still is, despite him saying it wasn't quite up to par. One of the \"best rock voices in music\" still has it! Add to that some humorous anecdotes and bits (imitating Gordon Lightfoot [very well, I might add], playing Rod Stewart}, plus a touching tribute to the late Bobby Vee made it a special, intimate experience.\n\nThe opening act, singer/songwriter Jonathan Roy (son of NHL goalie Patrick Roy), was a pleasant surprise. He sings well and has great stage presence for one so young. He'll go far!\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nI've been a friend and follower of Burton Cummings music since i was 10 years old. first song i ever heard was The Guess Who's song he wrote called \"Albert Flasher\" after listening to that I became a fan. First time I saw him live was July 2011 I was very lucky I got to meet his lead guitarist he got me a signed autographed from Burton and we talked a lot after the show that night I also met his drummer and bass player to they are great guys and so talented as well I cannot wait to not only see Burton Cummings live again but also on his 71st birthday on new years eve what a special night its gonna be I pray and hope I'll meet Burton to fingers crossed and of course rock and roll is here to stay\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nHi my baby and I love Burton Cummings. It was the first time we seen him live. Wow wee what a show he was amazing . So talented. His voice was strong if not even better then years ago. The way he played the piano. Holy crap. Listening to all the songs that I've been listening to since I was 11 brought back the best yrs of my life as a child. My man couldn't stop smiling. The band was fantastic. I loved when Burton talked about what the songs were about. I thought that was really cool. He is also very funny and very real. A true Canadian . Can't wait to see him again. Love love love the whole show and it was our pleasure to of been there in the 7 th row.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nI have been listening to Burton Cummings since I have been 14(now 61). I have never enjoyed an inside concert so much as I did his on August 16 2016 in the Casino Moncton NB. I knew ever song he sang. A few brought a tear to my eye. The only regret I have is on my part - I never brought my camera!! I would recommend everyone to go see him in performance. Loved loved loved the concert if the one on the 17th hadn't been sold out I would have went to see him again. Hopeful I can find someone I know that went and got some pics. Keep singing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nHave seen Burton in concert many, many times. Every time I am overwhelmed by his talent, his humbleness and his genuine love of performing. If you get a chance to see him, GO! I promise you will not be disappointed. Oh and I should tell the ladies to beware because he's still got it! Those eyes and the dimples....swoon! Truly a Canadian legend; no a worldwide legend seems more fitting! He is one of Canada's greatest treasures for sure! Love you Burton and will see you at Rama and the Western Fair this summer! XO\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nThe show was awesome, but a Burton Cummings show is always the best. All seats.are good ones at the Arcada Theatre. We went early and enjoyed a tasty dinner at the Speakeasy on the third floor, a very beautiful, authentic reproduction of the 1920's lifestyle complete with flappers! The MC/manager of the theatre was very entertaining with a great sense of humor. My only regret is that we haven't known about this gem earlier! We will definitely be returning for more shows at the Arcada and Burton Cummings.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nI got to see Burton Cummings for the first time in my life (July 3, 2015 at Casino Rama) and all I can say is that is was a truly amazing experience. Seeing the energy with which he performed on stage was awe inspiring. The concert was packed with hits from both his Guess Who and solo careers and of course the highlight was his 12-minute rendition of \"American Woman\". Backed by an outstanding local band (The Carpet Frogs), the man is a true Canadian legend!\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nAbsolutely phenominal performance. Better than the last time we saw him. So proud he is our canadian legend. So effortless his voice. Completely in astonishment how intense and active he is for his age. Connects with the audience like no othet. I am truly honoured to have been in his presence. Would see him night after night if i could. Hope he comes back more often to the east coast like he says he will but also makes time for himself.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nAn amazing concert one of the best concerts I've gone to was always a dream of mine to go see him always listened to him . I wish that my mom would've been able to go and see him with me I'm sure she heard him up in heaven though .I took my 13 year old daughter with me and she loved him actually the whole concert was amazing high fives\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
