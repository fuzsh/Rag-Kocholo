Jean and Bourgeois had been backing musicians for Montréal humorists Rock Et Belles Oreilles from 1986 to 1987 before leaving to form their own group Les Beau Blonds in 1987 with Alain Lapointe. Their first splash of recognition was when they appeared as Les Beaux Blonds on the Marc Drouin song ‘Crache Ton Cash’ the same year. They were signed to La Maison de Disques Isba in 1988 and they released their self-titled debut album as Les B.B. (a name they would keep) the following year. 1991’s ‘Snob’ would be their breakthrough album which spawned six hits in Quebec and France including “Donne-Moi Ma Chance,” “Comme Un Loup,” and the title track. They advanced the single “Seul Au Combat” for a follow-up albumin 1993, but the group and the label soon parted ways. Les B.B. moved to Les Disques Tox next and released a live album entitled ‘Une Nuit Avec Les B.B.’ which was followed by their third studio album ‘3’ in 1994. The only single, “Tu Ne Sauras Jamais,” failed to do well on the charts and the group called it a day; François Jean and Patrick Bourgeois both released solo albums but could not match the success of their Les B.B. days. They reunited in 2004 for the album ‘Bonheur Facile’ and again in 2011 for ‘Univers.’ In 2015 they released ‘Les BB 25’ featuring the group and guest artists such as Roch Voisine, Jean-Marc Couture, Mara Tremblay, and Damien Robitaille among others recreating the group’s greatest hits; Patrick Bourgeois passed away November 26, 2017; François Jean passed away November 16, 2020.

In his teenage years he formed the band Kid Wikkid, and performed for many years at most of the hard rock clubs like The Gasworks and Rock And Roll Heaven in Toronto, Ontario. The band managed to get their demo track “Take a Look At Me” on Attic Records’ ‘Maple Metal’ compilation. However, they were never able to parlay that exposure into a record deal. When lead singer Mike Fallon quit New Jersey metal band Skid Row in 1987, Bach was asked to join after they saw him at the wedding for rock photographer Matt Weiss. Bach turned them down until hearing their demo tape and soon was flown to New Jersey to start performing live with Skid Row. With the help of Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, who signed the band to a publishing deal, Skid Row managed to land a record deal with Atlantic Records. They would have international success with their albums ‘Skid Row’ (1989) and ‘Slave to the Grind’ (1991) on the back of the radio hit “18 and Life”, “I Remember You” and “Youth Gone Wild”. The band would play North America and Europe with Bon Jovi, Aerosmith and Mötley Crüe among others. As the hair-metal era gave way to grunge in the mid-90s, Skid Row was left struggling to stay relevant and following Bach’s negotiation with KISS for Skid Row to open for them on a tour, Bach was fired in 1996 for undermining the band’s headlining potential (imagined or otherwise). In 1996, Bach formed a new band called The Last Hard Men, with guitarist Jimmy Flemion (Frogs), lead guitarist Kelley Deal (Breeders), and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin (Smashing Pumpkins). The group recorded a full-length, self-titled album for Atlantic Records but wasn’t release. Deal managed to issue it on her own Nice Records in 1998. In 2000, Bach made his Broadway debut in ‘Jekyll & Hyde’ from April 2000 through September 2000. Because of critical raves his run was extended until October that year. He also appeared as Riff Raff in ‘The Rocky Horror Show’ in 2001 and at the ‘New York Steel’ benefit concert for victims of 9/11 on November 28, 2001. In October 2002 Bach performed in the national touring production of ‘Jesus Christ Superstar’ playing the title role. He also reprised a brief revival of ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ in 2004. After auditioning for Velvet Revolver (and losing out to Scott Weiland), Bach started a recurring role in the TV show Gilmore Girls as as lead guitarist in the fictitious band Hep Alien. In 2004 Bach was featured in the VH1 series ‘I Married…’ for the episodes ‘I Married Sebastian Bach’ where he also had a new act – Bach Tight Five – live with him and his family. The band was short-lived. Bach then appeared as lead singer on Henning Pauly’s Frameshift band LP entitled ‘An Absence of Empathy’ in 2005. In 2006 Bach was invited by Axl Rose to appear as a guest vocalist on several dates of Guns ‘N Roses’ tour stops that year. That same year Bach, Ted Nugent, Evan Seinfeld, Jason Bonham and Scott Ian starred in the VH1 reality TV show ‘Supergroup’ where the members had to live together as a band in a mansion in Las Vegas. They had 12 days to write and record music in a band called Damnocracy. Bach created his own record label in a deal with EMI Music which allowed him to record and release the solo album ‘Angel Down’ which was released in November 2007. The album just scraped the bottom of the Billboard Top200 album chart. He would also sing on the Guns ‘N Roses song “Sorry” for the 2008 GNR comeback album ‘Chinese Democracy’. Bach toured solo in the summer of 2008 opening for the likes of Poison and Dokken. He also did a solo tour of Australia. Bach also appeared in the 2nd season of the CMT Network’s reality competition show ‘Gone Country’ which he subsequently won. Bach was the opening act on Guns ‘N Roses’ 2009/2010 sporadic ‘Chinese Democracy’ Tour. In 2011 Sebastian Bach released the album ‘Kicking and Screaming’. In 2014 he released the album ‘Give ‘Em Hell’. He released the single “What Do I Got To Lose?” in 2023 digitally, and in 2024 released “Everybody Bleeds” as a prelude to a new studio album.

When the license to use the name reverted back to former band member John Kale they decided to carry on as Bachman-Cummings. With long-time cover band The Carpet Frogs backing them, the duo decided to release two CDs – ‘Bachman-Cummings Songbook’ (2006) featuring remakes of their hits, and ‘Jukebox’ (2007) featuring cover versions of their favourite songs by other artists. With Bachman working regularly on his radio show ‘Vinyl Tap’, writing a second book and reuniting with C.F. Turner to relive their BTO days, Burton Cummings carried on with The Carpet Frogs touring solo and recording a new solo album in 2010; plans are under way for a reunion between the two artists for a 2020 tour.

Fred Turner (lead vocals, bass) / Blair Thornton (guitar, backing vocals) / Robbie Bachman (drums, percussion, backing vocals)\n\nDuring the 1960’s Randy Bachman was a founding member of Chad Allan & The Expressions who would go on to fame and fortune as the Guess Who. Bachman had been slugging it out for 10 years by the time the band struck gold with No.1 hits like “These Eyes”, “Laughing” and “American Woman” and decided to leave the group while they were on top. Upon leaving the band, he released a solo album called ‘Axe’ for RCA in 1970. The album did little and Bachman found himself yearning for the creativity of a collaborative atmosphere. He called his old Guess Who cohort Chad Allen and they decided to put a new band together. Allen would supply vocals, keyboard and rhythm guitar while Bachman’s younger brother, Robin, would handle drums. The trio became Brave Belt and headed into the studio to record their debut album with Bachman doing double duty on bass guitar. As fate would have it, they landed Fred Turner as bassist just as Brave Belt’ was completed (Turner doesn’t appear on the album despite his picture on the jacket). The album was released Brave Belt in 1971 on Reprise Records. By 1972’s ‘Brave Belt II’, the band was starting to show its heavier side particularly with the new addition of C.F. Turner’s songwriting and gritty truck driver vocals which appeared to conflict with Chad Allen’s vision of the band. Allen’s contributions to the record were minimal and he quit before the record was released. (‘Brave Belt II’ would eventually be re-issued following the success of B.T.O under the auspicious handle of Bachman-Turner-Bachman as Brave Belt’) . With the limited success of the first two albums Randy Bachman began hunting for a better record deal which he found with Mercury/Polydor. By then, Chad Allen had been replaced by another Bachman brother, Tim, on guitar and the direction of the band slid into an even heavier mode. By this time, Brave Belt III’, was the intended next record but with a new label and band direction the group changed gears, literally, and became Bachman Turner Overdrive (or B.T.O. for short). ‘Bachman Turner Overdrive’ was released in 1973 on Mercury Records and stayed in the charts for 68 weeks. After four tries, the only successful single from the record was “Blue Collar” which managed a reasonable position of #68 on Billboard’s Hot 100. By year end they managed to pull out another album from their creative rebirth with ‘Bachman Tuner Overdrive II. The album was pushed all the way to Top10 by the driving force of the bubbling under “Let It Ride” and the monster hit “Takin’ Care of Business”. With the departure of Tim Bachman and addition of Blair Thornton on guitar, BTO’s 1974 album ‘Not Fragile’ gave the band the type of success that Randy Bachman had not scene since the Guess Who’s’ ‘American Woman’ in 1969. The album rode the charts at No.1 from the success of the worldwide number one single “You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet” and its seminal follow-up “Roll on Down the Highway”. Subsequently, the world took a backward glance at BTO and their first two albums became certified gold in 1974. By the fourth album, ‘Four Wheel Drive’ BTO were international superstars and this album too proved to be a monster, peaking at #5 on Billboard, becoming certified platinum, and providing another catchy radio anthem in “Hey You”. Tired of the same old chugging rhythms, BTO diversified for their 5th album and revisited their jazzy blues roots a la “Blue Collar” on ‘Head On’ in December 1975. The album produced the mellow and intricate “Looking Out For #1” and other tunes on the record flexed BTO’s stylistic muscle like the Little Richard assisted piano rocker “Take It Like a Man”. It became apparent that now the band was in the spotlight a power struggle over song representation was bubbling to the surface. While nagging personal conflicts plagued the ranks, Mercury rush released ‘The Best of BTO (So Far)’ during the summer of 1976 in anticipation of a new studio album. When the smoke cleared, Randy Bachman had wrestled controlling interest in the song writing duties from C.F. Turner on 1977’s ‘Freeways’. The internal conflicts showed as the first single, “My Wheels Won’t Turn”, died at radio. Mercury panicked while the album sank and rebounded with 1977’s ‘BTO Japan Tour – Live’ but the bloom was off the rose – Randy Bachman left BTO due to the typical ‘musical differences’ ploy and recorded his second solo album, ‘Survivor’ (1978) . BTO carried on with new recruit Jim Clench (April Wine) on bass. This freed Turner up to switch to guitar and resume lead vocals duties. The first release from the new LINE-UP was ‘Street Action’ in February 1978 but failed to do anything to stem the tide of their lagging popularity. With the old college try and an attempted career make over manager Bruce Allen brought in some young songwriters who had a modicum of success with Prism — Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance. BTO pushed out one more release, ‘Rock’n’Roll Nights’, before calling it a day in 1979. Turner would later pop up as vocalist for Bachman’s 1981 project, Union, for one album ‘On Strike’ before that too disbanded. By 1983 the original line up met to discuss a BTO reunion. Randy Bachman wanted to include Tim Bachman as part of the reformation, while other brother Robbie had pushed for Thornton who was considered a better musician. Randy Bachman made the final choice of adding brother Tim and Robbie bowed out of the reunion citing irreconcilable differences. Instead Gary Peterson from the Guess Who joined BTO as their new drummer. 1984’s ‘BTO’ was the result of this reunion and inspired one lack lustre single “For the Weekend”. This line up managed to survive a tour, recording shows as they went along, and the album ‘Live Live Live’ materialized in 1986. The cards fell apart again and Tim Bachman carried on with a new set of musicians as BTO including second guitarist Randy Murray. But, BTO would never rest as the classic version of the band reunited yet again as CF Turner, Randy Bachman, Blair Thornton and Robbie Bachman made a comeback in 1988. They were able to hold the band together to tour for three years before Randy Bachman decided he’d finally had enough and bailed out in 1991. Randy Murray who had been part of Tim Bachman’s BTO replaced Randy Bachman. A LINE-UP consisting of Rob Bachman, CF Turner, Blair Thornton and Randy Murray still plays live, mostly in festival situations and the band finally made it back into the studio to record another album with 1996’s ‘Trial By Fire’, consisting of 5 new tracks and a handful of re-recorded BTO classics. The first single was a cover of the Animals’ “House of the Rising Sun”. Both Randy Bachman and Fred Turner reunited briefly for a February 2000 appearance on the animated TV show ‘The Simpsons’. In 2010 they released a new album and toured under the name Bachman-Turner; Jim Clench died on November 3, 2010 after a battle with cancer; Robbie Bachman died January 12, 2023; Tim Bachman passed away April 29, 2023. The trademark to the band name and logo reverted back to Randy Bachman shortly after. A new tour was announced in June 2023 featuring a new BTO line-up of Randy Bachman, Tal Bachman, Mick Dalla-Vee, and Mark LaFrance. with notes from Randy Bachman, and John Einarson.

The band reached No.1 on Billboard’s singles chart with “You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet” and album chart with ‘Not Fragile’, as well as scoring another handful of hits including “Taking Care of Business,” “Hey You,” “Let It Ride”, “Blue Collar” and “Looking Out for #1.” When the two stars went their separate ways in 1977, Randy Bachman continued to pursue a solo career, as well as being part of the four year Guess Who reunion (1999-2003), then a continuation with Burton Cummings as Bachman-Cummings, and subsequently establishing himself as a jazz artist and host of the CBC/Sirius radio show ‘Vinyl Tap’. Meanwhile, Fred Turner carried on with the other members of Bachman-Turner Overdrive before retiring from music at the end of the ’90s to indulge his passion for cars. Then, in 2009, while Bachman was working on a solo album he asked Turner to guest vocal on a track called “Rock ‘n’ Roll is the Only Way Out.” It worked out so well that Turner ended up singing on a few more. This led to an exchange of new ideas with Turner sending Bachman his most recent writing and Bachman’s solo album morphed into the Bachman & Turner project. In 2010 they released their first single, “Rollin’ Along”, and debuted their new live act (featuring Brent Howard, Marc LaFrance and Mick Dalla-vee) in June 2010 at the Sweden Rock Festival alongside Aerosmith, Guns N’ Roses and Billy Idol. The full length CD ‘Bachman & Turner’ followed along with select North American and European dates. The highlight of these performances was the PBS broadcast ‘Live at the Roseland Ballroom’ in New York where fellow Canadian Paul Shaffer sat in on keyboards. The show was released on DVD/Blu-Ray in 2011. They also appeared at the 2010 Grey Cup half-time show. Bachman & Turner would also team up for shows with Paul Rodgers (Bad Company).

They played Top 40 material by American rock and roll acts. In 1962 they changed their name to Chad Allan And The Reflections and later as Chad Allan And The Expressions. It was this incarnation that landed a recording contract with Quality Records. Soon they released several singles, but it was difficult getting Canadian music onto Canadian radio. Quality, on the advice of Walt Grealis at RPM Magazine suggested they release the band’s next single, “Shakin’ All Over”, with a plain label that said ‘Guess Who?’. The single became a hit in 1965 and the band name stuck. Eventually members Bob Ashley and Chad Allan left the group and by 1966 a new hot-shot keyboardist/vocalist joined by the name of Burton Cummings. The band released many more singles for Quality between 1966 and 1967. After four poor selling albums for Quality Records, they sold the Guess Who’s contract to studio owner and producer Jack Richardson’s newly formed Nimbus 9 label for $1,000. In early 1968, after recording 2 singles and half of a special Coca-Cola promotional LP (with The Staccatos on the flipside) called ‘A Wild Pair’, Nimbus 9 decided to release a full length album containing eight Bachman/Cummings originals called ‘Wheatfield Soul’. This tenacity by both Nimbus and RCA paid off as the first single, “These Eyes”, broke new ground in the US eventually reaching No.3 on the charts and selling 1,000,000 copies. Embarrassed Canadian broadcasters, who had followed American music trends to the letter, were soon forced to playlist the song. The doors were now open for a string of hits including the double-A sided “Laughing/Undun” and their biggest selling record of all time – “American Woman”. Bachman had been slugging it out for 10 years by this point and decided to leave the group while they were on top. Upon leaving the band, he released a solo album called ‘Axe’ for RCA in 1970. The album did little and Bachman found himself yearning for the creativity of a collaborative atmosphere. He called his old Guess Who cohort Chad Allan and they decided to put a new band together. Allan would supply vocals, keyboard and rhythm guitar while Bachman’s younger brother, Robin, would handle drums. The trio became Brave Belt and headed into the studio to record their debut album with Bachman doing double duty on bass guitar. As fate would have it, they landed Fred Turner as bassist just as ‘Brave Belt’ was completed . By 1972’s ‘Brave Belt II’, the band was starting to show its heavier side particularly with Turner’s songwriting and gritty truck driver vocals which appeared to conflict with Chad Allan’s vision of the band. Allan’s contributions to the record were minimal and he quit before the record was released. With the limited success of the first two albums Randy Bachman began hunting for a better record deal which he found with Mercury/Polydor. At this point another Bachman brother, Tim, was added on guitar and the musical direction of the band became even heavier. By this time ‘Brave Belt III’ was the intended next record but with a new label and band direction the group changed gears, literally, and became ‘Bachman-Turner Overdrive’. ‘Bachman- Turner Overdrive’ was released in 1973 on Mercury Records and stayed in the charts for 68 weeks. After four tries, the only successful single from the record was “Blue Collar” which managed a reasonable position of No.68 on Billboard’s Hot 100. By year end they managed to pull out another album from their creative rebirth with ‘Bachman Tuner Overdrive II. The album was pushed all the way to Top10 by the driving force of the bubbling under “Let It Ride” and the monster hit “Takin’ Care of Business”. 1974’s album ‘Not Fragile’ gave the band the type of success that Randy Bachman had not scene since the Guess Who’s’ ‘American Woman’ in 1969. The album rode the charts at #1 from the success of the worldwide number one single “You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet” and its seminal follow-up “Roll on Down the Highway”. Subsequently, the world took a backward glance at BTO and their first two albums became certified gold in 1974. Bachman recorded seven studio albums, a ‘best of’, and fifteen charting singles. His final release with BTO was 1977’s ‘BTO Japan Tour – Live’ at which time Bachman quit the band due to the typical ‘musical differences’ and recorded his second solo album, ‘Survivor’ (1978) . Internal upheavals at the record label caused Bachman to beg out of his deal and he instead approached friends of his, the Scotti Brothers, who had just formed their own label. They were interested more in rock bands than solo performers and Bachman made one to order called Ironhorse. He brought in guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Tom Sparks from Washington State and added Chris Leighton on drums. They released two singles from their debut album including “Sweet Lui Louise”, before the band saw the departure of Sparks and the addition of former Trooper keyboardist/vocalist Frank Ludwig. With the change in direction and failure of the 1980 follow-up album ‘Everything Is Grey’, the band parted ways with Scotti Brothers. Bachman called up his old BTO and Brave Belt buddy Fred Turner to augment the existing three piece of Bachman, Leighton and Ludwig under the new name Union. The band released one album, ‘On Strike’, which spawned two singles for the US-based Portrait label (Heart, Burton Cummings). The album sank like a stone and the band dissolved. By 1983 the original line up of BTO met to discuss a reunion. Randy Bachman wanted to include Tim Bachman as part of the reformation, while other brother Robbie had pushed for Blair Thornton who was considered a better musician. Randy Bachman made the final choice to include his brother Tim Bachman causing Robbie Bachman to bow out of the reunion citing irreconcilable differences. Instead, Garry Peterson from the Guess Who joined BTO as their new drummer. In between these events the Guess Who also reunited for a live outing and album. But, BTO would never rest as the classic version of the band reunited yet again as CF Turner, Randy Bachman, Blair Thornton and Robbie Bachman made a comeback in 1988. They were able to hold the band together to tour for three years before Randy Bachman decided he’d finally had enough and bailed out in 1991. Bachman returned to running his own Ranbach label where he has released rare material by the original Guess Who, Lenny Breau and other guitarists in the Guitarchives series. He has also written two books, hosts the ‘Vinyl Tap’ radio show, released several solo CDs, put the Guess Who back together again from 1999-2003, toured and recorded with Cummings under the name Bachman-Cummings, and again in 2010 with CF Turner as Bachman & Turner.

After graduating he left to to be a missionary and study Spanish in Argentina for two years. After returning to British Columbia he spent the next three years writing songs and trying to land a record deal with help from his father. Randy Bachman pushed some record label connections and soon, Tal was signed to the US Columbia label. Vancouver ite Bob Rock was enlisted to co-produce Tal’s debut album. Bachman’s self-titled debut was released in 1999 and the lead-off single, “She’s So High”, became a monster smash hit for him globally. Soon Bachman’s songs began appearing on such television shows as ‘NYPD Blue’ and ‘Dawson’s Creek’. But the failure for the album’s second single to chart significantly left Bachman at the mercy of the industry declaring him a one-hit wonder. Troubles with management and A & R direction from Columbia Records found Tal switching management and labels. His sophomore CD, ‘Staring Down the Sun’, was released in August 2004 on the Sextent label and he made the Top20 on Canadian charts with the song “Aeroplane.” Tal Bachman is in the current re-configured version of Bachman-Turner Overdrive with his father Randy Bachman.\n\nSingles\n\n1999 She’s So High/Angeline (Columbia) CSK-41393\n\n1999 B-sides [3-song EP] (Columbia/SONY) CSK-42117\n\n1999 If You Sleep (Radio Edit)/If You Sleep (Album Version) (Columbia) CSK-46467\n\n2000 Romanticide (Columbia/Sony)\n\n2004 Aeroplane (Panic Media)\n\nAlbums\n\n1999 Tal Bachman (Columbia) CK-67956\n\n1999 B-Sides [3-song EP] (Columbia – US) CSK-42117\n\n2000 If You Sleep [5-song EP] (Columbia/Sony – AUSTRALIA) 667951-2\n\n2004 Staring Down The Sun (Sextent) 70037-2\n\n2007 Don’t Let Your Friends Name Your Album\n\nBACHOTS, Les\n\nPierre Archambault (acoustic guitar, vocals) / Pierre Martin (acoustic guitar, vocals) / Gilles Thérien (acoustic guitar, vocals)\n\nAlbums\n\n1965 Les Bachots, Vol. 1 (Select) M.298-102\n\nBACK STREET JOURNAL\n\nMarvin Carlson (bass, vocals) / Larry Johnson (drums) / Al Shirley (vocals, keyboards) / Steve Lehr (lead guitar) / Jack Sundrud (lead vocals, rhythm guitar)\n\nSingles\n\n1967 I’m Not With You/Ain’t Too Proud To Beg (Franklin) FR-104\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n2008 “I’m Not With You” and “Ain’t Too Proud To Beg” (Super Oldies) SOCD-6\n\nBACKROADS\n\nBruce Frazer (lead vocals) / Neil Doherty (lead guitar, backing vocals)\n\nLead vocalist Bruce Frazer and guitarist Doherty were originally part of a previous group called Summerhill, which included Rob Fraser (guitar), Mario Mekis (drums) and Vic Unsworth (bass, keyboards).

They did some successful road work before deciding to bring in a fourth member, Dave Hines and new drummer Todd Collison. With Cam Atkinson as manager they changed their name to Bad Habits and began playing in the snow-belt of Northern Toronto. Several more LINE-UPs changes followed before the band entered their tape into the annual Q107 Homegrown contest and won a spot on the contest album. Unfortunately for the band, former manager Atkinson owned the name and the group were forced to come up with an alternate moniker before the album went to press – thus Bad Rabitz was born. Jim Merrill still plays around the Bracebridge, Ontario area using the original band name, Bad Habits, given back to him by Atkinson.

His first releases were on Rodeo Records with The Dan Penny Orchestra accompanying him. He was record for Mala and Chateau (with The Naturals) including “Oh, What Love Is” which led to a deal with Ford Records in New York. The song was re-issued, and several others followed giving him a new profile in the United States. By the early ’70s, Bailey re-invented himself as a middle of the road entertainer with many more singles on GRT Records; Bailey died from a heart attack on September 2, 1987.\n\nSingles\n\n1971 Westward Home/A Liar, A Fool, A Madman (Vintage) SCV-1101\n\n1971 (The Whole World’s) Down On You/Here Comes The Rain (GRT) 1230-07\n\n1972 On Your Way Out/Search With No Ease (GRT) 1230-12\n\n1972 Charlie’s Picture/My Woman, My Woman, My Wife (GRT) 1230-24\n\n1972 Darlin’/I’m Looking Through You (GRT) 1230-34\n\n1972 Here’s To Lovin’ You/That Time (GRT) 1230-37\n\n1972 I Can’t Look Sunday In The Eye/Molly Brown (GRT) 1230-44\n\n1973 Aaron Brown/The Key to My Happiness (GRT) 1230-59\n\n1973 Last Night I Loved His Baby/For A While (GRT) 1230-73\n\n1975 My Life Had Not Begun/Victim Of Misery (Dominion) 177\n\n1976 Drivin’ Nails In My Coffin/Detour//The Place Where I Used To Live (Pow Wow) JB-001\n\n1978 You Can’t Fight An Old Flame/You Gotta Have Hope (Quick Silver) QS-71845\n\n1984 Walk With Me/My Empty Room (Bel Air) BA-210\n\nas JACKSON (JACK) BAILEY\n\n1985 I Remembered You Baby/Thirty Miles Ahead (Country Gold) CG45-0185\n\n1986 Keep Me/[same (Country Gold) CG45-0186\n\nwith JACK BAILEY AND THE DAN PENNY ORCHESTRA\n\n1958 Devil Moon/Let Me Know (Rodeo) 45-RO.196\n\n1959 The Bad Apple/What’s the Matter With Me (Rodeo) RO-206\n\nwith JACK BAILEY AND THE NATURALS\n\n1961 Lonesome Fool/I Can’t Believe It’s True (Chateau) C-111\n\n1961 A River Is Not As Wide As A Sea/Memories Of You (Chateau) C-117\n\n1961 Life’s Like The River/Memories Of You (Mala – US) 432\n\n1961 Oh What Love Is/Beneath The Moonlight (Chateau) C-125\n\n1962 Tiger Lil/Your Magic Touch (Ford – US) 113\n\n1962 I Cried/I Was A Fool To Care (Ford – US) 121\n\n1963 Let’s Live A Little/With This Ring I Thee Wed (Ford – US) 125\n\nwith JACKSON “JACK” BAILEY AND HIS BAILIFFS\n\n1968 The Farmer’s Daughter/Victim Of Misery (Panther) QC-608\n\n1970 This Old Road Of Love/I’m Just A Farmboy (Panther) QC-642\n\nAlbums\n\n1970 Jack Bailey Breaks Out (Dominion) LPS-21029\n\n1971 Jack Bailey (GRT) 9230-1003\n\n1972 Here’s To Lovin’ You (GRT) 9230-1017\n\n1973 Keep Me (GRT) 9230-1038\n\n1976 Tears Of A Man (Pow Wow) JB-1001\n\n1977 Bailey Then And Now (Panther) QC-680\n\n1979 In The Style Of Hank Snow [cassette] (Starburst) SBC-14\n\n1981 Greatest Hits Made Famous By Hank Williams [8-track] (Starburst) 10022\n\nwith JACK BAILEY & LARRY DEE\n\n1979 In The Style Of Willie & Leon [8-track] (Starburst) SBT-145\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1999 “Oh What Love Is” on ‘Shakin’ Up North – Canadian Rockabilly Vol. 1′ (Bear Family) B-16289\n\nBAKER, Carroll\n\nBorn: Carroll Ann Beaulieu on March 4, 1949 in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia.\n\nCarroll Baker, Canada’s Queen Of Country Music, grew up in a musical household in Port Medway, Nova Scotia where her father Gordon Baker, was a country fiddler. Carroll quickly learned to sing and play guitar, and she would move to Toronto, Ontario when she was 16. By the age of 19 she was singing for a bar band around Oakville, Ontario. She then graduated to country fairs and jamborees throughout Southern Ontario. Baker would sign her first record deal with Columbia Records in 1970, and released “Mem’ries Of Home” that year. Several more singles followed in 1971 with Baker’s career not really progressing as she hoped. She would move to Don Grashey’s Gaiety label which she remained with the label until 1976. Grashey had become her manager and negotiated a bigger profile deal for her with RCA Records – whom she remained with through the remainder of the 1970s and early 1980s. In 1975 she released a cover of Conway Twitty’s “I’ve Never Been This Far Before” which kickstarted her rise to fame. This was capped by an appearance on the 1976 JUNO Awards telecast. After parting ways with manager Don Grashey in 1984, Baker took up the offer by fellow performer, and friend, Roger Whittaker to join his record label, Tembo. Though she did tour concert hall, nightclub, and conventions in Canada and the UK, TV seemed to be suited to her personality, and musical stylings. She appeared on CBC-TV’s ‘Superspecials’ in both 1978, and 1979. That was followed by her own 1983 CBC summer series ‘The Carroll Baker Jamboree’. Baker would also make frequent guest appearances on ‘The Tommy Hunter Show.’ She even travelled stateside to appear on such American music shows as ‘Nashville Now’ and guest appearance on The Nashville Network (TNN). Baker racked up a litany of JUNO Award nominations from 1974 through 1992 in the Country Female Vocalist category – winning the title in 1977, 1978, and 1979 respectively. She also took home trophies from the Big Country Awards with ‘Best Album’ (for the RCA released ‘Carroll Baker’ album) in 1976, and ‘Top Female Singer’ from 1976 to 1978, 1980, 1981, and 1987 respectively. Carroll Baker was also named ‘Entertainer Of The Year’ in 1979, while taking home ‘Country Artist Of The Year’ in 1980. She would also win CCMA Awards for ‘Female Vocalist Of The Year’ in 1982 and 1985, as well as ‘Top-Selling Album’ in 1986 for ‘Hymns of Gold,’ and finally ‘Best-Selling Albumin in 1990 for ‘Christmas Carroll.’ In the 1990s she slowed her hectic work schedule down, and starred in the BBS TV special ‘Carroll Baker’s Country Classics.’ In 1992, Carroll Baker was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1992. A lifetime achievement award from the Nova Scotia Country Music Association followed in 1997. She has also received the C.F. Martin Humanitarian Award. In 2010, Carroll Baker became a Member of the Order of Canada.\n\nSingles\n\n1970 Mem’ries Of Home/Just Out Of My Reach (Columbia) C4-2959\n\n1971 Love Now And Pay Later/We Both Can Blame The Wine

At 20 years old he joined Alexis Korner’s Blues Incorporated as their lead singer in 1962 and appeared on one album entitled ‘R & B at the Marquee’ that year before moving on. The album is considered to be the first of its kind in England and is said to have inspired everyone from Mick Jagger to Keith Richards to Rod Stewart to Eric Clapton. Baldry would soon be signed to United Artists in 1964 and released the ‘Long John’s Blues’ album. He was then invited by the Beatles to perform “I Got My Mojo Workin’” on their world television debut broadcast ‘Around the World with The Beatles’ that year. He then joined Bluesology in Middlesex, England featuring a young piano player named Reginald Dwight (the future Sir Elton John) in 1965 where he recorded one single with them for Fontana called “Come Back, Baby” b/w “Time’s Getting Tougher than Tough”. From there he left to form his own group called Steampacket with Brian Auger later in 1965. The group also featured vocalists Rod Stewart and Julie Driscoll. But the group split up by 1966 with Baldry recording his second solo album for United Artists. Soon he would head to Pye Records for two albums and his first charting hit “Let the Heartaches Begin”. In early 1970 he tried his hand with another band called The Hoochie Coo Men who released one album for the Hallmark label before Baldry was scooped up by Warner Bros. The label was determined to break him internationally especially stateside and they released a new recording of “Let the Heartache Begin” in late 1970. But it was 1971’s “Don’t Try to Lay No Boogie-Woogie On the King of Rock and Roll” that give him his first real taste of international success and his biggest selling album ‘It Ain’t Easy’ – an album produced by Elton John and Rod Stewart. The trio would re-team for 1972’s ‘Everything Stops For Tea’ and featured a Baldry/Rod Stewart duet on the single “Mother Ain’t Dead.” He moved to Graff Management’s GM Record label in England bu they were unable to continue the push into North America. This led to signing on with Neil Bogart’s fledgling Casablanca Records where Baldry finally found popularity in North America on his successful ‘Good To Be Alive’ album – which GM had initially released in 1973 – but re-released on the back of his Casablanca debut in 1975 entitled ‘Welcome to Club Casablanca’. However, the label’s direction changed to disco and Baldry found his blues being watered down by dance grooves. By the mid-70’s Baldry had moved to Vancouver, British Columbia teaming up with Kathi McDonald (former member of The Unusuals), performing as a middle of the road music duo. A move to Capitol in 1979 led to three successful albums with hit versions of “Come and Get Your Love” and “You’ve Lost That Loving Feeling” with McDonald. A new west coast label Music Line took Baldry on next and his ‘Silent Treatment’ album in 1986 spawned a minor radio hit revival of the Walker Brothers’ “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore”. Eager to get back to his traditional blues roots Stony Plain Records chief Holger Peterson encouraged Baldry to come over to the label in the ‘90s and follow his muse. Half a dozen albums followed including a live set as The Long John Baldry Trio in 2000 recorded at the Downtown Blues Club in Hamburg, Germany and the Tom Lavin (Powder Blues) produced solo disc ‘It Still Ain’t Easy’. Baldry died on July 21, 2005. with notes from Paul Myers.\n\nSingles\n\n1966 I’m On To You Baby/Goodbye Baby (United Artists) 1078\n\n1967 Cuckoo [4 song EP] (United Artists – France) 36-108\n\n1967 Cuckoo/Bring My Baby Back To Me (Ascot – UK) 2229\n\n1967 It’s Too Late Now/The Long and Lonely Night (Pye – France) PV-15039\n\n1967 Let the Heartaches Begin/ Annabella (Who Flies To Me When She’s Lonely) (Pye – UK) 7N-17385\n\n1968 Underneath The Sun In Mexico/We’re Together (Pye – UK) 7N-17563\n\n1968 Wise To Know The Ways Of The World/When The Sun Comes Shining Through (Pye – UK) 7N-17593\n\n1969 Wait For Me/Don’t Pity Me (Pye – UK) 7N-17815\n\n1969 Setting Fire To The Tail of a Fox/Well I Did (Pye – UK) 7N-17921\n\n1970 Let the Heartaches Begin/Hey Lord You Made The Night Too Long (Warner Bros.) 7098\n\n1970 Since I Lost You Baby/Holdback the Daybreak (Warner Bros.) 7184\n\n1971 Don’t Try To Lay No Boogie-Woogie On The King Of Rock And Roll/Mr. Rubin (Warner Bros.) 7506\n\n1972 Mother Ain’t Dead/You Can’t Judge A Book By The Cover (Warner Bros.) 7617\n\n1973 She/Song for Martin Luthor King (GM – UK) GM-5005\n\n1973 Let Me Pass/Let’s Go (GM – UK) GM-5018\n\n1975 Let Me Pass/High & Low (Casablanca) NB-600X\n\n1977 This Boy’s In Love/Song for Martin Luther King (GM – UK) GMS-9043\n\n1977 On Broadway/(Instrumental) (GM – UK) GMS-9045\n\n1979 Come And Get Your Love/[same] (Capitol) 72808\n\n1979 You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling/Baldry’s Out (Capitol) 72805\n\n1979 A Thrill’s a Thrill/Find You (Capitol) 72815\n\n1979 Any Day Now/Work For Me (Capitol) 72841\n\n1980 I Want You, I Love You/Walk Me Out In the Morning Dew (EMI America – US) 686329\n\n1982 Too Late For Crying/25 Years Of Pain (Capitol) 72874\n\n1982 Stay The Way You Are/Midnight Show (Capitol) 72878\n\n1986 Silent Treatment/Our Love Is In Limbo (Music Line) MLS-002\n\n1986 Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore/Carnival (Music Line) MLS-003\n\n1986 This Is Japan/When The World Doesn’t Love You (Music Line) MLS-005\n\nwith BLUESOLOGY\n\n1965 Come Back, Baby/Time’s Getting Tougher Than Tough (Fontana) TF-594\n\nAlbums\n\n1964 Long John’s Blues (United Artists) ULP-1081\n\n1966 Looking At Long John (United Artists) UAS-9013\n\n1968 Let The Heartaches Begin (Pye) NPL-18208\n\n1969 Wait For Me (Pye) NSPL-18366\n\n1971 It Ain’t Easy (Warner Bros.)

In the 21st century, Ballantyne has been very active, leading a Manhattan-based and critically-acclaimed quartet featuring bassist Boris Kozlov, drummer Jeff Hirshfield and saxophonist/bass clarinetist Douglas Yates. The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle stated in a recent review that the quartet’s performance at the Rochester Jazz Festival was “the best concert of the day”.

Identified as Randall AldonWulff, the musician’s relatives were estranged but have revealed that Wulff was a stockbroker from Calgary who made enough money to dabble in his musical passion. He relocated in the 1980s to Hollywood where he recorded his debut. The photographer who took the cover photo, Ed Colver, was conned out of his $250 fee for the photos while Wulff ran to Las Vegas and later Hawaii never to be seen again. With the internet abuzz about this mystery artist a search by collectors has unearthed a second album, ‘Romantic Times’ under the name Lewis Baloue, recorded at Thunder Studios back in Calgary and released in 1985. Light In the Attic has also traced a studio where material was recorded under the name R.J. Duke in the 1990s. It is suspected that there maybe more albums under unrelated pseudonyms. Wulff has not come forward to clear up this mystery. with notes from Mike Bell.\n\nAlbums\n\nas LEWIS\n\n1983 L’Amour (R.A.W. – US) RAW-1001\n\nas LEWIS BALOUE\n\n1985 Romantic Times (R.A.W. – US) RAW-1002\n\nBALTHAZAR\n\nAlexis Cochard (guitar) / Balthazar Boudreau (guitar, bass, vocals) / Jean Gravel-Lortie (drums, vocals) / Manon Chaput (bass, tambourine, vocals) / Vladimir Garand (guitar, bass, vocals) / François Laliberté (guitar) / Hakim Hamadouche (mandolin) / Charles Imbeau (trumpet)\n\nBand from Montréal, Québec fronted by Balthazar Boudreau.\n\nAlbums\n\n1997 Balthazar (Balthazar) [no cat.#]\n\n1997 Ça M’Enrage (Note Studio Inc.)

She played piano and was enrolled in a Royal Academy of Dance program until popular music caught her ear and she formed her first band. Following high school she went to George Brown College and earned a diploma in Theatre Arts. Next, Elizabeth auditioned and was accepted into the Humber College jazz music program. It was at this point she connected with moog player Angel Lopez and together they formed minimalist punk duo Bambi. A cover version of David Essex’s “Rock On” became the title track to their 1986 seven song independent debut. The act made a big splash on CFNY-FM and MuchMusic which propelled off stage sales (and the few local retail outlets such as Sam the Record Man who supported indie product) to the neighbourhood of 5,000 units. The sales figures alone attracted the attention of A & M Records who offered her a record deal. It was a new venture for her and a new name was chosen to represent the next chapter in her career. Margaret Elizabeth soon became hard rock artist Betty Moon. She now resides in California.

Tired of getting nowhere in the Canadian music scene he headed to England and began networking and shopping his tunes. Through a series of 7” and 12” singles on the label Product Inc. in the UK, he eventually caught the attention of Blanco Y Negro Records who signed him in 1987 to a distribution deal with Warner Music. The self-titled debut album received rave reviews with its quirky Love & Rockets – meets – T.Rex minimalism. The album led to the 12” EP “Is…” on Rough Trade Records stateside. Some success with song placement on shows used by MTV has kept Fielden busy – including a 2007 CD shout out to fans called ‘I’m Alive’. Fielden has lived in South Central Los Angeles for the better part of a decade. Many Bambi Slam songs were used as replacement incidental music when the TV show ‘Meet The Osbournes’ was put into syndication as the cost of Ozzy Osbourne’s original material was too expensive.\n\nSingles\n\n1987 Bamp-Bamp/Hit Me With Your Hairbrush [7” & 12”] (Product Inc. – UK)\n\nPROD-2.7/PROD-2.12\n\n1987 Happy Birthday (Yet Another)/Fun & Roses (Product Inc. – UK) 7PROD-13\n\n1988 Don’t It Make You Feel… (Product Inc. – UK) 12PROD-08\n\nAlbums\n\n1987 The Bambi Slam (Blanco Y Negro/Warner UK) 25852\n\n1987 Is..

Drachenberg [aka Max Styles] (drums)\n\nBamboo was formed in late 1982. Songwriter Alex Stangl teamed up with singer Mike Langford (Heat Exchange, Wireless), another Peterborough native. The goal was to create a band, with a focus on “danceable pop & rock”, so that they would have an easy time getting gigs around the Peterborough area in the local taverns. They did play a lot of cover songs initially, but soon their repertoire included several original songs. In mid-1983, Bamboo recorded a three song demo at Quest Studio in Oshawa, Ontario. After much consideration, Mike and Alex disbanded the original lineup of the band, though oddly enough, they released an independent 45 rpm single, “Come Day O’ Night Eh!” b/w “In Your Plans”. The B-side from the single charted in the Top 10 on CKPT Radio thanks, in great part, to the efforts of music director Dan Gall. This created a lot of buzz and interest from the major record labels in Toronto. Mike and Alex decided to resurrect the band with a new lineup, which included JC Smith (keyboards, bass) and Greg Heard (drums). After playing a series of showcase dates and recording a 4 song demo with producer Brian Ainsworth, they signed a production/publishing deal with ATV Music and eventually landed a recording contract with Capitol/EMI of Canada in 1984. The album ‘Stop All Distractions’ was recorded between the fall of 1984 and early 1985 and was released in June 1985 on Capitol/EMI Canada. The album’s line-up consisted of Mike Langford, Alex Stangle, Phil Poppa (saxophone), Robert Steele (keyboards), Max E. Drachenberg aka Max Styles of The Kings (drums), and bassist Ken “Spider” Sinnaeve (Streetheart, Tom Cochrane). The single from the album was “Come Day O’ Night Eh!” featuring the non-album B-side “Laughing When We’re Young”. It had a short shelf life on the Top 100 Chart in Canada, peaking at No.91. The video for the single received a bit of airplay on Canada’s music video channel MuchMusic, but the album stiffed after generally receiving poor reviews. A second single, “Miles In My Hand” — featuring the non-album B-side “Nothing Left To Say” — was released in the summer of 1985, but there was very little excitement or enthusiasm for the band. One of the major problems was the turnover rate of their membership making it extremely difficult to maintain any kind of momentum. After Bamboo played their last gig in September 1985 at The Diamond Club in Toronto, Ontario, (which included at jam session with Supertramp) they recorded another two-song demo in January 1986 but these songs were rejected by Capitol Records. Mike and Alex folded the project and headed back to Peterborough. Mike and Alex still record together occasionally. “Come Day O’ Night Eh!” was released again in 1999 as part of a compilation CD series by Capitol/EMI Canada titled ‘Pure Canadian – Retro 80s’. with notes from Alex Stangl.\n\nSingles\n\n1983 Come Day O’ Night Eh!/In Your Plans (independent) BAM-01\n\n1985 Come Day O’ Night Eh!/Laughing When We’re Young (Capitol/EMI) 72967\n\n1985 Come Day O’ Night Eh!

Levon Helm was raised in Marvell, Arkansas. All five had started playing young and were influenced by the sounds of the American south. Helm had been guitarist in the Jungle Bush Beaters before hooking up with Ronnie Hawkins, Jimmy Ray, “Luke” Paulman and Willard “Pop” Jones. It was during this period that Helm began playing drums. Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks worked their way up to Canada a few times before Hawkins decided to make their home in 1958. As various members of The Hawks left due to homesickness, the individuals who would one day become The Band began to join. Robbie Robertson (Robbie And The Robots, Little Caesar And The Consuls) joined early in 1960, initially on bass but was groomed for Fred Carter Jr.’s guitar spot as Carter had decided he too was going to leave. Rick Danko, on the other hand, had been playing guitar in various Simcoe area acts since the age of 12 and saw Hawkins and band in 1960. Danko begged himself an opening slot during Hawkins’ return the following spring. This led to his enrolment as rhythm guitarist and then moving to bass after the departure of Rebel Paine. Richard Manuel (ex-Rockin’ Revols) joined later in the summer of 1961 as pianist and vocalist. The final recruit was Garth Hudson, during Christmas 1961, on piano and sax whose main claim to fame prior to joining the Hawks was as leader of Paul London And The Kapers. The members of The Hawks considered Hudson a career professional and the single most important addition to the group – he joined under the condition that he be paid for his performance time and as teacher for the other members of The Hawks. Ronnie Hawkins released 9 singles and several LPs from 1959 to 1963. Helm is on all of them while Robertson and Danko play on the last three singles, Manuel on the last two, and Hudson on the last. The five future members of The Band and Jerry Penfound (saxophone) plus singer Bruce Bruno left Hawkins early in 1964 because they were dissatisfied with the money being paid. They started out as the Levon Helm Sextet but soon switched to Levon And The Hawks and for a year and a half made their way through the American mid-West and Mississippi regions playing frat houses, college gigs and redneck bars. As the Canadian Squires they recorded “Leave Me Alone” and “Uh-Uh-Uh”, produced by Henry Glover for the New York-based Ware label in 1964. A second single, under the Levon And The Hawks banner was “The Stones I Throw” and “He Don’t Love You (And He’ll Break Your Heart)” for Atco, in the summer of 1965. By this time both Bruno and Penfound had left the fold. During this period, a secretary from Toronto named Mary Martin, who was working for Bob Dylan’s manager Albert Grossman, suggested to Dylan that the Hawks should be is backing band on his coming controversial ‘electric’ tour (Dylan had been playing only acoustic folk up to that point). Martin also worked for the Hawks’ and could introduce the two talents. While playing a four-month stand in Somers Point, New Jersey, Dylan saw them and hired Robertson first for two gigs, in late August at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium in New York and the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. Robertson was unimpressed with Dylan’s choice of drummer and suggested his old team mate Helm whom Dylan hired for the second show. So Robertson, Helm, bassist Harvey Brooks and keyboardist Al Kooper gritted their teeth and accompanied Dylan on his next set of gigs to a wall of boos and jeering from folk purists who considered Dylan a sell-out. Dylan wanted Robertson and Helm to stay on for the remainder of an American tour and possibly Australia and Europe. The duo felt it would only work if they were a cohesive unit…and to do this they needed The Hawks. Following rehearsal in Toronto in September 1965, Bob Dylan and The Band took to the road. The quintet relocated to New York, where they could fly out on Dylan’s private plane, play several gigs a week to booing audiences (Dylan wasn’t winning any friends with his conversion to electric folk). Helm soon became discouraged and returned to his native south. Meanwhile, the Dylan experience was captured in a final show at London’s Royal Albert Hall for a future live LP by Columbia Records in May 1966. Following the tour Dylan ensconced himself in Woodstock, New York, to edit the film footage from the European leg of the tour. The documentary, ‘Eat the Document’ needed plenty of work and The Band was put on a weekly retainer where they began commuting regularly to Woodstock to help Dylan on the film. On the property there was a large pink house (affectionately called ‘Big Pink’) which gave The Band a place to retreat, write songs and jam with Dylan and as a band. By 1967 they were recording some of the sessions in the basement eventually resulting in Dylan’s ‘Basement Tapes’ album which was officially released in 1975 (thought bootlegs of the remaining unreleased material still make the rounds today). Before recording an official release could commence two elements needed to be in place. Levon Helm needed to be brought back which Danko managed to do by cutting him for a share of a record label advance. Secondly, they needed management and Dylan’s manager Albert Grossman fit the bill. He shopped some mediocre demos to Warner Bros but president Mo Ostin was unavailable and Grossman wanted The Band signed immediately so he went to Capitol Records who signed the act, as The Crackers, to a record deal. The same week Helm returned, the Band met producer John Simon through filmmaker Howard Alk. ‘Music From Big Pink’ was recorded in two separate locations — New York for the initial bedtracks and then in Los Angeles for completion. Upon release in 1968 ‘Music from Big Pink’ was a slow mover and the ambiguity of the name The Band only added to the confusion of the Dylan painting on the cover in place of an official band photo. The mystery of the band was exploited in the press and a devastating car accident for Danko made interviews with the band impossible until 1969. By this time they were already in California recording their eponymous follow-up. “Up On Cripple Creek” was their first and only Top 30 single, peaking at No.25 in late 1969. The album also featured FM radio staples such as “Rag Mama Rag” and “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down” which went to No.3 on the Billboard charts for Joan Baez in 1971. ‘The Band’ LP was very successful, peaking at No.9 on Billboard’s LP charts, and they had started gigging regularly for the first time since 1966, playing both Woodstock and the Isle of Wight festivals (the latter with Dylan). The press hailed them as nothing short of the Second Coming. The group found that people started treating them differently and as result it had some slow, long reaching effect on each of the members. With Robbie Robertson doing the lion’s share of the writing and having all the praise heaped upon him, Richard Manuel retreated into his keyboards and all but stopped writing. For their next LP, ‘Stage Fright’, The Band returned to Woodstock with the hopes of recording live at the Woodstock Playhouse. The Woodstock Town Council was afraid the town would be overrun by hippies from New York as had happened at Max Yeager’s farm in the Summer of Love for The Woodstock Festival in 1969. Instead, the band brought in producer and Woodstock resident Todd Rundgren for a live-off-the-floor recording. The sessions were completed in two weeks having done pre-production ahead of time in anticipation of a live recording. Producer Glyn Johns also helped in the remixing stage and both Rundgren and John mixes appeared on the final release. The album was launched in September 1970 and featured perennial favourites such as “The Shape I’m In” and “Stage Fright” which would become staples in The Band’s live set until their demise. With “Stage Fright” put to bed, The Band spent the next year on road after which they returned once more to Woodstock to begin working on their fourth album, ‘Cahoots’, which was recorded at Albert Grossman’ Bearsville Studios, and released in October 1971. The album featured another Band favourite, “Life Is a Carnival”, which was given the New Orleans sleaze via Allan Toussaint. “4% Pantomime” also saw the guest appearance by co-writer Van Morrison. With Toussaint on board for “Life Is A Carnival”, they asked him to write arrangements for much of their repertoire, for three performances at the Academy of Music in New York, culminating New Year’s eve 1971 with a rare guest appearance by Bob Dylan. The three shows were recorded for the live double album ‘Rock of Ages’ in 1972. The album produced The Band’s second hit single, “Don’t Do It”, which went to No.34 on Billboard in 1972. Both ‘Stage Fright’ and ‘Cahoots’ were not critically well received and the Band was worn down. Following the final show on New Years Eve the band stopped playing live until their re-emergence 18 months later at the Watkins Glen Festival with the Allman Brothers and The Grateful Dead. The time between saw The Band coasting with ‘Rock Of Ages’ in the fall of 1972, an album of oldies, ‘Moondog Matinee’, in 1973, and the Bob Dylan/Band tour album from shows in early 1974 called ‘Before The Flood’ following their appearance on his studio album that same year called ‘Planet Waves’. In 1975 they picked up their boot heals and decided to record a new studio album of original material, ‘Northern Lights – Southern Cross’. Throughout 1976 Capitol released singles from the album getting major airplay for the first time in the Band’s history. An outtake from the album, “Twilight”, would appear on the year-end compilation ‘The Best of The Band’. Unhappy with Capitol Records and hanging on a multi-million dollar deal from Warner Brothers, the group had a contractual obligation to deliver one more record to Capitol before they could leave the label. They had also decided to stop touring and following their 1976 summer they announced one last blow-out gig to be held Thanksgiving day at Winterland in San Francisco, the (home of their earliest gigs in 1969). The guest list would include a who’s who of the music world: Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, Paul Butterfield, Bobby Charles, Dr. John, Ringo Starr, Ronnie Hawkins and Neil Diamond. A film, directed by Martin Scorsese, and a triple album called ‘The Last Waltz’ which was eventually released by Warner Brothers in April 1978. However, this was not The Band’s contractual obligation to Capitol. The 1977 album ‘Islands’ filled that bill instead. Merely a patch-work of leftover song pieces, the Band distanced itself from the album and did not promote it. Capitol tried to salvage the release by issuing the old chestnut “Georgia on My Mind”. The Band’s promise of renewed recording efforts on Warner Brothers went unanswered as the members drifted from months to years and eventually disbanded. The members all went on to release solo albums: Rick Danko released a self-titled LP on in 1977; Levon Helm, teamed up with the RCO All-Stars (featuring such luminaries as Paul Butterfield and Booker T.). Their only album was released in 1977. Helm released three more solo albums none of which charted. The Band reunited briefly in 1978 (without Robbie Robertson) at the Roxy in LA. It began as a Danko gig and ended with 4 of the 5 original members on stage. Interim gatherings of several members at a time led to the 1983 reformation of The Band – once again without Robertson. Robertson has maintained a path as a solo artist recording soundtracks for such movies as ‘The King of Comedy’ and ‘The Colour of Money’ plus his own solo albums. To augment the talent gap left by Robertson, The Band recruited members of the Cate Brothers Band. Later guitarist Jim Weider joined after the departure of the Cates. Following touring with the reunited Band for three years, Manuel was found hanged in a Florida motel room on March 4, 1986. The remaining members of The Band (Danko, Helm and Hudson) still performed together including prominent shows like Woodstock II, the Bob Dylan jubilee, and a European tour in 1994. They also returned to their old label and released the critically acclaimed ‘Jericho’ in 1993. The Band was the first Canadian act nominated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994; Levon Helm died from an extended battle with throat cancer on April 19, 2012; Robbie Robertson passed away after a long illness at the age of 80 on August 9, 2023. with notes from Jan Høiberg, and Rob Bowman.
