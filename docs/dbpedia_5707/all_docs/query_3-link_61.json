Below please find a sample list of just some of the professional musicians we have worked with in the past. We'll update the list on an ongoing basis.\n\nFeatured Musicians\n\nAntoine Gratton - Singer/Songwriter\n\nMat Zimbel - Band Leader/Percussionist\n\nTerry Brown - Producer of Rush, Max Webster, Gowan & more.\n\nJim McCarty - The Yardbirds\n\nRobin Le Mesurier - Rod Stewart\n\nRik Emmett - Triumph, Solo Artist\n\nDan Clancy - Lighthouse\n\nBy Instrument GUITAR\n\nDavid Barrett\n\nDavid Baxter\n\nMike Bowell\n\nBruce Dies\n\nRik Emmett\n\nGreigg Fraser\n\nRobin Le Mesurier\n\nDoug Moore\n\nJoey Serlin\n\nSteve Shelski\n\nMichael Zweig\n\nDRUMS\n\nDave Betts\n\nJim McCarty\n\nChris McNeill\n\nTopher Stott\n\nKEYBOARDS\n\nSteve Koven\n\nDon Paulton\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nTerry Brown\n\nGarth Richardson\n\nBASS\n\nTimothy Cameron\n\nBruce Gordon\n\nJeff Jones\n\nTom Lewis\n\nNikku Nayar\n\nJohn Switzer\n\nVOCALS\n\nDan Clancy\n\nRique Franks\n\nJim Gillard\n\nWendy Lands\n\nBlair Packham\n\nMichael White\n\nProduction\n\nTerry Brown\n\nThe League Of Rock Studio is proud to announce the involvement of legend Terry Brown (producer of Rush; Blue Rodeo; Gowan and many more) with the League Of Rock. Terry is a wonderful guy with an incredible history and is one of the newest coaches to sign on with the League Of Rock.\n\nTerry began his career as an assistant engineer (tea boy) at Olympic Studios in 1960s swingin London. Terry says During my apprenticeship there I was a part of the team that recorded hits for The Troggs, The Moody Blues, Marianne Faithful, Spencer Davis Group, Donovan, Barbra Streisand and many more.\n\nSoon Terry moved into actual engineering, tackling some rock projects, as Terry says, one of the first being the recording and mixing of The Whos Substitute under the direction of Mr. Peter Townsend. Terry also engineered such classics as Homburg by Procol Harum, and Mellow Yellow by Donovan. It wasnt long before a connection was established overseas, through the unlikely conduit of a series of beer commercials for Canadian radio.\n\nWorking in London at Morgan Studios, Terry met Torontonian ad-music-makers Mort Ross and Doug Riley; ultimately, this work led to Terry plotting to open a recording facility and record label in Toronto by the fall of 1969. (In the meantime, Terry mixed another landmark recording: Joe Cockers With A Little Help From My Friends).\n\nArriving in Canada, Terry engineered recordings for Motherlode, Dr. Music, April Wine, The Stampeders, Michel Pagliaro, Moe Koffman (the theme for As it Happens is still heard on CBC Radio One every weeknight). About the 1970s, Terry continues, It was then that I started to take the production aspect of things more seriously and started a long relationship with Rush, then cut three albums with Klaatu and as many with Max Webster. The 80s saw a Billboard #1 with I Just Died In Your Arms, the band Toronto went gold with Head On, Tom Sawyer from Moving Pictures pushed Rush over the edge and Try was the big hit for Blue Rodeos Outskirts CD. Busy doing great work to this day, Terry continues to engineer and produce music with the same passion and enthusiasm that drew him to music in the first place.\n\nGarth \"GGGarth\" Richardson\n\nGarth \"GGGarth\" Richardson is a Canadian music producer and engineer. He is the son of renowned Canadian music producer Jack Richardson (whose credits include Alice Cooper, The Guess Who, Badfinger and Poco). Jack was a pioneer of the music recording industry in the 60's and 70's. Garth Richardson has racked up hits engineering such acts as The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nickelback and Motley Crüe, and producing Rage Against the Machine, Mudvayne and The Melvins. [1] Richardson also recently launched the Nimbus School of Recording Arts in Vancouver, British Columbia, with famed producer Bob Ezrin. Richardson has the nickname 'GGGarth' because he has a slight Stutter.\n\nBelow are some of the artists and records Richardson has been involved with: Biffy Clyro  Puzzle, Only Revolutions, Hedley - Hedley, Melvins, Nickelback, Rage Against the Machine - Rage Against the Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers - Mother's Milk, Rise Against - Siren Song of the Counter Culture, Skunk Anansie - Stoosh, Testament - Low, Ugly Kid Joe.\n\nVocals\n\nDan Clancy\n\nDan is the lead singer of 4-time Juno award winning Canadian super- group \"LIGHTHOUSE\".

Blair wrote five hits for the band between 1987 and 1991, including \"Last of the Red Hot Fools\" and \"'Til the Fever Breaks\". Currently, Blair has a flourishing career creating music for TV and film, but songwriting and record production remain passionate pursuits, as he works with artists both established--like the legendary Andy Kim or Ron Sexsmith---or emerging.\n\nRique Franks\n\nBest known for her duets with Dan Hill including, \"In Your Eyes\", \"Hold Me Now\", the duet version of \"Sometimes When We Touch\" and the remake of \"Can't We Try\", Rique Franks has recorded with, toured with or performed with many Canadian and international recording stars such as Alexander O'Neal, Alan Frew and Glass Tiger, Alannah Myles, Susan Aglukark, Bruce Guthro, Glen Lewis, Roch Voisine, Lisa Dalbello, Ronnie Spector (Greenfield), and Lorraine Segato and The Parachute Club, to name a few.\n\nAs a session singer and voice actor, Rique has sung and/or read many memorable commercials for countless products. Currently, Rique can be seen singing as a featured soloist with Jeans 'n Classics and as a guest artist with orchestras across North America performing symphonic rock, pop, latin and jazz. She is also one quarter of \"Lushus\", a foursome of women who are all singer/songwriters here in Toronto. When she's not singing, Rique can be heard as the infamous silky on-air voice of Showcase Television or the gravelly voice in the humorous Sponge Towels campaign.\n\nRique has worked as a vocalist on campaigns for: Air Canada, Air Miles, AT&T, Atlas Van Lines, Aquafresh, Bell, Betty Crocker, Blacks, Bounce, Bounty, Budget, Bud Light, Campbell's, Canadian Airlines, CBC, Chrysler, CN Tower, Coke, Colgate, Coppertone, Downy, Dupont, Easy Rock, Eaton's, Eglinton Square, Enbridge, Esso, Excell, Ferrerro Rocher, Folgers, Ford, Glad, Goodwrench, Goodyear, Green Giant, Heineken, Holiday Inn, Home Hardware, Home Outfitters, Hyundai, Ikea, Imperial Oil, Ivory, KFC, Kodak, LCBO, Lever 2000, Lipton, Lotto 649, Maple Leaf, McDonalds, Mennen, Michaels, Miller Light, Milk, Molson, Monsanto, Mr. Clean, Mr. Sub, Nike, Oil of Olay, Ontario Place, Pepsi, Polident, Pontiac, Purina, Purolator, RBC, Revlon, Rogers, Sears, Scotia Bank, Smarties, Sponge Towels, Sugar Crisp, Suzuki, Swiss Chalet, TD Canada Trust, The Bay, Toshiba, Toys R Us, Tropicana, Twix, Windex, Wonderbread, Zellers and others.\n\nJim Gillard\n\nAs a vocalist, Jim has shared the stage with everyone from Letterman's Paul Schaffer to David Foster and The Toronto Symphony Orchestra. On national television for five seasons, Jim sang background vocals for such notable talent as: Vince Gill, Glen Campbell, kd Lang, The Judds, Leroy Parnell, Tommy Hunter...you get the picture!\n\nProducer, Arranger, Musical Director, Drummer and Co-writer for recording artist Wendy Lands, who's EMI CD, \"Angels & Ordinary Men\" was nominated for a Juno Award, (Canadian Grammy) and two Canadian Radio Awards. Signed to Warner/Chappell as a staff writer, Jim has written with some of L.A.'s finest songwriters including: Paul Williams, Robbie Nevil, Melissa Manchester and Wendy Lands.\n\nJim has played drums and sang with his own jazz trio, Jim Gillard's Swinging Moods at some of L.A.'s hippest nightspots including The Belmont and The Balboa Bay Club. He's broken eighty on more than one occasion and has appeared on various episodes of the classic sketch comedy show, SCTV. T.V. JINGLES Include: Windex, Home Hardware, Toys Are Us, Ocean Spray Cranberry Cocktail, Amstel Beer, Stars On Ice and Crayola Crayons\n\nWendy Lands\n\nThe San Diego Union Tribune raves, \"Lands sings as if she were born to you feel every moment, she's like a musician playing her instrument and she doesn't need to sing loudly to impress you.\"\n\nVoice Quebec says, \"The songs appear to float in a lightness inhabited by her subtle and caressing voice. Lands clearly brings to mind Norah Jones, and at other moments, the clear enchanting tone reminds us of Sade. Less exotic but no less bewitching just imagine an acoustic Diana Krall.\"\n\nHer unique, compelling voice and songs have taken her from co-writing and co-producing her own Juno nominated debut CD, entitled Angels and Ordinary Men, which Billboard Magazine described as \"one of the most impressive Canadian recordings in years\" to hitting the number 1 spot on The Mix's Canadian Count Down, to songwriting collaborations with everyone from Melissa Manchester to Paul Williams to The Jacksons.\n\nIn 2003, Rickie Lee Jones//Lyle Lovette bass player/producer John Leftwich hand picked Wendy to record with some of L.A.'s greatest players, in sessions that would later become the CD entitled, Wendy Lands Sings The Music Of The Pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, the vocal soundtrack to the Oscar winning film, The Pianist. The project was executive produced by Andrej Szpilman, Wladyslaw Szpilman's (subject of the film) son, who set out to make a CD that took his father's original melodies, written over the span of his career from the 30's through the 70's and introduce them to the North American public, using brand new English lyrics, as well as bringing them into the new mellenium with modern, jazz influenced arrangements and production.\n\nAccording to Canada's, The Record, \"The album's songs are smooth, elegant, striking and memorable. The kind that can send chills up your spine Wendy Lands puts her exquisite voice to these striking arrangements what more could you ask?\"\n\nWendy is currently one of the most in-demand voice actors in the country, voicing hundreds of spots for everything from CTV to Mattel to Homesense.\n\nMichael White\n\nWhile on tour in 1983, Robert Plant met with Michael and told him to contact Atlantic Records. This resulted in Michael signing a $350,000 record contract with the label and the release of his self-titled debut album on Atlantic in 1987. Since then Michael has recorded two more CD's for Griffin Music. One in 1990 titled \"Michael White/The White\" and a 1994 release \"Michael White Plays the Music of Led Zeppelin\". All of these albums have received critical acclaim from the press in Europe, the U.S. and Canada, including excellent reviews in The Chicago Tribune, Billboard and Britain's Kerrang magazine.\"\n\nDuring his career that began in 1973, Michael has worked with performers such as Nikki Sixx (Motley Crue), George Lynch (Dokken & Lynch Mob), Randy Piper (W.A.S.P.), Lanny Cordola (Giuffria & House of Lords), and for a short time in 1987 the German band 'Accept'. Coincidentally, in the Motley Crue biography \"The Dirt\", Nikki Sixx credits Michael as having been the original singer in the legendary heavy metal band! Also, a little known fact is that in 1975 Van Halen was a warm-up band for Michael and George's band \"The Boyz\" as credited by Gene Simmons in his book 'Kiss & Makeup'. Michael has worked in recording studios around the world with producer/engineers such as Andy Johns (Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones & Van Halen), Mack (Led Zeppelin, Queen & E.L.O.), and David Glover (Yes & Tom Waits), as well as the band 'Blue Murder' whose members included drummer Carmine Appice (Vanilla fudge & Rod Stewart) and John Sykes (Whitesnake & Thin Lizzy).\n\nGuitar -\n\nDavid Barrett\n\nDavid was introduced to great guitar playing at a very young age through his parents collection of old lps ranging from Glen Campbell to Eddie Arnold. By the time David was 15 he was working at the local guitar shop, playing concerts at high schools, and doing sessions around Toronto. At this time actor/producer Mike Myers saw a rehearsal of David's first band, Crucial Taunt, and many years later, asked permission to use the original band name for the band in the then upcoming movie, Wayne's World.\n\nAs soon as he left high school, David began touring Canada with various covers bands. David joined Toronto band Rain and later formed his own hard rock group Trouble In Mind, and was signed to EMI Publishing Canada. In the 1990's, David worked with with Mark Holmes of Platinum Blonde recording and producing artists including, Vertigo, no.9 and Amanda Marshall. David recorded and toured extensively with Amanda Marshall and later Platinum Blonde. Some of David's recorded work has included projects with engineers such as Richard Chycki (Aerosmith, Def Leopard, Mick Jagger), producers such as Thom Panuzio (U2, Bruce Springsteen) and guitar greats such as Alex Lifeson (Rush).\n\nRecently David has worked on music for film and television including the Florida based Tube Music Television Network, creating the music for station Id's and promotional spots. In addition, David is director of Special Projects for the Toronto Fingerstyle Guitar Association. Last year he produced a compilation cd for the Association, featuring 12 Toronto based guitar players. David has also produced other Canadian solo guitar players, including 8 string jazz guitarist Jason Crawford. As part of the Classic Albums Live series, David played lead guitar on several shows, including legendary albums by Rush and David Bowie.\n\nDavid has released a series of solo guitar cds ranging from solo acoustic to ambient soundscapes and currently performs solo guitar concerts in Canada and the U.S.\n\nDavid Baxter\n\nDavid Baxter is a veteran musician, songwriter, producer and music publisher. He began his career in 1975 playing guitar with David Wilcox, and has recorded on the Toronto and National scenes with The Sharks, Juno-winner Sherry Kean, Alanis Morissette, Lori Yates, Wild Strawberries, Oh Susanna and others.\n\nHe has authored hundreds of songs, including a #1 in Quebec, and a CMPA song of the year winner.

In 1996 he graduated from York University with an Honours B.F.A. in Music.\n\nHe has played across Canada in a variety of musical settings, including Jazz, Country, Bluegrass and Theatre. In 2001 he performed on singer-songwriter Jenny Whiteley's debut album, for which she received a Juno award in the best solo roots and traditional category.\n\nMike has been teaching the guitar since the age of 16.

Thrilled with the creative process he has an ability to build songs from the ground up thriving in the team environment.\n\nRik Emmett\n\nRik Emmett was a relatively unknown singer/songwriter/guitarist on the local Toronto scene in September of '75 when he joined a newly-formed hard rock trio called Triumph. By '79 three albums had gone gold and platinum in Canada - two of these charted in the States, receiving serious radio airplay. By '81, they were firmly established as one of the premier touring rock acts in North America, with generous FM radio airplay support and heavy rotation on the fledgling MTV cable channel. In the next seven years, the band released ten albums, all of which went gold, with four turning platinum in Canada. In the U.S., two went gold. Emmett's name frequently appeared in guitar magazine polls and he won several prestigious awards, including Best Lead Guitarist nationally in 1981. He left the band to begin his solo career in '88, but was inducted into the Canadian Rock Hall of Fame in '93 as one of the band's original members.\n\nRik's solo career spawned three releases for Duke Street/MCA Records in the early '90's. The first, Absolutely, went gold in 1990, yielding the hits \"Saved by Love\" and \"Big Lie\", two songs that provided a transition from arena rock while maintaining continuity at FM radio. Perhaps a bit more of a surprise was the ballad \"When a Heart Breaks\", which crossed a rock guitar hero over into other radio formats and revealed a more sensitive singer/songwriter persona. \"World of Wonder\" also received substantial airplay and showcased an expanding lyrical and stylistic range. The \"Ipso Facto\" CD followed in '92, offering up the hits \"Out of The Blue\" (a jazzy-bluesy tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughn, Hendrix and Wes Montgomery) and \"Bang On\", a rocking return to one of Rik's personal themes - positive motivation and inspiration. Ipso Facto was a tour-de-force of stylistic versatility, but no surprise to fans who knew the guy who constantly plugged trademark classical guitar pieces or little jazz tunes in between the hard rock anthems, arena blues riffs and progressive flourishes found on past records.\n\nA strong singer/songwriter album called Spiral Notebook followed in '95, which earned notice through airplay of its sensitive balladeer singles \"Let Me Be The One\" and \"The Longing\". In '96, Emmett began testing the courage of his musical convictions with work in his own digital studio and through his own independent record label. Following those instincts paid off artistically. The first release was Ten Invitations from the Mistress of Mr E., beautifully realized original instrumentals of classical nylon-string guitar. Critics and fans were reminded that the 'rock guitar god' was not a one-trick pony. Part two of his guitar trilogy, Swing Shift, took a completely different musical direction, featuring jazz, swing and fusion. Again, the CD was well received and piqued the interest of brand-new fans in growing musical circles. Perhaps more importantly, the spirits of diehard supporters were elevated by witnessing an artistic transformation that defied mainstream classification. Raw Quartet, released in early 1999, became the final CD in the trilogy, displaying Rik's passion and natural affinity for blues. 1999's Live at Berklee (highlights from sold out shows at the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston) was followed by a traditional Spirit of Christmas album, recorded in collaboration with Glass Tiger keyboardist Sam Reid. 2002 brought the release of a \"20th Century Masters\" \"Best of Rik Emmett Collection\" through Universal, followed by another widely-acclaimed instrumental smooth jazz masterpiece CD - Handiwork. In the late summer of 2003, the acoustic singer/songwriter re-emerged with the GOOD FAITH CD, and another new chapter was written in an already storied career.\n\nIn 2005, Rik was honored as Guitarist of the Year at the Canadian Smooth Jazz Awards, and in the summer of 2006, the wide range of Emmett's abilities went on display - from a smooth jazz festival in Canada to a heavy metal festival in Germany: from Artistic Directing a songwriting workshop to hanging & jamming with Alex Lifeson of Rush at the Guitar Workshop Plus: and from five classic rock outdoor shows, to an idyllic afternoon acoustic duo gig at the Chateau-des-Charmes winery in Niagara-on-the-Lake.\n\nA guitar magazine once wrote that Rik Emmett was \"his own worst enemy. He's one of the only guitarists out there who may be too talented for his own damn good\". Partly true, in our celebrity/tabloid/sound bite world: but the comment also recognizes the artist as unique, and offers insight on an 18-year solo career, still going strong, based on being a loyal friend to his gifts instead of a slave to superficial fashion, with luggage to match.\n\nRik has held true to his dreams of the magic power of the music, and he shares that with every audience, of every stripe - every night that he performs.\n\nGreigg Fraser\n\nGreigg's career covers performing, session work, music instruction, producing, arranging, television work and composing. His solo career focuses on original instrumental guitar music. His first album release \"Making Waves\" enjoyed strong support, air play and rave reviews not only on campus, rock and CBC stations across Canada but also in the U.S.A. and Europe.\n\nGreigg's second release\"Tech Noir\" has enjoyed similar success in Europe and the States, with sales through Guitar Nine Records in North Carolina, Red Room Records in Ohio, C&D Services in the UK and repeated airplay on radio stations from Kansas City to Minsk!\n\nGreigg has opened for and performed with artists such as Rik Emmett (Triumph), Rush, Downchild Blues Band, Goddo, Cheryl Rae, Lisa Dal Bello, The Naughty Sweeties, Lawrence Gowan (Styx) and Kim Mitchell. He's been featured many times on CBC Radio, CITY/CHUM and Global TV. He's won the Q107 Home Grown Award, the FM 96 \"On Track Award\" and has received grants, awards and support from FACTOR and SOCAN.\n\nHe's been a featured soloist in Orchestra London's \"Jeans & Classics\" Series, performing works by Steve Howe, Jeff Beck, Chet Atkins and Steve Vai as well as his own compositions. As guitarist and producer Greigg has done session work for such clients as the United Way, the Canadian Cancer Society, FACTOR, Rogers Cable and CHUM Television, and for numerous artists.\n\nRobin Le Mesurier\n\nRobin Le Mesurier is a touring guitarist playing with the legendary Rod Stewart. You can also find him on stage with European singer Johnnie Halliday. When Robins not on the road, he is an in-demand session guitarist.\n\nBorn and raised in the 50s, in London - England, to parents, John Le Mesurier and Hattie Jacques , in the film and TV industry who (for about five minutes) tried to discourage him from having anything to do with the music business or its peripheries. But thankfully were totally supportive when they realized it was a complete waste of time.\n\nDuring the late sixties, he fell for the blues and spent much of his time learning the craft of players like John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck.\n\nAt the of sixteen, he left school, discovered New York and signed his first recording contract with the EMI subsidiary Regal Zonophone. The group was called \"Reign\" and the first album two tracks was written by Keith Relf and Jim McCarty of the Yardbirds : 1970 - Line of Least Resistance / Natural lovin' man It will remain there until 1973. It will become a Womble and will take part in the recording of 4 albums: 1973 - Wombling songs, 1974 - Remember you're a womble, 1974 - Keep on wombling, 1975 - Superwombling\n\nRobin Le Mesurier worked a lot as a session guitarist in England and also in various bands playing up and down the country. In 1976, he signed a publishing agreement with the Billy Gaff/Rod Stewart Compagny, Riva Records, during which time, he co-wrote the music for a spoken word record, \" The Velveteen Rabbit \", narrated by his father, John Le Mesurier.\n\nIn 1977, he found himself playing guitar for \"Air Supply\", on his, and their first tour of the U.S., opening up for Rod Stewart. After which, he was asked to join \"Lion\", an English band on A&M records living in California. \"Lion\" later became \"The Difference\", who gained quite a following in Southern California till he was asked to join the Rod Stewart group in 1980. There he stayed for seven years, touring and recording.

In 1984 he signed to Ready Records under the name Michael Zee, and recorded his first record, an EP, called \"Five-Seven, Maybe Five-Eight\", which spawned the mini-hit \"I've Got News For You\".\n\nThroughout the rest of the 80's, Zweig toured Ontario and Eastern Canada with a band called The Knockouts, a skinny tie, all 60's music band. They also served as backup band for visiting Old-Timers, such as Peter Noone, Del Shannon, Bo Diddley, Lesley Gore, and others. The Knockouts became Seventh Son, and released a self-titled album.

He has also played in the bands Shoot (on lead vocals), Illusion (with three other ex-members of Renaissance), Stairway and Pilgrim.McCarty has also been a member of The British Invasion All-Stars, and his own Jim McCarty Band.\n\nBy now, everyone knows the Yardbirds legend, if not their music; the band graduated three of the great Ph.D.s of rock guitar: Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page. They created hard rock out of standard twelve-bar blues, doubling the tempos and whacking the amps up to ten.\n\nOn the British club scene, the Yardbirds, the Animals, and the Rolling Stones ruled the stages. The Yardbirds expanded the range of the electric guitar, experimenting with feedback, sustain, and fuzztone. They also coined and popularized the rave-up, a kind of free-for-all where you jam long and hard, not as soloists, but in a tandem, until you reach an epiphany about 10 or 20 or 30 minutes later, a shuddering climax of decibels and pure energy, and thenback into the song for one more boom-boom chorus.\n\nThe Yardbirds were the bridge between the tributary white R&B of early-sixties London and the pastures of fuzz-toned psychedelia and power-chorded heavy metal plowed much later in the decade and throughout the seventies. Yes, the Yardbirds laid the groundwork for Rock Guitar As We Know It.\n\nJim McCarty and Chris Dreja reformed the Yardbirds in the 1990s, with John Idan handling bass and lead vocals, and touring regularly since then with a number of guitarists and harmonica players passing through their ranks. In 2003, a new album, Birdland, was released under the Yardbirds name on the Favored Nations label which consisted of a mixture of new material mostly penned by McCarty and re-recordings of some of their greatest hits, with guest appearances by Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Slash, Brian May, Steve Lukather, Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter, John Rzeznik, Martin Ditchum and Simon McCarty. Also, Jeff Beck reunited with his former bandmates on the song \"My Blind Life\".\n\nThe Yardbirds released a live 2007 CD, \"Live At B.B. King Blues Club\" (Favored Nations).\n\nAs a solo artist Jim has released numerous albums and projects including 2002s Two Steps Ahead, and 1994s Out Of The Dark, and has a new album that will be released shortly.\n\nChris McNeill\n\nChris McNeill has earned the kind of reputation and respect that all musicians aspire to.

While playing with Glass Tiger and in Alan Frew's solo band, Chris introduced backing tracks produced in his studio to help with live shows and expand on the sound and style of the band. Alan Few and Chris co-write and co-produce material for up and coming Canadian artists, including up and coming Taylor Jordan.\n\nChris is now known as an emerging new producer, along with his renowned drumming.

Unfortunately, they weren't hiring. Instead, he waited a few years, then began playing in bars and pubs at the age of 17, by which time he was tall enough to convincingly \"exaggerate\" about his age.\n\nSince then, Timothy has played literally thousands of gigs across the province, both as a solo performer and member of countless indie bands, along the way sharing the stage with such diverse luminaries as Ron Sexsmith, Goddo, Platinum Blonde, Handsome Ned, and Brian Byrne, to name just a few.\n\nWithin the past few years, he's released two independent CDs, both of which not only charted on campus radio stations across the country, but also received positive reviews both here and abroad. More recently, Timothy discovered that one of his songs, American Dream, has become part of the curriculum in a high school class in Germany which is studying the recent impact of American culture on the outside world.\n\nHe's also begun the first rough outline of a book detailing his musical adventures, which, thanks to the wealth of material, looks like it might be at least a trilogy... or two.\n\nBruce Gordon - Bass\n\nBruce Gordon was born in London, England to parents of Scottish and German heritage.
