Our dynamic horn section rekindles great melodies from Stevie Wonder to Van Morrison to Wilson Pickett and more, and the rhythm section honours the best of studio musicians, from Motown to Stax Records. Our singer, Gary Diggins, grew up near the Detroit River and brings the spirit of soul music that floated on the Motor City airwaves.\n\nBoomerang is at home on festival stages, in community halls, at private and corporate celebrations, and even at street parties. We know how to transform a big venue into an intimate living room experience!\n\nWebsite: https://www.boomerangband.ca/\n\nInstagram: @boomerangsoulband\n\nBar Stool Confession\n\nBarstool Confessions is a Canadian country/rock band and recording artists from Barrie, Ontario.
