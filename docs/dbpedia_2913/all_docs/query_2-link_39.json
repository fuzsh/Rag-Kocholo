        "text": "Meggitt Electronic Components\n\nMeggitt Electronics is pleased to offer this unique High Power, metal chip resistor for current sensing. It has a special solid metal resistive element. Development of a range of IC's for battery charge management and low voltage power supplies need the TL to satisfy the demand for a low ohmic shunt resistor to act as a current sensor it has particular applications in the automotive industry for sensing in EMU's.\n\nIn 2007 : Endevco Corp., a leader in sensing solutions for demanding vibration, shock, and pressure applications, joined the new Meggitt Sensing Systems (MSS) Division of Meggitt PLC. The division has been formed by merging the Meggitt Aerospace Systems and Meggitt Electronics groups into a single entity that aligns some of the world's most notable companies in the sensing industry with related products, services, and applications.\n\nMeggitt is a company that specializes in engineering solutions, including a wide range of products and components for aerospace, defense, and industrial applications. One of the products they offer is resistors. Meggitt resistors are precision-engineered electronic components designed to control the flow of electric current within a circuit.\n\nIn 2010, the company restructured itself into five new divisions. Meggitt Resistors / Meggitt passive components was acquired by Tyco Electronics, and products formerly branded as Meggitt are now part of TE Connectivity. Tyco Electronics Components Limited designs, manufactures, supplies, and distributes passive electronic components and sensors for the automotive and medical markets. It offers resistive devices, including trimmers, control potentiometers, power resistors, precision resistors, inductors, and switches. The company provides potentiometric devices, such as fuel level sensors for the automotive industry, as well as offers surface mount devices, thermistors and light touch switches, precision networks and precision thin film inductors, and film resistors.\n\nOn March 10, 2011, Tyco Electronics Ltd changed its name to TE Connectivity. TE Connectivity Ltd designs and manufactures connectivity and sensor solutions for a variety of industries including automotive, industrial equipment, data communication systems, aerospace, defense, medical, oil and gas, consumer electronics, energy and subsea communications. The company serves customers in more than 150 countries.\n\nMeggitt resistors:\n\nPrecision and Reliability: Meggitt is known for producing high-quality, precision resistors that are designed to meet the demanding requirements of industries such as aerospace and defense. These industries often require resistors that can withstand extreme conditions, maintain accuracy over a wide range of temperatures, and provide long-term reliability.\n\nApplications: Meggitt resistors are used in various applications, including avionics systems, communication equipment, power management circuits, medical devices, industrial automation, and more. These resistors are often used in circuits where precise control of resistance values is essential for proper functionality and performance.\n\nTypes of Resistors: Meggitt offers a variety of resistor types to suit different applications. This includes standard fixed resistors, precision resistors, power resistors, high-temperature resistors, and specialized resistors for specific industries.\n\nCustomization: Given the specialized nature of many industries that Meggitt serves, they often offer customization options for their resistors. This might include designing resistors with specific resistance values, tolerances, temperature coefficients, and physical form factors to meet the unique needs of a particular application.\n\nExpertise: Meggitt's expertise in engineering and materials science allows them to develop resistors that meet stringent industry standards and performance requirements. They often invest in research and development to create innovative resistor solutions.\n\nGlobal Presence: Meggitt is a global company with a presence in various countries.
