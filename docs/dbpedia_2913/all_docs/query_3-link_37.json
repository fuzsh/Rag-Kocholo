        "text": "The UK public M&A market experienced sustained high levels of activity throughout the summer months, continuing the trends we saw earlier in the year.\n\n11 new firm offers for targets listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange were announced in Q3 (matching the total of 11 firm offers announced during Q1 and Q2 combined).\n\nStrong demand for UK assets was underpinned by confidence in the prospects for an accelerated post-Covid economic recovery as the vaccination programme gathered momentum and the UK economy was reopened. At the same time, diminishing concerns about the longer-term impact of Brexit further supported investorsâ belief in the growth potential of the UK economy. One clear example of the strength of private equity demand for exposure to the UK consumer has been the battle for Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC (Morrisons) (see below), which attracted interest from at least three sponsors.\n\nAttractive equity valuations â especially compared to U.S. multiples â and the continued appeal of sterlingâs relative weakness to the dollar, have also drawn the attention of overseas bidders.\n\nDeal Sizes Increase\n\nThere was a noticeable increase in the number of larger deals, with four firm offers valued at over Â£5bn in Q31 , there having been no deals above this threshold announced in H1. Towards the end of the quarter, Entain PLC announced that it had received a possible Â£16.4bn offer from DraftKings that will be the biggest deal of the year to date if a firm offer materialises.\n\nCleary Gottlieb won the âCorporate Team of the Yearâ award at the 2021 Legal Business Awards for the firm's work advising Euronext on its acquisition of Borsa Italiana from the London Stock Exchange Group.\n\nThis caps a particularly successful last year for the firm in UK M&A where we secured a role on a number of the most significant transactions in the UK market. In addition, we have worked on a number of UK public M&A transactions in the past few years, including some of the most significant and complex transactions:\n\nActing for Cascade on its joint bid (as part of a consortium with Blackstone and GIP) for Signature Aviation, which topped a prior recommended bid from GIP on a standalone basis;\n\nActing for Allied Universal on its successful bid for G4S, which topped a hostile competing bid from GardaWorld;\n\nActing for Ivanhoe Cambridge on its joint bid (as part of a consortium with ICAMAP) for easyHotel;\n\nActing for American Express on the bid by Global Business Travel for Hogg Robinson plc;\n\nActing for Fidessa on the recommended bid for it by Ion, which topped a competing bid from Temenos; and\n\nActing for Loxam on its successful bid for Lavendon, which topped a hostile competing bid from TVH"
