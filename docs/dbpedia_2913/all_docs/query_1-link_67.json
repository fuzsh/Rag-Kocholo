        "text": "BOURNEMOUTH, UNITED KINGDOM-Meggitt PLC, a group of companies engaged in the design and manufacture of components and systems for aerospace, sensing and defense applications, announces the formation of a new Meggitt Sensing Systems division. The division was formed by merging the Meggitt Aerospace Systems and Meggitt Electronics groups into a single entity that aligns companies in the sensing industry with related products, services and applications.\n\nThe new division will be led by Dr. Richard Greaves, a 30-year industry veteran and most recently the managing director of Meggitt Aerospace Systems.\n\n“Meggitt Sensing Systems is a natural and timely evolution of our sensing businesses that blends the unique capabilities and outstanding market positions of our Electronics and Aerospace groups,” says Meggitt PLC CEO Terry Twigger. “By joining forces, they will create the pre-eminent group in this field in the world with manufacturing and engineering capability on three continents, unparalleled technical resources, leading positions in our key markets and a much stronger marketing capability.”<"
