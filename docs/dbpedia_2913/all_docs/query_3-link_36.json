        "text": "The following is to explain your rights and give you the information you are entitled to under the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (‘the Data Protection Legislation’). This notice only refers to your personal data (for example, your name, email address, and anything that could be used to identify you personally) not the content of your response to the consultation.\n\n1. The identity of the data controller and contact details of our Data Protection Officer\n\nThe data controller for your personal data is the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS). You can contact BEIS Data Protection Officer at:\n\nFind out more about the personal information charter.\n\n2. Why we are collecting your personal data\n\nYour personal data is being collected as an essential part of the consultation process, so that we can contact you regarding your response and for statistical purposes such as to ensure individuals cannot complete the consultation more than once.\n\n3. Our legal basis for processing your personal data\n\nThe Data Protection Legislation states that, as a government department, the department may process personal data based on your consent.\n\n4. With whom we will be sharing your personal data\n\nCopies of responses may be published after the consultation closes. If we do so, we will ensure that neither you nor the organisation you represent are identifiable, and any responses used to illustrate findings will be anonymised.\n\nIf you want the information that you provide to be treated as confidential, please be aware that, under the FOIA, there is a statutory Code of Practice with which public authorities must comply and which deals, amongst other things, with obligations of confidence.\n\nIn view of this, it would be helpful if you could explain to us why you regard the information you have provided as confidential. If we receive a request for disclosure of the information, we will take full account of your explanation, but we cannot give an assurance that confidentiality can be maintained in all circumstances. An automatic confidentiality disclaimer generated by your IT system will not, of itself, be regarded as binding on the Department.\n\n5. For how long we will keep your personal data, or criteria used to determine the retention period\n\nYour personal data will be held for one year after the consultation is closed. This is so that the department is able to contact you regarding the result of the consultation following analysis of the responses. Your personal data will be stored in a secure government IT system and will not be sent overseas.\n\n6. Your rights, for example access, rectification, erasure\n\nThe data we are collecting is your personal data, and you have considerable say over what happens to it. You have the right:\n\nto see what data we have about you\n\nto ask us to stop using your data, but keep it on record\n\nto have all or some of your data deleted or corrected, in certain circumstances\n\nto lodge a complaint with the independent Information Commissioner (ICO) if you think we are not handling your data fairly or in accordance with the law\n\nContact the ICO:"
