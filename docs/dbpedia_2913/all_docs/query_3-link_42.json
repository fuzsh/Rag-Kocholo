        "text": "British engineering and aerospace equipment company Meggitt has secured a new multi-year contract with a total value of $323m to deliver wheels, brakes and related spare parts for several military aircraft.\n\nAwarded by the US Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the indefinite demand / indefinite quantity (IDIQ) agreement will continue for a period of five base years, with provision for one five-year option period.\n\nAs a sole-source acquisition, the firm-fixed-price, requirements contract for aircraft consumable and reparable parts has been received by the company’s US subsidiary Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems.\n\nUnder the agreement, Meggitt will be responsible for delivering a range of depot-level spare parts for a number of defence aircraft platforms, which include H-60 Blackhawk medium-lift utility helicopter, F-16 Fighting Falcon supersonic multi-role fighter jet and CH-47 Chinook heavy-lift helicopter.\n\n“This award demonstrates the trust and confidence that our customers have in our employee’s expertise, products and services.”\n\nMeggitt Aircraft Braking Systems president Luke Durudogan said: “This award demonstrates the trust and confidence that our customers have in our employee’s expertise, products and services. We look forward to working in partnership with the US Defence Logistics Agency.”\n\nThe current contract has been designed to replace a prior IDIQ agreement for five years that expired on 30 September this year.\n\nExpected to be completed on 29 September 2023, work on the project will be carried out at US production sites in Ohio and Kentucky."
