        "text": "Lincoln advised Meggitt PLC in its successful divestiture of Avica Aerospace Ducting. As the exclusive mergers and acquisitions (M&A) advisor to Meggitt PLC, Lincoln conducted the full sales process effectively and coordinated all parties involved in the transaction. This included managing the preparatory, marketing, due diligence and negotiation phases of the transaction.\n\nAvica Aerospace Ducting is based in Dunstable, UK, and has over 80 years of expertise in manufacturing high temperature and pressure metallic ducts, clamps and related products used in the aerospace industry. These products are used on major platforms in the space launchers, military and civil aviation markets.\n\nLeggett & Platt, Incorporated’s aerospace offering will be significantly enhanced with the addition of Avica Aerospace Ducting, boosting its existing aerospace tube product line. A key factor in Leggett & Platt’s acquisition of Avica Aerospace Ducting was its attractive fundamentals, which included strong in-house design capabilities, a niche product line and its end markets."
