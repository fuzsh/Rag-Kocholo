        "text": "I was recently privileged to attend a roundtable and brunch at the Embassy of the United State of America. The roundtable was on the topic of Unlocking #IT #innovation by Embracing Open-Source #Technologies ‚Äì an area I‚Äôm particularly interested in and always keen to discuss. The roundtable focussed on how organisations can use open-source #technology to stay ahead and to stay #innovative.üí° Open-source #tech offers a myriad of benefits, especially in terms of fostering innovation. These include #developer community collaboration, flexibility, cost efficiency, ecosystem interoperability, transparency, and access to a global pool of talent. It provides access to new and exciting tech and is certainly something organisations should embrace. üíª The #roundtable was a fantastic opportunity to knowledge share with my peers in this space and as I always say, I learnt a lot! Great to connect with some fantastic technology leaders and pioneers. ü§ù #technologyservices #tech #techcompany #innovation #IT #developer #opensource #opensourcesoftware #embassy\n\nIs your tech team ready to navigate the madness and go all the way in 2024?

Put another way, their most \"cherished resource\". Price's Law states that the square root of a company's total # of employees will account for 50% of the company's overall productivity. For example, in a 14 person company, 4 individuals will account for 50% of the productivity. In a 100 person company, 10 people will account for 50% of the productivity...and so , and so on. This said, why are almost all organizations in our space reactive when it comes to recruiting??? If a company is executing a large capital raise, and will need to expand the team significantly, perhaps it makes sense to actively seed the market that you soon hope to harvest? The \"7 X 7\" strategy is just one tool we deploy here at The Mullings Group to assist our clients in identifying, cultivating, and ultimately hiring \"Price's Law\", or what we call \"lightning rod\" hires in the Med Tech market. These are individuals whose subject matter expertise, and ability to attract other game changers into the organization, can singlehandedly alter the overall trajectory of a early to growth stage company. This week at LSI '24 in Dana Point, Joe Mullings, CEO of The Mullings Group and Dragonfly - A TMG Company (our dedicated media organization), spoke openly about this strategy, and the impact it has had on our clients. Please reach out if you would like to learn more about this tactic, and how we can deploy it for you in the war for talent in in the market.
