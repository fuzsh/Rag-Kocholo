        "text": "You can achieve a lot in your lifetime, so long as you don't burn out too fast. You can make the most of the distance, but first you've got to last. Aerospace Manufacturing hears why SC21 must be treated more like a long distance race than a sprint.\n\nJust over one second separated first place from third in the 10,000m at the London Olympics. Although the margins between gold, silver and bronze are usually wafer thin in international athletics, that's not the message coming from companies competing to secure, maintain or move up the SC21 awards rankings. SC21 is a change programme designed to accelerate the competitiveness of the aerospace, defence, security and space industries by raising the performance of its supply chains. International competition, posed by the BRIC and MINT countries necessitates rapid improvement in the effectiveness of our supply chains. At the same time, industry must ensure that it delivers competitive solutions for customers whilst maintaining profitable business growth. At Farnborough 2012 three companies, all of which are TEC's clients were awarded an SC21 bronze and set themselves the target of achieving a SC21 silver award by Farnborough 2014. The three were FSL Aerospace, TTI Inc. and Wärtsilä UK's Seals and Bearings Division. Tim Halliday, FSL's managing director, takes up the story: “In SC21 the difference between bronze and silver is huge, and it moves the bar very high up, like the difference between the height of the bar for high jump to the pole vault. Silver has a very high glass ceiling for many companies. “We have made significant improvements in the business, but have just missed silver by a whisker because of our quality score. Our rolling 12 month average quality figure is 99%, where the criteria is >99.5%. Eighty per cent of our rejects are not product related - a small minority is human error and the majority are ambiguity of specifications and/or specific requirements. “Although we came in slightly under on the quality criteria we successfully achieved the other four criteria. The facts are that in every measure of the SC21 awards criteria FSL has gained a significant improvement year on year since 2012. “Our MANEX score has gone from 219 to 442 and our OTIF is consistently above 97%, with over half of the late deliveries being only one or two days late, and therefore we are comfortably sitting in Silver territory.” <What lies beneath> FSL employees have been trained to try to get under the skin of continuous improvement, and as importantly, for it to get under their skin. Key priorities are culture change and a continuous sustainable improvement appetite among the 21 staff. Dave Bull from TEC Concepts, continuous improvement coach and SC21 Lead practitioner, explains the challenges in stepping up to silver levels of performance. “There is a huge leap between bronze and silver, with a huge step-up in business and manufacturing excellence requirements. Also for silver it's assessed in a much more thorough and rigorous way. “At Farnborough in 2012, TTI, FSL and Wärtsilä said they'd be back in two years' time for their SC21 silver award. FSL will just miss out, which is a great shame, given the effort and focus they have given the programme; Wärtsilä will almost certainly get it; and TTI Inc. has had staffing changes. All three companies have worked towards silver and made huge progress. Dave Bull explains that it's not the basic hard manufacturing or business processes that are often the problem. It's the softer skills such as communication with customers and employees. “Many companies fall down on their ability to develop a meaningful customer feedback process. You'd think this was basic but some companies are so busy growing and delivering to customers that they fail to take time out and step back to listen to the views of their customers. In my view this is essential for the long-term sustainability of any business, and that's what SC21 silver helps to secure. “There is a lot of work to do and it's definitely worth doing. There are several benefits as part of the silver journey. For example benchmarking will help to confirm their current status reference the competition and identify areas which will further improve their overall business performance, as it will in giving employees a voice. Very few companies do this in a formalised process, failing to develop a two way communication process.” <Lean and mean> To be successful in achieving a Silver MANEX score a company needs to develop a lean roadmap. Sometimes apathy can creep in around continuous improvement. What SC21 will do is deliver a change in culture so that apathy is rooted out of the business; at all levels of the business. For all the companies that continue with SC21, there are a few for whom the process doesn't achieve all their expectations. For example the magazine Production Engineering Solutions reported on Leighton Buzzard-based Hone-All Precision's experience - director Andrea Rodney: “I have to say I am disappointed. Don't get me wrong – SC21 has been very effective as a business improvement tool and the CSIP that we developed has galvanised and reinforced many of the lean manufacturing techniques that we use within the company. It has also helped us streamline analysis processes for vital aspects of the business such as quality and on-time delivery performance. “But when we signed up we were told that SC21 was the exemplar – the thing that would differentiate us from other companies when tendering for aerospace business. The truth is most of the buyers in aerospace companies we approach don't even know about SC21. “The irony is that SC21 was introduced initially to standardise, unite and ultimately improve the aerospace supply chain via a system of performance benchmarks. In reality nowadays it's almost a closed shop. I don't think it's brought in any new business for us at all, but all that said, we'll continue with it purely for the benefits it provides us from a business perspective.” Hone-All has just resubmitted for a bronze award. Neil Broad, FSL's sales & marketing director sums it up nicely: “SC21 is a relentless focus on sustainable improvement and the rewards will come, with improved business processes, happier customers and more recognition awards, whether that is Bronze, Silver or Gold. “Our staff has grasped the continuous improvement nettle and the culture of change is now embedded. To finish off with a pole vault analogy, even the great Sergei Bubka brushed the bar off now and again on his journey to becoming six times world champion and breaking 35 world records, the last of which stood for 21 years until February this year. We are more than determined to achieve Silver in the near future and improving the services that we offer the aerospace industry.” <Keep on running> Sarah Barnard, SC21 programme manager at ADS Group, comments: “We have been running the industry designed SC21 programme for more than seven years. During that time, we have seen the prominence of the programme grow and grow – from just 12 award winners in 2009 to over 250 Bronze, Silver and Gold winners awarded by the end of 2013. “What's clear is that the benefit each company enjoys as a result of completing the programme varies enormously: Some report fitter, leaner processes, many see financial benefits such as increased turnover or reduced production costs and some have been able to foster stronger customer relationships of an increased market presence as a result of the programme. “For companies already engaged in the SC21 programme, it can prove challenging to move from Bronze to Silver to Gold awards. The standards are incredibly high and a business must show continuous improvement and incremental progress. It's a significant commitment in terms of time, effort and action. But we are seeing companies rise to the challenge. For example, multiple award winners High-Tech Engineering and MEP have relentlessly pursued quality and delivery to show their customers a real commitment to continuous and exceptional performance. “The SC21 team are very proud to work on this programme that enables companies to profit from excellence. It is doubtless that more work needs to be done within the industry and we are not resting on our laurels. Among other activity SC21 has also developed a Buyer's Guide for procurement communities. The work was led principally by Meggitt, Thales, AgustaWestland and SC21 strategic partners.” At the end of the day SC21 is more like a long distance race than a sprint. Talking about his victory at the 10,000m in the 2012 Olympics, Mo Farah said: “It's something I have worked so hard for - 120 miles week in week out. What you put in to it is what you get out.” And that's like SC21. www.adsgroup.org.uk\n\nwww.fslaerospace.co.uk www.tectransnational.com"
