        "text": "The performance of a company depends heavily on its suppliers. Therefore, a reliable network of partners (suppliers, dealers and manufacturers) is elementary. In bills of lading, a total of 15 international suppliers of Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. could be identified on which the company is relying. One of the suppliers is, for example, the company Lion Mentari Airlines, which delivered 3 shipments.\n\nAmong 3 identified supplying countries, an important source to purchase products from is: Vietnam. 46 shipments of goods could be identified from this country.\n\nGet an overview of Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd.’s international procurement and its 15 suppliers with Company Transparency\n\nGenerally you can differentiate the supply chain or supply network of Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. by two perspectives:\n\nThe supplier side (a so-called Tier-1-supplier is a direct supplier, Tier-2 is a supplier of the Tier-1 supplier, Tier-n is a supplier at any level in the Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. supply network).\n\nThe buyer side (a so-called Tier-1 buyer is a direct buyer, Tier-2 is a buyer of the Tier-1 buyer, Tier-n is a buyer at any level in the Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. distribution network).\n\nTo ensure business stability and continuity, a supply chain or supply network must be constructed in such a way that external influences can cause as little damage as possible to Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd.. This applies both in the area of procurement (the loss of a supplier must be covered by an alternative supplier) as in the area of sales (the loss of a buyer must be covered by an alternative buyer).\n\nRisks can generally be considered as the non-availability of goods, through cutback or complete halt of production, or the potential loss of business partners, violating compliance rules (e.g. protection of the environment, labor legislation) and thus drop out of the supply network.\n\nThis risk should not necessarily be limited to the direct business partner (Tier 1), it involves the entire supply chain, unless sufficient alternative suppliers and buyers have been put in place.\n\nGet an overview of the international supply chain of Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. (upstream/procurement and downstream/sales) from Tier-1 to Tier-n\n\nE.G.: Tier 1 supplier Lion Mentari AirlinesTier-1 Buyer Meggit Aircraft Braking System\n\nABRAMS world trade wiki not only shows direct suppliers and customers of the first tier (Tier-1). With just one click in our tool Supply Chain Intelligence you get a comprehensive insight into the supply network with multiple tiers (Tier-n) beyond the first tier.\n\nEach tier in the supply chain or supply network on the supplier side of Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. involves a single risk. The more tiers, the more difficult it is to analyze and monitor the business partners. Suppliers of suppliers are generally unknown, so there is already an increasing risk at the second (Tier 2) level.\n\nIf e.g. a first Tier supplier is not adding any value, the supply chain can be shortened and the risk of failure can be minimized by skipping this supplier. A previous Tier-2 supplier now turns into a Tier-1 supplier, which we call \"go-direct\". In our tool Supply Chain Intelligence as far as international suppliers are concerned, this analysis can be done with one click:\n\nAnalyze the potential of shortening and therefore stabilizing the supply chain of Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd.\n\nBased on the analysis of international bills of lading (bill of lading/ bills of lading/ BOL), a total of 11 different product categories that have been purchased by Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd., can be identified.\n\nThese are classified by means of HS codes (HTS codes or customs tariff numbers).\n\nFor example, HS code 880330 classifies the following products:\n\n„Parts of aeroplanes or helicopters, n.e.s. (excl. those for gliders)\". This HS code was sighted 63 times in total.\n\nGet an overview of internationally purchased products by Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. with Company Transparency\n\nEach tier in the supply chain or supply network of Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. is adding value and therefore costs. The more tiers, the more expensive the product gets. Supply chains are normally not very transparent, trade secrets are part of the survival tactics in each stage of the value chain, especially for trading companies.\n\nIf e.g. a Tier-1 supplier from Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. that primarily trades a product and doesn’t add any value (only fulfills the distributor function) it is possible to shorten the supply chain and reduce purchasing costs. A previous Tier-2 supplier now turns into a Tier-1 supplier, which we call \"go-direct\". In our tool Supply Chain Intelligence as far as international suppliers are concerned, this analysis can be done with one click:\n\nAnalyze the potential of shortening the supply chain of Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. and saving costs on the procurement side.\n\nThe performance of a company depends fundamentally on its buyers. Therefore, a largest possible base of stable buyers is crucial. A total of 24 international buyers of Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. could be identified in bills of lading. For example, one of the buyers is the company Meggit Aircraft Braking System, which has received 8 shipments.\n\nAmong 4 identified buying countries, an important target country to sell products to is: India. 216 shipments of goods were shipped to this country in the period covered.\n\nGet an overview of the international sales and its 24 buyers of Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. with Company Transparency\n\nBased on the analysis of international bills of lading (bill of lading/ bills of lading/ BOL), a total of 56 different product categories sold by Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd., can be identified.\n\nThese are classified by means of HS codes (HTS codes or customs tariff numbers).\n\nFor example, HS code 853110 classifies the following products:\n\n„Burglar or fire alarms and similar apparatus\". This HS code was sighted 52 times in total.\n\nFrom the product descriptions of the analyzed bills of lading (bill of lading/ bills of lading/ BOL), the following products sold to various buyers can be identified as an example:\n\n43 PACAKGES PACK INTO PALLETS WORN HEAT PACK USED FOR AIRCRAFT BRAKE MAINTENANCE HS CODE 880320\n\nB.T.I (BREAK TEMP IND) B.T.I (BREAK TEMP IND)\n\nACTUATOR KIT P/N G728888 S/N 7298,7296 (AIRCRAFT PART FOR SCHEDULE AIRLINE)\n\nACTUATOR KIT P/N G728888 (AIRCRAFT PART FOR SCHEDULE AIRLINE)\n\nRESTRAINT SYSTEM (QTY : 115 EA) P/N : 2100002-01-048\n\nREEL & STRAP ASSY (QTY : 5 EA) P/N : 2000013-200-001\n\nRESTRAINT SYSTEM (QTY : 8 EA) P/N : 2100002-01-278 RESTRAINT (RH) (QTY : 13 EA) P/N : 2100002-100-048 RESTRAINT SYSTEM (QTY : 2 EA) P/N : 2100002-01-048\n\nLAP/SHLDR STRAP ASSY (QTY : 5 EA) P/N : 1117556-100-048\n\nRESTRAINT SYSTEM (QTY : 43 EA) P/N : 2100002-01-048 RESTRAINT (RH) (QTY : 4 EA) P/N : 2100002-100-048 RESTRAINT (RH) (QTY : 1 EA) P/N : 2100002-100-048\n\nDUAL DETECTOR ASSY (QTY : 3 EA) P/N : 902864 S/N : 20042, 20043, 20047\n\nGet an overview of internationally sold products by Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. with Company Transparency\n\nEach tier in the buyer side of the supply chain or supply network of Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. is adding value and therefore costs. The more tiers, the more expensive the product gets. Supply chains are normally not very transparent, trade secrets are part of the survival tactics in each stage of the value chain, especially for trading companies.\n\nIf e.g. a Tier-1 buyer from Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. that primarily trades products and doesn’t add any value (only fulfills the distributor function) it is possible to shorten the supply chain downstream giving a potential to optimize profit margins for Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd.. A previous Tier-2 buyer now turns into a Tier-1 buyer, which we call \"go-direct\". In our tool Supply chain Intelligence as far as international buyers are concerned, this analysis can be done with one click:\n\nAnalyze the potential to shorten the supply chain and optimize the profit margins on the sales side of Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd.\n\nEach company contributes significantly minimizing risks for its buyers, through its own stability. Internal risks (endogenous factors) can be e.g. financially (financial ratios, free cash flow, balance sheets) or operationally (production, lead times). Since 2021, external risks have increased due to worldwide shortages and are an important factor as to whether a supplier such as Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. can itself reliably deliver due to external dependencies (exogenous factors).\n\nTo assess this, data analysis should be conducted to get practical answers:\n\nHow is the supply chain or supply network structured on the supplier side of Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd.? Are there suppliers or products in the supply chain that are reported as critical, e.g. in international media?\n\nWhich buyers does Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. consistently sell to over a long period of time that can be identified as a good reference?\n\nThe more constant outgoing shipments of a company’s, the easier it is to assess potential problems for a supplier like Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd.\n\nOperational aspects like a stable supply chain, an in-house production and reliable logistics define sustainable performance.\n\nSince 2021, global supply shortages have increasingly added external factors as to whether a supplier like Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. can deliver reliably itself through dependencies.\n\nBased on the statistical trend of shipments (in terms of the number of shipments and respectively the quantity of goods) the current supply and performance capacity can be indirectly analyzed.\n\nHere you can see an analysis of shipments by Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. to international buyers in the last few months with Company Transparency\n\nThe more constant incoming shipments, the better one can determine possible procurement problems of a company like Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd.\n\nSince 2021, there are increasingly external factors due to global supply shortages, whether a company, no matter manufacturer or distributor, can reliably deliver through dependencies.\n\nBased on the statistical trend of shipments (in terms of the number of shipments and respectively the quantity of goods) it is possible to analyze current procurement stability and thus ultimately also to derive an indication of the company’s delivery and performance capability.\n\nHere you can see an analysis of shipments from international suppliers to Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. in the last few months with Company Transparency\n\nSourcing products as regionally as possible with short shipping routes and the use of sustainable materials define the CO₂ footprint and sustainability of the products of any company, including Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd.\n\nAfter many companies, predominantly due to cost savings, have been building their networks increasingly internationally for years, there is now an increasing trend of so-called “on-shoring” or “near-shoring”. Attempting to include suppliers who are the closest to the supply chain because of financial, risk, environmental and image aspects:\n\nSaving international freight costs, which have risen extremely since 2021.\n\nMinimizing risks caused by logistics problems (e.g. the Suez Canal obstruction in 2021)\n\nAttempting to reduce the carbon footprint when purchasing products.\n\nSetting and meeting sustainability goals for own products of Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd.\n\nBased on the development of current shipments (in terms of number of shipments and quantity of goods) and changes in international suppliers and routes, it is possible to analyze the extent to which Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd. has already made efforts in recent months and years, to focus on environmentally relevant aspects, like carbon footprint and sustainability in its business activities.\n\nGet an overview of the international shipments that have an impact on the CO₂ footprint, as well as the sustainability of Meggitt Aerospace Asia Pacific Pte Ltd."
