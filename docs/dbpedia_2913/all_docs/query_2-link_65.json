        "text": "Parker Meggitt, a leading international aerospace and defence business unit of Parker Aerospace, announced today that on August 1 it received Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) for iPRESS™, a long-range wireless tire pressure gauge for aviation. iPRESS is now available for a variety of aircraft.\n\nThe sensor delivers an enhanced user experience while verifying inflation pressure using Parker Meggitt’s breakthrough Wireless Tire Pressure Sensor (WTPS), and a new tire pressure status feature that is integrated into an app for smartphones and tablets.\n\nThe advanced long-range wireless sensing technology allows users to stand in front of the aircraft, open the dedicated app on a smartphone or tablet, and instantly read the tire pressure of each wheel. The sensor provides an accurate tire pressure reading every time, wherever and whenever needed, making the solution a great addition for customers.\n\n“We are extremely excited to gain our first certification of iPRESS, and introduce this innovative product to the market, as it is truly illustrative of an engineering breakthrough which leads to a better tomorrow,” commented Paul Devaux, general manager of the Motion Power & Sensing Division. “Working with aircraft manufacturers, we’ve developed a wireless system specifically to meet our customers’ needs, helping them to increase efficiency and safety.”\n\niPRESS is an easy retrofit solution using a smartphone or tablet, with no dedicated reader required. Installation, maintenance, and smartphone/tablet configuration are also simple.\n\nThe innovative long-range wireless technology also speeds up aircraft tire pressure checks. Tire pressure monitoring is an essential part of aircraft maintenance, helping to prevent failure events caused by improper tire inflation. Using a wireless system can help to extend tire life, reduce human error, lower maintenance costs, and increase flight safety.\n\niPRESS is now available to be fitted on a range of aircrafts."
