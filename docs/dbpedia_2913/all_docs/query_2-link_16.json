The companies, experienced in both OEM and end-user business, will share development expertise as well as customer service and support activities. Their focus will be creating a new resource in the marketplace with a complete range of products and services.\n\n“Vibro-Meter has built a solid reputation over 35 years in protection, condition and performance monitoring solutions for turbo machinery. And it has expertise in special sensors for harsh environments like gas and steam turbine applications,” said Phil Knights, president of SKF Service Division. “Since the ’70s, DYMAC has been well known for eddy-current probes and protection systems employed in the petrochemical, paper, steel, oil and gas industries. The alliance offers both new and existing customers the advantage of flexibility and scalability available from the combined product offering.”\n\nRichard Greaves, president of Vibro-Meter SA, said, “The strength in combined technology competencies, as well as experience in working with both OEMs and end-users, will offer customers a unique, high-quality product and service solution. Customers will find the DYMAC and Vibro-Meter team easy to differentiate from competitors. It will provide a responsive and flexible approach to their monitoring and protection needs, together with the best possible customer support.”\n\nVibro-Meter will build upon its relationships with major machinery manufacturers and packagers by concentrating on OEM accounts. DYMAC, known for tailored solutions to end-users in many industries and for comprehensive local support, will concentrate on end-user applications.\n\nSales channels of both companies will handle sales of the DYMAC and Vibro-Meter solutions. The alliance will continue to provide sales and service support for existing products.\n\nDYMAC is a unit of SKF Service Division, which is part of the worldwide SKF Group. The SKF Service Division offers a full range of bearings, products and services to extend machine service life, reduce overall maintenance costs and improve plant efficiency.\n\nVibro-Meter SA is a member company of Meggitt PLC, an international group engaged in the design and manufacture of high-integrity products for aerospace, electronics and industrial controls markets worldwide."
