        "text": "Meggitt Training Systems has been selected as one of the five finalist companies qualified to carry out the US Army targetry systems (ATS) programme.\n\nThe combat skills training programme aims to deliver equipment for live-fire training ranges at US Army installations worldwide.\n\nThe $125m ATS programme will be carried out through individual contracts that will be awarded over the next five years with an estimated completion date of 15 March 2023.\n\n“Products provided by Meggitt Training Systems include a wide range of multi-function, stationary and moving infantry targets in order to ensure maximum realism during training.”\n\nMeggitt Training Systems Live-fire Systems director Jon Read said: “Meggitt Training Systems appreciates the opportunity to deliver on the upcoming Army Targetry Systems programme.\n\n“We believe our track record at US Army training ranges at home and abroad makes us the ideal choice for the next generation of live-fire targets.”\n\nThe programme will be administered by the US Army Contracting Command based in Warren, Michigan.\n\nOn 30 August 2011, a $475m indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) ATS programme contract was awarded to Lockheed Martin, Action Target, Strategic Systems, and Saab Training, as well as Meggitt.\n\nProducts provided by Meggitt Training Systems include a wide range of multi-function, stationary and moving infantry targets in order to ensure maximum realism during training.\n\nTo date, more than 75,000 infantry target systems have been successfully installed by the company in 122 military bases across the world."
