We look forward to sharing in the future success of the project, Kris McPhail, Fund Manager at Aviva Investors, said.\n\n“This was a complex acquisition with multiple stakeholders to manage, our time line was tight and we had to adopt innovative ways to achieve a design build and lease back vehicle to meet our goals. With the intention of entering a 30-year lease, choosing the right funding partner for this £100m (c. €11.9m) project was also fundamental to a successful outcome and in Aviva Investors this proved the case. Kris McPhail of the Lime Property fund and their lawyers, Pinsent Mason, worked tirelessly with the Meggitt team over the last eight months helping structure the deal that worked for everyone,“ Jonathan Jones, Group Property Director, Meggitt PLC said.\n\n“As Joint Development Partners with Manse, we were delighted to receive such a serious enquiry as this one from Meggitt, almost immediately upon the signing of our Promotion Agreement for Prospero Ansty and to follow that within such a short period of time with a committed deal to Meggitt funded by Aviva and the Lime fund,” Richard Smith, Joint Managing Director, Opus Land said."
