I'm pleased to share positive news about Leon and his team's progress in overcoming supply chain constraints, as highlighted in Vertical this morning. Their dedication to navigating challenges is commendable. Attending the Sikorsky Appraiser Conference was insightful, especially witnessing the impressive 2.3 million fleet hours accumulated by the S92. The potential of this data set is immense, from extending LLPs to lowering DOCs, showing promising advancements in efficiency. Additionally, Sikorsky's work on an electric Tail Rotor gearbox and Matrix, along with their successful autonomous flight of a Blackhawk, demonstrates their commitment to innovation. However, the recent S92 Norway training accident is a tragic reminder of the risks involved in our industry. My heart goes out to the families affected and my colleagues at Bristow and Sikorsky. Let's await the investigation results patiently and refrain from jumping to conclusions. Despite challenges, I remain optimistic about the future of this product and the talented individuals at Sikorsky. Together, we'll continue pushing boundaries and shaping the future of aerospace. #Aerospace #Innovation #SafetyFirst"
