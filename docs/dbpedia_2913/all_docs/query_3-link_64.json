        "text": "New AESQ Reference Manual (RM)13004 Webinar Series\n\nAS13100 Process FMEA & Control Plans - Meeting the Requirements While Adding Value to the Business\n\nLed by Dr Ian Riggs, this series of interactive webinars scheduled September 14-16 is designed to describe the intent of the AESQ AS13100 requirements for Process FMEA and Control Plans and how they link to the effective deployment of Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP) and a Zero Defect Strategy.\n\nThese webinars shall explain how AS13100 Process FMEA and Control Plans can be developed, maintained, and improved using real examples of best practice from across the industry. It shall also illustrate the unique approach to the use of Reference Process FMEAs to help standardize the organization’s PFMEAs and to reduce the length of time taken to create them.\n\nThey will also present the opportunity to ask questions and to clarify any points around these important requirements.\n\nLearn More & Register\n\nMeggitt Joins AESQ\n\nAESQ is proud to welcome Meggitt as its newest member. Meggitt joined AESQ at the \"AESQ Member\" membership level which is open to organizations that are engaged in the Aero Engine supply chain. Meggitt is the second company to join at this new membership level. The \"AESQ Member\" level provides members with the opportunity to participate in the work of the AESQ and support its working groups.\n\nThanks to Meggitt for joining the AESQ.\n\nLearn How to Get Involved\n\nAESQ Announces Leadership Changes\n\nThe AESQ Strategy Group \"Congratulates and Welcomes\" newly elected leaders:\n\nBarbara Negroe, GE Aviation, as Chair\n\nLisa Claveloux, Pratt & Whitney, as Vice Chair\n\nTracey Lockhart, Rolls-Royce, as Treasurer\n\nAESQ says \"Thank You\" to Dr. Ian Riggs, Rolls-Royce, for his vision and dedication in the role of Chairman driving the group forward. AESQ also thanks Barbara Negroe, GE Aviation, for serving in the role of Vice Chair, and Lisa Claveloux, Pratt & Whitney, for serving as Treasurer. The leadership and guidance of Ian, Barbara, and Lisa, moved AESQ closer to fulfillment of its vision \"To establish, deploy, and maintain a common set of quality requirements that enable the global aero-engine supply chain to be truly competitive through lean, capable processes and a culture of continuous improvement.\" AESQ's incoming leaders will continue this journey.\n\nLeadership Listing\n\nQuality Foundations Training Course Coming Soon!\n\nSAE Professional Development is launching Quality Foundations in September 2021 to support the requirements called out in AS13100. The course will be available in a Virtual Instructor Led Training (VILT) format and will be available globally to suppliers in the aerospace supply chain.\n\nDesigned to bring together the key quality systems, processes, and methodologies to show how they work as part of a system, it will focus on Defect Prevention. The 3-day course will include hands on case studies that illustrate how the quality tools are to be carried out and opportunities to evaluate the current practice inside the supplier organization.\n\nAESQ and IAQG Ensure Alignment Between Quality Standards\n\nThrough joint dedication to improving quality in the aerospace industry, the Aerospace Engine Supplier Quality Strategy Group (AESQ), a Program of the SAE ITC, and the International Aerospace Quality Group (IAQG) continue to partner to further their respective missions.\n\nWhile both organizations maintain complementary, non-competing initiatives, their partnership is managed by a collaboration team comprised of IAQG and AESQ members. The IAQG provides standardization and reduces additional, company-specific quality requirements throughout the overall aerospace and defense aviation industry, while the AESQ focus is specific to the aero-engine supply chain and the reduction of additional, company-specific quality requirements flowed down contractually by the OEM’s.\n\nIAQG and AESQ members are aligned with their commitment to contractually flow down the AS/EN/JISQ 9100 series. A goal of the collaboration is to keep both the IAQG and the AESQ informed of each other’s initiatives providing opportunities for joint success. Through this collaboration, AESQ and IAQG regularly review the other’s standards to avoid duplication and ensure alignment between the AS13xxx series and the AS/EN/JISQ 91xx series.\n\nThe AS13100 and AS/EN/JISQ 9100 Standards are designed as complimentary documents where IAQG manages AS9100 for aerospace, space, and defense suppliers, and AESQ manages AS13100 for aero engine supply chains. AS13100 replaces major parts of the Aero Engine Manufacturers’ unique supplier requirements by creating a single set of harmonized requirements. They are in addition (supplemental) to ISO9001, AS/EN/JISQ 9100 and Nadcap and do not replace them.\n\nAESQ and IAQG will continue their partnership to ensure collaboration and alignment for an improved aerospace industry into the future.\n\nRead Full Story\n\nAS13100 Deployment Update\n\nThe AESQ is constantly looking to provide tools and resources to support members of their supply chain in implementing the AS13100 standard. One of the first tools which was developed is the RM13009 Compliance Assessment document. This document provides a structure for companies to begin to identify their current compliance to the new AS13100 standard including a 3-part Self-Assessment Checklist that can be used to document both compliance and any gaps that may exist needing addressing. Prior to conducting the Self-Assessment, it is highly recommended that a company’s Quality Leaders follow the SAE AS13100™ Requirements Training Course (on-line/ 10 hours) and/or the soon to be released AESQ Quality Foundations Course to ensure complete understanding of the AS13100 requirements.\n\nDownload Milestone Plan"
