        "text": "The president is directly elected for up to two consecutive five-year terms. The prime minister, who holds most day-to-day executive authority, is appointed by the president based on the results of legislative elections. Executive elections are typically considered free and fair.\n\nCarlos Vila Nova, of the opposition ADI, was elected president in September 2021, winning 57.5 percent of the second-round vote. The electoral process was marred by a number of irregularities, including allegations of vote-counting errors after the first round of voting in July. The allegations prompted third-place candidate Delfim Neves to request that the Constitutional Court order a recount. The request “paralyzed the court,” which issued three separate rulings on the matter before declining to order a recount. The dispute delayed the second-round polls, and voting did not take place before the mandate of incumbent president Evaristo Carvalho had expired in early September. Allegations of fraud were not repeated during the second-round vote, and both domestic and international observers ultimately assessed the elections as largely free and fair.\n\nJorge Bom Jesus has served as prime minister since 2018, when he was appointed following the formation of a coalition government—comprised by the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe–Social Democratic Party (MLSTP-PSD) and a bloc consisting of the Democratic Convergence Party, the Union of Democrats for Citizenship and Development, and the Force for Democratic Change Movement (PCD-UDD-MDFM)—after that year’s legislative elections.\n\nMembers of the unicameral, 55-seat National Assembly are elected by popular vote to four-year terms. In the October 2018 legislative elections, the ADI secured 25 seats, followed by the MLSTP-PSD with 23, the PCD-UDD-MDFM with 5, and the Movement of Independent Citizens with 2.\n\nFollowing the elections, in a bid to secure an absolute majority, then prime minister Patrice Trovoada requested that the Constitutional Court order a recount of ballots that had been ruled invalid, which the court agreed to. The opposition condemned the court’s decision as biased in favor of the ADI. Demonstrations held outside the site of the recount were violently dispersed by security forces, who fired tear gas into the crowd. Later that month, the Constitutional Court certified the initial election results, and the ADI did not gain any seats. Despite the controversy, international observers deemed the elections largely credible. New allegations of fraud in the October 2018 legislative elections emerged in September 2021, prompting ADI leaders to request an official investigation into the claims.\n\nThe electoral laws and framework are generally fair, but implementation suffers from lack of resources and staff.\n\nIn November 2020, the National Assembly approved a law preventing citizens born and living abroad to run for president. The ADI criticized the legislation, claiming it was designed to keep Trovoada—who was named party leader the month before and was born in Gabon—from running for president. In January 2021, President Carvalho vetoed the law, saying it limited civil and political rights. The president enacted the legislation the following month, after changes were made to remove provisions curtailing the political activities of citizens born and living abroad and to add an article allowing groups of citizens to run for legislative elections.\n\nDespite flaws in the administration of the 2021 presidential elections, international election observers praised the conduct of the CEN, which the African Union (AU) observation mission reported was generally well-organized and able to efficiently manage challenges posed by electoral disputes. However, the AU election observation report criticized both the repeated postponement of the second round of voting and the “ad hoc nature” of the CEN, recommending that the CEN be made a permanent body.\n\nThe prime minister and cabinet determine the government policy under the supervision of the National Assembly and the president. They implement laws and policies without improper interference from unelected entities.\n\nIn August 2021, the president dismissed defense minister Óscar Sousa at the request of prime minister Jorge Bom Jesus; Sousa’s dismissal came after the ADI accused him of ordering the arrest of both the president and the prime minister in an alleged “attempt to subvert the constitutional order.” The government opened an inquiry into the allegations later that month.\n\nCorruption is a major problem. Oversight mechanisms, the opposition, and the media have repeatedly uncovered evidence of official malfeasance, sometimes resulting in dismissals and other repercussions, but anticorruption laws are poorly enforced. In September 2020, the cabinet sought to “withdraw its confidence” in Attorney General Kelve Nobre de Carvalho over issues including the disappearance of drugs from Judicial Police premises; he remained in his post through 2021.\n\nOther allegations of government corruption surfaced in the media in December 2021, when it was reported that a government contract for the sale of rice donated by Japan had been awarded to a company owned by representatives of the MLSTP and the PCD-UDD-MDFM. The government, which had suspended its contract with the company prior to the 2021 presidential elections, denied any wrongdoing.\n\nFreedom of the press is constitutionally guaranteed and largely respected in practice. Public media convey opposition views and grant some access to opposition leaders, but only a handful of private media outlets are available, and a degree of self-censorship is reported at both public and private outlets. There are no restrictions on online media, though the sector is poorly developed. Some 30 percent of the population has internet access, and the government is working to expand the country’s internet coverage.\n\nThe constitution protects freedom of assembly, which the government generally observes in practice. However, organizers are obliged to give authorities two days’ notice before public gatherings. In June 2021, women activists in the city of São Tomé organized a large protest against gender-based violence (GBV). The government responded to the protest with a statement acknowledging an increase in GBV and condemning the murder of Maria de Lurdes Pereira, who was killed by her former husband earlier that month.\n\nThe constitution provides for an independent judiciary, and the courts are relatively autonomous in practice, but they are susceptible to political influence and corruption. The current and previous governments embarked on a series of politically charged judicial appointments and dismissals.\n\nIn December 2020, the government launched a three-year modernization program of the justice system designed, in part, to bolster judicial and prosecutorial independence. The government initiated several projects in line with the program’s goals in 2021, including beginning the construction of a regional court in the district of Caué and acquiring new technology to facilitate the continued digitalization of the judicial system.\n\nSeveral judges, with the support of the country’s judges’ union, issued a statement in November 2021 accusing the Superior Council of Judicial Magistrates (CMSJ) of using “discriminatory” criteria, including a seniority requirement, to select candidates for two vacancies on the Supreme Court (STJ). Though the CMSJ later revised the selection process, the judges’ union alleged that it remained marred by “irregularities and illegalities”; no STJ selections were made before year’s end."
