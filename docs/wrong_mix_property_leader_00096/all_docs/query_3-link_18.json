        "text": "The president is directly elected for up to two consecutive five-year terms. Executive elections are typically considered free and fair.\n\nCarlos Vila Nova of ADI was elected president in September 2021, winning 57.5 percent of the vote in a delayed second round. The election was marred by irregularities, including allegations of first-round vote-counting errors. The Constitutional Court, meanwhile, issued multiple rulings in response to third-place candidate Delfim Nevès’s request before ultimately denying it. The second round was not affected by fraud allegations, and both domestic and international observers ultimately assessed the elections as largely free and fair.\n\nThe prime minister, who holds most day-to-day executive authority, is appointed by the president based on the results of legislative elections. Patrice Trovoada of ADI became prime minister in November 2022, after ADI won a majority in that September’s elections.\n\nMembers of the unicameral, 55-seat National Assembly are elected by popular vote to four-year terms. The opposition ADI won 30 seats in September 2022; ADI displaced the ruling Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe–Social Democratic Party (MLSTP-PSD), which won 18. A coalition of the Movement of Independent Citizens/Socialist Party and the Party of National Unity won 5, while the Basta Movement won 2. Turnout stood at 65.4 percent.\n\nThe vote was marred by allegations of irregularities, including vote buying. Demonstrators blocked access to polling stations near a hospital in São Tomé to protest a lack of drinking water. The National Electoral Commission (CEN) took over a day to report provisional results and delegated the reporting of final results to the Constitutional Court; ADI supporters protested at CEN headquarters in response to the delay, burning tires. European Union (EU) observers called the polls themselves as “peaceful and orderly” but criticized the absence of campaign spending limits and “difficult enforcement of the ban on foreign funding.”\n\nLocal and regional elections, including for Príncipe’s regional assembly, were concurrently held with the parliamentary elections. ADI won most local seats under a new majoritarian system. The ruling Union for Change and Progress of Príncipe topped the regional polls there.\n\nThe electoral laws and framework are generally fair, but their implementation suffers from the lack of resources and staff. In May 2022, the Constitutional Court presented a new map for parliamentary districts ahead of the September elections, including the two seats for members of the diaspora.\n\nIn April 2022, ADI criticized the tardy seating of CEN members. EU observers reported that electoral-roll updates were not conducted ahead of the elections because of that delay, leading to significant disenfranchisement.\n\nWomen and minority groups enjoy full political rights. While women have made advances in the political sphere, societal discrimination and disparities in access to education inhibit women’s participation. In September 2022, the president signed a gender parity law establishing that women should hold 40 percent of decision-making posts at the national and regional levels; it took effect after that month’s elections.\n\nSome 30 percent of elected positions should be held by women per the preexisting Political Party Law but only 14.5 percent of the parliament’s seats were won by women in September 2022. Four women were included in the 11-member cabinet announced in November; the new government also established the Ministry of Women’s Rights after taking power.\n\nThe prime minister and cabinet determine policy under the supervision of the National Assembly and the president. They implement laws and policies without improper interference from unelected entities.\n\nIn April 2022, then prime minister Bom Jesus requested the dismissal of central bank governor Américo Barros, arguing that he had become politically active as a MLSTP-PSD presidential candidate. The president refused the request and was criticized by Bom Jesus for interfering with the government’s decision-making authority.\n\nCorruption is a major problem. Oversight mechanisms, the opposition, and the media have repeatedly uncovered evidence of official malfeasance, sometimes resulting in dismissals and other repercussions. However, anticorruption laws are poorly enforced. In March 2022, President Vila Nova announced the creation of a committee of “wise men” to curb corruption.\n\nIn April 2022, an Angolan journalist reported that $20 million in investments routed through Angola and directed to São Tomé and Príncipe went unaccounted for after 2015. The journalist implicated Vila Nova, Trovoada, and a former minister. In June, Attorney General Kelve Nobre de Carvalho requested a new audit into why an inquiry into the matter had been closed.\n\nFreedom of the press is constitutionally guaranteed and largely respected in practice. Public media convey opposition views and grant some access to opposition leaders, but only a handful of private outlets are available, and a degree of self-censorship is reported at both public and private outlets. The public television, radio, and wire outlets are under the prime minister’s office.\n\nThere are no restrictions on online media, though the sector is poorly developed. Some 30 percent of the population has internet access, and the government is working to expand coverage.\n\nThe constitution provides for an independent judiciary. Courts are relatively autonomous in practice, but they are susceptible to political influence and corruption.\n\nIn 2020, the government launched a three-year modernization program of the justice system designed, in part, to bolster judicial and prosecutorial independence. That program is ongoing.\n\nJudges have complained of the use of “discriminatory” criteria, including a seniority requirement, to fill Supreme Court of Justice vacancies in 2021. Judges held a strike days before the September 2022 elections, asking for better wages and workplace conditions.\n\nLaw enforcement authorities generally observe legal safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention as well as guarantees for a fair trial, but police corruption is a problem, and indigent defendants are sometimes denied access to a lawyer. Nearly a third of prisoners are in pretrial detention, which can sometimes be lengthy.\n\nPolice are sometimes accused of physically attacking suspects during arrest. Prisons are known to suffer from overcrowding and other harsh conditions. In March 2022, the government opened a new prison wing constructed with UN support. In December, Justice Minister Ilza Amado Vaz warned that crime had increased in the country and conceded that prison conditions were inadequate.\n\nIn November 2022, Prime Minister Trovoada said that government forces repelled an apparent coup attempt after a group of fighters attacked a military barracks. Former presidential candidate Delfim Nevès was arrested for allegedly participating. Four suspects reportedly died in custody but images depicting the suspects’ apparent torture surfaced, prompting the December resignation of army chief of staff Olinto Paquete. The government ordered an investigation into the incident in December."
