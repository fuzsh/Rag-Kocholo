The use of family planning, however, remains low and the adolescent pregnancy rate is high, exacerbating the vulnerability of young people, particularly girls. UNFPA programmes use a multisectoral approach to address reproductive health issues and strong communications to promote behavioural change and reposition family planning, including gender and youth issues, into the national development.\n\nPlease wait...\n\nProgramme Activities\n\nSelect Year:\n\nAll resources\n\nCore\n\nNon - core\n\nSao Tome and Principe 2014 Programme Activities
