        "text": "The worldwide distribution of fungal species hypotheses has been questioned by modern molecular analyses. Studies have demonstrated that many cosmopolitan species actually consist of divergent clades that present high levels of morphological stasis throughout their evolutionary histories (Mueller et al. 2001, Bickford et al. 2007, Geml et al. 2008, Davis et al. 2014). Phallus indusiatus Vent. – also known as the “veiled lady” mushroom – has been described as a circum-tropical species, with records for South and Central America (Dennis 1960, Saénz and Nassar 1982, Leite et al. 2007, Cheype 2010), Mexico (Guzmán et al. 1990), Africa (Dissing and Lange 1962, Dring 1964, Demoulin and Dring 1975, Dring and Rose 1977, Desjardin and Perry 2015), Asia (Dennis 1953, Liu 1984, Hosaka 2010) and Australia (Smith 2005). For some groups of fungi, spore dispersal mechanisms may support the idea of transoceanic dispersal connecting geographically isolated populations (Halling et al. 2008, Hosaka et al. 2008). However, the current distribution of P. indusiatus may actually reflect the lack of taxonomic resolution due to the small number of diagnostic morphological characters, which leads to the identification of new records as populations of P. indusiatus. The insect-dependent mechanism of spore dispersal may also have played an important role in determining the current distribution of P. indusiatus.\n\nAs in phalloid fungi in general, few morphological characters are available to delimit species in Phallus. In addition, most of the widely used diagnostic characters – such as colour and sizes – show high plasticity, another factor that may lead to misidentifications and mask the real diversity within the genus (Kreisel 1996, Calonge 2005). As a consequence of these taxonomic uncertainties, a great number of synonyms are reported for several species of this clade. Phallus indusiatus is an emblematic example, where at least nineteen synonyms and several distinct forms have been described (Lloyd 1909, Liu 1984, Guzmán et al. 1990, Kreisel 1996, Calonge 2005, Das et al. 2007, Cheype 2010).\n\nDue to lack of resolution when using morphological characters to identify Phallus species, we believe that several specimens that have been identified as P. indusiatus might actually consist of independently evolving entities. In fact, some new species with minimal, yet noticeable morphological differences from P. indusiatus, have been proposed. For instance, P. serrata H.L. Li, L. Ye, P.E. Mortimer, J.C. Xu & K.D. Hyde, described for China, differs by the meshes of the indusium with serrate edges (Li et al. 2014); P. echinovolvatus (M. Zang, D.R. Zheng and Z.X. Hu) Kreisel has a whitish volva with mycelioid projections on the surface (Zang et al. 1988); and P. flavidus Kreisel & Hausknecht, described for the Seychelles, has yellowish pigments on the receptacle and indusium (Kreisel and Hausknecht 2009). Some of these species were described with the support of molecular analyses, which reinforces the importance of this kind of analysis to resolve these taxonomic uncertainties. At least three species resembling P. indusiatus were described for Brazil: Phallus moelleri Lloyd, Dictyophora callichroa Möller and Dictyophora phalloidea Desv. In the original descriptions, they present some inherent characteristics that distinguish them from P. indusiatus, such as the above-ground development of the volva in D. phalloidea and the orange receptacle and pinkish receptacle apex in D. callichroa (Möller 1895). Lloyd (1909) described P. moelleri based on a Brazilian species and synonymised D. callichroa with it. All three species are now considered synonyms of P. indusiatus by some authors and Index Fungorum (Lloyd 1909, Fischer 1928, Saénz and Nassar 1982, Calonge 2005, Kreisel and Hausknecht 2009).\n\nPhallus indusiatus was described by Étienne Pierre Ventenat in 1798, based on a specimen from Suriname. In 1809, Desvaux created a new genus, Dictyophora Desv., mainly characterised by the presence of an indusium, a skirt-like structure that expands from the receptacle towards the ground. Ventenat’s species was transferred to Dictyophora and named D. indusiata (Vent.) Desv. Kreisel (1996) considered that the importance of an indusium for the taxonomy of the genus was overestimated, hence he downgraded Dictyophora to a section of Phallus. More recently, with the introduction of molecular data to the systematics and taxonomy of fungi, studies have shown that the indusium is a recurrent character, which independently emerged several times during the evolution of the group (Hosaka et al. 2006, Cabral et al. 2012, Marincowitz et al. 2015, Trierveiler-Pereira et al. 2017). Today, P. indusiatus Vent. is the valid name for Ventenat’s species. Phallus indusiatus is widespread in Brazil, with records from four of the six Brazilian biomes (Magnago et al. 2013), but information concerning its diversity and distribution is still incomplete.\n\nIn this study, we examined the diversity of P. indusiatus-like species in Brazilian Amazonia. We show a clear congruence between detailed morphological data and DNA-based phylogenetic analyses and three new species are described within the Brazilian indusiate clade. These results highlight the importance of more detailed investigation, with the inclusion of molecular information, in Neotropical fungi.\n\nMolecular and morphological analyses, as well as geographical distributions, support the description of three new species within the Phallus indusiatus-like specimens from Brazil, with partially overlapping distributions. Our results suggest that a great number of species might be hidden within the circum-tropical P. indusiatus species concept, since the sequence data obtained from GenBank are clearly polyphyletic with different relationships with other Phallus species (Figures 2, 3). In a similar way, several studies have unveiled cryptic fungal diversity hidden within species complexes, especially after the integration of phenotypic, single-DNA and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data (Geml et al. 2006, Jargeat et al. 2010, Kasuya et al. 2012, Kõljalg et al. 2013, Sousa et al. 2017, Accioly et al. 2019). For instance, Geml et al. (2008) revealed that at least eight phylogenetic species are found in the worldwide distribution of Amanita muscaria (L.) Lam, with strong intercontinental genetic disjunctions and intracontinental phylogeographic structure. Sousa et al. (2017) revealed four species within the pepper pot Myriostoma (Phallomycetidae, Basidiomycota), which has always been considered a monotypic worldwide genus. Long-distance dispersal and cosmopolitanism seems not to be the rule in fungal geographical distribution and, for this reason, there are few species with truly worldwide distributions (Salgado-Salazar et al. 2013). Peay et al. (2016) affirm that climate, environment and dispersal play important roles in shaping fungal communities, where endemism is the most common result in continental and global-scale studies, instead of cosmopolitanism. This becomes clear when analysing the P. indusiatus s.l. distribution. As in all gasteroid fungi – basidiomycetes that produce spores inside the fruiting body – this species has a passive mechanism of spore dispersal (statismospory) (Wilson et al. 2011). Phalloid fungi have developed a peculiar spore dispersal mechanism that depends mainly on insects as vectors for dispersal and this factor, together with environmental conditions, should limit P. indusiatus s.l. geographical distributions, generating the species mosaic observed here.\n\nRegarding the Brazilian indusiate clade, we suggest that species within this group are, in fact, divergent entities that maintained the general ancestral phenotype (P. indusiatus s.l.) throughout their evolutionary history, due to high levels of morphological stasis. This would explain the high frequency of taxonomic uncertainties, which generates a great number of synonyms of P. indusiatus. The maintenance of a conserved morphology due to low rates of phenotypic variation has been widely discussed in evolution (Davis et al. 2014). Two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain the small levels of morphological change through time: genetic and developmental constraints may restrict the appearance of phenotypic variation; or there is strong stabilising selection for a phenotype (Lee and Frost 2002, Geml et al. 2008, Davis et al. 2014). In our hypothesis, because the different species in P. indusiatus occupy similar niches and, therefore, they are in similar environmental conditions, they are likely to experience similar selective pressures. A similar pattern was found by Mueller et al. (2001) in two disjunct and paraphyletic populations of Suillus spraguei (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) Kuntze, that presented no noticeable morphological differences, probably as a result of stabilising selection. For the future, this could be tested for other Phallus indusiatus-like species from other continents and alternative methodologies should be applied, such as ancestral state reconstruction.\n\nWhen studying phalloid species, it is noticeable that macro-characters are more variable than micro-characters. For instance, spores are often cylindrical to bacilloid and smooth throughout the order (except for Gastrosporiaceae), probably as an adaptation for dispersal, since they are dispersed through the gut and do not adhere on the bodies of insects (Tuno 1998, Oliveira and Morato 2000). The presence of rounded crystals in globose cells amongst hyphae of the volva and rhizomorphs was reported for Phallales species (Iofisidou and Agerer 2002), but it is not a commonly used character in species descriptions. Probably these crystals consist of calcium oxalate, as found in other Phallomycetidae species, such as Gastrosporium simplex Mattir. and Geastrum Pers. (Iofisidou and Agerer 2002, Zamora et al. 2013), but further studies about function and composition in Phallus are needed. These crystals are present in most of the species described here, although on different parts: only on the volva of P. purpurascens, only on rhizomorphs of P. squamulosus and on both volva and rhizomorphs in P. denigricans. Further studies are needed in order to evaluate the taxonomic value of the presence of crystals in phalloid fungi. For instance, the presence, shape and the arrangement of oxalate crystals were found to be important characters to delimit species in Geastrum (Zamora et al. 2013).\n\nOn the other hand, macro-characters, such as the shape, surface and colour of the main structures (receptacle, pseudostipe, indusium, volva and rhizomorphs), are important characters for infrageneric classification (Kreisel 1996). In this study, the phylogenetic clades of P. indusiatus-like species were differentiated, based on these features (Table 1), confirming their importance as diagnostic characters. Given that these diagnostic characters are lost once phalloid specimens are dehydrated, it is extremely important that newly described species and new records should be well illustrated with coloured photographs of fresh material. In addition, we believe that molecular data are indispensable for delimiting and describing species in Phallus.\n\nTable 1.\n\nDownload as"
