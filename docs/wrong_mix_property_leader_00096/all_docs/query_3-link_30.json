Climate zone classifications are derived from the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system, which divides climates into five main climate groups divided based on seasonal precipitation and temperature patterns. The five main groups are A (tropical), B (dry), C (temperate), D (continental), and E (polar). All climates except for those in the E group are assigned a seasonal precipitation sub-group (second letter).  Climate classifications are identified by hovering your mouse over the legend. A narrative overview of Sao Tome and Principe's country context and climate is provided following the visualizations.",

A narrative overview of Sao Tome and Principe's country context and climate is provided following the visualizations.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe is located off the west coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea about 300 kilometers off the African coast. The country is an island archipelago of volcanic origin that consists of two islands, São Tomé and Príncipe, and four islets, that are rich in forest and water resources. São Tomé and Príncipe is a lower middle income, developing, small island state. It has an estimated population of 219,161 (2020) people. The country’s economy is based on the agricultural and tourism sectors. The country is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, especially sea level rise which can increase the risk of flooding."
