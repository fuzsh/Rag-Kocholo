        "text": "Sao Tome and Principe has been a multiparty, semi-presidential, democratic system since its independence, and it has been a model for the democratic transition of power in Central Africa. The Independent Democratic Action (ADI) party, which holds 30 out of 55 parliamentary seats, has been mandated to govern from 2022 to 2026.\n\nEconomy\n\nSao Tome and Principe is a small, two-island, lower-middle-income country of approximately 960 square km. Despite its size and remote location, it has a significant untapped natural wealth, including pristine rainforests with a rich and unique biodiversity, which is favorable for nature-based tourism. The country has a young and increasingly educated population. About half of STP’s 225,000 people are under 18 years old, with a secondary school enrollment rate of 89%.\n\nThe country faces structural challenges typical of small, remote countries. Its small size and low population limit the development of large-scale economic activities, resulting in a small and undiversified productive base. Its remoteness and insularity increase trade costs and make it more vulnerable to terms-of-trade and climate shocks. Despite a GDP per capita of about $2,817, the country faces significant socio-economic vulnerability due to elevated poverty, income inequality (Gini index of 40.7), and a lack of employment opportunities. Up to 45% of the population was living on less than $3.65 per day (2017 PPP), the international poverty line for lower-middle income countries like STP. This includes the 15.7% of the population living on less than $2.15 per day.\n\nThe business environment is hampered by underdeveloped infrastructure, particularly costly, unreliable electricity, and fragile institutions, limited connectivity, and high vulnerability to climate shocks. Public finances are strained by the high cost of providing public services due to a lack of scale in the provision of public goods, compounded by low domestic revenue mobilization and declining external financing.\n\nThe country's development has been driven by externally financed public expenditure, but this growth model has become unsustainable due to the structural decline and volatility of grants. To grow sustainably, STP needs to promote a private sector-led growth model focused on improving human capital, infrastructure, and the business environment to unleash its potential for tourism and high-quality, niche agricultural production.\n\nRecent developments and outlook\n\nEconomic activity is estimated to have contracted in 2023 by 0.5% due to the prolonged and aggravated energy crisis, a severe fuel shortage that halted economic activity for two consecutive weeks, and delays in external financing disbursements, partly explained by the longer-than-expected discussions on the upcoming IMF program. The fiscal balance remained in deficit, estimated at -3.6% of GDP in 2023, but it is projected to improve in the medium-term with the resumption of external grant disbursements and the introduction of the Value Added Tax (VAT) in June 2023 at a standard rate of 15% (half for basic goods). Inflationary pressures eased despite the introduction of the VAT, as the Central Bank of STP (BCSTP) tightened liquidity conditions with the resumption of the issuance of certificates of deposit (CDs) in May 2023, coupled with lower global inflation, higher interest rates on T-bills, and subdued domestic demand. As a result, food inflation, disproportionately affecting the poorest, declined from its historical high of 29% in January 2023 to 18.2% in January 2024.\n\nThe current account deficit (CAD), excluding grants, remained large in 2023 due to the higher costs of imported food, fuel, and fertilizers, which more than offset agricultural and tourism receipts (main exports in STP). The CAD is, however, projected to slowly improve as the trade deficit narrows with the drop in the cost of commodities (fuel and food), tourism growth, and fiscal consolidation weighing on the twin deficit of fiscal and external balances.\n\nNet international reserves fell to negative levels in 2023 before being replenished by a $30 million currency swap agreement with Afreximbank, of which $12 million was disbursed.\n\nGrowth is expected to rebound to 2.5% in 2024 and reach nearly 3.6% by 2026, supported by higher tourism arrivals, a strong agricultural sector, and the expansion of infrastructure development projects and energy reforms.\n\nHowever, the economic outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty and downside risks. Delays in the implementation of urgent reforms could further undermine the government's fiscal position and foreign exchange reserves. The reduced availability of external financing, continued disruption of global supply chains, and climate-related events could weaken STP's prospects for growth and further impede poverty reduction.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 03, 2024\n\nTo support STP’s digital transformation agenda, the Digital Sao Tome and Principe Project financed the revision of the country’s legal and regulatory framework for telecommunications, developed and began implementing the National Cybersecurity Strategy and Action Plan, built the capacity of the National Agency for the Protection of Personal Data (including digitalization of its information management and processes), upgraded the national data center, and strengthened the Ministry of Justice’s civil registry and ID management systems. Critically, the project has defined the technical specifications of the future submarine cable to Principe and is currently working on defining the financing and transactional design of the infrastructure. It is also working on implementing an interoperability platform for the government, digitalizing high-impact public services, introducing a digital ID and authentication layer, and establishing a CERT to help defend the country against cyber-attacks.\n\nTo support financial stability, the Institutional Capacity Building Project financed an asset quality review of the banks in STP. As of December 2022, all four commercial banks licensed by the central bank had complied with capital and provisioning requirements, having corrected the deficiencies identified in the asset quality review. The aggregate non-performing loan ratio of the banking sector substantially reduced in 2022 (from 29 to 8% of gross loans), following write-offs of impaired loans. The project has also financed necessary investments in a new IT system and in building the capacity of the tax authorities to manage the VAT system introduced in mid-2023.\n\nIncreasing reliable access to electricity - Sustainable power generation has been one of the chief challenges of STP. Through $28 million in financing from IDA, the STP Power Sector Recovery Project aims to increase the generation of renewable energy and improve the reliability of the electricity supply.\n\nThe preparatory phases of the project related to the rehabilitation of the Contador Hydroelectric Plant and network and metering improvements are nearing completion. Several major studies have now been concluded, including the design study of the Contador Hydropower Plant’s rehabilitation, which looked at innovative solutions to increase the capacity and availability of electricity services, as well as a Least Cost Power Development Plan (LCPDP). Studies have shown the need for additional financing to make the plant more sustainable and keep it in line with STP’s current and future needs for electricity.\n\nHelping coastal communities fight climate change - On average, around 30,000 people—13% of the population—are affected by flooding each year in STP. A wide range of adaptation options, which include protection, accommodation, and relocation, were implemented to reduce exposure to flooding in 12 coastal communities. The West Africa Coastal Areas Resilience Investment Project (WACA) benefits STP and six other countries in the region. Since the completion of construction in most of those communities, households that used to be affected by floods during heavy rains or storms report that their houses and property (including animals, canoes, and stocks of wood) are now protected, with flooding making less impact and floods lasting for a shorter time. Learn more about WACA beneficiaries in STP.\n\nStrengthening health systems and combatting COVID-19 – The Social Protection COVID-19 Response and Recovery Project supported Sao Tome and Principe’s efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to the threat posed by COVID-19 and to strengthen national systems for public health preparedness by providing support in the following areas:\n\nsupporting the government’s goal to vaccinate 70% of the country’s population free of cost.\n\nStrengthening multi-sector, national institutions, platforms for policy development, and the coordination of prevention and preparedness, including the One Health approach.\n\nAs of January 2023, the country had vaccinated 89.5% of its target population (from the age of 12) with at least one dose and 73.2% with two doses of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe Social Protection COVID-19 Response and Recovery Project focused on (i) strengthening the operational capabilities of the government to deliver social protection programs; (ii) supporting the Vulnerable Family Program (VFP)-COVID-19 for six months to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 (covering 16,000 households); and (iii) supporting the scale-up of the regular VFP. The VFP is a conditional cash transfer program targeting poor households, mainly those headed by women, that have at least one child below the age of 18 attending school. In 2023, the VFP expanded its coverage from 2,543 to 2,830 household beneficiaries, with 99% of these beneficiaries being female-headed households. Plans are underway to extend the VFP to 5,000 households in 2024, representing 30% of households in the bottom 40%.\n\nTransport Sector Development and Coastal Protection – The Transport Development and Coastal Protection Project’s road rehabilitation component, linking Sao Tome to the City of Neves, is complete. Work included building new drainage and improving old in selected areas and small-scale interventions to improve the resilience of the road network, based on an analysis of where most accidents occur.\n\nThe World Bank supports statistical capacity-building activities in STP through the components of three projects, worth a total of over $7.5 million: the STP Institutional Capacity Building Project (PRCI), approved in 2018 and closing in late 2024); the Digital Sao Tome and Principe Project (approved in 2022); and the Southern African Development Community Regional Statistical Project (SADC), (approved in 2023).\n\nKey outputs from the PRCI project include: the 2018 household survey and resulting poverty and welfare measurements; the 2020 Enterprise Census; a renovation of the National Institute of Statistics’ headquarters and improvements in communication and information technologies; significant investments in staff capacity, including encouraging the acquisition of degrees in statistics and demography; and improvements to the national accounts’ methodology.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 03, 2024"
