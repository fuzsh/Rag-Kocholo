        "text": "After independence in 1975 São Tomé and Príncipe became a socialist one-party state. The regime nationalized the cocoa plantations and the entire economy. As the country lacked adequately trained people, within a few years the local economy was run down. Due to economic failure, in 1990 the regime introduced multiparty democracy and a free-market economy. Despite political instability provoked by consecutive changes of government, democracy has done relatively well. However, the economy has been ailing, since consecutive governments failed to recover the cocoa sector and diversify the economy. Prospects of becoming an oil producer that emerged in the 1990s have not materialized either, since commercially viable oil has not been discovered. Consequently, for many years the small country has become completely dependent on international aid. The article analyses the archipelago´s politics and economy over the past forty years.\n\nThis Working Paper should not be reported as representing the views of the IMF. The views expressed in this Working Paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of the IMF or IMF policy. Working Papers describe research in progress by the author(s) and are published to elicit comments and to further debate. This paper assesses São Tomé and Príncipe’s monetary and exchange rate arrangements in light of the country’s monetary history and the relevant experience of comparable countries in Africa. The study highlights several structural characteristics of São Tomé and Príncipe including its very small size, high degree of openness, extensive use of foreign currencies, and inflexible product and factor markets in the consideration of an appropriate monetary and exchange regime. Firmly anchored currency arrangements, defined in this paper to include memberships in monetary unions or hard pegs, are found to be preferable to the status quo of a managed float. The pa...\n\nThis book is based upon Maria das Neves de Sousa’s homonymous PhD thesis in social sciences in the area of socioeconomic development, which she defended at the Instituto Superior de Ciências Sociais e Políticos (ISCSP) in Lisbon in 2017. The author is a Santomean economist with a long and impressive professional and political career in her country\n\nThe objective of this research was to identify approximations between the microregion of Itajubá (BR) and the District of Braga (PT) within the scope of economic, social, and sustainable development from the Cultural Economics and Creative Tourism. Data production was carried out on two fronts: census bases of the National Institute of Statistics (INE) and Francisco Manuel dos Santos Foundation (PorData.pt), Portugal; the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), as well as interviews with public managers responsible for the development of culture and tourism in the municipalities involved. The field research evinced the distancing between what is instituted and practiced, which does not inhibit promising examples of the political protagonist of the community ahead of such processes. In both, it is important to overcome: low participation of the community; individualizing practices; verticalization of the development initiatives; corporate organization of the social movements for the generation of income and employment.\n\nSão Tomé & Principe comes of age against a background of racial antagonisms, flaws in the economic and social fabric, and political instability. Whereas the breezes of globalization upon reaching the country are shaking up its insular society, the management and performance of institutions is sorely in need of improvement. This text briefly reviews the archipelago’s postindependence history and attempts to outline various prospects for political development."
