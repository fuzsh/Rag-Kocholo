        "text": "​ JULY IS AFRICA'S WOMEN'S DAY AWARENESS MONTH!\n\n​Event Date: Wednesday, July 31st, 2024\n\n​ ​​Event Time: 17:00 - 20:00 (5 PM - 8 PM) CAT/GMT+2\n\n​ ​​Theme: \"Invest in Education for Climate Resilience: Celebrating African Women Leading the Climate Change Revolution.\"\n\n​ ​About Africa’s Women's Day:\n\n​ ​Do you know that Africa’s Women's Day has been in existence since 1962?\n\n​ ​​Do you know that before America had its First female Vice President (after over 244 years of independence), Africa already had 26 Female presidents and Prime ministers?\n\n​ ​​Do you know that Africa had its first Prime Minister (Honourable Elisabeth Domitien, from 1975-1976) before Britain had Margret Thatcher?\n\n​ ​​The Africa's Women's Day Awareness Team (AWD) focuses on raising more awareness about Africa's Women's Day and spotlighting the legacy of African Women, recognizing their visionary, bold, pioneering historical achievements and contribution to Africa and the world at large.​\n\n​ ​Africa’s Women's Day was proclaimed as a day to be commemorated during the first conference of the Pan-African Women’s Organisation (PAWO) which was held in July 1962 in Dar es Salaam Tanganyika (now known as Tanzania). It offers a national, continental, and global opportunity to recall and affirm the significant role of African women in the evolution of a strong Pan-African identity, with shared values, objectives, and vision for the future, as well as women being key contributors towards achieving Africa’s inclusive growth and sustainable development agenda anchored in the African Union (AU) vision of an integrated prosperous and peaceful Africa.\n\n​ ​​PAWO - the specialized agency of the African Union dedicated to gender equality and women’s empowerment, is a representative organization of women on the African continent with five regional offices in all 55 Member States of the African Union.\n\n​ ​​Its objectives, amongst others, are:\n\n​ ​​To strive to achieve effective and responsible participation of African women in the socio-economic and cultural development of Africa;\n\n​ ​​To pursue the struggle for the representation of women at decision-making levels;\n\n​ ​​To fight for women’s empowerment and the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.\n\n​About Africa’s Women's Day Awareness Celebration 2024:\n\n​How much do you know about Climate Change and its effects?\n\n​ Aligning with the Pan African Women’s Organization’s (PAWO) theme, “Invest in Education: Securing the Future of Women and Girls in Africa.” We recognize education's transformative power in empowering women and girls, shaping their future, and fostering a sustainable continent. This complements the African Union's 2024 Year of Education theme, “Educate an African Fit for the 21st Century: Building Resilient Education Systems for Increased Access to Inclusive, Lifelong, Quality, and Relevant Learning in Africa.” Thus, our theme for 2024, \"Invest in Education for Climate Resilience: Celebrating African Women Leading the Climate Change Revolution,\" underscores the essential intersection between Education and Climate Resilience, highlighting the significant contributions of African Women in leading Climate Change Awareness and Action.\n\n​Education and Climate Resilience:\n\n​ Human activities have drastically altered the environment, threatening our planet’s ability to sustain life. Climate change necessitates immediate and decisive action. The COP28 conference, held last year in the UAE, highlighted the pressing global imperative to address this critical issue. In response to this urgency, the African Union has taken significant strides by formulating the ‘Climate Change and Resilient Development Strategy and Action Plan (2022-2032) which delineates principles, priorities, and action areas for fostering enhanced climate cooperation and long-term, climate-resilient development. It aims to aid the most vulnerable communities and groups, addressing their specific challenges in responding to the adverse impacts of climate change. It also underscores the significance of social inclusion, recognizing the essential roles played by African women, youth, and Indigenous People as catalysts for change in shaping and propelling climate responses across various levels.\n\n​ The importance of educating every African girl and woman with knowledge about issues that affect their life, well-being, and environment cannot be overstated. Climate change poses significant threats to food security, water resources, health, and livelihoods across the continent prompting a crucial need for heightened awareness. Hence, educating women and girls about these impacts and empowering them with the tools to take action fosters a generation of leaders who can drive innovative solutions and sustainable practices.\n\n​ Several key guiding principles of the African Union’s Climate Change and Resilient Development Strategy and Action Plan emphasize the commitment to Leave no one behind and ensure that the initiative is African-led and African-owned. Hence, Africa's Women's Day Awareness team has undertaken the significant responsibility of shedding light on this paramount issue for this year's awareness celebration.\n\n​Objectives for Africa’s Women’s Day Awareness Celebration 2024:\n\n​ Using the powerful tool of technology, our objectives are to:\n\n​ Raise awareness about Africa’s Women’s Day.\n\n​ Highlight African women’s contributions to climate change awareness and action.\n\n​ Promote education's role in building climate resilience.\n\n​ Celebrate African women’s leadership in sustainable practices.\n\n​ Share stories, knowledge, and best practices related to climate resilience and education.\n\n​ Encourage investment in education by raising funds for The Muthoni Gachanja Likimani Foundation.\n\n​ Our commitment aligns with the United Nations SDG4 and the African Union's Agenda 2063 goals 4,7 and 17, promoting inclusivity, sustainability, and gender equality. By harmonizing our voices with those of exceptional African women in this realm, we aim to enhance awareness about the current climate situation and facilitate impactful conversations that provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities associated with this critical issue, thereby educating more Africans on measures to fortify our climate resilience with the assurance that this will galvanize greater numbers of Africans to undertake meaningful actions.\n\n​Activities for Africa’s Women’s Day Awareness Celebration 2024:\n\n​ Throughout the Awareness month of July, 2024, from the 1st to the 31st, we will illuminate the collective influence wielded by 31 African women, highlighting their contributions to fostering climate resilience and promoting sustainable practices. In a world grappling for solutions, these women epitomize the resilience and ingenuity deeply embedded in African heritage. The main virtual event will be on July 31st, featuring:\n\n​A Webinar: With Keynote Speakers\n\n​Storytelling Sessions: Highlighting personal stories of African women leading climate resilience efforts.\n\n​Networking Opportunities: Connecting participants with key figures in climate action and education.\n\n​Expected Outcomes:\n\n​ Increased awareness of the role of African women in climate change leadership.\n\n​ Enhanced understanding of education’s importance in building climate resilience.\n\n​ Greater investment in education initiatives empowering women and girls.\n\n​ Strengthened networks and collaborations among stakeholders in climate action and education.\n\n​ Inspiring stories of African women leading the climate change revolution, motivating broader participation in climate change action.\n\n​ By celebrating African Women leading the Climate Change Revolution, we not only honor their contributions but also inspire broader participation in Climate initiatives. Investing in Education for Climate Resilience ensures that this leadership continues to grow, creating a ripple effect that strengthens communities and enhances the continent's overall adaptive capacity.\n\n​ Meet Our Esteemed Guest Speakers for this event:\n\n​ 1) Mayor Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr OBE, (Sierra Leone)\n\n​ Mayor Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr OBE, the first directly elected female mayor of Freetown, has spearheaded transformative initiatives like ‘Transform Freetown’ since her 2018 election.
