São Tomé & Príncipe

Floating in the Gulf of Guinea, this two-island nation, Africa's second-smallest, blends natural wonders with a gripping history. São Tomé & Príncipe (STP) is amazingly safe and welcoming to visitors, particularly ecotourists, for whom the advancing jungle is a delight. This is particularly true on tidy and unspoiled Príncipe, an island of just 7000 people. A canopy of green broken by spires of primordial rock, Príncipe is a magnificent Lost World, offering fantastic beaches, jungle exploration, snorkeling, fishing, birdwatching and a handful of interesting (if expensive) accommodations. While both islands have their natural rewards, Príncipe should not be missed.
