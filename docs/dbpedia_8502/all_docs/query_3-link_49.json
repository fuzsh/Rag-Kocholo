        "text": "There is some crossover. Both IF and ARGs (Alternate/Augmented Reality Games) are interactive in some similar and different ways.\n\nIF is usually played by a single player who is interacting with a single complete story file (usually in a browser or via download in some type of engine or interpreter). They know they’re reading a story even if they are immersively role-playing a character.\n\nThe main difference with an ARG is the story in some way “spills out” of the normal expected narrative boundaries of traditional media into an alternate fictional “reality” with plot elements or extra lore to be found in the “real world” - or more specifically the game’s “alternate reality”.\n\nMany historical ARGs are quasi-multiplayer, and frequently might not have an obvious entry point. Players often stumble upon the game with an odd link hidden on a website, or by noticing that certain numbers on a movie poster are highlighted which when put together form a phone number they can dial, which might in turn feed the caller a clue where to explore next. The entry point might be a single frame of an online video with a URL that leads to another “hidden” video that many people don’t notice or information may be hidden in HTML site data normal people would never run across. Often the idea is this “alternate reality” is intruding upon the player, often taking the guise of a hidden conspiracy or scavenger hunt. Players might need to research websites that appear real and might need to “hack in” by obtaining a login and password of a fictional character elsewhere. There may be real-world geocaches involved, phone numbers to call, or even a prize someone can find in an actual location.\n\nAn ARG often might include improvisation by the game runners with player interaction, where a player might send an email to an in-game character where it may be actually answered, or they might even be sent a physical artifact or clue. Often communities develop to interpret these clues in cooperation and players may actually find their persona worked into the narrative.\n\nARGs often end after a period of time once the game is communally “solved”.\n\nExamples of ARGs:\n\nBack in the late 90s there was a short-lived commercial game called Majestic where players signed up and agreed to receive potentially menacing phone calls or faxes with clues or characters warning them not to keep researching a potentially dangerous conspiracy theory.\n\nThe movie The Blair Witch Project had a viral marketing campaign which initially was designed with the fiction that the movie was real found-footage and the characters had actually disappeared, and there were hidden websites where the curious could research backstory and secrets.\n\nI Love Bees - a game run by the devs of Halo as viral marketing and backstory for a new game.\n\nMarble Hornets was a stealth YouTube series that started as innocuous guys posting workout videos, but contained terrifying images of Slenderman in the background and became an entire online web series, which included viewers who were able to post and interact with the characters, and some received clues and artifacts sent by the show runners.\n\nYouTuber Night Mind calls these “UnFiction” where a series of videos include clues and rabbit-holes revealing more backstory, and ergodic elements for the audience to find even if it’s not a formal game. Unfiction is sometimes also an alternate moniker for ARGs - usually that involve hidden searchable lore without an extensive game element.\n\nIF, while not strictly an ARG, may include ARG elements such as the recent Wikipedia-esque Excalibur.\n\nPotentially - “claims to be real” in the sense of wresting kayfabe or shared suspension of disbelief - everyone should know it’s not real (hence alternate reality.) Any legit ARG (especially ones that are promotional tools for a movie or other event) wants the participants to know it’s a game to avoid incidents that have happened like players getting the idea that an uninvolved company or website is somehow part of the game and blowing up the customer service number and saying weird trigger-words or trying to brute-force a login or hack a company’s intranet causing actual security issues or harassment. There was also that incident where a group of young girls sadly attempted to actually kill one of their friends following the Slenderman mythos which is no bueno.\n\nI think ARGs usually now have the equivalent of a “credits page” with disclaimers that let players know what the boundaries are and that it’s all in service to a game or a media project. I think there was one that had normal-looking websites but there was some kind of logo/glyph in the footer that confirmed “this is a fictional website and part of the game, so have at it.” Or you pretty much know if you’re hacking into a website regarding activating the Transformers to notify them that Decepticons are arriving on Earth, most people understand naturally it’s not real.\n\nThe original Majestic required a monthly subscription to play with an extensive disclaimer page that let you opt-in to “intrusive” events - “Hey, check this box if you fancy receiving 2am voicemails from an unknown person threatening you if you don’t stop investigating this conspiracy…”\n\nIF doesn’t need to really claim it is false since a player approaches it voluntarily like a book or a movie and you know typing ATTACK TROLL isn’t going to actually cause real-world implications. Part of the appeal of ARGs I suppose is it seems real. Some of the scariest Un-Fiction found footage on YouTube wouldn’t be allowed online if it were real or people start believing it’s real and causing problems, calling the FBI to notify them that a character is being held hostage, etc.\n\nOne of the other forms of ARG and more specifically Un-Fiction is “Supposedly real vlog or channel where fictional events start occurring” that are actually scripted and it’s a stealth web-show such as the original lonelygirl15 - Wikipedia where they spent a long time giving the character a bunch of episodes of very little happening, and then the plot sneaks in the background, then they become episodic content in service to this plot. Also Marble Hornets which started with college guys posting their workouts and people noticed Slenderman standing outside the window completely unacknowledged. Once people started commenting on and noticing that, the characters were like “whoa we didn’t notice this, hey weird things have been happening…” then it morphs into an episodic found-footage style series. Channels such as Markiplier and Jack Septiceye have done arcs like this - they usually do game let’s-plays but will end an episode with a mysterious shadow attacking them or an intruder “taking over” their video that they “won’t remember” but then scatter clues in otherwise normal videos hinting at shenanigans and a hidden plot or lore.\n\nRE Spiderman: Spiderman’s been put on edge at the mention of an ARG I presume? I’m 3 weeks into learning the word “unfiction” which has sent me down this rabbit hole of different types of fiction. While trying to understand the landscape, I’ve learned that mentioning ARG anywhere on a forum makes people upset. This forum had the least aggressive reaction, thanks :). It’s a new world to me though, so I’m just assuming that there must be a reason the topic gets such a strong reaction.\n\nI made a thing, didn’t know how to categorise the thing (i.e I didn’t know who it was for) and I’ve been on a mission to understand where it fits and who would enjoy it ever since. Unfortunately, it still doesn’t fit nicely into anything I’ve found.\n\nThe ARG category is the closest but most examples of ARG’s seem to be glorified point and click puzzle games and ciphers with minimal effort on narrative story. Those being the expectations of the audience, the thing I made would disappoint anyone expecting an ARG. I got excited when I saw Intfiction and although it’s really cool, my thing and intfiction are not a match either the search continues.\n\nSide note: I might be a convert to Intfiction after having found this website.\n\nANYWAY CHECK OUT THIS WEBSITE I FOUND LOOKS WIERD WW… joke, Spiderman would be furious."
