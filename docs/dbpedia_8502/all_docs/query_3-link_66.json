        "text": "This thematic platform provides a rich set of links to resources on alternative forms of storytelling, especially hypertext fiction and digital storytelling. Within this platform there are some connections made to Native American storytelling, and other oral and visual storytelling cultural traditions (such as Chicano Murals) that represent non-linear, non-textual ways of telling stories. In short, the theme of this thematic platform revolves around ways to think of stories apart from traditional print narrative.\n\nOne reason for thinking about new Web-based narrative forms, in the context of other older or non-European narrative traditions is to remember to what extent certain forms or writing which we may think of as natural or inevitable are really conditioned by culture.\n\nThis is important to keep in mind when reading any of the examples of hypertext fiction (non linear and multi-linear narrative) linked from this platform. Hypertext writing (fiction or poetry) is possible only in an electronic environment. Below there are links to numerous sites which will explain what hypertext fiction and hypertext poetry is. There are also sites that tell stories through multimedia and \"mixed media.\"\n\nHypertext writing shares some interesting features with, for example, Native American storytelling traditions: there is a digressive element (stories within stories); what is called \"a story\" is really a Web of stories, and like oral tellings, in hypertext, no two tellings of a hypertext narrative are exactly the same for readers. Naturally there are other key differences that make them disimilar as well. In hypertext fiction the focus is on the reader and the appearance of choice and some determination of how to read, as every part of a hypertext narrative presents multiple choices for the direction and sequence of reading.\n\nWhat you'll find below are questions and links looking at hypertext fiction, poetry, and other multimedia stories and artistic and critical expressions, some of which resist any particular genre of writing we have a name for now.\n\nIf you know of a resource you think should be added to this page, please write and we'll try to add it.\n\n[Images: \"New Media,\" by Jeremy Sutton, and Winter Count Calender, Battiste Good, Sichangu nation]\n\nThere area a lot of ways that stories and storytelling get raised throughout Border Texts, particularly in Chapter Two focusing on \"Stories of the Self and Home.\"\n\nIn many instances, the use of stories and \"narrative\" as a theme in writings in Border Texts, writers are exploring the ways that certain narratives or scripts control or influence one's life, whether it is through the memories of Marianne Boruch's \"The Quiet House,\" or the ironic poetry of Ann Sexton's storybook cliche-busting version of \"Cinderella.\"\n\nSome of the stories in Border Texts also play with narrative form as a way of exploring the multiple stories and influences that shape one's identity, such as in an essay like William Kittredge's \"Home\" or Leslie Marmon Silko's two stories \"Yellow Woman\" and \"Storytelling.\" In both of these stories, which go together, Silko plays with the boundaries of identity at the same time she plays with boundaries of narrative form (see the end of reading questions for \"Storytelling,\" for example, in Border Texts.\n\nFinally, there are selections in Border Texts that stress the visual and \"multimedia\" nature of experience, ranging, for example, from the interspersed memories of home movies in Judith Ortiz Cofer's \"Silent Dancing,\" to the graphic memoir/novel of Art Spiegelman's Maus: A Survivor's Tale. And of course there are the images in Border Visions: A Image Portfolio, with all kinds of images that tell stories in different ways, invoking the fluidity between narrative and visual representation. Look at, for example, \"La Fruta del Diablo\" [Fruit of the Devil], a digital mural in the Chicano Mural tradition, or Pedro Meyer's \"Biblical Times\" and \"Biblical Times Annotated\" [Plates #15 and #16]."
