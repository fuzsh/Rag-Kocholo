        "text": "•\n\nTheodor H. Nelson, a computer visionary and activist first referred to a form of electronic text as hypertext, noting:“ by hypertext, I mean non-sequential writing—text that branches and allows choices to the reader, best read at an interactive screen. As popularly conceived, this is a series of text chunks connected by links, which offer the reader different pathways.”\n\nThe first hypertext fictions were published prior to the development of the World Wide Web, using software such as Storyspace and Hypercard. Michael Joyce's Afternoon, a story (1991) is considered the first hypertext fiction.\n\nIllana Snyder (1997, p.6) described Afternoon as: \"An intricate web of narratives, places, paths and 'yields', that is, words and phrases whose evocative resonances readers can pursue by using a mouse to highlight them on the computer screen. Afternoon is a fiction that changes every time it is read. It invites the reader to circulate digressively among a matrix of characters and events that are never quite what they seem on first presentation.\n\nWardrip-Fruin and Harrigan (2004) described hypertext as “story, performance and game.”\n\nMurray (1997) in Hamlet on the Holodeck, described digital storytelling as \"cyberdrama.\"\n\nThis site contains a Webquest about hyperfiction .\n\nI created a short \"photo montage\" of clips from the Wonderland Research website in order to illustrate some of the postmodern instructional design concepts inherent in hypertext fiction. These concepts include: discontinuity, randomness, multiple options, multiple impressions, open conversations, choices, never-ending, deconstruct, and reconstruct.\n\nFile size warning: photo montage is a large file: 3.8 MB.\n\nForms of Hypertext Fiction\n\nUnsworth (2005) described the following three categories of computer-based literary narratives: electronically augmented texts, electronically re-conceptualized texts, and digitally originated texts.\n\nThe category of electronically augmented texts includes literature that has been published in book format but the books are enhanced with online resources. Some examples include: the Professor Garfield site (which provides educational experiences for students based on Garfield comics) and Fractured Fairy and Folk Tales by Scholastic (which offers online activities based on favorite stories).\n\nElectronically reconceptualized texts include the republication of works that are now out of copyright. Some free examples can be found on the Gutenberg Project , the International Children's Digital Library , the Internet archive , among others. In addition, some sites, like Storyline Online, feature children's books read aloud by actors. Others, like Clifford's Interactive Storybooks feature a familiar story character (Clifford the Big Red Dog) in an interactive tale, where children make text choices and play story-related games. These texts provide a wide range of hypertext situations.\n\nThe remaining categories would be conceptualized as digitally originated texts:\n\nLinear E-narratives: these books are presented like stories found in books:and Dreambox/storybox\n\nE-stories for early readers: These sites use audio and hyperlinks to help young children decode print and pronounce words: Children's Storybooks Online , Learning to Read at Starfall , and Tumblebooks. For the mostpart, these books don't use hypertext except for turning pages and clicking on links.\n\nE-narratives and interactive story concepts: These books are similar to linear e-narratives but have links to factual information and other stories. One example is the. science stories for kids by NASA in which children can access other information about the story topics.\n\nHypertext narratives: These \"pick a path\"stories focus on text for hyperlinks--to the exclusion of most images. Word Circuits is suitable for children and early adolescents. The Brain of Katharine Mansfield is suitable for an older crowd.\n\nHypermedia narratives: These stories use hyperlinks for text and images. The Vasalisa Project reshapes the Russian fairy tale Vasalisa and the Baba Yaga, building a bridge between traditional and new media. Lasting Image uses interactivity through a range of different hyperlinks. In addition, our own Wonderland Research employs a wide variety of text and images as hyperlinks.\n\nSome forms of hyperfiction allow the reader to not only add to the story in a linear way but to provide alternative, non linear pathways through the story. These stories allow the wreaders to choose a variety of paths and write their own nodes/continuous narrative.\n\nSome of these are multiple author continuous tales: About Time , Writer's Window Continuous stories and Hyperstories for children 5-8 , The Neverending Tale , Space_Station_Delta , and The_Last_Tellurian\n\nThis one lets you vote to continue the story Live to Die.\n\nSome also let you construct your own hyperfiction like this one at Education World.\n\nSome people confuse Interactive Fiction (IF) --original text adventure games--as hypertext. Interactive fiction is described as:\n\nComputer-mediated narrative, resembling a very finely-grained \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" story.\n\nThe interactor reads a short textual description (\"You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.\"), and types instructions to the computer (\"enter building\").\n\nThe plot can change based on what the interactor types.\n\nIt has the potential to be more truly interactive than hypertext.\n\nNick Montfort is one of the gurus of Interactive Fiction. Both a researcher and creator of IF texts, a sample of his work can be accessed at Interactive Fiction by Nick Montfort . In addition, more information on IF can be accessed at this Interactive Fiction site.\n\nHypertext vs Traditional Text\n\nResearchers have found the following differences between hypertext and traditional text in terms of reading and writing:\n\nBromme & Stahl (2002) discussed the concept of \"wreading.\" When a readers work with hypertext, they must make choices or rearrange the text. Although this isn't quite writing, it goes beyond simple reading completed with traditional texts.\n\nSamsel & Wimberly (1998) described design structures for hypertext as \"with a spine\" and \"without a spine.\" Hypertexts with a spine have a middle line to which they usually return. In spineless hypertexts, a variety of nodes are placed in a file and endless combinations are possible.\n\nSchmidt (2005) noted that hypertext structure contained all the traditional elements of story except instead of two turning points you have many decision points."
