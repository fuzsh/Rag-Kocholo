The paper book in which you choose the events based on the choices you make?\n\nchoose-your-own-adventure is a name of story series. I guess there are many books like these, but I don't really know what the proper name is.\n\nWhat makes gamebooks and hyper fiction different?\n\nThank you again\n\nPaulQ\n\nSenior Member\n\nEnglish - England\n\nMay 9, 2024\n\n#4\n\nThere appears to be no agreed name for this genre. So far, I have found\n\nhypertext, -> not understood by the majority,\n\ninteractive fiction, -> useful but vague,\n\nnon-sequential writing, -> technical, higher register,\n\nmultiple-storyline book -> somewhat simplistic but likely to be understood.\n\nchoose your own adventure -> very descriptive, somewhat long, the copyright has lapsed.\n\nThere is an interesting article at The Surprisingly Long History of 'Choose-Your-Own-Adventure' Stories that gives some context for some of those terms."
