        "text": "ANY community that has a town crier complete with wig, tricorn hat, red-white-and-blue jacket with brass buttons, knickers and buckled shoes is surely in the spirit of a bicentennial celebration. And that's exactly what Westfield is doing.\n\nTake, for example, the Grand Costume Ball, held on Jan. 22. More than 400 people came, 80 percent of them in costumes, and the grand march was led by the town crier, Sam McCaulley. Many participants were also decked out in knickers and tricorn hats. Of course, there was a share of Addams Family and even New York Yankee costumes, said Linda Maggio, chairwoman of Westfield's Bicentennial Commission.\n\nAnd that was only the beginning. The bicentennial celebration will continue all year, with other events like a concert by the United States Army Band and Chorus, a time capsule ceremony and a heritage play written by the town historian, Ralph Jones.\n\nMr. Jones is also supervising walking tours of downtown, which will include a stop at the town clock. It had not struck the hour since the 1930's, but it has now been restored. Pancakes and Wines\n\nIn addition, the Westfield Rotary Club is planning the Red, White and Blue Bicentennial Pancake Day on March 12. And there are even two \"bicentennial wines,\" which bear Westfield labels, at Peterson's Liquors, the only store to carry them. The wines, however, come from California -- \"a cabernet and a chardonnay,\" Mrs. Maggio said.\n\n\"And our bicentennial shop is thriving,\" Mrs. Maggio said, referring to a gift shop in the business center. \"We are running out of some items and are wondering whether to reorder.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
