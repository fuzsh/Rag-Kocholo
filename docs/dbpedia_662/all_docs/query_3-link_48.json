        "text": "The Westfield Arts Collective, Inc., is a newly-created New Jersey non-profit whose mission is to create an inclusive, community-operated workspace where people with common interests in the visual and performing arts can meet, socialize, and collaborate. Through exhibition, education, performance and community outreach, the Center for Creativity will inspire creativity and enhance people’s lives. Our vision is to create a permanent “Center for Creativity” at the former Rialto Theater in downtown Westfield. The Center is a reimagining of a nearly 100-year-old Westfield institution and will function as a community gathering space for creating and enjoying art. It will be an adaptive space where makers, artists, actors, writers, and musicians of all ages and experience can connect, create, learn and build community.\n\nThe vision and mission of the Westfield Arts Collective, Inc., is to raise the level of creative energy in downtown Westfield, NJ and its surrounding areas, by providing a creative workspace where makers and artist of all ages and experience can connect, create, learn and experience new things together.\n\nThe Tee and Charles Addams Foundation has generously provided initial seed capital for the Center for Creativity and has committed to underwriting future art endeavors, with the intention of eventually endowing the Center with Addams works and funding in perpetuity. The legacy of Charles Addams will live on through the many artists that will benefit from the Westfield Center for Creativity at the Rialto."
