        "text": "The Town of Westfield is making its initial plans to participate in the America250 initiative, which will celebrate the 250th anniversary of the signing of The Declaration of Independence on July 4, 2026. To initiate this effort, the Town has established a logo contest -- open to all Westfield residents and businesses -- to identify a winning entrant that best captures the spirit of the celebration and serves as the face of Westfield’s participation.\n\nAccording to America250, the journey toward this historic milestone is an opportunity to pause and reflect on the nation’s past, honor the contributions of all Americans, and look ahead toward the future that Americans want to create for the next generation and beyond. This nonpartisan initiative aims to engage Americans across the country in designing the largest and most inclusive anniversary observance in the nation’s history.\n\n“Westfield’s participation in America250 is an opportunity to bring the community together to pay homage to our unique and rich history as part of a broader, national celebration,” said Mayor Shelley Brindle. “The creation of an iconic logo to appear on all of Westfield’s Semiquincentennial materials is an exciting first step to obtain community input, generate enthusiasm, and leverage the vast creative talent within the Town. I’d like to thank Westfield resident Julie Diddell for spearheading this effort, and I look forward to joining many communities across the country in celebrating this momentous milestone.”\n\nAll submitted logos should be a reflection of the Town’s rich history and forward-looking spirit, with commemorative and celebratory characteristics, and should include Westfield and America250 by name. The chosen logo will be included on a variety of promotional materials used in connection with the Town’s participation in America250. Submissions will be accepted through September 15 via email at america250@westfieldnj.gov, or through the submission form below, and the winning entry will be unveiled in the fall after a selection process by the initial planning committee.\n\nOnce the logo is selected, the Town will expand the planning committee to reflect a cross-section of Town officials, Westfield residents, business owners, educators, arts and entertainment groups, and nonprofit community organizations. This committee will be tasked with developing a plan for Westfield’s participation in America250 a range of celebrations, as well as heritage, educational, artistic and recreational experiences for the community. A call for volunteers is expected to take place in late 2024."
