        "text": "If you're familiar with Westfield, New York, you're likely familiar with Grace Bedell. As the story goes, Bedell was the reason that President Abraham Lincoln decided to grow a beard.\n\nIn 1860, while living in Westfield, Bedell wrote Lincoln, noting that for him to win the presidential election, he would need to grow a beard. Lincoln took the advice to heart and later visited Westfield where he got to meet Bedell in person.\n\nA statue that commemorates the meeting sits in the center of the town. The story has now been further immortalized with the opening of Grace and Abe's, a new restaurant and brewery located at 14 N. Portage St. in Westfield.\n\n\"We want this to be a place that really plays off of Westfield's heritage,\" said owner Kevin Daughrity. \"When I approached Westfield about the idea two years ago, I reassured them that this was a place where everybody is welcome. It's a place where you and your wife can go out. If some friends after work want to come in, just to relax and have some appetizers, it's perfect for that as well. If you come in with the family, you're going to feel perfectly at home here, too.\"\n\nThe brewery and restaurant, which opened Memorial Day weekend, sits inside a brick building and offers inviting, modern aesthetics on the inside. Square cherry-wood tables are positioned throughout. The brewery's equipment is right on display for patrons to view as they enjoy a wood-fired pizza with a cold craft beer.\n\nThat's part of the reason that Daughrity, who also owns 7 Sins Brewery and Quincy Cellars, wanted to open Grace and Abe's.\n\n\"With how we were doing it at 7 Sins, the customer really couldn't see the equipment, and they could not see what we were doing,\" Daughrity said. \"So we said, 'Let's make this into a full brewhouse experience and expose all of the equipment,' and I'm naturally a foodie, so I thought 'Let's pair the food and beer to make an even better experience.'\"\n\nPreviously, the beer for 7 Sins Brewery was brewed at Quincy Cellars and sold across the street at Sensory Winery. While beer will still be available at Sensory, 7 Sins' entire brewing operation has now been relocated to Grace and Abe's.\n\nBut Grace and Abe's will be brewing more than just 7 Sins' beer. As previously noted, Grace and Abe's plans to focus heavily on history, and so will the restaurant's new line of beers: Abe's Ales.\n\n\"We're just coming up with a brand-new label, and the premise behind it is that we're doing everything pre-prohibition as best as we can,\" Daughrity said. \"We've been doing our research on the history of different beer styles and trying to find the same grains and same hops used back then.\"\n\nSo far, Grace and Abe's had debuted three beers as part of Abe's Ales: the 3XP (a pre-prohibition porter), a Kentucky ale and a California Gold Rush ale. Eventually, they will have a line of six different Abe's Ales and, between that and the 7 Sins offerings, Grace and Abe's should have as many as 20 different beers, brewed right in house, on tap.\n\nGrace and Abe's is also developing a craft soda line for Grace.\n\nWhile the restaurant and brewery is still in its infancy, the response thus far has been strong.\n\n\"It's been huge, and that's a tribute to this town and the support we're getting in the entire region,\" Daughrity said. \"We have been nonstop swamped, and we just got our liquor license this week, so this was before we even had a liquor license. Every day, we are surpassing the numbers I am hoping for, and it's just been great.\" LEL\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nGrace and Abe's\n\n14 N.
