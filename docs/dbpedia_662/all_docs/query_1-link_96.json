        "text": "ABOVE THE BAY OF ANGELS by Rhys Bowen\n\nFrom Rhys Bowen: “In a story that revolves around food and a woman who becomes a chef for Queen Victoria you’d think it would be easy to come up with a menu pairing, wouldn’t you? However, most of the food that was served to the queen was so extravagant, so over the top, that nobody would want to cook it today—certainly not to go along with a book group meeting! Menus included real turtle soup (first catch your turtle), lark and blackbird pie, and creations that included venison stuffed with lobster and other unlikely pairings that would surely make us sick today. So I’m sticking to what Bella does best, and to the dish that brings her praise from the queen herself: her scones. I suggest a traditional British tea party, starting with thin cucumber sandwiches, then the scones served with jam and clotted cream (thick whipping cream will do), and finally various cakes. And of course English tea with milk. It’s a meal that is perfect for meetings as it’s all prepared in advance and can be nibbled at leisure.\"\n\nADAM UNREHEARSED by Don Futterman\n\nEgg Cream\n\nSteak Marengo\n\nHot Dogs\n\nAlso: Beth El Synagogue Book Club, Omaha, Nebraska: In honor of Adam's Bar Mitzvah, we served a dessert buffet.\n\nTHE ADULTS by Alison Espach\n\nMom's Italian Anise Cookies\n\nDirty Martini\n\nTHE AGE OF INNOCENCE by Edith Wharton (see our recipes in The Book Club Cookbook)\n\nTHE AGE OF LIGHT by Whitney Scharer\n\nFrom Whitney Scharer: “In the novel, Lee eats omelets with snipped tarragon, beef bourguignon, scalloped potatoes with gruyere, and oysters.

Jack chooses the menu; cheese soufflés to start, Beef Wellington for the main, and a Pavlova for dessert. I have cooked all these dishes at one time or another, and I know how challenging they are. It’s exactly why I chose them; Jack’s aim is to make Grace’s life as difficult as possible.\n\nIf anyone has ever made a soufflé, they will know how difficult it is to get it to the table before it collapses. Timing is everything, and we can sense Grace’s stress levels rising as Jack does his best to sabotage her efforts by keeping their guests talking when she has already called them to the table. Luckily, Diane steps in, and the soufflés are perfect. The Beef Wellington is less tricky although there is still the problem of soggy pastry under the beef.\n\nLastly, the Pavlova, a delicious concoction of meringue, cream, and fruit. I love both making this and eating it, and getting the meringue absolutely right – crisp on the outside, slightly chewy in the middle – is quite a feat. Luckily for Grace, she pulls it all off. These dishes are rather elaborate for a book club dinner, so I would skip the soufflés, make a beef casserole instead of the Wellington, and keep the Pavlova. Even if the meringue isn’t quite right, the cream and fruit will hide multiple sins. But if you do decide to make all three, please invite me, as they are some of my favorite things to eat\".\n\nBELLA TUSCANY by Frances Mayes: see the author’s recipe in Table of Contents\n\nBEND TOWARD THE SUN by Jen Devon\n\nBENEATH A SCARLET SKY by Mark Sullivan\n\nTHE BENNET WOMEN by Eden Appiah-Kubi\n\nBEST FRIENDS FOREVER by Jennifer Weiner\n\n–Devine Ladies Book Club of Midland Michigan: Key West Florida theme with frozen cocktails, fried plantain chips with dip, Key West Shrimp, Salad, and Key Lime Pie\n\nBET ON IT by Jodie Slaughter\n\nBETTER TO TRUST by Heather Frimmer\n\nBETWEEN ME AND YOU by Allison Winn Scotch\n\nBEYOND HAPPINESS by Dr. Jennifer Guttman\n\nOmi's Orange Pound Cake Recipe\n\nBEWARE THE WOMAN by Megan Abbott\n\nFrom Megan Abbott: \"One food that appears in the book is the Cornish pasty, which is a signature food in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, so maybe pasties or some kind of hand pie. such as empanadas or pierogies.\"\n\nAlso: Carrie's Book Club of Newtown, Pennsylvania: “Baked fish, roasted potatoes green beans, puffy rolls, strawberry syrup, bubbly, rhubarb bitters, Blue Moon ice cream.”\n\nBIG CHERRY HOLLER by Adriana Trigiani:see Adriana’s recipe in Table of Contents: From Breakfast with Anita Diamant to Dessert with James Patterson - a Generous Helping of Recipes, Writings and Insights from Today's Bestselling Authors\n\nBIG LIES IN A SMALL TOWN by Diane Chamberlain\n\n-Also see our BIG LIES IN A SMALL TOWN Recipe Party\n\n-Also see Diane Chamberlain’s Gold Nugget Cake Recipe\n\nBIJOU OF THE DEAD by Robert Freese\n\n–Overdue Book Club of Huntsville, Alabama: Zombie finger cookies and appropriately colored brain matter cookies\n\nBIRDS OF CALIFORNIA by Katie Cotugno\n\nBITTER IN THE MOUTH by Monique Truong: see the author’s recipe in Table of Contents\n\nTHE BIRTHDAY GIRL by Melissa de la Cruz\n\nBLACK BOTTOM SAINTS by Alice Randall\n\nBLACK CAKE by Charmaine Wilkerson\n\nCharmaine Wilkerson: Eleanor's Black Cake, Caribbean Rum Punch, and Jamaican Lemonade Recipes\n\nBLACK KLANSMAN: Race, Hate and the Undercover Investigation of a Lifetime by Ron Stallworth\n\nTHE BLACK SWAN OF PARIS by Karin Robards\n\nBLIND TIGER by Sandra Brown\n\nSalem Crossing of Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Mimosas with mix-ins; strawberry & blueberry simple syrups, orange juice, and a mixed berry beverage.

If your book club wanted to go all out and recreate a meal from archived menus of this ship from the actual time period, you could have a dinner of crème d’ Argenteuil, Halibut en Souchet, and steamed cauliflower with mousseline. This meal appears in the book as the war bride’s first dinner on their first evening aboard, on page 229, and is a dinner that was actually served on the Queen Mary.\n\nCrème d’Argenteuil is asparagus soup. Halibut en Souchet is a poached fish, and you can also do that with a sous vide set-up.Steamed cauliflower with mousseline appears to be cauliflower that has been mashed and seasoned to the consistency of mousse. Or served with a mousse-like sauce. This recipe might be close to that the war brides ate/\n\nThis is a pretty ambitious book club meal! If you’d rather stick to something less complicated but authentic, try serving an English high tea. The war brides would have been likely to partake of one around 4 pm every afternoon. Here is a suggested menu for an English high tea.\"\n\nTHE BRIEF WONDROUS LIFE OF OSCAR WAO by Junot Diaz\n\n–Co-ed Book Club of Greater Boston: Plantains\n\nBRIGHT LIGHTS, PRAIRIE DUST: Reflections on Life, Loss, and Love by Karen Grassle\n\nTHE BULGARIAN TRAINING MANUAL by Ruth Bonapace\n\nBYE, BABY by Carola T.

The eating together is a centerpiece in the story— the way they build bonds and work on seeing themselves as whole and complete, with or without approval from the outside world. It is also what they do communally—from shopping to cleaning up to learning how to cook. Literally, it is the opposite of women cooking and serving food behind the scenes. The group that forms in the novel, The DOD, frequently has dinner together in a semi-self-created family dinner style. Bistec encebollado with tostones (Puerto Rican-style thin steak with fried green plantains) is both the first meal they eat together and a symbol of having some money —beef is not cheap and they are not a small group. It is also a classic Puerto Rican dish not tied to a holiday, but to a little extra cash.\n\nBacalaitos and empanadas are symbolic of comfort food eaten at street fairs, parties, cuchifritos, and other cultural gatherings— they represent the ways Puerto Ricans tried to bring Puerto Rico with them to the Bronx. They are a symbol of the various young women with Puerto Rican backgrounds, including the main characters, trying to hold on to what they have left of their roots in the absence of strong family structures for cultural transmission.\n\nThe desserts and the drinks are a mixture we might call a 'remix' in the Bronx. Things that don't hold fast to rules, but make multiple references at once. The Malibu coconut rum with Coke or coconut water is a drink I make, and might even name Orchard Beach in honor of the beach they –and I— love in the Bronx. It’s an acquired taste, but smooth and tropical in a gritty way. I associate the smell of coconut oil with the beach and hence the coconut rum has a sensory connection.\n\nAppetizers: Empanadas: Beef, chicken, turkey, cheese, or shrimp\n\nCenterpiece: Bistec encebollado (Puerto Rican-style thin steak), served with plantains–the thin steak is classic and appears in the book. Or, serve Bacalaitos (Puerto Rican codfish fritters).\n\nDrinks: Malibu Rum and Coke, or Malibu and coconut water—a twist on Rum and Coke.\n\nDessert: Classic Flan or thinly sliced guava paste with queso blanco on crackers, a favorite in my family for generations. Guava and cheese can also be baked in empanadas, and dusted with confectioner's sugar for pastelillo de guava. And, Skittles and Peanut M&M’s are Grace's go-to stress reducers. so they can be a fun party stash as well.\"\n\nCATCH US WHEN WE FALL by Juliette Fay\n\nCATHERINE THE GREAT: PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN by Robert K.

I don’t recommend that you do what I did –wear vision-occluding sleep shades while trying to cook meals; disability simulations rarely do more than exacerbate the stigma and fear around disability (“wow, this is so hard!”). Sleep-shade training only works because students practice for months at a time. That said, I think it would be fun for a book club to cook some of the same stuff I did while I was under sleep shades: my first victory in blind cooking was a grilled cheese—if you like, try (with your eyes open) sliding a butter knife down the handle of your spatula to confirm tactilely (even if you can see it) that the bread is centered on the spatula before flipping it. The most complex meal I made under sleep shades were both recipes from NYT Cooking: red lentil soup and massaged kale salad! Massaging kale is a wonderfully tactile experience; I think I can in good conscience encourage you to close your eyes as you massage those leaves; awaken your senses!”\n\nAndrew Leland\n\nA COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES by Sarah J.

A simple dish that’s often mentioned in Covenant is kanji --or congee as it might be better known to many readers. The word “congee” is derived from the Tamil word “kanji.” It’s essentially rice porridge. Kanji takes different forms in different countries and even in different states in India, but it’s simply white rice cooked (and slightly overcooked) in excess water (or miso or chicken stock) along with salt, pepper, and ginger. Toppings could include shredded chicken, scallions, bacon, roasted garlic, roasted sesame seed, or steamed fish. Add soy sauce, Tabasco, or chili sauce to personal taste. Papads from the Indian store are easy to make in a microwave and are great to crumble into the bowl like crackers. Kanji is meant to be a simple affordable dish, a full meal. For dessert, ripe plantain, sliced lengthwise and fried in a pan with butter and sugar is a nice touch. To drink (since fresh palm toddy is hard to come by) I suggest Indian beers which tend to have a unique flavor. (Brands like Taj Mahal, King Fisher, or Golden Eagle.)

The original recipe for the pate comes from The Nantucket Table, a cookbook I adore, but I actually really, really love the bluefish pate made fresh by 167 Raw, a fish store and food truck on Nantucket, so I did my best to recreate that recipe for you. Serve it with small, crunchy crackers or smear it on sourdough bread. Should you be afraid of bluefish pate – although it’s delicious - serve lobster salad instead. (But I do like to think that the “smoked” factor of the bluefish is an homage to the Great Fire of 1846.)\n\nFor your appetizer, warm up your favorite New England clam chowder. I imagine that Meg Wright from the novel makes a great one for Benjamin, but feel free to buy yours instead of making it from scratch. Serve this with a Cisco Brewers beer, perhaps the Whale’s Tail Pale Ale.\n\nFor dinner, I’d sear some Nantucket Bay scallops (in season Oct-March; or get whatever scallops you like the rest of the year) and serve them over a hash of Bartlett Farm tomatoes and corn (again, those are island items) with chorizo for smokiness and salt – and as a nod to the many whalers, sailors, and families that arrived on the island from Portugal. You know who likes to go scalloping on the first day of the season in October? Maria and Linley. Serve with a crisp white wine.\n\nFor dessert, make a blueberry pie. Blueberries grow wild on Nantucket starting in late July—and I prefer them to the more traditionally famous berry of the isle, cranberries. Joseph Allen often makes some extra cash by selling the berries right out of his own backyard.\"\n\nTHE DAVINCI CODE by Dan Brown (see recipes and menus in The Book Club Cookbook)\n\nDAY AFTER NIGHT by Anita Diamant: see Anita Diamant's recipes in Table of Contents\n\nDEAR BLACK GIRLS: Letters from Your Sisters on Stepping Into Your Power by Tamara Winfrey-Harris\n\nDEARIE: The Remarkable Life of Julia Child by Bob Spitz:\n\nKC Book Club of Kansas City, Missouri: Boeuf Bourguignon and Mousse Chocolate, a table decorated with butter boxes and empty wine bottles.

Marjorie loved to serve what she called ‘Adirondack Pie’—homemade pancakes with maple sugar, syrup, and whipped cream. It’s not light fare ;)— to her guests up at Camp Topridge.\n\nSince Marjorie gave the world Grape Nuts cereal, I like the idea of using Grape Nuts to make Grapenut Pudding. Marjorie also gave the world Birdseye Frozen Foods, so perhaps working in frozen vegetables or berries to a side dish could be quite apt! Marjorie also owned Jell-O and frequently served it at her dinner parties, so Jell-O would be a perfect choice to add in for a gathering. And Marjorie was very well-known for abstaining from alcohol, so perhaps some fun ‘mock-tails’ that used orange juice or grapefruit juice or lemonade with some non-alcoholic bubbly could be a fun nod to the Hostess with the Most!”\n\nTHE MAGNOLIA PALACE by Fiona Davis\n\nPotage Petite Marmite\n\nAsparagus with Hollandaise ButterCaramel Cake\n\nTHE MAID by Nita ProseFrom Nita Prose: “Readers will find the following items discussed/mentioned/imbibed/eaten in the book: chardonnay, tea, lots and lots of tea, crumpets and jam, raisin bran muffin, The Olive Garden food, but especially the Tour of Italy (see their menu for more details) Many book clubs do an Italian night and recreate The Olive Garden menu items.

The protagonist, Mary Jane Dillard, lives with her tidy, conservative parents who have a framed picture of President Ford hanging in their dining room. The family includes the President and his family in their nightly prayers. Mary Jane helps her mother with dinner each night and then takes her mother’s recipes with her to the Cone house where she’s a summer nanny who also prepares meals. Unbeknownst to Mary Jane’s mother, Dr. Cone is not the kind of doctor she thinks of as “respectable.” Rather, he’s a psychiatrist, and he and his wife have secretly taken in a rock star, Jimmy Bendinger, and his movie star wife, Sheba, for the summer in order to help Jimmy get sober.\n\nMary Jane and Izzy, her five-year-old charge, buy lots of candy for the Cone house. Everyone eats candy necklaces, Screaming Yellow Zonkers (candied popcorn), and popsicles. Mary Jane also buys Slim Jims which Jimmy likes to eat in alternating bites with something sweet. For breakfast each morning, Mary Jane makes what she calls, “Birds in a Nest.” To do this she makes pancakes, cuts out a hole in the center with a glass, cracks an egg in there, and then flips it until it’s all cooked. She uses lots of butter in the pan, lots of salt on top, and serves it with syrup and butter. For dinner at the Dillard house and the Cone house, they have ham, meatloaf, string beans, fried potatoes, chicken a’ l’orange (recipe), and salad.\n\nThe meatloaf is made with onions, diced celery, garlic powder, salt, and pepper added to hamburger meat and then baked in a loaf pan. The potatoes are sliced into discs and fried in Crisco. The salad is an iceberg lettuce wedge with cut tomatoes arranged on top and buttermilk ranch dressing poured over it. For dessert, Mary Jane serves orange sherbet with three Nilla Wafer cookies broken in half and then arranged like a flower in the center of the sherbet. She also serves angel food cake one night. None of the food is organic, olive oil is never used, and there are no grains other than white rice.\n\nTo create the recipes and meal plans in the book, I went online and looked at homemaking magazines from 1975. It was fun reading—I highly recommend it!\"\n\nTHE MASTERPIECE by Fiona Davis\n\nTHE MATCHMAKER'S GIFT by Lynda Cohen Loigman (click for Lynda Cohen Loigman's menu)\n\nAlso:\n\nMy Mom and I of Carmichaels, Pennsylvania: “A smorgasbord!

You could pair Venetian Spritz cocktails with traditional Venetian cicchetti, or small bites, such as mozzarella in carozza (fried cheese sandwiches), baccalà mantecato (grilled polenta and creamed cod), or polpette di carne (meatballs). Similarly, Amie and Ben enjoy a first date of cappuccinos and biscotti.\n\nMuch of the story’s action also occurs in New York City, so perhaps an NYC-themed menu featuring classics such as soft pretzels, bagels and lox, black & white cookies, and cheesecake could be fun.\n\nOf course, anything wrapped in “string” or snacks served in a little box would also be very thematic and a chance to get creative with your culinary skills!\"\n\nMEDIOCRE: The Dangerous Legacy of White Male America by Ijeoma Oluo\n\n\"Anybody who knows me knows that when times get tough, the tough make pudding.

This is what the hospital chaplain, Father Arthur eats every day for his lunch. When Lenni first meets him, it is this fact that she remembers about him. It's a symbol of how repetitive his days are as he sits in the empty chapel hoping someone will come in who needs his help. Next, I would recommend strawberry yogurt. The book is set in the Glasgow Princess Royal NHS hospital and though jelly is often the cliche hospital food, every time I've had surgery I've been offered yogurt and so that detail had to make it into the book. Lenni's favorite is strawberry. Finally to drink—some pear liqueur. Margot drinks this with her best friend Meena. Originally when I was writing I was imagining Meena drinking Midori but it didn't exist at the time so I invented a pear-flavored liqueur that is bright green.”\n\nONE OF THE GIRLS by Lucy ClarkeFrom Lucy Clarke: “ONE OF THE GIRLS is set on the fictional Greek island of Ageos. The women share dishes of tzatziki and glistening olives beneath the Greek sun and drink ice-cold Ouzo or glasses of Prosecco. Eleanor is the biggest foodie in the group and describes her utter pleasure in eating freshly prepared saganaki:\n\nEleanor drew the small plate directly in front of her. It was her favorite – graviera cheese fried in olive oil brought straight to the table with just a squeeze of lemon. It was so freshly prepared that the golden crust still gently sizzled. Using the edge of her fork, she sliced into the crisp saganaki, which oozed with melted cheese. She dropped a corner into her mouth, closed her eyes, and chewed. Salty, lightly zested, a hint of a crust. Utter perfection.\n\nFor food pairing, I'd suggest a meze of the Greek dishes that the women enjoy in the novel, such as stuffed vine leaves, toasted pitas to dip in creamy hummus, a generous tub of tzatziki to slather on hunks of bread, a big Greek salad filled with sun-ripened tomatoes, crisp cucumber and sprinkled with oregano, and of course, melted saganaki. For drinks, it really must be Ouzo or a chilled glass of Prosecco.'Yamas!'\"\n\nONE NIGHT, NEW YORK by Lara Thompson\n\nONE THOUSAND WHITE WOMEN: The Journals of May Dodd by Jim Fergus\n\n(see recipe for ONE THOUSAND WHITE WOMEN and more in The Book Club Cookbook)\n\n–Wednesday Afternoon Lunch and Book Club of Northern San Diego, California: Buffalo burgers, Indian succotash, Country Chicken Stew, mixed field green salad with goat cheese, homemade bread, chocolate cake\n\nTHE ONE THAT GOT AWAY by Charlotte Rixon - click for Book Club Menu\n\nFish Finger Sandwich\n\nGreek food\n\nSex on the Beach Cocktail\n\nGin and Tonic\n\nONLY THE BEAUTIFUL by Susan Meissner\n\nBook Club Girls of Sparta, New Jersey: \"California wine and rich desserts you would find in Vienna.\"\n\nTHE ONLY WOMAN IN THE ROOM by Marie Benedict\n\nFrom Marie Benedict: \"'The Hedy Lamarr' a cocktail created by West Bridge, a Boston bar\n\nOONA OUT OF ORDER by Margarita Monitmore\n\nFrom Margarita Montimore: There are a number of foods and beverages that are featured in OONA OUT OF ORDER.

Food is also a way that we know our loved ones—we know the food our family members love, we know the particular dishes our mother makes. Because A PLACE FOR US is about a family, thinking about the meals this family shared together was a joy and a huge part of the process, and many scenes, be they tender or tense, took place at the dinner table Three items are memorable to me: Mango Lassi was one of my favorite drinks as a child. I would always order it when we went to an Indian restaurant, but I especially loved the lassi my mother would make from fresh mangoes in the summertime. First she would crush the mango flesh into a pulp, then she added milk, sugar, and—if we were lucky—vanilla ice cream. It was a true treat, and so easy to make that I began making it for myself and my cousins. To this day the taste reminds me of summer. Characters are seen drinking lassi a few times. Amar sets lassi out on trays for family friends at his house, wanting to distract himself from thinking of Amira. But my favorite scene with mango lassi is between Hadia and the eldest Ali boy, Abbas Ali. Hadia has had a crush on Abbas Ali since she was very young but has never acted on it. When she is about to move away for college, she and Abbas make mango lassi together for the neighborhood kids who have just finished playing basketball. When he learns which glass is hers, he pours her a little extra. Though he never voices that he has feelings for her too, I always like to believe that he does.\"\n\nPLAINSONG by Kent Haruf (see recipe and menus in The Book Club Cookbook)\n\nPLAY TO WIN by Jodie Slaughter\n\nBiscuits and Sausage Gravy\n\nFish, Veggies, and Cornbread\n\nSweet Tea (+ Vodka)\n\nBologna Sandwich\n\nStrawberry Cake\n\nBologna Sandwich\n\nTHE PLOT AGAINST AMERICA by Philip Roth\n\n–Culinary and Literary League of Trenton, New Jersey: Raisin Noodle Kugel (Jewish Food)\n\nTHE POISON GARDEN by A.J.

It is unlikely it would be white soup as it was more of classic Regency party dish for balls than an everyday food, but there are dinners at Rosings and the Autumn festival, and Marla where perhaps it could have been enjoyed. Since the classic recipes I googled included chicken and things like \"a knuckle of veal\" and I don't eat meat, I took inspiration from some white ingredients from the garden--potatoes, cauliflower, and a parsnip and the almonds in Maria Lucas's wedding cake icing to make my soup.\"\n\nTHE PROMISE OF THE PELICAN by Roy Hoffman\n\nTHE PROOF OF THE PUDDING by Rhys Bowen - click for menu\n\nBerry Tart Recipe\n\nTHE PURSUIT OF ALICE THRIFT by Elinor Lipman\n\n(see our recipes from Elinor Lipman in Table of Contents)\n\n–Dallas Gourmet Book Club: Fudge brownies because Ray, the boyfriend, is a carnival fudge salesman\n\nQUANTUM by Patricia CornwellFrom Patricia Cornwell: \"Captain Chase rarely stops working to have a proper meal, but if she did, she might have a filet mignon, cooked medium rare, with a Caprese salad and a dirty vodka martini.\"\n\nTHE QUEENS OF ANIMATION: The Untold Story of the Women Who Transformed the World of Disney and Made Cinematic History by Nathalia Holt\n\nCork & Olive Book Club of Valrico, Florida: Our theme was, of course, Disney!

Instead of traveling the world, we can do the next best thing and travel a room full of food!\n\nOur first stop is a marketplace in Siam (Thailand, today) and we could pull the dishes right out of the third paragraph of the very first chapter: Steamed Crab Claws and Curried Prawns wrapped in sheets of Bean Curd. Sounds pretty good to me...\n\nOur next stop is Paris, and maybe the French Onion Soup that her mother cooks for her that fateful night is in order, her last meal at home. Since our taster trays are largely finger foods, we’ll keep it simple: pastry stuffed with Duck Liver Pate, perhaps, and a crepe topped with butter and powdered sugar for dessert.\n\nAs we travel the room, we soon find ourselves in North Africa. Shakshouka is my personal favorite, but why not include Pastilla in bite-sized pieces or a bowl of Tagine with Preserved Lemon?\n\nWe travel by train across Russia. In one scene, Aubry is offered bread, and though I imagined wheat bread in the book (better to show off the drops of blood that soak through it when she takes a bite), I’d probably go with Russian Black Bread for our taster’s menu, good to soak up the last drops from the bowls of Borscht.\n\nHalfway through the book and we are in India, in a palace where Ulavacharu is served, a spicy lentil soup, but let’s not stop there. Let’s also include Pav Bhaji, perhaps some Samosas, all washed down with a cup of Masala Chai.\n\nAubry then describes her adventures on the Tibetan Plateau. Here, in such a cold dry land, gardens are rare and the food is all meat and milk. Here, we can treat ourselves to thinly sliced yak meat simmered in broth, served with Chhurpi, a popular Tibetan cheese, and a cup of Butter Tea.\"\n\nSamosas\n\nCrepes\n\nTagine\n\nOnion Soup\n\nSHOULDER SEASON by Christina Clancy\n\nTHE SHOW GIRL by Nicola Harrison\n\nThe Show Girl Recipe Party\n\nNicola's Menu and Maple Bee's Knees Recipe\n\nTHE SICILIAN INHERITANCE by Jo Piazza\n\nFrom Jo Piazza: \"When I set out to write THE SICILIAN INHERITANCE, I wanted to write the most delicious book I had ever read.

Food is love and nurturance for him. He spends his childhood cooking with his beloved mother Mimi. Feeding people delicious meals is the way he knows how to connect. And the novel itself is so much about the ways in which we are all interconnected and interdependent. Theo goes off to Buenos Aires (running away from his family and from himself) and trains as a chef while there. So perhaps Asado (otherwise known as barbecue) accompanied by a bottle of good Argentinian Malbec. What is most important is to gather, in the way that book clubs allow us to do, and talk about the contents of our hearts.\"\n\nTHE SILENCE OF THE GIRLS by Pat Barker\n\nTHE SILVER STAR by Jeanette Walls\n\nRead and Feed of Denver, Colorado: Pringles, Cheetos, and Chicken Pot Pies\n\nSISSIE KLEIN IS COMPLETELY NORMAL by Kris Clink\n\nSISTER OF MY HEART by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni see the author’s recipe in Table of Contents\n\nAlso Falmouth Newcomers Falmouth, Massachusett: appetizer of nuts roasted with chili (chat), tandoori chicken salad, raita, coconut rice, and yogurt pie.\n\nSIX DAYS IN ROME by Francesca Giacco\n\nSee Francesca's recipes for Negroni Sbagliato and Spaghetti allacciughe (pasta with anchovies)\n\nBookish Ladies Book Club of Coto de Caza, California: We enjoyed Aperol Spritz cocktails, a charcuterie board, tiramisu, and wine-soaked grapes”.\n\nReading is My Cardio, Smithfield, Rhode Island: Italian-themed cocktail party featuring charcuterie, Aperol Spritzes, and a gelato bar for dessert.\n\nNext Chapter, Leesburg, Virginia: Aperol Spritz cocktails, a charcuterie board, tiramisu, and wine-soaked grapes.\n\nTHE SIXTEEN PLEASURES by Robert Hellenga\n\n–Literai Society of Greensboro, North Carolina: Italian bread, cheese, and pastries\n\nSKIPPING CHRISTMAS by John Grisham\n\n–The Ladies of Autumnwood of Grand Island, New York: Personal-sized pizzas (as a contrast to the normal Christmas dinner\n\nSMALL MERCIES by Dennis Lehane\n\nMystery Book Club of the North Shore, Massahcusetts: Pot roast, Fried Clams\n\nSMALL THINGS LIKE THESE by Claire Keegan: Claire Keegan's Christmas Cake recipe\n\nSNOW FALLING ON CEDARS by David Guterson (see recipe and menus in The Book Club Cookbook)\n\nSNOW FLOWER AND THE SECRET FAN by Lisa See: see author recipe from Lisa See inThe Book Club Cookbook\n\nSO WE MEET AGAIN by Suzanne Park\n\nAlso see Suzanne's Korean Mandu (Deep Fried Dumplings) Recipe:\n\nAlso: The Ridgeway Country Club Book Club of Memphis, Tennessee: Passed Hors D'oeuvres: Nashville Hot Chicken Bites and Korean Chicken Bites; First Course: Korean Mandu ; Second Course: Korean Beef Bulgogi; Japchae with Korean Glass Noodle Stir Fry; Third Course: Millionaire's Twinkie (Dolly Parton's favorite dessert)\n\nSOBREMESA: A Memoir of Food and Love in Thirteen Courses by Josephine Caminos Oria\n\nSOIL The Story of a Black Mother's Garden by Camille Dungy\n\nFrom Camille Dungy: “During 2020, when I was home with my family, I felt like I was almost always either in the kitchen or the laundry room. My garden was one of the few places where I could escape. A lot of the food I describe cooking in the book is actually wild game acquired from hunter friends. Elk or pronghorn seasoned with sage, dried juniper berries, and a bit of cedar smoked salt. Probably not ingredients that are easily accessible for most people. But I also describe a green garden tomato pizza I made towards the end of summer that I find quite tasty. I imagine it would be easy to serve in appetizer portions like a flatbread. I used a premade cauliflower crust for myself and a homemade pizza crust for my husband and daughter. A thin layer of pesto (homemade or store-bought; a layer of sliced green tomatoes (you can also substitute green apples or red tomatoes depending on whether you want more sweet or more tart); feta cheese; a sprinkling of fresh or dried rosemary. I love to add Kalamata olives but I’m the only one who likes them in my family. I don’t need this to be super cheesy, but if that’s your preference, go ahead and include some mozzarella cheese. Bake in the way you typically bake homemade pizza. Slice and enjoy.”\n\nSOLD ON A MONDAY by Kristina McMorris\n\nSee Max's Manhattan Cocktail recipe\n\nAlso see recipes, for cocktails, appetizers, dessert and more in the Sold on A Monday reading guide\n\nSOMEBODY'S HOME by Kaira Rouda\n\nSOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE by Lyn Liao Butler: Mai Tais, Malasadas, and Tropical Fruit\n\nAlso see: Tsunami Fries\n\nSOMEONE ELSE'S SECRET by Kaira Rouda\n\nSOMEONE ELSE’S SHOES by Jojo Moyes\n\nBookClubbers of Cranston, Rhode Island: Lamb Stew, Victoria Sandwich\n\nSOTAH by Naomi Ragen\n\n–Hudson Valley Bookies of New Winsor, New York: Matzo ball soup\n\nTHE SOULMATE by Sally Hepworth (click for menu)\n\nAlso: Sticky date pudding\n\nCoq au Vin\n\nPaella\n\nRoast Chicken\n\nAlso: The Reckless Readers, Eastford, Connecticut: Soulmate bars peanut butter & jelly- the ultimate soulmate of food!

Sometimes, if I was eating with my family, we’d get garlic fries and fried clam strips to share. My sister has a mango tree in her yard—in the summer that’s my favorite dessert—so I suggest ending the meal with a fruit salad: mango, blueberries, a little mint.

To accompany a book club gathering, I’d suggest serving a delicious tajine (perhaps made with lamb for meatlovers or with a selection of mediterranean vegetables for vegetarians). This richly flavored, slow-cooked stew is best served with some plain couscous and a traditional Arabic tomato and cucumber salad.\n\nAfterward, some of Kenza’s ghoribas —little soft cookies flavored with orange zest and honey— would be the perfect way to round off the evening. They would go well with some fresh mint tea for an authentic taste of Morocco.\n\nTHE STORM CHASERS by Jenna Blum: Rommegrod: Norwegian Pudding and the author’s recipes in Table of Contents\n\nTHE STORY OF ARTHUR TRULUV by Elizabeth Berg\n\nAlso: Newly Revisioned Bookclub, St. Albans, Vermont: “Per your suggestion, we enjoyed hotdogs, and made Orange Blossom Cookies in honor of Lucille.”\n\nSTRANGERS IN BUDAPEST by Jessica Keener\n\nSTREET CORNER DREAMS by Florence Reiss Kraut - click for menu\n\nHappy Bookers of Linn Missouri: Anna’s uncle Tony’s deli-inspired bread, salami, and Swiss cheese.\n\nSUGAR by Bernice McFadden: see recipe in The Book Club Cookbook\n\nTHE SUITE SPOT by Trish Doller (click for Trish Doller's menu)\n\nSUMMER AT THE CAPE by RaeAnne Thayne\n\nSUMMER AT TIFFANY by Marjorie Hart\n\n–WOW (Women of Words) of Green Valley, Arizona: Egg salad sandwich\n\nSUMMER HOURS Amy Mason Doan\n\nTHE SUMMER LIST by Amy Mason Doan\n\nA SUMMER TO REMEMBER by Erika Montgomery\n\nSWEETBITTER by Stephanie Danler\n\nA SWEET MESS by Jayci Lee\n\nSWEET SALT AIR by Barbara Delinsky\n\nThe Bookends Book Club of Wakarusa, Indiana: Clam Chowder, Passion Flower Tea (grown on Quinnipeague), Molasses Indiana Pudding, and of course, pie!\n\nTHE SWEET SPOT by Amy Poeppel\n\nFrom Amy Poeppel: \"Time for tapas and sangria! The Sweet Spot is all about gathering with people who may be strangers at first but who could well become close friends if you're willing to welcome them into your life. Melinda is having a hard time getting along with people after her husband of thirty years leaves her for a much younger woman. But when a bartender from a neighborhood dive bar invites her to his house for dinner, the evening changes her whole outlook. As she chats with people she's never met before over a table of shared tapas—think small dishes of sardines, olives, sausage, patatas bravas, garlic shrimp, and grilled bread with Manchego cheese and prosciutto— and a big pitcher of sangria, Melinda finds herself having a marvelous time. (End the evening on a sweet note with flan! Here's my favorite sangria recipe from the New York Times.\n\nTHE SWEET TASTE OF MUSCADINES Pamela Terry\n\nFrom author Pamela Terry:\n\n\"I can't think of anything better to serve with The Sweet Taste of Muscadines than Southern biscuits and jelly.
