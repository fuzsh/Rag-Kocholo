Glenn Kilmer and Golden (Goldie) L. MacDonell, two Brantford high school teachers, purchased 30 acres in October, 1960 at the site which later became Westfield heritage Village. They envisioned a unique project which would develop a pioneer village as a non-profit educational institution to preserve and present the 19th century rural life in Upper Canada. Their vision became a reality when Westfield was officially opened to the public on June 15, 1964.\n\nWestfield Heritage Village is now owned by the City of Hamilton and managed by the Hamilton Conservation Authority."
