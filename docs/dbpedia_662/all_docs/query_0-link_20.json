        "text": "This year is the 50th Anniversary of Westfield Heritage Village. The village, containing over 30 historic buildings on a 3.4 square kilometre site, is located just west of Rockton, Ontario, Canada between Cambridge and Hamilton.\n\nIt is not hard to see the passion and imagination is still as alive now as it was when the Village was created 50 years ago. Buildings have lovingly been restored and furnished to match the period of the day. There are churches, shops, a school house, sawmill, a farm and even a house from one of my ancestors.\n\nThe Misener House was donated by the Misener family from it’s original location in Troy, Ontario. The home was built in 1832 by Conrad Misener. Conrad and I share a common ancestor in his father and my 7x great grandfather Adam Misener. Per records I found online, descendants of Conrad’s chose to donate the house to the village after it was inhabited for over 100 years.\n\nThe Misener House in the Westfield Heritage Village per the virtual museum “The house itself is a simple, humble, post and beam building from 1832. It was made with local lumber sawn in the Misener’s own mill on Fairchild’s Creek.”\n\nTrain enthusiasts have lots to see and enjoy as well. A train station originally built in 1896 has been moved to the village from nearby Jerseyville; a locomotive is on site and a steam powered wagon will take visitors on tours around the village.\n\nMy father and his tractor club were invited to join in the Volunteer celebration over Father’s Day weekend and he asked me to come along. The Rockton Antique Tractor and Hobby Club brings in antique tractors and farm equipment that not only go on display but parade around the village, much to the delight of young and old. Even though my father’s tractor isn’t the oldest, his smile as he drives it around the central square might be the biggest of the bunch.\n\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary, a tree was planted in front of the school house. The evening celebration was centered around the square in the centre of the village. The central gazebo was adorned with lights and dominion decorations, live bands were brought into perform including The Ever-Lovin’ Jug Band who put on a fantastic show. The General store was selling fresh baked cookies and traditional candy and it was all capped off with an amazing fireworks show.\n\nMy iphone trigger finger was happy to be involved in the festivities as the light was phenomenal. Even my neice got involved by using her ipod to snap some shots and we both loved comparing notes over the images we captured. The team at Westfield really put on a great party which was no surprise considering all the time and care they put in to running the village every week.\n\nWestfield Heritage Village is located at 1049 Kirkwall Road (formerly Regional Road 552), off Highway 8 in Rockton. Westfield is open Sundays and holidays from 12:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. April to October. Special events run from March to December, hours may vary."
