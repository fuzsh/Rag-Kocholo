        "text": "Japanese casual-wear designer, manufacturer and retailer\n\nUniqlo Co., Ltd. (株式会社ユニクロ, Kabushiki-gaisha Yunikuro) ( YOO-nee-kloh;[1] Japanese pronunciation: [jɯnikɯɾo]) is a Japanese casual wear designer, fast-fashion manufacturer and retailer.[2] The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Fast Retailing Co., Ltd.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nOrigins in Japan\n\n[edit]\n\nA Yamaguchi-based company, Ogori Shōji (which, until then, had been operating men's clothing shops called \"Men's Shop OS\") was founded in March 1949 in Ube, Yamaguchi.[4]\n\nOn 2 June 1984, it opened a unisex casual wear store in Fukuro-machi, Naka-ku, Hiroshima, under the name \"Unique Clothing Warehouse\".[5] Initially, the brand was going to be registered as a shortened contraction of \"unique clothing\".[6] However, in 1988, during administration work in Hong Kong for registering the brand, the \"C\" in the contracted name was misread as \"Q\". Tadashi Yanai, the head of the family retail conglomerate, liked the sound of the error and shortened the name to \"Uniqlo\" across Japan.[7][8] In September 1991, the name of the company was changed from \"Ogori Shōji\" to \"Fast Retailing\", and by April 1994, there were over 100 Uniqlo stores operating throughout Japan.[citation needed]\n\nPrivate-label strategy\n\n[edit]\n\n1997-2005: Early strategies\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1997, Fast Retailing adopted a set of strategies from American retailer The Gap, known as \"SPA\" (for specialty-store/retailer of private-label apparel), meaning that they would produce their own clothing and sell it exclusively.[citation needed] They engaged the retail brand consultancy, CIA, Inc./The Brand Architect Group, to guide the company through the realization of this strategy, including consulting on merchandise, visual merchandising and display, store design and a new logo designed by Richard Seireeni and Sy Chen of The Brand Architect Group's Los Angeles office.[citation needed] Uniqlo had begun outsourcing their clothing manufacturing to factories in China where labour was cheap, a well-established corporate practice.[citation needed] Japan was in the depths of a recession at the time, and the low-cost goods proved popular.[9] Their advertising campaigns, clothing quality and new retail layouts also proved fruitful.[10]\n\nIn November 1998, it opened their first urban Uniqlo store in Tokyo's trendy Harajuku district, and outlets soon spread to major cities throughout Japan.[citation needed] In 2001, sales turnover and gross profit reached a new peak, with over 500 retail stores in Japan.[citation needed] When Uniqlo decided to expand overseas, it separated Uniqlo from the parent company,[1] and established Fast Retailing (Jiangsu) Apparel Co., Ltd. in China. In 2002, their first Chinese Uniqlo outlet was opened in Shanghai along with four overseas outlets in London and Basingstoke England.[citation needed]\n\n2005-2012: Overseas expansion\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 1 November 2005, Fast Retailing transferred the business related to clothing manufacturing and retailing to Sun Road Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary that operated golf courses through a company split (absorption-type split), and became a holding company. On the same day, Sun Road changed its name to Uniqlo Co., Ltd.\n\n2005 saw more overseas expansion, with stores opening in the United States (New York City), Hong Kong (Tsim Sha Tsui) and South Korea (Seoul), their South Korean expansion being part of a joint venture with Lotte.[citation needed] As of year-end 2005, in addition to its overseas holdings, Uniqlo had around 700 stores within Japan.[citation needed] By 2006, sales were $4 billion.[1] By April 2007, the company had set a global sales goal of $10 billion and a ranking among the top five global retailers, joining what at the time was Gap, H&M, Inditex and Limited Brands.[1]\n\nFast Retailing signed a design consulting contract for Uniqlo products with fashion designer Jil Sander in March 2009.[11] Sander was appointed creative director of the brand's menswear and womenswear – as well as launching a new label, +J collection, which won the 2011 Brit Insurance Design Fashion Award.[12]\n\nShiatzy Chen was approached by Uniqlo to produce a capsule collection of ready-to-wear pieces to launch in November 2010.\n\nUniqlo first opened its roadside store in Japan in 1985 and it has now many roadside stores in Japan and five other countries in South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines and Malaysia.[13]\n\nOn 2 September 2009, Fast Retailing announced that the company would target annual group sales of 5 trillion yen (approx. US$61.2 billion) and pretax profit from operations of 1 trillion yen (approx. US$12.2 billion) by 2020. This means that the company is aiming to become the world's biggest specialty retailer of private label apparel with a continuous growth rate of 20% per year. The figure breaks down as one trillion yen from Uniqlo's Japan business, three trillion yen from its international business, and one trillion yen from \"Japan-related and global brand business.\"[clarify] The company's international business target breaks down as one trillion yen in China, one trillion in other Asian countries and one trillion in Europe and the United States.[14]\n\n2012-present: Collaborations\n\n[edit]\n\nOn September 27, 2012, Uniqlo, collaborated with Japanese tech retailer Bic Camera, to open a store in Shinjuku called Bicqlo.[15] It opened at the former site of a Mitsukoshi department store. The store is now a regular Bic Camera store after Uniqlo sold its lease of the building on June 19, 2022.\n\nLaunched in January 2017, \"Art for All\" was a partnership with New York art dealer and curator Jeffrey Deitch. The project involved selling, for under $100 per item, 65 limited-edition products made by commissioned artists such as Marie Roberts, Starlee Kine and Ken Kagami.[16]\n\nBeginning in 2017, Uniqlo has collaborated with designer Johnathan Anderson on multiple menswear collections.[17] As of 2023, the designer is still working with Uniqlo on limited collections.[18]\n\nIn late 2017, Uniqlo debuted a line of 3D knit garments, developed through a joint venture with knitwear machine company Shima Seiki.[19] The technology allows a garment to be knit in one piece with minimal waste and no seamlines. It also allows for a finer level of shaping and fit compared to classic knitwear production techniques.[20] As of 2023, Uniqlo is still selling 3D knit pieces.[21]\n\nIn October 2018, Uniqlo collaborated with designer Alexander Wang to create a line of Heattech layerable basics including tank tops, leggings, underwear and bodysuits.[22]\n\nOn 3 June 2019, artist and recent Dior Homme collaborator KAWS participed on KAWS x UNIQLO UT. \"Perhaps because all the other collections were the subdued Uniqlo trademark, KAWS’s subversive art was able to stand out all the more.\"\n\nIn November 2022, Uniqlo opens a new remake and repair service in Tokyo. Re. Uniqlo Repair Studio, offers same day repairs and custom remakes of clothing purchased at Uniqlo. It is open for a trial run until 31 March 2023.[23] This was previously introduced at stores in Germany, the UK and US.[24]\n\nOn 16 August 2023, Uniqlo announced a line with designer Clare Waight Keller, former creative director of luxury brands Chloé and Givenchy.[25] The 34-piece fall collection launched in September 2023 across 1,500 stores globally as well as online.[26]\n\nLogo\n\n[edit]\n\nFormer Uniqlo logo used from 1997, continued to be used alongside the current logo in Japan until 2009.\n\nCurrent Uniqlo logo used since November 2006.\n\nInternational operations\n\n[edit]\n\nBy August 2023, the company forecasts it will operate 3,747 stores worldwide.[27][28]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nUniqlo opened its first Australian store in Melbourne in April 2014.[29] It expanded into Queensland the following year, with the introduction of two shops in Brisbane.[29] Uniqlo opened a shop in Chadstone Shopping Centre in Melbourne, Victoria, the largest shopping centre in the southern hemisphere, in October 2016 when it was redeveloped.[30] Uniqlo opened its first store in the Australian capital Canberra on 26 October 2023 in Canberra Centre.[31] As of 11 June 2024, there are 38 stores in Australia including in Perth, Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Gold Coast and Canberra.[32]\n\nBelgium\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first Belgian Uniqlo store opened in October 2015 at Meir, Antwerp.[33] A second store followed at the Wijnegem Shopping Center on 25 March in the same year.[34] 19 October 2017 saw the opening of a third store in Brussels.[35] Uniqlo store in Wijnegem Shopping Center has closed in 2022.[36] There were 3 stores in Belgium as of May 2023.[28]\n\nCanada\n\n[edit]\n\nUniqlo opened their first Canadian outlet at the Toronto Eaton Centre on 30 September 2016, followed by a second outlet at the Yorkdale Shopping Centre on 20 Octobers 2016.[37] Measuring at 28,000 and 24,000 square feet, both outlet are five times the size of the Muji outlet that opened in Toronto in 2014.[38] Three new Ontario outlets opened in 2018 at Vaughan Mills, CF Markville and Square One Shopping Centre.[39] The first Oshawa outlet opened at the Oshawa Centre in March 2019 and the first Newmarket outlet opened at the Upper Canada Mall in April 2019, bringing the total number of Ontario outlets in to seven.[40] The first British Columbia and Western Canada outlet opened at Burnaby's Metropolis at Metrotown in October 2017,[41] followed by Surrey's Guildford Town Centre[42] and Richmond Centre[43] in Richmond, BC.

In response, Uniqlo unsuccessfully sued the weekly's publisher, Bungeishunjū, for ¥220 million for libel.[52][53]\n\nA 2015 online video of a couple having sex in a Beijing Uniqlo store changing room became notorious among Chinese internet users. Chinese police arrested at least five people in connection with the incident, allegedly including the couple and three other disseminators of the video, for having 'severely violated socialist core values'.[54] The New York Times noted that the store's exterior had become a popular venue for people to gather and take pictures in sexual poses reminiscent of the video.[55]\n\nDenmark\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 2019, Uniqlo opened its first Danish flagship store in Copenhagen at Strøget.

The store covers 760 square meters on two floors.\n\nAs of May 2024, there are 23 stores in Vietnam.[28]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2015, a number of labor rights violations were reported at Uniqlo suppliers in China.[119][120][121][122] Uniqlo pledged to remedy the violations.[123][124]\n\nIn June 2015, Chinese Uniqlo factory demonstrated after a factory closure, with support from the Hong Kong-based activist group Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour (SACOM).[125][126]\n\nIn November 2015, investigations into the measures Uniqlo introduced in the wake of the January 2015 revelations found that the remedies had been only partially successful, with significant violations continuing to occur.[127][128]\n\nIn October 2016, the report This Way to Dystopia: Exposing UNIQLO's Abuse of Chinese Garment Workers[129] by SACOM and War on Want claimed that it was still the case that \"excessive overtime, low pay, dangerous working conditions and oppressive management\" were common in Uniqlo factories in China and Cambodia.\n\nIn 2019, a number of Australian workers reported that bullying and harassment is rife, there were \"shouting rooms\", and a toxic work culture. They claimed they had to work 18-hour days, had to fold seven shirts per minute, and that everyone leaves with \"some form of PTSD\".[130][131]\n\nAlso in 2019, an international Uniqlo advert was uniquely subtitled for the South Korean market in a manner widely perceived there to have trivialized the trauma of comfort women.[132][133][134][135]\n\nIn January 2021, Uniqlo shirts were blocked at the US border over concerns of violations related to a ban on cotton products produced in the Xinjiang region of China due to reports of forced labour. A protest was filed by Uniqlo's parent company Fast Retailing, but was denied.[136]\n\nAt the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Fast Retailing initially decided to remain in the Russian market, saying that clothing is a \"necessity of life\".[137] Following backlash, on 10 March 2022 the company announced to stop operating in Russia, citing \"a number of difficulties, including operational challenges and the worsening of the conflict situation.\"[138]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
