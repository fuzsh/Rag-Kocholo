        "text": "IndyStar is highlighting returning girls soccer players to watch by position before unveiling the 2024 preseason ALL-USA Super Team next week.\n\nToday's position group: Defenders.\n\nIHSAA girls soccer: Indy-area's top goalies to watch in 2024\n\nThis list was compiled prior to tryouts. Some players may have opted out of high school soccer to play academy.\n\nAderinoye Adewopo, Avon\n\nA senior, Adewopo will lead the starting back line alongside Madison Haggard. They were part of a group last season that allowed 24 goals in 17 games.\n\nSadie Black, Noblesville\n\nBlack clocked 1,273 minutes over 21 games for the Class 3A state champion Millers, who allowed only 14 goals and finished the season ranked third nationally by MaxPreps. The senior scored her first career goal in the regional semifinal vs. Fort Wayne Northrop.\n\nJaicee Cole, Mt. Vernon\n\nCole made a name for herself as a sophomore, holding her own against a number of the state's top attackers. She was a critical contributor for a Marauders squad that allowed 15 goals over 16 games. Cole scored twice and registered a pair of assists in a rout of New Castle last August.\n\nSydney Cook, Hamilton Southeastern\n\nA Purdue commit, Cook appeared in 18 games for the Royals, aiding a backline which conceded only nine goals and shutout four of its first five opponents.\n\nArriana Cooke-Dennis, Westfield\n\nCooke-Dennis, a junior, was a staple at center back for the Shamrocks, who gave up only six goals during the regular season. She clocked 1,121 minutes over 17 games and registered five shots on goal in her first varsity season.\n\nAddie Crowe, Center Grove\n\nCrowe played a key role in the Trojans' recovery from an 0-3 start last season, leading a defense which allowed only 16 goals over a 6-2-5 run to finish out the season. The second team all-state pick also scored a goal in a 6-0 win over Franklin.\n\nPaige Dill, Park Tudor\n\nDill kicks field goals for the football team and is a tremendous two-way defender for the two-time defending state champion Panthers. She was part of a unit which conceded only 11 goals, and contributed 18 goals and nine assists to a high-powered attack that racked up 80 goals over 21 games.\n\nBecca Engel, Roncalli\n\nA speedy two-sport standout, Engel's size and speed makes her a dangerous threat out of the Royals' end. She was part of a defense which allowed 28 goals, and chipped in a couple goals and an assist in her first varsity season.\n\nJaelyn Gardner, Plainfield\n\nA high-end athlete, Gardner is one to monitor at the attacking outside back position. The two-year varsity starter has 11 goals and four assists through two varsity seasons (five goals, one assist as a sophomore), and aided a Quakers defense which allowed only 21 goals.\n\nMia Gatz, Guerin Catholic\n\nThe state champion senior highlighted a defense which allowed only 16 goals last season, but her offensive contributions shouldn't be overlooked. Gatz registered five goals and 11 assists, with a goal vs. Brebeuf Jesuit and assists vs. Carmel, Heritage Christian, Evansville Memorial and Bishop Chatard among the highlights.\n\nMadison Haggard, Avon\n\nThe senior is part of an experienced returning core for the Orioles, who are looking to build upon an eight-win finish wherein they allowed 24 goals.\n\nEmma Hamelmann, Zionsville\n\nA second team all-Hoosier Crossroads Conference pick, Hamelmann returns with an Eagles defense which allowed only 20 goals and posted seven shutouts. She also scored four goals, with a couple of those tallies coming against Brownsburg and Avon.\n\nHaydenn Heffley, Danville\n\nThe senior scored a goal to help beat North Montgomery and she played a starring role for a Warriors backline which held opponents to 14 goals en route to an 11-5-2 finish.\n\nAlanna Jordan, Heritage Christian\n\nJordan garnered opponents' attention with her ability to control the backline as a sophomore last season. She was key for a defense which allowed 25 goals vs. a loaded schedule and also scored three goals, giving her five for her career.\n\nAbby Lambdin, New Palestine\n\nThe senior Huntington commit has started every game since her freshman year and logs a full 80 minutes almost every time she's out there. She will be critical to the Dragons' success this season following the graduation of fellow backliners Allie Blum and Viv Miller.\n\nElizabeth Lantrip, Brownsburg\n\nThe Bulldogs collected nine shutouts amidst last year’s 12-win sectional title run and Lantrip was critical to those efforts, logging a team-leading 1,514 minutes over 20 games played. She also contributed five goals and a couple assists.\n\nAshlyn McNitt, Noblesville\n\nMcNitt was a backline staple for the Millers, averaging around 64 minutes over 20 games (1,279 total). She played at least 78 minutes in 10 games, including the penalty kicks win over FW Carroll in regionals (93 minutes played). It was the first full varsity season for the 5-8 senior, who appeared in seven games (287 minutes) as a sophomore.\n\nAddy Nielsen, Mt. Vernon\n\nNielsen jumped right in as a freshman, starting all 16 games and racking up 934 minutes — most among Mt. Vernon's returners. She played the full 80 minutes in a scoreless draw vs. Hamilton Southeastern at the end of September.\n\nSara Oliver, Danville\n\nOliver registered assists in wins over Southmont and Frankfort, and aided that lights-out Danville defense. She has five goals and four assists entering her senior year.\n\nAshley Preston, Brebeuf Jesuit\n\nThe Braves graduated a couple stalwarts from their lineup, but with Preston among the returners, expectations remain high. The junior defender/midfielder aided a defense which allowed only 16 goals and contributed five goals and an assist for the Marion County champion's attack.\n\nEmma Reed, Tri-West\n\nThe senior center back played 1,348 minutes for the sectional champion Bruins, leading a defense which out-scored opponents 50-33.\n\nMiriam Ruiz, Speedway\n\nRuiz appeared in 13 games for a Sparkplugs defense which out-scored opponents 55-11. The junior racked up 46 steals for the season (credited with nine vs. Brebeuf Jesuit) and tallied a pair of assists to push her career total to three.\n\nBlair Satterfield, Hamilton Southeastern\n\nA well-rounded athlete, Satterfield anchored the HSE defense in front of 2023 Indiana Miss Soccer Haley Wade in net. The Royals allowed only eight goals with Satterfield in the lineup (she did not play in a 1-0 loss to FW Carroll), and she also tallied three assists.\n\nMia Smith, Westfield\n\nAn all-state honoree, Smith typically matched up vs. the opponent's top player, leading a defense that began the season with six straight shutouts and finished with only six goals allowed. Smith also scored a goal and registered an assist, giving her three and four entering her senior year.\n\nSanna Smith, Zionsville\n\nSmith recorded four assists and appeared in 18 games in her first varsity season. She was a key contributor to those six shutouts, as well.\n\nAbby Straus, Hamilton Southeastern\n\nIn addition to playing center back for the ultra-stingy HSE defense, Straus (Ashland commit) scored twice and tallied two assists — the first of her career.\n\nHannah Struve, Noblesville\n\nStruve led Noblesville in minutes played last season as a sophomore, clocking 1,434 minutes over 21 games played. She also registered a shot on goal and attempted a penalty kick in her first varsity season. The Millers finished the season with six shutouts.\n\nHadley West, Franklin Central\n\nWest, a junior, returned from injury and started every game at outside back for the Flashes last season, matching up against the opponent's top player. She'll be especially important this fall for an FC team which graduated 10 seniors."
