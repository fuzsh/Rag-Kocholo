        "text": "Queen Street Mall delivers more bang for your buck than any other shopping precinct in Queensland. Brisbane's best-known pedestrian mall has more than 500 retailers including home-grown talent, designer stores and international labels.\n\nWhere to shop on Queen Street Mall\n\nShopping centres and arcades\n\nQueen Street Mall is a shopper’s paradise from high street to high end. Big-name stores take up street frontage, while smaller retailers are tucked inside the seven shopping centres and heritage-listed arcades.\n\nThese include QueensPlaza, Wintergarden, 170 Queen Street (previously Broadway on the Mall), Uptown (previously The Myer Centre), Brisbane Arcade, Tattersall’s Arcade and MacArthur Central across Edward Street.\n\nHead to QueensPlaza for a 5-storey David Jones and 3 levels of luxury designer stores, Uptown for specialty stores and a Coles supermarket, and Wintergarden for fashion finds for any budget.\n\nThe mall’s 2 elegant and historic arcades are Brisbane Arcade and Tattersall’s Arcade. Both are a must-visit and treasure trove of jewellers, milliners and boutique tailors.\n\nStores and boutiques on the mall\n\nThe mall’s international fashion stores include H&M, Uniqlo and Zara. For luxury stores, there’s Balenciaga, Burberry, Saint Laurent, Salvatore Ferragamo, Chanel, Dior and Louis Vuitton. Australian labels include Lorna Jane, R. M. Williams, Cue and Seed. Across Edward Street is the Apple flagship and international luxury brands like Cartier and Gucci. Looking for more men’s designer wares? Head to Edward Street for Mitchell Ogilvie and Canali.\n\nAdditionally, dotted throughout the mall and nearby streets you’ll find fashion staples Cotton On, Dissh, Rebel Sport, Jo Mercer, Maiocchi, Valleygirl, and Peter Alexander - to name but a few.\n\nWhere to eat and drink on Queen Street Mall\n\nOn and around the mall\n\nThere’s nothing better that works up an appetite than some good old retail therapy. For the best cafes and dining the city has to offer, look down laneways and up high for those perched on rooftops and balconies.\n\nJust off the mall down Albert Lane is Vapiano and Harajuku Gyoza. Along Burnett Lane you’ll find Brew Café & Wine Bar, Pho City, Felix for Goodness and Alba Bar & Deli.\n\nOn the mall, there’s the iconic Jimmy's on the Mall.\n\nMoving up a level at Hyatt Regency Brisbane there’s Lennon’s Restaurant and Bar – an air-conditioned eatery overlooking the mall. Similarly, well-positioned, at the Hilton Hotel above Wintergarden, is Vintaged Bar & Grill. One of the mall’s best-kept secrets is the rooftop bar and restaurant called Stanton. A fabulous way to refuel before your next round of shopping.\n\nShopping centre food halls\n\nFor a quick bite to eat and fuel up for hitting the shops, Queen Street Mall’s food courts are the place to go.\n\nThe Wintergarden, QueensPlaza, Uptown, and MacArthur Central (across Edward Street) all have extensive food courts and their wide selection of fare will suit even the fussiest eater.\n\nThe arcades are best for afternoon tea, try the Brisbane Arcade’s Room with Roses teahouse on the gallery level. Or imagine you're drinking espresso in Rome with a coffee at Marchetti in Tattersall's Arcade.\n\nYou can also pick up gourmet eats and treats at Queensland's first Coles Local at 89 Adelaide Street, just off the main mall.\n\nGetting there and getting around\n\nParking\n\nStreet parking in the Brisbane Central Business District is limited, however, Brisbane City Council operates 2 Council car parks, King George Square and Wickham Terrace. Both offer special rates for late-night shopping on Fridays. There are street parking meters in the city too.\n\nPublic transport\n\nReally, one of the easiest ways to get to Queen Street Mall is by bus or train. Brisbane City Council offers a free and frequent City Loop bus service. Plan your journey on public transport using the Translink journey planner.\n\nIf travelling to Queen Street Mall by train, Central is the closest station to the mall. If a bus is more your thing, most buses stop either on Adelaide Street or King George Square.\n\nAccessibility\n\nBrisbane is home to Australia’s longest braille trail, which runs down both sides of Queen Street Mall and beyond. Queen Street Mall is accessible to wheelchair users with accessible bathrooms available in Uptown, MacArthur Central (across Edward Street) and The General Post Office. Parking suitable for people with mobility issues is available at Uptown (previously The Myer Centre) and Wintergarden.\n\nVisitor information\n\nThere is a Brisbane Visitor Information and Booking Centre located in the mall’s heritage-listed Regent Theatre foyer. It’s great for tour and accommodation bookings, event and entertainment information, brochures and maps.\n\nParents rooms and public toilets\n\nSeveral parent rooms are available along Queen Street Mall. QueensPlaza has a well-appointed parent room underneath the escalators off Adelaide Street and another in David Jones. There’s another room available on Level 2 in Uptown (previously The Myer Centre), near Daiso.\n\nPublic toilets are available in most of the shopping centres and arcades with directions clearly signed.\n\nOpening hours and best times to visit\n\nQueen Street Mall stores trade seven days a week. The trading hours below should be used as a general guide only.\n\nMost shopping centres off Queen Street Mall trade from approximately 9am-5pm Monday to Thursday and 9am-9pm on Friday. Saturday open hours are typically 9am-5pm and Sunday from 10am-4pm.\n\nMore ideas for Brisbetter days out\n\nFor more Brisbetter Days Out inspiration, check out our other articles, videos and itineraries.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, you might also like:\n\nAwesome Brisbane parks for active kids\n\nBrisbane Powerhouse: a power station fuelled by culture\n\nMt Coot-tha Reserve | Beginner's guide to walking."
