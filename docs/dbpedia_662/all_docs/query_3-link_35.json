Our community’s cultural heritage is worthy of preservation and sites such as the Hermitage, Crooks Hollow and the Dundas Valley aboriginal portage route form an important part of our community identity.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, donations to the Foundation helped to restore the Hermitage Ruins in the Dundas Valley Conservation Area. Years of weathering and stopgap measures had left the ruins at serious risk of collapse. Stabilizing the ruins was an expensive and complicated process, but donations helped to ensure that restoration efforts were as comprehensive and long-lasting as possible, ensuring that the ruins would be around to capture the imaginations of generations to come.\n\nWe are also extraordinarily proud to support the rich cultural heritage that gets brought to life every day at Westfield Heritage Village and Conservation Area. Westfield Heritage Village Conservation Area is a living history museum and conservation area. As one of Ontario’s most interesting historical destinations, it boasts a stunning collection of over 35 restored historical buildings, nestled within 204 hectares of conservation land featuring woodlands, meadows, and trails.\n\nThe Foundation is incredibly lucky to partner with the Friends of Westfield, a dedicated group of volunteers, to raise funds for improvements to Westfield. In recent years, the Friends of Westfield have fundraised to restore and improve a number of buildings in the Village.\n\nOur current fundraising efforts are focused on creating new trails and improving existing trails, and the Locomotive #103 restoration efforts at Westfield Heritage Village."
