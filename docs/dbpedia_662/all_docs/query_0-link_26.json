The area is home to 6.8 million inhabitants (40% of the Dutch population) and welcomes the majority of the nation’s 15 million annual tourists. The centre will feature 280 stores, restaurants and leisure outlets, and, like the other flagship centres in our portfolio, offer opportunities beyond traditional retail with unique events and experiences. This marks the beginning of a new era for retail in the Netherlands to meet the evolving desires of consumers.\r\n\r\nWestfield Mall of the Netherlands announced today the signature of a major deal with Inditex – the world’s largest fashion retailer – which will see iconic brands Zara, Bershka, Pull&Bear and Stradivarius open flagship stores in the new €570 million development.\r\n\r\nLearn more about Westfield Mall of the Netherlands here.",
