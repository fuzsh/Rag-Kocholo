        "text": "Thank you to everyone for helping to make our 2023 season such a special year. Our Christmas program is now finished for the season and while our buildings are closed visitors can hike our trails and see the outside of our buildings. Our Christmas swags will stay up during the holiday break.\n\nLooking for a fun challenge? There are two scavenger hunts to try. We’ve lost our mitts! There are 6 pairs of mitts – that’s 12 mitts to find and try to match together again. Our other hunt will take you out onto the Sugar Shack Trail. Try to find 10 wooden Christmas trees hidden in the trees along the path. Start on the path behind the train station to find all of them.\n\nTake a longer hike out into our trails system and experience our brand new trails. Check out the Chinmaya Trail and the Tanager Trail. Westfield now has 6.7 km of trails to explore. Each season has something new to discover. Remember to wear your winter gear. We don’t groom the trails beyond the village.\n\nYou can use your HCA membership card or you can buy a ticket at the automated pay station. The cost is $16.00 per car load.\n\nMake sure to keep watching this space to find out about our plans for our 60th Anniversary Season in 2024. We are looking forward to spending some time with our visitors in this special milestone year!"
