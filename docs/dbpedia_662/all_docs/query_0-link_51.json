Over the next 140 years, Myrtleville House would continue to be home to four consecutive generations of the family. Known for their contributions to Canadian farming, education and public life, you can now experience what life was like for early settlers of the Brantford area through the eyes of the Good family.\n\nFeatures of the home include extensive gardens, workshop with blacksmith forge, icehouse, smokehouse and bake oven. Myrtleville House Museum is a place to learn about and experience early Canadian life.\n\nAdmission to the museum is by donation.\n\nStep into history at the Myrtleville House Museum and discover the history of the Good Family!\n\nBuilt in 1837, the ten room Georgian homestead was home to Allen and Eliza Good, who had emigrated from Ireland with their three children.
