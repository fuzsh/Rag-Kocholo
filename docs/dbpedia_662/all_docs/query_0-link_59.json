        "text": "Disposal\n\nLatex paint is not a hazardous waste. Once hardened or empty, residents are encouraged to remove the lid and place items in their curbside trash container for disposal. Oil or solvent based paints are a hazardous waste and may be turned into the HHW Drop Off Center for proper disposal. For an easy video tutorial click this link.\n\nIf you have oil-based paints or stains, than those do need to be properly disposed of at the Hamilton County HHW Drop-off Center. If you are a business work directly with a waste vendor such as Heritage Environmental for proper disposal.\n\nLatex Paint Identification\n\nLatex paint can be identified the following ways:\n\nRead the Label: If clean-up instructions indicate that rollers & brushed can be cleaned using soap and water, it is typically latex or “water-based” paint. If the product is a solvent or “oil-based” paint, the instructions will likely indicate these items can be cleaned with mineral spirits or turpentine.\n\nWater Test: Place paint in a small container with some water. If the paint is water-based, it will easily mix with the water and dissolve. Oil-based paint will separate from the water and form noticeable layers.\n\nLatex Paint Drying Instructions\n\nRemove lid from paint container.\n\nAdd kitty litter, oil dry, saw dust or soil to the latex paint.\n\nStir until paint has harden to an \"oatmeal-like\" consistency.\n\nPlace the uncovered container in a well-ventilated area away from children or pets and allow mixture to harden.\n\nPlace the container, with the dried paint, in your curbside trash with the lid off.\n\nPlease note, county residents are encouraged to dispose of their unwanted latex paint at home if possible. However, latex paint that has not been frozen or appears to still be in a usable condition can be brought to the HHW Drop Off Center for disposal or reuse."
