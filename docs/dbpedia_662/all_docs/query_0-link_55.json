        "text": "Los Angeles has long been a destination for trend setters and fashion seekers alike, which is why this city is home to some of the best shopping in the world. Find the best shopping from global luxury brands to discount outlets, paired with entertainment and dining, at malls located everywhere from Downtown LA to the Beach Cities. Read on for the best shopping centers in Los Angeles.\n\nNOTE: Hours and opening dates change frequently. Check individual websites for updated information.\n\nOriginally opened in 1964, Westfield Century City was revitalized in 2017 with a $1-billion redesign, creating an essential Westside escape like no other, infusing the property’s design and decor with an authentic Southern California vibe. About 90 percent of the stores and restaurants were newly added as part of the two-year reimagining.\n\nWestfield's flagship mall is a 1.3 million square-foot showcase for more than 200 luxury, contemporary and international designer brands, including a three-level Nordstrom featuring its latest design concepts; a completely remodeled three-level Bloomingdale’s, and a modern two-level Macy’s. The expansion included new dining options like the West Coast’s first Eataly, an Italian-focused food emporium; and the acclaimed Taiwanese soup dumpling chain, Din Tai Fung.\n\nThe mall has walkable plazas, tree-lined pathways, strolling gardens and cool green canopies. Nearly 100 types of specially made furniture, much of it made of wood, are along the walkways to invite visitors to linger.\n\nThe Bloc is a hip open-air destination located in the bustling 7th Street corridor that links the Financial, Fashion, Jewelry and Theater districts of Downtown LA. Completed in 2016, the $160-million transformation of an indoor plaza brought forth the 496-room Sheraton Grand Los Angeles, a sleekly redesigned Macy’s, and a luxury office tower.\n\nConveniently located across from the 7th Street Metro Station, The Bloc features thoughtfully curated local boutiques, artisans, premier retailers and eateries, and some of the coolest art installations and live performances in the city. The Bloc also boasts Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, featuring the latest blockbusters, cult classics, and cocktails and bites served seat-side.\n\nCentrally located above the Metro B Line (Red) Hollywood & Highland Station, Ovation Hollywood is a complete entertainment experience - Anvio VR, Dave & Buster's, and live music at Lucky Strike, not to mention the unbeatable people-watching along Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nVisitors can sign up for guided tours of the Dolby Theatre, home of the Academy Awards. Be sure to check out the upper walkways surrounding the central courtyard - they're great for snapping photos of the world-famous Hollywood Sign.\n\nThe Grove is one of the most acclaimed retail and entertainment destinations in the United States, and among the highest-grossing shopping centers in the country. At its core is an attention to neighborhood scale and detail, a passion for great design, and a relentless focus on the customer and tenant experience. Throughout the day, the dancing waters of The Grove’s fountain reach skyward, while guests linger at the al fresco cafes and inviting storefronts. Originally opened as Pacific Theatres, the AMC 14 features Art Deco design, mobile ordering for movie snacks, and discounted pricing for seniors, students, and military. With its style, warmth and energy, it's no wonder that world-class brands and personalities, from Vince and Shinola to Sandro and Tiffany & Co., come to The Grove to launch their latest creations. Underscoring the mall's personal touch, The Wall Street Journal named The Grove the best concierge in the country.\n\nNext door to The Grove is The Original Farmers Market, a beloved destination for tourists and locals alike. Opened in 1934, the landmark open-air marketplace features more than 100 locally owned produce stands, gourmet grocers, specialty shops, food stalls and sit-down restaurants. The Market also hosts numerous events throughout the year, including Mardi Gras, the Fall Festival, and Holiday Festivities.\n\nDubbed “the Tigris and Euphrates of cool” by Nocando, the Fairfax District is a mecca for streetwear fashion, including the flagship stores of The Hundreds, Tyler the Creator's Golf Wang, and Supreme.\n\nIn November 2018, a $500 million re-imagination of the Beverly Center completely transformed the iconic fashion destination. Designed by Rome-based Studio Fuksas, the renovation added a continuous ribbon of skylights that bathes the entire center’s elegant and contoured interior in natural light. The shimmering exterior incorporates a perforated steel façade that captures light all day.\n\nWith a clientele that influences celebrity style and popular culture, the Beverly Center continues to lead Los Angeles into a fashion-forward future. The center is anchored by Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s, and features more than 100 of the world’s most trend-setting brands, including Burberry, MCM, Fendi, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Saint Laurent, Salvatore Ferragamo and Versace.\n\nA new heart for the Valley, The Shops at Sportsmen's Lodge is an urban oasis for wellness, shopping, and dining in Studio City. Established in 1945 and reimagined in December 2021 by Midwood Investment & Development, the outdoor shopping center spans 95,000 square feet of walkable retail, dining, fitness and communal space at the corner of Coldwater Canyon and Ventura Boulevard. Anchored by boutique grocery Erewhon and fitness leader Equinox, The Shops at Sportsmen's Lodge is home to top retail, food and wellness tenants including Fred Segal, Free People Movement, SUGARFISH, HiHo Cheeseburger, UOVO and more.\n\nThe Americana at Brand in Glendale fuses luxury living, shopping and entertainment to create a uniquely sophisticated and upscale Southern California urban environment. Inspired by Boston’s historic Newbury Street, the 15.5-acre mixed-use property is laid out as a classic American town square that's circled by an electric-powered trolley. The heart of the square is a two-acre park that features a large fountain that dances to timeless music and is brightly lit up in the evenings. Shop 70 upscale retail, dining and entertainment destinations - everything from Kate Spade and Tesla Motors to David Yurman, Samsung Experience Store, Tory Burch, Tiffany & Co, and an 18-screen AMC Theatre.\n\nThe only center in the United States with a Neiman Marcus and flagship Nordstrom alongside Target, Westfield Topanga is a power shopping paradise with a luxury lineup including Gucci, Tiffany & Co., Salvatore Ferragamo, Louis Vuitton, Cartier, Burberry, Jimmy Choo, Montblanc, Saint Laurent and David Yurman alongside Apple, Tesla Motors, Tory Burch, Anthropologie, Free People, Splendid, Peloton, Riley Rose and Lacoste.\n\nLocated adjacent to the Canoga Park property, The Village is an outdoor oasis that offers locals and visitors alike a destination experience under a canopy of native trees. The Village showcases trendy local fashion and lifestyle brands, a variety of restaurants offering al fresco patio dining, full-service gym, spa and yoga studio, along with Costco, Crate & Barrel, a weekly farmer’s market and more.\n\nFor many visitors, a trip to Los Angeles isn’t complete without shopping for bargains — and that means scouring the region's great outlet malls.\n\nLocated 10 minutes south of Downtown LA, Citadel Outlets is an \"only in LA\" shopping experience - housed in a 700,000 square-foot Assyrian style “castle,” boasting more than 130 brand name stores offering 30 to 70 percent off retail prices. A variety of fashions and accessories can be found at Michael Kors, Armani Outlet, Hugo Boss, Lacoste, Nike, Oakley, Swarovski, Kipling, Coach, Kate Spade, Tilly's, Perry Ellis, Calvin Klein, Banana Republic, and Tommy Hilfiger.\n\nHome to the largest collection of luxury outlets in California, Desert Hills Premium Outlets is located in Cabazon just over an hour drive from Los Angeles and 20 minutes west of Palm Springs. The outdoor shopping center features 180 designer stores, including Bally, Brunello Cucinelli, Balenciaga, Fendi, Gucci, Jimmy Choo, La Perla, Moncler, Prada, Roberto Cavalli, Saint Laurent, Salvatore Ferragamo, Valentino and Versace."
