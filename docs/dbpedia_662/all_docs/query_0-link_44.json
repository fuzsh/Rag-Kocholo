        "text": "1985\n\nCity Locations\n\nPrince Edward Island, Ontario (Canada)\n\nLocation Types\n\nMansion, House, Museum, Riverside\n\nLocation Styles\n\nGothic/Victorian, Building Dated/Retro, Colonial, Rustic\n\nAbout Anne of Green Gables\n\nThe 1985 TV mini-series Anne of Green Gables is a charming adaptation of the classic novel by Lucy Maud Montgomery. Directed by Kevin Sullivan, this version breathes life into the beloved characters, with Megan Follows taking on the role of the spirited orphan girl, Anne Shirley. The series first aired on American television as a 3-part presentation on PBS' Wonderworks from February 17 through March 3, 1986. Sent to live with her new guardians, the stern Marilla Cuthbert (Colleen Dewhurst) and her introverted brother Matthew (Richard Farnsworth), on Canada's Prince Edward Island, Anne's vivid imagination and impulsive nature initially cause a stir. Anne gradually wins over her foster family despite her struggles to control her temper. The series also delves into her connections with her close friend Diana, portrayed by Schuyler Grant, and her supposed adversary Gilbert Blythe, played by Jonathan Crombie. As for awards, Anne of Green Gables was a resounding success. It won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program and was nominated for several other awards. This includes nominations for Megan Follows, Colleen Dewhurst, and Richard Farnsworth for their performances, writing, and direction. The 1985 adaptation of \"Anne of Green Gables\" remains a cherished classic, capturing viewers' hearts with heartfelt storytelling and memorable performances.\n\nAnne of Green Gables Locations\n\nThe 1985 adaptation of Lucy Maud Montgomery's classic novel Anne of Green Gables was filmed on location in several picturesque regions across Canada. Many of the movie's scenes were filmed in Prince Edward Island (P.E.I.), Stouffville, Ontario; Jacksons Point, Ontario; and Westfield Heritage Village near Rockton, Ontario. The Jerseyville Railway Station acted as the Bright River Station when Anne first arrived at Green Gables farm. Pickering Museum Village provided the Cole House backdrop for Anne walking along a ridgepole roof. The Seacow Head Lighthouse is one of the most well-known symbols from Anne of Green Gables and Road to Avonlea â it is an 18.3-meter tall structure that has stood for centuries along P.E.I.'s coastline. The backdrop of these filming locations provides stunning views that make visiting worthwhile for any Anne of Green Gables fan. From the rolling hills and countryside in P.E.I. to rural villages such as Westfield Heritage Village and Pickering Museum Village â each location adds a unique charm to an already beloved story. A trip to these locations would be worth it for the beautiful scenery, the rich history behind them, and how they have been immortalized through this classic novel adaptation.\n\nOne of the most memorable scenes takes place at the Bright River Station. The scene revolves around Matthew Cuthbert (Richard Farnsworth), who is expecting to pick up a boy from the Hopetown asylum to help out on the farm. Instead, he is surprised by a girl named Anne (Megan Follows). Despite his shock, Matthew, being particularly shy, decides to bring Anne back to his home, Green Gables. On their journey, he is taken in by her contagious enthusiasm and vivid descriptions of the local scenery. This scene was filmed at the Jerseyville Railway Station, which served as the Bright River Station in the series. This historical station was initially built in Jerseyville and was the first building moved to the Westfield Heritage Village. Today, the Westfield Heritage Village is home to over 30 historical buildings, many of which were used as filming locations for \"Anne of Green Gables.\" This iconic location is a short drive from Hamilton and is open to visitors year-round, although hours may vary depending on the season. Walking through the village, you can almost hear Anne's lively chatter and feel the charm that has made \"Anne of Green Gables\" a timeless classic.\n\nAnne (Megan Follows) invites Diana (Schuyler Grant) to Green Gables for tea. However, a mix-up leads to Anne inadvertently serving Diana black currant wine instead of raspberry cordial, making Diana inebriated. The mishap leads to Mrs. Barry (Rosemary Radcliffe) forbidding Diana from seeing Anne, causing much sorrow for the two friends. This scene takes place at Butternut Farm, a charming white and green farmhouse built in the 1850s, which was used for all exterior shots of Green Gables in the films. The property was also featured in Road to Avonlea. The veranda railing and white picket fence were added by Sullivan Entertainment specifically for filming. Today, Butternut Farm is a private property. Fans wishing to visit should respect this and only view the farmhouse from the outside. Getting to Butternut Farm involves traveling to Ontario, Canada. Depending on your starting point, consider driving, taking a bus, or flying into Toronto Pearson International Airport. It's a drive from the airport to Uxbridge Township, where Butternut Farm is located. Please remember to respect the residents' privacy while enjoying the iconic exterior of Green Gables.\n\nOne scene that stands out vividly in fans' minds is when Anne (Megan Follows) accepts a dare to walk the roof's ridgepole. The dare comes from Josie Pye (Miranda de Pencier), a sly and mischievous girl whom Anne and her friend Diana (Schuyler Grant) have taken a dislike to. Despite Diana's attempts to dissuade her, Anne's pride gets the better of her. She feels her honor is at stake, and thus, she ascends to the top of the roof. This memorable scene was filmed at the Pickering Museum Village, the largest living historical pioneer village in the Durham Region. The Cole House, which is one of the 19 preserved buildings in the village, provided the backdrop for this bold stunt. Various other spots within the village were also featured in the series. The inside of the Oddfellows Hall was portrayed as the Carmody Town Hall, the location where Anne goes to her inaugural ball, while the Blacksmith Shop was presented as the Spurgeon Farm, seen in the backdrop as Mr. Philips' (Paul Brown) makes his exit. To experience this iconic location, set your navigation for the Pickering Museum Village. If you're coming from Toronto, a short 35-minute drive via Don Valley Pkwy N and ON-407 E will get you there. The village is open to everyone, and guided tours offer a unique chance to immerse yourself in the enchanting world of Anne of Green Gables.\n\nIn the beloved 1985 adaptation, one location stands out as a recurring meeting point for the series' protagonist, Anne (Megan Follows), and her friend Diana (Schuyler Grant) â the Gus Pike's Lighthouse. Perched atop a cliff with the sea stretching out in the background, this lighthouse becomes a significant place for introspection and conversation for the two friends. The scenes at the Gus Pike's Lighthouse were filmed at the Seacow Head Lighthouse, a well-recognized symbol from the series. This lighthouse is one of the oldest structures on Prince Edward Island (P.E.I.), reaching an impressive height of 18.3 meters. It derives its name, \"Seacow Head,\" from the once-abundant walrus population in the nearby waters. The lighthouse was automated on November 12, 1959, and the keeper's dwelling was sold and removed from the site on March 7, 1960. Despite these changes, the lighthouse has retained its original look from the 1985 series, making it a must-visit spot for Anne of Green Gables fans. If you plan to visit this iconic filming location, set your course for the Seacow Head Lighthouse on Prince Edward Island (P.E.I.). If you're coming from Moncton, it's about a 2-hour drive via NB-15 E. Alternatively, you can fly into Charlottetown Airport, from which it's just an hour's drive. The lighthouse remains open to the public, offering fans a unique chance to immerse themselves in Anne's world and relive the series's captivating charm firsthand.\n\nAnne (Megan Follows) and Diana (Schuyler Grant) unknowingly leap into Aunt Josephine's (Charmion King) guest room bed in the middle of the night. Initially, Aunt Josephine is outraged by their lack of propriety. However, Anne's heartfelt apology amuses her, making her fond of \"that Anne-girl.\" This endearing moment prompts Anne to consider her a \"kindred spirit.\" The Spadina Museum, which opened its doors in 1984, served as the filming location for this scene. Operated by the City of Toronto, the museum was home to three generations of the Austin family. It demonstrates the evolution of styles from the mid-Victorian era to the 1930s. The house's interior and exterior were used to represent Beechwood, the home of Aunt Josephine Barry in the series. If you plan to visit this historic site, please note that access to the museum is only through guided tours. Some exhibitions and events may also have an additional charge. To get to the Spadina Museum, you should head to Toronto. Depending on your starting location, consider driving, taking a bus, or even flying into Toronto Pearson International Airport. From the airport, it's just a short drive or taxi ride to the museum.\n\nIn a dramatic scene, Anne (Megan Follows), Diana (Schuyler Grant), Jane Andrews (Trish Nettleton), and Ruby Gillis (Jennifer Inch) stage a performance of the Lily Maid's farewell from Tennyson's poem, \"The Lady of Shalott.\" Anne takes on the role of the Lily Maid and is set sailing across the pond in a dory owned by Mr. Barry (Robert Collins). As the boat starts to leak, Anne finds herself compelled to climb onto a bridgepole for safety. Gilbert (Jonathan Crombie), who is coincidentally rowing nearby, becomes her savior as he rows her safely back to shore. This scene takes place on a distinctive footbridge that is repeatedly featured in \"Anne of Green Gables,\" \"Anne of Avonlea,\" and \"Anne of Green Gables: A New Beginning.\" Although the original bridge had to be replaced due to safety concerns, the new structure replicates the one used in the films. You'll need to travel to Prince Edward Island in Canada to get to the filming location. Depending on your origin, you can drive, take a bus, or fly into Charlottetown Airport. From there, it's a scenic drive to the site where the footbridge stands, ready to transport fans back to the summer when Anne played the Lily Maid.\n\nAnne of Green Gables is artistically sentimental, yet it remains commercially hard-nosed as it was delivered on a budget in 11 weeks of shooting. Prince Edward Island, the primary setting, served as the idyllic canvas for Green Gables, its rolling landscapes, and the picturesque village of Avonlea. The hauntingly beautiful Lake of Shining Waters at Keppoch Beach embodied the ethereal setting where Anne's imagination thrived. Through the lens of Canada's captivating locales, this adaptation stayed true to Lucy Maud Montgomery's vision and elevated it, creating a cinematic masterpiece that resonates with audiences worldwide. The Canadian filming locations played an integral role in crafting the enchanting world of Anne Shirley. In conclusion, Anne of Green Gables (1985) was an incredible success artistically and commercially with its beautiful cinematography, well-written script, great actors' performances, and innovative ideas to make a charming story full of adventure and heartwarming romance. Even though not all filming was done on Prince Edward Island, the scenes there still captured some essence of its Victorian mood."
