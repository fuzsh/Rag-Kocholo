        "text": "(1938) Sci-fi (Future world) / Adventure (Escape) / Romance\n\nR: * * * *\n\nPlot bullets\n\nIt is a future time when the Earth has reverted to a socialistic dark ages, after war.\n\nIndependent thought and action is forbidden.\n\nA boy rebels, and he and a girl flee the city for what ever new life awaits them.\n\nThis boy finds that you can empathize with but not just live for others. He declares his independence and and in a single word, his 'Anthem'.\n\nI loved this book. It is a great treatise on the rights of the individual. A must read for everybody who is unsure of his/her individuality.\n\nUtter twaddle from beginning to end. Unfortunately, it's quite well-written twaddle and led me to believe that some profound revelation was perhaps coming at some point, rather than the facile and stupid 'rousing' ending. The \"we\" thing quickly became tiresome too. Even though Anthem is short, I still found it a total waste of my time.\n\nLyrica Silvan\n\n5\n\nI love this book. My first time reading it was in my sophomore English class, and ever since I have been trying to find it again.\n\nThis book provides a very unique view of a futuristic society. True, the \"live and think as one\" concept has been done before, but every author has their own style, and I believe Ayn Rand's rendition is spectacular. Not only does it reach out to those who feel outcast in their own societies because they are different, but also to the strength of one's own dreams, and the power of the individual to rise up against oppression. This is a beautiful work of literature, and I highly recommend it.\n\nAn interesting read by an intelligent woman, but let's be perfectly clear: one cannot cherry-pick the notions of self-interest and self-sufficiency from the Ayn Rand tree of atheist thought. All religions are based on the principles of community support and aid for the poor which Rand found absolutely repellent. If you are a religious person who is attracted to Ayn Rand's philosophy you must question either your religious allegiance or your comprehension of her writing.\n\nI loved this book. It is a great treatise on the rights of the individual. A must read for every teenager who is unsure of his/her individuality.\n\nAn interesting read, but ultimately a humanist manifesto.\n\nA rather weak short story. Orwell's 1984 is a much better view of a totalitarian culture. The book relies on coincidence too much (finding a tunnel, finding a house in the wilderness,) and the characters are two dimensional, the only woman existing just to bear him his sons (daughters seem not to matter to him.) Rand seems never to have slept outdoors in the woods.\n\nThe polemic at the end just repeats her theme that social virtues are evil and the only true virtue is selfishness. It reminded me of a hillbilly explaining why he has no need of g'ummint.\n\n2\n\nAyn Rand did a pretty good job of presenting a society where individual initiative and expression are repressed to a severe degree, but her portrayal would have benefited by showing why the ancestors of these people rebelled against and eventually tore down the previous civilization.\n\nPeople just don't wake up in the morning and decide to break machines and turn off the electricity. Why they decided to overthrow their previous rulers and do away with technology is never explained."
