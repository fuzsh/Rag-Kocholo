        "text": "Self-Interest\n\nIn contrast to the idea that your life belongs to others (family, nation, God), whom you must obey and serve, Objectivism holds “that your life belongs to you and the good is to live it.” You deal with others not as master-servant but as fellow traders, trading value for value in matter and spirit.\n\nDuring her own lifetime, Rand became a famous and controversial figure. A best-selling author, she also carried her message to university classrooms, to Hollywood, to Congress, to the editorial page, to talk shows and radio programs. Her presence has only increased since her death in 1982, as her philosophy has become more well-known. Today, her books have sold in the millions, and she’s the subject of an Oscar-nominated documentary, a U.S. postage stamp, university courses, and a philosophical society devoted to the study of her thought.\n\nFueled by her vision of man as a heroic being and by the original philosophy behind it, more and more people, from all walks of life, from businessmen to students to professors to athletes to artists, are saying the same thing: “Ayn Rand’s writings changed my life.”"
