        "text": "Superb!\n\nIt took me down memory lane to 1979 when I first read it. It was a mindblower then and even more powerful now. It's amazing how right Rand was and is. Narration was phenomenal. Several passages are very moving some brought chills. You will not be disappointed.\n\nHumans Were Not Meant to Live as Drones\n\nIf you have read Anthem, read it again. If you haven't, read it now.\n\nI will read this again but I will skip the long unnecessary speech at the end of the book. The story speaks for itself without hammering home the intended message. Other than that speech, it reads like a contemporary short story.\n\nWarning- It does take some time to get used to the way the main character does not refer to himself as I, but as a long word/number distinction. Humans were not meant to live as drones.\n\nTwenty five years ago, Ayn Rand may have seem dated and irrelevant to most. I had never heard of her anyway. My son suggested that I read this book after he read it in high school last year.\n\nAnthem is a look at socialism through a fiction medium. Her books are brilliant and way ahead of their time. If you have read them before read them again with new eyes.\n\nMore than anything else, it helps me to know what books a reviewer loves most when deciding on whether or not to spend my time or money on a particular book. Below I have listed some of my 5 or 4Â½ star books from many different genres:\n\nAnne of Green Gables, The Book Thief, Bossypants, Catch Me if You Can, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, A Christmas Carol, The Clan of the Cave Bear series, The Color Purple, The Davinci Code, A Dogâs Purpose, Emma, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, A Girl Named Zippy, Glass Castle, Gone with the Wind, The Green Mile, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, The Harry Potter Series, The Help, Hitchhikerâs Guide to the Galaxy 1-3, The Hunger Games, To Kill a Mockingbird, Letâs Pretend this Never Happened, Little Women, Mind Hunter, Nineteen Minutes, The Outlander series, Peace like a River, A Prayer for Owen Meany, Pride and Prejudice, Saving Sammy, The Secret life of Bees, Shawshank Redemption, My Sisterâs Keeper, Stand by Me, The Stand, The Time Travelerâs Wife, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn...\n\nThe dangers of âWeâ vs. âIâ\n\nIâm a fan of Ayn Rand and have been for years, so be aware.\n\nThis is a short read about the worse case result of socialism taking over society for a long period of time. The value of the individual is gone.\n\nI would recommend those new to Ayn Rand to read Fountainhead then Atlas Shrugged after Anthem. Both stories are extensions of the premise above, but in a present day allegory.\n\nThe audible is easier to go through than the book because of the tense and use of pronouns.\n\ngreat work\n\nWe read this book years ago, when we found out that the Rush rock opera 2112 was based on this book and loved it.\n\nListening now many years later, more than 25. We still love it. We won't even go into how politically apt it is now with the election season on us.\n\nI, yes I said it, I, recommend this book to all."
