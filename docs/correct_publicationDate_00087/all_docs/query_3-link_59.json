        "text": "Both as a thinker and as an artist, Ayn Rand swam against the tide. As a philosopher, she was an uncompromising champion of reason, individualism and pure capitalism. As a novelist, she was an impassioned Romantic. In both capacities, she was startling, original, unprecedented. And in both roles she obtained a worldwide audience for her philosophy of Objectivism.\n\nThe goal of her writing, she said, was not to capture a \"slice of life,\" but to project her moral vision of man \"as he might and ought to be.\"\n\nAnd so the protagonists of her bestsellers (We the Living, Anthem, The Fountainhead, and Atlas Shrugged ) are heroic, Promethean individualistsâembattled titans in a world of envious Lilliputians.\n\nAnd rejecting the notion that a \"serious\" novel had to be dull, she dramatized her philosophical themes in intricate plots loaded with color, romance, adventure and grandeur.\n\nâ\n\n\"In a certain sense, every novelist is a philosopher, because one cannot present a picture of human existence without a philosophical framework.\" Â Ayn Rand, 1960\n\nIn addition to penning best-selling novels, Rand wrote serious works on philosophy and cultural and political analysis and criticism. Some of these articles and essays appeared in magazines such as Cosmopolitan, the New York Times Magazine, and Human Events.\n\nIn 1962 she and Nathaniel Branden began publishing The Objectivist Newsletter, which was renamed The Objectivist in 1966. That same year the newsletter serialized Rand's \"Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology.\" Her highly influential book Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal was published Â in 1966, and included chapters by economists Alan Greenspan and Robert Hessen, and Rand's former associate Nathaniel Branden. In 1971 the newsletter was renamed The Ayn Rand Letter. Several books with material culled from her newsletter articles were published posthumously.\n\nExplore the links below to learn more about this fascinating author's fiction and non-fiction work.\n\nAYN RAND'S NOVELS\n\nAtlas Shrugged (1957) This is Ayn Randâs masterwork â her monumental story of the man who swore he would stop the motor of the world, and did. It is the novel in which Rand first presented and dramatized her radical morality of rational self-interest â and which has launched a philosophical revolution.\n\nThe Fountainhead (1943) The powerful novel that made Ayn Rand famous: the story of a rebellious individualist, architect Howard Roark â and his battle to live and work by his own standards.\n\nAnthem (1938) A beautifully written and inspiring novelette of a man who, in a totally collectivist future, rediscovers his own sense of selfhood.\n\nWe the Living (1936) The dramatic story of one young womanâs struggle for freedom during Russian Revolution, as she is torn between two men: the aristocrat she loves, and the dangerous communist who loves her.\n\nAYN RAND'S SHORT STORIES\n\nThe Husband I Bought (1926)\n\nGood Copy (c.a. 1927)\n\nEscort (1929)\n\nHer Second Career (1929)\n\nThese early short stories were not intended for publication, but were written while Ayn Rand was still learning her literary craft and gaining familiarity with the English language. They have considerable charm, however, and contain the seeds of ideas and values that would characterize her mature work. These stories and others are anthologized in The Early Ayn Rand.\n\n\"The Simplest Thing in the World\" (1940). This short story, which shows how an artistâs values affect his creative processes, appears in Ayn Randâs nonfiction work, The Romantic Manifesto: A Philosophy of Literature.\n\n\"Red Pawn\" (c. 1931-32). This short story, set in a Soviet prison camp for political dissidents, dramatizes enduring themes of individualism and love.\n\nRead: Â A Glimpse of the Early Ayn Rand.\n\nAYN RAND'S PLAYS\n\nNight of January 16th (1936) This exciting courtroom melodrama ran successfully on Broadway, and is a staple of the amateur stage. A truly unique feature of this play is that the jury is chosen from the audienceâand how they decide the trial is determined by their philosophies.\n\nIdeal (1934) The theme of this bitter play centers on peopleâs willingness to betray their highest values. It appears in the anthology of Randâs work titled The Early Ayn Rand.\n\nUnconquered (1938) Ayn Rand adapted this play from her novel, We the Living. Though it ran on Broadway briefly, it was not successful. It has not yet been published\n\nThink Twice (1939) A clever murder mystery, and the first of Randâs mature works, this play appears in the collection The Early Ayn Rand.\n\nAYN RAND'S NON-FICTION BOOKS\n\nFor the New Intellectual (1961)\n\nThe Virtue of Selfishness (1964)\n\nCapitalism: The Unknown Ideal (1967)\n\nThe Romantic Manifesto (1970)\n\nThe New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution (1971) [Republished as Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution (1999), with additional essays by Peter Schwartz.]\n\nIntroduction to Objectivist Epistemology (1979)\n\nNON-FICTION PUBLISHED POSTHUMOUSLY\n\nPhilosophy: Who Needs It (1982)\n\nThe Voice of Reason (1988)\n\nThe Ayn Rand Column (1991)\n\nThe Letters of Ayn Rand (1995)\n\nAyn Randâs Marginalia (1995)\n\nJournals of Ayn Rand (1997)\n\nRussian Writings on Hollywood (1999)\n\nThe Ayn Rand Reader (1999)\n\nâ"
