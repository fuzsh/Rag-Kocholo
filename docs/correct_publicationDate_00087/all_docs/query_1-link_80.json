In the end of Ayn Rand’s novella Anthem, Equality 7-2521’s assessment of solitarily expressing his thoughts is that it is not a sin anymore; he is correct because he is free to believe whatever he wants to, learns that he is an individual with purpose, and realizes that no one can control him.\n\n'Power In Ayn Rand's Anthem'\n\n632 Words | 3 Pages\n\nAyn Rand’s Anthem takes place in a strict, collectivist society.
