        "text": "Finally, a biography of Ayn Rand has been written by someone who is not an acolyte.\n\nFor those not familiar with her books or school of thought, Rand is one of the most discussed philosophers of the 20th century. Her ideas, introduced in the blockbuster novels \"The Fountainhead\" (1943) and \"Atlas Shrugged\" (1957), and touted and spouted for the past five decades through the writings and actions of disciples and politicos, have become an integral part of our economic pantheon.\n\nIn this painstakingly researched work, Anne Heller, who has been managing editor of The Antioch Review and the magazine development group at Conde Nast, gives us an unbiased look deep inside the life of this extraordinary woman.\n\nRand, known as Alissa \"Alice\" Rosenbaum, grew up middle-class in revolutionary Russia. The daughter of a Jewish pharmacist and a status-conscience mother, she experienced firsthand the rise of \"the great evil: Communism.\" Her family survived the horrors of war, revolution, displacement and deadly anti-Semitic pogroms, but \"the war marked the end of the world\" as they knew it. With help of relatives who had left for the United States decades earlier, she embarked alone, a few days before her 21st birthday, for a new life in the \"freest country on earth.\" The rest of her family never left Soviet Russia.\n\nUpon arriving in New York, she immediately changed her name. Heller explores possible sources, but why Rand chose this name remains a mystery. Rand set about learning the language (she could only speak a few words). After spending six contentious months with relatives in Chicago perfecting her English skills and going to the movies - Heller says she saw 138, she headed west on borrowed money \"to conquer Hollywood.\"\n\nThere, legend has it, she serendipitously met - some say stalked - her hero, director Cecil B. DeMille, who made her an extra in his movie \"Kings of Kings.\" With his help, she became a junior screenwriter and worked on several movies before marrying handsome young actor Frank O'Connor - just as her visa was about to expire. It was \"a shotgun wedding, with Uncle Sam holding the gun,\" she would later joke. Taking a job as a clerk in RKO's wardrobe department just before the 1929 stock market crash, she set off on her next adventure: a writing career.\n\nSuccess came five years later with a play, \"The Night of January 16th.\" It opened to positive reviews, but Rand would encounter the disappointment that would come with all her work. The reviewers missed, or ignored, the point. \"I wanted raves that raved about the right things. The reviews were not intelligent.\"\n\nHer first novel, \"We the Living\" (1936), inspired by her experiences in Russia, set her up as an anti-communist spokesman exposing the \"pink penetration in America.\" It was this notoriety, Heller writes, that caused her to be temporarily ostracized by the movie industry and might have been the reason she was unable to get her parents out of Russia. It was also during the process of getting this novel published, Heller explains, that she began to hear \"the word 'intellectual' used pejoratively ...\"\n\nIn the 41/2 years it took Rand to write \"The Fountainhead\" she began to coalesce the philosophy that sprouted wings in her magnum opus \"Atlas Shrugged.\" She wrote a short, futuristic, anti-totalitarian novel, \"Anthem,\" but was unable to get it published in the U.S. until after the commercial success of \"The Fountainhead.\" (It was published in England in 1938.)\n\nIt was also during this period that Rand began to withdraw into the cult-like intellectual bubble that surrounded her for the rest of her life - only the like-minded anointed few were admitted and transgressors were summarily and totally dismissed. Heller takes us deep into the psychological and sexual relationship, first with her husband and then with her primary acolyte, lover and intellectual heir apparent Nathaniel Brandon. He, along with his wife, Barbara, and fellow \"children of 'The Fountainhead' \" Alan Greenspan and Leonard Peikoff, became the nucleus of the philosophical movement, entitled Objectivism, that grew out of her novels and totally occupied the rest of her life. She died in 1982.\n\nDespite becoming a lightening rod for mean-spirited criticism because of her atheism, her support of abortion, her rejection of feminism and her dogmatic and unrelenting support for capitalism, Rand's popularity endures. Her books, some of the most popular in history, are still best-sellers.\n\nHow would Rand have reacted to the current economic problems? Certainly not as former disciple and current economic guru Greenspan did when grilled at a Senate hearing in October 2008. Waffling, he conceded to a flaw in his ideology of unbridled capitalism. Rand would have steadfastly stood by her principles. She would have said that it was not capitalism that caused the latest crisis. It was the looters: the bankers, who rather than being the instruments of growth, became the bureaucrats of greed, who have turned our financial system into a game of craps where nothing is produced.\n\nLee Scott lives in Avondale."
