We encourage young people to read Ayn Rand and become passionate about her ideas through educational programs, articles, talks, blog posts and social media.\n\nAyn Randâ€™s philosophy offers a much-needed antidote to the present culture. Your contribution will help us promote her ideas to the widest possible audience."
