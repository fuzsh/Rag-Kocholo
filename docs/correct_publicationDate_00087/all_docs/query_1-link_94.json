        "text": "A classic dystopian work by Ayn Rand\n\nHaving read other classic works by Ayn Rand, I was not surprised by the theme of this work given her atheist perspective. This is a short story set in a world where there is uniformity, everyone is the same, they are told what to think, where to work, live, and ultimately die. Although this may lead one to think the author is stepping outside of her objectivism philosophy, in the end it is still the \"I\" that prevails in an Orwellian setting.\n\nTwo positives; it was a short listen and the narrator, Kevin Kollins, did an excellent job with a clear and steady pace. The monotone approach he used was just perfect for the subject matter.\n\nI would recommend this work, not for ones enjoyment, but rather to get a different perspective on a world based upon only self-centered hope. That and whether or not one likes Rand's philosophies, she does have a way with words. A review copy of this audiobook was provided by the author, narrator, or publisher at no cost in return for this unbiased review. If you found this review helpful, please take a moment to click yes below.\n\nI Enjoyed It\n\nIf you want a quick book to introduce you to Ayn Rand then this would be the one. When I listened to this the movies 1984 and Metropolis came to my mind. I enjoy Ms. Rand's writings but they are not for everyone. Kevin Kollins did an excellent job narrating this work. He kept a bit faster pace than most books are read at but it was easy to keep up with him. I would recommend this to my friends with similar tastes.\n\nI was given this free review copy audio book at my request and have voluntarily left this review.\n\nGreat Story with Great Narration\n\nI was given this free review copy audiobook at my request and have voluntarily left this review. This review is for the audio copy of Anthem by Ayn Rand and narrated by Kevin Kollins. . I asked for this book because I like Ayn Randâ€™s writing and philosophy. This is a relatively short story written by a legend of an author therefore not much else needs to be said about the story. The narrator did a fabulous job of bringing this story to life within my head. I had read the book years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was pure pleasure to be able to listen to it. I highly recommend Ayn Rand (of course...) and narrator Kevin Kollins.\n\nThe \"I\" over the \"We\"\n\nIt's hard not to compare Anthem to 1984. Anthem could be considered the unofficial and unintentional sequel. Written both by people with similar Soviet backgrounds and written with similar purposes in mind. The good thing Rand does is build up the background quick as that's what makes the story the most interesting. There isn't really a need to build much of a character since the whole point in for everyone to be character-less. Anthem follows a lot of Rand's other motifs with the society at large wanting for collectivist control. Here, that system has won. And in similar Randian fashion, the individual that resides in the spirit of man attempts to break free. As far as a complete philosophy being built up, you'll have to read her other novels to get that. Rand's attempt is to show what would happen if the ideology of communism developed a Utopian society - even when civilization is destroyed by it to rule over men by man is deeply set. Anthem does what it sets out to do - to promote the need for the \"I\" rather than the \"we\". Final Grade - B+\n\nLiving without Individuality\n\nI'm not a fan of Ayn Rand's beliefs, but she does certainly know how to write interesting stories (even if Atlas Shrugged needs a sharp editor with even sharper scissors). 'Anthem' is a short story that shows her ability to write interesting stories, characters and settings.\n\n'Anthem' is set is a dystopia future where there is no individuality, there is no 'I', people do exactly what they are told for work, think what they are told to think, live how they are told to live, etc. Everyone has numbers, not names. It is told in a first person POV, but with the main character (Equality 7-2521) referring to himself as 'we' for by his number, never by 'I'. But slowly Equality 7-2521 is discovering his own thoughts and ideas, and love.\n\nNarration by Kevin Kollins is good. He is faster paced than most (which is likely why this version has a short running time than other version of the book) but is easy to follow along with and easy to listen to.\n\nI was voluntarily provided this free review copy audiobook by the author, narrator, or publisher.\n\nA writer well before her time.\n\nThis is a easy intro to this Authors much longer and heavier works.\n\nIt is a harbinger For all the ugly Dictatorships to follow in the 20th and 21st\n\ncentury,with all the pain and suffering it brought to those countries and\n\nthe world.It is a great way to have a glimpse into a controversial writer\n\nwho starts heated debates among intellectuals of all political persuasions.\n\nThe narrator does a good job in creating the right mood for this work.\n\nThis book was given to me for free at my request and I provided this voluntary review.\n\nCertainly piqued my interest in Rand...\n\nI was surprised at how much I liked Anthem. This was my first time reading Ayn Rand and I actually wasn't ever planning on reading any Rand, but the opportunity presented itself on audiobook boom and I figured, why not? This is a satisfying short story and an easy intro to the author's body of work. The narrator is excellent...very talented. He brings the character to life and captures the inherent oddness of the story with a believably blunted affect, where applicable. Anthem has certainly piqued my interest in Rand.Thank you to the author, the narrator, and audiobook boom for the complimentary copy of the book in exchange for this fair and unbiased review."
