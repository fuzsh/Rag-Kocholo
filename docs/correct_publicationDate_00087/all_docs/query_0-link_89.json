In an age that had lost all trace of science and civilization he had the courage to seek and find knowledge. But these were not the crimes for which he would be hunted. He was marked for death because he had committed the unpardonable sin: he had stood forth from the mindless human herd. He was a man alone.” TAKEN FROM THE BACK COVER OF THE CENTENNIAL EDITION OF THIS BOOK\n\nEgo In A New Light… Ayn Rand’s “Anthem”\n\nI’m the first to admit that I don’t read all that much… I never have. I’ve always heard that the best Writers, or at least Most Writers, are also ‘avid’ readers.\n\nBut for me, Math, and Creative Writing were my best areas in school.\n\nA’s and B’s in Math, and B+’s in Creative Writing.\n\nD’s and C’s in Grammar, Lol.\n\nMy mind just worked a certain way.\n\nThat said, though I’ve averaged over 1,000 words a day in the last 17 months in what has been the beginning of my pursuit of being a Writer for a living, I just don’t read very much.\n\nEither I get sleepy when I try, or I feel like “You should be Writing, not Reading”… And so it’s gone, Lol\n\nHowever, for Christmas, a very good friend of mine sent me a copy of Ayn Rand’s “Anthem”.\n\nThe “Centennial Edition” to be precise.\n\nWhich includes both her Original 1938, England Published Version in the back of the book with her notes on it showing some changes she had made in the style of it (Not the Content/Or meaning). But the Edited/Style updated version is the main version in the front of the book.\n\nThat said, my friend, knowing that I’m not all that much of a Reader, but also knowing that I have some Familiarity with Ayn Rand, primarily from my upbringing, and most recently from seeing the New “Atlas Shrugged” Film (Part I, I haven’t seen Part II yet).\n\nSent me Ayn Rand’s “Anthem”, because she knew that it was one of her Shorter Books, and thus I might end up reading it.\n\nMy History With Ayn Rand;\n\nThough limited, I do have some history in regards to Ayn Rand.\n\nI’ve never before read any of her books (Until now), but My Boss, and Mom’s Boyfriend of 30+ years, is indeed an Avid Reader, and had read many of her books years ago.\n\nIn fact, “The Fountain Head” was a major influence on him in college, which lead him to switching his Major in Art (I believe it was Art), to Majoring in Architecture. (I believe the main character in The Fountainhead is an Architect)\n\n30+ Years Later, he’s one of the Best, most Interesting Architects I’ve ever been exposed to.\n\nMoving on… My Mom and her Boyfriend actually met one another at was called a “Workshop”… This Workshop was run by a Psychologist, who not only Practiced Counseling, but also ran Workshops based on the work of a man named ‘Nathaniel Branden‘.\n\nAnd Nathaniel Branden actually was in a relationship with Ayn Rand many years back.\n\nAnd so you see, I definitely had my exposure in regards to Ayn Rand.\n\nAll indirectly… And yet, exposure none the less.\n\nMy Opinion/Review of “Anthem”;\n\nMy Friend was right… Due to it’s length, who had Written it, and who had Given me the book, these things lead to me actually making the time to read it.\n\nSome of the Introduction a couple weeks ago, and the rest of the Introduction, the Author’s Forward, and the Newer Edited Version of the Story Late Yesterday Afternoon/Last Night.\n\nThe Central Message;\n\nNow like I say, I’m not much of a Reader (Though I am an Avid Film Watcher), and this is my First Ever Book Review… But I’d say the Central Message in this book is based on Ayn Rand’s Philosophy of Objectivism.\n\n”\n\nObjectivism is a philosophy created by Russian-American philosopher and novelist Ayn Rand (1905–1982). Objectivism’s central tenets are that reality exists independent of consciousness, that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception, that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive logic, that the proper moral purpose of one’s life is the pursuit of one’s own happiness (or rational self-interest), that the only social system consistent with this morality is full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez-fairecapitalism, and that the role of art in human life is to transform humans’ metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form—a work of art—that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally.[citation needed]\n\nRand characterized Objectivism as “a philosophy for living on earth”, grounded in reality, and aimed at defining human nature and the nature of the world in which we live.[1]”\n\nala WIKIPEDIA\n\nAnd in Ayn Rand’s own words;\n\nMy philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\n\n—Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged[2]\n\nalso ala WIKIPEDIA\n\nAlright, so this story takes place in a Dark Dystopian Future, where Men (And Woman) follow a ‘We’ Philosophy, as opposed to an ‘I’ Philosophy.\n\nWhere all things are based on a ‘Collective’ mentality. Meaning all that we do, is for the Greater Good of our Fellow Man/Woman, and is not based on our Individual Needs, and/or Wants.\n\nAnd all of our Decisions, including what field of work we go into, and who we ‘Mate’ with, are supplied by an Appointed Council.\n\nBasically.\n\nI don’t want to get all that technical, but I think you get the gist.\n\nFor me Star Trek’s ‘The Borg’ come to mind… But that’s mainly because this book was Written in 1937, and thus this Fundamental Idea has been used in many ways in Stories, and/or Television and Film.\n\nPlot;\n\nA Man Called “Equality 7-2521” (Nope, People don’t even get to have True Names), considers himself cursed, because as he goes through the early part of his life, he can not seem to control his ‘Own Personal Interests/Passions’ Etc.\n\nAnd so the basic Plot is about how he suffers because he is different, and slowly, piece by piece, starts to more and more figure out ways to Express Himself as an Individual (As Opposed to one of the Collective)… And when I say “Express” himself, I don’t mean Publicly Initially, I mean Privately. And when I say Privately, I mean when he is Alone, which is supposed to be ‘Never’, but he finds/makes a way.\n\nCharacters;\n\nTo me the main Character, initially, is Quite Tormented Internally… Partly because he can not Pursue his Own Individual Interests/Passions Etc… Partially because he feels he is Cursed, and is Ashamed of himself that he does not only think of his Brothers/Sisters, and instead thinks about what Makes ‘Him’, as an Individual, Happy.\n\nThe Girl… The Girl, or as he comes to call her “The Golden One”, appears to have some Inner Strength inside her as well, and is Instantly Drawn to him.\n\nEgo;\n\nI have come to find out that Ayn Rand generally has Cut and Dry/Working Titles for her Books, and then Changes them for the Sake of Publishing. The main part of this seems to be that her Working Titles “Give Too Much Away”, and thus she Creates Names that are not as Obvious, and also wants them to be more Intriguing… So to speak. Her reason, she wants people to figure out the meanings of the Books for their selves.\n\nA Noble/Admirable thing I think/feel.\n\nAnd so, the Initial Title of “Anthem”, was actually “Ego”… On that note, I’d highly recommend Reading Both the ‘Introduction’, and ‘Author’s Forward’, prior to Reading this Book. This is where she explains these things, and I found it very insightful going forward into the Reading of the Story.\n\nNow the Funny thing about the word “Ego”, in my opinion… Is in my experience of the word Ego, it is, and/or has been, primarily used, and/or thought of in a Derogatory Light…\n\nIn such statements as “He has a Huge Ego… So watch out”… Or, “That Guys Ego is out of control”.\n\nNow this is in my, American, mostly Southern California, experience of the word.\n\nHere’s what Webster thinks of the Word;\n\n1 : the self especially as contrasted with another self or the world\n\n3 : the one of the three divisions of the psyche in psychoanalytic theory that serves as the organized conscious mediator between the person and reality especially by functioning both in the perception of and adaptation to reality — compare\n\nHmm… A bit different than the Common Use of the word… Or at least in My Experience.\n\nBut Ego is a word that I had already, in my own life, come to realize ‘Isn’t’ a Derogatory Term in its ‘Purist’ Sense…\n\nIt basically has something to do with an ‘Individual’s’ Sense of Self, and Self Worth I believe.\n\nThat said, Ayn Rand’s use of the Word, I believe, has more to do with its ‘True’ Meaning, not what we, or at least I, have been most often exposed to.\n\nAnd this is True with many Words. It’s funny how Words so often Mean One Thing to one person, and something Completely Different to another. I think this is even more evident, when the people speaking are each from different countries. But that’s just my opinion.\n\nMy Overall Opinion of The Book;\n\nIn the end, something in addition to the Fundamental Message in the Book, which is basically the ‘Importance Of The ‘I”, and the Potentially Destructive/Devastating Nature of the ‘We’ way of thinking…\n\nAt least what I found Truly Fascinating, was the Process that the Main Character goes through in ‘Breaking’ down one Philosophy (Which he’s known all of his life), and basically ‘Creating/Building’ a Whole New Philosophy, and Way of Being/Living, pretty much wholly based on a Human’s Innate Primal Instincts, in all respects… Be it Love, Survival, Time Alone, Internal Thoughts Etc.\n\nI think if I had been brought up in a ‘Less’ Freedom of Speech/Thought Etc. kind of Environment, this Book would have had an even More Profound Impact one me.\n\nBut because I was not, what it did for me is 1) Gave Me Further Appreciation For Ayn Rand, A Writer/Person Who Literally Breeds The Importance of “Free Will” 2) Reminded me of the Simplicities of Life, that we often take for granted, often by no fault of our own… 3) A Sense of Appreciation of, like I say, The Breaking Down of One Belief System, and Building, From Scratch, of Another 4) As a Writer, it also Reminded me of some of the Fundamental Essences of ‘Sci-Fi’ Writing, that you can find in such Films as “Logan’s Run”, “Planet Of The Apes” (The old one’s), and even “Journey To The Center Of The Earth”… Touching on such Fundamental (And I’m using this word a lot)… Lets switch up to ‘Rudimentary’… Primal, Basic things, that really Give One’s Insides a Tussle… So to speak, Lol\n\nIt’s a Good Book… Very Basic (Meaning Simplistic In Form)… Very Primal… Very, yes here I go again, ‘Fundamental’… And I feel, Very Important… And I Highly Recommend it.\n\nKeep in mind, if you’re like me, or even if you’re not… It’s only 105 Pages (At least in this Edition).\n\nAnd it gets you thinking… And it gets you wanting to Write Your Own Stuff… And it might even Inspire you to Read More of other People’s Stuff, which it has for me.\n\nNuff Said\n\nThanks For Listening/Reading\n\nWould Love to Hear Your Thoughts\n\nDarkJade-\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nThis entry was posted on January 12, 2013 at 12:28 pm and is filed under Book Review, Editorial, Fiction, Inspiration, Life, Novella, Science Fiction, Short Story, Writing with tags Ayn Rand's Anthem.
