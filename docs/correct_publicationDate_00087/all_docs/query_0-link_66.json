        "text": "The edits and revisions of Ayn Rand’s novella, Anthem, strengthen the message that collectivism is oppressive and objectivism is necessary for an individual to function. Rand’s edits of diction and sentence structure assist in developing the meaning of the novella. Ayn Rand, author of the novella Anthem, utilizes diction and sentence structure in order to develop the villainy of collectivism and the virtue of objectivism. Rand’s choice of diction in the edited novella complicates and confuses the meaning. In the original manuscript, Rand omits the word “reason,” on two separate occasions, the original statement was “I need no reason … I am the reason” (234). However, this word choice diminishes the power of the statement because it does …show more content…\n\nIn the revised edition of Anthem, Rand utilizes the word “warrant,” the revised statement is “I need no warrant … I am the warrant” (94). Rand’s choice of diction promotes Equality’s enlightened sense of empowerment and develops a deeper meaning. The word warrant is a strong verb and is defined as a necessity, Rand uses it to present the idea that objectivism is necessary for society to function. Furthermore, Rand chooses to state that Equality is done with “this creed of corruption” (97). Rand’s word choice strengthens the statement and allows for deeper meaning, the use of diction creates room for implication. Moreover, the room for the implication raises the intellect level of the novella and creates a mutual sense of respect between the author and reader that can only be established by leaving space for the audience to imply. Through Rand’s diction it can be implied that totalitarianism is an evil entity that only seeks in its own interest. Also, Rand manifests Equality’s freedom at the end of the novella through the use of “my,” as he states “my beacon and my banner” (104). Therefore, Rand solidifies the deeper meaning through her use of diction by creating a separation between the collective government’s and Equality’s beliefs. Moreover, the use of “my,” creates a sense of objectivism that the government forbids (104). Overall, Rand’s revised choice of diction exemplifies the deeper …show more content…\n\nThe revised manuscript, Rand utilizes shorter sentences in order to address the issue: But I am done with this creed of corruption (97).\n\nThe use of shorter sentences develops the issue of the novella, which is the idea that a totalitarian government is villainous. However, in a different situation Rand utilizes complex sentences, nineteen to twenty-one words, to develop the meaning of the novella: It is my mind which thinks, and the judgement of my mind is the only searchlight that can find the truth. It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is the only edict I must respect (94).\n\nThe use of complex sentences serves to portray Equality’s complex thought process, which was obtained through knowledge. Furthermore, Rand utilizes complex sentence to demonstrate the difference collectivism and objectivism has on an individual 's thoughts and ideas. Also, in Rand’s edits she omits a paragraph, which concerns “the holy war” (253). The omission of this paragraph creates an allusion to the bible, it leaves room to imply that Equality is a prophet. Moreover, Rand’s allusion deepen the message that objectivism is a necessity, while objectivism is an evil that must be stopped. Therefore, Rand’s revisions establish an expansive meaning of the"
