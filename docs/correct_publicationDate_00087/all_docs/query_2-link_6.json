        "text": "'Til earth and heaven ring,\n\nRing with the harmonies of Liberty;\n\nLet our rejoicing rise\n\nHigh as the list'ning skies,\n\nLet it resound loud as the rolling sea.\n\nSing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,\n\nSing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;\n\nFacing the rising sun of our new day begun,\n\nLet us march on 'til victory is won.\n\nStony the road we trod,\n\nBitter the chastening rod,\n\nFelt in the days when hope unborn had died;\n\nYet with a steady beat,\n\nHave not our weary feet\n\nCome to the place for which our fathers sighed?\n\nWe have come over a way that with tears has been watered,\n\nWe have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,\n\nOut from the gloomy past,\n\n'Til now we stand at last\n\nWhere the white gleam of our bright star is cast.\n\nGod of our weary years,\n\nGod of our silent tears,\n\nThou who has brought us thus far on the way;\n\nThou who has by Thy might\n\nLed us into the light,\n\nKeep us forever in the path, we pray.\n\nLest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,\n\nour hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee;\n\nShadowed beneath Thy hand,\n\nMay we forever stand,\n\nTrue to our God,\n\nTrue to our native land."
