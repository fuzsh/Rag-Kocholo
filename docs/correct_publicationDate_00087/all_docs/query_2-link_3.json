In this lesson, you’ll examine various literary aspects of Anthem — exploring its archaic, quasi-biblical writing style, its literary form as a series of journal entries and the most striking aspect of the novella’s written style: the total absence of singular pronouns from the language of the people of Anthem. What is the significance of each of these literary features, and why did Rand choose to employ them for this unique literary work?",
