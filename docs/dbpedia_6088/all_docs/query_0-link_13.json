The idea of a major international conference on plaster casts arose after a small but enthusiastically received study day Plaster Casts: Making Collecting and Display organized by Eckart Marchand at the University of Reading in October 2005. At Oxford, the team of organizers consisted of Prof. Donna C. Kurtz, Director of the Beazley Archive at the University of Oxford and the present editors. The overwhelming response to a call for papers enabled us to bring together a strong and coherent programme. Speakers, chairs and delegates represented a wide community of scholars, curators, conservators and artists with interests in the material and technique from twelve countries across Europe and the Americas. This volume presents revised versions of the contributions, largely in the sequence in which they were presented at the event. A strong promoter of casts at Oxford, Donna Kurtz contributed decisively to the planning and conception of the conference, and we would like to thank her for those efforts. In addition, the facilities and resources of the Beazley Archive that she directs were of great help for the organization of the event, not the least Nicole Harris, the secretary of the Archive. We should also like to thank R. R. R. Smith, Lincoln Professor of Classical Archaeology at Oxford, and Curator of the Cast Gallery of the Ashmolean Museum, for being a great support at all stages of the conference. Speakers and delegates were housed in Worcester College, Oxford, and welcomed at a reception by its Provost, Mr Richard Smethurst. We would like to thank him and the College for their interest in and support of the conference. Additional events included an excursion to and generous reception at the house of James Perkins at Aynhoe Park, and visits to the Sir John Soane’s Museum and the Royal Academy of Arts’ plaster cast collection at Burlington House in London, where groups were guided by Helen Dorey and Helen Valentine respectively. All three excursions provided privileged inside views into exciting collections and we are deeply indebted to our hosts. An important aim of the conference was to act as a forum for the members of various disciplines and professional groups to exchange ideas and opinions through formal and informal discussions. If the accompanying programme supported the informal exchanges, the sessions provided ample time for structured plenary debates. The chairs contributed greatly to the success of the\n\nXII\n\nPreface\n\nconference through their knowledgeable and inspiring steering of sessions and discussion periods. We should like to express our thanks to all of them – David Bone, Christoph Frank, Valentin Kockel, Donna Kurz, Greg Sullivan, Marjorie Trusted, Timothy Wilson, Jonathan Wood and Jan Zahle. We should also like to thank those speakers whose contributions for various reasons did not enter the present volume: Christoph Frank, Martha Gyllenhaal, John Kenworthy Brown, Donna Kurtz, Michael Neilson, Stephan Schmid, R.R.R. Smith and Marina Sokhan. We are grateful to Sabine Vogt and Manfred Link of De Gruyter and to Rainer Ostermann for all their work towards the production of this book. For her extensive contributions during all stages of the editing process we should like to thank Alison Wright, and we are grateful to Bob Cook for scientific advice and to Lena Hoff for help with the compilation of the indexes. The conference could not have been realized without the generous financial support of the Elizabeth Cayzer Charitable Trust and various benefactors and institutions of the University of Oxford, including the Craven Committee, the Fell Fund, the Classics Faculty, the History Faculty and the Mortimer and Teresa Sackler Fund of Worcester College. The publication of this volume was generously supported by the Henry Moore Foundation, Leeds, and, again, Worcester College’s Sackler Fund and the Craven Committee. Finally, we should like to express our gratitude to the authors of this volume, for their exciting contributions, constructive collaboration and for their patience during the long process of editing. Rune Frederiksen and Eckart Marchand Athens and London 2009\n\nIntroduction RUNE FREDERIKSEN AND ECKART MARCHAND\n\nOn 28 February 2006 at Sotheby’s, New York, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, sold the remains of a plaster cast collection that was once the Museum’s pride. In the history of plaster casts the sale may be seen as the grand finale of a century of decline and rejection, during which individual casts and entire cast collections were silently moved into storage (first temporary, then permanent), left to their own devices (and discarded when finally deemed irreparable), violently attacked, or simply professionally removed and destroyed. The reasons for this development are many and they are interrelated, including the rejection of a western canon of art that these casts had come to represent and re-enforce, the twentieth-century veneration of the original and the consequent rejection of casts as worthless copies. Interest in the original’s material qualities accompanied rejection of the casts’ dull appearance, the increased availability of the originals through cheap mass travel and photography, as well as a more general decline in interest in sculpture and competition for storage space. The fate of the reproductive cast was often shared by collections of cast by individual artists, quite unjustly, as here the status of the cast was often a very different one.1 Yet, the recent sale in New York also coincided with a renewed interest in plaster casts and cast collections that has built up over the last three decades. To some extent the faithful promoters of the plaster cast as a teaching tool and means of full-scale representation of absent works have learned to make their case more forcefully, but new interests in the history of reception, the history of collecting, artists’ training and working methods, as well as a wider recognition of the appeal of these objects when dramatically staged, all contributed to the present revival of the plaster cast. The parameters have changed. Many cast collections now have different functions to those they had when originally set up and the production of new casts competes with modern reproduction technologies and meets, among other obstacles, with curatorial concern\n\n___________ 1\n\nSee in the present volume the discussion, by Greg Sullivan, of the Chantrey Collection at Oxford.\n\n2\n\nRune Frederiksen and Eckart Marchand\n\nabout the surfaces of originals, for example with regard to traces of polychromy on ancient sculpture that could be eradicated when making casts from them. When it comes to the reproductive plaster cast, that still dominates the perception of what plaster casts are, the emphasis of the present revival lies in questions of use, display, conservation and research into existing and lost works rather than the building up of new collections. The last decades have seen the re-opening and/or cataloguing of cast collections of different character, including private collections in stately homes, research and teaching collections that belong to university departments and those that relate to individual artists’ workshops. The Beazley Archive in Oxford was a pioneer in publishing basic information on plaster casts on-line from 1998, in its case relative to the Ashmolean Museum’s Cast Collection. Today many more collections have their own websites, a growing number of them with complete illustrated on-line catalogues.2 In the French speaking world, the Association Internationale pour la Conservation et la Promotion des Moulages has since the 1980s convened a series of mainly francophone conferences on plaster casts, published their acts and built up a website that lists an ever-expanding number of plaster cast collections whilst offering itself as a forum for plaster cast research.3 More recently, the Fondazione Canova at Possagno initiated a series of conferences on plaster cast collections and published the proceedings of the first of these.4 The present volume is conceived as a contributor and catalyst in this development. As the edited papers of a conference that drew on a widely publicized call for papers, it is representative of the richness and range of present research interests in this area. In some cases the editors complemented this, not least through their own contributions, but generally they did not commission papers. The present intro-\n\n___________ 2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nOnly to mention a few: The Cast Collection at the Danish National Gallery (for the images) [accessed 1 November 2009], and the homepage of the Friends of the collection (for the catalogue information) [accessed 1 November 2009]; Georg-August-Universität Göttingen [accessed 1 November 2009]; Ashmolean Museum/University of Oxford [accessed 1 November 2009].

Collections of reproductive plaster casts that consist of objects made to substitute absent originals have dominated and conditioned the perception of plaster casts at least for the last hundred years. These collections are, by and large, an invention of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The making of plaster casts and the use of the material for artistic and architectural ends in general, though, go back to Egyptian antiquity and beyond and have remained diverse and versatile practises throughout the history of the material. Ancient plaster casts are studied in the present volume by Rune Frederiksen and Christa Landwehr who discuss functions of the medium in the workshop, including that of life masks, and as an aid for copying of models, the latter discussed by Landwehr in relation to finds from a Roman sculpture workshop in Baiae in Italy. Frederiksen also discusses casts after sculptures that were apparently displayed in their own right in private contexts. Casting and moulding techniques in plaster and related materials were also extensively used in antiquity as decoration for built interiors, with the coffered dome of the Pantheon, cast in concrete, and the stucco decorations of the vaults of the Domus Aurea in Rome being two very prominent examples. These traditions continued in the Eastern Roman Empire and it was apparently through Byzantine craftsman that a tradition of stucco sculpture continued in Italy, France and the Holy Roman Empire throughout the Middle Ages. A particular tradition developed in lower Saxony with monuments in Hildesheim, Gernrode and Halberstadt. The article by Daniela and Torsten Arnold and Elisabeth Rüber-Schütte in the present volume introduces this group and focuses on the Choir Screens at Halberstadt (c. 1200), illuminating their technique and present conservation. During the Renaissance, in and increasingly beyond Italy, casts were made after the famous works of ancient Rome, in plaster and other, more durable and more valued media. Primaticcio’s casts made for the King of France are a particularly famous case. Their copying and distribution outside Italy is discussed by Walter Cupperi in the present book, while Eckart Marchand’s article addresses the wider artistic and architectural practices that employed the materials and techniques related to casting in plaster during the late Middle Ages and Renaissance in Italy, providing sixteenth-century artists with the skills to produce casts after the antique. Marchand also maps the spread of Renaissance stucco decorations, developed in Rome on the model of the Domus Aurea, a type of decoration that was exported from Italy by Primaticcio together with his casts to Fontainebleau. Nicholas of Modena, one of the artists working in Fontainebleau was in charge of the decoration of the court-\n\n4\n\nRune Frederiksen and Eckart Marchand\n\nyard at Nonsuch, one of the residences of Henry VIII. The remains of this palace were excavated in 1959 by Martin Biddle who presents and interprets this decoration in his article. In the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, plaster casts entered the collections of artists, humanists, the rich and the noble. The Paduan Mantova Benavides Collection, built up in the middle of the sixteenth century, contained plaster casts of limbs that may have belonged to earlier artists’ collections, casts after works of art, ancient and contemporary, and casts after artists’ models. Some of these may have been displayed as heads of Famous Men, in a tradition that was to extend into the nineteenth century when, for example in Germany, the production of plaster cast busts of Famous Men such as Goethe and Beethoven would develop industrial dimensions. The operations of a London cast maker, Charles Smith, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is discussed here by Peter Malone. The wide range of different types of objects found in the Mantova Benavides Collection was typical for the Renaissance and Baroque Wunderkammer (the Bavarian Wunderkammer, for example, contained a plaster cast of the crippled hands of a peasant5), but in the seventeenth and eighteenth century the collecting of casts after ancient statuary would become increasingly a trade in its own right. As Ángeles Solís Parra, Judit Gasca Miramón, Silvia Viana Sánchez and José María Luzón Nogué discuss in this volume, in the seventeenth century the Spanish King sent his court artist, Diego Velázquez, to Rome to acquire casts of the highest quality after some of the most important Roman statues. The demands regarding the quality of these casts as indicated by the surviving contracts demonstrate the power, financial means and technical knowledge of the royal envoy. The Grand Tourists who came to Rome in the following two centuries were generally less well informed and had to rely on a network of cast makers, local and foreign artists, dealers and traders who would obtain, package and send casts to destinations overseas.6 The present contributions by Helen Dorey and Valentin Kockel refer to such collections by members of the professional classes in Britain. The situation in Germany was quite different.

The mechanisms of trade in this situation are discussed by Charlotte Schreiter who looks particularly at two protagonists, the local trader and cast maker Carl Christian Heinrich Rost and the Italian travelling firm, the Ferrari brothers. Germany was of course central for the study of classical antiquity and archaeology, shaping the scholarly use of plaster cast collections in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Plaster casts played a role in the milieu of Johann Joachim Winckelmann, as is evidenced, for example, by his own comments on the medium as well as the collection of his close friend, the artist Anton Raphael Mengs. This early collection survives and has recently received a thorough examination by Moritz Kiderlen.7 The University of Göttingen with the first Chair of Archaeology anywhere in Europe and its founding professor, Christian Gottlob Heyne, are referenced in the present volume by Schreiter, Daniel Graepler and Jan Zahle, as is the collection of the Berlin Academy of Art in the article by Claudia Sedlarz. The history of the Göttingen cast collection goes back to the later 1760s. The collection has been catalogued and its history documented by Klaus Fittschen in 1990.8 Graepler’s contribution in this volume focuses particularly on the University’s casts after ancient and modern gems, the so-called Dactyliothecae. Another early German university collection, founded in 1820, is that of the University of Bonn. Still, the scholarly study of sculpture through casts was for the most part of the nineteenth century facilitated by the collections of artists’ academies and museums. Thus, outside Germany, the model of the University collection as a laboratory that facilitates the study of Classical Archaeology was not immediately emulated. This happened finally in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as a consequence of the installation of Chairs in Archaeology in European countries such as England, France and Italy. The teaching collection of the Department of Archaeology at the University of Padua is comparatively small and late, it is discussed here in the context of its early twentieth-century display. Alessandra Menegazzi’s article grants insights not only into the 1920s mis-en-scène of this collection with its strong classical references, but also makes tangible the political connotations of the collection and its staging at that time. Finally, Claudia Wagner and Gertrud Seidmann’s contribution addresses a contemporary university collection, the above mentioned Beazley Archive at Oxford, with particular focus on its extensive holdings of dactyliothecae.\n\n___________ 7 8\n\nM.

The Florentine Academia del Disegno, founded in 1564 as the first institution of this type, met in its early years in and below the New Sacristy of San Lorenzo. The study and emulation of Michelangelo’s tombs of the Medici Dukes in this ensemble was characteristic for the work of the Florentine Academicians9 and plaster casts of its allegorical sculptures were soon distributed among artists in Italy. Two full-scale casts of Michelangelo’s Dawn and Dusk were made in 1570 by Egnazio Danti, brother of the Florentine sculptor Vincenzo Danti, and must have been obtained by the Academy in Perugia shortly after its foundation in 1573.10 But plaster cast collections were not necessarily a feature of the academies that sprang up all over Europe and its colonies. Claudia Sedlarz illuminates the humble beginnings of the collection of the Academy in Berlin and Tomas Macsotay’s contribution reveals surprisingly that at the French Academy in Rome the casts had a much more important teaching function than at the Royal Academy in Paris. The Royal Academy in London was a late comer among the European Academies. The hesitant acquisition history of its early years resembles that of the Berlin collection. In the context of the conference the Royal Academy collection was informally discussed in front of its material remains by Helen Valentine who has also published on this subject.11 The academies in Stockholm and Copenhagen, following the European eighteenth-century academy trend, possessed casts from the time of their foundations (1754 and 1768 respectively) as Jan Zahle describes in his article tracing casts of the Laocoön in Scandinavia. In the nineteenth century, the Academy in Madrid was able to provide casts for academic collections in the Spanish colonies, such as the Academia de San Carlo in Mexico City, as Elisabeth Fuentes Rojas mentions in the present volume. Beyond the academies, artists had long used plaster casts as objects of study and in the different stages of the design process including the final work. While Leon Lock’s analysis of images of Netherlandish sculptors’ workshops from the seventeenth- and eighteenth centuries questions their documentary value, there is certainly plenty of more secure evidence that plaster casts played an important role in artists’ workshops from the fifteenth\n\n___________ 9\n\nZ.

The section in this volume devoted to casts in artist’s workshops and artists’ practice cannot claim to be representative, but it puts a due focus on eighteenth-century neo-classicism, late nineteenth and early twentieth century French and Italian art and the diverse uses of plaster and casting techniques by modern and contemporary artists. Johannes Myssok presents the various stages of the design processes in which Antonio Canova employed plaster, traces developments in his career and relates Canova’s use of casts to wider issues such as the truthfulness to material. Greg Sullivan in his article on the slightly later British sculptor Sir Francis Chantrey, argues that Chantrey’s plaster models had the status of originals. The neo-classical aesthetic and art production had a formative impact on the use and perception of reproductive plaster casts in museums to the present day. It was in the second half of the nineteenth century that artists, mainly French and Italian, explored the unconventional qualities of the material. A major figure in this context was Rodin;12 in the present volume, Jean François Corpataux and Sharon Hecker discuss the works of his contemporaries Marcello and Medardo Rosso. Marcello’s Pythia, including a life cast of the artist’s own shoulders, provides an exciting case through which to examine the conceptual implications of the artistic process with regard to nineteenthcentury artistic stereotypes of creativity and gender. Addressing the still too little studied work of Medardo Rosso, Sharon Hecker analyses how the sculptor broke with the neo-classical uses of plaster, drawing conceptually on the material’s association with cheapness and fragility. The modernity of plaster cast as a material is further evaluated in the Futurist context by Maria Elena Versari’s contribution on Boccioni’s use of plaster. The final rejection of the plaster cast as a teaching tool after the Second World War is the starting point of Sue Malvern’s discussion of the use of plaster casts in the work of late twentieth-century and contemporary artists such as Antony Gormley and Rachel Whiteread. A contribution by a practicing artist, Jane McAdam Freud, whose work frequently employs plaster casts, closes this section. As part of her presentation, McAdam Freud made a conference medal that was displayed at the event. With the rise of nationalism throughout Europe in the nineteenth century, national museums were instituted to present, conserve and construct the notion of a national heritage, as in the case of the National Museum in Prague, discussed here by Dana Stehlikova, and to improve citizens, and/or national\n\n___________ 12 A.

Both museums, in Prague and London, as well as the National Gallery in Athens hold reproductive casts as well as artists’s models and final works in plaster. Reproductive casts in these museums have fulfilled a variety of functions. They preserved the appearance of endangered works (see the article by Maria Kliafa and Michael Doulgerides in relation to the National Gallery in Athens), represented the narrative of a national style in one place, as in the cases of the Museum in Prague, and filled gaps in a wider art historical narrative, as for example the Royal Cast Collection as part of the National Gallery of Denmark, and the Museum of Fine Art in Boston, mentioned by Stephen Dyson in his account of American plaster cast collections. They also, of course, represented works that were seen as canonical, as in the case of London’s Victoria and Albert Museum, discussed by Diane Bilbey and Marjorie Trusted and by Malcolm Baker. In many cases they were integrated into the Museum display alongside originals, in other instances they were given their own museum, like the Musée de Sculpture Comparé in Paris, here discussed in terms of its intellectual conception by Axel Gampp, the Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow, discussed by Tobias Burg, and many American collections, such as the Slater Museum in Norwich, Connecticut, referred to by Dyson. With Ian Cooke’s article on the Auckland War Memorial Museum the volume provides insight into the installation, motivations for and reception of a cast collection in a colonial context. Here as in the case of the Mexican academy referred to earlier, art objects by local cultures would play an important counter part in the collections, in Mexico through their influence on the academy’s training, in Auckland in terms of the display and space allocation in the museum. The papers by Malcolm Baker and Axel Gampp address a particular nineteenth-century phenomenon, aptly described by Baker as “the reproductive continuum”. Plaster casts in the Victoria and Albert Museum, we find, were displayed in concert with other reproductive media, including fictile ivories, paper mosaics and photography; Gampp directs our attention to the vast collections of postcards of plaster casts issued by the Musée de Sculpture Comparé. Issues of display are addressed in Helen Dorey’s paper on the Sir John Soane’s Museum and Alessandra Menegazzi’s contribution regarding the Museo di Scienze Archeologiche e d’Arte at the University of Padua. Both are specific cases where original architectural designs and historical displays have been meticulously reconstructed. In the case of the Paduan collection the early twentieth-century display had to be adapted to accommodate modern teaching functions of the collection, while the Sir John Soane’s Museum has to keep the requirement to function as a modern museum in mind. Entirely different, but still striking the same historical and topographical keys as the Sir John\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nSoane’s Museum, James Perkin’s private display of plaster casts at Aynhoe Park represents a revival of the Country House tradition of displaying casts. The recent rise in popularity of casts is reflected in a number of recent rearrangements of museum displays to include these objects. Occasionally, old ideas are taken up, albeit in revised form, such as the chronological display of casts in teaching collections, or the display of casts alongside originals. In these, as in most other cases, casts are displayed according to the same principles as originals. A different principle, developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s and applied to the display of a cast collection, is that of the Royal Cast Collection in Copenhagen. The collection, spanning western sculpture uninterruptedly from Ancient Egypt to the Baroque, is arranged according to the same principal display contexts as the various periods themselves. Exhibition areas in the Copenhagen collection today, like the ‘Greek Sanctuary’, ‘Roman Villa’ or ‘Italian Gallery’, not only offer a rough chronological frame to the visitor, but also a sense of authentic visual context for the various sculptural forms. Statues and reliefs are seen together as they might have been experienced at the time the originals were made, but also sometimes as they were used later on throughout history. A number of recent exhibitions have realized another potential of the plaster cast. Thus, painted plaster casts have been used to illustrate the effects of polychromy, for educational purposes both in permanent displays, for example the polychromatic cast of the Igel Column in the Landesmuseum in Trier,13 and temporary exhibitions, principally the exhibition Gods in Colour (2003–8), that toured numerous museums all over the western world.14 Three articles address issues of conservation. The choir screens in Halberstadt (c. 1200), discussed by Daniela and Torsten Arnold and Elisabeth Rüber-Schütte, and the casts in the collections of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid and the National Gallery in Athens, discussed by Solís Parra et al., and Kliafa and Doulgerides, respectively, are very different object types that require specific treatments. The authors address issues raised by the in situ restoration and preservation of polychrome stucco work, and heavily over-painted and stained historical plasters as well as problems encountered during the structural reconstruction of casts that had been exposed to the elements; the list could be extended. Beyond this the three papers demonstrate different approaches and schools of conservation. The\n\n___________ 13 For the polychromy of the cast of the Igel column see H.

More than with some other types of artwork the appearance of casts is dramatically affected by conservation work and practical handling. This requires close collaboration between conservators and museum curators. Our volume ends with an article by Bernard van den Driesche, Vice Chairman of the Association Internationale pour la Conservation et la Promotion des Moulages and in charge of the Association’s website. Van den Driesche develops the notion of a grand jardin du plâtre, his vision of a global garden of plaster casts and cast collections, possibly best achieved through websites and the internet, that brings together all types of plaster cast collection, including not only those that serve artistic ends, but also ethnological, medical and other requirements. Such an encyclopaedic approach represents the richness of the material. The present volume deliberately focuses on plaster casts for artistic ends. Its aim is to highlight what is specific to individual casts, types of casts and cast collections, and thus to emphasise difference and complexity in a medium that in the past has often suffered from being perceived as familiar and onedimensional. The inclusion in papers by Marchand, Biddle, Hecker and others of plaster sculpture that involves modelling techniques also serves this purpose, reminding us that the ‘pure’ cast is a rarity. It is the editors’ hope that rather than answering all our questions in the field, the present volume will raise new ones, stimulate debate and facilitate future research on plaster and plaster casts.\n\nAntiquity\n\nPlaster Casts in Antiquity1 RUNE FREDERIKSEN The present article discusses the use of plaster casts in antiquity through the evaluation of surviving objects as well as literary evidence.2 Many articles in this volume refer to plaster casts as a medium that is closely associated with the revival of antiquity from the early Renaissance onwards. The aim of my contribution, together with that by Christa Landwehr, is to demonstrate that artists’ use of plaster casts goes back to classical antiquity itself, and to evaluate our knowledge of the medium in this period. To analyse the functions of plaster casts in antiquity is important as it enables us to understand the uses and concepts of art in the ancient world which can then form the basis of comparisons with later periods. I wish to argue that plaster casts were of great significance in the ancient world, also beyond their basic technical functions in the production and copying of works of art.\n\nPlaster as Material3 The materials of plastic art production and reproduction in antiquity were stone, clay, terracotta, faience, wood, metals, and various minerals.4 Plaster, or calcium sulphate, belongs to the last group; its technical properties make it\n\n___________ 1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nI would like to thank the following friends and colleagues for having read and improved this article at various stages of completion: Mogens Jørgensen (Copenhagen), Eckart Marchand (London), Bert Smith (Oxford) and Jan Zahle (Copenhagen). In addition I would like to thank Eckart for his very thorough and patient editing.

For a sixth-century BC example of sculpture cast in melilite: A. Baltres et al., ‘Two Archaic Casts from Histria: Mineralogy, Paint Composition and Storage Products’, Ancient West & East, 3.1 (2004), pp. 87-99, fig. 1.\n\n14\n\nRune Frederiksen\n\nparticularly suitable for copying three-dimensional art-works with great accuracy; it is easily produced, easy to handle when wet, and when poured into a mould it flows easily into all corners and hardens quickly. In addition, the material seems to have been fairly easily available and hence cheap to use. This is implied in ancient comments on the sources of plaster, and can be deduced from the large quantities of the material used, for example, as wall plaster in ancient Egypt5 and for stucco decorations in the Greek and Roman periods.6 A number of details about the provenances, properties and uses of plaster can be learned from Theophrastos, writing at the turn from the fourth to the third century BC.7 His treatise On Stones has a section on Ȗ޺ȥȠȢ (64-9)8, from which we learn that gypsos existed in large quantities in Cyprus, and that in Phoenicia and Syria it was made from burning stone, for example marble. Theophrastos informs us how gypsos behaves when pulverized and mixed with water, and it is clear that what he describes is the mineral gypsum, and the process by which it can be turned into what we would call plaster and often Plaster of Paris.9 Plaster behaves as Theophrastos describes, and gypsum is indeed still found in many places around the Mediterranean, for example in Cyprus, on Melos and in Egypt.10 The ancient Greek term gypsos does, however, cover more than our plaster, or plaster of Paris, even within the writings of Theophrastos himself, so we cannot point to all ancient attestations of the term and automatically take them to mean only plaster of Paris. We are, however, able to demonstrate, that in some instances the term gypsos, or its Latin equivalent gypsum, are used to denote specifically a cast in that material. A wonderful example is a third to second-century BC cast, now in Princeton, of an earlier Hellenistic horse’s nose-piece (probably of bronze) which bears an inscription, incised into the plaster while it was still wet: ૝ıȚįઆȡȠȣ | Ĳઁ Ȗ޺ȥȚȞȠȞ (“the plaster [...] of Isidoros”).11\n\n___________ 5 6\n\nA.

The Neolithic seventhmillennium BC statues from Aïn Ghazal near Amman in Jordan, frequently referred to as the “oldest statues of the world”, were made of modelled plaster over a framework of woven reed.12 The Egyptians used plaster as a primary sculptural medium as well, often in combination with other materials.13 Stone sculpture was sometimes modified with plaster modelled onto the stone and then painted. Well-known examples are the busts of the Egyptian fourthDynasty prince Ankhhaf (2520-2494 BC), found in his tomb at Giza14 (Fig. 1. 1), and now in Boston, and the eighteenth-Dynasty Nefertiti (c. 1351–1334 BC) from Thutmose’s workshop in Amarna, now in Berlin.15 The sculptural properties of plaster were thus known, and the sculptural appearance of the modelled plaster surface appreciated, from a very early point in history. This use of plaster for sculpture, modelled or cast, in combination with other materials, continued into the Greek and Roman periods.16 Plaster Casts Ancient plaster casts can be divided into three categories. Firstly, casts were used at various stages of the production of sculpture in other, arguably more durable, materials such as marble or bronze. Secondly, they were used as copies for the purpose of transferring three-dimensional images from one place to another. Finally they also served as artworks in their own right. Examples of the first category surfaced in Egypt in 1912 during the excavation of the workshop of the sculptor Thutmose at Amarna, dating to the end of the eighteenth Dynasty, between 1351 and 1334 BC.17 The find included twenty-seven objects in plaster, mostly casts of heads or faces, some of which are clearly portraits of Egyptian Royalty, for example the faces of Pharaoh\n\n___________ 12 See e.g. C.

Most of the Amarna casts are faces and were therefore quite simple to cast, in open one-piece moulds. The heads were mostly only cast in two separate parts, which were joined after the casting, as can be deduced, for example, from the vertical line on the neck of the Head of Nefertiti that results from the joining of the two pieces (not visible in Fig. 1. 3, but very clear in D’Alessandro and Persegati, Scultura e calchi in gesso, fig. 1). The Amarna casts seem all to have been taken from clay or wax models and served as models for final works in stone: further, they seem to be partial casts of sculptures, not of whole works, and some preserve details that show that the works they were cast from were unfinished. The casts may have been made to be sent to the commissioners, so that further progress could be discussed without them having to make their way to the workshop. Afterwards work would have continued on the clay or wax models, and, when considered finished, these were eventually carved in stone. Thus, the casts’ function differed from what in modern sculpture would be called original models in that they were not taken of models in their final stage to represent a visual idea that could later be executed in a third and more durable material.19\n\n___________ 18 A provisional list of casts in museums and collections around the world is provided at the end of this article (pp. 26-32). 19 The term can be traced at least back to the sixteenth century. In Britain original models in this sense, used for exhibition in order to find a patron, have been in use at least since the second\n\nPlaster Casts in Antiquity\n\n17\n\nFig. 1. 2: Head of Akhenaten.

The face of a bust of the Roman period in the museum in Alexandria (no. 3a, Fig. 1. 6) is a remodelled death-mask, whereas the skull and bust are cast in two separate pieces each. A layer of plaster was added onto these five components after they had been assembled, and modelled, while the plaster was still wet. This bust, then, can be classified as partly cast and partly modelled. The tell tale signs of a death mask can be seen in a similar plaster head, in the same museum (Fig. 1. 7). The cheeks are hollow and the flesh around the neck seems to have lost its tension. Unmodified death masks, taken directly of a dead person’s face to preserve facial features, have also been found, as, for example, that from Tuna el-Gebel (no. 10b, Fig. 1. 8), in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, dating from around the birth of Christ. A plaster bust of a man from Rome (no. 24) is made in the same way as the Alexandria one (no. 3a), but is even more interesting and important because it was found, alonside fragments of two additional busts, in a tomb at Via Prenestina, and thus links plaster and plaster casts to the great Roman tradition of imagines maiorum (‘images of ancestors’).21 These seem often to have been of wax – plaster is not explicitly mentioned as a material in connection with them – and they were carried around in funerary processions and exhibited in homes and tombs. With the Via Prenestina heads, we have examples of such plaster portraits of deceased ancestors. The role of plaster casts in ancient Greek and Roman sculpture production was absolutely central. For Greek sculpture this is mainly a sound assumption, whereas for the Roman period the material and circumstantial evidence is strong. The single most important find of ancient Roman casts was made in 1954 at the Roman town of Baiae, in the bay of Naples.22 This consisted of more than 400 casts of parts of at least thirty different statues23 including some\n\n___________ 20 21\n\n22 23\n\nhalf of the seventeenth century, J.

Landwehr (Die antiken Gipsabgüsse) and also treated by the same author in this volume, pp. 35-46. The sides of the casts show cuts rather than fractures so the pieces are parts of casts of statues, not random fragments from smashed casts.\n\nPlaster Casts in Antiquity\n\n19\n\nFig. 1. 6: Bust of a man.

The casts also constitute interesting evidence for the reconstruction of the process by which some or perhaps most of the thousands of Roman marble copies of Greek life size free-standing sculpture were actually made.24 This process, crucial for the understanding of the relationship between Greek originals and Roman copies was previously only known through written sources and the visual evidence of the Roman marbles themselves.25 The Baiae find is interpreted as a dump from a sculptor’s workshop, parts of what was once a collection of casts assembled by a workshop, serving as a library of form, from which whole figures or details could be copied to produce tailormade marble sculptures according to demand.26 It seems logical to assume that a number of such workshop collections of casts existed throughout the Roman world, and that, at least sometimes, Roman marble statues were copied from such casts rather than from other copies made in marble.

Richter, ‘How Were the Roman Copies of Greek Portraits Made?’, Römische Mitteilungen, 69 (1962), pp. 52-8, pls 22-6, and ‘An Aristogeiton from Baiae’, American Journal of Archaeology, 74 (1970), pp. 296-7. 25 The first groundbreaking study identifying a number of Greek works through Roman copies was A. Furtwängler, Meisterwerke der griechischen Plastik: Kunstgeschichtliche Untersuchungen (Leipzig, 1893) English trans. by E. S. Strong, Masterpieces of Greek Sculpture (Chicago, Ill., 1895). A good general introduction with selected bibliography is provided by A. Stewart, Greek Sculpture. An Exploration (New Haven, Conn., and London, 1990). 26 Landwehr, Die antiken Gipsabgüsse; C. Gasparri, ‘L’officina dei calchi di Baia’, Römische Mitteilungen, 102 (1995), pp. 173-87; Barone, Sabratha, 9.\n\nPlaster Casts in Antiquity\n\n21\n\ncasts of a form taken of the original – they were more accurate copies than those of marble made by measuring points. Loukianos, writing in the second century AD, describes in passing in his Iuppiter tragoedus (33), how a statue of Hermes in the market-place of Athens was covered, on a daily basis, in pitch or resin by sculptors making moulds of it. This is an extremely interesting attestation of the practice of copying,27 in fact of mass making of moulds that would then – we may assume – have been used to make numerous copies in plaster for artists’ studios in different regions of the Roman Empire.28 According to Pliny the Elder (Naturalis historia, 35.153) copying of statues by taking casts of them was invented already in the Greek period by Lysistratos of Sikyon, brother of the famous sculptor Lysippos, who was active in the fourth century BC.29 Pliny also says that Lysistratos was the first to cast life masks. He describes how Lysistratos would cast from the face of a living person, pour wax into the plaster negative, and rework the wax afterwards. Pliny does not say what was then done to the wax; it was probably cast back into a positive in bronze via a clay or plaster negative mould. Even without the Egyptian finds that take the practice of plaster cast making at least a millennium further back in time it would be difficult to believe Pliny’s account of its ‘invention’. Considering how advanced Greek sculpture and particularly free standing bronze sculpture was at this time, the plaster casting technique must have been widely practised in the Greek world much earlier than the fourth century. It is indeed hardly surprising that, for example, research on bronze sculpture has led to the suggestion that (plaster) casting from life was practised already in the fifth century BC.30 The earliest mentioned incident of the copying of a statue, possibly by means of a plaster cast, dates from the third century BC. Plutarch, writing in the second century AD, relates how envoys\n\n___________ 27 Examples of plaster moulds have been found, for example, in Paphos in Cyprus in a firstcentury BC bronze foundry. This mould is an instructive example in that it is part of a full size statue, i.e. the back of a male torso. Since it was found in a bronze foundry, however, it is likely to have been a cast made for a different purpose than the moulds described by Loukianos, K. Nicolaou, ‘Archaeological News from Cyprus, 1970’, American Journal of Archaeology, 76 (1972), pp. 315-16, fig. 38. 28 Richter (‘An Aristogeiton from Baiae’, American Journal of Archaeology, 74 (1970), p. 296) believed that moulds were sent from Greece more often than actual casts. Moulds do travel better, since they are less fragile, but have the disadvantage that, if damaged, (proper) repair can only happen with consultation of the original. Sculptors around the Empire could probably order moulds as well as casts from plaster cast makers employed in Athens and other centres of original Greek art. For further discussion, see Barone, Sabratha, p. 16. 29 Cf. e.g. Penny, Materials, p. 196. 30 The artist Nigel Konstam suggested after close observation of the Riacce Bronzes, particularly of the feet, that they were largely made from life casts, rather than having been modelled, N. Konstam and H. Hoffmann, ‘Casting the Riace bronzes (2): a sculptor’s discovery’, Oxford Journal of Archaeology, 23.4 (2004), pp. 397-402, figs 1-3.\n\n22\n\nRune Frederiksen\n\nof Ptolemy I of Egypt, when visiting Sinope on the Black Sea coast, took away a statue of Pluto and left behind one of Persephone after having copied it.31 It is not explicitly stated that this copy was a cast, but it is likely that it was. Attested in much greater abundance are ancient plaster casts of Greek crafts objects, in particular of relief-decorated metal tableware. The most important finds have been made in Begram in Afghanistan, Kara-Tobe in north-west Crimea and at Memphis in Egypt. In addition to these finds, a number of similar casts exist in museums and other collections across the world (e.g. nos 3b, 19, 25). 1. 9: Relief-bust (cast from mould) of PtoThe Begram find (no. 8) consist Fig. lemy I Soter. Hellenistic, early third century of twenty casts of Greek works of a BC. Plaster, h: 8.3 cm. Roemer- und Pelizaeuswide chronological range, cast in Museum, Hildesheim. Roman times, apparently to serve as models for artisans. This function can be more securely established for the Memphis find (no. 12), that was made in a workshop context. Here more than seventy casts similar to those from Begram were found. One example is the small image of a male bust (Fig. 1. 9), believed to be a portrait of the Hellenistic King Ptolemy I, dating from the early third century BC – the same Ptolemy who sent envoys to copy the statue of Persephone mentioned above. The egg-and-dart decorative band framing the image may mean that the relief was conceived of and appreciated as a finished work of art in itself, rather than just as an intermediary model for an artisan who wanted to transfer an image from one durable medium to the other. Clay and plaster moulds found in a workshop at Chersonesos in the Crimea, and in the market place (agora) of Athens,32 shed light on how these many plaster positives of ancient metal tableware were made. Impressions of clay, or alternatively, plaster33 were taken from the decoration on the metal\n\n___________ 31 Plutarch, Moralia, 984b. 32 Both ancient moulds and casts were found, see appendix below no. 6. 33 For the Begram moulds in particular, see Menninger, Untersuchungen, pp. 93-4; see also Penny, Materials, p. 195.\n\nPlaster Casts in Antiquity\n\n23\n\nobject, the clay impression was then fired, and plaster poured into the mould. The plaster positives themselves would then have been used by artists or craftsmen as examples for commissioners, who apparently desired metal ware with decorative motifs in the proper Greek style. It is quite telling that plaster casts of metal ware, and evidence for their production, have come to light from the periphery of the Classical world, like the Crimea and Afghanistan, as these were areas of artistic adoption rather than centres of original artistic production, at least with regard to the typical media and styles of the classical world. The finds of ancient Greek and Roman plaster casts from Egypt are probably to be seen in the same way, and their greater numbers probably to be explained by the preservation conditions of the dry plaster-friendly desert. One more find of plaster casts needs to be mentioned. Whereas the casts from Baiae document part of the copying process of well-known ancient Greek works of art, the finds from Sabratha in Libya (no. 26) consisted of hundreds of fragments of plaster casts and plaster moulds of reliefs, statuettes and statues. These objects show the role of plaster in a more run-of-the-mill category of ancient art. They stem from different private and public contexts, and workshops for mass production of minor arts are also identified. We have already seen how plaster was used in Egyptian sculpture in combination with other materials, and how death masks played an interesting role from an early point. A vast amount of circumstantial evidence for the use of plaster casts could also be put forward: large numbers of scenes and individual figures in Roman reliefs, sarcophagi, gems and other media, show striking similarities to the designs of those of ancient cast finds.34 This suggests, again, that casts played a role in transmitting images from one place to the other, retaining in great detail the formal qualities of the original works. Were architectural details copied in the same way as sculpture? It seems very likely that copies of mouldings, floral motifs and other types of architectural decoration were circulating between workshops or building sites of the ancient world, to be copied accurately back into stone at various times and places. So far though, we do not have any evidence for this and concrete suggestions as to where such copying might have occurred have been disproved.35 Finally, I ought to turn to the question of whether plaster casts in antiquity were occasionally appreciated as artworks in their own right, or at least dis-\n\n___________ 34 Richter, ‘Ancient Plaster Casts of Greek Metalware’, gives a number of examples. 35 It has been suggested, for example, that the (column) capitals used in the Forum Augustum in Rome were made from casts of capitals from the fifth century BC Erechtheion temple on the Athenian Acropolis. Valentin Kockel has argued that dissimilarities between these capitals make this rather unlikely. See V. Kockel, ‘Antike Gipsabgüsse von Baugliedern’, Archäologischer Anzeiger (1991), pp. 281-5, figs 1-3.\n\n24\n\nRune Frederiksen\n\nplayed as substitutes for originals, as has been the case from the Renaissance and up to our time. Juvenal criticises, in one of his satires (2.4-5) from about 100 AD, some contemporaries for trying to appear learned simply by stuffing their houses with plaster busts of the Greek stoic philosopher Chrysippos.36 The word used is gypsum, and there is no doubt that he refers to plaster casts, just as the German ‘Gips’ and the Italian ‘gesso’ can mean both ‘plaster’ as well as a ‘plaster cast of a sculpture’. The alternative reading would be that Juvenal refers to a number of individually created plaster portraits of Chrysippos in the homes of Romans, but this reading does not make sense, because we would then suddenly have original artworks that neither fit the slating remarks of Juvenal, nor what we know of what Romans exhibited in their homes.37 We know from numerous finds and references in the Roman literature that marble copies of certain original Greek portraits of Greek men of letters were standard equipment in Roman villa-libraries;38 for those to whom these marble copies were unavailable, plaster casts may have been an economically viable alternative. Plaster sculpture on display in private homes existed also in Roman Greece, as for example a statue of Dionysos seen by the Roman traveller Pausanias, writing in the second century AD (9.32.1): “Creusis, the Harbour of Thespiai, has nothing to show publicly, but at the home of a private person I found an image of Dionysos made of Gypsum and adorned with painting”.39 Given the fragility of plaster and its sensitivity towards water, we should not be surprised that hardly any such plaster casts from private Roman contexts have survived. However, at least one cast, probably of a statue of an athlete (no. 23, Fig. 1. 10), survives from such a context in Seleuceia Pieria in Turkey. The head is quite weathered, but is still an attractive find, since it may be archaeological evidence for an important phenomenon better known from the written sources. Arguably, Juvenal’s passage may be read as an implicit criticism of plaster casts. The material was cheap, and a great number of almost identical copies could be produced from the same mould, making the fabrication process inexpensive as well. Remembering that Juvenal is a single source attesting to this use of casts, and an attitude towards it, we may safely say that at least in Juvenal’s lifetime, around the middle of the second century AD, casts were\n\n___________ 36 Brill’s New Pauly. Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World. Classical Tradition, 5 vols (Leiden, 2006–), I, s.v. ‘Cast; Cast Collections B, I’ (I. Kader). 37 The original plasters Romans could have exhibited in their homes, alongside those of wax and other materials, were unique images of their forefathers, based on death (or life) masks, as the one discussed above p. 18 and listed in the appendix, no. 24. 38 R. Neudecker, Die Skulpturenausstattung römischer Villen in Italien (Mainz am Rhein, 1988). 39 Pausanias, Description of Greece, books 1-10, translated from the Greek, W. H. S.

It is tempting to develop further from the testimony of Juvenal, but while I would believe that the practice he described existed not only in Rome but elsewhere in the Empire, evidence to support this does not exist at present. Of course one could argue that since plaster as a material and casts in that material were cheap, they were, like so many other banalities of daily life, less likely to have been mentioned in our sources. And further, the material is perhaps only described by Theophrastos and Pliny precisely because these authors are dealing specifically with materials, of which gypsos-gypsum-plaster is one among many and of course had to be treated. Along the same lines, Juvenal mentioned plaster casts because, in a specific context, he could frame an attitude held by his audience, that casts were the exhibits of the ambitious middle class as opposed to the old aristocracy and upper class that owned and displayed the ‘genuine article’, namely the more frequently spoken of statues of stone and precious metals. To sum up: plaster casts were used in Antiquity both for the transmission of three-dimensional images within the artistic working process and as objects of display in their own right. In fact, all the major functions of the material plaster in plastic art as we know them from post-antique periods existed, in one form or another, already in antiquity, apart from one: the ancient world did apparently not know of cast collections in non-workshop contexts.\n\n26\n\nRune Frederiksen\n\nWhereas it is difficult to say anything about the extent to which plaster casts were used as substitutes for originals in the ancient world, their role as transmitters of form, from Greek original artworks – reliefs, statues and architectural decoration – into Roman copies of the same categories must have been tremendous.40 There would have been no massive spread of Greek art into the Roman world without casts.\n\nAppendix Provisional list of known surviving plaster casts from antiquity.

The numerous irregular and badly battered pieces of plaster evidently belonging to life-size plaster casts were found in a mass of debris used to fill a cellar room.2 Legs and hands showed signs of having been deliberately hacked apart. The reason for this may have been the lead wire and iron dowels used to reinforce the plaster;3 at some point the value of the small amounts of these materials may have exceeded that of the large statues made of plaster. According to our calculations the 400 odd fragments originate from at least twenty-four and at most thirty-three statues.4 Gisela Richter examined the fragments in the 1960s and noticed the face of Aristogeiton, which she subsequently published.5 I was able to identify fragments of eleven other statues, among them Harmodios, the Sciarra, Mattei and Sosikles Amazons, the Athena Velletri, the Aphrodite Borghese, and Eirene carrying Ploutos.6 The identifications prove beyond doubt that the Baiae plaster fragments are the remnants of casts of famous Greek bronze masterpieces of the fifth and fourth centuries BC. It is safe to assume that the casts belonged to an important atelier and that they were used to create true-to-scale marble copies. In order to provide compelling visual evidence for the identification of the Baiae fragments, I chose to have new plaster casts made from them and to have these introduced into plaster casts taken from Roman copies: the part corresponding to the Baiae fragment is simply chiseled away and the replica\n\n___________ 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nLandwehr, Gipsabgüsse Baiae, pp. 5-6 and pl. 1 a.

This project, carried out by the sculptor und restorer Silvano Bertolin, demonstrates the astonishing precision of the ancient copying technology. Reconstructions of this sort were carried out, for instance, on a cast of the Copenhagen copy of the Sciarra Amazon (Fig. 2. 1, right panel),7 into which replicas of the Baiae casts, for example parts of the right arm and right breast (Fig. 2. 1, left panels),8 were inserted. A cast of the Vatican copy of the Mattei Amazon was combined with a cast of the right arm of the Tivoli copy (Fig. 2. 2, right panel),9 into which\n\n___________ 7 8 9\n\nLandwehr, Gipsabgüsse Baiae, pp. 60-4, cat. nos 29-33 and pls 26–31.

Numerous observations made on the Baiae casts reveal the meticulous care that went into the making of the cast itself. Silvano Bertolin, who is not only a restorer but also a sculptor with training in traditional copying techniques, was kind enough to calculate the labour (in man-hours) required to make a cast of a full-sized statue such as the Sciarra Amazon. Since elastic materials such as silicon for making moulds were unknown in antiquity, this was a time-consuming process. Plaster casts of small zones of the surface of the original statue were made one by one. These fit together like a threedimensional puzzle and for the casting process they were held together by removable plaster caps.12 The casting was done in sections: the head, the arms and the column were all cast separately. The torso was cast in two parts.13 For the Amazon about 195 form pieces and thirty-eight caps would be required. About 400 man-hours would be needed for the job. Subsequently, another 100 odd hours would be required to work over the partial casts. For sculpting a true-to-scale marble copy based on the plaster replica an experienced sculptor must work about 2200 hours. In addition to the costs of the labour of two different specialized craftsmen, the expense of transportation of the plaster cast to an overseas workshop must be taken into account. On the other hand, to sculpt ‘free hand’ a marble statue of the size and shape of the Sciarra Amazon, an artist must work approximately 1400 hours. The point I want to make here is that the Roman copy, often maligned by modern art historians as an inferior product of mechanical replication, must have had a different value in the eyes of sophisticated Roman connoisseurs. The two time-consuming and laborious processes, the production of the fullsize plaster cast of the bronze original and the creation of a full-scale copy in marble via the pointing technique, made the marble copy a costly work of art, much more costly than a statue executed without the constraint of fidelity to an original. The full-size plaster casts of the bronze statues, which must have been the work of skilled specialists, were probably quite rare. The atelier in Baiae was, based on the number of casts on hand, well equipped for producing marble copies. The copies found in the vicinity of Baiae seem to reflect the activity of\n\n___________ 10 Landwehr, Gipsabgüsse Baiae, pp. 64-70, cat. nos 34-9, pls 32-40. 11 Landwehr, Gipsabgüsse Baiae, cat. nos 34-5, pl. 32 a-b and pl. 34 b. 12 Landwehr, Griechische Meisterwerke in römischen Abgüssen, pp. 16-17, fig. 13; Landwehr, Gipsabgüsse Baiae, pp. 16-17. 13 Landwehr, Griechische Meisterwerke in römischen Abgüssen, p. 18, figs 14-15; Landwehr, Gipsabgüsse Baiae, pp. 20-3.\n\n38\n\nChrista Landwehr\n\nFig. 2. 3: Aphrodite Borghese.

The Aphrodite was without a doubt a hit because it could be combined with portrait heads of noble ladies.20 More intriguing is the question of who, among the wealthy owners of the\n\n___________ 14 Naples, Museo Nazionale.

Outside Rome and Campania full-scale copies have only been found in a few places. One of those places is the ancient city of Caesarea Mauretaniae, the present-day Cherchel in Algeria. The city was founded in 25 BC by Juba II, the newly proclaimed King.21 The Numidian prince, who had been raised and educated at the imperial court in Rome, was installed by Augustus as King of Mauretania. Augustus had also arranged the wedding of Juba II and Cleopatra Selene.22 The numerous sculptural works of exquisite quality document the keen interest of the royal couple in art, and show that they had the means to bring first-rate sculptors to Caesarea. They adorned the town and their palace with fine statuary comparable in quality to the best masterpieces of Rome and Campania. Among these works are the twin female figures referred to as ‘Demeter’.23 The workmanship of the figures is so precise that it is hard to tell the statues apart (Fig. 2. 4). The lesson to be learned here is simple: if in Juba’s time duplication had been considered inferior, he would never have commissioned this pair of statues, let alone displayed them together in his palace. The ability to create exact replicas must, on the contrary, have been considered to be a consummate artistic skill. The juxtaposition of the Baiae casts and their cognate Roman copies makes us very aware of another aspect that is equally important. In spite of the mechanical replication of the dimensions of the original, each copy is unique due to the individual treatment of details. A glance at the Roman copies of Aristogeiton is enough to convince anyone of this.24\n\n___________\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\nbers of the imperial family.
