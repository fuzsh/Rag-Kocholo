The film's sets were designed by the art director Piero Filippone. It earned 400 million lira at the domestic box office.[2]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen his wife gives birth to twin boys, her husband sends one to the orphanage as they already have eleven children and thirteen would be unlucky. The two boys grow up completely apart, one becoming a professional footballer for Juventus and the other an employee of the state lottery. Without meeting, the two now keep accidentally crossing paths. The second man is mistaken for the first man by his girlfriend, and ends up playing in a football match in place of his twin.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nWalter Chiari as Carletto Esposito\\Brandoletti\n\nSilvana Pampanini as Clara\n\nIsa Barzizza as Teresa\n\nCarlo Campanini as Beppe\n\nAroldo Tieri as Il dottor Giechi\n\nMarilyn Buferd as L'assistente del dott.
