        "text": "The twenty-first century has witnessed the exacerbation of ecological issues that began to manifest themselves in the mid-twentieth century. It is increasingly clear that the current environmental crisis poses an unprecedented existential threat to civilization as well as to Homo sapiens itself. Whereas the physical and social sciences have been defining the now inevitable transition to a very different (and more inhospitable) Earth, the humanities have yet to assert their role as a transformative force in the current environmental criticalities. My thesis shows how Italian literature draws from the treasure-trove of the emotive to exert powerful psychological effects on the reader, therefore representing an invaluable tool to introduce the Italian public to the discomforting truths of a rapidly degrading global ecosystem while avoiding the polarising effect which haunts impersonal science communication.\n\nThis volume explores Italian science fiction from the nineteenth century to the twenty-first, covering literary texts, films, music, and visual works by figures as diverse as Maria Rosa Cutrufelli, Peter Kolosimo, Primo Levi, Antonio Margheriti, Gilda Musa, and Roberto Vacca. It broadens the horizons of both Italian studies and the environmental humanities by addressing a long-neglected genre, and expands understanding of relations between the ecological, the imaginary, and the sociopolitical. The chapters draw on a variety of methodological frameworks, including animal studies, ecocriticism, ecofeminism, eco-media studies, energy humanities, and posthumanism. There is a wealth of insights regarding topics such as anthropocentrism/speciesism, ecomodernist thought, environmental justice struggles at the planetary and regional level, non-human and new materialist ontologies, utopian/dystopian philosophies, and prospects for transitioning beyond the crisis of petromodernity through the construction of post-depletion futures.\n\nIt is difficult to define what belongs exclusively to Environmental History (EH), and even more what belongs to Italian Environmental History (IEH). This discipline often includes research concerned with different chronological periods, issues, approaches, and methods. This plurality of perspectives reflects the varied and often contrasting labels attached to those studies. This plurality of paths and experiences should not be considered a problem, but an opportunity to overcome the limitations of the current hyperspecialized structuring of research. For this reason, we have chosen to refer to the multidisciplinary area of the environmental humanities as the common ground. On the other hand, we have chosen a new way to present IEH to an international public: the interview and, especially in the last part, the multidisciplinary and hybrid dialogue\n\nBarron, Patrick and Anna Re, eds. Italian Environmental Literature: An Anthology. New York: Italica Press, 2003. --------------------- Italian Environmental Literature An Anthology Edited by Patrick Barron and Anna Re Foreword by John Elder Preface by Rebecca West ITALY has always presented itself in the modern Anglophone mind as the quintessential urban society: art, style and high culture; ancient, medieval and Renaissance cities; modern urban blight, crime and immigration. Yet Italy has perhaps the longest and most continuous tradition of environmental thinking and writing, stretching from the bucolic ideal of the ancient Romans, through the religious stewardship of creation enshrined by Benedict of Nursia in the sixth century in the monastic movement, to the nature mysticism of the high Middle Ages symbolized by Francis of Assisi. IN THE MODERN ERA Italy took its place very early on alongside the American conservation movement, and by the later 20th century it boasted a fully aware — and politically active — environmental movement. THIS VOLUME brings together, for the first time — in Italy or for an English-speaking audience — a collection of over 40 authors from this deep and broad tradition of Italian environmental writing. Poetry and prose, the essay, the political and economic tract, and the new arts are all represented in this collection. THE AUTHORS include: Corrado Alvaro Daria Menicanti Mariella Bettarini Eugenio Montale Virginio Bettini Giuseppe Moretti Giuseppe Bonaviri Giorgio Nebbia Italo Calvino Luciana Notari Dino Campana Anna Maria Ortese Carlo Cassola Giovanni Pascoli Antonio Cederna Pier Paolo Pasolini Gianni Celati Fulco Pratesi Gabriele D’Annunzio Salvatore Quasimodo Laura Conti Nuto Revelli Giuseppe Dessì Monica Sarsini Danilo Dolci Massimo Scalia Corrado Govoni Carlo Sgorlon Tonino Guerra Ignazio Silone Jolanda Insana Mario Rigoni Stern Carlo Levi Studio Azzurro Nicola Licciardello Alfredo Todisco Loredana Lucarini Giuseppe Ungaretti Gianna Manzini Andrea Zanzotto.
