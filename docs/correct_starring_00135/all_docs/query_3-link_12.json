        "text": "Lisa Spoonauer, who played Caitlin Bree in the 1994 film “Clerks,” has died, the film’s director Kevin Smith said Tuesday. She was 44.\n\n“Devastated to report that #LisaSpoonauer, who played Caitlin in #clerks, has passed away,” Smith wrote. “In 1992, I went looking for Lisa without knowing either who she was or the integral role she’d play in my life.”\n\nSmith went on to recall how, after a night of open auditions, he failed to find the “perfect Caitlin Bree,” so he dropped in at an acting class at Brookdale Community College to scout for talent.\n\nAlso Read: Roger Moore, Star of 7 James Bond Movies, Dies at 89\n\n“Lisa was easily the most natural and authentic voice in the room. She didn’t sound like she was acting at all; she delivered scripted dialogue as if she was inventing her conversation in the moment, like people do in real life,” Smith recalled. “Captivated, I approached Lisa cold in the parking lot after the class and said ‘This is gonna sound creepy but… Do you wanna be in a movie?’ Fearlessly, she replied ‘Not if it’s porn.'”\n\nSmith went on to say that Spooauer “quickly became one of the mot important people I’d ever meet.”\n\nSpoonauer later married her “Clerks” co-star Jeff Anderson. They were married for a year, from 1998 to 1999.\n\nAlso Read: Dina Merrill, Heiress Turned Actress Who Grew Up in Trump's Future Mar-a-Lago Estate, Dies at 93\n\nIn addition to her role in “Clerks,” Spoonauer appeared in the Gabe Torres film “Bartender,” and reprised her Caitlin character for a voice role in an episode of the animated TV series “Clerks.”\n\nSmith concluded his tribute, “Thank you for dreaming my dream with me. You changed my life, Lisa.”\n\nRelated stories from TheWrap:\n\nRoger Moore, Star of 7 James Bond Movies, Dies at 89\n\nDina Merrill, Heiress Turned Actress Who Grew Up in Trump's Future Mar-a-Lago Estate, Dies at 93"
