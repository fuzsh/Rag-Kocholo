        "text": "With the month of January quickly coming to a close, it is that time again to realize what wonderful movies are leaving Netflix, and binge them as quickly as possible before they are removed for good.\n\nNever fear though, even if you do not catch the titles you were hoping for, just like a fiery phoenix, as Netflix kills some movies off its rosters, more and more rise into its rank.\n\nSo, let us begin on what should be seen before the end of the week, and what will be waiting like a brand new present when the weekend arrives.\n\nLEAVING IN FEBRUARY:\n\nClerks– Written and directed by Kevin Smith. Starring Brian O’Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Marilyn Ghigliotti, Lisa Spoonauer and Jason Mewes.\n\nThe movie that launched hundreds of indy flicks and made Kevin Smith a well known name in Hollywood is about to have its final hour on Netflix, so catch it now before it goes.\n\nMade for a measly budget of $27,575 (in a time where you had to actually buy film to shoot it on remember) the film is a sweet love song to people in their 20’s with little to no direction in life.\n\nFor anyone who does watch the flick and needs some more Kevin Smith, Netflix also houses a few other movies written and directed by the New Jersey native. Be sure to check out Chasing Amy, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, TUSK, and Yoga Hosers.\n\nShaun of the Dead– Directed by Edgar Wright. Written by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright. Starring Simon Pegg, Kate Ashfield, Nick Frost, Lucy Davis and Dylan Moran.\n\nZombies are in vogue right now in popular media. The Walking Dead is still AMC’s biggest hit with no signs of slowing. That is a truly serious show though, with drama and suspense around every corner. Can’t zombies be funny?\n\nThat is exactly the message that the Shaun of the Dead crew must have been thinking in pre production, as this movie takes classic horror elements and flips it on its head in this truly funny movie.\n\nThe movie is brought to you by the same comedic team behind The World’s End and Hot Fuzz, which bring their own twist on comedy into the mainstream with hilarious results.\n\nWhether or not you are a fan of the current zombie phenomenon, you are sure to get a kick out of this fun, funny, movie.\n\nSing– Directed by Garth Jennings, co-directed by Christophe Lourdelet. Written by Garth Jennings. Featuring the voice talents of Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Seth MacFarlane, Scarlett Johansson, John C. Reilly and Taron Egerton.\n\nWhat could be the best animated movie of all time, taking the greatest pop music from every decade, celebrity voices, anthropomorphic animals and mixing them all up into this heartfelt movie that makes you just want to sing.\n\nThe power behind this movie does not come from the aforementioned assets that this movie boasts, but from the underlying message throughout: you are worth the shot. Believe in yourself, take that chance, do not doubt yourself, because you are more powerful than you can ever imagine.\n\nThose are just the movies you need to be sure to check out before the end of the week, but let us also take a look at what to watch next as they arrive in February.\n\nCOMING IN FEBRUARY:\n\nThe Edge of Seventeen– Written and directed by Kelly Fremon Craig. Starring Hailee Steinfeld, Woody Harrelson, Haley Lu Richardson, Blake Jenner and Kyra Sedgwick.\n\nDuring the tenure of “Nick’s Flick Picks” it has been lost to actually how many movies have been recommended to readers. If at any time the reader should really heed the advice of the column, it should be now.\n\nThis quaint, adorable, and perfectly spot-on representation of the angst of young adulthood encapsulates every feeling of that time in life as a young girl attempts to make her way through high school.\n\nThe smart writing lends itself to the amazing actors and gives the movie the sense that these are real people who have been documented, rather than actors making a movie.\n\nThis is most seen between the movies two leads, Steinfeld and Harrelson, who have the student/teacher relationship down and makes you want to call that one teacher in high school who stands out in your mind as being “cool.”\n\nJaws– Directed by Steven Spielberg. Screenplay by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb, based on the novel by Peter Benchley. Starring Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Lorainne Gary and Murray Hamilton.\n\nA true classic. As citizens of the world, you owe it to yourself to see the movie that has caused dozens of people to never even look at the ocean, let alone go in it.\n\nOn top of all that, it is the film that launched Steven Spielberg’s career, which then in turn launched now famous composer John Williams career with what could be the best theme song of all time.\n\nEven if you have not seen the movie, it is almost guaranteed that as you read the last sentence about the theme song you went, “buuuuuhhhhh don.”\n\nNot only is the classic going to be available at the beginning of the month, but three of its sequels will also be up for your streaming pleasure.\n\nThe 40- Year Old Virgin– Directed by Judd Apatow. Written by Judd Apatow & Steve Carrell. Starring Steve Carrell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann and Jane Lynch.\n\nIf you are a fan of Carell in the popular NBC sitcom The Office, then you owe a large thank you to this movie. NBC was not too sure whether or not to give the show a second season due to some unimpressive ratings, but with his killer performance in this film that led to box office gold, NBC gave The Office the greenlight for season two, and the rest they say is history.\n\nIn hindsight, it was an obvious move for NBC because Carell really gets to shine in his role as the hapless virgin Andy. His supporting cast of now favorite comedy legends bring their best and every minute is just as funny as the last.\n\nLet’s be clear however, the humor is crude, so if that is not your bag, your would be best to steer clear of this title.\n\nA strong argument can be made that it was this movie that led to the wildly successful genre in Hollywood, “The Bromance”, including other titles like Step Brothers, I Love You Man, and Superbad.\n\nWho knows how long these titles will be available on Netflix; they do change them out every month, so be sure to catch all these picks while you can."
