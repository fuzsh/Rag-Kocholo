        "text": "Lisa Spoonauer, an actress known for playing Caitlin Bree in the cult favorite movie Clerks, died over the weekend in her home in Jackson Township, New Jersey. Her cause of death has been stated as an unknown degenerative disease, and the actress was only 44 at her time of death. She leaves behind her husband, Tom Caron, a daughter, Mia Spoonauer, and her stepson Tyler Caron.\n\nKevin Smith first revealed the news via Instagram, sharing the thoughtful and amusing story of how Lisa Spoonauer initially signed on to Clerks in the first place.\n\nA few days later, Lisa Spoonauer showed up to play Caitlin Bree, Dante Hicks' ex-girlfriend who he decides to take on date in the movie, even though he is currently in a relationship with Veronica. The role is notable not only for Spoonauer's realistic delivery, but also because--spoilers if you somehow haven't seen this classic--Caitlin inadvertently has sex with an aroused dead man (who had a heart attack while masturbating) in the unlit bathroom at the back of the store, believing it was Dante. If you are going to be remember for a role onscreen, it might as well be one as memorable as Spoonauer's gig in Clerks.\n\nLisa Spoonauer didn't act on the big screen after her debut role, but she did reprise her role in the Clerks TV series. She later went on to be an event planner and a caterer, according to her obituary. Per Kevin Smith's tribute, Lisa Spoonauer may have been an actress first, but she was an even more excellent mother to her daughter Mia. She clearly shaped the lives of those around her, and she won't be forgotten by Smith, who says she \"changed\" his life. Forty-four is too young to go, and our thoughts go out to Lisa Spoonauer's family and friends in their time of need."
