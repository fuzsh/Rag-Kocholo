        "text": "Lisa Spoonauer, who played Caitlin Bree in Kevin Smith’s Clerks, has passed away. She was only 44. Her cause of death is unknown.\n\nSpoonauer worked as an actress only briefly — appearing in Clerks and one other film, Bachelor — and was also briefly married to her Clerks co-star, Jeff Anderson. As Caitlin Bree in Clerks, she famously had sex with a corpse in a dark bathroom.\n\nBrian O’Halloran, who played Dante in Clerks, expressed his grief on Instagram, saying he was “gutted by the news.”\n\nKevin Smith also offered a tribute to the late actress, saying that — during the audition process — “she didn’t sound like she was acting at all; she delivered scripted dialogue as if she was inventing her conversation in the moment, like people do in real life. “"
