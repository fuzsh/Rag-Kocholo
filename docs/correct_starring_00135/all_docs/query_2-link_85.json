        "text": "Disclaimer: This isn’t really SF or fantasy in any sense of the word.\n\nI’m just a big fan of Kevin Smith, who’s arguably just a grown-up fanboy\n\nhimself. (You’ve seen his movies, and probably read some of his comic\n\nbooks.) If blatant fanboy-ism isn’t your thing, go read something else.\n\nThank you, drive through.\n\nIf you’re still reading, soak up the review\n\nof the “Clerks Uncensored” video/DVD just released today.\n\nWhat The Heck?\n\nIn mid-1999, ABC started to air\n\n“Clerks,” an animated series based on Kevin Smith’s notorious movie of the\n\nsame title. Dante, Randall, Jay and Silent Bob, all the usual suspects are\n\nthere (though it should be noted that Silent Bob isn’t quite as silent as\n\nusual).\n\nSome compared “Clerks” to “The Simpsons,” an arguably apt comparison\n\nfor the plethora of pop-culture references and multi-layered, occasionally\n\nsubtle humor. Some simply called it childish and more than a bit profane\n\n(also an accurate assessment). The ratings were abysmal, and ABC canceled\n\nthe series after just two episodes.\n\nAnyway, all six episodes are on this video and DVD. As I’m\n\nmoonlighting as a clerk myself, in a shocking abuse of power and\n\nauthority, I sold myself the tape two days before its “street” date.\n\nYes, this is highly illegal, but Kevin Smith just doesn’t strike me as\n\nthe type to care all that much.\n\nCast/Crew\n\nKevin Smith got all the key actors from “Clerks” to lend their voices\n\nto the series: Brian O’Halloran (Dante), Jeff Anderson (Randal), Jay and\n\nSilent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), and even Lisa Spoonauer (Dante’s\n\ninfamous ex, Caitlin Bree) in a few small bits. And basketball star\n\nCharles Barkley.\n\nSynopses\n\nThis is a toughie, as the “Clerks Uncensored” packages has six\n\nepisodes, only two of which aired on ABC before the network canned the\n\nseries.\n\nThe episodes are provided in production order, starting with the “lost\n\npilot,” which is listed on the\n\nofficial series site as episode 5 (full title: “Leonardo Leonardo\n\nReturns and Dante Has An Important Decision to Make”). The rest of the\n\nepisode titles are even longer, so I’ll just make ’em up as I go. In\n\norder:\n\nSupervillain Leonardo Leonardo threatens the Quick Stop by opening a\n\n“Quicker Stop.”\n\nThe flashback episode, filled with clips of all the previous episodes.\n\nThe “Outbreak” parody, in which, for reasons far too bizarre to\n\nexplain, Gilbert Gottfried portrays the voice of Patrick Swayze.\n\nJay sues Dante for ten million dollars after slipping in the Quick\n\nStop. (This was the first episode to air, and judging from the ratings,\n\nthe only one most people saw. I’ll wager the “surprise ending” turned off\n\nmore than a few mainstream viewers.)\n\nThe high school reunion, Dante coaches Little League, and bizarre\n\nparodies of “The Last Starfighter” and a half-dozen other movies.\n\nThe “old school” episode. The Quick Stop stays open all night, because a fair’s in town.\n\nHighs And Lows\n\nHigh point: the introduction to the second episode. The segues are\n\nlive-action, with Jay and Silent Bob at the palatial estate they bought\n\nwith their wicked mad “Clerks” paychecks (or something). Jay points out\n\nthat the episode was pretty cool, but they couldn’t curse because it was\n\nTV. So, Jay gets in enough cursing for all six episodes in one 45-second\n\nsnippet. If you’re a fan of that kind of humor, it definitely works.\n\nLow point: some of the gags get recycled a bit more than they should.\n\nThe “climbing up the building” visual gag gets hideously overdone,\n\nsadly.\n\nOriginality:\n\nThere are more than a few jokes that hearken back\n\nto the movie. If you don’t know the movie, some things are gonna seem a\n\nbit weird. They try to explain everything away, but in the process there\n\nseems to be a bit of strained exposition (though it’s usually still\n\nfunny). Beyond that, though, the gags are more hits than misses. 5 out of\n\n7.\n\nEffects:\n\nThe animation is obviously cheesy, the characters are\n\nkinda blocky, but it still works in a low-budget sorta way. 6 out of\n\n7.\n\nStory:\n\nBlatant fanboy-ism here, but I enjoyed every episode,\n\nevery parody from “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” to the unaired\n\n“Flintstone’s List” bit. 7 out of 7.\n\nActing:\n\nMostly voice acting for the show itself. Nothing\n\nspectacular, but solid all around. I’m adding an extra point for the live\n\nsegments, because they’re just so darn cool. 5 out of 7.\n\nProduction:\n\nThe animation is cheesy, again, but it works. The\n\nsounds, visuals, are all acceptable from an objective standpoint. 5\n\nout of 7.\n\nOverall:\n\nIf you’re a fan of Kevin Smith, this wins with an\n\neasy 7 out of 7. If not, give it a shot, maybe you’ll be impressed, though\n\nfor a more mainstream audience the total is more likely 3/7 or so.\n\nTotal: 35 out of 42"
