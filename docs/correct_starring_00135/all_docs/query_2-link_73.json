        "text": "It was Airport Friend that brought up an interest in the Kevin Smith movie Clerks (1994). The comedy was independently filmed in black-and-white on a small budget, launching Smith‘s career. We’ll be looking at another film by Smith later this week, though start today with the movie Clerks as written and directed by Kevin Smith.\n\n(From left, Brian O’Halloran as Dante Hicks and Jeff Anderson as Randal Graves in the Kevin Smith movie Clerks).\n\nWe are introduced to Dante Hicks, as portrayed by Brian O’Halloran, who is called into work after working at and closing a convenience store the previous day. The start of the day, followed by the immense difficulty of getting the store opened for customers, signals clearly to an observant audience that the tone of everything that will follow is imbued with adult humor. The target audience would be twenty-somethings and thirty-somethings, in my estimation.\n\n(From left, Lisa Spoonauer as Caitlin Bree and Marilyn Ghigliotti as Veronica Loughran in the Kevin Smith movie Clerks).\n\nGetting the convenience store open, attempts to sell cigarettes to customers visiting Hicks are thwarted when a Chewlies gum representative portrayed by Scott Schiaffo takes up an assertive campaign to make the process difficult. The assertive approach taken raises questions that are direct, clear, and awkwardly inappropriate. Hence, the humor. Veronica Loughran as portrayed by Marilyn Ghigliotti brings some relief, and a fresh brand of humor of her own.\n\n(From left, Brian O’Halloran as Dante Hicks and Scott Schiaffo as Chewlies gum representative in the Kevin Smith movie Clerks).\n\nRandal Graves, as portrayed by Jeff Anderson, in concert with Veronica Loughran and Dante Hicks themselves bring about questions in the relationship that we see demonstrated between Hicks and Loughran. Dante and Veronica have clearly different goals, as well as sensibilities about what their futures as individuals and a couple should be. It is in this sense, and in Hicks’ own confusion over his feelings for Caitlin Bree as portrayed by Lisa Spoonauer, that even further shenanigans ensue.\n\n(From left, Jason Mewes as Jay and writer, director and actor Kevin Smith as Silent Bob in the Kevin Smith movie Clerks).\n\nWith some clear demonstration that neither video store clerk Randal nor convenience store Dante enjoy their work, and with clear indications of promiscuity and unresolved emotional baggage that form a clear vision for Clerks, director Kevin Smith introduces Jason Mewes as Jay and himself as Silent Bob as something of a bawdy audience advocate and storyline glue for the movie. A hockey game, a funeral, and bizarre and uncomfortable behavior in an unlit backroom all factor in to the large revelation and conflict between Dante and Randal that clarifies much for the story.\n\n(Writer, director and actor Kevin Smith, actress Marilyn Ghigliotti, actor Brian O’Halloran, actress Lisa Spoonauer and actor Jeff Anderson in the Kevin Smith movie Clerks).\n\nThe film Clerks as presented by Kevin Smith succeeded far beyond what something made for such a small budget should have. The success was still modest, yet Clerks has achieved a cult appreciation still further beyond that of the original run in the movies. In delivering something unique and of value for the audience this movie was intended before, our take is that Clerks has earned 3.75-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, June 9, 2021"
