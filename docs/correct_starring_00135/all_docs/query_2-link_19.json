        "text": "Actress Lisa Spoonauer of \"Clerks\" died from an accidental overdose of painkillers, according to a report in TMZ, citing documents from the Ocean County Medical Examiner's Office.\n\nThe actress, who played the role of Dante's ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree in the iconic 1994 Kevin Smith comedy, was also suffering from cancer, anemia, lung disease, and immune deficiency, all of which contributed to her death.\n\nSpoonauer, who was born in Rahway but lived in Jackson at the time of her death in May at age 44, died of \"acute and chronic intravenous use of hydromorphone,\" according to TMZ.\n\nAfter her death, her twin brothers, Spoonauer's twin brothers, Michael and Mark Spoonauer, referenced their sister's ongoing battle with \"chronic illness\" in a post on JustGiving.com-- but at the time offered no additional detail.\n\nSpoonauer was a complete unknown when Smith cast her in \"Clerks,\" a low-budget, black-and-white comedy set in a New Jersey convenience store that ended up becoming one of the defining titles of the American indie movie wave of the 1990s.\n\nSpoonauer would go on to marry her \"Clerks\" co-star Jeff Anderson in 1998, though the marriage ended in divorce the next year. Spoonauer later married Tom Caron, with whom she had a daughter, Mia, and stepson, Tyler.\n\nDespite her auspicious debut, Spoonauer appeared in just one other film, 1997's \"Bartender.\" Instead she pursued a career as a restaurant manager and event planner.\n\nIn a widely shared Instagram post shortly after her death, Smith eulogized the actress, and said, \"But as strong an actress as she was, Lisa was an even more excellent Mother to her daughter Mia. Whenever we'd Facebook later in life, she'd gush about her baby girl proudly.\"\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of the article misidentified the setting for the film \"Clerks.\""
