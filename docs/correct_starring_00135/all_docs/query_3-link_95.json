        "text": "Clerks, released in 1994, offers insight into the day in the life of convenience store clerk Dante Hicks. Dante (played by Brian O'Halloran) is called into work - despite initially having the day off - but is able to enjoy the company of the video clerk next door, Randall Graves (Jeff Anderson).\n\nDante gets visits from his girlfriend, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), his ex Caitlin (Lisa Spoonauer), and numerous strange customers. He also has to deal with the loitering pair known as Jay and Silent Bob (played by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, respectively).\n\nIf you're interested in more on Ranker about Smith's breakout hit Clerks, here you go:\n\nBehind-The-Scene Stories From The Making Of ‘Clerks’\n\nThe Best ‘Clerks’ Movie Quotes\n\nSmall But Interesting Details Fans Noticed In ‘Clerks’\n\nBy the time Clerks II arrives, Dante and Randall are working at Mooby's - a fast-food joint where raunchy hijinks ensue. Dante is supposed to move to Florida with his girlfriend (played by Smith's wife, Jennifer Schwalbach), but finally admits to himself that he is in love with his co-worker, Becky (Rosario Dawson).\n\nAfter Clerks II, Anderson said he wouldn't make another movie in the franchise, but Smith's near-death experience may have changed his mind. The plot of Clerks III focuses on Randall's post-heart attack plans in another semi-autobiographical movie penned and directed by Smith.\n\nJust like the first Clerks movies, the third flick explores experiences in Smith's own life. Smith explained:\n\nClerks was based solely on reality. I woke up, I went to that store. Crazy people came in, kids hung out outside, and sold drugs, I had a friend who worked next door. All of it was very autobiographical. Clerks II was completely fabricated, right down to the fact that I never even worked in fast food.\n\nClerks III is a return to autobiographical form:\n\nThe film is predicated on the idea that Randall survives a heart attack, a massive heart attack, quite like I did, and then winds up, you know, deciding that he’s wasted his life… But before he dies he wants to memorialize himself. He wants to make a movie. So our boys essentially wind up making Clerks.\n\nAs a follow-up to his successful independent movie Clerks, Kevin Smith continued to make innovative, funny, and relatively low-budget flicks. Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997), and Dogma (1999) were the first of what would become the View Askewniverse - the name for Smith's film opus.\n\nWant to know more about Smith's films? And the company they keep in the indie movie world?\n\nThe Best Kevin Smith Movies\n\nRanker's List Of All Indie Movies\n\nOne standout feature of Smith's movies is his continued use of the same characters - and the same actors. Jason Mewes as Jay is a consistent presence throughout the View Askewniverse, while Ben Affleck shows up in Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and Jersey Girl.\n\nActors like Matt Damon make repeated appearances, as do Jason Lee, Joey Lauren Adams, Ethan Suplee, and Justin Long. Smith hasn't forgotten his friends, either. Walter Flanagan and Bryan Johnson (both of Comic Book Men fame) are Smith's childhood friends and have been cast over and over again. So has Smith's wife, Jennifer Schwalbach, and more recently, his daughter, Harley Quinn Smith.\n\nSmith's not alone in this close-knit phenomenon. Lots of directors work with the same actors over and over again, while keeping it in the family is par for the course, too:\n\nThe Greatest Actor/Director Teams Ever\n\nParents And Their Kids Who Appeared In The Same Movie (As Unrelated Characters)\n\n12 Projects That Were Just Excuses For Actors To Work With Their Kids\n\n11 Actors Who Followed Directly In Their Famous Parents' Footsteps\n\nClerks III reunites some of Kevin Smith's tried-and-true actors. Justin Long (who appeared in Zach and Miri Make a Porno, Tusk, Yogahosers, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) is in the movie alongside Jeff Anderson, Brian O'Halloran, Jason Mewes, and Smith himself. Both Rosario Dawson and Trevor Fehrman (Becky and Elias, respectively) return from Clerks II. But Clerks III also features some new faces with performers like Sarah Michelle Gellar joining the cast.\n\nOne notable actor in the movie is Ben Affleck. Smith and Affleck have a long history that even includes the former's production credit on Affleck's award-winning movie Good Will Hunting. They've had a complicated relationship, however, which Smith indicated was influenced by Jennifer Garner's presence in Affleck's life. Smith and Affleck didn't talk for years, although Smith talked openly about Affleck during podcasts and live stand-up shows\n\nAfter Smith's heart attack in 2018, he noted Affleck didn't contact him, but around that same time, Smith shifted gears on their friendship. By 2019 they had made amends, and Affleck joined the cast of Jay and Silent Bob Reboot as well as Clerks III.\n\nSmith is no stranger to riffs with actors. His feud with Bruce Willis received a lot of attention for a time, but it has also come to an end. Not all directors and actors are able to put difficult times behind them:\n\nThe 31 Biggest Actor Vs. Director Fights In Hollywood\n\nActors And Directors Who Truly Loathed Each Other By The End Of The Movie\n\nBehind-The-Scenes Feuds That Changed The Direction Of Movies\n\nIn case the world needs more proof that Smith and Affleck are friends again, Smith attended the star-studded 2022 wedding between Jersey Girl stars Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. Smith later said:\n\nI was crying like an old woman at a wedding… like my mother at a wedding… Honestly, like, one of the most romantic moments I’ve engaged with in my life, and it wasn’t even my romantic moment.\n\nAs View Askewniverse staples, Jay and Silent Bob basically have to be in Clerks III, right?\n\nThey are.\n\nWith two movies of their own, Jay and Silent Bob do show up in Clerks III. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is about the Bluntman and Chronic movie that features the duo's likenesses, while Jay and Silent Bob Reboot echoes the same plot. Jay and Silent Bob represent much more than what is seen on screen. Making Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back required Kevin Smith and others to monitor Jason Mewes in an effort to keep him off of drugs.\n\nMewes recalled:\n\nRight before [Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back] I went and stayed with [Smith] in his guesthouse and I literally couldn't leave his house or guesthouse unless I was with him.\n\nAt one point, Smith was so frustrated with Mewes using that he told him: \"You can do all the f*cking dope you want now, because we're stopping the movie.'\n\nThe movie did get made and Mewes later credited Smith, Jay, and Silent Bob with saving his life.\n\nFor Smith's part, his heart attack led the director, writer, and actor to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Smith also began exercising, then became a vegan. Overall, Smith has lost over 50 pounds since his heart attack - which will make him a very svelt Silent Bob. Never fear! Smith will wear his characteristic black trench coat - one he wore in high school [and the original Clerks] as an homage to comedian Sam Kinison.\n\nThe story of Jay and Silent Bob's superhero counterparts isn't finished, either. After announcing he was teaming with Dark Horse Comics tov form Secret Stash Press, Smith has promised fans numerous View Askneiverse comic books are coming down the pike. In the first book of the upcoming Quick Stops series, Smith will reveal the origins of Bluntman and Chronic.\n\nKevin Smith's movies don't all fall into one genre. When he made Red State in 2011, it was a decided shift for the writer and director. Not at all comical, Red State is a horror thriller about extremist fundamentalism in the United States. When Smith debuted Red State at the Sundance Film Festival, he announced he was going to distribute the movie on his own - instead of selling the flick to a larger distributor.\n\nAt the time, Smith said:\n\nWe believe the state of film marketing has become ridiculously expensive and exclusionary to the average filmmaker longing simply to tell their story.\n\nTo tell his story, Smith took Red State on the road and showed it to audiences around the US. Part of the process included podcasts after the movie, a medium Smith became more and more enamored with in the years that followed. In 2012, Smith announced he was leaving filmmaking and explained:\n\nThe ultimate freedom that allowed me to walk away from the “heroin” [money] of the movie business - what gave me the strength to walk away - was f*cking podcasting.\n\nUnlike other actors and directors who walked away from fame, like those on Ranker's 30 Celebrities Who Quit Being Famous list, Smith did return to making movies. But he found ways to incorporate podcasting into his craft. Tusk, for example, was inspired by a conversation he had with Clerks co-producer Scott Mosier on their podcast collaboration, SModcast.\n\nClerks III again unites podcasting with one of Smith's movies as he tours it around the country to show it to audiences and talk about the film afterward.\n\nIn many ways, Smith was ahead of the curve. His motto was that of hockey player Wayne Gretzky: “Don’t go where the puck’s been - go where it’s going to be.” Podcasting seemed to be where that puck was headed. Here are a few highlights from Ranker's library of Podcast Lists And Rankings:\n\nThe Best Celebrity Podcasts, Ranked\n\nThe Most Popular Comedy Podcasts Right Now, Ranked\n\nThe 50+ Best Movie Podcasts, Ranked\n\nAs a proud native of New Jersey, Kevin Smith still has strong ties to the state. A lot of Clerks was filmed in New Jersey, but Clerks II wasn't - something Smith said may have influenced its success:\n\nI love Clerks II; it’s one of my favorite films I’ve ever made. But we spend all of the movie away from Quick Stop - and Quick Stop is the nucleus, man. It’s the rock from which all the waters flow; it’s where all the ley lines cross. We shot Clerks II mostly in Buena Park, California, so there was that aspect. Is it really a Clerks movie if you’re not in New Jersey.\n\nSmith filmed much of Clerks III in New Jersey, where he also owns a comic book store and, more recently, a movie theater. In August 2022, Smith announced he purchased The Atlantic Moviehouse in Atlantic Highlands - the movie theater that brought him so much joy as a kid:\n\nThis certainly isn’t about an investment deal… This is about owning a little piece of my personal movie history, a building that helped forge the filmmaker that I would become.\n\nAfter renaming the theater SModcastle Cinemas, Smith said he would use it for podcasting as well as for a film school camp. There's a poetic symmetry for Smith:\n\nWhen I went to film school it was a movie theater, and what is a classroom except a bunch of chairs [with] a big white board in front, that's a movie theater right there. So I was always like, if I owned a movie theater I'd rent it out to some film school in the first half of the day and then [at] 5 o'clock at night it would become a movie theater. Well, now I'm about to own a movie theater and I've got like 30 years experience making Kevin Smith movies."
