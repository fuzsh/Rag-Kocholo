        "text": "JACKSON - A former actress who starred in the Jersey landmark independent film \"Clerks\" died at home Saturday at the age of 44.\n\nLisa Ann Spoonauer passed away May 21 at her Jackson home, according to her obituary. The manner of her death was not reported. A Rahway native, Spoonauer grew up in Freehold and moved to Jackson six years ago.\n\nSpoonauer played Caitlin Bree in director Kevin Smith's breakout 1994 film, shot in the Leonardo section of Middletown. She reprised her role in a single 2001 episode of an animated series by the same name. \"Chasing Amy,\" another of Smith's other films, set in the same slightly altered universe, makes references to her character.\n\nSmith posted a tribute to Spoonauer on social media, remembering how he first saw her in an acting class at Brookdale Community College and invited her to join the cast of Clerks in the parking lot after class. When he asked her if she wanted to be in a movie, she said, \"Not if it's porn,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I told her a bit about Clerks and gave her a copy of the script and my phone number,\" Smith said. \"She called me a few days later and said 'Well it's not porn, but everybody talks like it is. It's funny. I'll do it.'\"\n\nAfter her acting career Spoonauer became a restaurant manager and event planner, according to her obituary.\"Lisa was a devoted mother and loving wife, and she was known for her strength, selflessness and faith,\" according to her obituary. \"Lisa loved spending time with family and friends, helping anyone she could and laughing as much as she made other people laugh.\"\n\nSpoonauer is survived by her husband, Tom Caron, a daughter and stepson, her mother and twin brothers and a large extended family."
