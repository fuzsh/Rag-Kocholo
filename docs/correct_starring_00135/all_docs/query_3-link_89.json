        "text": "Saying goodbye is never easy to do, and 2017 has made us do it a lot. So many notable and highly regarded celebrities passed away this year, leaving family, friends and fans behind to mourn their loss even as we celebrate and thank them for the impact and beauty they made while they were here.\n\nSome of those celebrities include Rose Marie, David Cassidy, Chester Bennington, Tom Petty, Mary Tyler Moore, Chuck Berry and Jerry Lewis — but luckily, their legacies will continue to live on in the music, the movies, the TV shows and the classic magazines they gifted to the world. These stars may be gone, but they’ll never be forgotten.\n\nSo, before we officially close the chapter on 2017 and ring in a new year, scroll or click through our slideshow to see, remember and honor all the celebrities who have died this year.\n\nOriginally published January 2017. Updated November 2017."
