        "text": "Christopher Lambert has got to be one of the least likeliest success stories in the history of Hollywood. Despite never starring in a bona fide hit (the closest he came was probably Mortal Kombat), he has nevertheless built an incredibly impressive resume over some thirty odd years of acting, and was even married to Diane Lane, one of the most beautiful and talented women to ever live. Lambert also has the uncanny ability to bring his best to the cheapest, most thankless of roles. I’ve never seen him not try in any film he’s appeared in, which can’t be said of higher paid, more popular actors like Bruce Willis. I love Lambert, despite (or perhaps because of) his overall incredible oddness.\n\nBorn in the United States yet looking, speaking, and acting almost entirely European (his French father was a diplomat who worked for the UN), Lambert is almost totally unbelievable as an American everyman, which is almost every role he plays. This is no exception in 1995’s forgotten thriller The Hunted, wherein Lambert plays Paul Racine, a normal, everyday American computer chip salesman (is there a job more 1995 than computer chip salesman?) on a business trip in Japan. After another successful sale, Racine heads back to his apartment, skipping out on celebrating with his two business associates. He runs afoul of the mysterious and beautiful Kirina (Joan Chen), and spends the night with her. When Kirina is attacked and murdered by ninjas, Racine is the only witness as well as a marked man.\n\nWritten for the screen and directed by J.F. Lawton (who also wrote, among other works, Pretty Woman), The Hunted is poorly paced, badly choreographed, barely acted, and an incredibly painful in places. It is also a total guilty pleasure. Lawton’s writing, which can generously be referred to as stilted, is unintentionally campy and goofy, treating the subject matter as if it were an actual super serious drama film rather than a contemporary tale of an American businessman on the run from ninjas – a premise which is already silly and awesome enough. The premise for the film is actually super interesting (I’m a sucker for a story about someone on the run from a malevolent force I guess), and part of me likes The Hunted not for what it is, but for what it could be. In the hands of a more skilled action director, this could have become a well-remembered cult classic.\n\nThe film unfortunately suffers from an incredibly high amount of Orientalism. Asian women are often sex objects – Joan Chen’s character Kirina really serves no purpose except to be an object of desire by Racine for example. The best character in the movie, Ichirou Takeda (Yoshio Harada), is a modern day samurai and expert on the various ninja clans of Japan. The movie is shot as if Japan is on another planet completely, treating most, if not all, of its characters as if they’re aliens from outer space. While it is true that the film reveres and respects some of its characters (particularly Takeda and his partner and wife Mieko are treated with respect), by and large the film more often than not gawks at its characters as if to say, “Wow, look how crazy these Japanese people are!” While this may have been somewhat more acceptable in the 1980s (when there was indeed a fear in the U.S. that Japan could one day become the world’s preeminent financial superpower), it feels incredibly outdated in a film from 1995.\n\nAs noted earlier, the pacing in this movie is somewhat glacial. It takes practically 40 minutes to get to the meatier parts of the story, and the movie runs an interminable 111 minutes overall. There’s a fantastic action sequence on a bullet train that is probably the high point of the movie. But the follow up scenes, on a samurai training ground (once again, in modern Japan), slow the film down to a screeching halt. A brisker, 90 minute cut would have helped the film immensely (but also probably cut down on villain Kinjo’s (John Lone) motivations). Action choreography is also laughably cheap throughout, and the whole production looks like it spent about a dollar fifty on fake blood (Lambert’s character sports a bloodied bandage pretty much throughout the entire running time of the film). Again, in the hands of a more skilled director, this could have been a whole lot cooler.\n\nChristopher Lambert just doesn’t work as an everyman. He is just too odd, like a less perverted European version of James Spader or Nicolas Cage. In the long pantheon of unlikely leading men (which obviously includes Jeff Goldblum as its most famous member), Lambert is perhaps the least likely. Despite this (or again, perhaps because of it), Lambert is almost never disappointing in any role. He really gives it his all in The Hunted despite a crappy script, low budget, and almost complete and total lack of direction or spirit. This is an incredibly dumb, forgotten movie that wastes its goofily awesome premise by being far too serious for its own good.\n\n-Z-\n\nThese two very unique films carry a “behind the scenes” feel. It’s remarkable that the Gorehound, who has seen more movies than have actually been made, has never seen anything similar. Years ago I was hesitant to watch Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon (’06; BTM) because I thought it was an actual documentary (like Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer) which garners zero interest from the Gorehound. After watching BTM, I had the quickest change of heart. Similar to how I feel after watching a movie which quickly becomes my favorite, BTM took a unique place in my repertoire. I love this movie. It is unique, brilliant, and worthy of praise. Let us progress…\n\nBy the way, this is an old, old blog entry. I watch How To Be a Serial Killer (’13; HTBSK) when it first came out but never got around to writing it up. While in the early minutes of watching HTBSK, I sensed a BTM tone and was optimistic.\n\nSo the basic premise of both these movies follows a protagonist (typically the good guy, hero, or main character you root for) under the instruction or interview of a killer, at which point near the end, the roles change. Both are very similar, with the most distinguished difference being the genre: BTM is horror centric and HBTSK is suspenseful and mysterious.\n\nThe characters and actors are fabulous in each film. Each are strikingly unique, including a guy you’ll recognize immediately Hershel (Scott Wilson) from The Walking Dead starring as Eugene in BTM. I didn’t recognize anyone in HTBSK but it was the directorial debut by Luke Ricci. In BTM, Nathan Baesel is the killer. There are numerous references (such as 1428 Elm Street) and cameos including Kane Hodder (cult actor most famously known for portraying Jason Voorhees), Robert Englund (another cult actor and most famously Freddy Krueger), and many, many more. Lastly, Zelda Rubinstein has a short role, need I say more?\n\nBy the end of HTBSK, I really didn’t care what happened. Whether the protege took the role of killer or rebelled against his instructor, I really didn’t care. But a good movie should make you care. BTM held the viewer tight. Is this just another day for Leslie Vernon? How will it end? Will the documentarians survive?\n\nSo why was BTM so much better? For one, horror is the best and surpasses any genre. BTM also delves into common themes of horror movies (sexual empowerment, virgin power, urban legends) and states them bluntly. It merges documentary with horror. How does a killer, who is walking slowly, catch the sprinting teen girl? Why wear a mask? Who do you look up to? This movies answers these questions and becomes self-aware in the best way possible. By analyzing different themes of horror movies and then displaying them for the final act. The movie is brilliant.\n\nIt’s difficult to ascertain the why else BTM is better because I believe it comes down to general filmmaking. While both appeared to have similar budgets, the difference was the angles, lighting, and sound which seemed to be constantly off in HTBSK. In the end, the collective qualities of BTM beat out HTBSK.\n\nIn conclusion, while BTM may not contain many elements of horror until the final scenes, it is a 5/5 film. Similarly, HTBSK is very good but simply isn’t comparable to a 5/5. By the way, there is a prequel to BTM coming out called Before The Mask (B4TM) which will likely follow Eugene. There was a funding drive which I would loved to contribute to in order to get some credits in the end.\n\nI can’t believe it’s taken Keanu Reeves this long to direct a film. Clooney has directed five mediocre movies at this point (including the dreadful looking Monuments Men, which opens this week), but we’ve only gotten one from the great Keanu, Lord of Woah and Dude (and also Dude, woah). I really like Reeves as a performer. He is the kind of solid actor who rarely lets you down. Even his bad movies are made entertaining by his sheer presences alone. In his directorial debut, Man of Tai Chi, Reeves shows some skill behind the camera as well as in front of it (in a supporting turn), but subpar special effects, a lackluster main story, and some pacing issues hold it back from being a better movie than it might have been.\n\nMan of Tai Chi is the story of Tiger Chen (newcomer Chen Hu), a Tai Chi-style martial arts who begins fighting in sanctioned tournaments in order to foster interest in his kung fu style, which is largely thought to be more for recreation or exercise than it is for tournament fighting. Utilizing his considerable talent, Tiger wins a match and draws the attention of Donaka Mark (Reeves), a villainous businessman with intentions of using Chen’s kung fu spectacle to make money in a series of illicitly filmed illegal underground street fights. Chen takes the job (believing it to be in private security) in order to pay for the renovation of his master’s Tai Chi temple, which needs considerable safety upgrades.\n\nReeves shows some deft skill behind the camera. The fights in Man of Tai Chi, which should be the draw for any kung fu film, are well-shot and well-choreographed, with nary an annoying jump cut or close-up to stifle the action. Chen’s various battles against other street fighters are violent affairs, with many taking a considerable amount of time to conclude. In one fight, Chen is nearly strangled to death with his tie, appearing to lose much of the fight before coming back and literally fighting for his life against his well-matched opponent. Even Chen’s sanctioned fights in the tournament are well done despite being secondary to the main plot.\n\nThe film’s main weaknesses are in its story as well as its special effects. Shot on a budget of 25 million (low for a Hollywood film but considerably high for a Hong Kong martial arts film), Man of Tai Chi looks amazing in some places (the set design stands out, particularly during the two-on-one fight) but horrifically cheap in others. In one scene, Detective Sun Jing Shi (Karen Mok), who is investigating the illegal underground fights, is run off the road in her car. The CGI car looks like it could have come from a second-rate police procedural on basic cable. The film’s story is also incredibly cliché, including the aforementioned subplot about needing to save the temple. The pacing is also interminably slow in places, especially when a film like this needs to maintain a breakneck pace to keep interesting (like 2011’s The Raid for example).\n\nThe performances are mostly fine. I don’t expect amazing caliber of acting in a martial arts film, and Chen Hu is decent as the lead. The script doesn’t call for him to do much other than show emotion when he is happy or sad and fight well, and he does indeed fight quite well. Reeves is fine as the villain. I honestly wouldn’t mind seeing him play a villainous role more often, but it is apparent Keanu is kind of content to just do his thing and appear randomly in movies of various quality every couple of years, and I can’t blame him for that. Supporting characters, mostly made up of recognizable Chinese actors and actresses, are also rather passable, even if some of the subplots are eye-rollingly cliché.\n\nI would say I had an ok time watching Man of Tai Chi. It’s not a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but it certainly delivers on the martial arts action. The story is incredibly cliché and the entire production seemed to skimp a bit on the special effects, but it is a perfectly passable film. Reeves has shown a great amount of respect for martial arts films in the past (his training for The Matrix for example), and he also shows a bit of talent behind the camera in his directorial debut. I wouldn’t mind seeing more Keanu Reeves-directed films in the future. His first film isn’t great, but it’s not without its merits either.\n\n-Z-\n\nOh, Taylor Lautner. He really isn’t that bad of an actor. He is good looking, likeable, and watchable enough. He’s no DeNiro, obviously, but he’s good enough to where he can helm a film and make a decent career for himself post-Twilight. He just needs to pick better projects. The 2011 John Singleton film Abduction is not that.\n\nIt is really, really bad. I wasn’t expecting it to be great. When I started to stream it from Netflix, I figured I’d at least be entertained by a B-level action film. It is not even that. The story and character actions are so nonsensical that I can’t believe that actors such as Alfred Molina and Sigourney Weaver were willing to sign on to such a turkey. Maybe it was a decent paycheck. Who knows?\n\nIn Abduction, Lautner plays a teen who discovers himself on a missing persons website. Though a series of events, he discovers that his parents are not his parents and that he is the son of a CIA agent who years earlier stole a list of corrupted CIA agents from some terrorist. Now, the terrorist learns of Lautner and plans to kidnap him so dad will return the list. Lautner then has to keep a step ahead of the terrorists and the CIA in order to save himself. Oh, he also has his would-be girlfriend in tow for inexplicable reasons.\n\nThis story makes absolutely no sense. The father has a list of the corrupted agents for, presumably, years. Why didn’t he turn this over to the CIA when he first got it? Why does the terrorist want this list back so badly? Why was Lautner put in a CIA-sponsored foster home to begin with? None of this makes any sense! The movie even runs with the assumption that because Lautner’s dad was the best of the best CIA agent, then, obviously, Lautner is also going to be like that. As far as I know, genetics generally doesn’t work like that.\n\nAlso, if Lautner was living with foster parents for 18 years, how come he didn’t realize this considering that he looks nothing like his parents? Maybe you could get away with that with another actor, but when you have Taylor Lautner (who comes from such a unique ethnic background) and two very Anglo-looking parents, wouldn’t that raise an eyebrow? I know. I know. I’m nitpicking. Maybe if the movie was better…\n\nAll that said, Singleton’s direction is fairly slick. His action sequences are solid and Lautner does have a flair for action. Him sticking to that genre might be a good choice.\n\nThis was a bad film. Laughably bad. It isn’t outright horrid as its watchable, but it almost feels like a parody of this type of teen thriller. Lautner is better than this, and if he really wants to pull in some non-Twilight success and/or acclaim like his co-stars have, he really needs to look over what scripts he is given. I know he can do it. I do!\n\nUnfortunately, that doesn’t look like that will be the case yet. Besides a cameo role in Grown Ups 2, Lautner hasn’t appeared in a non-Twilight film since Abudction. And the next movie he is going to headline is a Premium Rush knock-off with five credited writers attached to it. Sigh. A world without Taylor Lautner is not a world I want to live in.\n\nAt Wizard World 2001, a friend and I attended a panel on kung fu films from the 1980s. This was somewhat unusual for me, as I rarely visited panels in those days, especially at comic book conventions. Being my third consecutive Wizard World, we were most likely bored and just looking for something different to do. To say that one of the films screened and discussed – 1985’s Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Stars – changed my life would be a bit of an overstatement. But I would say it came pretty close. Nominally a simple story of a group of ne’er-do-wells who join forces with a no-nonsense, beautiful female police detective, the film is incredibly funny and highly entertaining as well as one of the best kung fu films of the 1980s.\n\nI knew the film was a sequel simply from viewing it, but I had no idea how to track down the other films in the series. In the younger days of the internet, we had Amazon.com and other online retailers, but Wikipedia was still brand new and I had no idea it even existed. In the mean time, I discovered other Sammo Hung/Jackie Chan collaborations like Project A and Wheels on Meals, and I loved both. But I still wanted more of the Lucky Stars. Their comedic antics and hijinks combined with the martial arts finesse possessed by Hung and Chan just appealed very highly to me and my kung fu film sensibilities.\n\nTwinkle, Twinkle Lucky Stars was so good, however, that it alone was almost able to sustain my interest in the Lucky Stars group for nearly ten years. During the winter of 2011, a massive blizzard swept through central Illinois, keeping me confined to my house and away from my job for three straight days. During this time off, I intended to rediscover some of my older kung fu films. After my fiftieth or so viewing of Twinkle, Twinkle, I finally decided to head straight to the internet and find some of the other films in the series. I managed to nab the first film, titled Winners and Sinners, and the second film, titled My Lucky Stars. For my 2014 reviewing, I skipped Winners and Sinners (I like the film but it is more like the prototype for what was to come) and went straight to the second and third in the series.\n\nRead more of this post\n\nJJ Abrams once said that Galaxy Quest is the one of the best Star Trek movies ever made. He is not wrong with that assessment. It is such a wonderful, quirky film that not only lampoons Star Trek and its fandom, but also is incredibly sweet towards it as well. That is a difficult balance to find, but Galaxy Quest pulls it off terrifically. But what made this film work within the context of the Star Trek fandom?\n\nFor starters, the film doesn’t take itself too seriously. Galaxy Quest plays with the idea of what would happen if the cast of a popular, but cancelled sci-fi TV show is thrown into a real sci-fi setting with the aliens thinking they are the characters they portrayed on the TV show. In other words, what would William Shatner do if he was really thrown into the captain’s seat of the Enterprise?\n\nIf this movie didn’t play up the goofy nature and was more straight-laced, then it wouldn’t have worked at all. The cast is perfect for their respective roles. Tim Allen in particular as the Shatner-like Jason Nesmith. Everyone is completely committed to their respective roles, and it clearly shows they are having a blast making the movie. They knew exactly what they were doing and were running with it. Because of that, they were able to sell it and make audiences connect with them.\n\nThe film does indirectly poke a lot of fun at the Star Trek fandom, but it is never malicious. Justin Long plays a hard-core Galaxy Quest nerd who, early on in the movie, is told off by Allen’s Nesmith. Long’s character is obsessive, overly technical, and has working knowledge of how things worked in the fictional world of the show. These elements are played for some light laughs, but interestingly enough, he is also the one who saves the day because of it. Again, that is another thing that sells the movie for the Star Trek fandom. They are the heroes.\n\nAlso, this movie came out in 1999. I usually pinpoint that Star Trek’s modern popularity peaked around 1996 before its downward spiral. By 1999, the franchise was still popular enough for this movie to be made and Trek fans and general moviegoers to see, get, and appreciate. If it was made any time after this, I doubt it would have flown. Galaxy Quest was the right movie at the right time.\n\nWhile the potential was there, I am glad they never made a Galaxy Quest 2. What more could have really been done. Warring cast members between spin-offs? A reboot? I guess these ideas have potential, but I feel all that was needed to be said for Galaxy Quest was successfully done the first time around. This really is a great film – not just for Trekkies, but for anyone who has a sense of humor.\n\n~N\n\nI caught this film about a week ago, but I haven’t had a chance to sit down and write about it. 12 Years a Slave depicts the true story of Soloman Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who was kidnapped and sold into slavery during the mid-1800s. It took him twelve years to prove the fact that he was a free man. During that time, he witnessed and was inflected with horrors that no person should have to endure.\n\nI wasn’t sure what to expect when I went into this movie. A film about a one of America’s darkest periods is always going to bring up certain questions and concerns. Will it treat the subject material respectfully or trivialize it? Will the characters (particularly the white characters) be fully realized or one-dimensional? Will it be gritty or gloss over the terrible nature of slavery. Fortunately, the film hits all the right notes and does what Django Unchained completely failed to do. 12 Years a Slave is arguably one of the more important films made from recent years.\n\nWhat really sells this movie is Ejiofor’s performance. He truly is terrific. A lesser actor would have played Soloman over-the-top or incredibly preachy. That sort of thing would have undermined the film (though wouldn’t be unexpected given that 12 Years… is a historical movie). Ejiofor goes another route with him being more subtle and quiet in the role. It makes Soloman feel like an “everyman”. This approach makes the viewer connect with him and want to see him through his struggles. I fully enjoyed with Ejiofor brought to the movie, and I really hope this propels him further into the mainstream.\n\nThe rest of the cast fills out nicely with fantastic supporting roles from Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch (this guy is everywhere it seems), and Lupita Nyong. I don’t know if it was the material or just the standard of quality from the actors, but the performances in this film are amazing. That said, there are some cameos in the film which are completely distracting, specifically that of Brad Pitt. Somehow, he is just too recognizable to see him in the role that he’s in for a film like this.\n\n12 Years… isn’t a perfect movie. There are elements that don’t quite work such as the aforementioned cameos, the pacing being a too slow (although that could have been a creative decision), a perplexing sex scene early on (at least I think that’s what it was), a few needlessly uncomfortable sequences (though I get why they were there) and some pretentious direction at times. However, all of this is really minor when compared to the rest of the film. 12 Years a Slave is an important film to see, especially if you want an unbiased look at slavery in the United States. I encourage people to check it out. It isn’t a film that you’d want to watch again and again, but it is worth seeing as its filmmaking at its finest.\n\n~N\n\nThe fifth film collaboration between legendary director Martin Scorsese and celebrated actor Leonardo DiCaprio, The Wolf of Wall Street is based on the real life rise and fall of Wall Street upstart and convicted criminal Jordan Belfort. It is an explicit film fraught with sex and drugs, and it is a pretty glorious affair. Directed with the touch of a master and filled with mesmerizing performances (including co-star Margot Robbie – who is about to get a lot more work – as Belfort’s wife Naomi), The Wolf of Wall Street is also one of the best films of 2013. It is funny, engaging, entertaining, and eminently watchable. A few flaws, however, keep it from truly standing out, but it is perhaps my favorite latter day Scorsese film.\n\nDiCaprio stars as Jordan Belfort, and the film essential follows his life over a five-year period. Belfort begins as a young analyst for an established firm on Wall Street, where big boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) takes a shine to him, inviting him to lunch and giving him the insider’s scoop on the life of a successful broker. The firm eventually collapses, and Jordan, on the brink of financial ruin, begins working for a small-time firm and eventually begins his own business based on his experiences selling penny stocks. The film then focuses on Belfort’s attempts to fit in with the big boys on Wall Street, chronicling his eventual downfall both at work and in his family life.\n\nDiCaprio’s performance throughout The Wolf of Wall Street is magnificent. It is a mature, nuanced performance that is highly entertaining. He is electrifying as Belfort, capturing the screen like few in Hollywood can do. It is interesting that DiCaprio would play two very similar characters in less than a year (His role in The Great Gatsby is fairly similar to Belfort) and yet his performance in each could be so different. It is unfortunate that the controversy behind the film may keep DiCaprio from winning the Best Actor Oscar, as will his perceived youth from the Academy (the baby-faced actor is only 39 – the average age of the last 5 Best Actor winners is something like 52).\n\nMy main criticism of The Wolf of Wall Street is that it is an incredibly explicit film, even when it doesn’t really need to be. Everything is over the top, and Scorsese, along with screenwriter Terence Winter, come awfully close to glorifying the horrific lifestyle Belfort lives. His drug abuse alone would be enough to cripple most able-bodied men, but he is also a sex addict, white-collar criminal, and suffers from intense bouts of rage, withdrawal, and paranoia. I don’t feel like the filmmakers condone Belfort’s lifestyle in the end, but truth be told it looks like a helluva lot of fun to do some of the fantastic things Belfort allegedly did (without the defrauding people out of millions of dollars part of course).\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street is also an incredibly long film at three hours, and I can only watch people do drugs and party for so long before it gets kind of tedious. Fortunately DiCaprio’s performance is so electrifying that the film, and Belfort himself, is never boring. There are also portions of the film that I feel could have been edited better, and I do feel the film suffered a bit from a lack of post-production in places. It had original been scheduled to release into theaters in November, but was pushed back for editing purposes. The end result is just fine, but the editing doesn’t quite match the otherwise high levels of quality throughout the film.\n\nThis is a pretty great movie. I was surprised by just how fun and funny it is. DiCaprio is absolutely electrifying, and Scorsese has made perhaps his best film since Goodfellas (I was not a fan of Gangs of New York and The Aviator and The Departed are good but not great films – the less said about Shutter Island the better). The Wolf of Wall Street is an explicit film featuring gratuitous nudity and drug abuse, and though this is excitingly filmed and entertaining to watch, it does get somewhat tedious by hour three. Ignore the controversy behind the film as well – The Wolf of Wall Street does not condone the actions of Belfort whatsoever. Scorsese and DiCaprio give cinematic life to a complicated character in a movie based on a real life tragedy and the end result is highly entertaining.\n\n-Z-\n\nIn January of 2009, critically reviled Kevin James vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop grossed over a hundred and forty million dollars domestically against a comparatively miniscule budget. The film turned James into an A-Lister, where he would go on to star in a bunch of even crappier movies than Blart. A catchy premise coupled with a fun marketing campaign helped propel the film into profitability after just its first weekend in theaters. The leggy film continued to dominate the box office in the weeks after its release, and a sequel has long been rumored (and is schedule to begin shooting in April of this year).\n\nJust a few short months after Blart’s successful run, another mall cop film was released. Starring Seth Rogen and directed by Jody Hill, Observe and Report garnered slightly better reviews than Paul Blart (51% RT score vs. 33% RT score), but was met with almost total disinterest at the box office, where it failed to gross in its entire run what Blart did in just one weekend. The film ultimately reeled in just 26 million dollars in box office sales against a budget of 18 million – not a total disaster but not a profitable venture for Warner Bros. either. Observe and Report became Rogen’s second flop in a row (after 2008’s Zack and Miri Make a Porno). He wouldn’t star in a hit film again until 2013’s This is the End. The film also derailed Jody Hill’s directing career – he hasn’t made a film since. So, what exactly went wrong?\n\nDescribed as “the dark mall cop movie,” Observe and Report featured complex and controversial film subject matter such as date rape (a still controversial scene features Rogen’s character having sex with a half conscious woman), full frontal male nudity, rampant drug abuse, and explicit language and violence – absolutely none of this was found in the family friendly (and PG-rated) Blart. And yet, the two were compared with each other ad nausea at the time, and many still remember Observe and Report as the failed mall cop movie from 2009. Also featuring in supporting roles Ray Liotta, Anna Faris, and Michael Pena, the film was also compared upon release to Martin Scorsese’s iconic Taxi Driver, with Rogen channeling the dark and twisted spirit of Robert DeNiro’s Travis Bickle.\n\nI don’t think in this case that the marketing was to blame for the failure of Observe and Report. The ad campaign clearly marked it as being a much more mature film than Paul Blart. The R-rating alone should have been a huge indicator of that. Additionally, marketing for the film was everywhere. Nearly every movie I saw in early 2009 featured a trailer for the film, and advertisements ran over and over again online, particularly on Hulu. But still, people reacted as if Observe and Report was ripping off Blart wholesale (something similar happened two years ago when people accused Dredd of ripping off The Raid – a ridiculous notion considering film production and development).\n\nA more likely scenario is that people flat-out rejected Observe and Report for its incredibly dark subject matter. People just generally don’t like black comedies. There is a long history of them failing at the box office. The only real example of a film with dark tendencies that succeeded at the box office was probably Horrible Bosses, and even that film was fairly light despite its dark premise, featuring characters that were likable despite their shortcomings. Observe and Report, like, for example, Very Bad Things before it, doesn’t feature characters likable and compelling enough to hold the interest of the general audience. I like this film a lot (Rogen gives his most mature and intense performance), but my tastes are an outlier here. The public largely rejected Observe and Report, and it is mostly remembered for being the other mall cop movie released in 2009.\n\n-Z-\n\nI know – I’ve been meaning to write this review for months. I’ve been promising and promising, and now nearly half a year after seeing it, I am finally reviewing the science-fiction film Europa Report. Directed by Sebastian Cordero, Europa Report is a non-linear found footage film starring, among others, Christian Camargo (Showtime’s Dexter), Sharlto Copley (The A-Team), and Embeth Davidtz (Schindler’s List). The film follows the fictional Europa One voyage, a privately funded space mission to Jupiter’s moon Europa. Davidtz plays Dr. Unger, the CEO of Europa Ventures, who narrates the film, explaining the events that take place on the ship and offering insight into the characters and the mission itself.\n\nEuropa Report’s non-linear story structure is both interesting and unique, setting it apart somewhat from other found footage films of the past few years. This is a genre I was tired of about five minutes after it began, but Europa Report is interesting as well in that it is a science fiction feature, whereas a majority of found footage films are in the horror genre, where diminishing returns are much higher. Europa Report also features great production design and camera work. Actually, much of the technical work behind the film is pretty solid, especially for something that cost less than ten million dollars to make.\n\nActing isn’t the film’s strong suit, but Copley stands out amongst the crowd of typically cast astronauts as the strongest member of the cast. Davidtz does fine as the film’s narrator, offering structure to the story. Comedy actor Dan Fogler shows up in a small role as a scientist and does fine as well. How this guy doesn’t get more consistent work is a mystery to me. The rest of the film’s cast, including the aforementioned Camargo, are mostly fine I guess, if somewhat nondescript. Part of the problem is that the script doesn’t exactly give the audience much of a reason to care about these characters outside of Copley’s family man.\n\nThe big problem I have with Europa Report is in its ending. The last act of the film, quite frankly, pretty much craps the bed. Europa Report is set up as a fairly serious and straightforward hard science fiction film, but its ending goes too far over the top for my liking. Without spoiling anything, the film veers into unfortunate sci-fi silliness, losing its more realistic edge. It would be like if Alfonso Cuaron’s Gravity ended with Sandra Bullock being eaten by a space monster out of nowhere. Everything up until the ending felt like it was building toward something neat, but then things just got weird.\n\nI find it hard to recommend Europa Report despite the awesome production design and great Copley performance. The film is fairly well-directed and it’s pretty incredible that a film this cheap looks so good, but the script just isn’t all that good. There has been a glut of found footage movies released in the past five or so years, and Europa Report is one of the better ones out there despite its last act problems. So I imagine if you like this tired subgenre of film, you might enjoy this movie. Sci-fi fans might also be interested, but like I said, be aware that the last act has its fair share of issues.\n\n-Z-"
