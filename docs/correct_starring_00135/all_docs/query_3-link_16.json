She played \"Caitlin Bee\" in the movie, which was filmed on location in the Leonardo section of Middletown.\n\nSpoonauer left acting 20 years ago and became a restaurant manager and event planner.\n\nKevin Smith, who became famous after making the film, posted a remembrance of Spoonauer on Instagram Tuesday\n\n\"Lisa was easily the most natural and authentic voice in the room,\" Smith wrote. \"She didn't sound like she was acting at all; she delivered scripted dialogue as if she was inventing her conversation in the moment, like people do in real life.\"\n\nSpoonauer was born in Rahway and raised in Freehold, settling in Jackson 6 years ago, according to her obituary.\n\nBelow is a video clip of the movie (video discretion advised for provocative language).\n\nSpoonauer was predeceased by her father, John Spoonauer. She is survived by her Husband, Tom Caron; her daughter, Mia Spoonauer; her stepson, Tyler Caron; her mother, Dolores Spoonauer; her twin Brothers, Michael and Mark Spoonauer and their Families; as well as her grandfather, Frank Figurelli.\n\n\"Lisa loved spending time with family and friends, helping anyone she could and laughing as much as she made other people laugh,\" according to her obituary.\n\nRelatives and friends are invited to attend Spoonauer's visitation on Friday from 4 to 8 p.m at the Geroge S. Hassler Funeral Home, 980 Bennetts Mills Rd, Jackson.\n\nHer funeral liturgy will be offered on Saturday at 9:30 a.m. at St. Aloysius Roman Catholic Church, 935 Bennetts Mills Road in Jackson. Entombment will follow in Maplewood Cemetery and Mausoleum, Route 537, Freehold Township.\n\nIf you wish to send flowers, please do so to the Hassler Funeral Home.
