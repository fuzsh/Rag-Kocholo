        "text": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1. \"Big hitter, the Lama - long.\"\n\nAnswer: Caddyshack\n\nThis was said by Carl Spackler (Bill Murray), when telling a young caddy about how he caddied for \"the Dalai Lama himself, twelfth son of the Lama, the flowing robes, the grace, bald, striking.\" \"Gunga-gunga-galunga.\" One of the greatest and most memorable quotes in comedy movie history.\n\n2. \"You know, there are a million fine looking women in the world, dude, but they don't all bring you lasagna at work. Most of them just cheat on you.\"\n\nAnswer: Clerks\n\nSilent Bob (Kevin Smith) said this to Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) when he found out that Dante was trying to dump Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), and get back together with his former girlfriend, Caitlin (Lisa Spoonhauer). By then, it was too late, and Veronica was already off to fellate 36 more guys.\n\nThere's some very well written dialogue in this cult classic, also written and directed by Kevin Smith.\n\n3. \"All you boys have seemed to learn is that Caesar is a 'salad dressing dude'.\"\n\nAnswer: Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\n\nThis was said by the history teacher, Mr. Ryan (Bernie Casey), just before he threatened to flunk both Bill and Ted. But with the help of Napoleon, Genghis Khan, and So-Crates, the boys did quite well.\n\n4. \"THERE'S ALWAYS TIME FOR LUBRICANT!\"\n\nAnswer: Evolution\n\nDr. Harry Block (Orlando Jones) said this when Dr. Paulson (Wayne Duvall) was about to perform surgery, after an alien had entered Harry's rectal cavity. The nurse said, \"I'll get the lubricant.\" Dr. Paulson replied, \"There's no time for lubricant\", to which Harry responded with the above quote (probably the same quote any of us would have responded with).\n\n5. \"You kicked some serious monk-ass there, baby!\"\n\nAnswer: Anger Management\n\nDr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson) said this to David Buznik (Adam Sandler) as they were fleeing a monastery. David and Buddy had gone there to confront David's boyhood bully, Arnie Shankman (John C. Reilly), who was now a Buddhist monk. This was a fight scene for the ages.\n\n6. \"Wait, you can't leave; I have to work late. If you can't work late, I can't work late. If I can't work late, I CAN'T WORK LATE!\"\n\nAnswer: Scrooged\n\nFrank Cross (Bill Murray) said this to his secretary, Grace (Alfre Woodard), when she told him she had to take her son to a doctor's appointment. \"Let's face it, Frank, garden slugs got more out of life than you did.\"\n\n7. \"We got no food, no clothes. Our pets' heads are falling off!\"\n\nAnswer: Dumb and Dumber\n\nLloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) said this after both he and Harry (Jeff Daniels) lost their jobs, and after a hitman left them a message by cutting the head off Harry's parakeet. This prompted them to go on a road trip. They raised some extra money for the road trip by taping the parakeet's head back on and selling it to a young blind boy.\n\nThis scene became even funnier when the boy later told the story of how he was duped on the primetime TV show, \"A Current Event\". I almost lost it when they interviewed that kid.\n\n8. \"Relax, alright? My old man is a television repairman; he's got this ultimate set of tools. I can fix it.\"\n\nAnswer: Fast Times at Ridgemont High\n\nJeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) said this after he and Jefferson's little brother (Stanley Davis, Jr.) totally trashed Jefferson's brand new Trans Am during a night of partying. This happened soon after Spicoli said that unforgettable line, \"People on 'ludes should not drive!\" The two youths doctored it to look like the Lincoln High football team had done it, so Jefferson (Forrest Whitaker) took it out on Lincoln during the game that weekend. \"LINCOLN KILLS!\"\n\n9. \"Randy lay there like a slug. It was his only defense.\"\n\nAnswer: A Christmas Story\n\nThis was said by the narrator when Ralphie (Peter Billingsley), his younger brother Randy (Ian Petrella), and their friends were being accosted by the bully Scott Farkus (Zack Ward), and his toadie Grover Dill (Yano Anaya). Randy fell to the ground and remained still, so as not to attract the attention of the kid with the yellow eyes and the kid whose lip curled over his green teeth.\n\n10. \"One time, my cousin Walter, got this cat stuck in his [butt] - true story. He bought it at the local mall, so the whole fiasco wound up on the news. It was embarrassing for my relatives, and all. But the next week, he did it again - different cat, same result, complete with another trip to emergency room.\"\n\nAnswer: Mallrats\n\nBrodie Bruce (Jason Lee) says this right at the beginning of the movie. It's the very first line. Brodie tells several gutbusting anecdotes like this one during the movie. The one about his cousin on the plane is pretty funny too, but it can't be quoted here.\n\n11. \"Fruit of me loins!? I haven't got fruit in me loins. Lice, yes - and proud of 'em - but no fruit.\"\n\nAnswer: Yellowbeard\n\nYellowbeard (Graham Chapman) said this after he returned from prison to find he had a son. His wife told him, 'He's the fruit of your loins, dear'. \"Yellowbeard\" (1983) is one the funniest movies ever written. This movie stars several of the Monty Python cast (including John Cleese as Blind Pew), and also Cheech & Chong, Dudley Moore & Peter Cook, Madeline Kahn, Peter Boyle and Marty Feldman. Arrrr!\n\n12. \"Take off those glasses. They're not regulation, and they make you stand out like a turd in a punch bowl.\"\n\nAnswer: Up the Academy\n\nThis was said by Major Vaughn Leisman (Ron Liebman) to Rodney Ververgaert (Harry Teinowitz). Ververgaert wore plastic goggles because things would suddenly burst into flames when he was around. Leisman absolutely rules in this highly underrated comedy film from 1980, directed by Robert Downey, Sr., and starring Ralph Macchio, Tom Citera, Antonio Fargas, and Tom Posten.\n\n13. \"Hey, Red Riding Hood, wanna be eaten by the Big Bad Wolf?\"\n\nAnswer: The Hollywood Knights\n\nThis was said by Newbomb Turk (Robert Wuhl) to a cute girl dressed in a Red Riding Hood costume for Halloween. The young lady responded by flipping him the bird and stating the line that accompanies it. Wuhl was hilarious in this 1980 classic. His rendition of \"Volare\" will live in infamy. \"Heavens, Nevans!\"\n\n14. \"Look at him. He's like a vicious little Chihuahua thing. He'll kill me the first chance he gets.\"\n\nAnswer: Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\n\nThis was said by Scott Evil (Seth Green) when he met Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). Mini-Me did not like Scott right from the start. In fact, Mini-Me tried to press the \"Scott Evil\" button and destroy him instantly, but he was denied.\n\n15. \"This is the worst looking hat I ever saw. What, when you buy a hat like this, I bet you get a free bowl of soup.\"\n\nAnswer: Caddyshack\n\nAl Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) said this after seeing a hat in the pro shop at Bushwood. When he stopped making fun of it, he turned around to see Judge Smails (Ted Knight) was already wearing one, to which Czervik quipped, \"Oh, it looks good on you, though.\" This quiz started with a memorable quote from \"Caddyshack\" and ended with one. I guess you might call it a tribute to one of the classic comedies of all time. Hope you enjoyed it.\n\nSource: Author miamisammy29\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor skunkee before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
