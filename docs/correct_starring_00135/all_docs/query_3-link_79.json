        "text": "The original Clerks was, arguably, geek culture’s first major shot across the mainstream bow upon its Oct. 1994 release. With the film having rode Cannes Film Festival buzz from earlier that year, the print-media-proliferated story of a regular dude from New Jersey selling his precious comic book collection to help fund his $27,575 indie passion project stoked a cultural curiosity that money couldn’t buy. Of course, said curiosity yielded the breakthrough of a lifetime for the dude in question, Kevin Smith. Now, some 27 years and several shared-universe films later, the filmmaker and recent Masters of the Universe visionary reveals that Clerks III will provide the ultimate onscreen homage to his watershed original: A Jay & Silent Bob dance number.\n\nThe wrap of principal photography for Clerks III was announced by director Smith in a celebratory tweet accompanied by a photo of the cast and producers inside of Quick Stop Groceries, specifically in front of what may very well be the most famous convenience store checkout counter in film history. However, he also teased the extent of the film’s inevitable array of nostalgic callbacks. Notably, he reveals that the final scene shot will recreate the famous, lines-deprived scene in the black-and-white original film, in which resident weed-addled storefront loiterers, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith), break into a slam dance as “Violent Mood Swings (Thread Mix)” by ‘90s radio era Industrial/Alternative band Stabbing Westward blasts on a boombox.\n\nThe original scene (which you can watch just below) was hardly supplemental to the plot, and appears randomly in the film, almost as an interlude utilized for pacing. However, the scene’s unforgettable nature is attributed both to the rather abrupt way it puts a comical veneer of accessibility on the drug-dealing twosome, who initially came across as rough characters—due to the contrast of Jay’s loud rhetoric and Bob’s initially-ominous silence. While some viewers might have predicted that the duo would eventually start a potentially-violent confrontation with embattled uptight counter jockey Dante Hicks (Brian O’Halloran) and adjoining, acerbic video store steward Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), their bluster was merely a facade. The scene initially sets a dark, shadowy, expressionistic tone before breaking into Jay’s wacky, quasi-hip-hop dance moves, and gets funnier when Bob unprecedentedly breaks his stoicism to join in on the number. Consequently, the duo was instantly transformed from dangerous delinquents into the C-3PO and R2-D2 of Smith’s still-embryonic View Askewniverse."
