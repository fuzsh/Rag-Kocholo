You're not even paying attention.\n\nRandal: No, I wasn't.\n\nCustomer: I don't think your manager would appreciate...\n\nRandal: I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.\n\nCustomer: I beg your pardon?\n\nRandal: Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.\n\nCustomer: I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.\n\nRandal: I hope it feels good.\n\nCustomer: You hope what feels good?\n\nRandal: I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?\n\nCustomer: Well this is the last time I ever rent here...\n\nRandal: You'll be missed.\n\nCustomer: Screw you!\n\n[The customer storms out. Randal runs out into the street.]\n\nRandal: Hey you're not allowed to rent here anymore!\n\nJay: Yeah!"
