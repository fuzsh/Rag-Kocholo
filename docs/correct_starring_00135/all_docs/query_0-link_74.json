In between, he has appeared in other Kevin Smith-directed films and has written, directed, and starred in Now You Know.\n\nContents\n\nClerks behind the scenes jeff anderson 1994 kevin smith movie hd\n\nKevin smith and jeff anderson now you know\n\nEarly life\n\nCareer\n\nFilmography\n\nReferences\n\nKevin smith and jeff anderson now you know\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in Connecticut and raised in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, Anderson attended Henry Hudson Regional High School, with his friend, aspiring writer Kevin Smith; they graduated in 1988.\n\nWhile Anderson was working at AT&T, Smith was working on his debut movie Clerks. As a joke, Anderson auditioned for the role of \"Jay,\" and based on this audition, Smith later offered Anderson a lead role as video store employee Randal Graves; a foul-mouthed apathetic slacker, who patronized, angered, and mocked his customers whilst avoiding any real work opportunities.\n\nCareer\n\nFor his role in Clerks, Anderson was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Debut Performance.\n\nIn 2002, Anderson wrote, directed, and starred in his own debut film (as writer/director) Now You Know. The writing process lasted only three months. Anderson received a nomination for Best Male Performance at the Chicago Film Festival for his role in Love 101, and has been seen in Peter Bergstrom's Something Cool. Anderson also started his own production company in Hollywood. In 2006, Anderson reprised his role as Randal in Clerks II.\n\nIn 2008, Anderson appeared in Kevin Smith's romantic comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno as Deacon, the cameraman and film editor for the porno made by leading stars Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks.\n\nOn September 14, 2010 Anderson made his first appearance on Kevin Smith's SModcast filling in for Scott Mosier on SModcast #134. In his podcast, Anderson stated he had moved out of Los Angeles and into a \"retirement community in the mountains\" where he is \"the youngest person there by 20 years.\" He also said he remarried in 2009, to an actress named Barbara Jacques he met while house sitting for Kevin Smith.\n\nIn April 2017, it was confirmed that production on the proposed sequel 'Clerks III' had ceased, as Anderson was not interested in appearing in the Kevin Smith directed film. Although an $8 million budget had been obtained, locations were being scouted in Philadelphia and a crew was being assembled, with less than 2 months until production was to start, Anderson decided he would not be involved; the reasons have not been made public. Smith said he would not recast the role and production on the film was halted indefinitely.\n\nFilmography\n\nActor\n\n2023\n\nLogic: Highlife (Music Video) as\n\nRandal\n\n2022\n\nClerks III as\n\nRandal\n\n2015\n\nRandal's Monday (Video Game) as\n\nRandal (voice)\n\n2015\n\nAlex Leyba Show (TV Series) as\n\nJeff Anderson\n\n2014\n\nFinding London (Short) as\n\nSam\n\n2011\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars (TV Series) as\n\nSmug\n\n- Wookiee Hunt (2011) - Smug (voice)\n\n2008\n\nZack and Miri Make a Porno as\n\nDeacon\n\n2006\n\nThe War That Made America (TV Mini Series documentary) as\n\nMilitary Re-Enactor\n\n- Unintended Consequences (2006) - Military Re-Enactor\n\n2006\n\nClerks II as\n\nRandal\n\n2004\n\nClerks: The Lost Scene (Video short) as\n\nRandal Graves (voice)\n\n2002\n\nNow You Know as\n\nGil\n\n2002\n\nThe Flying Car (TV Short) as\n\nRandal Graves\n\n2001\n\nJay and Silent Bob Strike Back as\n\nRandal Graves\n\n2001\n\nRennie's Landing as\n\nBuddy (convenience store clerk)\n\n2000\n\nClerks (TV Series) as\n\nRandal Graves\n\n- Leonardo Is Caught in the Grip of an Outbreak of Randal's Imagination and Patrick Swayze Either Does or Doesn't Work in the New Pet Store (2001) - Randal Graves (voice)\n\n- The Last Episode Ever (2001) - Randal Graves (voice)\n\n- Leonardo Leonardo Returns and Dante Has an Important Decision to Make (2001) - Randal Graves (voice)\n\n- Dante and Randal and Jay and Silent Bob and a Bunch of New Characters and Lando Take Part in a Whole Bunch of Movie Parodies- (2001) - Randal Graves (voice)\n\n- The Clipshow Wherein Dante and Randal Are Locked in the Freezer and Remember Some of the Great Moments in Their Lives (2000) - Randal Graves (voice)\n\n- A Dissertation on the American Justice System by People Who Have Never Been Inside a Courtroom, Let Alone Know Anything About the Law, But Have Seen Way Too Many Legal Thrillers (2000) - Randal Graves (voice)\n\n2000\n\nVulgar as\n\nSurly Duck (voice, uncredited)\n\n2000\n\nLove 101 as\n\nPhil\n\n1999\n\nDogma as\n\nGun Salesman\n\n1994\n\nSoul Asylum: Can't Even Tell (Music Video short) as\n\nRandal Graves\n\n1994\n\nClerks as\n\nRandal Graves\n\nDirector\n\n2002\n\nNow You Know\n\nWriter\n\n2002\n\nNow You Know (written by)\n\nProducer\n\n2022\n\nClerks III (executive producer)\n\nSoundtrack\n\n2006\n\nClerks II (performer: \"The Invisible Guests\")\n\nThanks\n\n2022\n\nClerks III (the director would like to thank: For being so great in Clerks II that I spent ten years trying to get Clerks III made. - as Jeff)\n\n2006\n\nClerks II (the director would like to thank: For not only coming back, but for knocking it out of the park and keeping me honest. - as Jeff)\n\nSelf\n\n2022\n\nMade in Hollywood (TV Series) as\n\nSelf\n\n- The Woman King/Confess, Fletch/Clerks III (2022) - Self\n\n2022\n\nThe Blake & Sal Show (Podcast Series) as\n\nPanel\n\n- At the Cons: FanExpo Chicago Day 1 (2022) - Panel\n\n2020\n\nCAVE iN (TV Series) as\n\nSelf\n\n- Put Out To Pasture (2020) - Self\n\n2018\n\nExcelsior Journeys with George Sirois (Podcast Series) as\n\nSelf - Guest\n\n2009\n\nMoney Shots (Video) as\n\nSelf\n\n2009\n\nPopcorn Porn: Watching 'Zack and Miri Make a Porno' (Video documentary) as\n\nSelf - Actor\n\n2006\n\nBack to the Well: Clerks II (Video documentary) as\n\nSelf - 'Randal'\n\n2006\n\nTrain Wreck!
