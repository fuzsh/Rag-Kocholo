The forum had learned of its terminal condition a few weeks earlier.\n\nThe IMDb MB had enjoyed a mostly well-behaved childhood, but became far more difficult to handle around 20o7 after being introduced to video games and the subgroup that plays them. A later interest in political matters would unfortunately develop into a pathological obsession, ultimately contributing to its premature demise.\n\nThe forum is survived by thousands of devoted users.\n\nThe IMDb MB asked that it be remembered as a place where movie lovers were able to exchange information and ideas, and that memorials in its name NOT be posted on Facebook or Twitter.\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\nJapanese filmmaker Seijun Suzuki has died at the age of 93.
