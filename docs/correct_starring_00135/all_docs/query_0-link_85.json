        "text": "2. THEMES INDEPENDENT - CLERKS  Clerks is for a very Niche Audience.  There are many themes with in this film including:  Corporate lobbying and image crafting -- The best example of this is the bubble gum salesman who incites an anti-cigarette mob so as to sell more bubble gum. Also, Dante's comment \"Ever notice how all of the prices end in 9?\"  A failing education system -- The guidance counselor who sits on the floor for hours looking for a perfect carton of eggs.  General misalignment of incentives -- Dante is constantly taking blame for other's actions and they even discuss how in the Return of the Jedi, the Rebels probably killed a lot of innocent contractors and laborers by destroying the under-construction Death Star.  Cultural norms and societal expectations -- Don't let society force you into a life you don't want.  Dante and the life he loves – Dante Is torn between the life which while unglamorous allows him to be with the people he cares about, and the life he thinks he should have (settling down and getting a good job).  “It's not the destination, but the trip\". -- You could say that the movie is saying life isn't about achieving goal its about living a life that makes you happy. And a life with friends will make the journey better. MAINSTREAM – CAPTAIN AMERICA WINTER SOLDIER  Captain America is also for a very Niche audience of those who love Marvel and Superhero fans.  There are many obvious themes running throughout this film including:  Battle – There are many battles throughout the film. Including the battle at the end of the as Captain America attempts to save the city.  Assassin – The main evil character.  Love – Captain Americas love for his friend who sadly passed away. This theme is also portrayed by Captain Americas undecided mind whether to let his colleague ‘set him up’ or not.  There are also many more important themes which support the story and create the film.  Moral dilemmas -- The events of The Winter Soldier will have him questioning everything he believed. Captain America faces a lot of challenges throughout  Politics -- Since Cap has the ethics of someone raised in the ’40s; they looked to ‘70s political thrillers for inspiration to make Captain America as a character very out of date. With him not really knowing right and wrong.  Distrust -- Marvel Studios President of Production, pointed out that in the comics; Cap dealt with Watergate and the Reagan era, a time in which many people became distrustful of the government. In this film ‘Shield’ takes the role of the government and no character trusts or believes in them.\n\n3. MISE-EN-SCENE  The Mise en scene of a shot can tell the viewer a great deal of information ranging from a characters class to their emotional attachment to other characters in the scene.  The Russo brothers (Anthony and Joe Russo) put their film making knowledge to good use when directing the action packed, Marvel movie Captain America. They managed to make sure every single shot was important and jam packed full of information using Mise en scene. At a first glance it is clear that the characters are in some kind of hygiene facility such as a hospital due to the simplicity in the decoration and lack of colour. As a result of the lack of colour in the background the characters in this shot stand out a lot and some more than others to show importance. The character Black Widow played by Scarlet Johansson stands out from the others significantly with her bold, green jacket on which could mean that she is a key character in this scene and one that the directors want the viewer to focus their attention on. The other actors are wearing quite dull blue clothing which complements the idea again that Black Widow is one of the most important other than the man deceased in the bed, Nick Fury, whose importance is shown through the use of blocking and distance of the actors from the camera. The lighting is also a strong indicator as to who the eye should focus on due to the fact that because of it one can see Black Widows expression very clearly indicating just how strong her emotions were for Nick Fury. MAINSTREAM – CAPTAIN AMERICA WINTER SOLDIER The audience can see the strength of Bucky as he is slowing himself down to a stop by digging his bare, metal hand into the concrete in order to stop himself. The power of this character is complemented by the car travelling in the background as it shows just how fast he is travelling and how hard he must brace in order to slow his whole body down.\n\n4.  The Mise en scene with in Clerks is very simple with its static camera angels, black and white lighting and simple props and scenery.  There are many scenes in Clerks and the majority of them involve long conversations with static camera angles. This is so we see all the action in the shot and to represent how the ‘Clerks 'are bored of their jobs. This is evident in these scenes. MISE-EN-SCENE INDEPENDENT – CLERKS\n\n5.  Fight scenes are the highlights of this film and they are edited in a very clever way. There is contrast of pace through out these scenes to add suspense for the audience and to make them feel on edge. In one scene especially in a fight between Cap, Bucky and Black Widow, Bucky is walking slowly around the cars in search of Black Widow. There is very little movement and the camera movements are also very slow.  The pace of the scene then quickly changes when Black Widow jumps on Bucky. The camera movements are quick and there are various jump cuts. With in 2 seconds of Black Widow jumping on Bucky there are 4 different camera angles all edited together using jump cuts this adds pace and drama contrasting to the early moments of the scene. EDITINGMAINSTREAM – CAPTAIN AMERICA WINTER SOLDIER\n\n6.  Kevin Smith has many long takes in Clerks especially in scenes when Dante is stood behind the counter. These long takes make the conversations feel more natural, like the viewer is actually there observing and listening to the conversations.  Another example of long takes is when Dante and Randal are talking about ‘Return of the Jedi’. Whilst they are discussing the camera only cuts away from them twice showing a customer overhearing their conversation. Other than these two cuts the scene is static making it feel like a natural conversation.  Kevin Smith has separated the movie into acts. He has done this as ‘Clerks’ takes place over the span of one day and a lot of time passes between certain scenes. These acts separate these scenes into different parts of Dante’s day as we start with the act ‘Dante’ and end with ‘Denouement’  Quick cuts are also used throughout the film. These quick cuts are used to show the customers that Dante and Randal are talking about as well as showing Jay shoplifting. EDITINGINDEPENDENT – CLERKS\n\n7.  The Winter Soldier had a soundtrack produced by Henry Jackman in June 2013. After spending around six months writing music for the film, Jackman recorded the album at Air Studio in London. In an article supported by Wikipedia Jackman said, “It's produced with all the tricks I’ve learnt from spending years in the record industry but then it’s also got the kind of injection of symphonic, thematic, heroic music that all kind of merges into one musical, and hopefully coherent piece\".  The track list for the soundtrack is as follows with all the song title names.  Every piece of music involved in the film links with the scene to portray the emotion and to add to the tension and suspense with in the fight senses and scenes of sadness. Although music is heavily used sound effects are also used to enhance the anger and make the fighting seem more painful when a character gets hit. In the elevator scene when they all try and kill Captain America there is deep bass drums playing throughout and then loud sound effects over the top. The sound effects strengthen the scene and make it more realistic adding drama and anguish to see if Captain America will win the fight. SOUNDMAINSTREAM – CAPTAIN AMERICA WINTER SOLDIER\n\n8.  Kevin Smith hasn't incorporated a lot of sound as there are no emotional and upbeat scenes in the film.  However in one scene there is music and sound effects used. This is the hockey scene when they play on the roof of the store.  There are drum roles when Dante is head to head with his opponent to add anticipation of who will win.  The sound effects are then heard as they add the comedy to the scene. When the opponent hits the ball it goes souring through the air and there is a comical whistle representing it flying for miles.  Another comical sound effect is used when the ball goes into the drain as there is a down sliding trumpet sound and the camera quickly cuts to reveal the sad expressions of the hockey players. SOUNDINDEPENDENT – CLERKS Drum Role Comical Whistle Ball Down sliding trumpet\n\n9.  Trent Opaloch was the cinematographer for Winter Soilder and he used incredible equipment to produce a high quality film.  The film has a gritty cinematography with its “authentic” history channel look. The movie opens with Cap and Falcon’s morning runs. It’s a very interesting opening shot, very low key for a superhero movie. They opened the film in this way as it allows the film to build up as if it had opened with the Lemurian Star mission, straight into combat, the film would have no were to go and would feel engery less throughout the rest of it.  There is a sweeping shot of the Lemurian Star above, showing us the entire ship. It could have easily jumped from Cap landing in the water directly to him climbing aboard the ship, but Trent Opaloch didn’t do that. Instead, they show the audience the entire ship in a shot giving a visual focus on what Cap and his team are about to fight on. It is also to make it more visually engaging for the audience.  Frequently throughout the movie, the camera is shaky and placed behind objects. This conveys a sense of being in the world with the characters, maybe even that the viewers are unseen spies looking in on this world of spies. Y MAINSTREAM – CAPTAIN AMERICA WINTER SOLDIER\n\n10.  The Cinematographer of Clerks had to focus on the budget meaning that nearly every shot was handheld with occasionally a pan shot to keep the film interesting. In one scene in particular there are many jump cuts when ‘Dante’ is making coffee.  There is a pan shot with Randall as he walks into the newsagents. They decided to use a pan effect here to add to the comedy as Randall is also dancing whilst entering the shop so the pan makes us feel more involved in the shot as we follow him whilst dancing. Y INDEPENDENT – CLERKS\n\n11.  As Clerks is an independent film it had a very tight budget of:  $230,000  The director of Clerks, ‘Kevin Smith’ couldn’t afford any more money to be put on the film and this is the reason there are no special effects or breath taking scenes as there are in Mainstream Films.  The film grossed:  $3,151,130  This budget includes:  Stock  Equipment Rentals  Processing  Editing  Mixing  Print  Captain America had a very expensive budget of:  $170 Million  The Production Company of this film was ‘Marvel’. Marvel make on Average $716 million each film meaning that they can incorporate incredible scenes which are the highlights of the film were as Independent Films cannot compete with this.  The film grossed:  $259,766,572  This film broke Box Office records in 2014. INDEPENDENT - CLERK BUDGET MAINSTREAM – CAPTAIN AMERICA WINTER SOLDIER\n\n12.  The marketing team behind Captain America Winter Soldier created many posters to tease the audience and to show each character in detail. They produced a poster for each character to give a visual representation of what they look like and to give them information about the character before watching.  They also created an official Winter Soldier game which is available on App Store, Google Play and Windows Phones. Empire magazine wrote a review which was released on the 28th March 2014 praising the film attracting more viewers into the cinemas. The teaser trailer was released onto YouTube on May 31st 2013 which is months before its release in cinemas meaning that Marvel will pull in a wider audience. The trailer shows every character in action and the weapons being used. This shows the unique selling point which is the superheroes and the weapons are a fan favorite especially Captain Americas Shield. MARKETING MAINSTREAM – CAPTAIN AMERICA WINTER SOLDIER\n\n13.  Clerks Kevin Smith used various marketing strategies to promote his film.  He created a Clerks fan site and Smith became a constant presence on its message board. As a result of what Kevin gives, the fans give it right back and today Smith has a web empire with his board having over 3,000 posts. He made an “in- theater” audio commentary to entice iPod-toting fans of his question and answer sessions about Clerks and you can also listen to various scenes from Clerks.  Smith created a MySpace page which now has 50,000 friends.  A poster was created which captioned the films main slogan and main characters. Another poster was also made with just the characters involved with their names pointing down to them making the characters recognisable already before the audience sit down and watch the film.  Clerks official trailer was then made showing all the comedy elements with in the film with various puns included. The trailer also shows every character and the setting of the film giving the audience the significant visuals that are mostly seen in the film. MARKETINGINDEPENDENT - CLERK\n\n14.  The target audience for Clerks is basically those in their early 20s who work minimum- wage for example, customer-service jobs. Those jobs that essentially serve as our one meagre means of income during our college years. Having first watched this during college and while working at a grocery store, I could relate to various aspects of this movie a bit too well. As anyone who's worked a day in customer service of any kind will tell you, some customers are very abrupt. And Clerks pokes fun at this very fact in some outrageous, yet totally human ways.  The main target audience of this film is for people who enjoy a lot of combat and gun fighting scenes. This film has a lot of violence as well throughout the film. This film mainly targets males from the ages of 15 upwards because they are the ones who are most interested in this type of film. Also this film is for those who have read the Marvel Comics of Captain America and enjoyed it. AUDIENCE TARGETINGINDEPENDENT - CLERK MAINSTREAM – CAPTAIN AMERICA WINTER SOLDIER\n\n15.  There are many actors involved with Clerks but as Clerks is an independent film the entire cast is unknown and doesn’t have any famous names which would attract the audience to the film.  Kevin Smith could only afford to employ this cast as his budget wouldn’t even be able to pay for an actor from Captain America.  All three of these un-famous actors are an example of who Kevin Smith used and each of them only have recognition for performing in this film.
