        "text": "[Pictured: Ryan Coogler]\n\nBy Stephanie Ornelas\n\nSummer might be winding down but the fall film season is just getting started. And this is only the beginning as we ramp up to another awards season and the 2023 Sundance Film Festival. Audiences are eagerly heading to theaters to see the Wakandans charge ahead to their next chapter, Harry Styles embody an eerie heartthrob who’s up to no good, and Viola Davis raise up a new group of women warriors.\n\nSome viewers might not be aware that the directors of these highly anticipated movies have direct ties to the Sundance Institute and Film Festival, having written, directed, and even starred in award-winning Festival favorites. So, before you make your way to the big screen in your hometown, check out some of the past Sundance Festival films these creators were involved in:\n\n… SEE Mother and Child (2010 Sundance Film Festival)\n\nRodrigo García’s drama follows the lives of three women who share a common core: they have all been profoundly impacted by adoption. Karen (Annette Bening) had a baby as a teen and gave her up at birth. And she’s been haunted ever since by the daughter she never knew. Elizabeth (Naomi Watts) grew up as an adopted child; and Lucy (Kerry Washington) is just embarking with her husband on the adoption odyssey. (Available to stream on Starz and Direct TV, to rent on Amazon and Apple TV+)\n\n… SEE Clerks (1994 Sundance Film Festival)\n\nDante (Brian O’Halloran) is called in to cover a shift at his New Jersey convenience store on his day off. His friend Randal (Jeff Anderson) helps him pass the time, neglecting his video-store customers next door to hang out in the Quick Stop. The uneventful day is disrupted by news that one of Dante’s ex-girlfriends has died. After attending her memorial service, he muses over staying with current girlfriend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) or reuniting with his ex (Lisa Spoonhauer). (Available to stream on Paramount+, to rent on AppleTV+)\n\n… SEE The Words (2012 Sundance Film Festival)\n\nWatch Olivia Wilde join this epic cast that includes Bradley Cooper, Dennis Quaid, and Zoe Saldana. In the film, a struggling writer discovers a lost manuscript and decides to pass the work off as his own. After finally receiving the recognition he desperately craves, he soon learns that living with his choice is not as easy as he thought.\n\n“All I can say about the casting process was that we had very limited resources and very little time to make this movie,” said director Brian Klugman during the film’s post-screening Q&A at the Sundance Film Festival. “Had we had unlimited resources and unlimited time, we still would have cast every single person the same.” (Available to rent on AppleTV)\n\n… SEE House Party (1990 Sundance Film Festival)\n\nIn Reginald Hudlin’s ’90s classic, highschooler Play (Christopher Martin) is planning the ultimate house party. His best friend, Kid (Christopher Reid), wants to go more than anything, but when he gets into a fight at school, his father grounds him. Still determined to go, Kid sneaks out of the house and faces one calamity after another as he makes his way to the party of the school year. (Available to stream on HBO Max, to rent on AppleTV+)\n\n… Check Out Spanking the Monkey (1994 Sundance Film Festival)\n\nDavid O. Russell made his directorial debut at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival with Spanking the Monkey. In the comedy/drama, a medical student is forced by his traveling salesman dad to cancel a top summer internship to look after his attractive mom, who’s bedridden with a broken leg. As she begins relying on her son for both physical and emotional needs, he starts developing disturbing and unwanted new yearnings.\n\n…SEE The Souvenir (2019 Sundance Film Festival)\n\nBased on Joanna Hogg’s real-life experiences, The Souvenir follows Julie as she hosts a film-school cohort party where she meets a mysterious man named Anthony. A few days later, Anthony invites Julie to a grand hotel and asks to stay with her for a few days. Thus begins Julie’s first serious love affair. Ignoring her friends and borrowing large amounts of money from her parents, Julie surrenders to the relationship and prioritizes Anthony’s needs. (Available to stream on Fubo, Showtime, Hoopla, and Kanopy)\n\n…SEE Stoker (2013 Sundance Film Festival)\n\nWhile you wait for Park Chan-wook’s newest release to drop, you might want to see his 2013 film Stoker. After India’s (Mia Wasikowska’s) father dies in an auto accident, her Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), who she never knew existed, comes to live with her and her emotionally unstable mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman). Soon after his arrival, she comes to suspect this mysterious, charming man has ulterior motives, but instead of feeling outrage or horror, this friendless girl becomes increasingly infatuated with him. (Available to rent on Apple TV+)\n\n…SEE Clemency (2019 Sundance Film Festival)\n\nDon’t miss Chinonye Chukwu’s drama about a prison warden who, over the years, has been drifting away from her husband while dutifully carrying out executions in a maximum security prison. When she strikes up a unique bond with death-row inmate Anthony Woods, a layer of emotional skin is peeled back, forcing her to confront the complex relationship between good intentions, unrequited desires, and what it means to be sanctioned to kill. (Available to stream on Hulu)\n\n…SEE Loved Up (1996 Sundance Film Festival)\n\nBack in 1996, Ol Parker was the screenwriter of Loved Up, a film about a girl who meets and falls in love with a raver at a London cafe. But after losing her job, she gets introduced to the British drug scene and the seedier world of dealing. (Available to stream on Hoopla, to rent on Amazon)\n\n…SEE Fruitvale Station (2013 Sundance Film Festival)\n\nBlack Panther director Ryan Coogler made his directorial debut at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival for Fruitvale Station. The drama follows Oscar Grant (Michael B. Jordan), a 22-year-old Bay Area resident, during his final hours leading up to when he was fatally shot in the back by police at Fruitvale district station in Oakland, California.\n\n“Oscar and I were born in the same year and came up in the Bay area through some of the same circumstances,” Coogler said during his film’s post-screening Q&A. “Often you’re not looked at as a full human being, sometimes by someone who’s supposed to protect you, sometimes by someone you bump into on the street. But any of the 118 movies here has a piece of that director’s life in it.” (Available to stream on BET+, to rent on AppleTV)\n\n…SEE Call Me By Your Name (2017 Sundance Film Festival)\n\nAnother drama from Luca Guadagnino to check out is Call Me By Your Name. In the summer of 1983, a precocious 17-year-old is staying with his family at their 17th-century villa in Lombardy, Italy. He soon meets Oliver, a handsome doctoral student who’s working as an intern for Elio’s father. Amid the splendor of their surroundings, Elio and Oliver discover the heady beauty of awakening desire over the course of a summer that will alter their lives forever. (Available to stream on Hulu and Apple TV+)"
