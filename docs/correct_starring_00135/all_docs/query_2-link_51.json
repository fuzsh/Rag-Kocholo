        "text": "Lisa Spoonauer sadly passed away at the young age of 44. The Clerks star unexpectedly died on Saturday, May 20 after her family reportedly called 911 at 11:05pm, according to TMZ. Lisa was not breathing by the time law enforcement and EMTs arrived at her home in Jackson, New Jersey. Lisa’s family did not say what caused her death, but a private funeral has been planned for Saturday, May 27. Lisa was survived by her husband Tom Carnon, their daughter Mia Spoonauer, and her stepson Tyler Caron.\n\nLisa starred in the cult classic Clerks as Caitlin Bree in 1994. She only was in one other movie called Bartender in 1997 before she left the acting business to have a career as a restaurant manager and event planner. She left a powerful impression on her Clerks costars. They shared their fondest memories of Lisa in a series of heartfelt posts on social media. Clerks‘ writer and director Kevin Smith, 46, was in complete shock over the news. “Devastated to report that #LisaSpoonauer, who played Caitlin in #clerks, has passed away,” he wrote. He praised Lisa’s “natural and authentic voice” as an actress and said she absolutely “CRUSHED” her first scene with Brian O’Halloran, 47, in “one long take that still remains one of my favorite scenes I’ve ever shot.”\n\nKevin shared a hilarious story about how he asked Lisa to be a part of Clerks when he walked up to her after an acting class. “I approached Lisa cold in the parking lot after the class and said ‘This is gonna sound creepy but… Do you wanna be in a movie?’ Fearlessly, she replied ‘Not if it’s porn,'” he wrote. Marilyn Ghigliotti, 55, said she was “heartbroken” to learn about Lisa. “I was blessed to have gotten to share an experience with her and the rest of the Clerks family that cannot be measured and will always be remembered.” Brian shared his own thoughts about Lisa and wrote, “not a day goes by that she was mentioned or remembered in some fashion.” He added, “she will live on in my heart and in the hearts of millions. Always in my heart. Rest in Peace Lisa.”"
