        "text": "Want to feel old? Tomorrow marks the 25th anniversary of The Lion King’s theatrical premiere. In the years since, the Disney classic has been followed by two straight-to-video sequels, a multiple award-winning stage musical, and soon, a remake featuring ultra-realistic CGI animals (don’t call it live-action!). But at the time, The Lion King was just one among an extraordinarily strong slate of feature-film releases. Want to program your very own 1994-inspired film festival? Start with these. (Note: the only reason this list doesn’t also include Four Weddings and a Funeral is that I just mentioned it on Monday.)\n\nClerks\n\n(free to stream for Hulu subscribers)\n\nIn director Kevin Smith’s first feature film, disgruntled convenience store clerk Dante (Brian O’Halloran) gets called in to work on his day off, and whines through it with his friend Randal (Jeff Anderson), who works in the video store next door. During his shift, Dante contemplates what ethical responsibility contractors had in working on the Death Star; whether he should be more appreciative of his girlfriend, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), or pursue his ex Caitlin (Lisa Spoonauer) despite her engagement to another guy; and why customers obsessively check eggs and milk.\n\nDumb and Dumber\n\n(free to stream for Netflix subscribers)\n\nBefore he was winning Oscars for his work on Green Book, Peter Farrelly made his directing debut with Dumb and Dumber, on a script he cowrote, with his brother, Bobby. Limousine driver Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) discovers that his fare, Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), has left her briefcase in his car. Not knowing she did so purposely, since it contains the ransom for her kidnapped husband, Lloyd and his best friend, Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels), road-trip from Providence to Aspen to return it, getting in many idiotic scrapes on the way.\n\nEd Wood\n\n(available to stream for rent or purchase on iTunes)\n\nTim Burton directed this black-and-white biopic. Edward Scissorhands star Johnny Depp reteamed with Burton to play the titular Wood: war veteran; transvestite; and legendarily bad director of enduring cult films. The supporting cast includes Bill Murray, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Patricia Arquette; the late Martin Landau won a best-supporting-actor Oscar for playing Wood’s star, Bela Lugosi.\n\nForrest Gump\n\n(available to stream for rent or purchase on iTunes)\n\nTom Hanks won his second consecutive best-actor Oscar for playing the eponymous Forrest in the adaptation of Winston Groom’s novel. The film spans decades as it follows Forrest from his childhood as an intellectually disadvantaged boy in Alabama through his service in Vietnam, his ping-pong-playing trip to China, and—amid many other historical events at which he happens to find himself—his lifelong love for his friend Jenny (Robin Wright). Some story points are problematic now, but it is a best-picture Oscar winner—and something your dad might enjoy watching with you on Father’s Day.\n\nThe Hudsucker Proxy\n\n(available to stream for rent or purchase on iTunes)\n\nIn 1958 New York City, Indiana business college grad Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) fails upward at Hudsucker Industries, becoming president as part of a crooked stock scheme he knows nothing about. Smelling a story, journalist Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh) embeds herself in the company as Norville’s assistant, where she is present for his invention of the shockingly successful hula hoop—and finds herself charmed by Norville’s gormless sweetness.\n\nPulp Fiction\n\n(free to stream for Netflix subscribers)\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s second feature film—a hilarious, violent, nonlinear narrative about small-time criminals and mobsters in Los Angeles—revived America’s love affair with surf rock, introduced countless sheltered viewers to the concept of a “gimp,” and earned Oscar nominations for stars Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, and best picture, winning in the category of best original screenplay.\n\nQuiz Show\n\n(free to stream for Netflix subscribers)\n\nHerb Stempel (John Turturro) is a multi-episode winner on the primetime game show 21. But when he suddenly loses, he claims he was coerced by producers to throw the game in order to clear the path for Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), an instructor at Columbia and the scion of a family of famed writers. Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) is the Congressional staffer tasked to investigate Herb’s claims; Robert Redford directs from Paul Attanasio’s script, adapted from the real Goodwin’s book, and packs the cast with instantly recognizable character actors including Paul Guilfoyle, Christopher McDonald, Griffin Dunne, David Paymer, and Hank Azaria.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption\n\n(available to stream for rent or purchase on iTunes)\n\nAfter The Hudsucker Proxy, Tim Robbins starred as Andy Dufresne, a mild-mannered bookkeeper convicted of murdering his wife and sentenced to life in the titular prison. There, he befriends Red (Morgan Freeman), a practiced smuggler. Andy asks Red to get him a rock hammer so that he may use it to shape interesting stones he finds in the yard. No 25-year-old spoilers, but: That is not actually what Andy uses the rock hammer for!\n\nThe River Wild\n\n(free to stream for Netflix subscribers)\n\nIn order to try to heal his relationship with his wife, Gail (Meryl Streep), a former river-rafting guide, Tom (David Strathairn) decides to join her on her rafting trip with their son, Roarke (Joseph Mazzello). At the start of their trip, they meet another party of rafters. Gail is suspicious of them—rightly so, as it turns out, since they soon mysteriously lose one of their number, and the remaining two, played by John C. Reilly and Kevin Bacon, force Gail at gunpoint to guide them down the river and away from legal authorities.\n\nSpeed\n\n(available to stream for rent or purchase on iTunes)\n\nOnce you’ve seen the latest John Wick movie and Always Be My Maybe on Netflix, you can keep your Keanu Reeves crush alive by reaching into his earlier filmography and revisiting Speed. Reeves plays LAPD officer Jack Traven, who learns that a city bus has been rigged with explosives if its speed drops below 50 mph. Jack must board the bus and keep it moving with the help of Annie (Sandra Bullock), whom he deputizes to drive while he maneuvers to get her and her fellow passengers off the bus to safety despite unpredictable hazards.\n\nAll products featured on Vanity Fair are independently selected by our editors.
