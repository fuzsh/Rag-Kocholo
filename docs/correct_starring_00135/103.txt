Clerks

CLERKS is one wild day in the life of a pair of overworked counter jockeys whose razor-sharp wit and on-the-job antics give a whole new meaning to customer service. With hilarious scenes starring Jay, Silent Bob and director Kevin Smith, you should just plunk down your effin' cash now and add this to your collection of great movies.
