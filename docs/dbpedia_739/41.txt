JACK DEMPSEY

VISITS PERTHI

FORMER WORLD CHAMPION

The Future of the Ring.

If one listens to Jack Dempsey

(now Commander, US Coast Guard),

he is quickly convinced that the

former heavyweight champion of

the world, and one of the greatest

sporting figures of the century, is

sincerely in love with Australia and

would gladly make it his home.

Dempsey arrived in Perth on Satur

day night to visit USN personnel in

this area, and is staying at the Weld

Club.

"Australia is new and a man's

country," he said yesterday. "It

appeals as a country of romance and

for its newness. It reminds me of

my home State of Colorado, and if

I were a young man I would return

here. It's the place in which to

make a start."

Dempsey then talked of the warI

(he has -been at Okinawa and has

travelled 21,000 miles by air in the

last few weeks in the Pacific), and

then of sport. Were there any more

Phar Laps about? What prices were

horses bringing? Still, he thought

the temporary wartime ban on rac

ing in America was a good thing.

Probably it would be removed im

mediately the European war ended.

Comparisons with the Past.

The future of boxing? Would it

boom again as it did after the last

war? The former champion was

now on familiar ground, and when

he talked of the future he drew

largely on the comparisons provided

by his own past. "It will take some

time in America before we get boxing

back on its feet after the war," he

said. "I have a club of my own at

home and these clubs produce many

good fighters. Then, when you get

the right boys they must be matched

well and brought along gradually.

They can't be champions in five

minutes. Experience is what they

must have. Experience in actual

fghts, in the ring, is the thing. Bad

experience only comes from those

who don't know what they are doing.

"I had a lot of great fighters to

learn from, and a number of great

trainers. I had the gloves on with

Sam Langford, James J. Corbett,

James J. Jeffries, Young Peter Jack

son, Griffo, the elusive Australian,

and others. Griffo would stand on

a handkerchief and give you 25 dol

lars if you could hit him. You had

to be fast.

"Then there were trainers like

Jimmy de Forrest, and in those days

we had to work hard. We did seven

or eight miles on the road every

morning and when we got into the

ring to train we didn't spare the

partners. We always hit to hurt i

the work-outs and were in earnest.

There were plenty of actual fights'

too, and it made us tough. It was!

important having good men to work

out with. Good partners make good

boxers. You can always tell how

good a boxer Is by the men he has

in the gymnasium to work with. If

he's good he will have good partners,

and if he is no good hell have no

bodies round him.

"The Breaks Were Good."

"I came along the hard way and

when I started for the championship

I was lucky. After the last war the

boom was on and every way you

looked at it the breaks were good.

I had the right men to fight, boxers

who were personalities in the game,

like Georges Carpentier, the French

man, and Luis Firpo, the big Argen

tinian (he was down seven times in

that first round), and behind us in

those great days was the genius of

Tex Rickard. He planned and put

on the first million-dollar gate.

"To up and coming young men I

would say, 'Live clean and work

hard.' But the hard way is the only

sure road to success. In my time it

was tougher. If you wanted to fight

then there were plenty of changes.

You could fight somewhere tonight

along the railroad, or at a mining

or timber camp, and if you were

licked who could know? You went

on and got another fight somewhere'

else. In those days you had to beat

all comers before you got a chance

for the championship. It was fight

ing all the time and many of us did

it to live and above all because we

loved the game."

The Famous Left Hook.

What about that famous left hook?

he was asked. Dempsey stood up to

show how it worked. He will be 50

in June and now weighs nearly 16st,

but as he dropped into his old fight

ing posture there was immediately

revealed the stance that by picture

and story has become familiar to

followers of boxing the world over.

Dempsey always stood in close and

was a hooker, and he showed how

he never "telegraphed" punches but

got in close and punched from where

his hands were and swung his big

shoulders behind the hooks. He had

terrific speed for a heavyweight and

a murderous punch, and they won

= him the title and kept it for him

Tuntil Tunney came along.

Dempsey showed a little more of

the old-time style and after a while

he sat down and said, "I reckon I

was at my peak the day I had my

shot at the championship, against

'Jess Willard at Toledo. I was then

about 12st 12Ib. It was 120 degrees

- that day, and the heat made the

resin go through the canvas and a

new canvas was put over the ring.

This new canvas covered up the

- bell and in the confusion of the first

round the referee did not hear the

bell Willard already had been

counted out and I had left the ring

and was gone two minutes before

being recalled. We then went into

the second round."

Willard was badly beaten and was

taken to hospital.

Federal Authority Needed.

Dempsey then dealt with what

- must be a favourite topic-a desire

to see the National Boxing Associa

tion in America given Federal powers

" to control boxing in all States. Much

the same authority is badly needed

" in Australia. "This would mean one

overall body would control and

recognise titles," he said. "decide on

length of bouts and on conditions

and rules. We could eliminate the

appearance of punch-drunk boxers

and cases of blindness-ases which

have given a good sport a bad name

at times.

"We also want to see a certain

percentage taken from the gates for

the erection of a home for old boxers

and athletes. The fund would pro

'vide them with amenities in their i

lold age and save them from selling;

pencils on the street. Many of the

old-timers thought too much of

fighting and forgot the money. Then

one day they woke up to find they,

i were 'has beens,' and had no money

or manager either."

Subiaco Boys' Club Programme.

Boys' Club will present another pro

gramme of boxing, when Cliff Gilmore.
