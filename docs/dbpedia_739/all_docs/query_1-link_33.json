        "text": "The Hon Michael Keenan MP\n\nMinister for Justice\n\nThe Hon Jack Dempsey MP\n\nMinister for Police, Fire and Emergency Services\n\nJOINT MEDIA RELEASE\n\nCommonwealth Minister for Justice Michael Keenan and Queensland Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Services Jack Dempsey today announced that disaster assistance has been activated for Brisbane City Council following the severe storm on 27 November 2014.\n\nMr Keenan said that the assistance was being provided through the jointly-funded Commonwealth-State Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA).\n\n“The Commonwealth and Queensland Governments are providing financial assistance to support the clean-up effort and to repair damage to public infrastructure,” Mr Keenan said.\n\nMr Dempsey said the storm caused widespread damage across the Brisbane local government area, requiring extensive clean-up operations by council and the State Emergency Services.\n\n“This storm was one of the worst in the Brisbane City area in decades, resulting in more than 2,900 requests for assistance to the SES, power being cut to residential areas, and flash flooding,” Mr Dempsey said.\n\n“The assistance we are announcing today will help Brisbane City Council with clean-up and recovery costs and provide funding to repair damage to essential public infrastructure.”\n\n“The Commonwealth and Queensland Governments are committed to working together to ensure that disaster affected communities can return to normal as quickly as possible,” Mr Keenan said.\n\nInformation regarding the assistance available can be found on the Queensland Government’s Disaster Management website at www.disaster.qld.gov.au and on the Australian Government’s Disaster Assist website at www.disasterassist.gov.au.\n\nThe $7 Medicare co-payment measure announced in the 2014-15 Budget will no longer proceed.\n\nThe Government will instead implement a package of measures that will strengthen Medicare and help make it sustainable, ensuring Australians will continue to have access to affordable, world-class health care.\n\nThe Government has listened to the views of the community.\n\nThis new package ensures the Government can make Medicare sustainable, improve the quality of care for patients and continue its repair of the Budget.\n\nThe Medicare rebate paid to doctors for some consultations will be reduced by $5 and the troublesome issue of ‘six minute medicine’ will be addressed by encouraging doctors to spend more time with patients.\n\nOptional co-payment and protection for patients\n\nA new optional co-payment will be introduced for GP services with additional protections for patients.\n\nThe Government will not impose a co-payment on GP services provided to pensioners, Commonwealth concession card holders, all children under the age of 16, veterans funded through the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, attendances at residential aged care facilities and pathology and diagnostic imaging services.\n\nIncentives paid to doctors to encourage them to bulk bill concession card holders and children under the age of 16 will also remain.\n\nMedicare rebates for common GP consultations will be reduced by $5 for non-concessional patients aged 16 and over from 1 July 2015.\n\nDoctors may choose to recoup the $5 rebate reduction through an optional co-payment or continue to bulk bill non-concessional patients over the age of 16.\n\nDoctors will be under no obligation to charge the co-payment and this decision will be entirely at their discretion.\n\nImproving patient outcomes by tackling ‘six minute medicine’\n\nIn a further move to streamline Medicare and improve quality outcomes, the Government will make changes to standard GP consultation items which currently provide the same Medicare rebate for a six minute consultation as for a 19 minute consultation.\n\nThis change will ensure that Medicare expenditure more accurately reflects the time a GP spends with a patient.\n\nIt encourages a shift away from ‘six minute medicine’ so that appropriate, comprehensive care is better rewarded over patient throughput.\n\nAdditionally Medicare fees for all services provided by GPs, medical specialists, allied health practitioners, optometrists and others will remain at their current level until July 2018.\n\nMaking Medicare Sustainable and the Medical Research Future Fund\n\nThe Government is committed to taking these prudent measures to protect Medicare.\n\nMedicare will not survive in the long term without changes to make it sustainable.\n\nIn the last decade spending on Medicare has more than doubled from $8 billion in 2004 to $20 billion today, yet we raise only $10 billion from the Medicare levy. Spending is projected to climb to $34 billion in the next decade to 2024.\n\nIn the last year alone, 275 million services were provided free to patients. That’s three out of every four Medicare services being bulk billed.\n\nThese changes will contribute more than $3 billion to the Medical Research Future Fund which will fund the research needed to find cures to the health problems of today.\n\nIn six years the returns from the MRFF will provide a billion dollars to be invested in medical research annually – doubling our national funding commitments to researchers.\n\nIn a big step towards Australian children being better protected against cyberbullying when they go online, the Enhancing Online Safety for Children Bill 2014 has been introduced in the Commonwealth Parliament, Federal Member for Bonner, Ross Vasta, said today.\n\n“Parents, schools, teachers and children in Bonner have given me extensive feedback about the harmful effects of cyberbullying, and the impact it can have on young people,” Mr Vasta said.\n\n“This bill will play a significant role in addressing the growing problem of cyberbullying, and will enhance online safety for children in our community.”\n\nThe Bill was introduced into Parliament by Paul Fletcher MP, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications.\n\n“This is about delivering on our election promise to enhance online safety for children,” said Mr Fletcher.\n\n“With research showing that one in five Australian children are the victims of cyber-bullying, this Bill brings powerful new tools to help keep children safe online.”\n\nThe Enhancing Online Safety for Children Bill 2014 includes a range of measures to combat cyberbullying and provide a safer online environment for children, including:\n\n· Establishing the office of the Children’s e-Safety Commissioner (theCommissioner) and setting out the Commissioner’s functions and powers;\n\n· Creating an effective complaints system for harmful cyberbullying material targeted at an Australian child, with the Commissioner given two sets of powers it can use in responding to a complaint:\n\no The power to issue a notice to a large social media service (social media service notice) requiring it to remove the material;\n\no The power to issue a notice to the person who posted the material (end-user notice) requiring the person to remove the material, refrain from posting the material or apologise for posting the material.\n\nThe measures in the Bill are designed to encourage large social media services to work cooperatively with the Commissioner under what is called ‘tier 1’.\n\nHowever, if a large social media service repeatedly fails to respond to a notice from the Commissioner, then it can be moved to ‘tier 2’, meaning that it has a legal duty to remove cyberbullying material if it receives a notice from the Commissioner, and faces substantial fines if it does not.\n\n“We have consulted very extensively – with schools, parents, kids from ages 5 to 17, social media services and other stakeholders – both in opposition and in government,” Ross Vasta said.\n\n“The message from the community is loud and clear – government must act to fight cyberbullying and help keep Aussie kids safer online.”\n\nThe Commissioner will take a national leadership role in children’s online safety initiatives across government to develop and implement policies to improve safety for children online. The Commissioner’s office will be established as an independent statutory office with in the Australian Communications and Media Authority.\n\nThe Commissioner will work closely with police and other government agencies, as well as the internet industry, child protection organisations, and parent and teacher associations.\n\nThe Commissioner will administer funding of $7.5 million for online safety programmes in schools and $0.1 million to support Australian-based research and information campaigns on online safety.\n\nWork has begun on the Queensland State Velodrome Project – one of the centrepieces for the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games.\n\nThe Member for Bonner Ross Vasta represented the Minister for Sport Peter Dutton at a sod turning ceremony for the project at Chandler in Brisbane today.\n\nThe Australian Government is providing $156 million funding for the Games including the velodrome project.\n\nMr Dutton said most of the Australian Government’s investment, which will see it partner with the Queensland Government, is for new and upgraded infrastructure that will remain permanent after the Games.\n\n“Such investment will ensure there is a lasting impact from the Australian Government’s contribution,” Mr Dutton said.\n\n“Building a legacy not just for south-east Queensland, but for the nation as a whole, means we are getting maximum value for taxpayers’ precious dollars,” Mr Vasta said.\n\n“Moreover, construction of the velodrome will create a large number of jobs, many of them local, while helping ensure Australia stages a truly world-class event.”\n\nThe $58 million velodrome will be located alongside the Brisbane Super Cross track at Sleeman Sports Complex and will provide a new centre of excellence for cycling in Queensland.\n\nAs Queensland’s first indoor velodrome, the world-class facility will attract elite training squads and competition events to further the development of cycling in Queensland and Australia.\n\nThe new velodrome will be more than just a track cycling facility. The in-field area will have the capacity to provide for a range of additional sport and recreation uses through mixed-use sports courts.\n\nThe velodrome is scheduled to be completed in mid-2016.\n\nFederal Member for Bonner, Ross Vasta, and the Small Business Minister Bruce Billson are preparing for the holiday season by shopping local.\n\nMr Vasta is committed to supporting small and local business across Bonner, and encourages everyone in the community to do the same.\n\n“Small businesses and family enterprise are the economic life blood of communities like ours and the Coalition wants to see them prosper,” Mr Vasta said.\n\n“Small businesses provide more than four million jobs across the country. Sadly, 519,000 jobs were lost in small business under the Labor government. We are focussed on arresting this decline and turning these numbers around.”\n\n“We need to encourage and nurture small business men and women because they are taking risks. They are providing employment opportunities for others with in our towns and cities.”\n\nMr Vasta said one of the best ways to ensure competition and the security of local small businesses is to support them at the till.\n\n“In the lead up to the busy Christmas period, it is important to visit our local strip shops and small businesses when thinking about your Christmas preparations and Christmas presents,” Mr Vasta said.\n\n“Get out and about amongst your local shopping strips, businesses and service providers. There is great value to be found, not just for your wallet, but also for the health and economic vitality of our community.”\n\nMr Vasta said that under the Coalition Government, small business had benefitted from the removal of the carbon tax, over $2 billion in red and green tape reductions, the $484.2 million Entrepreneurs’ Infrastructure Programme, and more.\n\nHe said the Government was committed to creating a Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, extending unfair contract protections for small business, and taking other measures to help small business thrive.\n\nENDS\n\nFederal Member for Bonner, Ross Vasta, chats with local small business owner Bill Gardik at B&G Jewellery in Mount Gravatt.\n\nThis coming week is the last sitting week of the Parliament for this year.\n\n2014 has been an important year for Australia.\n\nThe Government has put in place key parts of our Economic Action Strategy to build a strong and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia.\n\nOnly a stronger economy will generate more jobs, lift household living standards and give our country a better future.\n\n2014 has been a year of achievement that’s already benefiting families and small businesses.\n\nThe carbon tax is gone, saving the average household $550 a year.\n\nWe have delivered the biggest cut in electricity prices on record which is good news for everyone saving for Christmas.\n\nThe mining tax is gone so this vital sector can create more jobs.\n\nOur $50 billion infrastructure programme is underway. This includes major projects right around Australia to save you time and money.\n\nWe’re cutting red tape – with $2 billion in red tape savings already identified and we’re turbo charging trade with our neighbours by delivering Free Trade Agreements with Japan, Korea and China. This means more exports, more jobs and lower prices for families. And we’re working with Australian businesses to ensure we’re taking advantage of these new opportunities.\n\nWe took on the responsibility for fixing Labor’s Budget mess and we are getting spending under control.\n\nWe’ve also passed our Direct Action plan which will make a practical difference to the environment – without slugging you with a carbon tax.\n\nThe Green Army has been established and is already restoring degraded bush and cleaning up polluted waterways.\n\nMajor projects worth $1 trillion have been given environmental approval – which will provide many of the jobs of tomorrow.\n\nThe NBN is being rolled out – in a way which is fast, more affordable, and less costly to taxpayers.\n\nAnd we’ve kept Australia safe.\n\nWe’ve all but stopped the boats which many claimed was impossible.\n\nWe’ve responded to the threat of extremism with new counter-terrorism measures because our duty is to do everything we humanly can to keep you safe.\n\nWe all have reason to be confident in 2015 – confidence based in policies that will encourage jobs, help families and build a better Australia.\n\nThe Bonner veteran community is set to benefit from funding through the latest round of the Veteran and Community Grants program, Federal Member for Bonner, Ross Vasta, today announced.\n\nThe grant for $49,951 will help Manly Lota RSL assist the local veteran community to continue improving services and support for veterans and their families.\n\n“Manly Lota RSL are a vital part of the veteran and defence community in Bonner, and this funding will help them upgrade their existing toilet facilities, as well as construct a wheelchair ramp,” Mr Vasta said.\n\n“This announcement is welcome news for all in our community and particularly those who have so freely given their time and efforts to the work of Manly Lota RSL.”\n\nEx-service and community organisations, veteran groups and private organisations that contribute to the health and welfare of the veteran community are all eligible to apply for funding through the Veteran and Community Grants program.\n\n“I congratulate Manly Lota RSL on its successful application for this grant,” Mr Vasta said.\n\n“This grant and others made to organisations around the country recognise the community’s appreciation of those who served.”\n\n“The dedication and hard work of organisations such as Manly Lota RSL ensure veterans and their families receive services, support and opportunities in their local communities.”\n\n“Manly Lota RSL is now able to upgrade their facilities to the benefit of their members, and I look forward to seeing the project’s completion.”\n\nFor more information about the Veteran and Community Grants program, visit www.dva.gov.au/grants or contact your nearest Department of Veterans’ Affairs office on 133 254 or 1800 555 254 from regional Australia.\n\nENDS\n\nChristmas is fast approaching and with more than 2,200 Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel deployed overseas on operations, Australians are being asked to spare a thought for our troops who won’t be able to spend Christmas with their families and friends.\n\nFederal Member for Bonner, Ross Vasta, said the best and most effective way to show support is to send an email message to the troops at supportthetroops@defence.gov.au, or a postcard to:\n\nMessages to the Troops\n\nMedia Section\n\n39 Personnel Support Battalion\n\nBuilding 217\n\nRandwick Barracks NSW 2031\n\n“Messages are always appreciated by ADF personnel, and sending a message that simply says ‘thank you for your service’ can have a tremendous positive impact,” Mr Vasta said.\n\n“This year I am also asking the community to consider donating to ex-service organisations such as the RSL, Legacy and Soldier On in recognition of the increasing numbers of recently returned veterans.”\n\n“These organisations provide phenomenal support to our ADF personnel, past and present, and their families, and I strongly encourage residents in Bonner looking to make a difference in the lives of ADF personnel and veterans to consider donating to one of these excellent organisations.”\n\nDonations can be made to Legacy or Soldier On to support personnel who have been wounded on operations and family members who are suffering financially and socially from the death of a loved one.\n\nFor those still wishing to send a care package, the Australian Forces Post Office box address will be open from 3 November until 8 December 2014.\n\nAn Australian Defence Member\n\nAFPO 60\n\nAustralian Defence Force NSW 2890\n\nAll items must be submitted to an Australia Post outlet by the cut-off date of 8 December 2014.\n\nMr Vasta said those who wish to send a care package but are short on time may like to consider donating money to the RSL’s Australian Forces Overseas Fund.\n\n“The RSL provides care packages to Australian troops as well as Australian Federal Police personnel biannually, and your support would contribute to this valuable programme,” Mr Vasta said.\n\n“This Christmas I urge all Australians to again dig deep and support our serving men and women and their families whose sacrifices ensure our safety and security.”\n\nWhat can be included in care packages\n\nBe creative with donations while being mindful of Australia Post’s guidelines for the free delivery of care packages. Some suggestions are listed below, as are the general restrictions. It is recommended that any donated goods collected by EOs, and which are unable to be sent due to size or weight, be donated to local charities.\n\nFood\n\n– Anzac biscuits\n\n– Salted peanuts\n\n– Muesli bars\n\n– Instant noodles\n\n– Lollies\n\n– Small tinned consumables\n\n– Other commercially manufactured and packaged foods that are non-perishable\n\nOther ideas\n\n– Magazines\n\n– Puzzle books\n\n– DVDs\n\n– Socks\n\n– Letters of support\n\n– Posters and letters from school children\n\n– Stamped, self-addressed envelope – this way personnel can thank you for the package\n\nToiletries\n\n– Deodorant (non-aerosol)\n\n– Shaving cream (non-aerosol)\n\n– Small bottle of talcum powder\n\n– Disposable razors\n\n– Shower Gel\n\n– Lip Balm\n\nWhat not to include\n\n– Pornographic material\n\n– Alcoholic beverages\n\n– Any food prepared or cooked at home, including cakes and biscuits\n\n– Clothing (except socks)\n\n– Pork products\n\n– Cigarettes\n\n– Perfumery products\n\nHow to donate to the RSL Australian Forces Overseas Fund\n\nThe RSL’s Australian Forces Overseas Fund enables the RSL to send biannual care packages to ADF members as well as Australian Federal Police personnel serving overseas. This is a great way to donate as the RSL is well equipped to provide care packages that troops not only want, but are also culturally sensitive and do not contain perishable or illegal material.\n\nMore information about the RSL’s Australian Forces Overseas Fund can be found by going to www.rsl.org.au – then click on the “Supporting ADF Personnel” link and then on the “RSL Australian Forces Overseas Fund” link.

Donations over $2 are tax deductable and every donation is individually acknowledged by the RSL.\n\nG20 PLAN EXCEEDS 2 PER CENT GROWTH TARGET AS LEADERS COMMIT TO EXTRA ECONOMIC REFORMS\n\nThe combined growth strategies of G20 member nations presented at the Brisbane Leaders’ Summit will equate to 2.1 per cent new growth and inject an additional $2 trillion into the world economy and create millions of jobs.\n\nThe Brisbane Action Plan contains close to 1,000 measures, including more than 800 new ones, which the IMF and OECD estimate will boost the collective GDP of G20 nations by 2.1 per cent by 2018.\n\nThis is new growth, over and above business as usual trends.\n\nEarly in Australia’s G20 Presidency we set an ambitious target of getting all countries to commit to measures that would deliver at least 2 per cent additional GDP over five years.\n\nThe benefits of that growth will be felt worldwide, not just in G20 member nations.\n\nIndividual country actions range from employment measures to infrastructure investment, as well as actions to expand trade, increase competition and reduce the regulatory burden on business.\n\nThe Brisbane Action Plan and individual country growth strategies and employment plans have been made public so people around the world can see our commitments, hold us to account and witness our progress.\n\nIn addition, leaders committed to close the gender gap in labour force participation by 25 per cent by 2025. If successful, this will bring more than 100 million women into the global labour force, further increase global growth, deliver financial independence to millions and help reduce poverty and inequality.\n\nLeaders also agreed to a Global Infrastructure Initiative that will help address the $70 trillion gap in infrastructure needed by 2030 to improve productivity and living standards.\n\nGovernments cannot afford to foot this bill on their own.\n\nNew sources of investment must be found.\n\nA Global Infrastructure Hub headquartered in Sydney, will drive the G20’s work on infrastructure by bringing together governments, the private sector, multinational development banks and other international organisations.\n\nG20 and non-G20 countries will make use of the Hub’s data, information, ideas and networks to help lift infrastructure investment globally.\n\nG20 members also agreed to tackle base erosion and profit shifting and to share tax information by endorsing a new standard on the exchange of information between tax authorities.\n\nThis will make sure that big business pays tax in the same place it earns its profits. It will help secure our revenue bases and restore integrity and fairness to the global tax system.\n\nFree trade is good for all of us. It drives growth and creates jobs.\n\nLeaders have put on the table domestic reforms to make it easier to trade.\n\nWe agreed on the importance of good quality trade agreements to make our economies more competitive and we began a discussion about how the World Trade Organization could work better to deliver the growth we need.\n\nAustralia has pushed hard for G20 leaders to focus on the importance of energy to economic development, particularly for developing economies.\n\nIt is critical that global institutions reflect the changing nature of the global energy markets and leaders have agreed the G20 Principles on Energy Collaboration. These will be an important foundation for the G20’s ongoing efforts.\n\nG20 leaders support strong and effective action to address climate change.\n\nConsistent with the UNFCCC, our actions will support sustainable development, economic growth and certainty for business and investment.\n\nLeaders also endorsed significant measures which will help strengthen the global financial system. These measures will help ensure the circumstances which led to the global financial crisis do not occur again.\n\nBanks are now better capitalised, derivative markets are safer and work has progressed to better protect taxpayers if large banks fail. We have reduced risks in the shadow banking sector.\n\nOur focus now is to get on with the job of implementing our commitments while remaining alert to new and emerging risks.\n\nWe have also made progress on anti-corruption, energy and sustainability, development and reform of international economic institutions.\n\nLeaders also expressed deep concern about humanitarian and economic impact of the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\nWe support the international response and have committed to do all we can to contain and respond to the crisis.\n\nI thank my fellow G20 leaders for their support and willingness to prioritise reforms that underpin economic growth and job creation.\n\nFederal Member for Bonner, Ross Vasta, today encouraged young people in the community to nominate for the 2015 National Youth Awards.\n\n“This is the third annual series of the Awards, which celebrate the achievements and contributions of young Australians aged 12 to 25,” Mr Vasta said.\n\n“I urge those thinking about nominating to act now.”\n\nMr Vasta said it was important to celebrate the achievements of young people who are making a lasting, positive difference in their communities.\n\n“Young Australians are doing this every day by volunteering in their local communities, and they deserve to be recognised for the valuable contribution they are making to their local communities,” Mr Vasta said.\n\n“If you know a remarkable young Australian, I strongly encourage you to get involved by logging onto the National Youth Week website and nominating them.”\n\nThere are seven Award categories, six of which recognise individuals, and a media award that celebrates positive news reporting about young people in Australia.\n\nThe Award categories are:\n\n– Youth Safety Award;\n\n– Youth Courage Award;\n\n– Youth Culture and Diversity Award;\n\n– Youth Employment Award;\n\n– Youth Health Award;\n\n– Youth Leadership Award; and\n\n– Youth in Media Award.\n\nEach of the six individual category winners will receive $2,000, a trophy, and a certificate, while the winner of the Youth in Media Award will receive a trophy and certificate.\n\nThe Awards are for young people aged 12 to 25 (with the exception of the Youth in Media Award) and applicants can be self-nominated or nominated by someone else.\n\nApplications for the 2015 National Youth Awards close on Thursday, 27 November 2014.\n\nMore information on the National Youth Awards, including entry forms and details of past winners and finalists, is available at www.youthweek.com/nya.\n\nENDS"
