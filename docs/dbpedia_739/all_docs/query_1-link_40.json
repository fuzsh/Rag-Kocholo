        "text": "The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has finalised election funding payments to political parties and candidates for the 2022 federal election.\n\nParties and candidates who received at least 4 per cent of the formal first preference vote at the 2022 federal election received an automatic payment of election funding of $10,656. This initial payment amount was provided pursuant to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and is an indexed figure.\n\nTo receive election funding greater than the automatic payment, agents of eligible political parties and candidates were required to lodge a claim with the AEC setting out electoral expenditure incurred. For the 2022 federal election, the period for lodging a claim for election funding was 10 June 2022 to 20 November 2022.\n\nThe determinations for claims for election funding are published on the Transparency Register.\n\nTotal election funding paid by the AEC in relation to the 2022 federal election was $75,876,944.42. This amount includes $713,952 in automatic payments and $75,162,992.42 in claims accepted.\n\nEditor’s notes:\n\nInformation about the model for election funding payments is available at https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/public_funding/index.htm.\n\nA summary of election funding payments for the 2019 federal election is available at https://www.aec.gov.au/media/media-releases/2019/12-12.htm.\n\nElection funding payment summary â 2022 federal election\n\nTotal election funding paid by the AEC in relation to the 2022 federal election was $75,876,944.42; $73,984,748.25 of which was paid to political parties and $1,892,196.17 to independent candidates.
