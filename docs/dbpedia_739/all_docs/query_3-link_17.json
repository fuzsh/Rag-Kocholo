        "text": "Sometimes campaigns just hit at the perfect timing. With Kith bringing in Wesley Snipes as he shot back into public consciousness through 'Deadpool & Wolverine'. Throwing over a wave of nostalgia onto the campaign with someone who has starred in too many cult classics to mention. Connecting to the memories of people who have their favourite Wesley Snipes film (it's hard to choose, but 'White Men Can't Jump'). The storyline within the content then speaks to the fact we rarely see him anymore, but the public wants him. Brilliant timing and, as always with Kith content, it’s beautifully made and a weird celebrity choice to some, feels like an authentic connection to Kith. Do you have a favourite Wesley Snipes film?\n\nWhat sparks your imagination? Yinka Ilori has given Piccadilly Circus a bold new makeover! 'Good Things Come to Those Who Wait,' is adding a lot of bright orange and yellow colours to London until August 25th. The two Pegasuses that sit on top of the installation, mark the first time new sculptures have entered the space in 132 years. To further the experience, at lunchtimes, specially created colouring sheets will be given out to help ignite that spark of creativity. While Young Ambassadors from the Greater London Authority's youth programme are on hand to share insights on West End’s hidden gems. The work has been designed to encourage people throughout London to believe in their ability to make the impossible possible. This bold new Yinka Ilori artwork, symbolising the power of imagination. So, what sparks your imagination?\n\nCan a brand 'own' a day on the calendar? 818 Tequila has been trying to 'own' August 18th—written as '8.18' in the US. This year, they collaborated with venues in Los Angeles, Miami, and London to deliver pop-up Classic Cocktail Lounges. Each pop-up was themed around the current 818 ‘classics’ campaign, giving traditional cocktails an 818 tequila twist. Each venue was decked out with eye-catching branding, stunning floral arrangements, Instagram-worthy photo ops, and of course, 818 cocktails. To top it off, they dropped a limited edition merchandise collection celebrating the classics and the buzz around the experiences was real. RSVPs for these events sold out in seconds (I know, I tried!) and when “8.18” came on Sunday, the 818 community showed up and made the day a success. Here are a few reasons why brands owning a day can work; 📆 Novelty - Introduce something fresh that energises your brand’s community. 📆 Seasonless - Unbound by peak dates, create excitement when you want. 📆 Less Noise - Avoiding the noise of peak calendar days, helps to stand out. 📆 Consistency - A recurring brand moment your audience can look forward to. Brands like Dunkin’, Nike, Hendrick’s, Oreo, and now 818 have tried 'own' a day. Do you think more brands could ‘own’ a day?\n\nIs your brand experience sweating the small stuff? Beach takeovers have been all the rage the past few summers - it makes sense: 🏖️ We're There - In winter, it's ski resorts; in summer, it's beaches like Ibiza. Brands connect with customers where they love to be. 🌟 Living the Life - Luxury brands embody lifestyle, not just products. Beaches reinforce this image, aligning with leisure, travel, and exclusivity. 📸 Holiday Photos - Did the holiday happen if it’s not on Instagram? Brands tap into this share-ready audience, making social buzz effortless. 🤝 Partnerships - When luxury resorts and brands connect, they create a perfect summer synergy, boosting awareness and elevating experiences. 👗 Care-Free Fashion - On holiday, people take more risks—including with fashion. It's the perfect time for brands to showcase bold styles. But with so many luxury brands at the beach, how can one stand out? What stood out for me on the Off-White™ takeover of Jondal were all the smaller details: 🔹 \"SWITCH OFF\" on sun loungers—perfectly positioned for those sea photos. 🎾 Playful touches, like ping pong, boules, and the “DON’T DO IT” on matches. 🛋️ Detailed, yet smaller logos on cushions, towels, parasols and throughout. ❌ Larger \"X\" and chevron patterns on the loungers, seating, and cushions. 🛍️ Exclusive capsule collection, only available at the Jondal boutique. All these small touches come together to create a standout takeover. So maybe we should be sweating the small stuff.\n\nCan embracing solitude help us to be more creative? I was reading Wallpaper* magazine in an office reception, waiting for a meeting. When I saw this incredibly designed off-grid experience from the brand Folly. Designed by Malek Alqadi, the space blends into the Mojave National Preserve. Meaning, it’s in the middle of nowhere and the WIFI signal is probably not great. But what could you gain from spending some time in an experience like this; 👀 Focus - Reduced distractions, let you dive deeper into your creative ideas. 🗣️ Less Peer Pressure - Explore unique ideas without judgment, sparking more original thinking. 🧘🏾♂️ Self-Awareness - Understand your thoughts and feelings, deepening your connection to creativity and authentic expression. ⏳ Time Away - Stepping away from a problem allows your subconscious to work on it, which can lead to creative breakthroughs. 💆🏾♂️ Refresh - Recharge mentally, helping you be ready for creative thinking. But, I'm not sure solitude is for every creative person - I find I feel more creative in busy cities like NYC, Paris or London. Though I have often done creative work alone - it’s never been in the middle of nowhere, with no busy high streets or WIFI. Perhaps I should try embracing solitude, and see if I feel more creative. This Folly experience does look like the perfect place to try that out. How about you? Are you more creative around people or in solitude?\n\nSocial talent or consumers? When planning a brand experience, do you need to pick between them? With the Premier League season days away, let’s revisit Nobody's Café’s work with trivago, showing why blending social talent and consumers is key. For three seasons, we elevated trivago’s Chelsea FC sponsorship with unforgettable experiences in the UK and US. From hospitality suites to pitch events, we engaged fans, social talent, and competition winners, amplifying the brand and connecting with consumers. The highlight? A pitch event at Stamford Bridge where global consumers and local talent united for a football tournament. It was a huge success, proving that bringing everyone together works. Here’s why; ⚽️ Authentic Connection - trivago showed they care about everyone, bringing everyone together for a shared experience that connected them to the brand. ⚽️ Balance - With Chelsea legends picking teams at random, everyone was treated equally—no \"social talent vs. consumers\" divide, just teammates. ⚽️ Amplification - We engaged consumers without sacrificing metrics, achieving over half a million organic and unpaid social reach.. ⚽️ Content Creation - Having social talent and consumers together resulted in diverse and engaging content for social media. While consumers felt more inspired and motivated to create content. ⚽️ Community - trivago built an authentic community where participants still connect online, making consumers feel included, not just sold to. ⚽️ Unforgettable - Experience is everything and years later, we still hear from people about the lasting impact of the experience that was created. Social talent only brand experiences run the risk of excluding the exact people the campaign is designed to influence - the consumer. Allowing consumers to be part of the experience, allows everyone to be part of the brand without sacrificing brand goals and social reach. Instead, it makes the influence of the brand experience even stronger. What do you think? Do we need to pick between social talent and consumers?\n\nNobody's Café is looking for talented experiential and events freelancers.
