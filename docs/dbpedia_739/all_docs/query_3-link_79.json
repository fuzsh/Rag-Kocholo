Dempsey was first elected to the Missouri State Senate in 2007, where he quickly rose to the rank of Majority Floor Leader before being unanimously elected by his colleagues to serve as the Senate President Pro-Tem in 2013. He previously served seven years in the Missouri House of Representatives (2001-2007), where he also held key leadership posts as Majority Leader and Chairman of the Job Creation and Economic Development Committee.\n\n​\n\nThroughout his career, Dempsey has been known for his pragmatic, common sense leadership, and getting results. He is the only person to have served as the Majority Leader in both the Missouri Senate and House of Representatives. During his tenure as Senate President Pro Tempore, the General Assembly adopted the first tax cut in 100 years, addressed the insolvency of the Worker’s Compensation Second Injury Fund, supported a major bonding bill to invest in higher education and workforce development, and handled the largest rewrite of the criminal code in 30 years. The Legislature also passed an initiative to increase transportation funding, two significant education reform bills to spur student achievement, and a successful special session to attract a major economic development opportunity for the Aerospace Industry in St. Louis.\n\nBorn in St. Charles, MO, Dempsey is a graduate of DeSmet Jesuit High School and received a B.A. degree in Political Science from Rockhurst University. Dempsey and his wife, Molly, reside in St. Charles; they are the parents of three children, Meaghan, Abby and Jack."
