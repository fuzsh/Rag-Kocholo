        "text": "JACK DEMPSEY\n\nVISITS PERTHI\n\nFORMER WORLD CHAMPION\n\nThe Future of the Ring.\n\nIf one listens to Jack Dempsey\n\n(now Commander, US Coast Guard),\n\nhe is quickly convinced that the\n\nformer heavyweight champion of\n\nthe world, and one of the greatest\n\nsporting figures of the century, is\n\nsincerely in love with Australia and\n\nwould gladly make it his home.\n\nDempsey arrived in Perth on Satur\n\nday night to visit USN personnel in\n\nthis area, and is staying at the Weld\n\nClub.\n\n\"Australia is new and a man's\n\ncountry,\" he said yesterday. \"It\n\nappeals as a country of romance and\n\nfor its newness. It reminds me of\n\nmy home State of Colorado, and if\n\nI were a young man I would return\n\nhere. It's the place in which to\n\nmake a start.\"\n\nDempsey then talked of the warI\n\n(he has -been at Okinawa and has\n\ntravelled 21,000 miles by air in the\n\nlast few weeks in the Pacific), and\n\nthen of sport. Were there any more\n\nPhar Laps about? What prices were\n\nhorses bringing? Still, he thought\n\nthe temporary wartime ban on rac\n\ning in America was a good thing.\n\nProbably it would be removed im\n\nmediately the European war ended.\n\nComparisons with the Past.\n\nThe future of boxing? Would it\n\nboom again as it did after the last\n\nwar? The former champion was\n\nnow on familiar ground, and when\n\nhe talked of the future he drew\n\nlargely on the comparisons provided\n\nby his own past. \"It will take some\n\ntime in America before we get boxing\n\nback on its feet after the war,\" he\n\nsaid. \"I have a club of my own at\n\nhome and these clubs produce many\n\ngood fighters. Then, when you get\n\nthe right boys they must be matched\n\nwell and brought along gradually.\n\nThey can't be champions in five\n\nminutes. Experience is what they\n\nmust have. Experience in actual\n\nfghts, in the ring, is the thing. Bad\n\nexperience only comes from those\n\nwho don't know what they are doing.\n\n\"I had a lot of great fighters to\n\nlearn from, and a number of great\n\ntrainers. I had the gloves on with\n\nSam Langford, James J. Corbett,\n\nJames J. Jeffries, Young Peter Jack\n\nson, Griffo, the elusive Australian,\n\nand others. Griffo would stand on\n\na handkerchief and give you 25 dol\n\nlars if you could hit him. You had\n\nto be fast.\n\n\"Then there were trainers like\n\nJimmy de Forrest, and in those days\n\nwe had to work hard. We did seven\n\nor eight miles on the road every\n\nmorning and when we got into the\n\nring to train we didn't spare the\n\npartners. We always hit to hurt i\n\nthe work-outs and were in earnest.\n\nThere were plenty of actual fights'\n\ntoo, and it made us tough. It was!\n\nimportant having good men to work\n\nout with. Good partners make good\n\nboxers. You can always tell how\n\ngood a boxer Is by the men he has\n\nin the gymnasium to work with. If\n\nhe's good he will have good partners,\n\nand if he is no good hell have no\n\nbodies round him.\n\n\"The Breaks Were Good.\"\n\n\"I came along the hard way and\n\nwhen I started for the championship\n\nI was lucky. After the last war the\n\nboom was on and every way you\n\nlooked at it the breaks were good.\n\nI had the right men to fight, boxers\n\nwho were personalities in the game,\n\nlike Georges Carpentier, the French\n\nman, and Luis Firpo, the big Argen\n\ntinian (he was down seven times in\n\nthat first round), and behind us in\n\nthose great days was the genius of\n\nTex Rickard. He planned and put\n\non the first million-dollar gate.\n\n\"To up and coming young men I\n\nwould say, 'Live clean and work\n\nhard.' But the hard way is the only\n\nsure road to success. In my time it\n\nwas tougher. If you wanted to fight\n\nthen there were plenty of changes.\n\nYou could fight somewhere tonight\n\nalong the railroad, or at a mining\n\nor timber camp, and if you were\n\nlicked who could know? You went\n\non and got another fight somewhere'\n\nelse. In those days you had to beat\n\nall comers before you got a chance\n\nfor the championship. It was fight\n\ning all the time and many of us did\n\nit to live and above all because we\n\nloved the game.\"\n\nThe Famous Left Hook.\n\nWhat about that famous left hook?\n\nhe was asked. Dempsey stood up to\n\nshow how it worked. He will be 50\n\nin June and now weighs nearly 16st,\n\nbut as he dropped into his old fight\n\ning posture there was immediately\n\nrevealed the stance that by picture\n\nand story has become familiar to\n\nfollowers of boxing the world over.\n\nDempsey always stood in close and\n\nwas a hooker, and he showed how\n\nhe never \"telegraphed\" punches but\n\ngot in close and punched from where\n\nhis hands were and swung his big\n\nshoulders behind the hooks. He had\n\nterrific speed for a heavyweight and\n\na murderous punch, and they won\n\n= him the title and kept it for him\n\nTuntil Tunney came along.\n\nDempsey showed a little more of\n\nthe old-time style and after a while\n\nhe sat down and said, \"I reckon I\n\nwas at my peak the day I had my\n\nshot at the championship, against\n\n'Jess Willard at Toledo. I was then\n\nabout 12st 12Ib. It was 120 degrees\n\n- that day, and the heat made the\n\nresin go through the canvas and a\n\nnew canvas was put over the ring.\n\nThis new canvas covered up the\n\n- bell and in the confusion of the first\n\nround the referee did not hear the\n\nbell Willard already had been\n\ncounted out and I had left the ring\n\nand was gone two minutes before\n\nbeing recalled. We then went into\n\nthe second round.\"\n\nWillard was badly beaten and was\n\ntaken to hospital.\n\nFederal Authority Needed.\n\nDempsey then dealt with what\n\n- must be a favourite topic-a desire\n\nto see the National Boxing Associa\n\ntion in America given Federal powers\n\n\" to control boxing in all States. Much\n\nthe same authority is badly needed\n\n\" in Australia. \"This would mean one\n\noverall body would control and\n\nrecognise titles,\" he said. \"decide on\n\nlength of bouts and on conditions\n\nand rules. We could eliminate the\n\nappearance of punch-drunk boxers\n\nand cases of blindness-ases which\n\nhave given a good sport a bad name\n\nat times.\n\n\"We also want to see a certain\n\npercentage taken from the gates for\n\nthe erection of a home for old boxers\n\nand athletes. The fund would pro\n\n'vide them with amenities in their i\n\nlold age and save them from selling;\n\npencils on the street. Many of the\n\nold-timers thought too much of\n\nfighting and forgot the money. Then\n\none day they woke up to find they,\n\ni were 'has beens,' and had no money\n\nor manager either.\"\n\nSubiaco Boys' Club Programme.\n\nNext Friday night the Sublaco Police\n\nBoys' Club will present another pro\n\ngramme of boxing, when Cliff Gilmore.\n\nwho has been fighting well. will meet\n\nJack Garside over 10 rounds. These\n\ntwo lads are among the leading light\n\nweights and should put up a good fight.l\n\nReg Layton. ex-heavyweight champion\n\nof WA. who is here on leave and will\n\nbe remembered for his fights with Gor\n\nSdon McCauley and Don Luff, has ex\n\npressed his intention of competing. Lar-is\n\nIton has been matched with Bill Harris\n\nI (Royal Navy) in a bout of 8 rounds. The\n\nproceeds of his bout will be donated to\n\nthe Sublaco Police Boys' Club. which\n\nwas his training quarters before going\n\nto the east.\n\nSome attractive preliminaries have\n\nbeen arranged. Bookings are at San\n\ndovera."
