        "text": "\"I'm the man who beat the man who beat the man, the true linear champion of the world. That in itself is a bigger title than any of those other titles. To be the real heavyweight champion, you have to beat me.\" - Lennox Lewis. The Desert Sun (2003) April 25, 2003.\n\nWhen one the finest heavyweight champions of all-time, a Hall of Famer who won all the major titles of his era, and defeated every man he ever faced, makes a statement such as this about the prestige associated with being the “true linear champion,” it would be foolish to dismiss it.\n\nThe word “lineal” or “linear” is a relatively modern description, necessary to differentiate the traditional championship from the dizzying array of sanctioning body belts. If the “lineal” word irritates you, forget it, and simply call the Lineal Champion “the real heavyweight champion,” or the “true” champion, as Lennox Lewis did.\n\nRather than skipping over key moments in history in which the Lineal Championship became vacant, this article instead, puts extra emphasis on these periods, and provides quotes and references, hopefully giving a little more context as to how the vacancies were filled.\n\nBut where did it all start, and who was the first champion?\n\nThe man usually credited with being the first gloved heavyweight champion of the gloved era, is John L. Sullivan, but the precise point at which he won this honour and the length of his reign, is debatable.\n\nBorn in Boston on February 2, 1858, Sullivan grew to be a solid 200lbs, inheriting his strength from his powerful Irish immigrant mother. Sullivan developed a thirst for fighting, claiming that as a teenager he would walk into barrooms offering to “lick any man in the house.” In 1882 the 5'‘10\" 24-year old “Boston Strong Boy” overpowered and battered champion, Paddy Ryan, to a 9th round defeat to win the American bareknuckle heavyweight title, and rapidly shot to world-wide fame, touring America and fighting in Ireland, France and Great Britain, becoming one of the highest paid sporting stars of his generation. He was an American hero, but perhaps not to everyone. His racist views meant he drew “the color line,” refusing to fight black challengers, so talented pugilists such as Peter Jackson never got to test their skills against him, and when talks turned to a potential matchup with Jake Kilirain, Sullivan’s heavy drinking and undisciplined lifestyle had left him drastically overweight. Remarkably, however, with the help of his friend, William Muldoon, he regained fine fighting form to KO Kilrain in what was possibly the most famous ever bare-knuckle battle.\n\nSullivan helped bring attention to gloved boxing under Queensbury rules, and during his 1880s tour of America he frequently made headlines when offering hundreds of dollars to any man who could stay on his feet for four rounds in a gloved exhibition with him.\n\nOn August 29, 1885, Sullivan defeated American, Dominick McCaffrey, via a 7-round decision in a gloved contest under Marquis of Queensberry Rules. In recent years this bout has gained much support as being the first contest for the heavyweight championship using gloves and under the new rules (9) (10), although this is not how the boxing journalists of the 1880s - 1890s, and respected boxing historians of the early-mid 20th century viewed matters.\n\nThe Weekly Atchison Champion (7) referred to the fight as a \"sparring match,\" and stated: \"There were not wanting persons who described the exhibition a poor one.\"\n\nIn most newspapers that reported on the fight, there was no mention that the bout had been contested for \"The Heavyweight Championship,\" or for any title (1) (4) (5) (6) (7).\n\nWhen writing about John L. Sullivan in 1920, in his book (3) entitled \"Famous Fights and Fighters,\" historian, Charles Platt, described various significant gloved fights that Sullivan had fought in - bouts with Charlie Mitchell (which took place two years before the McCaffrey bout), Tug Wilson, George Robinson, and Patsy Cardiff were included, but there was not a word written about the McCaffrey fight. The Ring Magazine co-founder, Nat Fleischer, writing in 1963 (2), had a comparable account to Platt's of Sullivan's gloved contests, similarly, with no mention of the McCaffrey bout. Both historians agreed that Sullivan/Corbett in 1892 was the first fight under Queensberry rules for the Heavyweight Championship of the World, although both also recognised Sullivan as the reigning champion heading into the fight, as did all journalists from the era, and during the early 20th century (13) (14) (15).\n\nThe consensus was that Sullivan's championship reign stretched from 1882 - 1892, with Corbett's reign beginning in 1892, after he had defeated Sullivan, indicating that Sullivan won the championship with bare knuckles by beating Paddy Ryan in 1882, and lost it wearing gloves, under the Marquis of Queensberry Rules in 1892 (11) (12).\n\nA statement in The Weekly Atchison Champion (7) on August 30, 1885, when reporting on the Sullivan-McCaffrey bout, is worth noting:\n\n\"When the referee took his place today, he did not ask for the agreement, nor did anyone produce it. The official merely stated that it was for a six-round contest for the championship of the world.\"\n\nA prominent advertisement, running on top of a page in the Cincinnati Enquirer on August 23, 1885 also stated that Sullivan/McCaffrey was a “world championship fight,” but aside from a largely unreported referee statement and this newspaper advert, there is little else to support the opinion that it was the inaugural fight of the gloved championship.\n\nIn the 21st century, suggesting that Sullivan's gloved championship reign started in 1882 (after a bare-knuckle bout) seems peculiar, but using the 1885 McCaffrey fight (which was generally viewed at the time as an exhibition, and didn’t have a consensus as a championship bout among the press), as a starting point, seems inappropriate too. Despite all this, even if the exact beginning of his gloved reign is vague, most people are in agreement, at least, that he was the defending champion when facing Corbett.\n\n1892 – 1904. Corbett dethroned the great John L. Sullivan on September 7, 1892, boxing beautifully before a crowd of 10,000 at the Olympic Club in New Orleans. A bleeding, battered Sullivan, was finally KO’d with a left-right in round 21, which left him flat on his face and chest.\n\nAfter an alleged 1894 retirement by Corbett, Irish Heavyweight titlist, Peter Maher, claimed to be the new champion when he defeated Steve O'Donnell in 1895. Bob Fitzsimmons KO'd Maher in one round in 1896, and then immediately challenged the Lineal Champion, Corbett, beating him on March 17, 1897, in a fight that is considered the day the true championship changed hands. Corbett had Fitzsimmons down in the sixth, and appeared to be in control of the fight until a potent punch to the stomach in round 14 crumpled him to the canvas.\n\n“The Boilermaker,” James J. Jeffries finished the century as the reigning champion, when, after a terrific battle, he knocked out “Ruby Bob,” in round 11 of their June 9, 1899, bout. Jeffries’ first defence was a 25-round points win over Tom Sharkey, and then, at a career heaviest 240lbs, the 6’1 powerhouse began 1900 with a 55-second KO of John Finnegan – a victory that is still the quickest heavyweight world championship KO of all-time, ABC organisations included. He reigned supreme, winning his final defence, a 2nd round KO of Jack Munroe in August 1904.\n\n1905. In May Jeffries announced his retirement from the ring, making the heavyweight championship vacant (16) (17) (18) (19).\n\nJeffries made the following statement (16) to the Times Star newspaper on May 2, 1905:\n\n\"I may possibly take a trip to Europe with my wife, after which I am going into the mining business with my brother, Jack, and hereafter devote my time to it. The principal reason for my retiring from the ring and from the stage is that my wife objects. That has been the controlling influence in my reaching this determination. I have decided to quit fighting for all time. The last fight I had in San Francisco was fairly well patronized, and although I won the big end of the purse there was but little in it for me. I have determined along with my wife that it is not worthwhile to go into the ring any more. The public is fickle. I am well provided with this world's goods, and I am done with it all. Billy Delaney is also well fixed and he will also retire from the business with me. When my engagement ends in Chicago one week from next Monday (May 15), I shall make my bow as a public character and shall never again go either on the stage or into the prizering.\"\n\nJeffries stated that he would leave the stage on May 5 and that arrangements had been made to cancel all engagements after that date. The paper reported that \"One week from next Monday (May 15), in Chicago, is the time set by him today for his permanent retirement.\" (16)\n\n1905. Marvin Hart knocked out Jack Root in the 12th round of their contest on July 3, 1905, to fill the championship vacancy.\n\nOn May 7, 1905, several days after Jeffries' retirement statement, journalist, W. W. Naughton, in The Detroit Free Press (17), explained the complexities in crowning a new heavyweight champion, particularly in such a racist era:\n\n\"A correspondent has asked me if Jeff has the power to confer the title on any one, and I am free to confess that I do not know. I believe that transfers of that kind have been made in the past, but I don't think the public regarded these ready-made champions seriously. This is a hard hearted world and to be queen of the May in the domain of swats a man has to battle for the distinction.\n\n\"To tell the truth, Jeffries, with all his might, is the kind of a man that should have little to say in regard to the world's championship once he relinquishes it. He draws the color line, and according to the ethics he established, might extract from the man he endows with the title a promise that no negro fighter should be allowed a chance to become the world's premier pugilist. This would be manifestly unfair.\n\n\"As long as Jeffries himself refused to give battle to a black-skinned gladiator we didn't mind it so much, for we felt that it was largely a whim and that Jeffries if he did happen to change his mind, would dispose of his negro challengers as completely as he did of the white heavyweights who opposed him from time to time.\n\n\"But Jeffries is one fighter in a thousand. There is little prospect of such another wonderful ring-man being developed and there is little fear, in the case he hands over the championship, of the man honoured being regarded as a worthy successor. For an inferior heavyweight to emulate Jeffries and draw the color line would be ridiculous, though for that matter an attempt on any one's part to assume the prerogatives of a champion because Jeff named him \"as such\" would only provoke ridicule.\n\n\"If Jeff drops the running there will have to be a new deal. Public opinions will dictate who is best entitled to battle for the blue ribbon, and the latter-day matchmakers, who make few mistakes in these matters, will see that public opinion is respected.\"\n\nBefore entering the ring to referee the Hart/Root fight, The Washington Post (20) reported that \"Jim Jeffries awaited upon both men, stated that he had retired for good from the ring, and that the winner of this fight is entitled to the name heavyweight champion of the world.\"\n\nAfter the fight Jeffries, told the press (20):\n\n\"Hart is a great fighter and is deserving of every bit of credit for his victory, for he beat a good man.\n\n\"I have no power to confer the title of world's championship upon any man. If I had I would give it to my brother Jack. Hart is a capable of fighting for the title and in my opinion will be able to defend it.\n\n\"The championship, however, rests with the people. They and the press alone can confer the title of world champion upon the victor and they will name the heavyweight champion.\"\n\nAlthough some historians (2) viewed Hart as a \"titlist,\" rather than as a true \"champion,\" following his victory over Root, most of the press recognised his status as the new Heavyweight Champion (20) (21) (22) (23).\n\nIn summary, filling the championship vacancy at this time consisted of having a battle between two boxers that the majority of the public/press approved of as being worthy of fighting for the championship. The support of the previous, retired, champion (Jeffries), added credibility to the match-up.\n\n1905 – 1927. “The Fightin’ Kentuckian,” Marvin Hart is a forgotten man among the heavyweight champions, yet ironically, the next Kentuckian to win the crown, is the most famous (Muhammad Ali). A shade under 6-foot, Hart was not the smallest, not the biggest, not the quickest nor the flashiest, but nevertheless he was a solid all-rounder who had earned his shot at the title with a hard-fought points win over 26-year-old Jack Johnson. Hart’s reign after beating Root lasted a paltry six months – he then got outpointed over 20 rounds by Canada’s Tommy Burns, in California. The quick fisted “Little Giant of Hanover,” – at 5’7, the shortest man to win the heavyweight crown - utilised good head movement and could skilfully jump in and out of range to land his hammer blows. His opposition was not always of the highest calibre, but he notched up 13 successful defences, winning 11 by knockout, before finally agreeing to a 1908 Boxing Day clash with the masterful, Jack Johnson, in Sydney Stadium, Australia. Johnson, 6’1, 194lbs, toyed with and mocked the champion throughout the fight until the police mercifully halted the one-sided affair in round 14, to prevent the fatigued, now defenceless Burns, taking further punishment. Johnson was the first black man to win the Heavyweight World Championship.\n\nThe “Galveston Giant” didn’t look back, memorably knocking out reigning middleweight champion, Stanley Ketchel, and stopping former heavyweight champion Jim Jeffries in 1910, in a clash which was dubbed “The Fight of the Century.” He remained the king of the division for five and a half years until 6’6”, 239lbs Jess Willard KO’d him in the 26th round of their contest on April 5, 1915. After just one defence Willard had over three years away from the ring, but then returned, only to get savagely beaten over three rounds by a rampaging Jack Dempsey, on July 4th, 1919. The ferocious “Manassa Mauler” captured the attention of the world. His fight with George Carpentier was promoted as “The Fight of the Century” and was boxing’s first million-dollar gate, generating $1,789, 238. Dempsey’s last successful defence was his 11-knockdown barnburner with Luis Firpo, after which he had three years away from the ring, coming back in 1926, his hunger perhaps slightly diminished, when he lost the championship on points to Gene Tunney.\n\nThe following year, in front of a crowd of nearly 105,000 at Soldiers Field in Chicago, Tunney won the legendary “Long Count” fight (the referee’s slow count in round seven gave Tunney valuable time to recover from his knockdown). He stopped Tom Heeney the following year, his second and final championship defence.\n\n1928. Tunney retired on July 31, 1928 (five days after the Heeney fight), making the championship vacant. As per The Brooklyn Eagle, August 1, 1928 (24):\n\n\"For the first time in some two dozen years Queensberry and the universe at large is bereft of a world's heavyweight champion. Running true to the advance \"dope\", Gene Tunney announced his retirement at a luncheon given by the champion at the Biltmore Hotel yesterday. Tunney declared that never again would he don the mitts in professional competition.\"\n\nIn July 1928, at Gene Tunney's retirement luncheon at the Biltmore Hotel, the plan to find his replacement was unveiled (24):\n\n\"Mr Tunney put the official stamp on the new elimination tourney that will furnish his successor. He donated a prize of Fistiana to be known as the Muldoon-Tunney trophy, upon which will be inscribed the names of the champions of the past and those to come. Gene explained he had done this much for Rickard in lieu of fulfilling a contract which called for his appearance in the ring next year.\"\n\nTunney, as reported by The Brooklyn Daily Times (26), explained:\n\n\"Somewhere there is an unknown champion and I believe Rickard is the best qualified man to find him.\"\n\nAfter a series of elimination fights following Tunney's retirement, by June 1930, Schmeling and Sharkey emerged as the two men, who were considered the best in the division (30) (33), and were also rated as the top two contenders in the division by Ring Magazine.\n\n1930. Max Schmeling defeated Jack Sharkey via a 4th round disqualification on June 12, 1930, to fill the championship vacancy (27) (28) (29).\n\n1931 – 1948. Between 1932 – 1937, the championship changed hands five time in five years (from Max Schmeling, to Jack Sharkey, to Primo Carnera, to Max Baer, to Jim Braddock), but then then it remained tightly in the possession of the “Brown Bomber,” Joe Louis, for 11 years 8 months. Louis made 25 consecutive defences, the longest reign with the most defences any fighter has ever made, in any division. His 1941 tussle with Billy Conn is one of the greatest fights ever, and his annihilation of Germany’s Max Schmeling at Yankee Stadium before the start of World War II is etched in sporting history. Louis defeated quality opposition and Ring Magazine ranked contenders so easily the press described them as “bums” (see the Bum of the Month Club) – Joe was a phenomenon, decades ahead of his era, but by the mid-late 1940s he was deteriorating, and was lucky to scrape past wily old Jersey Joe Walcott in 1947. Louis, however, ended the rivalry in 1948 with an 11th round KO.\n\n1949. Joe Louis retired on March 1, 1949. As per The Los Angeles Times (36):\n\n\"Joe Louis resigned as undefeated world heavyweight boxing champion tonight to become a fight promoter. The Alabama-born Negro heavyweight who has held the heavyweight crown longer and defended it more often than any man in boxing history made a formal resignation by letter to the National Boxing Commission.\"\n\nJoe Louis explained: “I'm glad to retire. The decision was my own. I could see that I couldn't fight any more and decided to retire.\"\n\n1949. Ezzard Charles defeated \"Jersey\" Joe Walcott via 15 round decision on June 23, 1949, to fill the championship vacancy.\n\nOn March 2, 1949, it was reported (36) that Joe Louis had \"asked and received NBA permission to promote a match between Ezzard Charles and Jersey Joe Walcott in June for the NBA-recognized world's heavyweight title.\"\n\nLouis said, \"I have already begun to work in my new capacity as director of boxing for the club (the newly formed International Boxing Club - a new fight promotion alliance). Our organization has obtained the signatures of Ezzard Charles and Jersey Joe Walcott on agreements to engage in a 15-round heavyweight contest this June.\"\n\nOn June 21, 1949, journalist Tommy Holmes (37) explained that Walcott and Charles, while not considered to be great heavyweights, were still the best two men in the division now that Louis had retired. The Daily News (38) stated that the two men \"stack up as the best of a bad crop of challengers,\" and The Ring, even though the magazine's title was not at stake, also rated Charles and Walcott as the top two in the weight class.\n\nIt was noted that In England, promoter Jack Solomons was going to name the winner of a Bruce Woodcok Vs Lee Savold fight in September as the \"heavyweight champion of the world.\" Woodcock's KO loss to a \"washed up\" Tami Mauriello in his only fight in America, and Savold's approximately 20 losses, including one by KO to Elmer Ray, meant this \"world title\" claim would not receive much respect (37).\n\n1949 – 1955. The “Cincinnati Cobra” defended his crown three times over his first 15 months as champion, but it took a dominant points win over a returning Joe Louis on September 27, 1950, to win the seal of approval among the masses. Ezzard, arguably the best light heavyweight ever, successfully made another four defences, but then got spectacularly KO’d by a crushing left uppercut from Jersey Joe Walcott (the third meeting between the pair) – at 38 years old, Walcott was, at that time, the oldest man to win the heavyweight championship. Walcott won the rematch the following year, finishing their rivalry, two apiece, before being obliterated by an equally stunning punch, Rocky Marciano’s lethal right hand, AKA “Suzie Q.”\n\n1956. Following six straight defences Rocky Marciano retired on April 27, 1956, making the championship vacant. The “Brockton Blockbuster,” 49-0, is still, even today, the only heavyweight with a perfect record to have retired as reigning champion. At a formal news conference, Rocky declared (45):\n\n\"I am retiring because of my wife and Mary Anne (his 3-and-a-half-year-old daughter).\n\n\"Actually I feel good. I still have some good fights left in me. My mother never did want me to fight. My decision puts her very much at ease. My father always liked boxing but he's happy to see me quit.\n\n\"Even before the Archie Moore fight I was thinking about retirement. After the fight I really began to consider it seriously. I think I would be taking advantage of my family if I tried to fight anymore. At first I was single. It didn't make any difference then. But the baby makes a lot of difference.\"\n\n1956. Jim Norris (president of the International Boxing Club) attended Marciano's retirement news conference, and said he was intending to organise an elimination tournament:\n\n\"Rocky mentioned Moore, Patterson and Jackson. I think there are six or seven others, fellows like Johnny Holman, Nino Valdes and Bob Baker who should have an opportunity to box in an elimination series.\n\n\"I will ask the New York State Athletic Commission, the European Boxing Union and the National Boxing Association to recognize the winner of the tournament that we, or any other promoter, run.\" (45)\n\nPatterson won a split decision over Tommy Jackson, and Archie Moore received a bye, although the “Old Mongoose” had earned his place with solid work over the previous two years (wins over 6’3” 210lbs Nino Valdes, and Howard King, as well as a highly competitive bout with Marciano in which he floored the champion). The two men were ranked as the leading contenders in The Ring ratings.\n\nFloyd Patterson (aged 21 years, 10 months, and 26 days) KO'd Archie Moore in the 5th round, on November 30, 1956, to fill the championship vacancy, and in doing so set the record as the youngest man to be recognised as World Heavyweight Champion. 30 years later Mike Tyson would be a shade younger when beating Trevor Berbick, but Tyson’s win in this fight earned him the WBC belt, not the Lineal Championship (he was three days shy of his 22nd birthday when he won the crown from Michael Spinks, in 1988).\n\n1956 – 1969. Patterson got KO’d by Sweden’s Ingemar Johansson in 1960, but then set another record, when the following year he became the first man to ever regain the heavyweight championship when he chillingly knocked out his conqueror with a left hook “gazelle” punch, in round 5 of their March 13, 1961, contest.\n\nLong-time top contender Sonny Liston, eventually got his crack at the champion on September 25, 1962, and didn’t waste the opportunity. Liston crushed Patterson in 2 minutes, 6 seconds, and in the immediate rematch a year later, he needed merely another 4 seconds to repeat the result. The 215lbs intimidator appeared unstoppable, but then along came a loud mouthed young-gun from Louisville. The “Louisville Lip,” Cassius Clay as he was then known, lacked both experience and power, and possessed an unconventional defensive style, leaning back from punches with his hands low – he appeared no match for Liston. As it turned out Clay’s lightning quick jab and dancing footwork, enabled him to repeatedly sting and frustrate the champion. In round 5 Clay was blinded by a foreign substance in his eyes, and looked on the verge of being unable to continue. Fortunately his vision cleared, and he got back to business in round 6 – after which, it was a cut and demoralised Liston, who refused to come out for the 7th round, losing his heavyweight crown on his stool in a major sporting upset.\n\nClay changed his name to Muhammad Ali, and then KO’d Liston in the first round of their 1965 rematch, with a legendary short right hand, a shot he called his “anchor punch.”\n\nAli, reaching his peak, stormed through another eight defences looking like one of the quickest and most formidable fighting machines there has ever been. His sensational prime years were cut short. On April 28th, 1967, Ali refused to submit to the United States draft, and soon afterwards, the New York Boxing Commission and the WBA stripped him of his titles. Just under two weeks before Joe Frazier was due to fight Jimmy Ellis, Ali held a press conference (February 3rd 1970), to say he would not enter the ring as a professional, and \"called Nat Loubet, editor of Ring, to inform him that he had quit boxing. At this time The Ring acknowledge the vacancy the New York and WBA had declared two years earlier.\" (2)\n\nTwelve days after the apparent “retirement”, on February 15, 1970, as per The Philadelphia Inquirer (33), Muhammad Ali gave his opinion on the Frazier-Ellis fight:\n\n\"Kids come around all the time. And on weekends, people are always driving by and looking. People haven't forgotten me. They know who the real heavyweight champion is. Just like Ellis and Frazier know.\"\n\n\"They won't even let me in the ring Monday to give my belt to the winner. Some pot-bellied, cigar-smoking, dried-up old men who write the boxing laws, they're responsible for this and for making me a hero to my people. They couldn't wait to take my title. It was an honour for them to put me out of boxing.\"\n\nThe day after Frazier had KO'd Ellis, one of Ali's attorneys, Robert Arum, told the press, \"We're going to make a motion in federal court in Houston that he be permitted 24 hours to leave the country so he can fight Frazier in Toronto in May.\"\n\nThe Sun newspaper stated (34): \"Earlier efforts to stage a Clay-Frazier bout in Florida and Texas failed because of public pressure on state officials there to deny Clay a licence.\"\n\nAli's predicament was unprecedented. It was confusing for boxing fans in 1970, and still is, for fans and analysts trying to recall the full details of what happened. Despite a \"retirement,\" conveniently declared two weeks before Frazier and Ellis were due to fight for the vacant Ring title, Ali frequently reminded the public both before and after the February 16th fight that he was the true champion. It is also evident that attempts were made by his team to organise a fight with Frazier during this period, and as such, Lineal Boxing Champion recognises Ali as the Lineal Champion from 1964, until he lost to Frazier in 1971.\n\n1971 – 1978. The 1970s truly were a golden era for heavyweight boxing. In a fight that lived up to the astronomical hype, Frazier defeated Ali on March 8 1971 in the “Fight of the Century,” to become The Man that beat The Man. “Smokin’” Joe then had two relatively easy stoppage wins, before getting pulverised and bounced around the ring in Jamaica, by the sledgehammer-fisted George Foreman. “Big” George dished out similarly brutal destructions to Jose Roman, and to former Ali-conqueror, Ken Norton, over the next 14 months. Astoundingly, on October 30, 1974, Ali, aged 32, defeated another heavyweight monster, knocking out Foremen in round 8 of the “Rumble in the Jungle.” By 1978, Ali, who had been in gradual decline, was narrowly outpointed by 7-fight professional novice (1976 Olympic light heavyweight gold medallist), Leon Spinks. “The Greatest” knuckled down in training and regained the championship from “Neon” Leon seven months later, winning by 15-round unanimous decision in front of 63, 350 fans at the Superdome in Louisiana.\n\n2004. The Briton retired on February 6, 2004, resulting in the Heavyweight Championship becoming vacant. Speaking at a news conference in London, he said:\n\n\"It's a special day in my life. I'd like to announce that June 21, 2003, was my last fight as a professional boxer.\n\n\"It has been a great honour to be the standard-bearer of boxing for the last decade. Let the next era begin.\"\n\nLewis also paid tribute to the Lineal Championship:\n\n\"I am particularly pleased to be stepping down while still the reigning lineal heavyweight champion. Only two other men, Gene Tunney and Rocky Marciano, have retired as champion and stayed retired. I promise you, I will be the third.\"\n\n2004: On April 24th, 2004, Vitali Klitschko defeated Corrie Sanders to win the vacant Ring belt.\n\nBoxing Scene (50) described Ring's crowning of Vitali following the Sanders fight as a \"fiasco,\" stating that it \"struggled with legitimacy,\" and Sports Illustrated's list (52) of Lineal Heavyweight Champions did not feature Vitali. ESPN (53) reported that \"many\" viewed \"Vitali's victory over Sanders as having re-established the lineage following Lewis' retirement,\" but acknowledged that \"others aren't so sure.\"\n\nAt the time of the bout Vitali was rated #1 with Ring and Boxing Monthly, however, Sanders was #3 with Ring, and was not in the top 5 with Boxing Monthly, who ranked him only at #7.\n\nBoxing Scene noted that Corrie Sanders was the first serious top ten contender that Vitali had ever beaten (50).\n\nUltimately, the consensus was that this fight was not considered to be a Lineal Championship fight, as Chris Byrd, not Corrie Sanders, was the clear #2 (as per The Ring and Boxing Monthly ratings). Vitali had lost to Chris Byrd in April 2000, when, despite being ahead on the scorecards, he could no longer continue due to a shoulder injury. In 2004-2005. A Byrd/Klitschko fight would have crowned the true champion of the division.\n\nFive years later, Sports Illustrated, Boxing Scene and ESPN all firmly recognized Wladimir's victory over Ruslan Chagaev as a fight that filled the lineal vacancy.\n\n2009. Wladimir Klitschko defeated Ruslan Chagaev by 9th round TKO on June 20th, 2009, to fill the championship vacancy.\n\nWladimir was rated #1 with Ring (August 2009) edition, and #2 with Boxing Monthly (July 2009 edition). Chagaev was rated #3 with both of these publications.\n\nNigel Collins, Editor-in Chief of The Ring explained that Klitschko/Chagaev would be for the vacant Ring belt: “Wladimir is The Ring’s No.1 heavyweight contender, and his participation is mandatory, but as the No.2 contender is his brother, Vitali, and the brothers have stated many times that they will never fight, a match between Wladimir and No.3 contender Chagaev meets The Ring’s criterion.” (49)\n\nAlthough Boxing Monthly had Vitali rated above Wladimir, the general consensus was that Wladimir was the No.1 heavyweight in the world. (48) (49) (50)\n\nIn early June 2009, Boxing Scene’s Cliff Rold explained why Wladimir/Chagaev would be such a significant fight, one that would be “more than enough to declare a new start point for the lineage.”\n\nRold continued:\n\n“While he was away, it was his brother and Chagaev who emerged as the best in class and, while Vitali has a say, a fight between Wladimir and Chagaev would be more than enough to declare a new start point for the lineage of the division. Wladimir has won ten straight since his last loss. Of those ten, five were legitimate top five-ten contenders (Samuel Peter, Chris Byrd, Calvin Brock, Sultan Ibragimov, Tony Thompson) at the time Wladimir fought them. Lamon Brewster represented revenge over the last man to defeat him and Hasim Rahman, in his last fight, gave him a win over one of only two active former lineal World Heavyweight Champions.\n\n“He’s already been all but officially crowned on those merits. Big brother made a splash with comeback wins over Peter and top-ten contender Juan Carlos Gomez, but he doesn’t have the sheer volume to overcome little brother’s advantage in laying claim to the summit of the sweet science.\n\n“And Chagaev is the highest rated opponent left available to seal the deal because the brother’s won’t be fighting each other. Ring has already indicated in their headlines they’d recognize a Wladimir-Chagaev winner as the division’s true king and, unlike the Vitali fiasco, this coronation would stick.”\n\nAfter Wladimir’s TKO victory, Boxing Scene’s managing editor reported (51):\n\n“An assortment of titles were at stake, but none more important than the lineal heavyweight championship, with this fight marking the 43rd time in boxing history that someone has claimed the sport’s most historic prize.”\n\nBetween 2009-2012, as well as The Ring’s belt being awarded, the following sites all identified Klitschko-Chagaev as the fight that filled the lineal vacancy: Sports Illustrated (52), ESPN (53), Boxing Scene (51), Cyber Boxing Zone (54).\n\n2010 – 2013. By mid-2013 the 6’6” Ukrainian had racked up seven defenses, comfortably overcoming a range of styles. Victories included a KO of powerful Nigerian puncher, Samuel Peter (who had floored him three times in their 2005 fight), emphatic wins over two former lineal cruiserweight champions (David Haye and Jean Marc Mormeck), as well as easily beating men who matched up with him physically, Tony Thompson and Mariusz Wach.\n\n2013: On October 5th, 2013, Wladimir Klitschko won a 12 round unanimous decision over Alexander Povetkin. Prior to this bout, Wladimir was already The Ring champion but the newly formed (October 2012) TBRB Heavyweight title was vacant. The Ring regarded Klitschko's victory over Ruslan Chagaev as the fight which filled their vacancy but the TBRB did not accept Klitschko/Chagaev as worthy of filling their championship, as Vitali had still been active at that time.\n\nWladimir Klitschko and Alexander Povetkin were rated #1 and #2 respectively by the TBRB, so Wladimir's victory meant he was now recognized by the TBRB as champion (55). Vitali Klitschko and David Haye had been inactive for over 12 months so had been removed from the TBRB's Heavyweight ratings.\n\nThe TBRB's decision to use the Klitschko/Povetkin fight to crown their champion, created a new wave of thought among some fans, that this fight, and not the Klitschko/Chagaev fight, had filled the lineal vacancy. However, it should not be forgotten that even if the Povetkin fight had never happened, the general consensus, which was well documented (as outlined above - in the 2009 section), was that Wladimir was already the Lineal Champion from his 2009 victory over Chagaev. The Povetkin fight simply helped cement Wladimir’s credentials.\n\n2014 – 2015. Three more defenses followed, and then in a big upset in Dusseldorf, Germany, on November 28, 2015, Britain’s Tyson Fury frustrated, outmaneuvered and outboxed Wladimir over 12 rounds to end his six-and-a-half-year championship reign, winning by scores of 115/112 x2, 116/111.\n\nAfter dethroning Klitschko, Fury did not fight for two and half years, which was the sixth longest period of inactivity for a lineal heavyweight champion in history (behind Jess Willard, James Corbett, Jack Dempsey Muhammad Ali and Joe Louis). The details behind this dry 2016 – 2018 spell are complex, but are stated below, with quotes and references from prominent journalists/organizations associated with the sport.\n\n2016 – 2018. Despite claims to the contrary, during this period Tyson Fury did not formally announce his retirement, and when his team were questioned about the matter (at the time, in 2016), it was made clear that he was \"definitely not permanently out of the sport.\" (59).\n\n- Retirements: On October 3rd, 2016, Tyson Fury Tweeted (56): \"Boxing was the saddest thing I ever took part in, all a pile of ****, I'm the greatest, & I'm also retired, so go suck a ****, happy days.\" Three hours later he indicated this had been a prank, Tweeting, \"Hahahaha u think you will get rid of the GYPSY KING that easy!!! I'm here to stay #The Greatest. Just shows u what the Medea are like. Tut tut\"\n\nAnother \"retirement\" (68) came on July 26th, 2017, this time via Instagram:\n\n\"been very blessed in my life & career achieve the upmost in boxing, was a epic journey along the way. Thanks to all the fans that supported & believed in me along the way, Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. THE END.\"\n\nThis social media message was also viewed with scepticism, following 2016's \"prank.\" ESPN (57) reported that, \"a source close to Fury told PA Sport that the Manchester-born fighter is 'fine' and is not expected to walk away from boxing.\"\n\n- Loss of sanctioning body titles: Tyson Fury was due to be stripped of his WBA/WBO belts, but instead, on October 13th, 2016, BBC Sport reported that Fury had vacated these sanctioning body titles. His promoter, Mick Hennessey, explained that this \"would allow him time and space to fully recover from his present condition without any undue pressure and with expert medical attention he requires.\" His uncle and trainer, Peter Fury, said Tyson would return \"stronger.\" (58)\n\n- The Ring Magazine asked Team Fury for clarification: In 2019, the editor of the Ring, Dougie Fischer, was quizzed as to why The Ring did not recognize Fury's social media \"retirements,\" or his relinquishing of the ABC belts, as a reason to create a Ring vacancy. Fischer explained that \"the ABC belts have nothing to do with the lineal championship,\" but regarding the retirement issue, as he wasn't editor of Ring in 2016, he contacted the previous editor, Michael Rosenthal, to verify Ring's official standing on the matter. Fischer explained:\n\n\"When members of the Ratings Panel brought up Fury's Tweet, he contacted the Heavyweight's promoter at the time (Mick Hennessey), who basically told him that Fury was temporarily out of sorts, in part due to the stress of dealing with the legal battles with the BBB of C and UKAD, but was definitely NOT permanently out of the sport. Rosenthal trusted Hennessey and made the decision not to strip Fury.\" (59)\n\n- UKAD: In the run up to his championship winning fight against Wladimir Klitschko on November 28th, 2015, UKAD reported no adverse analytical findings in any respect for any of Fury's urine/blood tests after February, in 2015 (clean tests were recorded on May 11th, July 16th, October 8th, October 17th, November 14th.) Tyson Fury was therefore deemed to have won the championship against Klitschko cleanly.\n\nThe full statement made by UKAD on December 12th, 2017 (60):\n\n\"UKAD and Mr Tyson Fury and Mr Hughie Fury issue joint statement. UKAD, Tyson Fury and Hughie Fury have agreed to resolve the proceedings brought by UKAD (1) against Tyson Fury and Hughie Fury based on the reported presence of elevated levels of nandrolone metabolites in urine samples that they provided after their respective fights in February 2015; and (2) against Tyson Fury based on his alleged failure to provide a sample in September 2016.\n\nUKAD's position is that the anti-doping rule violations it has asserted have been committed and the consequences set out in the UK Anti-Doping Rules should apply. Tyson and Hughie Fury's position is that they have never knowingly or deliberately committed any anti-doping rule violation. ‎In recognition of the respective counter-arguments and the risks inherent in the dispute resolution process, each side has accepted a compromise of its position.\n\nThe proceedings have therefore been resolved on the following basis: the anti-doping rule violations based on the reported presence of elevated levels of nandrolone metabolites are upheld, the refusal charge is withdrawn, Hughie and Tyson Fury each receive a two-year period of ineligibility, and their results from their respective fights in February 2015 are disqualified. Taking into account that no adverse analytical findings or adverse passport findings were reported in respect of any of the urine and/or blood samples collected from either boxer after February 2015 (including from Tyson Fury on 11 May 2015, 16 July 2015, 8 October 2015, 17 October 2015, 11 November 2015, 13 July 2016, and 4 May 2017; and from Hughie Fury on 11 May 2015, 25 July 2015, 8 October 2015, 17 October 2015, 14 November 2015, 18 July 2016, 29 September 2016, 18 February 2017, 19 April 2017, 8 August 2017, 29 August 2017, and 23 September 2017), their competition results after February 2015 are not disqualified. Taking into account the delays in results management that meant charges were not brought in respect of the nandrolone findings until June 2016, and the provisional suspensions that Tyson and Hughie Fury have already effectively served, the two year period of ineligibility is backdated to 13 December 2015, and therefore expires at midnight on 12 December 2017\n\nThe British Boxing Board of Control has also agreed to the resolution of these proceedings on this basis.\"\n\n- The consensus among the boxing fraternity: By mid-2018 Tyson Fury was in action again, and in all of his fights he was introduced as the \"Lineal Champion.\" Prior to his first fight of 2018, he was featured on the front cover of the May 2018 edition of Ring Magazine and referred to as, \"The Lineal Champ.\" There were journalists who disagreed (67), but the overwhelming consensus in boxing was that when Tyson Fury, while still unbeaten, was still the reigning Lineal Champion (a title he won by dethroning Wladimir Klitschko). Respected boxing writers such as Tom Gray (British editor of The Ring) (62), Cliff Rold (editor of Boxing Scene and co-founder of the TBRB) (63), Luke Williams (writer for Boxing Monthly) (64), Dan Rafael (Senior sports writer at ESPN) (66), Dougie Fischer (American editor of The Ring) (61) and Thomas Hauser (award winning writer and author of Muhammad Ali: His life and times) (65), all recognized Fury as the reigning Lineal Heavyweight Champion.\n\n2018 – Present. On June 9, at a career heaviest of 276lbs, Tyson Fury returned and successfully defeated the lightly regarded Sefer Seferi by 4th round TKO in what was the first defence of his crown. The fight had been scheduled for only 10 rounds (not the first occasion in heavyweight championship history – see Dempsey/Tunney, for just one example), but the fact remains, if Seferi had pulled off the upset, he would have beaten The Man, and been declared the new Lineal Champion by the boxing fraternity – and incidentally, by the ring MC in the arena, who introduced Fury as the defending Lineal Heavyweight Champion of the World.\n\nTyson outpointed Francesco Pianeta in August 2018, and finished the year with a drama-filled tussle with unbeaten KO artist, Deontay Wilder, in the Staples Center, Los Angeles. Despite a 9th round knockdown, Fury appeared ahead on the scorecards, and then in round a cracking right-left to the chin dropped the champion heavily, flat on his back. To everybody’s surprise Fury stood up and finished strongly, for the fight to be declared a draw.\n\nIn 2019 he KO’d Tom Schwarz and outpointed Otto Wallin, before the highly anticipated rematch with Wilder took place on February 2020 – this time Fury was ultra-dominant, stopping Wilder in round 7.\n\nOver the next year, boxing and the entire world stuttered due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, and a contractual obligation to give Wilder a third fight prevented a mid-2021 Tyson Fury/Anthony Joshua clash. Fury/Wilder 3 eventually took place on October 9, 2021, and was an unexpected classic. Both men came in at their career heaviest weights (238lbs for Wilder and 277lbs for Fury), and in a drama-filled Las Vegas fight Fury looked like getting the early KO after knocking Wilder down in round 3, but in the next round, Wilder returned the favour, flooring Fury twice. “The Gypsy King” – the heaviest Lineal Champion in history – scored another knockdown in round 10, and then KO’d the exhausted American in round 11 with a swinging right hook to the temple.\n\nOn April 23rd, Fury boxed well at range, winning all five round on one card, before knocking out #3 contender (TBRB ratings), Dillian Whyte, in round six before 95,000 fans at Wembley Stadium. In his post-fight ringside interview, Fury appeared to be declaring a retirement (his third), saying: “I think this is it. This might be the final curtain for the Gypsy King. And what a way to go out. A big thank you to the United Kingdom!” In the months after this, the WBC, Ring and TBRB did not accept this “retirement,” and instead all three kept him him as their titlist.\n\nFury posted a video to Twitter on August 9, 2022, announcing that he would be fighting Derek Chisora. He also explained why he “had decided to come back to boxing,” and revealed that he now had a new trainer ( Isaac Lowe).\n\nA fourth “retirement” surfaced on August 12th, 2022, when WBC president, Mauricio Sulaiman said via video message on his Twitter account: “I just had a beautiful media conference with Tyson Fury on his 34th birthday. He has conformed retirement.”\n\nOn August 13, The Ring Magazine (70) reported that Tom Gray (Ring journalist) had “reached out to Tyson Fury for confirmation that he was vacating his Ring heavyweight championship and he answered in the affirmative.”\n\nA day later, multiple news sites (69) reported that Sulaiman had said (In an interview with Izquierdazo):\n\n“We had communication with his promoter and we gave him more than 10 days, until the 26th, to confirm in writing if it is a final decision and in that way, proceed and address the issue.” Sulaiman added (71): “With that, we can proceed to address the situation with the belt. We will wait until August 26. That is our deadline to have a formal confirmation of their final decision.”\n\nIn the week before his rematch, Heavyweight contender, Anthony Joshua, was asked (when speaking to IFLTV) if he believed Fury was retired. Joshua responded: “Officially, you will know ion the 26th (August).” Promoter, Eddie Hearn (in an interview with Pro Boxing Fans), was also dismissive of the retirement claim during this same week, saying: “I believe Tyson Fury comes out of retirement for the 467th time and fights Anthony Joshua.”\n\nWhen Joshua Vs Usyk 2 took place on August 21 (a battle between The Ring’s top two contenders and for their vacant title, now that the magazine had declared it vacant), Fury still had five more days to officially clarify his status regarding retirement, therefore he was still the reigning Lineal Champion at the time of the bout.\n\nImmediately after beating Joshua in the rematch, Usyk spoke to the crowd: “I’m sure that Tyson Fury is not retired. I’m convinced he wants to fight me. I wanna fight him. If I'm not fighting Tyson Fury, I’m not fighting at all.”\n\nAt 12:49am on 21/08/2022 (shortly after Usyk/Joshua 2), Fury posted a video of him saying: “The Gypsy King is here to stay….forever!” He tagged the WBC and his promoter, Frank Warren into the Twitter message/video, appearing to indicate that he was still an active fighter, who had not retired. A few hours later, Fury posted on his Instagram story: “I will relieve the Ukrainian Dosser of his belts, like I did the last Ukrainian Dosser.”\n\nTwo weeks later, Fury explained in an interview with Seconds Out (September 3, 2022) why he had relinquished The Ring Magazine belt: “I gave that belt up (Ring Title) so that they (Usyk/Joshua) could fight for it. Do you know why? Because I’m gonna become a three-time Ring Magazine Heavyweight Champion.” Two days later Fury issued a challenge to Anthony Joshua via video on his social media accounts, saying: “I’d like to give you an opportunity to fight for the WBC Championship of the World and the Lineal Championship, in the next few months.”\n\nThe History of the Lineal Heavyweight Championship.\n\n@LinealBoxChamp\n\nPublished: October 12, 2021.
