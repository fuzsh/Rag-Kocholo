(Star Tribune file/Star Tribune)\n\nThe latest census puts the number of people in Shelby, Mont., at 3,179. It's a town 85 miles north of Great Falls and 35 miles from the Canadian border.\n\nOn Tuesday, Shelby was celebrating more than the 247th anniversary of the United States (for which Montana became the 41st state in 1889). It was also celebrating the prize fight that has allowed this small, out-of-way place to be infamous for 100 years.\n\nNo thorough history of boxing in the United States could be offered without mention of what took place on that Independence Day in 1923, when Jack Dempsey defended his heavyweight title against St. Paul's Tommy Gibbons in a makeshift arena constructed to hold 40,000 in Shelby.\n\n\"There was already train service to Shelby, and a couple of side tracks were added to serve the Pullman cars envisioned to be arriving by the dozens from major cities across the country,'' said Ken Robison, Montana native, retired Navy captain, Great Falls resident and devoted historian of that area.\n\nAs it turned out, America's sportswriting elite were more interested in traveling to northern Montana to see Dempsey than were the Pullman car dandies of the boxing crowd.\n\nThere was one world heavyweight champion then and for several more decades. When that champ defended his title — particularly Dempsey, the indestructible \"Manassa Mauler\" — it was the closest that version of America had in interest to a modern Super Bowl.\n\n\"What has fascinated me is that several of the most famous names in American sportswriting came to cover a fight in this small, rural place in Montana,'' Robison said. \"Grantland Rice, Damon Runyon, Otto Floto and others … and not for a few days. They were in Great Falls for weeks, writing daily about the fight.\"\n\nFloto was from Denver, a legend of the West. He had an immense background in boxing.\n\nThe Minneapolis Daily Star was one of several Twin Cities papers provided elaborate coverage of the 1923 heavyweight title fight between champion Jack Dempsey and challenger Tommy Gibbons from St. Paul in Shelby, Mont.
