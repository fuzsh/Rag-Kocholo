        "text": "A bombshell was dropped on the LNP's re-election strategy this week with the popular local mayor of Bundaberg, Jack Dempsey, announcing (on his birthday no less) he will run as an independent in the seat of Hinkler.\n\nIt's a seat Labor last held during the Hawke-Keating years and had little hope of winning this time around with the incumbent MP, Resources Minister Keith Pitt, sitting on a margin of 14.2 per cent.\n\nLabor may need seven seats to form a majority in its own right at next month's election but it also helps Labor's cause if a friendly face takes a seat from the Coalition, or the Liberal National Party (LNP) as they are formally known in Queensland.\n\nCr Dempsey was the local LNP MP for Bundaberg from 2006 to 2015 and police minister in the government of Campbell Newman — a period in which Bundaberg-born Keith Pitt inherited the seat of Hinkler.\n\nAfter losing office, Mr Dempsey ran for mayor in 2016, dumping his LNP membership in the process.\n\nHe won with 71 per cent of the vote and won again in 2020 with 65 per cent of the first-preference vote.\n\nIn those years, local political observers will tell you how the relationship between Cr Dempsey and Mr Pitt soured over various local issues, including the cashless debit card, the Hinkler Regional Deal, and a proposal from Mr Dempsey for a flood levee.\n\nIt's a sign of a massive falling out between the former colleagues.\n\n\"And the minister for 'no' here in Hinkler, I just say you had nine years to deliver,\" Cr Dempsey said on Thursday.\n\n\"Mr Pitt is out of touch with the local community on climate change, the housing crisis, flood mitigation and coal mining.\"\n\nOpposition descends on Bundaberg\n\nAt the same time, Labor's most-senior federal MPs, including Leader Anthony Albanese, Shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Senator Anthony Chisholm have been making repeated visits to Bundaberg.\n\nThe Opposition Leader has invited the Mayor, twice, to photo opportunities at the Bundaberg Rum Distillery, while a spokesman for Mr Dempsey said the mayor \"meets regularly\" with Senator Anthony Chisholm, a former state secretary of the Labor Party and the architect of Kevin Rudd's 2007 federal campaign.\n\nLast election, Mr Pitt won 46 per cent of the primary vote, while Labor garnered just 22 per cent.\n\nIf Cr Dempsey finishes second, he may be able to surf on the preferences of Labor and others over the line, and would be helped if the ALP candidate ran dead.\n\nThat candidate is Jason Scanes, who is currently an electorate officer for … *pauses for effect* … Senator Anthony Chisholm.\n\n\"We won't be running dead,\" Senator Chisholm said, noting he needed as much help as possible in the Senate race, where — if history is a guide — Labor is likely to secure two spots in Queensland, and he is second on the ticket.\n\nWargaming a hung parliament\n\nAs for how long this plan from Cr Dempsey has been in the making, there is much scuttlebutt.\n\nHe's batted away questions from as far back as the 2020 local government elections that he was seeking to make the jump.\n\nMr Pitt notes that Cr Dempsey began \"wandering into federal issues\" some time last year.\n\nThis, from Cr Dempsey's media conference yesterday, seemed emphatic:\n\nJournalist: \"How long have you been considering running for the seat of Hinkler?\"\n\nDempsey: \"I've only been considering for the past couple of weeks.\"\n\nHowever, his newly launched website, jackforhinkler.com, was registered in March last year.\n\n[Qld local edition teaser]\n\nCr Dempsey's chief of staff, Michael Gorey, explained the apparent contradiction by saying he suggested to his boss 18 months ago that he should have a go at Hinkler and, after \"umming and aahing\", Cr Dempsey only now \"has taken the plunge\".\n\nIf Cr Dempsey pulls off what would be an upset victory, he's already wargamed the scenario of a hung parliament, pledging to deal initially with the party with the most seats and ensure supply if they meet his policy demands.\n\n\"If you're not voting for the Liberal National Party, you'll be getting an Albanese Labor government … and the Bundaberg Mayor will fit right in,\" Mr Pitt said on ABC Radio.\n\nIf Cr Dempsey loses, it's back to being mayor, but along with a relationship with Keith Pitt that sinks to levels not even a thousand birthdays could make up for."
