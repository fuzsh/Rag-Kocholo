        "text": "Jack Dempsey the boxer did not think of himself as being Irish at all as far as anyone can make out - unlike Gene Tunney, Jim Braddock and others - and was never in Ireland. At the time he was supposed to be representing the Irish Communists in Moscow - in 1928 the year after he had lost the famous rematch to Tunney - he was actually starring in a Broadway show called The Big Fight with his movie star wife Estelle Taylor. It was later made into a film that year. No doubt Dempsey flew back to Hollywood with requests from Stalin and the boys for autographs of Charlie Chaplin!\n\nHe also spent a lot of time hanging around the White House. As Comintern delegates do\n\nAnyway. The Dublin Communist Jack Dempsey was a member of the Workers Union of Ireland and also a member of the IRA. He was later involved in the founding of the Revolutionary Workers Groups which became the CPI in 1933. He never, as far as we know, won the world heavyweight boxing championship. All documented in Treacy's history of the CPI.\n\nYes I actually met the Gorgeous Gael in Pettycoat Lane in London in the mid 70's. Do you know who I am was his greeting before he would nearly brake your hand with a shake. In a way it was kind of sad to see this man almost beg for a few bob that I was told then he would go spend in the pub. My uncle told me where he would be at a certain time so it wasn't by chance I met him. He didn't tap me though but I think he was kinda chuffed that a teenager recognized him. I got a great laugh out of your story I wonder what answer did he give back as he was fairly handy with his tongue also.\n\nYeah he was a character alright, my Dad(from Galway) was staying in Dublin in the 40's and was around when Jack and Movita were in town, he said there was nothing in Ireland like them at the time, he said it was like having the beatles move to your town lock stock and barrel.\n\nI think they got married about then but Jack started boozing heavily and also started hitting Movita, He also got into a few scrapes with the Gardai and on one occasion hit a detective in a pub in Ranalagh and did two weeks in Mountjoy.\n\nDempsey on the other hand was no slouch and managed his money and career well after the boxing life. I think he wrote a number of Books, was involved in some other projects, and served as a Lieutenant Commander in The USCG during the war, and I think may have been present when the US took Okinawa.\n\nFor two immensely successful Boxers, Their lives ended in radically different ways, apparently Doyles body lay unclaimed in a London hospital for a week before it was claimed and returned to Cobh.\n\nActually one of his quips when asked about how he lost all his money was \"Because I spent most of it on slow horses and fast women\" !!"
