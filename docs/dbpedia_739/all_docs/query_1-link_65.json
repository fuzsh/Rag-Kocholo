        "text": "JACK DEMPSEY - 10-12CM\n\nMature Jack Dempsey is a beautiful fish. The adult will have a dark purple-grey background contrasted with iridescent light blue, green, and gold spangle spots all over its body. Male Jack Dempsey's tend to have more of these brilliant spots than females, and also present bright red edges on their dorsal and anal fins. In addition to the baseline colouring, many captive bred colour varieties have also been developed and are available today.\n\nSouth American Cichlid. It is stocky and compact in shape but can grow to almost 10 inches (25 cm) in length.\n\nDOA Policy for Live Fish shipping\n\nAt Aquaholics, we place utmost importance on the careful shipping of live fish to ensure their safe arrival. Our commitment to quality includes taking various measures during transit. Each fish bag is infused with medical-grade oxygen and an ammonia-neutralizing solution. In colder periods, we also utilize heat packs to maintain optimal temperatures. However, we understand that unforeseen circumstances can sometimes lead to unfortunate outcomes. To provide you with peace of mind, we have implemented a Dead-on Arrival (DOA) policy that ensures you are covered in such situations.\n\nProcedure:\n\nOwner's Presence: It is essential for the owner or an authorised representative to be available at the provided shipping address to receive the fish. If no one is available, the courier will leave your parcel in a safe space as all fish orders are shipped ATL.\n\nShipping Address: Please provide a valid street address for shipping. Ensure the address is accurate and complete to avoid any delivery issues.\n\nReporting DOA: If you receive a fish that is dead on arrival, please notify us promptly. Within 2 hours of receiving the fish, send an email to our customer support team. Include the following details in your email:\n\nName: Your full name\n\nOrder Number: The unique order number associated with your purchase\n\nDOA Fish Picture: Attach a clear picture of the deceased fish\n\nTerms and Conditions:\n\nTimely Notification: Please make your DOA claim within 2 hours of receiving the fish. Claims submitted after this timeframe will not be eligible for compensation.\n\nProper Documentation: Ensure that your email includes accurate and complete information, including your name, order number, email, and a clear picture of the deceased fish. Incomplete or inaccurate information may delay the processing of your claim.\n\nVerification: Our customer support team will review the provided information to verify the DOA claim. Once the claim is validated, we will proceed with the appropriate compensation.\n\nCompensation Options: In the event of a DOA, we offer two compensation options: a) Store Credit: You will receive a store credit equal to the value of the deceased fish, which can be used for future purchases. b) Refund: We can issue a refund for the value of the deceased fish, processed through the original payment method used for the purchase.\n\nShipping Costs: Please note that shipping costs are non-refundable unless the entire order is considered a DOA.\n\nConditions Apply: Our DOA policy covers only fish that are dead upon arrival. It does not apply to fish that perish after successful delivery and acclimation to their new environment.\n\nWe are committed to providing the best possible experience for our customers and ensuring the well-being of our live fish. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our DOA policy, don't hesitate to get in touch with our customer support team at [email protected] , and we will be glad to assist you.\n\nNote: The terms and conditions outlined in this DOA policy are subject to change without prior notice. We recommend reviewing the most up-to-date policy on our website or contacting our customer support team for any updates.\n\nThank you again for allowing us on your aqaurium journey.\n\nJesse Elstak\n\nOwner"
