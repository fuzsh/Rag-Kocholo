        "text": "Jack Dempsey believes Glasgow can continue to get his best rugby from him after extending his contract. The 28-year-old has made 33 Warriors appearances and become an established member of Gregor Townsend’s Scotland squad since arriving at Scotstoun in the summer of 2021.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDempsey won 14 caps for Australia but was able to switch allegiances because of his Scots-born grandfather and made his debut for Townsend’s side in the autumn of 2022 after winning his club’s player of the year award following his debut season.\n\nThe back row forward has now won nine Scotland caps, the latest a player-of-the-match performance against Italy in the Guinness Six Nations. “I’m really pleased to finalise my future with the club,” Dempsey told glasgowwarriors.org.\n\n“Ever since I arrived, this has been a club with a massive amount of ambition and aspirations to play rugby in a particular way, as well as being successful. I have enjoyed being a part of it from minute one, especially this season – we have gone to another level this year and the competition within the squad is at an all-time high.\n\n“It’s the right place for me to play my best rugby and I’m excited to see what we can achieve next. We are moving into a crucial part of the schedule and as we move into knockout rugby, that’s what we as players dream of being involved in. Scotstoun is an electric atmosphere on the big occasions and I can’t wait to get stuck in.”\n\nHead coach Franco Smith added: “Jack’s quality has been clear to see every time he pulls on a Glasgow Warriors jersey and we are pleased that he will be remaining with the club for the next couple of seasons.\n\n“His ball-carrying is a real asset to the way we want to play and he is passionate about playing his part for this club. He is a fantastic athlete and it’s great to see his commitment to Glasgow day in, day out.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFEATURE\n\nJoey Mongalo: 'I've had to swim in high-performance waters my whole life'\n\nThe Sharks defence guru is widely regarded as one of South Africa's hottest coaching properties.\n\nFEATURE\n\nHow will Scott Robertson shuffle his backline pack for the Rugby Championship?\n\nAfter the England Series, the All Blacks have rung the backline changes ahead of The Rugby Championship opener with Los Pumas\n\nFEATURE\n\nKolisi's short-term French leave shows Top 14 is no playground for superstars of the game\n\nThe premier French league is no retirement home for superstars of the game and players have to immerse themselves one hundred percent"
