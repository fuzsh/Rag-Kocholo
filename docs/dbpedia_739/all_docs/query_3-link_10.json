He\n\ntypifies crashing power, he stands for\n\ncleverness and defensive ability. And\n\nno boxer has matched Jack in his\n\nintriguing personality, his ability to\n\ndraw the crowd, and bring out its support.\n\nJohn L. Sullivan had the punch and\n\nthe appeal. But he did not combine\n\nthese qualities and possessions to anything\n\nlike the degree to which they\n\nwere developed by Jack Dempsey.\n\nJames J. Corbett was a more clever\n\nfighter than Dempsey or any other\n\nheavvweight. Gentleman Jim had a\n\nmost salut&rv influence on the game,\n\nhis rise to the title over Sullivan lifting\n\nboxing from a threatened decadence.\n\nBut Corbett did not have, the allround\n\nphysical and technical attributes,\n\nor the appeal to the general\n\npublic, which made Dempsey the central\n\nfigure in so many million-dollar\n\ngates.\n\nDempsey owed his success to one\n\nverv important fact — his willingness\n\nand determination to give the best\n\nthat was' in him in every contest.\n\nWhen a truly great fighter embodies\n\nthis determination in lus code of life,\n\nhe is bound to attain a position which\n\nchallenges the leaders of the past, and\n\nsets up a formidable mark for those\n\nwho are to come.\n\nOnly too often great boxers lack\n\nunderstanding of their positions, their\n\nduties to the public and the titles\n\nwhich they attain, and they show a\n\nstartling inability to understand themselves.\n\nThey sometimes underestimate their\n\nvalue in their relation to the sport\n\nand its supporters. Or they overrate\n\ntheir own importance and their positions\n\nin the general scheme of life.\n\nSome look from an abysmal pit up\n\nto the game which nurtures them.\n\nOthers assume a most, deplorable, patronising\n\nattitude in which they gaze\n\ndown from self - raised Olympian\n\nheights on a game in which they\n\nfigure only because they want the\n\nmcncy it affords them.\n\nJack Dempsey, risen from miner to\n\nthe world championship, never lost\n\nsight of his duty to boxing and those\n\nwho paid their way into the arena.\n\nHe never lost sight of the fact that\n\nthe championship was his. only through\n\nthe courtesy of the public, and that\n\nthe public recognised the basic principles\n\nof the situation.\n\nJack Dempsey was not only the\n\ngreatest fighter, but he combined with\n\nhis ring ability a business sense which\n\nlifted him over the heads of a long\n\nline of titleholders who were insensible\n\nto their financial welfare and its\n\nrelation to the public attitude. This\n\nbusiness sense has remained with him\n\nand placed him in a responsible position\n\nas a promoter.\n\nManassa Mauler Dempsey was splendidly\n\nendowed by Nature. He went\n\ninto the game with an ideal body. He\n\nhas the physique—not too big a target.\n\nnot too small to fight the biggest\n\nof them all. Jess Willard.\n\nHe had physical power, stamina and\n\nendurance. He had a smile and a\n\nsense of humor. He had the inherent\n\nability to absorb educative influences—\n\nto learn as he went along, and convert\n\nthe mucker of the copper mines into\n\na well-groomed man who was a.t home\n\nin the drawing-room of the millionaire\n\nand could exchange repartee with the\n\n\"gag men\" of Hollywood.\n\nJust as a caterpillar emerges from\n\nthe chrysalis a butterfly, so did Dempsey\n\ndevelop in every phase which was\n\nessential for his welfare as the world's\n\nchampion. He was not patronising,\n\nhe was not \"high liat,\" he glimpsed the\n\npitfalls and avoided them.\n\nHe saw the grand prize which was\n\nhis for the effort and the determination\n\nto keep clean and give the public\n\nbetter than an even break. And the\n\npublic was only too glad to play along\n\nwith him. ,, ^\n\nThe man Dempsey was for his two\n\nfights with Gene Tunney bids fair to\n\nstand unmatched as a box oflicc attraction.\n\nIt was Dempsey who made\n\nthe first fight in Philadelphia with its\n\n2.000.000 dollars gate. And in spite of\n\nhis loss of the championship in the\n\ndrizzle at Philadelphia, it was Dempsey\n\nwho made the second battle with\n\nTunney, and the 102.000 crowd and\n\n2,600,000 dollars receipts at Chicago.\n\nAt this writing it looks as if Dempsev's\n\nrecord as a popular champion\n\nwill stand unrivalled. It looks as if\n\nhis record will roll along through the\n\nyears without a parallel, and in the\n\niong run become almost legendary.\n\nOf course, it Is quite likely that the\n\nfuture will bring out another superman\n\nof the ring and give him a set of\n\nachievements which will displace those\n\nof Dempsey even as Dempsey's accomplishments\n\ndisplaced the marks and\n\nattainments of Sullivan, Corbett, Fltzsimmons\n\nand Jeffries.\n\nBut at this time. Jack Dempsey\n\nstands out as the fighter of the decades,\n\nthe most popular of all champions,\n\nthe beau Ideal and the one and\n\nonly.\n\nThis story Is a tribute to Dempsey\n\nhimself, and written with the hope that\n\nits pages will build in some boxer the\n\ndetermination to go on even as Dempsev\n\nwent on, and give to the future a\n\nDempsey of its own.\n\nrT was onlv four vears after he i\n\nW&t.'SrSS\n\n1 \"'6 \"\"\" oiici\n\nhe had gained prominence as .\n\na fighter, that Jack Dempsev\n\ntho\n\nkic\n\nattained the height of his\n\nambition—a championship bout\n\nwith Tew Willard H. nverwith\n\nJess VWllard. tie oveithrew\n\nthe giant Kansan on\n\nJulv\n\nand there\n\n4. 1919,\n\nstarted\n\nat Toledo,\n\nhis record-breaking\n\nperformances. Never before and had then a\n\nchampionship in the heavvweight division\n\nchanged hands in so few rounds,\n\nThe story of how Dempsey battered\n\nWillard into submission and made him\n\nquit during the intermission between\n\nthe third ana fourth round, will be told\n\nelsewhere, but suffice it to say here that\n\nnever before or after was a champion\n\nso thoroughly whipped as was Willard. a\n\nfhe'wm'ard 'bo\\u'sur7ed'Dem'psey on\n\nthe road to fame and fortune The\n\nSSf.

From then on. .\n\nJack Dempsey lived in a new world. He \"\n\nhad cleared the stain that had followed\n\nhim for many years, and. todav. he is to\n\nthe present-day fight fans what the\n\npopular John L. Sullivan was in the\n\nbare-knuckle and skin-tight gloves' 1\n\nperiod.\n\nAlmost overnight, the attitude\n\nof the public changed to- ;\n\nwards Dempsey, and when he '\n\nlost the title to Gene Tunney,\n\na wave of popularity set in that ;\n\nwas almost astounding. And\n\nthat wave has continued\n\nthrough the years.\n\nStrange though it may seem.\n\nJack Dempsey in defeat was the\n\nhero of the hour. That is how\n\nfickle fortune goes! The under\n\ndog is always the subject of sympathy,\n\nand in this case the attitude of Gene\n\nTunney towards the public helped to\n\nmake Dempsey the popular idol.\n\nFrom then on, the name of Jack\n\nDempsey became synonymous with\n\npopularity. So much so that the public\n\ndemanded he come back, and this he\n\ndid. He fought Tunney a second time,\n\nnnd what happened then is ring his-;\n\ntory. Had Tunney not been given what;\n\nIs commonly known as the \"long count,\" •\n\nJack Dempsey might have accomplished!\n\nwhat never before has been done—re-]\n\ngained the world's heavyweight championship.\n\nLOST CROWN THROUGH\n\nTECHNICALITY\n\nN\n\nO sports idol ever attained the\n\n» , h hero worship of Jack Dempsey,\n\nand all because the public i\n\nfelt he had won the championship\n\nand failed to get the crown through a\n\ntechnicality. Today, there is not a\n\nsportsman alive, with the exception of\n\nLindbergh, who commands such public\n\nattention as Jack Dempsey.\n\nHe has earned more money in the\n\nring than any fighter of all time. He\n\nhas shown his magnetic power by\n\ndrawing past the gates more people\n\nthan any other fighter.\n\nHe has brought more money\n\ninto the fight game than ever\n\nhad been dreamt would be\n\nspent <0 see boxing matches.\n\nBe drew almost 10,000,000\n\ndollars in bouts staged for\n\nhim by the late Tex Rickard\n\nand earned for himself close to\n\n4,900,000 dollars. What other\n\nfighter can boast of such a\n\nrecord?\n\nIn the eight years from 1019 to l 927 .\n\nDempsey defended his laurels successfully\n\nfive times, and only one of the\n\nmen lasted the route. That distinctio!\n\nwent to Tommy Gibbons.\n\nIn 1920 Dempsey knocked out Billy\n\nMiske in three rojinds at Benton Starbor,\n\nand that same winterhe knocked\n\nout Bill Brennan in the old Garden in:\n\n'\"M^Wnassa Mauler engaged\n\nM country in many years, when he set a\n\nrecord for attendance and receipts in\n\nthe bout In which he knocked- out\n\nGeorges Carpentier in four rounds at\n\nBoyle's Thirty Acres, Jersey City.\n\nOn September 14, 1923, he put Luis\n\nFlrpo away at the Polo Grounds in\n\ntwo hectic rounds, and beat Gibbons in\n\nfifteen rounds at Shelby, Montana,\n\nJuly 4, 1923, on points.\n\nf^EMPSEY developed naturally as a j\n\nfighter.

Col-1\n\nhunt through the town's documents\n\nfor Jack Dempsey's birth certificate.\n\nHe located it, and it shows that Jack\n\nwas christened William Harrison\n\nDempsey, and that he was born in\n\nManassa, Conejes County, on June 24,\n\n1895. The town record also shows that\n\nhis ancestry is native American, both\n\nhis parents hailing from West Virginia.\n\nHis father, Hiram, came rroin hardy\n\nIrish stock, his ancestors hailing from\n\nCountv Kildarc, Ireland. Jack Dempsey's\n\nfiery spirit, his love for battle and\n\nthe ability to conquer, are traced to his\n\nfighting Irish and Indian In his blood.\n\nHiram Dempsey married Cella Smoot,\n\nof Logan County, a member of the\n\nfamous Smoot clan of that territory, a\n\nsecond cousin of the then senior senator\n\nof Utah. She followed the blood lines\n\nof the Scotch and Irish on her father's\n\nside and the Cherokee Indian on her\n\nmother's. Her mother was half-\n\nIndian.\n\nHis parents are listed as of Mormon\n\nfaith, and the records show that they\n\nkept this faith for a long time. Jack,\n\nin his younger days, also was listed as\n\na Mormon.\n\nDempsev attributed to the Indian\n\nblood in him his roving spirit and his\n\nstoicism under punishment. The hardiness\n\nof his father and mother has\n\nalways been in evidence in the former\n\nchampion. The blood of the American\n\npioneer stock—the stock that dared to\n\ncross the Alleghanies and the Sierras,\n\nthe stock that built the vast far Western\n\nEmpire, made Jack the great\n\nfighter he was.
