        "text": "GLASGOW WARRIORS have announced the signing of 14-times capped Australian back-row Jack Dempsey for an undisclosed period of time. The 26-year-old joins the club following seven seasons with Super Rugby side the Waratahs, during which time he has scored eight tries in 44 appearances for the New South Wales outfit.\n\nDempsey is 6’3”, weighs 17 stone and is comfortable playing across the back row. “I’m very excited to be starting the next phase of my professional rugby career in Scotland with Glasgow Warriors for the upcoming 2021-22 season,” he said of his new career path.\n\n“Departing NSW was an incredibly tough decision. It’s a club I have spent my entire professional career since joining at the end of 2014. The Waratahs allowed me to develop as a rugby player on my home soil and represent my state, which has meant the world to me over the past seven seasons. I leave with very fond memories of the players, coaches and fans and wish the team, coaching staff and entire organisation the best of success.\n\n20-year-old Jack Blain signs contract extension with Edinburgh\n\nScotland v Wales reaction: Gregor Townsend laments poor discipline\n\nScotland v Wales: Scotland player ratings\n\n“However, the move to Glasgow presents such a different challenge both in lifestyle and rugby, and personally it feels like the right time to take that challenge head-on.\n\n“It’s a club with such a rich and long history and I’m looking forward to joining their campaign and working with Danny Wilson and the team.”\n\nWarriors head coach Danny Wilson said: “Jack is a really exciting addition to our squad. For a 26-year-old he’s very experienced, having made almost 50 appearances for the Waratahs and earning 14 caps for his country.\n\n“Jack can play across the back row and is extremely dynamic, a great ball-carrier and an impressive defender, who gets over the ball and jackals well.\n\n“We’ve been looking to strengthen our back-row options for next season and Jack is just the man to do that.\n\n“We’re looking forward to having him at Scotstoun next season.”\n\nDempsey made his Australia debut against Italy in Brisbane during the summer of 2017, and was on the winning side in each of his first six games for his country, including the team’s 23-18 victory over New Zealand in October 2017.\n\nHis last cap was against Georgia during the pool stage of the 2019 World Cup in Japan."
