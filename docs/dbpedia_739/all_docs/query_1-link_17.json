        "text": "I received an email from Gustavo and Maria in #Argentina this week. They'd seen me on YouTube and want to live and work in Bundaberg. Gustavo said he's an electrician and professor, and Maria is a chef. It's fantastic that people from around the world want to live in our beautiful region. I didn't have the heart to tell them their rugby team isn't as good as the Wallabies, but my office replied in Spanish that I'll be pleased to meet them if they come to #Bundaberg and they'll be most welcome.\n\nYesterday I caught up with the Friendly Society Private Hospital's new CEO, Simone Finch, who has started in the role with great energy and enthusiasm. We're lucky the Friendlies have been delivering pharmacy and medical care in Bundaberg for over a hundred years. Private hospitals play an important role in giving people a choice and taking pressure off the public system. I'm especially pleased the Friendlies started up their emergency department a few years ago. We've had a chronic shortage of GPs in Bundaberg for too long now, causing strain on the Base Hospital and their hard-working nurses and doctors. I wish Simone and her team all the best. I'd also like to thank all our nurses, doctors and paramedics for the amazing work they do under sometimes difficult circumstances.\n\nI checked out the RACQ fuel price app this morning and the prices in Bundaberg ranged from 173.9 cents a litre to 185.9. It certainly pays to shop around. Unfortunately, petrol prices are likely to remain high because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. For unleaded petrol (regular or premium grades) and diesel the price you pay includes Australian Government fuel excise, set at 44.2 cents per litre, as at February 2022. Most of the money raised goes toward roads and infrastructure. That’s a good thing but with rising petrol prices the Government is likely to exceed its targeted revenue of $49.3 billion in net fuel excise over the next four years. I’d like to see the amount of tax scaled back when the median fuel price hits $1.50 a litre. It would be great to see something like this introduced in the Federal Budget on 29 March. The fuel excise is an important revenue source to fund vital services but shouldn’t be a tax cow to fill government coffers when the price rises for exceptional reasons.\n\nBeef comes from cattle, lamb comes from sheep and bacon from pigs. Most of us know this to be true but clever marketing from plant-based protein manufacturers is stretching the truth, confusing consumers and undermining Australian livestock producers. Visit the supermarket now and shoppers are presented with an array of processed vegan products made to look like meat. A Senate Committee is currently considering submissions and evidence in relation to the definitions of meat and other animal products. I hope the committee recommends changes to ensure truth in labelling and the Government acts on those recommendations. There’s nothing wrong with vegans eating plant-based food that’s processed to taste like meat, if that’s what they want to do. The cropping industry also benefits from this emerging market, which is good for those producers. The fundamental issue here is truth. Using words like meat, lamb and pork to describe processed plant-based food should not be allowed and the use of livestock images in their marketing should be prohibited. It’s also a concern that Australian livestock producers are having their brands hijacked after paying millions in levies over decades for research and marketing. The new entrants are often foreign companies who are piggybacking on the hard work of Australian farmers. As one of the livestock industry representatives said recently, it’s plain wrong for plant-based processors to use the word “meat”. “We deem that as like the makers of Rolex sitting around the same table with the guys who sell the $5 Rolexes on the beach at Phuket.” On top of this, Australian taxpayers are funding CSIRO research into alternative foods while the ACCC has blindfolded itself and says there’s nothing to see. The Government needs to address these issues in the interests of Australian #livestock producers and consumers."
