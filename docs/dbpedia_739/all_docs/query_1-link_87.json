        "text": "Jack Dempsey is one of the rising stars of Australian rugby.\n\nSoon after his 21st birthday, the gifted back-rower was awarded his first NSW Waratahs cap when he took the field against the Sharks.\n\nSoon thereafter, he signed a full contract with the Waratahs that will see him part of head coach Darrell Gibson’s squad through to the end of the 2017 season.\n\nDempsey, who attended Sydney’s St Ignatius College (Riverview), had been under the notice of the NSW Waratahs since he represented Australian Schoolboys and the Australian Under 20 teams.\n\nHis ability to reach Super Rugby ranks at such a young age has been helped along by his early baptism in first-grade club rugby with Gordon.\n\nOutgoing NSW Waratahs head coach and current Wallabies head coach Michael Cheika has played a major role in Dempsey’s development.\n\nHe chose him in a Waratahs development squad that toured Argentina last year and also included him in the NSW Waratahs Sevens team that played matches in Ireland and England.\n\nAt age 23, Jack made his international debut for the Wallabies against South Africa. In his third test, Jack started in the back row against South Africa.\n\nThe nephew of former Wallabies back-rower Tony Dempsey, Jack Dempsey is studying for a Bachelor of Sports and Exercise Management at the University of Technology when time permits away from his fast-developing rugby career.\n\nJack Dempsey is managed by The Fordham Company"
