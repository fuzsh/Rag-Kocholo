        "text": "The region’s strong economic growth may seem a happy accident however Bundaberg Regional Council, through strategic infrastructure investment, has given the region’s boom a billion dollar boost.\n\nAmid the region’s strongest economic growth in 16 years this strategic investment in key infrastructure has played an important role in propelling the economy forward.\n\nFor the second year in a row, the Bundaberg Region is experiencing the second highest economic growth rate in Queensland, tracking just behind the Sunshine Coast.1\n\nOver the last seven years, Bundaberg Regional Council has continued to strategically invest in community infrastructure to a value of more than $700 million.\n\nRecently economic calculations by Profile ID and Council revealed that this Council investment had contributed an additional $1.53 billion to local economic activity in that time.\n\nPut another way, the Bundaberg Region economy is now $1.53 billion bigger than it would have been without Council investment.\n\nThis shows that for every dollar Council invests in infrastructure, 2.1 dollars of local economic activity is created.\n\nAdditionally, during the construction phase of these projects, Council supported 568 local jobs and, when complete, added a permanent impact of $13.9 million every year to the economy, and 72 permanent ongoing jobs.\n\nMayor Jack Dempsey said the economic impact expanded beyond the physical roads and facilities.\n\n\"It’s about setting the foundation for sustainable growth, attracting businesses, fostering innovation, and establishing a community where opportunities are created,” Mayor Dempsey said.\n\n“The relationship between infrastructure investment and economic prosperity cannot be overstated.\n\n“The gains we’re experiencing in economic output, the creation of jobs, and the enhancement of quality of life in the Bundaberg Region are not incidental, but the intentional outcome of funds invested wisely.”\n\nHe said ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of a Council was crucial to mainatining these economic advantages for the benefit of local communities, but as the Local Government Association of Queensland had highlighted, the current allocations of Federal Assistance Grants to Councils were insufficient.2\n\n“I will continue to advocate for the restoration of Federal Assistance Grants to at least 1%, to ensure that we can continue to fund projects and services that Council provides, and that our communities rely on.\n\n“It’s an investment in our ongoing success and in the future of our beautiful region.”\n\n1 NEIR, 2023.\n\n2 LGAQ, 2023"
