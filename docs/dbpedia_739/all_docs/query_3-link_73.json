        "text": "Although boxing has been relegated to niche status in the United States, it is so firmly rooted in America’s sporting consciousness that the country continues to produce myriad world champions to complement the sport’s robust history of legendary figures. Here, we consider the greatest fighter, by birth, from each state in the Union.\n\nFor decades, boxing, along with horse racing and baseball, was central to American sporting life. The world’s heavyweight champion was the most accomplished, celebrated and famous figure in sports, and fights sold out ballparks, stadiums and arenas — or had massive structures built specifically to accommodate them.\n\nTime passed, and the landscape shifted.\n\nSomehow, despite often being mired in scandal and comically corrupt politics, boxing perseveres, even if the likes of the NFL, NBA and NCAA football and basketball have long since surpassed it. But as popular as America’s marquee leagues have become, they will never match boxing’s fascinating, rich and quirky history.\n\nThe sheer diversity of the United States is a key contributing factor to the quality of boxers it consistently produces, as immigrants and first-generation Americans from every continent have made names for themselves Stateside and waded into the cauldron of cities like New York, Detroit and Philadelphia to test themselves against the best competition in the world.\n\nA few notes about our list: There’s a significant difference between a fighter merely being born somewhere and the location of their boxing upbringing. For the sake of this list, we have opted to go with birthplace, which is why Thomas Hearns, for example, is our entrant for Tennessee, even though he has historic ties to Detroit’s fabled Kronk Gym. Also, while there are clear discrepancies in talent from state-to-state, we have simply listed them alphabetically; to rank where the greatest concentration of elite fighters hail from is another task entirely.\n\nWith that, we invite you to scrutinize our selections and offer comments and alternatives. Boxing’s history is complicated and layered, so there’s plenty of room for debate.\n\nObscure boxing states\n\nUnfortunately, not every state has a storied boxing history or a deep talent pool to draw from for rankings such as this one. While copious amounts of research was conducted in preparing this piece — including a consultation with boxing historian Patrick Connor of Knuckles and Gloves (amongst other outlets) to confirm that finding a worthy fighter born in, say, Alaska was virtually impossible — some states remained elusive.\n\nAlaska: Because it is geographically isolated from every state in America, securing marquee bouts is difficult for any fighter based in Alaska. In fact, the state has only played host to a select number of professional fight cards, although Hector Camacho did box there in 1983. David Carey, a 2008 U.S. Olympic team member (although he did not box in the Games) was a standout amateur and is a longtime Alaska resident who now runs a boxing academy in Anchorage. (Carey was a pro prospect but had to retire due to injuries before joining the paid ranks.)\n\nNew Hampshire: The only recognizable name from research conducted into New Hampshire’s boxing history was Nottingham’s Jason LeHoullier (21-7-1, 8 KOs), a journeyman who fought for a slew of minor and regional titles during his career and faced the likes of Carson Jones, Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. and Peter Quillin.\n\nNevada: Nevada, because of Las Vegas, has a practically unmatched boxing tradition. Curiously, though, the state itself hasn’t produced an abundance of elite fighters. While the likes of Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Mike Tyson call (or have called) Nevada home, it tends to be a state boxers migrate to. That said, Ishe Smith (29-8, 12 KOs) is the first Las Vegas-born boxer to win a world title, and Nevada does have a brighter future to look towards with the likes of WBO super bantamweight champion Jessie Magdaleno (24-0, 17 KOs) still emerging. Also, the state is home to female champion Melinda Cooper (23-3, 11 KOs) and 1932 Olympian Joseph Lang. Notable officials from Nevada include Mills Lane (a 1960 NCAA boxing champion) and Richard Steele, who boxed on the U.S. Marines squad.\n\nNorth Dakota: Had this list not categorized boxers by birthplace, 1984 Olympic silver medalist and light heavyweight stalwart Virgil Hill (51-7, 24 KOs) would have been an easy selection. Hill, who was born in Missouri, boxed out of Williston, North Dakota, and had his farewell fight in Bismarck. Over a remarkable career spanning 58 fights, Hill went 24-5 (7 KOs) in world championship bouts.\n\nSouth Dakota: Shawn Hawk (23-3-1, 17 KOs), a member of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, stands out as a notable fighter from South Dakota (Sioux Falls, specifically). Hawk had a reported 108-12 amateur record, and as a pro he challenged then-WBO light heavyweight champion Nathan Cleverly on short notice in 2012 and was stopped in eight rounds. Hawk has not fought since.\n\nWyoming: Ryan Brieske, who fought out of Gillette, Wyoming, was an alternate on the 1996 U.S. Olympic team and made the state’s list of its 50 greatest sports figures (these lists were done by Sports Illustrated in 1999). As a pro, though, Brieske only went 6-1 (6 KOs) before retiring in 2000. Interestingly, on July 4, 1869, Wyatt Earp organized Wyoming’s most famous boxing match — a bout between Mike Donovan and John Shanssey.\n\nAnd now, the rest of our list — in alphabetical order.\n\nAlabama: Joe Louis\n\nPlace of birth: La Fayette\n\nProfessional record: 66-3, 52 KOs\n\nNotes: It’s fitting that the individual entries on this list start with legendary heavyweight champion Joe Louis, one of the greatest fighters in boxing history and a man who transcended sports to become an icon and inspiration to African-Americans, as well as a unifying force on the precipice of World War II.\n\nLouis’ records and accolades speak for themselves: 25 consecutive defenses of his title — a record that still holds up to this day as the standard for any division in boxing; a nearly 12-year reign as heavyweight champion — also a record; he was named The Ring‘s Fighter of the Year on four occasions (1936, 1938, 1939 and 1941); and he is generally regarded as one of boxing’s greatest pure power punchers.\n\nDespite his infamous “Bum of the Month” club, Louis shared the ring with fellow luminaries like Rocky Marciano, Jersey Joe Walcott, Billy Conn, Ezzard Charles, John Henry Lewis, Jimmy Bivins and, famously, German Max Schmeling. Having lost to Schmeling in 1936 by knockout in Ring magazine’s fight of the year, Louis avenged his defeat via punishing first-round knockout in one of boxing’s truly transcendent events as the world headed towards war. Eventually, Louis and Schmeling became friends — a testament to both their characters.\n\nAlthough Louis struggled financially later in life and would eventually succumb to cardiac arrest after suffering from pugilistic dementia, he remains a uniquely indelible figure in a sport filled with them.\n\nArizona: Michael Carbajal\n\nPlace of birth: Phoenix\n\nProfessional record: 49-4, 33 KOs\n\nNotes: Few light flyweights have ever been as dynamic or packed as much dynamite in their fists as Michael Carbajal, who clearly stands out from a relatively thin list of fighters born in Arizona. But Carbajal, who was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2006, was a genuinely great fighter who just happens to be perpetually overlooked because he competed at 108 pounds.\n\nWith a record of 15-3 (10 KOs) in world title fights and 9-4 (5 KOs) against other world champions, Carbajal consistently faced top opposition during his extended run at the elite level. Carbajal was known by the moniker “Manitas De Piedra” (“Little Hands of Stone”) — an homage to Roberto Duran but also a testament to his worth as a fighter. Case in point: In 1994, The Ring named Carbajal the greatest light flyweight ever, which marked a symbolic culmination of the talent he oozed after claiming silver at the 1988 Olympics as part of one the greatest ever U.S. boxing squads.\n\nOne interesting fact about Carbajal’s career that’s both refreshing and aberrant is that he retired with a meaningful win. His last fight, which took place in June of 1999, was a TKO victory over then-emerging world champion and all-action star Jorge Arce. Ironically, Carbajal was named The Ring‘s Comeback Fighter of the Year following that movie-worthy swan song — a fitting end to a remarkable career.\n\nArkansas: Sonny Liston\n\nPlace of birth: Johnson Township\n\nProfessional record: 50-4, 39 KOs\n\nNotes: Few fighters have ever possessed as potent a left jab — not to mention as fearsome a scowl — as former heavyweight champion Sonny Liston. One of boxing’s true marquee intimidators, Liston made opponents quaver and cultivated a demeanor that preceded famous fear-inspirers like Mike Tyson and Aaron Pryor.\n\nThe bulk of Liston’s accomplishments came before his ultimately brief stint as the world’s heavyweight champion, although his two one-round decapitations of Floyd Patterson created an aura of invincibility the likes of which few fighters have ever had the honor — and burden — of carrying. Some of Liston’s other marquee wins included stoppages of Nino Valdes, Wayne Bethea, Zora Folley, Albert Westphal, Roy Harris, Mike DeJohn and Cleveland Williams (twice).\n\nOf course, Liston is unfortunately best remembered for the role he played in the rise of Muhammad Ali. When they first fought, Ali (then Cassius Clay) was a massive underdog and admitted later to being terrified of Liston; however, in a shocking turn of events, Liston was made to quit, and in the rematch, Ali would land his infamous “phantom punch” to score a first-round knockout that is still debated to this day.\n\nListon would fight on in relative obscurity (given his peak status) after these contests, and the circumstances surrounding his death remain mysterious. In fact, when Canadian champion George Chuvalo signed to fight Liston in 1970, the embattled former champion had been dead for a week.\n\nCalifornia: Manuel Ortiz\n\nPlace of birth: Corona\n\nProfessional record: 100-28-3, 54 KOs\n\nNotes: Manuel Ortiz was one of the greatest ever bantamweight champions and one of the fighters who defined the 1940s. In 1942, Ortiz defeated Lou Salica to win the World Bantamweight Title, which he would go on to defend 15 times during his first historic reign.\n\nThat initial stint as champion — a dominant five-year stretch — included a remarkable eight title defenses in 1943 alone. When one considers the sporadic activity level of contemporary boxers, Ortiz’s 1943 campaign could incredibly stand by itself as Hall of Fame-worthy credentials. Although Ortiz would lose his title to Harold Dade in 1947, he would, like so many legendary champions, reclaim it in a rematch and go on to retain it five more times before losing to Vic Toweel in 1950.\n\nInterestingly, Ortiz was the first fighter entered into BoxRec’s online database, which means he has the global I.D. of “1”. Ortiz, who served in the U.S. Army, unfortunately died from cirrhosis of the liver at age 53 after living in destitution — a tragic end for a legendary champion.\n\nColorado: Jack Dempsey\n\nPlace of birth: Manassa\n\nProfessional record: 54-6-9, 44 KOs (4-0-2, newspaper decisions)\n\nNotes: Jack Dempsey — “The Manassa Mauler” — attained celebrity status that few fighters can fathom. Simply put, Dempsey, at his peak as World Heavyweight Champion between 1919 and 1926, was the most revered sporting figure in America. Dempsey, in a literal rags to riches story, went from hopping trains and sleeping in hobo camps to participating in boxing’s first five million-dollar gates.\n\nDempsey is also credited with advancing boxing from a stylistic standpoint. His aggression, power punching in fluid combinations and the resulting brutal knockouts set a new benchmark for how to thrill and entertain audiences that sometimes exceeded 100,000. This combination of boxing chops, charisma and the emergence of mainstream celebrity culture in the United States made Dempsey one of those rare figures seemingly destined for his time and place.\n\nIn boxing, greatness is largely contingent on indelible moments — win or lose — and Dempsey had a plethora of them. His wild title defense against Argentine Luis Firpo, which saw Dempsey knocked out of the ring before he rallied to stop Firpo, inspired George Bellows’ iconic painting. His knockout of Georges Carpentier was the first bout to be broadcast to a mass radio audience (as well as boxing’s first ever million-dollar gate).\n\nDempsey famously lost his last fight to Gene Tunney in a contest that featured the infamous “long count”. But even in defeat, Jack Dempsey confirmed that he was larger than life — and that no fight, or count, could encapsulate all he represented.\n\nConnecticut: Willie Pep\n\nPlace of birth: Middletown\n\nProfessional record: 229-11-1, 65 KOs\n\nNotes: Unanimously considered to be one of the greatest pure boxers of all-time and the best featherweight to ever don a pair of gloves, Willie Pep, at only 20 years of age, won the NYSAC World Featherweight Championship and would go on to amass a record of 134-1-1 before losing the title to fellow legend Sandy Saddler, which precipitated the start of one of boxing’s bitterest rivalries.\n\nIn their second fight, Pep reclaimed his title via 15-round unanimous decision, although Saddler would ultimately prove to have his number. Tellingly, The Ring, in 1997, ranked their final encounter — which saw Pep succumb via ninth-round retirement — as the sixth dirtiest fight in boxing history. However, despite finding his kryptonite in Saddler, Pep’s two title reigns and stylistic virtuosity secured him an unimpeachable legacy.\n\nInterestingly, Pep’s legend also extends to boxing’s rich apocrypha. There’s a newspaper article by Don Riley (though some speculate it was written by Pep himself) alleging that Pep won a round in his 1946 fight against Jackie Graves without throwing a punch. Whether fact or fib, Willie Pep seems like the only boxer who could have accomplished such a feat.\n\nDelaware: Dave Tiberi\n\nPlace of birth: New Castle\n\nProfessional record: 22-3-3, 7 KOs\n\nNotes: With fewer than a million inhabitants, the state of Delaware has never been a boxing hotbed. As such, Dave Tiberi, a middleweight contender during the 80s and 90s, tops the list of the best fighters to emerge from this minuscule mid-Atlantic state despite never winning a world title. However, far from being a mere moral victor, Tiberi should have been crowned IBF 160-pound champion on February 8, 1992.\n\nTiberi, a 10-1 underdog, stepped up to challenge James Toney, who was the defending champion and sported a 28-0-2 record heading into the fight. With Toney emerging as one of the sport’s best boxers, the Tiberi bout was viewed as nothing more than a tune-up. However, in what appeared to be a stunner, Tiberi clearly bossed the fight despite a point deduction in round six for a low blow. The scores, though, would tell a different, overtly corrupt story: Tiberi lost a split decision, winning 117-111 on one card, which was embarrassingly overruled by two verdicts of 115-112.\n\nIn the bout’s aftermath, an investigation led by Senator William Roth of Delaware into corruption in boxing revealed that two of the judges were unlicensed in New Jersey. Tiberi was offered a rematch and a far more lucrative purse — as well as a share of the pay-per-view revenue — but he declined on principle, insisting that he be allowed to enter the ring as the rightful champion he knew he was. Although he retired in his mid-20s, Tiberi is hailed as the world champion Delaware deserved, even if two bogus scorecards suggest otherwise. (Two other Delaware fighters who had intriguing careers that are worth exploring are Wilmington Jack Daly and Willie Roache.)\n\nFlorida: Roy Jones Jr.\n\nPlace of birth: Pensacola\n\nProfessional record: 64-9, 46 KOs\n\nNotes: When it comes to pure physical gifts and sheer raw athleticism, no contemporary fighter can come close to touching Roy Jones Jr. This isn’t to say that Jones is not a sophisticated boxer — far from it; rather, it’s merely meant to emphasize the extent of his raw talent — a combination of blistering speed, concussive power and inhuman reflexes that reduced foes to helpless, plodding punching bags.\n\nIt’s no surprise, then, that Jones became the first ever middleweight champion to win a portion of the heavyweight title. Along the way, he became a dominant light heavyweight and out-classed the slick and skilled James Toney at 168 pounds when both were undefeated. But more than even his iconic victories, Jones will be remembered for jaw-dropping displays of boxing brilliance, like when he played possum against Glen Kelly with his hands held behind his back, evading punches until he sprung forward to the end the fight with a single blow.\n\nAlthough he continues to fight for somewhat mysterious and ultimately futile reasons, nothing –not even the harrowing knockouts suffered in recent years — can remotely erase the memories of a fighter who helped define the pound-for-pound concept.\n\nGeorgia: Sugar Ray Robinson\n\nPlace of birth: Ailey\n\nProfessional record: 173-19-6, 108 KOs\n\nNotes: Although the nature of pound-for-pound rankings implies subjectivity, as well as degrees of both uncertainty and skepticism, the argument that Sugar Ray Robinson is the greatest fighter of all-time is almost impossible to counter. Robinson was a seemingly perfect pugilist — a master boxer and devastating puncher — who reigned as both welterweight and middleweight champion, while earning 1950s Fighter of the Decade honors from The Ring.\n\nRobinson was such an exceptional fighter that he’s generally regarded as arguably the best welterweight and middleweight ever (or at least hovering around the top spot in both divisions). In an era with fewer than half the weight classes that now litter boxing’s current landscape, this is an even more remarkable accomplishment.\n\nRobinson’s epic six fights with Jake LaMotta — of which Sugar Ray won five, including the infamous St. Valentine’s Day Massacre — is the sort of rivalry that’s quite literally no longer possible. LaMotta was the first man to defeat him, but after that initial setback, Robinson would go on to reel off 91 straight victories. While he may have fought on too long, consider this: When Robinson first retired after losing to Joey Maxim in 1952 in an unsuccessful bid for the light heavyweight title (a fight Robinson was winning before he succumbed to heat exhaustion), his record was 131-3-2. Enough said.\n\nHawaii: Carl ‘Bobo’ Olson\n\nPlace of birth: Honolulu\n\nProfessional record: 97-16-2, 46 KOs\n\nNotes: Former middleweight champion Carl ‘Bobo’ Olson was named Fighter of the Year for 1953 by The Ring, a defining stretch that saw him finally emerge from the spectre of Sugar Ray Robinson, who had already stopped Olson in 1950 (KO 12) and defeated him by decision in 1953 (UD 15). Although Robinson would later knock Olson out on two more occasions in middleweight title fights, the Hawaiian would first leave his own mark on the 160-pound division.\n\nOlson filled the gap of Robinson’s initial retirement by decisioning Randy Turpin to become World Middleweight Champion in 1953 and would go on to make three defenses, including one against the legendary Kid Gavilan. Like Robison, Olson would also jump up to light heavyweight, but when he challenged Archie Moore, he was felled in three rounds.\n\nThose last two stoppage losses to Robinson came shortly after the Moore fight (in 1955 and 1956), and Olson would fight on until 1966 with mixed success. However, by then he had already set a new standard for any emerging boxer from Hawaii. An International Boxing Hall of Fame inductee, Olson died of Alzheimer’s in Honolulu in 2002.\n\nIdaho: Kenny Keene\n\nPlace of birth: Emmett\n\nProfessional record: 51-4, 28 KOs\n\nNotes: Known as “The Emmett Eliminator”, Idaho’s Kenny Keene is a state legend who was a cruiserweight contender with a rugged, brawling style that routinely drew raucous crowds in a state that has never been known as a bastion of the sweet science. And make no mistake, the affable Keene never considered himself a craftsman in the ring: “I was not skilled. I plowed ahead. I may not have been a great boxer or puncher, but I was a good, small-town guy who always plowed ahead.”\n\nKeene held three minor cruiserweight belts during his career — the WBF, IBC and IBA titles. Although he never challenged for a world championship, he consistently faced solid competition, and he amassed a remarkable 43-2 record in fights held in Idaho. In four defeats, Keene was only stopped once — in the final round of the last fight of his career. It was a long road to success, too. When Keene debuted as a 132-pound amateur, he apparently lost nine of his first 10 fights and was told by the state commission that he’d have to stop boxing if he didn’t improve.\n\nKeene did develop, honing his aggressive, determined and frenetic pressure tactics as he rose in weight, claiming a National Junior Olympics title. He would wait for his father’s shift to finish at the sawmill to train together, and it was this humbleness and dedication that allowed Keene to rise to relative prominence and, more importantly, give back to the state that supported him so unconditionally: “I wanted to create not just more boxing fans, but also Kenny Keene fans.” Kenny Keene demonstrated, unequivocally, that success in prizefighting can’t solely be measured by wins, losses or world titles.\n\nIllinois: Packey McFarland\n\nPlace of birth: Chicago\n\nProfessional record: 70-0-5, 50 KOs (36-1-1, newspaper decisions)\n\nNotes: With an undefeated record (excluding newspaper decisions), lightweight Packey McFarland is one of boxing history’s more curious cases because he never won, or even challenged for, a world title. And yet, in his seminal book The 100 Greatest Boxers of All Time, the cigar-chomping, fedora-clad historian Bert Sugar rated McFarland at 32. High praise indeed.\n\nSome of McFarland’s notable victories include triumphs over Jack Britton (who would eventually claim the welterweight title), Freddie Welsh (a win and, later, two draws) and Jimmy Britt (who faced six future Hall of Famers over 10 fights in a career that only spanned 23 contests) just to name a select few. Oh, and McFarland accomplished all this by the time he was 26.\n\nDespite retiring just as he was entering his athletic prime, the sterling record McFarland had amassed proved more than enough to earn him enshrinement in the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Although he died at age 47, McFarland enjoyed lucrative success in brewing and contracting ventures, and he stayed connected with boxing, mentoring Barney Ross and working with the Illinois Athletic Commission.\n\nIndiana: Tony Zale\n\nPlace of birth: Gary\n\nProfessional record: 67-18-2, 45 KOs\n\nNotes: Two-time lineal middleweight champion Tony Zale is remarkable for a myriad of reasons. For starters, he’s one of the rare elite fighters who sustained more defeats during the first half of his career — when he was an emerging contender — than when he ascended to the elite level. He also served in the Navy during World War II, meaning, despite being the reigning champion, he didn’t box for four years (1942-1946). And then, of course, there’s the matter of his genuinely epic trilogy with Rocky Graziano, which took place in a mere 21-month span.\n\nZale won the National Boxing Association Middleweight Title with a stoppage of Al Hostak in 1940. He would defend that title, while adding the NYSAC championship to his haul in 1941, four times, culminating in his first bout against Graziano. Zale would triumph in that remarkable contest — The Ring‘s 1946 Fight of the Year — after absorbing a hellacious beating before rallying for the stoppage. The rematch, which was 1947’s Fight of the Year, saw the reverse happen — with Graziano fighting back from the brink to halt the champion.\n\nZale would regain the championship in the rubber match via third-round knockout, putting a definitive stamp on one of boxing’s most brutal, iconic and thrilling rivalries. Even though Zale would lose the title in his final fight, he didn’t go out quietly. Instead, in characteristic fashion, he took on all-time great Marcel Cerdan. Zale was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1991.\n\nFrankfort’s Jack Dillon (94-8-15, 66 KOs), who held a (sometimes disputed) claim to the World Light Heavyweight Championship between 1914 and 1916 also deserves a mention. Despite only standing 5’7.5″, the stout “Jack the Giant Killer” was unanimously recognized as one of his era’s most explosive fighters.\n\nIowa: Michael Nunn\n\nPlace of birth: Davenport\n\nProfessional record: 58-4, 37 KOs\n\nNotes: After compiling a sensational 168-8 amateur record and narrowly missing out on qualifying for the 1984 Olympics, Iowa’s Michael Nunn embarked on a professional career that would see him become a two-weight champion at 160 and 168 pounds. At middleweight, particularly, Nunn displayed a combination of skills and punching power that had fans and pundits pegging him for a sustained run as a pound-for-pound stalwart.\n\nDuring his reign as IBF and lineal middleweight champion, Nunn’s impressive victories included his first-round, Knockout of the Year evisceration of Sumbu Kalamby in 1989, stoppages of champions Frank Tate and Donald Curry, and decisions over Marlon Starling and Iran Barkley. One fight, though, that could have enhanced Nunn’s legacy even further was his shocking knockout loss to James Toney, who Nunn was soundly outboxing by scores of 97-93, 98-92 and 99-91 when a Toney left hook detonated against Nunn’s jaw in the eleventh and a follow-up barrage — after Nunn had somehow risen — prompted a stoppage.\n\nNunn, however, would bounce back and claim the WBA and lineal super middleweight titles, making four successful defenses. But despite all this in-ring success, life after boxing would prove tragic for Nunn. He is currently incarcerated for buying a kilogram of cocaine from an undercover agent and is slated for release in 2024.\n\nKansas: Jess Willard\n\nPlace of birth: Pottawatomie\n\nProfessional record: 22-5-1, 20 KOs (3-2-1, newspaper decisions)\n\nNotes: From sheer size and power-punching standpoints, former World Heavyweight Champion Jess Willard would have found himself right at home amongst the giants that populate the contemporary landscape of boxing’s glamor division. Although sometimes relegated to a transitional footnote in boxing history, the 6’6″ “Pottawatomie Giant” was the man who ended Jack Johnson’s title reign.\n\nWillard was a hellacious hitter who scored knockouts in all but two of his wins. While he wasn’t the boxing savant that so many others in these rankings were, Willard did particularly well considering he turned professional at 29 after hoping to cash in by exploiting his size in the prize ring. Billed as a “white hope”, Willard defeated similarly hyped contenders and developed a rabid following as he worked his way towards the shot at Johnson, which took place in Havana, Cuba, in 1915.\n\nIn sweltering heat, Willard stalked and outmuscled the somewhat lethargic champion, scoring a historic knockout in the twenty-sixth round of a scheduled forty-five. Willard would earn a newspaper decision victory in his only successful defense, which came against Frank Moran, setting the stage for his bout against Jack Dempsey.\n\nIn one of the most savage beatings in boxing history, Dempsey floored Willard seven times in the opening round, cracking the champion’s skull, fracturing his jaw and shattering his ribs; Willard, though, wouldn’t quit. He somehow made it through rounds two and three on his feet before he was mercifully pulled out of the contest — his defeat final but his courage unquestioned.\n\nKentucky: Muhammad Ali\n\nPlace of birth: Louisville\n\nProfessional record: 56-5, 37 KOs\n\nNotes: It seems wrong to try and encapsulate anything about Muhammad Ali — who passed away this year — with such brevity. Ali was more than a boxer; he was a cultural icon, a symbol for peace, social justice and defiance of the establishment, and he was one of the greatest boxers of all-time — a gifted pugilist and poetic trash-talker who somehow possessed the skills to back up his gift of gab.\n\nThe facts and statistics of Ali’s career hold up against any ring legend’s and, frankly, surpass most: a gold medal at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, Italy; a three-time lineal World Heavyweight Champion (the only man to accomplish such a feat in boxing’s glamor division); 22 victories in heavyweight title fights and 19 successful defenses over two title reigns. What’s also particularly impressive is that Ali’s 19 defenses were evenly split (nine during his first reign, 10 during his second). And don’t forget that Ali was prevented from boxing during his athletic prime due to his courageous anti-Vietnam War stance.\n\nAli’s impact on boxing history, however, extends far beyond mere numbers. His rivalry with Joe Frazier is arguably the greatest ever, and his knockout of the seemingly invincible George Foreman in “The Rumble in the Jungle” is one of the all-time upsets and indelible moments in modern sports. Unlike most athletes today, Ali was also a man of profound convictions, standing up against institutionalized racism and inequality (amongst other things). He spoke eloquently and with passion, and he eventually won over the public by never compromising his values.\n\nAli’s passing has left a gaping chasm in areas that extend far beyond boxing — a chasm that cannot, and should not, ever be completely bridged.\n\nLouisiana: Tony Canzoneri\n\nPlace of birth: Slidell\n\nProfessional record: 137-24-10, 44 KOs (4-0, newspaper decisions)\n\nNotes: Few resumes in boxing history can match Tony Canzoneri’s. During a career that stretched from 1925 to 1939, Canzoneri faced 18 world champions and six future Hall of Famers over his 171 fights, and he became only the second fighter to ever win championships in three weight classes, capturing world honors at featherweight, lightweight and junior welterweight.\n\nParticularly impressive was Canzoneri besting fellow legend Jack ‘Kid’ Berg in their trilogy. After Berg had won a 10-round decision in their first contest in 1930, Canzoneri would rebound to dominate and flatten Berg in three frames a year later to win the lightweight and junior welterweight titles. Only five months removed from that triumph, Canzoneri would again best Berg, this time via 15-round unanimous decision in a fight that featured a controversial foul from Canzoneri — who scored a legitimate knockdown in round one — in the eighth, prompting the raucous crowd of 18,000 to protest the alleged injustice against Berg.\n\nOther standout names on Canzoneri’s ledger include Kid Chocolate, Barney Ross, Jimmy McLarnin and Johnny Dundee, to name a very select few. Canzoneri shared The Ring‘s 1934 Fighter of the Year honors with Ross, and he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\nMaine: Joey Gamache\n\nPlace of birth: Bath\n\nProfessional record: 55-4, 38 KOs\n\nNotes: Joey Gamache is the only boxer from Maine to ever win a world title, which he accomplished in 1991 with a stoppage of Jerry Ngobeni to claim the WBA strap at 130 pounds. Gamache would vacate the title without defending it and move up to lightweight, where he would also win the WBA championship by knockout — this time against Chil-Sung Jun. At that point, in June of 1992, Gamache was 29-0 and a two-weight champion.\n\nHowever, Gamache would lose his lightweight title in his first defense when Tony Lopez stopped him in the eleventh round of a fight Gamache was edging. Gamache diligently worked his way back into title contention, which included an NABF title-winning effort against Jeff Mayweather, only to get blitzed in two rounds by Orzubek Nazarov in a bid to reclaim his old belt. Still, Gamache persevered, winning 19 of his next 20 contests — his only defeat coming to legend Julio Cesar Chavez — to set up the controversial final act of his career.\n\nIn February of 2000, Arturo Gatti, who dangerously outweighed Gamache on the night of their fight, scored a frightening knockout that sent Gamache into retirement. Gamache sued Gatti and the New York State Athletic Commission, and while he was not awarded any damages, negligence was found in the handling of weigh-in process. Gamache, though, deserves to be remembered for far more than the Gatti loss, and the former champion has found success in retirement training boxers, including Military Champion Boyd Melson.\n\nMaryland: Joe Gans\n\nPlace of birth: Baltimore\n\nProfessional record: 145-10-16, 100 KOs (13-2-5, newspaper decisions)\n\nNotes: Although he died of tuberculosis at only 35, Joe Gans is considered be one of the greatest pound-for-pound fighters of all-time, embodying his moniker of “The Old Master” via a scientific approach to prizefighting. Although he fought in an era defined by institutionalized racism and segregation, Gans became the first American-born black man to win a world title.\n\nGans achieved this groundbreaking feat in 1902 when he knocked out Frank Erne, who had previously defeated him, in a single round. Prior to this win, which saw him become the undisputed World Lightweight Champion (and his first fight against Erne), Gans had only been able to challenge for the “colored” version of the title. In fact, Gans, as well as other elite black fighters, were often prevented from facing white opponents or pressured into carrying them, fixing fights or accepting meagre purses.\n\nHowever, Gans, who is part of the rare 100 knockouts club, practically held the lightweight title hostage until consecutive knockout losses to Battling Nelson (in 17 and 21 rounds) in 1908. Gans was revered by fellow luminaries like Sam Langford, Benny Leonard and Bob Fitzsimmons, and he was also a character in Ernest Hemingway’s 1916 short story “A Matter of Color”. Despite his untimely demise, Gans managed to symbolize and embody hope for African Americans, all while forging one of boxing’s most storied legacies.\n\nMassachusetts: Sandy Saddler\n\nPlace of birth: Boston\n\nProfessional record: 145-16-2, 104 KOs\n\nNotes: It’s curious to note that Sandy Saddler was knocked out in his second professional fight, especially because it would be his only stoppage defeat in a career that spanned 161 bouts, 145 victories and 104 knockouts — the latter distinction placing him the rarefied air of the 100 knockouts club.\n\nWhen Saddler finally earned a featherweight title shot after 93 fights, he upset fellow legend Willie Pep via stunning fourth-round knockout (Saddler was a 3-1 underdog). This would begin one of boxing’s great rivalries, with Pep winning the return bout via fifteen-round unanimous decision, only for Saddler to emerge victories on two more occasions. However, their fourth contest was so foul-filled that Pep lost his boxing license and Saddler was suspended indefinitely. Still, Saddler had emerged from their rivalry with three victories — and three wins inside the distance.\n\nSaddler’s last featherweight title fight — against Flash Elorde — was actually a win (TKO 13), so his final reign as champion never ended in defeat. Unfortunately, Saddler was forced to retire due to a detached retina, and he sadly suffered from dementia later in life. Still, Saddler’s legacy as one of the three (or so) greatest featherweights had been long-since secured, and he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\nMichigan: Stanley Ketchel\n\nPlace of birth: Grand Rapids\n\nProfessional record: 51-4-4, 48 KOs (2-1-1, newspaper decisions)\n\nNotes: Stanley Ketchel’s “The Michigan Assassin” moniker does indeed befit one of the hardest punchers, pound-for-pound, in boxing history. Ketchel was also an all-time great character — the embodiment of Wild West brawling and adventuring. After fleeing home at 14 for a vagabond life, Ketchel ended up in Montana where he honed his explosive punching power, working as a barroom bouncer and taking on challengers in spectacles at a local theatre.\n\nEventually, though, Ketchel turned to professional boxing. Explosive knockouts of twins Mike and Jack Sullivan propelled Ketchel into a bout against Billy Papke, with whom he would forge a bitter rivalry. Over four fights — all for the World Middleweight Title — Ketchel would win three, including a 20-round decision to end matters in 1909. Interestingly, Papke accounted for two of Ketchel’s three wins where he was extended the distance.\n\nNo stranger to Herculean challenges, Ketchel used his third triumph over Papke as a springboard to challenge heavyweight champion Jack Johnson. While some speculate Johnson was told to carry the relatively diminutive Ketchel, there was nothing staged about Ketchel’s flooring of Johnson with a right hand in round 12, which only prompted the “Galveston Giant” to rise and drop Ketchel for the count moments later.\n\nAmazingly, Ketchel accomplished all of this by the time he was 24. With so much left to give the sport, Ketchel was senselessly murdered by Walter Dipley, a ranch hand, who was supposedly jealous of his girlfriend’s attraction to Ketchel — a tragically poetic end to a torrid life.\n\nMinnesota: Tommy Gibbons\n\nPlace of birth: Saint Paul\n\nProfessional record: 56-4-1, 48 KOs (40-1-3, newspaper decisions)\n\nNotes: The city of Saint Paul boasts a proud boxing tradition, and although Tommy Gibbons never won a world title, he’s a worthy entrant for the state of Minnesota. Gibbons faced the best from his era, leapfrogging from middleweight right up to heavyweight, and he’s the only man to last the 15-round distance with ring immortal Jack Dempsey. The other fighters who managed to best Gibbons? Harry Greb, Billy Miske and Gene Tunney — with Tunney being the only man to knock Gibbons out.\n\nBut Gibbons was far more than a gifted boxer and punishing puncher who compiled a glittering record while ultimately coming up short against the absolute best. Gibbons owns two newspaper decision wins over the aforementioned Greb, and he also bested Georges Carpentier, Battling Levinsky and Miske, who he faced five times.\n\nAlthough he went the distance with Dempsey, befuddling the champion with slick boxing and defense, he failed to muster any significant offense. In BoxRec’s encyclopedia entry for Gibbons, you’ll note that a disappointing live gate led to the three banks of Shelby, Montana, going belly-up to cover Dempsey’s purse, leaving nothing for Gibbons. In other words, Gibbons, a truly great fighter, had to settle for the most harrowing of moral victories.\n\nMississippi: Henry Armstrong\n\nPlace of birth: Columbus\n\nProfessional record: 151-21-9, 101 KOs\n\nNotes: Although Henry Armstrong came of age in Missouri, our criterion of selecting fighters based on birthplace for this list means he edges out light heavyweight legend Archie Moore in Mississippi. (Armstrong, frankly, is one of only a handful of fighters who rank ahead of the “Old Mongoose” historically.) One of the greatest pound-for-pound fighters of all-time, Armstrong holds the unique an unmatched distinction of simultaneously holding three undisputed championships when there were only eight weight classes — a feat he accomplished in 1938.\n\nA member of the vaunted 100 knockouts club, “Homicide Hank” was one of boxing’s most dynamic pressure fighters — a whirlwind of hooks and uppercuts who would chop and saw overwhelmed opponents into submission. A champion at featherweight, lightweight and welterweight, Armstrong left his most indelible mark at 147 pounds — his reign beginning in 1938 when he sent legend Barney Ross into retirement. Armstrong would defend the World Welterweight Championship 19 times, which is a division record.\n\nIt’s frankly impossible to do Armstrong’s career a modicum of justice in such limited space, but just consider some of these inimitable numbers: a record of 59-1-1 (51 KOs) between December 1936 and October 1940; five welterweight title defenses in a 21-day span in October of 1939; 16 world champions bested. Numbers don’t reveal all, but with Henry Armstrong, they provide compelling and unimpeachable evidence that has kept him firmly planted as one of the three best fighters to ever step inside the ring.\n\nMissouri: Michael Spinks\n\nPlace of birth: Saint Louis\n\nProfessional record: 31-1, 21 KOs\n\nNotes: Brothers Michael and Leon Spinks both captured gold medals at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal as members of arguably the greatest ever U.S. boxing squad. But while Leon would enjoy a meteoric rise to (fleeting) heavyweight stardom, it was Michael who would go on to have a Hall of Fame career as a two-division champion, forging a legacy as one of the greatest light heavyweights of all time.\n\nSpinks became the class of a compelling era of 175-pounders, with wins over Eddie Mustafa Muhammad, Dwight Muhammad Qawi and Eddie Davis earning him the WBA/WBC/IBF titles. Spinks remained undefeated as a light heavyweight, and his overall record in world title fights was 14-1 (with 9 KOs) with a mark of 7-1 (2 KOs) against other world champions. While his vaunted right hand — The Spinks Jinx — was his calling card, Spinks possessed exceptional boxing skills.\n\nUnfortunately, Spinks is best remembered for being knocked out by Mike Tyson in a single round in their rabidly anticipated heavyweight unification fight, which proved to be Spinks’ final bout. However, what’s far more significant is that when Spinks moved up to heavyweight, he became the first reigning light heavyweight champion to win top honors in boxing’s glamor division — a feat even the incomparable Archie Moore could not accomplish. Although his two fights with Larry Holmes were razor close decisions, Spinks etched his name in boxing lore, all while further cementing his standing amongst light heavyweight legends.\n\nMontana: Marvin Camel\n\nPlace of birth: Ronan\n\nProfessional record: 45-13-4, 21 KOs\n\nNotes: A member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Indian Reservation, Marvin Camel represented the state of Montana with pride and distinction, making cruiserweight history along the way. In fact, Camel was the first fighter to win both the WBC and IBF 200-pound titles in the newly created division, technically making him the first ever world champion in one of boxing’s sadly overlooked weight classes.\n\nCamel initially fought Mate Parlov to a draw for the WBC title in 1979, but he would win an immediate rematch the following year. However, Carlos De Leon would upend Camel in his first defense and would also stop him in a 1982 return bout. Undaunted, Camel worked his way back into contention and used winning the USBA regional title as a springboard to fighting for the newly sanctioned IBF strap. Camel defeated Roddy MacDonald in Halifax, Nova Scotia, by stoppage to become a two-time champion.\n\nEarlier in his career, Camel split a pair of bouts against Matthew Saad Muhammad, and he ended his run as a professional as a well-traveled, universally respected fighter. Camel would often wear an eagle-feathered headdress in honor of his heritage, and in 2006, at the WBC convention, he was awarded “honorary champion” status.\n\nNebraska: Terence Crawford\n\nPlace of birth: Omaha\n\nProfessional record: 30-0, 21 KOs\n\nNotes: Terence “Bud” Crawford, at 29, is in the midst of his athletic prime and is still forging his legacy; however, Crawford, a two-weight champion, unified titlist and pound-for-pound entrant, has already accomplished enough to be hailed as the greatest fighter form Nebraska, which also happens to be the state where former heavyweight champion Max Baer was born.\n\nWith a 7-0 (4 KOs) record in world title fights and a 3-0 (1 KO) mark against other champions, Crawford has demonstrated a willingness to face elite competition since he claimed his first major belt — the WBO lightweight strap — by traveling to Scotland to dethrone reigning titlist Ricky Burns. Crawford dominated the fight, which set up an explosive, star-making defense against Cuban dynamo Yuriorkis Gamboa. Struggling to deal with Gamboa’s speed early, Crawford eventually settled into the fight and turned it into a scientific brawl, flooring Gamboa four times before stopping him in the ninth.\n\nThe Gamboa fight showcased what makes Crawford special — effective and seamless switch hitting, preternatural ring calm, the ability to box and brawl in equal measure, elite ring IQ and that undefinable willingness to seize a moment that only great fighters possess. Since the Gamboa fight, Crawford has moved up to 140 pounds, where he most recently outclassed fellow champion Viktor Postol to unify the WBC and WBO titles. Crawford figures to eventually move up to welterweight, and many are hoping he lands a shot at Manny Pacquiao. Fortunately for boxing fans, there is so much left of Terence Crawford’s journey to relish.\n\nNew Jersey: Marvelous Marvin Hagler\n\nPlace of birth: Newark\n\nProfessional record: 62-3-2, 52 KOs\n\nNotes: Despite ending his storied career as one of the greatest middleweights — and fighters — ever, Marvelous Marvin Hagler had to earn things the hard way. He did not turn professional with fanfare or the momentum of an Olympic appearance, and he had to grind through 49 bouts against top contenders to finally earn a middleweight title shot, which frustratingly resulted in a controversial draw against WBA/WBC champion Vito Antuofermo.\n\nHagler, though, would rebound and win the unified titles in September of 1980, after which he would embark on a historic reign at 160 pounds. Revenge against Antuofermo would come in 1981, but Hagler is best known for his association with boxing’s “Four Kings”. Hagler would defeat lightweight legend Roberto Duran by unanimous decision in 1983, and his three-round stoppage of Thomas Hearns in what is simply known as “The War” is unanimously viewed as an all-time thriller — nine (or so) minutes of impossibly brutal action.\n\nHagler’s final fight, a defeat to Sugar Ray Leonard that is still discussed and debated to this day, was a fascinating contest that saw Leonard come out of retirement to challenge the seemingly invincible middleweight champion. Although Hagler vehemently disputed the verdict, his legacy, which includes a 13-1-1 (12 KOs) record in title fights, was already secure, and he has enjoyed a luxurious retirement in Italy and has even starred in action movies.\n\nNew Mexico: Johnny Tapia\n\nPlace of birth: Albuquerque\n\nProfessional record: 59-5-2, 30 KOs\n\nNotes: First of all, the great Bob Foster was actually born in Texas. A three-weight, five-time world champion, Johnny Tapia — the tattooed, back-flipping dynamo from Albuquerque — was a dominant fighter in boxing’s lower weight classes in the 1990s, all while battling substance abuse and mental health issues that would have completely derailed a less resilient individual.\n\nIn fact, Tapia’s career, just as it appeared to be flourishing, was nearly cut short when, in 1990, he tested positive for cocaine following a fight and was suspended indefinitely, leading to a three-and-a-half year exile just as a world title shot seemed within his grasp. Tapia, though, would rebound and stop Henry Martinez in 1994 to win the WBO junior bantamweight title, which he would hold for a remarkable four years and 13 defenses. During this reign, Tapia would score a defining victory: a unanimous decision over fellow Albuquerque native Danny Romero to unify the WBO and IBF titles.\n\nShortly after, Tapia would move up to bantamweight and claim the WBA title, only to lose it in his first defense against Paulie Ayala, who later bested Tapia in a non-title rematch. Tapia claimed a couple more belts and would also lose a marquee bout against Marco Antonio Barrera, but his remarkable resume — 17-1-1 (6 KOs) in world title fights and 11-3 (2 KOs) against other champions — and especially his victory over Romero, made him the standard-bearer for New Mexico boxing. Sadly, Tapia succumbed to heart failure precipitated by the onset of Hepatitis C at 45 — a tragic end to both a troubled and triumphant life.\n\nNew York: Benny Leonard\n\nPlace of birth: New York City\n\nProfessional record: 89-6-1, 70 KOs (96-16-7, newspaper decisions)\n\nNotes: New York City has arguably the most storied tradition of pugilism of any major American urban center, and competition from the state is fierce when it comes to producing elite boxers of historic significance. And yet, all-time great Benny Leonard, who reigned as World Lightweight Champion from 1917-1925 stands out as the greatest fighter ever to be born in the state that used to be the spiritual pulse and home of prizefighting in the United States.\n\nOf Leonard’s six career non-newspaper decision losses, three came within the first year of his career. As such, once Leonard claimed the lightweight throne by knocking out Freddie Welsh in a virtuoso performance, he was virtually untouchable; consider, too, that the Welsh bout was a No Decision 10-rounder, which meant that Leonard could only claim the title if he stopped Welsh. Leonard’s dynamic victory would indeed serve as a sign of things to come. Amazingly, Leonard never lost his lightweight title, opting for abdication after defeating the likes of Rocky Kansas and Lew Tendler on multiple occasions, as well as several other top contenders.\n\nLeonard would lose a couple of marquee forays into heavier weight classes when he was disqualified against Jack Britton in 1922 in a bid for the World Welterweight Title, and also at the end of his comeback in 1932 by Jimmy McLarnin. That said, Leonard’s seven-year lightweight championship reign remains a record, and only the incomparable Roberto Duran has been able to supplant Leonard as the best to ever rule the division. In the 1920s, Leonard only failed to match Jack Dempsey in popularity, and he was part of the inaugural 1990 induction class at the International Boxing Hall of Fame.\n\nNorth Carolina: Sugar Ray Leonard\n\nPlace of birth: Wilmington\n\nProfessional record: 36-3-1, 25 KOs\n\nNotes: In a sense, Sugar Ray Leonard’s remarkable professional career was never supposed to happen. After claiming a gold medal at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal as part of arguably the greatest ever U.S. boxing squad, Leonard intended to retire and pursue his education at the University of Maryland; however, his mother suffered a heart attack and his father struggled with various ailments, leading Leonard to turn pro to help support his family. What would follow was a resume that led to Leonard being named Fighter of the Decade for the 1980s by The Ring.\n\nThis is particularly incredible when one recalls that Leonard was forced to retire due to a detached retina in 1982; in fact, Leonard missed nearly five years of the 1980s and still emerged as the decade’s defining champion, carrying the torch from Muhammad Ali as the sport’s transcendent star. What made Leonard so great, though, was his consistent insistence on accepting Herculean challenges. Consider this: BoxRec’s encyclopedia entry for Leonard notes that between November 1979 and September 1981, Leonard fought Wilfred Benitez, Roberto Duran (twice), Ayub Kalule and Thomas Hearns, who combined for a 177-1-1 record when Sugar Ray fought them.\n\nAnd don’t forget about the myriad of iconic moments Leonard produced — from the “No Mas” rematch against Duran, to his late rally to stop Hearns in their classic first encounter, to ending a three-year retirement to dethrone middleweight legend Marvin Hagler. Leonard was 10-2-1 (8 KOs) in title fights and 7-3-1 (5 KOs) against other champions, and he held titles in five weight classes. But Leonard was about far more than statistics because, like almost no other fighter, he sought out greatness at every turn.\n\nOhio: James J. Jeffries\n\nPlace of birth: Carroll\n\nProfessional record: 19-1-2, 16 KOs\n\nNotes: Famously known as “The Boilermaker”, James J. Jeffries was a revered heavyweight champion who, despite fewer than 25 professional fights, dominated his era and cut an image of rugged, hulking strength that the public idolized. In a career that lasted from 1895-1904 — with a brief and infamous final act in 1910 — Jeffries defended the World Heavyweight Title seven times and competed in nine bouts against future hall of famers.\n\nJeffries holds wins over luminaries James J. Corbett (1900 and 1903), Bob Fitzsimmons (1899 and 1902), Peter Jackson (1898) and Tom Sharkey (1898 and 1899). After Jeffries’ retirement as an undefeated champion, he was held in such esteem that racial pressure led to him being dusted off to challenge Jack Johnson, the first black World Heavyweight Champion, in 1910.\n\nJohnson outclassed and stopped Jeffries, although “The Boilermaker” was well past his prime. Still, Jeffries admitted Johnson was the superior fighter, and the entire spectacle (and debacle) of this event exemplified the racism that both boxing and America were mired in at the time.\n\nWhile Jeffries was certainly a titan of boxing’s early history, special mention must be given to Cincinnati’s Aaron “Hawk” Pryor, who passed away this year. Pryor (39-1, 35 KOs), whose awesome power, intimidating scowl and frenetic, overwhelming style allowed him to rule the junior welterweight division to the tune of an 11-0 record in title fights, won two decisive victories over Nicaraguan great Alexis Arguello to cement his Hall of Fame credentials.\n\nOklahoma: Eddie Cotton\n\nPlace of birth: Muskogee\n\nProfessional record: 56-23-2, 33 KOs\n\nNotes: Although Oklahoma doesn’t boast a storied boxing history, the state can make a case that it should be home to a unified light heavyweight champion in Eddie Cotton, a respected, defensively sound contender who fought as a professional between 1947 and 1967. Cotton faced many of his era’s best, and he was narrowly defeated in two world title challenges.\n\nCotton’s first major opportunity came in 1961 when he faced master technician Harold Johnson for the National Boxing Association World Light Heavyweight title, dropping a split decision. It would take Cotton five years — and a win over Henry Hank for the “Michigan version” of the World Light Heavyweight Title — to earn another shot at top honors, this time against WBC/WBA boss Jose Torres. In The Ring ‘s 1966 Fight of the Year, Cotton was on the wrong end of a hotly contested unanimous verdict.\n\nTowards the end of his career, Cotton would lose to legend Bob Foster, and he also fought Archie Moore, Sixto Rodriguez (of Fat City fame) and Peruvian great Mauro Mina, amongst others. In retirement, Cotton, who embodied the classic competent and crafty elite contender, worked for the Boeing Aircraft Company, the Washington State Boxing Commission and owned a restaurant in Seattle.\n\nOregon: Denny Moyer\n\nPlace of birth: Portland\n\nProfessional record: 98-38-4, 25 KOs\n\nNotes: A true technician with the gumption to fight anyone, Portland’s Denny Moyer enjoyed both impressive longevity and success at the elite level in a career that lasted from 1957-1975. The early phase of Moyer’s career would see him fight and beat the likes of Sugar Ray Robinson, Emile Griffith and Benny “Kid” Paret (Moyer would fight Griffith and Robinson multiple times). These bouts came after Moyer had lost a World Welterweight Title fight against Don Jordan as a 21-bout novice, but even in defeat he proved he belonged in the sport’s upper echelon.\n\nMoyer would claim a world title, though, when he defeated Joey Giambra to win the inaugural WBA title at junior middleweight. Two fights later, Moyer would add the WBC belt to his collection to become a unified champion. However, he would lose both titles in his next fight against Ralph Dupas via split decision, and an immediate rematch saw Moyer drop a unanimous verdict. By then, in 1963, Moyer was already a 46-fight veteran.\n\nIn characteristic fashion, Moyer would persevere and impressively launch another assault at a world title, this time at middleweight. Moyer captured the NABF 160-pound title and rode a 14-fight unbeaten streak into a bout against WBA/WBC middleweight champion and future hall of famer Carlos Monzon in Rome, Italy — a remarkable nine years after his last major title fight. Although he was stopped in five rounds, the sheer will to claw his way back to contention confirmed Moyer’s legendary status in Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania: Harry Greb\n\nPlace of birth: Pittsburgh\n\nProfessional record: 107-8-3, 48 KOs (155-9-15, newspaper decisions)\n\nNotes: Whenever boxing in Pennsylvania is mentioned, the conversation inevitably shifts to Philadelphia’s lore. However, it is Pittsburgh’s Harry Greb — the World Middleweight Champion from 1923-1926 and American Light Heavyweight Champion from 1922-1923 — who clearly distinguished himself as the greatest fighter born in his state. Greb, known as “The Pittsburgh Windmill” for his frenetic, swarming style, fought nearly everyone in a talent-laden era, rising in weight for seemingly impossible challenges.\n\nAlthough Greb is best remembered for his dominance at middleweight, he is also the only man to defeat Gene Tunney. In 1922, Greb wrested Tunney’s American Light Heavyweight Title, bludgeoning, cutting and soundly defeating the champion by unanimous decision. The rematch resulted in a disputed split decision for Tunney in what many felt was a robbery; Greb and Tunney would face off a total of five times.\n\nOf all the other luminaries Greb faced, legend and then-welterweight champion Mickey Walker — who Greb defended his middleweight title against in a bout that featured torrid action, including a brutal second stanza — would also become inextricably linked to the Pittsburgh man. Greb won a decision, but the apocryphal story is that the fight continued later on at a nightclub with Walker flooring Greb via an alleged sucker punch. Although Greb died at 32, his fighting spirit is supported by numbers that are almost impossible to fathom given how boxing’s landscape has shifted: 45 fights in 1919 alone, and16 hall of famers faced over 48 bouts, with a 33-9-6 ledger against these all-time greats.\n\nPart of the International Boxing Hall of Fame’s inaugural 1990 class, Greb was also willing to face elite black fighters when so many others refused.\n\nRhode Island: Vinny Pazienza\n\nPlace of birth: Cranston\n\nProfessional record: 50-10, 30 KOs\n\nNotes: Few fighters have been able to persevere like Rhode Island’s Vinny Pazienza — officially Vinny Paz since 2000 — who survived a fractured neck from a car accident to mount one of the more improbable second acts to a career in contemporary boxing history. A two-weight champion, Pazienza incredibly won world championships 20 pounds apart — claiming the IBF lightweight title against Greg Haugen in 1987 and the WBA junior middleweight strap from Gilbert Dele four years later.\n\nThose would prove to be Pazienza’s only two victories in major championship fights, but the story of his career goes far beyond his 2-6 (1 KO) mark in such contests. In fact, Pazienza went 8-7 (2 KOs) against other champions, besting the likes of Harry Arroyo, Luis Santana, Lloyd Honeyghan and even Roberto Duran (twice). Most remarkable, though, was his challenge of IBF super middleweight champion Roy Jones Jr. in 1995.\n\nFrankly, Pazienza should not have been alive at that point. The aforementioned car accident that fractured his neck left him in a head and neck brace with a halo for support, but he managed to work his way back into title contention and earn The Ring‘s Comeback of the Year award in 1991. Jones would ultimately stop Pazienza in six rounds, but the “Pazmanian Devil” would dust himself off and earn another title shot in 2002, losing to Canadian Eric Lucas. Vinny Paz’s legacy transcends wins and losses, making him a larger than life figure from America’s tiniest state.\n\nSouth Carolina: Joe Frazier\n\nPlace of birth: Beaufort\n\nProfessional record: 32-4-1, 27 KOs\n\nNotes: Although indelibly linked to Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier’s legacy is far greater than being relegated to the B-side of boxing’s most storied rivalry. A gold medalist at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, Frazier’s rise as a professional initially coincided with Muhammad Ali’s suspension from boxing due to his anti-Vietnam War stance and refusal to enter the U.S. Army; Frazier, in fact, supported Ali in his struggle for justice.\n\nIn Ali’s absence Frazier would claim the NYSAC World Heavyweight Title in 1968 before gaining unanimous recognition as champion with a stoppage of Jimmy Ellis in 1970. Frazier’s greatest moment, though, would come two fights later. In a bout worthy of being labelled “The Fight of the Century”, Frazier won a unanimous decision over Ali, flooring “The Greatest” with the most famous left hook in boxing history in round 15 to punctuate a defining triumph.\n\nFrazier would defend the title two more times before running into the juggernaut that was a prime George Foreman. Although Frazier would never regain the title, he bravely fought on, losing two times to Ali but producing a transcendent trilogy. “The Thrilla in Manila”, perhaps the greatest fight ever, featured brutal action and drama, including Eddie Futch mercifully pulling Frazier out of the bout before the final round, saying, “It’s all over. No one will forget what you did here today”. Indeed, Joe Frazier, who died in 2011 at age 67, was integral in defining an iconic era — the likes of which boxing fans will never see again.\n\nTennessee: Thomas Hearns\n\nPlace of birth: Memphis\n\nProfessional record: 61-5-1, 48 KOs\n\nNotes: The power Thomas Hearns was able to harness in his right hand seemed impossible given his scrawny frame, especially when the 6’1″ “Hitman” campaigned at 147 and 154 pounds. Hearns was a member of the 1980s’ “Four Kings”, but he, like each member of that vaunted group, forged a legacy that extended beyond Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler and Roberto Duran.\n\nWith a record of 15-4-1 (9 KOs) in world title fights and a 13-5-1 (8 KOs) mark against other champions, Hearns compiled one of the more impressive resumes in contemporary boxing history. Interestingly, Hearns became the first fighter to win championships in four weight classes (welterweight, junior middleweight, middleweight and light heavyweight), and he broke his own record when he claimed top honors at 168 pounds. Remarkably, Hearns rose through 50 pounds worth of weight classes during his career (he briefly competed at cruiserweight).\n\nOf course, Hearns is remembered for the part he played in “The War” with Hagler — the greatest three rounds in boxing history. However, his knockouts of Pipino Cuevas and the aforementioned Duran were chilling and spectacular. While Hearns bested a slew of elite champions, he came up short (at least officially) against Sugar Ray Leonard in two memorable fights — an absolute classic in 1981 where Hearns was leading but stopped in round 14, and a controversial draw at 168 pounds in 1989 where Hearns decked Leonard twice and deserved to win.\n\nTexas: Jack Johnson\n\nPlace of birth: Galveston\n\nProfessional record: 56-11-8, 35 KOs (15-0-3, newspaper decisions)\n\nNotes: On December 26, 1908, Jack Johnson broke boxing’s heavyweight color barrier; by beating Canadian Tommy Burns, Johnson captured the World Heavyweight Title, which had become synonymous with a view of white strength and superiority grounded in ingrained prejudice and overt institutionalized racism. It was a watershed moment in American sports, and Johnson’s defiance of customs — including his liaisons with white women — was groundbreaking.\n\nJohnson was also a gifted technician and ring craftsman who outboxed, befuddled and humiliated opponents. During his title reign, the “Galveston Giant” defeated notable opponents like Philadelphia Jack O’Brien, Stanley Ketchel, Fireman Jim Flynn and, famously, former champion and ring legend James J. Jeffries, who was trotted out of retirement to win the title back for the “white race”. Johnson outclassed and knocked Jeffries out in 15 rounds in one of the most significant fights in boxing history.\n\nBecause Jack Johnson was ahead of his time, he helped, in his own way, to advance it. Boxing’s lengthy and complicated history allows for connections to be made that span decades and vastly different eras; in this sense, it is necessary to say that Johnson — by challenging the discrimination and racism of his time, by being such a brilliant boxer and by crafting a unique celebrity persona — paved the way for Muhammad Ali.\n\nUtah: Gene Fullmer\n\nPlace of birth: West Jordan\n\nProfessional record: 55-6-3, 24 KOs\n\nNotes: For most elite middleweight boxers of Gene Fullmer’s era, the spectre of Sugar Ray Robinson loomed too large. Robinson, who is as close to unanimously recognized as the greatest ever pound-for-pound fighter as one can get, ran roughshod over the 147 and 160-pound divisions. Fullmer, though, managed to emerge victorious from their four-fight rivalry.\n\nIn 1957, Fullmer defeated Robinson via unanimous decision to win the World Middleweight Title, only to get knocked out by Sugar Ray in the fifth round in his first defense three fights later. Fullmer, however, would rebound, regaining the championship from hall of famer Carmen Basilio, who he would defeat a second time prior to what looked like a rubber match against Robinson –except the fight ended in a draw. In their fourth and deciding match, which immediately followed their third encounter, Fullmer prevailed by unanimous decision.\n\nOther than Robinson and Basilio, Fullmer also defeated Benny “Kid” Paret and Paul Pender, as well as a litany of top contenders. Although he would go 0-2-1 over his last three fights, each bout came against the great Dick Tiger and was contested for world titles. Fullmer is one of the few boxers to end his career in exclusively meaningful prizefights, and that, combined with his championship reigns, easily makes him the greatest fighter born in the state of Utah.\n\nVermont: Young Firpo\n\nPlace of birth: Barre\n\nProfessional record: 74-15-4, 43 KOs\n\nNotes: A devastating puncher with a frenetic, pressure style, Young Firpo — or, Guido Bardelli — is one of the more accomplished contenders to never challenge for a major world title. Although he tried to lure Maxie Rosenbloom and Bob Olin into the ring, the fights never materialized. Still, Firpo enjoyed success against some of his era’s sternest competition, as well as immense popularity on the Pacific Coast.\n\nOver the course of his career, Firpo faced the likes of John Henry Lewis, Tiger Jack Fox, Wesley Ketchell, George Manley, Leo Lomski and George Courtney. He also retained the Pacific Coast Light Heavyweight Title for an impressive six-fight run in 1933-34. In 1934, at the culmination of this regional title reign, Firpo did sign to challenge the aforementioned Rosenbloom, but a dispute over Firpo’s percentage of the live gate was bitter enough to derail the fight; unfortunately for Firpo, he sustained injuries in a car accident shortly after.\n\nThere was still interest in a Rosenbloom fight due to the intriguing style matchup, but a proposed non-title affair once Firpo healed did not happen. Even John Henry Lewis, who it is claimed Firpo appeared to best even though their bout was ruled draw, showed little interest in a rematch once he became champion. Although Firpo never landed some of the fights his talent merited, he still forged a remarkable legacy and cult following, especially for a fighter born in Vermont who fought out of Idaho. If anything, the missing piece to the puzzle of Firpo’s career only enhances his legend.\n\nVirginia: Pernell Whitaker\n\nPlace of birth: Norfolk\n\nProfessional record: 40-4-1, 17 KOs\n\nNotes: After winning a gold medal at the 1984 Olympics, Pernell “Sweat Pea” Whitaker would embark on a professional career that saw him become a four-weight champion and one of the greatest lightweights ever (and a fantastic welterweight), all while establishing a new standard for elusive, defensive boxing that managed to both befuddle opponents and leave audiences in awe. At his peak, circa 1993-94, Whitaker was recognized as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world.\n\nWhitaker amassed a record of 19-3-1 (4 KOs) in world title fights with a 14-3-1 (4 KOs) mark against other champions. Interestingly, Whitaker lost his first bid for a major title when, in only his sixteenth contest, he challenged 106-fight veteran Jose Luis Ramirez and dropped a split verdict However, Whitaker would win the IBF title only two fights later and then exact revenge on Ramirez, triumphing in a unification fight via dominant unanimous decision — a result that became as assured as death and taxes during Whitaker’s career.\n\nOne of Whitaker’s most infamous bouts was his absurd draw against Julio Cesar Chavez, who was 87-0 when the two fought in what was obviously touted as a matchup of historic proportions. Although he was robbed of his victory, Whitaker proved he was the superior fighter. And even though Whitaker’s later career brought him three of his four losses and was mired by drug use, he was one of the few ring legends who was never bested in his athletic prime.\n\nWashington: Freddie Steele\n\nPlace of birth: Seattle\n\nProfessional record: 123-5-11, 58 KOs\n\nNotes: Freddie “Tacoma Assassin” Steele was the recognized Middleweight Champion between 1936 and 1938, and his remarkable ring record included only two defeats during the first decade of his career. A skilled boxer with legitimate pop, Steele would go 6-1 in middleweight title fights, all while facing multiple elite contenders in bouts held before and in between.\n\nAs champion, Steele defeated Babe Risko (to win the title in 1936 and again in a defense in 1937), Gorilla Jones, Frank Battaglia, Ken Overlin and Carmen Bath. When Steele lost his title via first-round knockout to Al Hostak with Jack Dempsey refereeing, his sparring partner, Davey Ward, claimed that Steele had entered the ring with a cracked breastbone, which prevented him from keeping a responsible high guard. Still, this stunning loss could not erase all that Steele had accomplished as champion and during his resume-building years.\n\nInterestingly, Steele found some success in Hollywood after he retired, appearing in such films as the Oscar-nominated Hail the Conquering Hero and as Errol Flynn boxing’s stunt double in Gentleman Jim. Steele, though, eventually felt the call to return to the Pacific Northwest, and he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nWest Virginia: Christy Martin\n\nPlace of birth: Bluefield\n\nProfessional record: 49-7-3, 31 KOs\n\nNotes: At her peak, Christy Martin was one of the most famous and respected female boxers in the world, appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated in April of 1996. This came after her Showtime-televised victory over Deirdre Gogarty, which earned Martin the WBC’s “nominal” Female Lightweight Championship (the WBC did not offer belts for women’s open competition at the time).\n\nInterestingly, Martin got into boxing on a dare after being persuaded to enter a Tough Woman competition while still attending university on a basketball scholarship. Martin’s career as a prizefighter would see her face fellow trailblazers Mia St. John (they split a pair of fights), former world boxing and MMA champion Holly Holm and Laila Ali. Later, Martin would fight for the NABF middleweight strap and win the WBC super welterweight title.\n\nIncredibly, Martin survived a brutal attempted murder in November of 2010 when her then-spouse James Martin stabbed her multiple times in the back and shot her. Martin was somehow able to escape and flag down a motorist (who took her to the hospital), and her husband was eventually convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Martin, who is largely responsible for putting women’s boxing on the map and paving the way for the likes of two-time Olympic gold medalist Claressa Shields, now lives with her partner Sherry Lusk.\n\nWisconsin: Tyrone Trice\n\nPlace of birth: Milwaukee\n\nProfessional record: 43-10, 34 KOs\n\nNotes: Wisconsin is not a renowned boxing state, but Tyrone “The Butterfly” Trice emerged from Milwaukee to become a top welterweight and junior middleweight contender in the 80s and 90s. Trice unsuccessfully challenged for world titles on three occasions, but he did hold the WBA Americas welterweight title and IBC strap at 154 pounds. He is also remembered for his feud with multi-weight champion James Toney, even though they never fought.\n\nTrice twice faced Simon Brown for the IBF welterweight title, in 1988 and 1990, losing on both occasions via late stoppage. His third and final crack at world honors would come against WBO junior middleweight champion John David Jackson, who would best Trice in a fairly competitive bout by scores of 116-111 (twice) and 117-110. Interestingly, six of Trice’s 10 career losses would come after the Jackson fight, meaning all but one of his prior defeats came in bouts for major championships. Trice holds solid wins over Kevin Pompey and Rafael Williams, amongst others.\n\nRegarding the Toney feud, Trice, after knocking Ron Collins out in a single round, made a spectacle of calling out Toney, who was seated ringside. In fact, Trice boasted that he could stop Toney inside of 10 rounds, backing up his claims with a brash $50,000 bet, which enraged Toney. The situation escalated as Toney entered the ring, and both men had to be separated. Although Toney would have been a significant favorite to defeat Trice, the promotion would have certainly been spectacular.\n\nMore from FanSided\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
