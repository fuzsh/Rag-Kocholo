Two students, who had never worked together, joined forces due to their complementary skills. Just one year after their initial 60-day startup sprint, they had the chance to showcase their venture at the Big East startup competition. A special shoutout to Lance Frazier for encouraging them to participate. Their entry video is nothing short of remarkable—I'm confident they're on the path to victory. The team's early members, Valery Shafack and Matthew Mandolfo, set a high bar, which was only raised with the strategic addition of Samuel Perkinson. This is a call to local businesses: supporting NIYOU means not just backing Creighton student athletes, but also enhancing your brand. NIYOU is at the forefront of fostering meaningful partnerships between local enterprises and our student athletes. Watch the video, feel the energy, and consider how you can be part of this inspiring journey. #CreightonInnovation #StudentEntrepreneurs #NIYOUJourney #OmahaBusinessSupport #HeiderBusiness #LocalPartnerships #FutureLeaders #CommunityCollaboration #InnovateOmaha\n\nIs #ThrowbackThursday still a thing? Never mind… Don’t answer that. Instead, let’s just take a moment to do what Throwback Thursdays *used* to do for us: They gave us a moment to remember where we came from. We wouldn’t call Startup Week our roots (because before Startup Week, there was Entrepreneurship Week), but it was definitely part of our story for a long time. So even though we’ve said goodbye to Startup Week as our title, we recognize how far it got us! And don't forget to let us know what you would like to get out of Entrepreneurship Week by filling out this short survey!: https://lnkd.in/g7VmkYDS #AlaskaStartupWeek #startupweek #AlaskaEntrepreneurshipWeek #AKEW24 #entrepreneurshipweek"
