        "text": "Former Wallabies loose forward Jack Dempsey is set to tackle his former teammates after being named on the Scotland bench for Sunday's (3.30am AEDT) Test in Edinburgh.\n\nSydney product Dempsey played 14 Tests for the Wallabies between 2017-19 and featured under Michael Cheika at the last Rugby World Cup.\n\nBut the then Waratahs star did not feature for Australia under Dave Rennie and took up an opportunity with Glasgow Warriors - Rennie's former club - in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch every match of the Wallabies spring tour on the home of rugby, Stan Sport. All matches streaming ad-free, live and on demand\n\n\"We've watched him closely while he's been away and he's certainly always been a really good athlete, great with ball in hand,\" Rennie said.\n\n\"We always felt he lacked a little bit of physicality and we gave him that feedback and I know he's worked hard on that and we've seen it prosper and blossom at Glasgow.\n\n\"He's a really good player and I know he'll be keen as to get among our boys, he knows a lot of them really well.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Roos stars separated after heated exchange\n\nREAD MORE: Finch left bemused by legend's Cummins call\n\nREAD MORE: Australia's 'never seen before' $23m tournament\n\nDempsey's grandfather was Scottish and he recently made himself available following changes in World Rugby's international eligibility rules.\n\n\"There's a lot of information to take on board when you're new to a team, but he's adapted well,\" Scotland coach Gregor Townsend said.\n\n\"He's played very well for Glasgow and we want to see his strengths when he comes on.\n\nSean Maloney and Morgan Turinui are joined by Nathan Grey to dissect the final round of the Rugby Championship and reminisce on some stories from their playing days\n\n\"We have lots of players that come from different backgrounds and Jack is part of that inclusive, diverse group we have and we can't wait to see how he does for us.\"\n\nScotland beat the Wallabies 15-13 at Murrayfield last year, which snapped Australia's five game winning streak and triggered a dramatic slide down the world rankings.\n\nBut the Scots are not at full strength given the Test falls outside the official international window and the likes of Stuart Hogg, Adam Hastings, Chris Harris and Josh Bayliss are unavailable.\n\nLock Scott Cummings (broken toe) is also sidelined while classy Racing 92 five-eighth Finn Russell was not picked in a highly controversial move.\n\nTownsend was in Melbourne to watch Australia's heartbreaking 39-37 loss to the All Blacks last month.\n\n\"Although they've not won as many games as they'd have liked, they've shown their quality enough times over the summer to be positive about their northern hemisphere tour,\" Townsend said.\n\n\"(Last year) it was a very tight game, they played well and had come off the back of beating South Africa just before they played us.\n\n\"They also beat South Africa this summer, so they're a quality team.\n\n\"We know Dave Rennie really well and he's always had an attacking philosophy. It will be a big test for us.\"\n\nSCOTLAND (15-1): Ollie Smith, Darcy Graham, Mark Bennett, Sione Tuipulotu, Duhan van der Merwe, Blair Kinghorn, Ali Price, Pierre Schoeman, Dave Cherry, Zander Fagerson, Sam Skinner, Grant Gilchrist, Jamie Ritchie (c), Hamish Watson, Matt Fagerson\n\nReserves: George Turner, Jamie Bhatti, WP Nel, Glen Young, Jack Dempsey, George Horne, Ross Thompson, Damien Hoyland\n\nWALLABIES (15-1): Tom Banks, Andrew Kellaway, Len Ikitau, Hunter Paisami, Tom Wright, Bernard Foley, Tate McDermott, Rob Valetini, Michael Hooper, Jed Holloway, Cadeyrn Neville, Nick Frost, Allan Alaalatoa, David Porecki, James Slipper (c)"
