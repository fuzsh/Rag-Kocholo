        "text": "Last month Kevin Mitchell, The Observer's chief sports writer, nominated his 10 greatest boxers of all time. They were:\n\n1 Muhammad Ali\n\n2 Sugar Ray Robinson\n\n3 Joe Louis\n\n4 Jimmy Wilde\n\n5 Benny Leonard\n\n6 Archie Moore\n\n7 Jack Johnson\n\n8 Sugar Ray Leonard\n\n9 Jack Dempsey\n\n10 Henry Armstrong\n\nWe had an enormous response - here's what some of you felt:\n\nGreb - the champion who trained on whores and whiskey\n\nIt would be hard to relegate any of the fighters from your 10 but one has to go. No pound for pound all time rating is complete without mention of the ol' Pittsburgh Windmill himself, the mighty Harry Greb.\n\nGreb dominated the middleweights at a time when arguably the division was at its strongest. He ducked no one, but plenty ducked him? Jack Dempsey for one (Dempsey was reputedly dropped to the canvas when they sparred). Greb was the only fighter to defeat Gene Tunney, grinding him into the canvas, while dishing out a ferocious beating.\n\nHe wasn't pretty and neither was his ring style. He merely bullied his opponents and, as he was not a particularly concussive hitter, his victories were based on sheer strength of will. When will didn't suffice Greb was the master of the dark arts of thumbing, lacing, butting and the elbow. But he could take it as well as give it.\n\nUpon retirement it became apparent that Greb had been blind in one eye for a significant portion of his career, the result no doubt of a thumb. Greb personified the roaring Twenties and his achievements are all the more impressive when the fact that he trained on whores and whiskey (in that order) is taken into account.\n\nGareth Welch\n\nvia email\n\nKevin Mitchell's selection is excellent and the top three unarguable. It is difficult to separate the others. Wilde, a true great, has been shamefully neglected in Britain. Johnson was much more than a boxer, and socked it to the racists. Chavez's unbeaten run was an immense achievement. There can be no omitting the indomitable, ferocious Hagler. My reserves would include: Monzon, Marciano, Hearns and Duran.\n\nJohn Davies\n\nBrecon, Powys\n\n1 Sugar Ray Robinson, 2 Jack Johnson, 3 Muhammad Ali, 4 Joe Gans, 5 Roberto Duran, 6 Joe Louis, 7 Jimmy Wilde, 8 Joe Walcott [not Jersey], 9 George Dixon, 10 Daniel Mendoza\n\nRobinson's record is unmatched. Johnson would have beaten Ali. Gans was the best lightweight ever, followed closely by Duran (better at that weight than Ray Leonard was at any weight). Walcott and Dixon were the greatest welter and bantamweights of all time. Mendoza transformed the sport by his skill.\n\nKeith Simons\n\nBedford\n\nI agree with everything save your exclusion of Roberto Duran, the greatest of the lightweights. Jack Dempsey was great as a challenger, but as a champion he fought only light-heavyweights and one lumbering clod. Duran, who beat Leonard the first time, should replace Dempsey.\n\nGerald Suster (author of Champions of the Ring and Lightning Strikes)\n\nLondon\n\n1 Muhammad Ali, 2 Ray Robinson, 3 Jack Johnson, 4 Joe Louis, 5 Willie Pep, 6 Carlos Monzon, 7 Manuel Octiz, 8 Joe Gans, 9 Jimmy Wilde, 10 Archie Moore.\n\nGreat champions last a long time, defend frequently and duck no one. Monzon was an undefeated champion. Pep until a plane crash in 1947 was unbeatable at his weight - 137 straight wins. Ortiz defended his title eight times in 1943 and 22 times in all. Dempsey always ducked Geoff Fenwick.\n\nHarry Wills\n\nSouthport\n\nSurely your list should have included Teofilo Stevenson - the only boxer the world dared to imagine might prove the consistent equal of Muhammad Ali, if they ever had been allowed to meet!\n\nJ Mangan\n\nEnnis, Ireland\n\nSigh! No Mike Tyson. Fifteen stone of neandarthal force. The Brooklyn Bomber cut the most menacing figure in the sport's 'dubious' history (his own needn't cloud the issue).\n\nCeri Kneath\n\nSwansea\n\n1 Roberto Duran, 2 Mickey Walker, 3 Ray Robinson, 4 Muhammad Ali, 5 Jack Johnson, 6 Rocky Marciano, 7 Carlos Monzon, 8 Roy Jones, 9 Joe Louis, 10 Stanley Ketchel.\n\nDuran outboxed, outpunched and outfought Leonard in every department in their first fight and then moved up the weights. Ketchel fought Jack Johnson who was three stones heavier and gave him a hell of a fight. Monzon's record speaks for itself. Sugar Ray Robinson, Ali, Joe Louis, Sugar Ray Leonard and Archie Moore were comprehensively beaten more than once.\n\nW Amelli\n\nLondon\n\nRay Robinson is the No 1 all time great. He was the complete fighter who could do everything - and everything he did, he did with grace and style. Ali is the sportsman of the last century but not the greatest fighter! He couldn't fight inside and never body punched. And how can anyone not include Willie Pep?\n\nGeorge Zeleny\n\nvia email\n\n1 Ray Robinson, 2 Muhammad Ali, 3 Henry Armstrong, 4 Roberto Duran, 5 Joe Louis, 6 Jimmy Wilde, 7 Ezzard Charles, 8 Ray Leonard, 9 Archie Moore, 10 Benny Leonard.\n\nEzzard Charles was the No 1 contender for Tony Zales' middleweight crown when America entered the Second World War, but he never received his chance. During the Forties he was easily the best light-heavyweight, beating Archie Moore four times out of five. Again he was never allowed to challenge for the crown. In 1949 he won the vacant heavyweight title and made eight successful defences. Even as a 34-year- old faded former champion he twice came close to defeating Rocky Marciano. Roberto Duran was the greatest ever lightweight, combining his ferocious temperament with devastating power and a greatly underrated defence. Victories over Sugar Ray Leonard, Cuevas, Barkley, Moore, not to mention taking Marvin Hagler (at his peak), the full 15 rounds proved his true greatness.\n\nJohn Andrews\n\nvia email\n\n1 Sugar Ray Robinson, 2 Muhammad Ali, 3 Henry Armstrong, 4 Archie Moore, 5 Jack Johnson, 6 Benny Leonard, 7 Sugar Ray Leonard, 8 Julio Cesar Chavez, 9 Jimmy Wilde, 10 Evander Holyfield.\n\nThe heart says Ali, but the head says Robinson; it was Chavez, not Mike Tyson, who dominated the Eighties; and, in an age of giant heavyweights, cruiserweight Holyfield managed the impossible by winning the world title.\n\nTim Fredericks\n\nCrewe\n\nI very much enjoyed reading Kevin Mitchell's 10 and I agree with much of his analysis. However, I must take issue with his assertion about Sugar Ray Robinson, that 'nobody beat him twice'. In fact Gene Fullmer (1957 and 1961) and Paul Pender (twice in 1960) both defeated Robinson on two occasions. Admittedly this was during the latter stages of his career when his talents were, by his own awesome standards in decline.\n\nHenry Dunn\n\nSunderland\n\nKevin Mitchell replies\n\nHenry, good spot, good point. However, I have to embarrass both of us. There was a third opponent who twice beat what was left of Robinson, right at the end of his career: one Stan Harrington, who decisioned Ray over 10 rounds in June and August of 1965 in Honolulu."
