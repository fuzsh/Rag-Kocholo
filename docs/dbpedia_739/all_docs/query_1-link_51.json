        "text": "Introduction: Anatomy pedagogy and radiologists involvement in teaching undergraduate anatomy varies widely. We surveyed radiologists practising in Australia and New Zealand to establish their opinions on their own experience of undergraduate anatomy and their view on the role of radiology in anatomy teaching. We also sought their views on the role of radiologists in anatomy teaching. Methods: A short survey was designed on the Survey Monkey platform using the website surveymonkey.com. The survey was distributed to members of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANCZR) as a link attached to a monthly e-newsletter with a short paragraph outlining its aim. Results: Sixty-seven responses were eligible for analysis. 33% (22/67) were dissatisfied with their own anatomy training and 55% (38/67) felt that current graduates had an inadequate level of anatomy. 55% (38/67) indicated that radiology had not been a major part of their own undergraduate anatomy training. 58% (39/67) of respondents felt that non-radiology medical and para-medical professionals were not suitably qualified to teach radiologic anatomy. 75% (42/67) were of the opinion that radiology with 3-D support platforms may replace cadaveric dissection in the future, yet most were not familiar with 3-D platforms in current usage.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - Radiology perspective on anatomy teaching in Australia and New Zealand\n\nAU - Power, Jack\n\nAU - Dempsey, Philip\n\nAU - Barry, Denis\n\nAU - Slater, Gregory\n\nAU - McMenamin, Paul\n\nAU - McNicholas, Michelle\n\nN1 - Publisher Copyright: Â© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.\n\nPY - 2022/1\n\nY1 - 2022/1\n\nN2 - Introduction: Anatomy pedagogy and radiologists involvement in teaching undergraduate anatomy varies widely.
