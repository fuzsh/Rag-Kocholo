        "text": "Mr. John J. ‘Jack’ Dempsey, of Waltham, died Friday, December 8, 2023 at his home. He was 86.\n\nJack was born in Cambridge on February 28, 1937, a son of the late Daniel and Kathryn (Coffey) Dempsey and attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School before joining the United States Army near the end of the Korean War.\n\nIn September, 1963 he married the love of his life, Joan M. Gilreath, also from Cambridge, and the pair lived in Watertown before moving to Waltham in 1970 where they became lifelong residents. They enjoyed sixty years together before Joan’s passing on November 10th of this year.\n\nFollowing his discharge from the service Jack went to work for the United States Postal Service where he was a longtime letter carrier in Watertown. Following his retirement from the post office he went to work as a driver assisting many area funeral homes. In both jobs, Jack’s kindness, dedication to his duties, and unique sense of humor earned him many lifelong friends.\n\nHe was a longtime member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Division 14 in Watertown where he also served as a past president, and the Joseph F. Hill American Legion Post No. 156 in Waltham.\n\nJack was a faithful parishioner at Our Lady Comforter of the Afflicted Church in Waltham where he was a Eucharistic minister and usher at Sunday masses.\n\nHe leaves his daughter, Karen M. Harnett (late Robert) of Waltham; his grandchildren, Michael and Abigail Harnett and Amanda and Aidan Wenckus; his brother, William Dempsey (Kathy) of Natick and many nieces, nephews and their families.\n\nJack was also the father of the late Kathryn M. Dempsey and a brother of the late Mary Holian, Neil Dempsey and Daniel Dempsey, Jr.\n\nFamily and friends will honor and remember Jack’s life by gathering for calling hours in The Joyce Funeral Home, 245 Main Street (Rte. 20), Waltham on Tuesday, December 12th from 4 to 7 p.m. and will conclude with a funeral service at 7 p.m. Burial will be private.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to a fund established at Cambridge Savings Bank to help the family of Waltham Police Officer Paul Tracey, a dear friend of Jack’s and his family. Checks should be made payable to The Paul Tracey Family and can be dropped off at any CSB branch office or by mail to Cambridge Savings Bank, 40 Leonard Street, Belmont, MA 02478."
