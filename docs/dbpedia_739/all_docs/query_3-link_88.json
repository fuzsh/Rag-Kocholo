        "text": "from Marty Mulcahey\n\nOn March 27th, 1982 both Wilfredo Gomez and Jeff Chandler defended their titles via 6th round knockouts..... nothing special about that right? Not unless you know that BOTH fights officially ended at 2:28 of the round!\n\nSo you think boxers get title shots way too early now? Don't tell that to Kid Azteca (Luis Villanueva) who fought for 30 years (1929-1961) at the highest level (fought 6 former champs) and NEVER got a title shot! He is still alive and at age 88 will probably enter the WBC rankings at number 1 in the lightweight division for \"past achievements\".\n\nBack in 1985 it was recomended that (state boxing commissioner of New Jersey) Bob Lee (future president of the IBF) be fined for \"soliciting contributions from fight promoters and casino's.\" I guess he learned well before moving on.\n\nIn 1952 German middleweight Peter Muller knocked out the referee of his fight! The punch was thrown on purpose after the referee warned him for low blows.\n\nSpeaking of German boxers. Some people to this day think Max Schmeling was a Nazi! Would a Nazi hide two Jewish children during the war (thus risking his own life) in his Berlin apartment and refuse to fire his Jewish manager even when asked to do so by Adolph Hitler.\n\nDid you know Jack Johnson was sent to prison in Fort Levavenworth after losing the Jess Willard fight in Cuba and not returning Europe to live.\n\nSpeaking of Jack Johnson one of his opponents Victor McLaglen went on to win a Academy Award for his acting in the movie \"The Informer\".\n\nAlexis Arguello never earned a Oscar but did appear in a episode of Miami Vice.\n\nSugar Ray Robinson fought the best fighters of the world in his era, so who does he say hit him the hardest? Sugar Ray repeatedly stated that it was Artie Levine.\n\nIn 1982 American television broadcasters CBS told the WBA that if Art Frias did not defend against deserving challengers Ray Mancini, Andy Ganigan or Sonny Montellano they would not televise any more WBA title fights. The WBA wanted their man Ernesto Espana (twice kayoed by Hilmer Kenty) to get the title shot. The WBA relented and Frias ended up losing (KO 1) to Ray Mancini. Hey HBO how about doing the same!!!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEveryone seems to think Duran was being hopelessly outclassed by Sugar Ray Leonard in the \"No Mas\" fight. But the judges had the fight scored as 4-2-1, 4-2-1 and 4-3 in rounds before Duran quit.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 1985 The Ring magazine ranked the greatest 1st rounds ever:\n\n1. Jack Dempsey vs. Luis Firpo\n\n2. Benny Leonard vs. Ritchie Mitchell\n\n3. Jack Dempsey vs. Jess Willard\n\n4. Chan Hee Park vs. Guty Espadas\n\n5. Marvin Hagler vs. Tommy Hearns\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 1994 KO magazines listed their 5 dirtiest fighters of All-time and they were:\n\n1. Fritzie Zivic\n\n2. Harry Greb\n\n3. Tony Galento\n\n4. Eusebio Pedroza\n\n5. Gene Fullerm\n\nYeah this was before Tyson went on his rampage in the late 90's\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere is a list of nick names given to Ali opponents by Ali\n\n1. The Mummy (George Foreman)\n\n2. The Ugly Bear (Sonny Liston)\n\n3. Dracula (Leon Spinks)\n\n4. The Peanut (Larry Holmes)\n\n5. The Octupus (Ernie Terrell)\n\n6. The Rabbit (Floyd Patterson)\n\n7. The Washerwoman (George Chuvalo)\n\nThe Marquees of Queensberry gets all the press for his rules but back in 1743 James Broughton wrote the first set of rules for boxing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first boxing magazine was \"Boxing Reviewed\" in 1790!!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first ring fatality in a title bout (to my knowledge) was Walter Croots who dies after a 20th round KO in 1897.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDid you know world champions Kid McCoy, Billy Papke, Freddie Mills and Randy Turpin all died by committing suicide.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe largest purse Joe Louis ever received was $625,916.00, that was for his second fight against Billy Conn.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDid you know world champions Stanley Ketchel, Battling Siki, Young Perez, Clemete Sanchez and Eleoncio Mercedes were all murdered.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo wonder boxing is in bad shape, back when ESPN put on weekly boxing shows the highest rated one was when Tommy Morrison fought Tim Tomashek. Jeepers creepers that sucks! Oh yeah second place was Tommy Morrison vs. Bob Quarry and third was Virgill Hill vs. Mike Peak.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe 4 largest USA Tuesday Night Fights broadcasts were Foreman vs. Everett Martin, Foreman vs. Ken Lakuska, The final show and Larry Holmes vs. Ray Mercer on tape delay.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpeaking of TV. Sacramento's channel 3 in 1980 covered the weigh in for the Pete Ranzany vs. Sal Lopez fight live. The problem was that Ranzany had trouble making weight and got on the scales completely naked, yep no one warned channel 3 and Mr. Ranzany was shown to Sacramento in his birthday suit.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThey say Mike Tyson was a big boxing fan/historian (which is true) but how could he then rate Pinklon Thomas as a better boxer than Larry Holmes when asked to rank his top 10 heavyweights in June of 1985? His number 3 selection was David Bey...... urgh we should have seen the signs earlier\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA lot of people like George Foreman for being honest, here is a case where it cost \"Big\" George $30,000. In November 1975 Foreman was sued by Erma Compton who claimed Foreman had struck her while at a hotel in the Catskills. Foreman who had just become a preacher answered truthfully \"yes\" when asked if he struck the women. And with that one word he lost $30,0000.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong but I think that the Galaxy brothers Khaosai and Khaokor of Thailand were the first twins to become world champions.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpeaking of family, Floyd \"Pretty Boy\" Mayweather Jr. dad, Floyd Mayweather Sr. ring nickname was \"Joy\". His ring career was cut short by the fact that he was shot in the leg and had to have 5 surgeries. He was shot in the leg by the shotgun wielding brother of his girlfriend.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCarmen Basillio once lost a close contest 599 to 533...... no that was not the punchstats. It was the votes cast for Mayor of Chittenango, New York.\n\nIn 1980 HBO refused to use a boxer on one of it's shows because \"His trunks were too long and he didn't look like a fighter\". Man guess Naseem Hamed and Roy Jones are in luck with the current bunch of HBO executives.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDid you know Marvin Hagler is the all time middleweight knock out king with a .788 % KO percentage, Stanley Ketchel had a .766 % KO percentage.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI think Kid Dixie was the first champion to loose his crown because he was sent to prison? That was back in 1905.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first women to be licensed as a referee was Mrs. Bear James of Kansas City in 1978.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nZora Folley died a strange death. In 1972 while playing around at poolside, picked up his friend to throw him in the pool. But the 41 year old Folley slipped and hit his head on the side of the cement pool causing his death.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTalk about a tought neighborhood! 80's World Champions Milton McCrory, Duane Thomas and Jimmy Paul all grew up on the same street! It was Marx Street in Detroit.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first title fight held in a Las Vegas Casino was between Roberto Duran and Esteban DeJesus at Cesars Palace in 1978.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDo you realize that Primo Carnera still holds the record for most KO's in a career by a heavyweight champion at 69. Ezzard Charles is second with 58. Charles also holds the record for most bouts in a career by a heavyweight champion at 122.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you to Duane Thomas for these boxing facts\n\nFighting as a middleweight early in his pro career future WBA heavyweight champion Jimmy Ellis lost a 10 round decision to none other than Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter. Well how did that not get in the movie!\n\nWhen Floyd Patterson and Ingemar Johannson meet in their rubber match in 1961 it was the first and only that the same 2 men fought for the heavyweight title 3 fights in a row.\n\nBill Brady was the 1st manager of 2 heavyweight champions James Jeffries and Jim Corbett, it took Don King nearly 90 years to equal that feat.\n\nThe smallest attendance at a heavyweight title fight was between Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston II with only 2,434 people attending the fight because of threats of violence.\n\nMarch 21, 1963 is a unique date in boxing. It is the 1st and only time that two \"undisputed\" world champions lost their titles on the same day. Emile Griffith lost his title to Luis Rodriguez and Sugar Ramos lost to Davey Moore.\n\nJoe Frazier became well known in America because of his Gold Medal win the Olympics, but it should not have happend! Joe was allowed to participate in the Olympics because Buster Mathis who won the Olympic box offs broke his thumb in a fight and could not go. The ironic part is that it was Joe Frazier's head that he broke it on in the finals of that tourney. Talk about adding insult to injury!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere is a odd fact, the great Carlos Monzon had 60 KO's in his career but never scored on in the first round. Talk about a slow starter.\n\nWhen Rocky Marciano died he left behind no will, no insurance and little in assets. Rocky was known for his peny pinching and as much as 1 million dollars in cash is still missing. One time Rocky went to the movies with his daughter and stashed a brown bag under the seat while they watched the movie. Rocky forgot about the bag but his daughter remembered and handed the bag to her father. In it was $40,000 in cash! Rocky hated banks and always kept cash hidden.... perhaps it is buried somewhere in Brockton?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat heavyweight holds the record for most knockouts? George Godfrey with 76 (Archie Moore while he fought at heavyweight was never a full fleged heavy) Primo Carnera is the record holder for knockouts among heavyweight champions with 68.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJack Dempsey's heaviest fighting weight was 194 1/2 pounds.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJoe Frazier when asked how he would fare against his son in a boxing match said \"If I said 'Fall down', he's gonna fall down. I'm still his father.\"\n\nIn a case of taking it too far South African boxing fanatic Tony Wolf committed suicide after his favorite boxer Gerrie Coetzee was beaten by John Tate for the heavyweight title.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLight heavyweight great Billy Conn was payed $2.50 for his first pro fight..... his manager took $2.00 of it because \"You lost the fight, and besides you got to eat!\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis might seem impossible but Don King was actually silent once! In a appearance before a federal Grand Jury in 1981 Don King took the fifth amendment (The right not to imcriminate one self by making a statement) 350 times!!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI think the quickest kayo in a pro bout for the history of Madison Square Garden was the 54 seconds it took Gerry Cooney to knock Ken Norten out. E-mail me if you know of a faster one.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat boxer refereed a heavyweight title fight 8 years before he participated in one? Geroges Carpentier refereed the Jack Johnson vs. Andre Spoul fight in 1913 and fought Jack Dempsey in 1921 for the heavyweight title.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpeaking of Carpentier, amazingly he scored a knockout in every weight division from flyweight to heavyweight.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the fight to the finish days the most number of rounds fought was 276 rounds!! The bout was between Patsy Tunney and Jack Jones and took place in 1825 in Chesire, England.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpeaking of fights that went some 75 rounds or more, you must take this into account. Back in the pre-Queensberry rules a round was ended when one boxer fell or was wrestled to the ground, then they had 30 seconds to return to scratch and fight again.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat was the strangest way a bout was stopped? This might qualify. 1981 in Liberal Kansas a womens fight (yes it was around back then also) was stopped because Robin Haukaas bra broke!! Angie Lopez won by....... BKO\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"I've got it made! I've got a wife and a TV set...... and they're both working.\" Willie Pep.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe last title fight to go past 15 rounds was the light heavyweight bout between Mike McTigue and Battling Siki, McTigue won the title on a 20 round decision.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVictor McGlaglen who won a Academy award for his role in the movie \"The Informer\" fought heavyweight champion Jack Johnson in a six round no decision.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nActors Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope and Dean Martin were also boxers.\n\nAl McCoy was the first left handed boxer to win a world title when he won the middleweight title in 1914.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWho is the only heavyweight champion to be knocked out in his pro debut? Mike Weaver (WBA heavyweight champ) who was knocked out in the third round by Howard Smith.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Jack Dempsey vs. Bill Brennan heavyweight title fight was the first scheduled for 15 rounds.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat was John L. Sullivans middle name? Lawrence\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe great Young Stirbling in 202 fights never fought in the same city twice in a row.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn a bout between former heavyweight champ Jack Johnson and Jack Thompson in 1923 the referee (Villanmil is the only name mentioned) became so disgusted by the slowness of the bout that he walked out of the ring! The promotor had to finish refereeing the bout.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere are the Real names of some famous boxers Barney Ross - Barnet Rosofsky, Jack \"Kid\" Berg - Judah Bergman, Kid Chocolate - Eligio Sardinias, Gerrie Coetzee - Gerhardus Christian Coetzee, Rocky Graziano - Thomas Rocco Barbella, Stanley Ketchel - Stanislaus Kiecal, Benny Leonard - Benjamin Leiner, Joe Louis - Joseph Louis Barrow, Rocky Marciano - Rocco Francis Marchegiano, Archie Moore - Archibald Lee Wright, Willie Pep - Guglielmo Papaleo, Sugar Ray Robinson - Walker Smith, Max Schmeling - Maxmillian Adolph Otto Siegfried Schmeling, Dick Tiger - Richard Ihetu, Pancho Villa - Francisco Guilledo, Jersey Joe Walcott - Arnold Raymond Cream, Tony Zale - Anthony Florian Zaleski,\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor all you English fans. Did you know that John Conteh would have fought Carlos Monzon if only a 10,000 pound fine for Monzon failing to take a urine test after his Napoles fight in Paris would have been lifted by the EBU in 1975.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat were the only other two world title bouts to take place in Africa BEFORE the Ali-Foreman rumble in the jungle? Dick Tiger vs. Gene Fulmer in Nigeria and Sugar Ramos vs. Floyd Robinson in Ghana.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHogan \"Kid\" Bassey was a world traveler. Born in Nigeria he won the featherweight title while boxing out of England. When he retired he coached amateur boxers for Yugoslavia of all places? Before returning home to teach Nigerian boxers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe record for most knockdowns in one non-title bout (or any bout probably) had to be when Battling Nelson (one of the toughest boxers ever) was knocked down 7 times..... oh yeah his opponent Christy Williams was knocked down 42 times!! And they thought Nelson was tough. The fight ended in the 17th round with Nelson declared the winner by knockout.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDid you know Willie Pep fought Sugar Ray Robinson! According to Pep he and Sugar Ray fought as amateurs in Norwich, Connecticut in 1938. Robinson supposedly won the decision and weighed in at 128 to Willie's 110.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDid you know Archie Moore suffered a serious back injury after he retired? He had a car accident...... in Nigeria!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMuhammad Ali was not only a great pro boxer he was also a great amateur. He lost only one bout in the amateurs to a boxer named Amos Johnson."
