        "text": "Former Liberal National Party minister and high-profile Bundaberg Mayor Jack Dempsey says he will contest the seat of Hinkler as an independent at the upcoming federal election.\n\nMr Dempsey said in a statement last night he would take leave as Mayor after the election was officially called.\n\nThe electorate has been represented by LNP member and Minister for Resources and Water, Keith Pitt since the 2013 federal election.\n\nMr Dempsey, who served in the Newman government as police minister, described himself as a \"full independent\" who has \"no allegiances to anyone\".\n\n\"I'll do what's best for the people of Hinkler in that I'll go and see – it's common sense – who's got the largest majority … and try to negotiate first for Hinkler,\" he said.\n\nThe seat of Hinkler — which takes in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay — has been in the hands of the National Party and LNP for nine terms.\n\nMr Pitt currently holds the seat with a margin of 14.5 per cent.\n\nMr Dempsey took aim at the current federal member, accusing him of being \"out of touch\" with residents in the Hinkler electorate.\n\n\"Mr Pitt is out of touch with the local community on climate change, the housing crisis, flood mitigation and coal mining.\n\n\"I'll be the member for Hinkler, not the member against it, as Mr Pitt has been on marriage equality, flood mitigation, climate change, hospital and highway upgrades, and the cashless card.\"\n\nPitt defends record as local MP\n\nMr Pitt said ratepayers \"are entitled to ask for the Bundaberg Mayor's resignation\".\n\n\"Independents are voices of the Labor party, they don't vote with us, they're not members of the government or opposition, they simply can't deliver anything that matters.\"\n\nMr Pitt said he stood by his record and rejected claims Hinkler has been taken for granted.\n\n\"Local councils have never had so much support from the Commonwealth, they've got $12 million each roughly for local roads and community centres and support, $600 million into Paradise Dam and hundreds of millions into the Bruce Highway,\" he said.\n\nMr Pitt said he will not back down in his strong support for the cashless welfare card.\n\n\"It's a tough but necessary policy,\" he said.\n\nBundaberg region 'one of the most disadvantaged' in the country\n\nMr Dempsey said local residents had grown increasingly frustrated by what he said was a lack of representation at the federal level.\n\n\"Hinkler's voice is very important to be down in Canberra and I want to be able to work for Hinkler,\" he said.\n\n\"Not being a member of the party machine, that works for the party here in Hinkler.\n\n\"That's what's been happening obviously for many years now and people are getting frustrated and they want to be able to have their issues taken to Canberra in a positive way.\"\n\n[Qld local edition teaser]\n\nHe said if it was a hung parliament he would negotiate first with the largest party.\n\nMr Dempsey, who turned 56 yesterday, said the Bundaberg region was \"one of the most disadvantaged areas in the whole of Australia\".\n\nMr Dempsey said his key areas of focus would the area's seniors and young people, including youth unemployment, and he would work to put the region on the map with bio energy and agricultural technology."
