Brown, this medal is to be awarded to a person who has rendered distinguished service in or to the field of engineering education, preferably but not limited to persons who are alumni, faculty, or otherwise closely connnected to Mines.\n\nDistinguished Achievement Medal\n\nEstablished in 1942, this medal is awarded to alumni of any year in recognition of distinguished career achievements.\n\nMines Medal\n\nThe Mines Medal shall be awarded to those persons, whether or not alumni and whether or not members of the close university community who have rendered unusual and exemplary service to the Colorado School of Mines. Such service may include personal service in any capacity of such character and duration as to rank it as unusual or exemplary.
