        "text": "babe-ruth.JPG\n\nBabe Ruth, shown in 1921, was a larger-than-life athlete in the eyes of the media and fans. Off the field, he kept a dapper look. On the field, he pounded home runs wearing the rather utilitarian uniforms of the day.\n\n(Library of Congress)\n\nStyles and fashions of the 1920s are not the only glamorous expressions of the decade. Sports -- helped along by two of the biggest stars -- had their moment in the spotlight, too.\n\nProfessional basketball's draft was more than 20 years away. It would take 30 years for television to vault professional football to living rooms throughout America. Baseball and boxing ruled the era.\n\nIt was the Indians who helped baseball shake off a gambling scandal in 1919, with Cleveland winning the 1920 World Series. It was a dramatic year for Cleveland fans, who followed a team that won its first title but saw one of its stars, Ray Chapman, die after being hit by a pitch in an August game. (The pitch was thrown in an era without batting helmets.)\n\nBut after 1920, the decade belonged to New York. The Giants and Yankees captured five of the next nine World Series. The Yankees, led by slugger Babe Ruth, began their series domination. The 1927 team, famously tagged as Murderers' Row, is known as one of the greatest ever.\n\nBut it was the home-run-pounding Ruth who shone among the team's stars while resonating with fans. On the field, he smacked 60 home runs, a record that would stand for more than 30 years. Off the field, he enjoyed the fruits of (for the times) an extremely high salary and a seemingly endless appetite for food and late-night philandering. He was a magnetic charm to children, who flocked to his boyish nature.\n\nThe fashion sense of Ruth -- who once modeled underwear -- is summed up well in a 2010 Forbes.com story by Raquel Laneri:\n\nWhile New York's Yankees and Giants dominated most of the '20s (Washington, Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Philadelphia also managed championships), -- one man owned much of the decade in boxing.\n\nJack Dempsey was one of the best-known athletes in the '20s, with his achievements enshrined in the sport's annals. He earned the heavyweight title in 1919 and defended it five times until losing to Gene Tunney in 1926 before 120,000 fans. In 1927, he lost again to Tunney in the infamous \"Long Count\" fight. After knocking down Tunney, Dempsey hadn't moved quickly enough to a neutral corner, and the referee delayed the count, giving the fallen Tunney a few extra seconds to stand -- which he did. It would live as one of the most disputed bouts in boxing history.\n\nIn the ring, Dempsey slugged his way to his titles, winning most by knockout over a 13-year career. Out of the ring, he maintained a dapper look. Striped suits, double-breasted, wingtips and the occasional flamboyant tie were common attire for the champion.\n\nThe evolution of style and sports can be seen in the contrast between baseball uniforms and boxing shorts of the '20s and those of today.\n\nIn boxing, shorts were usually dark, tighter and shorter. Now, they are much baggier, longer and often colorful.\n\nBaseball has seen some drastic changes in uniforms. Then, teams wore two main uniforms: home whites and road grays. Today, teams will change uniforms as often as runway models switch outfits. Teams have home, road and Sunday uniforms. But players also wear special designs, like the Indians' camouflaged lettering and caps on Memorial Day, as well as throwback or Negro League uniforms.\n\nThis season, the Indians don four regular uniforms -- white, gray, navy and ivory, home clubhouse and equipment manager Tony Amato says.\n\nIt's all a long way from the utilitarian '20s."
