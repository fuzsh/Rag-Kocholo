He is considered one of the most legendary figures in the world of boxing and is widely regarded as one of the greatest heavyweight champions of all time. Dempsey was born in Manassa, Colorado, to parents of Irish and Cherokee descent. Growing up in a modest family, he developed a love for boxing at a young age. He found solace and an escape from the hardships of his life through the sport, which eventually led him to pursue it professionally. Early in his career, Dempsey faced significant challenges and struggled to make a name for himself. However, his fortunes changed when he earned a shot at the heavyweight title against Jess Willard in 1919. The fight took place in Toledo, Ohio, and would go down in history as one of the most brutal and iconic matches of all time.
