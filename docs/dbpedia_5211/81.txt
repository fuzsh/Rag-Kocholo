Burgersdorp, Eastern Cape Highlands

Described as the oldest town in the North Eastern Cape, Burgersdorp lies south in the tip of an inverted triangle between Aliwal North and Venterstad. It is not a town you'll simply happen upon unless you have a lot of time on your hands, as it doesn't lie on an obvious route, but it does make it onto lists of the most popular little towns in the Eastern Cape.

Many regard the beautiful town, surrounded by the Stormberg Mountains, as the cultural heart of the northern reaches of the province with no fewer than 10 national monuments - the museum alone is made up of four buildings worth a visit. The Burgersdorp Cultural Historical Museum (not the same as the museum) is a combination of an old parsonage, two gorgeously illustrative Karoo homesteads, what was the first theological school and a couple of old lean-tos in which ancient wagons and farm implements now rest.

Burgersdorp has a real history, having begun its life with nine streets, two squares and an area for the church - it was to be a church town, much needed by local farmers who, up until then (1846), had travelled all the way to Graaff-Reinet, Cradock or Colesberg to go to church.

But it isn't the history alone that makes the town so attractive. It is well looked after, people who live here are proud of their town, its wide streets invite exploration and there are plenty of places to stay, most of them in typical little Karoo houses. Essentially a sheep-farming community the little town is rich in character and well worth a visit.
