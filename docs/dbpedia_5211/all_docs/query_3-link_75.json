        "text": "In the Burgersdorp and surrounding areas of Johannesburg BURGERSDORP ACCOUNT QUERIES have concluded that residential Sectional Title, Body Corporates and owners of blocks of flats are often billed too much for water where there are a number of residential units. This problem arose in Burgersdorp due to the fact that each residential unit is entitled to the step up tariff for water billing. Problems may arise in the following instances common in Burgersdorp:\n\n1. A whole Residential Sectional Title complex or block of flats is billed as 1 house in Burgersdorp.\n\n2. A Residential Sectional Title Complex was developed in phases and COJ failed to update the number of units of each phase which is very common in Burgersdorp.\n\n3. A mixed use building (a building with flats and offices) is billed on the business tariff or as 1 residential house in Burgersdorp.\n\nDepending upon the problem present on your account, the Account Specialists of BURGERSDORP ACCOUNT QUERIES can assist you to correct your account."
