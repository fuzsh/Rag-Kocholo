        "meta_description": "Situated about 12 kilometres from town, this 482-hectare game farm is in a mountainous area with rugged cliff views and a secluded valley but is mostly flat plateau. It is situated high in the Stormberg Mountains, an area renowned for its extremely good habitat and vegetation wherein an abundance of game thrives. Veld is mixed but mainly grass.  This enterprise lends itself to environmentally aware buyers who can immerse themselves in a unique environment, to be rewarded with outstanding beauty and immense inner peace. The farm is secluded being 3 kilometres off-track. The road to the farm is a cul-de-sac and there are no servitude roads through the farm.  The Burgersdorp dam is in the immediate vicinity of the farm and offers water sports, canoeing and fishing. Bushman paintings also occur in the area. The bird’s eye view overlooking the dam is exceptional from this game farm.  Game farming is the main farming activity practised with the ultimate plan being to keep the farming enterprises as tranquil as possible. The game species on the farm includes springbuck, blesbuck, lechwe, red hartebeest, black wildebeest, blue wildebeest and zebra. Migratory kudu, mountain reedbuck and steenbok also occur. The total number of all species is maintained between 300 and 400 animals mainly through hunting and occasionally by capture. The present owner has also established a small flock of 150 sheep that provides an additional income to the farm.  The primary land use is largely through grazing because of its richness in grass and bush species. Vegetation consists mainly of palatable sweet and sour grass species as well as palatable bush.  The farm lies in an area where summer as well as winter rain occurs. The long-term average precipitation is about 500 mm per annum. The carrying capacity is about 1:10 LSU.  The entire farm is fully game-fenced and currently has a valid Certificate of Adequate Enclosure issued by the Department of Economic Development and Tourism of the Eastern Cape. There is an adequate water supply for the residences from two boreholes and for game drinking water from 3 earth dams supplemented by boreholes when required. There are no internal fences.  The well maintained 300 square meter farmhouse has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen, lounge /dining room and sunroom that allows for a comfortable living experience. The hunter’s cottage consists of one bedroom and a kitchen, bathroom and living room.  If you are looking for a wonderfully unique destination that offers an unspoilt, peaceful and healthy lifestyle with exquisite panoramic views of mountains and a star-filled night sky - this would be it. The farm is most suitable for an active retired couple.  Contact me today to secure your dream Karoo enterprise!  For sale at R 5,250,000 excluding VAT. The owner is a VAT vendor.
