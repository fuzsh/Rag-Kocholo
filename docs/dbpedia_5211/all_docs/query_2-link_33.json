This intensive training equipped our educators and youth workers with the necessary tools and knowledge to effectively facilitate the MOT programme with their students.\n\nDuring our time in Burgersdorp, we engaged in productive meetings with the principals and MOT Coaches from our partner schools, alongside a MOT Refresher Training workshop for our previously trained MOT Coaches.\n\nFeedback from participants was incredibly positive, with one individual sharing, “I had to engage in deep soul-searching,”. Others described it as “really good content and relatable,” “fun and educational,” and emphasized its role in creating a safer and more comfortable environment for youth in the community.\n\nWe extend our sincere gratitude to Scatec for their support in reaching the Burgersdorp community. With their assistance, we eagerly anticipate continued growth and positive outcomes in Burgersdorp. We recognize that by investing in our youth, we are investing in our future. Thank you, Scatec, for your partnership and commitment to MOT.\n\nInterested in finding out more about what the MOT Coaches’ Basic Education entails and how you can get involved to become a MOT Coach?
