I was looking at that medal on ebay, and was wondering how it got there.\n\nNot sure where you got the info from on your message, but the WalterHoefer is his father. His mother married Wilhelm or Carl Wilhelm Walterhoefer on the Britannia in England Oct 1856. They then arrived in SA on the Meresy in Feb 1857. They had two sons Robert Amiel and William Johannes Louis. I read somewhere that he was given a plot of land in Olsen, Not sure what happened to him after that. His wife Emma Bacon later married and had more children with Gustav von Kleist. The two older boys took on his name. this is documented on Emma;s death notice. She also had a hotel in Colesburg or Burghersdorp. She went baack to Eng, as she got sick and passed away in 1882. Robert as far as I know was in the printing trade, he apparently introduced my granny and granpa, who was also in the trade. my dad and one of my uncles followed suit.\n\nCatherine J von Kleist was his first wife. Gertude Magdalena Branford nee Havenga was his second wife they had 2 daughters and a son named Robert. He served in the salvation army most of his life and lived to 102. My Granmother Susan passed away at 92. The other daughter passed away quite young.\n\nRegards\n\nZelda\n\nThe following user(s) said Thank You: QSAMIKE"
