        "text": "Duffin, Christopher J.; Heckert, Andrew B.; Hancox, P. John\n\nAbstract\n\nHybodont chondrichthyans are known from both marine and freshwater assemblages and are globally widespread throughout the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic. However, the dynamics of their diversity before and after the Permo-Triassic extinction are not well understood, as both Late Permian and Early Triassic assemblages are rare, and most assemblages are known from Laurasia. The chondrichthyan fauna of the Early Triassic Langbergia-Garjainia subzone, Cynognathus Assemblage Zone from the farm Driefontein 11, Free State, South Africa, is described for the first time. A new species, Lissodus tumidoclavus n. sp. is established from these freshwater lacustrine deposits, which also include teeth assignable to Polyacrodus n. sp. and a third taxon left in open nomenclature. The new species of Lissodus is the most abundant at Driefontein, represented by hundreds of small (≤ 2.5 mm crown length) teeth from multiple tooth positions and a jaw fragment preserving 14 teeth in four tooth families. Defining characteristics include a vertical ridge along a labial peg that has strong nodes on either its flanks or at the crown-root junction. Specimens of Polyacrodus sp. are rarer (n < 100), larger (up to 4 mm length) and more robust, and the unnamed morphotype is the rarest (n ≤ 25). Like other Early Triassic freshwater chondrichthyan faunas, the Driefontein elasmofauna comprises a low diversity suite of small-sized hybodontiform sharks and may represent a case of reduced diversity and size (“Lilliput effect”) in the aftermath of the end-Permian extinction event.\n\nKeywords"
