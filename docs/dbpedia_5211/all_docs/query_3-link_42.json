This means that when we are finished with your installation, you will also be handed a Plumbing Certificate of Compliance to prove that your installation conforms to the highest standards set out by the PiRB.\n\nHow we work\n\nWe will set an appointment with you to inspect the installation area in Burgersdorp and confirm that it would be the best-suited location. The inspection is free of charge as we also donâ€™t charge call-out fees for any other plumbing-related repair or installation. Once we have confirmed the best-suited location we will send you an invoice and we will set an installation appointment date. We will then do the installation and issue you with a certificate of compliance.\n\nHow this system works\n\nCold water enters the geyser. Because the water is cold, the water will lay at the bottom of the geyser. At this point, it will be drawn into the inlet section of the manifold of the Solar Tubes. Once this happens the Solar Tubes will heat up the water and the water will automatically move upwards through the tubes into the geyser. After a short period, a stream is created by the water entering the manifold of the Solar system, and thus convections take place where a constant stream of water is flowing through the system. In this manner, the water will continue to move inside the geyser constantly warming the water and keeping it at a warm temperature.\n\nThe benefits of this system\n\nThe benefits of this system are as follows:\n\nNo mechanical parts are needed for the system to work\n\nNo mechanical parts are needed for the system to work.
