        "text": "It all started in a village called Bathurst, in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa in 1865 when a local farmer found some pineapple tops in a barbershop and planted them on his farm. The rest is history, and the area around Bathurst is now the biggest pineapple growing region in South Africa. It’s beautiful too – within an hour’s drive, depending on the direction you choose, are some of the world’s most stunning beaches, and game reserves where the big 5 animals roam in their natural habitat.\n\nWe consider ourselves a family business. Some of our farmers are 7th generation and some of the farm workers are too, their families tilling the soil side by side for over 150 years. We’re very proud of the fact that all our workers, from farm workers to the people on the factory floor, have shares in our business.\n\nOur fruit is the economic lifeblood of the area in which they are grown, and to underline this we built the world’s biggest pineapple in Bathurst. It’s a famous landmark and people come to visit it from all over. The view from the top of it is breathtaking."
