Some areas in Thembisa recently went a week without water.\n\nThis has negatively affected businesses, clinics, schools, the hospital, and residents.\n\nThe Joe Gqabi District Municipality is the Water Services Provider and is responsible for pumping and purifying untreated water, and then distributing it to communities.\n\nThe Walter Sisulu Municipality oversees the electricity provision so that water can be pumped successfully. The damaged transformer has made this impossible.\n\nThe transformer was eventually sourced and arrived in Burgersdorp on 24 November 2022.\n\nCables were laid and prepped, only to discover that the transformer was the wrong specification and not big enough to even start the pumps.\n\nBurgersdorp does not have a water problem but a serious water management problem.\n\nThe failures of both the Joe Gqabi District Municipality, which is responsible for water, and the Walter Sisulu Municipality, responsible for electricity provision to the pumps, have deprived residents of their fundamental human rights.\n\nThese two municipalities do not care about the residents of Burgersdorp, Eureka, Thembisa and Mzamomhle.\n\nThe DA will not allow two dysfunctional ANC municipalities to deny residents access to water."
