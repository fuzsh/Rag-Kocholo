        "text": "The Taal Monument *\n\nThe \"Taal\" monument was erected in 1893 to commemorate the acceptance of Dutch in the Cape Parliament. President M.T. Steyn was the speaker on this occasion.\n\nThe statue is made out of Carrara marble and was constructed in Italy. The daughter of Daantjie van der Heever, a well known politician from the Burgersdorp area, was used as a model.\n\nIn 1901, during the Anglo Boer War, the statue was damaged and removed by the British troops.\n\nAfter the war, the British government agreed to replace the monument and the replica was unveiled in 1907 in the Jubilee park. The monument was moved to the Burger Square in 1933. The original monument was discovered - without the head - in King William's Town in 1939. It was erected behind the replica in 1957. The replica was declared a national monument in 1937.\n\nBurgersdorp, with 10 national monuments, is worth a day or 2 of exploring.\n\n* Source: \"Burgersdorp, Cultural heart of the North Eastern Cape.\" (Burgersdorp Tourism Organisation, compiler Anita Joubert)"
