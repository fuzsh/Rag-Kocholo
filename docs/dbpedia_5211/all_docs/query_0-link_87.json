The words ‘surprise’, ‘pleasure’ and ‘variety’ come to mind as you peruse an array of coffee shops, museums and Anglo-Boer War memorials - to both the Boers and Brits alike. On a hill overlooking the town is a blockhouse (defensive position) from the war.\n\nThe 413 ha De Berg Nature Reserve above the small town is well stocked with large game species such as blesbok, red hartebeest, black wildebeest, kudu, zebra and springbuck.\n\nHow to get there\n\nFollow the R56 from Middelburg through to Steynsburg, continue on the R56, then turn left onto the R391 road and head straight on onto Stasie Road in Burgersdorp (Odometer 156km).\n\nFollow the R56 from Pietermaritzburg through to Molteno continue on the R56, then turn right onto the R391 and head straight on onto Stasie Road in Burgersdorp, (Odometer 684km).\n\nGetting Around\n\nSelf-drive would be best.\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nMany guesthouses, a few B&B’s and hotels are located in this area including the following: Jubilee Hotel, The Hut Guest House, Dusk to Dawn Guesthouse, The Nook B&B, Zetana Guesthouse and Nguni Self-catering Guesthouse.\n\nWhere to Eat\n\nTry out any one of these places: Hagenhuis Coffee Shop & Restaurant, Wistaria Café & Restaurant, Nunu's Restaurant and Take Aways or take a look at Mike’s Kitchen"
