        "text": "Microposaurus is an extinct genus of trematosaurid temnospondyl. Fossils are known from the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone of the Beaufort Group (part of the Karoo Supergroup) in South Africa and the Rouse Hill Siltstone of Australia and date back to the Anisian stage of the Middle Triassic. A mandible from the Lower Anisian Mukheiris Formation in Jordan shares many similarities with the genus, including a similarly sized Meckelian fenestra on the inner surface of the lower jaw, teeth with sharp edges, and large fangs in the upper jaw.\n\nDescription[]\n\nM. casei[]\n\nSkull[]\n\nBesides being narrow, long, and wedge-shaped like most trematosaurids, M. casei also had significant ossification that caused individual skull bones to be indistinguishable from fusion with one another. A notable characteristic was the posterior placement of the \"suspensorium beyond the skull table\".\n\nThe rounded tip of their short snout produced nostrils that were closely spaced and further back which was from a significant prenarial growth. Furthermore, the nostrils had a teardrop shape from the anterior constriction experienced at the snout. An attribute of M. casei was symphyseal tusks from their lower jaw protruding into the nostril openings that caused small foramens in the anterior palatal vacuities to ventrally open with the nostrils (dorsally).\n\nFound in all trematosauroids, their orbits were elliptical (long axes oriented medially) and had a smooth dorsal surface to the palatines. Upon this surface is also multiple foramina. Described as being more-complete on the left side of the skull and \"relatively large, elliptical, and slightly constricted posteriorly\". This is unique when compared to other trematosaurids having shallow and triangular otic notches.\n\nPalate[]\n\nAs in the skull, the palate was also heavily ossified with a similarity to their lineage with having paired anterior palatal vacuities (APV). These APVs were formed by the premaxillae (anteriorly) and the vomers (posteriorly). These APVs had a posteroventrally prong-like process that separated them from one another anteriorly. Another similarity was the choana which is larger in Microposaurus but still circular-elliptical in appearance. A lasting ancestral trait was the quadrate ramus's primitive appearance of the same length and orientation. Some differences were the parasphenoid and pterygoid sutures were elongated, and the \"parasphenoid was broader posteriorly than anteriorly\".\n\nDentition[]\n\nOut of any stereospondyl, the dentition of M. casei was described as the most specialized. The marginal tooth row were recurved medially which is a characteristic of mastodonsauroids and not trematosauroids. However, the tightly packed marginal teeth all had pleurodont implantations with antero-posterior compression at the bases. The palatal tooth row were reduced with little teeth on the vomers (medial to the choana) and on the posterior ends of the ectopterygoids. There were no teeth on the palatines. Referring back to the anterior tusks, they were giant in size with the left vomer being about 50mm in height, and the smallest on the left ectopterygoids at 30mm in height. The acrodont tooth style was seen in the palatal teeth and the tusks.\n\nOcciput[]\n\nExoccipital condyles were present with a large, rounded outlining. The paroccipital processes were attached to each condyle but were barely preserved in the specimen. A single, large paraquadrate foramen was seen near the posterolateral margin of the skull.\n\nM. averyi[]\n\nThree distinctive characteristics were detected on the M. averyi specimen that separated the two species from one another. The greatly enlarged anterior emargination of the external nostrils were more anteriorly placed. The APV were widely separated without the prong of the premaxilla like M. casei. And there was a medial subrostral fossa in the premaxillae.\n\nAppearance in other media[]\n\nJurassic Park[]"
