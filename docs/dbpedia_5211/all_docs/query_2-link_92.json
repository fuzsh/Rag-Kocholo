        "meta_description": "A new species of the erythrosuchid archosauriform reptile Garjainia Ochev, 1958 is described on the basis of disarticulated but abundant and well-preserved cranial and postcranial material from the late Early Triassic (late Olenekian) Subzone A of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone of the Burgersdorp Formation (Beaufort Group) of the Karoo Basin of South Africa. The new species, G. madiba, differs from its unique congener, G. prima from the late Olenekian of European Russia, most notably in having large bony bosses on the lateral surfaces of the jugals and postorbitals. The new species also has more teeth and a proportionately longer postacetabular process of the ilium than G. prima. Analysis of G. madiba bone histology reveals thick compact cortices comprised of highly vascularized, rapidly forming fibro-lamellar bone tissue, similar to Erythrosuchus africanus from Subzone B of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone. The most notable differences between the two taxa are the predominance of a radiating vascular network and presence of annuli in the limb bones of G. madiba. These features indicate rapid growth rates, consistent with data for many other Triassic archosauriforms, but also a high degree of developmental plasticity as growth remained flexible. The diagnoses of Garjainia and of Erythrosuchidae are addressed and revised. Garjainia madiba is the geologically oldest erythrosuchid known from the Southern Hemisphere, and demonstrates that erythrosuchids achieved a cosmopolitan biogeographical distribution by the end of the Early Triassic, within five million years of the end-Permian mass extinction event. It provides new insights into the diversity of the Subzone A vertebrate assemblage, which partially fills a major gap between classic ‘faunal’ assemblages from the older Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone (earliest Triassic) and the younger Subzone B of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone (early Middle Triassic).",

        "text": "Additional Information from Paratypes\n\nPremaxilla.\n\nThere are no complete premaxillae, but the morphology of the preserved portions (BP/1/5525, two partial right premaxillae; BP/1/5760a, partial left premaxilla; BP/1/6232n, relatively complete right premaxilla; BP/1/6232l, partial left premaxilla; BP/1/7138, partial right premaxilla; NMQR 3257, left premaxilla) (Figs. 9, 10) is very similar to that of G. prima. Although the posterior part of the ventral margin of the premaxilla (alveolar margin) is slightly damaged in most examples, the main body of the premaxilla appears to be subquadrangular in lateral view, with the ventral border of the naris being approximately parallel to the alveolar margin. In lateral view, the anterior margin of the premaxilla is vertically or even anterodorsally orientated, rather than sloping slightly posterodorsally as in E. africanus [20]. The posterodorsal process has a broad base behind the naris. The posterior edge of the premaxilla is thin (BP/1/6232n) and the preserved portions lack any indications of the peg seen in E. africanus [20], S. shansisuchus ([17]: fig. 8b) or S. kuyeheensis [65]. In lacking a border for a second antorbital fenestra the premaxilla of G. madiba more closely resembles that of G. prima [9] and E. africanus [20] than S. shansisuchus [17]. In lateral view the long axis of the slender prenarial (nasal) process of the premaxilla of G. madiba is almost vertical anteriorly and curves to become almost horizontal dorsally and posteriorly (NMQR 3257). The postnarial process (best preserved in NMQR 3257, Fig. 10) is strongly transversely compressed. As in E. africanus [20], there is a foramen immediately behind the medial surface of the base of the prenarial process (Fig. 9E: fo), and a cluster of foramina are present on the anterolateral surface of the premaxilla, close to the alveolar margin (BP/1/6232n). Gower ([20]: 15, 81) variably identified the former foramen as for the ethmoidal nerve and ethmoidal artery, and based on comparisons with extant diapsids (e.g. [66], [67]: 17) it probably carried a branch of the ophthalmic nerve and possibly associated blood vessels.\n\nA–C, BP/1/5760a, partial left premaxilla in lateral (A), medial (B) and ventral (C) views. D–G, BP/1/6232n, partial right premaxilla in lateral (D), medial (E) and ventral (F) views, and close up of distal margin of first premaxillary tooth (G). H–I, BP/1/6232l, partial left premaxilla in lateral (H) and ventral (I) views. Abbreviations: en, border of external naris; fo, ethmoidal foramen; pap, palatal process. Numbers in part I indicate tooth alveoli.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111154.g009\n\nSynthetic cast of NMQR 3257, left premaxilla in lateral (A) and medial (B) views. Abbreviations: en, border of external naris; pap, palatal process.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111154.g010\n\nThe lateral surface of the premaxilla of BP/1/6232L (Fig. 9H) bears a groove subparallel to the dental margin. This likely held neurovascular tissue in life, and is seen also in G. prima and in at least some specimens of E. africanus (BP/1/5207). The groove is not clear in all the G. madiba specimens, possibly resulting from individual variation as well as differences in preservation (Fig. 9).\n\nThe premaxilla of G. madiba clearly formed a downturned snout tip, with a broad notch in the ventral border of the jaw between premaxilla and maxilla, as seen in E. africanus [20] and the holotype of G. prima [16], [68]. The downturning of the premaxilla appears to be more strongly developed in Garjainia spp. than in other erythrosuchids. Much of the medial surface of the main body of each premaxilla of G. madiba forms a facet for its antimere. This facet tapers posteriorly onto the element's palatal process (Figs. 9, 10: pap). As a consequence of the downturned snout, the posterior tip of the palatal process approaches (and, when complete, possibly reached or extended beyond) the posteroventral corner of the premaxilla in lateral and medial views (Figs. 9, 10). There are no complete premaxillae known for G. madiba and the alveolar border is eroded to some degree in all specimens, but the downturning of the snout and premaxilla is less strong than in proterosuchids (see [69]). For example, the pre- and postnarial processes are nearly complete in NMQR 3257 and they do not converge to completely close the posterior end of the naris, and the palatal process and alveolar margin are at a shallower angle to each other (e.g., BP/1/5760a and BP/1/6232n) than in for example, Proterosuchus fergusi.\n\nWhere the ventral edge of the premaxilla is adequately preserved to make a complete count there are six alveoli (possibly five in NMQR 3257). The slightly smaller right premaxilla of BP/1/5525 might have held fewer than six teeth but the anterior edge is too incomplete to make a complete count with confidence. Five teeth occur in the documented material of E. africanus [20], G. prima ([16], [68]; pers. obs.), and S. shansisuchus (DJG, pers. obs.; [14]; [17]: 127 contra table 11). At first glance, NMQR 3257 (Fig. 10) appears to differ notably from the other (Fig. 9) G. madiba premaxillae and from the premaxilla of G. prima, and bears closer resemblance to the premaxilla of Sarmatosuchus otschevi. However, the alveolar margin of NMQR 3257 is substantially eroded and incomplete, especially posteriorly, and much of the lateral surface of the premaxillary body (laterally covering the alveoli) has also been lost. The specimen is also substantially smaller than the known premaxillae of G. prima and most of the known G. madiba premaxillae, and when this, and the erosion of NMQR 3257, are taken into account there is little difference in overall form.\n\nMaxilla.\n\nAll preserved examples (Fig. 11) are incomplete (BP/1/5525, right maxilla, possible fragment of second right maxilla; BP/1/6232m, right maxilla; BP/1/7138, haematite-encrusted left maxilla). The ventral, tooth-bearing margin is markedly convex along most of its length (except posteriorly) in lateral view, and holds at least 13 teeth but, based on comparison of the preserved fragments with maxillae of other erythrosuchids, especially G. prima, probably not more than 18. The anterior ascending process (forming the anterodorsal border of the antorbital fenestra) is missing in all specimens, but its base lies above the approximately fourth and fifth preserved alveoli in BP/1/5525. The border of the antorbital fenestra is damaged in all specimens, although there is a slightly curved thickening at the anterior end of the ventral margin of the fenestra in BP/1/5525 (Fig. 11A: th) that likely was continuous with a ridge on the ascending process. A small part of the antorbital fossa appears to be preserved in BP/1/7138 (Fig. 11G: afo). The palatal process is restricted to the anterior of the maxilla, anterior to the base of the ascending process (Fig. 11: pap). The medial surface bears a low step running subparallel to the ventral (alveolar) margin of the maxilla (Fig. 11B, H: step). Somewhat irregular and not well-preserved interdental plates are present, particularly in BP/1/5525 and BP/1/7138 (Fig. 11H: idp). The posterior part of the maxilla has a thick ventral and medial portion, and a thin sheet-like dorsal and lateral portion (BP/1/7138, Fig. 11H) beneath the antorbital fenestra, as also described for E. africanus ([20]: 17). Because all of the maxillae are damaged it is not possible to determine if they expanded in height posteriorly, as in G. prima. The lateral surface of the maxilla has a slightly rugose surface texture below the antorbital fenestra.\n\nA–C, BP/1/5525, right maxilla in lateral (A), medial (B) and ventral (C) views.

The anterior part of the bone has broken away. The bone has a rugose external surface texture, and its dorsal surface is gently concave medially, towards the contact with the frontal. The roof slightly overhangs the incompletely preserved descending process of the prefrontal. The lateral edge of the prefrontal is thickened dorsoventrally, and medially the element is thinner (excavated ventrally) adjacent to the contact with the frontal. The lateral surface bears a broad, primarily subhorizontal, shallow groove (Fig. 12C: gr), which trends anterodorsal-posteroventral adjacent to the orbital margin. A similar groove is present in E. africanus [20]. The prefrontal formed the anterodorsal corner of the orbital rim.\n\nA–C, BP/1/6226a, partial right prefrontal in dorsal (A), ventral (B) and lateral (C) views.

The frontal is broken anteriorly, and damaged along its medial margin. It appears to have formed at least a small portion of the orbital margin. Ventrally, a well-developed transverse ridge forms the anterior margin of a concavity on the frontal and parietal that (based on comparison with G. prima) articulated with the laterosphenoid. Curved ridges on the dorsal and ventral margins of the parietal represent the margins of the right supratemporal fossa.\n\nParietal.\n\nBeyond the fragment of parietal present in the partial skull roof of BP/1/5525, only a single, partial parietal is preserved (BP/1/6739), representing the thin occipital flange of the left side (Fig. 12F–G). The posterior surface of the flange is gently concave, and is thickened at its dorsal margin (such that the flange has a somewhat T-shaped cross section). The preserved piece bears a small tubercle dorsomedially on the posterior surface, present also in E. africanus [20]. The occipital flange of the parietal of G. madiba has a tightly curved dorsolateral margin in posteromedial/anterolateral view. In this respect it is this more similar to G. prima as figured by Ochev [68] than E. africanus as figured by Gower [20] but we are not convinced that this is a generic difference because of variation in E. africanus ([20]: fig. 9) and because the shape of this flange varies depending on the view (see for example the more posteroventral view presented by [54]: fig. 1).\n\nPostorbital.\n\nThe best example is preserved as part of the holotype. Several additionally fragmentary postorbitals (BP/1/6232ad, partial left postorbital; BP/1/6232ag, Fig. 12H, smaller partial left postorbital; BP/1/6791, partial left postorbital; BP/1/7133, partial left postorbital) demonstrate that the boss is not a peculiarity of individual variation, and that it becomes proportionally larger and more pronounced in larger specimens.\n\nSquamosal.\n\nNo squamosal could be identified among the preserved material.\n\nJugal.\n\nBeyond the almost complete left jugal of the holotype, the only pieces of jugal identified among the other material are very short sections bearing the lateral boss (BP/1/6226b, 6232g, h, i, 6734; Fig. 12I, J). In as much as the larger bosses are on deeper (dorsoventrally, not only transversely thicker) pieces of bone, it seems that (absolutely and proportionately) larger bosses were present on larger jugals. In smaller specimens the boss is proportionately smaller and less spherical, but is still considerably more prominent than the low subhorizontal ridge that is present in the same position in G. prima ([68]: fig. 3; [23]: plate 11, fig. 6).\n\nQuadratojugal.\n\nThe left quadratojugal BP/1/7215 has an acute angle between the ascending and anterior processes seen in lateral view (Fig. 13A–C). The facet for the posterior process of the jugal along the dorsolateral edge of the anterior process is long (Fig. 13A: s.jg). The form of this facet means that the anterior process (which is broken anteriorly) has an approximately teardrop-shaped cross section, being thickened ventrally and tapering dorsally. The lateral surface of the anterior process is notably rugose, especially posteriorly. The quadratojugal is almost excluded from the ventral border of the lateral temporal fenestra, but might have contributed to the very posterior part of this border. The dorsal process of the quadratojugal made a short but notable contribution to the lower part of the posterior border of the lateral temporal fenestra, more similar to the condition in G. prima [16], [68] than E. africanus [20] or S. shansisuchus ([17]: fig. 13; DJG, pers. obs.) in which an elongate ventral process of the squamosal excludes the quadratojugal from the posterior border of the laterotemporal fenestra. The dorsal process of the quadratojugal expands in anteroposterior width towards its dorsal margin. Its posteromedial margin (where it articulated with the quadrate) is broken. Dorsally, the articular surface for the squamosal is marked by a dorsoventrally descending groove on the lateral surface (Fig. 13B). The lateral surface towards the dorsal tip of the ascending process is markedly thickened transversely (Fig. 13A: thk), a feature not documented or seen by us in other erythrosuchids and potentially representing an additional autapomorphy of the new species. A smaller right quadratojugal (BP/1/6735) is generally similar in morphology to BP/1/7215 (Fig. 13D, E).\n\nA–C, BP/1/7215, left quadratojugal in lateral (A) and anterior (B) and medial (C) views.

Several partial quadrates are preserved (BP/1/5525, partial right quadrate; BP/1/6232e, left quadrate ventral condyle; BP/1/6232d, right quadrate ventral condyle; BP/1/6232f, left quadrate ventral condyle; Fig. 13F–K). The quadrate ventral condyle is somewhat bipartite, with the lateral part drawn out into a flange at its lateral margin (only well-preserved in BP/1/6232d). A short region immediately above the lateral margin of the condyle bears a posterolateral facet that was overlapped by the quadratojugal. The central thickened part of the dorsal end of the right quadrate of BP/1/5525 is also preserved, but is damaged along anterolateral and anteromedial surfaces (Fig. 13F–H). A prominence is present on the anterior surface of the proximal end (visible in dorsal view but extends onto proximal end of anterior edge; Fig. 13G: prm) as in, for example, E. africanus (BP/1/4680) and G. prima (PIN 951/57). The central rod has a transversely narrow dorsal end and the posteromedial surface is strongly concave dorsally. This best-preserved quadrate is not complete enough to determine its length, nature of possible articulation with the quadratojugal dorsolaterally, or presence/absence of a quadrate foramen.\n\nBraincase.\n\nThere are at least nine fragments of braincases preserved among the new material. Most of these are fragments of parabasisphenoid (e.g., 6232o, v, w, x, y) but there are also multiple fragments of the paroccipital process and parts of the lateral and dorsal walls of the endocranial cavity (BP/1/5760, 6232z, 7342). The most completely preserved piece of braincase is that of BP/1/5525 (Figs. 14, 15). There are no unambiguous laterosphenoids or anterior (cultriform processes of) parabasisphenoids among the preserved material.\n\nA–D, ventral and posterior part of braincase of BP/1/5525 in posterior (A), dorsal (B), anterior (C) and left lateral (D) views, E, Right posterolateral (and slightly ventral) view of fragmentary parabasisphenoid, BP/1/6232y (the basipterygoid processes and right basal tuber of the parabasisphenoid are missing).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111154.g014\n\nInterpretive line drawings of specimens shown in Fig. 13.

The key features include a parabasisphenoid that is verticalized (sensu [54]), with the basal tubera lying almost directly above (rather than posterior to) the basipterygoid processes. The lateral surface of the parabasisphenoid above the basipterygoid process bears a semilunar depression (sensu [70]). The foramina for the internal carotid arteries are on the posterior surface, and there is a strong intertuberal plate (sensu [54]). The basioccipital seemingly lacks the small medial tubercle between the basal tubera seen in G. prima [54] but most specimens do not preserve this region and BP/1/5525 is partly eroded here. The ventral ramus of the opisthotic is substantial and clearly visible in posterior and lateral views, and the posterior face of its distal end is tightly and substantially in contact with the lateral edge of the dorsal part of the basal tuber of the basioccipital. The exoccipitals make midline contact on the floor of the endocranial cavity anteriorly, and diverge on the floor of the foramen magnum posteriorly. There appears to be a metotic foramen (i.e., the metotic fissure remains undivided by bone: [71]).\n\nA, posterior view of isolated parabasisphenoid, BP/1/6232w.

The notochordal pit and condylar “neck” are well defined. The basal tubera of the basioccipital are very similar to those of G. prima except perhaps in the absence of a medial tubercle. The large distal end of the ventral ramus of the opisthotic and its relation to the basal tuber of the basioccipital (posteriorly) and an unossified gap (ventrally) are as in G. prima. The supraoccipital is probably excluded from the border of the foramen magnum but is clearly exposed further forward on the roof of the endocranial cavity between the thickened anterodorsal parts of the prootics (BP/1/7342). The posterior edges of the clinoid processes of the parabasisphenoid are deeply incised. However, the foramina for the cerebral branches of the internal carotid arteries are on the posterior surface of the parabasisphenoid. Support for the interpretation [54] that the arteries entered the posteroventral surface of the parabasisphenoid rather than behind the clinoid processes (as in many crown-group-archosaurs, [71]) is found in one fragment (BP/1/6232y, Fig. 14E, 15E) in which the channel leading from the putative carotid foramen is seen extending towards the hypophyseal fossa, and lying deeper (further medially) within the bone than the incised posterior border of the clinoid processs. The form of the basal tubera of the parabsisphenoid, the intertuberal plate (e.g., BP/1/5525: Figs. 14, 15; BP/1/6232w: Fig. 16), and the topography of the floor of the endocranial cavity (BPI/1/5525: Figs. 14B, 15B) is as in G. prima, and the positions of the abducens and facial nerve channels are also likely very similar except it is unclear precisely how they are positioned relative to the boundary between prootic and parabasisphenoid. The floor (BP/1/5525: Figs. 14B, 15B) and ceiling (BP/1/7342: Fig. 16A) of the vestibule are very similar to those of G. prima as far as can be determined.\n\n(2) Differences. Only a single foramen (not two) can be seen for the hypoglossal nerve on each side, although this area is not well preserved in any specimen. The dorsal surface of the supraoccipital is perhaps less prominently and extensively rugose than in G. prima. The medial (proximal) end of the posterior surface of the paroccipital process bears a well-defined depression, though this is perhaps in a slightly more medial position than in G. prima. The semilunar depression on the lateral surface of the basal tuber of the parabasisphenoid is present, though the central portion is perhaps less incised than in the specimen of G. prima figured by Gower & Sennikov [54]. The form of the parabasisphenoid is very similar to that of G. prima, but the basisphenoid and basioccipital-basisphenoid fossae either side of the intertuberal plate seem to be relatively smaller (e.g., BP/1/5525, 6232v, 6232w), although there is clearly some intraspecific variation in the details of this region. The anteriorly converging ridges bordering the basisphenoid fossa come to lie immediately behind the foramina for the cerebral branches of the internal carotid arteries, as in G. prima; however these ridges mostly converge and meet strongly in the midline, though in two specimens (BP/1/6232o, 6232y) they are lower and more rounded. The vast majority of the cultriform process of the parabasisphenoid is not preserved in any specimen, but in BP/1/5525 its base does not seem to be as tall as the specimen of G. prima figured by Gower & Sennikov ([54]: fig. 2C), so that the ventral edge is not as low. There might not be a basioccipital medial tubercle below the occipital condyle and between the basal tubera of the basioccipital, though this region is not well preserved in BP/1/5525 (Fig. 14A).\n\n(3) Extent of similarity or difference unclear. The exoccipitals diverge posteriorly along the top of the basioccipital (floor of the foramen magnum) in G. prima [54] and perhaps slightly less strongly in G. madiba although the small amount of disarticuation in this region of BP/1/5525 makes this a little unclear. The nature of the contact between supraoccipital and parietal/postparietal is unclear in G. madiba, and it is unclear whether or not there is a narrow subhorizontal ridge on the lateral surface of the prootic below the trigeminal foramen or whether the edge of crista prootica is curved simply (right side of BP/1/5525) or is slightly sinusoidal (perhaps left side of BP/1/5525) in lateral view. The number of external foramina for the facial nerve is unclear in G. madiba, and the laterosphenoid is not known. The floor of the endocranial cavity is not well preserved in BP/1/5525, so detailed comparisons with G. prima cannot be made, including the presence of nutrient foramina, the exact form of contacts between elements, and the position and form of perilymphatic foramen, but the general configuration in G. madiba is clearly similar to that of G. prima. Similarly imperfect preservation of the roof and walls of the endocranial cavity (including the degree of ossification of the medial walls of the vestibule) in the G madiba material limits detailed comparison between the species, though there are no obvious differences to the condition in G. prima. Contrary to a previous description ([54]: 886) we strongly doubt that the laterosphenoid of G. prima was likely excluded from the border of the trigeminal foramen. The condition in G. madiba is not clear based on the available material.\n\nDentary.\n\nThe best-preserved dentary (NMQR 3051), a left example, is laterally concave along its longitudinal axis and has 14 alveoli, mostly holding complete or partially preserved teeth (Fig. 17A–D). There is no clear evidence of additional alveoli having been present behind the 14th. The apicobasally tallest preserved tooth lies in position 3 (followed closely by 4 and 5). The first three teeth are slightly procumbent, whereas more posterior crowns project posterodorsally. Anteriorly the symphyseal region is not notably differentiated from the remainder of the medial surface of the bone. In lateral view, the anterior end of the dentary is not dorsoventrally expanded in outline, but instead tapers slightly towards its anterior termination. The external surface bears a number of nutrient foramina, the largest of which form a series of three openings that lie along the anterior edge of the dentary, ventral to the first three teeth and slightly below the alveolar margin (exactly the same in NMQR 3049); there are foramina here also in G. prima but with variation in the number, size and exact position. Medially there is a distinct step a short distance ventral to the alveolar margin. Dorsal to this step are a series of well-preserved, triangular interdental plates, one present between each pair of adjacent teeth. Two additional partial dentaries are present in the Johannesburg collection (BP/1/6232k and BP/1/7153, Fig. 17E), and an additional anterior fragment of a right dentary in the NM collection (NMQR 3049). It is clear from the medial surface of the dentary of BP/1/7153 that the Meckelian canal was held primarily by the dentary and that it tapered in depth (transversely) and height posterior to the symphyseal region. The most complete dentary known for G. madiba (NMQR 3049) is notably more curved in dorsal and ventral view (laterally concave, medially convex) than examples of this element of G. prima. Taken at face value, this would indicate that the mandibles of G. madiba were relatively shorter and at a greater angle to one another than in G. prima, but the alternative explanation of differential deformation during preservation cannot be ruled out.\n\nA–D, cast of anterior part of left mandible of NMQR 3051 in lateral (A), posterior (B), dorsal (C) and medial (D) views.

Posteriorly it is almost as deep as the dentary, extending from the ventral margin of the mandible to the alveolar margin. For most of its length, however, the splenial does not extend to the ventral mandibular margin. Posteriorly the splenial is gently concave along its vertical axis, but this might at least partially represent collapse into the Meckelian canal. The posterior end of the splenial has an L-shaped cross section ventrally, while the dorsal edge curves away dorsomedially to form a V-shaped groove between it and the dentary (Fig. 17B). This groove possibly held the coronoid, if this was elongate as in G. prima [68] and E. africanus [20]. The mid section and anterior end of the splenial maintain a dorsomedially curved dorsal edge, but the ventral edge is more planar (not L-shaped). The anterior end of the splenial is incompletely preserved, but it seems likely that it terminated posterior to the symphysis.\n\nCoronoid and prearticular.\n\nNo unambiguous examples are known. A small fragment of prearticular is probably preserved in contact with the left articular of NMQR 3049, but nothing of note is worth describing. A dorsally open groove between the dentary and splenial (Fig. 17B) likely held an elongate coronoid, as in G. prima ([68]: fig. 6).\n\nSurangular and articular.\n\nThe only unambiguous partial surangulars are posterior fragments preserved tightly in articulation with the corresponding articulars (NMQR 3049 left and right; BP/1/5763b (Fig. 17I–L) right; 6232b left; 7340 right; 7153 left; JNN 99.4.30 left). This region of the mandible does not seem to differ notably from that of other erythrosuchids. The retroarticular process of the articular comprises a transverse concavity (perhaps more concave than in G. prima) immediately behind the cotyle, and behind this a short, thickened process that bears a laterally compressed, hook-like ascending process ( = “dorsomedial projection” of Nesbitt [7]; Fig. 17I–J, K: dmp) on its posteromedial corner. This process ascends more prominently and is more hooked than in E. africanus [20], but is very similar to that of G. prima ([68]: fig. 6). In all specimens where this region is preserved and prepared there is a small foramen immediately beyond the anteromedial corner of the transverse concavity (Fig. 17K: ct), this might represent the route of the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve. As in G. prima and E. africanus there is a short, robust anteroventromedially projecting tubercle medial to the posterior corner of the cotyle (Fig. 17I–J: vmp; = “ventromedial process” of [7]). As in other erythrosuchids, this is not dorsoventrally compressed and dorsally does not carry a medial extension of the concavity between the cotyle and the retroarticular process such as is seen in, for example, at least some rauisuchians (e.g. [72]). The anterior end of the medial face of the articular bears a facet for the prearticular. Level with the posterior end of this facet, the surangular bears a large surangular foramen (Fig. 17J, K: saf).\n\nAngular.\n\nThere are at least two elongate, shallowly angled elements that likely represent incomplete angulars of G. madiba (BP/1/5525, left? and BP/1/6232c, right: Fig. 17F, G). The medial surface is less tall than the lateral surface. Posteriorly, the element is transversely flattened, where it would overlap the surangular, and anteriorly the medial surface bears a shallow, posteriorly tapering concavity that perhaps represents a facet, probably for the splenial (Fig. 17G: s.spl). The posterior surface of the anterior end of the left mandible of NMQR 3051 shows the probable anterior end of the angular, slightly L-shaped, with a small ventromedial projection that lies above the ventrolateral projection of the splenial, and a dorsally tapering lateral blade lying close to the medial surface of the dentary (Fig. 17B). The central region of the mandible is not well known in proterosuchians (sensu [10]) and further interpretation of fragmentary and disarticulated material is not currently possible with confidence.\n\nDentition.\n\nThe dentition is clearly thecodont with deep-rooted teeth held in well-defined sockets (Figs. 9, 10, 11, 17). There is some variation in the tightness of contact between tooth and bone among specimens, but also along the tooth-bearing margin of a single element and even around the perimeter of a single tooth. For example, although the less fully erupted maxillary teeth of BP/1/5525 are thecodont, the more fully erupted teeth are ankylothecodont. In our view the instances of close bone-tooth association are not prevalent or strongly developed enough for the implantation as a whole to be considered ankylothecodont, and the dentition is overall more thecodont than in, for example, Proterosuchus and Sarmatosuchus [69]. The long tooth roots are subcircular to oval in cross section. The crowns are only moderately laterally compressed and recurved (e.g. BP/1/7153). Both anterior and posterior edge of teeth are serrated. There are four to five denticles within 1 mm on a replacement maxillary tooth in BP/1/5525 (Fig. 11I) and a similar number in a premaxillary tooth of BP/1/6232n (Fig. 9G). Preserved replacement teeth emerge on the medial side of functional teeth.\n\nIntercentra.\n\nOther than the atlas-axis complex there are no intercentra identified among the preserved material. Intercentra were likely present throughout the presacral column, based on ventrally bevelled centra (Figs. 18, 19) and comparison with other proterosuchians (e.g., Proterosuchus fergusi: [73]; E. africanus: [20]).\n\nA, atlantal intercentrum of BP/1/5525 in anterior view.

The atlas intercentrum is approximately semicircular (in anterior and posterior views), with a bevelled posterior ventral edge and a single lateral facet for a rib on each side. The axis is broken and preserves only part of the centrum, the anterior end of which is typical for early archosauriforms in having a vertical articular face dorsally, probably for the atlas centrum, and a large bevelled region below this for articulation with an intercentrum. There are no rib apophyses low on the anterolateral edge of the axis centrum, and the likely area for the diapophysis (dorsally on the lateral edge of the anterior end of the centrum) and facet for articulation with the atlas neural arch is not very well preserved or prepared.\n\nThe only vertebra found close to the holotype material is a broken anterior cervical (BP/1/5760b), with the neural spine mostly missing and the remaining part of the neural arch largely detached from the centrum. It is one of the anteriormost cervical vertebrae, as indicated by the position of the parapophysis at the ventral end of the anterior edge of the centrum with the diapophysis a short distance above this. The centrum is marginally longer than it is tall, with the articular faces somewhat offset from each other, the top and bottom of the posterior face lying a little lower than those of the anterior face. The ventral edge is moderately arched in lateral view and the body of the centrum is waisted in ventral view. The base of the neural spine is much shorter than the length of the centrum and lies towards the posterior end of the neural arch.\n\nMultiple other cervical vertebrae are present (BP/1/5525, BP/1/6232ae, ai, al, BP/1/7234, 7327), but in nearly all cases only the centrum and the base of the neural arch are preserved (Fig. 18). Two anterior cervical centra preserved as part of BP/1/5525 (Fig. 18C–F) are strongly waisted/pinched and approximately as long as they are tall (also in BP/1/7327). Their apophyses are positioned far anteriorly, the parapophyses far ventrally and the diapophyses a short distance below the dorsal edges of the centra. The more anterior of these two centra (with a more ventrally positioned diapophysis) has a single midventral ridge extending back to a little beyond halfway from the anterior edge of the centrum, fading out a little in front of a small triangular (tapering anteriorly) rugosity that is continuous with the ventral margin of the posterior articulatory surface of the centrum. The more posterior example has a relatively smooth, flat and featureless ventral surface. The faces of the cervical centra are subcircular, perhaps taller than wide in the more anterior example, and they are offset with the posterior face extending further ventrally than the anterior one. An anterior cervical in BP/1/5360 has low ventral midline keel/ridge.\n\nMore posteriorly within the cervical column the centra are more strongly waisted and relatively shorter (and taller) and the two articulatory faces are slightly less offset. In addition the diapophysis is positioned further dorsally and posteriorly, away from the centrum and on a short ventrolateral process of the neural arch. There are no obviously posterior cervical neural arches closely resembling the ‘pectorals’ (sensu [20]) preserved among the vertebral remains. However, a couple of disarticulated centra with partial neural arches, BP/1/7338 (Fig. 18G–I) and BP/1/6232al, are perhaps from this region because they are short (anteroposteriorly), deeply waisted, have diapophyses on laterally projecting processes and parapophyses still low down and just behind the anterior face of the centrum. There is no evidence for three-headed ribs in the ‘pectoral’ region based on the fragmentary vertebral remains, though the presence of this feature is indicated by an incomplete rib (see below).\n\nSeveral relatively short (anteroposteriorly), broken neural spines preserved as part of BP/1/5525 are possibly from cervical vertebrae because they are transversely expanded distally. The distal ends vary in outline from circular to oval, and they have rugose surfaces that extend onto the distal end of the lateral surfaces of the spines.\n\nDorsal vertebrae.\n\nThe preserved dorsal centra are all constricted, and bevelled ventrally for intercentra. BP/1/7135 (Fig. 19D–E) and 6233b (Fig. 19A–C) are anterior to middorsals, incompletely prepared and lacking parts of the zygapophyses as well as the neural spines. The centra are marginally longer than tall with oval faces. The parapophysis is anteriorly positioned at the top of the face of the centrum, the diapophysis is behind and above this on the neural arch with a very low paradiapophyseal lamina between the two apophyses (the dorsal proximal part of the two headed rib is in articulation on the left of BP/1/7135). Anterodorsal to the apophyses are low prezygadia- and prezygaparapophyseal laminae that bound a shallow prezygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossa. There are also spinodiapophyseal and centrodiapophyseal fossae. There are no (or very minor) laminae posterior to the diapophysis. The position of incomplete dorsal vertebrae was estimated by comparison with other erythrosuchids, especially E. africanus and G. prima.\n\nBP/1/6232ak is a mid to posterior dorsal. The centrum is about as long as tall with oval to subcircular faces. The parapophysis is still distinct from the diapophysis but more dorsally positioned than in the two dorsals described immediately above. The diapophysis and most of the neural arch is not preserved, but it appears to have strongly overhung the centrodiapophyseal fossa.\n\nBP/1/6232aj is possibly a posterior dorsal with a centrum that is as long as tall. It has a confluent para- and diapophysis without prezygadia- or prezygaparapophyseal laminae or a prezgapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossa. There is no notable posterior centrodiapophyseal lamina, and a low postzygadiapophyseal lamina and a spinodiapophyseal fossa. This vertebra resembles that of E. africanus figured by Gower ([20]: fig. 24E).\n\nSacral vertebrae.\n\nBoth of the two sacral vertebrae of BP/1/5525 are preserved (Fig. 20), and are not fused to one another. The first sacral vertebra is smaller than the second (with a shorter and less broad centrum: 33 mm long), and only its right rib is well preserved. The centrum is spool-like, with no ventral ridge or groove, and with shallowly concave, subcircular articular faces. The large rib attaches to the central part of the vertebra, and extends laterally and slightly ventrally. The distal end of the rib is broadly expanded anteroposteriorly and the distal surface is convex in dorsal view, and formed a broad attachment with the ilium slightly posterior to the point of contact between the pubic peduncle and preacetabular process of the dorsal blade. At the posterior margin of its distal end the rib has an articular surface that contacted the rib of the second sacral vertebra. The second sacral centrum is larger than the first (42 mm long), is also spool-shaped, and has a very large rib attaching to the central part of the vertebra across the neurocentral junction. This rib also extends laterally and slightly ventrally and at its distal end is massively expanded into an articular surface that in lateral view is arched posteroventrally. This rib articulated with the ilium medial to the base of the postacetabular process of the dorsal blade and the posterior part of the acetabulum, and also articulated with the rib of the first sacral vertebra. The second rib has a groove on its distal articular surface that matches a ridge within the sacral rib facet of the ilium.\n\nA–C, sacral vertebra 1 in anterior (A), posterior (B) and ventral (C) views.

This is interpreted as a first sacral. The base of the rib extends to the anterior edge of the centrum and forms an additional articular surface alongside the anterior central face, very much as in the large E. africanus specimen BMNH R3592 and unlike the smaller G. madiba material of BP/1/5525, suggesting that this feature might vary with ontogeny.\n\nCaudal vertebrae.\n\nBP/1/5525 includes an anterior caudal centrum (Fig. 21A–B), and BP/1/6232ac (Fig. 21C–D) is a more complete but less well preserved anterior caudal. The best preserved anterior caudal is BP/1/7335 (Fig. 21E–H), which bears a close resemblance to the approximately homologous element of E. africanus figured by Gower ([20]: fig. 26). Its centrum is not strongly constricted, marginally taller than long, with a posterior face that extends ventrally beyond the level of the anterior face; both faces are subcircular and with weak to moderate ventral bevels. The proximal end of a single-headed, stout caudal rib is firmly attached centrally in the region where the centrum-arch suture probably lies. There are no notable laminae surrounding the rib apophysis, and the only notable lateral fossa is spinodiapophyseal. Posteriorly there is a well-developed spinopostzygapophyseal fossa.\n\nA–B, BP/1/5525, anterior caudal vertebra in anterior (A) and left lateral (B) views.

The neural spines are broken but the rest of the arches are preserved, as are the bases of the ribs, the anteriormost one of which is slightly posterolaterally directed (the other two more lateral) and all three somewhat dorsoventrally compressed. The proximal end of a haemal arch is preserved at least between the second and third of these vertebrae.\n\nOther caudal vertebrae are not well represented and there is no indication of how long the complete tail might have been. BP/1/7329 is the best preserved likely mid to posterior caudal (Fig. 21K, L). The centrum is substantially longer than tall and only moderately constricted, with strongly bevelled ventral edges to the articulatory faces. The posterior bevel is B-shaped for articulation with a haemal arch and there is a low double keel. The base of a small, single-headed rib lies centrally, slightly above the top of the body of the centrum. The neural spine projects posterodorsally and the anterior margin of its base bears a small accessory spine, and there is a shallow spinodiapophyseal fossa. BP/1/7334 is a slightly less completely preserved but very similar vertebra (Fig. 21J) in which the accessory neural spine is broken or absent, and the spinodiapophyseal fossa slightly better developed.\n\nThere are some isolated caudal vertebrae that might more tentatively be referred to G. madiba on the basis of superficial similarity to E. africanus and the lack of evidence of more than one erythrosuchid from this geological unit, but these are incomplete and disarticulated and do not provide much information other than having longer, lower centra (approaching twice as long as tall) with strongly bevelled edges and low double keels, and having smaller but still centrally positioned rib bases.\n\nRibs.\n\nA probable rib shaft fragment is preserved among the holotype material (Fig. 8), but the best-preserved presacral rib (NMQR 3257, Fig. 19M) provides evidence suggestive of a tripartite contact with its corresponding vertebra, but no vertebrae with matching apophyses are currently known. Three-headed ribs are known in some Triassic archosauriforms, including the erythrosuchids G. prima and E. africanus [20].\n\nPectoral girdle.\n\nA relatively complete, but fragmented and poorly preserved, right scapula is known (BP/1/7152: Fig. 22A–B). The far distal end is incomplete. The anterior margin is broken and poorly preserved, and the acromion region is very poorly preserved. The long axis of the element is slightly bowed, the medial surface concave, the lateral convex. Proximally the scapula is tapered anteriorly and strongly thickened posteriorly, with a concave ventrally facing glenoid. The posterior margin of the blade (above the expanded proximal end) is nearly straight in lateral view. The precise narrowness of the neck of the blade and the degree of expansion of the distal end cannot be determined accurately because of damage to the anterior margin. There is a low ridge on the medial surface of the blade, close and subparallel to the preserved anterior margin and slightly distal to the midpoint of the preserved length, similar to the condition in E. africanus ([20]: fig. 29A) and G. prima (PIN 2394/5 and 951/4). The proximal end of a left scapula of NMQR 3051 (Fig. 22C–F) is better preserved, and the posteroventral corner of the lateral surface has a roughened surface, likely for the origin of the m. triceps (Fig. 22C: m.tri). The acromion region of NMQR 3051 shows a marked transition along the anterior edge from a thicker more proximal part to thinner more distal part, there being a subhorizontal ridge here that extends back from the anterior edge of the lateral face (Fig. 22C: l.rid). The scapula of G. madiba is very similar to that of G. prima in all respects. The overall form (concave anterior margin in lateral view, expanded distal end) of the scapula of Garjainia is like that of Shansisuchus [17], [65] and E. africanus [15], [20] and unlike that of Proterosuchus [73] and Sarmatosuchus otschevi [69].\n\nNMQR 3051 includes a partial left coracoid (Fig. 23) that matches in size the partial scapula of the same specimen. The element as a whole was likely approximately semicircular, generally concave medially and convex laterally, transversely fairly thick dorsally, and preserves the broad and largely featureless likely ventral part of the glenoid (Fig. 23A: glen). Immediately below the posterior end of the glenoid, the lateral surface of the coracoid bears a small scar-like feature, and further below this there is a lateral ridge along a somewhat thickened region (Fig. 23A: rid). In all respects the coracoid is very similar to that of G. prima ([9]; PIN 2394/5). The clavicles and interclavicle of G. madiba are unknown among the available material.\n\nHumerus.\n\nThe humerus is known from three right-sided examples: an almost complete element (with damage to the proximal and distal ends, BP/1/7336: Fig. 24A–D), a similarly sized distal end (NMQR 3051: Fig. 24E–G) and larger midshaft (BP/1/6233a). These closely resemble each other and the humeri of E. africanus [20], Shansisuchus [17], [65] and G. prima ([9]; PIN 951/36). The deltopectoral crest of G. madiba, even in the largest specimen, is proportionally much smaller than in the large holotype and BMNH R3592 of E. africanus ([74]: figs. 1, 2; [75]: fig. 13; [20]: fig. 30) in that it is less continuous with proximal terminal end, less prominent, and extends shorter distance down shaft. The prominent part of the deltopectoral crest of G. madiba has a rugose edge and extends about one third down the length of the humerus in BP/1/7336.\n\nThe long axes of the proximal and distal ends of the humerus of G. madiba are twisted relative to one another at approximately 30 degrees. The midshaft is dorsoventrally compressed relative to its width (depth is two thirds of width). Distally there is a well-developed lateral supinator ridge (Fig. 24: supr) that extends away proximally from the supinator process bordering the ectepicondylar groove (Fig. 24: ectgr). The lateral part (ectepicondyle) of the distal end is more expanded than the medial part (entepicondyle).\n\nUlna and radius.\n\nA large right ulna (BP/1/6232r, Fig. 25A–F) is similar to that of G. prima, S. shansisuchus and E. africanus, though slightly more slender than the larger holotype of the latter ([74]: fig. 7; [20]: fig. 31). The proximal end is subtriangular and notably larger than the oval distal end. The anterior edge (sensu [20]) is narrower than the posterior edge. The terminal surfaces are not as heavily ossified as the surface of the shaft but the posterior edge is clearly longer than the anterior edge such that the ulna had an olecranon process of sorts.\n\nBP/1/7325 is an incomplete limb bone (Fig. 25G–I) that we identify as the proximal end of a radius on the basis of its similarity to that element of the holotype of E. africanus [20], [74] and of S. shansisuchus ([17]: fig. 28c, possibly upside down). The shaft is oval in transverse section, expanded transversely and compressed dorsoventrally, and tapers slightly distally, the proximal end suboval, the distal end subcircular. On the basis of comparison with E. africanus, one surface (ventral sensu [20]) of the proximal surface in proximal view is flat to concave and the other (dorsal) convex.\n\nPelvic girdle.\n\nThe ilium is represented in BP/1/5525 by an almost complete left element (missing the preactabular process of the dorsal blade; dorsal margin of blade damaged along its length; ventral margin of dorsal blade damaged at the point at which the second sacral rib contacted the base of the postacetabular process: Fig. 26A–B), parts of the right element (acetabulum including crest and posterior end of postacetabular process of dorsal blade: Figs. 26C, 27), and a fragment (supraacetabular rim) of a second right ilium. At least one other partial ilium is known (BP/1/7333, left acetabular fragment and broken postacetabular process of dorsal blade: Fig. 26D–F). The most striking feature of the ilium is the exceptionally long postacetabular process of the dorsal blade, approximately as long as (or slightly longer than) the maximum length of the acetabular part of the ilium. In this respect it differs from the corresponding element of E. africanus, S. shansisuchus, and G. prima and thus represents a putative autapomorphy of the new species. This postacetabular process has a convex lateral surface towards its posterior end and its ventral margin is folded inwards (deeper transversely on ventral edge than dorsal edge). The dorsal margin of the process appears to be slightly curved upwards towards its posterior end (BP/1/7333). The supraacetabular rim is prominent, anteriorly and dorsally (not posterodorsally). As in E. africanus and S. shansisuchus the surface for articulation with the pubis is shorter than that for the ischium, and the latter surface extends a substantial distance posterior to the strong waist between the dorsal blade and acetabular region of the ilium. Medially there are two large scars for the sacral ribs that are clearly delimited by ridges; the first is medial to the acetabulum and supraacetabular rim, the second is medial to the base of the postacetabular process. The second rib facet has an arched ridge close to its dorsal margin that fits into a groove on the lateral margin of the sacral rib. The moderately downturned sacral ribs means that the acetabulum faced ventrolaterally.\n\nBP/1/5525, right pelvis in lateral (A) and medial (B) views.

The ischium is similar to that of E. africanus and G. prima, with a straight ventral margin in lateral/medial view, unlike the W-shaped edge in S. shansisuchus [17]. Anterodorsally the ischium is expanded to form an articular surface for the ilium and the ischial contribution to the acetabulum. The remainder of the element is plate-like and flattened in the dorsomedial to ventrolateral plane. This plate-like part is thickened dorsally, at its ventromedial margin (where it articulated with its antimere) and at the posterior end.\n\nPoorly preserved partial pubes are preserved in BP/1/5525, including at least the acetabular portion of the right pubis (Fig. 27) and laterodistal end of the pubic apron of the left (Fig. 28F). A better proximal right pubis is preserved in BP/1/7328 (Fig. 28C–E). The proximal end is transversely thickened into a triangular area that articulates with the ilium. Lateral to this, the pubic contribution to the anteroventral part of acetabulum is relatively minor. There is a well-developed curved flange of bone on the proximal end, anteroventral to the acetabulum, which represents the ambiens process. This process resembles that of G. prima (e.g., PIN 951/25), with both being notably more differentiated than the only slightly raised, roughened homologous region in E. africanus and S. shansisuchus [17], [20]. Only the anterior margin of the obturator foramen is preserved (Fig. 28C, E). The distal end of the pubis is like that of E. africanus, S. shansisuchus and G. prima in being L-shaped in transverse section, comprising a lateral rod and medial sheet.\n\nFemur.\n\nThe femur is relatively well known from an almost complete but fragmented right example (BP/1/5767: Fig. 29A–D), three right subproximal ends (BP/1/6232a: Fig. 29E–G, 6232j and an unnumbered specimen) and a distal right end (BP/1/5525). The femur of G. madiba is very similar to that of G. prima (see [9]: fig. 8.5C). It is relatively straight (for an archosauriform femur) in dorsal and ventral views, and there is a large proximal intertrochanteric fossa and a proximally positioned, approximately blade-like internal trochanter. The internal trochanter is positioned further proximally on the ossified part of the femur than in E. africanus, confluent with, but its apex angled away from, the proximal end (similar to the rhynchosaur Hyperodapedon gordoni as figured by [76]). Further distal to the intertrochanteric fossa, the lateral (sensu [18], [20]) edge bears a trochanter probably for insertion of the iliofemoralis muscle. Distally there is a shallow popliteal space and intercondylar groove, and the distal end is similar to that of the femur of G. prima ([23]: plate 15, fig. 2) and E. africanus ([20]: fig. 34E). As with G. prima and E. africanus, the proximal and distal terminal ends of the femur are incompletely ossified and would probably have been formed by cartilage in life.\n\nTibia and fibula.\n\nThe proximal and distal ends of a tibia are preserved in BP/1/5525 (Fig. 29H–L). By comparison with E. africanus (BMNH R3592, right tibia figured by [20]: fig. 35) the proximal end is from the left side (based on the outline of the proximal surface). The proximal end is strongly expanded relative to the shaft and has a rugose proximal surface. The proximal end has an asymmetric outline, expanded laterally and tapering medially. There is no indication of a well-developed cnemial crest. The preserved fragment is not long enough to preserve the pit for the m. puboischiotibialis (though this feature is visible at the distal end of the proximal tibia BP/1/7216). The distal end (possibly not from the same individual bone or side as the proximal end) has a concave end surface and is identified on the basis of similarity with other erythrosuchids in terms of the subcircular shape of the distal end, degree of expansion from shaft, and dissimilarity to other epipodials (for example, the distal end of the ulna is not concave). The shaft is mostly missing, but where the proximal and distal ends are broken it has a subcircular cross section.\n\nA complete but crushed BP/1/7341 epipodial (Fig. 29M–N) is identified as a tibia on the basis that it differs to the ulna and radius and its ends are likely too expanded to be a fibula. The proximal end is strongly expanded, with a suboval terminus, the distal end is less expanded and has an oval and concave end surface. The shaft has an oval cross section. There is a slightly depressed, roughened area (possible muscle-attachment scar) on the ventral surface of the shaft, just proximal to midlength (Fig. 29N: msc).\n\nOsteoderms.\n\nThere are no unambiguous osteoderms among the preserved material. Given the substantial number of archosauromorph specimens known from Subzone A of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone it is likely that osteoderms were absent in G. madiba, but more complete associated material is required to test this further.\n\nReconstruction.\n\nAn artist's impression of G. madiba in life is shown in Fig. 30. This is based on all of the available (type and referred) specimens and is most strongly influenced by photographs and drawings of a mounted, partly reconstructed skeleton of G. prima (and the almost complete holotype skull of that species) previously displayed at PIN."
