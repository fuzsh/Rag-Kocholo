        "text": "Union’s first team girls then took to the turf. They struggled to keep possession for lengthy periods of the first half and failed to convert chances on offer.\n\nGoals by Henze Jaftha, Rosslyn Sparks and Marche Green in the first half, however, saw Union lead by 3 – 0 at half time.\n\nIt was, however, a game of two halves with the Union girls seeming to find their flair in the second half. Union managed to score a further 6 goals with an improved performance. Goals by Rosslyn Sparks, Jenna McNaughton, Laetitia Theron (2), Micela Loock and Jade Shires sealed a 9 – 0 victory.\n\n“There is much work needed to be done this week ahead of a tough fixture against Stirling High School this weekend,” says coach Alvin August.\n\n“The tone will need to set from the word go in order to come home successful.”\n\n“While it can be bought, this is an easy and cheap way to create a pencil sharpener that you can use at your desk without having to walk to the wastebasket every time you need to sharpen a pencil,” says Zack.\n\nMaybe one day Zack will develop a world-changing new invention, who knows?\n\nAll we can say is that at Union, we’re big fans of innovation in all its forms, and we just love it when our learners think out of the box to create something inspired!\n\nThere are two divisions: a junior division for Grades 8 and 9 and a senior division for Grades 10 to 12. Learners who score at least 50% in the first round which was this year written on 12 March qualify for the second round in May. The top (approximately) 100 junior and 100 senior learners from the second round qualify for the final round in July.\n\nThe senior learners who qualified for the second round are (top) James Rose-Innes, Elia Railton, Hannah Watermeyer, Megan Doyle, Sicelokuhle (SO) Sishuba (bottom) Sabrina Potgieter, Lungile Netnou, Laetitia Theron, Ezra Mangunda and Peter Watermeyer.\n\nThe teams were very evenly matched throughout the game with possession changing constantly and neither team getting a chance to dominate. The match was looking to end in a goalless draw, when Westering managed to slot home a lovely goal in the dying minutes of the game, giving them a 1 – 0 win.\n\nThe 1st Juniors’ match that followed, started off with an aggressive attack by Union which had Westering on the back foot for the first few minutes of the game. Westering, however, slowly regained their equilibrium and the match became a ding-dong battle for possession, with both teams showing some fine teamwork and also some lovely individual displays of skill.\n\nWestering was first to score, which galvanized the Union team into action and they soon equalized through a joint effort between Aaminah Steele (who capitalized on a loose ball in the circle) and Leshay Fourie (who finished it off).\n\nThroughout the rest of the game, Westering pieced together many attacks and managed to score three brilliant goals, while Union responded with another joint effort between Xarah Hoffman (who drove the ball into the circle) and Chloe Erasmus (who added the finishing touch).\n\nUnion had more than a few opportunities that they didn’t utilise and the team will need to concentrate hard on the basics in the weeks to come. Mention must definitely be made of Sadé May, who worked like a Trojan throughout the match and made many game-changing tackles and passes.\n\nSethu Vena – in the goal-box – was also instrumental in making sure the score-line was restricted. Without her composure while under attack, the outcome would most certainly have been very different.\n\nA word of thanks is also extended to Kyle-Luke du Preez who has been offering valuable assistance with the coaching and umpiring of these two teams.\n\nUnion’s u/14As lost 10 – 33, the u/15As (in the accompanying photos) won 24 – 19, the u/16As lost 22-24 and the second team won 19 – 7. The third team, who played against Murraysburg High School, won 15 – 12.\n\nAfter all these matches were finalised, spectators were treated to an epic clash between the two schools’ 1st XVs. The match lived up to all expectations and had everyone on the edge of their seats for a thrilling 70 minutes.\n\nBurgersdorp was first to cross the line with a well-played move from a set piece. Union bounced back and continued to build pressure, holding onto possession and putting together some wonderful phases until they could take advantage of a well-set lineout. This saw Brett Amsterdam cross the line which he then also converted to put the scores level.\n\nUnion continued to maintain possession and control territory which led to a well-worked team try scored by Khwezi Simon. Union was, unfortunately, unable to take advantage of this lead and allowed Burgersdorp to score on the brink of half time with the scores standing at 12 – 12 at the break.\n\nIn the second half, Burgersdorp was again first to strike with a try against the run of play. Union managed to stay composed and once again put together phase after phase of attack, unfortunately, a lack of accuracy in the set pieces kept Union from crossing the line. Despite the inaccuracy, the continued pressure allowed for some individual brilliance from Lihle Mxhunyelwa, who touched down under the poles for Brett Amsterdam to convert to level up the scores. This seemed to give Union a boost in confidence and the team once again managed to maintain possession and dominate territory.\n\nUnfortunately, Union was unable to capitalize on the advantages they gave themselves and allowed Burgersdorp to take advantage of their inaccuracy at set pieces which put the Union team under pressure.\n\nIn the end, Union was unable to keep Burgersdorp from crossing the line to clinch the match in the last minute and lost the match 19 – 26.\n\nToday we received these photos from Christo Pietersen accompanied by the comment, “Impressed with the well-behaved boys”.\n\nAs the most effective approach to instilling good manners in a child is by being an example of proper etiquette yourself, we’d like to thank the exceptional parents of the Union schools as well as the members of staff and, in fact, the Union community as a whole for setting the example and for showing our learners the value of proper etiquette.\n\nMost importantly we’d like to thank the learners for being such splendid ambassadors for our school!\n\nCultivating good manners takes time, but the rewards of respectful, well-behaved learners are truly endless."
