        "text": "So the scene was all set – Took some really nice pictures yesterday, enjoyed my sleep, right up to 4:30.\n\nHere it is, the old hotel, creaky with whispers and memories. Outside the quietness of the town spoke loudly. My rest was peacful, but for one problem. Many of the hotel rooms where taken by people from some company in town for training. The only lady of the group I could see had the room next to me, and she seems to be a very, uhm, popular employee…her visitor at 4:30 woke me up with his loud….encouragement of her work performance….\n\nSo up early, but no problem. I felt rested, motivated, switched of……\n\nAnd then, my phone rang for the first time at 07:30, and it seems it did not stop all day, calls, sms, e-mails. Some people making me feel guilty of going away. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind communication from people working with me and residents about matters I can assist with while away – it is part of the job, but thinking things are urgent when they are not, and being down right rude, well it is just not necessary.\n\nSo I went into self doubt. You all know how this goes: “I have so much work to do at home…….Gosh, think of the backlog when I get back…….maybe I should have picked another date…..oh my gosh, there are meetings…….things I need to do at home……..I can’t really afford this you know……I miss people….OKAY, I AM TURNING AROUND.\n\nBut thank you for those who comforted me and encouraged me to continue. It was a strange journey in me, making me not enjoy Niue-Betesda, a village I was looking forward to visit.\n\nBut that having been said, I soldiered on, and here I am, Graaf-Reinett.\n\nThe journey was, gosh jolly, I am running out of adjectives, I’ve used spectacular, glorious, magnificent. What is left? Breath taking? The scenes today was, imagine a space, a vast open space. It draws your gaze, pulls you. It empties you, pulling your thoughts out, your fears, your dreams, you inner conversations – pulling it all out into the empty space around you, never filling it, a space so vast all the thoughts in the country can’t fill it. And once it’s pulled these thoughts out – you see it, confront it, and it gets sucked back into the emptiness inside you. What is the adjective for this?\n\nBurgersdorp to Hofmyer\n\nA short trip on a tar road, and I got onto the gravel road to the little town of Hofmyer (which I have never heard of before planning this trip). The area was a large valley between the Stormberge, different colours all around me. The road was the roughest on this journey yet, but nothing Chucky could not handle. We even got to go through our first pool of water today, as the Devlins ‘Crossing the River played” True, it was not a river, or stream, or a brook, it was a…puddle, but a REALLY big puddle.\n\nEventually I got the Hofmyer, a small town, but well kept, green with friendly people. The funniest thing there was the church, I am not sure if it’s colour spoke of the local congregation’s welcoming of LGBT members – although, if they had any gay members, they would have advised them how ghastly that colour is!\n\nThe town was founded in 1873 under the name Maraisburg, but the name was changed in 1911 to honour Onze Jan Hofmyer, a fighter for the rights of the Afrikaans language and member of parliament.\n\nThere are some excellent examples of small town architecture including an old style Shell garage that has fallen in disrepair. But I could imagine some old mechanic, called Oom Pieter, fixing Chryslers whilst the farmers sit and chat over a coffee. And talking about coffee, there is a stunning coffee shop where I had my first proper coffee of the trip, and bought some Slap Haksteentjies to take home.\n\nHofmyer to Nieu-Betesda\n\nThis is where the true open spaces began, with blue mountains calling me ever forth, reminding me of the soulful sounds of Johannes Kerkorrel singing ‘Al lê die berge so blou….” the age old Afrikaans lament singing for someone far away – distant in space or otherwise. To get there I had to cross over two National roads, the N10 and the N9, making this the 3rd and fourth National roads I’ve crossed over.\n\nThe road into Nieu-Betesda was a winding dramatic climb and fall into a fertile little valley with the very touristy town, quiet as can be…no tourist in sight.\n\nAnd then disastor struck – I found a bookshop! I’ve feared this would happen, but figured I’d be able to resist the banshee call of second hand books, alas I could not, and the budget for buying things was blown, thoroughly thoroughly blown. But no worries, I am sure I can survive on one meal a day.\n\nAs my mood was pretty low at this stage, and the cold wind was not doing anything to lift the spirit, I left this town behind be, and sped towards Graaf-Reinett\n\nGraaf-Reinett\n\nThe fourth oldest town in South Africa, founded in 1786, almost 230 years ago. It is a gem of architecture, with beautiful old homes (I struggled to see modern homes, thank heavens) monuments and stunning churches. Even my accommodation was an old style cottage. The town is a curious mix of Cape-Dutch, British colonial and Victorian styles.\n\nIt is a dryer, friendlier Stellenbosch, as a matter of fact, I prefer this little town nestled in the long bend of a slow river to the obnoxious student town any day.\n\nGraaf-Reinett’s history is as interesting as any frontier town. The outer limited of the Kompanjies influence, hundreds of kilometres, many day’s travel by horse away from the ‘government’ in the Castle in Cape Town. An authority only represented by the local Landdrost (magistrate) and the Dutch-Reformed minister who was a state employee. No wonder this district cultivated a highly independent minded type of pioneer. This was first seen in 1795 when the district declared it’s independence from Cape Town and the Kompanjie. Swellendam followed suite. But in the meantime the Cape was successfully invaded by the British. The Independents tried to get aid from a French ship’s soldiers, but to no avail, and they surrendered to British forces. They again rebelled in 1801, and a Republic was declared, the first in SA, probably the first in Africa. They however had to capitulate to overwhelming forces.\n\nThe independent and republican spirit of the locals endured however, and it is for this reason that the district contributed the largest number of Voortrekkers trekking into the interior to later declare the two republics of the Transvaal and Orange Free State. Many Voortrekker leaders came from here, including Gerrit Maritz, Sarel Cilliers, and Andries Pretorius would later be the president of two different republics, and after whom Pretoria was named.\n\nThe area’s history is also one of bloodshed, with thousands of San killed when they resisted the founding of the town in their land. Many rebels against the British during the Anglo-Boer war also came from the district.\n\nIn more modern times, the great fighter for liberation of his people, Robert Sobukwe, was born here. He is a man whose academic and practical contribution to the ending of Apartheid is largely ignored by the current ANC government. I could not help but think of this in the light of his party, the PAC, being demolished in the elections last week.\n\nSo it was an interesting day. Ending in a town that symbolises Afrikaners own struggle against colonialism, and producing one of the great fighters against apartheid. It was a day of my own, silly internal struggle against my inability to switch off, my eternal guilt about not working instilled in me by my Calvinist upbringing. But one where I was made to realise by friends that where as we serve in this job, we are not owned. We too need to rest, to find ourselves – to be refreshed to continue the daily struggle. And there is no better place to refresh, than the vast emptiness of the Karoo.\n\nTomorrow it is off to the Karoo National Park where I will be camping for two nights. Which brings me to another realisation I had – I know exactly where all my warm clothes are….on my bed…..in Durban.\n\nOops.\n\nM\n\nToday was the day I left my beloved Indian ocean behind, I drove up the mountains, and into the drier interior. It was a day with town names that took be back to another time, Mtatha, that reminded me of Apartheid South Africa, Dordercht, that took me back centuries to the Dutch town of the same name where the dogmatic principles of Calvinism was formalised, a dogma that would have a profound impact on our own country, ending up in Burgersdorp, that played an important role in the history language I speak, the church I grew up in, and the university where I studied.\n\nMtatha\n\nThe old capital of the country that never was, previously known as Umtata. This looks like some tinpot capital, a small town, with high rise buildings appearing for no reason. The one time capital of the Transkei, one of Verwoerd’s dream Bantustans, this town has clearly fallen on hard times after joining a Democratic South Africa.\n\nThe original settlement was founded in the 1870’s when the two tribes in the area asked the British to establish a buffer zone between them to bring peace. This settlement grew untill a British Garison came here in 1882. The town was official proclaimed in 1883. It is a town with strong ties to the liberation with some great hero’s like Walter Sisulu coming from here. Now it just looks like a distant memory to another time…trying to relive it’s past pretend glory.\n\nI wanted to see the St. Johns Cathedral, but there are no sign posts to tourism hotspots in this town, not the the cathedral, nor to the Bunga building, previous seat of government of Transkei and now home to the Nelson Mandela museum. After trying for 30 minutes to find it, I gave up, settling for a Dutch Reformed church, dwarfed by a Life Healthcare hospital, with a few white people inside holding their service.\n\nI left this former capital behind, climbing up a beautiful mountain pass, through the towns of Engcobo and Indwe to Dorderecht. I made a brief stop in the very quiet town of Indwe, to take pictures of three very pretty churches, the first one, a small abandoned stone church that looked strangely out of place in this African town.\n\nDorderecht\n\nThis town is dominated by it’s massive sand stone Durch Reformed church, which is fitting, as the town’s name and founding pays homage to the city with the same name in the Netherlands that played such a big role in the Calvinist faith. It is in this city that a famous synod was held, and the Canons of Dort (Die Dortse Leerstellinge) was agreed apon, formalising the church’s doctrine, especially regarding the teaching of pre-destination. When I studied Theology, a large part of my studies was devoted to understanding the Canon of Dort, and being able to teach this to others.\n\nThe town was founded by a Dutch Reformed minister in 1856, and the church has played a big role in this town ever since.\n\nI will not only remember this town for it’s stunning church, but also as the place I had my first meat pie in months. I have recently worked hard to lose weight, and saying goodbye to pies was one of the things I did. SO I don’t know if it was just from missing it, or if it’s truth, or if it was mere hunger, but this homemade Steak and Onion pie was the best pie ever. Screw diets, pies are indeed the best.\n\nI will also remember the town for it’s statue of a Boer Kryger (warrior) standing in front of the church – mostly because he looks almost exactly like the statue of Jack Daniels we always see….irony much?\n\nI left this town, and decided to leave the tar road, and travel to Burgersdorp via Jamestown on dirt roads. And boy, was this the right decision. As I was driving, my song choice of the day came up – Chuck E’s in Love, an old blues melody, And my own Chucky – my trusty Duster, was indeed in love with the rough dirt road we where travelling on, the roads this car was build for. The scenery travelling through the Stormberge (mountain of Storms) was breathtaking.\n\nJust a few hours ago, I was in a sub-tropical coastal forest, then up green mountains, now I am high above sea level, in brown open space with grass waving in the wind. The road was open (I passed 1 car the whole road), the quality of road not bad, and the sky as blue as can ever be found (cue some corny reference to the DA here…).\n\nThis is why I am doing this…this is the reason behind this trip…this, experiences and views like this. The silence, the wind, the rawness of it all. Leaving gritty city and all its stress behind me, finding myself here, here where everything seems lost.\n\nIt is with this lifted spirit that I entered the town of Burgersdorp\n\nBurgersdorp\n\nOne of the reasons I chose Burgersdorp as a destination, is because of the large role it plays in my indirect history. This town played a very large role in the acceptance of Afrikaans as an official language in the then Cape Colony. It was also home the the Theological school of the Gereformeerde Kerke in Suid-Afrika, one of the traditional Afrikaans churches, and the one I, not only grew up in, but for which I studied Theology, and became a minister for a very short time. This School of Theology then moved to Potchefstroom where it later became the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, today know as the North West University, my Alma Mater.\n\nThe town was also the scene of some heavy fighting during the Anglo-Boer War, and many residents of the district fought on the side of the Republic, even though, as this was part of the colony, they where subjects of her majesty the Queen and thus guilty of High Treason, a crime that carried the death penalty.\n\nSo for a small town, it has a large history, a large role in the play of the Afrikaner people.\n\nAnd there is so much to see here.\n\nFirst there is the Jubilee Hotel that first opened in 1889 at the time of Queen Victoria’s jubilee celebrations. It is my home for the night, at R180 per night in a double room with no bathroom. Cheap cheap.\n\nThen there is the NG Kerk (Durch Reformed Church) opposite the hotel\n\nAnd the historic Gereformeerde Kerk, where my friend Alwyn’s father is the current minister\n\nThere is the Blockhouse. The British build many of these miniature forts all over the country to try and limit the movement of the Boer forces. After the fall of all their mayor towns, the Boers reverted to Guerilla warfare, and dragged the war on for many years. The hit and run tactics of the expert horsemen troubled the British, and they build these forts with wire fences in between to try and control the Boers. This Blockhouse was also meant to defend the town.\n\nAnd then there is the Afrikaans Taalmonument (language monument) much older than the more famous one in Paarl. This monument was erected in 1893. When the war broke out in 1899, Lord Kitchener ordered the momument removed. It was only found again, buried, in 1939 in Clanwilliam. The statue was severely damaged. A replica was build, and the original was eventually put up next to the replica. Next to this monument is also a monument remembering the local residents that where killed during the struggle against Apartheid.\n\nOh, and I almost forgot the fountain erected to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. It is a very Victorian pretty little Cast Iron structure. But one of the inscriptions really baffle me. On this elaborate structure, to celebrate an Empress and Queen, four times, on four sides, the largest inscription appears: Keep the Pavement dry….as if that sums up the reign of the reluctant queen. Actually it is quite a Victorian sentiment – war might come, the empire might be on the brink, mortars might fly, but for the sake of empire and good manner, keep calm and keep the pavement dry!\n\nThen there is the cemetery… An amazing, old, overgrown old thing with so many stories to tell. I took well over a hundred pictures, and can not even begin to think what to say here about them all, about the futility of life and the certainty of death. Of building elaborate monuments to say we where here, and let them then decay, like we ourselves decay, until none remembers why they are there.\n\nBut I will just post two pictures, on a slightlly lighter note, of to gravestones from the late 1800’s. Both with beautifully hand-crafted statues trying to convey a deep message but both just getting it ever so slightly wrong. The first is of the thoroughly bored angel with the broken wings, and the second is, well, I don’ know what it is, a women trying to climb on to a cross, or maybe she fell of it…it is just weird. It is old, and stunning, and historic, and forgotten, and just slightly weird, just like the town it stands in.\n\nWell, tomorrow, It is through the small little town of Hofmeyr, to the infamous hamlet of Nieu-Betesda to see some cement owls, and then to the historic and apparently very attractive town of Graaf-Reinet.\n\nGet ready Karoo, Martin and Chucky have arrived!\n\nMM"
