        "text": "Thanks, for this, Sarah, and for your fine comments on transl(iter)ation, Chauncey. Here’s another poem of Transtromer’s that still retains much power in the English. Below that a link to him reading:\n\n“Schubertiana”\n\nby Tomas Transtromer. (Translation by Kalle Raisanen)\n\nI.\n\nIn the evening-dark of a place outside New York, a look-out point\n\nwhere one glance can encompass eight million people’s homes.\n\nThe giant city over there is a long, ﬂickering snow-drift, a spiral\n\ngalaxy on its side.\n\nInside the galaxy, coﬀee cups are slid over the counter, store-fronts\n\nbeg with passers-by, a crowd of shoes that leave no traces.\n\nThe climbing ﬁre-escapes, the elevator doors gliding shut, behind\n\nlocked doors a constant swell of voices.\n\nSunken bodies half-sleep in the subway cars, the rushing catacombs.\n\nI know, also — statistics aside — that right now Schubert is\n\nbeing played in some room over there and that to someone\n\nthose sounds are more important than all those other things.\n\nII.\n\nThe human brain’s endless expanse crumpled into the size of a\n\nﬁst.\n\nIn April, the swallow returns to its last-year’s-nest under the roof\n\nof that very barn in that very parish.\n\nShe ﬂies from the Transvaal, passes the equator, ﬂies for six weeks\n\nover two continents, steers toward this dissappearing point in\n\nthe land-mass.\n\nAnd the man who captures the signals of a whole life in some\n\nfairly ordinary chords by ﬁve strings\n\nthe man who makes a river run through the eye of a needle\n\nis a fat young man from Vienna, called “Little Mushroom” by his\n\nfriends, who slept with his glasses on\n\nand got punctually behind his writing desk each morning.\n\nAt which the wonderful centipedes of music were set in motion.\n\n1“Schubertiana” Tomas Transtromer. (Trans. ¨ Kalle Rais ¨ anen ¨ )\n\nIII.\n\nThe ﬁve strings play. I walk home through tepid forests with the\n\nground springing under me\n\ncrawl up like an unborn, fall asleep, roll weightless into the future,\n\nsuddenly feel that the plants have thoughts.\n\nIV.\n\nSo much we have to trust, simply to live through our daily day\n\nwithout sinking through the earth!\n\nTrust the snow clinging to the mountain slope over the village.\n\nTrust the promises of silence and smiles of understanding,\n\ntrust that the accident telegram isn’t for us and that the sudden\n\naxe-blow from within won’t come.\n\nTrust the wheel-axles that carry us on the highway in the middle\n\nof the three-hundred-times magniﬁed bee swarm of steel.\n\nBut none of that is really worth our conﬁdence.\n\nThe ﬁve strings say we can trust something else.\n\nTrust what? Something else, and they follow us part of the way\n\nthere.\n\nAs when the lights turn oﬀ in the stair-well and the hand follows\n\n— with conﬁdence — the blind handrail that ﬁnds its way in\n\nthe dark.\n\nV.\n\nWe crowd in front of the piano and play four-handed in F-minor,\n\ntwo coachmen on the same carriage, it looks slightly ridiculous.\n\nOur hands seem to move clanging weights back and forth, as if\n\nwe were touching the counter-weights\n\nin attempt at disturbing the terrible balance of the great scales:\n\njoy and suﬀering weigh exactly the same.\n\nAnnie said, “This music is so heroic,” and it’s true.\n\nBut those who glance enviously at the men of action, those who\n\nsecretely despise themselves for not being murderers\n\nthey don’t recognise themselves here.\n\nAnd those many who buy and sell people and think that everyone\n\ncan be bought, they don’t recognise themselves here.\n\nNot their music. The long melody that remains itself through all\n\nchanges, sometimes glittering and weak, sometimes rough and\n\nstrong, snail-trails and steel wire.\n\nThe insistant humming that follows us right now\n\nup the\n\ndepths."
