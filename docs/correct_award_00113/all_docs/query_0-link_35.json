Lagerkvist visited Paris in 1913 where he studied the Cubism of Picasso. After a trip to Berlin in 1915 and a period spent in Denmark, Lagerkvist returned to Sweden and made his literary debut. Lagerkvist was elected into the Swedish Academy in 1940 and was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 1951."
