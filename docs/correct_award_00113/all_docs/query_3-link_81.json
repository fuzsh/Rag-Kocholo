        "text": "Hello! I hope you are all healthy, safe, and happy. Hopefully, you’ve also been able to enjoy the great spring weather.\n\nI should be back to reviewing three books at a time in the next week or so. In the meantime, I’ve read one more book. It’s a very interesting book, too, but it doesn’t really have much to do with spring…\n\nBarabbas, Pär Lagerkvist\n\n“Once Sahak asked if he really had not seen [Jesus] at some other time as well. Barabbas did not answer at once. Then he said that he had also been present in the courtyard of the palace when the rabbi was condemned, and described all that had happened. He also mentioned the extraordinary light that he had seen surrounding him on that occasion. And when he noticed how happy it made Sahak to hear about this light, he did not bother to mention that it was only because he had been dazzled by the sun, coming straight out into it from the dungeon. Why should he mention it? It was of no interest to the other—it was of no interest to anyone. By not bothering to give an explanation of the miracle, he made Sahak so happy that he wanted to hear all about it over and over again.”\n\nIn the Bible, Jesus died on the cross, but he took someone else’s place to do so. The man who had been saved was named Barabbas.\n\nThis book is the story of his life after his escape from crucifixion. While many other people in Barabbas believe in Jesus, Barabbas himself isn’t so sure. He wants to believe in the man who saved him, but he can never quite do so.\n\nFor some reason this book reminds me of Albert Camus’ The Stranger. I don’t really know why. Maybe it’s the somewhat detached narration style, or maybe it’s just because Barabbas involves a lot of crime and punishment (like The Stranger does). Maybe it’s because both of these books are short, or because both of their authors won the Nobel Prize in Literature (and got commemorative stamps made in their honor).\n\nIn any case, Barabbas is an interesting book to read.\n\nIt’s very good at contrasting Barabbas’s doubt with everyone else’s faith, and making you feel his inner conflict about it. At the same time, it doesn’t seem to go that deeply into his thoughts– nothing really unexpected is revealed. He doubts, and angsts about his doubt, but that’s about it.\n\nEven so, the book’s good for another reason, and that reason is the plot. There are some very cool scenes that mirror other scenes that came before, or that make you see old parts of Barabbas in a new way. This makes the incidents in the book feel connected to each other, even though the book’s story spans multiple years. Each part of the book informs the other parts, if that makes sense.\n\nThis book has a lot of good sections, but for some reason, the overall effect feels diluted. I don’t really know why. Maybe it’s because there is just a little bit too much in between the good parts. Maybe it’s something else.\n\nIn any case, Barabbas is a good book to read. Maybe even a good spring read."
