        "text": "The New Yorker, April 8, 1991 P. 31\n\nComment about Nobel prizewinners in literature who have been forgotten. A book called \"Nobel Lectures: Literature, 1901-1967\" fell into writer's hands recently, and he read it from cover to cover, trying to figure out what he's been doing wrong. \"Nobel Lectures: Literature\" is a very useful book for anyone who has ever thought about winning the Nobel Prize: it includes not only the laureates' lectures but also the official citations commending the laureates, remarks made at the Nobel banquets, and biographical notes; and all this stuff gives you a better idea of what, exactly, the Swedish Academy of Literature is looking for when it chooses a winner. Everybody complains about how many writers of the second rank have won the prize--about how Pearl Buck and Steinbeck won it, while Proust and Nabokov and Auden and Borges were left unlaurelled. The only example writer can hope to benefit from is that of writers who, fairly or unfairly, no longer seem to have any rank at all. Writer profiles Johannes Vilhelm Jensen, Erik Axel Karlfeldt, Carl Friedrich George Spitteler, Paul Johann Ludwig Heyse, Carl Gustaf Verner von Heidenstam and Karl Adolph Gjellerup, as well as Miguel Angel Asturias and Par Lagerkvist. As writer came to the end of the volume, an alarming idea occurred to him: What if the Nobel Prizes in the sciences turn out to be no more infallable than those in literature? Beyond this notion lay still gloomier thoughts about the vanity of human wishes and the frailty of human knowledge, and, wishing to push them away, writer shut the book and went back to work."
