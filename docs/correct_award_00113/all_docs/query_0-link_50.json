The BOOK is in near FINE condition. Mild pushing at the spine tips with some light toning of the page edges and the text block. Mild offsetting to the blank end papers.The pages are clean and free from inscriptions. The WRAPPER is complete and is in near FINE condition. The upper front cover, spine and folds are lightly toned. The red lettering to the spine is faded. The rare wraparound Promotional Band is complete and toned to the spine. The wrapper is protected in a removable Brodart archival protector. The book has been SIGNED by PARS LAGERKVIST to the title page. Par Lagerkvist was a highly influential writer from his twenties into his seventies and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1951 'for the artistic vigour and true independence of mind with which he endeavors in his poetry to find answers to the eternal questions confronting mankind'. The first of Lagerkvist's works to be published in the United States, the novel gives a somewhat fictionalized account of Barabbas, the violent Jewish insurrectionist who, at the behest of the gathered crowd, was freed by Pontius Pilot (then the Prefect of the Roman Province, Judaea) in lieu of the innocent Jesus. Through Barabbas, Lagerkvist explores the fundamental question of good and evil. The book provided the basis for the 1962 Dino De Laurentiis film of the same name starring Anthony Quinn as Barabbas and featuring Arthur Kennedy as Pontius Pilate and Jack Palance as Torvald. Scarce with such attributes. Ashton Rare Books welcomes direct contact. - Barabbas : Signed By The Nobel Laureate Author : With The Scarce Promotional Band",
