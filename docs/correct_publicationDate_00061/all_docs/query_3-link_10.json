The Oxford Learner’s Dictionary defines an infinitive as “the basic form of a verb, such as be or run. In English, an infinitive is used by itself, for example, swim in She can swim (this use is sometimes called the bare infinitive), or with ‘to’ (the to-infinitive) as in She likes to swim”. An infinitive is defined as “a verb form normally identical in English with the first person singular that performs some functions of a noun and at the same time displays some characteristics of a verb, and that is used with to (as in I asked him to go) except with auxiliary and various other verbs (as in No one saw him leave)”, according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.\n\nTypes of Infinitives\n\nInfinitive verbs are divided into two based on how they appear in a sentence. The two types of infinitives are,\n\nBare infinitives\n\nFull infinitives\n\nBare infinitives are verbs that are used in their base form and do not function as a verb. They occur after verbs such as ‘see’, ‘watch’, ‘hear’ and ‘feel’ and also after modal verbs such as ‘need’, ‘can’, ‘should’, ‘must’, ‘may’, ‘might’, ‘would’, ‘could’, and ‘will’. Full infinitives (also called to-infinitives) are verbs that take a ‘to’ before them and do not function as a verb. Both bare infinitives and full infinitives can be employed in the same sentence.\n\nLook at the following example.\n\nI want to see you cook.\n\nYou will see that there are three action words in this sentence – ‘want’, ‘see’ and ‘cook’. Among these, which one do you think is the main verb and the infinitive? Well, ‘want’ is the main verb, ‘to see’ is the full infinitive and ‘cook’ is the bare infinitive.\n\nSome Verbs That Always Take the Bare Infinitive\n\nSome verbs such as ‘make’, ‘do’ and ‘let’ always take the bare infinitive form of the verb. For example,\n\nLet me know if you need some help.\n\nWindy does not like brinjal and bitter gourd.\n\nThe teacher made the students speak about their trip in one minute.\n\nSome Verbs That Always Take the Full Infinitive\n\nThere is a list of verbs in English that are always followed by the ‘to-infinitive’ when they have a verb form following them. Here is the list of 35+ verbs. Check it out.\n\nAgree\n\nNeed\n\nOught\n\nCare\n\nBeg\n\nAppear\n\nChoose\n\nResolve\n\nEnsure\n\nDecide\n\nPlan\n\nWish\n\nWant\n\nAim\n\nMean\n\nLike\n\nLove\n\nHate\n\nDeserve\n\nLearn\n\nProceed\n\nAttempt\n\nClaim\n\nForget\n\nRemember\n\nDemand\n\nLong\n\nPromise\n\nThreaten\n\nHesitate\n\nExpect\n\nHope\n\nPrepare\n\nOffer\n\nSeem\n\nRefuse\n\nTend\n\nFunctions of an Infinitive Verb – Usage and Examples\n\nAn infinitive verb can perform three main roles – the roles of a noun, an adverb and an adjective. Let us learn how this particular form is used in sentences.\n\nInfinitive Verbs as Nouns\n\nWhen infinitive verbs are used as nouns, they answer the question ‘what’. Make sure you use the full infinitive form when the infinitive is employed as a noun in the sentence. A famous example is ‘To err is human; to forgive is divine’. Here are a few more examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nTo reach after sunset felt meaningless, but it was still worth the long trek.\n\nIn the above sentence, ‘to reach’ is the infinitive that takes the place of the subject in the sentence.\n\nExample 2:\n\nAll we wanted was to rest.\n\nIn this sentence, ‘to rest’ is the infinitive that works as the object of the verb ‘was’.\n\nInfinitive Verbs as Adjectives\n\nAdjectives are words that modify nouns. When infinitive verbs modify or add extra information about the noun in a sentence, it is said to be an adjective.\n\nExample 1:\n\nWe are expecting someone to help us.\n\nHere, in this sentence, ‘to help’ is the infinitive that provides more information about the pronoun ‘someone’.\n\nExample 2:\n\nI haven’t bought all the ingredients to bake the cake.\n\nIn the above sentence, ‘to bake’ modifies the noun phrase ‘all the ingredients’.\n\nInfinitive Verbs as Adverbs\n\nAdverbs provide more information about the verb, adverb or adjective in a sentence; so does an infinitive verb that takes the place of an adverb. In this case, they explain why the particular action is being performed. Let us understand how this works with the help of a few examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nI would like to eat some chocolates.\n\nIn this example, ‘to eat’ is the infinitive verb that tells what the subject ‘I’ likes to do.\n\nExample 2:\n\nTheola wanted to dance at the party.\n\n‘To dance’ is the infinitive verb that functions as an adverb in the sentence.\n\nApart from these, bare infinitives are used when suggestions are made in the form of questions using ‘why’.\n\nFor example,\n\nWhy ask if you have already decided?\n\nWhy make a fuss over everything?\n\nHow Do You Use an Infinitive in a Sentence?\n\nInfinitives can be used in sentences in three ways, such as,\n\nContinuous infinitives\n\nSplit infinitives\n\nPassive infinitives\n\nContinuous Infinitives\n\nA continuous infinitive is one where the infinitive is formed using the verb ‘be’ followed by the present participle form of the verb you intend to use.\n\nFor example,\n\nYou must be joking; I don’t think Derrick will want a bicycle.\n\nHe might be participating in the Annual Accapella Competition this year.\n\nSplit Infinitives\n\nA split infinitive has an adverb or adverbial phrase in between the ‘to’ and the base form of the verb in a to-infinitive. This is done, in most cases, to bring emphasis or since it does not make sense when you place the adverb anywhere else.\n\nFor example,\n\nThis will help you to immediately understand how to work on the application.\n\nThe students need to spontaneously and clearly present their ideas in a group discussion.\n\nPassive Infinitives\n\nWhen an infinitive is written in the passive voice, it is referred to as a passive infinitive. Take a look at the following examples to understand how it works.\n\nI have been waiting to be given a chance to showcase my talents.\n\nAll lights and fans have to be turned off when you leave the classroom.\n\nYou can also go through the article on infinitive phrases to learn the difference between an infinitive and an infinitive phrase. Furthermore, try out the exercises in the article ‘Infinitive exercises’ to check your understanding of infinitive verbs.\n\nDifference between Infinitives, Participles and Gerunds\n\nInfinitives\n\nParticiples\n\nGerunds\n\nForm of verbs that acts as an adverb, noun or adjective in a sentence.\n\nForm of verbs used as adjectives and to form the perfect tenses\n\nForm of verbs that are used as nouns.\n\nThe base form of the verb (bare infinitive) or with a ‘to’ before the root verb (full infinitive).\n\nThe base form of the verb with the addition of ‘ing’ (present participle), ‘d’ or ‘ed’ (past participle) to the end of regular verbs. The past participle of irregular verbs is formed with a slight change in their spellings.\n\nThe base form of the verb with the addition of ‘ing’ at the end.\n\nExamples\n\nI was planning to move to the nearest locality next week.\n\nWe have been waiting to see you play.\n\nExamples\n\nThey have learnt all about self-defence techniques.\n\nTeena is going to the airport to pick him up.\n\nExamples\n\nListening to music while working can calm your mind and help you work more efficiently.\n\nShe spends her free time gardening.\n\nCheck Your Understanding of Infinitive Verbs\n\nIdentify if the underlined words are infinitives or prepositional phrases.\n\n1.
