        "text": "Paperback novel from late 70s or early 80s.\n\nCover shows a door shaped portal with an alien (whom I believe had a canine shaped head, but looked and dressed human in appearance.) exiting the portal in place of who they were expecting to exit. [Some error caused this alien to arrive instead of the person they were expecting.]\n\nHumanity has developed instant teleportation system. (Can't remember if it was interstellar, interplanetary, or just on Earth.) It is in regular use, and has been for years.\n\nBut there have been a couple incidents. One I remember from the story, a man stepped out of a portal, stated a code word, and when a response word was not quoted back, said something like: \"I've been intercepted\" or \"you're not getting me\", and set off a bomb and blew himself up and damaged the local portal room. Much to everyone's confusion, because he was who they were expecting, but no one knew why he asked for a code word, or had a bomb in his briefcase.\n\nThe second incident was when the \"alien\" stepped through instead of the man that was expected. When questioned, the alien stated he was just a routine traveler with no idea of portal operations, but knew that he had landed in a lesser technological reality, because Earth had not figured out how to properly stabilize the portal to prevent these types of errors."
