This place is all to do with shapes and numbers which kind of provide a magical effect.\n\nSo what happens if someone barges in to your galaxy and upsets the count?\n\nThis book is a series of short stories, all of them very different. Most of them appear more as vignettes of life rather than having a nice and tidy ending and I like that.\n\nWhat if we saw the typical horror story from the monster's side? Or if we needed to house humans right at the bottom of a deep sea trench, what could that look like?\n\nThere is a lot to take in and most of the stories were very entertaining without being a heavy hard-going read. If you like to read a story and think, \"I've never seen it from that way\" this is a worthwhile addition to your library.\n\nAnd the end-notes reference a John Brunner book, which always a bonus in my, err, book.\n\nWhat if, the Federation wasn't this big happy family and the humans weren't in charge but were only some minor part of some larger alien empire?\n\nI enjoyed this book, it has a lot of politics; if you found the scenes in The Expanse around the earth parliament annoying, this book is not for you.\n\nIt also explains in an entertaining way how tricky being a Galatic Empire is, even (or perhaps because) you have the ships with the Big Guns.\n\nWhat if, the Federation wasn't this big happy family and the humans weren't in charge but were only some minor part of some larger alien empire?\n\nI enjoyed this book, it has a lot of politics; if you found the scenes in The Expanse around the earth parliament annoying, this book is not for you.\n\nIt also explains in an entertaining way how tricky being a Galatic Empire is, even (or perhaps because) you have the ships with the Big Guns.\n\nThis is a very typical John Brunner fragmented writing, some call it postmodernism writing. There are a set of seemingly unrelated short stories with the exception of the (almost) all-powerful Traveler in Black.\n\nWe watch the Traveler visit many strange lands, all the while bringing the world out of chaos. To do this, the Traveler must grant wishes; the twist being the old adage \"be careful what you wish for\".\n\nHow are these lands related and who is the Traveler? Some of these questions are answered, some remain a mystery.\n\nThis is a very typical John Brunner fragmented writing, some call it postmodernism writing.
