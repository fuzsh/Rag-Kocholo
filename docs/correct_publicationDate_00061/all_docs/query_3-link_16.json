        "text": "Infinitives are two-word forms of verbs, such as to run, to research, or to suggest. A split infinitive happens when you insert an adverb in between to and its verb in an infinitive phrase. Consider the following:\n\nto quickly run\n\nto diligently research\n\nto calmly suggest\n\nThe traditional grammatical rule is to avoid this split, putting the adverb after the infinitive:\n\nto run quickly\n\nto research diligently\n\nto suggest calmly\n\nThis way, you know what the action is (run) before you know the manner in which it is happening (quickly).\n\nBut there are always exceptions to the rule. Sometimes a split infinitive works better than an infinitive. The most famous example is:\n\nto boldly go where no man has gone before\n\nIf Star Trek hadn't split the infinitive, and had just used \"to go boldly where no man has gone before,\" it wouldn't be the catchphrase it is today."
