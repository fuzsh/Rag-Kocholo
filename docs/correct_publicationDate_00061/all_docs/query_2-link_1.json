        "text": "May 21, 2019\n\nTesting their newly developed teleportation technology, Dr. Justin Williams and his team discover that their test subjects are being shifted into parallel universes whose difference from the universe of origin increases in proportion to the distance the subject has been sent. Not a bad idea for a novel, but John Brunner fails to develop his theme adequately in this thin volume. Brunner's forte is really more toward the societal aspects of speculative fiction rather than technological extrapolation, yet he depends too much on almost mystical computers and technobabble regarding \"transfinite numbers\" to achieve his effect. The device of subtly different alternate universes could have been exploited in far more interesting ways.\n\nJuly 23, 2023\n\nA few years in the future a private company, backed by the US Department of Defense, have been field-testing the “poster”, a device twice the size of an old telephone booth which teleports things from anywhere to anywhere else. This isn’t exactly the classic “matter-transmitter” though: rather than objects moving from A to B, here space itself is altered, the departure and destination points made “congruent” and, for an instant, the object’s actual location indefinite. And if the difference doesn’t sound important, it sure is because manipulating this effect begins to have disastrous ramifications.\n\nThey begin tentatively enough, posting inanimate objects such as parcels of documents, but the next step is human volunteers. And for a time that seems to be going without a hitch too—until the day a military courier, materialising in the receiving booth inside an embassy somewhere behind the Iron Curtain, steps out, asks a completely incomprehensible question and, getting nothing but baffled looks in return, immediately destroys his portfolio of documents and shoots himself.\n\nOne possibility is that things posted, particularly people, are arriving at their destination changed in some way; so Justin Williams, one of the device’s inventors, has himself posted—and reappears at the receiving end to find himself unchanged, but the world itself altered. What’s going on? Far more than they’d bargained for is what. As the poster-team and their backers try to make sense of what’s happening, further postings just cause the whole situation to unravel further…\n\nIt does me good reading these. Like a bucket of cold water in the face, a dose of no-nonsense, straight-down-the-middle science fiction clears the head wonderfully! There is more to this story—the nature of infinity, of identity too; free will versus determinism—but above all it’s just good clean fun.\n\nSeptember 23, 2022\n\nThe author spends the 154 pages creating a compelling parallel worlds premise, but shuts down the book before giving us a story to go with it. Still, it's 154 pages; it's too short to drag or bore. The best moments in the book are just after something living goes through a \"poster\" - a matter transmitter with the unanticipated side-effect of involuntary reality-swapping. This talky book, with chatty characters perpetually in conference trying to figure out multiverse theory as applied to accidents, does get, in all the chatter, rather deep when it comes to pondering what \"infinite realities\" truly means - and how hard it is to grasp. In this book, computers are ahead of us in figuring it out, and maybe we can't catch up. So maybe shut the whole thing down? But to the \"poster\" inventors - Justin and Cinnamon - it becomes clear that on certain parallel Earths, traveling the dimensions has been figured out, and is being put to good use...as opposed to those realities where people are going insane because of the possibilities...\n\nIf all this suggests a great plot, let me pull back to my original point - that's what's missing. The key moments in the book lead inevitably to more chatter, sometimes trippy fun, sometimes not. The book seems to end promising a best hundred pages that don't show up...in this universe. I find myself recommending Men Like Gods by H. G. Wells - from 1922! - as a parallel worlds novel I can get more excited about, than this one. Still, it's only 154 pages. And I love the title, The Infinitive of Go. The Infinitive of Go...\n\nFebruary 9, 2018\n\nA critically injured astronaut is transferred to the surface via an experimental matter transmitter, only to materialize as an ape from an alternate dimension. An ape who shares the astronaut’s name and background, but who comes from a world where apes evolved intelligence in ‘parallel’ with Homo Sapiens of our world.\n\nTurns out the ape society knows about this potential cross-over effect, but his injuries were severe enough to compel him to risk being stranded. It also turns out that every transmitee *always* arrives in a different universe than he or she left, and a subjectively better one at that. Unfortunately, the ape informs them that 99% of the Homo Sapien cultures turn violently self-destructive in the aftermath of the realization of the cross-over effect and of the existence of an infinite number of alternate realities, with an infinite number of alternate selves for each of us.\n\nBut, there is hope. Transmitting copies of an encyclopedia or other information source results in the reception of a comparable document from another reality, sometimes with more advanced technology and psychological insights, including one which informs them that in universes where the creator of the matter transmitter was among the first to be transmitted (as in this case), 99% of the time civilization does survive.\n\nJune 22, 2022\n\nUff, am citit, sau mai bine zis am răzbit până la capăt, și încă nu pot să-mi dau seama care este principalul vinovat pentru dificultatea mea de a parcurge acest roman.\n\nPoate că eu sunt de vină, eram probabil obosit și nu se legau paginile... dar chiar șapte zile la rând de oboseală? Pentru că de o săptămână am avut nevoie ca să termin cartea aceasta destul de subțirică.\n\nPe autor, pe John Brunner, îl scot de pe lista suspecților, îmi este imposibil să cred că s-a apucat la un moment dat să se bălăcească în confortul mediocrității literare, toate cărțile sale pe care le-am citit până acum fiind ori foarte bune, ori excepționale. Iar ideile și speculațiile prezente în acest roman îi poartă amprenta, îți reamintești imediat câtă forță are acest uriaș autor. Universuri alternative sau posibile, sincronizate sau incongruente, lumi pe cale de consecință, o bucurie de fiecare dată să citești și să te reîntâlnești cu așa o minte admirabilă. Și Brunner nu a îmbrăcat niciodată conținutul remarcabil al operelor sale într-o formă literară ieftină...\n\nAșa că rămân doar doi suspecți, și anume editura și traducătorul. Dintr-un punct de vedere strict tehnic editura nu este doar suspect, ci inculpat dovedit, și aici nu există vreun dubiu, pentru că am în bibliotecă volumul pe post de probă. Editura Militară mi-a oferit de-a lungul vremii lecturi de calitate, publicate într-o formă cel puțin decentă, așa că îmi este greu să înțeleg cum de s-a încumetat să iasă pe piață cu un astfel de rebut.\n\nMare parte din pagini sunt la limita suportabilului, un adevărat test oftalmologic pe care de abia am reușit să-l trec. Hârtie de ziar, imprimată prost și cu mare economie la cerneala tipografică, rânduri întregi blurate, dublate sau cu supratipar ca la mărcile poștale, de vreo câteva ori am fost nevoit să ies afară ca să țin cartea în lumina soarelui, altfel ar fi fost imposibil să-mi dau seama ce Dumnezeu scrie acolo...\n\nDar aceste considerente de ordin tehnic nu afectează calitatea romanului, pentru că de acest lucru se ocupă traducerea, pe care nu știu cum să o definesc, am de ales între “deficitară” și “oribilă”.\n\nSper totuși că editura nu poartă vreo responsabilitate pentru asta, îmi doresc să cred că nimeni de acolo nu a verificat ce a ieșit după procesul de traducere, toată lumea fiind probabil ocupată cu procurarea de hârtie de calitate și de tuș …\n\nNota acordată romanului : 7,4\n\nhttp://www.bucurestifm.ro/2022/06/22/...\n\nAugust 19, 2013\n\nI found it a little difficult to read--not only the mathematical speculation; even the dialogues and descriptive paragraphs struck me as hard to follow, as if nothing were worded the easy way. Still, a great combination of colorful yet well-argued sci-fi. And Cinnamon is the first female scientist character I've seen who sounds disarmingly smart rather than engagingly sexy.\n\nNovember 18, 2009\n\nThis is how speculative fiction is supposed to work. It even made me look up some of the underlying science and math just because I wanted to understand better than was necessary to follow the story. Creativity trigger: check. Compelling drama: check.\n\nJune 12, 2023\n\nFun pulpy old sci-fi dabbling with ideas that must have been massive at the time, though it can be boiled down to a story about how it would feel to wake up in another body, and another place. Still, quite enjoyable and definitely conveys its ideas well though could have done with being longer to really go somewhere with them.\n\nNovember 14, 2017\n\nDNF on page 28.\n\nChapter one: good start, interesting premise, excellent immediacy-of-scene writing.\n\nChapter two: well, that's disappointing. Needlessly detailed back story of a drive to work. At least these chapters are short.\n\nChapter three: now things are just getting stupid. Rich guy intimidates his employee scientists by bringing them to his luxury home, then transforms his dining nook into presentation space (\"Moving to a control-board set in the side of the house, Bulker touched a series of switches. The breakfast-table and its burden of crockery slid silently away to the kitchen, while a roof-panel shut out the sky and a wall in which were set holographic screens rose to meet it on the seaward side.\") yet HAS NOTHING TO PRESENT. Seriously. The convo is basically 'You heard what happened? I'll play you a recording of the event when I get it. Now go figure out what went wrong.'\n\nChapter four: oh hell no. Introducing some other major players, bit o science babble, rampant speculation unworthy of any scientist prior to any evidence gathering. But then. Oh, then.\n\nSide note here. I remember that 1980 (original publication date) was still a pretty damn unenlightened time for American society and I can understand that Brunner was doing his best to be progressive or whatever by having one of the main scientists be *gasp* a woman and by making a point of having a strict demographic quota (one white man, one black man, one white woman, one black woman) for each group of human subject volunteers and that this next bit was probably the author trying to show how hip and shockingly modern he is, but holy crap.\n\nThis is the sum total of how the four volunteers were written about:\n\n\"The white woman out of the four was fortyish and four-square, while the black one was a few years younger and slimmer. Looking at her, Justin felt a pang of crazy insight. Maybe before she was transferred someone should take her to bed and run a kind of Masters & Johnson evaluation, and then repeat the process afterwards. Maybe some significant change would show up.\n\nBut who could one trust to undertake the task - a superstud with a thousand pubic scalps to his credit? The notion faded as rapidly as it had come,... \"\n\nImma nope out of here so hard right now.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJune 26, 2007\n\nThis is one of those books where you just know the author read some sort of paper in a scientific journal and got his panties in a bundle about it. It was a pretty good read, relatively light for all the high-end mathematics talk that got thrown around. I suspect that if I were better at math (i.e. anywhere beyond Pre-Calculus) I'd either be a much bigger fan or I'd be frothing in rage at the stupid. As a know-nothing idjit, I'm quite content to let the sci-fi author have his little conceits and read the fun little story about parallel universes.\n\nThe book is very short (another factor in my belief that this was an \"Oh what a cool idea!\" story) and sadly thin on the ground. A lot of very intriguing plot material is touched upon lightly in the (occasionally endless) conversations the characters engage in, but not really fully explored. I think that it could have stood to be about 50% to 100% longer and it would all have been to the good, as far as readability was concerned. Still, it's a nice little sideline for those of you who are into the harder branches of science fiction and want a little light reading in between thoughtful perusals of \"A Brief History of Time.\"\n\nJanuary 27, 2018\n\nMore of a 2 1/2 star novel. I read a novel last year with similar theme: teleportation device opens up parallel worlds and crazy kooky mayhem happens! This novel was fun and quick romp at just under 160 pages. I wish the novel was a little longer to flesh out the characters but definitely a decent read.\n\nJuly 25, 2012\n\ngreat movie idea, someone else will snatch it up before me i'm suuure. but i'd watch it!\n\nFebruary 11, 2017\n\nThe nice thing about John Brunner's books is that there is a surface story (which is usually enough to sustain the reader) and then a deeper layer or two.\n\nApril 15, 2014\n\nreview of\n\nJohn Brunner's The Infinitive of Go\n\nby tENTATIVELY, a cONVENIENCE - April 15, 2014\n\nI'm not exactly cranking out the reviews so far this yr. That's partially b/c I'm in the midst of very slowly reading William Gaddis's The Recognitions AND Florian Cramer's Anti-Media. As such, I squeeze in the relatively easy reading of Brunner bks in the midst of the Gaddis & the Cramer to give myself a rest - wch is NOT to say that the Brunner bks are inferior!\n\nThe Infinitive of Go revisits Brunner's Meeting at Infinity (1961) (see my review here: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6... ) insofar as it explores parallel universes AND it revisits Brunner's A Web of Everywhere (1974) (see my review here: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... ) insofar as it explores teleportation. As such, it didn't strike me as groundbreaking for Brunner but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThe opening epigraph of Chapter One reads:\n\n\"\n\nto travel faster\n\nthan a speeding bullet\n\nis not much help\n\nif you and it\n\nare heading straight\n\ntowards each other\n\n\" - p 1\n\nHa ha! Technology may solve some problems but, like medical drugs w/ their inevitable side-effects, may just aggravate others.\n\n\"Sometimes, he thought bitterly, Chester reminded him more than anybody of the Moslem warlord who burned the great library of Alexandria, on the grounds that if the manuscripts therein agreed with the Koran they were superfluous, and if they disagreed they were heretical.\" - p 9\n\n& there we have the basis of my argument against religion encapsulated. Just as Christians have proposed the notion of \"One Way\" (ie: their way & no-one else's) so did a Moslem burn the world's greatest body of knowledge. NOW, I detest religion - esp the 2 main perpetually warring gangs: the Moslems & the Christians. However, in the interest of fairness, I quote the following Wikipedia article as a way to show that the Moslems may've gotten a bad rep in relation to the burning of the Alexandrian library that they may not entirely deserve:\n\n\"The famous burning of the Library of Alexandria, including the incalculable loss of ancient works, has become a symbol of the irretrievable loss of public knowledge. Although there is a mythology of \"the burning of the Library at Alexandria\", the library may have suffered several fires or acts of destruction of varying degrees over many years. Ancient and modern sources identify several possible occasions for the partial or complete destruction of the Library of Alexandria.\n\n\"During Caesar's Civil War, Julius Caesar was besieged at Alexandria in 48 BC. Many ancient sources describe Caesar setting fire to his own ships and state that this fire spread to the library, destroying it.\n\n\"[W]hen the enemy endeavored to cut off his communication by sea, he was forced to divert that danger by setting fire to his own ships, which, after burning the docks, thence spread on and destroyed the great library.\n\n—Plutarch, Life of Caesar\n\nBolstering this claim, in the 4th century both the pagan historian Ammianus and the Christian historian Orosius wrote that the Bibliotheca Alexandrina had been destroyed by Caesar's fire. However, Florus and Lucan claim that the flames Caesar set only burned the fleet and some \"houses near the sea\". Years after Caesar's campaign in Alexandria, the Greek geographer Strabo claimed to have worked in the Alexandrian Library.\n\n\"The library seems to have continued in existence to some degree until its contents were largely lost during the taking of the city by the Emperor Aurelian (270–275 AD), who was suppressing a revolt by Queen Zenobia of Palmyra. During the course of the fighting, the areas of the city in which the main library was located were damaged. Some sources claim that the smaller library located at the Serapeum survived, though Ammianus Marcellinus wrote of the library in the Serapeum temple as a thing of the past, destroyed when Caesar sacked Alexandria.\n\n\"Paganism was made illegal by an edict of the Emperor Theodosius I in 391 AD. The temples of Alexandria were closed by Patriarch Theophilus of Alexandria in AD 391. The historian Socrates of Constantinople describes that all pagan temples in Alexandria were destroyed, including the Serapeum. Since the Serapeum housed a part of the Great Library, some scholars believe that the remains of the Library of Alexandria were destroyed at this time. However, it is not known how many, if any, books were contained in it at the time of destruction, and contemporary scholars do not mention the library directly.\n\n\"In 642 AD, Alexandria was captured by the Muslim army of Amr ibn al `Aas. Several later Arabic sources describe the library's destruction by the order of Caliph Omar. Bar-Hebraeus, writing in the 13th century, quotes Omar as saying to Yaḥyā al-Naḥwī: \"If those books are in agreement with the Quran, we have no need of them; and if these are opposed to the Quran, destroy them.\" Later scholars are skeptical of these stories, given the range of time that had passed before they were written down and the political motivations of the various writers.\" - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_...\n\nTangent over (sortof). Much later in the novel, Brunner has the Christians be the ones stomping on knowledge: \"The worst problem came from a handful of Christians who had been invited to join the team; they proved to be fundamentalist to a man, and Landini in their terms was necessarily a tool of Satan. The fact that he admitted to being a non-practicing Catholic aggravated matters . . .\" (pp 110-111)\n\n\"A fifth channel: a fundamentalist preacher was declaring with enormous fervor that Landini must be a devil because the only intelligent beings the Lord ever created were Adam and Eve, and they were white, and their original sin was to engage in relations with their own children in order to propagate the species, and that was why the Lord made some of their children black, and if anything that stood up on its hind legs and talked to you wasn't precisely like Adam and Eve that was a sure sign that creature was accursed and the blessing of the Lord would rest upon anyone who got it, and the Godless servants of Satan who were trying to foist it on an unenlightened public, in the sights of a rifle and had it skinned and mounted and presented it to a church or a museum where the faithful for ever after might inspect the work of the Evil One . . .\" - p 140\n\n\"When he sent his one and only published paper on the poster principle to a carefully-selected journal known for its hospitality to avant-garde ideas and its willingness to reprint lengthy computer analyses of the type known jokingly as \"yet another four-color problem\"—after the classic computer-exhaustive list of solutions to that classic poser in topology—he had been firmly convinced that it would instantly be recognized as a breakthrough. He had dared to hope it might be called a work of genius.\" - p 11\n\nHa ha! Seems like the kind of journal that wd print something by me. I wonder if Brunner had any particular journal in mind as an inspiration?\n\nIn the world that the main character, Justin, starts out in, Chester gets Dept of Defense funding to develop Justin's teleporter (called a \"poster\"). \"What it amounted to was this: he had become a weapon, and against his will.\" (p 12) A typical problem of scientists whose work depends on massive funding that only the military or insidious corporate interests are capable of providing.\n\nBrunner is great at depicting social scenes in wch personality quirks are deftly skecthed:\n\n\"\"You haven't met these people before,\" Levi said, giving Lane a skeletal grin. \"They aren't scientists. They're magicians. They invent terms as and when they need to. What's rho-space? It's where the object goes which is being shifted from transmitter to receptor at the speed of light! I was told that something moving that fast would acquire infinite mass. Yes, they say, so it must. So where's the mass? It manifests as energy. Now just a moment, I say! You're using a lot of energy for the transfer, but it isn't infinite! Of course not, they say. The surplus doesn't even show up as heat. Of course not, they say. Where is it? It's in rho-space, they say. Are you any the wiser? I swear I'm not!\"\" - p 26\n\nNow, I often write these reviews in a way that deliberately avoids plot-spoilers & that deliberately encourages personal tangents. Hence I quote the epigraph at the beginning of Chapter Eleven b/c it reinforces my own reasoning for not taking sleeping pills:\n\n\"\n\ntwo sleeping-pills as always\n\nbringing guaranteed oblivion\n\nin the night of a whirlwind\n\nby day a cold awakening\n\nin a room full of wreckage\n\nwith only the sky for a ceiling\n\n\" - p 72\n\nThis \"guaranteed oblivion\" seems like all too poignantly comparable to the way that most people, in the US at least, seem unaware of just how much their personal liberty has been eroded away post-9/11 - & Brunner's novel seems to anticipate this somewhat:\n\n\"Instead of treating the situation as though it were the result of enemy action, drafting blanket legislation of a type previously seen only during a war—which, Justin had often sourly thought, was largely intended to ensure that as many citizens as possible could legally be entered in Federal computer-files\" - p 72\n\nIt's always interesting for me when SF writers imagine future-tech & then try to describe it in a potentially believable way: \"[\"]The device is conventionally termed a 'poster'. It is not\"—he recalled Cinnamon's annoyance when Lane said people were being scrambled—\"the matter transmitter familiar as a science-fiction prop. There is not direct communication between the dispatching and the receiving ends; the space within them is rendered congruent under the control of advancing computer systems and the location of the object being transferred becomes indefinite, so that it so to say shuttles from one to the other.\" (p 95) What's particularly interesting here is the side-effect of the process being \"under the control of advancing computer systems\" & the way Brunner develops that. BUT, I don't want to give too much away.\n\n\"\"The total dimensionality of the universe is of an order of aleph-four and may well be as high as aleph-five—in other words, much more infinite than infinity. Don't ask me for a quick course in Cantorian transfinities, please![\"]\" - p 127\n\nWell, I looked them up in my own excellent Paradigm Shift Knuckle Sandwich & other examples of P.N.T. (Perverse Number Theory) bk - specifically on page \"356 surreal numbers\" in the \"GLOSSARY: terms\" section & all I found was this measly: \"transfinite numbers = Georg Cantor's term for infinitely large numbers\". That doesn't tell us much now does it? But it DID give me an excuse to reference my unpublished bk that I wrote over 6 yrs ago.\n\nParallel World history is always fun as either an example of wishful thinking or as dystopian warning or whatever: \"This Adolf Hitler of yours: near as I can figure, he corresponds to a pan-Germanic fanatic who acquired a small following during the economic depression but murdered his lover, a guy called Roehm, and spent the rest of his life in a lunatic asylum writing crazy letters to the government about Jewish money-lenders.\" / \"What about Stalin?\" someone demanded. / \"He didn't change his name. As Iosip Dzhugashvili he did more than anyone to bring about reform in Russia!\" / \"The Viet-Nam war!\" came another shout. / \"You mean when the nationalists took over from the French colonial power?\"\" (pp 136-137)\n\nOctober 12, 2021\n\nThis book was a lot of fun. The idea of teleporters gone wrong is well trodden in science fiction, I imagine most SF authors take a stab at it. John Brunner puts his distinctive mark on the trope, giving us a fast paced exploration uniquely his own. Events are set into action on page one, and the characters never get a chance to fully reckon with them before new complications arise, again and again. Sort of like a caper story with brains. Best of all, it weighs in at 154 pages, a lean, quick read.\n\nSome of the criticism leveled against the book is that it is too short. Readers may wish that Brunner had explored the ideas in greater depth. I'm not in this camp. Brunner knew what he wanted to say, and when he finished saying it, he stopped writing. Other authors could learn from his example. The Infinitive of Go isn't so much about teleportation, nor really about alternate universes. It's about what happens to human beings, both individually and collectively, when we learn that we are faced with the availability of literally infinite choice. With every decision we make, we are presented with an infinite range of options, from very good to very bad. In a field of infinite universes, where all choices not only can be made, but are in fact made in one universe or another, how can we know that we've made the right one, here and now? This is all academic in the abstract, but if we were suddenly faced with the idea that all possible choices were to be played out in reality, most people would suffer from crippling indecision, leading inexorably to mass insanity.\n\nOr so John Brunner speculates in his novel. And it's an entertaining speculation, guaranteed to give rise to debate and argument. Which is what good science fiction ought to do. Brunner doesn't insist that you agree with him, he makes his argument quickly and steps out of the way.\n\nAside from that, I was amazed at how much the technological and social background in this novel resembled the reality we live in today. Written in 1980, and taking place 40 or 50 years later, we see routine gay marriage, a recognizable internet, social media, a rudimentary space station, and a political situation very much like our own. The story is packed full of discussion on transfinite set theory. It's intrinsic to the ideas expressed, but runs the risk of bogging the story down. Of the reviews I have read, a few readers thought this wasn't explained well enough. Most readers, (myself included), felt it sailing right over our heads. Still others wrote it off as mere technobabble, the author making up fake math to suit the needs of the plot. Brunner himself, through one of his characters, says at one point, \"If you don't already know about transfinite numbers, I don't have time to explain the basics here. Get yourself a high school textbook or two, or just look it up on a computer terminal.\" Effectively, go look it up on Wikipedia. In 1980. This put a smile on my face.\n\nThis was only the second novel I've read by John Brunner, the first of course being Stand on Zanzibar. I look forward to reading more of him.\n\nFebruary 28, 2021\n\nA short novel about a teleporter that gets you to the right destination but the wrong reality.\n\nTwo scientists try to work out bugs in their new teleporter, which works great for inanimate objects but has a tendency to send humans to the right place in the wrong universe. For the observer, it seems the person who arrives is a little (or a lot) different than the person who embarked. For the traveler, it seems the entire world is little (or a lot) different upon arrival.\n\nLots of set theory is thrown around, particularly stuff about the cardinality of infinite sets (with reference to many worlds theory), so there's lots of aleph-0, aleph-1, aleph-null jargon. But don't worry, the story makes sense without understanding the occasional bursts of math jargon.\n\nAs the story progresses, the problem of what's wrong with the teleporter pales in comparison to the problem of the survival of human civilization, at least the civilization in the particular universe the novel takes place in. A fun little read. Recommended.\n\nJune 5, 2021\n\n1980 isn't prime John Brunner, but The Infinitive of Go shows the strong ideas are still there. It's just that at 154 pages, they don't have room to develop. The lead characters have invented a teleporter, though through some quirk of quantum physics, they soon realize it's more of a dimensional transporter. Psychological and philosophical ramifications are explored, and I could do with more exposition on the topic rather than more opaque conversations about the underlying maths. Still, Brunner creates a strong cast of characters, and I love the epigrammatic chapter openings. But just when it gets intriguing, The Infinitive of Go stops Going. The ending abruptly leaves off on an elliptical thought, and I'm not even sure how to interpret the characters' conclusions. Conclusions for them, vague questions for the reader. The book really needed a third act, or some kind of follow-up.\n\nApril 3, 2018\n\nSorry to say I have to give this book a Bad review. I enjoy John Brunner and feel I'm probably one of the few who still know his name and get excited to see his books on the shelf these days. I liked the idea of this book but I think it is one of his weakest books. The Idea and concept is good but the execution is bad. With th the short chapters and consistent jumping around for such a small 150ish page book I wonder if this was anouther case of 'force of hand.' This story would be better in a movie or a 1 hour short. Because it would be able to expand on his story and show the details I think he was trying to show. As a book it is weak but as an idea and concept it is not bad.\n\nJuly 16, 2018\n\nThis was a really entertaining and interesting short novel from Brunner, one of the greats in the genre. In a way this is similar to his \"Web of Everywhere\" novel, but instead of economic reactions to being able to teleport anywhere, this story invokes a world of infinite universes. They have developed a machine that can \"post\" someone or something to the a recipient module almost instantly. The problem at hand is that the world on the other end is different in subtle ways. The further one is posted, the bigger the change.\n\nIt's a quick, but effective story with good characters and a plot that makes you wonder at the premise of infinite universe theory.\n\nAugust 16, 2023\n\nIf you want excitement, a page-turner, something to get you on the edge of your seat this book is NOT for you. It's about as exciting as watching a snail complete a marathon. However, it is a cerebral story pondering the impoderables. Scientists create a machine ( called a poster), that can transport a person across time and space.\n\nOf course it all goes horribly wrong. A man commits suicide on completing a trip in the poster. Why? They soon discover the machine is transporting across dimensions.\n\nNot a classic.\n\nDecember 5, 2019\n\n6/10\n\nI read this a while back and it hasn't stuck with me all that well. Deserves a re-read, despite a majority of middling reviews, as I struggle with sci-fi books from this era that throw a lot of technobabble at me. It's only 160 pages so where's the harm? Oh year, I've for 2,000 books with 160 pages waiting to be read. Doh!\n\nApril 21, 2020\n\nMatter transporter raises interesting ideas of possible worlds and even transfinite numbers (Cantor). The ideas deserved a more careful writing from this talented SF writer.\n\nDecember 9, 2021\n\nDespite being largely ignored, this is the best novel I've read by Brunner.\n\nJanuary 23, 2023\n\nAn excellent story.\n\nThe epigraphs at the start of each chapter have interesting ties to the chapter.\n\nJune 14, 2023\n\nA 3.5 - would be a 4, but for an ending even less satisfactory than anything Neal Stephenson could dream up.\n\nAugust 26, 2022\n\nMatter transmission seems to be one of John Brunner's favourite subjects, but unlike Larry Niven, Brunner is mainly concerned with the psychological and philosophical implications of the idea. In this story we have a crisis sparked by a wonky device that shifts human subjects sideways in time as well as from place to place. Since it's not possible to match the characteristics of the transmitter to the receiver exactly in every respect, the unfortunate subject skips to a parallel world where the match is accidentally closer. This can be personally disastrous for them, but when an injured astronaut is transmitted down from orbit and arrives as an evolved baboon speaking perfect English, all hell breaks loose. The story requires some thought to follow, usually a good sign with science fiction, and if you're not aware that some infinities are bigger than others, you might want to look up \"transfinite mathematics\" before reading this book. Up there with the best of his 1960s writing.\n\nJune 14, 2013\n\nTesting their newly developed teleportation technology, a scientist and his team discover that their test subjects are being shifted into parallel universes whose difference from the universe of origin increases in proportion to the distance the subject has been sent. Not a bad idea for a novel, but John Brunner fails to develop his theme adequately in this thin volume. Brunner's forte is really more toward the societal aspects of speculative fiction rather than technological extrapolation, yet he depends too much on almost mystical computers and technobabble regarding \"transfinite numbers\" to achieve his effect. The device of subtly different alternate universes could have been exploited in far more interesting ways.\n\nMarch 19, 2012\n\nThis was good, what at first I thought was going to be a simple transporter story, turned into much more. I'd recently watched the PBS show on physics and string theory, so the alternate universe theme was very interesting. The idea of pilgrims, traveling to these universes and how they'd be welcomed and how they'd react, is a great plot line. A much more positive view on mankind in the end, more hopeful that Stand on Zanzibar. Slightly dated in dialog, at points, but Brunner hits the nail on the head with the anti-science ideology of religious and political fundamentalists. my next Brunner book will be, The Sheep look Up."
