When the guy arrives on the other side, his personality seems to have changed: he has full-blown paranoia and wants confirmation of the identity of the people he is talking to, and finally commits suicide rather than giving away the documents.\n\nIt is later understood that the devices are not for teleportation, but rather doors to alternate earths, with alternate histories. You could even put nothing in it, and get something in return."
