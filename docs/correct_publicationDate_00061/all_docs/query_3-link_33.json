        "text": "In Stage 1 we looked at verbs in the present tense.\n\nFor example:\n\nPresent tense\n\nEgo Lucie nuntium do – I give a message to Lucy\n\nWe also looked at verbs in the past tense\n\nFor example:\n\nPast tense (perfect)\n\nEgo Lucie nuntium dedi – I gave a message to Lucy\n\nThis kind of past tense is called a perfect tense. It is used to describe an action in the past which is completed.\n\nTo describe a past action or state which is incomplete, we use an imperfect tense. This tense indicates an action which has gone on over a period time or has happened frequently. It is translated into English by ‘was/were’ + ‘-ing’ or ‘used to’.\n\nFor example:\n\nPast tense (imperfect)\n\nEgo Lucie nuntium dabam – I was giving a message to Lucy\n\nJust as with the present and perfect tenses, we need to know the conjugation a verb belongs to in order to make an imperfect tense.\n\nRemember\n\nLatin verbs are divided into four groups, or conjugations.\n\nIn each conjugation, the verbs share the same endings:\n\nAn example of a first conjugation verb is: confirmo, confirmare, confirmavi, confirmatum (1) – to confirm.\n\nAn example of a second conjugation verb is: habeo, habere, habui, habitum (2) – to have\n\nAn example of a third conjugation verb is: duco, ducere, duxi, ductum (3) – to lead\n\nAn example of a fourth conjugation verb is: audio, audire, audivi, auditum (4) – to hear\n\nThe endings for the imperfect tense are similar to those of the present tense.\n\nPresent tense endings Latin English -o I (first person singular) -s you (second person singular) -t he/she/it (third person singular) -mus we (first person plural) -tis you (second person plural) -nt they (third person plural)\n\nThe difference is that they are preceded by ‘ba-’ and, in the first person singular, the characteristic ‘-o’ of the present changes to ‘-m’ in the imperfect.\n\nFor example:\n\nImperfect tense endings Latin English -bam I -bas you (singular) -bat he/she/it -bamus we -batis you (plural) -bant they\n\nTo form the imperfect tense, remove ‘-re’ from the infinitive form of the verb and add the relevant ending above. However, if the verb is in the fourth conjugation, you will need to add an ‘-e’ before adding the relevant ending.\n\nFor example:\n\nImperfect tense of do, dare, dedi, datum (1) to give\n\nLatin English dabam I was giving, I used to give dabas you were giving, you used to give dabat he/she/it was giving, he/she/it used to give dabamus we were giving, we used to give dabatis you were giving, you used to give dabant they were giving, they used to give\n\nImperfect tense of audio, audire, audivi, auditum (4) to hear\n\nLatin English audiebam I was hearing, I used to hear audiebas you were hearing, you used to hear audiebat he/she/it was hearing, he/she/it used to hear audiebamus we were hearing, we used to hear audiebatis you were hearing, you used to hear audibant they were hearing, they used to hear\n\nHandy hint\n\nTwo irregular verbs you will frequently come across are ‘esse’, ‘to be’, and ‘ire’, ‘to go’. It is well worth learning their imperfect forms.\n\nThe imperfect tense of sum, esse, fui, -, ‘to be’ is formed as follows:\n\nLatin English eram I was eras you were erat he/she/it was eramus we were eratis you were erant they were\n\nThe imperfect tense of eo, ire, ivi, itum ‘to go’ is formed as follows:\n\nLatin English ibam I was going, I used to go ibas you were going, you used to go ibat he/she/it was going, he/she/it used to go ibamus we were going, we used to go ibatis you were going, you used to go ibant they were going, they used to go\n\nChecklist\n\nAre you confident with\n\nthe meaning of an imperfect tense?\n\nthe form of an imperfect tense?\n\nthe meaning of the irregular verbs ‘esse’ and ‘ire’ in the imperfect tense?\n\nthe form of the irregular verbs ‘esse’ and ‘ire’ in the imperfect tense?\n\nWhat next?"
