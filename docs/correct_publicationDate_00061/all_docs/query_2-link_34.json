        "text": "The future perfect continuous, also sometimes called the future perfect progressive, is a verb tense that describes actions that will continue up until a point in the future. The future perfect continuous consists of will + have + been + the verb’s present participle (verb root + -ing).\n\nHere’s a tip: Want to make sure your writing always looks great? Grammarly can save you from misspellings, grammatical and punctuation mistakes, and other writing issues on all your favorite websites.\n\nWhen we describe an action in the future perfect continuous tense, we are projecting ourselves forward in time and looking back at the duration of that activity. The activity will have begun sometime in the past, present, or in the future, and is expected to continue in the future.\n\nIn November, I will have been working at my company for three years.\n\nAt five o’clock, I will have been waiting for thirty minutes.\n\nWhen I turn thirty, I will have been playing piano for twenty-one years.\n\nNonaction Verbs Do Not Use the Future Perfect Continuous\n\nRemember that nonaction verbs like to be, to seem, or to know are not suited to the future perfect continuous tense. Instead, these verbs take the future perfect tense, which is formed with will + have + past participle.\n\nOn Thursday, I will have been knowing you for a week.\n\nOn Thursday, I will have known you for a week.\n\nI will have been reading forty-five books by Christmas.\n\nI will have read forty-five books by Christmas."
