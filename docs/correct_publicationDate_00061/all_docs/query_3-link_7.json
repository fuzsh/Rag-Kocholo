        "text": "With most English verbs (apart from modals), if you want to put another verb after it, you have either put \"to\" in front of the verb or use the gerund (if such a construction is even acceptable). For example:\n\nwant to eat\n\nlike to run / like running\n\nHowever, for a few verbs, this is not necessary:\n\nGo fetch me some water.\n\nCome eat some food.\n\nNow, they don't necessarily have to be used in commands. For example, you could say\n\nHe needs to go fetch me some water.\n\nThey should come eat some food.\n\nBut in any case, those verbs cannot be used in the ordinary present tense:\n\n*He goes fetch me some water.\n\n*They come eat some food.\n\nThe first sentence is jarringly incorrect. The second sentence sounds unusual, albeit not as bad as the first, but it's probably still wrong.\n\nIt seems that these verbs can only be followed by another verb directly if the first verb is used in the infinitive or imperative. Can someone give a good linguistic explanation for why this is the case? Is there a name for this phenomenon? Are there any other examples of such verbs besides \"come\" and \"go\"?"
