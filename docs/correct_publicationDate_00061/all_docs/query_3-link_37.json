        "text": "Definition of the simple past tense\n\nThe simple past tense, sometimes called the preterite, is used to talk about a completed action in a time before now. The simple past is the basic form of past tense in English. The time of the action can be in the recent past or the distant past and action duration is not important.\n\nYou always use the simple past when you say when something happened, so it is associated with certain past time expressions\n\nfrequency: often, sometimes, always\n\nI sometimes walked home at lunchtime.\n\nI often brought my lunch to school.\n\na definite point in time: last week, when I was a child, yesterday, six weeks ago\n\nWe saw a good film last week.\n\nYesterday, I arrived in Geneva.\n\nShe finished her work atseven o'clock\n\nI went to the theatre last night\n\nan indefinite point in time: the other day, ages ago, a long time ago\n\nPeople lived in caves a long time ago.\n\nShe played the piano when she was a child.\n\nNote: the word ago is a useful way of expressing the distance into the past. It is placed after the period of time: a week ago, three years ago, a minute ago.\n\nBe Careful: The simple past in English may look like a tense in your own language, but the meaning may be different.\n\nForming the simple past tense\n\nPatterns of simple past tense for regular verbs\n\nAffirmative Subject + verb + ed I skipped. Negative Subject + did not + infinitive without to They didn't go. Interrogative Did + subject + infinitive without to Did she arrive? Interrogative negative Did not + subject + infinitive without to Didn't you play?\n\nSimple past tense of to be, to have, to do\n\nSubject Verb Be Have Do I was had did You were had did He/She/It was had did We were had did You were had did They were had did\n\nNotes on affirmative, negative, & interrogative forms\n\nAffirmative\n\nThe affirmative of the simple past tense is simple.\n\nI was in Japan last year\n\nShe had a headache yesterday.\n\nWe did our homework last night.\n\nNegative and interrogative\n\nFor the negative and interrogative simple past form of \"to do\" as an ordinary verb, use the auxiliary \"did\", e.g. We didn't do our homework last night.\n\nThe negative of \"have\" in the simple past is usually formed using the auxiliary \"did\", but sometimes by simply adding not or the contraction \"n't\".\n\nThe interrogative form of \"have\" in the simple past normally uses the auxiliary \"did\".\n\nNote: For the negative and interrogative form of all verbs in the simple past, always use the auxiliary 'did''.\n\nSimple past, irregular verbs\n\nSome verbs are irregular in the simple past. Here are the most common ones.\n\nto go\n\nHe went to a club last night.\n\nDid he go to the cinema last night?\n\nHe didn't go to bed early last night.\n\nto give\n\nWe gave her a doll for her birthday.\n\nThey didn't give John their new address.\n\nDid Barry give you my passport?\n\nto come"
