        "text": "Latin grammatical verb inflections\n\nFor verb conjungation from a functional perspective, see Latin verb paradigms.\n\nIn linguistics and grammar, conjugation has two basic meanings.[1] One meaning is the creation of derived forms of a verb from basic forms, or principal parts.\n\nThe second meaning of the word conjugation is a group of verbs which all have the same pattern of inflections. Thus all those Latin verbs which in the present tense have 1st singular -ō, 2nd singular -ās, and infinitive -āre are said to belong to the 1st conjugation, those with 1st singular -eō, 2nd singular -ēs and infinitive -ēre belong to the 2nd conjugation, and so on. The number of conjugations of regular verbs is usually said to be four.\n\nThe word \"conjugation\" comes from the Latin coniugātiō, a calque of the Greek συζυγία (syzygia), literally \"yoking together (horses into a team)\".\n\nFor examples of verbs and verb groups for each inflectional class, see the Wiktionary appendix pages for first conjugation, second conjugation, third conjugation, and fourth conjugation.\n\nThe ancient Romans themselves, beginning with Varro (1st century BC), originally divided their verbs into three conjugations (coniugationes verbis accidunt tres: prima, secunda, tertia \"there are three different conjugations for verbs: the first, second, and third\" (Donatus), 4th century AD), according to whether the ending of the 2nd person singular had an a, an e or an i in it.[2] However, others, such as Sacerdos (3rd century AD), Dositheus (4th century AD) and Priscian[3] (c. 500 AD), recognised four different groups.[4]\n\nIn modern times grammarians[5] generally recognise four conjugations according to the ending of the active infinitive: namely -āre, -ēre, -ere, or -īre, for example: (1) amō, amāre \"to love\", (2) videō, vidēre \"to see\", (3) regō, regere \"to rule\" and capiō, capere \"to capture\", (4) audiō, audīre \"to hear\". (3rd conjugation verbs ending in -iō such as capiō are sometimes known as \"mixed conjugation\" since they use a mixture of 3rd and 4th conjugation endings.)\n\nIn addition to regular verbs, which belong to one or other of the four regular conjugations, there are also a few irregular verbs, which have a different pattern of endings. The most frequent of these is the verb sum, esse \"to be\" together with its prefixed derivatives.\n\nThere also exist deponent Latin verbs, which though active in meaning have endings identical to the passive endings of ordinary verbs. Examples in the different conjugations are: (1) moror, morārī \"to delay\", (2) polliceor, pollicērī \"to promise\", (3) sequor, sequī \"to follow\" and regredior, regredī \"to go back\", (4) mentior, mentīrī \"to lie (tell a lie)\". Some verbs are semi-deponent, using passive forms for the perfect tenses only.\n\nA verb's full paradigm relies on multiple stems. The present indicative active and the present infinitive are both based on the present stem.\n\nIt is not possible to infer the stems for other tenses from the present stem. This means that, although the infinitive active form normally shows the verb conjugation, knowledge of several different forms is necessary to be able to confidently produce the full range of forms for any particular verb.\n\nIn a dictionary, Latin verbs are listed with four \"principal parts\" (or fewer for deponent and defective verbs), which allow the student to deduce the other conjugated forms of the verbs. These are:\n\nthe first person singular of the present indicative active\n\nthe present infinitive active\n\nthe first person singular of the perfect indicative active\n\nthe supine or, in some grammars, the perfect passive participle, which uses the same stem. (Texts that list the perfect passive participle use the future active participle for intransitive verbs.) Some verbs lack this principal part altogether.\n\nThe first conjugation is characterized by the vowel ā and can be recognized by the -āre ending of the present active infinitive form. The infectum tenses conjugate as follows (see also their meaning):\n\nIndicative Subjunctive Present Future Imperfect Present Imperfect Active I love I will love I was loving I may love I might love I\n\nyou sg.\n\nhe, she, it\n\nwe\n\nyou pl.\n\nthey amō\n\namās\n\namat\n\namāmus\n\namātis\n\namant amābō\n\namābis\n\namābit\n\namābimus\n\namābitis\n\namābunt amābam\n\namābās\n\namābat\n\namābāmus\n\namābātis\n\namābant amem\n\namēs\n\namet\n\namēmus\n\namētis\n\nament amārem\n\namārēs\n\namāret\n\namārēmus\n\namārētis\n\namārent Passive I am loved I will be loved I was being loved I may be loved I might be loved I\n\nyou sg.\n\nhe, she, it\n\nwe\n\nyou pl.\n\nthey amor\n\namāris\n\namātur\n\namāmur\n\namāminī\n\namantur amābor\n\namāberis/e*\n\namābitur\n\namābimur\n\namābiminī\n\namābuntur amābar\n\namābāris/e*\n\namābātur\n\namābāmur\n\namābāminī\n\namābantur amer\n\namēris/e*\n\namētur\n\namēmur\n\namēminī\n\namentur amārer\n\namārēris/e*\n\namārētur\n\namārēmur\n\namārēminī\n\namārentur\n\n* The 2nd person singular passive amāberis, amābāris, amēris, amārēris can be shortened to amābere, amābāre, amēre, amārēre. -re was the regular form in early Latin and (except in the present indicative) in Cicero; -ris was preferred later.[6]\n\nIn early Latin (Plautus), the 3rd singular endings -at and -et were pronounced -āt and -ēt with a long vowel.[6]\n\nOther forms:\n\nInfinitive: amāre \"to love\"\n\nPassive infinitive: amārī \"to be loved\" (in early Latin often amārier)[6]\n\nImperative: amā! (pl. amāte!) \"love!\"\n\nFuture imperative: amātō! (pl. amātōte!) \"love! (at a future time)\"\n\nIndirect imperative: amātō! (pl. amantō!) \"let him love!\"\n\nPassive imperative: amāre! (pl. amāminī!) \"be loved!\" (usually only found in deponent verbs)\n\nPassive future imperative: amātor! (pl. amātōminī!) \"be loved! (at a future time)\"\n\nPassive indirect imperative: amātor! (pl. amantor!) \"let him be loved!\"\n\nPresent participle: amāns (pl. amantēs) \"loving\"\n\nFuture participle: amātūrus (pl. amātūrī) \"going to love\"\n\nGerundive: amandus (pl. amandī) \"needing to be loved\"\n\nGerund: amandī \"of loving\", amandō \"by/for loving\", ad amandum \"in order to love\"\n\nThe principal parts usually adhere to one of the following patterns:\n\nThe perfect has the suffix -āvī. The majority of first-conjugation verbs follow this pattern, which is considered to be \"regular\", for example:\n\namō, amāre, amāvī, amātum, \"to love\";\n\nimperō, imperāre, imperāvī, imperātum, \"to order\";\n\nlaudō, laudāre, laudāvī, laudātum, \"to praise\";\n\nnegō, negāre, negāvī, negātum, \"to deny\";\n\nnūntiō, nūntiāre, nūntiāvī, nūntiātum, \"to announce, report\";\n\nōrō, ōrāre, ōrāvī, ōrātum, \"to beg, pray\";\n\nparō, parāre, parāvī, parātum, \"to prepare\";\n\nportō, portāre, portāvī, portātum, \"to carry\";\n\npugnō, pugnāre, pugnāvī, pugnātum, \"to fight\";\n\nputō, putāre, putāvī, putātum, \"to think\";\n\nrogō, rogāre, rogāvī, rogātum, \"to ask\";\n\nservō, servāre, servāvī, servātum, \"to save\";\n\nvocō, vocāre, vocāvī, vocātum, \"to call\";\n\nThe perfect has the suffix -uī, for example:\n\nfricō, fricāre, fricuī, frictum, \"to rub\";\n\nsecō, secāre, secuī, sectum, \"to cut, to divide\";\n\nvetō, vetāre, vetuī, vetitum, \"to forbid, to prohibit\";\n\nThe perfect has the suffix -ī and vowel lengthening in the stem, for example:\n\niuvō, iuvāre, iūvī, iūtum, \"to help, to assist\";\n\nlavō, lavāre, lāvī, lautum, \"to wash, to bathe\";\n\nThe perfect is reduplicated, for example:\n\ndō, dare, dedī, datum, \"to give\"\n\nstō, stāre, stetī, statum, \"to stand\";\n\nThe verb dō \"I give\" is irregular in that except in the 2nd singular dās and imperative dā, the a is short, e.g. dabō \"I will give\".\n\nThe a is also short in the supine statum and its derivatives, but the other parts of stō \"I stand\" are regular.\n\nDeponent verbs in this conjugation all follow the pattern below, which is the passive of the first type above:[7]\n\narbitror, arbitrārī, arbitrātus sum \"to think\"\n\ncōnor, cōnārī, cōnātus sum \"to try\"\n\ncūnctor, cūnctārī, cūnctātus sum \"to hesitate\"\n\nhortor, hortārī, hortātus sum \"to exhort\"\n\nmīror, mīrārī, mīrātus sum \"to be surprised, to be amazed at\"\n\nmoror, morārī, morātus sum \"to delay, stay\"\n\nThe three perfectum tenses of the 1st conjugation go as in the following table:\n\nIndicative Subjunctive Perfect Future perfect Pluperfect Perfect Pluperfect Active I loved I will have loved I had loved I loved I had loved I\n\nyou sg.\n\nhe, she, it\n\nwe\n\nyou pl.\n\nthey amāvī\n\namāvistī\n\namāvit\n\namāvimus\n\namāvistis\n\namāvērunt/-ēre* amāverō\n\namāverīs/is\n\namāverit\n\namāverīmus/-imus\n\namāverītis/-itis\n\namāverint amāveram\n\namāverās\n\namāverat\n\namāverāmus\n\namāverātis\n\namāverant amāverim\n\namāverīs\n\namāverit\n\namāverīmus\n\namāverītis\n\namāverint amā(vi)ssem*\n\namāvissēs\n\namāvisset\n\namāvissēmus\n\namāvissētis\n\namāvissent Passive I was loved I will have been loved I had been loved I was loved I had been loved I\n\nyou sg.\n\nhe, she, it\n\nwe\n\nyou pl.\n\nthey amātus sum\n\namātus es\n\namātus est\n\namātī sumus\n\namātī estis\n\namātī sunt amātus erō\n\namātus eris\n\namātus erit\n\namātī erimus\n\namātī eritis\n\namātī erunt amātus eram\n\namātus erās\n\namātus erat\n\namātī erāmus\n\namātī erātis\n\namātī erant amātus sim\n\namātus sīs\n\namātus sit\n\namātī sīmus\n\namātī sītis\n\namātī sint amātus essem\n\namātus essēs\n\namātus esset\n\namātī essēmus\n\namātī essētis\n\namātī essent\n\nIn poetry (and also sometimes in prose, e.g. Livy), the 3rd person plural of the perfect indicative is often amāvēre instead of amāvērunt. Occasionally the form amāverunt is also found.[8]\n\nIn early Latin, the future perfect indicative had a short i in amāveris, amāverimus, amāveritis, but by the time of Cicero these forms were usually pronounced with a long i, in the same way as in the perfect subjunctive.[9] Virgil has a short i for both tenses; Horace uses both forms for both tenses; Ovid uses both forms for the future perfect, but a long i in the perfect subjunctive.[10]\n\nThe -v- of the perfect active tenses sometimes drops out, especially in the pluperfect subjunctive: amāssem for amāvissem. Forms such as amārat and amāstī are also found.\n\nThe passive tenses also have feminine and neuter forms, e.g. amāta est \"she was loved\", nūntiātum est \"it was announced\".\n\nForms made with fuī instead of sum and forem instead of essem are also found, for example amātus fuī, amātus fuerō, amātus forem and so on, but these are not common in classical Latin. See Latin tenses.\n\nFor other meanings of the perfect and pluperfect subjunctive, see Latin tenses#Jussive subjunctive.\n\nOther forms:\n\nPerfect infinitive active: amāvisse (amāsse) \"to have loved\"\n\nPerfect infinitive passive: amātus esse (amātum esse) \"to have been loved\"\n\nPerfect participle passive: amātus, -a, -um \"loved (by someone)\"\n\nThe second conjugation is characterized by the vowel ē, and can be recognized by the -eō ending of the first person present indicative and the -ēre ending of the present active infinitive form:\n\nIndicative Subjunctive Present Future Imperfect Present Imperfect Active I see I will see I was seeing I may see I might see I\n\nyou sg.\n\nhe, she, it\n\nwe\n\nyou pl.\n\nthey videō\n\nvidēs\n\nvidet\n\nvidēmus\n\nvidētis\n\nvident vidēbō\n\nvidēbis\n\nvidēbit\n\nvidēbimus\n\nvidēbitis\n\nvidēbunt vidēbam\n\nvidēbās\n\nvidēbat\n\nvidēbāmus\n\nvidēbātis\n\nvidēbant videam\n\nvideās\n\nvideat\n\nvideāmus\n\nvideātis\n\nvideant vidērem\n\nvidērēs\n\nvidēret\n\nvidērēmus\n\nvidērētis\n\nvidērent Passive I am seen I will be seen I was being seen I may be seen I might be seen I\n\nyou sg.\n\nhe, she, it\n\nwe\n\nyou pl.\n\nthey videor\n\nvidēris\n\nvidētur\n\nvidēmur\n\nvidēminī\n\nvidentur vidēbor\n\nvidēberis/e\n\nvidēbitur\n\nvidēbimur\n\nvidēbiminī\n\nvidēbuntur vidēbar\n\nvidēbāris/e\n\nvidēbātur\n\nvidēbāmur\n\nvidēbāminī\n\nvidēbantur videar\n\nvideāris/e\n\nvideātur\n\nvideāmur\n\nvideāminī\n\nvideantur vidērer\n\nvidērēris/e\n\nvidērētur\n\nvidērēmur\n\nvidērēminī\n\nvidērentur\n\nThe passive videor also often means \"I seem\".\n\nOther forms:\n\nInfinitive: vidēre \"to see\"\n\nPassive infinitive: vidērī \"to be seen\"\n\nImperative: vidē! (pl. vidēte!) \"see!\"\n\nFuture imperative: vidētō! (pl. vidētōte!) \"see! (at a future time)\"\n\nPassive imperative: vidēre! (pl. vidēminī!) \"be seen!\" (usually only found in deponent verbs)\n\nPresent participle: vidēns (pl. videntēs) \"seeing\"\n\nFuture participle: vīsūrus (pl. vīsūrī) \"going to see\"\n\nGerundive: videndus (pl. videndī) \"needing to be seen\"\n\nGerund: videndī \"of seeing\", videndō \"by /for seeing\", ad videndum \"in order to see\"\n\nThe principal parts usually adhere to one of the following patterns:\n\nThe perfect has the suffix -uī. Verbs which follow this pattern are considered to be \"regular\". Examples:\n\ndēbeō, dēbēre, dēbuī, dēbitum \"to owe, be obliged\"\n\ndoceō, docēre, docuī, doctum \"to teach, to instruct\"\n\niaceō, iacēre, iacuī, iacitum \"to lie (on the ground/bed)\"\n\nmereō, merēre, meruī, meritum \"to deserve\"\n\nmisceō, miscēre, miscuī, mixtum \"to mix\"\n\nmoneō, monēre, monuī, monitum \"to warn, advise\"\n\nnoceō, nocēre, nocuī, nocitum \"to be harmful\"\n\npraebeō, praebēre, praebuī, praebitum \"to provide, show\"\n\nteneō, tenēre, tenuī, tentum \"to hold, to keep\"\n\nterreō, terrēre, terruī, territum \"to frighten, to deter\"\n\ntimeō, timēre, timuī, – \"to fear\"\n\nvaleō, valēre, valuī, (valitum) \"to be strong\"\n\nThe perfect has the suffix –ēvī. Example:\n\ndēleō, dēlēre, dēlēvī, dēlētum \"to destroy\"\n\nfleō, flēre, flēvī, flētum \"to weep\"\n\nIn verbs with perfect in -vī, syncopated (i.e. abbreviated) forms are common, such as dēlēram, dēlēssem, dēlēstī for dēlēveram, dēlēvissem, dēlēvistī.[11]\n\nThe perfect has the suffix –īvī. Example:\n\ncieō, ciēre, cīvī, citum \"to arouse, to stir\"\n\nThe perfect has the suffix -sī (which combines with a preceding c or g to –xī). Examples:\n\nārdeō, ārdēre, ārsī, ārsum \"to burn\"\n\naugeō, augēre, auxī, auctum \"to increase, to enlarge\"\n\nhaereō, haerēre, haesī, haesum \"to stick, to adhere, to get stuck\"\n\niubeō, iubēre, iussī, iussum \"to order\"\n\nmaneō, manēre, mānsī, mānsum \"to remain\"\n\npersuādeō, persuādēre, persuāsī, persuāsum \"to persuade\"\n\nrīdeō, rīdēre, rīsī, rīsum \"to laugh\"\n\nThe perfect is reduplicated with -ī. Examples:\n\nmordeō, mordēre, momordī, morsum \"to bite\"\n\nspondeō, spondēre, spopondī, spōnsum \"to vow, to promise\"\n\nThe perfect has suffix -ī and vowel lengthening in the stem. Examples:\n\ncaveō, cavēre, cāvī, cautum \"to be cautious\"\n\nfaveō, favēre, fāvī, fautum \"to favour\"\n\nfoveō, fovēre, fōvī, fōtum \"to caress, to cherish\"\n\nsedeō, sedēre, sēdī, sessum \"to sit\"\n\nvideō, vidēre, vīdī, vīsum \"to see\"\n\nThe perfect has suffix -ī. Examples:\n\nrespondeō, respondēre, respondī, respōnsum \"to reply\"\n\nstrīdeō, strīdēre, strīdī, – \"to hiss, to creak\" (also strīdō 3rd conj.)\n\nDeponent verbs in this conjugation are few. They mostly go like the passive of terreō, but fateor and confiteor have a perfect participle with ss:[12]\n\nfateor, fatērī, fassus sum \"to confess\"\n\nmereor, merērī, meritus sum \"to deserve\"\n\npolliceor, pollicērī, pollicitus sum \"to promise\"\n\nThe following are semi-deponent, that is, they are deponent only in the three perfect tenses:[13]\n\naudeō, audēre, ausus sum \"to dare\"\n\ngaudeō, gaudēre, gāvīsus sum \"to rejoice, to be glad\"\n\nsoleō, solēre, solitus sum \"to be accustomed\"\n\nThe third conjugation has a variable short stem vowel, which may be e, i, or u in different environments. Verbs of this conjugation end in -ere in the present active infinitive. Deponent verbs have the infinitive -ī.\n\nIndicative Subjunctive Present Future Imperfect Present Imperfect Active I lead I will lead I was leading I may lead I might lead I\n\nyou sg.\n\nhe, she, it\n\nwe\n\nyou pl.\n\nthey dūcō\n\ndūcis\n\ndūcit\n\ndūcimus\n\ndūcitis\n\ndūcunt dūcam\n\ndūcēs\n\ndūcet\n\ndūcēmus\n\ndūcētis\n\ndūcent dūcēbam\n\ndūcēbās\n\ndūcēbat\n\ndūcēbāmus\n\ndūcēbātis\n\ndūcēbant dūcam\n\ndūcās\n\ndūcat\n\ndūcāmus\n\ndūcātis\n\ndūcant dūcerem\n\ndūcerēs\n\ndūceret\n\ndūcerēmus\n\ndūcerētis\n\ndūcerent Passive I am led I will be led I was being led I may be led I might be led I\n\nyou sg.\n\nhe, she, it\n\nwe\n\nyou pl.\n\nthey dūcor\n\ndūceris\n\ndūcitur\n\ndūcimur\n\ndūciminī\n\ndūcuntur dūcar\n\ndūcēris/re\n\ndūcētur\n\ndūcēmur\n\ndūcēminī\n\ndūcentur dūcēbar\n\ndūcēbāris/re\n\ndūcēbātur\n\ndūcēbāmur\n\ndūcēbāminī\n\ndūcēbantur dūcar\n\ndūcāris/re\n\ndūcātur\n\ndūcāmur\n\ndūcāminī\n\ndūcantur dūcerer\n\ndūcerēris/re\n\ndūcerētur\n\ndūcerēmur\n\ndūcerēminī\n\ndūcerentur\n\nThe future tense in the 3rd and 4th conjugation (-am, -ēs, -et etc.) differs from that in the 1st and 2nd conjugation (-bō, -bis, -bit etc.).\n\nOther forms:\n\nInfinitive: dūcere \"to lead\"\n\nPassive infinitive: dūcī \"to be led\" (the 3rd conjugation has no r)\n\nImperative: dūc!

If the present stem has an n infix, as in fundō, relinquō and vincō, the infix disappears in the perfect. In some cases, the long vowel in the perfect is thought to be derived from an earlier reduplicated form, e.g. *e-agī > ēgī, *e-emī > ēmī.[15] Examples:\n\nagō, agere, ēgī, āctum \"to do, to drive\"\n\ncōgō, cōgere, coēgī, coāctum \"to compel, gather together\"\n\nemō, emere, ēmī, ēmptum \"to buy\"\n\nfundō, fundere, fūdī, fūsum \"to pour\"\n\nlegō, legere, lēgī, lēctum \"to collect, to read\"\n\nrelinquō, relinquere, relīquī, relictum \"to leave behind\"\n\nrumpō, rumpere, rūpī, ruptum \"to burst\"\n\nvincō, vincere, vīcī, victum \"to conquer, to defeat\"\n\nThe perfect has suffix -ī only.

Examples:\n\nveniō, venīre, vēnī, ventum \"to come, to arrive\"\n\ninveniō, invenīre, invēnī, inventum \"to find\"\n\nDeponent verbs in the 4th conjugation include the following:[16]\n\nassentior, assentīrī, assēnsus sum \"to assent\"\n\nexperior, experīrī, expertus sum \"to experience, test\"\n\nlargior, largīrī, largītus sum \"to bestow\"\n\nmentior, mentīrī, mentītus sum \"to tell a lie\"\n\nmētior, mētīrī, mēnsus sum \"to measure\"\n\nmōlior, mōlīrī, mōlītus sum \"to exert oneself, set in motion, build\"\n\npotior, potīrī, potītus sum \"to obtain, gain possession of\"\n\nsortior, sortīrī, sortītus sum \"to cast lots\"\n\nThe verb orior, orīrī, ortus sum \"to arise\" is also regarded as 4th conjugation, although some parts, such as the 3rd singular present tense oritur and imperfect subjunctive orerer, have a short vowel like the 3rd conjugation. But its compound adorior \"to rise up, attack\" is entirely 4th conjugation.\n\nIn the perfect tenses, shortened forms without -v- are common, for example, audīstī, audiērunt, audierat, audīsset for audīvistī, audīvērunt, audīverat, audīvisset. Cicero, however, prefers the full forms audīvī, audīvit to audiī, audiit.[11]\n\nThe verb sum, esse, fuī \"to be\" is the most common verb in Latin. It is conjugated as follows:[17]\n\nIndicative Subjunctive Present Future Imperfect Present Imperfect Active I am I will be I was I may be I might be I\n\nyou sg.\n\nhe, she, it\n\nwe\n\nyou pl.\n\nthey sum\n\nes\n\nest\n\nsumus\n\nestis\n\nsunt erō\n\neris\n\nerit\n\nerimus\n\neritis\n\nerunt eram\n\nerās\n\nerat\n\nerāmus\n\nerātis\n\nerant sim\n\nsīs\n\nsit\n\nsīmus\n\nsītis\n\nsint essem\n\nessēs\n\nesset\n\nessēmus\n\nessētis\n\nessent Active I am able I will be able I was able I may be able I might be able I\n\nyou sg.\n\nhe, she, it\n\nwe\n\nyou pl.\n\nthey possum\n\npotes\n\npotest\n\npossumus\n\npotestis\n\npossunt poterō\n\npoteris\n\npoterit\n\npoterimus\n\npoteritis\n\npoterunt poteram\n\npoterās\n\npoterat\n\npoterāmus\n\npoterātis\n\npoterant possim\n\npossīs\n\npossit\n\npossīmus\n\npossītis\n\npossint possem\n\npossēs\n\nposset\n\npossēmus\n\npossētis\n\npossent\n\nIn early Latin (e.g. Plautus), siem, siēs, siēt can be found for the present subjunctive sim, sīs, sit. In poetry the subjunctive fuam, fuās, fuat also sometimes occurs.[18]\n\nAn alternative imperfect subjunctive is sometimes made using forem, forēs, foret etc. See further: Latin tenses#Foret.\n\nOther forms:\n\nInfinitive: esse \"to be\", posse \"to be able\"\n\nPerfect infinitive: fuisse \"to have been\", potuisse \"to have been able\"\n\nFuture infinitive: fore \"to be going to be\" (also futūrus esse)\n\nImperative: es!

The verbs used are:\n\n1st conjugation: laudō, laudāre, laudāvī, laudātum – to praise\n\n2nd conjugation: terreō, terrēre, terruī, territum – to frighten, deter\n\n3rd conjugation: petō, petere, petīvī, petītum – to seek, attack\n\n3rd conjugation (-i stem): capiō, capere, cēpī, captum – to take, capture\n\n4th conjugation: audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītum – to hear, listen (to)\n\nSee also: Participle and Latin syntax § Participles\n\nThere are four participles: present active, perfect passive, future active, and future passive (= the gerundive).\n\nThe present active participle is declined as a 3rd declension adjective. The ablative singular is -e, but the plural follows the i-stem declension with genitive -ium and neuter plural -ia.\n\nThe perfect passive participle is declined like a 1st and 2nd declension adjective.\n\nIn all conjugations, the perfect participle is formed by removing the –um from the supine, and adding a –us (masculine nominative singular).\n\nThe future active participle is declined like a 1st and 2nd declension adjective.\n\nIn all conjugations the -um is removed from the supine, and an -ūrus (masculine nominative singular) is added.\n\nThe future passive participle, more usually called the gerundive, is formed by taking the present stem, adding \"-nd-\", and the usual first and second declension endings. Thus laudare forms laudandus. The usual meaning is \"needing to be praised\", expressing a sense of obligation.\n\nParticiples laudāre terrēre petere capere audīre Present active laudāns, -antis terrēns, -entis petēns, -entis capiēns, -entis audiēns, -entis Perfect passive laudātus, -a, -um territus, -a, -um petītus, -a, -um captus, -a, -um audītus, -a, -um Future active laudātūrus, -a, -um territūrus, -a, -um petītūrus, -a, -um captūrus, -a, -um audītūrus, -a, -um Gerundive laudandus, -a, -um terrendus, -a, -um petendus, -a, -um capiendus, -a, -um audiēndus, -a, -um\n\nSee also: Infinitive and Latin syntax § The infinitive\n\nThere are seven main infinitives. They are in the present active, present passive, perfect active, perfect passive, future active, future passive, and potential active. Further infinitives can be made using the gerundive.\n\nThe present active infinitive is the second principal part (in regular verbs). It plays an important role in the syntactic construction of Accusative and infinitive, for instance.\n\nlaudāre means, \"to praise.\"\n\nThe present passive infinitive is formed by adding a –rī to the present stem. This is only so for the first, second and fourth conjugations. In the third conjugation, the thematical vowel, e, is taken from the present stem, and an –ī is added.\n\nlaudārī translates as \"to be praised.\"\n\nThe perfect active infinitive is formed by adding an –isse onto the perfect stem.\n\nlaudāvisse/laudāsse translates as \"to have praised.\"\n\nThe perfect passive infinitive uses the perfect passive participle along with the auxiliary verb esse. The perfect passive infinitive must agree with what it is describing in number, gender, and case (nominative or accusative).\n\nlaudātus esse means, \"to have been praised.\"\n\nThe future active infinitive uses the future active participle with the auxiliary verb esse.\n\nlaudātūrus esse means, \"to be going to praise.\" The future active infinitive must agree with what it is describing in number, gender, and case (nominative or accusative).\n\nEsse has two future infinitives: futurus esse and fore\n\nThe future passive infinitive uses the supine with the auxiliary verb īrī. Because the first part is a supine, the ending -um does not change for gender or number.\n\nlaudātum īrī is translated as \"to be going to be praised.\" This is normally used in indirect speech. For example: Spērat sē absolūtum īrī.[27] \"He hopes that he will be acquitted.\"\n\nThe potential infinitive uses the future active participle with the auxiliary verb fuisse.\n\nlaudātūrus fuisse is used only in indirect statements to represent a potential imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive of direct speech. It is translated with \"would\" or \"would have\". For example: nōn vidētur mentītūrus fuisse, nisī dēspērāsset (Quintilian)[28] 'it seems unlikely that he would have told a lie, if he had not been desperate'\n\nInfinitives (with masculine endings used for participles) laudāre terrēre petere capere audīre Present active laudāre terrēre petere capere audīre Present passive laudārī terrērī petī capī audīrī Perfect active laudāvisse terruisse petīvisse cēpisse audīvisse Perfect passive laudātus esse territus esse petītus esse captus esse audītus esse Future active laudātūrus esse territūrus esse petītūrus esse captūrus esse audītūrus esse Future passive laudātum īrī territum īrī petītum īrī captum īrī audītum īrī Potential laudātūrus fuisse territūrus fuisse petītūrus fuisse captūrus fuisse audītūrus fuisse\n\nThe future passive infinitive was not very commonly used. The Romans themselves often used an alternate expression, fore ut followed by a subjunctive clause.\n\nSee also: Supine § Latin, and Latin syntax § The supine\n\nThe supine is the fourth principal part of the verb, as given in Latin dictionaries. It resembles a masculine noun of the fourth declension. Supines only occur in the accusative and ablative cases.\n\nThe accusative form ends in a –um, and is used with a verb of motion in order to show purpose. Thus it is only used with verbs like īre \"to go\", venīre \"to come\", etc. The accusative form of a supine can also take an object if needed.\n\nPater līberōs suōs laudātum vēnit. – The father came to praise his children.\n\nThe ablative, which ends in a –ū, is used with the Ablative of Specification.\n\nArma haec facillima laudātū erant. – These arms were the easiest to praise.\n\nSupine laudāre terrēre petere capere audīre Accusative laudātum territum petītum captum audītum Ablative laudātū territū petītū captū audītū\n\nSee also: Gerund and Latin syntax § The gerund\n\nThe gerund is formed similarly to the present active participle. However, the -ns becomes an -ndus, and the preceding ā or ē is shortened. Gerunds are neuter nouns of the second declension, but the nominative case is not present. The gerund is a noun, meaning \"the act of doing (the verb)\", and forms a suppletive paradigm to the infinitive, which cannot be declined. For example, the genitive form laudandī can mean \"of praising\", the dative form laudandō can mean \"for praising\", the accusative form laudandum can mean \"praising\", and the ablative form laudandō can mean \"by praising\", \"in respect to praising\", etc.\n\nGerund laudāre terrēre petere capere audīre Accusative laudandum terrendum petendum capiendum audiendum Genitive laudandī terrendī petendī capiendī audiendī Dative laudandō terrendō petendō capiendō audiendō Ablative\n\nOne common use of the gerund is with the preposition ad to indicate purpose. For example, paratus ad oppugnandum could be translated as \"ready to attack\". However the gerund was avoided when an object was introduced, and a passive construction with the gerundive was preferred. For example, for \"ready to attack the enemy\" the construction paratus ad hostes oppugnandos is preferred over paratus ad hostes oppugnandum.[29]\n\nThe gerundive has a form similar to that of the gerund, but it is a first and second declension adjective, and functions as a future passive participle (see § Participles above). It means \"(which is) to be ...ed\". Often, the gerundive is used with part of the verb esse, to show obligation.\n\nPuer laudandus est \"The boy needs to be praised\"\n\nOratio laudanda est means \"The speech is to be praised\". In such constructions a substantive in dative may be used to identify the agent of the obligation (dativus auctoris), as in Oratio nobis laudanda est meaning \"The speech is to be praised by us\" or \"We must praise the speech\".\n\nGerundive laudāre terrēre petere capere audīre laudandus, -a, -um terrendus, -a, -um petendus, -a, -um capiendus, -a, -um audiendus, -a, -um\n\nAn older form of the 3rd and 4th conjugation gerundive ends in -undum, e.g. (faciundum for faciendum).[6] This ending is also found with the gerundive of eō 'I go': eundum est 'it is necessary to go'.\n\nFor some examples of uses of Latin gerundives, see the Gerundive article.\n\nFurther information: Latin periphrases\n\nFurther information: Latin tenses § Periphrastic tenses\n\nThere are two periphrastic conjugations. One is active, and the other is passive.\n\nThe first periphrastic conjugation uses the future participle. It is combined with the forms of esse. It is translated as \"I am going to praise,\" \"I was going to praise\", etc.\n\nConjugation Translation Pres. ind. laudātūrus sum I am going to praise Imp. ind. laudātūrus eram I was going to praise Fut. ind. laudātūrus erō I shall be going to praise Perf. ind. laudātūrus fuī I have been going to praise Plup. ind. laudātūrus fueram I had been going to praise Fut. perf. ind. laudātūrus fuerō I shall have been going to praise Pres. subj. laudātūrus sim I may be going to praise Imp. subj. laudātūrus essem I should be going to praise Perf. subj. laudātūrus fuerim I may have been going to praise Plup. subj. laudātūrus fuissem I should have been going to praise\n\nThe second periphrastic conjugation uses the gerundive. It is combined with the forms of esse and expresses necessity. It is translated as \"I am needing to be praised\", \"I was needing to be praised\", etc., or as \"I have to (i.e., must) be praised\", \"I had to be praised,\" etc. It may also be translated in English word by word, as in \"You are to be (i.e., must be) praised.\"[30]\n\nConjugation Translation Pres. ind. laudandus sum I am needing to be praised Imp. ind. laudandus eram I was needing to be praised Fut. ind. laudandus erō I will be needing to be praised Perf. ind. laudandus fuī I was needing to be praised Plup. ind. laudandus fueram I had been needing to be praised Fut. perf. ind. laudandus fuerō I will have been needing to be praised Pres. subj. laudandus sim I may be needing to be praised Imp. subj. laudandus essem I should be needing to be praised Perf. subj. laudandus fuerim I may have been needing to be praised Plup. subj. laudandus fuissem I should have been needing to be praised Pres. inf. laudandus esse To be needing to be praised Perf. inf. laudandus fuisse To have been needing to be praised\n\nDeponent verbs are verbs that are passive in form (that is, conjugated as though in the passive voice) but active in meaning. These verbs have only three principal parts, since the perfect of ordinary passives is formed periphrastically with the perfect participle, which is formed on the same stem as the supine. Some examples coming from all conjugations are:\n\n1st conjugation: mīror, mīrārī, mīrātus sum – to admire, wonder\n\n2nd conjugation: polliceor, pollicērī, pollicitus sum – to promise, offer\n\n3rd conjugation: loquor, loquī, locūtus sum – to speak, say\n\n4th conjugation: mentior, mentīrī, mentītus sum – to tell a lie\n\nDeponent verbs use active conjugations for tenses that do not exist in the passive: the gerund, the supine, the present and future participles and the future infinitive. They cannot be used in the passive themselves (except the gerundive), and their analogues with \"active\" form do not in fact exist: one cannot directly translate \"The word is said\" with any form of loquī, and there are no forms like loquō, loquis, loquit, etc.\n\nSemi-deponent verbs form their imperfective aspect tenses in the manner of ordinary active verbs; but their perfect tenses are built periphrastically like deponents and ordinary passives; thus, semi-deponent verbs have a perfect active participle instead of a perfect passive participle. An example:\n\naudeō, audēre, ausus sum – to dare, venture\n\nUnlike the proper passive of active verbs, which is always intransitive, some deponent verbs are transitive, which means that they can take an object. For example:\n\nhostes sequitur. – he follows the enemy.\n\nNote: In the Romance languages, which lack deponent or passive verb forms, the Classical Latin deponent verbs either disappeared (being replaced with non-deponent verbs of a similar meaning) or changed to a non-deponent form. For example, in Spanish and Italian, mīrārī changed to mirar(e) by changing all the verb forms to the previously nonexistent \"active form\", and audeō changed to osar(e) by taking the participle ausus and making an -ar(e) verb out of it (note that au went to o).\n\nDefective verbs are verbs that are conjugated in only some instances.\n\nSome verbs are conjugated only in the perfective aspect's tenses, yet have the imperfective aspect's tenses' meanings. As such, the perfect becomes the present, the pluperfect becomes the imperfect, and the future perfect becomes the future. Therefore, the defective verb ōdī means, \"I hate.\" These defective verbs' principal parts are given in vocabulary with the indicative perfect in the first person and the perfect active infinitive. Some examples are:\n\nōdī, ōdisse (future participle ōsūrus) – to hate\n\nmeminī, meminisse (imperative mementō, mementōte) – to remember\n\ncoepī, coeptum, coepisse – to have begun\n\nA few verbs, the meanings of which usually have to do with speech, appear only in certain occurrences.\n\nCedo (plur. cette), which means \"Hand it over\" is only in the imperative mood, and only is used in the second person.\n\nThe following are conjugated irregularly:\n\nConjugation of aiō Indicative\n\npresent Indicative\n\nimperfect Subjunctive\n\npresent Imperative\n\npresent Singular Plural Singular Plural Singular Plural Singular First person aiō — aiēbam aiēbāmus — — — Second person ais aiēbās aiēbātis aiās ai Third person ait aiunt aiēbat aiēbant aiat aiant —\n\nPresent Active Participle: – aiēns, aientis\n\nConjugation of inquam Present indicative Future\n\nindicative Perfect\n\nindicative Imperfect\n\nindicative Singular Plural Singular Singular Singular First person inquam inquimus — inquiī — Second person inquis inquitis inquiēs inquistī Third person inquit inquiunt inquiet inquit inquiēbat\n\nConjugation of for Present\n\nindicative Future\n\nindicative Perfect\n\nindicative Pluperfect\n\nindicative Present\n\nimperative Singular Plural Singular Singular Singular Singular Plural First person for — fābor fātus sum fātus eram — — Second person — — — — fāre fāminī Third person fātur fantur fābitur — —\n\nPresent Active Participle – fāns, fantis\n\nPresent Active Infinitive – fārī (variant: fārier)\n\nSupine – (acc.) fātum, (abl.) fātū\n\nGerund – (gen.) fandī, (dat. and abl.) fandō, no accusative\n\nGerundive – fandus, –a, –um\n\nThe Romance languages lost many of these verbs, but others (such as ōdī) survived but became regular fully conjugated verbs (in Italian, odiare).\n\nImpersonal verbs are those lacking a person. In English impersonal verbs are usually used with the neuter pronoun \"it\" (as in \"It seems,\" or \"it is raining\"). Latin uses the third person singular. These verbs lack a fourth principal part. A few examples are:\n\npluit, pluere, plūvit/pluit – to rain (it rains)\n\nningit, ningere, ninxit – to snow (it snows)\n\noportet, oportēre, oportuit – to be proper (it is proper, one should/ought to)\n\nlicet, licēre, licuit – to be permitted [to] (it is allowed [to])\n\nThe future active participle is normally formed by removing the –um from the supine, and adding a –ūrus. However, some deviations occur.\n\nPresent\n\nactive\n\ninfinitive Supine Future\n\nactive\n\nparticiple Meaning iuvāre iūtum iuvātūrus going to help lavāre/lavere lavātum (but PPP lautus) lavātūrus going to wash parere partum paritūrus going to produce ruere rutum ruitūrus going to fall secāre sectum secātūrus going to cut fruī frūctum/fruitum fruitūrus going to enjoy nāscī nātum nātūrus/nascitūrus going to be born morī mortuum moritūrus going to die orīrī ortum oritūrus going to rise\n\nSeveral verb forms may occur in alternative forms (in some authors these forms are fairly common, if not more common than the canonical ones):\n\nThe ending –ris in the passive voice may be –re as in:\n\nlaudābāris → laudābāre\n\nThe ending –ērunt in the perfect may be –ēre (primarily in poetry) as in:\n\nlaudāvērunt → laudāvēre\n\nThe ending –ī in the passive infinitive may be –ier as in:\n\nlaudārī → laudārier, dicī → dicier\n\nLike in most Romance languages, syncopated forms and contractions are present in Latin. They may occur in the following instances:\n\nPerfect stems that end in a –v may be contracted when inflected.\n\nlaudāvisse → laudāsse\n\nlaudāvistī → laudāstī\n\nlaudāverant → laudārant\n\nlaudāvisset → laudāsset\n\nThe compounds of nōscere (to learn) and movēre (to move, dislodge) can also be contracted.\n\nnōvistī → nōstī\n\nnōvistis → nōstis\n\ncommōveram → commōram\n\ncommōverās → commōrās\n\nGrammatical conjugation\n\nLatin declension\n\nRomance copula\n\nWilliam Whitaker's Words\n\nBennett, Charles Edwin (1918).
