        "text": "John Kilian Houston Brunner (September 24, 1934 - August 26, 1995) was a British author of science fiction novels and stories.\n\nHe was born at Preston Crowmarsh[?] in Oxfordshire, and went to school at Cheltenham. He wrote his first novel Galactic Storm[?] at 17, under the name of Gill Hunt, but did not write full time until 1958. In the meantime, he served as an officer in the Royal Air Force, 1953 to 1955. He married Marjorie Rosamond Sauer[?] on July 12, 1958.\n\nAt first writing conventional space opera, he began to experiment with the novel form. His 1968 novel Stand on Zanzibar[?] won the 1969 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel, and is now considered a classic of the genre. The Jagged Orbit[?] won the British SF Award[?] in 1971.\n\nBrunner's best-known work is perhaps 1975's The Shockwave Rider, in which he coined the term \"worm\", used to describe malicious software (see virus).\n\nHis pen names include: K. H. Brunner, Gill Hunt, John Loxmith, Trevor Staines and Keith Woodcott.\n\nHis health began to decline in the 1980s, and worsened with the death of his wife in 1986. He remarried, to Li Yi Tan[?], September 27, 1991, then died of a stroke in Glasgow, Scotland, while attending the World Science Fiction Convention[?] there.\n\nBooks\n\n1950s:\n\nGalactic Storm[?] (1951, as Gill Hunt)\n\n(more here)\n\nEcho in the Skull[?] (1959)\n\nThe Brink[?] (1959)\n\nThe Hundredth Millennium[?] (1959)\n\nThe Threshold of Eternity[?] (1959)\n\nThe World Swappers[?] (1959)\n\n1960s:\n\nThe Atlantic Abomination[?] (1960)\n\nSanctuary in the Sky[?] (1960)\n\nThe Skynappers[?] (1960)\n\nSlavers of Space[?] (1960)\n\nMeeting at Infinity[?] (1961)\n\nI Speak for Earth[?] (1961, as Keith Woodcott)\n\nThe Ladder in the Sky[?] (1962, as Keith Woodcott)\n\nSecret Agent of Terra[?] (1962)\n\nThe Super Barbarians[?] (1962)\n\nCastaways' World[?] (1963)\n\nThe Dreaming Earth[?] (1963)\n\nThe Rites of Ohe[?] (1963)\n\nThe Space-Time Juggler[?] (1963)\n\nThe Astronauts Must Not Land[?] (1963)\n\nThe Psionic Menace[?] (1963, as Keith Woodcott)\n\nEndless Shadow[?] (1964)\n\nTo Conquer Chaos[?] (1964)\n\nThe Altar at/on Asconel[?] (1965)\n\nDay of the Star Cities[?] (1965)\n\nEnigma from Tantalus[?] (1965)\n\nThe Long Result[?] (1965)\n\nThe Martian Sphinx[?] (1965, as Keith Woodcott)\n\nThe Repairmen of Cyclops[?] (1965)\n\nThe Squares of the City[?] (1965)\n\nBorn Under Mars[?] (1966)\n\nThe Evil that Men Do[?] (1966)\n\nA Planet of Your Own[?] (1966)\n\nThe Productions of Time[?] (1966)\n\nSquares of the City[?] (1966)\n\nQuicksand[?] (1967)\n\nBedlam Planet[?] (1968)\n\nCatch a Falling[?] (1968)\n\nFather of Lies[?] (1968)\n\nInto the Slave Nebula[?] (1968, revision of Slavers of Space)\n\nStand on Zanzibar[?] (1968)\n\nThe Avengers of Carrig[?] (1969, revision of Secret Agent of Terra)\n\nDouble, Double[?] (1969)\n\nTimescoop[?] (1969)\n\nThe Jagged Orbit[?] (1969)\n\n1970s:\n\nThe Gaudy Shadows[?] (1970)\n\nThe Dramaturges of Yan[?] (1971)\n\nThe Wrong End of Time[?] (1971)\n\nThe Sheep Look Up[?] (1972)\n\nThe Stardroppers (1972)\n\nAge of Miracles[?] (1971, revision of Day of the Star Cities)\n\nMore Things in Heaven[?] (1973, revision of The Astronauts Must Not Land)\n\nThe Stone That Never Came Down[?] (1973)\n\nGive Warning to the World[?] (1973, revision of Echo in the Skull)\n\nPolymath[?] (1974)\n\nTotal Eclipse[?] (1974)\n\nWeb of Everywhere[?] (1974)\n\nThe Shockwave Rider (1975)\n\n1980s:\n\nThe Infinitive of Go[?] (1980)\n\nPlayers at the Game of People[?] (1980)\n\nManshape[?] (1982, revision of Endless Shadow)\n\nWhile There's Hope[?] (1982)\n\nThe Crucible of Time[?] (1983)\n\nThe Great Steamboat Race[?] (1983)\n\nThe Tides of Time[?] (1984)\n\nMore Things in Heaven[?] (1987)\n\nThe Shift Key[?] (1987)\n\nChildren of the Thunder[?] (1988)\n\n1990s:\n\nA Maze of Stars[?] (1991)\n\nMuddle Earth[?] (1993)\n\nCase of Painter's Ear[?] (1998, posthumous)"
