        "text": "An infinitive is the part of a verb which is unaffected by person or number. In English this part of a verb is easily recognised as it is preceded by ‘to’. For example: ‘to call’.\n\nActive infinitives\n\nIn Latin there are three infinitive forms in the active voice.\n\n1. Present active\n\nIn a dictionary, the present active infinitive form of a verb is shown as the second principal part and we have come across it several times already.\n\nvoco, vocare, vocavi, vocatum (1) to call\n\nNormally the ending for first conjugation verbs is ‘-are’, second conjugation verbs ‘–ere’, third conjugation verbs ‘-ere’, and fourth conjugation verbs ‘-ire’.\n\nFor example:\n\nVerb Present active infinitive Latin Latin English clamo, clamare, clamavi, clamatum (1) clamare to claim habeo, habere, habui, habitum (2) habere to have mitto, mittere, misi, missum (3) mittere to send servio, servire, servivi, servitum (4) servire to serve\n\n2. Perfect active\n\nTo form the perfect active infinitive of a verb, add ‘-sse’ to the third principal part of the verb.\n\nFor example:\n\nVerb Perfect active infinitive Latin Latin English clamo, clamare, clamavi, clamatum (1) clamavisse to have claimed habeo, habere, habui, habitum (2) habuisse to have had mitto, mittere, misi, missum (3) misisse to have sent servio, servire, servivi, servitum (4) servivisse to have served\n\nHandy hint\n\nIf there is a ‘-v’ at the end of the stem, there is sometimes an abbreviated form of the infinitive which excludes the ‘-vi’.\n\nFor example:\n\nclamavisse can become clamasse\n\nservivisse can become servisse\n\n3. Future active\n\nTo form the future active infinitive of a verb, use the future participle (formed by removing the ‘-m’ from the supine and adding ‘-rus’) and add ‘esse’.\n\nFor example:\n\nVerb Future active infinitive Latin Latin English clamo, clamare, clamavi, clamatum (1) clamaturus esse to be about to claim habeo, habere, habui, habitum (2) habiturus esse to be about to have mitto, mittere, misi, missum (3) missurus esse to be about to send servio, servire, servivi, servitum (4) serviturus esse to be about to serve\n\nRemember\n\nThe future participle acts like an adjective, agreeing with the subject of the verb, and declines like ‘bonus, -a, -um’.\n\nPassive infinitives\n\nIn Latin there are also three infinitive forms in the passive voice.\n\n1. Present passive\n\nTo form the present passive infinitive of a verb of the first, second or fourth conjugation, remove the ‘-e’ ending from the present infinitive and add ‘-i’.\n\nFor example:\n\nvoco, vocare, vocavi, vocatum (1) to call vocari to be called\n\nTo form the present passive infinitive of a verb of the third conjugation, remove the ‘-ere’ ending from the present infinitive and add ‘-i’.\n\nFor example:\n\ndico, dicere, dixi, dictum (3) to say dici to be said\n\nThus:\n\nVerb Present passive infinitive Latin Latin English clamo, clamare, clamavi, clamatum (1) clamari to be claimed habeo, habere, habui, habitum (2) haberi to be had mitto, mittere, misi, missum (3) mitti to be sent servio, servire, servivi, servitum (4) serviri to be served\n\n2. Perfect passive\n\nTo form the perfect passive infinitive of a verb, remove the ‘-m’ of the supine, add ‘-s’ to get the past participle and then add ‘esse’.\n\nFor example:\n\nVerb Perfect passive infinitive Latin Latin English clamo, clamare, clamavi, clamatum (1) clamatus esse to have been claimed habeo, habere, habui, habitum (2) habitus esse to have been had mitto, mittere, misi, missum (3) missus esse to have been sent servio, servire, servivi, servitum (4) servitus esse to have been served\n\n3. Future passive\n\nTo form the future passive infinitive of a verb, remove the ‘-m’ of the supine and add ‘-s’ to get the past participle and then add ‘fore’.\n\nHandy hint\n\nIf you have studied Classical Latin before, you will notice that instead of the supine + ‘iri’, Medieval Latin uses the past participle + ‘fore’ to form the future passive infinitive.\n\nFor example:\n\nVerb Future passive infinitive Latin Latin English clamo, clamare, clamavi, clamatum (1) clamatus fore to be about to be claimed habeo, habere, habui, habitum (2) habitus fore to be about to be had mitto, mittere, misi, missum (3) missus fore to be about to be sent servio, servire, servivi, servitum (4) servitus fore to be about to be served\n\nRemember\n\nThe past participle acts like an adjective, agreeing with the subject of the verb, and declines like ‘bonus, -a, -um’.\n\nDeponent infinitives\n\nThe infinitives of deponent verbs follow the rules for passive infinitives, as demonstrated above.\n\nAccusative and infinitive clause\n\nIn the medieval documents you come across, you will frequently see the infinitive being used in conjunction with the accusative. This is called an accusative and infinitive clause, or an indirect statement, and is translated in a particular way.\n\nFor example:\n\nCredo Johannem dedisse Matheo terram.\n\nI believe that John has given the land to Matthew. (Literally – I believe John to have given to Matthew the land.)\n\nHandy hint\n\nYou will often be able to spot an accusative and infinitive clause coming up from the type of verb which precedes it.\n\nFor example:\n\nto hear audio, audire, audivi, auditum (4) to say dico, dicere, dixi, dictum (3) to think puto, putare, putavi, putatum (1) to believe credo, credere, credidi, creditum (3) to know scio, scire, scivi, scitum (4)\n\nChecklist\n\nAre you confident with\n\nthe meaning of an active infinitive?\n\nthe form of an active infinitive?\n\nthe meaning of a passive infinitive?\n\nthe form of a passive infinitive?\n\nthe meaning of an accusative and infinitive clause?\n\nthe form of an accusative and infinitive clause?\n\nWhat next?"
