        "text": "The expressions \"it's time\" to express that something should happen now, or \"about time\" or \"high time\", when some action or event is overdue, are followed by a verb in a past tense, either simple or continuous: It's time we left. It's about time we were going. It's high time you got a job. It's time I cleaned my shoes.\n\nNow if you feel that it is already late for something to happen, you can use the expression ‘It’s high time…’ This structure might look unusual, because it uses a past tense form to talk about the present or future.\n\nSource: EnglishGrammar\n\nAlso:\n\nWe have the example - \"It's high time we went\", but you could also say:\n\nIt's time we went, or\n\nIt's about time we went\n\nand you can use a continuous form as well:\n\nIt's time we were going\n\nIt's about time we were going, and\n\nIt's high time we were going\n\nSource: Ask About English (BBC)\n\nAnd a definition from M-W:\n\nDefinition of it's high time informal — used to say it is time to do something that should have been done a long time ago It's high time we made some changes around here.It's high time (that) you cleaned your room.\n\nSource: Merriam-Webster\n\nI did find this instance from an apparently competent writer in 1835...\n\nCome, Miss Frivolity, it is high time we go, we have stood long enough...\n\n...but even though that \"bare infinitive\" go might have been acceptable (to at least some native Anglophones) a couple of centuries ago, it certainly wouldn't be acceptable today. Nowadays we'd all \"backshift\" the verb tense to...\n\nCome, Miss Frivolity, it is high time we went, we have stood long enough...\n\nHere's a chart showing relative prevalence of the two forms...\n\nNote that optional high in OP's high time context is essentially an \"intensifier\", meaning very much, completely (cf high summer, high noon, highly likely, etc .).\n\nPhrase one is wrong.This is the right construction:\n\nHigh time for (sb) to do sth\n\nHigh time (sb) did sth\n\nSo you can either say :\n\nIt is high time for us to leave,or\n\nIt is high time we left.\n\nBoth are correct. The only difference I can think of is, I would tend to say Phrase 1 to someone in my group, and Phrase 2 to someone who was not in my group."
