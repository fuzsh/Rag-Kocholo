        "text": "It is tempting to characterize 1999 as the windup year to the millennium, and to speculate about what our books say about us as we move into the next century. Of course, the best books published this year merely joined the ranks of literary efforts that attempt to explain the conditions of human existence in any time and place. In this 13th year of compiling our choices, the editors hewed to our perennial criteria: each title must garner the votes of a majority of the Forecasts staff as a work that makes a significant contribution to our society and culture.\n\nAs usual, PW editors were cognizant of the fact that the bestseller lists rarely reflect critics' choices. Only four of the fiction titles and three of our nonfiction choices earned that distinction this year, some quite briefly. All the more reason, then, to bring these books to readers' attentions once again.\n\nIn fiction, the outstanding narratives articulated the eternal search for love and fulfillment, the tragedies imposed by the abuse of power and the blunted lives of fortune's have-nots. Paradoxically, though it was somewhat easier than in past years to immediately select five or six titles that merited inclusion, it was more difficult to discriminate among an unusually large number of beautifully crafted but perhaps less dazzling novels and story collections. Thus the fiction list is somewhat shorter than we have traditionally run.\n\nPerhaps the most notable element of those choices is the range of settings. Communities in the American heartland were no less exotic than the ethnic enclaves of urban New York or Boston. Indians in Massachusetts, a punctiliously polite Japanese man in upstate New York, Hasidim in the boroughs, cow punchers and rodeo riders in Wyoming and two spirited 19th-century women were among the characters who proved memorable. The transcendent art of Jan Vermeer inspired two writers, and the Civil War, WWII and Vietnam provoked others into recording soul-wrenching experiences. The element shared by all these books was their authors' ability to involve the reader in lives that resonate with our own.\n\nIn science fiction, fantasy and horror, novels by familiar names highlighted the season. The horror genre in particular enjoyed a renaissance, as two of its top names returned in great form.\n\nSeveral of this year's best mysteries hail from England, in novels that emphasize psychological suspense. The best American mysteries came from veteran hands working in a variety of genres: police procedural, private eye and cozy.\n\nOur nonfiction selections offer a range of meditations on the most fundamental aspects of human nature and existence, from the defining elements of womanhood to the roots of sexual orientation to the source of violence. One scientist even explores the nature of consciousness itself. Can biology shed light on psychology? Can the roots of human behavior be found in a study of the fruit fly? Is there such a thing as maternal instinct? Is evil a necessary element of life? And, going from the eternal questions to contemplation of the individual life, biography and memoir -- whether of a self-destructive pop icon like Elvis Presley or of a great humanitarian like Eleanor Roosevelt -- remain a rich lode for consideration of the basic questions of our existence.\n\nThis year's lifestyles books showed a weighty emphasis on healthful eating and daily habits. Authors of parenting titles turned their attention to the challenges of rearing boys.\n\nIf there were no p try blockbusters this year, there was a steady supply of excellent work from a variety of hands and houses.\n\nThe attention devoted to J.K. Rowling has ushered in an exciting time in children's books. The children's titles selected this year boast their share of seasoned award-winning authors and illustrators, yet they are sprinkled with a generous number of newcomers. The novels seemed either to gravitate toward fantasy or to take their inspiration from family stories; nonfiction titles leaned heavily toward memoir (a Holocaust rescuer, a true Cinderella story set in WWII China). Readers were the real winners this year.\n\nBest Books were chosen by: Sybil Steinberg, fiction; Jeff Zaleski, mysteries and SF, fantasy and horror; Jeff Zaleski, Paul Gediman, Charlotte Abbott, Jonathan Bing and Sarah Gold, nonfiction; Diane Roback and Jennifer M. Brown, children's; Mark Rotella, lifestyles; Michael Scharf, p try; Jana Riess, religion; and Elizabeth Devereaux, children's religion.\n\nFiction\n\nThe Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing\n\nMelissa Bank (Viking)\n\nA standout among the current crush of titles about single women fixated on their biological clocks and lonely lives, this book of linked short stories is more than a chronicle of how 30-somethings search for romance. Bank's witty, distinctive voice animates her irreverent protagonist's attempts to play the mating game in the career crucible of Manhattan, where the rules prove ineffective against the caprices of fate.\n\nEngland, England\n\nJulian Barnes (Knopf)\n\nIn this brilliantly conceived and cleverly orchestrated fantasy, Barnes keeps one foot on solid English soil while imagining an alternate England on the Isle of Wight, with every cultural artifact reproduced as a theme park. The concept is invented by an unscrupulous promoter and ruled by a woman who lets her head run ahead of her heart. This is a spoof with an edge, a cynical look at consumerism that builds to an emotional denouement.\n\nIndustry of Souls\n\nMartin Booth (St. Martin's)\n\nAlexander Bayliss, a British businessman who was wrongly arrested in the Soviet Union as a spy during the 1950s and consigned to the gulag, is now living quietly in a Russian village, about to celebrate his 80th birthday. This luminous novel flashes back to his horrifying experience as forced labor in the mines, culminating in an act of exquisite compassion, and juxtaposes his resolutely simple life among the peasants to whom he is beloved as a teacher and a friend.\n\nThe Night Inspector\n\nFrederick Busch (Crown/Harmony)\n\nThough never identified by name, Herman Melville is the \"night inspector\" of customs in this provocative historical novel set in New York City just after the Civil War. The narrator, who encounters \"H.M.,\" served as a sniper in the conflict; with his disfigured face covered by a mask, he is an anguished observer in the slums of the city, where society's outcasts pay a stunning price -- in degradation and violence -- for their powerlessness. With the ease of a master, Busch creates a powerful meditation on history, conscience and literary vocation.\n\nA Star Called Henry\n\nRoddy Doyle (Viking)\n\nThe first of a trilogy that aims to tell the history of 20th-century Ireland through the life of one man, this buoyantly imagined, lyrical but realistically detailed narrative has a blistering immediacy. Raised in a slum, Henry Smart must take his opportunities where he can. He becomes a member of the IRA, participates in the 1916 Easter Rising and later trains rebel soldiers, but finds his idealism waning as he realizes that the movement's leaders are motivated by greed for power. Larger than life, Henry's character is refracted through Doyle's bracingly cynical perspective.\n\nHouse of Sand and Fog\n\nAndre Dubus III (Norton)\n\nTwo cultures, and two beleaguered people beset by unlucky circumstance, clash with tragic results in this compassionate story of have-nots whose needs collide. A nearly impoverished former Iranian air force colonel in exile in California buys the home of a woman who was evicted in error. Pride, desperation and a need to save face propel the dignified Iranian into a violent confrontation with the woman and her police officer lover. Dubus's chronicle of the American Dream gone awry is distinguished by his sympathetic delineation of lower“middle-class life.\n\nFor the Relief of Unbearable Urges\n\nNathan Englander (Knopf)\n\nA wise and mature new voice surfaces in this debut collection, the work of a writer who commands a dazzling variety of literary styles and locales. Ranging from New York's Jewish neighborhoods to Israel, Russia and Europe, the stories encapsulate various stages of the Jewish experience in the diaspora. Pathos and hilarity mingle effortlessly as Englander's protagonists seek answers on how to live fully, morally and happily in the modern world -- a combination almost impossible to achieve.\n\nPlainsong\n\nKent Haruf (Knopf)\n\nOrdinary life in America's heartland is the authentically evoked backdrop against which Haruf spins a tale of domestic turmoil, sexual loneliness, unrelenting physical labor, parental love and the healing spirit of community. In a beautifully restrained narrative, he encapsulates both the provinciality and the warmth of rural existence, exemplified in the troubled lives of a high school teacher whose wife leaves him and their two young sons, a teenager who faces pregnancy without money or shelter and the two crusty old bachelors who rescue her. For characters riven by heartache, Haruf illumines the possibility of grace.\n\nThe Colony of Unrequited Dreams\n\nWayne Johnston (Doubleday)\n\nIt takes a gifted writer to cobble together -- triumphantly -- a fictional life of historical figure J Smallwood, a terse and mordant minihistory of Newfoundland, a plot that bursts with Dickensian characters, a secret that will haunt a woman throughout her life, a smiling villain and unrequited love. In his grand and operatic novel, Canadian writer Johnston mixes intrigue, mystery and history against the background of a bitter-cold country fighting for identity and independence.\n\nWaiting\n\nHa Jin (Pantheon)\n\nThe poignant, ironic dilemma of a man caught between Communist China's social policies and the dictates of his own heart illuminates this quiet but resonant novel. One feels sympathy for the three major characters: a military doctor who agrees to an arranged marriage and later falls in love with another woman; his wife, living in a remote village; and the nurse who chastely waits with him during the 18 years (starting in 1966) it takes to get a divorce. In addition to the affecting love story, this eloquent novel presents a trenchant picture of Chinese life under communism.\n\nA Dangerous Friend\n\nWard Just (Houghton Mifflin)\n\nSet in 1965 Vietnam as the U.S. is inching toward full-scale war, Just's powerful morality tale is a scathing chronicle of America's end of innocence. An idealistic, dangerously naÃ¯ve government official gradually realizes that the purported high moral purpose of those who are masterminding U.S. intervention is actually empty and self-serving rhetoric. The protagonist's hubris gradually gives way to horror as he realizes the tragedy to which he has unwittingly contributed.\n\nInterpreter of Maladies\n\nJhumpa Lahiri (Holt/Mariner)\n\nIn nine bittersweet, elegantly crafted stories, Lahiri's Indian characters suffer from the dislocation of life in the alien culture of the U.S. Some, like the self-centered American-born couple in the title story, are unaware of the fragile balance of their unexamined lives; others cannot assuage their existential loneliness in being uprooted from their native environment. Lahiri's compassion for her rudderless characters d s not preclude the stringent use of irony and wit.\n\nA Gesture Life\n\nChang-rae Lee (Riverhead)\n\nBorn in Korea, raised in Japan, settled sedately in America, Franklin \"Doc\" Hata, the protagonist of Lee's quietly stunning novel, is a model citizen of his upstate New York town. But he knows himself to be an outsider everywhere. In meticulously delicate degrees, Lee reveals the WWII psychic wound from which Hata never recovered, and the wounds his emotional reserve inflicted on his adopted daughter. Hardworking and dedicated to his community, striving for conformity and repentance, Hata has instead achieved an achingly empty life, which he finally learns how to redeem.\n\nBone by Bone\n\nPeter Matthiessen (Random)\n\nThe conclusion and capstone of Matthiessen's remarkable trilogy about E.J. Watson, legendary Florida outlaw and entrepreneur, is a triumph of characterization and historical recreation. Murders, ambushes, lynchings, drownings, jailings, a trial and a spectacular hurricane provide the dramatic action. But it is the complex character of Watson himself, a product of a brutally dysfunctional family, the Southern code of honor, Civil War violence and the lawlessness of the frontier, who gives this novel the status of a classic.\n\nThe Last Life\n\nClaire Messud (Harcourt Brace)\n\nThe legacy of France's colonial occupation of Algeria, and the violent revolution that exiled thousands of pieds noirs to the \"home country\" where they felt no sense of identity, haunts the characters in Messud's novel, which centers on the loss of innocence -- a young girl's, a family's, a nation's. From the seemingly secure world of her grandfather's resort hotel on France's Mediterranean coast, the teenage narrator witnesses the gradual destruction of her family's myth of invincibility.\n\nAhab's Wife\n\nSena Jeter Naslund (Morrow)\n\nUsing the events of Melville's Moby-Dick as point of departure, and writing elegant prose that is both appropriate to the era and vividly accessible, Naslund creates a sophisticated and irresistible epic novel -- part history, part adventure, part romance -- that brings the 19th century to life. Settings in Nantucket, Kentucky and aboard a whaling ship encompass many classes of society and range over the intellectual issues of the time, and Naslund's intelligent, spirited heroine, Una, is a character who is destined to endure.\n\nA Prayer for the Dying\n\nStewart O'Nan (Holt)\n\nO'Nan continues to show amazing versatility, constructing a stark and frightening fable in which character and fate intertwine in a situation of moral gravity. The narrator, a psychologically scarred Civil War veteran, is undertaker, constable and minister in a small prairie town suffering from a terrible drought. His feeling of responsibility for all the citizens of Friendship covers a thin veil of despair, and when a biblical combination of plague and fire draws closer, O'Nan's tour de force develops a mesmerizing intensity.\n\nClose Range\n\nAnnie Proulx (Scribner)\n\nThe 11 stories in this volume pack a visceral punch as they chronicle the ironic fates encountered by the denizens of the harsh and treacherous Wyoming plains. Rodeo riders, failed ranchers and farmers, and lonely women are some of the hapless characters facing danger, death and despair who nonetheless summon a spartan determination to go on. Proulx's bleak, deadpan humor is pervasive, arising from the laconic, tart dialogue and her impeccable eye and ear for names, places and poignant secrets.\n\nFortune's Rocks\n\nAnita Shreve (Little, Brown)\n\nHandled with sensitivity, dignity and meticulous attention to period details, a love affair between a teenage girl and a man 26 years her senior, doubly scandalous for its time and place -- 1899 New England -- becomes in Shreve's hands both a compelling narrative and a fascinating chronicle of manners and mores at the turn of the last century. The court battle over custody of the child born of that union brings another level of suspense to the haunting story, which never strays from the path of credibility.\n\nAmy & Isabelle\n\nElizabeth Strout (Random)\n\nA close mother-daughter relationship deteriorates in the wake of adolescent sexual stirrings, a small community's gossip and the revelation of carefully guarded secrets. In a New England mill town, reclusive single mother Isabelle raises her daughter, Amy, strictly but lovingly, until a high school teacher becomes the seducer who will bring them both grief. Beautifully nuanced, the novel explores psychological relationships with subtle acuity.\n\nWho Do You Love\n\nJean Thompson (Harcourt Brace)\n\nWith spare eloquence, Thompson surveys the lives of emotionally dislocated people craving connection, but infuses even the saddest situation with humor and a wry glimmer of hope. The 15 stories in this collection ring with an unpretentious integrity and a knowledge of human complexities.\n\nPersonal Injuries\n\nScott Turow (FSG)\n\nAn ambitious, unscrupulous trial lawyer who ends up fighting for his life is Turow's richest and most compelling character to date. Paradoxically complex -- a charming, clever and devious womanizer and a devoted husband -- Robbie Feaver is forced to cooperate in a sting to trap corrupt judges involved in payoffs. Fascinatingly detailed in the ways of the justice system, the novel also boasts an adroit and inventive plot.\n\nLosing Nelson\n\nBarry Unsworth (Doubleday/Talese)\n\nA contemporary London man gripped in a mad obsession with Britain's greatest naval hero is the protagonist of Unsworth's striking psychological novel. Meticulously recreating each of Admiral Horatio Nelson's battles by deploying models in his basement, amateur biographer Charles Cleasby becomes deranged when he discovers that in 1799, his idol betrayed a group of antimonarchist Naples citizens and sent them to their deaths. Ingeniously blending historical details into the portrait of a disintegrating personality, Unsworth's suspenseful narrative culminates in a shocking denouement.\n\nGirl in Hyacinth Blue\n\nSusan Vreeland (McMurray & Beck)\n\nThe eight interlinked stories of this impressive debut follow the fate of a painting by Vermeer and illuminate the worth and truth of artistic masterpieces against a background of human frailty and historic inexorability. Beginning in the 20th century and gradually moving back to the 17th, when the painting was created, Vreeland's subtle and atmospheric tales acquire a cumulative power, generating dramatic tension and a poignant proof of ars longa, vita brevis.\n\nThe Music Lesson\n\nKatharine Weber (Crown)\n\nAnother book in which a Vermeer painting is integral to the plot, Weber's literary psychological thriller revolves around an IRA plot to steal one of the master painter's works and demand ransom from the British government. The sophisticated but love-duped heroine, an American art historian, is a memorable character, and Weber's civilized prose propels the story with neatly measured strokes.\n\nMysteries\n\nSome Deaths Before Dying\n\nPeter Dickinson (Mysterious)\n\nAt the heart of this superb English country-house mystery is Dickinson's brilliant portrait of widow and photographer Rachel Matson, 90 years old and paralyzed, who uses her vast trove of personal photos and her keen observational skills to understand two crimes. Dickinson's first novel in five years, superbly crafted and highly original, finds this grandmaster of the genre in peak form.\n\nHigh Five\n\nJanet Evanovich (St. Martin's)\n\nThe action never stops, the dialogue snaps and the characters are Kodak sharp in bounty hunter and Jersey girl Stephanie Plum's new adventure. In this happily wacky and over-the-top entry to Evanovich's smart series, the disaster-prone Stephanie and her crew of sidekicks and relatives careen through numerous misadventures.\n\n\"O\" Is for Outlaw\n\nSue Grafton (Holt/Wood)\n\nThe 15th Kinsey Millhone mystery finds the popular California PI digging into her past as she investigates two present-day crimes. The distinctive humor, sharp sense of place and crisp dialogue of the other Millhone novels are here in force, but this outstanding addition to the series offers as well a provocative contemplation of guilt and of decisions made long ago by one of the most popular heroines in mystery fiction.\n\nArms and the Women\n\nReginald Hill (Delacorte)\n\nThe exemplary English series featuring Yorkshire coppers Andy Dalziel and Peter Pasc veers in an entirely unexpected direction as Hill centers his new mystery on Pasc 's wife and surrounds her with a captivating gallery of female characters. This delightfully quirky, literate series entry works in British spies, Colombian drug bandits and Irish arms runners as it delivers a rare and intoxicating blend of danger and hilarity.\n\nThe Big Bad City; The Last Dance\n\nEd McBain (S&S)\n\n1999 brought grateful fans the 49th and 50th novels of the 87th Precinct. In The Big Bad City, Isola detectives Steve Carella and Artie Brown hunt the killer of a nun; in The Last Dance, Carella and Meyer Meyer search for the murderer of an old man. After four decades, McBain still tells ripping good stories alive with the pulse of the city and as fresh as rain.\n\nThe Bird Yard\n\nJulia Wallis Martin (St. Martin's Minotaur)\n\nGrim and intense, Martin's new novel depicts evil slouching through the decaying back alleys and crumbing infrastructure of Manchester, England. The disappearance of a 12-year-old boy, which mirrors the murder of another boy five years before, plunges Detective Superintendent Parker, who's a shrewd and compassionate hero, and criminal psychologist Murray Hanson into a gripping case distinguished by a strong tone of malevolence and firm psychological underpinnings.\n\nFamily Honor\n\nRobert B. Parker\n\n(Putnam)\n\nBest known for his macho Spenser PI books, Parker introduces his first female protagonist. She's Sunny Randall, Boston PI, every bit a woman but every bit as smart and tough as Spenser -- and her first adventure, involving a troubled young woman on the run from a killer, is a bravura performance, sleek and seductive, one of the best in years from the dean of American private eye writers.\n\nThe Breaker\n\nMinette Walters (Putnam)\n\nMystery and psychological suspense meld perfectly in Walters's tantalizing, cleverly plotted new novel. When a woman is found murdered, and a toddler is discovered wandering in Dorset, local constable Nick Ingram gets immersed in a perplexing case whose sinuous plot and enigmatic characters are as captivating as newfound love.\n\nScience Fiction Fantasy/Horror\n\nDarwin's Radio\n\nGreg Bear (Del Rey)\n\nBear plays to his strength -- cutting-edge scientific speculation -- in this riveting SF thriller about possible evolutionary apocalypse. As three scientists discover a catastrophic threat within humanity's genes, Bear, a master of hard SF, explores the nature of evolution and, through well-developed characters, the nature of the species that would control it.\n\nEnder's Shadow\n\nOrson Scott Card (Tor)\n\nIn a stand-alone parallel novel to his classic SF tale Ender's Game, Card follows the tribulations of the superhuman child Bean, who is sent to Battle School to learn to fight the alien, insectoid Buggers. Central to this immensely involving SF novel is Card's multihued portrait of Bean, strange and wonderful, tragic yet hopeful, as he grows toward empathy and true humanity.\n\nStardust\n\nNeil Gaiman (Avon Spike)\n\nThe second novel from a superstar of graphic novels abounds in marvels and moral force. At once a magical fantasy, a charming love story and a fable about attaining one's heart's desire, this narrative about a young man's adventures in rural England and the land of Faerie employs exquisite language, natural wisdom, good humor and a dash of darkness to conjure a fairy tale in the grand tradition.\n\nThe Mammoth Book of Best New Horror, Volume 10\n\nStephen Jones (Carroll & Graf)\n\nThe 10th volume of Jones's always exciting annual anthology offers the series's usual inspired mix of prime fiction from established names (Peter Straub, Dennis Etchison, Harlan Ellison, etc.) and, importantly, relative newcomers (CaitlÃ­n R. Kiernan, Kelly Link, etc.), thus pointing to the future as well as the present of the genre. What give this anthology its particular edge are its definitive annual recap of horror in all media and its invaluable annual necrology.\n\nThe Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\n\nStephen King (Scribner)\n\nKing, who this year also published the tantalizing Hearts in Atlantis, hit a home run with this brief but electrifying horror novel about a young girl lost in the Maine woods. Brutal, intensely suspenseful and aswarm with genuine emotion, the novel weaves backwoods terror, baseball, questions of faith and the travails of a heartbreakingly gutsy heroine into an exhilarating affirmation of the human spirit.\n\nCryptonomicon\n\nNeal Stephenson (Avon)\n\nThough scarcely SF, Stephenson's magnum opus, about code-breaking in the present and during WWII, appealed vigorously to his SF readership. And for good reason: the novel, an ambitious and superbly realized evocation of conspiracies and secret histories, is one of the most extravagant and imaginative literary creations in recent years.\n\nMr. X\n\nPeter Straub (Random)\n\nStraub fashions an ingenious variant on H.P. Lovecraft's classic shocker \"The Dunwich Horror\" in this gripping tale of a man who discovers that he has a malignant doppelgÃ¤nger cutting a swath of supernatural destruction across the country. Evocative prose contributes to the thick atmosphere of apprehension that pervades this novel, both a compelling odyssey of self-discovery and probing study of human nature.\n\nA Deepness in the Sky\n\nVernor Vinge (Tor)\n\nThousands of years in the future, humanity makes contact with an alien race, the Spiders, in Vinge's wholly absorbing prequel to his Hugo-winning space opera, A Fire upon the Deep. This is top-drawer hard SF -- fast-paced, packed with action, intellectually challenging and, above all, capable of invoking SF's grail: a genuine sense of wonder.\n\nNonfiction\n\nWoman: An Intimate Geography\n\nNatalie Angier (Houghton Mifflin)\n\nSpirited and thoroughly informed (if admittedly biased), Angier's wide-ranging celebration of the female body engages the intellect and offers a rigorous challenge to male-oriented theories of biology. Who knew that 8000 nerve fibers gird the clitoris, providing double the sensitivity of the penis? Written with verve and wit, this is one of the year's most exhilarating reads.\n\nAfricana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African-American Experience\n\nAnthony Appiah and Henry Louis Gates Jr. (Basic/Civitas)\n\nHarvard professors Appiah and Gates -- an African and African-American, respectively -- have handily fulfilled W.E.B. Du Bois's vision of a sweeping encyclopedia of the history, literature and arts of the great continent and its diaspora. This exhaustive trove of more than 3000 articles and extended essays by more than 400 scholars is a landmark achievement that Du Bois himself could not have surpassed.\n\nBiological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity\n\nBruce Bagemihl (St. Martin's)\n\nThis brilliant and important book challenges the belief that homosexuality is an aberration in nature by revealing the documented homosexual or transgendered behavior of 450 animal species. Contesting the idea that scarcity and functionality are the primary agents of biological change, biologist Bagemihl persuasively argues that abundance and extravagance are just as crucial to the mosaic of life.\n\nBlack Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War\n\nMark Bowden (Grove Atlantic)\n\nBowden combines a graphic account of combat with a hard, informed look at U.S. military tactics in his gripping account of the October 1993 American raid into the heart of Mogadishu, Somalia. This is military writing at its best.\n\nIf Love Is a Game, These Are the Rules\n\nCherie Carter-Scott (Broadway)\n\nBlessed with a deep and mature understanding of human nature, Carter-Scott encourages readers even as she challenges them to careful self-examination. Her elegant meditation on building and sustaining an intimate partnership is a standout in a bread-and-butter category.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt: Volume 2: 1933“1938\n\nBlanche Wiesen Cook (Viking)\n\nBy explicitly placing Eleanor Roosevelt's political concerns about human rights, the role of women, racial justice and social welfare at the center of her masterful narrative, Cook offers a revealing look at U.S. foreign, domestic and social policy during FDR's first term, and a galvanizing testament to the difference that a woman acting on the courage of her convictions can make.\n\nA Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness\n\nAntonio D'Amasio (Harcourt)\n\nTackling questions that p ts, artists and philosophers have contemplated for generations, neuroscientist D'Amasio draws on years of clinical research to make the profound and original argument that consciousness arises from our ability to map relations between the self and others through our emotions. This bold attempt to mend the classical breach between emotion and reason is all the more compelling for its p tic expression.\n\nTimes Square Red, Times Square Blue\n\nSamuel R. Delany (New York Univ.)\n\nBest known for his science fiction, Delany issues a provocative and passionately argued cri de c ur against New York City's gentrification in the name of \"family values and safety\" and extols the virtues of a society that not only tolerates but values a public sexual culture. His idiosyncratic and bracing blend of personal history and cultural criticism emphasizes how the kaleidoscopic possibilities of urban diversity can bestow greatness upon a city.\n\nFor the Time Being\n\nAnnie Dillard (Knopf)\n\nIn a risk-taking and inspiring meditation on life, death, God, evil, eternity and the human predicament, Dillard makes real the world's suffering and the inevitable interconnectedness of humanity.

What distinguishes this book is how Gibson transcends his rage and becomes capable of mounting a searching, moving exploration into the combination of causality and randomness that surrounds his son's death.\n\nFaster\n\nJames Gleick (Pantheon)\n\nFunny and irreverent as always, Gleick offers, nonetheless, a serious -- and refreshingly contrarian -- view of time management, technological \"improvements\" and the instantaneity of everyday life. Though \"hurry sickness\" is endemic in our culture, he shows how time d sn't go by faster despite all the rushing. This is a rare book that cuts through hype and reveals a fundamental truth about how we live our lives.\n\nReason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey\n\nJane Goodall with Phillip Berman (Warner)\n\nThe world-famous primatologist presents a spiritual autobiography that is both compelling and inspiring.

Adler (Dial)\n\nThese 425 letters, gathered by a husband-and-wife team, form a riveting epistolary chronicle of the 20th century. Written by the famous, the not-so-famous and the not-yet-famous, the letters are the work of such figures as Carl Van Doren, Huey Long, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lillian Hellman and a Vietnam soldier named Dusty. This is one of the most original literary tributes to the closing century.\n\nCareless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley\n\nPeter Guralnick (Little, Brown)\n\nAn epic American tragedy is captured in all its complexity by Guralnick in the second and final volume of his definitive account of the life of Elvis Presley.

(Knopf)\n\nIn a riveting narrative that puts diaries, letters and action reports to good use, British military historian Keegan delivers a stunningly vivid history of the Great War.

Kennedy (Oxford Univ.)\n\nRarely d s a work of historical synthesis combine such trenchant analysis and elegant writing.

Kissinger was a shrewd courtier and ferocious bureaucratic infighter, and he takes a deadpan delight in showing readers just how adept he was.\n\nAnother Life: A Memoir of Other People\n\nMichael Korda (Random)\n\nIn this charming, brightly amusing book, Korda gives a candid and warmly knowledgeable survey of the past 40 years of American publishing. He creates for himself a persona of guileless innocence coupled with quiet sophistication as he describes the countless trenchant characters of S&S's founding family as well as his colleagues. Anyone who can match Korda's hopeless and enduring passion for the book business will be delighted and touched by his endearing saga.\n\nThe Basque History of the World\n\nMark Kurlansky (Walker)\n\nIn his signature style, Kurlansky fuses political and economic history with delightful digressions (and recipes) to tell the story of the Basque people.

Lemann's keen and original analysis of the troubled course of this vision is indispensable to current affirmative action and education debates.\n\n'Tis\n\nFrank McCourt (Scribner)\n\nThe sequel to Angela's Ashes takes McCourt from his arrival in America and subsequent service in the Korean War through the mid-1980s. Like its predecessor, this memoir features a mesmerizing narrative fraught with sufferings. It triumphs by effecting a genuinely comic meditation upon human frailty, grace and possibility.\n\nOut of Place: A Memoir\n\nEdward Said (Knopf)\n\nThe noted literary scholar and author of Orientalism offers a full-blooded memoir that is a passionate account of his intellectual and moral development.

This is the moving tale of a man who is always an outsider.\n\nPlaces Left Unfinished at the Time of Creation\n\nJohn Phillip Santos (Viking)\n\nWith the exquisite craft of a p t, Santos weaves a traditional memoir of growing up in San Antonio, Tex., together with ancient Mexican history, interviews with ghosts and his own sacramental journeys to create an emblematic account of one of the thousands of Mexican families who fled to El Norte during the Mexican Revolution. Born of his passionate resistance to the loss of his family's historical memory, his testament fills a significant void in Chicano literature.\n\nMorgan: American Financier\n\nJean Strouse (Random)\n\nOften celebrated as the ideal capitalist or excoriated as the robber baron who most epitomized the iniquities of the Gilded Age, J. Pierpont Morgan has at last gained a biographer whose talents match his enormous legacy.

As Vernon's prose ricochets from Paul's possessions to his own, he gives readers both a description and an example of how a writer's mind forges a web of connections among the objects and ideas of the world. It is a beautiful performance lit by stark, revealing bursts of language and delivered with the gravity of liturgy.\n\nTime, Love, Memory: A Great Biologist and His Quest for the Origins of Behavior\n\nJonathan Weiner (Knopf)\n\nThis vigorously engrossing biography brings out of the shadows one of the unsung pioneers of molecular biology: brash, eccentric physicist-turned-biologist Seymour Benzer.

Ultimately, his tour of antigovernment sentiment throughout U.S. history is an eloquent plea for the American electorate to view government as a \"necessary good.\"\n\nReligion\n\nLetter to a Man in the Fire: D s God Exist and D s He Care?\n\nReynolds Price (Scribner)\n\nThis wise book consists of Price's response to a 1997 letter he received from a medical student stricken with cancer.

Wilson (Norton)\n\nIn this splendid book, Wilson points out that the 19th century provided the context for various theories of God's demise.

Wilson's eloquence and amazing intellectual breadth make this one of the best-ever contributions to the intellectual history of religion (or rather, irreligion).\n\nComing Out Spiritually: The Next Step\n\nChristian de la Huerta (Putnam/Tarcher)\n\nFor many years, Q-Spirit founder de la Huerta contends, gays and lesbians have been forced by organized religion to separate their sexual identities from their spiritual identities. In this courageous book, de la Huerta encourages \"queers\" (his chosen term) to engage in \"practical experimentation\" with their spirituality. Coming out spiritually, he claims, culminates the journey of self-discovery.

This is an engrossing, overall portrait of Jesus through the eyes of his family and followers.\n\nWhen Jesus Became God: The Epic Fight over Christ's Divinity in the Last Days of Rome\n\nRichard Rubenstein (Harcourt Brace)\n\nRubenstein examines the details of the fractious early period when Christianity was defining itself against other religious sects through a number of councils and creeds.

With a storyteller's verve, Rubenstein offers a panoramic view of early Christianity.\n\nChildren's Religion\n\nJourneys with Elijah: Eight Tales of the Prophet\n\nBarbara Diamond Goldin, illus. by Jerry Pinkney (Harcourt/Gulliver)\n\nAn irresistible sense of mystery and wonder pervades eight tales about Elijah, set in Jewish communities in settings as diverse as third-century North Africa, 17th-century China and colonial CuraÃ§ao.

Creating ebullient forms to meet his needs, and stirring the pot with neologism and slogan, Joans's exultations and exhortions wonderfully prefigure performance-oriented work.\n\nPamela: A Novel\n\nPamela Lu (Atelos)\n\nKnowingly resuscitating and toying with prose-p tic narrative in her debut, Lu creates a precise and humorous elegy to the self and its self-subversions. With extraordinary philosophical subtlety and clarity, the book manages to tell a beautiful story -- of \"I,\" \"P\" \"Pamela\" and her friends -- in spite of itself.\n\nMatinÃ©es\n\nAnge Mlinko (Zoland)\n\n\"Filling innocent pastry with rubies,\" Mlinko is at the forefront of a wave of quirky, emotional gesturists guided by the clear-eyed, big-heartedness of Frank O'Hara and the sensual veracity of Bernadette Mayer.

Rowling (Scholastic/Levine)\n\nThe hoopla surrounding the second and third installments of the magical series is exceeded only by the scope of Rowling's imagination and the vast pleasure of reading her work -- each successive volume expands upon its predecessor with dizzyingly well-planned plots and inventive surprises.\n\nThe Fab Five series\n\nRosie Rushton (Hyperion)\n\nWith its witty Briticisms intact, this series (which was launched with Just Don't Make a Scene, Mum!) has all the hilarious and etiquette-blasting asides of a Bridget Jones's Diary for teens. Readers will queue up for this quartet of books starring four \"brill\" gals and a guy.\n\nThe Mouse of Amherst\n\nElizabeth Spires, illus. by Claire A. Nivola (FSG/Foster)\n\nAn unlikely and charming correspondence fuels this spare, exquisite novel, whose title plays up the double entendre on Emily Dickinson's retiring nature and the p try-penning mouse that shares her abode. Filled with the p t's published works and the mouse's attempts to emulate her style, this slip of a volume will spark an interest in verse in even the most reluctant p t.\n\nNonfiction\n\nShipwreck at the Bottom of the World: The Extraordinary True Story of Shackleton and the Endurance\n\nJennifer Armstrong (Crown)\n\nAbsorbing, briskly paced storytelling loaded with kid-pleasing details turns this well-researched account of Sir Ernest Shackleton's 1914-1916 expedition to Antarctica into an enthralling and often heart-pounding armchair adventure.\n\nThrough My Eyes\n\nRuby Bridges (Scholastic)\n\nIn 1960, Bridges found herself at the center of a national controversy when she was the first African-American student to attend a New Orleans public elementary school. Here, in prose that stays unerringly true to the perspective of a child, she gives voice to her six-year-old self; sidebars providing information unavailable to Bridges as a child complete the picture. Like p try or prayer, Bridges's words melt the heart.\n\nThe World of King Arthur and His Court: People, Places, Legend, and Lore\n\nKevin Crossley-Holland, illus. by Peter Malone (Dutton)\n\nIf ever a work could inspire a passion for Camelot, it would be this eminently browsable, stylishly written trove of Arthuriana, representing everything from key characters to Chaucer's account of outfitting a knight to contemporaneous lessons in being a proper butler. Lavishly detailed, both the full-spread paintings and spot illustrations are ripe with mystery and romance.\n\nIn My Hands: Memories of a Holocaust Rescuer\n\nIrene Gut Opdyke with Jennifer Armstrong (Knopf)\n\nAs a young woman in Poland, Opdyke saved 12 Jews by hiding them in the villa of the German major for whom she kept house -- and that exploit constitutes only a small part of this extraordinary story. Delicate use of metaphor and exceptionally well-chosen details give readers almost uncanny access to Opdyke's experience, enabling them to feel her shock at wartime atrocities and understand the gradually built foundation of her heroic resistance.\n\nChinese Cinderella: The True Story of an Unwanted Daughter\n\nAdeline Yen Mah (Delacorte)\n\nWhen her father remarries and moves the family to Shanghai to evade the Japanese during WWII, young Mah and her siblings are relegated to second-class status by their stepmother. The author never veers from a child's sensibility in these pages. Mah rarely judges the cruel actions of those around her; she's simply bent on surviving, and her victory is heroic."
