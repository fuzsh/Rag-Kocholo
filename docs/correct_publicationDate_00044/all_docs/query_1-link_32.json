        "text": "Neal Stephenson is still best known for science fiction novels like Snow Crash. He's just completed The Baroque Cycle, a trilogy of novels, set in the late 17th/early 18th Century. The last part, The System of the World, was published in October by William Heinemann. He did the following interview by email in the middle of October. For more information try his official website - www.nealstephenson.com or his home page at www.well.com/user/neal\n\nOnline: You've commented before that this particular historical period - the late seventeenth/early eighteenth century - hasn't been covered so much in previous novels. Why is that, do you think, and what was it about it that interested you in particular?\n\nNeal Stephenson: This may simply be an American bias. In the 1770s we fought a war against a colonising power that shall go unnamed. Everyone knows about that. And we all learn about the early colonists at Plymouth Rock and Jamestown. But the long colonial period in between does not come in for much notice here. Maybe that is because it was fairly quiet. We had the Salem witch trials and the French and Indian War, but other than that, one gets the sense that nothing much happened during these almost 200 years. Obviously, there was a lot more happening during this era on your side of the pond, and so there are correspondingly more history books and works of fiction about it than here.\n\nHaving said all of that, I think that the period is interesting because of its sheer gaudy complexity - its baroqueness --- and difficult to write about for the same reason. One cannot really make sense of all the wars and intrigues without a wall-sized family tree of the royal houses of Europe. I cheated by making the book long, which gave me space to explain at least some of these complexities. Other eras are simple by comparison; one can simply write \"Napoleon had conquered most of Europe and wanted to invade Britain\" and the stage is set. But trying to set up the War of the Spanish Succession is a nightmare of forensic genealogy.\n\nSetting those difficulties aside, this period is fascinating because so much was going on, and so much of it was brilliant and dramatic. The Turks at the gates of Vienna, the Barbary Corsairs and other sorts of pirates, gold-galleons on the Spanish Main, the court of Louis XIV at Versailles, the invention of modern science and finance, the Mogul Empire in Hindustan---all of this was happening at one time. I don't think there was any other period of history to compare with it.\n\nOnline: Media profiles of you often mention your family background in engineering/science and your hands-on geeky tendencies - presumably in an attempt to suggest the ways you might differ from more traditional literary types. Do you think you approach writing fiction/novels in a different way to those who come from more conventional 'literary' backgrounds?\n\nNS: I doubt it. In those parts of novels where I have to explain something technical, it might save me a trip to the library. And perhaps it gives me an advantage in trying to see the world through the eyes of geeks. But I have to explain many other things besides science, and I need to see the world through other eyes besides geeks'. The way I actually produced the Baroque Cycle novels was markedly low-tech and disorderly: writing them with a pen on paper and keeping track of all of my notes in notebooks with no indexing system.\n\nMy familiarity with technology helped me by opening my eyes to its failures and limitations, and thereby dissuading me from using any of it in this project.\n\nOnline: One of the connecting threads between your different novels seems to be an interest in science and technology and the role they place in society/culture. The Baroque Cycle looks at the establishment of scientific method, the development of certain bits of technology and the development of economic systems... and you grapple with the intimate details of that period's various technologies and systems. So would it be accurate to describe BC as a kind of history seen/written from a hacker perspective?\n\nNS: That's a good start, but let's work with it a little. History is a huge teeming midden of personalities and events. There is no obvious way to make sense of it. It's difficult to make out what's important and what deserves to be forgotten. That comes later, in retrospect. But retrospect changes over time. Just to pick an example at random, consider the history of anti-semitism in Western culture. Historians of the 1930s probably didn't think it was nearly as important as did historians of the 1950s. And sometimes when one reads a pre-WW2 novel one will come across an anti-semitic passage that probably seemed funny and trivial to the person who wrote it. But seen in the light of what came later, it takes on different meanings to us.\n\nThat's a pretty gruesome and serious example, but a similar principle applies to many other topics. I have been working the information technology beat for a while. Information technology seemed to come out of nowhere in the last few decades. All the SF authors who had been predicting starships and laser guns got it wrong. We never got those things. They didn't predict ubiquitous computers---and we did get those. And so it is an interesting exercise to go back and look at history now that we know just what a big deal information technology turned out to be. If you want to call that a hacker perspective, fine. But the fact is that you and I are doing this interview on e-mail. We're living in a society that's been transformed by information technology in too many ways to enumerate. So the hacker perspective isn't just the point of view of a few geeks. It is everyone's perspective now.\n\nOnline: When you talk about writing The Baroque Cycle, it sometimes sounds as if you're talking about creating a kind of program (e.g. your references to data management problems, talk about the centrality of a yarn that holds together different data sets). Is this a way of distancing yourself from the kind of mystification indulged in by those writing 'serious lit' - perhaps even a way of gently winding them up? Or is there more to it? Do you see the BC as a kind of literary/historical hacking?\n\nNS: The technical jargon you cite above sounds like routine percolation of geek talk into modern slang. If I've used it somewhere to talk about how I wrote The Baroque Cycle, then, yes, it was probably me trying to explain what might otherwise seem a somewhat mysterious procedure.\n\nThere's something appealing in your image of me winding up serious lit mystics, but, on consideration, I think it'd be too cheap and easy for me to say \"yes, that's what I was doing.\" To begin with I don't know who these literary mystifiers are or what kind of language they are using to make their work seem mystical. Secondly, there really are some odd and hard-to-understand things going on in the head of someone who writes a novel. The more prosaic side of the job---the \"data set management\" and so on---is just a kind of busy work that I do in my spare time while waiting for the Muse to swoop down and thrust her tongue in my ear.\n\nI have said elsewhere that there are similarities between what computer programmers do and what novelists do. In both cases one is trying to build a great big system of words. It is highly structured. The structure has many layers of hierarchy. And there are many links that bind different parts of the structure together, and those links must all be sorted out. It all amounts to a quite elaborate thing. But one can't work directly on the structure itself; the only way actually to build it is by writing one letter at a time. Sort of like trying to construct a city by placing grains of sand, one at a time, with tweezers. All of this applies equally to novelists and computer programmers. Obviously the content and the intent are quite different between those two groups, but I believe that they do have to cultivate similar habits of work.\n\nOnline: In 'Cryptonomicon', the computer/crypto geeks are searching for the kind of heroic purpose the world war two code breakers had. Recently various books about hacker ethics/politics have appeared, which argue that things like the Free Software movement actually have a wider political significance beyond the world of programming. They suggest hackers are radical figures with something to teach the rest of society. What do you make of this kind of thing? Do you see potential problems in attempts to apply ideas from open source/free software/hacking to culture/politics/society?\n\nNS: For a while I have been nursing the idea that open source software is just the extension of Common Law into the realm of executable code. I daren't think I'm the first person to have thought such a thing, so I did a Google search and found some references to the idea elsewhere. It appears that Michael Tiemann of Cygnus Support (an open source software company) has been thinking along similar lines, and perhaps there are others too. It's certainly the case that commonly used Internet protocols such as TCP/IP and HTTP have attained a status akin to that of common law.\n\nAssuming one is willing to buy that analogy, then your question boils down to whether the development of this new branch of common law amounts to a heroic purpose. I believe that it is a great purpose and that it can affect society in ways that are more important and far-reaching than heroism in the glorious, swashbuckling sense. It is not, however, glorious and swashbuckling, any more than were all the efforts made by lawyers and magistrates over many centuries to build Common Law. This comes out of the fact that the development of open source software is of necessity a collective enterprise. Unless many people all over the world buy into it, it doesn't get developed, it doesn't get maintained, and it will not be widely adopted. Solitary geniuses need not apply; social and organizational skills are of the essence.\n\nOnline: You've mentioned that you're now a bit of a history buff but you weren't at school. Why is that? Is it that the kind of history being written now isn't just about great men but offers more materialist perspectives - e.g. the work of people like Braudel or Jared Diamond?\n\nNS: I enjoy reading both \"great man\" history and history of the Braudel/Diamond type.\n\nHistory is dull unless there's a yarn in it. A yarn by definition has to be about a small number of individuals who are in some kind of an interesting situation. It is, therefore, a rather fine-grained kind of history. But history teachers in schools are not allowed to teach that way. Instead they are told to teach a class called something like \"The Ancient World\" or (in this country) \"American History.\" And this makes it impossible for them to teach at the fine-grained level of individual yarns; it filters out all the interesting content and leaves only the dull stuff. If I were running a school I would begin by chucking all of those courses into the dustbin. In place of \"American History\" I'd have the kids read Cabeza de Vaca, or a biography of Jim Bowie.\n\nOnline: The books in The Baroque Cycle are incredibly detailed when it comes to conjuring up the minutiae of the period. Do you worry that it's overwhelming for some readers?\n\nNS: Anything one might put into a book will be objectionable to \"some readers\" and so if one were to take the approach of not writing anything that some readers might not like, one would never write a single word. Of course, some readers would object to that too.\n\nOne must therefore commit a sort of leap of faith. I just sit down and write it as I see fit, and keep my fingers crossed that a sufficient number of people will read it that I can continue to put bread on the table.\n\nTo put in fewer details does not necessarily make the book an easier read. Detail is what sells the story. I can write \"This guy goes out on a whaling ship, the captain turns out to be a nut job obsessed with killing a big white whale, eventually he finds it and the whale kills everyone except for this one dude\" and it might be an accurate summary of the story but it's not the story. What makes it engaging are the detailed descriptions of the ship and the people aboard, which pull you into the story and make you think you're there.\n\nOnline: The novels in The Baroque Cycle are held together with strong story lines. But at the same time, there's much complex coverage of the different cultural/technical/religious debates of the time. Is entertainment your prime aim or do you want the books to do something more? Someone like Dickens set out to entertain but his books also had a campaigning/political purpose too. Critics in the past have talked about your novels promoting a more hands-on technological literacy? Do you agree with that?\n\nNS: Nothing makes me ditch a novel more swiftly and surely than the feeling that it's been written by someone with an axe to grind, so I strive to avoid that sort of thing. And to promote technological literacy sounds like an even more boring axe to grind than most. But if the author has a passion for the material --- if he finds it interesting and exciting --- then this comes through and, with a little bit of luck, infects the reader. And so the publishing industry is routinely surprised by extremely successful books about such topics as punctuation (Eats Shoots and Leaves) or old clocks (Longitude). So yes, I'm fascinated by (to name just one example) the ways in which Puritan thought shaped the modern world, but I wouldn't dream of consciously drawing up a screed that was intended to make other people see it my way. The proof is in the pudding---if it's really all that interesting, one ought to be able to write a yarn about it that will hold people's interest. I'm certainly not claiming that my books will hold everyone's interest, but I do from time to time hear from readers who liked my books in spite of a professed lack of interest in the subject matter.\n\nOnline: Alongside the interest in science and technology, money, credit and the establishment of modern economic systems is an important theme in The Baroque Cycle - what interests you in particular about all that? Did it just flow from the characters?\n\nNS: About 10 years ago I became aware that many in the hacker/cypherpunk community were keenly interested in money---not just making money, but understanding it and implementing it on computers. To me this seemed to happen all of a sudden, and I found it interesting that they were so interested in it. Until then, most of the programmers I'd known had worked on very different sorts of projects, many of which were of a more abstract and academic nature. This was what led me down the road to writing 'Cryptonomicon', which has a lot in it about money. That led in turn to the BC. It might or might not be just a historical accident that 300 years ago Leibniz was thinking about computers while Newton and other Fellows of the Royal Society were thinking about money. But since I'd already written a novel ('Cryptonomicon') about the intersection of computers and money, it was too good to be true as far as I was concerned, and I couldn't not write about it.\n\nOnline: I think you've said the books in The Baroque Cycle are still SF novels - in what way exactly?\n\nNS: It is a little like asking a jazz musician \"your latest album is jazz---in what way exactly?\" People who are in the habit of reading SF will pick up The Baroque Cycle novels and, I suspect, recognize them as having coming out of an SF sensibility. People who aren't will probably find them to be historical novels, albeit with some quirks and twists they might not have seen before.\n\nOnline: Having immersed yourself so much in the late 17th/early 18th century, do you think you would have liked to live then? How would you have done back then? Would you have been more of a Daniel Waterhouse or do you have Jack Shaftoe tendencies? [In The Baroque Cycle, Waterhouse is a man of science who gets caught up in the big intellectual debates between Newton and Leibniz and Shaftoe is a vagabond adventurer, who gets caught up in piracy and war]\n\nNS: I had an inguinal hernia at the age of 3, which had to be surgically repaired. That should settle the question of whether I would have liked to live 300 years ago. And don't even get me started about lice.\n\nFor those who won the infant mortality lottery, whether one ended up as a Waterhouse or a Shaftoe was, I'm sure, partly down to one's disposition and partly down to circumstance. In reading about Newton, Hooke, and Flamsteed we can easily recognize signs of what would today be diagnosed as anxiety, depression, Asperger's Syndrome, etc. Vagabonds were very free in some respects, terribly limited in others. These freedoms and limits were the complements of those that nobles had to live with.\n\nI like to work for long periods of time on tightly focused activities and so probably would have ended up as a horologist or something.\n\nOnline: Some critics have suggested that in your books and The Baroque Cycle in particular, technology has a 'clear spiritual force', that in your fiction, there's a sense that understanding the world and how it works can bring people 'closer to god'. Is that something you recognise in your work? Is there a spiritual side to technology?\n\nNS: It's important to distinguish between what I think and what some of my characters think. There is a very old religious mindset called Gnosticism, and one way of summing it up is that humans can somehow get closer to God by acquiring knowledge. Until we had science, there was little to recommend this because there wasn't enough knowledge worth having, and so those who did adopt a Gnostic approach were liable to end up basing their religion on malarkey.\n\nAround the time that I'm writing about in The Baroque Cycle, people began to acquire genuine scientific knowledge and were awed by what they found. The two most eloquent expressions of this are Hooke's Micrographia and (much less accessibly) Newton's Principia Mathematica. Scientists began to feel that by probing the mysteries of creation they were gaining insights into the divine. Some took this to the conclusion that there was no divine at all---only nature. Others, like Newton and Leibniz, sought a way to reconcile science and religion.\n\nDuring the time of The Baroque Cycle, all of this was quite new, and very much in flux. No one knew what would be discovered next, or what it would all lead to. I don't think they could have predicted that 300 years in the future people would still be debating the same issues. And so in the BC books there are quite a few people who spend a lot of their time and mental energy pondering such matters. My writing about such characters is more a way of characterizing the era than of staking myself to a particular position.\n\nI do think that those who devote their lives to studying science or to building new technologies learn certain habits of thought. They derive satisfaction from finding new truths, or doing things in a way that is more elegant. Perhaps this could be considered spiritual. It is a way of confirming over and over again that the universe makes sense and follows orderly laws, which a religiously significant assertion.\n\nOnline: Do you have any idea of what your next novel will be about? Have you started it? Will it be connected to The Baroque Cycle in the same way that there are links between those novels and Cryptonomicon?\n\nNS: No, no, and no. I have not settled on what my next project will be. Some day I might write more in the vein of Baroque Cycle/Cryptonomicon, but at the moment I need to get away from these characters and these themes and---to paraphrase Monty Python---do something completely different for some years.\n\nOnline: Were you involved in the setting up of the Metaweb wiki devoted to Quicksilver. Has anything interesting come out of that?\n\nNS: The technical setting-up was done by some people at a company called Applied Minds, though heavily based on the open-source Wiki software and the Wikipedia project. I supplied content in the form of annotations of my books (and a couple of annotations of a Heinlein book). It is too early to deliver a verdict on the result.\n\nOnline: Do wikis and the like interest you more than blogging? Have you been tempted to blog - or would it end up being a distraction? Is blogging part of the continuous partial attention culture? What areas of current online culture are you most interested in?\n\nNS: Blogging could certainly be a distraction. That's why I've avoided it in the past. But one thing I've learned from the metaweb project is that to answer questions on the Internet, where interested people can look those answers up, can actually be a time-saver in the long run. Hardly a revolutionary idea, I know, but it was a useful piece of information to me.\n\nBlogging needn't be a continuous partial attention sort of thing. Nothing prevents a blogger from writing in depth. To me the interesting thing about blogging is the crossing of formerly well-defined lines between public and private. I personally know of instances where someone made a remark in what they thought of as a private setting that got put on the Internet by a blogger who was in the room. As that kind of thing becomes more common, it's going to change the way people behave. My fear is that it will turn everyone into politicians, who speak in the most mealy-mouthed style possible for fear that something they say will be taken out of context and made eternal in the media.\n\nOnline: How's the rocket business going?
