        "text": "Trickster\n\nIf you have been hanging around these parts for a while, you are aware that I'm a big fan of Jeff Somers' Avery Cates novels (The Electric Church, The Digital Plague, The Eternal Prison, The Terminal State, and The Final Evolution). I was sad to see that series come to an end and I wondered what Somers would come up with next.\n\nIt's no secret that urban fantasy has become the biggest game in town in recent years. We now see bestselling authors like Jacqueline Carey, Tad Williams, and a bunch of others giving that sub-genre a shot in the hope of riding that lucrative wave. And yet, not everyone, regardless of how talented they are, can capture the imagination of readers the way someone like Jim Butcher can. No matter how popular urban fantasy continues to be, I have a feeling that the sub-genre has become a bit saturated of late.\n\nI love how edgy and in-your-face Somers' writing style has always been. I had no idea what his take on urban fantasy would turn out to be when it was announced that he would play in that sandbox when he signed a new book deal with Pocket Books. But I knew that it would be different. Jeff somers wrote Trickster with the same attitude that permeated the Avery Cates books. The somewhat noir novel is filled with wit and the author's dark sense of humor, flawed protagonists, and lots of grit. All in all, it contains all the ingredients that make this one another highly entertaining yarn!\n\nHere's the blurb:\n\nPraised by the Guardian for stories that are “exhilarating . . . powerful and entertaining,” Jeff Somers returns with a darkly original urban fantasy series featuring a cadre of mages operating just under the radar of human society.\n\nMagic uses blood—a lot of it. The more that’s used, the more powerful the effect, so mages find “volunteers” to fuel their spells. Lem, however, is different. Long ago he set up a rule that lets him sleep at night: never use anyone’s blood but your own. He’s grifting through life as a Trickster, performing only small Glamours like turning one-dollar bills into twenties. He and his sidekick, Mags, aren’t doing well, but they’re getting by.\n\nThat is, until they find young Claire Mannice— bound and gagged, imprisoned in a car’s trunk, and covered with invisible rune tattoos. Lem turns to his estranged mentor for help, but what they’ve uncovered is more terrifying than anybody could have imagined. Mika Renar, the most dangerous Archmage in the world, is preparing to use an ocean of blood to cast her dreams into reality— and Lem just got in her way.\n\nAs stated in the blurb, magic requires blood in Jeff Somers' The Ustari Cycle. The more powerful the spell, the more blood is needed. In light of that, most of history's great disasters were in truth schemes orchestrated by mages meant to kill countless multitudes in order to trigger mighty feats of magic or rituals. With Trickster being essentially the opening chapter of a much larger tale, the author keeps his cards close to his chest regarding most of what has to do with magic. Of course, readers get the basics concerning the use of blood and the need for Words, and Somers elaborates briefly on the hierarchy of magic-wielders. But other than that, one reaches the end without knowing a whole lot about that aspect of the story. Personally, I would have liked to learn more about magic and everything it encompasses. Yet I understand the need to keep Trickster self-contained enough so that the book can be read as a stand-alone. Info-dumps and other elaborations would probably have gotten in the way of the tale and would have hurt the pace of the book. In any event, the way Somers brings this one to a close demonstrates that there is a lot more than meets the eye and that the overall storyline is much more multilayered than we were first led to believe. So I'm quite intrigued to find out what happens next!\n\nWe were not good people.\n\nIn a recent article titled \"The Value of Grit,\" bestselling fantasy author Joe Abercrombie discusses facets such as the dirt physical and moral, the attention to unpleasant detail, the greyness of the characters, and the cynicism of the outlook in gritty genre books. If you are a fan of this sort of thing, then Trickster might be for you. If flawed characters with several shades of gray are your cup of tea, you'll find it hard not to root for Lem. He may not be the sharpest tool in the shed and he seems to possess a knack to make things go from bad to worse, but his heart is in the right place. The first person narrative means that we see everything unfold through his eyes, which makes for a fun and entertaining ride. Problem is, as interesting as it is to spend all that time in Lem's head, it prevents readers from getting to know the supporting cast. Given their importance in the bigger scheme of things, it would have been nice to learn more about Claire and Mika Renar. Having said that, I doubt that the novel would have been as good without Lem's first person narrative. Mags was a bit of a disappointment, however. I know there's likely a lot more to him than meets the eye, but Lem's hulking sidekick is little more than a caricature of sorts in this first installment.\n\nWe were fucking incompetent. In all things, we’d failed. We were wallowing in a nice, comfy pit of fucking spectacular failure, deep black and hermetically sealed, me and Mags bound together forever and ever with deep fishhooked ties of ruin.\n\nIn the past, Jeff Somers accustomed readers to fast-paced, balls-to-the-wall, high octane novels with impressive body counts. Although not as fast-paced as the Avery Cates books, the rhythm throughout Trickster is crisp and page-turning. The more the story progresses, the more layers are revealed, thus unveiling additional, more far-reaching plotlines that will indubitably be explored in the forthcoming sequels. As was the case with Jim Butcher's Storm Front, you don't know much about the overall story arc when you reach the end of Trickster. And yet, you are definitely hooked and want to find out where Somers will take this story next.\n\nA very auspicious beginning. . . If you are tired of the same old, same old, and want a different take on urban fantasy from a cutting edge author, give Trickster a shot. You won't be disappointed.\n\nThe final verdict: 7.75/10\n\nFor more info about this title: Canada, USA, Europe\n\nBook trailer for Peter Higgins' WOLFHOUND CENTURY\n\nOrbit has just released a new book trailer for Peter Higgins' Wolfhound Century (Canada, USA, Europe).\n\nThey have also created a new website to help promote the novel.\n\nGeorge R.

As its dark energy leeches into the crash site, so a circle of death expands around it, slowly - inexorably - killing everything it touches. Alone in the wilderness, it reaches out with its mind.\n\nThe endless forest and its antique folklore are no concern to Inspector Vissarion Lom, summoned to the capital in order to catch a terrorist - and ordered to report directly to the head of the secret police. A totalitarian state, worn down by an endless war, must be seen to crush home-grown terrorism with an iron fist. But Lom discovers Mirgorod to be more corrupted than he imagined: a murky world of secret police and revolutionaries, cabaret clubs and doomed artists. Lom has been chosen because he is an outsider, not involved in the struggle for power within the party. And because of the sliver of angel stone implanted in his head at the children's home.\n\nLom's investigation reveals a conspiracy that extends to the top echelons of the party. When he exposes who - or rather what - is the controlling intelligence behind this, it is time for the detective to change sides. Pursued by rogue police agents and their man-crushing mudjhik, Lom must protect Kantor's step-daughter Maroussia, who has discovered what is hidden beneath police headquarters: a secret so ancient that only the forest remembers. As they try to escape the capital and flee down river, elemental forces are gathering. The earth itself is on the move.\n\nFollow this link to read the excerpt.\n\nQuote of the Day\n\nMen need to whisper secrets, Lady. That's what makes them different from us--they need to share secrets, but we women only reveal them to gain an advantage. With a little silver and a ready ear--and I have both--it's all so easy. Yes. Men need to share secrets. That's why we're superior to them and they'll always be in our power.\n\n- JAMES CLAVELL, Shogun (Canada, USA, Europe)\n\nAbout 900 pages into this book and it is still absolutely awesome!\n\nMore inexpensive ebook goodies!\n\nYou can download a number of Arthur C. Clarke's classics on the cheap!\n\nYou can get your hands on Childhood's End for 2.99$ here.\n\nHere's the blurb:\n\nIn the near future, enormous silver spaceships appear without warning over mankind’s largest cities. They belong to the Overlords, an alien race far superior to humanity in technological development—and their purpose is to dominate the Earth. Their demands, however, are surprisingly beneficial—end war, poverty, and cruelty. Their presence, rather than signaling the end of humanity, ushers in a golden age—or so it seems.\n\nBut it comes at a price. Without conflict, humanity ceases to work toward creative achievement, and culture stagnates. And as the years pass, it becomes more and more clear that the Overlords have a hidden agenda for the evolution of the human race—that may not be as beneficial as it seems.\n\nOriginally published in 1953, Childhood’s End is Clarke’s first successful novel—and is considered a classic of science fiction literature. Its dominating theme of transcendent evolution appears in many of Clarke’s later works, including the Space Odyssey series. In 2004, the book was nominated for the Retro Hugo Award for Best Novel.\n\nYou can also download The City and the Stars for 2.99$ here.\n\nHere's the blurb:\n\nA billion years into the future, Earth’s oceans have evaporated—and humanity has all but vanished. The inhabitants of the City of Diaspar believe theirs is the last city—but there is no way to find out for sure. The city is completely closed off by a high wall, and nobody has left in millions of years.\n\nThe last child born in the city in millions of years, Alvin is insatiably curious about the outside world. He embarks on a quest that leads him to discover the truth about the city and humanity’s history—as well as its future.\n\nThe City and the Stars is a rewrite of Clarke’s first novel, Against the Fall of Night. While the author assumed that the old version would be replaced by the new version and eventually go out of print, he was surprised to find that the older version was popular enough to stay in wide circulation. Today, both stories are equally popular.\n\nAny fan of Clarke’s would find this book a fascinating read, not just for the intriguing story and Clarke’s singular futuristic vision, but also for the purpose of comparing his approach to the same story at different points in his writing career. While The City and the Stars shares the general plot of Against the Fall of Night, many details are different—making an interesting study of Clarke’s progression as a writer.\n\n2010: Odyssey Two is also available for 2.99$ here.\n\nHere's the blurb:\n\nIn 1968, Arthur C. Clarke’s best-selling 2001: A Space Odyssey captivated the world—and was adapted into a now-classic film by Stanley Kubrick. Fans had to wait fourteen years for the sequel—but when it came out, it was an instant hit, winning the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1983.\n\nNine years after the ill-fated Discovery One mission to Jupiter, a joint Soviet-American crew travels to the planet to investigate the mysterious monolith orbiting the planet, the cause of the earlier mission’s failure—and the disappearance of David Bowman. The crew includes Heywood Floyd, the lone survivor from the previous mission, and Dr. Chandra, the creator of HAL.\n\nWhat they find is no less than an unsettling alien conspiracy—surrounding the evolutionary fate of indigenous life forms on Jupiter’s moon Europa, as well as that of the human species itself. A gripping continuation of the beloved Odyssey universe, 2010: Odyssey II is science-fiction storytelling at its best.\n\nYou can download The Songs of Distant Earth for 2.99$ here.\n\nHere's the blurb:\n\nMore than two thousand years in the future, a small human colony thrives on the ocean paradise of Thalassa—sent there centuries ago to continue the human race before the Earth’s destruction.\n\nThalassa’s resources are vast—and the human colony has lived a bucolic life there. But their existence is threatened when the spaceship Magellan arrives on their world—carrying one million refugees from Earth, fleeing the dying planet.\n\nReputed to be Arthur C. Clarke’s favorite novel, Songs of Distant Earth addresses several fascinating scientific questions unresolved in their time—including the question of why so few neutrinos from the sun have been measured on Earth. In addition, Clarke presents an inventive depiction of the use of vacuum energy to power spacecraft—and the technical logistics of space travel near the speed of light.\n\nYou can also get your hands on The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke: History Lesson, Volume 1 for 2.99 here.\n\nHere's the blurb:\n\nIn the title story of this collection, Earth has entered its final ice age—precipitated by the cooling of the sun. In this forbidding climate, a small tribe of nomadic human survivors travels toward the equator ahead of glaciers moving down from the North Pole, carrying with them a handful of relics from the 21st century—and racing against the ice to preserve them from annihilation.\n\nThis collection is a showcase of groundbreaking stories that wrestle with the moral, psychological, and ethical implications of scientific advancement—written by one of the foremost science fiction authors of our time.\n\nThere are more Clarke ebooks available at a discount, but that's enough for this post. . . =)\n\nThe Value of Grit by Joe Abercrombie\n\nGritty author Joe Abercrombie wrote an interesting article on the level of grit in fantasy books that's well worth a read. Especially for those little goodie-two-shoes SFF fans who are always whining about this particular aspect found in various works.\n\nHere's a teaser:\n\nI have been observing for some time a certain tendency for people to complain about the level of grit in fantasy books. The dirt physical and moral. The attention to unpleasant detail. The greyness of the characters. The cynicism of the outlook. I’m going to be vague about who I mean that I may properly remove all nuance from their arguments and construct a total straw man, of course. This is the internet, after all, I wouldn’t want facts or charitable interpretations to get in the way of my pontificating. But I think we can accept that some people think things have got too gritty. Or maybe gritty in the wrong way. Grimdark is a phrase I’m hearing quite a lot, which seems by definition to be pejorative – excessively and unnecessarily dark, cynical, violent, brutal without purpose and beyond the point of ridiculousness. There’s often what seems to me a slightly weird double standard applied of, ‘I find this thoroughly horrible and disgusting therefore the author must have intended me to be titillated and entertained!’\n\n[...]\n\nOthers are less evangelical, but there’s a tendency to see grit as skeevy. As by default an appeal to the lowest common denominator. As wallowing in low-grade moral slime like a pig in filth for no better reason that the amusement of neanderthal idiots. We idiots, of course, need and deserve amusement as much as anyone else, if not more, and I’m happy to fill that need, but such criticisms ignore what grit has to offer to all kinds of other readers and, I would argue, entirely miss why it has become so popular of late.\n\nNow before anyone makes a straw man out of me, let me say that this is not intended as some kind of manifesto. I don’t think everything has to be gritty by any means, in fact there’s a degree to which grit loses its power the more of it there is. Every writer has to find their own style, their own way to be truthful. And with great grit comes great responsibility. It’s easy in an earnest desire to be truthful, or perhaps a less earnest desire to bludgeon the reader with the amazing dirty grim gritty grim depths of which you are capable, to ride roughshod on your spiky horse over rightly sensitive issues. To cause offence through crap writing. Maybe to a degree that’s inevitable. Removing all crap writing from a given book is a herculean challenge. But I believe the role of a writer is not to avoid offence. Just to think carefully afterwards and reflect on how you might do better next time. To be assessing criticism and constantly striving to become that little bit less crap. But you’ve also sometimes got to laugh in the face of criticism. Because the role of the writer is also to throw caution to the wind and write the most honest and heartfelt books you can. Better to have a book that many readers love and some find revolting than a book that no one reads at all. Far, far better. Gritty is one tool in the writer’s arsenal, and it’s one I personally like to use. In discussing gritty, I’m going to be a little gritty. Possibly even grimdark. But if you really don’t like that shit, why are you even here?\n\n[...]\n\nThere was a time when epic fantasy seemed to spend a whole lot of time on setting. It was about the maps, monsters and magic systems. The authorial voice hovered above the characters at some remove in a third person omniscient kind of way, occasionally dipping into their thoughts for a heroic aside. These days a lot of writers choose to get closer, to write in tight point of view, to give the reader a sense of what it’s like to be those people and how they see the world. And extreme people in extreme situations may well think, feel, and observe some pretty extreme stuff. I’d argue it’s very hard to write a convincing, immersive combat scene in tight point of view without including those details of blood, pain, fear, and horror that by definition take it into the arena of gritty. You don’t have to be an actual mass murderer yourself to realise that real violence is painful, dirty and deeply unpleasant, with sudden and explosive lasting physical and psychological damage stripped of all romance. Violence, related truthfully in tight point of view, is gritty. Of course you could find your drama elsewhere. In commerce, in conversation, in romance. But epic fantasy is about war, is about battle, is about violence and people who inflict and suffer it. These are live and pressing topics which people want to read about.\n\n[...]\n\nThe modern world, with its 24 hour coverage of every point of view, seems like a much murkier place, at least to me. Perhaps we no longer accept the idea that people can be totally good or totally evil. At least we begin to suspect that they’re often not. That sometimes we’re dealing more with the greater good and the necessary evil. That the exercise of power requires compromises with the dark side, and high motives rarely entirely survive contact with reality. That everyone thinks they’re good, and that good people in bad corners might have to do bad things. Some of us want to read about such characters. We may not want every character in every book to be a morally grey irredeemable torturing tortured fuckwad. But some shades of grey, or even black, in some parts of a genre is a healthy thing. The bad things our good people have to do? They’re gritty. The good motives the bad people have in order to make them at all believable? You know what, they’re gritty too. When the whole thing becomes such a moral jumble that it’s really difficult any longer to tell which are the bad or good guys? That’s really gritty.\n\n[...]\n\nForget historical accuracy. The truth is fantasy is rarely about the world as it was. That’s what historical fiction is for. It’s a reaction to the fantasy that’s come before. Gritty fantasy is a reaction to and a counterbalancing of a style of fantasy in which life is clean, meaningful, and straightforward, and the coming of the promised king really does solve all social problems, and there are often magical solutions to the horrors – like death, illness, and crippling wounds – that plague us in the real world. Good fantasy does not have to gaze wistfully over its shoulder at an imagined past, it can cast its uncompromising eye on the now. . .\n\n[...]\n\nIn the end, ‘teh gritty’ is another tool in the toolbox. Grit is an inclusion. Not grit is an absence. Nothing to prevent gritty books including the ennobling, the clean, the beautiful. Indeed, I’d argue that the extremes of darkness only allow the glimpses of light to twinkle all the more brightly, if that’s the effect you’re after. Clean books deny themselves a chunk of the physical and emotional spectrum. Not to mention the wonderful, versatile and expressive word, ‘fuck’. And yeah, a lot of gritty dwells more in the dark half, perhaps, but often less than people tiringly bemoan, and no book exists in a vacuum, all books grow out of what has come before. A lot of gritty writing is about counterbalancing the heaps of clean, shiny, good guys win type stuff which dominated commercial fantasy throughout the 80s and 90s and is still, as far as I’m aware, being written very successfully and in large quantities.\n\n[...]\n\nAnd the fact is, for those who don’t like it, one has to smile, shrug and say – Tough Grit. There have always been rich seams of darkness, cynicism, savagery and moral ambiguity in fantasy, but this stuff is in the commercial heart of the genre now, and at the core of many of those examples that are spilling out into the mainstream. There are an awful lot of readers who love it, who find it has reinvigorated their interest in a tired genre, and the genie won’t go back in the bottle. I would say sorry, but I’m not.\n\n[...]\n\nThere are still plenty of writers and publishers very successfully putting out more traditional stuff if you really need another righteous hero endlessly prevailing against the odds. In due course I don’t doubt the pendulum will swing back at least some of the way towards romantic and heroic. It’ll just take one great, interesting, exciting book to do it and I look forward to reading it. Who knows, I might even try to write it. But for the moment most of the debuts, most of the things that are really generating excitement, are more or less gritty. In this, fantasy is simply starting to catch up with what’s been going on in TV for some time now, and where written westerns and thrillers have been for years.\n\nFollow this link to read the full piece.

I have an Advance Reading Copy on its way and I can't wait to read this book!\n\nHere's the blurb:\n\nIn his critically acclaimed novel Under Heaven, Guy Gavriel Kay told a vivid and powerful story inspired by China’s Tang Dynasty. Now, the international bestselling and multiple award-winning author revisits that invented setting four centuries later with an epic of prideful emperors, battling courtiers, bandits and soldiers, nomadic invasions, and a woman battling in her own way, to find a new place for women in the world – a world inspired this time by the glittering, decadent Song Dynasty.\n\nRen Daiyan was still just a boy when he took the lives of seven men while guarding an imperial magistrate of Kitai. That moment on a lonely road changed his life—in entirely unexpected ways, sending him into the forests of Kitai among the outlaws. From there he emerges years later—and his life changes again, dramatically, as he circles towards the court and emperor, while war approaches Kitai from the north.\n\nLin Shan is the daughter of a scholar, his beloved only child. Educated by him in ways young women never are, gifted as a songwriter and calligrapher, she finds herself living a life suspended between two worlds. Her intelligence captivates an emperor—and alienates women at the court. But when her father’s life is endangered by the savage politics of the day, Shan must act in ways no woman ever has.\n\nIn an empire divided by bitter factions circling an exquisitely cultured emperor who loves his gardens and his art far more than the burdens of governing, dramatic events on the northern steppe alter the balance of power in the world, leading to events no one could have foretold, under the river of stars.\n\nThis week's New York Times Bestsellers (February 18th)\n\nIn hardcover:\n\nRobert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson's A Memory of Light maintains its position at number 3.

Over the centuries, cities and governments have risen and fallen beyond the concent's walls. Three times during history's darkest epochs violence born of superstition and ignorance has invaded and devastated the cloistered mathic community. Yet the avout have always managed to adapt in the wake of catastrophe, becoming out of necessity even more austere and less dependent on technology and material things. And Erasmas has no fear of the outside -- the Extramuros -- for the last of the terrible times was long, long ago.\n\nNow, in celebration of the week-long, once-in-a-decade rite of Apert, the fraas and suurs prepare to venture beyond the concent's gates -- at the same time opening them wide to welcome the curious \"extras\" in. During his first Apert as a fraa, Erasmas eagerly anticipates reconnecting with the landmarks and family he hasn't seen since he was \"collected.\" But before the week is out, both the existence he abandoned and the one he embraced will stand poised on the brink of cataclysmic change.\n\nPowerful unforeseen forces jeopardize the peaceful stability of mathic life and the established ennui of the Extramuros -- a threat that only an unsteady alliance of saecular and avout can oppose -- as, one by one, Erasmas and his colleagues, teachers, and friends are summoned forth from the safety of the concent in hopes of warding off global disaster. Suddenly burdened with a staggering responsibility, Erasmas finds himself a major player in a drama that will determine the future of his world -- as he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey that will carry him to the most dangerous, inhospitable corners of the planet . . . and beyond.\n\nCover art for the limited edition of Joe Abercrombie's THE HEROES\n\nAbercrombie just unveiled the beautiful Raymond Swanland wraparound cover art for the Subterranean Press limited edition of The Heroes!\n\nFor more info about this special edition, check out the Subpress website.\n\n2012 Nebula Awards Nominees\n\nHere are the 2012 nominees for the Nebula Awards:\n\nNovel\n\nThrone of the Crescent Moon, Saladin Ahmed (DAW; Gollancz ’13)\n\nIronskin, Tina Connolly (Tor)\n\nThe Killing Moon, N.K.

Hamilton and Richard Morgan insured that my curiosity was well and truly piqued. Peter Higgins' Wolfhound Century appeared to be unlike everything else on the market out there.\n\nAfter the major disappointment that was A Memory of Light, I needed something different, something that could help me get back on track. And for some reason, Higgings' novel seemed to be just what the doctor ordered.\n\nHere's the blurb:\n\nInspector Vissarion Lom has been summoned to the capital in order to catch a terrorist --- and ordered to report directly to the head of the secret police. A totalitarian state, worn down by an endless war, must be seen to crush home-grown terrorism with an iron fist. But Lom discovers Mirgorod to be more corrupted than he imagined: a murky world of secret police and revolutionaries, cabaret clubs and doomed artists. Lom has been chosen because he is an outsider, not involved in the struggle for power within the party. And because of the sliver of angel stone implanted in his head.\n\nThe worldbuilding is fascinating and probably my favorite aspect of this work. The pseudo-Soviet communist environment makes for an atypical setting for this SFF tale. The depiction of this totalitarian state was particularly well-done and gives Wolfhound Century its own unique flavor. The narrative is dark and brooding, which creates an irresistible atmosphere. Oddly enough, throughout the book I kept hearing the song \"Belly of the Beast\" by Anthrax as I was reading on.\n\nYou walk this earth without a heart\n\nYou tear the innocent's souls apart\n\nYou shovel your conscience into the grave\n\nYou walk this earth without a heart\n\nYour uniform couldn't be take off\n\nA tattoo burned into your flesh\n\nYour mind, your voice\n\nThese are your instruments of death\n\nHow could you dare to be so bold\n\nYou only did as you were told\n\nMarionettes dancing in time\n\nTo the apologetic lines\n\nFor all the monsters of our time\n\nWolfhound Century is impossible to label. It's some sort of hybrid that combines contrasting fantasy and science fiction elements. The mysticism of the Forest and its creatures are definitely fantasy, while Angels falling from the sky after roaming the stars are essentially science fiction. Sadly, the author doesn't elaborate much on those topics. Which means that a vast aura of mystery permeates the entire novel. Interestingly enough, although this could be perceived as a negative point, it just makes you dig into the tale even more.\n\nThe cast of characters is comprised of a decidedly disparate bunch of men and women. To be honest, I found that a bit off-putting at the beginning. And yet, as the story progresses, you realize that you need all those discordant POVs in order to fully understand what is taking place and to appreciate the depth of Peter Higgins' creation. Hence, it's not always about shining some light on the protagonists' thoughts and motivations, but it is also about giving readers a chance to learn more about the world at large and the way society works. Understandably, from the start one realizes that it's Inspector Vissarion Lom and Joseph Kantor's tale, as almost everything hinges on them both. But Wolfhound Century wouldn't be a page-turner without its supporting cast. Indeed, it's those secondary characters whose POVs unveil just how many layers there are to this story. Hence, Maroussia Shaumian, Raku Vishnik, Lakoba Petrov, and Major Safran are, in their own ways, as important to the overall story arc.\n\nInsanity, the normal state\n\nThe left hand a hammer, the right, the stake\n\nDriven so deep into the heart\n\nIt's killing love, it's killing faith\n\nIt's killing 'cause it's from the heart\n\nWhat better way to demoralize\n\nWhen your own children are your spies\n\nThe things you trust are not the same\n\nTrust in death, trust in grief\n\nTrust in hope is trust in pain\n\nWolfhound Century grabs hold of you from the get-go and refuses to let you go. The rhythm is not fast-paced by any stretch of the imagination, but the tale captures your imagination in such a way that makes this book very hard to put down. The relatively short chapters force you to keep going, making you reach the end all too soon.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem. There is no ending per se. Sure, you reach an ending. But there is absolutely no closure, no resolution to any of the plotlines. Taken aback, at first I believed that my Advance Reading Copy was missing a few chapters. I contacted the folks at Orbit to inquire whether or not that was the case, but I was told that my ARC was indeed complete. And although Higgins signed a book deal for a trilogy, there is no concrete information regarding the title and tentative release date of a sequel at the moment. . .\n\nWhich, in the end, left me quite perplexed. Peter Higgins' Wolfhound Century was well on its way to becoming the speculative fiction debut of the year. In this house, in any event. But to bring what was up until that point a brilliant story to such an arbitrary ending, with no resolution whatsoever, makes no sense. This was shaping up to be one of the very best SFF titles of 2013. But the manner with which Wolfhound Century was brought to a close, I'm not sure what to make of it. To give you a sense of perspective, it is as though Star Wars would have ended when the Millennium Falcon reached Yavin IV. . .\n\nStill, Wolfhound Century remains a very good read. For the setting alone, it's well worth a read. But the total absence of closure will definitely put off certain readers.\n\nTo learn more about the author and the book, you can visit Higgins' official website.\n\nThe final verdict: 7.5/10\n\nFor more info about this title: Canada, USA, Europe\n\nExtract from Guy Gavriel Kay's RIVER OF STARS\n\nWith River of Stars (Canada, USA, Europe) coming out in a few short weeks, Far Beyond Reality has the entire first chapter for you to enjoy!\n\nFollow this link to read the extract.\n\nIt's out!!!\n\nAs of today, we can finally get our hands on HBO's Game of Thrones, Season 2 DVD and Blu-ray boxsets!

Will you tell us a bit about the research you did for these novels, which take place in ancient China?\n\nWell, small caveat, but an important one. As always in my work, it is not ‘in ancient China’ it is in a setting meant to evoke ancient China (the Song Dynasty this time). I do this ‘quarter turn to the fantastic’ for many reasons, and can be quite startlingly boring on the subject. For those with a tolerance for pain, there are essays and speeches over at brightweavings.com in the ‘GGK’s Words’ section.\n\nThe research for each novel is, put simply, my favorite part of any book. I am just learning things, reading, travel sometimes, corresponding with experts in a time and place. And in the early stages I have no duties, no responsibilities yet. Eventually the nagging voice becomes really assertive and I know I have to shift gears and begin to produce something from that year or two of preparation. But by now it is clear (to me) that my creativity flows best when grounded in a lot of detail. Indeed, I believe that grounding has to be so secure that the vast majority of the research does not enter the book except subliminally, or does so very quietly … or else you get what I hate as a reader, which is the ‘info dump’ meant to show off that the author did a bit of background stuff!\n\nQuite a bit of fantasy features characters that are very black and white, with nothing in between, no gray. Your stories feature very gray characters much of the time and challenge the reader to judge for themselves the “right” and “wrong” of their actions. Do you personally find it to be more challenging to write “gray” characters? Was this a conscious choice on your part when you started writing or was it a more organic process?\n\nI honestly think we write the books we’d like to read if someone else wrote them. Since I tend to be bored by the absence of subtlety or nuance, I suppose I am always trying to achieve that in my work. It is for the reader, obviously, to decide if a) they like this idea and b) I succeed. So it isn’t so much ‘conscious’ or ‘organic’ as a matter of my own aesthetic, I guess. I have been teased that I’ve never met a seocndary character I didn’t like … and there’s truth to that. I often find that through the peripheral figures I can achieve my strongest effects, whether of character, emotion, or shaping depth to a setting for the reader.\n\nFollow this link to read the whole interview."
