        "text": "On a fiction reading binge lately, I finally got around to reading Neal Stephenson's massive impressive 900-page novel Cryptonomicon (which I bought in a used book store a decade ago; it was originally published in 1999). I got totally sucked into it, finishing it in two weeks.\n\nI'd not read anything by Stephenson before, though I had often seen praise for Cryptonomicon and Snow Crash and Diamond Age. Since I'm interested in cryptography, random number generation, security, and World War 2 history, Cryptonomicon sounded up my alley!\n\nAnd I was not disappointed! What a sprawling epic adventure, with a huge cast of characters (of which 3 are main viewpoint characters), set in World War 2 and also at the end of the 20th century as the worldwide web and cellphones and such are starting to take off. The novel is not science fiction, but it feels sort of like science fiction, not only in an \"alternate history\" or \"secret history\" way, but also in its geeky love of math and technology and its occasional speculation on how the near future might unfold.\n\nThe novel consists of a hundred relatively short chapters, almost every one of them told from the viewpoint of Bobby Shaftoe (a US Marine during WW2), Lawrence Waterhouse (a mathematician and WW2 codebreaker) and Randy Waterhouse (a modern day computer geek).\n\nThere are a variety of dramatic action scenes set in various theaters of World War 2, and a variety of modern scenes of internet startup business stuff. An odd contrast. Of course the lives and stories of these 3 very different characters (separated by temperament and by time) end up intertwining, though the various specific aspects of how this will happen are not clear at the start. Lots of different things tie together and pay off later.\n\nSince the novel involves World War 2 cryptography, of course Alan Turing is an important secondary character, and there is lots of fascinating historical fact and quasi-alternate history concerning codebreaking efforts and technology!\n\nVarious other significant historical figures from WW2 make cameo appearances as well. Overall there is a lot of interesting content for fans of WW2 history.\n\nThere is also a lot of interesting geographical content. Many vividly described scenes happen in the Philippines (both WW2 and modern), as well as Europe, North Africa, USA, and several fictional small countries!\n\nThere's plenty of (usually interesting) philosophizing about science, politics, history, mythology, language, sociology, economics, business, etc etc.\n\nAlong the way one learns about all kinds of interesting geeky technical stuff that pays off in various ways, e.g. pipe organs, scuba diving, Van Eck phreaking (to remotely read what's on someone's computer screen), and more.\n\nThere's also a lot of characterization of the social cluelessness of WW2 Lawrence and modern Randy, both geeky in their own ways. They sometimes overthink things, as geeks do, and occasionally Stephenson rambles in such scenes, pursuing some line of thought farther than a typical person would, often to humorous effect.\n\nStephenson's style of humor often has an exaggerated geeky deadpan style. E.g. here's an airport scene (which was interesting to read in the current pandemic context):\n\nQuote:\n\nAt the currency exchange window of NAIA, Randy had stood behind a Chinese man who, just before he stepped back from the window with his money, unloaded a Sneeze of such titanic force that the rolling pressure wave turbulating outwards from his raw, flapping facial orifices caused the wall of bulletproof glass separating him from the moneychangers to flex slightly, so that the reflection of the Chinese man, Randy behind him, the lobby of NAIA and the sunlit passenger-dropoff lane outside underwent a subtle warpage. The viruses must have roiled back from the glass, reflected like light, and enveloped Randy. So maybe Randy is the personal vector of this year’s version of the flu-named-after-some-city-in-East-Asia that annually tours the United States, just barely preceded by rush shipments of flu vaccine. Or maybe it’s Ebola.\n\nThere are also various scenes I found very touching, some happy and some sad. And some surprising disturbing grisly scenes of inhumanity, and a few dramatic deaths.\n\n===\n\nBut of course you're thinking \"Yeah, yeah, but what about boardgames in Cryptonomicon?\"\n\nA few boardgame-related scenes come to mind:\n\n1. An ornate and expensive-looking Go board makes an appearance during an important business meeting...\n\nQuote:\n\nHe is approaching a large and (of course) ornate and expensive-looking Go board covered with a complex pattern of black and white stones. \"Perhaps I can make an analogy to Go—though chess would work just as well. Because of our history, we Kinakutans are well-versed in both games. At the beginning of the game, the pieces are arranged in a pattern that is simple and easy to understand. But the game evolves. The players make small decisions, one turn at a time, each decision fairly simple in and of itself, and made for reasons that can be easily understood, even by a novice. But over the course of many such turns, the pattern develops such great complexity that only the finest minds—or the finest computers—can comprehend it.\" The sultan is gazing down thoughtfully at the Go board as he says this. He looks up and starts making eye contact around the room. \"The analogy is clear. Our policies concerning free speech, telecommunications and cryptography have evolved from a series of simple, rational decisions. But they are today so complex that no one can understand them, even in one single country, to say nothing of all countries taken together.\"\n\nThe sultan pauses and walks broodingly around the Go board. The guests have mostly given up on the obsequious nodding and jotting by this point. No one is being tactical now, they are all listening with genuine interest, wondering what he’s going to say next.\n\nBut he says nothing. Instead he lays one arm across the board and, with a sudden violent motion, sweeps all the stones aside. They rain down into the carpet, skitter across polished stone, clatter onto the tabletop.\n\nThere is a silence of at least fifteen seconds. The sultan looks stony. Then, suddenly, he brightens up.\n\n\"Time to start over,\" he says. \"A very difficult thing to do in a large country, where laws are written by legislative bodies, interpreted by judges, bound by ancient precedents. But this is the Sultanate of Kinakuta and I am the sultan and I say that the law here is to be very simple: total freedom of information. I hereby abdicate all government power over the flow of data across and within my borders. Under no circumstances will any part of this government snoop on information flows, or use its power to in any way restrict such flows. That is the new law of Kinakuta. I invite you gentlemen to make the most of it. Thank you.\"\n\n2. Card \"solitaire\" appears, in the form of a manual cryptographic system that uses only a traditional deck of playing cards, suitable for use when you have no computer. I had heard that a manual card-based cryptographic system was created by computer security specialist Bruce Schneier for the novel, so I was looking forward to a scene with this. And sure enough, there's a good one! (I won't reveal the details.) The book even includes a geeky appendix by Schneier detailing the system.\n\n3. Randy and his friend Avi met playing fantasy role-playing games, and there are some summarized flashback descriptions of this.\n\n4. The 1990s is when collectible card games appeared and became popular, and there is a scene of people playing in a mall food court:\n\nQuote:\n\nNavigating now partly by sound and partly by smell, he comes to the corner where a lot of males, ranging from perhaps ten to forty years old, are seated in small clusters, some extracting quivering chopstick-loads of Szechuan from little white boxes but most fixated on what, from a distance, looks like some kind of paperwork. As backdrop, the ultraviolet maw of a vast game arcade spews digitized and sound-lab-sweetened detonations, whooshes, sonic booms and Gatling farts. But the arcade seems nothing more than a defunct landmark around which has gathered this intense cult of paperwork-hobbyists. A wiry teenager in tight black jeans and a black t-shirt prowls among the tables with the provocative confidence of a pool hustler, a long skinny cardboard box slung over his shoulder like a rifle. \"These are my ethnic group,\" Randy explains in response to the look on Amy’s face. \"Fantasy role-playing gamers. This is Avi and me ten years ago.\"\n\n\"They look like they’re playing cards.\" Amy looks again, and wrinkles her nose. \"Weird cards.\" Amy barges curiously into the middle of a four-nerd game. Almost anywhere else, the appearance of a female with discernible waist among these guys would cause some kind of a stir. Their eyes would at least travel rudely up and down her body. But these guys only think about one thing: the cards in their hands, each contained in a clear plastic sleeve to keep it mint condition, each decorated with a picture of a troll or wizard or some other leaf on the post-Tolkienian evolutionary tree, and printed on the back with elaborate rules. Mentally, these guys are not in a mall on the East Side of greater Seattle. They are on a mountain pass trying to kill each other with edged weapons and numinous fire.\n\nThe young hustler is sizing Randy up as a potential customer. His box is long enough to contain a few hundred cards, and it looks heavy. Randy would not be surprised to learn something depressing about this kid, like that he makes so much money from buying cards low and selling them high that he owns a brand-new Lexus he’s too young to drive.\n\nBut in a larger sense, the cryptographic aspect of World War 2 is a challenging fascinating intellectual high-stakes game! The novel has many scenes concerning the crucial dilemma: if you've broken the enemy's code and can read their messages, how do you make use of this information without revealing to the enemy that you have broken their code? The answer, we see, is a dramatic combination of mathematics, psychology, and daring commando missions to make the enemy believe that you got the information in some other way.\n\nQuote:\n\nWhat if the Americans, in the long run, are just too damn lucky?\n\nAnd how closely can you play that game? A pair of loaded dice that comes up sevens every time is detected in a few throws. A pair that comes up sevens only one percent more frequently than a straight pair is harder to detect—you have to throw the dice many more times in order for your opponent to prove anything.\n\nIf the Nips keep getting ambushed—if they keep finding their own ambushes spoiled—if their merchant ships happen to cross paths with American subs more often than pure probability would suggest—how long until they figure it out?\n\nIt makes me ponder whether a boardgame could some create this sort of situation: each player has a secret code, and each player has to figure out whether their opponent has broken their code...\n\nAnd we see lots of more directly military action in many WW2 locations around the globe! Reading the novel has increased my interest in the Pacific theater, and in German U-boat activity, and more. Games like Return to the Rock: Corregidor, 1945 and Atlantic Chase: The Kriegsmarine Against the Home Fleet 1939-1942 are tempting me for a future wargame order... and I want to revisit Carrier: The Southwest Pacific Campaign – 1942-1943 and Tokyo Express: The Guadalcanal Naval Campaign – 1942, among others.\n\n===\n\nOne thing that bugged me: the novel has a sprawling cast of dozens of interesting varied important male characters, but only one significant active female character! The novel seems to fail the Bechdel test for all practical purposes: I don't recall two female characters talking together (but perhaps there is some minor scene where two women talk about something other than a man).\n\nA minor oddity: the novel is written in the present tense, including the prologue, except for chapter 1, which is in the past tense. I'm not sure what's up with that; I assume it's intentional, but it left me with a strange nagging feeling like \"Did he start writing this in the past tense, then he switched to the present tense, and he forgot to go back and edit the first chapter?\"\n\nThe novel had a few chapters that felt off to me. Hidden here as possible mild-ish spoilers:\n\nSpoiler (click to reveal)\n\nSeveral chapters in the US with Randy and Amy felt awkward and too long. The writing pulled me along great in WW2 action scenes, in math geek scenes, even in venture capital business scenes... but the budding relationship in scenes of Randy's old US life felt clunky to me. And various of several characters' musings about women felt rather naive and hackneyed to me. Writing about sex and love relationships doesn't seem to be Stephenson's strong point, at least not in Cryptonomicon.\n\nThe almost cartoonishly godlike character of General Douglas MacArthur felt clunky and over the top to me.\n\nThe unexpected appearance of Andrew Loeb as an evil villain in the jungle was a kind of bizarre nonsensical surprise and hard to believe.\n\nBut in a 900-page story I enthusiastically read in a mere two weeks, those are arguably mere nitpicks. I am very glad I finally read it, and now I have post-novel melancholy that it's over!\n\nPoll\n\n61 answers\n\nPoll created by russ\n\nMatematiko\n\nestis grava armilo\n\nkontraŭ svastiko.\n\n[+] Dice rolls"
