        "text": "Art Garfunkel famously keeps track of the books he has read since 1968. As of writing this, the count is 1327 (he does not add a review). I thought I could do something similar but I am adding short reviews of books as I read them, and I rake my brain over what I read over the last decades. This is, evidently, a work-in-progress: there are 584 reviews so far. Titles marked with a * are particular favorites.\n\nDouglas Adams: Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\n\n‘We solve the whole case’. Enough said.\n\nJussi Adler-Olsen: Fasandræberne\n\n‘The Absent One’ in the US. Part of a larger series (of which I have read the first 5-6), hugely successful, several movies made, and so on and so forth. Yeah: pro plotting and adequate writing, making an effort to create believable characters. And yet, and yet: nothing here that has not been done before or after by other writers in a more compelling way.\n\nTheodor W. Adorno: Minima Moralia: Reflections From Damaged Life *\n\nMelancholy and poignant, Theodor’s elegantly formulated observations are as relevant now as they were then.\n\nAlain-Fournier: Le Grand Meaulnes *\n\nSomeone congratulate me: I read this in French once! Later, I read it again in Danish to catch what I had missed. So, some will wag their high-brow finger at what is, on the surface, YA kitsch. But it is not: it is a deep and emotional yearning for a time and moment and place that was lost and is perhaps found again, in a different form. If you do not have time for Proust, just read this.\n\nIsabel Allende: The House of the Spirits\n\nA relatively well-written and slightly engaging novel from the second line of Latin American writers. Or, in other words: someone who lacquers a slight coat of exoticism over an otherwise quite bland story.\n\nLisa Alther: Kinflicks\n\nRead it many years ago, and although it is a good story and so I wonder if it would not seem very outdated now? I mean: a lot of the interest was in the slightly racy sexual mores depicted – but that is hardly titillating no more. As a feminist manifesto, it fails, and also as a coming-of-age thing. Just not enough depth, and nothing to compensate for this lack.\n\nKingsley Amis: Lucky Jim\n\nSure, Kingsley is a miserable git, and this book shows it. But it is also quite funny, innit?\n\nBenedict Anderson: Imagined Communities *\n\nClassic and a frontal attack on originalism and nationalism and tradition. Dude: we all be mixed anyway. And the past is truly a different country.\n\nPerry Anderson: Passages From Antiquity To Feudalism *\n\nWhen I read this, I understood what a Marxist form of history writing could and should be (notwithstanding that you can argue specific points).\n\nGeorge Antonius: The Arab Awakening\n\nA groundbreaking study of how bourgeois nationalism began manifesting in the Levant at the end of the 1900s.\n\nMiguel Angel Asturias: El Senor Presidente *\n\nSo many firsts: dictator novel, magic realism. A long hallucination and meditation over what the dictatorship does to people, how the random violence and cruelty, in the long run, do not even need to be enacted anymore, and what circumstance can make somebody break out of all this.\n\nJane Austen: Pride and Prejudice\n\nI guess all that could ever be said has already been said many, many times.\n\nPaul Auster: In the Country of Last Things *\n\nAuster is never really a ray of sunshine, but this one takes the darkness to a whole new level. Chilling and scary and depressing, and in many ways reminiscent of Coetzee’s dystopias.\n\nPaul Auster: Leviathan\n\nComplex, depressing, and utterly Auster.\n\nPaul Auster: Mr. Vertigo\n\nClassic Auster. The man just cannot write a dud.\n\nPaul Auster: The New York Trilogy\n\nThe first Auster I read, and still books very much in his more theoretical phase, and before he starts being more conventionally entertaining. At least some of the writing is headache-inducing, but that is perhaps more a sign of how little challenge most other literature poses now?\n\nFredrik Backman: A Man Called Ove\n\nPerhaps the cutest feel-good book ever? I adore it. The movie is not bad either.\n\nNicholson Baker: Vox\n\nPhone sex? Actually, not ageing well.\n\nHonore de Balzac: Eugenie Grandet *\n\nAh, Balzac. Strange to say that an almost two hundred years old book about somewhat ordinary people can be that exiciting?\n\nHonore de Balzac: Father Goriot *\n\nA very classic and central Balzac. Do not miss. Someday we can discuss if he was a realist or not (I wrote a paper once that argues — pace Adorno — that Balzac was quite a delusional and feverish fabulist).\n\nHonore de Balzac: Lost Illusions *\n\nOh dear: another Balzac for the list and for the favorites.\n\nHerman Bang: De uden Fædreland\n\nPretty much the same comments as for ‘Mikaël’. Almost like listening to a private joke you do not know what is about.\n\nHerman Bang: Haabløse slægter\n\nMost of Bang i very readable, and this one too. But the subject matter is not as interesting as in Stuk, and with being much more personal and oh-so-sensitive, it lacks the same icy-cold gaze upon the follies of greater society. Too maudlin for its own good.\n\nHerman Bang: Mikaël\n\nNot the most shining opus from this writer (who I normally like very well). Kind of a maudlin view of the lives of very sensitive and beautiful artistes who could have it all but instead waste away, suffering from lost loves and broken hearts. Very stiflin.\n\nHerman Bang: Stille eksistenser\n\nSome well-written impressionistic studies of Denmark and the Danish character, including the story Ved Vejen that every schoolkid in Denmark would know (perhaps not anymore?) The pure technical writing skills shown off in these short stories are dazzling; the subject matter perhaps less so.\n\nHerman Bang: Stuk *\n\nOne of the all-time greatest Danish novels. There: I said it. It very, very convincingly weaves through the personal and the societal. with an embedded love story and a colorful – to say the least – gallery of persons. While Band pokes fun at the middle class and clueless wannabes, he also portrays the upper classes to a chilling effect. Actually: most other people, it seems, are not to Bang’s liking. And he sure is uncomfortable with the suddenly nouveau-rich Copenhagen he finds himself in.\n\nHerman Bang: Tine\n\nA quietly naturalistic and impressionistic view of a woman’s life amidst raging war and destruction.\n\nJohn Banville: Snow\n\nBanville now writes crime fiction under his own name, not as Benjamin Black. Perhaps his earlier belief that there is a qualitative gap between real and genre literature has mellowed? In any case, this is as good a crime story as you will ever read. Very atmospheric (he does that part so well) and OMG: the Catholic church is still the boogeyman and then some.\n\nJohn Banville: The Book of Evidence\n\nDefinitely ‘high literature’. Not an easy read and one must ask oneself: once we scrape the layers of highfalutin language away: how much is really left?\n\nBenjamin Barber: Jihad vs McWorld\n\nPerhaps too dualistic and simplistic, but still a decent argument. But the world moves fast, so it is showing its gentle wrinkles here and there.\n\nJulian Barnes: Pedant in the Kitchen\n\nA jolly enough and rather short compilation of what I supposed started as newspaper columns, and all being around and about cookbooks. A subject dear to my heart. I applaud Mr. Barnes’ love of Marcela Hazan; but do not quite understand the reverence for Mme. David. I mean: yes, I also dipped my tooes into Frenc and Italian cooking guided by here, but here is an awful lot of “a handful of this” and “cook until done”. Not very precise, that. Sometimes you wonder if she even cooked some of the recipes first at all.\n\nBrian Barry: Culture & Equality *\n\nTruly a book I started reading and thinking I would find much to object to, and ending it has changed my views of a few things. Frames a vigorous defence of equality and enlightenment, and has little time for identity politics. Of course, it does not seem right now that Barry’s views are exactly the winning ones. But we shall march on, rest assured. There is no alternative.\n\nRoland Barthes: Mythologies\n\nApproachable and occasionally even entertaining essays that are absolutely not in the obtuse tradition of French academic writing. And many light-bulb moments in there.\n\nIsaac Bashevis-Singer: Enemies\n\nStrangely, it got bad reviews, at least in NYT. It has been a long time since reading it, but what I think I remember is the sensuality, the humor, and the unique insights into a culture of which I knew little. And New York: how can a book set in Brooklyn be completely bad?\n\nIsaac Bashevis-Singer: The Magician of Lublin\n\nA surreally strange tale of a culture that is now remote in time, a lost world. One of the Singer’s better, and also recommended if you like something such as The Books of Jacob.\n\nMary Beard: SPQR - A History of Ancient Rome\n\nI have seen Ms Beard live and she does seem a very competent, funny, and engaging historian. This book, however, is slightly disappointing: it is very hard to figure out what the main argument is supposed to be, so in the end, everything is a little hazy, a little off.\n\nFrans G. Bengtsson: The Long Ships\n\nVikings! So very funny. I probably read it when I was 10? Perhaps time for a reread.\n\nJohn Berendt: Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil\n\nVery gossipy entertainment.\n\nVilhelm Bergsøe: Fra Piazza del Popolo\n\nBergsøe was really an entomologist, moved to Italy, became a writer, and wrote this (among a few other things). This is of course over-the-top, heavily romantic, quite old-fashioned, and very entertaining. Being a wildly inventive set of stories-within-stories, it foreshadows Blixen, without the pink hats and affectation. The description of the poorer parts of Copenhagen in the year of the cholera is something else.\n\nLouis De Bernieres: Captain Corelli's Mandolin\n\nI know people are quite critical of this, but if you do not expect high literature and settle for entertainment, I see litle wrong with it.\n\nLaurent Binet: Civilizations\n\nWonderfully inventive alternative history. A few alternate turns, and everything ends up different. It is a riveting read (though a slow part in the middle), but certainly worth it.\n\nHenrik Bjelke: Saturn\n\nIt is one of those things, see: if Bjelke wrote in English or French or even German or Spanish, he would be a major name. Now he is a marginal figure, writing in a minor language. Yet: this book is up there with Beckett or DeLillo or someone else, but maybe better. It is just that for the flash and panache, it is not a book I especially warm to.\n\nBenjamin Black: Christine Falls\n\nJohn Banville’s crime-writing alter ego. Yes: interesting characters, and a grey and chilling portrait of a poorer Dublin, mired in fog and Haute Catholicism. It struck me that it would be rather good as an atmospheric TV series – and it turns out that it is, indeed (although casting the very good Gabriel Byrne as Quirke is quite funny as the Quirke in the book is a bit of a man-mountain). In the end, though, exactly what you would expect from Dublin Noir: not worse, not better.\n\nR. D. Blackmore: Lorna Doone\n\nFast-moving caper that reminds me of Scott or Stevenson. Quite entertaining.\n\nSteen Steensen Blicher: Samlede noveller *\n\nA parson, living in rural Denmark, and a wanderer, visiting remote villages and homesteads. He also wrote fiction and poetry extensively and did a bit of translation. The first Danish short story writer of real significance and master of this medium. His core work of some 20 or 30 stories are masterpieces that can stand up to anything. His worldview is melancholic or even tragic, and his prose introduces forward-looking techniques such as highly unreliable narrators. Even after all the years (he lived from 1782 to 1848) his best stories are as fresh as anything written in Denmark and are genuinely wonderful literature and very readable. No cobwebs here.\n\nKaren Blixen: Last Tales\n\nYou know: I never really bought into the whole Karen Blixen/Isak Dinesen thing – or, as my old Danish teacher who despised her, called her: ‘The Baroness’. But, however reluctant that I am, she did spin some nice yarns and had a weird and vivid imagination. I could probably read more of her stuff if I did now keep hearing Meryl Streep donning her best Swedish-Bulgarian accent in that dreadful movie. This collection is somewhat different from the Gothic Tales, but very much worth it. I hate to admit.\n\nKaren Blixen: Seven Gothic Tales\n\nOf course: the Baroness. The strange flamingo in the Danish porridge. But also uneven, though the highest points are rather high.\n\nAnders Bodelsen: Pengene og livet\n\nBodelsen used to be sneered at for not being ‘modern’ enough, seemingly stuck in an old-fashioned ultrarealism (famously, if his characters took a car ride, he would take this ride and time it so he knew exactly how long it takes IRL). But perhaps hyperrealism is nothing but one aspect of modernism, and although not being academically fashionable, I now tend to think that there are rich pickings here.\n\nJytte Borberg: Eline Bessers læretid\n\nLong time ago. Remember it as well-meaning and pleasant, a sort of historical romance set in the near past. Perhaps a literary version of a solid, positive daytime TV series, but not more than that?\n\nAndy Borowitz: Profiles in Ignorance\n\nEvery paragraph makes you giggle, grunt, or laugh out loud. Or roll on the floor and laugh. Whatever. But I would not expect anything less from Andy Borowitz. That said, if you have followed US news for some time, and have a modicum of historical insight, there is not a whole lot that is new, and there is not really any more profound analysis of the reasons for the epidemic of astonishing ignorance. It is a swift read, though, so perhaps worth it after all?\n\nAnthony Bourdain: Kitchen Confidential\n\nOverwhelmingly honest tale of what it is really like to work in a restaurant kitchen. Strange to see how unorganized some aspects are, how haphazard deciding on menus is; how much coke was snorted. Anthony was a mensch and a fabulous writer and he is sorely, sorely missed.\n\nAnthony Bourdain: Les Halles Cookbook *\n\nAlthough I rarely cook from this book, it is a testament to the great man and a New York that is probably fading away all too fast. Anthony’s New York was gritty and exciting: now the brasserie is gone as well. But he was a fabulous writer in his own way, and this cookbook has much great writing and reflection on things. And photos that perfectly catch the whole vibe. The recipes are OK, a certain style of what he says is not haute cuisine but the food of the little brasserie on the corner where they still do things the old way: you know, the place that we look for, but never quite find.\n\nWilliam Boyd: Stars & Bars\n\nOK funny story about the cultural clashes a stuffed-up limey might encounter when visiting Klan Land.\n\nKarin Boye: Kallocain *\n\nSwedish dystopia written by an inside/outsider that predates Orwell and Huxley while having touchpoints with both. Why has this masterpiece not been made into a movie? On second thoughts: probably well enough that it has not been butchered.\n\nGerald Brennan: The Spanish labyrinth\n\nOld and old-fashioned, but a very strong story of the origins of the civil war in Spain. Fascinatingly, Brennan was a member of the Bloomsbury set. And he could write.\n\nAndre Brink: An Instant in the Wind\n\nI remember it as being good, but I read it in a period when I did read a lot of South African writers, so perhaps my memory is a little blurred. But I do recall that it manages to be political without being preachy, and mainly relying on subtle ways of bringing the point forward.\n\nChris Brookmyre: The Jack Parlabane series\n\nAt least the first two. Did little for me.\n\nBill Browder: Freezing Order\n\nA speedy read, and not much new if you have followed Mr. Browder over the years. Still: if you want to have the names of all the Western enablers of Putin and Russia, look no further. Also worth noticing: German Spiegel found it in their hearts to bombastically claim that Browder’s account of the death of Sergei Magnitsky is “faulty”, but when you look at their claim it is but a minor detail. Even stranger: this is the sort of Russian disinformation that Browder in some detail looks at in the book. Weird.\n\nDan Brown: The Da Vinci Code\n\nCheating here: read 10 pages because somebody I knew was going all gaga over it. I want those minutes of my life back with the interest that is due.\n\nRita Mae Brown: Rubyfruit Jungle\n\nRacy for its time and all that — but basically a quickie without much depth.\n\nP. A. Brunt: Social conflicts in the Roman republic\n\nWonderful and a pleasure to read.\n\nBill Bryson: I'm a Stranger Here Myself - Notes on Returning to America After Twenty Years Away\n\nDarker and slightly more bitter than his other back-to-America book. But trying to be polite and non-political in that very NPR way is stifling in something that could have been a dark omen of the years to come in America. It does not quite get there.\n\nBill Bryson: Notes from a Small Island\n\nThe first Bryson I read, and fun it is. It is absolutely one of his better efforts. The man can surely write: he does not always have subject matter that challenges him enough.\n\nBill Bryson: The Lost Continent - Travels in Small-Town America\n\nThe quest for the lost and forgotten America is epic: will they ever find that town hall square and the church with the spire and the white picket fence? OK, but don’t go out of your way to read it.\n\nBill Bryson: The Road to Little Dribbling\n\nMagnificent title. Good observations about a country slowly being bent out of shape by cars and conservative politics and lack of public transportation and so on and so forth. But not quite: it also has funny placenames and quirky characters, and it is, in the end, still somewhat jolly. Probably not worth reading.\n\nCharles Bukowski: South of No North\n\nDirty old man. Wears it itself out quickly. The transgressions are not transgressive anymore, just slightly awkward.\n\nMikhail Bulgakov: The Master and Margarita *\n\nRead it for the second time recently. Still quite clearly an early clarion call of magical realism. Wonderful imagery of Moscow in the first years after the revolution: still hope, but we can see the darkness creeping in. And an astonishing imagination.\n\nJames Lee Burke: The Neon Rain\n\nSlick and quick, but interesting because of it being set in the swampy swamps of Louisiana.\n\nDino Buzzati: The Tartar Steppe\n\nGood — and many years after reading it I became aware that it is also a central and influential book in the 20th-century canon. But what I found interesting was also that something that is “modern” and “high brow” can also be entertaining and engaging.\n\nAS Byatt: Possession\n\nLiterate and much-lauded, I must say that I did not warm to it as such. Admire it: Yes; read it again: Nah.\n\nRobert Byron: The Road to Oxiana *\n\nA book that has not aged one bit for some 80+ years, and a book that blew the dust off the boring ‘travel book’ genre and create something wonderfully new and fresh and read-worthy. Even if you do plan to travel overland to Transoxiana.\n\nErnest Callenbach: Ecotopia\n\nMeh. Kumbaya new-ageism, and severely dated.\n\nItalo Calvino: If On a Winter's Night a Traveller *\n\nMetafiction at its best. Calvino writes circles around the majority of the younger postmodernists. Very good.\n\nTruman Capote: In Cold Blood\n\nI found it exciting when I read it as a teenager, but thinking about it now I can see that perhaps there are a number of issues with the thing.\n\nPeter Carey: Oscar and Lucinda *\n\nCarey said, interestingly enough, that when he writes a “historical” novel, he writes the story first and only then researches (and changes what then must be changed). I had not thought about that before, but have (I realize) read a few books where the author did a lot of research and (Goddammit!) it will be fitted into this book. To hell with the story! Carey is the diametrical opposite. A wonderful book.\n\nAlejo Carpentier: Explosion in a Cathedral *\n\nOr, rightfully ‘The Age of Enlightenment’. A wonderful book about revolution, enlightenment, terror, love, Europe and Latin America, and much more.\n\nAlejo Carpentier: Reasons of State\n\nA very philosophical book – but, alas, I don’t really recall many details.\n\nAlejo Carpentier: The Lost Steps\n\nExciting and exotic, Carpentier utilizes his musicological background, in a story that takes us deep into the jungle, and the past.\n\nCaleb Carr: The Alienist\n\nThrilling and well-researched, and an accurate, fictional (!) portrait of New York anno dazumal.\n\nCaleb Carr: The Angel of Darkness\n\nMore of same, but somehow less successful.\n\nE. H. Carr: What Is History?\n\nPrescribed reading at uni. Reviled by the very-very-lefty M/Ls in the day: leafed through it recently to find it cogent and well-written.\n\nMatthew Carr: The Devils of Cardona\n\nWell-researched historical crime fiction set in a Spain where we find the inquisition as well as secret Moslems. As good — or even better — than a lot of this sort of book, and as I did not know a whole lot about this period it was also factually interesting.\n\nJohn le Carre: A Legacy of Spies\n\nDiving deep into the past, it retells the stuff in ‘Spy Who In from the Cold’ from new angles, and we get a deeper understanding of the duplicity and cruelty of intelligence operations. It shows a by-now ancient writer at the heights of his powers.\n\nJohn le Carre: A Perfect Spy\n\nAs always, Le Carre shows that genre is not important: this is a fantastic book, whatever genre it might be.\n\nJohn le Carre: Our Game\n\nOf the later Le Carre this one is perhaps the wildest and most traditionally exciting.\n\nJohn le Carre: Our Kind of Traitor\n\nThis solved the old question: what would le Carré do once the state that Karla worked for disappeared? Fear not: turns out that the ensuing kleptocracy gives as much material. One could only wonder what inspired the currently ongoing war in Ukraine would have given him? Meanwhile: this is yet another wonderful read.\n\nJohn le Carre: Silverview\n\nThe last, alas. And, for once, perhaps not completely up to snuff? The old spies finally face a world that has lost its lustre. Perhaps le Carré did so as well? (But even a middling le Carré is much better that the output of the other 99%).\n\nJohn le Carre: Smiley's People\n\nA classic Smiley. The Master does not make duds.\n\nJohn le Carre: The Constant Gardener\n\nYet another from the master. But not among the very best, I think.\n\nJohn le Carre: The Honourable Schoolboy\n\nActually, quite a while since I read it. I suppose it was OK?\n\nJohn le Carre: The Night Manager\n\nLe Carré doing what he does, and managing to sketch out a post-cold war plot that is still engaging. And, oh: le Carré does not much like the English establishment, does he?\n\nJohn le Carre: The Russia House\n\nIn the top echelon of La Carre output.\n\nJohn le Carre: The Spy Who Came in from the Cold *\n\nIs any Le Carre more classic? Hard to not see the movie as you read it, though.\n\nJohn le Carre: The Tailor of Panama\n\nYes, more satire than usual and influenced my Our Man in Havana. I am not so sure I really like this version of Le Carre.\n\nJohn le Carre: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\n\nVery classic. I think I saw the TV series with Alec Guinness way before reading the book. Still. the book, of course, has time and space for many more nuances.\n\nRaymond Carver: Where I Am Calling From\n\nMuch lauded and immensely influential for a certain generation and group of Danish writers, I actually find that watching paint dry would be a better use of my time.\n\nSteve Cavanagh: Eddie Flynn\n\nThe series (most of). Seemed at first to be a reasonably interesting series with some new angles on the American judicial system and so forth. But in the longer run, yet another kind hearted-but-troubled attorney/detective that (and this is an irritating thing) turns out to be quite the improbable action hero? Jeez, Louise.\n\nMiguel de Cervantes: Don Quixote\n\nFun story: I went to the local library to get this book when I was quite young, and the rather maternal librarienne refused to let me take it out unless I could pronounce the title correctly. So — a nice yarn it turned out to be. Some would say the first (European) novel, and that is probably also almost the case.\n\nMichael Chabon: The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay *\n\nChabon is an exquisitely professional writer that actually can apply his skills to very different subjects. So this is about the Holocaust, comics, magic, FBI, McCarthyism, and it is very good.\n\nMichael Chabon: The mysteries of Pittsburgh\n\nThe early Chabon was still a writer-in-learning but this narrative of lust and sexual ambiguity does show us that here is a new dude we might want to keep an eye on.\n\nMichael Chabon: The Yiddish Policemens Union\n\nWhat kind of warped mind came up with this mad plot and such a richly detailed alternative history? Chabon is a true pro who puts his considerable skills to many different genres. Perhaps, though, less gripping than, say, Kavalier and Clay as we always know it is a sort-of fantasy. Still.\n\nRaymond Chandler: The Long Goodbye\n\nAll Chandler is worth reading, so it follows that this is, too.\n\nDavid Chang: Momofuku *\n\nAnother cookbook that in words and photos (and food) catches a specific moment in time of a New York that we can now only mourn for as we walk past the boarded-up stores, the frozen yoghurt emporia, and the latest Gucci shop. David Chang is a fine writer in the Anthony Bourdain-school of writing, and the recipes are quite approachable and bang full of flavor.\n\nJung Chang: Wild Swans\n\nA harsh but necessary tale. If this cannot cure you of fascination with Stalinism-Maoism, then what can? To even imagine this shit happened in my own lifetime, and that many, many people in the West that knew better directly or indirectly helped cover it up?\n\nBruce Chatwin : The Songlines\n\nWonderful and mysterious and surely worth reading.\n\nBruce Chatwin: Utz\n\nA strange one about a porcelain collector. Well: not strange, but good. But strange considering Chatwin’s other books.\n\nBruce Chatwin: What Am I Doing Here\n\nDamn good essays. ‘Gone to Patagonia’ indeed.\n\nG K Chesterton: The Man Who Was Thursday\n\nNot particularly funny or good or well written.\n\nInger Christensen: Digte (Det, Alfabet, Sommefugledalen) *\n\nFrom a ‘collected poems’, the three central collections Ms Christensen published: Det (‘It’), Alfabet, and Sommerfugledalen (‘The Butterfly Valley’) are, hands down, the pinnacle of Danish poetry, and should have made her a Nobel prize winner. Alas, that never happened.\n\nWalter Christmas: Peder Most (multiple)\n\nYeehaw, sailors! Adventures galore! Fiction for YA was really something else back then. That was not always a good thing.\n\nEleanor Clark: The Oysters of Locmariaquer *\n\nA fascinating book that is quite sui generis, or perhaps just invents a whole new genre? In some ways, it stands quite alone, but there are vague connections to something like The Road to Oxiana.\n\nSusanna Clarke: Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell *\n\nImagination, skills, research, fantasy galore: this is one heck of a book. Perhaps it really is this the best English fantasy since Tolkien? Who am I to tell? Entertaining, but it actually does make you think, too.\n\nSusanna Clarke: Piranesi *\n\nAs the follow-up to her major breakthrough with Norrell and Strange, this book was not only very long in the making: it is also utterly, utterly different. Perhaps even different from most other books you have read? You only slowly realize what it is even all about, and then something makes you change that perception. As intellectual endeavour and novel writing, this is very, very highly ranked and recommended.\n\nJonathan Coe: Rotters' Club, The Closed Circle, Middle England\n\nA broad sweep of English history of the last few decades, as seen through the prism of a small, and a somewhat oddball group of friends. Coe is an excellent writer and juggles between the comical and the deadly serious. But the books do lose steam along the way, and the characters are, in the end, not that captivating.\n\nJonathan Coe: The Terrible Privacy of Maxwell Sim\n\nA strange and wonderful idea this, and well executed, but perhaps the technique and the deft writing help hide that in the end, it is just not that interesting? Although it has many moments, not the least the relationship with the GPS voice.\n\nJ M Coetzee: Age of Iron\n\n“Previously insulated from racial hatred, Mrs Cullen starts to realize that her neat little white world doesn’t match the reality of police brutality against black people.” One of Coetzee’s best books, and an especially forbidding and hard read. “Children of iron, I thought. Florence herself, too, not unlike iron.”\n\nJ M Coetzee: In the Heart of the Country\n\nA very early Coetzee, and quite different. If this was the first of his books you picked, you might not go any further.\n\nJ M Coetzee: Life & times of Michael K.\n\nAn eerie and wonderful book, taking s through the world as experienced by an innocent and slow person. Things happen to Michael that he does not understand why happen, and yet he pushes on and perhaps finally gains freedom?\n\nJ M Coetzee: Waiting for the Barbarians\n\nConfusing that the plot is more-or-less the same, in general terms, as in Dino Buzzati's The Tartar Steppe. But only so much that if you read Buzzati, you vaguely make the connection. Not that it matters. This is a more mature, still subtle, but immensely powerful Coetzee, who, as ever, talks about the politics of this world without talking about the politics of this world.\n\nLeonard Cohen: Beautiful Losers\n\nActually, as time has gone by, this seems to be a highly regarded novel. Perhaps I should read it again? I guess I expected something else back then: something more like the romantic singer’s songs.\n\nLeonard Cohen: Favourite Game\n\nVaguely remember this. Artists, starving, sex, and so on, I think.\n\nWilkie Collins: The Moonstone\n\nWonderfully entertaning Gothic crime caper.\n\nWilkie Collins: The Woman in White\n\nAlso wonderfully entertaining Gothic crime caper.\n\nMichael Connelly: Harry Bosch, the series\n\nYes: I guess I read the whole lot (and saw the TV series — which, as it happens, diverge in subtle ways). While on one side, Harry Bosch is the quintessential troubled detective, he has many other layers and is in no way as one-dimensional as some of the brethren. Well-made plots, gritty streets, and jazz.\n\nJohn Connolly: Charlie Parker series\n\nOne of the more “literary“crime writers, and this is a very long series of which I have but read the first few. Mixes a noir thriller with the paranormal, and does create visions that are actually very scary — but as the books progress, it also becomes clear that the underlying (and somewhat monotonous) theme is Catholic guilt.\n\nJoseph Conrad: Lord Jim\n\nYes, an adequate book, but besides Nostromo, I have never really been able to figure out why Conrad is held in such high esteem.\n\nJoseph Conrad: Nostromo *\n\nWonderful and multifaceted book about revolutions and capitalism and unlikely heroes and the Latin American reality. And a very thrilling read, and entertaining while still “literature”.\n\nJoseph Conrad: The Secret Agent\n\nFunny enough (and better than Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday), but let us be clear: this is not peak Conrad.\n\nAlan Cooper: The Inmates Are Running the Asylum\n\nFYI: the ‘inmates’ are the techies and developers who are allowed to not only develop but also design all the interfaces we encounter in our daily life. Cooper calls them out.\n\nJames Fenimore Cooper: Deerslayer\n\nAt the very least got me interested in finding out more out the actual wild indians.\n\nJames Fenimore Cooper: The Last of the Mohicans\n\nWonderful. Said 10-year-old Henning.\n\nPatricia Cornwell: Scarpetta\n\nThe Scarpetta books (I have read a few) are nice (1) because they have a female protagonist, (2) the forensic details are exact, (3) there is no three?. In fact, they are pretty boring in the long run.\n\nJim Crace: Arcadia *\n\nJim Crace is one of my favourite authors, and this is a major opus. He may be “old-fashioned” as much as he is certainly not a post-modernist but firmly rooted in the grand historical tradition of narratology. Tant pis if he did not get the meme about the end of the grand narrative: every book of his, one way or the other, proves that narrative, grand or petit, is very much alive and doing very well indeed. That his politics are close to mine is just another bonus. The subject of this book is, in its own way, the original accumulation, the rise of capitalism, the temporal and physical divide between rural production and late capitalism, and on and on. But it is, first of all, a very good story, and in no way a political pamphlet.\n\nJim Crace: Being Dead\n\nDeath, bereavement, afterlife (but not religious). A late work in the Crace canon, and a more introverted voice. As always: recommended, highly.\n\nJim Crace: Continent\n\nHis debut. In his own words: “a novel in stories about an invented continent struggling with the dislocations of progress”. Also: one of those books a budding writer would read and then say “Why did I not think of that?” And also: yet another book where Crace manages to say something historically and politically in an artistic way with zero preaching.\n\nJim Crace: Quarantine\n\nCrace never really disappoints, but this is not his best effort: the metaphors perhaps a tad too heavyhanded, the landscape visited by other authors, et cetera. But such is Crace’s skills and positions that that said, this is still a better-than-average book.\n\nJim Crace: Signals of Distress\n\nCrace never lets you down, even if — as it seems to me to be the case with this one — the inspiration was not at peak level here.\n\nJim Crace: The Gift of Stones *\n\nYet again: Crace uses a precise historical moment —- the end of the Neolithic —- to weave a tale around social upheaval and change. He said himself that it could be a metaphor for Blighty under the rule of That Woman. But that is not even important to know for reading the book.\n\nJohn Crowley: Little, Big\n\nA big favorite of Harold Bloom’s, surprisingly. I am torn, but will perhaps give it another try, one fine day.\n\nKjell Ola Dahl: The Lazarus Solution\n\nWonderful and atmospheric and of course quite obvious: a spy and cloak-and-dagger story set among exiled Norwegians in Stockholm during WWII. They all have their agendas, and our ‘hero’ is not always sober … This is a book that just beckons to become a TV series.\n\nJ. M. Dalgliesh: Dark Yorkshire\n\nI have read #1, The Divided House and #2, Blacklight, so far. Pure Yorkshire noir, with all the bells and whistles: a tired, jaded detective with drink & woman trouble; heart of gold, though; solves the crime. But the environment is interesting, there are twists and turns, and an OK way to spend a few rainy afternoons. Now: is there any dark and rainy place left that does not have its own Noir subgenre?\n\nWill Dean: A Tuva Moodyson Mystery\n\nThree of them: Dark Pines; Red Snow; Black River. So, an Englishman sets stories about a deaf, queer journalist in a Swedish smalltown in the middle of exactly nowhere, with pitch-black nights and icy cold winters and a cavalcade of sinister and nefarious criminals? Know what: it works.\n\nWill Dean: Bad Apples\n\nStrangely disapponting after the first three that I found excellent. For one thing: so many red herrings thar are just abandoned (if you show a gun in the first act …) And so many pages describing a tense situation that is quite similar to one in a previous instalment. And ending on a cliffhanger, almost like your typical TV series episode: stay tuned? Is the missing second half of this story coming out soon, perhaps?\n\nWill Dean: Wolf Pack\n\nBetter than the previous installment, but perhaps we are entering a phase where only so much can happen in this Godforsaken town, and the characters only have so much more to give us (barring introducing something new next time. If there is to be a next time).\n\nDaniel Defoe: The Life and Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe\n\nA good story, but so much more. Really: this touches upon so many aspects of the genesis of capitalism, et cetera, that perhaps the fact that it is a good story is lost?\n\nLen Deighton: The Ipcress File\n\nWhile Deighton is not in general — and not by me — held in the same lofty esteem as Le Carré is, there is no denying that he is a writer who can create believable characters, and grand story arcs, and have you turning ages with some alacrity right until the end.\n\nSven Delblanc: Hedebysviten\n\nA long time ago, but remember the books as being quite difficult, but rewarding enough that I finished all of them. Maybe time for a revisit?\n\nSven Delblanc: Speranza\n\nTackles big issues, such as slavery and freedom and personal responsibility. Strangely enough, it was made into a movie, while I thought that this was quite introverted and cerebral and not another action story. It reminds me, in degrees, of Carpentier’s magnificent Explosion in a Cathedral.\n\nDon DeLillo: Underworld\n\nThe shot heard around the world… Yes, very American and very basebally. As a non-American I am sure I miss something and do not fully grasp all the cultural references. But writing this — and looking it up on Wikipedia — it occurs to me that maybe I should read it again?\n\nMichael Dibdin: Ratking\n\nThe first of a series. Aurelio Zen is a different kind of detective and all-around Italian mother’s boy. The plot is spicy and exciting, and perhaps I should seek out some of the following volumes?\n\nPhilip K. Dick: The Man in the High Castle\n\nActually, the premise is great and wonderful, but it peters out and does not live to what it could have been.\n\nCharles Dickens: A Tale of Two Cities\n\nSwaahbucklingly good yarn, and quite an outlier in the oeuvre. This could have been, say, from the pen of Walter Scott, could it not? Or is it, gosh, a kissing cousin of the Red Pimpernel? Still. A nice light entertainment.\n\nCharles Dickens: A Tale of Two Cities\n\nInterestingly, for being so relatively late in the Dickensian oeuvre, this novel is straight-up historical fiction, and could well have been written by somebody else. But as it stands, it is really fast-moving entertainment,\n\nCharles Dickens: Bleak House *\n\nBleak, indeed. Not exactly your cosy Pickwick-Dickens. Convoluted and almost impossible to fully get a grip on — but that does not matter, after all: the essence is the dystopian and dismal world it paints a grey picture of. Not so Jolly England. And, also, one could and would argue that it is a precursor of the postmodern novel (calling Thomas Pynchon). Mutatis mutandis, of course.\n\nCharles Dickens: David Copperfield *\n\nDickens somewhere between the comedic and the serious: and therefore exactly in the perfect spot.\n\nCharles Dickens: Great Expectations *\n\nA favorite among the many Dickensian faves.\n\nAnnie Dillard: Living by Fiction\n\nActually, and for once: although Dillard’s prose is exquisite and her ideas interesting: in the end, I didn’t see where we were going, so I stopped going. I read 50% and decided that I could use that energy on something else. A shame, probably, but at times you have to be realistic.\n\nE L Doctorow: Billy Bathgate\n\nDoctorow sure does take a lot of flack, but I remember rather liking this historical-factual yarn. But perhaps there is some truth to the observation that he tends to use his literary skills as cover for stories that are, essentially, banal and sentimental?\n\nE L Doctorow: Loon Lake\n\nThe Kirkus Review said: “Imagine a fair-to-good novel by Kurt Vonnegut in his more socio-economic, Mr. Rosewater-ish vein. Then imagine that it’s been scrambled, weighed down with self-conscious prose, and avant-garded up (Joycean) run-ons, blank verse, skewed tenses and pronouns) by someone intent on making a literary impression. That, unfortunately, is the general effect of this artful but lifeless picaresque novel – which follows the crossing 1936 paths of a very young vagabond and a somewhat older failed-poet, both of whom love a tormented beauty and both of whom wind up under the wing of a great tycoon.” Seems about right.\n\nE L Doctorow: The Waterworks\n\nIf you have to mix history and fiction, this is a valid way to do it. While picturing a squalid and corrupt New York (no nostalgia here), and adding a feverishly mad medical plot, Doctorow creates a very readable story.\n\nE L Doctorow: World's Fair\n\nDoctorow, quasi-historical: well done, will not rock your world.\n\nJosé Donoso: A House in the Country\n\nMore from the Chilean second-line Latin Americanism. Made no lasting impression.\n\nFyodor Dostoevsky: Crime and Punishment *\n\nOne of those books that could change your life when you read it. At least your literary life.\n\nFyodor Dostoevsky: The Brothers Karamazov *\n\nDon’t know: only read it twice. Still growing on me.\n\nFyodor Dostoevsky: The Idiot\n\nYet another massive missive from the depth of the Russian darkness.\n\nScott von Doviak: Lowdown Road\n\nA quick-paced, ruthlessly and shockingly violent road story. And very entertaining, not missing a beat, and never a dull moment. OK read for an otherwise boring afternoon, but so not high litt.\n\nArthur Conan Doyle: The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\n\nClassic, entertaining, and actually well written.\n\nRoddy Doyle: Barrytown Pentalogy\n\nAll except the last one. They are, obviously, cinematically entertaining.\n\nJette Drewsen: Midtvejsfester\n\nSolid neorealism from a feminst perspective. Nothing that makes the Earth move as such (but that is true of almost the whole genre). Essentially, much ado about the woes of the middle classes.\n\nJette Drewsen: Tid og Sted\n\nSolid neorealism from a feminist perspective. Nothing that makes the Earth move as such (but that is true of almost the whole genre). Essentially, much ado about the woes of the middle classes.\n\nAndre Dubus III: House of Sand and Fog\n\nSo, so much better than the movie version.\n\nAlexandre Dumas: The Count of Monte Cristo\n\nAh, yes. More adventures and hi jinx, and so much more intelligent than most of what is published in this genre these days.\n\nAlexandre Dumas: The Three Musketeers\n\nYay: action, dangerous ladies, swashbuckling camaraderie, horses … what is not to like? Seriously: the majority of present-day action thriller writers could learn a lot here. A lot.\n\nLawrence Durrell: The Alexandria Quartet\n\nPretentious, moi? But if you forgot the pseudo-intellectual framework around this, it is actually not a bad story and an interesting glimpse of a still-Hellenistic world that is now utterly gone.\n\nUmberto Eco: Foucault's Pendulum\n\nOverwrought? Not as good as the Name of the Rose.\n\nUmberto Eco: The Name of the Rose\n\nOf course, it is a fabulous book with many different levels of meaning. The movie probably makes people think it is less than it is.\n\nBarbara Ehrenreich: Nickel and Dimed - On (Not) Getting By in America *\n\nShe walks the walk: living on minimum wage for a year with no backup or cheats. It paints a depressing portrait of a supposedly wealthy country that just does not give an f*** about anybody or anything.\n\nJakob Ejersbo: The African trilogy\n\nVery much hyped so I just had to read it. And? Meh. This is the thing: even if the basic story is riveting (it is not, not completely), the setting interesting (sure: Africa comes through as interesting as an already read Sunday paper), the language could be inventive and poetic (this is fairly mundane), the book could still be somewhat worthwhile. But this: not really, not for me. However much it was hyped, for any number of reasons, not least that the author died heroically young.\n\nT. S. Eliot: Waste Land and Other Poems\n\nBesides Mr Eliot’s political and social positions, his poetry is both challenging and worthwhile. I guess the days when you would carry a copy around to earn points (when I bought it at the Uni bookshop, the clerk snickered …) but it does not change that what Eliot created is a bit of a monument in European poetry.\n\nBret Easton Ellis: American Psycho\n\nYo. I always thought it was mostly about a very unreliable narrator, a clear narcissist and perhaps more, and the murder scenes (and the very graphic sex) were fantasies of his? To the degree that it is also a story about the excesses of Wall Street and such, it does make points but does not throw any punches because it is set in a social and mental and political vacuum.\n\nJames Ellroy: The first LA quartet *\n\nSure, Elllroy is a big dick-swinging loony and so — but he is also a very good writer when it suits him. This major work is, on the surface, a crime story but in reality more like that great American contemporary novel that everybody else either wants to write or says can no longer be written. Ellroy does not care: he wrote it.\n\nMichael Ende: The Neverending Story\n\nWell: I am too old for it now — but I liked it way back when. I don’t think my boys did, though. Times change.\n\nOtto English: Fake History\n\nYes, it is both informational, and funny, and it has a bite (Otto does not think Boris is the new Churchill — but then again: Winston was not all that, either). Perhaps it is sometimes too rambling, and some of the fake histories he has picked out are perhaps not overly interesting nor are they all equally grave. But the idea that whoever controls the narrative about the past controls the future gets some good foundations here. Hesitatingly recommended for your reading pleasure.\n\nHans Magnus Enzensberger: Europe, Europe: Forays Into a Continent\n\nVersatile novelist/poet/cultural critic wrote a light-hearted collection of essays about various European countries. As a Dane, it of course amused me that he describes Norway as a ‘living open-air museum’.\n\nHans Magnus Enzensberger: Forsvindingens Furie\n\nPoetry from German writer, polemicist, public intellectual, and much more. There are gems here, but not a book I pick up that often.\n\nInge Eriksen: Victoria og verdensrevolutionen\n\nKitsch and very, very outdated. Oui, oui: the incredibly sexy revolutionary hero (a he! no less) saves the day and the world and the heroine. Talk about socialism from the top.\n\nCarit Etlar: Dronningens Vagtmester\n\nRetro action, not very historically correct, not PC, way too long — but I read it when I was in bed for a week at age 11 and it made me pass the time. Would not recommend it, though.\n\nCarit Etlar: Gjøngehøvdingen\n\nRetro action, not very historically correct, not PC, way too long — but I read it when I was in bed for a week at age 11 and it made me pass the time. Would not recommend it, though.\n\nJ. G. Farrell: The Empire Trilogy *\n\nAs historical (well: recent history) fiction goes, this is fantastic. The three novels share themes and most of all share a healthy scepticism about the British empire.\n\nElena Ferrante: The Neapolitan Novels\n\nOh, dear. I must confess: I only finished the first volume. I don’t know why it does not grip as it is supposed to as it really should have a lot going for it. Perhaps this is that rare instance where I should give the TV adaptation a try? Addendum: the HBO series is all that and then some. Up there with the best TV I’ve ever seen.\n\nM. I. Finley: The Ancient Economy\n\nA very well-written and rather heavy reading. I think I recall. Long time, no see.\n\nPalle Fischer: Den store badedag\n\nMuch like ‘Mine hornorkestre’, not the modernistic Palle but the folksy and anecdotal one. A bittersweet — and maybe autobiographical — story of life in the lower classes of Copenhagen anno dazumal, but shows the solidarity and joys of like with little else but a tight-knit family. Also made into a reasonably entertaining movie.\n\nPalle Fischer: Kuffertlandskab\n\nThis, then, is the early Fischer, and much more modernistic and ‘literary’. Perhaps even an overlooked masterpiece?\n\nPalle Fischer: Mine hornorkestre *\n\nMy old school teacher. He was the showboating kind of teacher, always good for an anecdote. Many of the ones are in here, and they are still good. Oh: he could write, by the way.\n\nPalle Fischer: Skal vi gifte os med Miss Simpson?\n\nThe debut, and definitely ‘literature’. Don’t remember it too well: perhaps time for a reread (if it can be found second-hand or something).\n\nMark Fisher: Capitalist Realism *\n\nA remarkable book from a remarkable person. A political manifesto and melancholy gaze at our predicament.\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald: Bernice Bobs Her Hair\n\nFitzgerald’s shorts are good, but he remains, to me, a better novelist.\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald: Tender is the Night *\n\nThe glamour, the ennui, the fall … I have always thought this is at the very least the equivalent of Gatsby. Of course, it is not exactly social realism, but would it all have to be that?\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald: The Beautiful and Damned\n\nAlthough he is often thought to be a one-trick pony, I do find that a lot of the lesser-regarded works are quite beautiful and sad.\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald: The Great Gatsby *\n\nAlways been in awe of the writing, the sadness, the ennui, of how FSF caught the zeit geist.\n\nGustave Flaubert: Madame Bovary *\n\nWhy a story about a neurotic woman stuck in the sticks still fascinates is hard to explain in but a few words. But there it is: as hypnotic now as it was then.\n\nBent Flyvbjerg: How big things get done\n\nI must say this: ‘This a very well-written book’. Also, I must say that I had high expectations. And, finally, it is a bit of a letdown. Sure, the author pounds his chest and keeps telling us how clever he is with projects – but he never really gets into detail. Planning good, yeah yeah. Gehry good, yeah yeah. And ad nauseam. Actually, I do not doubt that Mr Flyvbjerg does have a lot of information that is clever and useful, but he somehow fails to tell what it really is. Perhaps a lack of planning?\n\nFrederick Forsyth: The Day of the Jackal\n\nWell. Fast-moving, violence, sex.\n\nKristian Bang Foss: Manden der bar solen\n\nA fascinating novel, especially for a historian like myself. Set around the late bronze age collapse, and uses what little we can know about this remote period (no written sources) quite faithfully (of course, a lot of stuff has to be imagined). You could probably argue that the events unfolding here could also be seen as a commentary on the present day — but if so, it is mainly in the selection of the subject matter, not in the execution thereof. I think I will read more from this author who is that rare bird in Danish literature that uses his considerable skills to write novels with wildly differing themes (as opposed to, say, reiterating his own fiction over and over again).\n\nJohn Fowles: Daniel Martin\n\nDisappointing. I know Fowles likes to try his hand at different genres, but this one is not really engaging.\n\nJohn Fowles: The Ebony Tower\n\nCarefully crafted and interrelated stories. A pity that few of the characters are somebody you would actually want to hang out with.\n\nJohn Fowles: The French Lieutenant's Woman\n\nThe perennially postmodern metafiction. Or something. Probably overrated.\n\nJohn Fowles: The Magus\n\nBoring, overwrought, and lacking any redeeming features. Very much a child of its time, and now seems antiquated when it tries to be edgy. Sad.\n\nMichael Frayn: Spies\n\nPlayful, wistful look back at innocence and the loss thereof, and a really and genuinely surprising twist at the end.\n\nNeil Gaiman: American Gods *\n\nI don’t really like comics and sci.fi or fantasy. I like this one, though. A strange and weird story, but ends up being quite gripping, even with the slightly off-kilter and not realistic ensemble of characters.\n\nNeil Gaiman: Neverwhere\n\nWonderful thought experiment: what an angel actually does live under the Angel tube station. And so on and so forth. Very entertaining, and also worth noting that the idea of a parallel world in our midst is predating Harry Potter and Susanna Clarke.\n\nWilliam Golding: Lord of the Flies\n\nJunior high reading. But the crux of the matter is that the book is way too pessimistic: the few real-life instances of a similar situation have shown that we are actually not atavistic sadists but rather kind and altruistic.\n\nWilliam Golding: The Spire\n\nBoring. Paint drying is a better use of your time.\n\nWilliam Goldman: Marathon Man\n\nOk: but in this case, the movie is probably better.\n\nMeïr Aron Goldschmidt: Arvingen\n\nOne of the more interesting Danish mid-19th-century writers. Not only an outsider because of his Jewish background, but also because he did develop a habit of sticking it to the man in his satirical writings. This, however, is one of his more outlandish efforts, a true forerunner of Blixen, and even – dare I say? – some shades of magical realism? Very entertaining.\n\nMeïr Aron Goldschmidt: Ravnen\n\nThis is an absolutely wonderful, crazy, and entertaining story, more related to Blixen that I would care to admit. It is one on those things: had Goldschmidt been writing in, say, English, he would be quite well-known even today. Alas, he did not.\n\nStephen Jay Gould: The Mismeasure of Man\n\nThe scientist as a blisteringly hot polemicist, quite brutally taking down a whole genre of pseudoscientific racist mumbo-jumbo. They don’t make them like Stephen Jay anymore.\n\nSue Grafton: A is for Alibi\n\nGuilty as charged: I read a few of the Milhone alphabeticals. Airport lit if there ever was. Not really written for posterity (although casting a woman as a hardboiled detective is, of course, refreshing. But hardly original.)\n\nGünter Grass: Cat and Mouse\n\nI read it when I was too young to understand it: it seemed to be a plain story about some kids diving — but it is probably a lot more. Perhaps time for a reread?\n\nGünter Grass: The Flounder\n\nWonderful magic realism.\n\nGünter Grass: The Tin Drum *\n\nHard to decide which Grass is the better — but I dare say it is probably this. Who can ever forget the wee Oskar?\n\nRobert Graves: I, Claudius\n\nIt is, still, very funny and entertaining — but do keep in mind that it is ‘historical fiction’ and not ‘history’.\n\nA. C. Grayling: The Meaning of Things\n\nA light and thought-provoking collection of short, sharp takes on a lot of central concepts of our existence. But, alas, people will rather read, say, Jordan Peterson as he gives the answers you want: Grayling just wants to make you think for yourself.\n\nGraham Greene: Brighton Rock\n\nGreene’s books are all different I guess, and this early one is also one of the first I read. Lots of Catholic guilt and glimpses of a now very distant England.\n\nGraham Greene: Our Man In Havana\n\nVersatile scribe does a comedic spy thriller. It is, actually, entertaining.\n\nGraham Greene: The Quiet American\n\nYou would think that a 1950s novel about American policy in South East Asia is dated — and you would be wrong. Uncannily precise about the failed and failing politics the USofA has pursued in the region, always tone-deaf to the hilt.\n\nJohn Grisham: The Firm\n\nQuick and entertaining but skin deep.\n\nJohn Grisham: The Pelican Brief\n\nLight legal entertainment.\n\nJohn Grisham: The Rainmaker\n\nLight legal action.\n\nJohn Grisham: The Runaway Jury\n\nSlick legal action. But it does have a fantastic plot twist that I doubt anybody could see coming.\n\nDavid Guterson: Snow Falling on Cedars *\n\nOy. A prose so mellow and misty that you can smell the trees and feel the rain and the melancholy. And a riveting story line.\n\nH. Rider Haggard: King Solomon's Mines\n\nExciting if you are 10; has a funny racist and/or imperialist smell later. Kipling, at least, is a better writer, if you must.\n\nAlex Haley: Roots\n\nDuh. Was riveting when I was a wee one and read it, but later (as I am a historian) tickled by why Haley insists it is based on ‘facts’ when it is clearly not (and has no reason to be). Odd.\n\nDashiell Hammett: The Maltese Falcon\n\nStylistically, Hammett is a master and much more than pulp fiction, hard-boiled hack. Like Simenon, he is a bleakly modernistic writer if you care to look closely.\n\nKnut Hamsun : Hunger *\n\nHamsun’s major work, as far as I am concerned. A feverish look at the life of a struggling artist.\n\nPeter Handke: A Sorrow Beyond Dreams\n\nYes, yes: Handke is currently persona non grata. This, though, is heart-breakingly sad and true.\n\nPeter Handke: Short Letter, Long Farewell\n\nA Western, of sorts, but still in the early phase of Handke. Somehow same mood as in the Alice in the Cities movie.\n\nMartin A. Hansen: Løgneren\n\nSome hail this as a major work post-WWII, and it even was made into a movie. From my point of view, it is a piece of sanctimonious handwringing and awfully dated.\n\nMartin A. Hansen: Lykkelige Kristoffer\n\nOn the surface, it is a historical novel, but in reality, it is an allegory of modern times (or what have you), and not particularly good in any capacity.\n\nThorkild Hansen: Arabia Felix - The Danish Expedition of 1761-1767 *\n\nThis is a fantastic historical novel. True: it is in the guise of a historical monography, but the author is not a historian, and you can poke a few holes in it. But as ‘fiction’ it works marvellously, and Mr Hansen was a very talented writer.\n\nThorkild Hansen: The Slave Trilogy\n\nTorn here: what is this, even? Mostly, people seem to think it is some sort of nonfiction, historical monograph. Although the writer did some research, a historian he was not. So if we take it as entertainment, it is passable. But one thing remains: damn, he could write Danish prose as smooth and fluid as almost no one else. Doesn’t save the books as such.\n\nYuval Noah Hariri: Sapiens\n\nYikes. Libertarian hogwash being sold to the same people who believe Malcolm Gladwell is ‘deep’. Sad. Also so full of holes that you could rip every-single-page apart with a modest effort.\n\nJonathan Harr: A Civil Action\n\nReally good legal/courtroom drama, based on real events. Creates, for a change, a very positive image of a lawyer!\n\nRobert Harris: Archangel\n\nHarris does historical fiction, and then also alternative history. This is a what-if: what if Stalin had a son that was sequestered away? And what if sinister forces want him foisted upon the world? Now that I consider it again: perhaps it is not as far-fetched as it seemed to be when it was first published?\n\nRobert Harris: Fatherland\n\nMarvellously well done alternate history,\n\nThomas Harris: Red Dragon\n\nScary and such. But pulp, basically,\n\nThomas Harris: The Silence of the Lambs\n\nYes: very, very scary. But, in the end, what for? What do we learn here, if anything?\n\nWolfgang Fritz Haug: Kritik der Warenästhetik\n\nWas a revelation all those years ago: using Marxist methodology to write something that is actually contemporary and engaging. Wonder how it holds up today?\n\nPaula Hawkins: A Slow Fire Burning\n\nDarker and more convoluted than the train girl, and a tour de force of a number of unreliable narrators, protagonists, and witnesses. Let’s us look into a dark and seedy London, where very little is exactly what it seems.\n\nPaula Hawkins: The Girl on the Train\n\nPerhaps even the title is a cliche now, but the book was actually interesting enough as a crime novel and a quick read. Actually, it is a notch up from your bog standard cozy crime stories.\n\nWilliam Heinesen: De fortabte spillemænd *\n\nThe Lost Musicians in English translation. This Faroese larger-than-life author wrote quite a few good books, but this takes the crown. All revolving around the joy of music, the not-joy of established religion, boze, and friendship. And a fabulously good yarn as well as stylistic pleasure.\n\nHelle Helle: Rødby - Puttgarden\n\nExcellent neorealism as it should be done. Even though Ms Helle graduated from the dubious Forfatterskolen, her prose is not closing in on itself and there are plenty of radiators in her protagonists’ dreary surroundings.\n\nAgnes Heller: The Theory of Need in Marx\n\nA difficult text that probably could stand to be read again. I was, after all, just too young and unknowing to get the most out of it. Is it important, still? A Kantian Marxism?\n\nJoseph Heller: Catch-22 *\n\nShould be required reading. So powerful.\n\nJoseph Heller: Closing Time\n\nA less slapstick and a more despairing sequel to Catch-22. So now we finally know what happened to Milo etc.\n\nJoseph Heller: Good as Gold\n\nJoseph Heller:\n\n“Once when Gold was visiting in Florida, his father drew him across the street just to meet some friends and introduced him by saying,“This is my son’s brother. The one that never amounted to much.” Oy, veh. A very hilarious American Jewish book. I always thought that Gold was more than a little inspired by Kissinger, but I may be wrong.\n\nJoseph Heller: Something Happened\n\nA chilling view of the emptiness of corporate life.\n\nMark Helprin: Winter's Tale *\n\nLittle did I know when I first read this that I am not supposed to like Mark Helprin: he was, after all, a speech writer for Reagan ad is also very, very pro-Israel. Not things that get you a lot of cred with the popular crowd, and add to the fact that it seems to me that his output is quite uneven. Nevertheless, nevertheless: this book is a triumph of magical realism (yes!) and a deep love for New York. Approved.\n\nErnest Hemingway: A Farewell To Arms\n\nLike The Bells, a romantic war story, written by a still young person. The optimism, even under the circumstances, is adorable.\n\nErnest Hemingway: A Moveable Feast *\n\nA lifelong fascination of mine with Paree possibly started with reading this. Although this Paris is long, long gone.\n\nErnest Hemingway: For Whom The Bell Tolls\n\nIf you read it at a certain age, there is so much romance. Perhaps too much if you read it later — and too little about the canvas where it all unfolds.\n\nErnest Hemingway: The Snows of Kilimanjaro and Other Stories\n\nPapa doing what he does.\n\nErnest Hemingway: The Sun Also Rises *\n\nI guess, then, that this is the Hemingway you grow up to appreciate. Oh, the ennui, the hidden wound. The world has lost its color.\n\nMick Herron: Bad Actors\n\nOf course, there is a lot of loud farting involved when Jackson Lamb and his motley crew of slow horses show up. Nevertheless, as always a fantastic read and an interesting plot – and you are left with the feeling that Mr. Herron has quite a dislike for Mssrs. Cummings and Johnson, no?\n\nMick Herron: Slough House\n\nWhat is not to love about a farting, vulgar spy master partly in disgrace and surrounded by a number of misfits and fiascos? And make it dark comedy, please? This is very entertaining and certainly worth it, and now also a TV series, it seems.\n\nMick Herron: The secret hours\n\nNot a Slow Horses story but we do catch an early glimpse of ever-farting Jackson Lamb, and we learn parts of other Slow Horse characters’ distant past. This is closer to La Carré, partly because of the Berlin setting and partly because you can never really trust anyone, can you now? Herron can do little wrong, it seems, so highly recommended. If this is your sort of reading.\n\nCarl Hiaasen: Squeeze Me\n\nStandard Hiaasen: funny, odd, Florida. And it is about Trump and his ardent, elderly supporters (Pussies for POTUS). And it is a fun, quick read on a lazy summer day when you happen to be housebound with a sore back (and a G&T at the ready). The ultimate fast food of crime stories. Not that that is a bad thing: we can all use some fast food occasionally.\n\nPatricia Highsmith: The Talented Mr Ripley\n\nWhere high-brow meets crime. She is a fabulous writer, and Tom Ripley is one complex character.\n\nOscar Hijuelos: The Mambo Kings\n\nSex, mambo, sex, booze, sex. And so on.\n\nNathan Hill: The Nix\n\nOne of those books where can only say: why did I not think about writing something like this?\n\nTony Hillerman: Leaphorn-Chee series\n\nActually a great series: unusual setting, nice, interesting detectives that we care about, not dependent on gratuitous violence for plot.\n\nChester Himes: A Rage in Harlem\n\nThe exploits of Coffin Ed Johnson and Gravedigger Jones are wildly entertaining, and the portrait of New York from a black POV is relevant and refreshing.\n\nAngelo Hjort: De fædrelandsløse\n\nPart of a series of both fun and serious yarns about Denmark during WWII as those events unfolded in a Copenhagen working class environment.\n\nAngelo Hjort: Den sovende by\n\nPart of a series of both fun and serious yarns about Denmark during WWII as those events unfolded in a Copenhagen working class environment.\n\nAngelo Hjort: Patrioterne\n\nPart of a series of both fun and serious yarns about Denmark during WWII as those events unfolded in a Copenhagen working-class environment.\n\nHomer: The Iliad\n\nDragged us through this in high school. Am eternally grateful, though.\n\nHomer: The Odyssey\n\nDragged us through this in high school. Am eternally grateful, though.\n\nNck Hornby: High Fidelity\n\nQuitely wonderful with a quirky cast of nerds that do nerdy things. And fall in love and listen to music. Perhaps not even in that order. The movie where the menagerie is set up in Chicago is fine, too, but not exactly as fine.\n\nPeter Høeg: Fortællinger om natten\n\nAmazing that few – if any – critics saw this for what it was: a remake of Karen Blixen’s Gothic Tales. I mean: the signs are right there, in the book, in your face. It does seem to be Høeg’s M.O. this rewriting of older literature. No straight-up copying, but also somewhat shady.\n\nPeter Høeg: Miss Smilla\n\nYikes. A runaway, bona fide Danish success, made into a movie and all, and here I am, not liking it particularly? A middling crime story that wants to be something more, much more, so we call upon, say, a Greenlandic woman and claim that she has a closer connection with nature and the universe … anyway: I lost interest. Also, for being so supposedly well-researched, it helped spread the false myth about Eskimo words for snow. See: just too facile, using that debunked myth to further the basically essentialist message.\n\nPeter Høeg: Miss Smilla's Feeling For Snow\n\nI have to beg to differ: this is not a very good book. Entertaining and fast, and having all the ‘correct opinions’ about this and that — it still is bog standard and not nearly as intelligent as itself (and large parts of the reading public) would like to believe. No depth, really. I see that Høeg is somewhere being compared to Dan Brown. He would probably not like this, but there’s a thought.\n\nPeterr Høeg: Forestilling om det tyvende århundrede\n\nCute and clever pastiche of magical realism, some might even say a pastiche of Marquez himself.\n\nPeer Hultberg: Præludier\n\nSomething about Chopin as a child and so on, in Hultberg’s trademark refined, aesthetic universe. No appeal to me, though.\n\nPeer Hultberg: Requiem\n\nOh, dear. Highbrow as it comes, very refined and cultural. Dare I also say pointless and boring?\n\nAndres Michael Hurley: The Loney\n\nGothic, Catholic, definitely weird and different. Well worth it.\n\nAldous Huxley: Brave New World\n\nOf course. That and 1984 were hard to avoid back in high school.\n\nFlorian Illies: 1913\n\nSounds all so promising, but in the end, it is just a collection of factoids that are never really put together in any meaningful way.\n\nArnaldur Indridason: Reykjavik Murder Mystery\n\nAlso known as the Detective Erlendur series. I read them all (there are more available in Danish than in English). Said detective is about as far from you modern action man as can be, but he is a thoughtful but very lonely person, alienated from his more-or-less dysfunctional family. Iceland Noir indeed: a bleak, dark, and cold landscape, full of strange and perhaps supernatural beings, and an overarching theme of reconciling the distant past and your own impending death. For what little that actually happens, strangely fascinating, perhaps because the writing is so very good.\n\nB. S. Ingemann: rik Menveds barndom\n\nHuh? I read that? Seriously?\n\nB. S. Ingemann: Valdemar Seier\n\nHuh? I read that? Seriously?\n\nJohn Irving: A Prayer for Owen Meany\n\nExcellent and entertaining but we would not expect anything less from this writer. However, while it has the makings of a Great American Novel, it is, perhaps, a little bit too schmaltzy and predictable? But a nice, long and never-boring read for winter nights.\n\nJohn Irving: The cider house rules\n\nWhat a wonderful, humane, and ultimately morally complex story. Irving does really can create believable characters when he wants to, and Dickensian-scale stories. Not hi-brow, I guess, but to-my-mind probably a finer read than some that pretend to be.\n\nKazuo Ishiguro: The Remains of the Day\n\nI guess we all saw the movie, but the book is also quietly fascinating.\n\nJ. P. Jacobsen: Digte og Udkast *\n\nPoems, for of course a writer such as Jakobsen would write a couple of the best novels, the best short stories, and for completeness’ sake: the best poems in the Danish language, and then die of tuberculosis.\n\nJ. P. Jacobsen: Fru Marie Grubbe\n\nJ. P. wrote a seminal Bildungsroman with his ‘Niels Lyhne’. Here, you could claim he created a feminist book with one of the first strong female characters in Danish literature. And Marie also goes through a sort of journey, although it is all downhill. Or is it? Does she save her soul, doing what she does? The jury is still out.\n\nJ. P. Jacobsen: Mogens og andre Noveller\n\nMost Danish school kids were (then, but still?) pestered with having to read one or more of these short stories. Some of those kids would later realize just how good this writing is.\n\nJ. P. Jacobsen: Niels Lyhne *\n\nThis is probably Jakobsen’s best. The writing is languidly colourful and even erotic, and the theme of this Bildungsroman is typically Danish for this era: decay rather than growth.\n\nRoy Jacobsen: Just a Mother\n\nA fourth instalment in the series where little happens and yet everything happens. Led by Ingrid Barrøy, it is, most of all, a feminist epic about the Norway that was and the Norway that is becoming. Electricity! Who would have thought it possible? The stoicism of the islanders when facing unspeakable tragedy is really something, as well as the slow, deep thoughts of Ingrid who, for sure, never rushes to decisions, but decides she does, in the end. A triumph of a series of books.\n\nRoy Jacobsen: The Unseen *\n\nNorwegian trilogy (De usynlige, Hvitt hav, Rigels øyne), read in Danish (and apparently only volume one in English so far). Not a lot happens, except that everything happens. Set on a small, wind-swept and poor island off the coast of Nothern Norway in the years before, under, and after WWII. A society almost outside the modern world, and — interestingly — inhabited by strong and strong-willed women as the men tend to disappear and die on the ocean. Wonderful, and I was reminded of this from Hugh MacDiarmid’s poem ‘Island Funeral’: “While this thing lasted / It was pure and very strong.” A poem that is also about a seemingly uneventful life on a remote island, but a life that has a deeper meaning than we can easily understand today.\n\nC L R James: The Black Jacobins *\n\nOpened my eyes to C L R James and the fact that you can be a sports fan and a revolutionary at the same time. And a well-written monograph about a both uplifting and shameful episode in Caribean as well as European history.\n\nHenry James: Portrait of a Lady\n\nSlow going. Some books, perhaps, do not age well? Or perhaps I am an insensitive brute.\n\nP. D. James: A Taste for Death\n\nAnother Dalgliesh worth reading.\n\nP. D. James: Devices and Desires\n\nClassic Dalgliesh. Slow, literary, polite, and all mind games.\n\nP. D. James: Shroud for a Nightingale\n\nDetached, cool Adam Dalgliesh solves a crime. James is a wonderful writer, and Dalgliesh a welcome and different kind of detective.\n\nP. D. James: The Children of Men\n\nIf you only know P. D. James as the creator of Adam Dalgliesh, this is certain to surprise you. A dystopian fantasy that is chillingly realistic.\n\nP.D. James: Cover Her Face\n\nStylish, as always, and a quietly disturbing and meticulous plot. But, perhaps, this being the first Dalglieeh instalment, James has not yet found her own ways and broken free of the English manor house murder mystery tradition.\n\nErik Aalbæk Jensen: Perleporten\n\nHonest, slow-moving realism, set in the outskirts of Denmark and meticulously mapping how time changes everything. The writing is distinct, accomplished, and beautiful. And the writer is all but forgotten and this kind of literature left in a dusty corner. A shame, really.\n\nJohannes V. Jensen: Digte 1906 *\n\nA seminal collection of poetry, blasting in the new century and never looking back. Alas, but for writing in our minority language, some of these poems would be counted among the best in the early waves of modernism. Now, only us Danes get to enjoy. And we do.\n\nJohannes V. Jensen: Himmerlandshistorier *\n\nSo: Nobel prize winner Jensen wrote novels, poetry, and short stories — a man for all seasons, especially as he created a masterpiece in each genre. These short stories are at the same time local and realistic, and at the same time outside of normal time and space, existing in a mythical Denmark that never was exactly that way — but could very well have been. His prose is remarkable: it has rhythm and drive and is crystal clear. You want to read some of these sentences out loud.\n\nJohannes V. Jensen: Kongens Fald *\n\nA high-water mark in Danish literature. In the guise of a historical novel (probably not over-researched) taken as a somewhat harsh verdict on some specific parts of ‘Danish character* — but most of all, it is a precise and wonderfully written story, no matter what is also is.\n\nJerome K. Jerome: Three Men in a Boat\n\nHahaha. Wonderful.\n\nJames Joyce: A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\n\nDear me: as a realist or naturalist, Mr Joyce shows a remarkable technique.\n\nJames Joyce: Ulysses\n\nA monument, and quite funny (if you allow it to be). But for some reason, I could never really warm to it.\n\nRichard Kadrey: The Grand Dark *\n\nNot otherwise reading Kadrey as his normal genre is outside my circle of interest, this, however, is something else: a nightmarish alternate history/fantasy set in a Mitteleuropa drenched in fog and darkness and drugs and secret police and treason — all of this, and then some. Sort-of a territory that is occupied by Mieville’s Perdido Street Station, but much more restrained, and a happy-sad ending that resolves nothing but gives the protagonists a flick of hope. One senses that it is not going to last. Oh, also: a rather effective demonstration of the power of the Hero’s Journey pattern.\n\nFranz Kafka: The Castle *\n\nFeverishly nightmarish and claustrophobic and a shot across the bow for 20th century litt.\n\nFranz Kafka: The Trial\n\nOf course, it is fabulous — but for me, personally, I find The Castle a notch better.\n\nChristian Kampmann:: Gregersen-sagaen\n\nStraightforward realism, telling the story of a middle-class family in the 1970s where new ways of living are coming to the fore. A huge success, saleswise, but the chosen subjects perhaps merely show how parochial a certain form of upper-middle-class living is, and does not quite make the mark as literature, being almost comically simple prose (without giving us any reasons to believe that there is a deeper plan behind this).\n\nErich Kästner: Emil and the Detectives\n\nIt was very exciting when I read it at age, oh…: 9?\n\nJohn Keats: Poems\n\nNot all of them, of course. But the great hits.\n\nDaniel Kehlmann: Tyll *\n\nI wrote a longer review of this, but, briefly, this (and perhaps also Wolf Hall) are what any historical fiction should strive to be.\n\nGarrison Keillor: Lake Wobegon Days\n\nHomey and anecdotal, just like an old-timey radio show. OK: well-written, but in the end … perhaps a lot of empty calories?\n\nGarrison Keillor: Leaving Home\n\nShort, sharp, and witty texts from the Wobegon universe. Funny that a man who can write so lovingly apparently was a bit of an arse in real life.\n\nLars Kepler: The Hypnotist\n\nInitially, I was positive, but the violence is just too exaggerated.\n\nJack Kerouac: Desolation Angels\n\nWild and romantic, but it seems to me as if Kerouac’s star is fading with each year that goes by.\n\nJack Kerouac: On the Road *\n\nThorn about this: yes, reading it at a young age is certainly inspiring and such. In the long run and as literature alone: well… Still, for that first impression, it gets to be a favorite.\n\nPhilip Kerr: Bernard Gunther, the series\n\nAs historical fiction goes, splendid. Kerr obviously researched a bit. The early parts, the ones I have read, show more insight into the Third Reich than many other more ‘historical’ histories.\n\nKen Kesey: Sometimes a Great Notion\n\nA big old epic, but rather strange that the beatnik dude wrote a story that is, basically, anti-union libertarianism. Or perhaps not strange at all.\n\nHarald Kidde: Helten\n\nYikes: hailed a ‘central novel in the Danish canon’, but while this is maybe true, it is also an awfully pious and treacly book. There is absolutely no distance between the author and his sanctimonious hero — if a hero is what Mr. Bek is—certainly a bore.\n\nStephen King: Billy Summers\n\nYay. King with a straight-up, non-paranormal thriller. And it is not a chilling portrait of an America that has lost its way completely? Say what you will about King — and I don’t like many, or even most, of his books — he is a mercurially gifted writer and storyteller and moral voice.\n\nStephen King: It\n\nYikes. Never have been able to look at clowns quite the same way again.\n\nStephen King: The Stand\n\nIt tried very hard, and it almost succeeds. But it is very long — too long — and sentimental, and gets carried away with itself. Borderline if worth spending the time on.\n\nStephen King: The Tommyknockers\n\nOK for a wee scare, and also: King, as always, manages to poke some fun at authoritarians and other assorted nitwits.\n\nBarbara Kingsolver: Demon Copperhead *\n\nI have had Barbara Kingsolver recommended to me several times, but never really got into her writing. This, however, grabs you (or me, at least) by the throat on the first page and never lets you go. In her chosen Dickensian tradition, it manages to be a grim coming-of-age story and a stark and angry exposé of the Oxy disaster hitting some of the most vulnerable communities in the USA. The designed disaster, that is (as nurse June says: ‘They did this to us’). Kingsolver loves her people and their region but does not hide any of the flaws and weaknesses. Almost as an aside: no, this is a pamphlet. It is literature of the highest order, with a language that is flowing and beautiful. It is a monumental achievement, and of course, it is a favorite.\n\nRudyard Kipling: Kim\n\nI think that when I was very young and innocent, I read this twice or so and found it to be probably the most exciting story I ever read! Of course, I later learned that Kipling was a very naughty imperialist and should be avoided at all cost, and I should probably somehow rinse myself of this experience. Still, though: it remains a fabulous yarn, give or take.\n\nH. D. F. Kitto: The Greeks *\n\nThe writing is as clear as the water from a cool mountain spring on a hot summer day. ‘Popular history’ writing does not come any better than this.\n\nHeinrich von Kleist: Michael Kohlhaas\n\nOh, dear. He brought down the whole state, did he not?\n\nJean Hanff Korelitz: The Plot\n\nWidely successful and very well written at the ‘technical level’. It pulls off a plot within a plot and keeps you on edge (although, I must add, I guessed the second plot resolution quite early). That said, I also feel that it is more a metaliterary exercise and quite cerebral than a heartfelt story. Nothing is wrong with that, but you do not end up having many feelings about the characters who are mainly moved around like pawns in a chess game. For all the psychological aspects, we do not know anything about the characters.\n\nJohannes Krause: A Short History of Humanity\n\nA nice and not too technical walkthrough of recent progress in using DNA in archaeology and anthropology and thus widening our idea of where we came from significantly. Well written, and with a lot of humour that the stereotype says Germans do not have? Makes you wonder what Mr Krause’s DNA shows and whether he is really German?\n\nTom Kristensen: Hærværk *\n\nOr ‘Havoc’ in English, into which it has been translated. The intro from NYRB: “A longtime cult classic in Denmark, this novel about dissolution and despair has been out of print in the US for over eighty years until now.\n\nOle Jastrau is the very model of an enterprising and ambitious young man of letters, poised on the brink of what is sure to be a distinguished career as a critic. In fact, he is teetering on the brink of an emotional and moral abyss. Bored with his beautiful wife and chafing at the burdens of fatherhood, disdainful of the commercialism and political opportunism of the newspaper he works for, he feels more and more that his life lacks meaning. He flirts with Catholicism and flirts with Communism, but somehow he doesn’t have the makings of a true believer. Then he takes up with the bottle, a truly meaningful relationship. “Slowly and quietly,” he intends to go to the dogs.\n\nJastrau’s romance with self-destruction will take him through all the circles of hell. The process will be anything but slow and quiet.”\n\nAll true.\n\nTom Kristensen: Livets arabesk\n\nRather strange but very entertaining. A Copenhagen right after WWI, full of anarchists and communists and police and upheaval and losing focus and aim. In some ways, clearly a forerunner for ‘Havoc’, but in a less realistic setting and with much more avant-garde ambitions linguistically. Does it get all the way? Perhaps not. Worth trying, though.\n\nMilan Kundera: The Unbearable Lightness of Being\n\nA masterpiece, of course, and made into a very good movie (although the movie does not replicate everything in the book faithfully).\n\nHari Kunzru: Red Pill\n\nI wrote a longer review of this somewhere else here: in short, not overwhelmed.\n\nHanif Kureishi: The Buddha of Suburbia\n\nYes: funny, frothy entertainment. Kureishi has done much better.\n\nJens Lapidus: Stockholm Noir\n\nNah: much flash and violence; not enough meat.\n\nPhilip Larkin: Collected Poems *\n\nRight. Larkin was a miserable misogynist, a racist, a drunk, and a general nuisance. He was, however, also the one who wrote some of the best English poems of that century, poems that manage to straddle the fine line between being generally popular and, actually, being ‘high literature’.\n\nStieg Larsson: The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest; The Girl Who Played With Fire; The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\n\nWell done, well researched, intereresting characters – but they are just a tad too black-and-white. The plots are something else, though.\n\nPalle Lauring: Borger Alexandre\n\nLightweight historical yarn, not meant as YA but is perhaps best viewed as such.\n\nPalle Lauring: Den gyldne gren\n\nLightweight historical yarn, not meant as YA but is perhaps best viewed as such.\n\nPalle Lauring: I Denne Nat\n\nDanish historian (well: at least a ‘popular historian’ on TV) wrote an OK historical novel.\n\nPalle Lauring: I denne nat\n\nLightweight historical yarn, not meant as YA but is perhaps best viewed as such.\n\nPalle Lauring: Vitellius\n\nLightweight historical yarn, not meant as YA but is perhaps best viewed as such.\n\nD. H. Lawrence: Lady Chatterley's Lover\n\nHaha: found out when I was a young ‘un that my parents has this, but that it was somewhat hidden on the shelf. What a disappointment to find out that the much-talked-about sex scenes are quite unexciting and not very graphical.\n\nHalldor Laxness: Iceland's Bell *\n\nIf you have to write “historical fiction”, do it as Halldor did. Does not get much better than this.\n\nUrsula Le Guin: Earthsea 1-3\n\nProbably YA, but enough depth to be read at all ages.\n\nUrsula Le Guin: Malafrena\n\nOf all Le Guin, I think I like this the best. She applies her powerful fantasy to a sort-of historical fiction, set in a sort-of Slovenia, set in sort-of revolutionary times. And the result is great.\n\nUrsula Le Guin: The Dispossessed\n\nA scifi that even I can accept — perhaps also because Le Guin is that rare beast: a leftist scifi, and not a libertarian nutter.\n\nElmore Leonard: Get Shorty\n\nAs always: hi jinx and hilariousness and fast moves. Not bad at all.\n\nElmore Leonard: LaBrava\n\nFast moving, fun. As always,\n\nJonathan Lethem: Fortress of Solitude *\n\nSome of Lethem’s oeuvre is cartoonish for my taste, but this strikes a perfect balance of the fantastical, the historical, the sociological, and much else. And a story of a deep and enduring friendship.\n\nJonathan Lethem: Motherless Brooklyn\n\nGood, but not as good as Fortress of Solitude.\n\nJonathan Lethem: You Don't Love Me Yet\n\nAlternative musical comedy and a sharp portrait of certain aspects of counter-cultural existence. But not overly serious.\n\nPrimo Levi: Survival in Auschwitz *\n\nThere is not much more to say than: do read it.\n\nKelvin Lindemann: En aften i koleraåret\n\nThis one has a lot of context: published under an alias, it is a pastiche of the divine baroness Blixen and somehow manages to be a rather good book while at the same mocking the baroness quite a bit. That was not kosher in 1950s Denmark, where Blixen was a heroine to large parts of the literati and the glitterati. Lindemann was, otherwise, a solid novelist who in the early parts of his career wrote engaging stories, based on fine research, and started being much more experimental later. You could, tentatively, say he was a Danish cousin of someone like Golding. But, alas: his faux pas caused him to be dismissed and forgotten, and (sadly) this only made his far-right political opinions more bitterly hard. He was a good writer, though.\n\nAstrid Lindgren: Den Store Emil Bog\n\nWhat to say? Classic.\n\nDavid Lodge: The Campus Trilogy\n\nYes, the campus trilogy. Very funny, and early stabs at the woke fellow-travellers, you might say.\n\nFederico Garcia Lorca: De døde har vinger af mos *\n\nSelected poems from the ultimate master in excellent Danish. There is so much to wonder at here.\n\nAlexander MacCall Smith: The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series (the first 8-9)\n\nSo cute, So very cute.\n\nClare Mackintosh: The last party\n\nWelsh Noir, maybe? Cunningly close to the ‘cozy thriller’ genre, but then again: not. There is the Agatha Christie-aspect: a closed room (well: a closed community), and just about everybody is lying and scheming. Who to trust when even the cops seem to have secrets they would rather not have be known? Solid entertainment.\n\nAlistair MacLean: Guns of Navarone\n\nSure. Don’t judge: I was young. He can spin a story and create a plot, though.\n\nAlistair MacLean: Where Eagles Dare\n\nSure. Don’t judge: I was young. He can spin a story and create a plot, though.\n\nKenan Malik: Not so black and white: A history of race from white supremacy to identity politics\n\nI don’t know if Kenan Malik is still associated with the Spiked crowd. Sad if he is. But in this and in his previous books, he certainly does not seem to be contaminated by that viral strain. What he does is to keep focus on the important dichotomy in Western political thought: universalism versus identitarianism. He manages to explain some of the reasons for the rather confusing critique of the Enlightenment that came from Adorno and Horkheimer after WWII, a tradition that could be seen as one that pervades leftist thought in the West after 1960 or so. This is an opening to a world full of mumno-jumbo and identity politics. Malik sticks with universalism and even mentions that elephant in the room: class and the class struggle. A very good read (if only because it confirmed my own prejudices and helped make my own thoughts about some current events much clearer).\n\nIvan Malinowski: Vinterens HjerteVinterens Hjerte\n\nWonder poems that manage to be poetic and political without either aspect having the upper hand.\n\nHector Malot: Sans famille\n\nI was howling when I read this at 10 or so.\n\nHenning Mankell: The Wallander series *\n\nHard not to see this as a magnum opus in Scandi litt – and not just crime stories. The most beautiful thing is that Wallanders grows and ages and changes his views. As people do, but fictional characters do not always.\n\nThomas Mann: Buddenbrooks\n\nEssential reading. Especially here in the North.\n\nThomas Mann: Thomas Mann\n\nOh, so elegiac and beautiful. And almost as deep as the beauty of a Swedish teen. Nevermind.\n\nHilary Mantel: Wolf Hall trilogy *\n\nIndeed worthy multiple prize winners. Historical fiction and probably quite well researched —- but Ms Mantel’s genius stroke is to make those centuries-old characters alive and modern without betraying their remoteness and the fact that lived in a much more savage time. Amazing it is that you haste through the story to see where it is going when you do know exactly where that is the whole time.\n\nDavid Mark: DS Aector McAvoy\n\nI read some of the series. Interesting characters: the Highland detective hooks up with the sexy Gipsy girl. Reasonable plots and twists, and thankfully free of some of the worn-out cliches that the genre encourages. So: somewhat recommended, but not exactly essential reading.\n\nGabriel Garcia Marquez: Love in the Time of Cholera\n\nNot the very best, vintage Marquez, but he is a writer that does not make many mistakes. Perhaps, though, this is leaning a bit towards the more facile Latin American literature of a, say, Isabel Allende.\n\nGabriel Garcia Marquez: No One Writes to the Colonel and Other Stories\n\nHas much of the late autumn sadness that 100 years has. The end of something, the new yet to appear. But not for the colonel, of course.\n\nGabriel Garcia Marquez: One Hundred Years of Solitude *\n\nThe first “serious” novel that knocked me off my feet. Must have read it tree times or so? Never forget the ice cream, nor when you are older and ‘wiser’ and see the circular structure and that perhaps the revolution eats its own children, in the end? It is still a monument of literature.\n\nGabriel Garcia Marquez: The Autumn of the Patriarch\n\nA darker, more moribund mood than in the exuberantly colourful major opus.\n\nGabriel Garcia Marquez: The General in His Labyrinth\n\nA late entry in the Latin American caudillo canon. OK, but not more than that.\n\nPeter May: The Enzo Files\n\nThe whole bunch of them. Enzo Macleod is a lovely and loveable, but flawed, character. May, however, is too good a writer to make Enzo a mere cliche. And Enzo gets older and frail. And there are wonderful descriptions of life in France which is always a plus for an old Francophile such as I. It is also a bonus that the forensic science involved is realistically described.\n\nPeter May: The Lewis Trilogy\n\nAtmospheric and strange, the story leads us into a premodern world we hardly knew still existed.\n\nAlexander Mccall Smith: Espresso Tales\n\nCute: he does have a knack. Also skewers certain, ahem, styles of new-age parenting.\n\nAlexander Mccall Smith: The World According to Bertie\n\nBertie is one cute and funny sax player.\n\nCormac McCarthy: Blood Meridian *\n\nQuite possibly the single most terrifying novel I have read. Perhaps you can understand a lot about the American mind and the propensity for violence from reading it? It is, of course, utterly nihilistic and pointless what happens, but it stays with you for a long time.\n\nCormac McCarthy: Border Trilogy\n\nI definitely remember reading All the Pretty Horses, but am in doubt about reading the two other tomes. I don’t think I did. I guess the writing is supposed to be a virtuosic stylistic experiment? Nevertheless, I should probably return one day and give it all another try. Or maybe not.\n\nCormac McCarthy: No Country for Old Men\n\nThe book and the movie are equally morbidly scary.\n\nVal McDermid: 1979 & 1989\n\nThe latest two books seem to start a new series from the master of Tartan Noir. Relatively little outright violence and gore, so many more close observations of Great Britain and the media industry and the changing mores and attitudes. And, also, Ms McDermid really does not like Robert Maxwell and his daughter. Really not.\n\nIan McEwan: Black Dogs\n\nI saw it got reasonable reviews while I found it unfocused and — in the end — not very catchy.\n\nPatrick McGrath: Spider *\n\nPerhaps the most unreliably unreliable narrator like for ever? Chiling and scary, and a masterpiece of plot and of language.\n\nJon McGregor: Reservoir 13\n\nThis is brilliant. The stereotypical mystery: cute, blond girl disappears. Many suspects. Tension. And yet, and yet: that is not the point, at all. Wonderful.\n\nJakob Mchangama: Free Speech\n\nA well-written comprehensive overview of the history and status of free speech, depicting the ups and downs. Perhaps weaker towards the end where we reach modern times, and there is not enough discussion about identity politics, cancel culture, illiberal subcultures, and so forth (debates in which the writer otherwise gets publicly involved in). Recommended, though.\n\nLiam McIlvanney: The heretic\n\nThis is a very good book. Young Liam is clearly his father’s son, but while the literary standard is the same, Liam adds more action, believable action, and even more dark psychological insight. Top of the Tartan Noir.\n\nLiam McIlvanney: The quaker\n\nPerhaps as good a writer as the father, maybe also different. The style is more straightforward and does reach the contemplative depths and tortured philosophy of the old man, making it all faster and more approachable (sort of like how Ian Rankin is clearly an heir of the older McIlvanney but also quicker and different.) Anyway: a story inspired by a real-life serial killer roaming the streets of a Glasgow that is still dark and dangerous, and in the midst of it all: the good old boys and the new kid on the block, only that the new arrival has dark secrets he would rather not his fellow officers knew about.\n\nWilliam McIlvanney: Laidlaw *\n\nThe original tartan noir, and what a start. Although Sjöwall and Wahlöö had already started the saga of Martin Beck, this must be one of the first crime books where the detection itself is not as important as the societal comments. In this sense, the crime/detective/police procedural of this ilk becomes the contemporary literature, filling out the space left behind by ‘serious writers’. Not that this is not serious, or not ‘high literature’. McIlvanney’s prose is lyrical and gritty and tormented and can stand its ground.\n\nWilliam McIlvanney: Strange Loyalties\n\nRemarkably, the crime and the solving of it are not central here: but a crime there was, and a long time ago. The detection lies in finding out about the crime and what it did to the parties involved, and in the process realize that you never really know someone, even your brother. Laidlaw finds out a lot about himself, the world, and the elusive love. In fact, perhaps he finds out that it is not possible, for him. Yet another triumph of Scottish writing – no, this is not ‘genre’. It is literature, period. And if not pigeonholed as ‘crime’, perhaps even more widely acknowledged as modern literature of the highest order.\n\nWilliam McIlvanney: The Papers of Tony Veitch\n\nAs the Laidlaw books progress, there is more and more introspection and emphasis on the duality of the Scottish character, and also on difficult questions about good and evil, or the caring and the merely indifferent. Much later, Harry Bosch has the tagline: either everybody counts, or nobody does. It comes from here, from Jack Laidlaw.\n\nWiliam McIlvanney and Ian Rankin: : The Dark Remains\n\nConfusingly, this is based on a script left behind and is sometimes touted as “Laidlaw’s first case” — which it is not. But it is a case earlier in the timeline that in the three Laidlaw books McIlvanney finished. So: how is it then? Well: Ian Rankin is probably not the worst person to finish a script by his idol, but you can also see some differences from the regular Laidlaws. Here, there are less of the philosophical musings and more straightforward police procedural. But that is OK: when McIlvanney sadly could not finish this himself, we still do get a valuable addition to the canon. A good read for the Tartan Noir devotees among us.\n\nAdrian McKinty: Sean Duffy books\n\nI read the series so far (the first six books). It is a wonderful setup: a Catholic member of the RUC, living in a heavily Proddy neighbourhood. Trouble is bound to occur. And also a perfect setting for social commentary, as the Troubles are present in the background and occasionally take centre stage. Shameful that this series did not become McKinty’s breakthrough as it has a lot more to tell than your cosy village murder caper does.\n\nAdrian McKinty: The Chain\n\nSadly — well, not really but still — this and not the Sean Duffy books became McKinty’s big break, including the ever-important American market, and the elusive movie contract. Not that it is a bad book, and it does have a really, really exciting plot and plot twists: but it does not have the atmosphere and the political background he does so well in the other books. Sadly: that is what the “market” wants. Not sadly: McKinty can now make a living off his writing.\n\nAlbert Memmi: Racism\n\nInteresting, but I did not know enough to fully evaluate his argument at the time when I read it.\n\nStephenie Meyer: The Chemist\n\nHmmm. I realize it is some kind of bestseller, and it is well-researched, and has twists and turns. But, man: they all be superhuman superheroes. Really? And strap a syrupy happy ending on, and there you have it. It is also too long for its own good.\n\nChina Mieville: Bas-Lag series\n\nI am not, normally, a fantasy or S/F person. True: I like Tolkien (or did, as a YA — which is when you should read heroic stuff like that). Never mind that: I always found life too short to get into that kind of pulp fiction. But I did read this, mainly because there was a learned discussion about it on a blog I like and frequent. Of course, while quite a few high-profile fantasy and S/F authors are fairly libertarian or reactionary, Mieville is anything but, and this is probably also what made me read through all three tomes in this epic. It is an okay read, sometimes frightening (!) and always weird, and more informed by Marxist politics than you would know – Luxemburg and Trotsky in particular.\n\nDenise Mina: Garnethill\n\nA very good trilogy: interesting and unusual characters (to say the least), an intriguing environment, and inventive storylines. A very nice break from the common mould of these crime stories —- but still also very Tartan Noir. Really recommended.\n\nDavid Mitchell: Black Swan Green\n\nA good and humane story about … stammering? And the travails of being a teenager.\n\nDavid Mitchell: Cloud Atlas\n\nI think my feelings about has cooled: it is a tour de force, but does it have actual depth?\n\nDavid Mitchell: The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet\n\nNot nearly as good as many of the other Michell books. Boring, even.\n\nNewman and Mittelmark: How not to write a novel\n\nThere is a very large market, it would seem, for books that will absolutely teach you to write a blockbuster novel in 1/3/14/60 days and so on and so forth. This is not one of those books. Instead, it teaches you how to write so badly that publication will never be an issue. Or did I miss something? Okay: it is very funny and also somewhat useful.\n\nPatrick Modiano: Missing Person *\n\nI have to admit that I had not heard of Modiano before he won the Nobel prize (or maybe I had, but not loudly enough to seek out any of his books). So, this was a first and a very pleasant surprise. You could easily say that Kafka meets Robbe-Grillet around here.\n\nElsa Morante: Arturo's Island\n\nQuite different from the major opus, and does not scale the same heights. But then few novels do. Good on its own premises.\n\nElsa Morante: History *\n\nUp there, probably, with the best 3-4 books I have ever read. An enormous achievement.\n\nJan Morris: Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere\n\nVaguely disappointing and much too idiosyncratic.\n\nToni Morrison: Song of Solomon\n\nDizzying magic realism with important themes throughout, and well worth a read. Perhaps, for me, even a reread as I was quite young, perhaps too young when I first read it.\n\nJohn Mortimer: Titmuss Regained\n\nThe Rumpole-creator uses his considerable wit to have a dig at Home Counties Tories. Eternally relevant.\n\nWalter Mosley: Devil in a Blue Dress\n\nI only read a few of the first Easy Rawlins books, but realized that pe"
