        "text": "Interesting, very strange\n\nI think I am going to have to read it again. The story is one of escalating insanity and fantasy. I love his other books but I am not sure about this book.\n\nhe sets up the world to be a place of vivid reallity,that exaggerated uni life. Well written and well preformed, but I'm not sure\n\nIt may resonate better with people that went to Uni in the states.\n\nFred Berman Deserves Death\n\nWhat made the experience of listening to The Big U the most enjoyable?\n\nThe story I guess; the performance is horrible and aggravating.\n\nWhat did you like best about this story?\n\nThere's too much to list; like all Stephenson's work, the writing ranges from the silly to the sublime. Many people think this is a very 'juvenile' work, and certainly I can appreciate that Stephenson's style has matured, but it's also just fun-as-hell to read, which I can't say for some of his other work (system of the world).\n\nWhat didn’t you like about Fred Berman’s performance?\n\nI love this book. I've loved it since it came out, and I've looked for an audiobook at least every year since then. Imagine my delight then, when I learned it was available.\n\nAnd imagine my frustration when one of the main characters, Ephraim, has his (biblical) name slaughtered by the reader every time (he pronounces it e-FRY-eem). Fred Berman also says \"flat lux\" when faced with \"fiat lux\" - a reasonable mistake, you might say, but it's shockingly unprofessional to my ears. You're being _paid_ to read aloud; you might want to pay a little attention to context, and ask someone when you're not sure know how to pronounce something.\n\nWho was the most memorable character of The Big U and why?\n\nOne of the joys of this book is that it's full of memorable and fun-to-read characters. I guess I'd pick Fred Fine."
