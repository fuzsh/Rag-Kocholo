That got raves on sfsite.com,didn't it win an award? Must admit I find little appeal in it.\n\nAnathem is, i think, pretty hard-SF being heavily focused on the mathematics & physics of the \"many worlds\" of quatum mechanics. It is a hugo shortlist candidate for best novel this year,\n\nPerhaps you are thinking of the Baroque-cycle (Quicksilver et. al) ... which is a sort of alt. history/secret history kind of thing?\n\nCan't think of anything of his i'd directly call \"fantasy\"\n\nWell,it doesn't exactly sound like SF either. His other stuff is mostly cyberpunk(yawn) and this Anadoodaa sounds like he's jumping on the Da Vinci code bandwagon.\n\nI think Snow Crash is one of the best sci-fi books I've ever read...\n\nMusic to my ears. It's one of my all time favourite Cyberpunk/SF novels.\n\nThe \"problem\" with Cryptonomicon I think is that you have be somewhat mathematically inclined and tech savvy to fully enjoyed it IMHO. If you read it only for the story and characters alone (which is usually the case for a novel) you wont get much out of it, it is a odd novel in that sense, it demands a lot from the reader.\n\nHe isnt anything like Reynolds...\n\nNeal Stephenson writes Cyberpunk. Comparing him to Alastair Reynolds is like comparing apples and oranges.\n\nHMMM.....interesting comments so far. I'm personally a big fan of Stephenson but then again I like maths, physics etc....and enjoy his work very much. I think it can be a disadvantage if you don't have an interest or background in the Sciences.\n\nBig statement from Conn to say he can't write decent prose. His Baroque Cycle is a highlight in prose for me anyway.\n\nThe books are pretty complex in scope and I agree can be a bit of a slog to get through but for me well worth the effort as a bit like a Gene Wolfe novel it demands a fair bit from its reader. I also agree that he could have done with a better editor at times but the books I think still flow quite well.\n\nI've got but am yet to read Anathem so difficult to say much on that one.\n\nCheers......\n\nI'm a big fan of Neal Stephenson but I'm having trouble reading Anathem. Anyone else find this?\n\nThe biggest problem, I find, is the use of a whole new vocabulary (fraa, suur, aut, Provencor, saunt, etc.) that I'm just not grabbing on to it as I did with his previous works. I don't know, just 20 pages in and I'm already taxed to the point of not completing it.\n\nI have some questions about the Baroque Cycle. I'm looking at buying it and apparently the first book - Quicksilver is actually 3 separate books\n\nBook 1 - Quicksilver\n\nBook 2 - The King of the Vagabonds\n\nBook 3 - Odalisque\n\nAs far as I can tell, the 2nd and 3rd books - Confusion and The System of the World are also subdivided (according to Wiki), but each of their subdivisions are not sold separately. I just want to make sure that when I'm buying these, I have to get all 5 books.\n\nI'm a big fan of Neal Stephenson but I'm having trouble reading Anathem.

I don't know, just 20 pages in and I'm already taxed to the point of not completing it.\n\nJust finished Anathem, and have to say the new vocabulary was one of the strengths of the book. I was kinda like going on an extended holiday to another country and learning part of the language. It takes time for the words to take on meaning, but once they have, you've sunk deaper into the culture. I think I had tears in my eyes when they evoked that last mass Voco.\n\nI found Anathem to be one his most engaging books yet, with likeable characters and a good followable storyline. I think Stephenson succeeded in creating a believable alternate world since I miss Arbre, much like I miss Stockholm where I went for a vacation a couple of months ago."
