The summer solstice, in the northern hemisphere, is the longest day of the year and the first day of summer. After today the days start getting shorter until we reach the first day of winter on the winter solstice – December 22, 2019; then the days will again get a little longer each day until the 2020 summer solstice.\n\nThe word “solstice” and its older cousin “Litha” refer to the longest day of the year when the Earth’s axis is as close to the sun as it ever gets in its early trip around the sun. And the most famous place in the western hemisphere to actually see the summer solstice is at Stonehenge; where the prehistoric circle of standing stones was engineered so that if you stand in the circle of stones and ace northeast toward the entrance, toward what is known as the Heel Stone, you’ll see the sun rise above the Heel Stone. Thousands of peoples congregate at Stonehenge in the hours before dawn on the summer solstice to witness the incredible light display and to festively welcome summer.\n\nIn Europe Midsummer, a celebration of the solstice, occurs between June 21 and June 25 the exact date varying by country. Midsummer celebrations include the building of bon fires, feasting, dancing and generally making merry whist welcoming summer.\n\nAnd in celebration of the fact that summer is finally here, despite all the rain we’ve been having, this week our musical suggestions all relate to the solstice and midsummer celebrations!\n\nWhat fun!\n\nAnd without further ado here are the solsticey-summery listening suggestions for the week!\n\nCeltic Solstice by Paul Winter & Friends (Genre: New Age, Celtic, Jazz, Classical – great music!):\n\nYou might think Paul Winter’s Celtic Solstice is a more appropriate album to listen to during winter solstice. However, Paul Winter plays summer solstice music too!\n\nCeltic Solstice is a terrific, ethereal album and includes the songs Golden Apples of the Sun, Hollow Hills, Dawnwalker, My Fair Faithful Love and The Minstrel’s Adieu.\n\nOn a related Paul Winter music note, since we are close enough in our region for one to easily visit New York City, just as an FYI, Paul Winter has given a sunrise summer solstice concert every year for the last 23 years at The Cathedral Church of Saint John The Divine in Manhattan. And today he is giving his 24th annual summer solstice concert there. The Paul Winter Consort has a residency at the Cathedral of Saint John The Divine, so if you like their music you might check their website, or like Paul Winter’s Facebook page, to keep track of upcoming concerts and you might perhaps, one year, go to New York and attend the annual Paul Winter Summer Solstice Concert!\n\nAnd for those of us who aren’t able to get to New York City, Paul Winter is graciously offering a free download of his summer solstice music which is accessible through the Summer Solstice site and via the following link:\n\nhttp://solsticeconcert.com/summersolstice/#venue\n\n–\n\nLitha (2011) by Skarazula (Genre: Medieval, Ancient Music, World Music):\n\nSharazula is a Montreal based trio consisting of Francois Rainville, Steve Grenier and Francois Perron.

The music and the atmosphere from the two nights they played has now been made to last forever with the new record, A Midsummer Night’s Jazz, which is released in April 2016 on Denmark’s great jazz label, Storyville Records.\n\nThere’s something unique about listening to live music: And jazz – that living, playful and impulsive music – should be experienced at close range. A Midsummer Night’s Jazz captures this special and intense live feel. With the Nikolaj Bentzon Trio the energy is guaranteed to reach new heights. Espen Laub von Lillienskjold (drums) delivers both nerve and elegance to the quick swing classics and soulful ballads. Nikolaj Bentzon (piano) has a unique ability to bring new life to well-known standards with groovy and swinging riffs among other creative impulses. The interplay between him and his musical partner Signe Juhl (vocals) is unrivalled.\n\nIn the last few years, their close companionship has resulted in several releases – for example Signe Juhl’s debut Silver Tongued and the large-scale symphony Bluray-release Luxury Jazz. And 31-year old Juhl is an extraordinarily noteworthy contributor to the Danish musical stage. She is a full-grown vocalist with an extraordinary depth and vocal span for our Northern latitudes. Her excess in melodic skill often brings her to new and interesting places in songs, you used to think you already knew. She possesses, in other words, a true jazz instinct. It’s swinging!” Storyville Records\n\nSongs on the album include When You’re Smilin’, It Don’t Mean A Thing, Dinah, Night Piece, You’ve Changed and I Cover The Waterfront.\n\n–\n\nSpiritual Music for Midsummer Solstice in Stonehenge by Various Artists (Litha, Midsommarafton, Sommersonnenwende, Sankthansaften, Enyovden, Ukon Juhla, Inti Raymi, Pachakuti) (Genre: World Music):\n\nThis various artist collection of reflective music has a middle eastern vibe to it.

Compassionate Millie knows he’ll be killed if discovered, and makes the dangerous decision to offer him shelter from the storm.\n\nOn opposite sides of the inescapable conflict, the two strangers forge an unexpected and passionate bond. But as the snow thaws, the relentless fury of World War Two forces them apart, leaving only the haunting memories of what they shared, and an understanding that their secret must never see light.\n\nAs Millie’s dangerous act of kindness sets them on paths they never could have expected, those closest to them become their greatest threats, and the consequences of compassion prove deadly…\n\nA Dangerous Act of Kindness is a beautiful, harrowing love story, perfect for fans of Rachel Hore and Santa Montefiore\n\n–\n\nFall; or, Dodge in Hell A Novel by Neal Stephenson:\n\nThe #1 New York Times bestselling author of Seveneves, Anathem, Reamde, and Cryptonomicon returns with a wildly inventive and entertaining science fiction thriller—Paradise Lost by way of Philip K. Dick—that unfolds in the near future, in parallel worlds.\n\nIn his youth, Richard “Dodge” Forthrast founded Corporation 9592, a gaming company that made him a multibillionaire. Now in his middle years, Dodge appreciates his comfortable, unencumbered life, managing his myriad business interests, and spending time with his beloved niece Zula and her young daughter, Sophia.\n\nOne beautiful autumn day, while he undergoes a routine medical procedure, something goes irrevocably wrong. Dodge is pronounced brain dead and put on life support, leaving his stunned family and close friends with difficult decisions. Long ago, when a much younger Dodge drew up his will, he directed that his body be given to a cryonics company now owned by enigmatic tech entrepreneur Elmo Shepherd. Legally bound to follow the directive despite their misgivings, Dodge’s family has his brain scanned and its data structures uploaded and stored in the cloud, until it can eventually be revived.\n\nIn the coming years, technology allows Dodge’s brain to be turned back on. It is an achievement that is nothing less than the disruption of death itself. An eternal afterlife—the Bitworld—is created, in which humans continue to exist as digital souls.\n\nBut this brave new immortal world is not the Utopia it might first seem . . .\n\nFall, or Dodge in Hell is pure, unadulterated fun: a grand drama of analog and digital, man and machine, angels and demons, gods and followers, the finite and the eternal. In this exhilarating epic, Neal Stephenson raises profound existential questions and touches on the revolutionary breakthroughs that are transforming our future. Combining the technological, philosophical, and spiritual in one grand myth, he delivers a mind-blowing speculative literary saga for the modern age.\n\n–\n\nHorse Latitudes by Morris Collins:\n\nMorris Collins’ Horse Latitudes is one of the most impressive debuts I’ve read. A hybrid narrative that’s part thriller, part surreal noir, and part tropical gothic, it reads like a collaboration between William Faulkner, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, and Hunter S. Thompson, as directed by David Lynch.\n\nEthan is a New York photographer whose crumbling marriage ends when his wife commits herself to a mental institution after being raped by a stranger. Confused and haunted by guilt over not being able to help her, Ethan flees to Mexico. He doesn’t know if he wants to find himself, find some sense of purpose, or just drink himself into oblivion and find death at the hands of a machete-wielding gangbanger. While figuring it out, he gets in a bar fight, smashes a bottle into the face of a man with cartel connections, and ends up on a journey to the interior of the country to save a young woman from being trafficked — a journey that will put him in touch with violent gangs, crazy expatriates, strange detectives, mystics, and the ubiquitous aftermath of colonialism.

On a train to Berlin in late 1930, William Bradshaw locks eyes with Arthur Norris, an irresistibly comical fellow Englishman wearing a rather obvious wig and nervous about producing his passport at the frontier. So begins a friendship conducted in the seedier quarters of the city, where Norris runs a dubious import-export business and lives in excited fear of his bullying secretary, his creditors, and his dominatrix girlfriend, Anni. As the worldwide economic Depression strangles the masses and the Communists make a desperate stand against Fascism and war, Norris sells himself as political orator, spy, and double agent. He also sells his friends. Like its companion novel, Goodbye to Berlin, Mr Norris Changes Trains offers unforgettable characters struggling in the vortex as the Nazis rise to power.\n\n–\n\nPatsy: A Novel by Nicole Dennis-Benn:\n\nOne of the “Most Anticipated Books of the Summer”\n\nEntertainment Weekly • Washington Post • Buzzfeed • Vulture • O Magazine • Vanity Fair • Elle • Real Simple\n\nA beautifully layered portrait of motherhood, immigration, and the sacrifices we make in the name of love from award-winning novelist Nicole Dennis-Benn.\n\n“Nicole Dennis-Benn’s debut novel, Here Comes the Sun, stunned critics when it was released in 2016. The story of a woman and her two daughters fighting for survival in their drought-stricken Jamaican town, it was a powerful look at issues like poverty, colorism and homophobia.\n\nAdmirers of Here Comes the Sun have waited three years for Dennis-Benn’s followup, and anyone who was enchanted by her gorgeous writing are in for a happy surprise: Patsy isn’t just as good as its predecessor, it’s somehow even better.\n\nThe title character of the novel is a young single mother in Jamaica, living with her devoutly Christian mother, Mama G, and her young daughter, Tru. She works a minimum-wage civil service job to support her family; it’s barely enough to cover her family’s rent and food and her daughter’s private school tuition.\n\nPatsy has a dream: “a dream every Jamaican of a certain social ranking shares: boarding an airplane to America.” She’s determined to get a travel visa to visit Cicely, her longtime friend and former lover, who moved to New York years before. She envisions herself and Cicely living what she sees as a normal American life, “trying on clothes in boutiques and zipping up each other’s dresses like they did as girls, and shopping for household items together, like real couples do for their house — a two-story brick house.” , Michael Schaub, NPR\n\nAccess the full-NPR review here: https://www.npr.org/2019/06/04/726728394/patsy-discovers-her-dreams-dont-match-reality\n\n–\n\nPRINT BOOK SUGGESTIONS OF THE WEEK:\n\nAngel Thieves by Kathi Appelt:\n\nAn ocelot. A slave. An angel thief.\n\nMultiple perspectives spanning across time are united through themes of freedom, hope, and faith in a most unusual and epic novel from Newbery Honor–winning author and National Book Award finalist Kathi Appelt.\n\nSixteen-year-old Cade Curtis is an angel thief. After his mother’s family rejected him for being born out of wedlock, he and his dad moved to the apartment above a local antique shop. The only payment the owner Mrs. Walker requests: marble angels, stolen from graveyards, for her to sell for thousands of dollars to collectors. But there’s one angel that would be the last they’d ever need to steal; an angel, carved by a slave, with one hand open and one hand closed. If only Cade could find it…\n\nZorra, a young ocelot, watches the bayou rush past her yearningly. The poacher who captured and caged her has long since lost her, and Zorra is getting hungrier and thirstier by the day. Trapped, she only has the sounds of the bayou for comfort—but it tells her help will come soon.\n\nBefore Zorra, Achsah, a slave, watched the very same bayou with her two young daughters. After the death of her master, Achsah is free, but she’ll be damned if her daughters aren’t freed with her. All they need to do is find the church with an angel with one hand open and one hand closed…\n\nIn a masterful feat, National Book Award Honoree Kathi Appelt weaves together stories across time, connected by the bayou, an angel, and the universal desire to be free.\n\n–\n\nThe Behavior of Love: A Novel by Virginia Reeves:\n\nAn incredibly compulsive, poignant exploration of marriage, lust, and ambition from one of America’s great young literary talents, the Man-Booker Prize longlisted author of Work Like Any Other.\n\nDoctor Ed Malinowski believes he has realized most of his dreams. A passionate, ambitious behavioral psychiatrist, he is now the superintendent of a mental institution and finally turning the previously crumbling hospital around. He also has a home he can be proud of, and a fiercely independent, artistic wife Laura, whom he hopes will soon be pregnant.\n\nBut into this perfect vision of his life comes Penelope, a beautiful, young epileptic who should never have been placed in his institution and whose only chance at getting out is Ed. She is intelligent, charming, and slowly falling in love with her charismatic, compassionate doctor. As their relationship grows more complicated, and Laura stubbornly starts working at his hospital, Ed must weigh his professional responsibilities against his personal ones, and find a way to save both his job and his family.\n\nA love triangle set in one of the most chaotic, combustible settings imaginable, The Behavior of Love is wise, riveting, and deeply resonant.\n\n–\n\nThe Devouring Gray by Christine Lynn Herman:\n\nBranches and stones, daggers and bones, They locked the Beast away.\n\nAfter the death of her sister, seventeen-year-old Violet Saunders finds herself dragged to Four Paths, New York. Violet may be a newcomer, but she soon learns her mother isn’t: They belong to one of the revered founding families of the town, where stone bells hang above every doorway and danger lurks in the depths of the woods. Justin Hawthorne’s bloodline has protected Four Paths for generations from the Gray—a lifeless dimension that imprisons a brutal monster. After Justin fails to inherit his family’s powers, his mother is determined to keep this humiliation a secret. But Justin can’t let go of the future he was promised and the town he swore to protect. Ever since Harper Carlisle lost her hand to an accident that left her stranded in the Gray for days, she has vowed revenge on the person who abandoned her: Justin Hawthorne. There are ripples of dissent in Four Paths, and Harper seizes an opportunity to take down the Hawthornes and change her destiny—to what extent, even she doesn’t yet know. The Gray is growing stronger every day, and its victims are piling up. When Violet accidentally unleashes the monster, all three must band together with the other Founders to unearth the dark truths behind their families’ abilities… before the Gray devours them all.\n\n–\n\nEat to Sleep: What to Eat and When to Eat It for a Good Night’s Sleep―Every Night by Karman Meyer:\n\nUtilize food as your all-natural solution to sleeplessness with this easy guide that teaches you just what to eat—and when to eat it—to fall asleep faster and wake up refreshed.\n\nWe’ve all heard that it’s the turkey that makes you so sleepy after every Thanksgiving dinner, and a cup of warm milk is just the thing to help you settle down for night, but it may surprise you to find just how much what you eat can affect how well you sleep at night.\n\nWhether you experience occasional insomnia or suffer from chronic sleeplessness, Eat to Sleep explains which foods to eat and when to eat them in order to get the best night’s rest possible. With information on how to easily incorporate “sleepy” foods into your diet, and how to prepare your food to increase its sleep-inducing effectiveness, Eat to Sleep shows you the way to getting optimal shuteye—naturally.\n\n–\n\nInvisible Heroes of World War II: Extraordinary Wartime Stories of Ordinary People by Jerry Borrowman:\n\nInvisible Heroes of World War II, documents ten fascinating true stories of a diverse group of soldiers and noncombatants from all over the world, including African Americans, women, and Native Americans, who fought with the Allies during World War II. These heroes made significant contributions in the war effort, and sometimes gave their lives for freedom and liberty, often without much recognition or fanfare. Some were frontline soldiers who were captured by the enemy and endured horrific conditions as POWs, others were ordinary citizens who fought in the French Resistance and provided vital operations to undermine Nazi occupation, while others were engineers, workers in industry, or war correspondents and photographers. All served with valor and distinction as part of the massive Allied forces who fought to free the world from tyranny and oppression.\n\nHave a great week!\n\nLinda Reimer, SSCL\n\nReferences\n\nAll Aboard!

Something that will mean an unimaginable leap of faith on Carly’s part.\n\nAnd all for the love of her unborn child.\n\nThe Dream Daughter is a rich, genre-spanning, breathtaking novel about one mother’s quest to save her child, unite her family, and believe in the unbelievable.

She’s either going to save the world—or die trying.\n\nIt took one hell of an effort for the authorities to finally get the jump on master manipulator Bianca St. Ives, but now that they have, it’s far from the capture she expected. Instead of taking her in, there’s an offer on the table, a one-shot deal that would allow Bianca to walk away scot-free as if they’d never found her. And all she has to do is run one last mission—the kind she might never return from. But if Bianca wants to go back to her normal life in Savannah, it’s not like she has a choice.\n\nAn intelligence operation is already under way in North Korea, one that’s poised to end the country’s existing tyrannical regime for good. But first, the US need one of their own to go undercover as the female hacker who recently stole top secret intel from NORAD. Enter Bianca. After everything she’s seen, Bianca knows feeding fake information directly into the belly of the beast is about as dangerous as it gets. It could mean torture or endless imprisonment—assuming she survives. But it might also ignite the kind of chaos that forces a revolution. It might just change the world. Besides, if Bianca has to go down, she’s gonna go down swinging…\n\n–\n\nThe New Health Rules: Simple Changes to Achieve Whole-Body Wellness by Frank Lipman & Danielle Claro:\n\nFrank Lipman, M.D., is one of the country’s top pioneers in the field of integrative medicine.

Just beyond the tents of the Russian refugee camp she calls home, a young woman speaks her wedding vows. It’s a decision that will alter her destiny…and it’s a lie that will remain buried until the next century.\n\nSince she was nine years old, Alina Dziak knew she would marry her best friend, Tomasz. Now fifteen and engaged, Alina is unconcerned by reports of Nazi soldiers at the Polish border, believing her neighbors that they pose no real threat, and dreams instead of the day Tomasz returns from college in Warsaw so they can be married. But little by little, injustice by brutal injustice, the Nazi occupation takes hold, and Alina’s tiny rural village, its families, are divided by fear and hate.\n\nThen, as the fabric of their lives is slowly picked apart, Tomasz disappears. Where Alina used to measure time between visits from her beloved, now she measures the spaces between hope and despair, waiting for word from Tomasz and avoiding the attentions of the soldiers who patrol her parents’ farm. But for now, even deafening silence is preferable to grief.\n\nSlipping between Nazi-occupied Poland and the frenetic pace of modern life, Kelly Rimmer creates an emotional and finely wrought narrative. The Things We Cannot Say is an unshakable reminder of the devastation when truth is silenced…and how it can take a lifetime to find our voice before we learn to trust it.\n\n–\n\nPRINT BOOK SUGGESTIONS OF THE WEEK:\n\nHome Remedies: Stories by Xuan Juliana Wang:\n\n“These dazzling stories interrogate the fractures, collisions and glorious new alloys of what it means to be a Chinese millennial.”—Adam Johnson, author of the Pulitzer Prize–winning The Orphan Master’s Son\n\nNamed One of the Most Anticipated Books of 2019 by Nylon, Electric Literature, The Millions, and LitHub • An Elle Best Book of Spring\n\nIn dexterous, electric prose, the twelve stories in Xuan Juliana Wang’s first collection reveal the new face of a generation of Chinese youth.\n\nHer characters stand at the threshold of bold and uncertain futures, navigating between their heritage and the chaos of contemporary life.

And in New York, a father creates an algorithm to troubleshoot the problem of raising a daughter born into a world so different from his own.\n\nFrom fuerdai (second-generation rich kids) and livestream stars to a glass-swallowing qigong grandmaster, these stories upend the well-worn immigrant narrative to reveal a new experience of belonging: of young people testing the limits of who they are and who they will one day become, in a world as vast and varied as their ambitions.\n\n–\n\nMore Deadly than the Male: Masterpieces from the Queens of Horror edited by Graeme Davis:\n\nA darkly luminous new anthology collecting the most terrifying horror stories by renowned female authors, presenting anew these forgotten classics to the modern reader.\n\nReaders are well aware that Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein: few know how many other tales of terror she created. In addition to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote some surprisingly effective horror stories. The year after Little Women appeared, Louisa May Alcott published one of the first mummy tales. These ladies weren’t alone. From the earliest days of Gothic and horror fiction, women were exploring the frontiers of fear, dreaming dark dreams that will still keep you up at night.\n\nMore Deadly than the Male includes unexpected horror tales by Louisa May Alcott and Harriet Beecher Stowe, and forgotten writers like Mary Cholmondely and Charlotte Riddell, whose work deserves a modern audience. Readers will be drawn in by the familiar names and intrigued by their rare stories.\n\nIn The Beckside Boggle, Alice Rea brings a common piece of English folklore to hair-raising life, while Helene Blavatsky, best known as the founder of the spiritualist Theosophical Society, conjures up a solid and satisfying ghost story in The Cave of the Echoes. Edith Wharton’s great novel The Age of Innocence won her the Pulitzer prize, yet her horror stories are known only to a comparative few.\n\nReaders will discover lost and forgotten women who wrote horror every bit as effectively as their male contemporaries. They will learn about their lives and careers, the challenges they faced as women working in a male-dominated field, the way they overcame those challenges, and the way they approached the genre―which was often subtler, more psychological, and more disturbing.\n\n–\n\nOdd Partners: An Anthology by Mystery Writers Of America, Allison Brennan, Jeffery Deaver et al.\n\nUnlikely pairs join forces to crack a slew of intriguing cases in an anthology edited by New York Times bestselling author Anne Perry, featuring original stories by Jacqueline Winspear, Jeffery Deaver, Allison Brennan, Charles Todd, and many more, including Perry herself.\n\nThroughout the annals of fiction, there have been many celebrated detective teams: Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. Nick and Nora Charles. Hercule Poirot and Arthur Hastings. Thomas and Charlotte Pitt. That last pair is the creation of beloved mystery writer Anne Perry, who, as the editor of Odd Partners and in conjunction with Mystery Writers of America, has enlisted some of today’s best mystery writers to craft all-new stories about unlikely duos who join forces—sometimes unwillingly—to solve beguiling whodunits.\n\nFrom Perry’s own entry, in which an English sergeant and his German counterpart set out to find a missing soldier during World War I, to a psychological tale of an airplane passenger who wakes up unsure of who he is and must enlist his fellow passengers to help him remember, to a historical mystery about a misguided witch-hunt and the unlikely couple that brings it down, each story deals in the wonderful complexities of human interactions. And not just human interactions: Honey bees avenge the death of their beekeeper, a wandering cat brings home clues to a murder, and a gray wolf and a fly fisherman in the Minnesota woods try to protect their land from a brash billionaire.\n\nFeaturing work by New York Times bestselling authors, Edgar Award winners, and up-and-coming members of the Mystery Writers of America, these tales of friends, enemies, and pairs who lie somewhere in the middle will satisfy every type of mystery reader. With each author’s signature brand of suspense, these stories give new meaning to the word “teamwork.”\n\nFeaturing stories by:\n\nAce Atkins • Allison Brennan • Shelley Costa • Jeffery Deaver • Robert Dugoni • William Frank • Georgia Jeffries • Lou Kemp • William Kent Krueger • Joe R.

Germany had conquered most of Western Europe, and its armies were deep into Russia. Japan had overrun Manchuria, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies, had conquered large swathes of China, and had destroyed much of the US battle fleet at Pearl Harbor. But the tide of World War II turned dramatically in favor of the Allies, and in this, Allied scientists played a critical role. The chapters covered in this book include an Overview summary of the entire war, the Battle of Britain, the Battle of the Atlantic against the German U-boats, the battle for command of the air, the Allied breaking of the German Enigma cipher, D-Day and the Allied invasion of Europe, and the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb.\n\n–\n\nWalking on the Ceiling by Aysegül Savas:\n\nAfter her mother’s death, Nunu moves from Istanbul to a small apartment in Paris. One day outside of a bookstore, she meets M., an older British writer whose novels about Istanbul Nunu has always admired. They find themselves walking the streets of Paris and talking late into the night. What follows is an unusual friendship of eccentric correspondence and long walks around the city. M. is working on a new novel set in Turkey and Nunu tells him about her family, hoping to impress and inspire him. She recounts the idyllic landscapes of her past, mythical family meals, and her elaborate childhood games. As she does so, she also begins to confront her mother’s silence and anger, her father’s death, and the growing unrest in Istanbul. Their intimacy deepens, so does Nunu’s fear of revealing too much to M. and of giving too much of herself and her Istanbul away. Most of all, she fears that she will have to face her own guilt about her mother and the narratives she’s told to protect herself from her memories.\n\nHave a great week!\n\nLinda, SSCL\n\nOnline Catalog Links:\n\nStarCat\n\nThe catalog of physical materials, i.e. print books, DVDs, audiobooks on CD, etc.\n\nThe Digital Catalog (OverDrive)\n\nThe catalog of e-books, downloadable audiobooks and a handful of streaming videos.\n\nFreegal Music Service\n\nThis music service is free to library card holders and offers the option to download, and keep, three free songs per week and to stream three hours of commercial-free music each day:\n\nRBDigital\n\n*Magazines are available for free and on demand!
