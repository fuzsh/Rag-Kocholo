        "text": "(https://pixabay.com/)\n\nOne of the reasons that I love to read, in addition to experiencing other worlds, walking in the path of other characters, learning about the world around us, and escaping from reality for a short time, is to enjoy the beauty of words. Some writers are able to elevate their writing to a level of poetry and beauty that is exhilarating and joyful to read.\n\nOne writer, whose use of words, reaches poetic levels is Ray Bradbury. He is a writer not easily confined to one genre and whose work is defined by love of story. I have taught his work in several college classes in both Muhlenberg College and Lehigh University, and his writing has been an influence on me as a novelist.\n\n(Photo by Alan Light)\n\nI will offer two passages from his brilliant novel Dandelion Wine, a BildungsRoman or coming-of-age story, set in late 1920s in Green Town, Illinois. These passages are from the perspective of a boy who is beginning to see possibilities in life, both the external world and in himself.\n\nThe first passage is the opening of the novel:\n\n“It was a quiet morning, the town covered over with darkness and at ease in bed.\n\nSummer gathered in the weather, the wind had the proper touch, the breathing\n\nof the world was long and warm and slow. You only had to rise, lean from your\n\nwindow, and know that this indeed was the first real time of freedom and living,\n\nthis was the first morning of summer.\n\nDouglas Spaulding, twelve, freshly wakened, let summer idle him on its\n\nearly-morning stream. Lying in his third-story cupola bedroom, he felt the tall\n\npower it gave him, riding high in the June wind, the grandest tower in town. At\n\nnight, when the trees washed together, he flashed his gaze like a beacon from\n\nthis lighthouse in all directions over swarming seas of elm and oak and maple.\n\nNow . . .” (1).\n\nThat is an extraordinary opening to a novel. It pulls the reader into the story with a seemingly simplistic prose, but within that simplicity is beauty and the poetry of the world being seen through young eyes.\n\nAnother passage shows Douglas at night time:\n\n“Douglas sprawled back on the dry porch planks, completely contented\n\nand reassured by these voices, which would speak on through eternity, flow\n\nin a stream of murmurings over his body, over his closed eyelids, into his\n\ndrowsy ears, for all time. The rocking chairs sounded like crickets, the crickets\n\nsounded like rocking chairs, and the moss-covered rain barrel by the\n\ndining-room window produced another generation of mosquitoes to provide\n\na topic of conversation through endless summers ahead (33).\n\nBoth excerpts, in my view, are beautiful, compelling, and poetic. All writers should read and study Ray Bradbury.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBradbury, Ray. Dandelion Wine. New York. Avon Books. 1999.\n\nDo you have difficulty finishing a first draft of your book? This problem is extremely common and has a variety of reasons, but there are solutions for this issue. I have become somewhat of an expert on finishing first drafts, and I want to offer help to those who experience the frustration of never completing or taking far too long to finish a draft.\n\nA question that can be asked is why do I know anything about this situation? How am I qualified to offer any kind of assistance? The answer is my experience as a writer. I am a hybrid author—both a traditionally published writer of French On English: A Guide To Writing Better Essays, and a self-published writer of two novels: Maledicus: The Investigative Paranormal Society, Book 1, and Gallows Hill: The Investigative Paranormal Society, Book 2 and a cookbook based on the characters of the I. P. S. – The Investigative Paranormal Society Cookbook. I have become an expert on creating first drafts in the last eight years of writing. That is when I committed to being a writer as well as a professor of English. In those years, in addition to the books I have mentioned, I have also written my dissertation for my Ph.D. in English Literature, 3 academic papers, two short stories, one other finished novel, and three first drafts of other novels. This is not to say that all I do is write; that is completely on the other end of truth. I teach college, I am a husband and grandfather, and I also enjoy life.\n\nFrom Get The Draft Done! Helping Writers Finish Their First Draft (12).\n\nWhat does my book offer to you? I address that question in the “Introduction”:\n\nAccording to The New York Times, about 81% of Americans dream of writing a book and becoming a published author. Very few writers, less than 3% finish their books, and even fewer receive publishing deals. Many writers find themselves somewhere in this group. While these seem to be daunting odds, it is important to understand though it is not that they are somehow stacked against you to keep you from achieving success; rather, it is that you probably do not have a plan in place to write a first draft and then to do the necessary revisions and compete in the publishing world with an understanding of its difficulties. In order to do those things and have a chance for success, you need to develop the writer’s mindset.\n\nInstead of thinking about doing the first draft with anxiety or fear attached, this book is going to teach you a way that will redefine what it means to get the draft done.\n\nThe first draft does not have to be perfect, and it will not be.\n\nThe first draft does not need to be a certain length (not for the first draft!)\n\nAnd it does not need to be thought of as an entire book – it will certainly need major additions and subtractions.\n\nI am going to give you the strategies and tactics I use, every day, to write approximately 150,000 words a year. That is the equivalent of two first drafts! Once you have these techniques in your writer’s toolbox, you will be more prolific, less likely to succumb to writer’s block, and you will have a finished first draft. This completed draft will be the initial and largest step towards becoming a published author.\n\nThis book does not cover the act of revision (that is my next book). It also does not deal with getting an agent, a publisher, self-publishing, marketing, or what subjects you should write about.\n\nThis book is intended to help you get from the first word to the last word of an initial draft.\n\nThis book will help you to get the draft done!\n\nSo, let’s get started!\n\nEpstein, Joseph. https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/28/opinion/think-you-have-a-book-in-\n\nyou-think-again.html\n\nThis book is available amazon.com for $9.99 for the paperback.\n\nGet The Draft Done! is available here: Amazon.com\n\nGallows Hill can be found here in ebook.\n\nGallows Hill in paperback can be found here.\n\nAn interview about Gallows Hill can be found here.\n\nPlease follow the following links to find my novel:\n\nebook\n\nPrint book\n\nThank you!\n\nThe book trailer:\n\nMaledicus:Investigative Paranormal Society Book I\n\nMy radio interview:\n\ninterview\n\nAvailable on Amazon\n\nAvailable on Amazon\n\nI want to welcome Robbie Cheadle to the U. L. S., The Underground Library Society! This group is an unofficial collection of people who deeply value books. It is based on the idea of The Book People from Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.

Rider Haggard\n\nBackground\n\nI decided to read King Solomon’s Mines as it is set in South Africa in the late 19th century. I am currently finalizing my first adult novel, A Ghost and His Gold, which is set during the Second Anglo Boer War. I hoped that King Solomon’s Mines would give me insight into life in southern Africa during this period.\n\nRider Haggard spent time in South Africa after he took a position as the assistant to the secretary to Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant-Governor of the Colony of Natal in 1875. In 1876, he was transferred to the staff of Sir Theophilus Shepstone, Special Commissioner for the Transvaal. It was in this role that Sir Haggard was present in Pretoria, capital of the then Boer Republic of the Transvaal, in April 1877 when it was officially annexed by Britain. Sir Haggard was tasked with the duty of raising the Union flag and reading out much of the proclamation at the annexation event after the official originally entrusted with this duty lost his voice.\n\nI had an interest in Sir Rider Haggard and his books because he lived in Ditchingham, a town close to my mother’s hometown of Bungay in Suffolk, England. When her brother was a young man he was employed by Sir Haggard and Sir Haggard daughter, Lilias Haggard, edited a book entitled The Rabbit Skin Cap which told the story of an old man who was well known to my mother. My mother’s memories of Sir Rider Haggard’s house and his daughter, Lilias, are included in the fictionalized memoir of her life, While the Bombs Fell, which we wrote together.\n\nKing Solomon’s Mines literary importance\n\nKing Solomon’s Mines is a book that is worth preserving because it is a rollicking good story with lots of action, written along similar lines to the famous Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stephenson. The author has a wonderful gift of descriptive writing and shares the beauty and mystery of Africa in a most appealing and interesting way. The author demonstrates a thorough knowledge of southern Africa and the way of life among the hunters of the time. An example of this glorious language is as follows:\n\n“But just before you come to Durban there is a peculiar richness about the landscape. There are the sheer kloofs cut in the hills by the rushing rains of centuries, down which the rivers sparkle; there is the deepest green of the bush, growing as God planted it, and the other greens of the mealie gardens and the sugar patches, while now and again a white house, smiling out at the placid sea, puts a finish and gives an air of homeliness to the scene.” Although this sentence is long by modern book writing standards, it describes the scene vividly. The language used by the writer is not complex and overwhelmingly ornate like many other books from this same period, but rather is written in a simple and conversational style.\n\nAnother wonderful description is of the Kalahari Desert: “On, on we went, till at last the east began to blush like the cheek of the girl. Then there came faint rays of primrose light, that changed presently to golden bars, through which the dawn glided out across the desert. The stars grew pale and paler still, till at last they vanished; the golden moon waxed wan, and her mountain ridges stood out against her sickly face like the bones on the cheek of a dying man.”\n\nI must state that this book is set in Southern Africa in the late 19th century and contains some language that is offensive to modern readers. This book also expresses some of the colonialist thinking of the time, particularly in its descriptions of certain relationships between the Europeans and the Africans. These views and relationship depictions are dated and reprehensible by modern standards, but it is of literary interest that the author was progressive for the time and this was reflected in his work.\n\nHaggard demonstrates respect of the African culture and describes many of the African warriors, including Ignosi, one of the main characters in the book, as brave and heroic. Twala, the existing king of the Kukuana people, when the three European travelers and Ignosi arrive in Kukuanaland, and Gagool, the witch doctor, are described as being cruel and barbaric but this is in line with their roles as the villains of this story. The story also includes a romance between Englishman, Captain Good, and a Kukuana maiden called Foulata, which would have been socially unacceptable at the time.\n\nMy review of King Solomon’s Mines\n\nKing Solomon’s Mine is a thrilling tale of Allan Quatermaine, a European hunter living in Durban, South Africa, who partners with Sir Henry Curtis, a huge Adonis of a man from a wealthy English family, and his colleague Captain Good, to cross the Kalahari Desert in search of Sir Curtis’ younger brother, Neville and the legendary mines of King Solomon. Being on the wrong side of 50 years old and with his career as an elephant hunter drawing to an end, Mr Quatermaine agrees to accompany the pair on their ambitious journey.\n\nAllan Quatermaine is rather pessimistic by nature and does not believe he will live to return to his home in Durban. His terms of engagement include making provision for his son in the likely event of his death. He does not see himself as a brave man, but his actions demonstrate this he is brave, and clever and levelheaded too.\n\nSir Henry Curtis is beset with guilt as he believes himself responsible for his brother’s rash action in crossing the desert, a journey very few have survived. He is determined to look for his brother and redeem himself, even if it results in his own death. Sir Curtis is brave and strong, the kind of man admired by many for his physical attributes. He fights alongside Ignosi’s best warriors when a tribal war erupts later in the story. Sir Curtis is kind and compassionate and is not corrupted by greed like many men are, even when he learns of the treasure hidden in King Solomon’s mines.\n\nCaptain Good is an ex-navel man and quite precise in his behaviour and beliefs. He is prim and proper and takes great care of his personal appearance, a characteristic that nearly results in his death early in the story but proves to be of great assistance to the adventurers later on.\n\nIgnosi enters the story as an African servant named Umbopa. He is a huge man, strong and clever, who does not fit well into the role of a servant. Despite this, Sir Henry and Quatermaine decide he is perfectly suited to accompany them on their journey. Good has some reservations but these are swept aside by his traveling companions.\n\nThe book tells the story of the four men’s journey from Durban to a small African village on the outskirts of the desert. It provides a lot of insight into life at the time and describes travelling by ox wagon, an exciting elephant hunt that ends in tragedy and the life-threatening trek across the desert.\n\nOnce the men manage to traverse the desert and the mountain and enter Kukuanaland, the story becomes even more exciting when they encounter the evil Twala, a Shaka Zulu styled tyrant with no respect for human life, and Gagool, a powerful witch doctor with a taste for murdering beautiful young girls.\n\nReaders are treated to a ferocious tribal war, an exciting trip to the mines of King Solomon and an evil trap. This is an exciting and fast paced story which demonstrates the author’s knowledge of southern Africa and the lifestyles and cultures of the time from both the European and African perspective.\n\nPotential readers should be warned that this book was written during the colonialist era and contains some language and ideas that are offensive to modern readers. If you can set this aside as a function of the politics and ideology of the era, it is a fantastic adventure story along the lines of Indiana Jones.\n\nA Ghost and His Gold by Roberta Eaton Cheadle – Cover reveal\n\nAbout Robbie Cheadle and Roberta Eaton Cheadle\n\nHello, my name is Robbie, short for Roberta.
