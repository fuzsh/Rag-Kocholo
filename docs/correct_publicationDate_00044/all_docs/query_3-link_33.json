        "text": "I love me a reading challenge. I rarely finish them but it doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy trying. And sometimes they do help motivate me.\n\nI’m borrowing this challenge from the Captain at The Captain’s Quarters. I’m using it to help me catch up on books and authors I should have already read a very, very long time ago. I listed the number of ratings each book has on GoodReads after the title and author. I thought it would be fun to see how many others have read them before me. Spoiler: Eight of them have more than 100,000 ratings, and all but one have more than 10,000 ratings.\n\nThese are books that seem destined (or maybe already are) considered to be classics of the genre. Books that for some reason or other I keep putting off. Maybe the blurb doesn’t speak to me the way I want it to or I already attempted them multiple times (I’m looking at you The Name of the Wind) and just never finished, but didn’t dislike enough to officially DNF.\n\n11/22/63 by Stephen King : 386,635 – This is the oldest book on my TBR. I own it. It was one of the first I added to GoodReads back in 2015. I think it’s the time travel that’s putting me off. I realized a couple years ago time travel and all it’s wonderfully mind bending paradoxes sort of puts me off.\n\nThe Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle #1) by Patrick Rothfuss : 642,245 – I’ve started listening to this multiple times. I even made it like halfway through on a road trip to Ohio once. It’s just so long. Also- I’m putting it back on Rothfuss since there’s no third book in sight.\n\nBlood of Elves (The Witcher #3) by Andrzej Sapkowski : 62,301 – I was reading these before the show was a thing. Right after I sank like 500 hours into the very wonderful Witcher 3: Wild Hunt video game. I don’t know why I keep putting it off. I was excited for this too since it’s the first full length novel set in the Witcherverse.\n\nSeveneves by Neal Stephenson : 83,654 – This one is just intimidating because of it’s length. And the fact that it’s hard science fiction. Which always goes over my head.\n\nAll Systems Red (The Murderbot Diaries #1) by Martha Wells : 45,161 – There’s a lot of Murderbot love circulating out there. But I heard that Murderbot likes to watch TV (who doesn’t?) and I became a little concerned it wasn’t going to be what I wanted it to be. My expectations have been reset, which is a good thing, but also caused me to drag my feet in picking it up.\n\nThe Winter King (The Warlord Chronicles #1) by Bernard Cornwell : 34,056 – I don’t even have a good reason for not having read this one. Favorite author. Favorite subject. Good reviews. It was actually pretty hard to find (I wanted to purchase it and no bookstore ever seemed to have it). I did finally track down a copy, I just need to make the time.\n\nLeviathan Wakes (The Expanse #1) by James S.A. Corey : 142,112 – Why are there so many books in this series? The thought of reading all nine is a little daunting, but I know this is well loved by several readers I trust. And hey- maybe by the time I finish the series will be complete.\n\nGardens of the Moon (Malazan Book of the Fallen #1) by Steven Erikson : 82,296 – I’ve heard this book comes with a steep learning curve, which is why I’ve put it off for so long. But now that I’m thinking of it, the same could be and has been said of two of my other favorites: Too Like the Lightning and Ninefox Gambit. So who knows. Maybe it’ll be a surprise favorite.\n\nThe Shining and Doctor Sleep by Stephen King : 1,027,773 & 165,444 – I wanted to read both before seeing the new Doctor Sleep movie (and maybe The Shining). I’ve started The Shining at least twice that I remember. It’s just so darn slow. But it’s hard to feel like a real Stephen King fan when I haven’t read it. So. 2020 will be the year.\n\nChildren of Time (Children of Time #1) by Adrian Tchaikovsky : 43,448 – I started this during a bad reading slump and just never finished. Not because it wasn’t good, I got further with this than I did any other book during that reading slump. But somehow it’s always harder to go back to something you’ve started previously. Anyway- this book gets lots of love in my virtual book club so it’s becoming a priority.\n\nOryx and Crake (MaddAddam #1) by Margaret Atwood : 207,217 – Here’s a super shameful secret. I’ve never read a single thing Margaret Atwood. A lot of it has to do with her attitude toward genre fiction and her insistence that she doesn’t write it. It just feels really disrespectful to her readers, not to mention seriously out of touch. Anyway- I don’t have much interest in The Handmaid’s Tale though I would like to check it out someday so I’m going with this one.\n\nMalice (The Faithful and the Fallen #1) by John Gwynne : 13,583 – After coming to the sad conclusion the Abercrombie is not quite what I’m looking for, I’m hoping Gwynne will fill the void.\n\nSins of Empire (Gods of Blood and Powder #1) by Brian McClellan : 9,573 – Military Fantasy. I realize it’s not something that everyone gets excited about, but when the action scenes are written well I think it’s probably one of my favorite subgenres. I have high hopes for this.\n\nAssassin’s Apprentice (Farseer Trilogy #1) by Robin Hobb : 212,259 – She has written so much that I think I really just didn’t know where to start with Hobb. This might not be the best place, but I already own it, so…\n\nThe Way of Kings (The Stormlight Archive #1) by Brandon Sanderson : 255,777 – I’ve never read Sanderson. And honestly just the blurb has me cringing away in fear. But it has all these awards and a super high rating and like everyone has read it except me… So I’m obligated, right?\n\nBlood Song (Raven’s Shadow #1) by Anthony Ryan : 66,267 – Ryan has been on my radar a long time. I finally read something by him last year, A Pilgrimage of Swords. It was a quick novella and not necessarily one of my favorites, but it was because I wanted more of what I’d read. Hoping this scratches that itch.\n\nThe Hundred Thousand Kingdoms (Inheritance Trilogy #1) by N.K. Jemisin : 46,482 – This series isn’t nearly as popular as Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy, but I tried The Fifth Season and it just didn’t grab me the way I wanted it to. I think the abused children sucked a lot of the joy out of it for me. But I do like her style and I think this one might be more my speed.\n\nThe Collapsing Empire (The Interdependency #1) by John Scalzi : 30,774 – Nope. Haven’t read Scalzi either. This is likely to be a group read for February, so I might as well read him in a group setting and see what all the fuss is about.\n\nThe Word for World is Forest (Hainish Cycle #5) by Ursula K. Le Guin : 14,121 – I actually have read Le Guin before. I wasn’t a huge fan of A Wizard of Earthsea – but it was a middle grade book and I don’t have a great history with YA or children’s books anyway, so I’m willing to give her another shot. Especially knowing how well loved she is. I picked this one to continue with because I love a good forest setting.\n\nAnd there it is! My 20 in ’20. I’m really excited for some of these and feeling pretty hesitant on others, but either way, I hope to be more educated in my two favorite genres come 2021. Many thanks again to the Captain for letting me tag along with my own Ports for Plunder.\n\nHave you read any of these? Are there any super popular books out there you haven’t read yet?\n\nTop Ten Tuesday was created by The Broke and the Bookish in June of 2010 and was moved to That Artsy Reader Girl in January of 2018. It was born of a love of lists, a love of books, and a desire to bring bookish friends together.\n\nIf It Bleeds by Stephen King (expected May 5, 2020) – This is the next novel in the Holly Gibney series. I haven’t even really read the blurb- but like all new Stephen King books, I’m super excited for it.\n\nThe Girl and the Stars by Mark Lawrence (expected April 21, 2020) – Ugh – This year is going to be my year to catch up on all things Mark Lawrence. I might even reread Prince of Thorns. I’m super excited for this one, even if I likely won’t get to it right away.\n\nThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes by Suzanne Collins (expect May 19, 2020) – This prequel feels like it is finally my chance to join in with everyone’s love for The Hunger Games. I never read the books because I loved the movie so much. I’m sure this book will get a movie too, but I plan to read the book first this time.\n\nA Conjuring of Assassins by Cate Glass (expected February 4, 2020) – This is the sequel to last year’s An Illusion of Thieves. I loved that one and I’m confident I’ll love this one too.\n\nEden by Tim Lebbon (expected April 7, 2020) – I’d tell you what this is about but I stopped reading after it said eco-thriller. It made me think of another favorite author, Michael Crichton.\n\nThe Kingdom of Liars by Nick Martell (expected May 5, 2020) – This book is set in a world where magic is paid for in memories. I’m both curious and hesitant about this one. I can see it being really fantastic, but I can also see the premise setting the book up for trouble. Are there armies of people who remember nothing? How does that work? Is magic used sparingly? I’m remaining cautiously optimistic.\n\nThe City We Became by N.K. Jemisin (expected March 24, 2020) – This novel is based on a short story that was included in Jemisin’s How Long Til Black Future Month? which released last year. While I wasn’t sure I quite liked that particular story, I loved the concept and I’m hopeful that with a full length novel she can answer some of the questions I had about it.\n\nThese last three I’ve all mentioned in previous posts, which I’ve linked to below in case you missed them or would like to check them out again.\n\nThe Wolf of Oren-Yaro by K.S. Villoso (expected February 18, 2020)\n\nThe Book of Koli by M.R. Carey (expected April 14, 2020)\n\nThe Only Good Indians by Stephen Graham Jones (expected May 19, 2020)\n\nWhat are your most anticipated releases for the first half of the year? Leave me a link below so I can check them out!\n\nRating: ★★★★\n\nIn November I hit a really, really bad reading slump. It was a combination of things, work, stress, other hobbies catching my interest (I waited eight years for Red Dead Redemption 2- I earned some game time), and of course, the holidays. But now I’m finding it super hard to get back in the habit of reading.\n\nI was worried a short story collection was going to be too easy to pick up and put back down (and therefore walk away from) but I shouldn’t have. This is a truly beautiful collection of stories and I am so grateful to have read it. (And it only took me five days- progress!) If you are a fan of Jemisin’s, or if you’ve ever been interested but haven’t taken the plunge, this is a must read.\n\nI was iffy about The Fifth Season. I didn’t see what people loved so much about it. I was upset at the treatment of children in the book. But so many people love The Broken Earth trilogy, that my feelings toward it made me question if I’d read it wrong. The jury is still out, but I’ll definitely give it another chance.\n\nFirst, I want to say that Jemisin’s creativity and skill as an author really shine in this book. There are some running themes, but every story felt unique and different. The characters felt distinct. The book starts with a phenomenal and heartfelt introduction about the struggles she faced as a beginning author, so if you tend to skip intros, don’t, this one is quick and well worth reading.\n\nIt opens with: “The Ones Who Stay And Fight”, she says is a response to a LeGuin story (Omelas?). I had not read LeGuin’s story and so I don’t think I understood this one very well, and I’m having a hard time recalling any details about it now. “The City Born Great” comes next. It was a little more on the abstract side and as a story I just didn’t love it. The writing was phenomenal though.\n\n“Red Dirt Witch” stands out as being one of my absolute favorites. Following the first two stories it really showcased her versatility as a writer because it definitely had a folk tale type feel as opposed to the frenetic, urban feel of the prior story. The ending was killer.\n\n“L’Alchemista” was another favorite. It’s about food and love of food, and felt very rustic. It also made me super nostalgic for my mom’s cooking. Aside from that it was just really fun. “The Effluent Engine” comes next, and while an excellent story, it reminded me a lot of “The Black Gods Drums”. Nothing wrong with that- I loved the TBGD, but it maybe felt a little too familiar and I was left wanting a little something more.\n\n“Cloud Dragon Skies” delves a little into the sci-fi realm, but the world in it evoked a lot of the same feeling that I got from reading “The Fifth Season”, an overarching threat of doom, grim tone, etc. I enjoyed this one and especially the ending. “The Trojan Girl” is also more sci-fi than fantasy, but also one of her more abstract pieces. I liked the overall message, but wasn’t crazy about the story itself. “Valedictorian” is another SF/dystopian piece that definitely has a haunting message.\n\n“The Storyteller’s Replacement” I actually can’t recall very well, but I remember thinking that I thought it made for a good interlude in the book, which makes me think it wasn’t a very strictly structured short story. “The Brides of Heaven” is about a group of women who land on a planet that seems to be killing all the males. It’s an open ended story (which aren’t my favorite) but in this case, because the time investment wasn’t significant, I was okay with it. The feelings it evokes are definitely sort of eerie and spooky and it will stick with me for awhile.\n\n“The Evaluators” I loved. Jemisin mentioned in the intro she enjoyed writing short stories because it gave her an opportunity to experiment and I think this piece is one of those. It’s told through a series of memos/logs and was precisely the kind of sci-fi/horror story that I love. “Walking Awake” also ventures into horror (content warnings for child trauma/violence) and wasn’t a favorite for me although again, I loved the message.\n\n“The Elevator Dancer” is a quick story that almost felt like it could have been a spin off of Orwell’s 1984. I liked this a lot more than I liked 1984.\n\nWe shift gears back to fantasy with “Cuisine des Memoires” and it stands out as another favorite in the book. Kind of a love letter to the power food can have in our lives (or at least in our memories). I kind of also got the message that food is one of the oldest ways in the world to show you care for someone. Whether just by sharing it or by putting your heart on a plate.\n\n“Stone Hunger” is a prelude to The Fifth Season that I actually enjoyed a lot more than the book itself. I sort of wish I’d read it first because I think I would have appreciated what came next much more.\n\n“On the Banks of the River Lex” was very reminiscent of Gaiman’s American Gods and not in a bad way. I absolutely love the concept and love the way she portrayed Death. “The Narcomancer” was just meh for me, but I liked the ending.\n\n“Henosis” is another experimental story told non-linearly that worked really well in short story format. The ending is another ambiguous one but I liked the format enough not to care. It also draws some interesting conclusions about celebrity in America.\n\n“Too Many Yesterdays, Not Enough Tomorrows” is a sci-fi story with a super original concept that I thoroughly enjoyed (the title is a hint). “The You Train” is another abstract piece but again I loved the message. The Nike slogan “Just Do It” comes to mind, and I also found it super relatable because if I didn’t have a child at home, I think I’d board The You Train myself.\n\n“Non-Zero Probabilities” was about exactly that, non-zero probabilities. It was definitely interesting, but coming at the end of so many other fantastic stories, not a standout to me. We close with “Sinners, Saints, Dragons, and Haints, in the City Beneath the Still Waters”. This was a favorite, and one of the only stories that made me really care about the characters. It’s about some (fictional) odd happenings during and after Hurricane Katrina, and while that storm and it’s destruction were no joke, I found the story itself really hopeful, and the overall tone fairly light (probably gross misunderstandings on my part).\n\nI think each story had something to offer and all of them were well worth reading. Jemisin is a master at evoking tone and feeling with her writing. Even in the stories I didn’t love, she still managed to make me feel something, and I think that’s especially difficult to do in short stories."
