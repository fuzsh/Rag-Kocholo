        "text": "Science fiction or sci-fi is a subgenre of fiction that revolves around settings that explore potential technological advancement in the world and the consequences of that technology. In science fiction, the reasoning behind the rules and logic of the fiction world is science. Otherwise, it’s called fantasy writing if the reasoning behind them is a supernatural force.\n\nScience fiction writers can be found online on freelancer platforms like fiverr, upwork, guru etc. But if you’re looking for a more personalized experience, authenticity of work, assurance of timely delivery, and extra services like editing, proofreading, illustrating, publishing etc, it is preferred to look for dedicated ghostwriters’ websites.\n\nIn science fiction, a writer who’s experienced in this genre is desirable, especially for long-form writing. Sci-fi requires consistency of established rules and logic, intricate worldbuilding, and a decent amount of scientific knowledge and technology. The best science fiction writers in the market will check all of these requirements.\n\nFiction is a very broad term for creative prose as opposed to factual. Fiction can be divided into a large number of genres. All of those genres share some common elements which can be used to classify fiction into major types based on their themes.\n\nMystery\n\nThriller\n\nRomance\n\nFantasy\n\nScience Fiction"
