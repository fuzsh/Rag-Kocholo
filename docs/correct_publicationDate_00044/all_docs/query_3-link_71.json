        "text": "Your first and second points do a great job highlighting possible reason why we don't see these two genres come together. I think with book writing, you lose so much of the visual queues that come with humor so the write has to likely rely even more on dialogue. A story with a lot of dialogue can be a good read, but how much action is paused during those pages? That might be where the overall vision is lost if not balanced well in the story.\n\nRick and Morty works well using modern humor, but I think the talent of Dan Harmon's writing. Futurama is interesting because it was placed 1000 years in the future, but all of the references were 21st century. The show was funny, but the references just don't work with the setting. That always stuck out to me.\n\nI wonder if the comic book medium is best since you get to right your story while having the visual aspect?\n\nMarvel's Guardians of the Galaxy looks like a great example\n\nMost of the comedy elements I read in science fiction seem to be unintended.\n\nMy brain creates the image as its written but fills in the detail gaps.\n\nThe resulting impression can sometimes be comical.\n\nOne of my favorite authors was Douglas Adams.\n\nAs for film, there is a lot of scifi-comedy out there to watch. Think Red Dwarf, Galaxy Quest, Space Balls, stuff like that. There's many that can give me a chuckle intentionally.\n\nNearly every syfy original movie is comedy, sometimes intended, sometimes not intended.\n\nThe Asylum makes money by creating low-budget knock-offs of block busters that are referred to as \"mockbusters\".\n\nTruly brilliant science fiction has a story that illicits many emotional elements and takes you for a roller coaster ride. The story is written so well it takes you on an emotional adventure and leaves you wanting more.\n\nWhen I look for book examples, it's difficult to find many examples.\n\nDouglas Adams\n\nKurt Vonnegut Jr\n\nHarry Harrison\n\nSpider Robinson\n\nNeal Stephenson\n\nJohn Scalzi\n\nLois McMaster Bujold\n\nRobert Asprin\n\nStanislaw Lem\n\nTerry Pratchett\n\nPiers Anthony\n\nPhillip J Farmer\n\nPoul Anderson\n\nRobert Rankin\n\nJust to name a few...\n\nSome books? well here is a few...\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #1)\n\nby Douglas Adams\n\nTo\n\nMostly Harmless (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #5)\n\nby Douglas Adams A five book series that is downright hilarious.\n\nInfinity Welcomes Careful Drivers (Red Dwarf #1)\n\nby Grant Naylor\n\nSlaughterhouse-Five\n\nby Kurt Vonnegut Jr.\n\nCat's Cradle\n\nby Kurt Vonnegut Jr.\n\nThe Stainless Steel Rat (Stainless Steel Rat, #4)\n\nby Harry Harrison\n\nCallahan's Crosstime Saloon (Callahan's #1)\n\nby Spider Robinson\n\nWar of the Coffee Bean (Alienbutt Saga, #1)\n\nby Glenn Scrimshaw\n\nThe Cyberiad\n\nby Stanisław Lem\n\nPhule's Company (Phule's Company, #1)\n\nby Robert Lynn Asprin\n\nThe Futurological Congress: From the Memoirs of Ijon Tichy\n\nby Stanisław Lem\n\nBill, the Galactic Hero (Bill, #1)\n\nby Harry Harrison\n\nJohn Dies at the End (John Dies at the End, #1)\n\nby David Wong\n\nVenus on the Half-Shell\n\nby Philip José Farmer\n\nHoka! Hoka! Hoka!\n\nby Poul Anderson\n\nEmperor Mollusk versus The Sinister Brain\n\nby A. Lee Martinez\n\nThe Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of the Apocalypse\n\nby Robert Rankin\n\nJob: A Comedy of Justice\n\nby Robert A. Heinlein\n\nStrata\n\nby Terry Pratchett\n\nCodgerspace\n\nby Alan Dean Foster\n\nThere is but a few examples I listed out of thousands.\n\nI wonder if the comic book medium is best\n\nComic books is where I really got my first science fiction reading passion.\n\nThey lead me to young reader books then on to full novels and novel series.\n\nThere is a wealth of really great science fiction in Graphic Novels, which are like comic books on steroids.\n\nBlack Science, Volume 1: How To Fall Forever\n\nBook by Rick Remender\n\nSpace Riders, Volume 1: Vengeful Universe\n\nBook by Fabian Rangel\n\nMaggie the Mechanic: A Love and Rockets Book\n\nBook by Jaime Hernandez\n\nUFOlogy\n\nBook by James Tynion IV\n\nAs for well-known authors, nearly every science fiction author has at least one book in scifi comedy. Usually published as a distraction work or a brain refresher work during or right after a large series.\n\nThanks for the list of authors for me to look at! The great science fiction stories really do bring out so much more emotion. Science fiction comes with a lot of freedom for characters and plot for a story teller The great stories certainly show that.\n\nOh, I agree.\n\nThe truly great authors have the versatility to incorporate nearly any genre element into their stories.\n\nTo me, a book is really good if it makes you laugh, cry, get mad and feel justified.\n\nI've read books that make me feel like I have been in an emotional test chamber and felt tuckered out emotionally when done.\n\nWhat really gets my goat is the syfy channel.\n\nThere is a whole generation or two of people that 'think' syfy represents science fiction.\n\nWhen it was The Science Fiction Channel it had great and cutting edge shows that actually represented science fiction. Then it became SciFi and things started going downhill from there. Now, it's nearly unwatchable from a science fiction perspective.\n\nPeople that should be reading science fiction are now turning away because the syfy channel is stupid.\n\nThey make the correlation that syfy is science fiction and lose interest before actually looking at the real science fiction.\n\nThey have no idea what is actually out there because they never 'think' to look into it."
