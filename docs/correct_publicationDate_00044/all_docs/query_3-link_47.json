        "text": "Dead Like Me\n\na TV series review by Lisa DuMond\n\nYou can undoubtedly tell from the title of this new TV series that it has a lot to do with death. What you might not know yet is that it has much more to do with life, and what we do with ours, than it has to do with dead bodies, cemeteries, etc. Even with a brilliant cast playing some of the most memorable characters in years, the star of the show is humanity and how we deal with death -- from both sides of the grave.\n\nCities edited by Peter Crowther\n\nreviewed by Steven H Silver\n\nThe editor has been publishing excellent novellas for the past few years, including the Sidewise Award-winning The Human Front by Ken MacLeod. He's also begun collecting these novellas into books of four for those who aren't able to find the limited run chapbooks in their initial form. Four such stories were collected into the anthology Futures, and now he has collected four more here.\n\nSF Site News\n\ncompiled by Steven H Silver\n\nEvery day, items of interest to you arrive in our email. Our bi-monthly format doesn't lend itself to daily updates. However, this is a small inconvenience to our Contributing Editor Steven H Silver. He's begun a new column which will fill you in on recent news in science fiction. We'll be updating the page as he sends in new items.\n\nFull Unit Hookup, Spring 2003\n\nreviewed by Rich Horton\n\nThe opening story, \"Waiting for Jenny Rex\", by Melissa Yuan-Innes, is very fine work. The story is told by a reporter who falls in love with the title character, a dead anorexic girl returned from the grave with a mission to inform about her disease. Yuan-Innes deftly negotiates the creepy aspects, the affecting aspects, and the funny aspects of her tale, as complications result when other dead return with other diseases to battle.\n\nBlood of the Tribe by David S. Brody\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nIt has been less than four years since the author broke into the thriller genre with Unlawful Deeds. So, why does it seem so much longer? Well, with a debut as exceptional as his, it just leaves you starving for more. Not that you could really say the story is more of the same; this sophomore effort manages to exceed its predecessor in every area. Quite simply, he went from a smashing novel to an even more irresistible story.\n\nMilky Way Marmalade by Mike DiCerto\n\nreviewed by Georges T. Dodds\n\nCaffrey Quark, retired interplanetary hunter and purveyor of exotic meats is just innocently travelling through space when he comes across a drifting jukebox. Upon hearing the late 60s-early 70s rock music borne upon the strange black discs, he undergoes a spiritual epiphany and books a trip through time to mid-60s New York City, to live the music as a member of the progressive rock group Milky Way Marmalade. But a Gallagher Plus-like android with a few loose circuits, its un-deceased creator, a dog-like counter-tyranny operative, and a hovering ship's-computer entity, not to mention Nefarious Wretch, a music-hating fascist-megalomaniac, have other plans.\n\nGeeks With Books\n\na column by Rick Klaw\n\nRick is off on his whirlwind tour promoting his new book Geek Confidential: Echoes From the 21st Century. He will return with a new column soon. Until then, enjoy this reprint from the Geek archives.\n\nStar Wars: Shatterpoint by Matthew Stover\n\nreviewed by David Maddox\n\nMace Windu, though unhappy with the turn the Republic has taken, believes the time-honored code of his Order will help guide him through this turbulent time. But now that the Clone War has begun, do the ideals held by the Jedi still apply? Is it possible there's no place for them in this new, war-torn cosmos? Windu will have to journey into the darkest reaches of a primitive jungle to face his own shadows, if he hopes to find an answer.\n\nThe Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, June 2003\n\nreviewed by Steve Lazarowitz\n\nOut of all the stories, \"The Tale of the Golden Eagle\" is the only one Steve would consider a must read, but there turned out to be enough good work in the issue to give it a thumbs up in general. If you're a Malzberg fan, you'll have the time of your life. If you're not, you're not likely to become one reading this issue.\n\nYear Zero by Brian Stableford\n\nreviewed by Ian Nichols\n\nThere are sufficient resonances in here to please the most demanding musician, and sufficient icons to populate an Orthodox church. Elvis Presley, Men in Black, Grey Aliens, Angels, Demons, and the Devil himself, all dressed in their garb of late 20th century finery, the tatterdemalion glory in which their billions of believers dressed them. It is the year 2000, and they're still hanging around like Banquo's ghost. Somebody has to sort it all out before the Satan's plan comes to fruition and the world ends, so to speak, on New Year's Eve, 2000. The job falls to Molly.\n\nAmerican Beauty by Allen Steele\n\nreviewed by Steven H Silver\n\nDemonstrating his versatility in this collection, not only does the author provide the reader with hard science fiction stories, but he also incorporates humor in many of the stories, beginning with the Hugo-nominated \"Agape Among the Robots\" and continuing through \"Tom Swift and His Humongous Mechanical Dude.\"\n\nDating Secrets of the Dead by David Prill\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nAh, the simple pleasures of small town life. That first, awkward date with the girl of your dreams. The excitement when the carnival comes to town. Those endless days of waiting for the traveling spook show to roll back through again. It's practically a Norman Rockwell painting... until this author gets ahold of it. Then, homespun and na√Øve go crashing through the window as a whole new world sets up camp.\n\nNew Arrivals\n\ncompiled by Neil Walsh\n\nThe past few weeks has brought new books from David & Leigh Eddings, Harry Turtledove, Spider Robinson, Sarah Ash, and new editions of old favourites from Jack Vance and Robert Heinlein. Some of the forthcoming books in the next while include new novels from Terry Pratchett, Caitl√≠n R. Kiernan, Karin Lowachee, and new collections from Nancy Kress and George Alec Effinger.\n\nBabylon 5.1\n\nTV reviews by Rick Norwood\n\nRick offers his thoughts on two classic SF DVDs; The Thing From Another World written by Charles Lederer and The Day the Earth Stood Still by Edmund H. North. \"Klaatu barada nikto!\"\n\nWhite Crow by Mary Gentle\n\nreviewed by David Soyka\n\nThis is a compendium of three loosely interlinked novels (Rats and Gargoyles, Left to His Own Devices, and The Architecture of Desire), as well as three short stories (\"Beggars in Satin,\" \"The Knot Garden,\" and \"Black Motley\"). They feature, for the most part, expert swordswoman and magical healer Valentine along with her lover/husband, Lord-Architect Baltazar Casaubon. Their adventures take place in multiple universes -- a Renaissance-like steampunk realm in which humans subservient to a race of anthropomorphic rats are lorded over by a collective of thirty-six sphinx-like creatures, a near-future cybertech England and an 18th century London torn in a civil war between female-led Puritan and Monarchist factions -- sharing a framework in which magic works according to the principle of Hemeretic science, a 17th century heresy.\n\nTropic of Night by Michael Gruber\n\nreviewed by Cindy Lynn Speer\n\nJane Doe is on the run from forces that most of us can't comprehend. She's running from her husband. Once, she was an anthropologist who studied an elusive tribe whose women practiced magic and slept with spirits. After an incident made her feel as if she were losing her mind, she fled for home where she met the handsome and promising poet, Witt Moore. They marry and live an enviable lifestyle until they are offered a trip to Africa to study the Yoruba. What they find is so much more. Witt, wanting to immerse himself into his African heritage is all too eager to go.\n\nDungeons and Dragons Core Rule Books (v3.5)\n\na gaming review by Mike Thibault\n\nThe latest version of the game is in stores now and it has been received by the gaming community with mixed feelings. It is neither a fully new edition of the game, nor a minor tweak to smooth out the rough edges of the existing edition. It is somewhere in between and probably has something to disappoint everyone. Granted, there is probably something that will please everyone too, but a lot of people were pretty pleased with the 3rd edition as it stood."
