        "text": "Welcome to TRB Lounge. Today, I’d like to welcome the author ofThe Lighthouse—Karin Ciholas, from Atmosphere Press, for an author interview with The Reading Bud.\n\nAbout The Author\n\nKarin Ciholas was born in Virginia and grew up in Switzerland where she studied classical languages. The study of Latin and Greek led to her fascination with the ancient world and its history. She earned advanced degrees in languages and comparative literature at UNC Chapel Hill and enjoyed teaching modern languages and courses on the ancient world. She has won twelve awards for her short stories and plays. She lives in Sarasota with her husband, author and theologian Paul Ciholas.\n\nInterview\n\nWelcome to TRB! Please give our readers a brief introduction about yourself before we begin.\n\nMy father sang Norwegian songs to me and told me stories about his native Norway. My mother told me about her “old Kentucky home” where she grew up. As a child in Switzerland, I learned the Swiss dialect from my school friends, and all my courses were taught in German. All my life, I have been grateful for my gifted teachers in the Swiss school system that placed great emphasis on Greek and Latin and gave me a lifelong love of classical antiquity and ancient history. We spoke English at home, but the first class I ever had in English was when I came to the US to go to college. On a student trip to Rome, I fell in love with a young theology student from France, and when we married four years later, we lived in France for several years. After completing advanced degrees, we chose teaching careers in the US: Paul to teach religion and philosophy at universities in Kentucky and I to teach languages and humanities at Centre College. And that is how we ended up in “our new Kentucky home.”\n\nPlease tell us something about your book other than what we have read in the blurb?\n\nThe Lighthouse is about a dedicated Jewish physician named Simon who wants to heal and save lives and make the world a better place. But he is thwarted and opposed by violence and racism. Antisemitism rears its ugly head. He fights back at every turn. He fights against vicious criminals, against arbitrary Roman power, and against the injustices of racism. He struggles for freedom for his fellow Jews. One of the battles he cares most about is his struggle to find better ways to treat illness. When his sister is abducted and sold into slavery, he starts his fight against slavery. It is a deeply personal battle that endangers his family. It is a battle he cannot win.\n\nHe is a witness to several historical events that profoundly changed the world. He is neither responsible for those events, nor can he intervene to stop them. During the first pogrom of recorded history in Alexandria, Egypt, Simon tries but cannot stop the massacre. He does manage to save many lives.\n\nWhat is that one message that you’re trying to get across to the readers in this book?\n\nThe fight against prejudice, racism, and antisemitism is never done. Prejudices against fellow human beings have distorted human behavior since Cain and Abel, and wars and hatred in the name of religion still mar our history and continue to cause havoc. Simon, the physician who seeks to heal, cannot find the way to cut this defect out of the human heart. And yet he tries. Boldly, Simon fights for justice for his family and his people. When Simon plunges into danger, we worry about him. Sometimes we want to shake him and talk sense into him. We are moved by historical drama where life and death are at stake. His urgent fight for justice is never done. At stake, for him, is the survival of his people. Despite many setbacks, Simon brings healing to many. We all need healing.\n\nWho is your favourite character in this book and why?\n\nAurelia is my favorite character because she is strong. In many ways, she is stronger than Simon even though Simon does not see it that way. She often protects him, assists him in saving lives during the pogrom, and is not intimidated even when the emperor or the prefect of Egypt opposes her. There are several strong women who sometimes quietly and other times quite theatrically make a difference. Antonia, sister-in-law of Tiberius, saves Rome from an upstart tyrant who wants to take over the imperial throne. One of my favorite characters is Sosias, an orphan Simon rescues who has irrepressible curiosity and sets out to become an engineer. Through him, I show some of the scientific and technological advances of the times.\n\nWhat inspired you to write this book? An idea, some anecdote, a dream or something else?\n\nMy Mother was a discerning and avid reader. She enjoyed reading my short stories and plays but complained she couldn’t find enough historical fiction set in New Testament times. She asked if I had ever thought about writing a novel about one of the characters in the New Testament who knew Jesus. I told her I was intrigued by Simon of Cyrene. I mentioned Simon did not really know Jesus, that he met Jesus under the most excruciating circumstances and that Simon was an unusual Jew since he gave his children Roman and Greek names. She turned to me and said, “Well, Karin, when will you write his story?”\n\nHow long did it take you to write this particular book?\n\nIt took about 15 years. During a demanding teaching career, I kept my mother’s request in mind, enjoyed studying primary sources in ancient history, and discovered so many jewels of information I could use for the novel she wanted. When I finished the first chapter, I sent it to her in the mail. Then she kept wanting more. I sent chapter by chapter until 1000 pages landed in her mailbox. There have been many changes since, but the basic bones of the novel are still there. A wise agent told me the book needed to be divided into a trilogy.\n\nWhat are your writing ambitions? Where do you see yourself 5 years from today?\n\nI hope to get the next two books in the trilogy into shape for publication. Between initial concept—even if on paper—and completion much needs to be done. After that, I may turn back to a historical novel I’m writing set during WWII. I have also ghostwritten several memoirs for veterans of WWII and helped them with the logistics of publishing. Alas, more and more vets are leaving us without having told their stories.\n\nAre you working on any other stories presently?\n\nHistory provides an endless source of material. My favorite era is the first century when so much was going on. I like to take a character like Simon and show events through his eyes, making him a witness to the great events that occurred in his lifetime: the rise of science in Alexandria, the power of the Roman empire, amazing advances in medicine that will later be lost for centuries, the crucifixion of Jesus, the beginnings of Christianity, the fall of the temple…. I might write a story about another historical character from that time.\n\nWhy have you chosen this genre? Or do you write in multiple genres?\n\nI’ve written and published short stories and poems in literary journals, and five of my plays have been performed. But historical fiction is my preferred genre for reading and writing. Faulkner said: “The past is never dead…It’s not even past.”\n\nWhen did you decide to become a writer? Was it easy for you follow your passion or did you have to make some sacrifices along the way?\n\nI have always loved books. As children, my brother and I even started a little library and made library cards for each book he owned and each book I owned. When my mother discovered he was charging me a penny to read his books, and I charged nothing, she put a stop to his enterprise but not a stop to our reading. The impulse to write was first evident when I started rewriting the endings of stories I didn’t like. From there it was a logical step to just make up my own stories. From those childish beginnings came the urge to write short stories. All my first attempts at publishing them were rejected. I am sure the editors of the journals did me a favor by rejecting them. I started subscribing to the best literary journals and began to learn what was getting published. I also learned that what one publisher rejects can be submitted elsewhere and be accepted.\n\nWhat is your writing ritual? How do you do it?\n\nWhen I go to my computer in the morning, I read the news and check the last sentences I wrote the day before. Reading the news is quickly depressing. So, I turn to my writing. Writing makes me feel involved in the whole story of humanity. Research is exciting. I am in a different century. Except…some current events are not always that different from what was going on in the Roman empire.\n\nHow do you prefer to write – computer/laptop, typewriter, dictation or longhand with a pen?\n\nI started out with pen and paper. All writing is now on the computer.\n\nWhat are your 5 favourite books? (You can share 5 favourite authors too.)\n\nAny book by Sharon Kay Penman. One special favorite: Here Be Dragons. She makes Welsh history come alive.\n\nBooks by Margaret George. She is the doyenne of historical fiction, the astute researcher who makes major historical characters live and breathe. The Autobiography of Henry VIII with Notes by his Fool, Will Somers is a compelling saga. The Prologue alone is a masterpiece of historical and psychological insights.\n\nBooks by Tan Twan Eng. The Gift of Rain is set in Malaysia during WWII. A beautifully written novel filled with mystery and wonder.\n\nBooks by Mark Helprin. Paris in the Present Tense is a personal favorite. Helprin’s writing is lyrical, visual, hauntingly beautiful, entrancing.\n\nBooks by Geraldine Brooks. My favorite new book this year: Horse. There are many levels of meaning in this book, woven together into a fine masterpiece. Brooks is a versatile writer who makes time travel to distant shores and times sound easy.\n\nHow do you deal with Writer’s Block?\n\nLife can intervene. That’s ok. I just had cancer surgery a week ago. I need times when I must be gentle with myself. When at an impasse, I go to some writers I love most and reread my favorite passages and follow the flow of their sentences through a dramatic sequence and try to learn from them. If inspiration doesn’t come quickly, I like to sit in my garden or take a walk. The silliest thing I do is tell the story to my stuffed bear and explain what I want to do in the next scene. By the time I have told him, I often know what to do. I have a very intelligent bear, and he often warns me not to overthink it.\n\nWhat advice would you give to aspiring writers?\n\nBesides getting an intelligent stuffed bear? Read, read, and read good writers you enjoy. After your enjoyment, take time to analyze why the writing moves you or inspires you or why it makes you smile or cry. Remember 3 p’s: perseverance, passion, and professionalism. It takes perseverance to complete a work and see it through the many steps toward publication. So don’t give up. If you are not passionate about your subject, your reader will not be. And if there is no passion in your main characters, they will not be interesting. Professionalism requires following the rules of submission to the letter, proper language use or having someone help with that, and being attentive and appreciative to those who give you advice, especially if they care enough to give you pointers when you get rejections. There is a fourth p. But you should avoid this one—perfectionism. Maybe Shakespeare wrote the perfect play, but I doubt it. At some point, you must stop the rewriting and editing and send your work out. Perfectionism is an enemy of success.\n\nThank you, author Karin Cicholas, for your insightful answers!\n\nAbout the Book\n\nThe Lighthouse\n\nSimon is a gifted physician who faces constant danger as a Jew in first-century Egypt under Roman rule.\n\nWhen Meidias, an escaped convict, declares a “holy” war against Jews and abducts Simon’s sister, Simon’s search for her leads him on a treacherous journey to slave markets in Alexandria and to Jerusalem where a Roman soldier forces Simon to carry a crossbeam for a stranger. Simon is troubled by the stranger’s death but does not know that this moment will change the world forever.\n\nSimon’s passion is Aurelia, inaccessible daughter of a Roman senator. His mission is revenge against the outlaw Meidias. His ambition is justice for his family and his people. His torment is the conflict between his Hippocratic oath and his vow to kill Meidias.\n\nAs his medical reputation grows, he comes face to face with prefects and emperors and the poor suffering masses of Alexandria and Rome. Overwhelmed by the plight of his people, he tries to stop what becomes the first pogrom in Alexandria.\n\nTHE LIGHTHOUSE moves between Egypt and Italy and back to Alexandria. It is a story about family love and loyalty, medical breakthroughs and heartbreaks, and one man’s quest for justice for his people.\n\nYou can find Balsamic Moon here:\n\nAmazon | Goodreads\n\nIf you are an author and wish to be featured as our guest or if you are a publicist and want to get your author featured on TRB, then please get in touch directly by e-mail at thereadingbud@gmail.com\n\nWelcome to TRB Lounge. Today, I’d like to welcome the author ofBalsamic Moon – Alan Gartenhaus, from Atmosphere Press, for an author interview with The Reading Bud.\n\nAbout The Author\n\nAlan Gartenhaus served as an educator at the New Orleans Museum of Art and Smithsonian Institution, and as a director of Cornish College of the Arts, in Seattle. A recipient of an Alden B. Dow Creativity Fellowship, he created and was the publishing editor of The Docent Educator magazine. His fiction has appeared in numerous literary journals, including Broad River Review, Entropy Magazine, Euphony Journal (University of Chicago), Ignatian Literary Magazine (University of San Francisco), and the Santa Fe Literary Review. His short stories have been awarded with an “Editor’s Choice” distinction, and been designated a finalist in an international competition for Baby Boomer authors by Living Spring Publishers. His nonfiction has been published by Running Press, Smithsonian Press, and Writer’s Workshop Review.\n\nYou can connect with author Alan Gartenhaus here:\n\nAuthor Website\n\nInterview\n\nWelcome to TRB! Please give our readers a brief introduction about yourself before we begin.\n\nThank you for the welcome and for your interest in my novel, Balsamic Moon.\n\nBalsamic Moon takes place in New Orleans. My undergraduate and graduate degrees are from Tulane University, in New Orleans, and my early working years were spent on staff at the New Orleans Museum of Art. I loved my time in that colorful, diverse, richly textured, and exotic city. It was akin to my “first crush,” the place that still makes my heart race whenever I think of it.\n\nToday, many years later, I am seventy, married, and have lived on the island of Hawaii since 1995. In addition to having created, edited, and published a professional journal for museum educators and docents teaching with art, history, and science collections, I’ve spent much of my Hawaii years farming avocados, breadfruit, grapefruit, oranges, and pineapples. Rather than sell our produce, we’ve donated everything beyond what we consumed to local foodbanks.\n\nPlease tell us something about your book other than what we have read in the blurb?\n\n“Balsamic moon” is an astrological term for the final phase of the lunar cycle. It’s considered a dark time of endings, dissolution, and change. I had never heard of a balsamic moon until researching the dates on which the novel takes place and discovered that it occurred during such a lunar phase. The irony of this did not escape me, and ultimately provided the story with its title.\n\nWhat is that one message that you’re trying to get across to the readers in this book?\n\nTo be compassionate and respectful of all people, regardless of how they might differ from you.\n\nWho is your favourite character in this book and why?\n\nI love and care about both of my main characters, but am most fond of Doreen, who struggled to succeed in life, to retain a sense of humor, and to grow despite adverse experiences.\n\nWhat inspired you to write this book? An idea, some anecdote, a dream or something else?\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the inspiration for Balsamic Moon came from watching the experiences and tragedies that befell the citizens of New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina struck, the levees were breached, and floodwaters surged into 80% of the city. Seeing the suffering, the damage, and the ineptitude of our response to the desperation was agonizing. Writing helped me process that pain.\n\nHow long did it take you to write this particular book?\n\nI worked on the manuscript for over eleven years, although not consistently. I would write, put it away, and come back to it months later. I reworked the text many times over those years.\n\nWhat are your writing ambitions? Where do you see yourself 5 years from today?\n\nI want to continue writing both short stories and novels, and hope that my readership, and their interest in my writing, will have grown.\n\nAre you working on any other stories presently?\n\nI am almost always writing––mostly short stories. I am also working on another novel that is presently in an initial, rough draft form.\n\nWhy have you chosen this genre? Or do you write in multiple genres?\n\nAll storytelling interests me but I am most prolific as a writer of short stories. I have had about twenty short stories published. Several of them are shared on my author website: www.alangartenhaus.com.\n\nWhen did you decide to become a writer? Was it easy for you follow your passion or did you have to make some sacrifices along the way?\n\nI can barely remember a time when I didn’t write. As a youngster, a neighbor-kid and I used to write science-fiction stories, alternating paragraphs––he, then me, back-and-forth. Since adolescence, I’ve kept journals, written poems, dashed down stream-of-consciousness thoughts, and recorded personal events. I haven’t had to make sacrifices to write; it’s been folded into my life. It is an integral part of who I am.\n\nMy focus on writing fiction became more serious when we moved to a very rural environment. In addition to providing me with “imaginary friends” to play with, writing offered a balance to daily chores and the physical rigors of farming.\n\nWhat is your writing ritual? How do you do it?\n\nI am an early riser, and routinized person. I write most days, after morning exercises and walks, until lunch. If the writing is going well, I continue into the afternoons; if not, I don’t.\n\nHow do you prefer to write – computer/laptop, typewriter, dictation or longhand with a pen?\n\nWith the exceptions of making notes, or writing a journal entry, both of which are in longhand, all my writing is composed on a laptop.\n\nWhat are your 5 favourite books? (You can share 5 favourite authors too.)\n\nThese are five favorites, not necessarily of all time but that I’ve much enjoyed in the recent past:\n\nEdgar Allan Poe: The Complete Short Stories\n\nShantaram by Gregory David Roberts\n\nThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon\n\nBoy Swallows Universe by Trent Dalton\n\nThe Absolutist by John Boyne\n\nHow do you deal with Writer’s Block?\n\nI wish I had a magic solution, but don’t. Mostly, I agonize, fret, and take long walks.\n\nWhat advice would you give to aspiring writers?\n\nGive your work to readers whose opinions you respect. Listen and learn from criticisms; don’t rigidly defend your choices without understanding what has caused a reader to hesitate, question, or have difficulty. Be flexible.\n\nThank you, author Alan Gartenhaus, for your insightful answers!\n\nAbout the Book\n\nBalsamic Moon\n\nWithin a few short hours, rising floodwaters force next-door neighbors into a desperate fight for survival.\n\nBefore Hurricane Katrina, neighbors Doreen Williams, an African American single mother, and Richard Girard, a reclusive gay man, were aloof and even suspicious of each other. But when the levees in New Orleans burst, these two are sent scrambling into a cramped attic where, together, they face tests of grueling heat, dwindling supplies, worries about loved ones, and the struggle to keep living.\n\nIn his novel Balsamic Moon, author Alan Gartenhaus explores the journeys and losses that survivors endure, the courage and persistence required to come through them, and the truth that, when our very survival depends on the formation of ties across differences, our compassion for one another is what makes us feel safe and whole.\n\nYou can find Balsamic Moon here:\n\nAmazon | Goodreads\n\nIf you are an author and wish to be featured as our guest or if you are a publicist and want to get your author featured on TRB, then please get in touch directly by e-mail at thereadingbud@gmail.com\n\nWelcome to TRB Lounge. Today, I’d like to welcome Teri M. Brown, the author of An Enemy Like Me for an author interview with The Reading Bud.\n\nAbout The Author\n\nTeri M. Brown\n\nBorn in Athens, Greece as an Air Force brat, Teri M Brown came into this world with an imagination full of stories to tell. She now calls the North Carolina coast home, and the peaceful nature of the sea has been a great source of inspiration for her creativity.\n\nNot letting 2020 get the best of her, Teri chose to go on an adventure that changed her outlook on life. She and her husband, Bruce, rode a tandem bicycle across the United States from Astoria, Oregon to Washington DC, successfully raising money for Toys for Tots. She learned she is stronger than she realized and capable of anything she sets her mind to.\n\nTeri is a wife, mother, grandmother, and author who loves word games, reading, bumming on the beach, taking photos, singing in the shower, hunting for bargains, ballroom dancing, playing bridge, and mentoring others.\n\nYou can connect with author Teri M. Brown here:\n\nAuthor Website | Twitter | Facebook | Instagram | YouTube\n\nInterview\n\nWelcome to TRB! Please give our readers a brief introduction about yourself before we begin.\n\nHello! I’m Teri M Brown. Besides being a writer, I’m a wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. My life hasn’t been easy. I’ve been so poor that I the home I lived in had no central heat or air, and I could see the ground between the floorboards in the living room. I was also married to an emotionally abusive man for 14 years and didn’t want to leave because I didn’t want to be seen as a failure. Now, I’m married to a wonderful man who has helped me understand who I am and what I’m meant to be. However, we found out in June that he has an aggressive form of brain cancer, so my life has taken yet another twist as we navigate this journey together. Despite all of this, I am an optimistic person who honestly believes that everything turns out okay in the end. If it’s not okay, then it’s not the end.\n\nPlease tell us something about your book other than what we have read in the blurb?\n\nThe characters are loosely based on my own family. My grandfather is the soldier, Jacob. My grandmother is Bonnie. My father is William. Although I take liberties with their personalities and stories, anyone that knew them in real life would likely recognize them in the book.\n\nWhat is that one message that you’re trying to get across to the readers in this book?\n\nWe are far more like our enemy than we are different from them. I believe that if we look for similarities rather than focus on our differences, we can rid the world of the hatred that splits us up into opposing groups.\n\nWho is your favorite character in this book and why?\n\nMy favorite character is Bonnie because she is a woman ahead of her times. We see a quiet strength in her, and even when she is weak, she eventually rises above it.\n\nWhat inspired you to write this book? An idea, some anecdote, a dream or something else?\n\nMy family is German-American, though we’ve lived in the United States since before the Revolutionary War. My grandfather fought in WWII and ended up in Germany in an area near where our ancestors were from. He rarely talked about the war, but once, when I was a teenager, he said to me, “I always wondered if the person on the other side of the gun was a cousin.” That idea haunted me and became the basis of this book.\n\nHow long did it take you to write this particular book?\n\nMy writing process is something I call word vomit. I don’t use an outline (also called a pantster), and I tend to find a time to write in which I can truly immerse myself for days (I call this binge writing). As a binge pantster, I try to get my story down from start to finish as quickly as possible. Then I let it sit for a while – a month or two – before going back to make substantial edits. When writing An Enemy Like Me, I did the binge pantster part during a two-week writer’s retreat. I completed the edits during a one-week retreat. After going to my editor, I spent another 60 hours or so making the needed changes.\n\nWhat are your writing ambitions? Where do you see yourself 5 years from today?\n\nFive years from now, I hope to have another five books out, for a total of seven. My goal is to write a novel a year. I also hope to have finished my book about our tandem bicycle tour, as well as a children’s book that I’ve promised my grandchildren. Finally, although I have written historical fiction to date, my writing is really character-driven fiction. I hope to branch out and write some other genres including something with a bit of fantasy or even a romantic comedy.\n\nAre you working on any other stories presently?\n\nI am currently working on a manuscript about a healer woman in the mountains of North Carolina. I hope to include lots of mountain folklore as well as Cherokee lore, and show what happens to traditions as ‘modern’ advancements take over.\n\nWhy have you chosen this genre? Or do you write in multiple genres?\n\nI love historical fiction for two reasons. The first is that I love to do research. I call myself a #researchjunkie. The second is that I have trouble with setting. I wouldn’t do well with the kind of world building often found in full-fledged fantasies or science fiction. With historical fiction, I don’t have to ‘make up’ a setting. I just have to do enough research to help my readers understand what it was like at that time. It’s a perfect genre for me.\n\nWhen did you decide to become a writer? Was it easy for you to follow your passion or did you have to make some sacrifices along the way?\n\nAs a child, I used to tell people that I wanted to be three things. The first was an Olympic ice skater, but for anyone who knows me, this isn’t likely because I’m not terribly coordinated! I also said I wanted to be a brain surgeon. Once again, unlikely because I hate the sight of blood. However, I also said I wanted to be an author.\n\nI wrote a lot as a child and teen. Unfortunately, being a writer was not seen as a worthy occupation by my family. One didn’t go to college to learn to write because being a writer meant you would end up as a server in a restaurant and likely starve to death. So, I went to college getting a major in education and psychology, as well as minors in math and sociology – but I never used any of these directly in an occupation.\n\nAfter getting married, having four children, and then divorcing, I needed to find a job that allowed me to continue to stay at home and homeschool my children. I began writing for small businesses, helping them create content for the Internet.\n\nThen, I spent 14 years married to an emotionally abusive man. I eventually came to the point of no longer believing in myself or my abilities. I had stories that needed telling, but I believed – and was told – that just because I could write nonfiction didn’t mean I could write fiction.\n\nOnce I finally got out of that relationship, the words started to flow. However, I was still too terrified to let the words out into the public. I couldn’t handle the thought of rejection.\n\nIn February 2018, I met my current husband. Although I never planned to marry again, he was persistent – and perfectly suited for me. While we dated, he encouraged me to write the manuscript that became my first novel, Sunflowers Beneath the Snow. Then, after we married, we went on our tandem cycling adventure. That adventure changed my life. After those three months doing something well outside my comfort zone and very challenging, I realized that I could do anything I set my mind to.\n\nSix months after returning from the trip, Atmosphere Press accepted the manuscript for Sunflowers Beneath the Snow. And now, my second novel, An Enemy Like Me, is out.\n\nHow do you prefer to write – computer/laptop, typewriter, dictation or longhand with a pen?\n\nI am a computer writer all the way. I type very quickly and can keep up with my thoughts. I can’t do that with longhand. Plus, my longhand is very messy, meaning I have trouble deciphering what I wrote later!\n\nWhat are your 5 favourite books? (You can share 5 favourite authors too.)\n\nI have never liked this question because my favorite books change every time I read something new! So, I will give you some books that have meant something to me over the years.\n\nOver in the Meadow – This was a picture book with a sing-song poem by Olive A. Wadsworth. This is the first book I remember being read to me, and it still brings back happy memories.\n\nTrixie Belden books – Trixie Belden was a girl detective. These books were aimed at readers younger than Nancy Drew. I read them all. Then, I read all of Nancy Drew. And then? I read all of The Hardy Boys because it made me angry that I wasn’t supposed to read the books for boys.\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath – This novel by John Steinbeck was the first book I read for something other than pleasure. It was with this novel that I learned that authors often had something they wished to impart to their readers. Learning this changed the way I read books.\n\n1776 – I loved the way David McCullough weaved history as a story. I used 1776 to teach my children American history. Because the facts were part of a story, it made history fun and exciting. His books helped me to become a historical fiction fan.\n\nHarry Potter series – Because my children were interested, I read the books, too. I realized that JK Rowling had the ability to write in a way that intrigued children, teens, and adults. That is a skill I’d love to cultivate.\n\nHow do you deal with Writer’s Block?\n\nI don’t believe in writer’s block. When a writer can’t write, I believe it is because there is something else going on that is taking up the creative space in their head. It’s impossible to write if something big or overwhelming is crowding out creativity. The only thing to do is to fix the thing that is ‘top of mind’ or find a way to put it into perspective so that it is no longer in the way. For instance, when I first found out that my husband had brain cancer, I could not write because that was the only thing on my mind. It took up all the free space and crowded out creativity. I can write again, not because there has been a change in his condition, but because I’ve found a way to go on living despite the diagnosis. Cancer is part of our life right now and it has its own space in my head. However, I have far more control over it and when it comes out.\n\nWhat advice would you give to aspiring non-fiction writers?\n\nI have four things I would tell aspiring writers. The first is to write. Don’t wait for a class or a degree or some specific event to get started. You will never be a writer until you write, so get started now.\n\nThe second is that once you have something you feel has merit, let someone you trust – but who will be honest and give you feedback – read it. Then listen to what they have to say. Feedback can be difficult because it can feel like criticism. But you won’t get better at writing if you continue to do the same things over and over without improving.\n\nThe third sounds like it contradicts the second but bear with me. You don’t have to listen to everyone’s advice! There is more than one way to write and more than one kind of reader. Listen to suggestions and give them a try, but if they don’t work for you, it’s okay to put them to one side. For instance, I cannot use an outline. I’ve been told it is the “BEST” way to write, but for me, it stifles my creativity. I tried it. It didn’t work. Now? I’m comfortable with being a binge pantser.\n\nFinally, you’re going to have to be more than a writer if you want to sell your books. That means you’ll need to learn marketing. So, before your first book goes to print, learn how to market and get started marketing at least 12 weeks before the launch date.\n\nHere are ways readers can purchase the book and/or get in contact with you?\n\nYou can purchase the book on Amazon(https://www.amazon.com/Enemy-Like-Me-Teri-Brown/dp/1639885455), Barnes & Noble (https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/an-enemy-like-me-teri-m-brown/1142018249), and wherever books are sold.

Brown, for your insightful answers!\n\nBook Trailer\n\nAbout the Book\n\nAn Enemy Like Me\n\nHow does a man show his love – for country, for heritage, for family – during a war that sets the three at odds? What sets in motion the necessity to choose one over the other? How will this choice change everything and everyone he loves?\n\nJacob Miller, a first-generation American, grew up in New Berlin, a small German immigrant town in Ohio where he endured the Great Depression, met his wife, and started a family. Though his early years were not easy, Jacob believes he is headed toward his ‘happily ever after’ until a friend is sent to an internment camp for enemy combatants, and the war lands resolutely on his doorstep.\n\nIn An Enemy Like Me, Teri M Brown uses the backdrop of World War II to show the angst experienced by Jacob, his wife, and his four-year-old son as he left for and fought in a war he did not create. She explores the concepts of xenophobia, intrafamily dynamics, and the recognition that war is not won and lost by nations, but by ordinary men and women and the families who support them.\n\nIf you are a fan of historical fiction with a love for heartfelt, introspective war stories, then you’ll enjoy An Enemy Like Me. This emotional saga explores war and its impacts in unique ways that few military fiction novels do.\n\nYou can find An Enemy Like Me here:\n\nAmazon| Goodreads | Author Website\n\nIf you are an author and wish to be featured as our guest or if you are a publicist and want to get your author featured on TRB, then please get in touch directly by e-mail at thereadingbud@gmail.com"
