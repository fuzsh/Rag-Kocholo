Originally a \"loose and baggy monster,\" it was beaten into some semblance of publishable condition by my first editor, Gary Fisketjon, and published with a suitably lurid cover that still makes me laugh when I see it at book signings. But it entitled me to say that I was a published novelist, and it marks the beginning of my career and my adult life."
