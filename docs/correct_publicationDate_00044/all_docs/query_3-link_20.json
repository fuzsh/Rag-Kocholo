        "text": "You need subtle details. This is what many authors overlook — the symbolism or sentimentality associated with say an amulet given to the protagonist by her mother, or an hourglass that symbolizes the passage of the centuries in a village like in my book Song of Kitaba.\n\nScience Fiction and Fantasy are hugely popular genres. What does it take for a writer today, to write compelling and successful Science Fiction and Fantasy stories? Authority Magazine started a new series called “How To Write Compelling Science Fiction and Fantasy Stories”. In this series, we are talking to anyone who is a Science Fiction or Fantasy author, or an authority or expert on how to write compelling Science Fiction and Fantasy."
