Their invisibility makes them less susceptible to representation and thus comprehension while the technological contours of existence become impossible to ignore. It has fallen to science fiction to narrate a new subject that can somehow interface with--and master--the technologies of the Information Age, an era in which the subject has become a 'terminal of multiple networks' (Jean Baudrillard). There is no overstating the importance of science fiction to a moment that sees itself as science fiction. The genre has prefigured many issues of postmodernism. Writers such as Baudrillard and Haraway produce dense texts that seem like SF, and Jameson's list of postmodern tropes is applicable to the genre. Almost all the works studied here have appeared since 1960; many date from the 1980s. My concern is not only with content but with the decentering language strategies of SF, strategies that vary in different media. The dissertation uses theories of representation, narration and cinema to offer media-specific analyses in the context of developments in electronic culture, including visualization technologies, computer games, virtual reality systems, and global communication networks. The first chapter involves metaphors of addiction and viral invasion in science fiction and philosophy pertaining to media culture. The second and third chapters explore 'electronic space' through the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty and the social theories of de Certeau. While the second chapter explores the visual description of 'cyberspace,' the third details the body's entry into that space. The fourth chapter describes the range of human-technology fusions in science fiction and horror. The conclusion uses feminist SF to examine the limitations of such subjectivities. Recent SF constructs a new subjectivity to interface with the cyberscapes of contemporary existence. The genre produces a 'cognitive mapping' of the invisible, but powerful, spaces of the present.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle: LEIGH BRACKETT: AMERICAN SCIENCE FICTION WRITER--HER LIFE AND WORK Pub No: 8820263 Author: CARR, JOHN LEONARD Degree: PHD School: THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY Date: 1988 Pages: 240 Adviser: ZACHER, CHRISTIAN Source: DAI-A 49/08, p. 2218, Feb 1989 Subject: LITERATURE, AMERICAN (0591); BIOGRAPHY (0304) Abstract: Leigh Brackett (1915-1978) was a versatile and respected genre writer. She wrote film scripts, detective novels, a western, science fiction and science fantasy, radio and television scripts, even scripts for Batman and Superman comic books. Just before her death she completed the first draft of the screenplay for the George Lucas film, The Empire Strikes Back. However, her reputation today rests primarily on the romantic space opera, derived from Edgar Rice Burroughs, that she wrote for pulp science fiction adventure magazines, especially for Planet Stories. My dissertation opens with a life of Leigh Brackett. Much of the material comes from written sources: her own writing; her interviews (including several previously unpublished); what others wrote about her. A good deal of original research was also conducted. I interviewed, often at considerable length and sometimes several times, more than twenty of her friends and fellow writers. A significant amount of previously unknown information was uncovered. My second chapter, besides containing a brief history of pulp magazines in America, also attempts to recreate the working conditions and attitudes of the pulp writer. In particular, I discuss the unusual evolution of the science fiction magazines. Chapter three considers Leigh Brackett as a pulp writer, especially in her persona 'Queen of the Space Opera.' The characteristic traits of the fiction she wrote for the pulps are analyzed. The five stories in The Coming of the Terrans (1967) are examined in detail, as is a representative Brackett science fiction adventure novel, The Starmen of Llyrdis (1952), and one of the strongest of her science fantasies, People of the Talisman (1964). My final chapter is given to Brackett's last and longest novel, The Book of Skaith (1976). I relate the novel to her earlier pulp work, but show as well the extent and variety of the changes she made in the pulp model. The Book of Skaith is Leigh Brackett's best integration of science fiction and fantasy.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle: NOT AT ALL SURPRISED BY SCIENCE: SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN AMMONS, NEMEROV, AND MERRILL (AMERICAN) Pub No: 8618329 Author: CLARK, MIRIAM MARTY Degree: PHD School: THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL Date: 1986 Pages: 158 Source: DAI-A 47/05, p. 1723, Nov 1986 Subject: LITERATURE, MODERN (0298) Abstract: This dissertation studies the relationship between contemporary poetry and science. The introduction notes a polarization of poetry and science in the thinking of many modern critics, particularly the New Critics, but it also points to arguments which assert literary, historical, even organic connections between the two disciplines. It establishes for recent poems of science a context in earlier twentieth-century poems (by Pound, Zukofsky, Rexroth, and others) as well as in the fiction and non-fiction prose of the post-modern period. Chapter 1 examines the scientific language, structures, and processes which inform many of A. R. Ammons's poems. Particularly important structures are the gene and the computer which are associated both metaphorically and metonymically, as information processors, with the poem itself. Chapter 2 points out Howard Nemerov's distrust of science but argues that the metaphors of science and the metaphoric nature of science become increasingly useful as ways to resolve the paradox of principle and diversity in the world. Chapter 3 considers James Merrill's unorthodox use of science, particularly physics, in the middle volume of his trilogy The Changing Light at Sandover. There science is not only a source of metaphors but an occasion for phobia, pageantry, pontification. Compounded at every point with fable and pseudo-science, Merrill's science is less persuasive, if more dramatic, than either Ammon's or Nemerov's.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle: STATION BUILT ON SAND: A SCIENCE-FICTION NOVEL WITH CRITICAL DISCUSSION. (ORIGINAL WRITING) Pub No: 9405735 Author: GALLOWAY, STANLEY AUBURN Degree: PHD School: UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS Date: 1993 Pages: 271 Adviser: GUNN, JAMES Source: DAI-A 54/09, p. 3431, Mar 1994 Subject: LITERATURE, MODERN (0298); LITERATURE, AMERICAN (0591) Abstract: The novel is a Bildungsroman of the girl, Otis, who is orphaned at a young age and adopted by aboriginal, ambisexual humanoids on the planet Rabney. After many years she leaves her adoptive people to join with the personnel of a scientific station some distance away. Her understanding of her own sexuality is confused from living her childhood with a race bearing both male and female characteristics. At Green Weather station she reaches puberty and, examines the various sex roles available to her. She lives in various relationships at the station and away until she is discovered in the ruins of a former settlement and decides to return to Green Weather. There she tries to convince the station that her adoptive people have the necessary qualities to be considered equal with the humans. The ambisexuals' compassion in the aftermath of a serious earthquake convinces the survivors that despite superficial differences, the two groups should be united through their 'human spirit.' Otis's skills at translating the unspoken communication of the ambisexuals is essential to the future of congenial relations between the groups. The critical discussion concerns Otis's feral nature, her female nature and her role as communication liaison. The background of the feral child is shown in comparison to Kipling's Mowgli and Burroughs' Tarzan. Her female development, in terms of sexual conduct, is shown as an outgrowth of the changes in female protagonists in science fiction. A final discussion locates this work at the end of a tradition of alien assessment, citing Panshin's Losels and Silverberg's Eaters, among others, as precedents in the search for a definition of 'human' based on communicative abilities.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle: THE FUTURE ISN'T WHAT IS USED TO BE: GLOBALIZATION IN THE FICTION OF WILLIAM GIBSON AND OTHER CYBERWRITERS (SCIENCE FICTION) Pub No: 9722298 Author: GILZINGER, DONALD MERRITT, JR. Degree: PHD School: STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT STONY BROOK Date: 1996 Pages: 259 Adviser: NELSON, GERALD B. Source: DAI-A 58/02, p. 455, Aug 1997 Subject: LITERATURE, AMERICAN (0591); LITERATURE, CANADIAN (ENGLISH) (0352) Abstract: Since Neuromancer (1984) and his early short stories collected in Burning Chrome, William Gibson has depicted his neologistic cyberspace as a literal and figurative computer generated site to explore the consequential phenomena of globalization under which constraints of geography and time recede. Set in an emergent information-driven global society, the Cyberspace trilogy, Neuromancer, Count Zero, and Mona Lisa Overdrive and his later Virtual Light and Idoru, examine the economic, political, and sociocultural repercussions of globalization on humanity. In the Cyberspace trilogy, Gibson presents globalization as a relentlessly negative impulse leading to transnational corporations replacing nation-states as centers of power through usurpation of communications and economic activity, the accelerated decline of the middle class, environmental degradation, and continued social fragmentation into re-tribalized subcultures. His pessimism is echoed by other science fiction writers employing globalized settings, e.g. Bruce Sterling, Pat Cadigan, Neal Stephenson, and Jack Womack and is contrasted with the technological utopianism of contemporary futurists like Alvin Toffler and Kenichi Ohmae. In Virtual Light and Idoru, Gibson, having accepted the inevitability of globalization, begins to move toward cautious optimism by proposing individual and small group acts of resistance that redirect or reorganize global forces including, among others, reappropriation of formerly public property, passive luddism, small-scale industrial communes, data privacy through surrogate, and construction of private walled communities in cyberspace itself. But Gibson's central concern remains the individual's struggle to maintain sovereignty over his or her body despite globalization and the seeming merging of the human body with the machine, whether personified as the human/machine cyborg or as the human/data metamorphosis into a cyberspace digital presence. As his characters evolve from marginalized representatives of the criminal underclass of Neuromancer to actively demarginalizing global citizens of Idoru, Gibson depicts how the self may reassert self-control within seemingly implacable global phenomena. Although necessarily formative, Gibson's fiction is arguably the first to integrate the reality of computerization and globalization into a logically coherent setting while beginning to describe and depict the impact of global issues on organizations and individuals.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle: ANDRE NORTON'S SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY, 1950-1979; AN INTRODUCTION TO THE TOPICS OF PHILOSOPHICAL REFLECTION, IMAGINARY VOYAGES, AND FUTURE PREDICTION IN SELECTED BOOKS FOR YOUNG READERS Pub No: 8103101 Author: HENSLEY, CHARLOTTA COOK Degree: PHD School: UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER Date: 1980 Pages: 240 Source: DAI-A 41/08, p. 3580, Feb 1981 Subject: LITERATURE, AMERICAN (0591) Abstract: Andre Norton has been long overlooked by literary critics, although her work deserves careful consideration because she is a competent, prolific, and popular writer of books for younger readers. The intent of this study is to provide an introductory, chronological overview of three major topics appearing in selected full-length science fiction and fantasy published by Norton since 1950 for younger readers. Forty-five books have been selected from fifteen standard recommended reading lists for American elementary and junior high school students. Each book has been reviewed to determine Norton's treatment of the topics of Philosophical Reflection, Imagery Voyages, and Future Prediction. Norton views the enduring human condition as the struggle for individual survival against both human and social oppression. Her protagonists return from their adventures to instruct their communities that social endurance and growth is contingent upon individual freedom and cultural diversity as well as upon the mutual cooperation of all intelligent life. Norton's Imaginary Voyages are primarily travel in fourth and fifth dimensions. Fourth dimensional journeys are always into the past, either on Earth or on alien planets. Travellers usually return to their own times and often there is modern consequence resulting from interference in history. Fifth dimensional voyages into alternate worlds are usually physical and travellers are often stranded with little consequence to their own worlds. By using time travel, the author adds a sense of galactic history to her stories and invokes traditional mythological patterns of a protagonist's wandering in supernatural regions. Norton presents human/animal telepathic links as one method of future communication. Her communication levels range from primitive instinct to sophisticated reasoning. The protagonist/animal mental symbiosis provides a collective strength greater than that individually possible and supports the author's primary topic of on- planet cooperation among all intelligent beings. Norton is a superb storyteller who possesses powerful narrative control. She presents complex ideas and plot structues in a deceptively straightforward writing style. Although her choice of topics is within conventional science fiction and fantasy boundaries, the author moves beyond formulas to focus on fundamentally human matters. By employing many of the components of human history, such as anthropology, archeology, folklore, legend, mythology, natural history, and religion, to project human behavior in the future, Norton provides a unique literary experience for her readers. Andre Norton has written successfully in several genres for a young audience. Her science fiction and fantasy is a complexly imagined blend of historical and philosophical ideas. The author not only offers fast- paced adventures but also presents protagonists with recognizable human problems with which young readers might identify.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle: MACHINES OF UNMAKING: WRITING POSTINDUSTRIAL STATES IN CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN FICTION (KURT VONNEGUT, MARGE PIERCY, JOANNA RUSS) Pub No: 9625638 Author: HICKS, HEATHER J. Degree: PHD School: DUKE UNIVERSITY Date: 1996 Pages: 313 Adviser: DAVIDSON, CATHY N. Source: DAI-A 57/04, p. 1617, Oct 1996 Subject: LITERATURE, AMERICAN (0591) Abstract: 'Machines of Unmaking: Writing Postindustrial States in Contemporary American Fiction' documents a complex history of American literary responses to the advent of 'postindustrialism,' Western nations' historic shift from industrial manufacturing to information services. Specifically, I argue that the authors I discuss have struggled to define postindustrial America by redefining the meanings of the terms 'woman' and 'working class' in relation to the cybernetic technologies that revolutionized the American workplace after World War II. The first half of Machines of Unmaking considers texts by three writers who explore, alternatively, the liberal and radical conceptions of the American postindustrial state that flourished during the first three decades after World War II. In Player Piano, Kurt Vonnegut extrapolates from the post-war welfare state, generating a critique of American class relations which concedes the failure of the term 'working class' to account for those about whom he writes. Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time and Joanna Russ's The Female Man anticipate a future, on the other hand, in which America's break with industrialism has spawned a society where no citizen must work and all enjoy relative affluence. Moving beyond the economic rhetoric that popularized this vision of postindustrialism during the 1970s, Piercy and Russ interrogate the implications of pervasive automation for the emergent women's movement. The second half of my project turns to engagements with the concept of postindustrialism written after the moment when historians have claimed serious debate about American deindustrialization ended. In my discussion of William Gibson, I reframe the current controversy about the cyberpunk science fiction movement by identifying its crucial antecedents in earlier narratives of the postindustrial state. In Chapter Four, I explore Nicholson Baker's texts as historical responses to the version of postindustrialism that enjoyed currency during the 1980s--the 'service economy.' I conclude by considering best-selling novels by Michael Crichton and Tom Clancy that appeal to their mass audience by externalizing the destabilizing effects of postindustrialism, framing Japan as an economic predator that has purposefully stripped an unsuspecting America of its industrial supremacy.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle: CHRIS MARKER AND 'LA JETEE' (FRANCE) Pub No: 8403272 Author: LIEM, RONCO YAOBING Degree: EDD School: COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY TEACHERS COLLEGE Date: 1983 Pages: 176 Source: DAI-A 44/11, p. 3188, May 1984 Subject: CINEMA (0900) Abstract: Chris Marker (b. 1921) is a French film-maker who has had a great impact on film trends, either through his own work or through his relationships with other film-makers. Marker was one of the orginators of the cinema-verite style of documentary film-making, and is associated with the roots of the Nouvelle Vague movement in France. He is also regarded by many to be the founder of collective political film-making in France. He formed the film co- operative SLON in late 1966 to make a film protesting American involvement in Vietnam, Loin du Vietnam (Far from Vietnam, 1967). This study examines in a general way the professional life and films of Chris Marker, and conducts in particular an extended critical analysis of his film La Jetee (The Jetty, 1962, released 1963). Greater attention is given to those films of Marker which preceded La Jetee than those which followed it. However, an appendix is provided which lists sources which contain more information about those later films. Those films which are examined in some detail are: Les Statues meurent aussi (Statues Die Also, 1953), Dimanche a Pekin (Sunday in Peking, 1955), Lettre de Siberie (Letter from Siberia, 1957), Description d'un Combat (Description of a Struggle, 1959, released 1960) and Cuba Si! (1961). La Jetee is a science fiction film made almost entirely of still photographs, or freeze frames. It is the story of a man forced to undergo painful experiments which enable him to travel through time after the global destruction of a nuclear World War III. Since film has a relationship with pre-existing traditions, this study includes an examination of those traditions or conventions that La Jetee belongs to. This study thus has a chapter on the history of science fiction cinema, and one on the use of still photographs and the freeze frame in motion pictures. The critical analysis of La Jetee includes discussions of La Jetee in the context of preceding Marker films, La Jetee and science fiction cinema traditions, the analytical versus the intuitive in La Jetee, formal aspects of La Jetee, and La Jetee as metafilm.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle: THE OEDIPUS MYTH IN TWENTIETH-CENTURY FICTION (MYTHOLOGICAL, READER RESPONSE THEORY) Pub No: 8526048 Author: MODDELMOG, DEBRA ANN Degree: PHD School: THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY Date: 1985 Pages: 203 Source: DAI-A 46/11, p. 3341, May 1986 Subject: LITERATURE, GENERAL (0401) Abstract: This study has a threefold aim: to reveal the semiotic system through which embedded myth works in fiction and the mechanics of reader response to it; to test these observations on narratives using the Oedipus myth; and to examine the reasons for the hold this myth has on the twentieth-century imagination. Myth is narrative which demands interpretation and thus owns a hermeneutic tradition while inviting further interpretation. In fiction, myth acts like a language, offering to transmit its pre-existing explanations or to accommodate a new meaning. This situation compares to the communication triangle, with the author as encoder, the reader as decoder, and the parts of a myth--its mythemes--as the signs. The language theory of myth is verified on narratives using the Oedipus myth. These Oedipal works divide into three genres: detective fiction, science fiction, and psychological fiction, each stressing different mythemes. The first group--which includes Robbe-Grillet's The Erasers, Butor's Passing Time, and Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49--uses the Oedipal mythemes of the investigation and the self-incrimination to establish their anti- detective nature. Beginning with Wells in The Time Machine, science fiction writers employing the Oedipus myth have concentrated upon the Sphinx mytheme. Following Wells's precedent, sf authors such as Dick and Zelazny in Deus Irae and Farmer in Venus on the Half-Shell and 'Riders of the Purple Wage' use this mytheme ironically, to depict a non-heroic future. Freud supplied the pattern for writers employing Oedipus in psychological fiction before 1945, but Lacan can be seen as providing the Oedipal paradigm for authors using the myth since then. O'Connor's Wise Blood, Moravia's The Lie, Frisch's Homo Faber, and Spencer's Asylum center upon the progress of a protagonist from ignorance to insight, the movement Lacan stresses in interpreting Oedipus. The appeal of the Oedipus myth for modern authors lies in its treatment of knowledge. In using Oedipus, writers infer that his primary discovery is that humans cannot know absolutely. This inference parallels the theories of scientists such as Heisenberg and Kuhn and of mathematicians such as Godel who find probability and unsolvability at the end of the scientific quest.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle: EFFECTS OF GENRE-SPECIFIC SETTING ON CAUSAL CHAIN COMPREHENSION OF NAIVE AND SOPHISTICATED SCIENCE FICTION READERS Pub No: 8409267 Author: PINCUS, ARLENE REVA HONIG Degree: PHD School: FORDHAM UNIVERSITY Date: 1984 Pages: 268 Source: DAI-A 45/02, p. 477, Aug 1984 Subject: EDUCATION, READING (0535) Abstract: The investigator hypothesized that readers use the macro- structure SETTING to access genre-specific story schemata and that understanding a story's Setting information enhances Causal Chain understanding. Because Setting interacts with readers' prior knowledge about possible- worlds in which stories are set, a science fiction story was chosen. Science fiction Settings do not match known possible-worlds; hence readers cannot routinely apply Setting information by default. The investigator hypothesized that Sophisticated science fiction readers construct genre-specific expectations. Sophisticated readers would use a science fiction scheme to understand such stories, while Naive readers, using a more general story schema, would understand less of the Setting, and therefore less of the Causal Chain. It was predicted that a general summary of the story's Setting would improve recall of both variables. Subjects were competent adult readers, categorized by a test of science fiction background knowledge into 36 Naive and 36 Sophisticated subjects. The story was a 7600 word, naturally-occurring, science fiction story. Based upon the work of Delany (1977; 1978), Setting was analyzed on dimensions in which science fiction and realistic fiction differ: uniqueness of concept and level of imagery. Causal Chain was analyzed through an Event Chain Analysis as suggested by Warren, Nicholas, and Trabasso (1979). Dependents were tested in a multiple-choice recall condition. Half the subjects received the Setting Summary. Sophisticated subjects recalled significantly more Setting and Causal Chain information than Naive subjects. Both groups showed systematic differences between recall of Setting proposition categories. There was a significant relationship between the Causal Chain and Setting. The Setting Summary did not affect subjects' recall. The investigator concluded that Sophisticated readers had an advantage in recalling Causal Chain and Setting information. The success of a few Naive subjects in recalling Causal Chain information showed that a general schema could be used to understand the story's events. However, these subjects remembered less Setting information related to the Causal Chain than did Sophisticated readers.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle: SOVIET SCIENCE FICTION: NEW CRITICAL APPROACHES Pub No: 8220534 Author: SAMUEL, SCOTT RANDALL Degree: PHD School: STANFORD UNIVERSITY Date: 1982 Pages: 140 Source: DAI-A 43/04, p. 1167, Oct 1982 Subject: LITERATURE, SLAVIC AND EAST EUROPEAN (0314) Abstract: The purpose of this work is twofold. In the first half I develop a general theory on the structural aspects of science fiction. Although most often I concentrate upon Soviet science fiction texts, my intent has been to create a theory which will apply equally well to all types of science fiction. Major topics discussed are: a genre definition, change in genre, the construction of 'reality' in a science fiction text through use of extra- , inter-, and intra-textual information sources, and a scheme for analyzing science fiction plot structure. At the root of all these theoretical considerations, reader/text interaction is seen to play a key role. The second aim of this work is to compare Soviet science fiction (especially recent works) with the science fiction of the West in order to discover why and to what degree they differ, and to establish the range of variation of Soviet science fiction itself. Topics discussed are: similarities and differences in how the texts portray historical development, their use of science fiction literary devices (such as the 'alien'), their differing approaches to science and technology, and their divergent views on the role of the individual and society. A description is given of the impact the institution of the Soviet doctrine of Socialist Realism in the early '30s had upon Soviet science fiction, and of the significant role played by 'socialist romanticism' in the later development of contemporary Soviet science fiction. In this comparison between East and West, the two literatures are found to differ in many ways on the ideological level, but to be remarkably similar on the structural level.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle: POE, LEM, AND THE ART AND SCIENCE OF LITERATURE (EDGAR ALLAN POE, STANISLAW LEM, POLAND) Pub No: NN12493 Author: SWIRSKI, PETER Degree: PHD School: MCGILL UNIVERSITY (CANADA) Date: 1995 Pages: 304 Adviser: LIVINGSTON, PAISLEY ISBN: 0-612-12493-2 Source: DAI-A 57/10, p. 4354, Apr 1997 Subject: LANGUAGE, RHETORIC AND COMPOSITION (0681); LITERATURE, AMERICAN (0591); LITERATURE, SLAVIC AND EAST EUROPEAN (0314) Abstract: Transcending the boundaries of literature, the works of Edgar Allan Poe and Stanislaw Lem contribute to a dialogue between literary, philosophical, and scientific cultures. A critical approach to these writers that ignores the epistemic dimension in their works opens itself to the charge of misunderstanding their artistic goals and aspirations. In my dissertation I thus define, justify, and conduct an interdisciplinary study of Poe and Lem's works. My project is underwritten by the epistemological assumption that literary works, and notably works of fiction, can make a contribution to knowledge that can be assessed in terms of interdisciplinary criteria. In the first chapter, where I discuss literature and knowledge within the interdisciplinary context, I examine various epistemological arguments in light of my central assertion. Next I examine the concepts involved in the discussion of literary works. Following the pragmatic re- orientation in literary and philosophical aesthetics, many fundamental concepts we take for granted--artworks, fictions, and texts among them--require exact re- examination and definition. Consequently, in Chapters Two and Three I review and refine the recent theories concerning the nature of works of art, the specificity of literary fictions, and the problem of literary interpretations. My subsequent discussion of Poe and Lem is built on the theoretical base of (literary) epistemology and analytical aesthetics. I study Poe and Lem's literary fictions and theoretical essays, and the contributions they make to various fields of inquiry. In the process I critique, and sometimes refine, the explicit and implicit hypotheses articulated in their works. Specifically In Chapters Four and Five I discuss strategic and game theoretic models in the interpretation of fiction, including the concepts of communication and rationality. In Chapter Six, completing the epistemological circle inaugurated in Chapter One, I discuss the epistemological and cosmological theories proposed in Poe's 'Eureka'.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle: THE CULTURE OF MIMESIS: FUTURISTIC SCIENCE FICTION OF LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY (JULES VERNE, H. G. WELLS, ALBERT ROBIDA, FRANCE) Pub No: 9827797 Author: WILLEMS, PHILIPPE Degree: PHD School: UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER Date: 1998 Pages: 430 Adviser: GARELICK, RHONDA Source: DAI-A 59/03, p. 819, Sep 1998 Subject: LITERATURE, MODERN (0298); LITERATURE, COMPARATIVE (0295); LANGUAGE, LINGUISTICS (0290); LITERATURE, ENGLISH (0593); LITERATURE, ROMANCE (0313) Abstract: Far from a genre associated with fantasy, science fiction belongs to the search for realism that permeates nineteenth-century Western culture. At the crossroads of the novel and scientific discourse, its very nature places it at the core of the realist problematic. More surprising, and in rupture with traditional fantasy literature, is the degree of plausibility that endows even the fanciest proto-SF stories: the technological developments they announce are not subject to the writer's whim. Even if the technology presented is not plausible in itself, the general concept behind it often is. This thesis focuses on the late nineteenth-century futuristic novel. The futuristic novel, also known as conjectural, prospective, or anticipation novel, projects possibilities into the future, generally of a technological and sociological nature. Jules Verne and H. G. Wells embody nineteenth-century SF, or rather, respectively, the scientific novel and the scientific romance. These two authors crystallized the genre into a specific literary domain. Each dubbed 'father of SF' in his respective country, they however work on opposite principles. Incidentally, despite their characterization as writers of SF, these two novelists produced very few truly SF novels. In this thesis, I also introduce Albert Robida, a forgotten French writer of scientific novels and historical works. His illustrated books present the particularity of combining written text and pictural information, in a highly original narrative structure. My purpose here is to rekindle interest in a noteworthy utopian whose insight and ability to bring life to an imaginary society distinguish his futuristic fiction from the conventional production. This thesis also situates literary realism within its philosophical, historical, and cultural contexts. It proposes an overview of the nineteenth-century cultural landscape in relation to realism. It notably investigates its literary expressions, the constitution of a realist poetics, as well as the roles of the scientific discourse and of historiography in the birth of Realism proper. I also explore the constitution of mass culture, its visual dimension, and the evolution of reader status in the nineteenth century.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle: CYBORGS AND SOFT MACHINES: CONTROL AND CHAOS IN TECHNOLOGICAL EVOLUTION Pub No: MM98806 Author: WOOD, BRENT DONALD Degree: MA School: TRENT UNIVERSITY (CANADA) Date: 1995 Pages: 263 Adviser: THEALL, DONALD F. ISBN: 0-315-98806-1 Source: MAI 34/01, p. 124, Feb 1996 Subject: HISTORY, MODERN (0582); HISTORY OF SCIENCE (0585); MASS COMMUNICATIONS (0708); SOCIOLOGY, SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT (0700); PHILOSOPHY (0422) Abstract: This thesis develops a theory of poetic practice with respect to the powerful cybernetic communication systems which have come to characterize industrial society since World War II. It proceeds by critiquing theoretical approaches to the nexus of human being, language and technology. Among the theoretical models critiqued are the 'cybernetic organism' an evolving and self-sustaining force not strictly dependent on human will, and the 'soft machine', a living text that is potentially without boundaries. The texts of Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari and William S. Burroughs demonstrate the role of chaos in experimental communication. The thesis also examines texts from the fields of science-fiction, philosophy and the applied and theoretical sciences.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle: THE RESEARCHED NOVEL: DEFINITION, EXPLICATION OF FIVE EXAMPLES, AND THEORETICAL DISCUSSION OF RESEARCH IN FICTION (THOMAS MORE, MICHAEL CRICHTON, GEORGE M. FRASER, WILLIAM GOLDING, JOSEPHINE TEY) Pub No: 8226130 Author: YOST, CARLSON WARD Degree: PHD School: TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY Date: 1982 Pages: 229 Source: DAI-A 43/06, p. 1964, Dec 1982 Subject: LITERATURE, COMPARATIVE (0295) Abstract: This dissertation examines the role of research in the novel. The 'researched novel' is defined as a work of fiction founded upon a particular area of information that illuminates or explores a particular 'truth' that is usually unrecognized or misunderstood. Thomas More's History of Richard III is posited as the first novel and the first researched novel in English. Other historically influential authors are Daniel Defoe, Sir Walter Scott, and James Joyce. Five researched novels deemed to have literary merit were examined: (a) Thomas More's History is an extended ironic narrative fiction and would be considered a novel if written today. Many of More's ironies depend on the common knowledge of readers of his day. Much of the irony can be elucidated with only a rudimentary knowledge of Tudor England. (b) Michael Crichton's Great Train Robbery is a 'thriller.' Crichton integrates a large number of facts from the Victorian Era with the behavior of his characters to illustrate several fallacious beliefs about the nature of crime and criminals. (c) George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman is a 'feigned memoir' borrowing the famous bully from Tom Brown's Schooldays to examine the character and behavior of many people who actually lived during Victoria's reign. Fraser's readers must continually judge whether he has fairly illustrated the effects of character upon behavior. (d) William Golding's Inheritors is a form of science fiction using the known facts about Neanderthal Man to pursue an extended comparison and contrast. He creates many puzzles that require readers to examine basic philsophical, theological, and scientific reasoning. (e) Josephine Tey's The Daughter of Time is a detective novel in which Tey examines the guilt or innocence of Richard III and the nature of historiography. The dissertation concludes with relation of the models for reading of John Henry Newman, Hans Vaihinger, David Hackett Fischer, Wayne C. Booth, and C. S. Lewis to the five explicated texts. It is concluded that an active, questioning reader both learns more and enjoys reading more than the reader who attempts to passively and totally absorb a text in a single reading.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------"
