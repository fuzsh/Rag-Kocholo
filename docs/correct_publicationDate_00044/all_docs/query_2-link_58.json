        "text": "by Neal Stephenson\n\n(1984)\n\nPublisher: William Morrow\n\nThe New York Times Book Review called Neal Stephenson’s most recent novel “electrifying” and “hilarious”. but if you want to know Stephenson was doing twenty years before he wrote the epic Cryptonomicon, it’s back-to-school time. Back to The Big U, that is, a hilarious send-up of American college life starring after years out of print, The Big U is required reading for anyone interested in the early work of this singular writer.\n\nThe American Megaversity is a normal American college … just bigger. Much larger. Hundreds of thousands of students doing their daily activities are housed in the Arkolog-like building: political gatherings, demonstrations, lectures, parties … everything goes its way."
