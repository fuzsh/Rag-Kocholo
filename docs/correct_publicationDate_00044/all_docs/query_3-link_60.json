While there, he uncovered stories of love and loss, stories of shipwreck and tragedy. And he met several Fae creatures who had something to say about New York city. Written mostly in heroic meter with a couple breaks for spoken word and Renaissance meters, The Greenwood Poet calls us to return to the Arcadia in our own neighborhood.\n\nAnd does so through poetic fictions.\n\nReview\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 5 out of 5.\n\nThe Greenwood Poet by Lancelot Schaubert is a beautiful and heart-touching poetry collection. What really made this collection special for me was that the poems in this collection are all themed beautifully, rooted in a place that holds a very special place for the author. I am a believer in certain places holding an unyielding grip on one’s heart and soul and every poem in this collection makes my belief stronger.\n\nSo I loved the entire collection and though there were a few favourites, overall this book makes for an excellent read with the bite-sized poems that are more contemplative in their content than their length.\n\nYou can also read this review on:\n\nGoodreads\n\nAmazon\n\nBook Review: Corrupted: Book Two of The Terrian Trilogy by Jenny Benjamin\n\nBook Details:\n\nAuthor: Jenny Benjamin\n\nRelease Date: 2nd September 2022\n\nSeries: The Terrian Trilogy (Book #2)\n\nGenre: Young-Adult, Science-Fiction Fantasy, High Fantasy\n\nFormat: E-book\n\nPages: 267 pages\n\nPublisher: –\n\nBlurb:\n\nBook Two begins ten days after the events of Book One with Jesse, Kate, and Hayden traveling in the found alien ship and trailing the Gelfs who have kidnapped Sofia. Plagued with rage and guilt because of Sofia’s capture, Jesse finds himself losing control of his emotions and the Triumvirate’s mission to bring peace to two worlds—Earth and Terria.\n\nTensions, attractions, and powers crackle with energy in the second installment of the Terrian Trilogy. Jesse and his friends discover new abilities, face hybrid beasts, and carry out rescue missions on Terria. What else? More revelations about Terria’s corruption? Genetic modification? The unveiling of a terrifying plot by Terria’s faction leaders? Yes. Maybe. Jesse and his friends are called to act.\n\nReview\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 4 out of 5.\n\nCorrupted by Jenny Benjamin is the second book in the new young-adult sci-fi-fantasy Terrain trilogy This book begins right where the first book, Enhanced left off so it would be ideal to read this series in order.\n\nThis book took the plot of the last book further, exploring amazing new avenues and sub-plots and with some new characters added to the mix that explored the world of this trilogy further, it made for an excellent read. I was able to understand the motivations and drives of the characters better in this part as they were explored on a yet deeper level, facing new perils that tested their strengths and grit.\n\nI am looking forward to reading the next and the last part of this trilogy as I know it would answer some questions that this book had given rise to. But most of all, I really want to see how things end for the main characters, Jesse, Kate and Hayden.\n\nI would strongly recommend this book (and the series) to all science-fiction readers and to high-fantasy enthusiasts who love reading well-developed and realistic young-adult characters.\n\nYou can also read this review on:\n\nGoodreads\n\nAmazon\n\nBook Review: Enhanced: Book One of The Terrian Trilogy by Jenny Benjamin\n\nBook Details:\n\nAuthor: Jenny Benjamin\n\nRelease Date: 1st October 2021\n\nSeries: The Terrian Trilogy (Book #1)\n\nGenre: Young-Adult, Science-Fiction Fantasy, High Fantasy\n\nFormat: E-book\n\nPages: 260 pages\n\nPublisher: –\n\nBlurb:\n\nJesse Woods – drum line maestro, track star, honors student – is a standout as one of the only Black students at a suburban Chicago high school. His well-organized world is thrown into chaos when his school is attacked by an alien species, Terrians, who have been playing gods throughout human history. Jesse and two others from the drumline, Kate and Hayden, are pulled into an epic alien conspiracy and forced on a quest to retrieve an ancient artifact that will help decide the victory in the battle for planet Earth. The three teenagers will face impossible odds and fight the powerful enemies, as well as their own demons, to protect their loved ones and save the world they know.\n\nYeah, right, what else, locusts? Dragons in the sky? Alien ships? War between worlds? Armageddon? Yes. Maybe. Only Jesse and his friends can stop it.\n\nReview\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 4 out of 5.\n\nEnhanced by Jenny Benjamin is the first book in the new young-adult sci-fi-fantasy Terrain trilogy. This book marked an excellent beginning of what could be a potentially amazing trilogy. This book had everything that I had expected and SO MUCH MORE!\n\nThe concept is brilliant setting a strong foundation not only for this book but for the next two books as well and the author’s writing kept the flow of the story very fluid and smooth making it a flawless experience. The characters were well-built and the world-building was up to the mark, the creatures/monsters were terrific and the detailing in the book was commendable. Overall this book made for a fantastically engrossing read and had me hooked right from the beginning till the very end, making me want to jump into the next book right away (which, of course, I did!)\n\nI would strongly recommend this book to all science-fiction readers and to high-fantasy enthusiasts who love reading well-developed and realistic young-adult characters.\n\nYou can also read this review on:\n\nGoodreads\n\nAmazon\n\nBook Review: H2LiftShips: Bosons Wave by Bob Freeman\n\nBook Details:\n\nAuthor: Bob Freeman\n\nRelease Date: 3rd August 2022\n\nSeries: H2LiftShips (Book #3)\n\nGenre: Science-Fiction\n\nFormat: E-book\n\nPages: 326 pages\n\nPublisher: Indies United Publishing House, LLC\n\nBlurb:\n\nWe’ve tried to make a nice, friendly Space Opera.\n\nSure it has passive-aggressive families, gambling, cheating, and double-dealing, but nice. Still, watch your back.\n\nSolarSail Cargo ships travel between the populated asteroids and Goldilocks Core.\n\nAnd now HiveMother at the Heliopause and the HiveSisters in the Heliotail are fighting.\n\nIt may turn into a full-fledged bioGel War.\n\nThe Solar Sail crew of BosonsWave and Captain Herb, an Eastern mountain gorilla in the Heliospheric Navy, are fighting the algae rocket ships for control of the bioGels.\n\nOn one side, we have tools and weapons invented by the sentients after eons of development: bioGel laser rifles, HAM radios, ship-to-ship bolas, nuclear bombs, biological weapons, and a tomato surprise.\n\nOn the other side, accumulations of brainless algae have joined with angry bioGel computers calling the shots.\n\nCaptain Graciela, her crew, and the Heliospheric Navy have a battle on their hands.\n\nReview\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 4 out of 5.\n\nH2LiftShip: Bosons Wave by Bob Freeman is the third book in the H2LiftShip series and a sequel to H2LiftShips: A Back Story. In this part, the last part of the trilogy, most of everything comes together providing the readers with a coherent and a much-needed respite-full ending.\n\nThe writing was much better in this book and the world-building went up a notch as did the characterisation as well as pretty much every other aspect. I am now really looking forward to exploring other titles by the author in the near future.\n\nI enjoyed this book a lot, and this series, on the whole too, and would definitely recommend it to all science-fiction readers and to sci-fi-fantasy readers too.\n\nYou can also read this review on:\n\nGoodreads\n\nAmazon\n\nBook Review: H2LiftShips: A Back Story by Bob Freeman\n\nBook Details:\n\nAuthor: Bob Freeman\n\nRelease Date: 21st February 2021\n\nSeries: H2LiftShips (Book #2)\n\nGenre: Science-Fiction\n\nFormat: E-book\n\nPages: 325 pages\n\nPublisher: Indies United Publishing House\n\nBlurb:\n\nTrading and dealing for a living is just what the LunaCola’s crew is doing to get by. But everybody (or octopus) has a backstory, and the members of the crew have more than enough to reminisce. There’s nothing quite like sitting down to play cards, celebrating a job well done, and recollecting the past but there’s still plenty that still has to come to light.\n\nThe big questions, such as how in the galaxy did the born-and-bred asteroid citizen learn to drive sports cars on Earth? Are the bioGels Sentient? The even bigger question is, are they plotting against their owners? And what dark secrets is Jack harboring behind his fears of prison? Those answers and more. Plus: Do octopuses really think that they are better than the terrestrials? (spoiler, yes they do, and there’s a story there as well.)\n\nReview\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 4 out of 5.\n\nH2LiftShip: A Back Story by Bob Freeman is the second book in the series and a sequel to Beyond Luna. After the first book, which was written in a very unique was more like a technical manual than a straight story, this book had a more coherent storyline that was easier to follow making this book a tad better than the first one (though I did like the first one too, it’s just the flow that I am referring to here in terms of being better.)\n\nThis book had a lot of interesting insights, more side-plots and character development and helped the overall world-building for the entire series to a great extent so I really liked this book too. Now I am looking forward to finishing the last book in this series (which I have already started!)\n\nAgain, I’d recommend this book to anyone who has read the first book in this series and anyone wanting to explore a new sci-fi series or a sci-fi author.\n\nYou can also read this review on:\n\nGoodreads\n\nAmazon\n\nBook Review: Beyond Luna (H2LiftShips #1) by Bob Freeman\n\nBook Details:\n\nAuthor: Bob Freeman\n\nRelease Date: 24th March 2021\n\nSeries: H2LiftShips (Book #1)\n\nGenre: Science-Fiction\n\nFormat: E-book\n\nPages: 338 pages\n\nPublisher: Indies United Publishing House\n\nBlurb:\n\nH2LiftShips, a tech manual for a futureImagine a world, exactly like ours, but differentPart Road-Trip, part solar sailing, always with food, gambling, jail, and pirates, not necessarily in that order No: Aliens, Monsters, blasters, pyrotechnic computers, or Anti-Grav powered rockets. Yes: Lasers, Primates, Canines, Octopus, Space Travel via Solar Sails, and the rare Rocket Ship.No violence, except for the spinning meat bolas and asteroid pebbles coming to the defense of their home rock.\n\nReview\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 4 out of 5.\n\nBeyond Luna is the first book in the H2LiftShip science-fiction series by author Bob Freeman. This book was so wildly adventurous that I could not stop myself from starting to read the next book in the series right after I was done reading this book. But first things first, this book had an amazing plot, excellent execution of that plot, good writing to bring it to life and well-built characters to bring it all together.\n\nIt was an immensely immersive read and the world-building was simply out of the world (pud definitely intended 😉\n\nI liked the authors writing and the new creatures in the book were definitely created with a lot of careful consideration.

But is that really much of a surprise when you can connect to the Cybernet?\n\nEveryone can turn on, log in and drop out.\n\nCyrus, a failed physicist, and drop-out game designer Everett are on the cusp of their big breakthrough into the meta ranks of Neverborn, the world’s most popular game.\n\nBut when several high-profile avatars disappear, and their human counterparts are found dead, Cyrus and Everett find themselves under suspicion. They must clear their names and unravel the deeper mysteries of Brith and the Neverborn. In doing so, they will uncover a dark secret, that threatens not only the game-world but the safety of their physical realm.\n\nSatire, science fiction, fantasy, and mystery combine in an epic adventure where no one ever leaves home, perfect for fans of Ready Player One and Douglas Adams.\n\nReview\n\n⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 3 out of 5.\n\nMeta by Xander Black is a new science-fiction fantasy adventure novel based on the concept of MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) in a PSW (a persistent state world) where millions of players can develop their characters in virtual reality. In simple terms, this book is based on a future where people spend most of their lives in virtual reality instead of living a normal life in the real world.\n\nThis book was a decent read though it did remind me too much of Ready Player One (which I thoroughly loved.) At some point, it got a bit overwhelming and I wanted to quit reading it, though knowing better, and trying not to draw comparisons between the two books because of their common concept, I kept reading and finished the book in the hopes that it would be different and I’m glad that I did because this book proved to be a good read with a nice ending.\n\nI liked the writing because it had a good flow but the efforts of the author to try and sound like Douglas Adam-ish felt pretty annoying and seemed to have killed the author’s natural writing style. I found the satire a bit forced and not correctly executed. Also, the book felt to have been lacking decent editing, it may be because I was sent a review copy and not the final book, but the copy if the copy I have and the final book are the same then the book obviously has editing issues. If the book’s final version is well-edited, it should make for a better read. Apart from these issues, as I previously said, the book was a decent read and would be a great fit for sci-fi and adventure genre readers.\n\nYou can also read this review on:\n\nGoodreads\n\nAmazon\n\nBook Review: The Rescue~ Book One of the Timestream Travelers Chronicles by Sher J.

The character of Enauria is beautifully crafted and as I already knew her, it felt like meeting an old friend. It felt like a side-quest in an RPG – that is how relatable the main character is.\n\nThis book is a companion story to Reflections Of Destiny but as the author clarifies it can also be read as a standalone novella. It intersects the world and the events of the RoD so I’d highly suggest reading them both as they both are great pieces of speculative fiction/fantasy.\n\nYou can also read this review on:\n\nGoodreads\n\nAmazon\n\nBook Review: Into the Violet Gardens by Isaac Nasri\n\nBook Details:\n\nAuthor: Isaac Nasri\n\nRelease Date: 16th August 2021\n\nGenre: Science-Fiction, Cyberpunk\n\nSeries:\n\nFormat: E-book\n\nPages: 252 pages\n\nPublisher:\n\nBlurb:\n\nThe year is 2024.

It could lead to a new beginning, or it might spell the end for the last vestiges of humankind. The generation ship Forever has left earth behind, but a piece of the old civilization lives on in the Inthworld—a virtual realm that retains memories of earth’s technological wonders and vices. A being named Lilith leads the uprising, and if she succeeds in setting its inhabitants free, they could destroy Forever.\n\nBut during the generation ship’s decades-long voyage, humanity has evolved. Liminals with the ability to connect with the world mind and the Inthworld provide a glimmer of hope. They’ll have to face not only Lilith’s minions, but also the mistrust of their own kind and persecution from a new government as homotypicals continue to fear what they can’t understand. The invasion must be stopped, the Inthworld must be healed, and the people of Forever must let go of their past and embrace what they’re meant to become.\n\nBook Review\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 4.5 out of 5.\n\nThe Shoreless Sea by J. Scott Coatsworth is the 3rd book in the series Liminal Sky and my third book by author J. Scott Coatsworth.\n\nWow! What a smashing ending to a brilliant series! If I have to sum up this series in a single sentence, I would say that all the time I put into reading this series was well worth it and I am really happy that I read it. For some reason (and a valid one too) I am a little sceptical when I am offered a series to review because more often than not, authors tend to either completely blow it, or fail to keep up with the one best book in the series. Both of which are pretty irritating and sad, to be honest. But I am so, so happy that this series did not turn out to be one of those: the story grew steadily, and the characterisation along with it, as the series progressed further with each book ending in a way that made perfect sense.\n\nI loved this book because it answered all the questions and tied pretty much all loose ends making it a perfect end to such an epic journey. And thankfully, it lived up to my expectations from it based on its prequels as a reader, so I was left very satisfied. The most amazing part is, I could see the improvement and growth, which is only natural, in the entire series, and this book turned out to be the best one. I loved the plot, the action and the politics involved were well structured and executed.\n\nI loved how the author made use of subtle and well-placed indirect metaphors and juxtaposition to get the bigger point across; we, humans, are indeed scared of things and concepts we do not understand or fail to understand for some reason and therefore are very quick to form an opinion against that concept or thing forgetting, very conveniently, that we are, in the end, beings of evolution and thus will have to accept the changes that we as a species and the overall nature has to undergo or experience.\n\nI’d definitely recommend not only this book but the entire series to all sci-fi and fantasy lovers. And if you’re looking for a new series to explore, I highly recommend Liminal Sky series as this series begins on a great note and ends at an even better note. Go for it, it is well worth the time and money!\n\nYou can also read this review on\n\nBook Review: The Rising Tide (Liminal Sky #2) by J. Scott Coatsworth\n\nAuthor: J.

Five years later, the remnants of humanity travel through the stars inside Forever: a living, ever-evolving, self-contained generation ship. When Eddy Tremaine and Andy Hammond find a hidden world-within-a-world under the mountains, the discovery triggers a chain of events that could fundamentally alter or extinguish life as they know it, culminate in the takeover of the world mind, and end free will for humankind.\n\nEddy, Andy, and a handful of other unlikely heroes—people of every race and identity, and some who aren’t even human—must find the courage and ingenuity to stand against the rising tide. Otherwise they might be living through the end days of human history.\n\nBook Review\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 4.5 out of 5.\n\nThe Rising Tide by J. Scott Coatsworth is the 2nd book in the series Liminal Sky and my second book by the author. In one sentence, I loved it!\n\nThis book picks up 5 years after where the first book ended and carries on from there. There is no Earth now and so this book is set in a humungous space-ship which sustains life. I loved the new settings. The world-building was impressive and I enjoyed imagining the life in this one-of-a-kind world throughout the book. Though the best thing about the book is the utopian dream that the villain nurtures. I loved it because whenever in a book, especially in sci-fi-fantasy books, the concept of a seemingly utopian dream is introduced, it invariably leads to the exploration of a lot of interesting as well as important themes. And that is exactly what happened in this book. Therefore, it won’t be wrong if I’d say that I actually liked this one better than the first book!\n\nEven though this book is a part of a series, you can read it as a stand-alone novel (at least, in my opinion,) because even though the events are carried forward, most of the book is based in a new world than the last one and except for a couple of main characters, the rest of the characters are mostly new – and that is kind of the whole point of this story, so you can definitely read it as a stand-alone. Anyway, reading the entire series is definitely recommended.\n\nYou can also read this review on\n\nBook Review: The Stark Divide (Liminal Sky #1) by J. Scott Coatsworth\n\nAuthor: J.

This is the story of one of them—43 Ariadne, or Forever, as her inhabitants call her—a living world that carries the remaining hopes of humanity, and the three generations of scientists, engineers, and explorers working to colonize her.\n\nFrom her humble beginnings as a seedling saved from disaster to the start of her journey across the void of space toward a new home for the human race, The Stark Divide tells the tales of the world, the people who made her, and the few who will become something altogether beyond human.\n\nHumankind has just taken its first step toward the stars.\n\nBook Review\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 4 out of 5.\n\nThe Stark Divide by J. Scott Coatsworth is a dynamic beginning to a new sci-fi fantasy series Liminal Sky that turned out to be equal parts entertaining and equal parts adventure. I was pulled into the story right from the beginning and was blown away by the fantastic world the author has created. This proved to be an unputdownable book with great pacing and tension. I am really looking forward to reading the next part of this amazing series.\n\nAlong with the main story, I also enjoyed the side plots just as much. The characters were really likeable, the story was good, the narration felt good and made the book a fast read and the flow of the story was amazing! I’d recommend this book to all sci-fi lovers, especially to those who like reading about LGBTQ side-themes.\n\nYou can also read this review on Goodreads and Amazon\n\nBook Review: 22 Dutch Road by T. C. Schueler\n\nAuthor: T.C. Schueler\n\nRelease Date: 13th January 2020\n\nGenre: Speculative Fiction Fantasy, Psychological Thriller, Horror, Urban Fantasy, Supernatural, Paranormal\n\nSeries:\n\nFormat: E-book\n\nPages: 492\n\nPublisher:\n\nBlurb:\n\nAn estranged son drives twelve hours to collect badly needed money from his father’s estate. The same ugly McMansion still sits behind a security wall, but there are new features: a gaudy slate roof, a 70s-style conversation pit, and nearly two dozen statues posted along the wall like sentinels. It makes no sense: Billy Buchanan’s scheming father was broke; where had these fierce, obviously valuable sculptures come from? Forced to spend the week at 22 Dutch Road, Billy begins believing these samurai-styled carvings can talk to him by day, and worse, move at night—his father might not be so dead after all.\n\nREVIEW\n\n★★★★\n\n22 Dutch Road by T.C. Schueler is a very unique blend of and a cross-over of a lot of interesting genres such as Paranormal horror thriller with elements of sci-fi fantasy and speculative fiction but still giving off the overall vibe of a fantasy read. So many things happen in this book that it is hard to get bored while reading it so it definitely made for an entertaining read.\n\nWhen I started reading the book, I was instantly pulled into the plot with a great opening and thankfully found myself involved and engaged with the story throughout till then end. The characterisation was okay but the writing was good along with the overall story-line.\n\nIt was a surreal read if I have to describe it in one word, and I really think that it is worth a read, so I’d recommend it to all the readers of sci-fi fiction-fantasy and paranormal and horror fantasy fans (well, that was quite a handful, innit?!)\n\nYou can also read this review on Goodreads and Amazon\n\nBook Review: Transference by B.T.

Only when Barrabas faces execution does he claim that another man committed his infamous crimes decades earlier. The authorities are suspicious. Is he the Madzimure of legend and a potential threat to Jovian’s new world order, or just another victim of transference?\n\nThe story of a grim personal mission, Transference takes the reader on a heart-racing journey through rebellion, revenge, self-sacrifice, and the soul’s search for identity.\n\nREVIEW\n\n★★★★\n\nTransference by B.T. Keaton made for a very thrilling story, with an unpredictable protagonist with a complex personality, coupled with a fast-paced plot-line made for a really compelling read. I was looking forward to reading this book right since the time I had a look at its blurb and to my great relief, the book was every bit as good as I had expected it to be.\n\nThe writing was really good and this book a very smooth and quick read.

A dark force swells in the heights of the Forty-Ninth Council, putting the galaxy in turmoil. The fate of everyone depends on one broken man.\n\nODDITY OF THE MAGICUS EYE is a monthly space fantasy from exciting new author, Patrick Malum. Be sure to first check out Part 1, also available on Amazon and Kindle Unlimited, and visit the official Oddity website for more.\n\nREVIEW\n\n★★★★\n\nOddity Of The Magicus Eye: Mokuura by Patrick Malum is the second episode in the serialised epic fantasy series Oddity Of The Magicus Eye and the sequel to Oddity Of The Magicus Eye: Patterns (Part #1).\n\nThis book was every bit as fun as the first one and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it from start to end. The book picked up where the last one left off and the reader is thrust into the action-filled world of Etheron. I enjoyed the plot as well as the narration and felt that my connections with the main characters deepened quite a bit as I read this part. So I have a lot of hopes and expectation from the next instalment in this series.\n\nThe best part about this episode-based series is that the author doesn’t repeat the plot points over and over again as is normally the case in book series. Being short episodes it is a given that either the reader is keeping up with the release of all parts and reading them monthly, or reading in all in one go, so there’s no unnecessary narration dedicated to the ‘catching-up’ of the earlier part(s).\n\nI’d again recommend this book as well as the series so far to all space-fantasy, epic fantasy and sci-fi readers.\n\nYou can also read this review on Goodreads and Amazon\n\nBook Review: Oddity Of The Magicus Eye: Patterns (Part #1) by Patrick Malum\n\nAuthor: Patrick Malum\n\nRelease Date: 26th September 2019\n\nGenre: Science-Fiction Fantasy, Young Adult, Space Fantasy, Serials,\n\nSeries:\n\nEdition: E-book\n\nPages: 75\n\nPublisher: WordBuzz Publishing\n\nBlurb:\n\nSixteen-year-old Elenah Lockwood dreams of what lies beyond her boring world of Etheron.

But there’s war and unrest, and it frightens him more than anything.\n\nAnd then there’s the kind and unassuming butler, Gilgan, who has seen the worst of what the galaxy has to offer and is now seeing signs of the very worst happening again. All is not well on Etheron — and in the galaxy — for a sickness swells in the murky galactic depths and it all begins with the Forty-Ninth Council.\n\nThe day the Council descends on Etheron begins like any other day . . .\n\nPATTERNS is the first episode of ODDITY OF THE MAGICUS EYE, the monthly space fantasy from the emerging young author Patrick Malum. Prepare for a tale of war, galactic politics, and ancient magic told like nothing else before it.\n\nREVIEW\n\n★★★★\n\nOddity Of The Magicus Eye: Patterns by Patrick Malum is the first episode in the serialised fantasy series Oddity Of The Magicus Eye. This is a very quick read and proved to be a complete entertainer. I enjoyed each and every bit of it.\n\nI enjoyed this book from start to end. It moved pretty fast and the tension was evident throughout all chapters making it a page-turner that I wanted to read in a single sitting. The plot was really good and the ending was perfect. I am now eagerly waiting to start with the next episode!\n\nThe writing was on point and complemented the plot well. The characterization wasn’t over-complicated and I really appreciated it because the characters were all pretty relatable and likeable (enough for me to have enjoyed reading and knowing more about them.)\n\nAnother thing I’d like to mention here is that I was really impressed by the author’s taste in designing this book, something that is always lacking in self-published books. The editing was also in place as was the proof-reading. The book looks gorgeous and compels the reader to pick it up because of how neat and professional it looks. It screams amazing things right from the cover and coupled with that intriguing blurb, the author has got the recipe for a really good book which is equally good on the outside as it is on the inside.\n\nI’d recommend this book to all sci-fi and fantasy readers as it’ll appeal to everyone who loves adventure and action coupled with space and magic. And the fact that it is in the form of short monthly episodes makes it all the more appealing.\n\nYou can also read this review on Goodreads and Amazon\n\nBook Review: A Time of Prophecy (The Outlands Pentalogy #5) by Rebecca Crunden\n\nAuthor: Rebecca Crunden\n\nRelease Date: –\n\nGenre: Dystopian, Science-Fiction Fantasy, Young Adult\n\nSeries: The Outlands Pentalogy (Book #5)\n\nEdition: E-book\n\nPages: 330\n\nPublisher: –\n\nBlurb:\n\nIn the years since Kitty, Nate and Thom escaped the Kingdom, the Plague has ravaged the population and the rebels have seized two of the northern countries. In an attempt to bring order to the chaos, the leader of the rebels, Nate’s old friend James, has agreed to hold trials for those responsible for intentionally leaking the Plague.\n\nUnfortunately, the rumour in the Kingdom is that Kitty is responsible. To make matters worse, Blaise tells Kitty that the Council, who still count her father as one of their own, are once again experimenting on Radiants. It’s a horrifying realisation that hits too close to home, and for the first time in her life, Kitty thirsts for vengeance. It’s a thirst that’s matched by the one person who has always been her mirror — her Complement, Thom.\n\nOn the other side of the Wall in the Outlands, desperate to bring Kitty home and finish the Council once and for all, Thom begins plotting, using the skills he’s long honed to outsmart those with more power. But outsmarting his enemies might turn Thom into the very thing he’s always feared becoming, and war soon seems the only possible solution to stopping the Council and the Hangman. But with more than a few looking to the ancient prophecy of peace, Thom searches desperately for a way to circumvent more bloodshed.\n\nYet the weight of the years have taken their toll, and as Thom’s physical and mental health deteriorate, Nate struggles with the fallout of past crimes, both the ones he did commit, and the ones he didn’t …\n\nREVIEW\n\n★★★★+1/2\n\nA Time Of Prophecy by Rebeca Crunden is the last instalment in The Outlands Pentalogy.\n\nWhat a great end to a great series! OMG, what can I say? There are YA books which revolve around such petty conflicts that they are entirely cringe-worthy and go a long way in destroying the reader’s trust in the genre itself, but then there are some rare gems, like this series, that come out of nowhere and restore your faith in a genre you thought was on the verge of being lost.\n\nThis book served as a great end to the series as it answered all the questions I had and provided me with a satisfactory closure. Most of the times, series continue to be great until the last book where everything falls flat or at the least, you are left disappointed or unsatisfied because nothing can do justice to the awesomeness of the story. Many times writers simply don’t know how to end a series and that is what ruins it entirely. But when it comes to this series, we have a writer who not only knows how to begin something epic and but also knows how to end it with the same rigour and grace.\n\nAnd this series deserved a good ending because it was such a thrilling, complicated, exciting and engaging story about gripping, strong, believable and well-developed characters in realistic and intricate settings. This dystopian series is a hundred times better than most of the “best-selling” series of today. I would happily place this series with the likes of Hunger Games and Six Of Crows because the characters in this series face bigger problems than teenage hormonal dilemmas and are relatable in an unbelievable way.\n\nThe writing in this book was on par with the other books so far and made the reading of this book a pleasant ride. The tension and pacing were apt and I finished this book in no more than 3 days, so it was a very quick read. I’d recommend this book to all dystopian and fantasy lovers and to those who want to explore a unique new series by a new author.\n\nCheck out the other parts in this pentalogy here: A Touch Of Death (The Outlands Pentalogy #1), A History Of Madness (The Outlands Pentalogy #2), A Promise Of Return (The Outlands Penology #3) and A Dance Of Lies (The Outlands Pentalogy #4)\n\nYou can also read this review on Goodreads and Amazon\n\nBook Review: A Dance Of Lies (The Outlands Pentalogy #4) by Rebecca Crunden\n\nAuthor: Rebecca Crunden\n\nRelease Date: –\n\nGenre: Dystopian, Science-Fiction Fantasy, Young Adult\n\nSeries: The Outlands Pentalogy (Book #4)\n\nEdition: E-book\n\nPages:\n\nPublisher: –\n\nBlurb:\n\nA year into the Outlands and life has only become more dangerous and complex for Kitty and her friends. Not only are the Outcasts hunting them, but Charles and Ciara are adamant about returning to the Kingdom to help, forcing everyone to take a side. To make matters worse, the leader of the Outcasts, Quen, has an unrelenting fascination with Thom and Nate that soon reaches horrific heights.\n\nAs tensions mount and the group begins to splinter, Riddle comes to Kitty with an unexpected request. A secret. One that makes them inseparable.\n\nKitty soon finds herself spending more and more time away from Nate and Thom, learning to fight and increasingly drawn into the ways of the Radiants. But Kitty and Riddle’s new bond doesn’t come without complications, and a decision made by the two of them threatens more than Kitty’s relationship with Nate …\n\nREVIEW\n\n★★★★+1/2\n\nA Dance Of Lies by Rebecca Crunden is the second last part in The Outlands Pentalogy and the sequel to A Promise Of Return. In this instalment, things progress slowly as compared to the other parts in this series till now, but nonetheless, they progress steadily giving the feeling that it is a slow build-up to something very important. And alas, the ending was a smashing hit because of such subtle build-up leading to it all throughout this book.\n\nI enjoyed reading this book greatly even because of the slow pace followed in most of the book because the story kept taking me forward and the air of inevitable danger lent it a really good vibe. The characterization was great as usual and we got to see Kitty again along with some other major characters. The ending was mindblowing and has created a lot of excitement for the last part of this series.\n\nAgain, I’d recommend this book as well as the entire series to young-adult and dystopian readers and also to anyone looking to get into a new series by a relatively new author.\n\nYou can also read this review on Goodreads and Amazon\n\nBook Review: A Promise Of Return (The Outlands Penology #3) by Rebecca Crunden\n\nAuthor: Rebecca Crunden\n\nRelease Date: –\n\nGenre: Dystopian, Science-Fiction Fantasy\n\nSeries: The Outlands Pentalogy (Book #3)\n\nEdition: E-book\n\nPages: 282\n\nPublisher: –\n\nBlurb:\n\nWhen Thom Anteros is arrested after breaking into the Building of Historical Records, he demands to be taken before the King.

Yet what’s to become of him is left in the hands of the one person Thom truly fears – Mickey Taenia, the King’s Hangman.\n\nInfuriated by Thom’s refusal to reveal the whereabouts of Nate and Catherine, the Hangman sends Thom to one of the worst places in the Kingdom – the slave markets of Muntenia. It is there that Thom is bought for the Red Arena: a barbaric, gladiator-type competition where the children of convicts and other unlucky souls are forced to fight to the death.\n\nTwenty wins is release. One loss is death.\n\nWith the help of Charles Thoreau, a fellow captive, Thom begins not only to survive, but to thrive. A master of words becomes a master of death, and Thom’s prowess in the arena frightens even him.\n\nBut death isn’t the only thing haunting Thom. As the days go by, he dreams of his brother, and the promise he cannot forget.\n\nI will return.\n\nREVIEW\n\n★★★★+1/2\n\nA Promise Of Return by Rebecca Crunden is the third book in The Outlands Pentalogy and the sequel to A History Of Madness. This was an absolute page-turner. I loved how the author explored Thom’s journey in this book apart from Nate and Kitty which helped the reader in understanding him better and more intimately.\n\nWe get to see and know more about the amazing universe that the author has created and some fresh characters which hopefully would be making an entry in the next parts. I enjoyed this book even more than the first two books and I can’t wait to dig in the next one! The writing, the plot and the characterization along with the plot-progression, world-building and the pacing and tension – everything, seems to develop for the better consistently throughout this series as far as I am concerned. And I am very sure that the next two books will have a lot in store for their readers.\n\nI’d highly recommend this book and the entire series to dystopian lovers! If you are into sci-fi fantasy and have a special love for well-written books, then you simply cannot miss this amazing series.\n\nYou can also read this review on Goodreads and Amazon\n\nBook Review: Bort’s People (The Sunset Of Magic #3) by Alistair Potter\n\nAuthor: Alistair Potter\n\nRelease Date: 11th February 2016\n\nGenre: Science-Fiction-Fantasy, Adventure, Quest, Magic Elementals\n\nSeries: The Sunset Of Magic (Book #3)\n\nEdition: E-book\n\nPages: 260\n\nPublisher: –\n\nBlurb:\n\nMagic, dragons, drama and adventure… did I mention the dragons? Lots of those! The wizard Zerphal, Bort and Lofti the Dunnit Sprite leap across the void between Nephus and the Harrowen homeworld, Mirt. Each have their reasons: Zerphal, an agent of the Council of Wizards, seeks to discover how his species, the warlike Harrowen, have managed to escape Mirt; Bort, on a mission of hope, to find out if any of his Trollid race, kidnapped and enslaved some some 300 years earlier, still survive; and Lofti… well… because a true friend would not allow Bort to make such a journey alone.\n\nREVIEW\n\n★★★★\n\nBort’s People by Alistair Potter is the third instalment in The Sunset Of Magic series and the sequel to The Counsel Of Wizards. It is a very entertaining sci-fi-fantasy adventure that has a mix of characters from both the previous books in this series who embark on an adventurous journey, which entails serious action, mild drama and a good emotional arc.\n\nThis book is in lieu of the previous one, and therefore, I enjoyed it to no end. It had good characterization and a well-written plot that progressed with an even pace. The tension rose and fell as needed and the action scenes were both well timed and well executed.\n\nI enjoyed reading this book as well as this series would definitely explore more books by the author. I’d recommend this book, and the rest by author Alistair Potter, to all sci-fi-fantasy readers, lovers of hardcore sci-fi and those who love adventure genre.\n\nYou can also read this review on Goodreads and Amazon\n\nBook Review: The Counsel Of Wizards (The Sunset Of Magic #2) by Allistair Potter\n\nAuthor: Alistair Potter\n\nRelease Date: 15th May 2014\n\nGenre: Science-Fiction-Fantasy, Adventure, Magic-Elementals, Quest\n\nSeries: The Sunset Of Magic (Book #2)\n\nEdition: E-book\n\nPages: 259\n\nPublisher: –\n\nBlurb:\n\nAction, adventure, magic and more! Scholarly Grant Moy is sent by the dying Wizard Torven to a distant world in search of the Council of Wizards. Without another wizard to inherit Torven’s legacy, all his vast knowledge and experience will be lost. Ahead are challenges and adventures beyond Grant’s wildest imaginings.\n\nREVIEW\n\n★★★★\n\nThe Counsel Of Wizards by Allistair Potter is the sequel to The Last Trollid, being the second book in the series Sunset Of Magic. This book is more of a magical adventure than anything else and I loved it for that. After reading author Potter’s books back to back, this one, even though being as technically detailed as it is, felt like a respite from hardcore sci-fi and gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling of a really great adventure story.\n\nI enjoyed reading this book a lot and liked the character of Grant Moy a lot. He was very relatable and I felt a connection to both, him and his quest. Some of the characters from the previous book also joined Grant on his journey and it was good to read about them in a bit lighter settings. I think this is so far my favourite book in the series (though I’ve just read two) and can’t wait to see what more do the author has in store for us in the next instalments.\n\nIf you’re an adventure and magical quest buff then you should definitely read this book.\n\nYou can also read this review on Goodreads and Amazon.\n\nBook Review: The Last Trollid (The Sunset Of Magic #1) by Alistair Potter\n\nAuthor: Alistair Potter\n\nRelease Date: 13th May 2014\n\nGenre: Science-Fiction-Fantasy, Thriller, Action, Adventure, Magic-Elementals\n\nSeries: The Sunset Of Magic (Book #1)\n\nEdition: E-book\n\nPages: 272\n\nPublisher: –\n\nBlurb:\n\nThere’s; world jumping magic, Dragons, ruthless invaders, epic battles, unlikely heroes, bravery, sacrifice, and a steam cannon worthy of Archimedes! And yes it does have wizards, both good and very bad. Romance? Yes, a little of that too! What more do you want in an adventure story?\n\nA disparate band: fussy spinster, Ida Fairweather; crusty old soldier, Endor Caffri; dishonest manservant, Moleskin; King’s guard, Lineth, and Last of the Trollid, Bort, engage in a desperate struggle against the Harrowen invaders.\n\nREVIEW\n\n★★★+1/2\n\nThe Last Trollid by Allistair Potter is the start to a new series The Sunset Of Magic. After having read three other books by the author, I was confident that this book is going to be a smashing read, and, thankfully, to a great extent, it was. Just like his previous books, this book had a brilliant premise and an amazingly awesome world built with a great deal of detailing. The pacing and tension were good as they both had good highs and lows and the overall progression of the plot can’t be faulted. So all in all, it was a good read.\n\nMy only problem was with the characterization, somehow, unlike in the previous instances, I was not able to feel a connection to either of the characters. I liked Bort and even Ida and Moleskin to some extent, but that was all, I just liked them enough to be able to read the book without wanting to stop, but not more than that. Still, I enjoyed the book, if for nothing than for the plot and some of the high-tension battle scenes and the ending, which was really well written.\n\nI’d recommend this book to all science-fiction readers, especially who prefer plot over characters.\n\nYou can also read this review on Goodreads and Amazon.\n\nBook Review: A History Of Madness (The Outlands Pentalogy #2) by Rebecca Crunden\n\nAuthor: Rebecca Crunden\n\nRelease Date: 14th July 2017\n\nGenre: Dystopian, Science-Fiction-Fantasy\n\nSeries: The Outlands Pentalogy – Book #2\n\nEdition: E-book\n\nPages: 258\n\nPublisher: –\n\nBlurb:\n\nThe four remaining fugitives are now spread across the Kingdom. And with the fate of the others unknown to him, Nate Anteros prays for a fast execution.\n\nYet execution does not come. After a meeting with the King which leaves Nate questioning his sanity, he’s sent to a workcamp in Argon Basin for five years of hard labour. It’s there that Nate learns what became of his friends upon their arrest.\n\nAnd as his strength returns to him, and he’s plagued by dreams which are much too real to be ignored, Nate decides five years is far too long to wait …\n\nBook Review\n\n★★★★+1/2\n\nA History Of Madness by Rebecca Crunden is the sequel to A Touch Of Death and the 2nd book in the Outlands Pentalogy. After reading the first book, and really liking it, I was really eager to read this one and to my pleasant surprise, this book turned out to be as good as (actually even better) than the last one. I love when a series goes from strength to strength and this series is turning out to be just that, though I’ve just read 2 books so far. Given the opportunity, I’d love to read the next part of this well-developed saga for sure.\n\nThe characterization was the highlight of this book. I loved how the author uses a different character as the main POV character for this part as it gave a fresh vibe to the series, instead of taking the story ahead with the same POV character. It was really good to know the motivations, inner conflicts, impulses and feelings of Nate as I really liked his as the main character.\n\nThe writing was good just like the last book and the world building was a true step ahead. I enjoyed reading this book a lot and would recommend this series to all dystopian readers and fantasy readers.\n\nYou can also read this review on Goodreads and Amazon\n\nBook Review: A Touch Of Death (The Outlands Pentalogy #1) by Rebecca Crunden\n\nAuthor: Rebecca Crunden\n\nRelease Date: 23rd February 2017\n\nGenre: Dystopian, Science-Fiction-Fantasy\n\nSeries: The Outlands Pentalogy – Book #1\n\nEdition: E-book\n\nPages: 306\n\nPublisher: –\n\nBlurb:\n\nA thousand years in the future, the last of humanity live inside the walls of the totalitarian Kingdom of Cutta. The rich live in Anais, the capital city of Cutta, sheltered from the famine and disease which ravage the rest of the Kingdom. Yet riches and power only go so far, and even Anaitians can be executed. It is only by the will of the King that Nate Anteros, son of the King’s favourite, is spared from the gallows after openly dissenting. But when he’s released from prison, Nate disappears.\n\nA stark contrast, Catherine Taenia has spent her entire life comfortable and content. The daughter of the King’s Hangman and in love with Thom, Nate’s younger brother, her life has always been easy, ordered and comfortable. That is, where it doesn’t concern Nate. His actions sullied not only his future, but theirs. And unlike Thom, Catherine has never forgiven him.\n\nTwo years pass without a word, and then one night Nate returns. But things with Nate are never simple, and when one wrong move turns their lives upside down, the only thing left to do is run where the King’s guards cannot find them – the Outlands. Those wild, untamed lands which stretch around the great walls of the Kingdom, filled with mutants and rabids.\n\nBook Review\n\n★★★★\n\nA Touch Of Death by Rebecca Crunden marks a really promising start to The Outlands Pentalogy series. This book has everything that can be expected of a good dystopian story – detailed and extensive world-building, believable characters, intriguing plotline, engaging twists and turns, even pace and oscillating tension. I enjoyed reading this book a lot and can’t wait to read the next one in this series.\n\nThe characterization is the backbone of any dystopian novel and thankfully, this book had not only believable and relatable characters but also the ones you easily fall in love with. I liked both Catherine as well as Nate and can’t wait to read more about them in the following parts.\n\nThe writing was pretty good and complemented such a tremendous plot well. The pacing was nice and even and the tension kept on increasing and decreasing in sync with the plot structure which kept me hooked throughout the book, from start to the very end. The book ended on a great note, setting high expectations for the sequel.\n\nAs I said, I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to all dystopian lovers.\n\nYou can also read this review on Goodreads and Amazon\n\nAudiobook Review: Seveneves by Neal Stephenson\n\nRelease Date: 19th May 2015\n\nGenre: Science Fiction Fantasy, Apocalyptic, Post-Apocalyptic, Speculative Fiction\n\nSeries:\n\nEdition: Audiobook\n\nLength: 32 hours\n\nPublisher: Brilliance Audio\n\nBlurb:\n\nWhat would happen if the world were ending?\n\nA catastrophic event renders the earth a ticking time bomb. In a feverish race against the inevitable, nations around the globe band together to devise an ambitious plan to ensure the survival of humanity far beyond our atmosphere, in outer space.\n\nBut the complexities and unpredictability of human nature coupled with unforeseen challenges and dangers threaten the intrepid pioneers, until only a handful of survivors remain…\n\nFive thousand years later, their progeny — seven distinct races now three billion strong — embark on yet another audacious journey into the unknown … to an alien world utterly transformed by cataclysm and time: Earth.\n\nReview\n\n★\n\nSeveneves by Neal Stephenson book was too heavy for me. The narration was slow and the story progressed so slowly in the first hour that when I realized the book was 30 something hours, I stopped it right there. You really need to like the narration enough if you plan to spend another 30 hours listening to it. And that was not how I felt, so I abandoned it. I have other books that I can read and enjoy in that much time (pretty sure I can read a good number of other books in that much time.)\n\nTHIS REVIEW IS ALSO POSTED ON GOODREADS\n\nBook Review: Challenges Of The Gods by C. Hofsetz\n\nAuthor:C. Hofsetz\n\nRelease Date: 7th January 2018\n\nGenre: Science-Fiction/Fantasy\n\nSeries:\n\nPublisher: The Wild Rose Press\n\nBlurb:\n\nAfter Mike goes through a gut-wrenching betrayal by his fiancée, he finds himself in what he thinks might be the afterlife. But this is no heaven. The gods made a mistake and created another Earth in a parallel universe, putting both universes in peril. They need someone from his planet to destroy the alternate, and Mike is randomly selected for the job.\n\nTrapped in an impossible choice, Mike accepts his mission and is returned to an Earth—and a body—so unlike his own. There, he meets Jane, who is—unbeknownst to him—the secret leader of an organization bent on tracking down Earth’s saboteur. In the face of her passion for humanity, Mike’s resolve falters. If Mike won’t complete his mission, the gods will.\n\nReview\n\n★★★★\n\nChallenges Of The Gods by C. Hofsetz is a new sci-fi fantasy novel with a very unique plot based a really good concept. I liked this book a lot because it differs from most of the new sci-fi novels as it had depth, good characterization and good world-building and the best part was the concept itself – it was both fresh and unique.\n\nThe characterisation was decent if not excellent but it did compliment the story as, for me, the real hero in this book was the story. The plot was complex and at times it took me a while to grasp what was really happening because of the thin border the author dared to tread in this book between two parallel realities, but that was as it should be and it proved to be a good stimulus for the brain.\n\nThe writing was really good and it made the reading of such a complex book very easy. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it highly to all sci-fi readers.\n\nthis review is also posted on Goodreads"
