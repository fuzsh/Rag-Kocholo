        "text": "About the Book\n\nStephenson's first novel is now back in print. With a plot that meanders through academic catch-22s; massive, sonic stereo wars; neon-worshiping cults; and a campus-wide civil war, this scathing send-up of American college life presages the rise and fall of one of the most imaginative novelists writing today.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nThe New York Times Book Review called Neal Stephenson's most recent novel \"electrifying\" and \"hilarious\". but if you want to know Stephenson was doing twenty years before he wrote the epic Cryptonomicon, it's back-to-school time. Back to The Big U, that is, a hilarious send-up of American college life starring after years our of print, The Big U is required reading for anyone interested in the early work of this singular writer.\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"Satire is Stephenson's major.\"--\"Los Angeles Times Book Review\"A satiric, apocalyptic look at life . . . one is reminded of \"Catch 22 . . . the author has beguiled us with a series of inventive episodes and stories, told in a witty, unusually clear and continuously fresh style. This is a most impressive debut.\"--\"Publisher's Weekly\"An entertaining and sometimes murderous satire on campus life.\"--\"New York Times Book Review"
