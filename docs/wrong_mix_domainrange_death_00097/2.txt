The composer died Wednesday night in his sleep after a long battle with cancer at his Beverly Hills home. He was 75. Goldsmith won five Emmys and was nominated for 17 Academy Awards winning only one.

The following are just some of the scores he wrote:

Movies:

Planet of the Apes

Alien

Star Trek: The Motion Picture

The Omen (for which he won his only Oscar)

Poltergeist

Patton

Basic Instinct

Chinatown

*

TV:

The Man From U.N.C.L.E

The Waltons

Barnaby Jones

Star Trek: Voyager

*

His wife, Carol, stated that when asked which score was his favorite, Goldsmith always repied, "My favorite score is the one I haven't written yet."

He used to lecture his film school students that if they were scoring a scene for a man on a horse galloping away, you don't score the gallop but you score the fear of the rider.
