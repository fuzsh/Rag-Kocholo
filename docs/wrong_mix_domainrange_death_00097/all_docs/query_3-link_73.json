        "text": "INTRADA Announces:\n\nALIEN\n\nComposed by JERRY GOLDSMITH\n\nConducted by LIONEL NEWMAN\n\nPerformed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra\n\nINTRADA MAF 7102\n\nOne of the most requested soundtrack restorations released at last.\n\nEarlier this year, Intrada issued the premiere release of Alex North's original recording of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, a score legendary for being replaced entirely from the film with preexisting music. The treatment of Jerry Goldsmith's score to Ridley Scott's ALIEN is legendary in its own right, and for very similar reasons. For this monster film set in deep space, Goldsmith composed one of his most complex scores, relying on acoustic instruments to deliver the chilling, otherworldly atmosphere of the alien ship and its monstrous occupants. It was akin to his approach to PLANET OF THE APES, where Goldsmith eschewed electronics in favor of unique acoustic instruments to illustrate the foreboding landscape and upside down society. To achieve this effect in ALIEN, Goldsmith augmented the National Philharmonic Orchestra with didjeridu, serpent, and conch shell, with additional eerie effects courtesy of the echoplex, a process Goldsmith deployed previously to great effect in his score to PATTON. The result -- a masterful sci-fi/horror score that would influence genre movie scores for years to come.\n\nDespite Goldsmith's artistic genius in creating a striking sci-fi score, the filmmakers severely tampered with his music. Much of the music was removed from the film or employed in scenes for which it was not intended. Several cues from Goldsmith's early score to FREUD were tracked in. Worse yet, his sublime main title, emphasizing the mystery and vastness of space, went unused. Under duress, Goldsmith, rescored the main title for a starker, more minimalist piece which is heard in the film. While Goldsmith wrote an end title featuring the same main theme in all its glory, it too was removed from the film in favor of a selection from Howard Hanson's Symphony Number 2. What is heard in the film is not Goldsmith's musical vision for ALIEN.\n\nA soundtrack LP released at the time of the film featured 35-minutes of highlights from Goldsmith's score, presenting it more as he intended, with the original main and end titles in tact. Sound quality of this release was dry and compressed, and there was still much music both used and unused that did not make it to the album.\n\nNow, nearly thirty years after the film's release in 1979, with the generous cooperation of Universal Music Group and 20th Century Fox, Intrada presents the complete original score as Goldsmith intended, rounded out with all the alternates and rewrites, providing everything Goldsmith recorded for ALIEN. The album was remixed from the recently discovered 1\" multi-track masters, bringing a new depth, detail, and crispness not heard in previous releases. Michael Matessino spent many painstaking weeks to deliver the striking results here, and also penning some of the most comprehensive liner notes written for a soundtrack, chronicling the saga of the genesis of the ALIEN score and its final results. This release is the final word on the complete ALIEN score, giving it the exposure and attention it has always deserved and giving admirers the album they have been craving for years.\n\nINTRADA MAF 7102\n\nIN STOCK NOW\n\nFor cover art, track listing, and sound samples, please visit\n\nhttp://shopping.netsuite.com/s.nl/c.ACCT67745/it.A/id.5613/.f\n\nMany thanks for this info - I'll be chasing up the new release.\n\nBut I disagree with the writer's attitude in the above article. Terry Rawlings and Ridley Scott speak at length on the Alien 'Quadrilogy' set about the issues with Goldsmith's score. They are entirely respectful and openly celebrate Goldsmith's incredible music - but Rawlings in particular makes a number of remarks that seem fair and entirely understandable. The 'temp' track for 'Alien' engaged a number of prior passages of music from Goldsmith (i.e. 'Freud'), for when editing Rawlings always tried to provide a temporary music track utilising the prior work of the composer who was contracted to score the film in question. Unfortunately (from Goldsmith's point of view), Scott and Rawlings felt that ultimately Goldsmith's work for 'Alien' in those few scenes (and end credits) didn't play as well as the temp track.\n\nIt's unfortunate, but it's wrong to talk about a director and editor 'tampering' with a film score. Scott and Rawlings were simply trying to realise the film as best they could, and unfortunately that resulted in Goldsmith being offended when his work wasn't used for some sequences. But 'Alien' is a prime example of a film where a number of unique talents and visions clearly collaborated to create an outright classic - often in outright disagreement. It's well documented on the 'Quadrilogy' set: O'Bannon, Giler, Hill, Scott, Rawlings, Goldsmith all speak of disagreements and different opinions regarding aspects of the material.\n\nNot to worry. The discs come with a very comprehensive booklet that covers all of the points you raised.\n\nThe one I have doesn't have the best fidelity, and I did an edit to make a complete intro track, using the booted version and part of the DVD soundtrack (where there were no sound effects).\n\nI don't have anything on Alien except the DVD with the isolated alternate score. I haven't ripped that yet, though. I wonder if there's much on this new CD set that's different from what's on the DVD.\n\nYes. Lots. In good fidelity.\n\nConsidering the amount of effort you already made for this music ( I made myself an Alien cd similar to what you describe, using the DVD isolated score), I'm pretty sure you'll be pleased with the new set. It's very thorough (for example, all three different verions of the intro/opening credits).\n\nIt's everything the new Blade Runner set should have been.\n\nI'm not sure if talk of this nature is allowed on the SH Forums, but last year Usenet sites had a flood of fan-based soundtracks for 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner'. The 'Alien' sets provided higher quality alternate (rejected) and temporary cues that resulted from (presumably) the new DVD sets, mixed with all the previously available material (a Spanish bootleg is very common).\n\nApologies if talk of this nature is not permitted on the Forum, but I offer it merely for comparison purposes.\n\nNow - if we can only convince Fox to release the 3 hour 'Alien' cut (ala the 'workprint' from 'Blade Runner'), I'll be a happy man.\n\nIt's just a pipe dream, I think. In actuality, any remarks made were probably referring to the rough assembly. Still, it's nice to dream.\n\nEven with the deleted scenes restored (as originally found on the 20th Anniversary edition), I can't imagine 'Alien' would run for 3 hours - only if the 'airlock' sequence had actually been filmed in its entirety (rather than merely the 'bridge' scene with Ripley and Lambert). That, coupled with the 'Cocoon Sequence', and perhaps longer cuts of the Brett and Dallas death scenes (in terms of the 'stalking' suspense element), might get closer to 3 hours. But, based upon remarks made by crew members about how fast Ridley Scott was doing set-ups per day when shooting the film (coupled with the heat from Fox brass), I doubt there's much 'fat' left in terms of unseen footage...\n\nI agree with you, though - both general consumers and aficionados alike have been tremendously well served by the DVD releases of 'Alien'. I can't wait for it to show up on Blu Ray! Maybe they've kept material BACK for it!"
