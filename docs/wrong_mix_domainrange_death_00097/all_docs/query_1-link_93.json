        "text": "Film Music Festival presents annually its Jerry Goldsmith Awards, internationally consolidated after acquiring a deserved popularity among artists and fans. Its aim has always been to recognize the work of musicians in the audiovisual sector (film, television, advertising or other areas), especially of those who, despite having a career, have not obtained a well deserved recognition. And always with particular attention to young composers, novice or that are beginning to have experience.\n\nIn a first phase, participants submit their creations to be assessed in the different categories included on its regulations. A second phase selects the finalists. And finally the winners are announced in each of the categories during a ceremony.\n\nJerry Goldsmith Awards are awarded in nine categories – feature film length, short film, videogame, documentary, television, performing arts, advertising / promotion, free creation & song -, along with a tenth award for the best composer of each edition. Its international consolidation has occurred for several reasons. On one hand its consideration, by composers and members of the audiovisual industry, as a platform for public recognition that focuses on talent little known or novel, as well as job opportunities that entails being a part of it. On the other hand, the undoubted quality and talent demonstrated by professionals and works that have been part of this awards. These awards have had the presence of professionals such as Alexander Cimini, Lucas Vidal, Arnau Bataller, Neal Acree, Zeltia Montes, Marc Vaíllo, Alan Williams, Zacarías M. de la Riva, Sergio de la Puente, Marc Helm, James Peterson, Stuart Hancock or Aritz Villodas as a small sample of some of its winners\n\nDOWNLOAD RULESPARTICIPATION FORM\n\nPrevious award winners\n\nI JERRY GOLDSMITH. 2006\n\nII JERRY GOLDSMITH. 2007\n\nIII JERRY GOLDSMITH. 2008\n\nIV JERRY GOLDSMITH. 2009\n\nV JERRY GOLDSMITH. 2010\n\nVI JERRY GOLDSMITH. 2011\n\nVII JERRY GOLDSMITH. 2012\n\nVIII JERRY GOLDSMITH. 2013\n\nIX JERRY GOLDSMITH. 2014\n\nX JERRY GOLDSMITH. 2015\n\nXI JERRY GOLDSMITH. 2016\n\nXII JERRY GOLDSMITH. 2017\n\nXIII JERRY GOLDSMITH. 2018\n\nXIV JERRY GOLDSMITH. 2019"
