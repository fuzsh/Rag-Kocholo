        "text": "About DRIFT\n\nDesign studio DRIFT was founded by Ralph Nauta (1978) and Lonneke Gordijn (1980), both graduates from Design Academy Eindhoven in the Netherlands (2005).\n\nWith a shared passion for watching human behaviour, DRIFT designs products, projects and concepts for interior and public space. Nauta is an expert in many crafts, materials and production techniques. Gordijn has a good sense for shape and strong concepts. Together they combine knowledge and intuition, nature and science fiction, ideology and reality. Their aim is to make original and passionate design of the best materials, and using the newest production technologies.\n\nStudio DRIFT aspires to timeless design full of energy, fantasy and interaction. The modular light object ‘fragile future’ was awarded the price ‘Light of the Future’ by the German Design Council in 2008. It also received the first price in Dutch art competition ‘Artiparti’ and the Young Talent Price of ‘Stichting MS-Research’.\n\nYou must visit their website..but be careful !\n\nIf their awesome projects won't seduce you...you will be seduced by Jerry Goldsmith's main theme for Basic Instinct movie on their homepage(1991) !\n\nIn case you are afraid of seduction....Yatzer features some of their projects below\n\nGHOST Collection\n\nDesign by Ralph Nauta and Lonneke Gordijn for DRIFT, 2007/2008\n\nMaterial: plexiglas of 60 mm thickness.\n\nSize: 36 x 48 x 84 cm\n\nThe GHOST is a futuristic concept of a chair, 3-dimensionally captured withinthe boundaries of\n\nreality. It gives you a dramatic feeling: unbelievable, high-tech, but beautiful! DRIFT sketches an image that cannot exist yet... But with todays techniques it becomes real. By doing this they deliberate their design from the trend of stereotypical forms. ‘Nowadays anything is possible with 3Dcomputer programs -you can even draw the impossible - so why fall back on the awkward design language of your grandma’s furniture?’(FRAME no. 59) With the GHOST Collection, Nauta and Gordijn want to make clear that it is time to start designing our own future!\n\nThe collection excists of 8 table chairs, two different arm chairs: the ‘Queen chair’ and the ‘King chair’, and one stool. The initial concept behind these particulair pieces comes from the old times when Kings reigned their kingdoms. The first chair was actually a throne for the King.\n\nOnly the King was allowed to sit down. The other guests had to remain standing as a sign of decency. Only during fancy dinners people were allowed to sit. All the chairs in the diningroom were part of\n\none collection, but from the shape you could see the social position. Of course the King’s chair was the biggest and together with the Queens chair, the only chairs with armrests. The guests at the table could sit on simpel chairs with only a backrest. The waiters sat on stools against the wall, ready to jump up to server the King.\n\nThe GHOST collection consists of 11 items and will be produced in a limited edition of 8 and 2 RP. In future we probably will add a few items to the collection, we think about making a table, lamp and a closet, using the same technique.\n\nThe chairs are handmade with the best materials and specialists from Europe. Two different techniques were combined in a new way and from this principle the first GHOST chair was born. The ‘inner ghost’ is created by lasertechnique. It looks random, but in fact every line has been designed. We tried to generate as 3-Dimensional shapes as possible, that don’t refer to any other shape at all. It had to look new and ‘never seen before’ but also naturall at the same time. The possibilities of creating any shape at all are unlimited within the boudaries of the material.It is an experiment in shape, high tech production methods and crafts.\n\nThis year at the Salone del Mobile Milan 2008, studio DRIFT presented their ‘GHOST collection’ for the first time in a solo exhibition. The work has been presented in Nhow-hotel at via Tortona 35 in Milan, from 16th untill 21st of April 2008.\n\nDANDELIGHT\n\nDesign by Lonneke Gordijn for DRIFT, 2007\n\nDandelight is a little luminous dandelion.\n\nThis little piece of real nature lightens up by batteryfood.\n\nIt shows the fusion of nature and electronics.\n\nThe poetic Dandelight' is carefully handmade in our Studio in the Netherlands Material: phosphorusbronze, electronics and real dandelionseeds (these seeds are lasting, because they are secured one by one to a led-light. anyhow this part is very fragile, and requires an accurate application) The light is numbered goes with a signed letter with instructions to make sure everything is clear how to handle this light.\n\nDimensions: 11x18x 5 cm\n\nIncluding: packaging and 9V battery\n\nFor sale from designdrift website and from Designboom\n\nAnd several shops in the Netherlands and Europe.\n\n(They are looking for distribution in other countries)\n\nDandelight was the basic idea for ‘Fragile Future’\n\nFRAGILE FUTURE\n\nDesign by Lonneke Gordijn for DRIFT, 2007\n\nFragile future is a modulair light system overgrowing the wall.\n\nOne module is a visible circuit with little dandelion lights.\n\nInspiration is a pinted circuit but here it is off the board and 3D.\n\nThe modules are easy to connect to the next one (in five different ways), while the switch-leg will continue. So it is possible to build a composition on a wall from just a few, up to 50 modules, according to the space and atmosphere.\n\n‘Fragile future’ is about the amalgamation of nature and technology. In the distant future these two extremes have made a pact to be able to survive. Fragile Future combines electronic systems and dandelions in a lightsculpture that overgrows the wall. Electronics are driven by the natural survival instincts. The fragile installation protects itself by pretending to be out of order when someone comes too close. This is the same mechanism as a poppy that drops its petal when you pick it, or a ladybird that acts as dead in your hand. The protectionsystem is an extra option in the installation, that operates by distance-sensors and a programmable chip. (It is not supplied in the installation for ‘Lights of the future’) Materials: electronics, phosphorusbronze, ledlights and seeds of dandelions.\n\nDimensions: 20x30x8 cm for one module ( 85 x 85 x 15 cm is the size of the installation for\n\n‘Lights of the future’, 6 modules)\n\n‘Fragile future’ has been awarded for several art and design prices:\n\n2005: Willy Worter price (inventorsprice of Dsign Academy Eindhoven) (fragile future I)\n\n2006: Young Talent award, MS Research (fragile future I)\n\n2006: Artiparti Award, first price (fragile future I)\n\n2008: Lights of the Future, German Design Council\n\nWATER WEB BENCH\n\nDesign by Ralph Nauta and Lonneke Gordijn for DRIFT, 2006/2007\n\ndimensions: 200 x 60 x 45 cm\n\nThis sofa for outside and inside use, came into being as a loveseat.\n\nPeople in love are always playing and teasing each other. Sitting on this bench you can play with the water as much as you like and the water plays with you and the bench. Water is pumped up from inside the bench to the seat and flows through the milling cutted pattern back into the sofa. Sometimes it flows underneath the person that sits on the bench. In the sunshine, the sparkling of the water is a contrast with the matt coating of the bench. The pattern is a spider web made under influence of drugs. This is a research of NASA back in the seventies. There are three different patterns and 3 different colours. Other colours on request. Water Web Bench is the first product that Ralph Nauta and Lonneke Gordijn designed together, so a true loveseat! Water pump and algae solvent are included.\n\nMODULE KITCHEN\n\nDesign by Ralph Nauta for DRIFT, 2006\n\nmaterial: Stainless Steel and Oak Wood\n\ndimensions: 60 x 60 x 95 cm up tp 60 x 180 x 95 cm\n\nThe Module Kitchen can be used the way a kitchen was meant to be:\n\nSmall animals can be skinned and cleaned after hunting, cutting vegetables can be done straight on the surface. Cooking is not clean, it is a rough, messy and precise adventure, that needs the right equipment. The Module Kitchen is for people who enjoy the basic necessities in life. Each kitchen function is a seperate module, so you can decide for yourself how to build your own kitchen. The differen modules can be placed in many different ways, against a wall or free in a space, inside the house or outside. And you can change the setup all the time, because they are not unmovable build into a house.\n\nIf you move to a new place, the kitchen can come with you!"
