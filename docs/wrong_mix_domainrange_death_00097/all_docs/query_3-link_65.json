        "text": "Christmas songs – love them or hate them, they are a ubiquitous part of the holiday season. We collected some favorite Christmas songs of the BTSB editors in this one list-article. From old classics to the more obscure pieces, here they are:\n\nThe Christmas Song\n\n“I just think it’s such a classic, and it’s kind of sentimental and warm.”\n\nJoulukertomus (Leevi and the Leavings)\n\n“It’s a very touching song that sometimes actually brings me to tears; there’s this bittersweet quality to it that makes it at the same time heartbreaking and yet somehow happy. We hear a story of an old couple who have spent Christmas on their own for years, but on Christmas Eve their daughter suddenly shows up unexpected with a small child in their arms. The story does not necessarily seem very happy, but at the same time there’s the delight of the old couple suddenly getting to spend a true Christmas once more.”\n\nI Don’t Care (Halford)\n\n“It is about the importance of not leaving everything to the last minute and a douchebag called Joe.”\n\nO Holy Night\n\n“It’s just incredibly beautiful and grand in terms of melody. There’s something about this song that makes you feel and appreciate the importance of Christmas celebrations. Plus, the old feel in the English version – words like yonder – makes you feel all warm inside.”\n\nChristmas Unicorn (Sufjan Stevens)\n\n“Christmas songs drive me nuts…but this non-traditional song is so weird and so awkwardly long that I have a soft spot for it.”\n\nVarpunen jouluaamuna\n\n“Besides being a good sitsit song, it’s super Finnish. I sang it with my dad at an elementary school class Christmas party (in the US) and I was so proud because everyone was like ‘wow, Finnish is such a pretty language!’ I think it is touching and pretty.”\n\n“Gremlins” soundtrack\n\n“Jerry Goldsmith’s tongue-in-cheek film score is made for those who like to approach the holiday season with a pinch of dark humor. There are plenty of charming moments, such as Gizmo’s lullaby, but it’s the zanier tunes like ‘The Gremlin Rag’ that make this Christmas creature feature tick.”\n\nJoulumaa\n\n“I’ve loved it ever since my choir days as a kid, when we had to sing it for the entire Christmas season in all our school events.\n\nHard Candy Christmas (Dolly Parton)\n\n“Especially good for when it’s not the best of Christmases.”\n\nRockin’ Around The Christmas Tree (Brenda Lee)\n\n“Not that this is some obscure song that needs to be highlighted, but I’ll always have a soft spot for it. I remember loving that scene in Home Alone that’s set to it, which has Kevin using carboard cut-outs of people to make it look like there’s a party going on inside. He had a bunch of ropes attached to some of the figures and was making them dance by moving his own arms up and down like crazy. As I kid, that’s how I always danced to this song! Whether I still do is another question…”\n\nGiv mig ej glans, ej guld, ej prakt (En etsi valtaa, loistoa)\n\n“There’s something in this song that awakens my respect, something grand and noble. And of course the song is really relevant now since we’re celebrating the 150th birthday of Sibelius this year.”\n\nSanta Baby\n\n“But it has to be the Eartha Kitt version.”\n\nMaa on niin kaunis\n\n“This was a favorite of my late grandma – she always sang this with special ardor. Even though I’ve been singing it for my entire life, I think it wasn’t until she passed away that I actually began listening to the words, and realized that they are probably the most beautiful lyrics I’ve ever heard. This song always fills me with hope and warmth.”"
