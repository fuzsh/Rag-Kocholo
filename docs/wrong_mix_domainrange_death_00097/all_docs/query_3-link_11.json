Over the last few years the composer had put up a gallant fight against this horrible disease and when possible continued to write new music for film and perform in front of his fans in concert. Perhaps fittingly his last recorded score was with friend and regular collaborator Joe Dante for Looney Tunes Back In Action. In the last few months of his incredible life the composer spent time with his daughter Carrie documenting his wonderful career for a planned book project.\n\nOur deepest sympathies to his family, friends and loyal fans. Visit our forum if you would like to leave a message.\n\nEmpire Falls\n\nAICN is reporting that Jerry Goldsmith will not be able to score Fred Schepisi's film Empire Falls. It is assumed that the composer's continuing poor health is the reason for this and with Game Of Their Lives in limbo to 2005 there isn't much good news to report. In the meantime the composer has been spending time with his daughter on a future book collaboration documenting his career. Empire Falls will now be scored by other Schepisi regular; Paul Grabowsky.\n\nBasic Instinct Available To Order\n\nPrometheus' new complete soundtrack CD to Jerry Goldsmith's critically acclaimed and Oscar nominated score to Paul Verhoeven's Basic Instinct is now available for pre-order from www.buysoundtrax.com. The impressive looking disc exceeds 74 minutes, includes a wealth of extra music at over 30 minutes and most notably includes the unreleased highlight Catherine and Roxy at over 5 minutes. Apparently even the composer himself, usually adverse to such releases, is said to be pleased with the new edition.\n\nPicasso At The Laplin Agile Comment\n\nThere is a short interview with Jerry Goldsmith at the Pittsburgh Live website where among other interesting comments he makes reference to the on/off project Picasso At The Laplin Agile. Goldsmith mentions he'll be collaborating with lyricist Paul Williams again on 'transitional songs' for the film. However, the project remains distant as Goldsmith's previous engagement with Fred Schepisi - Empire Falls will be in post production until May. Pittsburgh Live\n\n75th Birthday Concert - Jerry Goldsmith Not Attending\n\nThe Barbican website is reporting sad news that Jerry Goldsmith will not be conducting his 75th Birthday concert with the LSO on Tuesday 17th February, for health reasons. The concert will now be conducted by Dirk Brosse with a short message from the composer read during the concert. I'm sure this will still be an incredible evening and a wonderful celebration of Jerry Goldsmith's music, I hope all fans will still attend.\n\nWe wish the composer all the very best.\n\nBarbican Note\n\nThis Friday evening, the LSO was very sad to receive a phone call from Jerry Goldsmith to say that he is too unwell to leave his Beverley Hills home to travel to London for his 75th birthday celebrations with the London Symphony Orchestra. Jerry is bitterly disappointed as he desperately wanted to celebrate this special birthday with his long-standing supporters and the LSO and had been looking forward to this event for a long time. He will be sending a personal message to everyone at the Barbican concert on Tuesday 17 February.Barbican Link.\n\nSaturn Nomination For Jerry Goldsmith\n\nThe Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films has announced the nominations for The 30th Annual Saturn Awards and Jerry Goldsmith has been nominated for his score to Looney Tunes Back In Action.\n\nhttp://www.saturnawards.org/\n\nVarese Celebrates Jerry Goldsmith's 75th Birthday!\n\nVarese Sarabande has announced a mammoth limited edition box set of Jerry Goldsmith scores written for 20th Century Fox films. The 6 CD set is mixture of scores previously released by both Varese and FSM but more importantly contains 12 unreleased soundtracks! The set is strictly limited to 1500 copies and is quickly selling out. Varese have announced it will now ship 22nd March.\n\nThe inclusion of selections from Damnation Alley, believed to be lost is an event in its self and remains simply mind blowing. Though the majority of the electronic elements remain lost, therefore the selections are essentially the orchestral only cues. The only downside is a hefty price tag of $129, and the possibility of international customers being stung for import charges on top! Amongst previously available score highlights, the disc set includes the premiere release of music from:\n\nDamnation Alley\n\nVon Ryans Express\n\nThe Detective\n\nShock Treatment\n\nFate Is the Hunter\n\nAnna and the King\n\nA Tree Grows In Brooklyn\n\nS*P*Y*S\n\nThe Vanishing\n\nAlong with The Chairman, a suite from Alien and The Agony And Ecstasy prologue.\n\nThe disc is now sold out at the US Varese site, but Colosseum in Germany still say they have copies remaining!\n\nThe Soundtrack Event Of The Century - Order Now!\n\nGoldsmith On TCM\n\nIt's being reported that the classic movie channel's build up to the 76th Academy Awards will feature Jerry Goldsmith on the 22nd February (Best Score Day) introducing Superman: The Movie, The Magnificent Seven and The Wind and the Lion.\n\nGoldsmith TCM Interview\n\nBirthday Concert & Game Of Their Lives\n\nTo the relief of fans worldwide Jerry Goldsmith will be in London conducting the LSO for his 75th Birthday Concert. Goldsmith is also taking part in a special Arts Council event in which he will conduct one piece with Dirk Brossé conducting other music. This event is not open to the public! Also he will not be performing the special LSO commission discussed at last year's concert. This remains a work in progress and isn't ready.\n\nFinally contrary to reports in an American online paper regarding the new movie Game Of Their Lives, Goldsmith has not written his score yet. He begins work on this in the coming weeks of February.\n\nLimited Edition CDs To Celebrate Jerry Goldsmith's 75th\n\nAs Jerry Goldsmith's 75th Birthday approaches there is news on the horizon that a major label is planning a limited edition multi CD set to celebrate the composer's remarkable career and musical achievements to date. Expect announcements nearer the big day!\n\nExpanded Basic Instinct From Prometheus\n\nFSM Magazine has printed news of a new expanded CD of Jerry Goldsmith's critically acclaimed score to Paul Verhoeven's Basic Instinct. Ford Thaxton has confirmed this release will be the complete score . Recently Goldsmith himself gave it his approval by saying he enjoyed the new album. The CD is due for release in April.\n\n75th Birthday Concert Programme Announced\n\nThe LSO website has updated its concert page for Jerry Goldsmith's 75th Birthday concert at the Barbican Centre in London on the 17th February with the programme for the evening. Along with some old favourites we have music from Looney Tunes but surprisingly no mention of the special piece Goldsmith was commissioned to write for the LSO last year?\n\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture\n\nMedley of motion picture themes:-\n\nThe Sand Pebbles\n\nChinatown\n\nAir Force One\n\nA Patch of Blue\n\nPoltergeist\n\nPapillon\n\nBasic Instinct\n\nThe Wind and the Lion\n\nLooney Tunes: Back in Action\n\nSuite from Masada\n\nThe Generals:-\n\nMacArthur\n\nPatton\n\nTiny Creatures:-\n\nSmall Soldiers\n\nGremlins\n\nMedley of television themes:-\n\nThe man from U.N.C.L.E.\n\nDr. Kildare\n\nRoom 222\n\nStar Trek: Voyager\n\nThe Waltons\n\nPrologue to The Agony and the Ecstasy\n\nSoarin' over California from Disney's California Adventure\n\nIf you haven't booked your ticket then do so now at the LSO Website!\n\nHal Shaper 1931 - 2004"
