The second half of the concert, also conducted by Newman, will be entirely devoted to Goldsmith's music from the 1980s and 1990s, including First Blood (1982) and Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983); newly assembled suites from Poltergeist (1982) and Basic Instinct (1992); and the entire six-minute finale from Rudy (1993).\n\nIn addition, Newman will conduct a seven-minute sequence from Legend, Goldsmith's composer's famously rejected score from the 1985 Ridley Scott film. The \"dress waltz\" sequence – newly restored by Newman from the composer's original, recently discovered sketches – will be performed live to film.\n\nGoldsmith, one of the film world's most respected composers, died in 2004. This is the third and final year of the AYS's \"Goldsmith Project,\" which has featured symposia and concerts each year, including newly assembled and performed suites of Goldsmith film and television scores.\n\nBoth events are free to the public, although tickets for the evening performance must be obtained in advance.
