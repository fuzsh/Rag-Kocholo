        "text": "Enigmatic composer Jerry Goldsmith died this past Wednesday at the age of 75. Though he created hundreds of film scores and won an Oscar, Goldsmith never achieved the fame of some of his peers.\n\nWeekend Edition commentator Andy Trudeau particularly recommends these Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack recordings:\n\nThe Blue Max (1966) [Sony LK 57890] A traditionally orchestrated score evoking both the wonder of flight and the hard edge of combat. Goldsmith at his Richard Straussian best.\n\nL.A. Confidential (1997) [Varese Sarabande VSD-5885]\n\nA modern film noir stylishly matched by GoldsmithÂ’s moody, rhythmic score. An Oscar nominee that should have won the prize.\n\nThe Omen (1976) [Varese Sarabande 302 066 288]\n\nGoldsmith's Oscar-winning score. A bravura mix of chorus and full symphony orchestra in the ultimate showdown between good and evil.\n\nPatton (1969) [Varese Sarabande VSD-5796]\n\nPerhaps Goldsmith's most famous main title. Echoing horns in triplets and a rousing martial theme dominate this successful biopic.\n\nPlanet of the Apes (1968) [Varese Sarabande VSD-5848]\n\nDon't look now, but it's a 12-tone score for a big-budget blockbuster. Goldsmith proves that modernism and storytelling are not incompatible.\n\nTotal Recall (1990) [Varese Sarabande 302 066 197]\n\nAn orchestral tour de force and one of Goldsmith's personal favorites.\n\nCopyright 2022 NPR.
