        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nThe Dark Crystal (1982) This Jim Henson/Franz Oz collaboration was visually impressive and dramatically anemic in 1982, and the passage of four decades has not diminished the former nor improved the latter. Its David Odell screenplay (from a screen story by Henson) is an oleo of warmed-over Tolkein crossed with Henson’s old ”Land of Gorch” sketches for “Saturday Night.” The picture is short on both humor and wonder, although the puppetry is, as usual for Henson, beautifully designed and managed. It’s essentially Elves vs. Orcs for control of the future, with the Orcs represented by vulture-like creatures called Skeksis, and the outcome is never in doubt. Since there is no suspense, and the characters are defined more by what species they are than by what they say or do, there’s little to occupy either mind or heart. (The most interesting characters are the astronomer Aughra, whose voice was provided by Billie Whitelaw, and the Skeksis Chamberlain skekSil, voiced by Barry Dennen.) It’s certainly worth seeing once, for the puppet designs and for Oswald Morris’ richly textured photography. The recent 4K UHD edition is sumptuous-looking.\n\nThe Gay Divorcee (1935) After their brief duet on “The Carioca” in Flying Down to Rio set up a public clamor for more, a re-teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers by RKO was inevitable. Their first starring vehicle was an adaptation of Astaire’s last Broadway success (The Gay Divorce, a title apparently taboo under the Production Code) and in the blinkered tradition of Hollywood studio lunacy the entire Cole Porter stage score was tossed with the exception of “Night and Day,” its biggest hit. Although the movie isn’t as buoyant as the team’s best work it’s a lively picture, funny, absurd and engaging. It also sets the template for the Astaire-Rogers series: Initial dislike of Fred by Ginger (or like followed by misunderstanding leading to dislike, or some other variation on the theme), cast of wacky supporting actors (such as Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore, Erik Rhodes, the wisecracking Helen Broderick or, here, the charming Alice Brady), screwball complications, a romantic dance and, if we’re lucky, a challenge. I’m one of those oddballs — Pauline Kael was another — who prefer the non-romantic Fred & Ginger routines to their more celebrated ballroom turns, except (as in Follow the Fleet and Swing Time) when the duets are dramatic. Many think the essence of Astaire and Rogers are items like “Cheek to Cheek” and, here, “Night and Day,” and they’re marvelous expressions of romance but they don’t, at least for me, carry the absolute joy of “I’ll Be Hard to Handle,” “Let Yourself Go” and “Pick Yourself Up”… the latter pair of which, juxtaposed that way, sound like an answer in one of those ironic double-feature puzzles. Dances like those sum up the appeal of Astaire and Rogers as a team far more than the formal love-duets; although they, like the ballroom dances, were thoroughly worked out, they feel spontaneous in a way the romantic dances never can. You get a sense, despite the sweat, of the joy of performance in “Isn’t it a Lovely Day (To Be Caught in the Rain?),” for example, and despite Astaire’s displeasure at being part of a team again after his sister Adele broke up the act, of the pleasure each performer took in the other.\n\nThe Gay Divorcee was directed by Mark Sandrich, who guided Astaire and Rogers in more pictures than anyone else, and his crisp style is as much a part of the team’s work as those white Art Deco sets and the loopy plots, usually cobbled by Allan Scott or Dwight Taylor. (This one was written by by George Marion Jr., Dorothy Yost and Edward Kaufman, but the original stage book was by Taylor.) David Abel’s beautiful cinematography, evident here, was on display in five of the nine pictures Astaire and Rogers made together at RKO as well as Holiday Inn, also directed by Sandrich. In this initial offering, the producers (or producer, since Pardo S. Berman was credited) hadn’t yet grasped that Astaire and Rogers were what people wanted to see, not elaborate musical numbers with a cast of thousands, so we get “The Continental” for 17 exhausting minutes, only a few of which are given over to Ginger and Fred. Worse, the creators assigned an entirely extraneous number to Edward Everett Horton(!) and a young Betty Grable, “Let’s K-nock K-nees,” which when I see it always makes me think of Arlene Croce’s riposte in The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book: “Must we?” The “Night and Day” dance, on the other hand, based on the stage version choreographed by Fred, is one of the duets people who love the team remember best, and it’s beautifully worked out. The picture ends with another of Fred’s cleverly conceived dances from the stage show, in which he and Rogers sail over the sofas and chairs of his hotel suite, and it’s so casually charming it makes you grin in deep appreciation.\n\nA personal note: I first saw The Gay Divocee at a summer afternoon library screening about 40 years ago. Seated behind my friend and me were a pair of elderly Jewish women, complete with Molly Picon accents. When the picture began with nightclub patrons, including Fred, playing with little legless dolls through which their forefingers were inserted to make them “dance,” one of the women cooed happily to her companion, “Cute!… is that cute?”\n\nI can never see this movie without recalling the pleasure my friend and I got from that, at that moment and for years afterward in the remembering.\n\nTwilight’s Last Gleaming (1977) A very effective nuclear-nightmare thriller directed by Robert Aldrich which did not find much love when it was released but which deserves a far wider audience. Based by Ronald M. Cohen and Edward Huebsch on a good early ’70s novel by the reliable Walter Wager the story, about a band of escaped convicts led by a former Army general who take over a missile launching site, while far-fetched, is taut and tidy and builds nicely to its unexpected conclusion. Burt Lancaster is the general (of course) and his gang includes the always-wonderful Paul Winfield and a typically weaselly Burt Young. On the government side are the unmatchable Melvyn Douglas as the Secretary of Defense, Joseph Cotten as the Secretary of State, Richard Widmark as a duplicitous Air Force general, the excellent Gerald S. O’Loughlin as the White House chief of staff, and Charles Durning as the president. The part was offered to Henry Fonda, who passed, and Durning not only delivers a superb performance, but the role turns out to be the great one of the picture.\n\nCohen and Huebsch cannily upped the ante for Lancaster, making what in Wager is merely a bid for money and freedom far more selfless and democratically sound (the general becomes a kind of Ellsberg figure), making the climax both shocking and inevitable. Aldrich, whose direction seems to me ideal for a movie of this kind, makes extensive use of split-screen throughout the picture, feeling that “you couldn’t tell that story in less than three hours without them.” There are times when the split-screens feel excessive, although it’s possible they would seem less so on a big theater screen. Yet they’re brilliantly manipulated overall, and even when the dialogue in one panel overlaps with that in another, you never miss who is speaking or what is being said; as with Howard Hawks’ overlapping dialogue, nothing of importance is lost. The movie’s crystalline cinematography is by Robert B. Hauser, the kinetic editing is by Michael Luciano, William Martin and Maury Winetrobe and Jerry Goldsmith provided a brief but very effective musical score. The terrific supporting cast includes Richard Jaeckel, William Marshall, Leif Erickson, Charles Aidman, Charles McGraw, John Ratzenberger and, in too brief a role, Roscoe Lee Browne.\n\nRoberta (1935) Such were the vagaries of the 1930s Hollywood studio system that Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, fresh from their triumph in The Gay Divorcee, were cast as supporting characters in this adaptation of the Jerome Kern/Otto Harbach stage musical. One doesn’t mind so much that their over-the-title co-star is the charming Irene Dunne; that Randolph Scott is given equal weight is practically an offense against God and Mammon. His performance in this, and in the subsequent Follow the Fleet (see below) leave one to marvel that he ever had an important career, or that he may have been the love of Cary Grant’s young life. I hope at least he was good in bed, because he certainly stinks up this movie.\n\nWhen Fred and Ginger are on screen, or Helen Westley as Dunne’s eponymous dress-designing aunt, or Dunne herself is singing “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” Roberta is first-rate entertainment. So let’s concentrate on those strengths, shall we, and forget if we can Scott’s performance and the number of times he says something is “swell”? Fred plays a bandleader, and gets a lively number (“Let’s Begin”) with his musicians, notably Candy Candido, with whom he does a kind of genderfuck bit avant la lettre. Ginger is Fred’s American former girlfriend, passing herself off as a Polish countess (I’m not kidding) in Paris. Although Astaire and Rogers do one of their ballroom specialties, to “Lovely to Look At” and “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” their two other numbers are a lot more fun: The satirical “I Won’t Dance” and “I’ll Be Hard to Handle,” one of those joyous episodes of thoroughly worked-out yet seemingly impromptu hoofing that were, even more than their signature romantic duets, their peculiar specialty. On the debit side, Dunne has to perform “Yesterdays,” featuring one of Harbach’s worst sets of lyrics. No singer, not even one as lyrical as Irene Dunne, can be expected to triumph with lyrics like,\n\nYesterdays\n\nDays I knew as happy sweet\n\nSequestered days […]\n\nThen gay youth was mine\n\nAnd truth was mine\n\nJoyous free and flaming life\n\nForsooth was mine\n\nWho in the 1930s talked like that, let alone sang? That last bit is so convoluted and linguistically passé it occasioned one of Billie Holiday’s few recorded lyric flubs.\n\nWilliam A. Seiter, most of whose pictures were mediocrities, directed with intelligence and a certain gracefulness of style that does what it can to make the material seem more interesting than it is. Alan Scott was one of the three credited screenwriters, and the author of the movie’s “additional dialogue” was the same Glenn Tryon who starred in the 1926 silent comedy 45 Minutes from Hollywood, with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy in brief cameos, and who would go on to star in two movies (Lonesome and Broadway) for the expressionistic Hungarian director Paul Fejos before drifting into screenwriting and direction.\n\nBetty Boop: The Essential Collection, Volume I – IV (1930 – 1938) These four Blu-Rays from the sadly now defunct Olive Films represent both the best of the series produced by Max Fleischer and directed by his brother Dave, and the worst. The Fleischers weren’t entirely to blame for the decline of the Betty Boop cartoons; once the Production Code went into full force, Betty was made less sexy and more respectable, and it killed her character: Her innocent sexuality was what made her so appealing; without that she had no real reason for being. External pressures to one side, there is absolutely no excuse for items like the 1937 Betty and Grampy short Zula Hula with its astonishingly crude and insensitive African caricatures. The Fleischers have been criticized for things like turning Louis Armstrong into a cartoon cannibal chasing Bimbo and Koko the Clown in I’ll Be Glad When You’re Dead, You Rascal You (1932) but the natives in Zula Hula are offensive beyond my ability to comprehend the why of them. You could almost forgive that if the damn thing was funny, but none of the later Boops is amusing in the slightest. It was as if, having been robbed of the slight, daring whiff of salaciousness that clung to Betty’s character, the Fleischers didn’t know what the hell to do with her. The animation in the shorts continued to be exceptional, but what good is that if you aren’t laughing?\n\nFortunately the discs contain all the great Betty Boop cartoons from the early ’30s, when the Fleischers’ invention, sense of humor and casual surrealism were in their glory. (Speaking of stereotypes: There are several “pansy” gags in the Bettys; when a Frankenstein monster threatens her in Betty Boop’s Penthouse and she hits him with plant spray he turns first into a ballet dancer and then into a literal pansy.) One of the visual aspects of the Boop shorts I like best are the thick, Art Nouveau lines around the characters; it gives them a distinctive look that can’t be mistaken for the product of any other studio. The Fleischers were enamored of the Rotoscope technique Max had developed and used it, I think, excessively. This is nowhere better illustrated than in the 1938 Thrills and Chills, in which when Betty skates on the ice she becomes weirdly elongated, and it’s obvious her head and body have been drawn over those of a live model… and the business just goes on and on, as if Dave was so in love with the process he just couldn’t stop Rotoscoping.\n\nJust as Disney and Ub Iwerks were the products of their Midwestern upbringings, the Fleischers were New York to their core. That’s reflected not only in the daring sexiness of the shorts but in their soundtracks, which not only tend to the jazzy; several times they employ jazz and swing musicians, especially Cab Calloway, who is in three Betty Boop cartoons, cleverly Rotoscoped. In the bizarre Minnie the Moocher (1932) he appears as a walrus with a bobtail; in the fantastic The Old Man of the Mountain (1933) he’s the eponymous villain; and in what may be the single best entry in the series, the 1933 Snow-White, the Wicked Queen in her witch guise transforms Koko into a ghost with long human legs who dances to “Saint James Infirmary” via Calloway’s hip vocal and trademark sliding movements. Other disc highlights: The wildly surrealistic Bimbo’s Initiation (1931) satirizing fraternity rites; the clever Stop That Noise (1935); the two-strip Technicolor Poor Cinderella (1934) featuring Max’s beloved 3D effects, achieved through the use of small motorized sets against which the animated drawings were superimposed; the charming Parade of the Wooden Soldiers (1934); the melodrama spoof She Wronged Him Right (1934); and Betty Boop’s Bizzy Bee (1932) in which she runs a diner whose sole menu item seems to be hotcakes.\n\nSunset (1988) An amiable pastiche written and directed by Blake Edwards (based on unpublished manuscript by Rod Amateau) set in late-1920s Hollywood and teaming Wyatt Earp and Tom Mix to investigate a murder mystery involving studio power, gangsters and the fabled corrupt Los Angeles law enforcement James Ellroy has built a career on. That Earp is played by James Garner and Mix by Bruce Willis, on the cusp of his Die Hard stardom, is a good indication of the charm factor attending this slight but most enjoyable fantasia from one of the last great American purveyors of pleasure at the movies.\n\nGarner had played Earp 20 years earlier, in the post-OK Corral The Hour of the Gun, and it was bitter portraiture, grim and obsessive. The Earp of Sunset is more mellow if no less tough and determined and Garner gives the sort of relaxed, intensely likable performance that had become his personal metier, nicely matched by Willis’ laconic good humor. The autumnal cinematography was the work of Anthony B. Richmond, Henry Mancini provided a tuneful, engaging musical score, and the rich supporting cast includes Mariel Hemingway, Kathleen Quinlan, the director’s daughter Jennifer Edwards, Richard Bradford, M. Emmet Walsh, Joe Dallesandro, Dann Florek, Dermot Mulroney, the wonderful Patricia Hodge as the wronged woman in the case and Malcolm McDowell as her shady, dangerous husband. A truly sick character, McDowell’s is perhaps the ultimate creative expression of the difference between a beloved public clown and his dark private persona. Edwards, who had directed Peter Sellers in six pictures, had been around Hollywood for decades and who suffered throughout his life his own periods of debilitating depression — not for nothing was he known by his friends as “Blackie” — knew that comedy produces more than its share of unusually disturbed individuals.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Earp really did serve as a technical advisor in Hollywood, for Mix and others.\n\nThe Last Picture Show (1971) Criterion’s new 4K UHD edition of Peter Bogdanovich’s 1992 Director’s Cut convinces me that this rich evocation by the filmmaker and Larry McMurtry of the latter’s early novel depicting adolescence in a blighted 1950s Texas town is not only among the finest of all American movies of the 1970s but quite possibly Bogdanovich’s best work.\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1941) John Huston’s debut as a screenwriter-director and the second important step in Humphrey Bogart’s ascendancy to stardom following High Sierra retains its status as one of the most perfect entertainments of the studio era. The “Warner 100” 4K UHD edition brings out of the rich quality of Arthur Edeson’s already sumptuous lighting.\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) Another old favorite revisited in its recent 4K UHD restoration. Last year’s 4K Cinderella unaccountably destroyed the beauty of Marc Davis’ miraculous rendering of its heroine’s fairy-dust transformation before the ball. This version of Snow White on the other hand is mouth-watering, the movie’s already remarkable look burnished and enhanced by the process.\n\nTexasville (1990; Black-and-White Director’s Cut) Included on the new Criterion edition of The Last Picture Show, this warm-hearted sequel is presented in the form its director envisioned; In black-and-white, and lengthened by nearly 30 minutes, deepening the relationships and bringing out more of its comic values.\n\nTop Hat (1935) No one should be forced to choose a single Astaire-Rogers musical, and I am always torn between this one and Swing Time. Top Hat is probably the better movie: it’s swifter, more sparkling, lays some nice emphasis on those two incomparable sissies Eric Blore and Edward Everett Horton, and boasts a perfect Irving Berlin score including a title song that elegantly sums up the appeal of Fred Astaire, whom Graham Greene once called the human equivalent of Mickey Mouse. That isn’t the insult it seems; in the early ‘30s Mickey was not yet the figure of dull respectability he became; he was rambunctious, elastic, mischievous, even slightly cruel — just like Fred.\n\nPerhaps inspired by their “Let Yourself Go” duet in Follow the Fleet Astaire and Rogers also get a challenge-dance here to “Isn’t This a Lovely Day (to be Caught in the Rain?)” that is not only among their half-dozen or so best routines, it’s also a rapturous expression of the sheer joy of performance. If these two didn’t fall in love after a number like that, one of them would have to be frigid and the other gay. After the requisite complications, masquerades and misunderstandings, the pair performs Berlin’s lilting, sensuous “Cheek to Cheek” in a Venice ballroom and featuring Ginger’s feathered dress which, although it drove her partner to distraction, proved that she understood what looked best on her when she danced with him; and another of those new dance sensations, “The Piccolino,” led off by Ginger’s charming verse and chorus. This brings me to a side-note: However wonderful a performer Fred Astaire was — and aside from his status as the finest dancer the movies have ever known he was also one of the American songbook’s great stylists — compare the way he listens to Ginger singing with the way in which she takes in his vocalizations: He smiles a lot but looks faintly glazed; she hangs on every word whether she’s facing him or not, and always seems to be hearing them for the first time. She not only (in the cartoonist Bob Thaves’ memorable phrase) “did everything Fred did, backwards and in heels”; at times she also acted him off the screen.\n\nAll of the members of the RKO Astaire-Rogers machine were involved here: The producer Pando S. Berman; the director Mark Sandrich (he made five of their pictures, and his style is modest but elegant and his pacing is nearly always perfect); the screenwriters Allan Scott and Dwight Taylor; the cinematographer David Abel, whose polished black-and-white photography is what we think of when we remember the Astaire-Rogers pictures, along with those gloriously anachronistic all-white Art Deco sets designed by Carroll Clark but erroneously attributed the wonderfully-named Van Nest Polglase (Venice never looked so clean); the choreography was by Fred with Hermes Pan; the musical direction and orchestrations were by Hal Bourne; and the cast includes Erik Rhodes as a silly, English-mangling Italian co-respondent, Horton as Fred’s manager, the vermouth-dry Helen Broderick as his wife and Blore as his butler Bates, who feuds with him throughout and whose machinations resolve the plot. The main titles, incidentally, are fairly unique for their time, with first Fred’s feet and legs dancing into the frame and appearing above his name, and then Ginger’s. It’s a marvelously stylish gesture, almost a shorthand, one that hints at the spirited revelry to come.\n\nProduced on a relatively lavish Depression-era budget of $609,000, Top Hat brought in $3.2 million at the box-office, and became the most profitable RKO release of the decade.\n\nFollow the Fleet (1936) Adhering to the pattern set by Roberta in 1935 (and why would you want to?) RKO once again made Astaire and Rogers more or less subservient to Randolph Scott. As if that wasn’t bad enough the men play sailors, and Astaire’s idea of expressing his working-class bona fides is to constantly be chewing gum.\n\nWell, at least Irving Berlin wrote the songs. Ginger gets the sexy “Let Yourself Go,” which she and Fred then dance to, in an “impromptu” ballroom contest exhibition. It’s one of their most joyous numbers, performed by both of them with a rubber-legged, loose-limbed panache that makes you smile broadly throughout. Most of Fred’s numbers are done with his Navy band (“We Saw The Sea,” “I’d Rather Lead A Band,” “I’m Putting All My Eggs in One Basket”) but Harriet Hilliard, the future Mrs. Ozzie Nelson (and mother of Ricky) has a splendid solo in “Get Thee Behind Me, Satan.” I know I’m in the minority in believing this to be one of Berlin’s finest ballads, but it is in any case beautifully framed by the director Mark Sandrich and his cinematographer David Abel, and at least partially redeems the horrible “Why, without your glasses you’re beautiful!” old-maid cliché Hilliard is forced to endure before she sings. (Berlin originally wrote the song, interestingly, for Rogers to perform in Top Hat. Obviously, he thought well of it.) What makes Follow the Fleet special, however, and secures it a place in movie musical history (or at least, in Astaire-Rogers iconography) is the “Let’s Face the Music and Dance” number. It was the most dramatic entry in the series until “Never Gonna Dance” in Swing Time displaced it a year later, and its seriousness of intent — it begins with Fred and Ginger in a gambling den, separately losing their bankrolls and contemplating suicide — is almost shocking in the context of so light an entertainment, and the dance between them is so charged with unstated emotionalism it’s hair-raising.\n\nThe screenplay was credited to Allan and Scott Dwight Taylor with “Additional Dialogue,” as they used to say, by Lew Lipton. At least in this one Randolph Scott doesn’t say “Swell!” every other line. Sharp eyes will spot Betty Grable as a trio singer, Lucille Ball in a small role and Humphrey Bogart as a sailor. The Hubert Osbourne 1922 play Shore Leave, on which Follow the Fleet was based, incidentally, had a long afterlife: It was also the source for the 1927 Vincent Youmans musical Hit the Deck, itself filmed by MGM in 1955.\n\nTouch of Evil (1958) Kino’s 4K UHD edition of the dark, unsettling Orson Welles thriller reminds us that this skewed police procedural is one of the key pictures, both in Welles’ filmography, and of the decade in which it was made.\n\nThe Trial (1962) Orson Welles‘ adaptation of the Kafka novel has always been the movie of his I like least… or was, anyway, before I saw his television film of the Isek Dinesen The Immortal Story, which I like even less. I feel in this a bit like the filmmaker’s disciple Peter Bogdanovich, whom Welles never tired of twitting by referring to The Trial as “that picture you hate.” It’s difficult to say exactly what it is about it that leaves me cold; it’s one of those movies that works in nearly every individual scene yet never comes together for me in a fully satisfying manner. In the early ’80s I heard an academic posit on “All Things Considered” that Dr. Strangelove could not be considered an entirely successful satire because there isn’t a single sane character in it, but Candide is brilliant satire and no one could consider its eponymous hero remotely sane until the end. Still, there is no one in Welles’ version of The Trial with whom we can entirely identify, and perhaps that’s the problem. The confusion of Anthony Perkins’ Josef K. about what is happening to him is palpable (Perkins is very good) but, at least as the writer-director of this movie envisions him, K. is snide and ambitious and guilty of indeterminate social crimes that distance him from us as surely as he distances himself from his insurance company employees by occupying an elevated office from which to conspicuously lord it over them.\n\nWelles was famously forced to improvise his sets for The Trial when the funding fell through, filming the picture in the then largely abandoned Gare d’Orsay, which has since become the Musée d’Orsay, and the riveted walls give the images an otherworldly quality that adds measurably to the picture’s feeling of an endless nightmare. The new 4K UHD Criterion print restores the movie it to something I assume approximates its original pictorial brilliance, light and shadow beautifully in balance. (The richly textured cinematography was by Edmond Richard.) In addition to Perkins, Welles gets marvelous performances from Jeanne Moreau, Romy Schneider, Elsa Martinelli, Suzanne Flon, Akim Tamiroff, Madeleine Robinson, William Chappell and himself as the satanic Advocate, smoke cigar rising from his head like something emerging from the vents of Hell.\n\nFor the record, I admit I liked The Trial a little better this time. Perhaps in another 10 years and another five screenings I’ll come to consider it one of Welles’ best… but I doubt it.\n\nCopyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nBlocks come to all writers if they live long enough. Mine began in 2004; it is with me still. Usually, and despite chronic major depression, I manage to work around it, when the need to express myself is at least as great as the forces working against that expression. Sometimes the block gets the upper hand. The last three months or so it has been in the ascendency, most likely exacerbated first by an antidepressant medication that seemed to me to be doing me no good and, possibly, a degree of harm and second by an unusually heavy and long-lived load of seasonal allergens in this part of the world.\n\nFurther, deponent sayeth not.\n\nAugust\n\nStay Hungry (1976) An amiable and often very funny comic drama adapted from Charles Gaines’ novel by Gaines and the director Bob Rafelson set in and around the body-building culture in Birmingham, Alabama. Like the Hal Ashby-directed The Landlord (1970) the movie focuses on a wealthy, dissolute young man involved with a collection of oddballs, and in both pictures the youth is played by a Bridges. In The Landlord the young wastrel was the talented Beau, in Stay Hungry Jeff, the best young film actor of his generation. As the new owner of a small, struggling downtown gymnasium whose secret weapon is an aspiring Mr. Universe contestant Bridges displays that good-natured, open quality that has been his agreeable specialty pretty much from the start. As the object of his romantic interest, Sally Field makes plain that while she was not getting the roles she might have she had been working toward them, and it is no accident that “Sybil” awaited her on television, and Norma Rae on film. The biggest surprise of Stay Hungry, however, and its greatest pleasure, is the performance by Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Mr. Universe aspirant. If you know him only from the later, more famous, roles in which he exhibited an unpleasant belligerence that was matched only by his seeming invincibility, you won’t be prepared for how genial he is here, nor how sweet. (I missed this picture when it opened in 1976 but did catch the dopey live-action Road Runner cartoon The Villain three years later, and “sweet” was exactly the word for his performance in that one too.)\n\nThe movie is filled with eccentrics, and they’re well cast, with R. G. Armstrong as the gym’s sexually insatiable owner, Robert Englund and Roger E. Mosley as his slightly wacked-out employees, Woodrow Parfrey as Bridges’ gently cynical uncle, Scatman Crothers as the disappointed family retainer, Fannie Flagg as a prattling socialite, Joe Spinell as a good-natured goon, and Helena Kallianiotes, Kathleen Miller, Joanna Cassidy and Ed Begley Jr. filling in the remaining assortment of kooks and local color. Stay Hungry plays a bit like an impoverished Robert Altman picture, and although it takes an unexpected and ugly turn near the end when Armstrong goes bananas and presumably rapes Field — the filmmaking is ambiguous on that point — the movie is, generally, lighter on its feet than was the usual case for pictures of its type, especially coming from Bob Rafelson, whose work tends to have very little air in it. Victor J. Kemper’s sunny, dappled cinematography also makes it exceptionally good-looking.\n\nI’m not sure what it all added up to, but I certainly had a good time watching it unfold.\n\nThe Good, The Bad and the Ugly (1966) The 4K UHD edition from Kino Lorber of this perennial favorite is mouth-watering, and as with Rio Bravo and the 1973 The Iceman Cometh, I am always amazed when watching it just how swiftly a very long movie can unreel when the people who made it know their business.\n\nThe Goddess (1958) Paddy Chayefsky’s slightly fictionalized portrait of Marilyn Monroe (he even offered Monroe the role, which she gave serious thought to taking) is less than the sum of its considerable parts but worth seeing for the screenwriter’s rich, plummy dialogue, and for the performances, particularly that of Kim Stanley in the leading role. Although Stanley is physically wrong for it — the polite word for her facial features would I think be “unprepossessing,” and it’s impossible to imagine her becoming a screen sex-symbol, at least in America — she gets the emptiness of goddess’ inner life, and the hysteria encased within her lonely and essential despair. There’s a sequence early on, in which she’s playing the character as a movie-besotted teenage girl and delivering a monologue about her desires, where the 32-year-old actress guilelessly (and rather astonishingly) transforms herself, fully and believably, into a 16-year-old.\n\nLloyd Bridges plays the DiMaggio figure, and he’s more impressive than you might imagine. Steven Hill as the Arthur Miller surrogate is more than that, as is Betty Lou Holland as the girl’s first astonishingly selfish, then religiously obsessed mother. Patty Duke plays the goddess as a young girl, Elizabeth Wilson is wonderfully steely as her protective (possibly Lesbian) secretary and Werner Klemperer gets a nice turn as a “Supposed Old and Dear Friend,” as he identified, who doesn’t really know the woman. Arthur J. Ornitz’s black-and-white photography is beautiful, sharp and evocative, and the musical score by Virgil Thompson is far more sensitive than is the norm for dramas of its period.\n\nJohn Cromwell, a good journeyman filmmaker, directed intelligently and efficiently if with no particular pictorial distinction. Chayefsky only once had a really great director (well, twice if we include Ken Russell’s wild, funny version of Altered States, which the screenwriter somewhat unaccountably took his name off). Arthur Hiller did all right by The Americanization of Emily and The Hospital, but “all right” doesn’t seem nearly enough for a writer with the dramatic/rhetorical gifts of a Paddy Chayefsky. Only with Network, directed by Sidney Lumet, do we get a Chayefsky picture whose saturated, almost documentary visual style perfectly sets off and contrasts with the rococo extravagance of the words being spoken in it.\n\nBlack Sunday (1977) The new Arrow Blu-ray of this taut, occasionally dazzling thriller based on Thomas Harris’ debut novel beautifully reproduces John A. Alonzo’s sumptuous widescreen photography and retains the picture’s slight aura of bittersweet nostalgia, at least in this viewer, for a time in American studio movies when intelligence mattered as much as expensive special effects and high-concept action sequences.\n\nHeat (1995) The 4K UHD edition of Michael Mann’s nonpareil policier looks splendid, and watching it gives me the opportunity to offer an observation I’d meant to make before concerning this procedural masterpiece: Has anyone else noticed that in the otherwise effective and superbly written diner meeting between Al Pacino and Robert De Niro there is not within the scene a single shot of the two together? But for the fact that the restaurant was real and Mann had only a few hours on a single night between its closing and opening hours to get the sequence, the actors might have been filmed at different times, for all we can tell from the images and the editing. Why bring two powerhouses like Pacino and DeNiro together and then only shoot them separately?\n\nHoliday Inn (1942; 4K UHD) Like the later (and lesser) Blue Skies, this Irving Berlin song-fest pits a singer (Bing Crosby) against his dancer rival (Fred Astaire) for the affections of an aspiring young performer (Marjorie Reynolds) and as with Blue Skies, Bing is the nice guy and Fred the amoral cad who will stoop to any deceit to get what he wants. It’s not how anyone who loved Astaire on the screen wanted to see him, and I wonder why the studios (or anyway Berlin, whose original “stories” these were) kept forcing it on the most gifted performer the movie musical ever had.* It almost presents itself as a hostile gesture toward him. Was Berlin in some way jealous of his star?\n\nThat said, the picture is engaging and smartly directed by Astaire’s old RKO compatriot Mark Sandrich from an amusing screenplay by Claude Binyon. (The playwright Elmer Rice is credited with the “adaptation,” whatever that means. I smell a Writer’s Guild arbitration afoot.) The choreography by David Abel is at least a step up from the dances in Blue Skies, and Fred works in a real humdinger in “Say it with Firecrackers,” an unusually boring Berlin melody saved by Astaire’s literally explosive routine. Nothing, however, can salvage Crosby’s blackface tribute number to Abraham Lincoln, which even in 1942 must have set race relations back 50 years.\n\nThis, by the way, is the picture that introduced “White Christmas,” and Crosby’s wistful/regretful vocal reprise of it, staged on an empty Hollywood studio set, probably helped sell not merely the movie but the 50 million copies of the record that supplemented it. Der Bingle also gets a nice ballad in “Be Careful, It’s My Heart” and Astaire’s “You’re Easy to Dance With” is a highlight as well. Their challenge duet “I’ll Capture Your Heart Singing (Dancing)” is pleasing and indeed the picture itself goes down easily, despite the dumb plot and that awful “Abraham” bit. (Berlin almost redeems himself with a nifty couplet in Crosby’s song “Lazy” which runs, “With a great big valise full/Of books to read where it’s peaceful.” I don’t think any other American songwriter ever rhymed “peaceful” with “valise full,” or in any case did it so charmingly.)\n\nThe recent 4K UHD restoration is attractive.\n\n*Although, come to think of it, Astaire himself was to blame for another one, Second Chorus, for which he was also one of the producers and which he later deemed his own worst picture.\n\nTwilight (1998) Robert Benton and Richard Russo’s engaging Valentine to the classic private-eye picture, with wonderful work by its cast, especially Paul Newman, Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon, James Garner and Liev Schreiber.\n\nSeptember\n\nWill Penny (1967) Much to my own surprise (and half of growth after all is the capacity for surprising oneself) I have happily spent the last few weeks reading Charlton Heston’s book The Actor’s Life: Journals, 1956-1976 and savoring his sharp, terse descriptions of his experiences making movies. I was compelled to sit down with the book after seeing the recent, beautiful Kino Blu-ray release of this, Heston’s own favorite among his pictures and one of the finest Westerns ever made. His performance as Will ranks with the great acting jobs in Westerns — with Henry Fonda in My Darling Clementine, John Wayne in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and The Searchers, James Stewart in Winchester ’73 and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Robert Ryan in Day of the Outlaw and Walter Brennan in Bad Day at Black Rock. It suggests that a man I had, until first seeing Will Penny, never imagined could be a great movie actor might, with enough good roles like this, have stretched into one. Alas, on film (as perhaps opposed to the stage, to which he returned more often than most of us knew and about which he appears to have been passionate) he seldom got the chance.\n\nMidnight Run (1988; 4K UHD) Speaking of surprises, this was one of the most pleasant of its year. Perhaps the most enjoyable variation on the “buddy” movie template since The Sting, the picture pits Robert DeNiro’s laconic bounty hunter against not only the quixotic embezzler (Charles Grodin) he’s been tasked with bringing in but the mob the CPA has betrayed, the FBI which is also after him, a rival bounty hunter (John Ashton) and, although he doesn’t realize it until too late, the bail-bondsman (Joe Pantoliano) who put him on the scent to begin with. It sounds perhaps more complicated than it is. Written with wit and intelligence by George Gallo and directed with assurance by Martin Brest, the picture not only delivers enormous pleasure at regular intervals, it takes time out for incisive dialogue, character development that does not embarrass the actors or test the patience of the viewer, and offers, in Grodin’s wry, funny performance, the best role this gifted comedian had after Heaven Can Wait 10 years earlier.\n\nDonald E. Thorin’s muted cinematography looked good in 1988; in the recent 4K UHD edition it’s spectacular. Danny Elfman’s blues-based score is brief but effective and there is a marvelous supporting cast which includes Yaphet Kotto as a dyspeptic FBI agent, Dennis Farina as a mob boss and Jack Kehoe as a wormy turncoat.\n\nFlying Down to Rio (1933) Remembered chiefly as the first picture in which Fred Astaire danced with Ginger Rogers. This happens in a silly but infectious number called the “Carioca,” which among other things involves the partners pressing their foreheads together. Somehow Fred and Ginger carried off that indignity with enough panache that movie audiences of 1933 demanded more of them, and you can see why; their joy in performing together was obvious. (Of course, having spent his entire performing life partnered with his sister Adele, recently retired to England, Fred was most definitely not in the mood to be yoked again to another dancer. After The Gay Divorcee in 1934 became one of the biggest hits of its year, however, the matter was effectively out of his hands.)\n\nWhile the plot, based on an unpublished comedy by the playwright and lyricist Anne Caldwell,* is perfunctory, the leads, Dolores del Río and Gene Raymond, are engaging, and the picture has a nifty gimmick: Scenes of Brazilian life that, through the creative use of the optical printer, become living picture-postcards, each flipping past to reveal the next. There is also, in Fred’s enthusiastic title number, a shocking moment (presumably the work of the movie’s producer, Merian C. Cooper, the begettor of King Kong) when during an aerial routine a young woman falls screaming from a trapeze below a biplane. She’s rescued, of course, but it’s an electrifying bit, and I wonder if George Roy Hill and William Goldman had it in mind when they made The Great Waldo Pepper 40 years later. As Arlene Croce wrote in The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book, “Merian C. Cooper brought terror to the movie musical.”\n\nThe songs, which include a very likeable solo number for Ginger called “Music Makes Me,” were by Vincent Youmans, with spritely lyrics by Gus Kahn and Edward Eliscu. Flying Down to Rio is also notable for pairing two incomparable comic sissies, Franklin Pangborn and Eric Blore, as a hotel manager and his simpering assistant. Blore would come into full flower, as it were, in his later Astaire & Rogers appearances.\n\n*Caldwell, one of the most prolific librettists of her time, frequently collaborated with Jerome Kern. Together the pair wrote one of the most charming numbers heard in a stage musical (She’s a Good Fellow, 1919) of the early 20th century, “The Bullfrog Patrol.” This delightful harmonized duet, originally performed by the Duncan Sisters, virtually defines what the Germans mean by the term Ohrwurm, which we translate as “earworm.” Caldwell is virtually forgotten today, but my hat is off to a lyricist who could write a line like, “I wish that Bolsheviki froggy-dog would croak!” I realize the song is written (and composed) in a minstrel form, which today puts it, I suppose, automatically beyond the… er… pale… but listening to Jeanne Lehman and Rebecca Luker’s 1992 version of it always gives me enormous pleasure.\n\nBonnie Scotland (1935) Not one of Laurel and Hardy’s very best features, despite the seven credited writers involved, including Chaplin’s old collaborator Albert Austin and Stan himself. (How many more went without a credit?) Stan was also, with Hal Roach, one of the producers, so he comes in for the lion’s share of both the credit and the blame. The worst aspect of the picture is the superfluous love story involving June Lang and William Janney, although Janney is rather fascinating in a gruesome sort of way. It’s almost two short pictures pressed uncertainly together: In the first, Stan and Ollie come to Scotland to (they think) collect Stan’s share of the MacLaurel fortune. In the second they accidentally sign up with a Scottish regiment of the British Army and end up in India and pitted against both their dour commanding officer (James Finlayson) and a local belligerent (Maurice Black) bent on the regiment’s destruction. From a post-war, anti-imperialist perspective, the white-man’s-burden aspect of the movie sits a little uneasily today, especially considering the genuine horrors inflicted on Indians by the British Raj. And while the finale is a direct steal from the hilarious 1927 silent With Love and Hisses, the first “official” Laurel and Hardy short, there are, as usual with L & H, several very funny bits, especially an extended sequence in a rooming house involving a frying fish, Ollie’s trousers, a hot cook-stove and a termagant Scots landlady.\n\nJames W. Horne directed, but really, you don’t care who directs Laurel and Hardy, do you?\n\nThe Enforcer (1951) Humphrey Bogart’s last picture at Warner Bros. is a largely splendid depiction of a crusading D.A. (Bogart, of course) based on the real-life Burton Turkus, the prosecutor of several members of Murder, Inc. The movie, intelligently written by Martin Rackin and beautifully photographed by Robert Burks, is a solid crime-drama, enacted by a terrific cast which aside from Bogey includes Ted de Corsia, Everett Sloane, Michael Tolan, King Donovan, Bob Steele, Adelaide Klein, Don Beddoe, Tito Vuolo, Patricia Joiner and, in a demanding role, a pre-Blacklist Zero Mostel. There is, however, a moment in which Bogart threatens a woman and her child with jail for her and institutional slow-death for the boy unless she coughs up the information he wants that is absolutely bone-chilling. I’m sure at the time it was seen as morally defensible but you would be forgiven for finding it a sick-making justification of, as Eliot M. Camarena noted, “Might makes right.”\n\nRaoul Walsh was an uncredited director on The Enforcer, and was said to have overseen most of the picture including the finale and all of its suspenseful moments, after the credited filmmaker, Bretaigne Windust, fell ill early in the filming. Yet Wikipedia assures me this is “A film by [emphasis mine] Bretaigne Windust.” I realize it’s far too late to strangle unthinking auteurism in its cradle, but can’t we apply a little elder-assisting euthanasia to the problem?\n\nThe Absent-Minded Professor (1961) A likable comic fantasy from Walt Disney with a relaxed, pleasant titular performance by Fred MacMurray and some very good special effects overseen by the (as-usual) uncredited Ub Iwerks. This is the first of Disney’s comedies to be set at and around the fictional Medfield College, the later stomping ground of Kurt Russell in the “Dexter Reilly” pictures. Bill Walsh’s screenplay works to a formula for these things, one I suppose was begun with The Shaggy Dog in 1959 (which was co-written by Walsh) wherein something fantastic — transformation by a teenage boy into a canine in the previous movie, the accidental creation of a substance MacMaurray’s character calls flubber here — leads to comic complications and a fair amount of slapstick before the inevitable happy ending. The nonsense is carried out with genial flair, nicely directed by Robert Stevenson and amusingly acted by a cast of old pros including Nancy Olsen, Keenan Wynn, Leon Ames, Edward Andrews, Belle Montrose, Alan Carney, Forrest Lewis, James Westerfield, Gage Clarke and Alan Hewitt. (The young pro in the cast is Tommy Kirk.) Only Eliot Reid, as MacMurray’s stuffy academic rival for Olsen’s hand, is truly bad, alternately nasty and hysterical. Thankfully, however, he is more than balanced by Ed Wynn who shows up, hilariously for those who know his radio history, as the Medfield Fire Chief. Equally impressive in his own small way is “Charlie,” the professor’s appealing little bearded collie mutt.\n\nSon of Flubber (1963) At the time, a rare Disney sequel — Walt disliked returning to where he’d already been; he should have only lived to see what the company bearing his name has gotten up to in the last few years when that is all they do. Most of the Absent-Minded Professor cast returned for this one although some, like Ed Wynn, play different characters, and like its predecessor it was directed by Robert Stevenson and co-written by Bill Walsh (with Don DaGradi, who with this picture became Walsh’s permanent writing partner). It’s less inspired than the previous movie and feels entirely unnecessary, but it has some nice moments, the best of which is the sequence early on with the IRS agent played by Bob Sweeney where he patiently explains to the recently-wed MacMurray and Olsen that they owe thousands in taxes for money they’ve yet to receive from the government. Olsen’s role here in even more thankless than in The Absent-Minded Professor, and the character’s actions feel less justified than merely petulant, and (alas) Eliot Reid is back as her jilted suitor. Fortunately, the real comedians in the cast deliver. These include Keenan Wynn, Tommy Kirk, Leon Ames, Ken Murray, Alan Hewitt, Joe Flynn, William Demarest, Jack Albertson, Joanna Moore as a femme fatale, and, reprising their roles in the previous picture, Edward Andrews, James Westerfield, Alan Carney and Forrest Lewis. Paul Lynde has a showy, funny role as (hold onto your hats) a sportscaster, the delightful Charlie Ruggles appears at the climax as a judge and Ed Wynn gives an utterly charming performance during the trial as a surprising “surprise witness.” Little Charlie the mutt also returns, and you have to admire his patience in being forced to act under an indoor rainstorm.\n\nPrometheus (2012; 4K UHD) Ridley Scott, the director of the 1979 Alien, also made this exciting, visually impressive variation. (I refuse on principal to use the barbarous neologism “prequel” to describe anything.) Scott had long talked about returning to the original derelict spacecraft explored by John Hurt and company in the first picture to discover who the enormous “space jockey” was, and how he got there, and Prometheus was apparently intended as the first installment of at least three. Unfortunately, a fatal miscalculation in the second (see below) derailed that project before it could be fully developed, and this is an especial shame because no one was better positioned to do it than Scott, and none of the directors of the Alien sequels had his extraordinary eye.\n\n(I find Scott’s arrogance nearly as hard to take as James Cameron’s, as for example when on the Prometheus commentary he never once mentions the names of the movie’s writers. I also, however, recognize his talent as a director: A Ridley Scott movie may be vacuous, but it always looks great. Jon Spaihts wrote the original screenplay, and Damon Lindelof completed the polish. Each in his separate commentary on the Prometheus home video acknowledges the contributions of the other, and especially that of Ridley Scott, who could learn a thing or two about graciousness and humility from his apparently unmentionable writers.)\n\nThe picture is ingeniously plotted, and occasionally shocking, as when the character played by Noomi Rapace, realizing she has been impregnated with an alien form, undergoes an excruciating, self-directed robo-operation to remove the thing from her middle before it kills her. Michael Fassbender as the synthetic David is a revelation, Charlize Theron does wonders with her small but pivotal role and Idris Elba is marvelous as the ship captain. Guy Pearce’s appearance as the ancient corporate patriarch Peter Weyland is puzzling unless you know that the sequences of him as a younger man were cut by 20th Century-Fox before the movie’s release. Someone also cut Theron’s best line, a riposte to her father, presumably to tamp down the bitterness of the scene… which is, I submit, what the scene is about. Dariusz Wolski’s cinematography is often breathtaking, and there is as well a good atmospheric score by Marc Streitenfeld, although his compositions are effectively dwarfed by the interpolation of a beautiful theme by Harry Gregson-Williams and Jerry Goldsmith’s original from Alien. The 4K UHD edition is striking.\n\nAlien Covenant (2017; 4K UHD) Although this follow-up to Prometheus is admittedly more suspenseful and viscerally exciting throughout than its predecessor, it’s undone by a truly nasty and disturbing climax, one which I imagine through audience word-of-mouth likely sunk the movie at the box-office; it was the first Alien picture that failed to show a profit. This is unfortunate because the narrative Ridley Scott envisaged for his new series had not yet gotten to the very thing he’d meant to “explain” about that derelict craft in the original, and I doubt at this point he’ll get another chance to do so.\n\nWhile Alien Covenant is as well thought-out as Prometheus (the script is credited to John Logan and Dante Harper, from a story by Jack Paglen Michael Green) and contains a splendid double role for Michael Fassbender, it is — at least for this viewer — severely undercut by the casting of its lead. To be as blunt as possible, Katherine Waterston, daughter of the redoubtable Sam, sports one of the least appealing faces I’ve ever seen on a leading actress. Indeed, at first I thought she was a boy, and not a pretty boy either. (Did it occur to no one involved in this movie that longer hair would at least have made her look less militantly androgynous?) Call me a sexist if you wish, but in a series that has included such remarkable physiognomies as those of Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder and Charlize Theron, is it asking too much that the leading female at least be a woman you want to look at for two hours?\n\nAlien (1979; 4K UHD) Seen on its original release as the anti-Star Wars, grimy and disturbing where George Lucas’ space epic was gleaming and optimistic, Alien was also one of the most extraordinary looking pictures of its time, and, although this is seldom noticed even by its many partisans, original in that its writer, Dan O’Bannon, eschewed providing information on the space-hopping characters, their relationships or their lives on earth. The crew of the Nostromo are, I suppose, types, in the same way such characters so often are in combat pictures, and their backgrounds are of less interest to the viewer than the lethal parameters of the crisis they face and how they deal with it. This gave the cast a great deal of latitude, and when you have actors as gifted and capable as Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Yaphet Kotto, Harry Dean Stanton, Ian Holm, John Hurt and Veronica Cartwright to fill in the gaps with personality, and a director who trusts their instincts, you can get some awfully good results.\n\nIl Conformista / The Conformist (1970) A beautiful, occasionally exhilarating, adaptation by Bernardo Bertolucci of Alberto Moravia’s novel about a sociopathic boy, his eventual and enthusiastic immersion into the Fascism of Benito Mussolini, and a mission on which his adult self is sent that complicates his beloved placidity in devastating ways. Bertolucci made a number of changes to the book, some felicitous (although his ending is not much better than Moravia’s, at least it is not as bad), others less so. Chief among these is his muddying the sexuality both of the woman with whom Marcello Clerici (Jean-Louis Trintignant) becomes fatally enamored and of Marcello himself. When as a boy he is seduced by a chauffeur in the novel, on the promise of his being given a handgun, there is no sense that Marcello is in any way homosexual, or even bisexual. For some curious reason, however, the writer-director of the movie depicts the chauffeur (Pierre Clémenti) not as a defrocked priest but a young man who, under his cap, sports a full head of long, feminine hair; when the movie’s young Marcello (Pasquale Fortunato) sees this, he responds enthusiastically. I’m not sure what is being said here, as I am also puzzled by the boy Marcello being changed in this crucial sequence from 16 to something that looks to me more like 11 or 12, or by the change of Anna (Dominique Sanda), the wife of the man Marcello is tasked with fingering for assassination, from a bitter lesbian with a yen for Marcello’s new bride Giulia (Stefania Sandrelli) to, if not a heterosexual, or even one with Sapphic tendencies, an avid potential lover for Marcello, her husband’s former student. It’s all a bit murky, made more so by the professor (Enzo Tarascio) being described (as he also is in the novel) as a hunchback when there is no suggestion of that in his physiognomy.\n\nI don’t expect any transposition of a literary novel to retain what makes the writing special, of course. Indeed, the inability of film to replicate the written word is the chiefest argument against adaptation. What I suspect, based on Bertolucci’s reticence in other movies he’s made, to deal honestly with homosexuality — turning the homosexual Pu Yi in The Last Emperor straight, for example — prevented him from depicting Anna as Moravia did, if it did not indeed encourage him to go in exactly the opposite direction. True, he retained the lesbian dance between Anna and Giulia, but he transposed it from Parisian lesbian nightclub to an open dance-hall where it first shocks and then titillates the heterosexual dancing couples. In addition, the loss of the early material in the book describing Marcello’s childhood, his curiously detached parents and the development of his violent and conforming personality, robs the viewer of at least some explication concerning his character. I very much appreciate, however, the way Bertolucci places Marcello at the scene of the professor’s horrific murder, whose brutality is made even more terrible by Anna’s presence; the moment when, shot and hysterical, she sees him in the back of a limousine and bangs on the window in agonized confusion, is shattering. But I do not begin to comprehend why the filmmaker created a blind Fascist and closet-queen (Gastone Moschin) as Marcello’s best friend or what his presence is supposed to add to the narrative aside from a rather obvious metaphor. (The way the character describes to Marcello how other men see feels like a red herring. How does he know?)\n\nI speak from a minority viewpoint here, and I know it. I am well aware that many regard The Conformist as one of the masterpieces of the 1970s, and I can even see why. Its contours, and the way Bertolucci weaves the narrative strands, moments from the past intruding on scenes in the present, is kinetic, and his eye is nearly unerring (the way he shoots autumn leaves blowing in the wind has influenced countless filmmakers in the years since, including Francis Coppola); the cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is sumptuous, particularly in his use of blue as a recurrent visual motif; and Georges Delerue contributed to the picture one of his characteristically plangent, lyrical scores. The cast is splendid as well, especially Trintignant, Sandrelli, Sanda and the marvelous Gastone Moschin as Marcello’s driver and Fascist counterpart. (Moschin was the memorable Don Fanucci in The Godfather Part II, spectacularly dispatched by Robert De Niro at the door of his apartment.) Nonetheless, the movie misses greatness, at least for me, and I am — just as you are, for yourself — the only audience whose opinion ultimately matters to me.\n\nHondo (1953) One of John Wayne’s better post-war Westerns not directed by either Howard Hawks or John Ford. Although Hondo was made in the brief flurry of Hollywood enthusiasm for the passing fad of 3D there are only a few moments in which you can tell a shot was intended to knock the 1953 audience’s socks off. (There are more such embarrassing shots in the two Three Stooges shorts made in 3D than in the entirety of Hondo.) In it, Wayne plays a character who could almost be the older edition of the character the youthful actor played in The Big Trail in 1930. Hondo Lane wasn’t raised by Indians, as Wayne’s character was in that movie, but he’s lived among them, and he understands their ways. He’s a hardened man, but essentially gentle, and decent, and you can see why the abandoned wife and mother played by Geraldine Page responds to him. He’s kinder to her, and more understanding of her, than her impatient rotter of a husband (Leo Gordon) could ever be and like Heston in Will Penny he expresses genuine, uncomplicated affection for her pleasant young son.\n\nPage, whose first important picture this was, apparently dismayed her co-stars by going so far into her role she refused to bathe (since she reasoned a frontier woman wouldn’t be able to, at least that often). That Wayne still looks like he’s head-over-heels about her in the couple’s clinches says something about his professionalism, at the very least. However she achieved her characterization, it must be said that Page is remarkable in the picture, and got an unexpected Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her work. (A line was added to the script, however, in which her character avers she knows she’s a plain woman, which can’t have been pleasant for Page to deliver although plain she certainly was, and in a time when that mattered at the movies.) Scarcely less impressive is Michael Pate as the Indian chief Vittoro, and as the boy, Lee Aaker is refreshingly free of guile. James Edward Grant based his thoughtful screenplay on a Collier’s story by Louis L’Amour and it’s everything you want from a Western script and seldom receive: Populated by interesting characters played by interesting actors, Hondo provides fulsome characterizations, good action and piquant dialogue. They really didn’t need that 3D gimmick.\n\nJohn Ford, visiting a less-than-thrilled Wayne on the set, was put to work filming second unit location shots to get him out of the star’s hair, and he did extensive work on the climactic sequence, which looks it. The rest of the picture was shot by John Farrow, whom almost no one he worked with once ever cared to do so a second time. Considering the mess he made of his family I can easily believe it. Of his seven children with Maureen O’Sullivan one was a suicide, one a child molester,* and another is Mia Farrow.\n\n*Where’s the high-profile reporting on that one, Ronan?\n\nText copyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nThelma and Louise (1991) When this simultaneously engaging and absurdly provocative road movie opened 32 years ago, Time magazine’s breathless cover story on it rushed to assure us that men and women were debating its content over water coolers all across America. I don’t know whether Time, Inc. offices still contained such things as water coolers in the last decade of the 20th century, but in the building in which I worked at that time, I never overheard a single discussion about Thelma and Louise, let alone a debate on its dubious feminism. It was an all-too-typical bit of cultural-elitist hyperbole from a magazine not known for progressivism of any kind but whose whiskers twitch with exquisite sensitivity whenever it identifies a trend… usually well after the point at which the rest of the country has already moved past it.\n\nThe new 4K UHD Criterion transfer, which emphasizes the beauty of Adrian Biddle’s rich, fine-grained cinematography, reinforces my initial response to Thelma and Louise in 1991 and my strong sense of both its strengths and its weaknesses. Everything that impressed me about it then impresses me still, and everything that bothered me when it was new bothers me now. Callie Khouri, who wrote the screenplay (and was given an Academy Award for it) later noted of the writing that, “It was such a pure experience. There was no self-censorship there, there was no second guessing. From a creative standpoint, it was the freest I had ever been in my life.” On the basis of the finished movie I would have argued in favor of a little creative self-censorship, which might have rid Khouri’s script of the things in it which seemed then, and seem now, both silly and pernicious and which rendered her movie less a character study than a half-assed neo-feminist fantasy trading on one-dimensional masculine stereotype. (Imagine the squeals of protest had all the women in a similar big-budget Hollywood movie directed by a serious filmmaker been whores, harpies and airheads while only the men were intelligent and two- if not three-dimensional. Is this how parity between the sexes is achieved? Through caricature?)\n\nWith the notable exceptions of the Arkansas police detective (Harvey Keitel) investigating Louise’s killing of a thwarted rapist and Louise’s understanding boyfriend, nicely played by Michael Madsen, all of the men in Thelma and Louise are cartoons of varying levels of ridiculousness, from the sex-hustling thief played by Brad Pitt to Thelma’s utterly ludicrous, self-pitying chauvinist husband (Christopher McDonald, whose embarrassingly over-the-top performance is a study in thespic neoteny.) Further, while Khouri complains of American movie stars who “make a fortune from violence,” her own most famous picture contains a sequence in which one of the heroines holds up a general store at gunpoint, rendered as comedy, and another in which her counterpart gleefully pumps bullets into the semi full of gasoline driven by a noxious pig who pisses the pair off — a scene designed to make audiences cheer as the pig’s tanker explodes. That’s not to mention the scene in which both women force a strutting martinet of a patrol officer, at gunpoint, into the trunk of his car, on a desert road, where he is further made the butt of a stupid joke involving a Rastafarian cyclist and a blunt. Khouri’s idiotic false equivalencies on the matter of guns (“We have a speed limit. Why can’t we have a bullet limit?”) exhibit the same level of militant illogic as her own fortune-gathering movie. Or is it simple hypocrisy?\n\nWhat’s best about the picture are Khouri’s dialogues between Thelma and Louise, which for the most part bear the shape and texture of the way friends talk together; Ridley Scott’s assured direction, even when the narrative is going awry; Thom Noble’s kinetic editing; and Susan Sarandon’s uncompromising, and unassailable, performance as Louise. Geena Davis, I suppose, does what she can with Thelma, but the part is largely impossible. She’s dumb beyond the simple needs of dramaturgy, and annoying to boot — when did any woman who’d just been raped, as Thelma is near the beginning (her assailant doesn’t get a chance to bring the act to completion but does penetrate her) suddenly go all weak at the knees for a college-age boy and pursue him to bed? — and I can never decide whether Davis is honoring that characterization or just giving in to it. I’ve also never quite believed the picture’s ending, and in any case the final image isn’t held nearly long enough to be effective. But even it is better than Hans Zimmer’s superfluous and irritating score. I know people who think John Williams is overrated, but is he anywhere near as overrated as Zimmer?\n\nThe Lady Eve (1941) Although its plot hinges on an entirely unbelievable premise, this sparkling sex-comedy is one of the writer-director Preston Sturges’ most consistently entertaining pictures. While its stars, Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck, had appeared together in a comic mystery (The Mad Miss Manton in 1938) neither was known as a comedian. Their performances here are unerringly funny, however, especially Fonda’s; the sequence in which Stanwyck holds him tight, runs her fingers through his hair and coos into his ear while he squirms in a fit of erotic agony is perhaps the funniest seduction scene ever put on film. I don’t think there is a better one, at least in American movies, and none to equal it until Anne Bancroft and Dustin Hoffman’s first hotel room scene in The Graduate. My only complaint about The Lady Eve is my usual cavil about Sturges’ best work — his unfortunate penchant for unmotivated slapstick. The seemingly innumerable times Fonda is made to trip and fall, usually with or into food and/or drink, throughout the picture are protracted, unnecessary and (at least to me) resolutely unfunny. It isn’t as though his character is a stuffed shirt, or a snob or a villain, or in any other way deserving of constantly being made a fool. Do other people actually laugh at this?\n\n1776 (1972) Any movie that can get an 11-year old interested in American history and musical theatre has something going for it, even if either of these strikes you as a negative.\n\nWhat we saw in 1972, we now understand, was a truncated edition of a longer picture that more faithfully transcribed the long-running Sherman Edwards/Peter Stone Broadway show — the director of both was Peter H. Hunt — and which was cut by its producer, Jack L. Warner, in part for time and in part because Richard Nixon objected to a single musical number in it. (Not that any of that mattered, since the movie was a flop anyway.) 1776 was re-edited for laserdisc in the late 1990s with the cut footage, un-restored and visually jarring, put back in. Later DVD and Blu-ray editions restored the entire thing and presented it in editions of varying length. The recent 4K UHD “Extended Cut” is the most satisfying version thus far, and Harry Stradling, Jr.’s glorious widescreen cinematography haven’t looked this good in 50 years.\n\nThe Servant (1963) The initial collaboration between Harold Pinter and the director Joseph Losey, from the strange, disturbing 1948 novella by Robin Maugham. It was beautifully lit by Douglas Slocombe and well acted by a cast that includes Dirk Bogarde, Sarah Miles and the young James Fox. (Wendy Craig, who Losey later correctly said was miscast, gives such an arch, cold, hostile performance you feel empathy with the serpentine manservant played by Bogarde, which works against the situation.) Although there is nothing explicitly homoerotic about either the source material or the movie made from it, a strong whiff of the sadomasochistic permeates Waugh’s narrative about a young man (Fox) hiring a servant (Bogarde) who eventually takes over his life and gradually turns him into a passive, alcoholic mess. This is especially noticeable in one scene not in the story, in which servant and master bicker like a married couple and another in which they play ball on the stairs inside the townhouse. I’m not sure how I feel about either Waugh’s story or Pinter and Losey’s movie, since both depressed me. I suppose that means they achieved their respective objectives. It seems a dubious triumph to me.\n\nThe one thing, aside from Craig’s performance, to which I absolutely objected was the recurring song by John Dankworth, sung by his wife Cleo Laine. It’s the only record Fox seems to own, and hearing those overly-pointed and awkwardly written lyrics, over and over, took me slowly from annoyance to rage. For collectors of trivia, in the restaurant scene between Fox and Craig, Patrick Magee appears as a Bishop, Alun Owen (soon to write A Hard Day’s Night) as a Curate and Pinter himself plays a socialite.\n\nThe Great Mouse Detective (1986) A minor Disney feature directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, Dave Michener and Burny Mattinson, the first two of whom would, in three years time, be responsible for the picture that changed everything for the company. Based on Eve Titus’ clever little children’s novel Basil of Baker Street (and its sequels), the movie was originally given that name before the odious Disney CEO Michael Eisner objected, leading to a hilarious satirical memo by the animator Ed Gombert retroactively re-naming the studio’s classics (The Wonderful Elephant Who Could Really Fly, The Puppet Who Wanted to Be a Real Boy…) It’s an often sumptuous-looking movie, largely respectful of the Victorian contours and well-voiced by Barrie Ingham (Basil), Val Bettin (Dr. Dawson), little Susanne Pollatschek as the kidnapped girl mouse Olivia Flaversham and Candy Candido, in radio and movies for over 50 years at the time, as the peg-legged bat Fidget. The casting coup, however, and half the reason to see the picture, is Vincent Price voicing Basil’s Moriarty, the appalling Professor Ratigan. Price was clearly in his element, and having a high old time of it, never more so than while crooning Henry Mancini, Larry Grossman & Ellen Fitzhugh’s big number “The World’s Greatest Criminal Mind.”\n\nMancini’s score is felicitous — spirited, charming and, during the action scenes, rousing. There are also some good uses of early computer animation, particularly in the climactic sequence involving the Big Ben works, but there are two miscalculations, it seems to me. One was the filmmakers’ eschewing how Titus’ mouse community evolves in the basement of 221B Baker Street, which I admit is a peripheral complaint. The other, which irks me considerably more, is Melissa Manchester’s resolutely anachronistic (and typically sloppy, lyrically) music-hall number “Let Me Be Good to You,” which she also (alas) performs in a vulgar, sexually suggestive manner much too blue for a movie aimed primarily at children. It’s as if Mae West walked into Pinocchio and suddenly started coming on to Geppetto.\n\nKing of Jazz (1930) A real curio. For those who disparage Paul Whiteman as a band-leader, this celebration of him unfortunately supports the view that he was to jazz as Lawrence Welk was to Tin Pan Alley. And for a movie with “jazz” in the title there’s almost no jazz in it.\n\nMary Poppins (1964) In an era that produced one bad movie musical after another, here was that rara avis: An original as tuneful as it was eye-pleasing.\n\nTreasure Island (1950) I’m not sure why I never read Robert Louis Stevenson’s marvelous 1883 novel when I was a child — I didn’t pick it up for the first time until late in my 5th decade — but I wish I had because I can well imagine how it would have appealed to me. Stevenson’s novel, written for his step-son, is the essential boy’s book (although young girls apparently love it too) and it’s hard to imagine the child who couldn’t get excited about it, what with its mysterious strangers, ocean voyages in search of buried treasure, talking parrot, one-legged cook, half-crazed hermit, vivid dialogue and sailing ship full of bloodthirsty pirates, not to mention a 12-year old protagonist who is curious, brave, resourceful and kind.\n\nWalt Disney’s early live-action transliteration, the first of his post-war pictures to be made in Britain, in order to take advantage of frozen funds, is a good one, covering most of the important incidents of the book and leaving out very little. It’s largely well cast, with one glaring exception, about which more anon: Basil Sydney as a robust Captain Smollett, Walter Fitzgerald properly blustery as Squire Trelawney, Denis O’Dea as sane and generous Dr. Livesey, Finlay Currie a frightening Billy Bones, John Laurie an even scarier Blind Pew, Geoffrey Keen a properly treacherous Israel Hands, Geoffrey Wilkinson an engagingly half-mad Ben Gunn and, best of all, Robert Newton as Long John Silver. It’s Newton everyone is imitating when they say, “Aarr, matey” and think they’re talking like a pirate, but if that is all there had been to his performance it would be of very minor interest. Newton, the bone-chilling Bill Sykes of the David Lean Oliver Twist and the unforgettable Inspector Fix of Around the World in 80 Days, gives an account of Silver that locates his slippery, adaptable weathercock nature, his blood-thirstiness (or at least his indifference to the deaths or sufferings of others) and his avarice but also his humor and his genuine fondness for young Jim Hawkins.\n\nLawrence Edward Watkin, who also wrote The Great Locomotive Chase and Darby O’Gill and the Little People for Disney, did the flavorful and largely faithful adaptation, the splendid cinematographer Freddie Young filmed it with an eye for supportive impact under Byron Haskin’s effective direction, and Clifton Parker composed the pleasing score. The picture has one basic flaw, and it’s a major one: The miscasting of the otherwise very good Bobby Driscoll as Jim. It isn’t Driscoll’s performance that detracts but his unfettered American accent. Disney knowingly violated British labor laws in casting Driscoll, then compounded matters by completing the boy’s scenes and sending him home while the case was under appeal. But then as now, when the company that bears his name protects a known Irish serial rapist from prosecution, no one ever pins Disney to the mat.\n\nWho is Harry Kellerman and why is he saying those terrible things about me? (1971) This comic shaggy-dog story by Herb Gardner is very much a playwright’s movie, especially this playwright; Georgie Soloway, the singer-songwriter played by Dustin Hoffman, is a stage conception, and his monologues (indeed, much of the picture’s dialogue) seem conceived for the Broadway theatre of the time. Like Murray Burns in Gardner’s A Thousand Clowns, Georgie is as maddeningly idiosyncratic as he is charming, articulate and funny. And as with Martin Balsam as Murray’s agent-brother Arnold in the movie of Clowns, Gardner gave Barbara Harris, as a neurotic actress auditioning for Georgie’s Broadway musical, an extended monologue that resulted in an Academy Award nomination. (Unlike Balsam, Harris lost.) I don’t mean to imply by this that Who is Harry Kellerman… is stagey. It’s very much a movie, with fantastic things happening in jump-cut and juxtaposition, and realistic settings that suddenly seem surreal based on what is going on in them. (The excellent Ulu Grosbard directed, but such moments were scripted.) Still, Gardner was primarily a playwright, and his screenplay was written with a playwright’s sense of the shape and texture of effective stage dialogue, which doesn’t always sound natural coming out the mouths of movie characters. I have been platonically in love with Barbara Harris since the age of 16, when I first heard her on the Broadway cast recording of the Bock and Harnick The Apple Tree, and have long wondered what she did in Harry Kellerman to get an Oscar nomination. Now I know: Like Balsam in A Thousand Clowns she makes a Herb Gardner character who’s really more concept than human being into a living person. I cannot fathom why Harris had so little confidence in herself as an actress. She hated performing, and she was brilliant at it.\n\nIt’s a strange little movie, and not ultimately successful as either a dramatic comedy or a satire. Yet I enjoyed a great deal of it, and much of the picture is hilarious, even though I knew who Harry Kellerman was from the first 20 minutes. As a phenomenally successful singer-songwriter — when we look at him we’re supposed to think of Dylan — watching his private life veer out of control and contemplating suicide, Hoffman is terrific, and the supporting cast is marvelous, especially Dom DeLuise, wonderful as Hoffman’s accountant; Gabriel Dell as his songwriting partner; David Burns as his father; and Rose Gregorio as his ex-wife. As Georgie’s shrink, Jack Warden is very funny and there is a moment with him that I feel sure inspired Dennis Potter’s writing “Pennies from Heaven.” There’s also a beautiful sequence of Hoffman in a private plane featuring aerial views of Manhattan I have never seen in a movie before; you really see that it is an island, which people outside the city tend to forget.\n\n100 Rifles (1969) An entertaining late-period Western adapted by Clair Huffaker from a Robert MacLeod novel, revised by Tom Gries and directed by him. Gries, who two years earlier also wrote and directed the beautiful Will Penny. It’s outlandish, and scarcely believable for a moment, but it’s got its own weird integrity; for a movie that doesn’t really make sense, the action in it has unassailable logic. Jim Brown plays an American marshal improbably sent to Mexico to retrieve the half-Indian/half-Mexican bandit “Yaqui Joe” Herrera (Burt Reynolds) who reluctantly gets himself involved with a band of native revolutionaries led by (wait for it!) Raquel Welch. Reynolds: “I was playing Yaqui Joe, supposedly an Indian with a mustache. Raquel had a Spanish accent that sounded like a cross between Carmen Miranda and ZaSu Pitts.” Whatever you think of her accent, Welch is much better than you might expect, while Reynolds exudes that unique amiability and wit that was his popular specialty and which (along with the appositely stupid action movies he starred in) made him, for a time, the biggest box-office draw in the world. There is one odd scene in 100 Rifles, however, in which he’s seen from the side in extreme close-up; whenever he turns his head to speak to the actor next to him I could swear I saw the join of his toupée. Was he that bald already in 1969?\n\nFernando Lamas is the hissibly nasty villain who comes to an appropriately grisly end, Dan O’Herlihy is amicable as an opportunistically inconstant American official, and Eric Braeden (credited under his real name, Hans Gudegast) is equally self-serving as Lamas’ German advisor. The young Lorenzo Lamas can also be spotted, as an Indian boy, but the role played by Akim Tamiroff, alas, was cut when his scenes were deleted. Gries’ direction is swift and well-staged, with occasional moments of real surprise. Cecilio Paniagua’s color cinematography is mouth-watering and the propulsive score by Jerry Goldsmith ranks as one of his best for a Western, and one of his most enjoyable in any genre.\n\nInteriors (1978) When Woody Allen chose to follow up the delightful (and extremely successful) Annie Hall with this utterly humorless homage to Ingmar Bergman, there were those who wondered if it was intended as some sort of sly satire of Swedish nihilism. As a 17 year-old Allen fan, I hated it. I no longer hate it, but it does represent the danger to the creative artist of immersion in other people’s movies. Interiors plays like what it is: The deliberate imposition onto one filmmaker’s style and sensibilities of someone else’s. Although the movie is intelligent and, occasionally, felt (the scene between E.G. Marshall and Geraldine Page in the cathedral is genuinely shocking) it doesn’t feel in any way organic. It’s a set of chic Scandinavian attitudes gleaned from too many screenings of Bergman and grafted onto the world-view of a wisecracking Brooklyn-born college dropout trying too hard to make others believe he’s an intellectual. (He isn’t, and never was.) In one of the books about him, Allen cites James Thurber drunkenly pounding a table at a party and slurring that he is “nothing but a God-damned humorist!” To Allen, who loves the Marx Brothers and Bob Hope’s screen persona so much he imitated it for years, comedy (in his words, not mine) is “sitting at the children’s table.” He seems to think that empty verbal imposture and pictorial prettiness equates to being seated with the adults. But would those “adults” be anyone you wouldn’t jaywalk across a busy street at rush-hour to avoid?\n\nAlthough the main figures in the picture are embodiments of attitudes rather than living characters, some of the images (like the shot of Diane Keaton, Mary Beth Hurt and Kristin Griffith staring out the window at the end) are steals from both Bergman and Chekhov and the dialogue is often risible, I have to admit that, as filmmaking, Interiors is exceptionally handsome and effective — the photography was by Gordon Willis and the editor was Ralph Rosenblum, who shaped Annie Hall from a formless mess into the most plangent romantic comedy of the era — and it is often wonderfully acted, especially by Page as the emotionally fragile interior-designer mater familias and Marshall as her equally emotionally distant husband, who finally endures enough of her mercurial behavior and seeks a new life without her. The rest of the cast, which includes Richard Jordan as Keaton’s failed novelist husband, Sam Waterston as Hurt’s frustrated documentarian mate and Maureen Stapleton as Marshall’s new bride, flails about in search of something human to play. Jordan has the movie’s ugliest moment, when he attempts to rape Griffith in the family garage, while Stapleton tries to pump air into a figure who is nothing but a symbol. Yet even they are not as lost as Hurt and Keaton, gifted actresses reduced to attitudinizing. Hurt comes off the worst; her character is so impossible you can’t imagine how anyone could put up with her. Although it is possible to regard her as the pathetic result of how parents can emotionally retard their middle child, she’s so filled with rage and so impervious to anything approaching pleasure or personal achievement she’s a braying, angry bore. And Keaton, who almost seems to be playing an early edition of the pretentious dilettante role she assayed in Manhattan a year later, is saddled with the picture’s biggest howler: “I can’t seem to shake the real implication of dying,” she says to her psychiatrist. “It’s terrifying. The intimacy of it embarrasses me.”\n\nThat is, hands down, the best bad line heard in a movie since in The Ten Commandments Anne Baxter as Nefretiri was made to say to Charlton Heston, “Oh, Moses, Moses! You stubborn, splendid, adorable fool!”\n\nA Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy (1982) Notable, if that’s the word, as the first of his movies to star Mia Farrow, this lighthearted romantic roundelay written and directed by Woody Allen is also, like Interiors, an homage to Ingmar Bergman. This time, instead of the Persona Bergman, Allen emulates the Ingmar of Smiles of a Summer Night (with bits of Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya thrown in) as mismatched couples arrive for a weekend at a turn-of-the-century country home and leave or stay, their various love-lives sorted out by a magical intervention. You don’t believe Allen believes a minute of it, but it’s easy on the eyes (Gordon Willis again), charmingly scored to Mendelsohn’s music and amusingly acted by its game cast. This includes, aside from Allen as an impractical inventor haunted by a foiled romance with Farrow (would that it had remained so…), Mary Steenburgen as Allen’s unhappy spouse (well, I mean, really!), José Ferrer as a pompous academic, Julie Hagerty as a sexually accommodating secretary and Tony Roberts as a dissatisfied rake. The picture is inoffensive and often funny, but so inconsequential it blows away from your memory like dandelion seeds 20 minutes after you’ve finished watching it.\n\nText copyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nBabes in Toyland (1961) Walt Disney’s first live-action musical is a candy-coated bomb containing some pleasant old Victor Herbert tunes kitted out with new Mel Leven lyrics to replace some of the more dated, fustian originals by Glen MacDonald (the best of them is the comic tango “Castle in Spain,” an amusing turn for Ray Bolger, camping it up as the mustache-twirling villain), a few nice visual touches, Henry Calvin and Gene Sheldon performing homages to Laurel and Hardy, Annette Funicello as Mary Contrary, Tommy Sands doing a drag bit as a gypsy fortune-teller, Tommy Kirk as a hapless inventor and Ed Wynn as a surprisingly cranky and hypocritical Toymaker. The rest of it is over-fed, cloying operetta-fantasy that must have seemed, even in the year of my birth, at least 50 years out of date; I can’t imagine what today’s children would make of it. The best items are the funny little animated curlicues devised by Ward Kimball, who was also responsible for the marching wooden soldiers. (Co-author with Joe Rinaldi and Lowell S. Hawley of the screenplay, Kimball was the original producer until he ruffled Walt’s feathers and was replaced.) Jack Donohue directed, with numbing literal-mindedness. The wrong-headedness of the thing is exemplified by George Bruns and Jud Conlon speeding up the haunting ballad “Toyland” and turning it into a march.\n\nThe Celluloid Closet (1995) The partly-successful documentary based on Vito Russo’s groundbreaking book has much to recommend it but is missing its author’s essential voice, and his anger.\n\nThe Devil’s Brother, aka Fra Diavolo (1933) Whenever Laurel and Hardy are on the screen, this adaptation by Jeanie Macpherson of the 1830 Daniel Auber/Eugène Scribe opéra-comique is wonderful. Unfortunately there’s a plot, and songs, that have nothing to do with them. But coming as it did before strict enforcement of the Production Code began, The Devil’s Brother is sexually frank in a way movies ceased to be after January 1935: It’s perfectly obvious that the rich women who are his unwitting victims are having it off with Dennis King’s murderous jewel thief Fra Diavolo, or (as with Thelma Todd) are about to. The direction by Hal Roach and Charles Rogers is pleasant, as is the cinematography by Hap Depew and Art Lloyd, and the sequence in which Stan is supposed to be filling tankards with wine but gets nearly as much down his own throat as he does the vessels Ollie hands him, growing more and more inebriated, is a classic of its kind, as is his enactment of the game “Kneesey-Earsie-Nosey.” Todd is both luscious and amusing, and L & H’s perennial foil, James Finlayson, appears to good (if too brief) effect as her jealous husband. If you care about such things, Roach directed the musical sequences and Rogers the “book” scenes.\n\nCapricorn One (1977) When I was 16, this crowd-pleasing paranoia thriller written and directed by Peter Hyams about a faked NASA Mars landing satisfied my post-Watergate cynicism about my government and my concomitant delight in seeing dogged investigative reporters (remember them?) portrayed on the screen. Hyams, a sort of poor-man’s Alan J. Pakula, keeps his story moving fast as three astronauts (James Brolin, Sam Waterston and O. J. Simpson back when he was remembered more for his prowess on the football field than for If I Did It) are blackmailed into participating in a massive hoax, escape and are pursued across the desert by a pair of creepily anonymous high-tech black helicopters. Meanwhile, a wobbly reporter (Elliott Gould), tipped off by a NASA employee (Robert Walden) who then mysteriously disappears, latches onto the story and begins piecing it together.\n\nWatching Capricorn One for the first time since it was released I was as pleasantly surprised by how much of it still works as I was annoyed by the things in it, such as Telly Savalas’ profane crop-duster, that seem a sop to then-fashionable audience expectations of low-comedy relief, and the Waterston character’s irritating joke-monologue as he climbs a mesa (why?) What’s most enjoyable about it are Jerry Goldsmith’s superb action score with its propulsive earworm of a main theme; Gould’s performance as the reporter; David Doyle as his cheerfully nasty editor; Hal Holbrook as the duplicitous NASA official heading the operation; and the rich supporting performances of Brenda Vaccaro, Karen Black, David Huddleston, Barbara Bosson and James Karen. Bill Butler provided the occasionally rapturous cinematography and James Mitchell the effective editing. The action set-pieces are generally well-directed by Hyams and there is a moment during the obligatory Hey-wait-my-brakes-are-gone! sequence with Gould where his car sails off a bascule bridge that is, if you have a phobia about these things, absolutely terrifying.\n\nI am, of course, being slightly facetious when I imply there are no more serious investigative journalists in America. There are plenty. But none of them — not one — works for the corporate press (newspaper or magazine) nor for any of the broadcast radio, television or cable networks, staffed as they are almost exclusively by CIA assets or former security-state officials and employees. The names Lee Fang, Aaron Maté, Max Blumenthal, Whitney Webb, Glenn Greenwald, Matt Taibbi, Anya Parampil, Michael Tracey, Johnny Vedmore, Emma-Jo Morris, Michael Shellenberger and Kit Klarenberg are likely unknown to you, unless you make an effort to seek out their reporting or happen to catch a Congressional hearing in which they are as likely as not to be insulted, demeaned, slandered and even threatened by censorship-loving Democrats like that corrupt carpetbagger Stacey Plaskett or her colleague, the equally sleazy and anti-democratic Debbie Wasserman Schultz. But with our permanent government writing the stories it feeds to its lackeys in the corporate media and dictating to social websites what speech it will permit Americans to utter and which beliefs we are now allowed to hold, a free press, essential to a free people, is largely dead in the Land of the Free.\n\nThe Jerk (1979) I wish Steve Martin’s screen debut had been a better, funnier, movie. Taking off from Martin’s old “I was born a poor black child” stand-up routine the screenplay by him, Carl Gottlieb and Michael Elias posits his character as less a jerk than a congenital idiot, but I suppose The Moron wouldn’t have played as well on theater marquees. The picture, directed by the redoubtable Carl Reiner, is almost militantly unfunny; the laughs are so intermittent they could scarcely pad out a 30-minute television episode let alone a full-length movie. When something in the picture is amusing, it tends to elicit a smile rather than an actual laugh, as when Martin sings a dopey song in the bathtub or when he leaves Bernadette Peters near the end, a sequence largely ad-libbed by him. The only genuinely hilarious bits in The Jerk are M. Emmet Walsh’s turn as an incompetent sniper and the verbal payoff to Martin kicking Gottlieb in the testicles. (The screenwriter says even he didn’t know about the punch-line until he saw the rough-cut.) But it’s a measure of the movie’s failure that Bill Macy, Dick O’Neill, Maurice Evans, Jackie Mason and Reiner himself don’t have a funny line or bit between them.\n\nPeters is charming as Martin’s love interest but it’s hard to believe her as a woman nearly as stupid as he is. The nicest scene in the picture, when they sing “You Belong to Me” together on the beach as he strums a ukulele, is undercut when, at its climax, she’s made to produce and play a trumpet in imitation of a Louis Armstrong riff. That should give you an idea of how incompetent and annoying The Jerk really is: Its makers couldn’t even trust a moment as sweet as that impromptu duet without trying to wring a dumb joke out of it.\n\nThe Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 (1974) One of the most entertaining thrillers of its era; like Rio Bravo, it’s a movie I have over the decades seen repeatedly, and with undiminished pleasure. The picture follows the narrative of John Godey’s 1973 bestseller but Peter Stone’s sharp, often funny screenplay changes and improves on it. It’s also one of the best-cast movies of the 1970s, from Walter Matthau’s Transit Authority lieutenant faced with a highjacked subway train held for ransom and Robert Shaw as the chillingly methodical leader of the group of crooks to Doris Roberts as the Mayor’s deadpan wife and Tom Pedi as the hot-headed Transit manager Caz Dolowicz, a name that lives on in glory among us Pelham aficionados. It’s a quintessential New-York-in-the-’70s movie, and nearly everybody in it is pissed off at the world; the bad humor of its many characters adds to the picture’s flavor, and its wit. Its director, Joseph Sargent, handles the pace, the suspense and the look of the movie admirably, the editing by Gerald B. Greenberg and Robert Q. Lovett couldn’t be more apt, and Owen Roizman’s rich cinematography looks especially good in the recent 4K UHD transfer. David Shire’s brief, 12-tone-inspired score is terse and infectious — it’s one of the things about the picture you remember most, along with Matthau’s hangdog look and Martin Balsam’s head-cold.\n\nAmong the terrific actors in the supporting cast are Earl Hindman as a relatively mild-mannered highjacker; Héctor Elizondo as his polar opposite, a frighteningly mercurial, psychopathic killer; James Broderick as the train motorman; Dick O’Neill as a sour, belligerent Transit Authority controller; Lee Wallace, everyone favorite Ed Koch stand-in, as the Mayor (although Wallace’s presence predates Koch’s in Gracie Mansion by four years); Tony Roberts as the disgusted deputy mayor; Jerry Stiller as Matthau’s coeval; Kenneth McMillan as a Borough commander; and Julius Harris as the Deputy chief inspector, recipient of a priceless greeting by Matthau. The train’s passengers are well-delineated and believable except for Anna Berger as the mother of two obnoxious boys; she so overdoes every emotion you begin to long for the gunmen to summarily dispose of her. Berger is one of the very few aspects of the picture that let it down.\n\nPlanet of the Apes (1968) There are some fantasy notions so good they seem blazingly original and at the same time so creatively logical you almost can’t believe no one thought of them before their authors set them down. Pierre Boulle’s Monkey Planet was one of them, a tongue-in-cheek science-fiction novel that turned on the ultimate cosmic joke: A sphere in which apes evolved from human beings, who are in turn ruled by their evolutionary superiors. (The book is more satirical than the eventual movie: Its narrative is in the form of a missive left in space, an interstellar message-in-a-bottle picked up by a skeptical married couple who, at the end, are revealed as chimpanzees.) The movie, imaginatively directed by Franklin J. Schaffner from an intelligent screenplay credited to Michael Wilson and Rod Serling, was an enormous success for its producer Arthur P. Jacobs in 1968, eventually siring four sequels of varying quality, and several remakes in the modern era. All that from a little French speculative novel published 60 years ago.\n\nCharlton Heston has one of his best roles as the cynical American astronaut Taylor, delighted to be leaving Earth and his fellow humans, whom he despises. The bitter joke at the core of the movie is that he more than gets his wish. He’s well-matched by his co-stars, especially Kim Hunter as the curious, compassionate scientist Zira, Roddy McDowall as her cautious fiancé Cornelius and James Whitmore as the President of the Assembly who makes Taylor defend himself in a rather too pointed spoof of the Scopes trial. (That “See-No-Evil, Hear-No-Evil, Speak-No-Evil” imagery should have been reconsidered by everyone concerned because it makes the movie momentarily something it otherwise never is: Silly.) Leon Shamroy’s fine-grained images are splendid, and the simian prosthetics created by John Chambers are still remarkable 55 years on. Jerry Goldsmith’s score is one of his most original and inventive, particularly in the big action set-pieces, such as Taylor’s capture and his later (momentary) escape.\n\nSide-note: I can no longer contemplate Maurice Evans’s orangutan authoritarian Dr. Zaius without also thinking of the chorus in the hilarious Andrew Lloyd Webber parody Planet of the Apes musical featured in an early episode of “The Simpsons.” Even his name seems funny to me now.\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) Arthur P. Jacobs’ first sequel to Planet of the Apes suffers from a sense of being rushed — not in its production but in the more perfunctory aspects of its story: The astronaut played by James Franciscus barely meets Cornelius and Zira before they give each other a few scraps of exposition and abruptly part. The chimpanzees are hardly in the movie; neither, at his own request, is Charlton Heston, although Maurice Evans returns as Dr. Zaius, as do Kim Hunter as Zira and Linda Harrison as Nova, her role even more thankless than in the original. Due to the poet-screenwriter Paul Dehn’s particularly weird sense of drama, Franciscus and Heston are confronted with intelligent human mutants who communicate, threaten and destroy telepathically, worship an unexploded cobalt bomb and wear humanoid masks over their ruined faces. (Dehn wrote the story with Mort Abrahams.) If the picture has any distinction, it’s in this aspect, and the art direction (by William Creber and Jack Martin Smith) and set decoration (by Walter M. Scott and Sven Wickman) of the underground remnants of New York. Ted Post’s direction is functional, but the visual effects are almost stunningly bad. The mutants are a clutch of splendid character actors including Victor Buono, Jeff Corey, Thomas Gomez, Don Pedro Colley, Natalie Trundy and Gregory Sierra, and James Gregory memorably portrays a militant gorilla general. The best thing about Leonard Rosenman’s futuristic score is the witty inversion he composed for the mutant bomb-worshippers of “All Things Bright and Beautiful.”\n\nText copyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted text for a fuller review.\n\nThe 39 Steps (1935) Alfred Hitchcock’s most enjoyable British picture, the quintessential wrong-man/serio-comic thriller prior to its virtual remake as North by Northwest.\n\nThe Three Lives of Thomasina (1963) A pleasant fable from Disney out of Paul Gallico — or do I mean the reverse? — that for some reason backdates a then-modern (1957) story to 1912 but is otherwise remarkably faithful to its source, which may or may not be a good thing depending on how easily you are able to digest the peddling of belief in sky gods or the unhealthy psyc"
