        "text": "Does it feel like the time to leave the big city? If so, taking the train from Barcelona to Gerona is a great way to explore one of Catalonia's most beautiful destinations. Gerona is only 160 miles away from the Catalan capital, and Renfe's express trains cover the distance in 38 minutes. This means that Gerona is well within reach, whether you wake up and fancy a change, or want to plan a weekend getaway.\n\nThe Barcelona to Gerona route is covered by Renfe Avant services, which deal with medium-length journeys and offer rapid connections all day long. On board, travellers can relax, get some work done, or just watch the countryside fly by, and be in the centre of Gerona in no time. It's easily the best way to travel, and much quicker than bus journeys.\n\nFrom the 11th century cathedral and the Arabic baths to the monastery of Sant Pere de Galligants and the Sant Domènec Convent, Gerona offers a mix of Romanesque, Gothic, and modern delights, often just minutes away from the station. Follow the walls, join guided tours, and tuck into deep-fried xuixo pastries. If we've got your tastebuds tickled, read on for tickets, departures and FAQs for your trip from Barcelona to Gerona."
