        "text": "There are memorable trips to be made in France. Some are in \"la France profonde\" (deep France), others in the country's farthest reaches. Under a radiant sun, let's head for French and Spanish Catalonia, on an epic road trip from Barcelona to Perpignan!\n\nIn this article, I take you to a region we have not explored much on the French Moments blog. This is the border between Spain and France, specifically the Roussillon and the Côte Vermeille. I am pleased to introduce you to this beautiful country and its breathtaking coastal landscapes.\n\nBarcelona to Perpignan: A Road Trip\n\nThe most direct route from Barcelona to Perpignan (192 km/119 mi) is via the motorway over the Perthus Pass via Girona and Figueres. The journey takes just over 2 hours in regular traffic.\n\nHowever, the motorway runs away from the coast and does not directly serve the seaside resorts. Above all, it is not the most scenic route to follow. That's why I suggest you leave it at Figueres to reach the port town of Roses.\n\nLet's focus on a 'Roses to Elne' itinerary\n\nTo avoid overwhelming you with information (and publishing a long, very long article), I will limit the tourist details of this road trip from Barcelona to Perpignan to one particular stretch: the Costa Brava and the Vermeille coast, from Roses in Spain to Elne in France.\n\nThe itinerary described below will successively take the GI-614, GI-613, GI-612 and N-260 (Spain), D914 and D114 (France) roads.\n\nThe main towns and villages crossed by the route are :\n\nIn Spain :\n\nRoses\n\nCadaqués\n\nEl Port de la Selva\n\nLlançà\n\nColera\n\nPortbou\n\nIn France :\n\nCerbère\n\nBanyuls-sur-Mer\n\nPort-Vendres\n\nCollioure\n\nArgelès\n\nElne\n\nClick here to view the Barcelona to Perpignan road trip on Google Map.\n\nRenting a car in Barcelona\n\nTo start this road trip, you will need a car. If you are leaving the airport or train station, I recommend the DiscoverCars website, which will allow you to compare car rental offers from Barcelona.\n\nWhere to stay in Barcelona\n\nClick here to get a list of accommodations in Barcelona or simply browse the map below:\n\nWhat to do and see in Barcelona\n\nBelow you will find many activities to help you explore the fascinating city of Barcelona:\n\nBarcelona to Perpignan: The Stages\n\nWhen you first discover the region from Barcelona to Perpignan, you may be confused by the names of the different geographical territories. Where does the Costa Brava begin? Where does the Côte Vermeille end? What is the Alt Empordà? What about Roussillon? Here are some explanations to help you better understand the region from Barcelona to Perpignan!\n\nThe Costa Brava\n\nThe Costa Brava is the name given to the Catalan coast on the Mediterranean Sea, located in the northeast of Catalonia, in the province of Girona. It starts in Blanes, at the mouth of the river Tordera, and stretches for 160 kilometres (255 kilometres along the jagged coastline) to the French border at Portbou.\n\nThe Costa Brava includes the regions of Alt Empordà and Baix Empordà, Gironès, Pla de l'Estany and La Selva.\n\nFrom the French border, the Costa Brava gives way to the Vermeille coast, which is its geomorphological continuation (i.e. the formation of the relief).\n\nThe Alt Empordà\n\nThe Alt Empordà is a comarca (county) in the province of Girona in Catalonia that includes the Gulf of Roses, Cap de Creus and the coastline to the French border at Portbou.\n\nThe Côte Vermeille\n\nThe Vermeille coast is a beautiful area of the French Mediterranean coast between Argelès and the Spanish border. It is where the Pyrenees meet the Mediterranean. This coastal area has spectacular scenery: steep cliffs, hillside vineyards, secluded coves, sandy beaches and crystal clear waters.\n\nThe Côte Vermeille is also known for its picturesque towns, such as Banyuls-sur-Mer, Port-Vendres and Collioure, with colourful houses, bustling fishing ports and charming narrow streets. Visitors can enjoy many activities in the area, such as swimming, scuba diving, hiking along the coastal paths, or tasting the local wines produced in the region's vineyards.\n\nThis part of the Roussillon coastline was named the \"Côte Vermeille\" in the 19th century when the first or last rays of sunlight colour the rock a rosy red hue.\n\nThe Albera Massif\n\nThe Albera Massif (in Catalan: Serra de l'Albera, in French: massif des Albères) is the mountain range that forms the easternmost part of the Pyrenean chain.\n\nThe Albera massif is bounded on the west by the Perthus pass and the river Rome, which separate it from the Salines massif, and on the east by the Mediterranean Sea between Argelès-sur-Mer in France and Port-Bou and Llançà in Spain.\n\nThe Albera dominate the lower valley of the Tech and the Roussillon Plain to the north and the Empordà Plain to the south. In the south, the massif of Cap de Creus is sometimes considered part of the Albera.\n\nThe massif reaches an altitude of 1,256 metres at Puig Neulós.
