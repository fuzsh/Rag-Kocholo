But, if youâ€™re in the city of Barcelona, cars arenâ€™t only not needed, they can also be an inconvenience.\n\nAs an American, Iâ€™ve been driving since I received my driverâ€™s license at 16. As an expat whoâ€™s lived in Barcelona for several years, I donâ€™t miss expensive parking garages or the hassle of finding a parking spot.\n\nBarcelona and Catalonia region have an extensive public transportation network. Buses, metros, and rideshare bicycles make it quick and easy to get from point A to point B. Regional trains connect Barcelona to other cities in Catalonia, while long-distance trains open up access to wider Spain.\n\nExploring Barcelona by train is one of the best ways to get around.

Tarragona\n\nTarragona is a charming coastal city only 80 kilometers from Barcelona. A great option for history enthusiasts, Tarragona has an impressive collection of Roman ruins, earning a designation of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nThe view of some of the ruins overlooking the Mediterranean Sea is one of my favorite spots in town. Visitors flock to see the ancient Roman amphitheater that once hosted gladiator contests.\n\nThe city is sprinkled with medieval buildings and cathedrals. Tarragonaâ€™s quaint old town is filled with narrow streets, shops, and buzzing cafes.\n\nAn afternoon can easily be spent exploring this picturesque maze. We always leave a little time to hang out on a patio and sip sangria.\n\nFor beach lovers, Playa del Miracle and Playa de lâ€™Arrabassada are popular spots to relax, swim, and enjoy the beautiful coast. The Balcony of the Mediterranean is a stunning overlook providing incredible views of the sea, port, beach, and the Roman amphitheater.\n\nTarragona is a great beach trip in August but Iâ€™ve also visited in October and had no complaints!\n\nIf you have time, you can also plan a trip to Port Aventura World, the most visited amusement park in Spain. The park is located in Tarragon and is a popular destination for families.\n\nHow to get from Barcelona to Tarragona\n\nTake the Renfe train from Barcelona Sants to Tarragona.

Figueres\n\nFigueres is a town located in the northeastern part of Catalonia and is the birthplace of renowned surrealist artist Salvador Dali. Youâ€™ll find plenty of statues and street art throughout the city paying homage to the mastermind artist.\n\nFigueres is now home to the world famous Dali Museum. This is more than just a museum recognizing Dali, the compound is a surreal masterpiece itself. Enjoy a walking tour of the city, museum, and Daliâ€™s works.\n\nTake a break from Gaudi and enjoy the expansive collection of Daliâ€™s works. The museum is great at providing visitors with an immersive experience into the artistâ€™s creative mind.\n\nOutside of Dali, the city has plenty of historical architecture to enjoy. The Sant Ferran Castle is a former military fortress is one of my favorites.\n\nMeanwhile, the city center is perfect local shopping and delicious restaurants offering traditional Catalan dishes. Figueres was one of the first day trips I took from Barcelona and happened to be where I tried a lot of famous Catalan dishes for the first time.\n\nHow to get from Barcelona to Figueres\n\nFigueres can be reached by train, bus, or rental car. A direct high-speed train will take about 55 minutes from Barcelona Sants to Figueres-Vilafrant.

Girona\n\nFor medieval architectural enthusiasts or simply Game of Thrones fans, Girona is a must do day trip from Barcelona.\n\nKnown for its picturesque river and vibrant cultural scene, Girona has plenty of events throughout the year.

Take in the scenery by admiring the colorful houses that decorate the riverbank and marvel at the Eiffel Bridge.\n\nA visit to the Gardens of the Francesc Macia Monument offers additional tranquility.\n\nHow to get from Barcelona to Girona\n\nTake the high speed train from Barcelona Sants and be to Girona in 40 minutes!\n\nBest Girona Day Tour\n\nGame of Thrones fans: book an out of this world tour here â–º\n\n4. Sitges\n\nThis might be my pick for the best day trip from Barcelona. Itâ€™s simple and I tend to do it frequently â€“ Iâ€™ve gone solo and with friends.\n\nSitges is a bright coastal town just 40 mins from Barcelona and is one of the easiest and most popular day trips on the train. Sitges is not only beautiful, it also has plenty to offer in the arts and cultural front.\n\nFree Barcelona Packing List: What You Donâ€™t Want to Forget!\n\nWe respect your privacy. Unsubscribe at anytime.\n\nYouâ€™ll find art studios and exhibits, plus incredible restaurant offerings.

Lovely and quaint are two words I might use to describe this little town.\n\nStop by Museu Cau Ferrat, the former home of artist Santiago Rusinol, which is now a museum housing a wide array of art and artifacts. You can also make a stop at Maricel Palace, another impressive collection of art across multiple periods.\n\nLastly, make use of the coastline and enjoy an afternoon on the beach. The beaches are often less crowded than those in Barcelona and offer a nice reprieve. Enjoy a hot September day by cooling off in Sitges!\n\nIâ€™ve spent days in Sitges hiking, hanging out at the beach, and just strolling around town. You can make this a half day trip from Barcelona for a full day trip. There are some great cooking classes here!\n\nHow to get from Barcelona to Sitges\n\nTake the R2 Sud line from Sants of Passeig de Gracia. Trains run often and take about 40 minutes.\n\nBest Sitges Day Tour\n\nPlan a sightseeing tour with a local from Barcelona to Sitges for the day â–º\n\n5. Valencia\n\nValencia is probably better suited as a weekend trip from Barcelona but it is still one of the best trips from Barcelona by train. A visit to the 3rd largest city in Spain will be full of history, nightlife, and delicious food. Take a break from tapas here! The birthplace of Paella, Valencia blends the best of Catalan and Spanish cuisine.\n\nA full day can easily be spent at the City of Arts and Sciences, perhaps one of the most well known modern symbols of Valencia.\n\nIt's shockingly enormous.

Known for its unique rock formation, Montserrat is quite different from other mountains in Spain.\n\nThis is the perfect day trip for nature enthusiasts as it has loads of trails ranging in difficulty. Sant Joan Funicular leads you to the top of the mountain while providing breathtaking views of the encompassing valleys. Itâ€™s one of the most peaceful escapes iâ€™ve had outside of the city.\n\nMontserrat is home to the Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey, a historical monastery on the mountainside.\n\nInside the basilica youâ€™ll find Black Madonna, a famous statue of the Virgin Mary that draws thousands of pilgrims each year. Several restaurant offerings are available in Montserrat to refuel on your adventures.\n\nPro tip: stop by a local shop for regional offerings of cheese and honey.\n\nHow to get from Barcelona to Montserrat\n\nBarcelona to Montserrat train is two stops: the R5 line to Aeri de Montserrat, then the cable car up the mountian. Itâ€™s totally possible to do this on your own, but there are plenty of local tour operators who will guide you there as well.\n\nA cool option is taking the cogwheel train up to the cable car rather than the R5 line.\n\nBest Montserrat Day Tour\n\nView pricing and availability to take the cogwheel train up to Montserrat â–º\n\n7. Cadaques\n\nNow onto one of my favorites: a Costa Brava day trip from Barcelona - perfect for hot summer days when you want to be closer to the coastline!\n\nCadaques is a stunning beachside town located in the Costa Brava region of Catalonia. Costa Brava makes up the northeastern part of the region. It also holds some of the most beautiful beaches in Spain so be sure to pack your beach gear.\n\nThe moment you step foot into Cadaques youâ€™ll immediately be enamored by its beauty...and feel like you've transported yourself to Greece!\n\nThe town is full of whitewashed buildings adorned with colorful flowers. You'll want to make the trek up to the Church of Santa Maria, an elevated landmark with a panoramic view of Cadaques.\n\nFrom there, itâ€™s an easy walk to the Dali House Museum, the former residence of surrealist artist Salvador Dali. The museum provides insight into his life and showcases a collection of his works. I spent about an hour in the museum and that seemed to be enough.\n\nPlatja de Portlligat is a small beach situated near the house that provided inspiration that led to many of Daliâ€™s paintings. Cadaques is still a haven to plenty of artists today and youâ€™ll find art galleries and unique works of art in the local shops.\n\nCap de Creus National Park is situated near Cadaques and holds plenty of welcoming trails to visitors.\n\nFar de Cala Nans Lighthouse is a short drive from the city offering incredible views on the rugged and dramatic coastline. The views were truly spectacular and I wish I could have stayed longer.\n\nUnfortunately, I didnâ€™t get a chance to enjoy the restaurant at the lighthouse due to strong winds, but I still hit plenty of the top things to do in Cadaques.\n\nBut, if you manage to visit on a calm day, itâ€™s an experience youâ€™ll never forget! Book a table on their website if you want to eat here; it can get crowded. Whether you want to dine or not, itâ€™s worth making the trek for the views (and a photo op of course).\n\nHow to get from Barcelona to Cadaques by Train\n\nThere are no trains directly into Cadaques. There are direct buses from Barcelona to Cadaques. I went with locals, so driving wasnâ€™t difficult. Renting a car is a great option, but if I hadnâ€™t been with my local friends, I definitely would have taken a tour.\n\nAlternatively, take a train from Barcelona to Figueres and then a 45 minute cab or 1 hour bus.\n\nWhile this is a great day trip, I personally did a weekend trip from Barcelona to Cadaques and it was the perfect amount of time!\n\nBest Cadaques Day Tour\n\nHit all of Dali's hot spots and the national park with this awesome Cadaques tour â–º\n\n8.

Located in the Garrotxa region of Catalonia, Besalu is filled with well-preserved medieval architecture.\n\nPerhaps one the most prominent landmarks is the Pont de Besalu, a Romanesque Bridge dating back to the 12th century. You don't want to miss a stroll up the hill to Besalu Castle for panoramic views of the landscape.\n\nWhile mostly in ruins, the castle provides a glimpse into a rich past.\n\nA trip to the MiqvÃ© of Besalu, a ritual bathhouse and part of the Jewish community in town, sheds light on the deep Jewish roots.

Or perhaps take a leisurely stroll to Garraf Massif Natural Park, a limestone mountain range that runs along the coast.

This trail takes about 4-5 hours to complete and traverses across the mountain capturing sea views and rolling hills along the way.\n\nHow to get from Barcelona to Garraf by Train\n\nTake the R2 Train from Barcelona.
