        "text": "There is no getting away from the fact Barcelona Sants is a long way from the top of any âEuropeâs Most Beautiful Train Stationsâ list.\n\nFrom the exterior the station resembles a factory with a office block perched on top of it.\n\nYou can be less than a 5 min walk from Sants station and not realise itâs in front of you.\n\nThatâs because all the platforms/tracks/vias which the trains depart from, are below ground.\n\nOnce youâre on the main concourse at Barcelona Sants you need to see through the crowds and pay close attention to the signs.\n\nOn the whole they are excellent and help make sense of what can be an initially bewildering space.\n\nThe main concourse is permanently busy.\n\nThere are THREE separate sets of ticket desks at Barcelona Sants station.\n\n(1) Desks 1-7 are towards one end of the main concourse - at the opposite end of the building from the access to the Metro.\n\nThese ticket desks sell tickets for the NON-express trains from Barcelona Sants.\n\nThese counters are marked 'Media Distancia', but they also sell tickets for the local 'Rodalies' trains.\n\nTickets for the Rodalies (local) trains, which include the trains to the airport, can't be booked online, so the queues at these ticket counters can be lengthy; particularly in summer.\n\nIt isn't possible to buy advance tickets for the local and MD trains at Sants station, you can only buy tickets valid for that day.\n\n(2) Desks 8-21 are for ADVANCE sales of tickets by express 'Larga Distancia' trains including the AVE and Euromed trains.\n\nYou cannot purchase last minute tickets for travel that day at these ticket counters.\n\nWhich is worth knowing, as to use these desks you need to take a numbered ticket from a machine and then wait for your number to be called.\n\nAt busy times you can expect to wait for more than 30 minutes.\n\nIf you have a rail pass, when you first arrive in Sants station, you can use these counters to book reservations on other trains you will be taking in Spain.\n\nHowever, the Advance ticket desks are only open on Mon-Friday from 10:00-20:00; except for public holidays, as they are also closed on those days, in addition to not being open at weekends.\n\n(3) Desks 27-33 aren't adjacent to the other ticket desks; they're over to the right below the main departure board for the Larga Distancia (long distance) trains.\n\nThey have a sign above them which reads 'Larga Distancia'.\n\nThese desks are solely for last minute tickets for travel that day by the express 'Larga Distancia (long distance) trains; the AVE, Euromed and IC trains etc\n\nAt weekends, when the advance ticket desks are closed, you cannot make advance bookings from these desks.\n\nRail pass users can use these desks to purchase reservations for trains departing that day.\n\nHowever, when using these ticket counters to buy rail pass reservations, be aware that your first choice of train may be sold out.\n\nUsing Ticket Machines:\n\nAs the queues for the ticket counters can be lengthy it can be worth trying the ticket machines.\n\nThey are plentiful at Sants station, but there are two types of machine:\n\n(1) the orange machines solely sell tickets for the Rodalies 'local' trains - so use these machines if you are heading to the airport\n\n(2) all other tickets are sold by the 'Renfe' purple and grey machines.\n\nThese machines, which have excellent English translation, don't sell rail pass reservations.\n\nDeparting by train from Barcelona Sants can be an unexpected experience and not just because the vias (platforms/tracks) which the trains use, are out of sight below the concourse.\n\nBarcelona Sants isÂ a train station where you need to set aside of expectations of how you will access the trains and let yourself be guided by the departure screens and the signs.\n\nIn particular, what isÂ unlikely to be initially obvious when taking a train from Sants, is that the station concourse is divided into four zones.\n\nThey're not marked by signs saying 'Zone 1' etc, but each of these 'zones' provides specific access to the different groups of train services which use the station\n\nTheyÂ have a similar function to theÂ gates at an airport and give access to:\n\nVias (platforms/tracks) 1 -6\n\nFor the high speedÂ (alta-velocidad) AVE,Â Alvia and TGV trains, they can be accessed through the 'Sala de embarque', security checks are carried out at its entrance on the concourse, so it's likely that you'll have to join the queue.\n\nThe Euromed services to Alicante and Valencia now ALSO depart from here.\n\nVias (platforms/tracks) 7-10:\n\nThe Rodalies trains on routes R3, R4 and R7 heading east and north via Catalunya station AND the Regional Express trains towards Vic and La Tour De Carol depart from vias 7 and 8.\n\nThe Rodalies trains heading south - including trains on line R2 (Nord) to El Prat Airport and trains heading towards Sitges - and the Regional Express trains towards Tortosa, Salou, Reus and Tarragona depart from vias 9 and 10.\n\nViasÂ (platforms/tracks) 11-12\n\nThis is where the non high-speedÂ express trains, including theÂ IC services depart from.\n\nVias (platforms/tracks) 13 -14\n\nThese are used by the loocalÂ RodaliesÂ trains heading to Passieg de Gracia andÂ Franca stations in the city centre\n\nThese vias (platforms/tracks) are also typically used by the the MD and Regional Express trains heading to Giorona, Figueres, Port Bou and Cerbere - but due to construction work, until further notice these trains will be departing from Sant Andreu station.\n\nThis station is served by Rodalies trains on lines R2 and R2 Nord which will be heading to Granollers or Macanet-Massanes.\n\nTaking a Taxi to Sants Station in Barcelona:\n\nIf you will be taking a taxi to Sants station allow additional time to make the journey.\n\nThe taxis often get jammed in a queue trying to access the taxi drop-off area.\n\nBe prepared to get out of the taxi and walk up to the station entrance if need be.\n\nThere are two main departure boards on the main concourse;\n\n(1) the one which shows the long distance 'Larga Distancia' trains is over to the right above the 'Larga Distancia' ticket desks.\n\n(2) the other, which is located above the 'Media Distancia' ticket counters, lists those MD services PLUS the local Rodalies trains,\n\nThis can be particularly disconcerting if youâre taking a long distance train from vias (platforms/tracks) 11 â 12.\n\nThe 'Media Distancia' departure board is the only one visible from this part of the station - but the train you are taking wonât be listed on it.\n\nThere are also smaller TV screen style departure monitors scattered around the station â some of which show the long distance trains and others show the local/regional trains.\n\nSo donât panic if you look a departure screen and canât see the train you will be taking.\n\nTake a look at other screens or departure boards and you will find your train - or use the paper departure 'Salidas' posters - don't confuse them with the 'Llegadas' posters, these are listing the arrivals.\n\nThese posters list all trains in consecutive departure (Salidas) order and are fairly easy to make sense of.\n\nWhen taking an (alta-velocidad) AVE, Alvia, Euromed or TGV train from Barcelona Sants, you need to use the departure hall (Sala de embarque) which gives access to vias (platforms/tracks) 1-6.\n\nThis 'Sala de embargue' has direct access from the street - if you will taking a taxi to the station tell the driver that you will be departing on an AVE or Euromed train and you can be dropped outside the entrance.\n\nThough if you have a 1st class ticket and want to use the 'Sala Club', the 1st class lounge, it is outside this 'Sala de embarque' - it's behind the ticket counters.\n\nThe specific via (platform/track) that the train will be departing from will be confirmed no more than 20 mins before departure.\n\nSo when you use the escalators or lifts to descend down to the train, it will usually already be waiting, though there will be no need to rush.\n\nFind the coach number, in which your reserved seat is located on your ticket and then make your way along the train until you find it.\n\nThere will be staff on the via (platform/track) to point you in the right direction.\n\nAim to be at Barcelona Sants, so that you're there when the departure details of your train are confirmed.\n\nYou will need to pass through ticket AND security checks before accessing a high speed train and lengthy queues can inevitably build up.\n\nAccess to the trains can be closed off around 3 -5 minutes before the departure time, the train won't usually be held back because not everyone has passed through the checks.\n\nFrom vias (platforms/tracks) 7 - 10:\n\nThe middle of the main concourse at Barcelona Sants rail station is dominated by the ticket gates that give access to vias (platforms/tracks) 7 - 10.\n\nHowever, as will be seen above, if you'll be departing from Sants on an express train you won't be using this part of the station.\n\nThe local* trains in Barcelona are known as 'Rodalies' services and MOST of them use this part of the station; including all those heading south AND those heading north via Catalunya station.\n\n*Some services can travel fairly long distances from the city.\n\nThe Rodalies trains to El Prat airport on lines R2 Nord depart from vias (tracks) 9 or 10 (either side of the same platform); there are large signs pointing the way to the airport trains.\n\nThough be aware that the trains to the airport share vias (tracks) 9 and 10 with other trains.\n\nTrains heading to Sitges on line R2 (Sud) also depart from vias (tracks) 9 and 10.\n\nIf you have luggage etc, you have to use the staffed ticket gate to access vias 7 â 10, and on a recent trip the staff here were particularly helpful.\n\nThere are escalators and lifts down to each via (platform/track).\n\nWait on vias (tracks/platforms) 7 â 10 where you can see the displays indicating which train will be departing next; your train may not be the first to arrive.\n\nFrom vias (platforms/tracks) 13 - 14:\n\nHowever, the Rodallies trains heading to Passeig de Gracia AND Franca stations DON'T depart from vias 7 -10- instead they depart from vias (tracks) 13 and 14.\n\nIf youâre heading to the beach area of Barcelona from Sants, taking one of these trains to Franca is a better option than taking the Metro.\n\nNote that the Rodalies trains from vias 13 and 14 heading for Franca station and other destinations, also call at Passeig de GrÃ cia station, which is much closer to the heart of Barcelona than Sants station.\n\nWhen arriving on a train from France, there will be staff on the platform holding signs that have the departure details of connecting long distance trains.\n\nThe escalator up to the concourse inevitably gets congested, so have patience.\n\nTry to keep luggage out of the path of those that don't have any.\n\nThere are also lifts available for those who require mobility assistance.\n\nThe escalators which lead up to the main concourse exit into what is always a busy area, so take your time and follow the signs.\n\nThe access to the Metro station will be over to the left and the main exits (salidas) from the station will be in front of you - but don't head towards them if you want a taxi.\n\nThe main taxi pick-up area will be over to the right.\n\nThe signs on the concourse are fairly easy to follow - there is a particularly large sign pointing the way to the left luggage office.\n\nThe Barcelona Metro map can resemble a bowl of spaghetti, but what can be less than obvious is that the grey lines, with fewer stations, are the routes taken by the Rodalies local mainline trains.\n\nAs will be seen the local trains to and from Barcelona-Sants also stop at multiple other locations in the city centre.\n\nThe Placa De Catalunya, the northern tip of Las Ramblas, is the heart of Barcelona, but to reach it by Metro from Sants requires a roundabout route on Metro Line L7; and the L7 platforms/tracks are a long way from the concourse at Sants station.\n\nTo Catalunya Station from Sants station:\n\nHence it can be a much quicker journey to take a Rodalies train, the one-stop hop to Catalunya station - as this station lives up to its name, meaning that it's located to the northern entrance to Las Ramblas.\n\nTake trains on routes R3, R4 and R7 from vias (tracks/platforms) 7 and 8.\n\nTo Passeig de Gracia station from Sants station:\n\nPasseig de GrÃ cia is also a station worth targeting, particularly if you'll be staying in one of the hotels nearby\n\nIt is around a 5 -10 min north from the Placa de Catalunya.\n\nYou need to take trains on lines R1, R2 Nord or R2 Sud heading to Franca, Granollers Centre or Macanet-Massanes.\n\nThese trains usually depart from vias (platforms/tracks) 13 - 14.\n\nTo Franca station from Barcelona Sants station:\n\nBarcelona Franca station is the nearest station to the fashionable marina and beach areas of the city.\n\nThis area of the city has awkward access by metro from Sants station - you'd need to transfer between Lines L5 and L4 at Verdaguer station.\n\nHowever local ' Rodalies' trains directly connect with Sants with Franca, the journey takes around 10 minutes and the trains run every 15 mins until late evening.\n\nTake the line R2 (Sud) trains, which will be terminating at Franca.\n\nThey depart from vias (tracks/platforms) 13 - 14, though be aware that other trains not heading to Franca also depart from there.\n\nThough some long distance (non AVE) trains to/from Barcelona also commence or finish their journeys at Barcelona Franca.\n\nThe Rodalies Line R2 (Nord) trains do NOT provide a direct connection with Terminal 1 (T1) at El Prat airport.\n\nInstead Terminal One (T1) at El Prat airport is served by line L9 of the Barcelona Metro\n\nHowever Metro L9 doesnât get as close to the city centre as Sants or Passeig de GrÃ cia stations, which the Rodalies trains call at.\n\nTherefore one option for travelling between Barcelona city centre and Terminal 1 at El Prat Airport by train is to take these two steps;\n\n(1) take the Rodalies trains to the T2 station\n\n(2) transfer there to/from the Metro for a one station hop to/from T1 - or exit from the T2 station and take a free shuttle bus\n\nHowever, the quickest train travel option between the city centre and Terminal 1 is usually to make the transfer between the Rodalies and Metro trains, at El Prat de Llobregat station - instead of at the T2 station.\n\nThere are more frequent Rodalies trains between Sants Station/the city centre and El Prat de Llobregat; compared to the trains between the city centre and Terminal 2.\n\nMetro Line L9 links El Prat de Llobregat station with T1 at Barcelona-El Prat airport, though be vigilant re: luggage and valuables when changing trains at El Prat de Llobregat.\n\nSo in summary, when travelling FROM the city to Terminal 1. an option is:\n\nStep One: Take any train on Rodalies lines R2 (North) OR R2 (South); directions Saint Vincenc de Calders, Vilanova i la GeltrÃº , Castelldefels or Terminal 2, to El Prat de Llobregat station.\n\nStep Two: Transfer to the Metro to T1 at El Prat de Llobregat station.\n\nYour efforts in reaching Barcelona by train will be rewarded by being able to dedicate some time to a fabulous city.\n\nThese travel guides will help you see and expererience the best of Barcelona -
