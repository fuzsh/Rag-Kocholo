        "text": "Public transport guide for Barcelona and Catalunya such as TMB Metro, busses & trams | Renfe Rodalies, Regional & Ave Trains | FGC Trains | Nord Bus terminal\n\nby: Barcelona Travel Hacks Views: 5.5k\n\nSummary of Public Transport Networks in Barcelona & Catalunya\n\nBarcelona and Catalunya are exceptionally served by Metro, tram, rail and Bus networks.\n\nBarcelona Metro: predominantly an underground railway network that serves Barcelona city. Run by transports metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB). Trains run from 5:30AM till midnight on a weekday. Friday nights it runs till 2AM and On Saturday services are all night.\n\nBarcelona Renfe Rodalies: commuter railway network for the Barcelones region that is run by the Spanish national rail operator Renfe. Trains run from 05:30 with the last trains arriving in Barcelona between 23h and midnight. The network comprises six fare zones.\n\nFGC railway: Catalan railway service consisting of two major branches. The Llobregat Anoia lines run from Plaza Espana to Montserat, Manresa and Igualada. The Valles lines Run from Plaza Catalunya to Sant Cugat, Sabadell and Terrassa. Additionally, the FGC operates some small branch cremallera (mountain racked railway) lines.\n\nCatalunya Renfe Regional: railway network that is run by the Spanish national rail operator Renfe. Trains run from 05:30 with the last trains arriving in Barcelona between 23h and midnight. Catalunya is divided into four regions, Barcalones, Girona, Tarragona and Lleida. The regional rail network interlinks the four regions and provides commuter services in the regions outside of Barcelones.\n\nRenfe High- speed AVE, AVENT & AVLO: high-speed rail network is separate to the regional and commuter network and was built recently within the last 15 years. The high-speed trains link major cities within Catalunya to the rest of Spain and parts of France.\n\nSants Station Renfe railway hub: the main Renfe hub in Barcelona and is a large station with about 17 platforms. Sections of the station are dedicated to the different types of each Renfe rail service.\n\nTMB Bus and Trams, Night Busses: extensive bus and night bus network in Barcelona city run by transports metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB). There are two main tram branches, One in Diagonal Mar - Glories area. The other Serves Diagonal Zona Universidad to Cornella de Llobregat.\n\nBusses in Catalunya: towns not served by a rail connection usually have a bus service. Depending on the size of the town and demand for transport, these bus services can be frequent or only once or twice day. There are multiple bus companies that serve in Catalunya and I will detail individually for each attraction that can be reached by a bus. Most busses depart from the airport, The Sants station bus hub or the bus hub in Estacio del Nord.\n\nTMB for Barcelona Metro, Tram & Buses\n\nTransport Metropolitans de Barcelona runs the metro service, Trams and Barcelona city busses.\n\nTMB ticket types\n\nBarcelona city busses, Tram and metro are fare zone 1 within the Barcelona integrated fare zone system.\n\nT-Casual: generally for residents of Barcelona. This ticket allows me to make 10 trips. A trip is defined as a journey where I can change from one transport system to another on the same trip as long as the change occurs within two hours of last passing my ticket through the ticket gate machines. I have used T-usual for unlimited trips, monthly when commuting to an office on a daily basis.\n\nHola BCN: See the Hola BCN section further down this page.\n\nT-grup: is a multi-person ticket of 70 trips over a period of up to 30 days. i.e. 70 people can make the same trip once, 45 people can make the same trip twice etc.\n\nNote: use a TMB ticket on the bus. TMB tickets (T-Casual, Hola BCN etc) can be purchased at Metro stations, Renfe Stations, FGC stations, some tobacco stores and some news stand stores.\n\nNote: When you board a bus or tram in Barcelona you have to validate your ticket by inserting it or tap it on one of the machines on the bus or tram. Ticket inspectors do perform checks by scanning your ticket to ensure you are not taking a free ride. Fines start from 100 euros.\n\nTMB Planned works, Outages & Service Alterations\n\nThe TMB website has a comprehensive real time service update section. For Metro and for Busses.\n\nThere is also the option to signup for real time service disruption updates via email or the TMB app.\n\nRenfe Rodalies Commuter Rail for Barcelona Suburbs\n\nThe Renfe Rodalies Network covers the Barcelones area of Catalonia and comprises of 8 lines numbered R1, R2, R2 Sud, R2Nord, R3, R4, R7 and R8. The network reaches along the south coast, North coast, to the interior towns and to the Pyrenes Mountains.\n\nRenfe Rodalies Rail Network Train Times\n\nTo check train times use the timetable link on the Renfe website.\n\nFrom the results page you can select return train times for the same day.\n\nRenfe Rodalies Rail Network Traveling with\n\nIt is possible to also travel on Rodallies trains with pets, luggage and sports equipment such as skis, bicycles etc. The bicycle area is in the middle of the newer trains and at the front for the older trains. Generally the older trains operate on the R3 line and the newer trains on the rest of the Rodalies lines. You may be refused entry to the train during rush hour in the morning if the train is really crowded. Dogs must also be wearing a muzzle. For more information consult the traveling with section of the Rodalies website.\n\nRenfe Rodalies Rail Network Tickets\n\nThe Rodalies rail network is part of the TMB integrated fare zone system of Barcelona. There are six zones and single or return tickets can be used as well as monthly or season tickets for the relevant zone. Note that the R3 line goes outside of Zone 6 to get to the Pyrenes towns so a monthly or season ticket cannot be used to reach these stations and a return or single fare ticket must be used. Information about the integrated zoned fare system can be found on the Gencat website.\n\nRenfe Rodalies offers combined Entry and rail tickets to some popular tourist attractions in Barcelona. See the bottom of the Rodalies page for details.\n\nRenfe Rodalies Planned works, Enginnering works & Service Outages\n\nFor the Renfe Rodalies and Regional train services the Gencat website can be consulted to check if there are any planned engineering works or major disruptions to service.\n\nThe information in English is only a brief overview. For more details about start date/time and end date/time of engineering works, thisGencat website link can be used. For the major works greater detail is provided but the information is only available in Spanish.\n\nFerrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) Commuter Rail\n\nThis is a Catalan owned railway service consisting of two major branches:\n\nLlobregat anoia lines: run from plaça España to Montserrat, Manresa and Igualada.\n\nValles lines: run from plaça Catalunya to Sant Cugat, Sabadell and Terrassa.\n\nThe FGC website has recently been upgraded but it is still a bit confusing to navigate and, in my opinion, worse than the previous version! Here are some tips on how to find information.\n\nFGC Train times\n\nWhen checking train times on the FGC website you must first select the llobregat Anoia or Valles lines.\n\nFrom here you enter the origin station. Which loads another page with an auto completing form.\n\nFGC Traveling with\n\nIt is possible to also travel on FGC trains with pets, luggage and sports equipment such as skis, bicycles etc. The bicycle area is at the front of the trains. You may be refused entry to the train during rush hour in the morning if the train is really crowded. Dogs must also be wearing a muzzle. For more information consult the Norms and terms of service page of the FGC website.\n\nFGC Rail Network Tickets\n\nThe FGC rail network is part of the TMB integrated fare zone system of Barcelona. There are six zones and single or return tickets can be used as well as monthly or season tickets for the relevant zone. Information about the integrated zoned fare system can be found on the Gencat website.\n\nOn the integrated TMB commuter rail map you can check what zone a station is in.\n\nThe FGC website has PDF files for each ticket type per zone. For example you might want a monthly two zone season ticket or a return ticket to a station in zone 4.\n\nFGC Cremallera & Funicular lines\n\nI have detailed the FGC Cremallera and Funicular trains on their own pages detailing what to see and do.\n\nCremallera & Funiculars de Montserrat\n\nCremallera Vall de Nuria\n\nFuniculars de Vallvidrera\n\nRenfe Regional Rail to Lleida, Girona & Tarragona\n\nThe regional rail network has three main branches:\n\nNorth Branch: served by R11 and RG1 lines to Girona, Figueres and Portbou or Cerbere (in France).\n\nSouthern Branch: served by R14, R15, R16 and R17 lines, to towns in the Tarragona region along the Costa Dorada and to interior towns.\n\nWestern Branch: served by R12, R13 and R14 lines to Lleida via Manressa or Tarragona.\n\nThe Renfe website is a mess and it can be tricky sometimes to find the relevant information. There is no specific section on the website for Regional services so I will attempt to run through the main points here.\n\nRenfe Regional train tickets & train times\n\nRegional train times can be checked on the main Renfe webpage.\n\nThe results table of the search shows train times and fares for outbound and return trains. Not all tickets can be purchased online. Tickets that have to be purchased at the station in ticket machines are 3.5% more expensive.\n\nFor frequent travellers, there are a number of passes if you make the same journey multiple times for work or leisure. For more details see this section of the Renfe website.\n\nRenfe Regional train Travelling with\n\nIt is possible to also travel on Regional trains with pets, luggage and sports equipment such as skis, bicycles etc. The bicycle area is Normally at the front of the train. You may be refused entry to the train during rush hour in the morning if the train is really crowded. Dogs must also be wearing a muzzle.\n\nRenfe Luggage policy. You can carry up to 3 pieces of hand luggage onto the train, provided that the sum of the three does not exceed 25 kg and The maximum dimensions allowed are 85cm x 55cm x 35cm, although I have never seen this being enforced.\n\nRenfe bycicle policy For Regional trains the rules are the same as Media Distancia (Mid-distance), Cercanias or Feve trains.\n\nRenfe pets policy States that pets can be transported in a carrier with one pet per passenger. I have travelled on Regional trains with small dogs outside of a carrier but with a muzzle. However it is best ask at the station before travelling as rules might depend on the line.\n\nRenfe Regional Planned works, Engineering works & Service outages\n\nFor the Renfe Rodalies and Regional train services the Gencat website can be consulted to check if there are any planned engineering works or major disruptions to service.\n\nThe information in English is only a brief overview. For more details about start date/time and end date/time of engineering works, thisGencat website link can be used. For the major works greater detail is provided but the information is only available in Spanish.\n\nHigh Speed Rail Network (AVE, AVLO, SNCF, OUIGO ESPAÑA)\n\nThe Adif high-speed rail network is separate to the regional and commuter network and was built recently within the last 20 years. The high-speed rail network is rated at 250 to 300 Km/h train services and link major cities within Catalunya to the rest of Spain, primarily via Madrid. Note that ADIF maintain the infrastructure (tracks, stations, tunnels, bridges, etc. Renfe operate the trains. The high speed Rail network also links into France's High speed rail network after Figueres.\n\nThere are multiple operators and services that run on the high-speed network:\n\nAVE: is the Renfe run Alta Velocidad España and connects major cities of the autonomous regions to madrid.\n\nAVLo: is a new low cost Renfe AVE service.\n\nOuigo España: is a new low cost high-speed operator with services linking Barcelona-Madrid, Valencia-Madrid, Zaragoza-Barcelona, Zaragoza-Madrid, Zaragoza-Camp de Tarragona, Camp de Tarragona-Madrid.\n\nIryo: is a new high-speed operator with services linking Barcelona-Madrid, Barcelona-Camp de Tarragona, Barcelona-Zaragoza, Alicante-Madrid, Alicante-Albacete, Alicante-Cuenca, Albacete-Madrid, Antequera-Cordoba, Antequera-Madrid, Antequera-Malaga, Zaragoza-Camp de Tarragona, Camp de Tarragona-Madrid.\n\nSNCF: is the French Rail operator and runs services from France to Barcelona-Sants via the Spanish High-Speed rail network.\n\nRenfe High-Speed Rail\n\nThe AVANT are high speed trains that perform commuter services within a region using older Iberian Gauge railway lines but some trains can switch gauge to travel on the high-speed rail network.\n\nThe high-speed trains depart from Barcelona-Sants station. Passengers for these services pass through airport style security with x-ray machines. Allow time for this security check, minimum half an hour before train departure.\n\nRenfe High-speed train times and tickets\n\nRenfe High-speed train times can be consulted on the main Renfe webpage.\n\nThe results table of the search shows two tabs: train times and fares for outbound and return trains. For Ave, AVlo and AVANT trains I recommend purchasing tickets online.\n\nClicking on a train will produce a popup at the bottom of the window to select the train and add it to your cart. Repeat process for return train and follow onscreen instructions to process payment.\n\nFor frequent travellers of the AVE and AVANT services, Renfe offer multiuse tickets and passes on the website.\n\nRenfe High-speed train Travelling with\n\nThe rules about travelling with luggage, animals, bycicles are strictly enforced on AVE and AVANT trains.\n\nHand luggage is limited to two bags per customer with a total weight of 20kg and the size of the larger luggage item not exceeding 70cm x 50cm x 25cm.\n\nTravelling with bicycles on AVE or AVENT is tricky and Renfe has strict rules. I have never seen Bicycles on AVE trains and I suspect you will get turned away by security by default. The rules can be read from the above link but I would recommend going to the AVE and AVANT ticket office at Sants Station and asking specifically.\n\nTravelling with pets is also theoretically possible but I have never seen it done. The rules specify max weight of the animal 10 Kg and in a carry container with minimum dimensions of 60cm x 35cm x35cm. The rules section also specifies that the container has a means to remove any residue from the animal! I would recommend going to the AVE and AVANT ticket office at Sants Station and asking specifically. Guide dogs are allowed.\n\nT-mobilitat - Discontinuation of Paper Tickets\n\nBarcelona is currently phasing out paper tickets and replacing it with a new ticketing and validation system for public transport that allows you to travel using contactless technology - T-mobilitat.\n\nT-mobilitat has four methods of use Called Supports:\n\nMobile device: Register for T-mobilitat with the TMB App and select the Mobile option in the T-mobilitat section.
