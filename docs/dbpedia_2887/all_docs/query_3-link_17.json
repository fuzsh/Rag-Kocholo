Information current for 2024.\n\nBefore you buy your tickets\n\nTake a moment to read these tips for buying European train tickets. They answer the usual questions including \"Do I need to book in advance or can I just buy at the station?\", \"Can I stop off?\", \"Are there Senior fares?\" and the old favourite, \"Should I buy an $800 railpass or buy a 35 point-to-point ticket online?\". How far ahead can you buy train tickets?\n\nEuropean train travel FAQ\n\nBarcelona to other Spanish cities\n\nPopular train routes from Barcelona:\n\nBarcelona to Madrid\n\nBarcelona to Malaga, Cordoba & Seville\n\nBarcelona to Granada\n\nBarcelona to Valencia & Alicante\n\nBarcelona to San Sebastian & Bilbao\n\nBarcelona to Santiago de Compostela, A Coruña & Vigo\n\nBarcelona to Ibiza by ferry\n\nBarcelona to Mallorca by ferry\n\nAll Spanish long-distance trains and even many regional trains require seat reservation and have variable pricing, so yes, trains can sell out although although outside busy holiday periods it's easy to buy tickets at the station on the day of travel if you want.\n\nRenfe has airline-style fares for its long-distance trains, so tickets will be much more expensive bought on the day, much cheaper booked in advance. So pre-book if possible.\n\nFor more information including an explanation of Renfe's fare types & classes, see the train travel in Spain page.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nArguably the quickest & easiest way to buy Spanish train tickets is at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com with print-at-home tickets and Renfe's cheap prices shown. Raileurope & Thetrainline link to Renfe's ticketing system and sell Renfe's cheap fares at the same prices as Renfe in , £ or $ with the same print-at-home tickets, in plain English without Renfe's quirky translation or credit card acceptance problems. Anyone can use Raileurope or Thetrainline as they accept international credit cards. There's a small booking fee. More about Raileurope. More about Thetrainline.\n\nNote that in Spain, although infants under 4 go free, for journeys on any mainline long-distance train wholly within Spain, you'll need to obtain a free infant ticket at a Renfe ticket office before boarding, see the advice here.\n\nYou can of course buy tickets direct from Spanish Railways at www.renfe.com, with no booking fee. The disadvantage is that Renfe.com has more than its fair share of quirks, so please read the advice on using Renfe.com here. The quirks include some odd English translations and a reputation for rejecting a significant proportion of overseas credit cards with various error messages. Although I have to say it has always worked OK with my credit card and it now also accepts PayPal.\n\nYou can also book Spanish trains online in US$ in plain English with no payment problems at www.petrabax.com. This is a US-based agency that also links to the Renfe ticketing system, so has the same trains and cheap prices, with a small mark-up. It issues the same print-at-home tickets as renfe.com, so anyone from any country worldwide can use it, including the United States, Canada & Australia.\n\nBarcelona to Madrid by AVE, Ouigo, Avlo or Iryo\n\nSee the Barcelona to Madrid page for advice.\n\nEvery hour or two, high-speed AVE trains link Barcelona Sants with Madrid Atocha in as little as 2h30, faster (and a lot less hassle) than flying. The route has been opened up to competition, and as well as Renfe's AVEs you can now also choose a lo-cost Ouigo train, lo-cost Avlo train or competing full-service Iryo train.\n\nA Barcelona-Madrid AVE (type S103) at Barcelona Sants. See virtual tour\n\nComfort (1st) class seating on an AVE train.\n\nCafe-bar on an S103 AVE train.\n\nScenery from the high-speed AVE between Barcelona & Madrid. Photo courtesy of DiscoverByRail.com.\n\nMadrid Atocha station: One of my favourite stations, the old trainshed has been preserved and turned into a tropical garden, see Madrid Atocha station guide.\n\nBarcelona to Malaga, Cordoba & Seville by AVE or Iryo\n\nAVE: Direct AVE high-speed trains leave Barcelona Sants at 08:35 and 15:15 every day for Cordoba, Seville & Malaga.\n\nIt's beats flying: City centre to city centre with no formal check-in. Flying is a relay-race of train, airport, flight, airport, bus, taking around 4 hours so saving very little time over the train and denying you the relaxing journey across Spain through the countryside at ground level, seeing the country you're supposed to be visiting.\n\nThese trains leave Barcelona Sants on the high-speed line towards Madrid - you get great views of Montserrat on your right (see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montserrat_(mountain) soon after departure. Just south of Madrid, a chord line allows the train to by-pass Madrid Atocha and join the Madrid-Andalucía high-speed line heading southwards. It's pretty scenic, especially where the train speeds through the mountains, short tunnels alternating with viaducts across rocky valleys.\n\nSuperb AVE-S103 trains are now used on this route, with Standard (2nd) class & Comfort (1st) class seats. The trains have a cafe-bar serving beer, wine, tea, coffee, snacks and some hot dishes. The train has power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. If you pay the Premium fare you get access to the Sala Club lounge in Barcelona, and a meal with wine served at your seat. More about Renfe's fares & classes.\n\nIryo: Since December 2023 you'll also find two direct Iryo trains competing with Renfe between Barcelona and Cordoba/Seville, use www.thetrainline.com to see times and prices and compare with Renfe AVE prices.\n\nFares start at around 36 in standard (2nd) class or 64 in comfort (1st) class.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead for the cheapest prices. Reservation is compulsory so trains can in theory sell out, and do so at very busy times, but there are usually places available even on the day.\n\nBuy tickets at www.thetrainline.com or www.raileurope.com and print your own ticket. More about buying Spanish train tickets. Booking usually opens several months ahead but Renfe are inconsistent in how far ahead they open bookings.\n\nNote that in Spain, although infants under 4 go free, for journeys on any mainline long-distance train wholly within Spain, you'll need to obtain a free infant ticket at a Renfe ticket office before boarding, see the advice here.\n\nAn AVE of type S103 at Barcelona Sants.

Flying is a relay-race of train, airport, flight, airport, bus, taking around 4 hours so saving very little time over the train and denying you the relaxing journey across Spain through the countryside at ground level, seeing the country you're supposed to be visiting.\n\nThese trains leave Barcelona Sants on the high-speed line towards Madrid - you get great views of Montserrat on your right (see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montserrat_(mountain) soon after departure.

It's pretty scenic, especially where the train speeds through the mountains, short tunnels alternating with viaducts across rocky valleys.\n\nSuperb AVE S112 trains are used on this route, with 3 classes: Standard (2nd class), Comfort (1st class seats without 1st class extras), Comfort (1st class for Premium ticket holders, access to Sala Club lounge, meal & wine included in fare served at seat on some trains). More about classes. The trains have a cafe-bar serving beer, wine, tea, coffee, snacks and some hot dishes, and free WiFi.\n\nFares start at around 36 in standard (2nd) class or 64 in comfort (1st) class.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead for the cheapest prices.

More about buying Spanish train tickets. Booking usually opens 60 days ahead but Renfe are very inconsistent in how far ahead they open bookings and it can be less than this.\n\nIf you're going to Valencia, the slower Intercity trains use the classic Valencia Estació del Nord. The faster Euromed trains use Valencia Joaquin Sorolla station a little further from the city centre. In Alicante, both train types use Alacant Terminal.\n\nNote that in Spain, although infants under 4 go free, for journeys on any mainline long-distance train wholly within Spain, you'll need to obtain a free infant ticket at a Renfe ticket office before boarding, see the advice here.\n\nEuromed train at Barcelona Sants. These S130 trains are known as Patito (little duck) by staff, no prizes for guessing why.\n\nEuromed cafe-bar.\n\nEuromed standard (2nd) class.\n\nBarcelona to San Sebastian & Bilbao\n\nEvery morning at 08:45 a comfortable high-speed Alvia train links Barcelona Sants with Bilbao in 6h51.\n\nEvery afternoon at 15:30 a comfortable high-speed Alvia train links Barcelona Sants with San Sebastian in 5h46.\n\nThere are other services during the day with a change of train.\n\nThe trains are fully-air-conditioned with Standard (2nd) class & Comfort (1st) class and a cafe-bar serving beer, wine, tea, coffee, snacks.\n\nThe train rolls out of Barcelona with views of Montserrat on your right (see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montserrat_(mountain) on the standard-gauge high-speed line towards Zaragoza, this particular type of train travels at up to 250km/h (155 mph). Just beyond Zaragoza it shows of its party trick: It slows to 50 km/h and passes seamlessly through a gauge-changing system where the wheels adjust from standard gauge (the new high-speed lines are all standard 4' 8.5\") to wider Iberian gauge (5' 6\"). It then rolls across the plains on the classic lines calling at Pamplona, then (on the San Sebastian route) climbs into the mountains, twisting and turning. A lovely run!\n\nFares start at 22.90 in standard (2nd) class or 29.90 in comfort (1st) class.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead. Reservation is compulsory so trains can in theory sell out, and do so at very busy times.\n\nBuy online at www.thetrainline.com or www.raileurope.com and print your own ticket.\n\nMore about buying Spanish train tickets.

It's not the fastest option, but at least it's direct, a chill-out day across Spain on an excellent air-conditioned train with cafe-bar. Sit back and enjoy the ride.\n\nOn Wednesdays, Fridays & Sundays it leaves Barcelona Sants at 09:05 and goes to Vigo Guixar, arriving 23:35.\n\nOn Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays & Saturdays it leaves Barcelona Sants at 09:05 and arrives Santiago de Compostela 22:06 & A Coruña 22:38.\n\nCheck times & buy tickets at either www.thetrainline.com or www.raileurope.com and print your own ticket.

Booking usually opens 60 days ahead but Renfe are inconsistent in how far ahead they open bookings, it's often less than this.\n\nTip: To find times/tickets for this trip you need to split the booking: First search trains from Madrid to your destination in Galicia. Then look for a train from Barcelona to Madrid arriving at Madrid Atocha at least 90 minutes before the onward train leaves Madrid Chamartin.\n\nNote that in Spain, although infants under 4 go free, for journeys on any mainline long-distance train wholly within Spain, you'll need to obtain a free infant ticket at a Renfe ticket office before boarding, see the advice here.\n\nBarcelona to Ibiza by ferry\n\nTrasmed (formerly Acciona Trasmediterranea) offer an overnight ferry from Barcelona to Ibiza most nights, around 22:00, arriving 07:00.\n\nThe ferry has cosy cabins, bar & restaurant, it sails from the Trasmed terminal in central Barcelona, a few minutes' walk from the Columbus monument at the foot of La Rambla. Check sailing dates & times at the Direct Ferries website or www.trasmed.com.\n\nBalearia also operate an overnight ferry to Ibiza on most nights of the week, times vary but it typically sails at 22:00, arriving in Ibiza town (Ibiza Ciudad) at 06:00. Check sailing dates & times at the Direct Ferries website or www.balearia.com.\n\nBlue arrow = Balearia ferry terminal, white arrow = Trasmed terminal. Above right, the Balearia terminal. See map of Barcelona showing ferry terminals.\n\nBalearia ferry in Ibiza harbour. Courtesy of Discoverbyrail.com.\n\nBarcelona to Mallorca by ferry\n\nOvernight ferry: There are two overnight ferries from Barcelona to Palma de Mallorca, both with restaurants, bars & cosy en suite cabins. One is run by Trasmed (formerly Acciona Trasmediterranea) (www.trasmed.com\n\n, UK agent Southern Ferries on 0844 815 7785), the other run by Balearia (www.balearia.com).\n\nBoth ships usually sail from Barcelona around around 22:00 and arrive in Palma around 07:00. Check times & buy tickets at the Direct Ferries website.\n\nThe Trasmed & Balearia ferry terminals are located in central Barcelona, a few minutes' walk from the Columbus monument at the foot of La Rambla. I recommend Trasmed, as they have the bigger, nicer ships which usually sail from right alongside the terminal so you can walk straight onto the ship, whereas the smaller Balearia ship requires an awkward shuttle bus transfer between the ferry check-in and the vessel in both Barcelona and Palma.\n\nFast ferry: On many days in summer Balearia operate a daytime fast ferry (SeaCat) from Barcelona to Alcudia, on the northeast corner of Mallorca near both Alcudia and Pollensa, calling at Minorca on the way. This leaves from directly alongside the Balearia terminal in central Barcelona around 17:00 and arrives at 23:00. See www.balearia.com or use the Direct Ferries website to check whether it is running on your dates of travel. There will be plenty of taxis waiting at Alcudia ferry terminal, it's a 10 minute taxi ride to Pollensa.\n\nTrain service on Mallorca: There are two train lines on Majorca, from Palma to Inca & Soller, see www.tib.org & (for Soller) trendesoller.com.\n\nBlue arrow = Balearia ferry terminal, white arrow = Trasmed terminal.

The voyages takes 1 night & 1½ days or 2 nights, 1 day.\n\nNaviera Armas sail weekly from Huelva to Tenerife & Gran Canaria, see www.navieraarmas.com or book on the Direct Ferries website.\n\nFred Olsen/Balearia ferries sail 2 or 3 times a week all year round from Huelva to Tenerife & Gran Canaria, see www.fredolsen.es or book on the Direct Ferries website.\n\nTrasmediterranea sail from Cadiz in mainland Spain with Arrecife (Lanzarote), Las Palmas and Tenerife once or twice a week, taking 2 nights, www.trasmediterranea.es.\n\nAfter checking ferry sailing dates & times, check train times & buy tickets from Barcelona to Huelva or Cadiz at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com. You may well need to stay overnight in Cadiz or Huelva.\n\nBack to top\n\nBarcelona to Gibraltar\n\nStep 1, travel from Barcelona to Algeciras, taking the 11:00 high-speed AVE train from Barcelona Sants to Madrid Atocha then the 15:16 Intercity train from Madrid Atocha to Algeciras, arriving 21:13.\n\nThe trains are comfortable, air-conditioned with cafe-bar. There's great scenery both on the high-speed line between Madrid and Cordoba through the mountains and on the classic line twisting through the hills to Algeciras, the Spanish town across the bay from Gibraltar, see a video of the journey here.\n\nFares start at around 50.\n\nBuy tickets at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com, both easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee, or at the Spanish Railways website www.renfe.com (much more fiddly, may reject some overseas credit cards, see this advice on using it first). You print your own tickets. Booking should open 60 days ahead but it varies.\n\nStep 2, take a bus or taxi from Algeciras to la Linea & walk into Gibraltar.\n\nA taxi from Algeciras railway station to La Linea costs 24.75 and takes about 22 minutes. Taxis don't use the meter on this run, and aren't normally allowed to cross the border into Gibraltar.\n\nTo go by bus, cross the roundabout outside Algeciras railway station and enter the San Bernado bus station, then take bus M-120 to La Linea for around 2.50. Bus M-120 runs every 30 minutes Mon-Fri at xx.00 and xx.30 past each hour or every 45 minutes at weekends, journey time about 45 minutes to La Linea, for bus information see siu.ctmcg.es.\n\nLa Linea is the Spanish town outside the border crossing to Gibraltar, and La Linea's bus stop and taxi rank are right outside the entrance to Gibraltar. Walk through the Spanish then UK passport checkpoints into Gibraltar (5-10 minutes). Then either (a) keep walking straight ahead into Gibraltar town, it's takes about 15 minutes to the centre or (b) take a frequent local Gibraltar bus from the border into town or (c) look for the taxi stop on the right just after the passport check and wait for a taxi to your hotel for a few pounds - Gibraltar taxis will accept euros. The walk from the border to Gibraltar's Main Street takes you across Gibraltar airport's runway, though they stop cars and pedestrians when an aircraft is landing or taking off. Map of Algeciras - La Linea - Gibraltar area.\n\nAlternative via San Roque-La Linea station: The closest station to Gibraltar is actually San Roque-La Linea, and all trains to Algeciras call here around 20 minutes before arriving at Algeciras. So if you prefer, you can get off here and take a taxi to La Linea, or walk the 1.6 km (1 mile) to the Bar La Redonda bus stop on the main road on the M-120 bus route from Algeciras to La Linea. Buses run to La Linea every 30 minutes weekdays, every 45 minutes weekends. Taxis are usually available outside San Roque station, San Roque to the La Linea/Gibraltar border is about 16 km (10 miles) and it takes just over 30 minutes depending on traffic.\n\nBack to top\n\nBarcelona to London from 96\n\nBarcelona to Paris by TGV, Paris to London by Eurostar, see the London to Spain page.\n\nBack to top\n\nBarcelona to Dublin & Ireland\n\nOption 1, Barcelona to Dublin using a direct ferry from Spain to Ireland\n\nStep 1, travel from Barcelona to Bilbao by train.\n\nThere's a daily 08:45 train from Barcelona Sants to Bilbao Abando station, journey time 6h50.\n\nCheck ferry sailing times and dates first, then check train times & buy tickets at either www.thetrainline.com (easiest to use, in , £ or $) or www.renfe.com (in , much more fiddly). Look for a train which arrives several hours before the ferry sails, to allow for any delay and the transfer to the port. If necessary travel the day before.\n\nOn arrival at Bilbao Abando, take the metro to Santurtzi metro station, 21-23 minutes, see www.metrobilbao.net. Then take a 5 km 18 taxi ride to the ferry terminal at Zierbena, 16 km northwest of central Bilbao.\n\nStep 2, sail from Bilbao to Rosslare with Brittany Ferries.\n\nThe ferry sails twice a week for most of the year, typically either sailing at 13:01 arriving at 20:46 next day, or sailing at 18:00 and arriving at 06:00 2 nights later. Check sailing dates and book online at www.brittany-ferries.ie.\n\nThe ferry has restaurants, bar, lounges, and cosy private cabins all with shower & toilet.\n\nStep 3, take a train from Rosslare to Dublin, www.irishrail.ie. In Rosslare, the ferry terminal is a few minutes walk from the railway station platform.\n\nOption 2, Barcelona to Dublin via Paris and ferry from Cherbourg to Dublin\n\nDay 1, travel from Barcelona to Paris by TGV as shown below.\n\nYou can book this at www.thetrainline.com from 39.\n\nStay overnight in Paris, see suggested hotels near Paris stations.\n\nAlternatively, travel from Barcelona to Paris using a sleeper, as shown on the Barcelona to Paris by sleeper page.\n\nDay 2, take a morning train to Cherbourg & ferry overnight to Dublin as shown in the Paris to Dublin section, arriving in the morning on Day 3.\n\nIrish Ferries sails Cherbourg-Dublin several times a week. Start by booking the ferry at www.irishferries.com and add a train connection using www.thetrainline.com, see the Paris to Dublin section for full details.\n\nBack to top\n\nBarcelona to Paris from 39\n\nOption 1, Barcelona to Paris by high-speed train in 6h30 from 39\n\nHigh-speed TGV Duplex trains link Barcelona Sants with Paris Gare de Lyon every day in around 6h30, with departures from Barcelona at 09:28 & 13:25 all year round, see the timetable & information here. An additional afternoon departure may run in July & August.\n\nA flight from Barcelona to Paris takes up to 5 hours when ground transportation, check-in time and airport security are added. The train takes hardly any longer but is the relaxing option with a chance to chill out and see Spanish & French countryside roll past your window, see here for the sights to see from the train on the way. I recommend selecting an upper deck seat for the best views on thee impressive & comfortable 320km/h (199mph) double-decker trains, with a cafe-bar on board and power sockets at all seats.\n\nFares start at 39 in 2nd class or 59 in 1st class. Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBuy tickets at either www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee) or www.raileurope.com (easy to use, in , £ or $, small booking fee, about Raileurope) or www.thetrainline.com (also easy to use, in , £ or $, small booking fee, about Trainline).\n\nBooking opens up to 4 months ahead. You print your own ticket or can show a mobile ticket on your phone.\n\nTip: www.sncf-connect.com & www.thetrainline.com allow you to choose your seat from a seat map when booking 1st class tickets.\n\nSee the TGV from Paris to Barcelona page for more details of times, fares, how to buy tickets & photos & a video guide to the journey.\n\nThe morning TGV to Paris, boarding at Barcelona Sants.

One of the highest peaks in the mighty Pyrenees, the 2,784m (9,137 feet) high Mt Canigou dominates the skyline on the right all the way from Girona to Perpignan, see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canigou. More photos of what to see on the Paris-Barcelona train journey.\n\nOption 2, Barcelona to Paris by sleeper train via Latour de Carol\n\nThe Barcelona-Paris Elipsos sleeper train was discontinued in 2013, but you can still travel overnight, using a local train through the scenic Pyrenees from Barcelona to Latour de Carol, then the French overnight train from Latour de Carol to Paris. Departure from Barcelona around 14:00, arrive Paris around 07:00 next day.\n\nSee the Barcelona to Paris by sleeper train page for full details, prices, tips & how to buy tickets.\n\nOption 3, Barcelona to Paris by sleeper train via Cerbère/Perpignan\n\nThis is very similar to option 2, but uses the Cerebère-Perpignan-Paris overnight train rather than the Paris-Latour one, so you go along the coast rather than directly through the Pyrenees. This night train runs daily in summer, but usually only Fridays & Sundays in winter. Departure from Barcelona around 15:15, arrival in Paris around 07:00 next day.\n\nSee the Barcelona to Paris by sleeper train page for full details, prices, tips & how to buy tickets.\n\nBarcelona to Perpignan, Narbonne, Montpellier, Nîmes\n\nOption 1, Barcelona to southern France by high-speed train - the fastest option\n\nUp to 5 high-speed TGV Duplex & AVE services link Barcelona Sants with Narbonne, Perpignan, Montpellier & Nîmes.\n\nSNCF (French Railways) run two daily TGV Duplex trains leaving Barcelona Sants at 09:28 & 13:35 en route to Paris, with a 3rd in July & August.\n\nRenfe (Spanish Railways) run two cross-border AVEs leaving Barcelona Sants at 08:19 & 16:34, en route to Lyon and Marseille respectively.\n\nUntil December 2022, Renfe & SNCF co-operated in running and marketing all these trains, now each runs its own trains and you won't find the Spanish trains listed on the French Railways website, and vice versa!\n\nFares start at around 29 in 2nd class or 39 in 1st class. Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nYou can buy tickets for both SNCF's TGV and Renfe's AVE at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com (both easy to use, in , £ or $, small booking fee, international payment cards no problem).\n\nBooking opens up to 4 months ahead. You print your own ticket or can show a mobile ticket on your phone.\n\nAlternatively, you can book the French TGV trains at www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee) and the Spanish AVE trains at www.renfe.com (significantly more fiddly, in , see advice on using it).\n\nTip: www.sncf-connect.com & www.thetrainline.com allow you to choose your seat from a seat map when booking 1st class on a TGV.\n\nTip: Plain Nîmes is the main station in the city centre, sometimes called Nîmes Centre. Nîmes Pont du Gard is a new out-of-town station on the high-speed bypass line. If you are visiting Nîmes, I recommend using the city centre station. Similarly, Montpellier Saint-Roche is the main station in the city centre, Montpellier Sud de France is a new out-of-town station on the high-speed bypass line.\n\nMt Canigou & the Pyrenees. One of the highest peaks in the mighty Pyrenees, the 2,784m (9,137 feet) high Mt Canigou dominates the skyline on the right all the way from Girona to Perpignan, see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canigou.\n\nOption 2, Barcelona to southern France by classic train - slower, but cheaper, scenic and with a much wider range of departures!\n\nWith the high-speed service so sparse, the classic route can be a useful alternative, Barcelona to Portbou on the border by Spanish local train, then Portbou to Narbonne, Perpignan, Montpellier & Nîmes by French TER regional train.\n\nFurthermore, the high-speed service is cheap when booked in advance, expensive at short notice. This route uses local trains with fixed prices, you can pay affordable fares even on the day of travel. And if you've an Interrail or Eurail pass, no reservation is needed.\n\nThe only catch? Renfe has chosen to put Barcelona-Portbou local trains in a totally separate database, unconnected with any other system in the outside world, so they don't show up on normal booking systems such as www.raileurope.com, www.thetrainline.com or the official French Railways site www.sncf-connect.com or the Spanish Railways site www.renfe.com. Stupid, eh? So you need to look up these trains on a special website, then look up onward trains from Portbou at the normal booking websites.\n\nStep 1, check times from Barcelona Sants to Portbou at the Barcelona suburban lines website rodalies.gencat.cat.\n\nAt the time I write this, you'll find departures from Barcelona Sants as follows:\n\nMondays-Saturdays at 06:16, 07:16, 07:46, 08:16, 09:16, 10:16, 11:16, 11:46, 13:16, 15:16, 15:46, 17:16.\n\nSundays at 07:46, 08:46, 09:46, 10:46, 11:46, 12:46, 13:46, 15:16, 17:16.\n\nJourney time varies from 2h13 to 3h14.\n\nAll trains are air-conditioned.\n\nThe fare is 13.50 on most trains marked R (Rodalies, suburban), or 18.10 on a few fast services marked MD (Media Distancia).\n\nThese are fixed-price unlimited-availability fares, you can turn up on the day and pay this, it cannot sell out. You can check fares using the journey planner at rodalies.gencat.cat.\n\nYou can also join these trains at Barcelona Plaza Catalunya which might be more convenient for you.\n\nStep 2, check times from Portbou to Narbonne, Perpignan, Montpellier & Nimes at www.raileurope.com, www.thetrainline.com or the official French Railways site www.sncf-connect.com.\n\nI'd allow at least 10 minutes to change at Portbou.\n\nTrains leave Portbou every 2 hours until early evening, taking 57 minutes to Perpignan, 1h47 to Narbonne, 3h to Montpellier, 3h41 to Nimes.\n\nFor example, you could leave Barcelona Sants at 11:16, change at Portbou, arriving Perpignan 15:01, Narbonne 15:51, Montpellier St Roche 17:04, Nimes 17:42.\n\nThese trains run along the coast via Port Vendres and Collioure, with great coastal scenery.\n\nThe fare is 9.20 from Portbou to Perpignan, 19.10 to Narbonne, 33 to Montpellier, 39.10 to Nimes.\n\nThese are fixed price, unlimited-availability fares, cannot sell out, you can buy on the day at this price.\n\nIf you book in advance, you'll find some limited-availability fares from 1, only good for the specific train you book.\n\nBarcelona to Lyon\n\nOption 1, Barcelona to Lyon by direct AVE train - recommended\n\nA direct AVE high-speed train leaves Barcelona Sants at 08:19 and arrives Lyon Part Dieu at 13:20.\n\nThis comfortable Spanish high-speed train has a cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. Look out for great views of the imposing 2,784m Mt Canigou on the left as the train rounds the southern end of the Pyrenees, you'll pass the historic Fort de Salses on the left by the tracks just after Perpignan, flamingos on the lakes in the South of France between Narbonne & Montpelier, and Béziers cathedral on the left, see the photos, tips & journey information here.\n\nFares start at 39 in 2nd class or 49 in 1st class. Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBook this train at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com (both sites easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee) or at the Spanish Railways website www.renfe.com (in , significantly more fiddly, see advice on using it).\n\nBooking normally opens 4 months ahead. You print your own ticket.\n\nOption 2, Barcelona to Lyon with a change of train\n\nThere are two other good options, using French-run trains, with a change of train en route:\n\nLeave Barcelona Sants at 09:28 daily, change at Valence, arrive Lyon Part Dieu 15:50.\n\nLeave Barcelona Sants at 13:25 daily, change at Valence, arrive Lyon Part Dieu 18:50.\n\nAs with the direct AVE, you'll get great views of the imposing 2,784m Mt Canigou as the train rounds the southern end of the Pyrenees, you'll pass the historic Fort de Salses right by the tracks just after Perpignan, flamingos on the lakes in the South of France between Narbonne & Montpelier, and Béziers cathedral.\n\nFares start at around 39 in 2nd class or 49 in 1st class. Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nCheck train times & buy tickets at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com (both sites easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee) or the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee).\n\nBooking opens up to 4 months ahead. You print your own ticket or can show a mobile ticket on your phone.\n\nBarcelona to Bordeaux\n\nOption 1, Barcelona to Bordeaux via Narbonne - this is fastest & easiest\n\nTake a high-speed TGV Duplex from Barcelona Sants to Narbonne then an Intercité from Narbonne to Bordeaux St Jean.\n\nLeave Barcelona Sants at 09:28, change at Narbonne, arrive Bordeaux St Jean at 15:39.\n\nLeave Barcelona Sants at 13:25, change at Narbonne, arrive Bordeaux St Jean at 19:35.\n\nThe TGV Duplex has a cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi, you'll get great views of the imposing 2,784m Mt Canigou as the train rounds the southern end of the Pyrenees, you'll pass the historic Fort de Salses right by the tracks just after Perpignan.\n\nThe Intercité has a refreshment trolley & free WiFi.\n\nBarcelona-Narbonne starts at 29, Narbonne-Bordeaux at around 20. Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBook from Barcelona Sants to Bordeaux St Jean at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com (both sites easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee) or the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee).\n\nBooking opens up to 4 months ahead. In the search results, look for options with just 1 change. You print your own ticket or can show a mobile ticket on your phone.\n\nOption 2, Barcelona to Bordeaux via San Sebastian - how about lunch in San Sebastian?\n\nThis route takes longer, but is usually cheaper. And I'd be tempted to go this way with a stop for lunch and a wander (or an overnight stop) in the lovely city of San Sebastian!\n\nStep 1, take an Alvia train from Barcelona Sants to San Sebastian Renfe station, journey time around 5h46.\n\nIf you take a morning train you can reach Bordeaux the same day, and could easily fit in a stop in San Sebastian for lunch and a look round. If you take the direct afternoon Alvia train you'll need to overnight in San Sebastian. See the Barcelona-San Sebastian section above.\n\nFares start at 28 in Standard class or 38 in Comfort class. Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBuy a ticket at www.thetrainline.com or www.raileurope.com. Booking normally opens 60 days ahead, but this varies. You print your ticket.\n\nIn San Sebastian it's an easy 10-minute walk from the Renfe station to Amara station, see walking route.\n\nStep 2, take the little Euskotren from San Sebastian Amara to Hendaye, trains leave every 30 minutes through the day, journey time 37 minutes, fare 2.75, no reservation necessary or possible, it's a metro, you just turn up, buy a ticket with cash or card and hop on.\n\nStep 3, take a train from Hendaye to Bordeaux, trains leave regularly through the day, journey time 2h40.\n\nSome departures are TER regional trains, some are TGV. TER trains have a fixed price of around 38.40 which you can buy at the station on the day, it cannot sell out. TGVs require reservation and have dynamic pricing starting from 20.\n\nCheck times and buy online at www.thetrainline.com or www.raileurope.com (both easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee) or the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee). You print your own ticket or can show a mobile ticket on your phone.\n\nOption 3, Barcelona to Bordeaux via Latour de Carol\n\nStep 1, take the slow but cheap & scenic route from Barcelona Sants to Toulouse Matabiau via Latour de Carol as shown as option 2 in the Barcelona-Toulouse section below. This involves local trains with no reservation required (or even possible) and fixed (cheap!) prices, so is good if you have to travel at short notice when TGVs are expensive or if you have a Eurail or Interrail pass and want to avoid hefty TGV passholder reservation fees.\n\nStep 2, then take an Intercité from Toulouse to Bordeaux St Jean taking around 2h07 with fares from 15 upwards. Reservation is required for this bit, and prices are dynamic, cheaper if you book ahead, more expensive (over 40) bought on the day.\n\nBarcelona to Toulouse & Carcassonne\n\nOption 1, Barcelona to Toulouse via Narbonne - the high-speed option, reservation required, dynamic pricing so book ahead.\n\nThere are two departures every day from Barcelona to Carcassonne & Toulouse with 1 easy change of train at Narbonne:\n\nLeave Barcelona Sants at 09:28, change Narbonne, arrive Carcassonne 12:29 & Toulouse Matabiau at 12:17. Arrival times may vary.\n\nLeave Barcelona Sants at 13:25, change Narbonne, arrive Carcassonne 16:32 & Toulouse Matabiau at 17:20. Arrival times may vary.\n\nThe TGV Duplex has a cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi, you'll get great views of the imposing 2,784m Mt Canigou as the train rounds the southern end of the Pyrenees, you'll pass the historic Fort de Salses right by the tracks just after Perpignan.\n\nFares start at 29 in 2nd class or 49 in 1st class. Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nCheck times and buy tickets at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com (both sites easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee) or the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee).\n\nBooking opens up to 4 months ahead. You print your own ticket or can show a mobile ticket on your phone.\n\nOption 2, Barcelona to Toulouse via Latour de Carol - through the Pyrenees, slower, cheaper, always 12 + 28.10 any day, any date.\n\nAlternatively, there's a cheap & scenic option from Barcelona to Toulouse taking the slow but direct route through the Pyrenees via Latour de Carol, no pre-booking necessary and if you don't want to book in advance it's much cheaper than the high-speed route. It cannot sell out and you can even buy tickets on the day at the same price.\n\nYou won't find this route listed on train booking websites because it involves two separate trains and two separate tickets, one of which is classed as a Spanish suburban train to cannot even be booked online, you just buy a ticket on the day at the station. But it's easy to check times and use it, buying tickets on the day at the station. Here's how...\n\nStep 1, travel from Barcelona Sants to Latour de Carol (Tor de Querol in Catalan) by local train, these leave every couple of hours, journey time 3h05, fare 12, buy at the station from the staffed counter or self-service ticket machines, no advance booking necessary or possible. This is a fixed-price open ticket which cannot sell out. Easy!\n\nYou will not find this train on normal journey planners, so read this paragraph carefully!!!! To check times for this train. use the special Barcelona suburban train website rodalies.gencat.cat/en/inici. Alternatively, you can use www.renfe.com but ignore the main journey planner. Click Welcome at the top for English, then COMMUTER TRAINS AND FEVE then select Barcelona as this train is classed as a Barcelona suburban route. Then search for Barcelona Sants to Tor de Querol.\n\nIf there's a wait between trains at Latour de Carol - as there usually is, the French and Spanish don't co-ordinate timetables - simply enjoy lunch, coffee or a beer at the station bistro, www.facebook.com/bistrotdutrainjaune.\n\nStep 2, then take a local TER train from Latour de Carol to Toulouse for a fixed-price 28.10 bought at Latour de Carol station, journey time 2h56. These leave every few hours, you can check times for this leg at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com.\n\nThis journey is also very scenic, as the train negotiates the Pyrenees for the first hour. At Porté-Puymorens (the last station just before Latour) the train reaches the highest point on any normal standard-gauge railway in Europe, 1,562m (5,125 feet) above sea level. Look out for the castle at Foix on the left.\n\nBarcelona to Avignon, Marseille, Cannes & Nice\n\nOption 1, Barcelona to Avignon, Aix-en-Provence & Marseille by direct AVE train - the easiest option for these 3 cities, recommended\n\nStep 1, travel from Barcelona to Avignon & Marseille by direct AVE high-speed train, leaving Barcelona Sants at 16:34 and arriving Avignon TGV 20:43, Aix-en-Provence TGV 21:08 & Marseille St Charles at 21:23.\n\nThis comfortable Spanish high-speed train has a cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.

Until further notice, all direct Paris-Lyon-Milan trains are cancelled. Please use alternative routes, for example options 3 or 4. More information.\n\nStay overnight in either Turin or Milan.\n\nPersonally I'd choose Turin, a lovely city even if you're not a fan of the 1969 Michael Caine film The Italian Job which was set there. I'd allow some time for a look around next morning.\n\nIn Turin I suggest the Hotel Torino Porta Susa or Hotel Diplomatic, Best Quality Hotel Dock Milano or small Al Porta Susa B&B, all right next to Turin Porta Susa station where the TGV arrives and where your onward train leaves next morning, with good or great reviews. Alternatively, the excellent Turin Palace Hotel is in the centre right next to Porta Nuova station, a 7 minute taxi ride, 3-stop 1.50 metro ride or 20 minute walk from Porta Susa, but next morning you can board your train to Venice, Florence, Rome or Naples at Porta Nuova station where these trains start their journey.\n\nIn Milan, hotels near Milan Centrale with good or great reviews include Made to Measure Business, 43 Station Hotel, Starhotel Echo or Starhotel Anderson.\n\nDay 2, take a morning train to anywhere in Italy.\n\nFor Florence, Rome or Naples take a 300 km/h (186 mph) Frecciarossa train from Turin Porta Nuova, Turin Porta Susa or Milan Centrale to Florence SMN from 19.90, to Rome Termini or Naples Centrale from 29.90. There are regular departures throughout the day, Turin-Florence takes 2h48, Milan-Florence takes 1h40, Turin-Rome 3h55, Milan-Rome 2h55.\n\nFor Verona or Venice take a 186mph Frecciarossa high-speed train from Turin Porta Nuova, Turin Porta Susa or Milan Centrale to Verona Porta Nuova or Venice Santa Lucia. Milan to Venice takes 2h35 from 19.90. Turin to Venice takes 3h25 from 19.90. It's easier to change in Turin as that's a same-station change. In Milan, a transfer from Porta Garibaldi to Centrale is a 25 minute walk or 8 8-minute taxi ride.\n\nFor Cinque Terre take a train from Milan Centrale to Monterosso, some direct in as little as 2h57 from 19.90, or there are other departures involving a change. There are also trains from Milan Centrale to Genoa (1h32) and Pisa (3h47).\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nThe easiest way to buy tickets is to use either www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com, as you can buy all the tickets together in one place, in plain English, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee.
