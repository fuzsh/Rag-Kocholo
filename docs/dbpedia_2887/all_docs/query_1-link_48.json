        "text": "The two stations are in fact one, but the platforms are separated by an enormous building that used to be for passport and customs checks.\n\nI travelled on a through ticket so can't say - would have thought it probable rather than only a machine.\n\nAccording to the Rodalies website there are penalty fares, if I understand its rather poor English - puzzling, because I recall there being unstaffed halts near Port Bou, so there must be a conductor. http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/rodalies?newLang=en_GB\n\nOthers on here are better informed about Spain....wait for them to reply!\n\nI've no idea how punctual the sleeper is, but if you miss the connection you'll have a 2-hour wait and Port Bou isn't a hive of activity!\n\nIf it's not too late to suggest it, you could consider travelling on the La Tour de Carol portion of the same train, which has a more comfortable connection (and definitely pay on train, according to Seat61) and is spectacular scenery (though the Cote Vermeille bit is pretty good too).\n\nI've changed the tickets to Latour de Carol - the db site seems to suggest that the train to Barcelona goes from Latour de Carol but we'll arrive from Paris at Latour de Carol Enveitg and there's a 2.4km walk between the 2.\n\nDoes that sound right?\n\nI haven't been there but I think it's the same station at Latour.\n\nThis is the one where 3 gauges meet.\n\nThe RENFE timetable shows the connection departs from Enveitg/Envieg.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gare_de_Latour-de-Carol-Enveitg\n\nhttp://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/cercanias/barcelona/index.html\n\nI've changed the tickets to Latour de Carol - the db site seems to suggest that the train to Barcelona goes from Latour de Carol but we'll arrive from Paris at Latour de Carol Enveitg and there's a 2.4km walk between the 2.\n\nDoes that sound right?\n\nI can't get the DB site to mention a walk, only a connection time of 19 minutes, which is rather OTT. I think the station layout has been simplified since I was last there in 1980...\n\nSee the video on Seat 61 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aovJfBv62aQ\n\nBTW note that you CAN'T buy the Spanish ticket at La Tour de Carol-Enveitg station only on the train.\n\nWell-your plans have changed. But as for the original Q; one MUST buy tickets advance=at window if there is one and it is staffed-there may even be barriers now. But my last transit in PB was quite long ago-there certainly was a normal booking window then-also for the long distance trains and a very long Q of people. the SNCF was then also late on arrival as they made a thorough customs/passpt check in the last FR stop at Cerbere. I saw 2 USAers being dragged off that train as they had overstayed their Schengen-area permits. Anyway-then there also was a nice cafe for a continental breakfast and the long wait was quite amicable.\n\nLOcal fares at cercanias level are much cheaper as the normal sold outside INTernational SCIC fares.\n\nA similar situation-but the other way as for LTdC is at Ventimiglia, toward FR, where tix for the SNCF are also not sold by FS. In Basel SBB sells them (there used to be long time ago separate SNCF windows behind their ''border'').\n\nI attempted to make this connection last August. The night train was held at Cerbère for about 15-20 minutes for a check for the French policy and I missed the onward connection by a couple of minutes or so. French Intercités de nuit trains tend to be punctual, so I'd imagine that this connection is often possible. All the Catalan regional trains (and Media Distancia trains) have guards who sell tickets, but suburban trains have no guards and you have to buy a ticket before you board. I spoke to the guard about this on the regional train to Barcelona. R11 - R15 services are regional trains, R-single numbers are suburban trains. More comfortable Media Distancia units are also sometimes used on regional services. Portbou has a ticket office between the French-gauge platform and the most easterly of the Spanish-gauge platforms. You will probably have to use the underpass to get to the train to Barcelona. In future, I would recommend travelling via Latour-de-Carol on the outbound journey (or, if money is not important, the TGV from Perpignan at 10:07). Thus you will know that you will be in Barcelona around 11:30, rather than possibly 11:00 or possibly 13:00. The journey via Latour-de-Carol is also much more scenic than via Portbou (only the Portbou - Figueres section is of any interest).\n\n... In future, I would recommend travelling via Latour-de-Carol on the outbound journey....\n\nLuckily even the cheaper sleeper ticket fares to that part of France seem to be refundable so I have bought some more to Latour de Carol and I'll get a refund for the others.\n\nHaving looked closer at the area and this better route, I've now decided it would be nice to stop off in the mountains (somewhere not far from the Latour to Barcelona rail line) for the night before proceeding on to Barcelona. Anyone any thoughts on places to stay - a mountain retreat type hotel would be ideal?\n\nsorry if I'm seem to be hi jacking this thread.\n\nI'm planning a rail trip around Spain involving travelling through La Tour ,going onto Barcelona and then Madrid in the second half of June.\n\nI plan to continue from Madrid to Salamanca and then onto Bilbao and San Sebastien and returning on the night sleeper from Hendaye.\n\nThe Renfe site does not seem to show (Non high speed) train times from Madrid any later than 14th June. Does anyone know when they are likely to appear.\n\ndoes anyone have experience of travelling between Bilbao and San Sebastien.\n\nFrom what I can see there is a bus service which takes about 1 Hr. and the rail service seems to take about 2.5Hrs. Is this correct?\n\nsorry if I'm seem to be hi jacking this thread.\n\nI'm planning a rail trip around Spain involving travelling through La Tour ,going onto Barcelona and then Madrid in the second half of June.\n\nI plan to continue from Madrid to Salamanca and then onto Bilbao and San Sebastien and returning on the night sleeper from Hendaye.\n\nThe Renfe site does not seem to show (Non high speed) train times from Madrid any later than 14th June.

Is this correct?\n\nUsing the RENFE site can be very misleading. It will never show a service between two points if a change is required. Also, the services are divided into different types, high speed, long distance, regional, local, with different names for different services in different areas. High speed is AVE, Avant, Alvia etc., normally on the standard gauge high speed lines but do operate some services on broad gauge. Services from Madrid to the north will change gauge at Valladolid if you have a 130/730 Talgo set OR you may have to change trains, I'm not sure which high speed lines north of Valladolid have been opened and how far they extend. Larga distancia is long distance, Media distancia is middle distance. Cercanías is local services, which stop at many or all stations, and radiate out from Main centres such as Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. These are relatively slow but very cheap. I'm not familiar with services in the northern area as I live in the South-east.\n\ndoes anyone have experience of travelling between Bilbao and San Sebastien.\n\nFrom what I can see there is a bus service which takes about 1 Hr. and the rail service seems to take about 2.5Hrs. Is this correct?\n\nThe rail service is on Euskotren's narrow gauge system.\n\nTheir site is in impenetrable Basque and I haven't found an English version.\n\nhttp://www.euskotren.es/sites/www2.euskotren.es/files/G10 Bilbao-Donostia (0214).pdf\n\nThe bus is on http://www.alsa.es which is in English.\n\nAll this is from the European Rail Timetable.\n\nI'm also going to the area in September, but no first-hand experience yet."
