        "text": "Maçanet-Massanes is a Rodalies de Catalunya open triangular railway station serving Maçanet de la Selva and Massanes, in Catalonia, Spain. It is located at the junction where the railway coming from Barcelona via Mataró converges with the Barcelona–Cerbère railway, lying about 5 and 1.9 kilometres (3.1 and 1.2 mi) away from the urban centers of Maçanet de la Selva and Massanes, respectively.[8] On the Barcelona–Cerbère railway, the station is between Hostalric and Sils, and it is the northern terminus of the railway coming from Mataró.\n\nQuick Facts General information, Location ...\n\nClose\n\nThe station serves as the northern terminus of Barcelona commuter rail service lines R1 and R2 Nord as well as a stop for all trains on regional line R11. On 24 March 2014 ( ), Girona commuter rail service line RG1 also started services, providing a direct connection between the Maresme and the Girona areas without having to interchange at this station.[9]\n\nUnder the name \"Riera de Santa Coloma\", the station was first opened on 27 August 1860 ( ) with the construction of the Barcelona–Portbou Railway on its section from Granollers to this location, which was carried out by Compañía del Camino de Hierro del Norte (\"Northern Railway Company\"). One year later, on 1 August 1861 ( ), Camino de Hierro del Este (\"Eastern Railway\") opened the extension of the Barcelona–Mataró Railway from Arenys de Mar to the already existing station, leading to the connection of both railways.[10]"
