        "text": "Cerbère SNCF - Port-Bou RENFE\n\n[E*] Lines of both gauges (1435 mm and 1668 mm) cross the border. Until February 2019, advertised passenger carrying trains normally ran only from France to Port-Bou, whilst those from Spain normally ran only to Cerbère, i.e. trains ran empty in the opposite directions. However, since February 2019, passengers have been permitted to travel on these trains in both directions.\n\nMost freight trains change bogies at Cerbère. RENFE 3000 V dc trains operate at reduced power under 1500 V dc catenary in the border areas.\n\nPerpignan SNCF - Figueres Vilafant RENFE\n\n[E] This is part of a high speed line, built to standard gauge and electrified at 25KV 50Hz, linking Barcelona with the French LGV network.\n\nStandard gauge freight trains are able to reach Barcelona by use of the high speed line between as far as Mollet del Vallès and thence a dual-gauge line into the industrial and port area to the west of Barcelona. RENFE operates freight at least as far north as Perpignan St Charles.\n\nLa Tour de Carol-Enveitg SNCF - Puigcerdà RENFE\n\n[E*] Lines of both 1668 mm and 1435 mm gauge cross the border. The 1435 mm gauge track is unusable and probably originated from the principle of reciprocity, carrying little or no traffic during its lifetime.\n\n(Oloron -) Forges-d'Abel SNCF - Canfranc RENFE\n\n[ED] Line closed. The break of gauge was at Canfranc.\n\nIn December 2017 the EU agreed to co-fund a study into the reopening of this line. A meeting was held in Dec 2019 between the president of Nouvelle Aquitaine and officials from Aragón to move matters forward.\n\nHendaye/Hendaia ET/FV- Irún/Irun Paseo de Colon ET/FV\n\n[E] This border crossing is the upstream bridge of the two railway bridges over the Bidasoa river. It carries the metre gauge railway operated by Euskotren, which terminates at their own Hendaia station, outside the SNCF Hendaye station.\n\nHendaye/Hendaia SNCF - Irún/Irun RENFE\n\n[E*] This border crossing is the downstream bridge of the two railway bridges over the Bidasoa river. It carries a 1668mm gauge track on the downstream side and a 1435mm gauge track on the upstream side.\n\nIt no longer carries any passenger services. In the past, 1668 mm gauge RENFE trains ran in passenger service to Hendaye and 1435 mm gauge SNCF trains ran in passenger service to Irún. The trains ran empty in the opposite direction. However, from December 2017 the new SNCF double deck TGVs were not authorised to run on ADIF lines so the only cross-border passenger movements were RENFE services to Hendaye. It is not known when local services ceased but later the only cross-border services were an arrival from A Coruña and the Sud Express to and from Lisboa Santa Apolonia, which ceased running on 17 March 2020, leaving the line with no passenger service.\n\nMost freight trains change bogies at Hendaye. RENFE 3000 V dc trains operate at reduced power under 1500 V dc catenary in the border areas.\n\nContracts have been awarded to install mixed-gauge track between Irún and Astigarraga (south of San Sebastián/Donostia), the end point of the 'Basque Y' high speed line, to enable standard gauge freights to access the Basque high speed line. Completion was planned to be in 2024 but this seems most unlikely.\n\nSee also"
