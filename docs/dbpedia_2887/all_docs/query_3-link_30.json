        "text": "Route Options, Barcelona to Italy\n\nThere are high-speed routes that make it possible to complete this journey within a day, but we decided to stick to the local \"regional\" trains and spread the journey over two days. (If you have time on your hands, you could easily stretch it over three or four days, because there's so much to see en route.\n\nAs usual, we had our Brompton bikes with us, which we pressed into action for a couple of stretches of the route. But you don't need bikes on this route: all the train rides join up.\n\nSo, here's how to travel by train all the way from Barcelona to Genoa (or Genova, to use its proper Italian name), via Portbou, Narbonne, Avignon, Marseille, Nice, Monaco and Ventimiglia.\n\nStep 1: from Barcelona to Portbou\n\nFrom Barcelona Sants, a dozen Rodalies de Catalunya trains run daily via Girona and Figueres to Portbou.\n\nThe earliest train leaves Barcelona at 06:16, with the last train of the day leaving at 19:16.\n\nInterrail passes are accepted — but beware: you might have trouble getting through the automatic ticket barriers at Barcelona Sants, because they don't recognise Interrail QR codes. Head for one of the staffed ticket windows; show them your Interrail pass and they can give you a free ticket that will operate the barriers.\n\nIf you don't have an Interrail pass, a ticket to Portbou will cost you €13.50 on a Regional (\"R\") train, or €18.10 on the slightly faster Media Distancia (\"MD\") trains. Journey times are about 2 hours 15 minutes on the MD trains, 2 hours 45 minutes on the R11 trains, and 3 hours 15 minutes on the R11 trains, which take the slower coastal route via Mataró and Blanes .\n\nStep 2: Portbou to Cerbère, Narbonne and Avignon\n\nWhen you get to Portbou, you have two, or sometimes three options.\n\nOption 1: Stay on the train straight through to Cerbère\n\nSome (but not all) R11 regional trains continue across the border from Portbou and into France, terminating at Cerbère.\n\nAll Media Distancia and R1 regional trains to Portbou terminate there, so if you're on one of these, you'll have to pick option 2 or option 3.\n\nOption 2: Take some time to explore Portbou, and then catch a connecting train through to France\n\nWe really recommend this.\n\nPortbou is such a fascinating place, it's a pity to miss it.\n\nIt's worth taking 15 minutes just to take in the station itself — an enormous, grand station and train shed serving what is now something of an end-of-the-line third-string railway, but which in its heyday was a major international crossing point between France and Spain.\n\nThere's more information on our separate Portbou and Cerbère page.\n\nHeading onwards to France from Portbou, both RENFE and SNCF run trains across the border through the Col de Belitres tunnel to Cerbère, the first French station. Trains run approximately hourly.\n\nSpanish RENFE trains won't go any further than Cerbère, so you'll have to change again there — but this gives you the opportunity to explore Cerbère, perhaps find something to eat or (if it's a hot day) have a swim on the beach.\n\nFrench SNCF TER (regional) trains will likely be heading further, so you can ride direct from Portbou at least as far as Perpignan or Narbonne, and, on a weekday, if you're lucky, straight through to Avignon. (At weekends you'll probably have to change at Narbonne for Avignon.)\n\nInterrail passes are accepted, and no reservations are required on these regional trains.\n\nIf you don't have Interrail, a Portbou to Avignon ticket will set you back €45.70 in second class for the 4 hour 30 minute trip.\n\nOption 3: As above, but walk or cycle over the border from Portbou to Cerbère, and catch an onward train from there\n\nThis is our favourite route: unfold the Bromptons at Portbou, head down to the beach for a quick swim if it's a hot day, and then pedal over the Col de Belitres.\n\nThere are ful details of the cycling route, and also the walking route, on the France to Spain by Train and Bike page.\n\nIt's about a 45 minute cycle-ride or an hour's walk, allowing time for a few photo-stops along the way."
