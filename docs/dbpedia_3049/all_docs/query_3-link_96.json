        "text": "Albert as Prince (colourised portrait) and as King during the First World War. Source: https://www.warhistoryonline.com/\n\nThe Curious Case of the Changing Label\n\nWe continue with Belgium and the now BENELUX countries and two of the most repsected European Monarchs of the 20th Century. Firstly, King Albert I of the Belgians. A hero of the First World War. How different the Second World War would have been if only he hadn't died in a mountaineering accident...\n\n​Albert Léopold Clément Marie Meinrad (8th April 1875 – 17th February 1934) was famously King of the Belgians during the First World War. Popularly known as the \"Knight King\" (roi-chevalier or koning-ridder) or \"Soldier King\" (roi-soldat or koning-soldaat), Albert assumed leadership of the Belgian army at the outset of the War and made continual visits to the front-line trenches from his headquarters at De Panne on the Belgian coast.\n\nFor 15 years after the War, Albert worked hard to rebuild his country but was killed in a mountaineering accident near Namur in eastern Belgium at the age of 58.\n\nWhat may not be known is that, just like his namesake grandson King Albert II, Albert I was a second son who came to Throne because of the death of his elder brother... Baudouin. Their father, Philippe, Count of Flanders, was also a second son.\n\nPrince Philippe of Belgium, Count of Flanders (24th March 1837 – 17th November 1905) was the third born and second surviving son of Leopold I, King of the Belgians. Born at the Château de Laeken, near Brussels, Belgium, he was created Count of Flanders on 14th December 1840. He was offered and refused both the Crowns of Romania and Greece.\n\nIn 1869, Philippe's nephew and Heir to the Throne, Leopold, Duke of Brabant, second child and only son of King Leopold II, died at the age of 9 from pneumonia, after falling into a pond. Leopold II and Queen Marie Henriette tried for another baby boy, but after the birth of yet another daughter, Clémentine, in 1872, the couple abandoned all hopes and their already strained marriage broke down completely. The King's brother Philippe therefore became Heir Presumptive. He did not change his title, though, and remained Count of Flanders.\n\nPhilippe had been assigned a plain red three-pointed Label. The official date given for the Label is 1880 (a Royal Decree was issued on 13th July that year) but the belief is that it was assigned sometime before 1869, i.e. the birth of his first son, Baudouin.\n\nBaudouin (3rd June 1869 – 23rd January 1891) was born six months after his cousin's untimely death which made him second in line to the Throne after his father and was thus groomed to eventually succeed as king. However, Baudouin tragically died of influenza in the Palace of the Count of Flanders a day after the anniversary of his cousin Leopold's death.\n\n​Baudouin had been assigned a red Label like his father's but with a golden Annulet or ring on the centre Point. Again the year 1880 is cited but no further details are given.\n\nPrince Albert appears to have been assigned a red Label with a central white Crescent either at birth or before 1879. (In English heraldry at least, a Crescent is the mark of Cadency for a second son, but that might just be pure coincidence.) Strangely enough, possibly mirroring the system in the German Empire, Albert was not born a Prince of Belgium, he remained a Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha until his elder brother's death and, nearly two months later, was created a Prince of Belgium. This remained the situation until the next family tragedy occured in 1905: The Count of Flanders, Albert's father, died of major respiratory difficulties. Philippe's health had been in decline since the death of his elder son and he had missed the 75th anniversary celebrations of Belgian Independence. His relationship with his brother had deteriorated to the point of being non-existent.\n\nAlbert now became Heir to the Throne of the Belgians (Heir Apparent in all but name) and allegedly took on his father's title and his plain Label, although there isn't any confirmed proof of that. Leopold II was looked on as aloof and autocratic and his private life to be particularly irregular, especially compared to the pious Albert, and did not help his nephew to prepare for kingship. Albert therefore read extensively, almost to the point of exhaustion.\n\nWhen Leopold II died in 1909, Albert became King. He, of course, dropped any Labels from his Coat of Arms and would also drop the dynastic Inescutcheon of his German Saxe-Coburg and Gotha family after the First World War which the present King has taken up. He granted his second son, Charles, his and his father's title of Count of Flanders but Charles was assigned a yellow Border of difference rather than a Label.\n\n​\n\nUPDATE: ​Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands\n\nFollowing my Blog, I have recently been informed by the Supreme Council of Nobility in The Hague that, whilst the mechanics existed to provide for a Coat of Arms for Queen Wilhelmina post Abdication when she reverted to being a princess, there appears to be no evidence of a decree specifying what those Arms might have been.\n\n​Neither does there appear to be concrete evidence of usage post Abdication. For instance, Stall Plates and Banners, such as those for the Order of the Garter in St George's Chapel Windsor, are no help as they do not change. Neither Queen Juliana's nor Queen Beatrix's Banner changed when they abdicated even though their Arms did. Their Arms, though, were fully documented whereas Wilhelmina's appear not to be. She could not revert to her Arms prior to her Ascension to the Dutch Throne as she herself as Queen changed the Arms in 1907 consequent to her marriage, as outlined in another previous Blog.\n\nWilhelmina's Arms after her Abdication will probably remain a mystery, unless anyone else knows any differently...\n\nTheir Majesties King Baudouin and Queen Fabiola of the Belgians on their Wedding Day, Thursday 15th December 1960. Source: https://crossoflaeken.blogspot.com/\n\nThis coming week, on 15th December to be exact, will see what would have been the Diamond Wedding Anniversary of King Baudouin and Queen Fabiola of the Belgians. Married back in 1960, they were known as the devout couple. Fabiola is said to have taught a 'sad king' how to smile.\n\nIt is said that Cardinal Suenens introduced Baudouin to Irish mystic Sister Veronica O’Brien in March 1960, who addressed him as Mister King on their first meeting. After a long conversation and, some say, a nocturnal vision of the Virgin Mary, Sister Veronica left for Madrid, where she met the papal nuncio Monsignor Antoniutti. He, in turn, sent the Sister to the principal of a girls' school, who then referred her to Fabiola de Mora y Aragon, a Spanish noblewoman whose godmother was Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain. On their first meeting, Sister Veronica is said to have seen a picture in Fabiola’s apartment which she had dreamt of the night before. The devout Sister saw this as an omen and tried to persuade the young noblewoman to accept the King’s hand. But Fabiola kindly explained that she had her roots in Spain and was not interested in a marriage with the Belgian King.\n\nSister Veronica didn’t give in and is said to have eventually arranged for Fabiola to meet the King after an intervention by the papal nuncio. They met in Sister Veronica’s apartment in Brussels and a second time in Lourdes, France, at the beginning of July 1960. Baudouin and Fabiola spent their time talking, praying and walking along the streets of the little town. Three days after their arrival, they were driving to Tarbes, when Fabiola suddenly asked Baudouin to park the car along the side of the road where they prayed together, after which Fabiola turned to the King and said “Now it’s yes, and I will not look back anymore.” The shy Baudouin is said not even to have proposed.\n\nThe above stories, however, may be taken with a pinch of salt as they come from Cardinal Suenens. Fabiola kept quiet on the matter apart from saying that she refused Baudouin's proposals for a year. Even then, though, the proposal-not-a-proposal at the side of the road near Lourdes is apparently confirmed in Baudouin's diaries.\n\nThe Belgian Royal Coat of Arms has been dealt with in a previous Blog. Fabiola's Arms would appear to have come from both her parents as her maiden name is made up of de Mora from her father and y Aragon from her mother, in the traditional Spanish way. The second and third Quarters of Fabiola's Arms are certainly Aragon. The Inescutcheon would presumably be for Fabiola's father's title which was Marqués de Casa Riera.\n\nQueen Fabiola is famous for eschewing orders and her list of honours is, relatively speaking, very short. Although invested with her adopted country's highest honour, the Order of Leopold, she never wore the Sash and Star. In fact, the only real sighting of her wearing anything of the sort was in 1971 when she attended the lavish celebrations for the 2500 years of the Persian Empire in Iran when she, amongst a host of royalty, wore the commemorative medal. Otherwise, her few orders were largely religious and Catholic and her Arms did not include the Chain of the Order of Leopold or any order. Having said that, to be fair, no member of the Belgian Royal Family, except for the Monarch, shows the Chain of any order encircling their Shield(s), except for on the Stall Plates of foreign orders abroad.\n\nQueen Fabiola of the Belgians and the then Princess Sofia of Spain attending the Reception for the 2500 Year Celebrations of The Persian Empire.
