        "text": "July 16, 1951- Leopold III abdicates the throne in favor of his eldest son.\n\nLeopold, the son of Albert I and Elizabeth, Duchess in Bavaria, had come to the throne February 17, 1934.\n\nFollowing the end of WWII there had been great dissent over his return to Belgium. His actions during the war were seen by some as treason. A regency had been created in 1944 under his brother Prince Charles. While he was found innocent of treason and allowed to return, he faced a massive general strike in 1950 and August 1 decided to abdicate in favor of his eldest son. Leopold and his second wife Lillian would serve as advisors to his son until he married.\n\nThe nearly 21 year old Baudouin was the son of Leopold by his first wife Princess Astrid of Sweden. In 1960 he would marry Doña Fabiola de Mora y Aragón. Sadly though there was five pregnancies, they all ended in miscarriage.\n\nHe would reign for 42 years before dying of heart failure in 1993. He was succeeded by his brother Albert as Albert II. Albert and his wife Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria would abdicate themselves in 2013.\n\nLeopold died ten years before his son in 1983 and was buried next to Astrid. His second wife Lilian 2002 and was buried with him. Of his six children, 3 with each wife, 3 have passed away. Baudouin in 1993, Josephine-Charlotte in 2005 and Alexander in 2009.\n\nHis temporary successor in 1944, his brother Charles died the same year as he did, June 1, 1983 only months before Leopold.\n\nAugust 29, 1935 death of Queen Astrid of Belgium, first wife of Leopold III.\n\nAstrid was born in Stockholm. Her father Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland was the third son of Oscar II of Sweden. Her mother Ingeborg was a daughter of Frederick VIII of Denmark. Her Uncles included Christian X of Denmark, Haakon VII of Norway and Gustaf V of Sweden. Her sister Martha married the future King Harald V of Norway. Her sister Margaretha made a love match marriage to Prince Axel of Denmark. Her only brother Carl lost his dynastic rights due to his morganatic marriage.\n\nAstrid was married to Leopold (at the time Duke of Brabant) November 1926 with the civil in Stockholm and the religious in Brussels . Among her gifts was a tiara from the people of Stockholm.\n\nhttps://www.tiara-mania.com/2014/08/stockholm-tiara.html\n\nAstrid was loved by the people of her new country (and her old). Her devotion to helping the poor and disadvantaged, with a lot of interest in women and children, won her many fans. Her husband was one of the biggest, their marriage truly one of love. They were known to show PDA like holding hands at public events (not common like today's royals).\n\nAstrid sadly died at 29 (30th birthday was in November). Her and her husband had been on holiday in Switzerland with their two oldest children. Her youngest Albert was left at home as he was only a year old at the time. The king and queen were in a car accident when they were on their way for a final hike on their vacation. Both were thrown from the car but the queen slammed into a tree and died before help came, in her husband's arms.\n\nHer death was mourned greatly both in Belgium and by Sweden as well. She was buried at the Church of our Lady of Laeken where her husband was later buried (and his second wife). A chapel was built at the site of her death.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_of_Sweden#/media/File:Astridkapelle.jpg\n\nShe was the mother of three, her oldest Josephine-Charlotte was only eight at the time of her mother's death. Baudouin was 5 and Albert one. In 2020 she currently has 1 living child (Albert II, JC died in 2005 and Baudouin died in 1993), 9 grandchildren (5 from JC and 4 from Albert), 36 great grandchildren (22 from JC and 14 from Albert) and 19 great-great grandchildren (17 from JC and 2 from Albert).\n\nShe is the grandmother of GD Henri of Luxembourg and King Philippe of Belgium. And Aunt of Harald of Norway.\n\nSeptember 27, 1275 the birth of John II, Duke of Brabant. He was known as the peaceful.\n\nHe was the son of John the Victorious, Duke of Brabant who was venerated as a folk hero, the perfect example of a chivalric prince. His mother was Margaret of Flanders, daughter of Guy of Dampierre, Count of Flanders. John was the second of four children. His elder brother Godfrey died though in 1283 at 9. His sister Margaret married Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor with whom she had three children including Marie of France (wife of Charles IV). His sister Maria married Amadeus V, Count of Savoy as his second wife and bore him 4 daughters.\n\nJohn succeeded his father as Duke in 1294. He worked to help support a fight against French expansion.\n\nIn 1309 the Crusade of the Poor came into the borders of Brabant. It was a group of poor men who had assembled a militia of sorts from France, England, Germany and Brabant. Along their way to join the Papal army they started looting, getting into conflict with local authorities and persecuting Jews. Over 100 Jews had been massacred by the 'brothers of the cross' when they had tried to seek refuge in the castle of Born in Guelders.\n\nThe Jews of Leuven and Tienan sought sanctuary after the massacre in Guelders. They sought refuge in the castle of Genappe. John sent his troops to Genappe to drive the crusaders away from the castle, to protect the Jews who he believed he owed protection to in his lands. The crusaders suffered heavy casualties at the hands of John's troops.\n\nIn 1312 John signed the Charter of Kortenberg in an attempt to secure a peaceful transition to his son. A charter of rights like the Magna Carta, it was far more democratic, giving rights not simply to the Barons like in England.\n\nHe died October 27 of that years in Tervuren. He had been suffering from kidney stones for some time. He was buried at St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral in Brussels.\n\nJohn had been married in July 1290 at the age of 15 to Margaret of England. Margaret was the daughter of Edward I and Eleanor of Castile. Among her full siblings were Edward II and Joan of Acre. They were married in London at Westminster. Margaret was a few months older then her husband. They attended the wedding of Edward II and Isabella, and later the coronation of the couple. His wife bore him only one child, a son.\n\n-John: would succeed his father as John III. He married Marie d'Évreux with whom he had six children. He was succeeded by his eldest daughter Joanna.\n\nHe had at least four known bastards. The House of Glyme was founded by one of these bastards, Jan Cordeken. He was legitimized by emperor Louis IV. They held quite a few positions of power over time.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Glyme\n\nMargaret out lived her husband by 22 years. She was the last surviving and longest surviving child of her father. She died during the reign of her nephew Edward III.\n\nNovember 23, 1965 death of Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Belgium.\n\nShe was born in Possenhofen Castle in Bavaria. Her father was Karl-Theodor, Duke in Bavaria. Her father was the younger brother of Empress Sissi. He named his daughter after his Imperial sister. Her father as well as being a royal, actually practiced medicine as an ophthalmologist. Her mother was Maria Josepha of Portugal, a daughter of Miguel I. Her mother was her father's second wife. He had originally been married to Sophie of Saxony with whom he had a daughter Duchess Amalia. Elisabeth was the second of five children born to her parents. As well as her half sister Amalia, she had 2 sisters and 2 brothers. Her younger sister married the Crown Prince of Bavaria.\n\nElisabeth grew up with a deep passion for art and music thanks to her father. But she also learned about the suffering of others. Like her mother, Elisabeth often helped her father out in her clinic and saw the suffering of others.\n\nOctober 2, 1900 she was married to Prince Albert of Belgium, who was at the time second in line to the throne. He was the grandson of Leopold I of Belgium. His father was Leopold's third son Philip, Count of Flanders (2nd to reach adulthood as his eldest brother died in infancy). At the time of their marriage, his Uncle Leopold II was on the throne (he had inherited it from his father in 1865). Though Leopold II and his wife Marie-Henrietta had four children, their only son Leopold had died in 1869 at age ten. In absence of a son, his heir was Albert's father Philip. Albert was the youngest of his parents five children, but his only brother had died on influenza in 1891. Albert's mother Princess Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmarion was a sister of King Carol I of Romania.\n\nHer husband became first in line for the throne on the death of his father in 1905. The couple ascended the Belgian throne in 1909 on the death of Leopold II. Elisabeth was far more active as queen then any of the queens before her. She became very involved with charity work and the arts.\n\nDuring WWI she helped found the Symphony Orchestra of the Field Army. She often brought messages to the British government from her husband under the guise of visiting her children who were at school in the UK. She and her husband stayed in De Panne during the war. She became well known and loved for visiting the front lines during the war, and sponsoring a nursing unit.\n\nShe was widowed February 17, 1934 when her husband died in a mountaineering accident. Her husband was succeeded by their eldest son who became Leopold III.\n\nElisabeth would live to see Leopold abdicate the throne, her younger son serve as regent for a time, and the ascension of her grandson to the throne.\n\nElisabeth is one of several royal women who was rewarded the honor of 'Righteous Among the Nations' by the state of Israel for her actions in WWII. She had used her position and German connections to prevent hundreds of Jewish children from being deported by the Nazis during the war.\n\nShe died at the age of 89 in Belgium from a heart attack. She was buried in the Church of Our lady of Laeken.\n\nShe and her husband had three children:\n\n-Leopold: succeeded his father as Leopold III. He was married twice. He married Princess Astrid of Sweden with whom he had three children: King Baudouin, King Albert II and Josephine Charlotte of Luxembourg. His second marriage was to Lilian Baels with whom he had a further three children: Alexandre, Marie-Christine, and Marie-Esmerelda.He abdicated in favor of his eldest son in 1951.\n\n-Charles: Count of Flanders like his grandfather. Served as regent of Belgium from 1944-1950. He had a natural daughter Isabelle and there was some speculation he was married but no evidence. He died several months before Leopold died.\n\n-Marie-Jose: Married Umberto II of Italy. Had three daughters and a son with Umberto. After being exiled from Italy in 1946 her and her husband separated though never divorced, Umberto living in Portugal and her in Switzerland."
