        "text": "The Nordic events such as ski jumping, cross-country skiing, Nordic combined and biathlon were held at the 1976 Winter Olympics in nearby Seefeld.\n\nIn winter as well as in summer still worth a visit!\n\nIn summer, a wonderful hiker’s paradise, start on a plateau at 1180 meters. A walk around the lake past the baroque Seekirchl from the 1600s. In winter a dream for skiing but especially nestled between the Wetterstein Mountains and the Karwendel famous for its cross-country ski trails, a paradise!\n\nLife and facts\n\nLeopold III King of Belgium was born on November 3, 1901 in Brussels, the descendant of Prince Albert of Belgium and Elisabeth Gabriele of Bavaria. Leopold attended the prestigious British private school Eton College and studied at St. Anthony’s Seminary in Santa Barbara, California, after the end of the First World War.\n\nAfter the death of his father Albert I. on February 17, 1934, he succeeded him on the throne as Leopold III. and took the oath to the Constitution on February 23.\n\nOn November 4, 1926, he married Princess Astrid of Sweden in Stockholm and had 3 children with her. In 1935, his wife lost her life in an unfortunate car accident during a vacation trip. Six years later he married his second wife Mary Lilian Baels. With her he also had three children.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Leopold III. remained in Belgium. Because of his passive attitude towards the German occupiers, the Belgian parliament appointed his younger brother Charles as his successor in 1944. He was popular and had good contacts with the Western Allies.\n\nLeopold remained in Switzerland until 1950 but returned after a referendum produced a majority in favor of his return.\n\nHowever, a year later he designated his son from his first marriage, Baudouin, as his successor after he reached the age of 21.\n\nLeopold died on September 25, 1983, in Sint-Lambrechts-Woluwe. He was buried in the royal crypt in Laeken, where his two wives also found their final resting place. Together with his first wife, he gave his name to the Leopold and Astrid Coast in Antarctica."
