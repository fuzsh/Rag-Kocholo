        "text": "KING LEOPOLD BADLY HURT\n\nCar Crashes Into Tree\n\nat Lucerne\n\nKING WAS DRIVING\n\nLUCERNE (Switzerland), August 29.\n\nThe Queen of the Belgians was killed this morning\n\nwhen a motor car in which she was driving crashed into\n\na tree.\n\nThe King of the Belgians, who was driving the\n\ncar, sustained cuts on the head, and, according to police\n\nreports, his injuries are Serious.\n\nKING LEOPOLD, owing to some\n\ncause which has not yet\n\nbeen explained, lost control of the\n\ncar while he was driving on the\n\nroad beside the lake at Kuss-\n\nnacht. The vehicle swerved into\n\na belt of trees alongside the lake,\n\nand the Queen, who was sharing\n\nthe front seat with the King, was\n\nkilled instantly.\n\nThe chauffeur, who was in the\n\nrear seat, escaped injury.\n\nAccording to another version of the\n\ntragedy the Queen (formerly Princess\n\nAstrid of Sweden) was alone in the\n\nback seat of the car at the time of\n\nthe occurrence, and she experienced\n\nthe full force of the impact with the\n\ntree.\n\nLater details suggest that the car\n\nhad not recovered its direction after it\n\nhad negotiated a sharp curve on a nar-\n\nrow road at the water's edge.\n\nKing Leopold and Queen Astrid had\n\nbeen spending a holiday of some\n\nweeks' duration in the Swiss and Ital-\n\nian Alps. They had just visited Dolo-\n\nmite Peak (in the Tyrol), where there\n\nis a tablet commemorating the late\n\nKing's Albert's feat in having ascended\n\nthe peak.\n\nnone Help\n\nKing Leopold.\n\nTheir Majesties had been staying at\n\na villa near Lucerne. After King Leo-\n\npold's wounds had been bandaged he\n\nwas taken back to the villa, to which\n\nplace the body of Queen Astrid was\n\nalso removed.\n\nSTORY OF EYE-WITNESS\n\nAn eye-witness states that the car\n\nwas travelling at 30 miles an hour,\n\nwhen it suddenly skidded, hit a small\n\nembankment a foot high, and re-\n\nbounded against a tree.\n\nThe Queen was thrown through the\n\nwindow of the car. She was terribly\n\ncut, and her skull was fractured.\n\nThe car, with the King still clinging\n\nto the wheel, ran into a small field,\n\nwhere it hit another tree, and then\n\noverturned into a bed of reeds on the\n\nedge of the lake.\n\nTheir Majesties' two elder children\n\nwere also staying at the villa with\n\nthe King and Queen.\n\nLATE QUEEN'S CAREER\n\nNiece of Swedish King\n\nThe Queen of the Belgians, wife of\n\nKing Leopold III, was enthroned with\n\nher Royal husband on February 23,\n\n1934, a week after the fatal accident\n\nto King Albert. Before her marriage\n\nto Leopold, who was then Crown\n\nPrince of Belgium, she was Princess\n\nAstrid of Sweden, being the third\n\ndaughter of Prince Charles, Duke of\n\nVastergotland, and his wife, who was\n\nformerly Princess Ingeborg of Den-\n\nmark. She was a niece of King Gus\n\ntav V of Sweden, and was born at\n\nStockholm in January, 1911.\n\nHer mother had original ideas, and\n\nthe education of her daughters was\n\ndifferent from that usually followed\n\nin the case of Royal children. Prin-\n\ncess Astrid and her sisters were taught\n\nto earn their own living, if necessary,\n\nfor Princess Ingeborg considered noth-\n\ning so insecure as the existence of a\n\nRoyal dynasty. Their training in\n\ncluded domestic science, and they had\n\nto go down once a week to the kit-\n\nchen and cook the family's meals.\n\nThey also had to supervise the house-\n\nhold expenses, for strict economy had\n\nto be practised, as the family was not\n\nrich. The girls learnt to make their\n\nown clothes and even to launder them.\n\nAll took a course of nursing, and had\n\nto spend four months as probationers\n\nat the hospital, where they were on\n\nthe same footing as the other nurses,\n\ngetting up at 5 a.m. and sweeping\n\nfloors, and attending to other house-\n\nhold duties.\n\nWhen the education of Princess\n\nAstrid had been finished, her mother\n\ntook her to Spa. They were invited\n\nto visit the Queen of the Belgians\n\n(wife of King Albert), who had taken\n\na fancy to the charming Swedish\n\nprincess, and saw in her a suitable\n\nwife for her son, Prince Leopold, who\n\nwas Crown Prince and Duke of\n\nBrabant, Prince Leopold at the time\n\nwas at the military college, and did\n\nnot meet his future wife on that\n\noccasion. But in March, 1926. his\n\nmother took Leopold to Stockholm,\n\nand there he met Princess Astrid for\n\nthe first time. They met again at\n\nLuxembourg, to which Astrid had\n\ngone with her mother and sister for\n\na christening ceremony. Then it was\n\nthat the Queen of the Belgians showed\n\nher motherly foresight and tact. The\n\ntwo Swedish princesses were invited\n\nto stay with the King and Queen of\n\nthe Belgians at their summer palace.\n\nDuring that period Leopold went\n\nincognito to Sweden to see the King\n\nand Queen of Sweden. Thus it was\n\na loveable marriage was made.\n\nROYAL MARRIAGE\n\nAscent To Belgian Throne\n\nThe betrothal was announced in\n\nSeptember. 1926, and it was em-\n\nphasised that it was based on warm,\n\nmutual love. The wedding took place\n\nin November in two stages â€” the civil\n\nceremony in Stockholm and the re-\n\nligious service in Brussels, for the\n\nbride was, and remained a Protestant,\n\nWhile the Prince is a Roman Catho-\n\nlic. The honeymoon was spent in\n\nthe south of France and in Paris\n\nwhere the young people stayed' in an\n\nhotel incognito as M. and Mme. Los\n\nange, from Mentone, seeing the sights\n\nlike ordinary tourists and sometimes\n\ntaking supper in Montmartre. They\n\nhad a great welcome home to Bel-\n\ngium.\n\nOn October 11, 1927, the Crown\n\nPrincess gave birth to a daughter,\n\nwho was named Josephine Charlotte\n\nIngeborg Marie-Jose Astrid. The\n\nbirth of an heir to the throne, Prince\n\nBaudouin, in 1931, caused great re-\n\njoicing in Belgium.\n\nWhile the Crown Prince and Prin-\n\ncess were ski-ing at Adelboden in\n\nFebruary, 1934, they received the\n\nnews of the tragic death of King\n\nAlbert. He had been killed by a fall\n\nwhile rock-climbing in the Ardennes\n\nStunned by the tidings, Leopold\n\nhastened back to Brussels, where on\n\nFebruary 23 he was proclaimed as\n\nKing Leopold III. In a manifesto to\n\nthe nation he said: 'Belgium will\n\ncontinue to associate herself with the\n\norganisations of peace, which she\n\nhopes to see prolonged in honour and\n\njustice by the coming together of the\n\npeoples. Belgium will also remain, re-\n\nsolved to make all necessary sacri-\n\nfices to assure the safety of her soil\n\nand liberty. I give myself to Bel-\n\ngium. The Queen will help me with\n\nall her heart in the accomplishment\n\nof my duty.\"'\n\nAfter the coronation the Queen\n\nplayed a splendid part with her Royal\n\nhusband in relieving distress in the\n\ncountry. Her early training proved of\n\nimmense benefit, for she became the\n\npractical leader of several social and\n\ndomestic movements for the educa-\n\ntion of Belgian mothers and girls,\n\nand became deservedly popular\n\nthroughout the nation. Leopold III\n\nhas been an exceptionally popular\n\nKing; in fact, he has been called an\n\nambassador of his country. And in\n\nevery movement for the welfare of his\n\npeople he had the loyal co-operation\n\nof his young Queen.\n\nKING ALBERT'S DEATH\n\nFell Down Cliff At Namur\n\nOn the afternoon of February. 17,\n\n1934, King Albert of the Belgians,\n\nwho had led his little nation through,\n\nthe dark days of the war, perhaps\n\nthe most heroic figure in all Europe,\n\nmet his death near Namur while in-\n\ndulging in his favourite hobby of\n\nmountaineering. With his valet he\n\nhad motored to Rocher de Marche\n\ndes Dames, where he intended to\n\nclimb the most difficult rocks. . He\n\nleft his valet in the car, saying: that\n\nhe would be back within an hour,\n\nbut never returned. At 2 o'clock the\n\nfollowing morning his body was found\n\nat the foot of a steep cliff, with a\n\ndeep wound in the neck. Fallen\n\nrocks lay near by. Amid national\n\nmourning and with heartfelt tributes\n\nfrom an admiring and sorrowing\n\nworld, King Albert was buried with\n\nmilitary pomp and splendour in the\n\nRoyal crypt at Laeken, and his, son\n\nLeopold was crowned King in his\n\nstead.\n\nThere were not wanting, however,\n\nrumours that King Albert had been\n\nthe victim of foul play, and on\n\nFebruary 22 a free fight occurred in\n\nthe Belgian Parliament when a Com-\n\nmunist deputy insinuated that pos-\n\nsibly King Albert's death had not\n\nbeen due to an accident. Nothing\n\nfurther than rumours developed, and\n\nit does not appear that this tragic in-\n\ncident, which cast a gloom over the\n\ncivilised world, was anything more\n\nthan a pure mishap, caused by a boul-\n\nder, over which King Albert had\n\nthrown a rope, giving way and hurl-\n\ning the King on to a butting shoulder\n\nof rock, causing instant death.\n\nLAKE OF LUCERNE\n\nOne of Finest in Euroupe\n\nLucerne, the capital of the Swiss\n\ncanton of the same name, is situated\n\n59 miles south-east of Basle. It is\n\nbeautifully situated where the Reuss\n\nissues from the Lake of Lucerne,\n\nopposite Mount Pilatus, and is partly\n\nsurrounded with mediaeval towers. On\n\na rock in the Reuss is an old, tower,\n\nwhich is said to have been, a light\n\nhouse (lucerna) in Roman times,\n\nhence the name of the town. Outside\n\none of the gates is the Lion of Lu-\n\nnone Help\n\nThe children of the late Queen: Prince\n\nBaudouin and Princess Josephine.\n\ncerne, which was hewn in 1821 out of\n\nthe solid rock after a model by Thor-\n\nwaldsen, and is a monument to the\n\nSwiss Guards who perished at the\n\nTuileries in Paris in 1792. Nearby is\n\nthe Glacier Garden with rocks illus-\n\ntrating the action of ice. The Lake of\n\nLucerne is one of the most beautiful\n\nin Europe. In shape it resembles a\n\ncross with a crumpleH stem, and its\n\nshores are mostly steep and rocky.\n\nThe length from Lucerne to Fluelen\n\nis 23 miles, and its average breadth\n\nis one and a half miles.\n\nnone Help"
