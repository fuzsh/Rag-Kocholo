The lives of these princes have only been addressed by a small number of anecdotal biographies and a handful of scholarly studies.1 Though the last couple of decades have seen the publication of numerous analyses of the weaknesses and strengths of various nineteenth-century monarchies, these deaths have never been subjected to a comparative analysis focusing on their impact on the Belgian constitutional monarchy and on what was done to cope with the succession crises triggered by each of them.2"
