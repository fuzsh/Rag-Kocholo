        "text": "Relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Croatia are constantly deteriorating, and in addition to re-announcing the formation of a third entity or Croatian self-government, as well as support for such an initiative from the neighborhood, officials in the two countries are significantly worsening them with accusations and insults from press conferences.\n\nFormer President of Croatia Stjepan Mesic explained that this problem is not new and that he does not know why the international community did not get involved a long time ago, because a lot could have been achieved at the diplomatic level.\n\nIt is necessary to talk\n\n”Croatian politics should not interfere in the internal affairs of BiH, as well as Serbian politics. Issues that need to be addressed should be resolved in BiH. These are issues that are being resolved there, and Croatia has institutions in BiH with which should communicate. The Prime Minister with the Prime Minister, the President of the Parliament with his colleague, and the President of the Republic needs to address the Presidency of BiH. Whether he agrees with someone or not, it does not concern anyone,” Mesic noted.\n\nThe same applies to Serbia, he added, because Dodik, Dzaferovic, and Komsic are members of the Presidency elected from their own peoples, and they are not their representatives.\n\n”On their own, they represent nothing. The three of themrepresent BiH and that is what obviously someone does not want to understand. The international community understands this and should have been involved sooner. They do not represent the peoples but were elected from the Bosniak, Serb, and Croat rank and it is all lege artis, in accordance with the Constitution and the Dayton Agreement, and I do not know why it was so heated on things that are clear to first–year law students,” added Mesic.\n\nRecognized BiH\n\nCommenting on statements by Croatian President Zoran Milanovic announcing support for the establishment of a third entity in BiH, or claiming that Croatia is the guarantor of the Dayton Accords, Mesic said the international community should make a statement on that.\n\n”That would lead to a normal conversation sooner. BiH institutions cannot be skipped. If we have recognized BiH, if the whole world recognizes it, then I guess we should also recognize it. The third entity would, for a start, mean the federalization of BiH, and later the breaking up of BiH. Milorad Dodik does not recognize BiH and now he needs another entity that would support him in that,” Mesic stressed.\n\nBiH will survive\n\nDespite all the challenges, the interlocutor and statesman, who has been a great friend of our country for decades, is convinced that BiH will survive."
