The two countries’ energy projects, including the Druzhba-Adria pipeline, were discussed.\n\nVladimir Putin noted the growth of bilateral trade which, he said, amounted to nearly one billion dollars.\n\nThere are absolutely no obstacles to the development and strengthening of ties between the two countries, said Stepan Mesic. He pointed out that Croatia relied on Russia’s greater role in maintaining peace in the region.\n\nVladimir Putin confirmed in turn that Russia, as before, was ready to act as a mediator and guarantor of stability in the Balkans."
