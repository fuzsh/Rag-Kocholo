        "text": "On 12 October 2007 the parliament voted to dissolve itself in view of elections due in November 2007. President Stjepan Mesic subsequently called elections for 25 November.\n\nIn the previous elections held in November 2003 the pro-western Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) won 66 seats. The main opposition party the Social Democratic Party (SDP former communist party) and its allies (the Libra the Liberal Party and the Istrian Democratic Party) took 43 seats. The Croatian People's Party (HNS) won 11 seats while the Croatian Party of the Right (HSP) and the Zagorje Democratic Party (ZDS) took eight seats each. The Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) and the Primorje Gorski Kotar Alliance (PGS) took nine three and one seat respectively. The remaining seats went to small parties.\n\nA total of 3 585 candidates from 251 lists (parties and coalitions) ran for the 2007 elections.\n\nThe 2007 elections saw once again a duel between Prime Minister Ivo Sanader's HDZ and the SDP of Mr. Zoran Milanovic. The main issues were economic policy and the country's accession to the European Union (EU) and NATO. Both parties were favourable to accede to the EU before 2010. While the HDZ pledged to accelerate the accession process the SDP argued the conditions of accession were more important than speed. The SDP added that accession to NATO should be decided by a referendum. Opinion polls indicated that only around 40 per cent of Croatians were favourable to membership of NATO. The HSP led by Mr. Anto Djapic was the only major Eurosceptic party. It argued that Croatia needed to protect its industries in particular agriculture and fisheries.\n\nPrime Minister Sanader advocated a liberal economy with less State involvement. Arguing that the government had created 129 000 jobs the HDZ pledged to continue to support the private sector and stringent fiscal measures to achieve a balanced budget by 2010. The SDP insisted on more State control over the economy. It promised to lower taxes on businesses while introducing a new tax on stock market gains. The HNS led by Ms. Vesna Pusic also promoted a liberal economy and pledged to deal with unemployment by providing lifelong education. The Croatian Party of Pensioners (HSU) focused on health welfare and pensions in a bid to attract one million pensioners in the country. It said it would align itself with whichever party won the elections.\n\nThe HSS the HSLS and the PGS maintained an electoral alliance under the name HSS-HSLS Coalition. The Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS) fielded candidates independently for the first time in its history. Its leader Ivan Jakovcic argued that the country should not rely on the two major parties (HDZ and SDP) and vowed to promote decentralization. The Croatian Democratic Assembly of Slavonia and Baranja (HDSSB) a breakaway party from the HDZ was led by Mr. Branimir Glavas MP and former military commander. He formed the HDSSB in May 2006 but was briefly jailed in October 2006 and April 2007 for alleged war crimes in 1991-2.\n\nThe HDZ had strong support from Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina who are eligible to vote. The SDP vowed to strip Bosnian Croats of the right to vote in Croatian elections if it was elected to office.\n\nOver 57 per cent of the country's 4.5 million registered voters including 400 000 voters abroad turned out at the polls. Turnout in Croatia was recorded at 63.41 per cent. Turnout abroad was recorded at 22 per cent although it reached 82 per cent in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) praised the elections for being transparently and professionally administered. It declared that they \"represented further progress in fully meeting OSCE commitments for democratic elections\".\n\nThe announcement of the final results was delayed due to irregularities in five polling stations where the number of the votes cast exceeded the total number of the voters. Elections were repeated on 9 December in those polling stations. Election results remained unchanged.\n\nThe final results gave 66 seats to the ruling HDZ. The SDP came in second with 56 seats. The HSS-HSLS Coalition won eight seats and the HNS took seven. The IDS and the HDSSB won three seats respectively. The HSP and the HSU each won one seat. The eight remaining seats were reserved for representatives of ethnic minorities (see note). Both the HDZ and SDP leaders claimed the right to form a government.\n\nOn 15 December President Mesic designated outgoing Prime Minister Mr. Sanader as the new Prime Minister stating Mr. Sanader had showed his ability to form a coalition. Mr. Sanader subsequently formed a new coalition government comprising the HDZ the HSS-HSLS Coalition the HSU and representatives of all ehnic minorities.\n\nThe newly-elected parliament held its first session on 11 January 2008 and elected Mr. Luka Bebic (HDZ) as its new Speaker.\n\nOn 13 January the parliament approved Mr. Sanader's new Cabinet. Mr. Slobodan Uzelac became the first ethnic Serb to hold the post of Deputy Prime Minister (in charge of economic development reconstruction and the return of refugees) since Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.\n\nNote on the eight members representing ethnic minorities:\n\n- Czech and Slovak minority: Ms. Zdenka Cuhnil (independent)\n\n- Serbian minority (three seats):\n\n(1) Mr. Ratko Gajica (Independent Democratic Serbian Party SDSS)\n\n(2) Mr. Milorad Pupovac (SDSS)\n\n(3) Mr. Vojislav Stanimirovic (SDSS)\n\n- Austrian Bulgarian German Polish Roma Romanian Ruthenian Russian Turkish Ukrainian Vallachian and Jewish national minority: Mr. Nazif Memedi (independent)\n\nItalian minority: Mr. Furio Radin (independent)\n\nHungarian minority: Mr. Denes Soja (independent)\n\nAlbanian Bosnian Montenegro Macedonian and Slovenian minority: Mr. Semso Tankovic (Party of Democratic Action of Croatia SDAH)"
