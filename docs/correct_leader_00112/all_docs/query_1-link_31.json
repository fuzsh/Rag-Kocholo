        "text": "Prishtina, 08 January 2010\n\nToday, Prime Minister Hashim Thaçi held a meeting with the President of the Republic of Croatia, Stjepan Mesic, who is on an official visit to Kosovo. Prime Minister Thaçi informed President Mesic on current developments in Kosovo and on Kosovo’s good cooperation with all neighboring countries.\n\nThe Prime Minister and President Mesic agreed that relations between Kosovo and Croatia have a long tradition and have always been strongly based on good and sincere cooperation, in many areas.\n\nOn behalf of the Kosovo Government, Prime Minister Thaçi opened the meeting by personally thanking President Mesic and the people of Croatia for the help and support they have given to Kosovo since independence, as well as prior to that, in helping Kosovo achieve freedom and peace.\n\n“It is my honor and pleasure today to meet a friend of the State of Kosovo, a friend of the people of Kosovo, but also my personal friend, the President of the Republic of Croatia, Stjepan Mesic. The role and contribution of President Mesic has been extremely important for all regional developments and the European perspective. Throughout his political career, we all remember the determination of President Mesic for Kosovo’s freedom, for regional peace and stability,” stated Prime Minister Thaçi.\n\nThe Prime Minister added: “Relations between Kosovo and Croatia will only advance in the future, in all aspects of institutional life. We have the same objective – to be part of NATO and the European Union.”\n\nThe Croatian President, Stjepan Mesic, praised the good bilateral relations between Croatia and Kosovo and expressed his hope for the advancing of economic cooperation and cooperation on the joint objective of the two states for Euro-Atlantic integration. He highly praised the standards that Kosovo has achieved in minority rights, which he considered a bridge linking states and peoples in the Balkans.\n\nPresident Mesic added that South East Europe has no alternative to Euro-Atlantic integration and this will help Europe become an even greater factor for peace, because a united Europe will open its borders.\n\nLast modified: July 31, 2022"
