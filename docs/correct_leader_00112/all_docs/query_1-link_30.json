        "text": "Winning two-thirds of the vote over his conservative challenger,\n\nStipe Mesic has secured a second five-year term in the presidential\n\noffice in Croatia.\n\nThe incumbent Stipe Mesic has won a convincing victory over\n\nhis challenger, Jadranka Kosor, in Croatiaâ€™s presidential\n\nrun-off vote held on 16 January. The independent Mesic\n\ntook 66 per cent of the vote leaving 34 per cent\n\nfor conservative Kosor of the Croatian Democratic\n\nUnion. Voter turnout was just above 50 per cent.\n\nThe people of Croatia appear to have rewarded the 70 year-old\n\nMesic, who first took office in 2000, with a second\n\nfive-year term for leading them out of international isolation\n\nfollowing the nationalistic rule of Franjo Tudjman.\n\nMesic is now likely to lead his country into the\n\nEuropean Union. Membership negotiations are due to begin\n\nwith Croatia in March 2005 provided that it continues to co-operate\n\nwith the international war crimes tribunal.\n\nRead more with Euractiv"
