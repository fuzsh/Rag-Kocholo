        "text": "Thursday, 3 December 2009\n\nMeeting of the President of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, Mr. Trajko Veljanoski, with the President of the Republic of Croatia, Mr. Stjepan Mesić\n\nAt the meeting, President Veljanoski and the Croatian President Mesić pointed out that the overall relations between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Croatia are continuously improving, and that the meetings and discussions of the highest state representatives are in that framework.\n\nThe President of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, Mr. Trajko Veljanoski emphasised the cooperation between the two Parliaments.\n\n„The cooperation is, above all, in the direction of realization of our strategic commitment - the Euro-Atlantic integration. At the same time, the highly developed relations have an important role in the strengthening of the stability of the whole region and its integration in the EU,” said the President of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, Mr. Veljanoski.\n\nWelcoming the agreement between Croatia and Slovenia, which unlocked the Croatian negotiations with the EU, President Veljanoski underlined that in this way both sides showed mutual trust and confidence that the problems can be resolved.\n\n„I expect Greece, as our neighbour, to follow this example, and that it will not block the giving of the date for opening the accession negotiations, said President Veljanoski.\n\nThe Croatian President, Mr. Stjepan Mesić, emphasized the progress of the Republic of Macedonia towards the EU, which was recognized with the recommendation of the European Commission to give Macedonia the date for opening the accession negotiations, and with the abolishment of the visa regime.\n\n„I believe that Macedonia will soon take its deserved place as NATO member state, since you, like Croatia and Albania, have fulfilled the conditions”, said President Mesić.\n\nHe reiterated his view that the bilateral issues cannot be an obstacle for the Euro-Atlantic Integration, and that he expects Macedonia to receive the date for opening negotiations.\n\n„The European integration processes must be completed with full integration of all the countries in the Region, and this will make the United Europe a true political factor of stability and prosperity in the world”, added President Mesić."
