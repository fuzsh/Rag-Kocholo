        "text": "Stipe Mesić (born Dec. 24, 1934, Orahovica, Croatia, Kingdom of Yugoslavia) is a Croatian politician who served as president of Croatia (2000–10).\n\nMesić earned a degree in law from the University of Zagreb (1961), after which he returned to his hometown of Orahovica in eastern Croatia, which was then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and served as mayor. In 1971, however, the Yugoslav communist authorities jailed him as a counterrevolutionary for supporting the “Croatian Spring,” a liberal nationalist awakening. He spent a year in the harsh Croatian Stara Gradiska political prison camp. Afterward, as a political outcast, Mesić focused his energies on serving as general manager of a small architectural firm in Zagreb.\n\nIn 1989 Mesić again became active in opposition politics, joining Franjo Tudjman and other antiregime dissidents, and became secretary of the new pro-independence and nationalist Croatian Democratic Union (Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica; HDZ), which won power the following year. Mesić was appointed president of the new government and represented Croatia at the federal Yugoslav level, having the distinction of serving as the last president of the large Yugoslav Federation. He resigned on Dec. 5, 1991, following attacks on Croatia by the Serb-dominated Yugoslav armed forces. Upon the creation of an independent Croatian state, Mesić became president of the parliament; Tudjman was elected president of Croatia.\n\nBy 1994 Mesić had broken with the HDZ over Tudjman’s autocratic rule. Thus, he began another period of political wandering. He failed in an attempt to forge a new party among HDZ dissidents, and in 1997 he joined the small Croatian National Party (Hrvatska Narodna Stranka; HNS) and soon became its vice president. In 1999 the HNS joined other opposition parties to contest parliamentary elections that resulted in the HDZ’s defeat. In late 1999 Tudjman died, and in the presidential elections of 2000 Mesić’s folksy and populist campaign, as well as his well-honed political instincts, struck a chord with an electorate tired of government corruption and abuse of authority. Mesić won in a runoff, and he was sworn in as president on Feb. 18, 2000."
