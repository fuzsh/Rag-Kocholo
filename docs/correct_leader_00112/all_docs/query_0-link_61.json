Not an official document)\n\nThe Hague, 30 August 2006\n\nJP/MOW/1103e\n\nJosip Jovic Found Guilty for Contempt\n\nThe Croatian journalist, Josip Jović, was today found guilty of contempt of the Tribunal and ordered to pay a fine of 20,000 Euros.\n\nIn its decision, Trial Chamber I stated that Jović published closed session court transcripts and parts of a witness statement given to the Office of the Prosecutor by witness Stjepan Mesić. Mesić, the Croatian President, testified in the case against former Croatian Army general Tihomir Blaškić.\n\nThe Judgement summary states that the Trial Chamber had no doubt that “Mr. Jović published transcripts which violated both the oral order for Mr. Mesić to testify in closed session and the 1 December 2000 cease and desist order”.\n\nThe Trial Chamber was particularly concerned that Jović’s disregard for the Trial Chamber’s orders in relation to publication of the closed session testimony “stymied the Tribunal’s ability to safeguard the evidence of a protected witness and risked undermining confidence in the Tribunal’s ability to grant effective protective measures”.\n\nJović, a former editor-in-chief of the Croatian daily newspaper Slobodna Dalmacija, was ordered to pay the fine imposed on him to the Tribunal’s Registrar within 30 days of the judgement.\n\nThe trial against Josip Jović was held on 11 July 2006.\n\nThe Tribunal has held contempt proceedings against 19 people, including accused, defence counsel, witnesses, journalists and others for charges including intimidating witnesses, refusing to answer questions in court, leaking confidential court documents, and breaching protective measures.\n\nThe full summary of the judgement as read out by Judge Robinson can be found at:\n\nhttp://www.icty.org/x/cases/contempt_jovic/tjug/en/060830_summary_en.pdf\n\nVeuillez trouver ci-dessous le résumé du jugement rendu par la Chambre de première instance, tel que lu à l'audience de ce jour par le Juge Robinson:\n\nhttp://www.icty.org/x/cases/contempt_jovic/tjug/fr/060830_Jovic_summary_fr.pdf"
