        "text": "2001 Scores\n\nStatus: Free\n\nFreedom Rating: 2.5\n\nCivil Liberties: 3\n\nPolitical Rights: 2\n\nRatings Change\n\nCroatia's political rights rating changed from 4 to 2, its civil liberties rating from 4 to 3, and its status from Partly Free to Free, due to the free and fair conduct of parliamentary and presidential elections, efforts to make state media independent of government, and evidence that the country's new leaders are fulfilling promises of economic, political, and social reform.\n\nOverview\n\nThe ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) suffered defeat in parliamentary and presidential elections early in 2000. Opposition candidates in both races had campaigned against the HDZ's abuses of power under the late President Franjo Tudjman and had promised to rebuild Croatia's credibility as a Western democratic nation. A coalition of center-left opposition parties formed a new parliamentary majority, and Ivica Racan, the head of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), became prime minister. Voters elected Stjepan Mesic of the Croatian People's Party (HNS) as president. Since the elections, Croatia has been invited to join the World Trade Organization and NATO's Partnership for Peace, and the European Union has agreed to open talks on a stabilization and association agreement.\n\nIn May 1990, Croatia, a republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, elected Franjo Tudjman president. When Croatia declared independence in 1991, civil conflict erupted in Serb enclaves of the country and the Yugoslav army invaded. One-third of Croatia remained under Serb control until 1995, when Tudjman launched an offensive to reclaim the territory. Ethnic Serbs fled Croatia in masses. Despite plans with Slobodan Milosevic to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina, Tudjman was prominent in the 1995 Dayton peace process that ended the Bosnian war.\n\nThroughout the 1991-1995 period, Tudjman used Croat nationalism to build a strong base of support. He also began to plunder state coffers, suppress the media, and subordinate the government and the judiciary to his personal and political whims. The HDZ was victorious in free (but not fair) parliamentary elections in 1995 and 1997. Tudjman was reelected in an unfair election in 1997.\n\nIn January 2000, a total of 282 candidates participated in democratic elections to the lower house of parliament. A center-left coalition of the SDP and the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) won 71 seats with nearly 49 percent of the vote. A coalition of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), the Liberal Party (LS), the HNS, and the Istrian Democratic Party (IDS) took 24 seats with 16.44 percent of the vote. Together, these two coalitions wrested control from the HDZ, which won only 46 seats or 31.5 percent of the vote. A right-wing coalition of the Croatian Christian Democratic Union and the Croatian Party of Rights also won 5 seats with 3.52 percent of the vote. Voter turnout in Croatia was 75 percent; it was much lower at polling stations in Serbia and Bosnia. SDP leader Ivica Racan became prime minister.\n\nCroatia's constitution calls for extraordinary elections within 60 days of a president's death. President Tudjman died on December 11, 1999, and the first round of voting took place January 24, 2001. Thirteen candidates successfully registered. The leading contenders were Mate Granic of Tudjman's HDZ, Stjepan Mesic of the HNS, and Drazen Budisa of the HSLS. In the first round Mesic received 41.11 percent of the vote; Budisa, 27.71 percent; and Mate Granic, 22.47 percent. Only Mesic and Budisa advanced to the second round, which Mesic won with 56 percent of the vote. Voter turnout was 63 percent in round one and 61 percent in round two.\n\nIn February, Croatia's new parliament agreed to support a four-year reform program aimed at building a market economy, honoring civil liberties and minority rights, tackling corruption, and restoring the country's international credibility. The program designated 2000 a year of economic austerity, and labor unions agreed to a limited truce. The government also slated the country's 11 largest companies for privatization and announced a major tax incentive for foreign investors.\n\nCroatia's new leaders linked the restoration of civil liberties with reductions in presidential power. To that end, parliament approved ground-breaking constitutional amendments that transformed the country's semipresidential system into a parliamentary one. Likewise, the new leadership has taken steps to restore press freedoms, honor privacy rights, ensure equality before the law, and address the specific needs of minority populations.\n\nPresident Mesic discovered more than 830 cassettes and 14,000 transcripts that are rife with evidence of corruption. Tudjman, it seems, secretly taped every conversation in his office. Already, powerful business executives, sporting officials, and members of Tudjman's family have been arrested or are under investigation for bribery or embezzlement. At least 70 army officers have been accused of faking injuries to get better pensions, and 100 corrupt police officials have been fired.\n\nIn 2000, Croatia agreed to fulfill its obligations to Bosnia under the 1995 Dayton peace accord. It also pledged to cooperate with the international tribunal at the Hague in its investigation of war crimes committed in Croatia and Bosnia between 1991 and 1995. In September, when twelve top generals publicly opposed the arrest of dozens of suspected war criminals, President Mesic summarily fired seven of them. In December, the government refused to allow General Petar Stipetic, the nation's highest-ranking military official, to testify until the tribunal clarified whether Stipetic was a witness or a suspect.\n\nPolitical Rights and Civil Liberties\n\nCroatian voters can change their government democratically. The 1990 constitution guarantees citizens age 18 or older the right to universal and equal suffrage. The parliamentary and presidential elections in 2000 were peaceful, free, and fair. In both cases, opposition parties and candidates proved victorious. Multiple factors contributed to the elections' success, including adherence to election laws, the provision of equal access for candidates to free airtime on state media, fair polling, and the honest tabulation of ballots. Parliament adopted a new parliamentary election law in November 1999. The 1992 law on presidential elections remains in force.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has criticized repeatedly Croatia's Law on Citizenship for favoring ethnic Croats over minorities. For example, unlike Croats in Bosnia, Serbs in exile have had difficulty proving their Croatian citizenship and, therefore, exercising their right to vote. The new parliamentary election law guarantees five seats for ethnic minorities.\n\nDespite constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression, President Tudjman suppressed and intimidated independent media and put state media completely under his control. For the 2000 parliamentary elections, however, the lower house required Croatian Radio and Television (HRT), the state broadcaster, to give equal coverage to all candidates. HRT voluntarily adopted the same guidelines for the presidential election. Croatia's new leadership has removed Tudjman loyalists from senior positions at HRT and has vowed to foster an environment in which independent media can flourish. Legislation to transform HRT into an independent public service corporation was pending before parliament at year's end.\n\nFreedom of religion is generally respected. In May 2000, the government established a commission to study the adoption of a law on religious minorities. Rights of association, assembly, and protest are also respected, although the former regime was known to restrict assembly rights arbitrarily. All associations must register their activities.\n\nThe constitution guarantees equality before the law. Under the Tudjman regime, persons could be denied the right to a fair trial, judicial appointments were politically motivated, and the security services served the president's needs. In 2000, though, Croatian courts started hearing economic corruption and war crimes cases, and parliament supported changes to the Law on Internal Affairs aimed at ending the use of wiretapping as a political tool.\n\nThe constitution also secures the right to move and travel freely, although registration in one's place of residence is required. After years of indifference, Croatia has agreed to work actively to repatriate thousands of ethnic Serbs who fled the country in 1995. Croatia is also home to thousands of internally displaced persons.\n\nWhile the constitution states that \"entrepreneurial and market freedom are the basis of the economic system,\" Croatian citizens have often found these freedoms difficult to exercise. President Tudjman, in particular, fostered an environment in which bribery and embezzlement were commonplace, privatization programs lacked transparency, and individuals were frequently deprived of salaries and pensions. Even though Croatia's new leadership has launched an aggressive economic reform program, it still became the target of strong criticism in 2000 when unemployment reached 20 percent."
