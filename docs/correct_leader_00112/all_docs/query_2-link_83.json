As multi-party politics returned to Croatia and the late Franjo Tudjman's nationalist Croatian Democratic Union, the HDZ, gained power in April 1990, Mr Mesic - already a prominent party member - was appointed prime minister.\n\nPresident Tudjman died in December\n\nBut within three months, Mr Mesic was shifted to another key post - as Croatia's representative on Yugoslavia's collective presidency. The following year it was his turn to take over the annually-rotating post of president, but the move was blocked by the Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic.\n\nIronically, it was not until after Croatia proclaimed its independence in June 1991 that, as part of a compromise deal brokered by Western diplomats, Mr Mesic was allowed to take up his post. By then Croatia was at war with the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army and the Yugoslavia federation was in the process of disintegration.\n\nAfterwards, Mr Mesic became speaker of the Croatian parliament, the Sabor. But he became increasingly disenchanted with President Tudjman's authoritarian style and his interventionist policy in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Along with several other senior figures, in 1994 Mr Mesic resigned from the HDZ to form a new political movement.\n\nMr Mesic's success has been due to a great extent to his personality and style\n\nBut the timing was wrong. President Tudjman was still enjoying widespread popularity as the founding father of Croatian independence, and after 1995 the HDZ was also benefiting from Croatia's success in recapturing areas of the country previously controlled by Serb forces.\n\nMr Mesic spent several years in the political wilderness but he was never out of the limelight. Though until recently his political influence remained minimal, thanks to his skills as an outstanding communicator he is a popular media personality.\n\nMr Mesic's success has been due to a great extent to his personality and style - accessible, witty, blunt. It is the exact opposite of President Tudjman's pomposity and regal manner which many Croats have come to resent.\n\nOne of his election posters invited Croats to have coffee with their would-be president and Mr Mesic has been doing his best to put this invitation into practice by meeting ordinary people as often as possible.\n\nOf course, it is not only the style, but also the policies that would change under Mr Mesic. He has promised to break with the Tudjman era's intense nationalism by opening Croatia up to Europe, stopping interference in Bosnia's affairs and co-operating more closely with the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.\n\nBut the new policies have also been espoused by the other front-runners in the presidential race. So if Mr Mesic wins, it is likely to be that Croats simply regard him as more likeable than his rivals."
