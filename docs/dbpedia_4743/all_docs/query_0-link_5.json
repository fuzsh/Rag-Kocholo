Telugu cinema is based in Film Nagar, Hyderabad. As of 2021 , Telugu cinema is the largest film industry in India in terms of box-office.[5][6] Telugu films sold 23.3 crore (233 million) tickets in 2022, the highest among various film industries in India.[3][4]\n\nSince 1909, filmmaker Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu was involved in producing short films and exhibiting them in different regions of Asia. He established the first Indian-owned cinema halls in South India.[7] In 1921, he produced the silent film, Bhishma Pratigna, generally considered to be the first Telugu feature film.[14] As the first Telugu film exhibitor and producer, Naidu is regarded as the 'Father of Telugu cinema'. The first Telugu film with audible dialogue, Bhakta Prahlada (1932) was directed by H. M. Reddy. In 1933, Sati Savitri directed by C. Pullayya received an honorary diploma at the 2nd Venice Film Festival.[16] Since its inception, Telugu cinema was known as the pre-eminent centre of Hindu mythological films in India.[17] From the late 1930s, films focused on contemporary living and social issues, like Raithu Bidda (1939), were produced and gradually gained prominence.\n\nTechnical crafts of Telugu cinema, especially visual effects and cinematography, are considered as one of the most advanced in Indian cinema.[18] The industry has produced some of India's most expensive and highest-grossing films of all time. Telugu production Baahubali 2 (2017) is currently the highest-grossing film of all time in India. The Telugu film industry is home to Ramoji Film City, certified by the Guinness World Records as the largest film studio complex in the world measuring over 1,666 acres (674 ha).[19][20]\n\nTen Telugu films were featured in CNN-IBN's list of \"100 Greatest Indian Films of All Time\".[note 1] Though known for big-ticket and blockbuster films catering to wider audience, Telugu filmmakers have also forayed into parallel and arthouse films.[22] Parallel films like Daasi (1988), Thilaadanam (2000), Vanaja (2006) among others have won accolades at major film festivals including Berlin, Karlovy Vary, Moscow, and Busan.[note 2]\n\nSince the mid-2010s, Telugu cinema has pioneered the Pan-Indian film movement, cutting across ethnic and linguistic barriers. Baahubali 2 (2017) won the Saturn Award for Best International Film. RRR (2022) is only the second non-English language film ever to make it to the National Board of Review's Top Ten Films. It received various international accolades including an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for the song \"Naatu Naatu\" and the Critics' Choice Award for Best Foreign Language Film. RRR is also the first Indian feature film to win an Academy Award.[30]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly development\n\n[edit]\n\nRaghupathi Venkaiah Naidu was a photographer and photographic studio owner in Madras who was drawn into filmmaking. Since 1909, he was involved in producing short films.[34][35] He shot 12 three-minute-long short films and exhibited them in Victoria Public Hall, Madras. He also travelled to Bangalore, Vijayawada, Sri Lanka, Rangoon and Pegu to exhibit his films.[34] In c. 1909-10, he established a tent house called Esplanade in Madras to exhibit his films.[33] In c. 1912-14, he established Gaiety Theatre on Mount Road, the first ever permanent cinema theatre in Madras and all of South India.[36] He later constructed Crown Theatre on Mint Street and Globe Theatre in Purasawakkam.[33][34] In his theatres, he screened American and European films as well as silent films made in various parts of India.[7]\n\nIn 1919, he started a film production company called 'Star of East Films' also called 'Glass Studio', the first production company established by a Telugu person.[36][33] He sent his son, Raghupati Surya Prakash Naidu (R. S. Prakash) to study filmmaking in the studios of England, Germany, and United States.[7] In 1921, they made Bhishma Pratigna, generally considered as the first Telugu feature film.[14] Venkaiah Naidu produced the film, while R. S. Prakash directed and produced it along with playing the title character Bhishma.[36] As the first Telugu film exhibitor and producer, Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu is regarded as the 'Father of Telugu cinema'.\n\nFrom 1921 to 1931 about a dozen feature films were made by Telugu people.[37] C. Pullayya made a three-reel short film, Markandeya (1926 or 1931) at his house in Kakinada.[38][37] In 1921, the first cinema hall in Andhra, Maruthi Cinema was established in Vijayawada by Pothina Srinivasa Rao. Y. V. Rao and R. S. Prakash established a long-lasting precedence of focusing exclusively on religious themes —Gajendra Moksham, Nandanar, and Matsyavataram —three of their most noted productions, centred on religious figures, parables, and morals.\n\nRise of the \"talkie\"\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first Telugu film with audible dialogue, Bhakta Prahlada, was directed by H. M. Reddy, who directed the first bilingual (Tamil and Telugu) talkie Kalidas (1931). Bhakta Prahlada was shot over 18 or 20 days at Imperial Studios, Bombay and was produced by Ardeshir Irani who also produced Alam Ara, India's first sound film.[40] The film had an all-Telugu starcast featuring Sindhoori Krishna Rao as the titular Prahlada, Munipalle Subbayya as Hiranyakasyapa, and Surabhi Kamalabai as Leelavathy.[35] Bhakta Prahlada was completed on 15 September 1931,[41] which henceforth became known as \"Telugu Film Day\" to commemorate its completion.[42][43][44]\n\nPopularly known as talkies, films with sound quickly grew in number and popularity. In 1932, Sagar Movietone produced Rama Paduka Pattabhishekam and Sakunthala, both directed by Sarvottam Badami.[45] Neither the producer nor the director of these two films were Telugus. In 1933, Pruthviputra, based on the story of Narakasura was released. It starred Kalyanam Raghuramayya and was produced by Pothina Srinivasa Rao, who had previously built the first cinema hall in Andhra in 1921. This was the first Telugu talkie entirely financed by Telugu people.\n\nIn 1934, the industry saw its first major commercial success with Lava Kusa. Directed by C. Pullayya and starring Parupalli Subbarao and Sriranjani, the film attracted unprecedented numbers of viewers to theatres and thrust the young industry into mainstream culture.[35] Dasari Kotiratnam produced Anasuya in 1935 and became the first female producer of Telugu film industry. The first film studio in Andhra, Durga Cinetone, was built in 1936 by Nidamarthi Surayya in Rajahmundry.[48][49] Sampurna Ramayanam (1936) was the first film produced by the studio relying mostly on local talent.[48] In 1937, another studio called Andhra Cinetone was built in Visakhapatnam.[50][7] However, both the studios were short-lived.\n\nEmergence of social themes\n\n[edit]\n\nBy 1936, the mass appeal of film allowed directors to move away from religious and mythological themes.[35] That year, under the direction of Kruthiventi Nageswara Rao, Prema Vijayam, a film with a contemporary setting, was released. It was the first Telugu film with a modern-day setting as opposed to mythological and folklore films. Later, more 'social films' i.e. films based on contemporary life and social issues, were made by filmmakers. Notable among them was Vandemataram (1939), touching on societal problems like the practice of dowry. Telugu films began to focus more on contemporary life, with 29 of the 96 films released between 1937 and 1947 featuring social themes.[54]\n\nIn 1938, Gudavalli Ramabrahmam has co-produced and directed the social problem film, Mala Pilla starring Kanchanamala. The film dealt with the crusade against untouchability, prevailing in pre-independent India.[55][56] In 1939, he directed Raithu Bidda, starring thespian Bellary Raghava. The film was banned by the British administration in the region, for depicting the uprise of the peasantry among the Zamindar's during the British raj.[57] The success of these films gave an impetus to Y. V. Rao, B. N. Reddy and others to produce films on social themes.[35] Viswa Mohini (1940) is the first Indian film depicting the Indian movie world. The film was directed by Y. V. Rao and scripted by Balijepalli Lakshmikantha Kavi, starring V. Nagayya. Rao subsequently made the sequel films Savithri and Sathyabhama (1941–42) casting thespian Sthanam Narasimha Rao.[58][59]\n\nThe outbreak of World War II and the subsequent resource scarcity caused the British Raj to impose a limit on the use of filmstrip in 1943 to 11,000 feet,[60] a sharp reduction from the 20,000 feet that had been common till then.[61] As a result, the number of films produced during the war was substantially lower than in previous years. Nonetheless, before the ban, an important shift occurred in the industry: Independent studios formed, actors and actresses were signed to contracts limiting whom they could work for, and films moved from social themes to folklore legends.[62] Ghantasala Balaramayya, has directed the mythological Sri Seeta Rama Jananam (1944) under his home production, Prathiba Picture, marking veteran Akkineni Nageswara Rao's debut in a lead role.[63]\n\nThe golden age\n\n[edit]\n\nMalliswari is the first Telugu film which had a public release with thirteen prints along with Chinese subtitles at Beijing on 14 March 1953, and a 16 mm film print was also screened in the United States.[64][65] The film was directed by B. N. Reddy, a recipient of the Dada Saheb Phalke Award, and the Doctor of Letters honour.[65]\n\nThe industry is one of the largest producers of folklore, fantasy, and mythological films.[66][67][68] Filmmakers like K. V. Reddy, B. Vittalacharya and Kodi Ramakrishna have pioneered this genre.[69][70] 1956 film Tenali Ramakrishna has garnered the All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film.\n\nK. V. Reddy's Mayabazar (1957) is a landmark film in Indian cinema, a classic of Telugu cinema that inspired generations of filmmakers. It blends myth, fantasy, romance and humour in a timeless story, captivating audiences with its fantastical elements. The film excelled in various departments like cast performances, production design, music, cinematography and is particularly revered for its use of technology. The use of special effects, innovative for the 1950s, like the first illusion of moonlight, showcased technical brilliance.. Powerful performances and relatable themes ensure Mayabazar stays relevant, a classic enjoyed by new generations. On the centenary of Indian cinema in 2013, CNN-IBN included Mayabazar in its list of \"100 greatest Indian films of all time\". In a poll conducted by CNN-IBN among those 100 films, Mayabazar was voted by the public as the \"greatest Indian film of all time.\"\n\nRelangi and Ramana Reddy were a comedy double act during this era.[71] Nartanasala (1963) won three awards at the third Afro-Asian Film Festival in Jakarta.[72] Donga Ramudu directed by K. V. Reddy was archived in the curriculum of the Film and Television Institute of India.[73] Nammina Bantu received critical reception at the San Sebastián International Film Festival.[74][75] 1967 film Ummadi Kutumbam was selected by Film Federation of India as one of its entries to the Moscow Film Festival.[73][76] The 1968 cult classic Sudigundalu was screened at the Tashkent and Moscow Film Festivals.[77] Bapu's directorial venture Sakshi was showcased at Tashkent International film festival in 1968.[78] In 1976, he directed Sita Kalyanam got critical acclaim at the BFI London Film Festival and Chicago International Film Festival, and is part of the curriculum at British Film Institute.[79][80]\n\nShift from Madras to Hyderabad\n\n[edit]\n\nThe nickname Tollywood is a portmanteau of the words Telugu and Hollywood.[81] Moola Narayana Swamy and B. N. Reddy founded Vijaya Vauhini Studios in 1948 in the city of Chennai.[82] Indian film doyen L. V. Prasad, who started his film career with Bhakta Prahlada, founded Prasad Studios in 1956 based in Chennai.[83] However, through the efforts of D. V. S. Raju, the Telugu film industry completely shifted its base from Chennai to Hyderabad in the early 1990s, during N. T. Rama Rao's political reign.[84]\n\nVeteran actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao relocated to Hyderabad and has developed Annapurna Studios. About 245 Telugu films were produced in 2006, the highest in India for that year. Film studios in Hyderabad, including Ramoji Film City, developed by D. Ramanaidu and Ramoji Rao, are involved in prolific film production and employment.[85] There is a fair amount of dispersion among the Indian film industries. Since 2005, many successful Telugu films have been largely remade by the Bengali cinema and Hindi film industries, while in the past, Telugu filmmakers drew inspiration from Bengali cinema and literature.[86] Telugu film production accounts for one per cent of the gross domestic product of the region.[87][88][89]\n\nThe digital cinema network company UFO Moviez marketed by Southern Digital Screenz (SDS) has digitised several cinemas in the region.[90][91] The Film and Television Institute of Telangana, Film and Television Institute of Andhra Pradesh, Ramanaidu Film School and Annapurna International School of Film and Media are some of the largest film schools in India.[92][93] The Telugu states consist of approximately 2800 theatres, the largest number of cinema halls of any state in India.[94] Being commercially consistent, Telugu cinema had its influence over commercial cinema in India.[95]\n\nThe industry holds the Guinness World Record for the largest film production facility in the world, Ramoji Film City.[96] The Prasads IMAX located in Hyderabad is one of the largest 3D IMAX screens, and the most attended cinema screen in the world.[97][98][99] As per the CBFC report of 2014, the industry is placed first in India, in terms of films produced yearly.[100] The industry holds a memorandum of understanding with the Motion Picture Association of America to combat video piracy.[101][102][103] In the years 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2014 the industry has produced the largest number of films in India, exceeding the number of films produced in Bollywood.[104][85]\n\n1992 film Gharana Mogudu is the first Telugu film to gross over ₹10 crore at the box office.[105] Produced on a shoe string budget of ₹1.2 crore, 2000 film Nuvve Kavali became sleeper hit of the late 1990s.[106][107] It was screened for 200 days in 20 screens grossing over ₹20 crore.[108][109][110]\n\nThematic diversity and genre innovations\n\n[edit]\n\nDasari Narayana Rao directed the most number of films in the Telugu language, exploring themes such as aesthestics in Meghasandesam (1982), Battle of Bobbili in the biographical war film Tandra Paparayudu (1986), alternate history with Sardar Papa Rayudu (1980), and gender discrimination in Kante Koothurne Kanu (1998) for which he received the Special Jury Award (Feature Film - Director) at the 46th National Film Awards.[113] K. Raghavendra Rao explored devotional themes with Agni Putrudu (1987), Annamayya (1997), Sri Ramadasu (2006), Shirdi Sai (2012) and Om Namo Venkatesaya (2017) receiving various state honours.[114]\n\nSingeetam Srinivasa Rao introduced science fiction to the Telugu screen with Aditya 369 (1991), the film dealt with exploratory dystopian and apocalyptic themes.[115] The edge of the seat thriller had characters which stayed human, inconsistent and insecure. The film's narrative takes the audience into the post apocalyptic experience through time travel, as well as folklore generation of 1500 CE, which including a romantic backstory, the \"Time Machine\" made it a brilliant work of fiction.[116][117][118]\n\nJandhyala popularly known as \"Hasya Brahma\" (Brahma of comedy),[119] ushered a new era of comedy in Telugu cinema, where his movies captivated audiences with their blend of humor and social commentary. \"Before his movies, comedy was a small part of movies and comedians were sidekicks to the hero or villain. Jandhyala proved that comedy can itself be a full-length subject and achieved a great success in this endeavor.\" His films are well known as clean entertainers affable to the family audiences without any obscene language or double entendre.[120] Aha Naa Pellanta! is considered one of the best comedy films in Telugu cinema.[121]\n\nRam Gopal Varma's Siva, which attained cult status in Telugu cinema, is one of the first Telugu films produced after the migration of Telugu film industry from Madras to Hyderabad to feature characters speaking the Telangana dialect.[122][123] Varma was credited with the introduction of steadicams and new sound recording techniques in Telugu films.[124] Within a year of the film's release, more than ten steadicams were imported into India.[125] Siva attracted the young audience during its theatrical run, and its success encouraged filmmakers to explore a variety of themes and make experimental Telugu films.[126][127]\n\nSubsequently, Varma introduced road movie and film-noir to Indian screen with Kshana Kshanam. Varma experimented with close-to-life performances by the lead actors, which bought a rather fictional storyline a sense of authenticity at a time when the industry was being filled with unnecessary commercial fillers.[128] It went on to gather a cult following in south India,[129] with a dubbed Hindi version titled Hairaan released to positive reports from bollywood critics, the Ann Arbor Film Festival, and the Fribourg Festival.[130][131]\n\nChiranjeevi's works such as the comedy thriller, Chantabbai, the vigilante thriller, Kondaveeti Donga the first Telugu film to be released on a 70 mm 6-Track Stereophonic sound,[citation needed] the western thriller Kodama Simham, and the action thriller, Gang Leader, popularised genre films with the highest estimated footfall.[132] He received the Padma Vibhushan, the second-highest civilian award, in 2024.[133] Reddiff.com cited Sekhar Kammula's, National Award-winning Dollar Dreams (2000) as a take off from where Nagesh Kukunoor's Hyderabad Blues (1998) ends.[citation needed] Dollar Dreams explored the conflict between American dreams and human feelings. The film re-introduced social realism to Telugu screen, and brought back its lost glory which until then was stuck in its run of the mill commercial pot-boilers.[134]\n\nVanaja (2006) won several international awards including the first prize in the live-action feature film category at the Chicago International Children's Film Festival.[135] Dream (2012), has garnered the Royal Reel Award at the Canada International Film Festival.[136][137][138] 2013 Social problem film, Naa Bangaaru Talli won Best Film award at the Detroit Trinity International Film Festival.[139][140][141]\n\nMinugurulu (2014) about blind children received Best Indian Film at the \"9th India International Children's Film Festival Bangalore\".[142] 2013 Cultural film, O Friend, This Waiting! has received special mention at the Erasing Borders Festival of Classical Dance, Indo-American Arts Council, New York, 2013.[citation needed] Experimental film Parampara has garnered the Platinum Award for Best Feature at the International Indonesian Movie Awards.[143] 2018 biographical film Mahanati based on the life of veteran actress Savitri has garnered the \"Equality in Cinema Award\" at the 2018 Indian Film Festival of Melbourne.[144]\n\nDuring the 1990s, the Rayalaseema dialect was portrayed in films about the factional conflicts in the area, while the Telangana dialect, already having been pegged to villainous and comedic roles, saw an increase in this usage in reaction to the shift of the Telugu film production from Madras to Hyderabad.[145][146] After the formation of the state of Telangana in 2014, Telangana culture gained more prominence, and more films were produced portraying Telangana culture, and dialect.[147]\n\nSub-genres and off-beat films\n\n[edit]\n\nScreenwriters such as Chandra Sekhar Yeleti experimented with the off beat film Aithe (2003) with a caption \"all movies are not the same\". Aithe was made on a shoestring budget of about 1.5 crores and went on to collect more than 6 crores. After almost two years he delivered another thriller Anukokunda Oka Roju (2005) both films were a refreshing change of pace to the audiences, produced by Gangaraju Gunnam.[148] Aithe was remade in Tamil as Naam (2003) and in Malayalam as Wanted (2004).[149]\n\nMohana Krishna Indraganti explored the themes of chastity, and adultery in his literary adaption Grahanam (2004) (based on \"Gunadosham\" by social critic G. V. Chalam).[150][151] Grahanam was shot in 19 days with a digital camera.[152][failed verification] B. Anuradha of Rediff.com cited \"In this offbeat film, Indraganti upholds the tirade against chauvinists who accuse a noble lady of infidelity, ignoring her denials with contempt\". The film was featured at the Independent South Asian Film Festival in the United States.[153][152]\n\nSpeaking about the centenary of Indian cinema at the CII Media and Entertainment Summit 2012, filmmaker Shekhar Kapur said regional cinema is surpassing Hindi cinema in content and story, and cited Eega (2012) as an example. Kapur said he was impressed with its story and use of technology, and called it \"no less than a Hollywood superhero film\".[154] Shah Rukh Khan called Eega an \"awesomely original\" film and a \"must watch\" with children.[155][156] Eega won various awards at the 8th Toronto After Dark Film Festival.[157]\n\nSub Genre war drama Kanche (2015) by Krish Jagarlamudi explored the 1944 Nazi attack on the Indian army in the Italian campaign, during World War II in an engrossing background tale of caste-ism while giving it a technically brilliant cinematic rendition.[158] Sankalp Reddy explored submarine warfare in his directorial debut Ghazi (2017), based on the mysterious altercation between PNS Ghazi and INS Karanj during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.[159] Indo-Asian News Service called new-generation film maker Sandeep Vanga's Arjun Reddy the \"most original, experimental work to come out of Telugu cinema in a long time\", and said the protagonist's (played by Vijay Deverakonda) \"rise, fall and rise ... is nothing short of poetic and heart wrenching\".[160] Actor-dancer Allu Arjun produced and acted in the short film, I Am That Change (2014), to spread awareness on individual social responsibility. The movie was directed by Sukumar, which was screened in theatres across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana on Indian Independence day, 2014.[161]\n\nAdivi Sesh scripted the Neo-noir Kshanam (2016), based on a real life incident of a missing three-year-old girl.[162] Sesh followed it up writing R.A.W. thriller Goodachari (2018), and the war docudrama Major (2022).[163][164] Cinema Bandi (2022) scripted and directed by Praveen Kandregula, and produced by film making duo Raj and D.

S. S. Rajamouli pioneered the pan-Indian films movement with duology of epic action films Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017), that changed the face of Indian cinema.[170] \"Pan-India film\" is both a style of cinema and a distribution strategy, designed to universally appeal to audiences across the country and simultaneously released in multiple languages.[171]\n\nFilm journalists and analysts, such as Baradwaj Rangan and Vishal Menon, have labelled Prabhas as the \"first legit Pan-Indian Superstar\" in Indian cinema.[172] Actors like Prabhas, Allu Arjun, Ram Charan and N.

The film was considered one of the ten best films of the year by the National Board of Review, making it only the seventh non-English language film ever to make it to the list. The song \"Naatu Naatu\" won the Oscar for Best Original Song at the 95th Academy Awards, making it the first song from an Indian film, as well as the first from an Asian film, to win in this category. This made the film the first Indian film by an Indian production to win an Academy Award.[175][176]\n\nSrivatsan S of The Hindu wrote that Telugu cinema has excelled in marketing Pan-Indian films. It primarily employed two strategies – promoting the film outside their home territory and collaborating with other regional stars for more visibility.[177] Following the international success of Pushpa: The Rise (2021), RRR (2022), Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire (2023). Rahul Devulapalli of The Week identified \"Content, marketing, and indulgent overseas audience\" have led to the rise of world cinema in Telugu language.[178] The Guardian cited Kalki 2898 AD as a \"maximalist sci-fi epic mixing Mahabharata with Mad Max\".[179]\n\nExpanding global distribution\n\n[edit]\n\nAthadu was released with 6 prints in United States and was distributed by Vishnu Mudda and Soma Kancherla of Crown DVD distribution company in San Jose, Dallas, Detroit, Virginia, New Jersey, Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, Minneapolis, Phoenix at Arizona and also in centers like Lowell at Massachusetts, MA, Tulsa at Oklahoma, West Virginia, Springfield, Boulder at Colorado and Corpus Christi at South Texas.

This isn't America dipping a toe in Indian cinema — it's a victory lap\".[198][11] Filmmaker S. S.
