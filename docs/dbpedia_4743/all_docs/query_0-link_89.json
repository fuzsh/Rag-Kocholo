        "text": "Plot\n\nThe film begins with the demon king Ravana visiting Kailasa, the abode of Lord Shiva, on an inopportune time. He is obstructed by the guardian deity Nandi who warns him against going in and disturbing Shiva's privacy. A rift between them forces an enraged Nandi to curse Ravana that an army of monkeys would destroy him. In retaliation, Ravana decides to uproot Kailasa, and uses all his strength to do so. Shiva notices this and presses the land with his big toe, trapping Ravana completely beneath the mountain he was lifting. Ravana worries about his safety and sings hymns in praise of Shiva, who finally forgives and blesses him.\n\nShiva's blessings make Ravana invincible, who soon conquers multiple worlds. The deities reach Lord Vishnu and request him to intervene, who promises to address it at the opportune time. In a chance encounter, he falls for the beauty of celestial Rambha and molests her. Rambha's fiancÃ©e Nalakuvara curses Ravana to die when he aspires to possess any woman without her wish. Goddess Lakshmi then chose to take birth as Vedavathi on Earth, for whom Ravana develops a liking few years later. When he wishes to molest her, Vedavathi commits suicide after cursing to be reborn and cause his death, setting Nalakuvara and Nandi's curses into action. She is born as Sita accordingly, and is adopted by Janaka, the king of Mithila.\n\nAround the same time, as a result of a Putrakameshti Yajna, King Dasharatha of Ayodha and his three wives beget four children. Vishnu is born as Rama, the eldest of the four. Years later, Rama and his brother Lakshmana join the gurukula of sage Vishvamitra when the latter requests Dasharatha security for a yajna they are conducting in the forest. Vishvamitra trains the duo in warfare and administration, which helps them in killing the demons Tataka and Maricha who try to obstruct the yajna. As the purpose of their stay is completed, Vishvamitra takes Rama and Lakshmana to an old hermit, where Rama's presence helps the cursed woman Ahalya in regaining her human form.\n\nMeanwhile, in Mithila, Janaka has arranged svayamvara for Sita, and various kings attend as prospective bridegrooms. Ravana too joins them uninvited along with Rama, who has only accompanied Vishvamitra as an audience. The challenge posed is to affix and subsequently break the bow gifted by Shiva to Janaka's ancestors. As Ravana and others fail, Rama lifts the bow with Shiva's blessings and breaks it. This enraged Shiva's devotee Parasuramawho confronts Rama. Later, he realises that Rama is an incarnation of Vishnu just like him and backs off. The film ends on a happy note with the wedding of Sita and Rama.\n\nProduction\n\nN. T. Rama Rao's portrayal of the demon king Ravana (the antagonist of the Hindu epic Ramayana) in Bhookailas (1958) earned him critical acclaim.[1] However, after the release of its Kannada-language version Bhookailasa in the same year which featured a different cast and crew, Rama Rao's portrayal was often compared with that of Rajkumar who played Ravana. This, along with Ravana's reputation as a renowned Shiva devotee, made Rama Rao consider reprising the role in another film which focused on a more layered representation of the character.[2] He and writer Samudrala Sr. studied Ravana's arcs from various versions of Ramayana and other mythologies. Later, Rama Rao's friend Dhanekula Buchi Venkata Krishna Chowdhary came up with a story which they liked, and Samudrala wrote the dialogues, songs and poems.[1][3] Though the film's narrative was centered around Ravana, Samudrala named the film Sita Rama Kalyanam after Ramayana's protagonists Rama and Sita.[1]\n\nRama Rao's brother N. Trivikrama Rao decided to produce the film for his company National Art Theatre and approached the former's mentor K. V. Reddy to direct the film.[1] Reddy declined the offer, saying that he could not envision Rama Rao playing a demon. Rama Rao then decided to direct the film himself, marking his directorial debut.[2] He, however, refrained from crediting himself as the director and instead paid homage to his parents.[3] When Trivikrama Rao suggested that Rama Rao should play a dual role as both Rama and Ravana, the latter refused and chose to work with younger actors. He met Haranath at Pondy Bazaar and signed him to play Rama.[2] Sobhan Babu was cast as Rama's brother Lakshmana.[1] Impressed with her cameo appearance in Rani Ratnaprabha (1960), Rama Rao cast Geetanjali for the role of Sita.[2] B. Saroja Devi, Gummadi and V. Nagaiah were cast in key supporting roles.[1] Sita Rama Kalyanam also marked Kanta Rao's first on-screen appearance as Narada, a mythological character which he would reprise later in multiple unrelated Telugu language films.[2][3]\n\nRama Rao approached M. A. Rahman, the cinematographer of the former's acting debut Mana Desam (1949), to collaborate for this film as the director of photography. When Rahman was unavailable, he signed Ravikant Nagaich for the job, marking the latter's debut in Telugu cinema.[3] S. P. S. Veerappa edited the film and I. N. Murthy served as the co-director.[1] All the sequences were filmed in sets erected at the Vijaya Vauhini Studios in Madras (now Chennai).[1] For filming the Ravananugraha sequence, Nagaich opted for using mask shots capturing varying expressions of Rama Rao instead of working with nine dummy heads. This took more than ten hours to shoot, and Rama Rao had to stay motionless for longer intervals.[1][3]"
