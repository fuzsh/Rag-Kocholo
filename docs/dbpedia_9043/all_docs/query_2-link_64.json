        "text": "Chris Kidwell\n\nTake a walk with me down Fascination Street as I get to know Chris Kidwell. Chris is the singer / songwriter for the new Thrash Metal band out of El Paso, Texas called TEXAS TALIBAN. In this episode Chris and I chat about where he grew up and how he got into music. Next we discuss the importance of widening your horizons and seeing (and hearing) things from outside of your town; which is why he joined the US Army and got to see and experience the world. We discuss how Texas Taliban was formed and some of the bands the members are also in. He lets me play my favorite track off of their debut EP called Tu Rey Muerto. And finally Chris has a message for all fans of all musicians.\n\nFollow Chris and Texas Taliban on social media:\n\nTwit: @2Krunked / @Texas_Taliban\n\nInsta: @Kidwell03 / @Texas_Taliban\n\nFB: Christo Cydwell / Texas Tali3an\n\nDonald Carpenter\n\nTake a walk with me down Fascination Street as I get to know Donald Carpenter. Donald was previously the lead singer for the rock band SubmerseD, and Eye Empire; and currently fronts the new rock band Blisskrieg. Blisskrieg is comprised of Donald, and the three founding members of Days Of The New and Tantric. (Todd Whitener, Matt Taul, and previous guest Jesse Vest)\n\nIn this episode Donald and I chat about how he got into the music business, how his first 2 successful bands got together, why he took a break from the music business, and how this new band came to be. We do briefly discuss some of the pitfalls and downsides of the music business, as well as some behind the scenes stories about how this new album got made during Covid 19. Donald does let me play one of the songs off of Blisskrieg’s new album Remedy (available everywhere), so Thank you Donald!\n\nFollow Donald on social media:\n\nInsta: @DonaldCarpenterMusic\n\nFB: Donald Carpenter (Musician Page)\n\nFollow Blisskrieg on social media:\n\nTwit: @BlisskriegBand\n\nInsta: @BlisskriegBand\n\nFB: Blisskrieg\n\nThis episode is with Morgan Catron. Morgan is a recreational therapist currently working at the Wyoming state hospital in Evanston. My wife met her while working at that facility. In this episode Morgan tells us why she became a therapist, some of the benefits of being a registered Cherokee Native. She also plays a couple of songs LIVE “in studio”. I have been blessed by being allowed to play ALOT of my previous guests music on this show; but this is THE FIRST live performance. You will greatly enjoy these tunes, and this young lady!\n\nFollow Morgan on social media:\n\nTwit: @MoCatron2550\n\nInsta: @Morgan_Catron\n\nFB: Morgan Catron"
