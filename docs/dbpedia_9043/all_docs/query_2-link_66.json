        "text": "Travis Meeks (b. Charlestown, April 27, 1979 - ) – Singer, guitarist and songwriter. After learning to play guitar at age nine, Meeks started a heavy metal band in his mid-teens with three friends (two from Jeffersonville, Indiana, and one from Louisville). Originally called Dead Reckoning, the band morphed into Days of the New in 1995. Categorized as a post-grunge band, Days of the New landed a contract with a major label when Meeks was only seventeen. Shortly after, Meeks fired the other members and transformed the band into a solo project. (As a side note, the other members—Jesse Vest, Todd Whitener, and Matt Taul—went on to form Tantric in Louisville.) From 1997 to 2001, Days of the New landed six singles on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart. Although Meeks to be a profound artist, he developed an addiction to methamphetamine and was featured on A & E’s Intervention in 2005. Meeks's return to drug use put an end to a reunion of Days of the New in 2014."
