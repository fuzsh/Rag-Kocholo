We have seen them multiple times and they are always so kind and they always put on a killer show. Jon is an amazing drummer but even better he is just truly an amazing human and I always have a soft spot for a bass player so I keep my eyes on Eric almost the entire show lol (sorry Hugo). They are just an amazing band but also they are kind and humble humans which just makes them an even better band!\n\nCadillac, MI@\n\nThe Venue Event Center"
