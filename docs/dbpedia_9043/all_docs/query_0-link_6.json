        "text": "Early life\n\nWhitener began playing guitar in 1992, when he bought a 'Dixon' guitar for 70 dollars. From the year 1992 until 1995, he played in various local bands. In 1995, he joined a band formed by members Jesse Vest, Travis Meeks and Matt Taul. The band's name at the time was called Dead Reckoning. Upon Whitener joining the band, the band name was changed to Days of the New.\n\nDays of the New\n\nBy the year 1996, the band had signed a recording contract and released their self-titled album the following year. The album went platinum and they got to open for Metallica. Despite the quick rise to fame, Whitener along with the other original members of the band were fired by Meeks.\n\nIn 2014 Whitener, and the other original Days of the New band members Jesse, Matt and Travis reunited for their 'Full Circle' Tour. The band was to release an EP later in the Fall of 2014, but once again the original lineup malfunctioned, causing Jesse, Matt and Todd to leave the group.\n\nTantric\n\nAfter the dismissal from Days of the New, Whitener and the other two members would form the band C-14 along with their new lead singer, Hugo Ferreira. The band quickly changed their name to Tantric. Their self-titled debut went platinum and the band made a few appearances on a few late night shows. In 2004, the band released their second album, After We Go.\n\nThe album did not have the same success as their debut album. The band quickly began disintegrating, first having bassist Jesse Vest leave the band in 2005 while later having drummer Matt Taul be arrested on drug charges in 2007. Whitener walked away from the band, frustrated with the lack of support and recognition for the band to succeed.\n\nSolo career\n\nSince his departure, Whitener embarked on a solo career. In 2008, he gave classes at Mom's Music in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. Whitener also played guitar in local shows. He joined Bruce LaFrance to form a band called Interchange for which they released a few songs which were never released for purchase.\n\nIn 2013, Whitener released his first solo record, an E.P called Seeds of Positivity under his last name, Whitener. In 2014, Whitener released his first full album, entitled Connectivity. Both albums were released digitally.\n\nWhitener released his second solo studio album titled \"Sunsets and Fairytales\" on May 12, 2015.\n\nOn November 14, 2015 Whitener released a 4-track EP titled \"There to Here\" including the singles \"Fade (EP Remix)\" and \"What Have I Done To You\".\n\nOn December 12, 2015 Whitener released a new single titled \"Love Is True\"."
