Tantric is an American rock band from Louisville, Kentucky. The group was founded in 1998 by Todd Whitener, Jesse Vest and Mat Taul after they left Days of the New, and joined forces with vocalist Hugo Ferreira. Ferreira is the only remaining member of the band from the original lineup.

The band's most recent release, their 8th full-length album "The Sum Of All Things", was released July 23, 2021, via Cleopatra Records.

After leaving Days of the New in November 1998 guitarist Todd Whitener, bassist Jesse Vest, and drummer Matt Taul reached out to Massachusetts native Hugo Ferreira (formerly of the band Merge) in early 1999 to see if he would be interested in starting a new project together. The former Days of the New members had previously met Ferreira during a tour and admired his distinct baritone voice. By March that year, the four had their first practice together upon Ferreira's move to Nashville. The band started under the name C-14 but soon changed their name to Tantric. With the help of friends in Louisville radio, the band quickly gained local exposure.
