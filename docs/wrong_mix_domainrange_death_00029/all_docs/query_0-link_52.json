Current renovation to the upstairs has brought to light long-vacant offices and doors bearing the names of doctors, dentists and attorneys who once practiced there.\n\n...Among the professionals associated with the Jax Building is that of Dr. Rae Byrd Leavell, whose office door still bears his name in painted lettering.\n\n...Betty Amy Moeller of Bastrop said she remembers when her grandfather practiced medicine in the Jax Building. I remember going up there to get an iron shot when I was about five or six years old, she said.\n\n...Moeller said her grandfather was born near Jones in 1877, earned his medical degree from Tulane University circa 1900 and married her grandmother in 1901.\n\n...Leavell first practiced medicine in Jones, but contracted tuberculosis and so moved to the dry air of Silver City, N.M. some time before Moellers father was born there in 1906. Leavell practiced in Silver City and in San Angelo, Texas before returning to Morehouse Parish.\n\n...He was what was known as a physician and surgeon in those days, said Moeller.\n\n...Leavell practiced medicine in the former community of Plantersville on the Old Bonita Road. He is mentioned as one of six physicians in Plantersville in Rebecca DeArmond-Huskeys Bartholomews Song: A Bayou History (Heritage Books Inc.: 2001).\n\n...Moeller said she is uncertain when her grandfather moved into the Jax Building office, but that he was practicing in Bastrop as early as 1933. I remember going with him on house calls in his Plymouth, she said. He would let me sit in the car and hold his black bag.\n\n...During his long career, Leavell was on staff at Bastrop City Hospital and served in the Selective Service during World War II, from 1942-47. He was a member of First Methodist Church and passed away in 1946.\n\n...Moeller also recalls childhood visits to Dr. Gilliand, a dentist who practiced in the same building. I have vivid memories of that. Theyd didnt have anesthesia back then.\n\n...Moeller said a later owner of the Jax Building let her keep a transom with her grandfathers name on it that once hung above his office door. The transom was lit by an electric bulb.\n\n...Doug Higginbotham of Bastrop said he remembers Dr. Leavell, as well as several other professionals who had offices in the Jax Building.\n\n...Higginbotham said he was born here in 1918 and has lived in Bastrop his entire life, with the exception of time in the service during World War II. His uncle, Fred Higginbotham, operated Freds Cafe for many years below the Jax Building offices.\n\n...Higginbotham said as a student at Central Grammar School, he used to walk to the cafe after school where his father -- Bastrop Police Chief J.D. Higginbotham -- would meet him for dinner.\n\n...Higginbotham said his childhood dentist, Dr. Reitzell, had an office in the building. He also remembers Dr. Larche, Dr. Johnston and Dr. Gilliand in addition to Dr. Leavell.\n\n...Higginbotham said he played football and basketball as a student at the old Bastrop High School, and the young athletes came to Leavells office for treatment of injuries. Leavell delivered his younger brother in 1926.\n\n...Higginbotham said he remembers attorney W.B. Limerick, whose name can also be found on an office door. Attorney Joe Rolfe White also had an office in the building, he recalls.\n\n...The precise age of the Jax Building remains unknown. However, Higginbotham said he believes it was built by the construction company of A.G. McBride, who served as Bastrop mayor in the mid-1920s.\n\nRae B.

Later sold the business to the Bell Telephone Co. He returned to Georgia where he served many years in the State House of Representatives. He was involved in promoting out of state sales of watermelons and cane syrup. After serving as legislator, he served as advisor to the State Dept. of Agriculture. Was involved in designing and selling farm tools and implements. He was an originator of the farmer's market movement in GA.-He developed a farm to market system which was the first such merchandising method adopted in the state of GA and in the US. He sold out his interest in these markets and organized the \"Barwick Hoe and Cane Stripper Co\" . He then sold this out and organized a wholesale soft drink business and became active in the merchandising of syrup in GA. He was offered a position with Bell Telephone System to go to Washington, DC as their representative, but he refused. He was deeply interested in the Confederate History and went around the state placing markers on the graves of Confederate soldiers.. During the final period of his career, he was associated with the Dept of Agriculture. He also worked at getting the monthly pension of widows of the veterans of the War Between the States, raised from $30 to $50 /monthly.\n\nInformation taken from \"Atlanta and Environs - Family and Personal History\"\n\nAnother very interesting note--James was business partners for a time with Isaac E Barwick of Wildwood, Sumpter Co, Fl.

Rev. Homer Carpenter was the officiating minister. Miss Stella Brown, of Danville, presided at the organ, assisted by Mr. Robert McKee, of London, on the violin, who rendered several beautiful selections during the assembling of the guests. The wedding was very brilliant and beautiful and an interesting event in Central Kentucky as both bride and groom are well known and very popular. Miss Leavell is a graduate of Hamilton College and one of our most talented, popular girls. She is an artist of ability and is also possessed with a beautiful voice.\n\n..The church was handsomely decorated with holly, mistletoe and laurel, the pulpit being filled with palms, ferns and other plants and bordered with ferns, making a high tropical bank of green, back of the wedding party. Just in front of this was a semi circle made of several columns which were covered with laurel, holly and mistletoe, lighted by many candles. From the two middle columns was suspended a large ball under which the bride and groom stood during the ceremony.\n\n..The bridal chorus from Lohengrin was played for the entrance of the wedding procession. First came Miss Tevla Carpenter, of Stanford, down the left aisle with Dr. John McKee, of London, down the right. They were followed alternately by Miss Ollie Smith and Mr. Roy Brown, of London. Then came the bride with her sister, Miss Lillian Leavell, who was maid of honor. At the same time, the bridegroom with his best man, Mr. George Smith, of London, entered from the rear of the church. The couple, joining, stood before the minister, with maid of honor and best man on each side and the bridesmaids and groomsmen forming a semi circle and making a very attractive picture. During the ceremony Mr. Robert McKee played a violin solo, \"Call Me Thine Own.\"\n\n..The bride was beautiful in her exquisite robe of white chiffon, over silk and trimmed with Duchess lace. Her tulle veil was artistically arranged and she carried a large bouquet of white carocations and bride roses.\n\n..The maid of honor, Miss Lillian Leavell, was beautifully gowned in pale yellow and carried yellow chrysanthemums. The bridesmaids looked charming in white net over white silk with yellow sashes, made into chrysanthemums, and carried yellow chrysanthemums.\n\n..For the departure from the church, the Mendelssohn's wedding march sounded joyful notes. Immediately Mr. and Mrs. Smith left for their bridal tour and the happy couple were accompanied by many loving wishes for success and happiness.\n\nSource Citation: Year: 1920; Census Place: Prairie, Washington, Arkansas; Roll: T625_84; Page: 7A; Enumeration District: 147; Image: 616.
