The Shenandoah valley wasn't big on Indian things. One thing I'd like to mention of Uncle Wythe. He died when I was 28. I grew up knowing him. He really looked short, darker than ScotsIrish and had large lips. He didn't look exactly black or Native American. He was very wide faced and pudgy as well. He's the one who kept listing different folks for his Dad.\n\n[BI22229] The Augusta Birth record,page 681, for Wythe Dovenion Nuckols,born 4/18/18 94, lists his mother as Sarah Nuckols,no father is listed.\n\n[NI22230] He had been married to an Agnor before getting divorced and going to prison all before Estaline.James J. Harlow abandons Estaline to work in a coal mine in PA. He was an ex convict who had served time in the Virginia Pen for raping a 17 y.o. girl near Lexington. Estaline didn't get along well with James Harlow and supposedly ran him off per oral history. She saw no need to get a divorce. He supposedly suffered from depression and could not find work outside of the home. When he left in about 1907, he was going to find employment in Pa. coal mines. But from 1890 to about 1900, the US and Virginia in particular were in an economic depression. Rumor has it that he was in an mining accident and used the alias of an uncle \"Noble Harlow\" (James Noble Harlow) to claim a Civil War pension in the Johnstown PA area and later died as a disabled veteran in about 1909.

She worked as a bookkeeper for her entire career and, settling in Belleville, Lois and her husband Bill made a life with each other for over 40 years. Their love for their family and friends showed in the countless hours spent hosting holiday meals and summer BBQs in their backyard garden oasis. Inside, plants, birdhouses, hummingbird figurines, Lois' paintings and Bill's stained glass pieces brought nature indoors, a family collaboration over the years. Lois also took pride in her daughters and their family closeness, no matter the distance.Last year Lois finally cut back, instead directing her helpers in planting her annual garden and with holiday meals, but it was still Lois because it was family. We already miss you.Lois was preceded in death by her husband, Charles \"Bill\" Nuckolls; parents, Jesse John and Josephine Ann, nee Strawhun, Grayson; three sisters, Velma Sodam, Wanda Beckner, and Jessie Ann Baxter; three brothers-in-law, Rodney Beckner, Bill Baxter, and John Whittler; and stepson, William \"Willie\" Nuckolls.Lois is survived by her daughters, Debra Jean (Brian) Morganstern of Annapolis, Mo., and Karen Sue (Mark) Shands of Belleville, Ill.; sister, Geraldine Whitter of Tiptonville, Tenn.; brother-in-law, George Sodam of O'Fallon, Ill.; stepson, Robert (Barb) Ashley of Derry, N.H.; grandson, Scott C.

Nuckolls said that his brother and 72-year-old Walter Johnson took off from Upland, Calif., and conducted a flyby over a friend's house in Tehachapi.Nuckolls told 23ABC that neighbors said the men flew away and moments later they heard the crash.Nuckolls said neighbors ran to the site and tried to put out the fire by stomping on it, but it was too big.Several neighbors reported seeing the Cessna fly very low with the landing gear down, Nuckolls told 23ABC. While there is no official cause to the crash yet, neighbors said the plane caught a wind gust that put it in a nose dive. The National Transportation Safety Board reached the site of the crash on Monday. The wreckage was pulled away to a hangar on Monday. Nuckolls said his brother was from Claremont, Calif., and leaves behind a wife and three children.\n\nNTSB confirms witnesses reported plane \"buzzed\" home\n\nBY jason kotowski Californian staff writer\n\njkotowski@bakersfield.com | Wednesday, Sep 07 2011 10:30 PM\n\nThe plane circled a house and then dropped into the canyon, and Donna Moran had a feeling it wasn't coming back out.It was flying too low. Plus, pilots never head into the canyon, and for good reason, Moran said.She became concerned as soon as the craft turned south instead of north back toward Mountain Valley Airport, and before long her fears of disaster were realized.\"You could hear trees cracking and then kind of a boom, and then the fire started,\" she said Wednesday.\n\nThat fire, named the Canyon Fire, has scorched more than 14,000 acres since Sunday morning's crash and destroyed a dozen homes and 18 other buildings in Old West Ranch near Tehachapi. The two people aboard the plane were killed.\n\nWhile it could take six months to a year for the National Traffic Safety Board to conclude its investigation of the cause of the crash, witnesses have said the pilot flew low over a friend's house by way of greeting -- an activity called \"buzzing\" -- just before the crash.NTSB spokesman Nicholas Worrell confirmed Wednesday that investigators had received reports that the plane was buzzing a home before the crash.With an investigation that could take months, it's too early to know whether that action contributed to the crash.Moran, the witness, said the pilot circled the home and quickly \"wiggled\" the plane's wings by tilting one way and then the other. A newspaper was thrown from the craft, she said.Moran's three brothers are pilots, and one of them buzzes her home whenever he flies over, but he never descends as low as Sunday's plane, she said.And she said she's never heard of a pilot going into the canyon at Old West Ranch.Trace Robey, another crash witness, said winds in the canyon are strong enough to impair a plane's ability to climb. She's never witnessed someone buzz a house before, but since Sunday neighbors have told her it's a common practice.It's not one Robey approves of.\"I want it to be well known that (buzzing) is not acceptable to us,\" she said of the Old West Ranch community.The plane's engines sounded fine and there was no indication the plane was struggling leading up to the crash, Robey said.Buzzing is a practice as old as aviation itself.Some pilots do it, some don't, and to get an accurate answer on just how prevalent the practice is you'd have to ask individual pilots, said Michael Harmon, general manager of the Rocket Shop Cafe on South Union Avenue.Harmon's father, John Harmon, is a longtime fixture at Bakersfield Municipal Airport with his Harmon Rocket LLC kit airplane company.\"It's just simply flying over an area to get someone's attention,\" Michael Harmon said.Worrell of the NTSB did not immediately have statistics on buzzing, and wasn't sure if that was something the NTSB tracked.\n\nThe victims\n\nThe two men killed in the crash have been identified as Walter Johnson, 72, of Pomona, and John Nuckolls, 55, of Claremont. It's not yet known who was the pilot. Nuckolls' brother, Steve Nuckolls, said his brother and Johnson took off from Upland and flew over a friend's house in Tehachapi, according to KERO Channel 23. He told KERO that neighbors reported seeing the men flying very low with the landing gear down.Nuckolls told KERO that his brother leaves behind a wife and three children.A representative of Johnson's family contacted The Californian Wednesday and said the family was waiting to learn more about the crash before speaking to the media.Worrell of the NTSB said the wreckage has been recovered and taken to Pearblossom, Calif., where investigators will examine it.
