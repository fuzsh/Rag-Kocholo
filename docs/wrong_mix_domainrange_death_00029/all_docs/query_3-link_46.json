        "text": "We’ve compiled a list of frequently asked questions for your convenience below. If you would like to connect with a member of our literary staff, please reach out via email tolitoffice@theoneill.org. Please note, the literary office may be remote for the application and selection process—so email is strongly preferred.\n\nCan you tell me more about the selection process?\n\nThe National Playwrights Conference accepts scripts from playwrights of all stripes and remains committed to an open, blind submission and selection process. We receive approximately 1000+ submissions annually. Of the initial submission pool, about 20-25% will be moved forward to the Semifinalist round of consideration. Roughly 20% of the NPC Semifinalists — or, 5% of total submissions — proceed to the Finalist round each year. From this pool of approximately 75 to 100 Finalists, a select number of plays are selected for development in the National Playwrights Conference.\n\nWho will read my play?\n\nEvery play shared with NPC is guaranteed at least one full read by a member of our corps of readers. Directors and dramaturgs, actors and designers, critics and educators, 100+ theater makers all familiar with the O’Neill developmental process will read each submission in its entirety. Every script is considered with care and appreciation, undergoing a rigorous evaluation process in which form, content, and developmental goals are considered. The O’Neill literary office carefully manages this process. Submissions that move to the Semifinalist round of consideration are also reviewed by the Artistic Council, comprised of a select group of theater professionals including playwrights, directors, dramaturgs, and the O’Neill artistic staff.\n\nWhen can I expect to hear back from you?\n\nThe O’Neill Literary Office will send every applicant a status notification email on a rolling basis between early March and late May. Please know that we endeavor to respond to all inquiries and applications in a timely fashion. You can expect any communication about the status of your application to arrive via email directly from the O’Neill literary office.\n\nIf selected, how long is the residency?\n\nIn addition to your developmental workshop, the National Playwrights Conference requests that participating writers stay in residence for the entirety of the month-long Conference. We welcome you to use this time however you see fit. Many playwrights continue to reflect and revise their play while others begin new projects, and others still use this time to recharge. Playwrights in residence are welcome to attend the rehearsals, readings, and presentations of their peers' work, as well as their own: we’ve found that one of the most valuable elements of an O’Neill summer is its strong community of fellow writers, artists, and theater-makers, which endures long after the summer conferences have drawn to a close.\n\nOf course, we understand that you might need to attend family events and business trips — and we’ll note that Mondays are our weekly off-day. Still, the expectation for participating playwrights is that the majority of their time during the National Playwrights Conference will be spent in residence with the O’Neill community.\n\n​\n\nDo you accept work from international writers?\n\nYes. NPC gladly accepts—and has developed—work by playwrights from around the globe. We’ll note that the script submitted must be accessible to English-speaking readers. To participate in the National Playwrights Conference, international writers must have the right to work in the United States. Unfortunately, our small staff size precludes the O’Neill from assisting with visa applications; however, previous applicants have foundthe resources on the U.S. Department of State's website useful.\n\nWhen you say that submissions must not have had a “professional production” prior to July 31, 2024, what exactly do you mean? (Or, “I had a developmental opportunity with X, Y, Z, qualities. Is my piece still eligible?”)\n\nThe O’Neill requires that all scripts submitted to the National Playwrights Conference remain without professional production until July 31, 2024. For our purposes, a professional production means that the artists working on the show were compensated for their time, and that all of the theatrical elements that one hopes to see—light, set, sound, costume, etc.—were present. A few notes:\n\nIf your play had a reading or a workshop, or if scripts were still in your actors’ hands at the time of the performance, we do not consider that a “professional production.” However, please note that you will need to share the play’s full development history on your NPC application—any previous readings or workshops included.\n\nIf your play was produced by a college or university theater, we do not consider that a “professional production.”\n\nIf your play was fully produced but the artists were not compensated, we do not consider that a “professional production.”\n\nIf your play was produced but the production lacked significant and necessary theatrical elements—a Zoom reading, stage lighting, projections, or puppets, for instance—we do not consider that a “professional production.”\n\nI don’t consider it a “musical,” but my play has music in it. Should I submit it to the National Playwrights Conference or the National Music Theater Conference?\n\nOur rule of thumb is: If developing the musical world of the play is your primary developmental goal, it's likely a better fit for the National Music Theater Conference. Conversely, if your focus is on revising the text of your script, then the National Playwrights Conference would be a more appropriate developmental home for it — in no small part because the National Playwrights Conference is unable to provide robust musical support for participating projects. To learn more about the National Music Theater Conference and its application process, please visit the NMTC webpage here.\n\nCan I submit more than one play?\n\nNo and yes. When we say that “Only one play may be submitted by a single writer each year,” we’re referring to the single writer as a unique writing team. You may only submit one play. However, You and Writing Partner A would comprise an additional unique writing team — and would therefore be eligible to submit an additional play. Similarly, You and Writing Partner B would comprise another unique writing team, and would also be welcome to submit an additional work.\n\nWhat kind of play is the O’Neill looking for? Or: \"I have one play that has A, B, and C qualities, and another play that has X, Y, and Z qualities. Which should I submit?\"\n\nThe National Playwrights Conference proudly supports all styles and genres of theater, including one-acts and solo pieces. We would encourage you to worry less about submitting the kind of play you imagine the O’Neill would like to develop, and instead think deeply about which of your plays would benefit most from the resources the O’Neill would be able to provide during your residency.\n\nSo you accept one-person plays and solo shows?\n\nYes. We welcome one-person plays and consider them fully.\n\nHow about one-act plays?\n\nYes. We’ll note that the most successful of these tend to be approximately 60 minutes in length, and are designed to be the main event of an evening. (Ten-minute plays do not fare well.)\n\nDo you have a minimum or maximum page requirement?\n\nNo. We have no formal requirements regarding the maximum or minimum page length for submissions—but, we are happy to share that our more successful scripts tend to range in length from approximately 50 to 150 pages.\n\nDo you accept resubmissions or revised drafts?\n\nYes. Though we would prefer to spend time with your latest work, we do accept scripts that have been previously submitted to the National Playwrights Conference. We do ask, however, that the work has been significantly revised — which tends to mean that substantial changes to the story and its telling have been made since it was last shared with us.\n\nDo you accept adaptions?\n\nYes. We accept adaptations, provided that the rights to any material not in the public domain are granted in writing and that a copy of this permission is shared with our offices. Please email a copy of this permission directly to litoffice@theoneill.org after submitting your script.\n\nDoes my play need to be formatted in any specific way?\n\nNo. We recognize that plays come in all kinds of different shapes and sizes — and that scripts do, too. We only require that your name and contact information (and agent information, if applicable) is removed from the script, that you include a character breakdown with both age and gender, and that you include page numbers.\n\nWhat should my character breakdown look like?\n\nWe ask that your breakdown include each character’s name, any doubling schemes should they occur, and any traits that you deem necessary for casting. These traits include but are not limited to: age, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, disability, etc. Beyond that, any information or notes that you wish to share about your cast of characters is welcome, but not necessary.\n\nCan I include an author’s note in my script?\n\nYes, as long as it remains anonymous. Please only include information that you believe is crucial to the reader’s understanding of your play.\n\nWhat do you mean by “Developmental Goals”?\n\nThis is an opportunity for you to share how the specific resources provided by the National Playwrights Conference can help advance your draft. The O’Neill provides selected playwrights with a director, dramaturg, and access to a professional equity cast. In addition to your dedicated rehearsal week and reading, you’ll have access to housing, writing spaces, and library resources on the O’Neill’s campus. This is your opportunity to let us know how these resources can best serve your process and this particular play. For instance, do you hope to examine a specific character arc with the help of a dramaturg? Are you curious about how the ending of your play lands on an audience? What part of the play or dramaturgical question can professional actors help you excavate? These goals are shared with our readers and help them understand how you speak about your work and process as a writer.\n\nIt should be about a page in length, but shorter is fine, too. There are no formatting requirements for this section (save for the length as mentioned above), so you are welcome to provide a list, paragraphs, a visual element, a chart, etc.\n\n​\n\nBear in mind that this is an opportunity to engage with your readers about the material that they have just read, so there’s no need to include a blow-by-blow account of the plot or worry about spoilers. Please do not list any identifying information such as previous workshop locations or previous collaborators in this space.\n\nShould my biographical statement be anonymous?\n\nNo. Please include your name and any other pertinent identifying information in your biographical statement: this document is for internal use only, and will not be shared with our reading team. Your biographical statement should give us a sense of your path in playwriting or theater-making more broadly—like you might see in a playbill. It should be no more than one page in length.\n\nHow do I make a PDF?\n\nWe are only able to accept scripts in PDF format. Fortunately, the vast majority of word processors—including Microsoft Word, Final Draft, GoogleDocs, and Pages—will allow you to convert your document to a PDF by clicking on the tab, “Save as PDF.” Once you have done so, simply upload the new PDF of your script as directed on our online application form.\n\nHow do I pay the application fee?\n\nYou will be guided through the payment process step-by-step as you finalize your online application. The application allows you to use both debit and credit cards. If you run into any issues regarding the acceptance of your payment, please contact support@submittable.com.\n\nCan I expect feedback on my submission?\n\nUnfortunately, our small staff size and the sheer number of applications we receive precludes us from giving individual feedback on script submissions.\n\nMy submission is listed as “Accepted” or \"Complete\" on Submittable. What does that mean?\n\nWhen your NPC application is listed as “Accepted” or \"Complete\" on Submittable, it means that your application has been successfully submitted and accepted for review by the O’Neill literary office. If your script is accepted for development in our upcoming summer Conference, you will hear from us directly via email no later than May 2024.\n\nWhere else should I submit my play?\n\nThough the O’Neill does not maintain a directory of script submission opportunities nationwide, we are happy to recommend those of the New Play Exchange, the Dramatists Guild Resource Directory, the Playwrights' Center, and the Play Submissions Helper."
