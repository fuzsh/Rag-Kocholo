        "text": "Bountiful: the Memoirs of Charles E. McNeil\n\nby Charles E. McNeil\n\nwith Eugene LeVert\n\nChapter One\n\nEighty miles northeast of Mobile, in the cotton country of Monroe County, there was a little settlement where a Baptist minister named James Jones built a home and a sawmill in 1888. From his sawmill came the lumber that built a few homes and the first store of the hamlet known as Jones Mill. When the FriscoRailroad came through, a station-stop was built beside the mill and the little hamlet began to grow into a town they called Frisco City.\n\nFrisco City was essentially one main street in 1921, the year I was born. That street was an unpaved road lined with stores built of wood or brick, one block from the railroad station. One of those stores bore the sign O. McNeil’s General Merchandise and Plantation Supplies. “O” was for “Oscar,” my father’s first name. This was his store. In it he stocked everything the town needed: food, clothing, shoes, hardware, tin, roofing, fencing, pliers, rope. Everything.\n\nDaddy was a real, real fine merchant and a fine gentleman. He had beautiful skin, almost pink it was so pretty. I never recall him leaving the house to go to work without a vest and coat and tie — and a hat on. Every time he left home he was completely dressed. He was that way his whole life. Daddy didn’t do anything but work. He just worked all time. His father had been a farmer. From him he learned how to work hard, how to save, no matter what. Daddy had only a third-grade education.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, friends or farmers would come into the store, needing food or clothing or supplies, which they’d have to charge, and some would run up big debts. Sometimes Daddy would take mortgages on their places. He gave these back when folks couldn’t pay them off. He always said that if they didn’t have any means to pay a mortgage, they didn’t have any means to make a living, so he couldn’t take their property. After the Depression, he ended up with books that held thousands and thousands of dollars in debts he simply canceled. More often, though, he found a way to work things out.\n\nMy father was a very good businessman. With the profit he made fromhis store, he put together three parcels of land amounting to 150 acres. He would furnish the seed and the fertilizer. He would let sharecroppers furnish the labor. They’d raise cotton and corn and share the proceeds. Profits from this allowed Daddy to build and rent out two other stores in Frisco City. That’s how he supported a wife and five children. That’s how he put us children through college.\n\nMy mother ran the household, of course. She oversaw meals with the help of a cook named Mamie Smith, who lived right back of our house. Mama also had a servant named Lucy Green who helped her with the washing and cleaning. Mama was an excellent seamstress. She had a sewing machine, and made button-up shirts for us boys and all of my sister’s dresses. In those days, little girls wore dresses cut below the knee with a big ribbon around the waist. Mama would get patterns and material from Daddy’s store and make every kind of dress you could imagine. She tied ribbons in my sister’s wavy hair.\n\nI was the youngest of four boys, born October 2, 1921. My oldest brother, Leighton, was about ten years older than I was. The next oldest, Felix, was three or four years younger than Leighton. Then came John Albert, three or four years younger than Felix. My sister, Margaret, was two years younger than I. She was petite and very pretty. We all called her “Sister.” She and I were very close. We did everything together, growing up. When we were older, Mama wouldn’t let Sister go on a date unless I went along. On Sunday afternoons, Sister and I would drive in the car, visiting her friends or my friends, but we’d always be together. On Sunday afternoons, we’d drive over to the picture show in Monroeville, five miles away. But I’m getting ahead of myself — I’ll come back to this later.\n\nI don’t remember my father’s father. Although we’ve traced the McNeil family all the way back to Scotland, to a castle called “Barra,” and we thought we know the American McNeils came down out of the Carolinas, I never knew my granddaddy McNeil. I suppose he had died by the time I came along. I do remember going to visit my mother’s father, though. His name was John White. He traded mules and horses at what they called “The Ridge,” up in the northern part of Monroe County, between Monroeville and Peterman. He had a pomegranate tree in his front yard. When we’d go visit, my sister and I would pick pomegranates from that tree and get red juice all over us.\n\nIf you go through Frisco City today, you’ll find it’s about the same size that it was eighty years ago. The stores along the main street have changed, and that street is paved, but it’s still a small town surrounded by cotton fields and corn fields and pasture land. At the edge of town on Highway 21, headed toward Monroeville, is what used to be Lawyer McGinney’s house. Next to that is the old McWilliams place. J. J. McWilliams and his wife were my parents’ closest friends when I was growing up. We children called Mr. McWilliams “Cousin J. J.” and his wife “Cousin Maude,” though of course they weren’t our cousins. Before my father built his own store, he and Mr. McWilliams had owned a store together. They built it in the early 1900s, a big two-story wooden structure that later burned. Once a week, the McWilliams would come over to our house and play Rook. Cousin J. J. and Daddy played against Cousin Maude and Mama. They had some spirited games.\n\nWe lived next door to the McWilliamses. My father told me that he contracted to have our house and picket fence built for eleven hundred dollars, complete. The original house had three bedrooms, a living room, dining room, kitchen, and front and back porches. Later on he added a bathroom and two sleeping porches. On the back of the house was the boys’ sleeping porch. It had sixteen windows in it, and one of its walls adjoined my mother’s and father’s sleeping porch, which was located on the side of the house. Their porch had twelve windows in it. These windows kept us cool in the long summers and warm autumns. There was a grove of oak trees in front of the house, and oak trees and pecan trees around the house for shade. There were rose bushes and shrubs in the yard. Later, Daddy added a concrete walkway from the front porch steps to the street.\n\nIn the days when I was a child, we didn’t have a big green lawn. The yard was packed dirt, like all yards at that time. The leaves were swept out with a broom made from the branches of a mulberry bush. Years later, after they’d developed grasses that would grow under trees, such as zoysia grass, my father went to buy some at Auburn University. He planted it in the side yard under some pecan trees and it grew beautifully.\n\nWe used the sleeping porches year round. We had open fireplaces for heat. In the morning, Daddy would knock on the sleeping porch wall to wake me up. My job was to get up and build the fire. That’s the way the mornings would start, just before daylight: knocking on the side of the wall, “Charlie Boy, get up!” I’d get up and go in the sitting room to build a fire in the fireplace. The sitting room was right beside my parents’ sleeping porch. We used coal for heating in those days. The coal would come in big lumps. I’d go outside to the coal pile, take an axe and use the blunt end to break the pieces up, then put the coal in a pail and take it in. I’d use ‘fat’ wood, heart of pine — “lighter” we called it — to start the fire.\n\nMamie would have some coffee going shortly. For breakfast she usually fixed us biscuits and grits and eggs. And sausage. We killed hogs for the sausage, stored it in a smokehouse in the yard. Usually it was patty sausage, hand-ground. The patties were stored in a clay urn, layer on layer, precooked, with grease poured over them to seal them and preserve them. You could keep sausages this way for months. In the morning Mamie would dip those sausages out and reheat them. The house smelled so good.\n\nI think I was Daddy’s favorite. I was just real close to him. Until I was twelve years old and moved to the boys’ sleeping porch, I slept with him. At the table, he would seat me at the head, and he would sit to my right. The rest of my brothers would sit around the table on the side. Mama and Sister would usually serve the food. After the men had been served, they would sit down to eat. That was the custom in those days. It was also the custom to refer to the meals of the day as breakfast, dinner, and supper — not breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nI sat beside my father in church, the First Baptist Church. His favorite hymn was “The Old Rugged Cross.” He didn’t have the best voice in the world, but he loved to sing that hymn and I think he did it quite well. He taught me to sing it along with him. My family always went to Sunday school and church. On Wednesday nights we attended the prayer meeting. My brothers and sister and I belonged to the Baptist Young People’s Christian Union. The church, the faith, was just central to our family life. And we were a very, very close family.\n\nDaddy and Mr. McWilliams were both very active in the building of the First Baptist Church of Frisco City. For as long as I can remember, Daddy served as a deacon, as did Mr. McWilliams. In the old days, a preacher often needed another job besides his ministry to support himself. On Mondays, Daddy would walk on one side of the street and Mr. McWilliams would walk on the other side, and they’d collect from all the businesses fifty cents, or a dollar, or two dollars — whatever they could collect — to pay the preacher. Whatever church expenses there were beyond the collection, Daddy and Mr. McWilliams would make up the difference.\n\nThe main congregations in town were Baptist and Methodist. Mrs. McWilliams, incidentally, belonged to the Methodist Church. I don’t recall any Catholic families. There was one Jewish family named Lewis. Mr. Lewis was a merchant who rented one of my father’s stores. I forget what his business was, but I recall a lot of hats in his store. Anyway, the Lewis family attended the First Baptist Church. They were members of our church.\n\nFor dinner on Sundays Mamie would fix fried chicken and mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables. We had a large garden. Daddy saw to the planting of it and Mamie’s husband, I think, helped tend it. We grew corn, okra, tomatoes, purple hull peas, climbing beans, butter beans. We kept our own chickens, too. The coop was out behind the house. A lot of times it was my chore to catch the chicken and wring its neck. You had to be careful after you’d wrung the hen’s neck because, when you flung her down on the ground, she’d flop around spewing blood and it could get all over you. Doesn’t sound pleasant, does it? I’d give the hen to Mamie, who would dip her in some hot water, then begin picking the feathers off.\n\nI loved fried chicken and mashed potatoes. But I did not eat okra. I did not eat okra because my father didn’t eat okra. If he didn’t eat anything, I was pretty sure I wasn’t going to eat it. But the rest of the family liked it. Daddy just didn’t and I didn’t either.\n\nFor dessert, Mamie often made pies with lots of meringue. Or we’d have vanilla ice cream that she had hand-cranked. When we didn’t have desserts, there were always sweets on the table. There were delicious preserves because we had pear trees and fig trees. When I remember Mama sitting on the back porch, peeling pears for preserves, I recall how she’d wrap her finger with a little piece of cloth to keep it from blistering. There was honey and syrup on the table. We also had blackberry or mayhaw jelly. When the mayhaw berries were ripe, we’d gather them by spreading a sheet beneath the tree and shaking the berries down onto the sheet.\n\nAfter Sunday dinner, I’d run out with the boys my age to play in the woods below Frisco City. I’d call a couple of the Sims boys who lived across the street — Jack, or Johnny Mack — and off we’d go. We’d play cowboys and Indians, or we’d build a fort and defend it by throwing dirt clods. There was a lot of sandy clay in those beautiful woods. We had the run of them. In the springs and summers and way into fall we ran barefooted. We never gave a second thought to snakes or anything else. There was nothing much to worry about.\n\nIn the 1920s, the world was vastly different from today. Remember Mr. Jones’s mill? I think our town grew up around it because there you could gin cotton, mill corn, and saw timber. Those were essential things for trade, for food, for building — essential things for the life of any Southern town. And until the railway went by that mill, Frisco City was an island of self-sufficiency, as were most towns in America back then.\n\nWhen I was a boy, the mill still ran on steam, the same thing that ran the first trains across the nation, rolling north and south, connecting east and west. Mr. Jones had an old boiler in one corner of the mill yard, fed by an open fire. The boiler piped steam to a piston engine nearby. I suppose this simple design let him keep any trouble with the boiler from spreading to the engine. You wouldn’t want both of them blowing up! On the engine was a flywheel. Mr. Jones would run a canvas-reinforced rubber belt from that flywheel to his three operations in the several corners of the yard. He would hook that belt to the cotton gin if he was ginning. He’d hook it to the sawblade if he was cutting wood. He’d hook it to the gristmill if he was grinding corn.\n\nAt the gristmill, I remember, you would pour corn into a big hopper at the top and it would flow down to these big stone wheels that went grinding ‘round and ‘round against each other and flow on down into sacks at the bottom. There was a rig that let you calibrate some fraction of an inch between those wheels to get the grind you wanted on your corn — wider would make grits, closer would make meal. The wheels would heat up with the corn they were grinding. I remember how good that corn smelled as it was being ground, so warm and so fresh!\n\nThis is the world I was born into. It was a simple world, a simple time. It happened that the train that shipped cotton and hardware into my father’s store would eventually ship me off to the Midwest to train as a pilot. I would go to war. And I would be lucky enough to come home to a woman who loved me and raise a family.\n\nIt is hard to think of so many things at once but my life has been blessed. I want to think about a few things at a time in these pages. When things are simple, their outlines plain, you can see them very clearly.\n\nChapter Two\n\nLet me tell you about Christmas to show how simple those times were. Before electricity came to town, I recall the stores of Frisco City decorated with bows. I do not remember Christmas trees or Christmas stockings at home. On Christmas Eve, Mama and Daddy would put a crate beside the fireplace — an orange crate or an apple crate — for Santa to put our presents in. Christmas morning we’d wake to find that Santa had brought us an orange or an apple and maybe some walnuts. Also an item of clothing. And a toy. Not toys, mind you: a toy.\n\nFor clothing, you might get a cap or overalls. In those days boys wore overalls and caps all the time. Railroad caps were popular. They were made of heavy striped canvas. As for the toy, I think Santa might have given me my first pocketknife.\n\nBoys always carried a pocketknife. We liked to whittle. One of the best whittlers I knew was my cousin Louis Mason. On the way to school in the morning, he’d cut a limb off a bush, a limb maybe an inch in diameter. He’d work on that limb during the day, sitting in class, and when we’d walk home in the afternoon, he would hand it to me. It would be a wooden chain. And inside each of the little links of that chain would be a tiny ball that he’d whittled out.\n\nWe whittled our own tops. You would take a small block of wood and drive a nail into the center of it to make the pivot. Then you’d start whittling around on it and when you got it the right size, you’d start rounding it off, tapering it down toward the pivot. This would take a day or two. Then you’d make a notch at the top of the cone, where you anchored the string, so that the top would have a quick release when you threw it. You’d tie a knot in one end of your string, to go into that notch, and you’d tie a washer on the other end, to slip between your fingers, to anchor the string in your hand. Then you could let ‘er rip.\n\nWhen we played tops, we’d find a patch of hard-packed dirt and draw a ring on the ground. That’s where you and your opponent fought it out. The winner would be the one whose top spun longest inside that circle. But there was some strategy to the game. When you threw your top, you tried to throw it so that it would bust a piece off your opponent’s top, or even split it. I often played a boy named Earl Sawyer who busted my tops all the time. He was good!\n\nI remember my brothers getting in a fight one time over tops. One of them had busted the other’s top and made him angry. Felix wound up swinging the washer-end of his string at John Albert and hitting him in the forehead. It cut him quite severely. Blood went splattering all over his face. I recall being scared when I saw all that blood. I vividly remember that — it was just a horrible thing for me. Well, Mama got John Albert quieted down, and Mamie cleaned the wound with kerosene. She tore up a clean rag and tied it for a bandage around John Albert’s head. He wore a cap over it for a couple of days.\n\nAs long as the weather was warm we went barefoot. From the spring into the fall. Except for Sundays, of course. Dress shoes on Sundays. We got our dress shoes from Daddy’s store. The best pairs went for $4.50 or $5.00 a pair, I think. We also got our everyday shoes from the store. They were high-tops with thick soles, called brogans. Daddy carried a line of them called Red Star made by the International Shoe Company.\n\nWhen I was little, I had a little shoeshine stand outside Daddy’s store. Mama gave me a cloth and Daddy gave me a brush, a can of black polish, a can of brown polish, and I’d shine shoes on Saturdays — a nickel a shine. I think I bought candy with the money I made. I liked jawbreakers.\n\nAt the first cold snap of winter, it was hog killing time. Your neighbors would come by on hog killing days because butchering took a few hands. The hogs had been fattened up. They were quite large. Somebody would shoot the hog through the ear with a small-caliber rifle, or knock it in the head with the blunt end of an axe. Then the men would dip it down in a big barrel of scalding hot water to loosen the hair. Once the hog was strung up, head down on a big wooden frame, they’d cut the throat and bleed the hog into a big bucket and scrape the hair off. The lard was going to be cooked out of the skin, you see. You also made cracklins out of the skin, so you’d have to scrape the hair off with a scraper and a stiff brush. Next they would gut the hog. They would take the intestines and run water through them with a hose to clean them out. Then they would turn these entrails inside out before cutting them up to make chitlins. Some of the intestines they used as casings for link sausage. They would cook those in cast-iron washpots out in the yard. They would cut hams and hang them in the smokehouse. Slabs of bacon too. We didn’t save many pork chops. We usually ground them up — the loins too, I think. I believe all of that went into sausage. You can imagine how rich that sausage was.\n\nThe smokehouse was very, very small. It was vented on the sides and on the top. Inside it had hooks to hang the bacon and ham. In the middle was a metal bin where they put the hickory or pecan wood to cure the meat. Once they started the fire, it would smolder twenty-four hours a day. They just closed the door, went off and left it. Some of the help tended the fire. Once the meat was cured, we’d keep it in the smokehouse through the winter. That’s where we stored the urns of patty sausage too.\n\nOne of the wintertime chores I did not like was milking the cow. We kept our own cow for milk and cream, of course. I think Daddy was the first man in that part of the world to buy a good-blooded milk cow that would produce enough milk so that we could sell some. It was a fine animal. It made all the butter and all the milk you could ever need. But I didn’t like milking that cow in the wintertime. Your hands got very cold because you had to wash the udder off and dry it before you milked. I suppose the cold water was hard on the old cow, too! You’d sit on a stool with the pail positioned between your legs and under the udder. You would catch a teat with your thumb crooked down, catch it between your four fingers and your thumb. Then you’d run your hand down the teat. All you were doing was just squeezing between your forefingers and your thumb, squeezing the milk out, and it went into the pail, zoo, zoo, zoo…. Slow, patient work with cold hands in the winter time.\n\nYou had to strain the milk after you finished. You were milking in a barn, and the cow was always swooshing her tail around, sometimes stamping her feet, so things would get into the bucket with the milk. You strained the milk through a cloth when you poured it into pitchers. It was beautiful milk, silky, pearly white. You’d let the milk sit in the pitchers and the cream would rise to the top. You would skim that off into a churn for making buttermilk. The clots of buttermilk you’d put into a press to squeeze into cakes of butter. When the older milk turned to clabber, you could pour the clabber into a cheesecloth and hang it on the clothesline to drip. That’s how you made cream cheese. It was delicious to put sugar and sweet cream over fresh cream cheese! Another snack I loved was to take fresh cream and pour it in a plate with some syrup and put a piece of fresh bread in it: that was good.\n\nWe kept the milk and cream in an icebox — the non-electric kind where you put ice in the top of it yourself. It was a big block, twenty-five or more pounds. Daddy would get it from the icehouse down the street. I think they used a diesel engine to power the icehouse.\n\nWe didn’t keep meat in the summertime. Without electricity there was no way. We had one man in town who would butcher beef. He would butcher a calf and put it on a wagon that was screened to keep the flies off. Since there was no refrigeration, he had to sell all the meat that morning, right after he butchered it. He’d start at one end of the street and go all the way to the other end, passing by the houses, ringing a bell. You’d come out to see what you wanted and bargain for it.\n\nI remember Mama asking Daddy for some money for meat one day. “How much?” he said. She said, “I need thirty-five cents to buy,” and he said, “I don’t have thirty-five cents.” “Well, I’ve got to have some meat,” she said, because she had seven of us to feed, plus our two servants. Thirty-five cents would buy a lot of meat in those days.\n\nBefore noon that day, the meat was in a big pot stewing with potatoes. I don’t know where Mama got the money, but she got it.\n\nAnother thing sold off the street in those days was aluminum cookware. The vendors would come by and ask to hold a cooking session in your kitchen to demonstrate their pots and pans. They’d ask the lady of the house to invite her neighbors for a big cooking demonstration. I think I still have a piece of aluminum that I must have gotten from my mama after one of those cooking sessions. A heavy, heavy aluminum pan, deep and wide and long.\n\nWe hunted game to put on the table. In those days, hunting was for food, not sport. My brother Felix hunted squirrels all the time. He had a little feist-dog he used for squirrel hunting. He loved to go squirrel hunting. He would go out by himself and he’d come back with eighteen or twenty squirrels. Mamie would brown them, then put them in a pot of water to simmer, cook down. She’d add flour to make gravy and serve the squirrels with grits.\n\nI suppose I was seven or eight years old when I learned to hunt. I started hunting rabbits with an air rifle. I’d go with one of the boys in the neighborhood and we’d walk through the fields till we scared up a rabbit. When I was a little older, Felix taught me more serious hunting. He taught me more than Daddy did because Daddy was always working. Besides squirrels or rabbits, we hunted quail and dove. There were an awful lot of doves. The Middletons had a big field right back of us and we’d take a number-three sized wash tub out there and we’d shoot so many we could fill up that tub. Mama would have Mamie fry up the breasts and serve them smothered in gravy.\n\nWe ate a lot of chicken and fish in the summertime. I remember going down to the Alabama River with Daddy. Sometimes there would be Sunday afternoon fish fries right on the riverbanks near Claiborne. They’d have a big pot of grease boiling on a fire. They’d have wooden tables spread out on sawhorses looked like as far as you could see. Bottles of ketchup and light bread on every table. It looked like the whole countryside would be there, people from town and all over. They would have these long, round nets, big as a room, that they’d stretch out in the river. And they’d haul them up on the banks with these big ropes, and the nets would be full of catfish four or five feet long. Big ol’ catfish. They’d cut them up and fry them in the pot with hushpuppies. I was quite small then. I was interested in running around, playing with all the other children. When we stopped to eat, we had all we could eat. You’d put the fresh-fried catfish on light bread with some ketchup — delicious sandwiches!\n\nWe didn’t swim in the river. It was too fast, too dangerous. I learned to swim, to dog-paddle, in Escambia Creek. It was clear and cold. In one spot along the clay banks where there was a tangle of tree roots, you’d sometimes see water moccasins, but I don’t remember ever having any trouble with them. Boys and girls didn’t swim together there because you just dropped your overalls and jumped in — went skinny dipping. If some mean boy was standing on the bank, you yelled at him, called him a “bank walker,” and he would try to throw mud on you. When you were done swimming, you just put your overalls back on. By the time you got home, you were dry.\n\nWhen we were children we were always sure to be home before dark. One time, though, I wasn’t. That was the one time I remember my father whipping me. I must’ve been eight or nine years old. It was during the late summer because we were through picking and ginning the cotton and the bales were stacked down by the tracks at the railroad station. My friends and I had been playing hide and seek, or catch, or tag around the cotton bales. I played a little too long. Daddy’s instructions were to be home before dark. I had played till after dark. When I realized how late it was, I ran all the way home — down the dirt road, barefooted, maybe a quarter of a mile. When I ran in the front door, I knew I was in trouble. There was my father, walking up and down the living room, waiting for me. He said, “Do you realize what time it is?” Then he wore me out real good — strapping me with a belt, holding onto one arm, and spanking me with the other. It wasn’t cruel. Just to remind me that I made a mistake. He just said, “You worried me and you worried your mother and don’t you ever do this again.” I was never late again either.\n\nI never recall my father getting angry or raising his voice. Never. He had a younger brother named Gus, a strong man. I think he left all the roughness to his brother Gus. He loved us children. He did not show his emotions in an overly demonstrative way, but he loved us children more than anything in the world.\n\nWhen electricity came, Daddy bought a radio. After he closed up the store in the evening, he would come home, and we would gather around the radio to listen to two programs: Fu Manchu and Death Valley Days. Fu Manchu was a mystery program with a Chinese character. It was scary sometimes. “The Twenty-Mule Team Borax Show” had stories with a Western theme. We looked forward to Daddy coming home and gathering around the radio for those two programs.\n\nWe had music in the house before radio, though. Daddy liked music so he bought a player piano. It came with cartons and cartons of rolled-up music. You put the music into the piano and pedaled it and it played. We took turns pedaling it. We played that piano constantly.\n\nMy sister took piano lessons. Mama wanted me to, but I thought that would be a sissy thing to do. In those days men didn’t play the piano. My mother didn’t insist on piano lessons for me, but she wanted me to play some sort of musical instrument, so I tried playing the trumpet. I was about eight or nine years old, I guess, when Mama and Daddy ordered me this trumpet. It was quite a fine instrument, but I never got the hang of it. Blowing it hurt my lips. I suppose I was not musically inclined.\n\nIn the fall there would be square dances in Frisco City. The crops would be in, the air cool, and everyone was feeling festive. The whole town would turn out. People from around the countryside would come. They’d have a caller and three or four fiddlers. They’d gather to dance in one of the vacant buildings downtown. I remember they would sprinkle cornmeal on the wooden floor to make it slide better because people liked to shuffle their feet when they danced. The caller would call out “do-si-do,” and “swing your partner,” and with everyone dancing, the hall would get cloudy with corn dust. It was fun to watch Mama and Daddy and all the adults dancing.\n\nVaudeville shows would also visit town from time to time. They would set up a big tent that would hold a hundred people or more. Inside there would be a wooden stage for the performers and rows of benches for the audience. They’d charge probably ten or fifteen cents for admission. I don’t remember the shows, but I remember the popcorn!\n\nWhen the Ringling Brothers Circus came to Monroe Park in Mobile, Mama and Daddy would take us to see it. That was quite an occasion. The circus was beautiful! I remember watching the elephants pull up the enormous big-top tent. I suppose it was the biggest structure I had ever seen. There were wagons with iron-barred sides that held lions and tigers. When the big show began, the elephants paraded into the tent holding each other’s tails. We had a marvelous time at the circus.\n\nWhen I began school, the early grades would meet two to a class — first and second grade together, third and fourth grade together. The grammar school and high school were in one wooden building: grammar school on one side, high school on the other, connected by a big, long hall. Between them was an auditorium where we would assemble to watch plays or participate in other programs. There was a school band — not very big and not very good, I guess.\n\nSchool was not far from our house — maybe three-quarters of a mile — so we walked there. When Sister was school-aged, we’d walk together every day. We carried our books in a canvas bag that would sling over the shoulder. We’d run home to eat lunch. The children who lived out from town would bring their lunches — biscuits, sausage, sweet potatoes, things like that. There was no cafeteria. No snacks.\n\nIf there was a discipline problem, the teacher would use a paddle to straighten it out. Paddling for unruly behavior was a common practice in those days. I never got into any trouble at school, though. As the old saying goes, “If you got into trouble at school, you’d have more trouble at home.” Daddy would not tolerate disruptive behavior. Neither would Mama.\n\nThe only teacher I remember from grammar school was my fifth-grade schoolteacher, Mrs. Rutherford. She was a strict disciplinarian and a very good teacher. I liked being in her class. She was a direct descendant of the Indian Rutherfords. There was a famous chief in their family who jumped off the cliff into the Alabama River down at Perdue Hill in Claiborne.\n\nI liked to read, although I wasn’t an A student. I guess I made more C’s than anything else. But I liked to read. Some afternoons I’d come home and read rather than go out to play. I liked histories and novels. I liked Western stories, Zane Grey’s books. Mama and Daddy bought a lot of books for the house. I remember Daddy buying the Encyclopaedia Britannica to help us with our studies. It was a beautiful, extensive set of books. Quite expensive too, as I recall.\n\nI had a dog named Bozo who met me everyday when I’d come home from school. He’d greet me and jump all over me. He was brown and white, a beautiful dog. I’d had him from as early as I could remember. One afternoon, as I was about to walk across the road into our yard, Bozo ran right in front of Mr. Galloway’s truck. Mr. Galloway owned the Nehi bottling company in town. He was coming back from Monroeville and he ran over Bozo and killed him. It happened right in front of me. I remember crying, picking Bozo up out of the road, carrying him into the yard and calling for Mama. She came out, tried to comfort me. I guess Mamie took Bozo away from me, took him off to be buried. I was maybe ten years old. I was just devastated. I was real upset and real sad for a long number of days.\n\nThe worst part about it, the thing I will never forget, is that Mr. Galloway never stopped. He never stopped. Until this day I will never forgive him. He had a son named George Galloway. And just because he was Mr. Galloway’s son, I didn’t like him. I didn’t like anything to do with the Galloways from then on.\n\nI never had another dog.\n\nI got sick that summer. When I was little, sick with a cold or a bad congestion, Daddy used to fix me a hot toddy. He made it with hot water, sugar, and whiskey — just a little bit of whiskey, maybe a third or fourth cup. He didn’t buy “shinny” — boot-leg, white-lightning type stuff. He kept bottled bourbon for medicinal purposes. He kept it up over the top of the door in the closet. But my problem that summer wasn’t something a hot toddy would fix.\n\nMama and Daddy noticed that my jaws and neck and face had become persistently swollen, so they took me to Mobile to find out what was wrong. After the second trip, the doctors diagnosed my illness as Bright’s disease, a degenerative condition of the kidney. They told my mother and father that they had no cure for it. They said that I might as well go home to die.\n\nThrough some friends of his, Daddy called the two leading hospitals of the time — Johns Hopkins and the Mayo Clinic. They confirmed the diagnosis made in Mobile. They also confirmed that there was no known cure for this disease. It was always fatal. The prognosis was that my kidneys would deteriorate to the point that they would cause me to go into convulsions, then into a coma from which I would never wake up.\n\nNow during the time that I was sick, everyone in Frisco City knew. When I became bedridden, they closed the highway in front of the house. They diverted traffic around the house, through some fields around some section lines, to keep the cars and trucks from making any noise going past. Once I was bedridden and it became clear how sick I was, the little town of Frisco City would close up, every day at 11:00 a.m. Every day. The whole town. The towns- people would go to the First Baptist Church and hold a prayer service for me. I think that’s probably the reason I’m still here. Later in the afternoon, they’d open businesses back up.\n\nI don’t recall any pain. I remember being puffed up, swollen. When I did go into convulsions, Daddy didn’t know what else to do but let Doctor McMillan give me a mustard plaster. McMillanwas an old doctor in Frisco City whose medical training dated from the reading he did during the Civil War. I don’t know that he had a medical degree, but people called him doctor. He told Daddy that he didn’t know anything else to do. Modern medicine had no cure. Doctor Stallworth, the main doctor in Frisco City, didn’t know what to do. Doctor Segrist, one of the first urologists in Mobile, didn’t know what to do. Perhaps a mustard plaster would help. So they took a big ol’ wool blanket — an army blanket, World War I issue — and they put it in a washpot out back of the house. When it got real hot and steamy, they put dry mustard on it, then rolled me in it and put me in the bed.\n\nI remember being on Mama’s and Daddy’s sleeping porch, trying to look out the window, and asking Mama, “You see that bird going up on the curtain? There it goes, up the curtain. See it going up the curtain and down?” She knew what was happening. It was my sight going. I went blind.\n\nI don’t remember being afraid. I had no knowledge of death. Mama and Daddy were always there. I don’t remember falling into a coma, but they said I was in a coma for three days. Mama said I just woke up one morning and told her I was hungry. She knew then I was going to come through. And I did. I started coming back. From then on, Dr. Segrist drove up from Mobile to see me. He couldn’t explain it, but he did everything he could to help me recover. He knew what he had diagnosed was right because the other medical institutions had the same information and they all diagnosed my illness as Bright’s disease. Nobody had ever heard of a case ending as mine did. The doctors had told my family exactly how the disease would progress. Everything had happened as they said. Exactly as they expected. Only I wasn’t supposed to wake up and say, “I’m hungry.”\n\nThis was a miracle. I’ve known several of them in my lifetime.\n\nChapter Three\n\nAs I’ve said, Daddy worked all the time. But he would take off occasionally to take us to the beach, or sometimes to go fishing. I recall our family taking a trip to Pensacola Beach when I was about five. We stopped at a filling station to get gas and soft drinks and the family — six of the family, anyway — got back in the car and left. I don’t know if I was wandering around the store or what. Why Mama and Daddy didn’t count heads, I don’t know. But they pulled off and drove out of sight. They left me. Well, when I realized what had happened, I started hollering and screaming and trying to run after them. One of the young men at the filling station grabbed a bicycle, put me on with him, and started pedaling as fast as he could, trying to catch up with the car. My family met us coming on the bicycle. They hadn’t gone far before they missed me and turned around. But they’d driven out of sight. That scared me.\n\nWhen I was older, Daddy would take us deep sea fishing down at Gulf Shores. In those days, the blacktop ended at Foley and a dirt road ran the rest of the way to the Gulf. You crossed a floating bridge at the intracoastal canal. We’d leave very early in the morning, drive down, and charter a boat. I recall one trip when we caught just an awful lot of Spanish mackerel — lots and lots and lots of Spanish. We caught so much that I remember Daddy taking the back seat out of the car and strapping it to the top. He put canvas down on the floorboard, covered that with pine straw, and laid the catch out on the pine straw and covered it with croaker sacks. On the way home, we stopped in Foley and bought cracked ice to pour over the fish for the long drive back to Frisco City. When we arrived, I remember Daddy parking the car in front of the store and walking up and down the street, telling people to come get them a mess of fish. There was no way to keep all of it. We had to give it away.\n\nWhen I was twelve years old, I made my first trip out of the South. I went up to Detroit, Michigan, with my father and Mr. Shivers. Mr. Shivers owned the Plymouth-Chrysler-DeSoto dealership in Frisco City, right next to my father’s store. He didn’t sell many Chryslers. He sold some DeSotos. Mostly he sold Plymouths. This was during Depression when cars cost hundreds of dollars and came in one color — black.\n\nWe drove up there to buy cars with two other men. In those days they didn’t have trucks that hauled cars to auto dealers. So Mr. Shivers put us all in his car to drive straight through to Detroit, to buy the new cars at the factory. We drove five cars back, convoy-fashion. I drove right behind Daddy.\n\nThe roads were two-lane all the way north. There was not much traffic. We drove practically all day and most of the night. I think we stopped one time to rest. We did the same thing coming back. I don’t remember much of Detroit. Just that it was large and busy. I don’t think I saw much of the city driving out because I was concentrating on staying behind my father.\n\nYou might be surprised — a twelve-year-old boy driving from Detroit to Frisco City. But there were no driver’s licenses in those days. And I had been driving since I was eight or nine. My job was to wash the car and change the oil in it when Daddy told me to. That’s when I would get in the car to drive it. I would start it, put it in gear, and let the clutch out — we didn’t have automatic transmissions back then. I’d let the clutch out real easy, then just let the car go on its own momentum. I’d back the car out of the car house, wash or service it, then drive it back in. That’s how I learned to drive.\n\nNow I don’t remember if we took that trip to Detroit because of a cigarette, but we might have, because the story I’m about to relate happened around the same time as that trip with Mr. Shivers — 1932 or 1933.\n\nDaddy had promised me one evening in the early summer that he would take me fishing the next day. I was really excited about that. I believe we were going to drive down to the Alabama River. Well, we’d gotten all our gear ready to go the night before. The big morning came, and somebody started knocking on the sleeping porch door, calling for Daddy to wake up quick. This woke me up too. Excited voices outside. I looked out to see smoke streaming from the car house — that’s what we called our garage. Daddy went running out there and when he opened the door to the car house, that let in enough fresh air to cause the smoldering car to burst into flames. My fishing trip went up in smoke right then.\n\nLeighton had been out driving on a date the previous evening. Someone had been smoking in the car, apparently, and had left a cigarette burning on the wool seat. Leighton hadn’t noticed when he got home. He put the car up in the car house and closed the door.\n\nThe car was a total loss, of course. So was my fishing trip.\n\nLater on in the thirties, Daddy would take us to vacation at Hot Springs, Arkansas. We would go up for three weeks in June or July. The trip would take us two days, going and coming. We’d stay overnight at what was called a tourist court somewhere up in Mississippi or Louisiana. Tourist courts were the motels of the time — a group of little cabins beside the highway. The cabins were very sparsely furnished, two beds and a bathroom, no amenities.\n\nIn Hot Springs we would rent a house on the side of one of the mountains. There was normally a twenty-one day series of baths at one of the big bathhouses, what we’d call “spas” today. Mama suffered from arthritis. Daddy thought the steam and the hot baths would do them both good. On several occasions I took the baths with Daddy. They put me in a big tub. The water would come in real hot.\n\nUsually though, when my mother and father were taking the baths, my brothers and sister and I would go to movies, or sit in on auctions at one of the many auction houses that lined the main street. It was fun to watch people bidding on antique furniture, porcelain, silver, or jewelry. Sometimes my mother and father would take us out to Lake Hamilton to go swimming with the other kids.\n\nWe’d return to Frisco City by August when the cotton was starting to get high. In late August, early September, my brothers and I would head out to the fields to help pick it. We didn’t have tractors or mechanical pickers in those days. The adults did what they called “carry two rows at a time” — picking rows on either side as they walked, cotton bag over the shoulder. I’d carry one row when I was a boy. I got paid fifty cents a hundred pounds. When you filled your sack, you carried it over to weigh it at the cotton house at the side of the field. The cotton house was a shed with a tin roof, sided by rough-hewn lumber. There were scales out front. You’d weigh your cotton and somebody would note the weight on a tablet, then you dumped your cotton inside to keep it out of the weather. From the cotton house they would load it on a mule-drawn wagon for transfer to the gin.\n\nIn those days Daddy kept mules for farming. They were very docile animals. Some of them were very well trained. When you’d plow with them, you’d throw the reins over your shoulder while you were guiding the plow, and call “gee” to get the mule to move to the right, or “haw” to get him to go left. If you were putting in crop, you had to keep the rows straight. The trick to that was to lay down your first row just right, then plow the rest of them parallel. Corn rows would be a little closer together than cotton rows.\n\nAs I got older, I worked every Saturday in the warehouse of my father’s store, where I’d help unload wagons of inventory for the store, or supplies that farmers had purchased.\n\nMy older brothers worked in the store until they went off to Marion Military Institute, then the University of Alabama. Marion Institute — MI — was a very strict private military school, where Daddy sent Leighton and Felix and John Albert and me for our first two years of college. Daddy was concerned that a high school education alone would not be enough to let you make it later on. Felix could have gone on to college, but he wanted to stay and work in the store with Daddy. And he wanted to hunt and fish when he wasn’t working.\n\nMy older brothers played football in high school. I did, too. I played guard on offense, and tackle on defense, but I was not first-string by any means. I weighed only a hundred twenty-six pounds. But our team was excellent. They were called the Frisco City Whippets and still are, to this day. The coach at that time was Coach Fisher. A number of his varsity players received football scholarships. I don’t recall cheerleaders. We didn’t have stands at the field for games. Fans and parents lined up on opposite sides of the field with their teams and followed the play up and down the sidelines. We’d take school buses to out-of-town games. We played Jackson, Alabama, which was a long trip. And Excel. We played Uriah. Once in awhile we played Atmore, which was also a long way — it was twenty-five miles. I suppose Monroeville was our main rival. They were the big town compared to ours. I think the record between our teams was pretty even.\n\nI wasn’t much for baseball because I wasn’t that good at catching. I went out for baseball on the school team one time. We were at practice, and this fellow was swinging a bat, walking along, swinging, and he hit me in the back of the head. I thought, “That’s enough of that.” There went my baseball career.\n\nI didn’t do any serious dating in high school. I recall dating a girl from Atmore and a girl from Monroeville. When Sister and I would go out socializing on Sunday evening, we’d usually drive over to Monroeville, about five miles away, because that’s where the movie house was. We’d go to a drugstore that had a soda fountain. I don’t recall any jukebox. Later on, we’d go down below Uriah to the state park and go swimming there in the lake.\n\nNow Sister met the man she would marry on one of our summer trips to Hot Springs, Arkansas. This was before I went to MI. In the summer of ’35 or ’36 our family became friends with the McLemore family. They were from Louisiana. They had two sons. Both of them fell in love with my sister when they met her. We had a home up on the side of the mountain and they had a home just below us and we could hear the boys arguing over who was going to have a date with my sister. I suppose they must have taken turns dating her while we were on vacation. When it came time to leave Hot Springs, the McLemores invited my family to come through Louisiana on our way home, to a little town called Winnsboro where they lived. So we did. We went through there and stayed with them. The McLemores owned a hotel and quite a bit of land, about three thousand acres, including a hunting preserve. They also owned the Piggly-Wiggly chain of stores in Louisiana, up in Winnsboro and Monroe. They owned a wholesale grocery company also. After that visit, the brother named Quentin was the one who proved he was really in love with my sister. He would drive from Louisiana to Alabama to court her on a regular basis. He was determined he was going to marry my sister just as soon as she got out of high school. And he did.\n\nTheir wedding was in June of 1942 at the First Baptist Church in Frisco City. I was home from the University of Alabama. We all doted on Sister and though we were very happy for her, we were a little sad that she was going to move all the way to Louisiana to live on the McLemore farm.\n\nShe and Quentin raised six children in their beautiful lakeside home. Margaret looked after her family just as she had looked after all of us. She waited on them as she had waited on us. She was very religious. She took an active part in church work. She was a very precious, saintly woman. She was so well loved and doing so much good. Why did she have to die so young? She was in her mid-forties when she passed away. The cause was some kind of complication associated with a surgical procedure. You don’t ever question God, but I don’t know why she had to die so young.\n\nChapter Four\n\nIn the late summer of 1939 Mama and Daddy drove me and a big trunk to Marion Military Institute. Packed in that trunk were the uniforms that were going to be my daily dress from then on. I was going to begin my freshman year of college as a cadet a hundred and twelve miles from home.\n\nMI was highly regarded as a junior college. Since its founding in 1887, several generations of young men had been educated there before winning appointments to West Point or Annapolis, or going on to university elsewhere. As I mentioned, my brothers had gone to school there before me. Now it was my turn.\n\nI was excited because my world was about to get bigger. My graduating class at Frisco City High was twenty-six people. Now I was going to join several hundred young men in the corps of cadets. I was excited, but I was also a little anxious because I had never been apart from my family before.\n\nI remember checking in at the administration office where I got my room assignment in South Barracks. I remember Daddy helping me carry my trunk upstairs to put it at the foot of my bunk. I remember going back downstairs and Mama and Daddy telling me goodbye. And the whole time this awareness was coming over me that they were really going to get in the car and drive away. I wouldn’t see them for a long time.\n\nSuddenly my parents were driving off and I was standing there alone. I watched them drive past the chapel and the administrative building. I watched them head out the long drive past the drill field at the front of the campus. I watched them turn and drive slowly along the main street. I watched them through tears that just wouldn’t stop.\n\nI knew they were going to have to make one more turn and pass back by South Barracks before they took the highway to Frisco City. So I ran. Crying the whole time, I ran around the barracks to wave to them as they drove out of sight. Mama waved, but Daddy didn’t. He didn’t look right or left. I suppose it was as hard on him as it was on me.\n\nIn a little while I collected myself and went up to my room. Most rooms accommodated only two cadets, but the rooms at either end of the barracks were big enough for three cadets. I was lucky enough to have one of these. I believe it was the same room my older brothers had been assigned. I put on my uniform and waited for my roommates to arrive. They were Jack Robertson from Bay Minette and Ugi Jernigan from Brewton. Ugi’s real name was John. He would become our company commander. They had older brothers who had attended MI before them, too.\n\nIn a little while a bugle sounded from the quadrangle between the North and South Barracks. We formed into companies and were given instructions to live by: what time reveille was in the morning, taps in the evening; how many minutes you’d have to get up, dress-out for exercise; how long you’d exercise; how much time you’d have to get back to barracks for a shower, get dressed, fall out for breakfast. You marched to meals, you marched to classes, you marched everywhere you went. Everything was scheduled. Classes began at eight and ran till three. In the afternoons you had athletics or drill. In the evenings there were study hours, patrolled by upper classmen. Before taps was blown in the evening for lights out, there was a bugle blown for “pee call” that let you take a study break to go to the latrine. I didn’t mind the regimentation. In fact, I enjoyed it. The training proved valuable to me later on.\n\nI went out for football during my first semester. My mother and father came up for the Homecoming festivities, which included a big game, I think with Livingston State. Now I hadn’t told them that I was playing football. I don’t remember how I’d got around telling them. Earlier in the day, they’d seen me pass in review with the corps of cadets in a big ceremony on the drill field. There were other Homecoming-related events besides the football game. I forget why it was they attended the game without expecting me to sit with them. Maybe it was because all of the cadets were supposed to be sitting together in separate stands.\n\nAnyway, I got knocked out in the first quarter of the football game. I tried to tackle this big old boy who put a knee into my head. In those days we wore leather helmets that weren’t really much protection. This boy stunned me on the tackle. I had to be carted off the field. Well, Mama and Daddy were studying the situation, and Mama kept looking, and said, “ I believe that’s Charlie they just carried off.” That’s how they learned I was playing football. We had a little conversation after the game. I was told that I was at MI to study, not to play football. And that was the end of my football career.\n\nI majored in biology. I got a tuition stipend for working in the lab, keeping it cleaned up. I think I got thirty dollars a month for helping out. I enjoyed the lab work — preparing slides, using the microscope, doing dissections. I remember dissecting a frog. I think we put him to sleep with ether, then we took a scalpel and opened the abdomen very carefully. The teacher inserted a small glass slide into the cavity to hold the tissue apart and it was like a little window that looked into where the heart was beating.\n\nWhen the Thanksgiving holiday came, I got a ride south as far as Grove Hill with a classmate, Joe McCorquodale. My mother drove up there to meet me. Other times when I went home for holidays, I think I hitchhiked. In those days you could get out on the highway and catch a ride real easy. It was safe. Many people did it. Somebody would come along, stop, pick you up, and say, “Where do you want to get off?” and they would take you.\n\nYes, I missed my family that first year at MI. We stayed in touch by mail. Telephones were just beginning to come into our part of the country, but there weren’t any lines running between my barracks up in Marion and my home in Frisco City. Despite homesickness, I made friends and adapted to life as a cadet. I’d had a taste of a bigger world, and I was thinking I’d like to move on directly to the University of Alabama for my sophomore year.\n\nLate in the summer of 1940, my roommate, Jack Robertson, borrowed his family’s car and drove over from Bay Minette to pick me up in Frisco City. Then we went on to Brewton to pick up Ugi. We were going down to Fort Walton for a little weekend holiday before going back to school. I told them, “I’m thinking about going to the University of Alabama.” They said, “No, no, you don’t want to do that.” I remember arguing about that on the drive down to Fort Walton.\n\nIt was August. Man, it was hot. We crossed over the bridge from Pensacola to Santa Rosa Island and it looked like the road would melt. There was nothing on Santa Rosa Island back then — only a two lane road, so thin and bumpy it seemed like the asphalt was poured on sand. The car jumped around, going down the highway. When we got to Fort Walton, the road just stopped. They hadn’t built the bridge over to Destin back then. We stayed at a little tourist court beside the pass — $2.50 a night for a cabin without screens in the windows. When we got there, we put on our swimming shorts immediately, it was so hot. I think we spent most of the time swimming that weekend.\n\n“I’m going to go to the University,” I said.\n\n“Oh no,” they said. Back and forth like that, all weekend.\n\nWe had a good time. Robertson liked beer and he bought some. I don’t remember what brand. I didn’t care for it. Didn’t like the taste. Still don’t. Made me all woozy and uncomfortable.\n\n“I’m still going to the University,” I said.\n\n“Hell no!” said Robertson.\n\nWell, we came back and I discussed my plans with Daddy and he told me, “Son, I think it would be best for you to return to MI.” Actually, I think what he said was, “Son, you will return to MI.” So you know what: I was on campus and back in the room before Robertson and Ugi returned to Marion. I beat them back.\n\nThe thing is, Daddy wanted me to be a doctor. That was why I was majoring in biology at MI. My oldest brother, Leighton, had returned to Frisco City to work in the store. John Albert and Felix had taken jobs with the Armour Packing Company, hauling beef and pork in Louisiana — Albert in New Orleans, Felix in Baton Rouge, both making thirty dollars a month. Daddy had helped them get jobs with that company through contacts he had buying Armour products for the store. He wanted something better for me, I guess, and he thought I could do it, and he didn’t want me to quit. He knew I was the last boy in the family to have the opportunity to study medicine, and he wanted me well prepared before I went to the university. He wanted me to be a doctor. So that’s what I planned to do.\n\nBut I also liked military science, a course where we studied tactics and strategy. My senior year at MI, I joined the precision drill team they would later call the White Knights. There were about sixteen boys in our squad. We did precision marching and rifle handling, twirling and flipping these heavy World War I–issue rifles. It was tricky business handling those weapons, wearing white gloves. We did it for show. I liked it. I did well in military studies, too. I was hoping to win an appointment to West Point. I’ll come to “why” in a moment, but Daddy supported my desire to go to West Point when he saw how much it meant to me. During my senior year, he contacted Frank Boykin, our congressman, to see if he could help me win an appointment, but Mr. Boykin gave the first appointment to a boy from Atmore. I got an alternate appointment, with my chance dependent on the Atmore boy’s decision to go. It turned out that he did go to West Point. It also turned out that he flunked out of West Point. But that happened after I had made my peace with this disappointment and had gone on to the University of Alabama.\n\nI went up to Tuscaloosa in the summer of 1941. I went to summer school and roomed in a boardinghouse. But I didn’t take a course in biology or chemistry, even though I knew Daddy wanted me to be a doctor. And even though Daddy knew the pre-med curriculum would come in the fall, he let me take two summer school courses unrelated to a medical major: one course in aeronautical engineering and one in mechanical drawing. The mechanical drawing course was required for the engineering school.\n\nYou see, I had wanted to go to West Point to be an airman, not a soldier. The Air Force was still part of the Army in those days. It was called the Army Air Corps. If you wanted to fly, West Point was where you went to get in line for training. And I knew, I knew, I wanted to fly.\n\nWhen I was a little boy, barnstormers would come into Frisco City in the late summer or late winter, when the fields were fallow. It was not unusual. You’d hear a noise in the sky. You’d look up and see a biplane circling. The pilot would pick out a little town, locate a field, and land. He’d come down, his wheels bumping the dirt, running along the rows, raising all kinds of dust and noise. And it was magical. Of course, a crowd would gather around the plane as soon as it was on the ground. Remember, we’re talking about a world where there were not that many cars — this was the late twenties, the early thirties. So an airplane was about like a rocket ship. If it was late in the day, the pilot would sleep out in the field, under the plane, and all of the children would be right back there the next morning. Because, of course, he had come to take people riding. He’d contact the owner of the field, offering to take him or his family up for free, or offering some of the proceeds from the rides in exchange for using the field. Maybe he only wanted money for fuel, just enough to take his plane to the next town. That’s what barnstormers did in those days. But the thing was, you could go up in that plane.\n\nWell, one of those barnstormers landed in one of Daddy’s cotton fields when I was a little boy. You could see that field from the house. We still have that field. I can still see that plane. And that pilot came to talk to my father.\n\nSure, I went up. The plane had an open cockpit big enough for two people. You just got in, got down behind a little windshield, and took off. The plane bounced along, shedding the rows — seemed like it would hook the trees at the edge of the field before it caught up and lifted — but it caught up and went. I imagine top speed on those old planes was about seventy-five miles an hour, if that much, but it was as fast as I had ever been, and it shook off the earth. It took off and soared. You’d look down from six hundred feet and see everything — fields in checkerboard patches, trees like little shrubs, houses like little toys, and you were making way, making time. It was great. It was powerful. And I thought, man, this is good, I like this. And I always wanted to fly after that. I never, never forgot it.\n\nSo that was in the back of my mind when I wanted to go to West Point. That was in the back of my mind when I went up to summer school in 1941 at the university. That was why I was thinking about the army and engineering: flying.\n\nWhen the fall of 1941 came around, however, it was time to think about the pre-med curriculum again. Daddy had let me take my engineering courses, but he still wanted me to be a doctor. He was pushing me to do that. I was also talking with my next-oldest brother, John Albert, about what fraternity to join. Membership in a fraternity was an important part of the campus community in Tuscaloosa, to making your way up there.\n\nJohn Albert had been a member of Pi Delta Theta. My oldest brother, Leighton, had been Sigma Alpha Epsilon, years before him. I remember looking around the big SAE fraternity house at the university. It was distinguished by its parking lot — more cars, I guess, than anywhere else on Greek Row. Remember, we’re talking about a time when the country was pulling out of the Depression. College boys with their own cars were not that common. So here was the SAE house with this huge parking lot that looked like an auto dealership. These boys were obviously well off. But were they going to have to focus on their studies? I needed to be with boys who wanted to get into medical school, who had “brothers” admitted to medical school, “brothers” who’d gone on to be doctors. These questions were in my mind when I thought about what fraternity I wanted to join that fall.\n\nI went through rush. I narrowed my choices down to two fraternities: Pi Kappa Alpha (“Pikes” as they were called) and Pi Delta Theta, where John Albert had been a member. The boys at Pi Delta remembered John Albert. Everybody had liked him. Because I was his brother, they were very interested in me. They gave me a pin and told me that when I got ready to join the best fraternity up there, just put the pin on and call them. During one rush party, they even called John Albert to get him to convince me to pledge. They put me on the phone with him. In the course of the conversation, he said, “Let me tell you something. When I was there, I enjoyed the members of that fraternity. They were good men. I enjoyed their company. But I don’t know who’s there now, or who’s running it. You make the decision where you want to be. You decide where you want to associate — not because I was a member there.”\n\nWell, the boys at Pi Delta were not real interested in pre-med, whereas the boys at the Pike house impressed me as being very interested in it. Some of them were already in med school. I decided if I was going to be a success in medicine, I better get with the ones who were going to med school. So I chose the “Pikes.” Of course I wound up having good friends throughout the Greek system.\n\nOne of the things that the fraternity did was arrange dates for new members. There were always social events surrounding the football games. Often you’d have two dates arranged back-to-back, one for the game and one after the game. It was on one of those football weekend dates, the first week of my first semester, that I met Evelyn Bell from Mobile. She was a “KD,” a member of the Kappa Delta sorority. Evelyn was a sophomore. She’d spent her freshman year at Randolph Macon in Virginia. I don’t remember much about that football game — who was playing, what the score was — but I remember enjoying Evelyn’s company. I also remember being a little disappointed when we had to leave the game early because she had another date and I did, too.\n\nNot much time passed before we went out again. I called her. We were soon going to dances whenever they’d have big bands at the auditorium. Or we’d get together to dance to the radio at the Pike house. We danced all the popular dances: the jitterbug, the fox trot, even the conga line, which was a new dance at the time. We’d meet at the soup store at the student union. We’d study together at night at the library. On Sundays we’d go to church together. I liked her very much. We were very comfortable together. In fact, when I was trying to decide which fraternity to pledge, I asked her whether she’d prefer a Pi Delt pin or a Pike pin. She said it didn’t matter as long as it came from me.\n\nOne weekend in December we went to the picture show. It was a Sunday matinee, Sergeant York, starring Gary Cooper — about this country boy sharpshooter in World War I, how he won the Medal of Honor by single-handedly wiping out a German machine gun nest and capturing a bunch of German soldiers. Suddenly they stopped the movie. They drew the curtain across the screen. The lights came up. A man walked out on stage. He announced that Pearl Harbor had been bombed that morning. America had declared war on Japan.\n\nIt was unthinkable. We’d been aware of the war in Europe, of course, but that had seemed like Europe’s problem, not ours. We weren’t aware of the atrocities Hitler was committing against the Jews. Nobody had any earthly idea. And now Japan had tried to destroy our Navy in Hawaii? We were at war? It was just unthinkable. It was like what happened on September 11, 2001, in New York, only more traumatic. The world changed just like that for all of us.\n\nWe left the theatre and walked back to the Pike House. Everybody was talking about what had happened. But the more pressing questions were about what was going to happen next. All the young men knew that their lives were going to change. It wasn’t going to be just classes and graduation. We left school for the Christmas holidays with a lot on our minds.\n\nThe holidays were pleasant, though of course my parents were worried about what the war would mean for my brothers and me. John Albert was leaving his job with Armour to join the Air Corps. Felix was going to enlist in the infantry. Leighton was going to sign up, too. I learned later that he had failed the physical exam, whether because of his eyesight or what, I don’t know. He was in his thirties and married, so that may have had something to do with it. He would get a job on the railroad, running ammunition from Mobile over to New Orleans.\n\nWhat was I going to do? I knew that Daddy wanted me to continue my pre-med classes, graduate and go on to medical school. But the war was going to change that. I wanted to be a pilot. I intended to enlist in the Army Air Corps when I returned to the university. I never figured that the road back to Tuscaloosa would have a nasty swerve in it.\n\nWhen the Christmas holidays were over, I got a call from one of my roommates who lived in Brewton. The fall of my first semester, before I joined the fraternity, I had been sharing an apartment in Tuscaloosa with two other boys from south Alabama whom I’d known at MI, Bob Johnston and Nick Stallworth. It was a garage apartment. We called this place “the Purity Palace,” for reasons that might be best left to the imagination. We had a good time there. Anyway, when Bob called after New Year’s, he told me that Nick would be coming over to pick him up, then they’d come on over to Frisco City to get me for the drive back to Tuscaloosa.\n\nNick had a four-door Chevy, a 1940 model, I believe. His family was in the timber business and in the summers he drove a logging truck. He had taken a big horn off that logging truck and hooked it up to the manifold of this four-door Chevy his family had given him. The horn was hidden under the hood. He liked to pull up to crosswalks on streets around campus and wait till students were passing right in front of him, then blow that horn. It was the loudest damn thing you ever heard. People would jump and their books would go flying all over the place. So this was Nick.\n\nWhen he picked me up, it was a cold, rainy, misty day in January. We drove as far as Greensboro, where we stopped at the Green Roof Lounge for a hamburger. Bob loved to have a beer. So he had one. Then he ran into one of our instructors from Marion Institute, who was also having a beer. Well, Bob went over and sat down with him and that turned into more beers. Nick didn’t drink and I didn’t like beer. So we finished our meal and waited. After a while, I said to Nick, “I think we need to get on out of here, because this rain is turning colder, and we might get into trouble if we stay too long.” The road from there to Tuscaloosa was hilly and curvy around all these gullies. Bob said he wasn’t ready to go. He wanted another beer. So I said, “Well, if you don’t want to go, then you’re going to stay.” So Nick and I went out and got in the car and left.\n\nWe hadn’t got many miles down the road when Nick reached down and blew that horn for no reason. He said, “McNeil, I’m going to be a race car driver one day!” And he started speeding. This worried me. I said, “Not tonight, Nick.” We were going down a hill with a sharp left turn at the bottom. He was going too fast. I said, “Nick, slow down now. We don’t have to be in a hurry.”\n\nAt the bottom of the hill the car went into a skid off a wet streak in the road. Suddenly my side of the car was the front of the car — we were sliding sideways out of the turn, my right shoulder in the line of motion. We skidded right out of the road, across a dirt yard, past somebody’s front porch, missing it by about three feet, headed toward a small embankment that marked the top of a gully at the edge of the yard. You could see trees peaking over the embankment. When the car skipped over this ridge, it rolled us just enough so that my side of the roof hit the trees first.\n\nThe car hit those trees, I hit the door, it popped open. The last thing I remember was Nick’s side of the car raised up on my left as we went into those trees — about midway up the side of them because the gully was about twelve feet deep. When I came to, I heard Nick scrambling around, saying “Mack, are you hurt?” I said, “I don’t know, come pull me up out of this mud over here.”\n\nIn a minute we heard somebody climbing down into the gully to help us. He was the man who lived in the house whose porch we’d missed. He got us out of there, and took us into his house, where his wife gave us a pan of water to wash ourselves off. My face was bruised, my back was hurting, and I had a hematoma on my right leg, where I had been thrown into the car door. I remember it was cold in their house because they had no doors, just blankets hung against the outside. They were poor, obviously, but they were wonderfully kind. They stoked the fire back up, and offered me their bed for the night. Not only that, but they put bricks in the fireplace, and when they were hot, they wrapped those bricks in towels, then put them in their bed to keep me warm and to ease the soreness in my body. The next day they fed us breakfast and helped us get a ride into town. They were wonderful to us.\n\nWe called somebody in Tuscaloosa who came to pick us up. When I got to the university, I called my father to tell him what had happened. Nick called Evelyn. They were both upset, but I was all right, just sore. Daddy drove up to see how I was doing. On the way, he stopped outside of Greensboro to look at Nick’s car. It was totaled: the roof smashed down where it went against the trees, the chassis and body bent from the drop down the gully. How Nick and I survived this wreck I don’t know. It was a close call. I’d face a few more of them in the next couple of years.\n\nThat winter I moved into the Pike House. As soon as I was a Pike, I pinned Evelyn. We were going steady.\n\nAlong Fraternity Row, the boys built mock ant-aircraft gun emplacements in the yards in front of the houses. They’d use plywood and cardboard. The gun barrels would be mop handles or broom handles. Sometimes they’d surround them with real sandbags. The war was on everybody’s mind. It was daily news.\n\nI continued with my pre-med coursework. I remember taking a course in advanced biology that was taught by Dr. Smith, an older teacher, who sat me in front of a hundred and fifty other students, right in front of her lectern. She chewed on me all the time, but I guess I was kind of a pet. She’d say, “Mr. McNeil, you’ll never be a doctor if you don’t learn how to spell. Now just listen to the pronunciation and write the words exactly like they sound.”\n\nBesides going to class, I was in advanced ROTC — Reserve Officers’ Training Corps. I had been in ROTC since my graduation from MI. As the war intensified, I knew that it was only a matter of time before I would be called for duty. My ROTC affiliation meant that I could expect a commission in the infantry. I didn’t want to fight the war on the ground. It was time to make my own plans before the Army made them for me. So in February I caught a ride to the airfield in Tuscaloosa and enlisted in the Air Corps. I was going to be a pilot.\n\nDuring the spring of that semester I got a call from John Albert, who was in Officer Candidate School with the Army Air Corps over in Meridian, Mississippi. I went over to spend the weekend with him. He was going up in an airplane, testing parachutes. He said, “Put on this jumpsuit and come on, go with me,” so I put on a jumpsuit and got on the plane with him. The pilot took us up. In the back of the plane were twelve to fifteen dummies, each with a parachute buckled on, their ripcords attached to a track that ran up to a release beside the cabin door. Once we reached fifteen hundred feet, John Albert slid open the door and started kicking these dummies out. I helped him. The dummies weighed maybe a hundred and fifty pounds. The wind snatched them out and their parachutes began to unfurl over the green land below. The plane we were flying in was a C47. I couldn’t know it, but this was the plane I’d be piloting over England and France a year later.\n\nShortly before the end of the semester, I received instructions to go to Montgomery to swear the oath to defend my country. The office was in the basement of a federal building. There were six or eight other boys ready to swear in. I’m sure there was some additional paperwork we signed, but what I remember was this: standing before an army officer and an American flag, raising my right hand, and pledging to faithfully serve my country. I swore that oath on May 20, 1942.\n\nChapter Five\n\nThe summer of 1942 passed quickly. I visited my family in Frisco City. I visited Evelyn and her family at their vacation place at Gulf Shores, then returned to Tuscaloosa for summer school. Summer school turned into fall semester, fall into winter. I hoped I might graduate.\n\nThree months before commencement, I was ordered to report. The army sent a letter in early February. Marked “RESTRICTED” and bearing the seal of Headquarters Fourth Service Command, it read:\n\nPursuant to telephonic instructions February 4, 1943, from The Adjutant General,\n\neach of the following named Air Corps Enlisted Reservists having been found qualified for Aviation Cadet appointment is ordered to active duty in grade of private, effective February 21, 1943, and will proceed from the address shown after his name to Army Air Forces Basic Training Center No. 4, Miami Beach, Florida, reporting on February 22,1943, for Pre-Aviation Cadet Basic Training.…\n\nAnd there, down the list, among boys mostly from North Carolina, was my name and my home: Charles E. McNeil, Frisco City, Alabama. The letter assigned an item to each of us: the serial number that would be hammered into our dog tags.\n\nWe had a going-away party at the Pike House. The sense of adventure made it a happy time. Evelyn came over that evening and we had supper together. We didn’t get teary-eyed because we expected everything would work out for the best.\n\nI remember giving my friend, Tom Rast, a tweed suit that my father had given me my first fall semester at the university. We wore the same size clothes. I gave him some dress shirts and khakis too. I wouldn’t be wearing civilian clothes for a few years. I packed what I had left and moved home.\n\nSince the train from Frisco City didn’t run to Miami Beach, my parents drove me over to the station at Atmore, about forty miles away. The army had my ticket waiting. I was instructed not to pack much, so I didn’t. I do remember taking with me a new pair of shoes from the store. They were good-looking tan dress shoes that retailed for $5.50. I remember this because, when I arrived in Miami Beach, there was a big barrel outside the place where we were given our uniforms, and over that barrel was a sign: “Donate Your Shoes!” What was I going to do, take those dress shoes to Europe? Wear them when? With what? I tied that pretty pair of shoes together with their strings and put them in the barrel.\n\nThe army had taken over Miami Beach. Every hotel was requisitioned to house new recruits. During the next two weeks, while we got a series of vaccinations, we were quarantined in a nice place, right on the shore. Of course we also trained during that time. There were daily calisthenics, daily drills. After quarantine we practiced marksmanship and learned the nomenclature of the rifle and how to care for it, how to put it together, take it apart. There was marching and more marching. We marched down the center of Collins Avenue — now one of the most expensive stretches of real estate you can find, but back then hardly built-up.\n\nIt may have been winter back home, but it was hot down in Florida. We got whipped into shape and we got sunburned. It seemed like you couldn’t get away from grit and sand. On the firing range, every time you spent a round, the rifle would kick sand in your face.\n\nA nice thing happened after my quarantine period. John Albert had been through Miami Beach before me. He’d gotten to know a girl down there whose family was in the dry-cleaning business. He called me and said, “When you can get out of that hotel, let me know and I’ll introduce you to a family who can take you out for a nice meal.” So I did, as soon as I could arrange an evening’s leave.\n\nNext afternoon comes this pretty girl, swinging into the hotel driveway in a sleek convertible. She was Italian. She drove up like she owned the place, her dark hair flying in the breeze. Man, talk about the whooping and hollering all over the hotel when that girl pulled up in her sports car! We couldn’t get out of there fast enough for all the wolf-whistling. I spent a very pleasant evening with her and her family.\n\nAlthough I was a private, I had had nearly four years of military training, thanks to M.I. and ROTC, so I was put in charge of a company of cadets right from the beginning. I knew how to march, how to drill. I could make a company fall in, dress right, dress left, move forward and back. I had learned at M.I. that the idea of marching is to move a large number of men in an orderly fashion. If you told a bunch of guys, “Let’s meet at the mess hall,” hell, they’d be all day getting there, then waste all kinds of time getting inside, getting seated. But if you taught them to move in formation, no problem. You let one squad go in, then let another squad peel off, go in, and if you moved them like that, everyone was present and accounted for. Marching was the only way to do it.\n\nNow marching was one thing, but mess hall definitely another. In the army, they don’t call it “mess” for nothing. Let me tell you a story about that.\n\nI had brought my company to mess during the middle of a very hot day. I lined them all up, they went in by squads, I brought up the rear. There was a big, big sign that said, “Take all you can eat, but eat all you take.” Normally that wasn’t a problem. On that particular day, however, as I walked in, I smelled something that just didn’t smell right. I have a very sensitive nose. Something was not right at all. As I passed down the mess line, I discovered what it was. They put this meat on my platter. It was mutton, but definitely not lamb chops. It was an old boar sheep and it stank to high heaven. Now your mess platter was a stainless steel thing, separated by little ridges, so that foods didn’t run together, so that hot things didn’t mix with cold things. The last item they served you in the mess line was a scoop of ice cream. Well, hell, ice cream on warm stainless steel? Melts in a snap! You hit it with a spoon, it’s juice. So by the time I sat down, my ice cream had melted and it was the only thing I wanted to eat that day. That meat? I thought about trying to take a bite of it, but I just couldn’t. I knew that if I ate it I would get sick. I said to myself, “I cannot eat this. I will not eat this.”\n\nBefore you leave the mess hall, you dump the scraps off your platter, you rinse it in a big barrel of hot water, then you stack it nearby. And as you do all this, you pass before this big staff sergeant sitting up on a high stool. Well, I carried right past him the whole platter of food that I was going to dump.\n\nHe said, “What are you doing, soldier?”\n\nI said, “I’m fixing to go to my room.”\n\nHe said “You’re not going anywhere. Did you read that sign?”\n\nI said, “Yeah, but I can’t eat this. This is rotten. It stinks. Can’t you smell it?”\n\n“You took it, you eat it,” he ordered.\n\n“I’m not gonna do it,” I said and looked him in the eye. “You can shoot me, but I’m not gonna eat it.”\n\nAnd I scraped it off in the garbage, took care of the platter, and walked out. I guess that sergeant didn’t want to get off his stool. He didn’t say anything else. I might have been a buck private, but I was still a company commander and I had too much to do to get sick. Anyway, for the rest of the day, I lived off a big old Hershey chocolate bar. You could buy them at the PX for practically nothing.\n\nBasic training in Miami Beach lasted about six weeks. It was unremarkable except for the heat, the hurry-up-let’s-go feeling of the place, with hundreds and hundreds of young men in government-requisitioned hotels, anxious to get into a later stage of training where they could distinguish themselves. They worked us all day. There wasn’t time for a nap.\n\nIn early April of 1943 we were issued wool uniforms, so we knew we were going somewhere colder. It turned out to be Raleigh, North Carolina. I was made commander of the troop train that transported us. My job was to see that five hundred soldiers, along with their files, arrived at the Cadet Training Detachment located on the campus of North Carolina State University. I was to deliver men and files to the commanding officer there.\n\nThe train didn’t have sleeping cars, just passenger coaches, each with a potbelly stove situated in the center for heat. All the coaches were crowded, mine with stacks of file boxes as well as soldiers. The only place you could be by yourself was in the little restroom — not that you wanted to be by yourself, but I usually had always been by myself when I said my prayers at night. And I recall going into this little room with the train going clickety-clack and kneeling down in that little restroom and saying my prayers for the night.\n\nAs a child I’d been taught to kneel beside my bed every night to say the Lord’s Prayer, and to ask God to take care of my family, to keep them all safe. And again in the morning. I can’t remember a time when I didn’t do this. It was part of life. Even today I usually begin my prayers with the Lord’s Prayer. Then I remember specifics and people that I feel honored to pray for, from a prayer list I keep mentally or write down.\n\nThere was never a question of changing this habit, even in the army. I could have knelt in public. That would have been respected, but prayer was a private thing with me. The millions of servicemen facing combat, I’m sure they drew strength from prayer. I know I did. But everything I did, I did without hesitation because I just accepted it as what I was supposed to do. I don’t know how exactly to put it, but I didn’t stop when I was given an order. I didn’t question it. When I went down to the ready room, and the commanding officer said, “This is the mission for today,” I never asked “Why?” You do what you must.\n\nChapter Six\n\nNow Evelyn and I had not lost touch. Far from it. We wrote each other regularly. We talked on the phone. When I learned that I was going to N.C. State for cadet training, I told her, and she decided to enroll in summer school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which was only about twenty-five miles from Raleigh. She planned to room with friends she had met during her freshman year at Randolph-Macon. But I had plans for us that went beyond the summer.\n\nI had fallen in love with Evelyn the moment I met her at that football game in Tuscaloosa. Over the time we’d known each other, our love had grown. I wanted her to be my wife. I called my mother and asked her to find me a diamond ring.\n\nOn a weekend in June I asked Evelyn to dinner. She caught a bus to come over to the base on a Friday evening. When she arrived on campus, my unit, Squadron H, Flight 1, formally presented themselves to her, marching past her in review. I think she was very pleased by the VIP treatment. Over dinner, I proposed.\n\n“I asked Mama to send me this,” I said, offering her the ring and my hand forever.\n\nThis moment of happiness came with a chuckle. When I had asked Mama to send me a size four-and-a-half band, she said, “Charlie, Evelyn’s finger can’t be that small!” So she sent a size six. It really was too big. But Evelyn wore it that night. She wrapped it with string so it would fit.\n\nThat one memorable evening was all that we had in North Carolina. Evelyn got sick with a kidney infection and had to return to Mobile. I knew she was going to be OK but I worried about her. The base newspaper had this to say about it:\n\nNow that Student Captain McNeil’s girl is in the hospital for a little while, he\n\nwanders around like a lost soul. Sunday he spent most of his evening in town\n\nholding up a lamp standard on Fayetteville Street. Here’s hoping his girl recovers\n\nquickly and Charlie is once again his usual self.\n\nI don’t remember anything about holding up that lamppost, but I was enough of my usual self to command my company. I had good help doing that from a young man I had come to know. We had bunked together since my arrival in Raleigh. In the evenings, he knelt to say his prayers the same as I did. He was a fine Christian boy and an all-state athlete from Memphis, Tennessee. When I was appointed squadron commander, he was appointed group supply officer. His name was Johnny McMaster. He became my best friend.\n\nAnother friend I made was Bobby Thompson from Yazoo City, Mississippi. I met him at a pool, swimming laps. I noticed he wore a Pike ring, so we struck up a conversation over our fraternity. Not only did we have the fraternity in common, but he also had a girlfriend he had proposed to in June. We talked about when we were going to get married.\n\nFrom April through July we pursued our cadet training in Raleigh. They worked us from daylight to dusk. We’d just flop in bed at night. A lot of it was classwork, technical instruction. I suppose they were also testing mental aptitude for pre-flight training.\n\nOne day I got notification to report to the commanding officer of the Cadet Training Detachment. The C.O. sat me down and gave me a highly confidential assignment. He told me to be on the lookout for any type of conversation or activity that might indicate that anyone was trying to infiltrate any military unit, or was passing information about the military to any organization. I was to write a weekly letter reporting my observations — that of said date I had, or had not, seen or known of such activity. I was to address the letter to the ACME Insurance Company, P.O. Box such and such.\n\nThe assignment was for counterintelligence. I was gratified by the C.O.’s confidence in me and more than a little surprised that such responsibility should be given to a young cadet. This responsibility followed me throughout my tour of duty, wherever I was assigned. I wrote those letters every week. I never noticed any subversive activity, but I kept my eyes and ears open. I suppose the ACME Insurance Company heard from me nearly as often as Evelyn.\n\nAt the end of July I received orders to report to Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery for pre-flight training. It was a big base with beautiful old brick and stone homes for the officers. The planes based there were for the high command. They’d fly them all over the world from Maxwell. My good friend, Johnny McMaster, transferred with me. He would become second-in-command in my company. Bobby Thompson came along, too. We agreed that August might be a good time to marry our girls — I guess we thought the girls might agree, too. Except for a brief period in Nashville, I would continue training in Montgomery until October.\n\nAt Maxwell I was a company commander in charge of three squadrons, each composed of about eighteen men. When new boys assigned to my company arrived on the troop train, I had Johnny fall ’em in, meaning: get ’em out, rack ’em up, ten-hut, no talking, don’t bat a damn eye. Then I’d walk up in parade dress — cap, gloves, saber, Sam Brown belt – and inspect them.\n\nOne morning Johnny said to me, “You won’t guess who’s coming in on the troop train!”\n\nI said, “Who?”\n\nHe said, “Bob Boykin.”\n\nI said, “He’s in this damn outfit coming in? Well, take me to that S.O.B.!”\n\nBob was actually a good friend of mine. He was Congressman Frank Boykin’s son. I’d met him in Mobile through Evelyn. He’d dated her in high school. I’d known him in Tuscaloosa, too. I was going to have some fun, hazing old Bob.\n\nSo Johnny had the new men all assembled and I strode up to inspect them. I stopped right in front of Boykin and glared at him.\n\nWhen he recognized me, delighted to see a familiar face, he blurted out, “Hey, man!”\n\nI shot back, “Shut up! Don’t you open your damn mouth.”\n\nHe looked at me, stunned.\n\nI said, “Don’t you dare talk to me!” Then I turned to McMaster and said, “Write this guy up and have him come by my room.”\n\nWhen he came by later, sort of sheepish, I said, “You got surprised, didn’t you?” We had a laugh about it. He followed me through training at Maxwell along with my other men. I set him up to be an officer and he thanked me all the way through. He busted out of flight school, though. I think he went on to navigator or bombardier school, but I heard he washed out there too.\n\nTraining at Maxwell was mental as well as physical. The classroom work included fundamentals of aeronautical engineering, the physics of flight, basic navigation, radio routines. The instructors were also measuring our athletic ability, our reflexes, our ability to respond quickly under pressure. Everybody wanted to be a pilot, of course. But not everyone could be. By the end of July we were being sorted into classes: those who’d continue training as pilots, those who’d train as navigators or bombardiers. We were notified to transfer to the Army Air Center in Nashville, Tennessee, to await our slots.\n\nEvelyn had visited me in Montgomery during the summer. She had driven up from Frisco City with my mother to plan our wedding. We had hoped to have it in Mobile, but with the news of my posting to Tennessee, we knew that wouldn’t be possible. I didn’t know where I’d be transferred next. Evelyn had an aunt and cousins in Franklin, not far from Nashville, so we decided that with them, along with my parents and her parents, we could have a nice family gathering for the service. We set a date for Nashville.\n\nOn August 19, 1943, Evelyn and I stood before an army chaplain and exchanged vows in the small base chapel surrounded by our family. My outfit attended in parade dress and crossed swords above us as we came from the chapel, man and wife. We had a fine reception downtown in the Hermitage Hotel. Then we left in a rented car for our honeymoon in Chattanooga.\n\nI didn’t know that the army was having maneuvers in the mountains between Nashville and Chattanooga. The C.O. had given me a six-day pass for my honeymoon, but he didn’t say anything about army exercises going on, tying up the roads. Well, as we headed east into the mountains, it seemed like every turn we’d make, there would be a big old army tank blocking the way. Rolling up into the hills we couldn’t make more than three miles an hour, waving at everybody, moving past roadblocks, and though I was only a cadet captain, my uniform looked like an officer’s, so the boys would salute me, wave us on.\n\nWe got to Chattanooga sometime that night. Our destination was the Lookout Mountain Hotel, an exclusive place with terrific views of the surrounding country. It was a fine resort with well-appointed rooms. The dining room had tall chairs and beautiful linens and beautiful crystal.\n\nWe were expecting to meet Bobby Thompson and his new wife there the next day. They were driving up from Mississippi. But we met somebody else first.\n\nGetting on the elevator the next morning, we encountered Herbert Baum and his wife. Mr. Baum worked with Evelyn’s father at Protective Life Insurance Company. They were colleagues. Evelyn’s father and mother were friends with the Baums. Evelyn had known them since she was a little girl. The Baums, however, did not know me.\n\nMr. Baum looked startled. He was more surprised than Evelyn. He looked at her. She had my hand. And he looked at her. And he tried not to look at me. He finally said, “Evelyn?! Does your father know you’re here?”\n\nI thought to myself, “You stupid old bastard, how can you imagine — ?” while Evelyn got tongue-tied and turned red as Superman’s cape. Of course, she finally made introductions and explained.\n\nWhen the Thompsons arrived, we told them what happened and had a big laugh over it. We toured Chattanooga together for the next week. Evelyn and Bobby’s wife, Mary, became a good friends.\n\nIn early November I was transferred to the first of a series of bases in the Midwest where I would undertake flight training. The first stop was Cairo, Illinois, about 150 miles northwest of Nashville. Cairo was big town situated where the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers come together. It was corn and cotton country. Over that flat prairie land I learned to fly the PT-13 — PT for “Primary Trainer.” This aircraft was recognized as probably the best primary trainer there was. The Navy used them exclusively. It was a bi-wing job with maybe a 225-horsepower engine that required a crew chief to hand-crank the prop. The controls were simple, just a stick and pedals. Instrumentation was also basic. There was an oil pressure gauge, an air speed indicator, and a needle ball. The needle ball showed your airborne orientation. There were two open cockpits, one behind the other. The instructor sat in the rear. He’d talk to you over a little tube that ran between the cockpits and plugged into your ear.\n\nI don’t remember my civilian instructor’s name, but he was fantastic. He probably started out barnstorming. He could make that plane do anything. He could put it into a stall and walk it down using just the foot pedals. The first couple of times I went up with him I got airsick. My cockpit was a mess. I had to clean it out myself. After the second time he told me, “I’m sorry, Mr. McNeil, but if you get sick again, I’ll have to put you on a check-ride and you’ll probably wash out.”\n\nWell, I didn’t eat anything the rest of the day. I didn’t eat anything that night. I didn’t eat anything for breakfast the next morning. When we went up again, I got sick, but I didn’t throw up — there was nothing to throw up — so he didn’t know anything about it. From then on, I got used to the motion. I never got sick again.\n\nNow the autumn is cold up in Illinois. Cold on the ground and colder thirty-five hundred feet up, flying eighty miles an hour. But I was dressed for it: fleece-lined pants and heavy boots; fleece-lined leather jacket with a big turn-up collar; scarf, gloves, and, of course, a leather helmet and goggles. It was actually warm in the cockpit because I had a control that fed heat into it from the engine. I wore a parachute, too — folded it myself. When I strapped into the cockpit, I sat on it.\n\nI’d fly mornings and afternoons. I’d go through takeoff procedure, climb, get out of the pattern and fly over to an auxiliary field where I’d circle, land, taxi, then take off again. Landing was a little tricky. The trainer’s front wheels were only about four or five feet apart and there was a little wheel on the tail, so you had to set it down just so. It would ground-loop if I wasn’t careful. A lot of times I’d go up and find a cloud and practice landing on that cloud.\n\nI practiced aerobatic flying: how to do rolls and loops. The carburetors in those planes weren’t pressurized they way they are now, so at certain angles and speeds, the G-force would drain the gasoline out of the carburetor and the engine would cut off. What to do? Put the plane into a dive until the wind speed would crank the prop, kick the engine on again. I learned how to stall the plane and recover control. I learned how to put it into a spin and pull it out. I learned to turn that PT-13 every which-a-way. The first couple of times I might have been a little nervous during these maneuvers, but I had complete confidence in my instructor. He taught me to fly.\n\nI was the first in my squad"
