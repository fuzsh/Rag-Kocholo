Schneidereith & Sons, Baltimore, MD:\n\n\"Another Puritan who settled in St. Leonard's Creek Hundred, was William Parrott, one of the Puritan Commissioners of Calvert County in 1654. The well proportioned old brick house still standing on the shores of the Patuxent River about midway between St. Leonard's Creek and Battle Creek marks the site. It is known as Parrott's Cage, or simply, The Cage. This property has been in the possession of the Parran family for many generations and is one of the finest plantations in Calvert County.\"\n\n\"William Parrott served also as an Associate Justice during part of the Puritan era.\"\n\n\"St. Leonard's Creek Hundred was settled at a very early date, and most of its choicest locations came into the possession of Cavalier families, such as the Brookes, the Broomes, and Attorney-General Richard Smith, and of the original group of Puritans, such as Peter Johnson, Robert Taylor, and William Parrott.\"\n\n[Note: the following passage has at least 2 innacuracies. First, it states William was a Huguenot, simply because there are records for Parot Huguenots in England. This conclusion totally ignores the fact that there were also Perrots in England, who were not of Huguenot origin. Secondly, there is no proof Gabriel was son of William, and it must be explained why William does not mention Gabriel in his will. There is no documentation that supports that the Benjamin mentioned is a descendant of Gabriel, as he is not mentioned in his will or any other document; however the possibilty cannot be excluded.]\n\n\"William Parrott was one of the Puritan settlers of lower Calvert County. In 1652 he received a grant of The Cage, sometimes called \"Parrott's Cage,\" a plantation on the Patuxent River, about midway between St. Leonard's Creek and Island Creek. Like many of the Puritans, the Parrott family were French Huguenots. Their name appears on the early Huguenot records in England as Parot. William Parrott was a Justice during the Puritan era, and held other offices. He owned lands in Anne Arundel County and in Prince George's County, as well as in Calvert. He had a son, Gabriel Parrott, who resided for the most part in Anne Arundel County. His daughter Susannah Parrott, married George Parker II, and and after his death she became the wife of Col. John Mackall. Many famous men and women of later generations trace their ancestry back to the Parrott family though this marriage. Benjamin Parrott, who is listed on the Rent Rolls as the owner of Stoakley, was probably a son of Gabriel Parrott. He seems to have been the last of the men of the Parrott family to have resided in Calvert County.\"\n\nWilliam married Unknown.\n\nNotes: Last name might have been Jenkinson.

The mill, on the same road that served Lyon's Mill down on the creek, carded wool and spun cotton. It was in operation in 1813 and supported a household of five people. His home, \"Elderalie,\" was north of Georgetown in what is now Montrose Park. Nothing remains of Parrott's Mill.\n\n====================\n\nThe Union Bank of Georgetown, incorporated on February 18, 1811, included among its founders many names prominent in Georgetown's history - Samuel Davidson, Thomas Corcoran, Francis Dodge, Richard Parrott, John Teakle, among others.

It became the property of Richard Parrott by three con-veyances between 1804 and 1813. In one of the deeds the dam over the creek afterwards known as Lyon's Dam is mentioned, showing it was built over one hundred years ago. During the ownership of Parrott he used the level path along the side of the woods as a rope walk, rope being then in great demand for the numerous vessels visiting the port, and by the name \"The Rope Walk\" it was known to subsequent owners. In deeds as early as 1817 not only the rope walk but the gardens are mentioned, and from constant refer-ence in subsequent deeds to gardens they must have been show places for many years. In 1822 Parrott died, designating himself in his will as \"of Elderslie adjoining Georgetown\"; so it is probable that the place formerly bore the name of \"Elderslie.\" His estate was much involved, and the property with the exception of the woodland on the east was sold under decree in chancery to Clement Smith in 1822.\n\n==============\n\n2. Biographical note on Richard Parrott:\n\nIn his Chronicles of Georgetown, D.C., 1751-1878 (Washington, D.C., R. O. Polkinborn, 1878), Mr. Richard Jackson relates an incident which involved Mr. Parrott. \"On the 26th of September, 1810, an ordinance was passed authorizing Richard Parrott to make a rope to survey the width of the Potomac River. \"The rope was duly made was anchored on one shore, and men on the other began to pull the rope tight. It could not be done however: \"the whole town could not draw the rope into a straight ine.\" It finally had to be pulled ashore and the Potomac was left unmeasured. (p. 37).\n\nhttps://cdn.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/dc/dc0000/dc0002/data/dc0002data.pd\n\n================\n\nhttps://georgetownmetropolitan.com/2015/09/25/now-and-a-long-time-ago-montrose/\n\nOur first knowledge of the present Montrose Park was as Parrott's Woods. Richard Parrott conducted there a \"rope walk.\" It seems that when they made rope it was necessary to have a long, even stretch where the rope-makers walked up and down manufacturing the hemp into rope. And, of course, in this town with all its ships, the making of rope was a lucrative business.\n\nMr. Parrott evidently was kind in loaning his property for picnics too, for again Mr. Gordon gives us vivid pictures of the Fourth of July annual picnic of all the Protestant Sunday schools. It seems to have been a huge affair, with flags and banners and rosettes of various colors adorning the scholars of the different schools.\n\n============\n\nhttps://georgetownmetropolitan.com/2010/05/14/battle-of-the-parks-which-is-your-favorite/\n\nMontrose Park is on the northeast border of Georgetown between R St., Oak Hill Cemetery, Dumbarton Oaks (both the estate and the nature preserve) and Rock Creek Park. The land that became Montrose Park was owned by Robert Parrott a rope maker. The long walkway lit by gas lamps once served as the ropewalk where workers braided the rope. The lot was used by Georgetown families for recreation and was known as Parrott's Woods. In the early part of the 20th century, the land was proposed for a housing development (in fact a house once sat on the property). Sarah Louisa Rittenhouse and a group of other Georgetowners petitioned Congress to purchase the land for the benefit of the public.

The bell tapped the number 15, and then it was proved that the fire was near the corner of First and Foundry streets, box No. 15, which has been used so often during the past year, being situated on that corner.\n\nSoon the streets were alive with the clang of heavy fire apparatus and the clatter of feet of hundreds of curious individuals eager to to look upon the demon destroyer and see a gallant fight, such as Dayton's firemen always give. There was no need of hesitancy of an informed guide, as a great light in the north, illuminating the entire northern space of heaven, gave evidence that the fire was near as the box proclaimed it to be. The fire was a large and fierce one. This could be told by the bright and steady glare above the tree tops. It was such a glare, surmounted as it was by pale, light smoke and this in its turn by volumes darker, as it drew away from the light of the flames and stood out with the black bacground of the dark sky, as to strike terror into the heart of the householder as he beholds it in the distance, if it seems near his beloved home.\n\n<snip>\n\nThe flames were immensely hot, and as sparks and brands were blown about in myriads, the firemen understood, as with anxious eyes they regarded the flying brandsm that it was to prevent a conflagration and extinguish a fire that would be their work, expecially as the neighborhood was the location of valuable shops, and soon their predictions were verified, for almost instantaneously, it seemed, the flames fastened on H.R. Parrott & Co.'s large furniture factory, on the west, the office of the shop on the east, <snip>.\n\nThe loss on Parrott & Gilbert's lumber, probably amounting to about $300, is fully insured. The safe, though not fire proof, was saved. Firemen were instructied to save it if possible, and they did not let the flames become hot enough to destroy the iron box. All of the valuable papers were saved.\n\n<snip>\n\nNotes.\n\n<snip>\n\nMessrs. H.R. Parrott & Co.'s property was heroically protected.\n\nThe Dayton Daily Herald, 13 Sep 1888, p 2\n\n161 F vii.
