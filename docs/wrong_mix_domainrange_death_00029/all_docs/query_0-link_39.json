At findagrave.com see photos of their tombstones in Whittle and Hubbard Cemetery, Castle Rock, Cowlitz, Washington, USA.\n\nNotes for RAY WARREN BUKER:\n\nFrom The Daily News, Longview, Washington, April 8, 1972:\n\n.....Ray Buker attended classes at the Ostrander School, where his brother, then 17 years old, was the teacher. At that time there were 23 children in the school. At the age of 14, his school years were behind him, and Ray began working in logging. One job was driving the bull teams and he still has an ox yoke he used then. Around 1915 Ray and his brothers (there were six Buker brothers) entered into partnership, know as Hyde and Buker Brothers, and this company logged at Toutle and Siver Lake for many years. They also logged at Toledo for several years. It was while they were logging at Toledo that Ray met and married Bertha Stoner, the pretty young schoolteacher. She was born in Garber, Oklahoma, but was raised and educated in Oregon and Washington. Mrs. Buker's teaching career has spanned 26 years in this area. She taught at Kelso and Toutle in addition to Toledo.\n\n.....Everyone who has heard the story of the lost Spaniard's Gold Mine dreams of finding it, but few have come as close as Mr. Buker. The story is of a Spaniard and his mule who traveled through the Mt Adams and Mt St Helens country, coming out to civilization very seldom. But when he did come out to purchase supplies, he always paid in gold dust or nuggets. Many people tried to follow him to find out the location of his mine, but he always eluded them. One day he appeared at Castle Rock, minus his mule and equipment and near death. He died before he could disclose any more than that he had buried his equipment at his mine when his mule died and it was at the base of a big tree, up one of the tributary creeks of the Toutle. One day, while operating a donkey to yard the logs on Wyant Creek, Ray discovered a gold pan caught in the line. It was not until some time later that he connected this in his mind with the Spaniard's Gold Mine. But the mine was supposed to be at the base of a big tree and in that particular area, there were at least 4,000 big trees, so he decided the choice wasn't narrowed down enough to be very interesting. In this area, also, he cut one tree 10'8\" in diameter. It had been left for a cull by the earlier loggers as they were unable, with their equipment to fall it. This tree brought in $1,300, as it was all peeler quality. It probably paid as well as the Spaniard's Mine.\n\n.....Ray is a man of many talents. He has a table in his home that he built that would rival the product of a journeyman cabinetmaker. The wood was cut from a wild cherry tree more than 50 years before. One log from this tree was cut into 2x12s sixteen feet long. And to anyone familiar with wild cherry trees, this one was certainly a rarity, as they are seldom seen any larger than 8 to 10 inches in diameter. He also made a small violin and carrying case. It is a perfect miniature, with a sweet, true tone. However, he admits with a smile that the only instrument he actually plays is a music box! Another miniature is the steam engine he built when he was 8 years old by casting babbit around a shotgun shell to form the cylinder and using pieces of umbrella ribs for some of the parts. This tiny engine is a working model and Buker still fires it up occasionally.\n\n.....In all his many years living and working in the woods, he has never killed a deer or an elk. But he does have some for pets. The deer come up into the front yard and beg for apples and there is a herd of elk numbering from 18 to 20 that live year around in the Buker property. These elk will take food directly from his hands and I have seen him unconcernedly scratching the antlers of a full grown wild bull elk.\n\n.....In the last few years he has built two steam cars and one electric car. These are not toys, but are full-sized models. Asked what use he puts them to, he said, \"Oh, I drive them down the lane to the mail box to pick up the mail.\" The mail box is over a quarter of a mile from the house and the road back is steep, but the cars travel it with no difficulty. Photography has also been a sideline and Mr. Buker has many pictures he has taken over the years. He has always done his own developing and printing. He invented one of the first drag saws, which he patented on Apr. 19, 19(??).\n\n.....The Buker family has held a reunion each year for the last 22 years at the site of the original Leavell homestead. Attendance runs from 135 to 164. Mr. Buker grins and says, however, that he estimates he has at least a half a million relatives. He will celebrate his 84th birthday this year and I asked what his plans are for the coming year. At present, he is supervising some selective logging on his home place and is also working on a second book of poetry. His first book was published some years ago. Then, he said, in his spare time, he plans to build a car that will run on compressed air.\n\n(Note: The Buker family reunion is still held, as always, on the third Sunday in August at Seacrest Park)\n\n1165.

Farm Laborer --- ---\n\nJack was a traveler, always heading for the wilderness, a bear-hunter and bee-keeper with wild stories to tell. He worked at carpentry. Once Doc Jessup hired him to put cedar shingles on the barn roof; when he heard bees, he got so excited he almost rolled off! He lured them into empty nail kegs to make hives. He would put bees on his chest like a long beard. Once he held one out to Boone's female rat-terrier and it stung her on the nose; after that, one merely had to hold out one's fingers touching and make a buzzing noise to send her running for cover! He would beat on a pie pan to call the bees to him. He called Boone \"Boonie,\" and got him started keeping bees. (But was this Uncle Jack, or brother John Edward?)\n\nSource Citation: Year: 1900; Census Place: Madison, Tipton, Indiana; Roll T623_406; Page: 2A; Enumeration District: 127.\n\nJohn E Leavell...40...Jan 1860...IN, IN, VA...farm laborer\n\nElizabeth A Leavell...30...Feb 1870...IN, Wisconsin, IN...5 children, 5 living\n\nBessie L Leavell...13...June, 1886...IN, IN, IN...dau\n\nJesse B Leavell...11...May 1889...IN, IN, IN...dau\n\nClifford Leavell...9...Sept 1890...IN, IN, IN...son\n\nHarmon Leavell...6...Apr 1894...IN, IN, IN...dau\n\nGuy Leavell...3...Aug 1896...IN, IN, IN...son >P> Source Citation: Year: 1910; Census Place: Paradise, Grand Traverse, Michigan; Roll: T624_648; Page: 8A; Enumeration District: 0049; Image: 276; FHL Number: 1374661.\n\nJohn E.
