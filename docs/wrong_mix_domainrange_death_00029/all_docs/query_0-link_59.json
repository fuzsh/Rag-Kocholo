        "text": "Following are some of the descendants of Diel Bauer, who immigrated from Germany about 1750 and settled in Plaintfield Township, Northampton County, Pa. For the ancestors of Tillman Bower of Tompkins County, N.Y., go to http://bowershomestead.com/--tillman-bower-family.html.\n\nDIEL and ELIZABETH BAUER\n\nDiel Bauer was born in Germany and immigrated to America around 1750.\n\nMarried Elizabeth.\n\nChildren: (1)\n\nDielman, born 1744.\n\nDietrich, born April 4, 1749.\n\nMaria Sophia, born April 24, 1750. Married Frederick Paul.\n\nElizabeth, born Dec. 7, 1751. Married Valentine Metz.\n\nJohn, born April 6, 1753.\n\nMargaret. Married George Peter Gauff.\n\nBarbara. Married Conrad Kocher.\n\nEve, born Dec. 6, 1762. Married William Freeman.\n\nCatherine. Married Abraham Shupp.\n\nDiel’s parents are unknown. The name “Diel” is very unusual and may point toward a place of origin. It is a shortened form of the name “Dietrich” that usually appears in Hesse. According to information supplied to the Daughters of the American Revolution, Diel may have been born in 1718 or 1719 in either Hesse-Kassel or Hesse-Darmstadt in Germany. However, this file is riddled with errors and cannot be trusted in the least. (2)\n\nHis name is often spelled Dill, Diehl or Thill in records. Bauer is often anglicized to Bower in civil records, but records from German-language churches always spell the name Bauer. He signed his own name “Diel Bauer” in a 1772 deed that covered the sale of his farm to his son Dietrich.\n\nIt is possible that Diel immigrated to America with his mother and stepfather. The will of Johann Nicklas Schmith (Schmitt) of Lowhill Township, Northampton County, Pa., refers to “my son Johan Thill Bauher.” Past researchers consulted the English translation of the will and believed that this indicated Diel was this man’s son-in-law. However, genealogists in Germany, consulting the original German version of the will, said this reference indicates Diel was his stepson. Also, other married daughters are listed under their own names and not under their husbands’ so it seems unlikely that Elizabeth would be different. If this is the case, Diel’s mother was probably Maria Margareta Schmidt, who had remarried after Diel’s father died. The order of the names may also indicate that Diel’s sisters or half-sisters were Anna Barbara Meiher, Anna Elisabeth Wick and Elisabeth Wieder, since their names follow his. It is possible that Diel’s immigration records are under the name of Schmitt. (3)\n\nIt is uncertain exactly when the Bauer family came to America. Diel was naturalized in Philadelphia on April 10, 1760. Normally, German immigrants who arrived in Pennsylvania swore allegiance to the British king upon arrival. However, this does not appear to have been the case with Diel. He does not appear in Pennsylvania immigration records until 1760 but he does appear in other records as early as 1750. It’s possible that he immigrated through another port that was less conscientious about immigration procedures. Diel’s immigration record appears in “Pennsylvania Archives” under the act of parliament calling for the naturalization of foreigners “having inhabited and resided the space of seven years and upwards in his Majesty’s Colonies in America.” (4)\n\nDiel first shows up in what is now Montgomery County, Pa., in 1750.\n\nA notice printed in a German-language newspaper on Aug. 18, 1750 says Diel was living on land at Falckner Swamp in what was then Philadelphia County. He also appears as the father of Maria Sophia Baur, who was baptized Oct. 14, 1750, at Falkner Swamp Reformed Church in New Hanover Township. (5)\n\nSometime before 1752, Diel moved northward to Northampton County. He was among the early settlers of the area, which had been “purchased” from the Lenape Indians about 15 years earlier in a controversial stunt known as the Walking Purchase. In the 1700s, German immigrants constituted about 90 percent of the county’s population. (6)\n\nDiel first appears in Northampton County records on Dec. 5, 1752. The business transaction is among the first in the history of the county, which was separated from Bucks County in 1752. It is recorded in Deed Book A-1, page 5.\n\nThe book “A Frontier Village” mentions the transaction, which followed attempts by John Weidman to build a grist mill on Lefevre Creek. “Weidman did not have sufficient funds with which to complete the mill, so he borrowed about 46 pounds from John Lefevre and Dill Bower. To secure the payment of this obligation Weidman, on December 5th, 1752, gave a mortgage on his property, including the mill, to Lefevre and Bower. In this mortgage, it is stated that John Weidman was a millwright, Dill Bower a smith, and John Lefevre an innholder, and that all three were residents of the ‘Forks of the Delaware’, the name by which Forks Township was then known.” (7)\n\nThe fact that Diel had enough spare money to make a loan indicates he was relatively prosperous for that time and place.\n\nIn 1753, the baptism of his son John is recorded at St. Paul’s Evangelical Lutheran Church in Upper Saucon Township, in what is now Lehigh County. However, the family may not have lived near there because they were never listed as communicants at that church.\n\nOn Sept. 3, 1757, an advertisement in a German newspaper reported that Diel Bower had taken possession of land left by Georg Ewy in Bethel Township, Northampton County. (8)\n\nEither at this point or soon thereafter, Diel settled in what would become Plainfield Township in 1762. He lived there until his death. (9)\n\n“History of Northampton County and The Grand Valley of the Lehigh” describes Plainfield Township during the time the Bauer family settled in the area. (10)\n\n“The name Plainfield was given to it as describing its appearance to the first settlers. The surface of the township is almost devoid of trees, except on the margins of the watercourses, where a few dwarf oaks and stunted evergreens grow on the high lands. … There is an opening, or pass, in the mountains called by the German settlers ‘Die Wind Kapf” (Wind Gap), through which no stream or water passes. … It is the only crossing for wagon roads leading from the township across the Blue Mountains,” William J. Heller writes in the history. Diel’s farm was near what is now the town of Wind Gap.\n\n“The first settlers were Germans, who immigrated from their native land, settled around Wind Gap, and erected a house of worship … These were immediately followed by German settlers, and on December 24, 1762, a decree of the court authorized and ordered the laying out and erection of the township,” Heller writes. The new township contained only 300 inhabitants.\n\nHeller is apparently referring to the French and Indian War when he states: “The settlers suffered during the Indian troubles, a temporary fortification being build as a place of refuge.”\n\nThe Bauers worshipped at Plainfield Reformed Church, whose congregation was made up of Germans who settled in the area. The first confirmation class listed in the church’s records contained Diel’s daughter Barbara, who was confirmed April 10, 1763. The second class, which was confirmed Dec. 22, 1765, contained John. (11)\n\nDuring his early years in Plainfield Township, Diel appears several times in the records of the Northampton County Orphan’s Court. In 1763 and 1767, he served on panels reporting on the estates of deceased residents of the township. In 1778, he is listed as “next friend” when Christian Stout was appointed guardian of two children of Joseph Stout. (12)\n\nIn 1772 tax lists, Diel is listed as a farmer. (13)\n\nHowever, Diel seems to have retired from farming in that year. On Aug. 26, he sold his farm to his son Dietrich. The deed recording this transaction says the farm covered 127 acres and was purchased by Diel on Dec. 20, 1763. Dietrich – who is actually listed as “Richard Bauer,” a mistake that was cleared up in a later deed – also received “four cows, four Heifers, five sheep, five lambs, two Horses of three years, a Saddle & all our Utensills of Husbandry to wit a Harrow & Plough with their irons, also two sows & a Barrow Hog.” (14)\n\nIn payment, Diel and Elizabeth received 250 pounds. Dietrich also agree to provide annual allotments of produce, including “Four Bushels of wheat, Twenty Bushells of Rye, One Hundred & fifty Pounds of Pork, twelve pound Hatcheld Flex & twelve pound Hatcheld Tow, each of us a new pair of Shoes, & to keep for use, two cows, at his Expence, and to Give us each year the wool of two sheep, as we shall choose, also apples for own use And when the orchard Hits well a Barrell of syder.” The agreement also called for Dietrich to provide “a quarter part of the Garden-ground, and our Dwelling place in the House, or otherwise to Build us a Room at the Gable end thereof fit and Suitable for us to live in.”\n\nFinally, Dietrich also received a farm hand to help, as the deed states: “I give to my son Richard Bauer two years Servitude more or less of his Brother John Bauer, which is to be compleated & Ended when my said son John arrives to the full age of Twentyone years old and not Before.”\n\nDuring the Revolution, Diel’s sons served in the Northampton County militia. His DAR file says he swore an oath of allegiance to the Colonies; however, his name could easily be mistaken for that of that of Dielman Bauer, who is believed to be Diel’s eldest son. (15)\n\nDiel died sometime before July 21, 1796, when a deed indicated he was deceased. (16) However, it’s possible that he died several years earlier. Diel’s name does not appear among the heads of households in Northampton County in the 1790 Census. That’s not a surprise since he and Elizabeth had become part of Dietrich’s household in 1772. However, Dietrich’s household contained only one adult male and two adult females. It seems most likely that these people were Dietrich, his wife and his mother, and that Diel had already died.\n\nIt is unknown when Elizabeth died. She is not listed as deceased in the 1796 record. However, only one adult female is listed in the 1800 Census, possibly indicating that she had died by that point.\n\nIt is also unknown where the Bauers are buried. It seems likely that their graves are in the cemetery across the road from St. Peter’s Lutheran Church in Plainfield, south of Wind Gap. Several of their children are buried there. If Diel and Elizabeth are buried there, it’s possible that they lie beneath small, irregular stones that don’t bear full inscriptions.\n\n(1) Names come from Northampton County Deed Book A-4, page 35. Birth date for Dietrich comes from “Burial Record of the Old Cemetery of St. Peter’s Church of Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa.,” page 10. Eve and Elizabeth’s are on page 6. Sophia’s comes from “Church Records of the Falkner Swamp Reformed Church,” page 3. John’s birth date is listed in “St. Paul’s Evangelical Lutheran Church,” page 10. There is no documentary evidence that specifically states Dielman – or Tillman as he was later known – was actually a son of Diel. However, the similarity of the very rare names, the links in later baptismal records and the places of residence point toward the link. Family tradition also makes the link, but one must be wary of such information. It should be noted that Dielman is not listed in the deed that names Diel’s children. In addition, a power of attorney giving Dietrich authority to act on Dielman’s behalf calls Dietrich “my trusty and loving friend” rather than brother. The transaction appears in Northhampton County Deed Book F2. (2) The information on the name “Diel” comes from “Deutsches Namen Lexicon,” by Hans Bahlow. The DAR information comes from Diel’s file and that of his son John at the national headquarters in Washington. D.C. The DAR’s link to Hesse comes from a Miss Julia R. Mitchell, who lived at 83 Ellis Ave., Chicago in 1936. It is difficult to say how reliable this information is without any further details. (3) Northampton County Will File 135. (4) “Pennsylvania Archives,” Series 2, Vol. II, page 402. (5) Newspaper listing – originally from Christopher Sower’s Pennsylvanische Geschicht-Schreiber of Germantown – appears in “Genealogical Data Relating to the German Settlers of Pennsylvania and Adjacent Territory,” page 21. The baptismal information comes from “Church Records of the Falkner Swamp Reformed Church,” page 3. (6) Note on Germans from “Some of the First Settlers of The Forks of the Delaware and Their Descendants,” by the Rev. Henry M. Kieffer, 1902, page 5. The purchase involved an agreement – possibly fraudulent – that called for the Lenape tribe to sell to the Penn family a tract of land extending from Easton, Pa., as far north as a man could walk in a day and a half. William Penn’s sons hired a professional walker who covered 70 miles in the allotted time. This was far more territory than the Lenape had anticipated. The tribe complained to the Iroquois Confederation and British officials but to their concerns were rejected and they left the area. The Lenape – also known as the Delawares – filed suit over the purchase as recently as 2004. (7) “A Frontier Village,” page 64. (8) “Genealogical Data Relating to the German Settlers,” page 64.

(1)\n\nMarried Catharine Elisabeth, who was born Dec. 21, 1744. (2)\n\nChildren: (3)\n\nJohn Jacob, born Jan. 11, 1777.\n\nAbraham, born Nov. 28, 1778. Died before 1783.\n\nElizabeth, born Oct. 1, 1780. Married Peter Frutchy.\n\nAbraham, born Feb. 11, 1783.\n\nFrederick, born July 5, 1785.\n\nGeorge, born March 16, 1788. Probably died before 1818.\n\nCatharine, born before 1790. Married Philip Shierman.\n\nDietrich is sometimes referred to as Dieter or Deeder and his last name is often spelled “Bower” in civil records. One property record refers to him as “Richard Bauer.” However, his own signature always reads “Dietrich Bauer.”\n\nDietrich’s place of birth is unknown. His father doesn’t appear in American records until 1750, so it seems likely that Dietrich was born in Germany. The family settled in Northampton County, Pa., in the early 1750s and Dietrich liven there the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1772, Dietrich is listed as a “single man” on the tax records for Plainfield Township, Northampton County. This indicates that he wasn’t married and didn’t own land. (4)\n\nIn Aug. 26 of that year, Dietrich acquired his father’s 127-acre farm. He paid 250 pounds and agreed to provide his parents with annual allotments of produce and a space to live in his house. In 1789 and 1794, Dietrich acquired additional adjoining property from George and Elizabeth Pfeiffer. (5)\n\nIt is not known when Dietrich married Catharine Elisabeth but it seems likely that they wed in 1776 if Jacob was their first child. However, since the younger Catharine’s birthday is unknown, it’s possible she is the oldest child, which would push the Bauers’ wedding a year or two earlier.\n\nThe Bauers worshiped at Plainfield Reformed Church. Most of their children were baptized there between 1777 and 1788. In 1779, Dietrich contributed grain toward the pastor’s salary. He also served as an elder in 1783 and 1794 and as a deacon in 1793. And in 1805, he contributed 3 pounds, 7 shillings and 6 pence to the construction of the congregation’s second building. Only six people contributed more. (6)\n\n“History of Northampton County and The Grand Valley of The Lehigh” describes the Plainfield church. “St. Peter’s Reformed and Lutheran Church dates back to the middle of the eighteenth century. The regular records, however, are extant since 1763. … The original founders of the church were principally Palatines, though there were some Swiss and French Huguenots. The congregation was originally of the Reformed faith.” However, Lutherans began holding services in the same building and in 1832 “were granted equal right in the church and landed property, and from that time it was been practically a union church.” The Reformed and Lutheran congregations maintained a close relationship in the 1900s. The church that currently stands on the property is St. Peter’s Lutheran Church. The Reformed church eventually became Hope United Church of Christ in Wind Gap. (6a)\n\nDietrich appears to have been someone whom neighbors could turn to in time of need. Northampton County Orphans Court records show that he was appointed one of the guardians for the children of Jacob Engler in 1778 and the guardian of the children of Joseph Stout in the 1790s. In 1800, he served as the executor of the estate of George Pfeiffer – perhaps the son of the George Pfeiffer from whom he purchased property – and as guardian of his daughter when his wife, Catharine, died a year later. He also served on panels auditing or reporting on several estates of people from Plainfield Township. (7)\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, Dietrich was active in the Northampton County militia. Pennsylvania required that men swear allegiance to the patriot cause and join the militia if they were able. Those who didn’t were fined. Militia units mustered when a threat manifested itself or they were needed to patrol the frontier.\n\nIn Northampton County, threats usually involved attacks by Native Americans who were allied with the British. The only large engagement fought in the county was the Battle of Wyoming, which occurred in July 1778 near what is now Wilkes-Barre in Luzerne County. Loyalists and their Indian allies wiped out a patriot contingent and forced the surrender of nearby forts. Although the county was generally pretty quiet, Easton was a strategic crossroads. Continental troops often passed through the area en route to campaigns in New Jersey and elsewhere and wounded troops were treated in the town following several battles. (8)\n\nFrom 1777 to 1780, Dietrich served as a sergeant in the 6th Company of the 5th Battalion. In May 1780, Dietrich was selected to be a lieutenant under Capt. Lewis Stacher’s 6th Company, 2nd Battalion. Although the company’s numerical designation changed several times, Dietrich served under Stacher throughout the war. The company mustered on May 16, 1780, April 10, 1781, July 1781 and April 18, 1782. Selection as a militia officer is another measure of Dietrich’s standing the community since officers were elected by members of the unit. (9)\n\nOn May 28, 1782, Dietrich’s militia company was called to active duty “in the service of the United States on the frontiers of said county for two months service.” On this occasion, he served in Capt. Jacob Heller’s 3rd Class of the 2nd Battalion (which was actually under the command of Capt. Abraham Horn, who served in place of Heller). Dietrich served as lieutenant for 60 days, 37 of them on the frontier. This service probably involved patrolling the frontier to reduce the risk of attack by Native Americans.\n\nState records also list Dietrich as a private on the rolls of those receiving depreciation pay following the war. This pay was in the form of certificates designed to offset the depreciation suffered by U.S. currency during the war. It’s uncertain why he would have been listed as a private since no records of service at that rank have turned up.\n\nDietrich continued his militia service after the war’s end. (10) He served as a private in the 7th Company of the 6th Battalion of the county militia, which mustered on May 10, 1784. Two other records in the Pennsylvania State Archives indicate active service. They are dated Jan. 31, 1786, and Jan. 17, 1787, but more research is needed to determine whether they indicate additional active duty or refer to his service on the frontiers in 1782.\n\nDuring this time, Dietrich continued to work the farm in Plainfield Township. Tax records for 1779 indicate Dietrich owned 160 acres. In 1785 tax records, Dietrich is recorded as owning 100 acres of land, two horses and three cows, which was about average for that township. Tax records show one less now in 1786 and a total of four cows in 1788 but the rest of the totals remained the same. (11)\n\nThe 1790 Census records that nine people were living in Dietrich’s household – one adult male, four males under age 16 and four females. Three of the females were Dietrich’s wife and two daughters. The fourth was probably his mother, who presumably had lived with Dietrich since 1772. If that’s the case, it seems likely that Diel had died by this time.\n\nIn 1800, the census shows that Dietrich’s household contained one male age 10-15, one male 16-25, one male 45 and older, one female under 10 and one female 45 and older. Since it seems certain that Dietrich’s daughter were both born by the time of the 1790 Census, it seems likely that the young girl listed in 1800 was one of the orphans whom Dietrich cared for.\n\nThe 1810 Census indicates that only Dietrich and Catharine Elisabeth were living in their household.\n\nOn March 26, 1818, Dietirch and Catharine Elisabeth sold their three contiguous properties to their son Abraham for $4,000. (12) It appears that the couple continued to live with Abraham’s family on the old homestead. Dietrich’s name doesn’t appear among the heads of households in Plainfield Township in the 1820 Census. However, the household of the 37-year-old Abraham contained a male 45 or older, almost certainly Dietrich.\n\nHowever, Catharine Elisabeth died on July 7, 1818, only a few months after the property transaction. (13)\n\nDietrich died April 1, 1826. He had written his will on the same day that he sold his farm. The will mentions that Abraham had paid only $300 of the $4,000 due for the properties. Abraham was to pay off the remaining $3,700 after his parents’ deaths. He was to make annual payments of $200 to his siblings Jacob, Catharine and Elizabeth in rotation until each had received $925. The remaining $925 of the debt was Abraham’s portion of the inheritance. The will also mentions that Dietrich had given money to his son Frederick beforehand so he would not receive payments like his siblings. Since George is not mentioned in the will and does not appear in census records covering Northampton County in the early 1800s, it seems likely that he died before 1818. In subsequent years, Dietrich wrote codicils to his will that reduced the total figure of Abraham’s indebtedness from $3,700 to $2,800 and then to $2,000.\n\nDietrich and Catharine Elisabeth are buried in the cemetery across the road from St. Peter’s Lutheran Church in Plainfield, south of Wind Gap.\n\n(1) Date of birth comes from “Burial Record of the Old Cemetery of St. Peter’s Church of Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa.,” page 10. Father’s name comes from Northampton County Deed Book A-4, page 35, and Deed Book C-2, page 223. (2) Date of birth comes from St. Peter’s burial record, page 10. She is also named in Dietrich’s will, Northampton County Will Book 4, page 120. It is possible that Catharine Elisabeth’s last name was Hann because the Bauers’ are buried beside many Hanns and Frederick Hann was as sponsor at Frederick Bauer’s baptism, usually an indication of relationship. Another possibility is Pfeiffer because Dietrich seems to have had an extremely close relationship with two generations of George Pfeiffers, appearing with them in land records, a will and Orphans Court records. (3) The births and baptisms of most of Dietrich’s children are listed in “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church, Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa., Vol. I.” The husbands of the daughters are named in Dietrich’s will. Presumably the earlier Abraham died before 1783, when the latter Abraham was born. George probably died before 1818 because he isn’t listed in Dietrich’s will, which was drawn up in that year. The only mention of Catharine appears in Dietrich’s will, which states she was the wife of Phillip Shierman. Since there’s no baptismal record for Catharine, her birth date is unknown. The 1790 Census indicates that four females lived in the household – these were probably Dietrich’s mother, wife and two daughters – which would indicate that Catharine was born before that time.

(1)\n\nMarried Catharine Heller on Oct. 4, 1779. Catharina was born March 4, 1759, to Simon and Louisa Heller in Lower Saucon Township, Northampton County. (2)\n\nChildren: (3)\n\nElizabeth, born June 16, 1780.\n\nCatharine, born Dec. 24, 1781.\n\nJohn, born Jan. 30, 1784.\n\nSusanna, born May 5, 1786. (Possibly married Peter Steinmetz.)\n\nMaria, born Aug. 20, 1788. Married Christian Deily.\n\nDaniel, born Aug. 8, 1791.\n\nIn 1772, Diel Bauer sold his land to his son Dietrich. Dietrich also got a farm hand to help, as the deed states: “I give to my son Richard Bauer two years Servitude more or less of his Brother John Bauer, which is to be compleated & Ended when my said son John arrives to the full age of Twentyone years old and not Before.” (4)\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, John served as a private in Capt. Jacob Heller’s company of militia “on the Frontiers of Northampton County” in1781. (5) This service probably involved patrolling the frontier to reduce the risk of attack by Native Americans who were allied with the British.\n\nFollowing the war, John’s family lived in Plainfield Township in Northampton County. Tax lists for 1785 list John as owning two horses, but no land. This probably indicates that he rented a farm or lived on his parents’ farm. In 1786, he is listed as having a horse and a cow. (6)\n\nThe 1790 Census lists John as living in Plainfield and having five children.\n\nThe family worshiped at Plainfield Reformed Church, where their children were baptized.\n\nJohn died on Feb. 23, 1791. He is buried in Plainfield Cemetery across the road from St. Peter’s Lutheran Church in Plainfield Township. (7) Catharine died Nov.\n\n(1) “St. Paul’s Evangelical Lutheran Church,” page 10. Parents also named in Northampton County Deed Book A¸4, page 35. (2) Marriage date figured from tombstone inscription. The information is repeated in the listing for her grave at Findagrave.com. Other information comes from Diel Bauer’s file with the Daughters of the American Revolution; however, this file is incorrect in some instances. The baptismal record for Simon and Louisa Heller’s daughter Catharine is available at Ancestry.com, “Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Church and Town Records, 1708-1985.” (3) Births are listed in “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church, Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa. Vol. I.” Maria’s husband is named in Diel’s DAR file. A Susanna Bauer married a Peter Steinmetz on April 22, 1806, according to “Some of the First Settlers of The Forks of the Delaware and Their Descendants,” page 355. There seem to be no other available Susanna Bauers in the area so she seems a likely candidate. (4) Northampton County Deed Book C¸2, page 223.

(1)\n\nMarried Anna Hess. (See below.)\n\nChildren: (2)\n\nCatharine, born Aug. 12, 1802. Possibly died young.\n\nJacob, born April 20, 1804.\n\nThomas, born Aug. 19, 1806.\n\nMarianne, born Dec. 15, 1809. Married David Walter.\n\nMargaret, born about Jan. 6, 1813. Married Daniel Sandt.\n\nTobias, probably born June 13, 1816, and died Dec. 12, 1836 of consumption.\n\nElisabeth, born Feb. 4, 1819. Married Charles Reeser.\n\nSalome, or Sarah, born April 8, 1821. Married Joseph Metzger\n\nJohn Dietrich, born Oct. 12, 1823, and died Sept. 5, 1825.\n\nJacob was raised on his father’s farm in Plainfield Township. He is listed separately from his father in the Pennsylvania state census of 1800. However, his name does not appear in that year’s federal census, which indicates that he was still living in Dietrich’s household.\n\nIn 1801, Jacob married Anna Hess. (3) Anna was born Dec. 6, 1783, in Northampton County to Jeremiah and Elisabeth Hess. (4) Around the time of Anna’s birth, the Hess family lived in Williams Township, which is near Easton. However, they appear to have lived in Plainfield Township about the time of Anna’s marriage to Jacob. A Jeremiah Hess with roughly the right number of children appears in the township in the 1800 Census.\n\nThe Bauers worshiped at the German Reformed church in Plainfield. Most of their children were baptized in that church and Jacob was listed among contributors to a renovation of the church in 1805. (5)\n\nAt some point, the family moved southward to Forks Township in Northampton County. Jacob does not appear in the 1810 Census in either Plainfield or Forks Township so it is uncertain exactly where he lived at the time. The move probably occurred after the birth of Margaret 1813, who was the last of their children to be listed among the baptisms at Plainfield Reformed Church. The next child to appear in baptismal records is Elisabeth, who was baptized in 1819 at Salem Union Church in Forks Township.\n\nThe 1820 Census lists Jacob Bower in Forks Township. His household contained one male under 10, two males age 10-15, one male 26-44, two females under 10, two females 10-15 and one female 25-44. Two people were engaged in agriculture.\n\nJacob died Jan. 7, 1825. (6) After his death, his brother Abraham Bauer of Plainfield Township was appointed guardian of Margaret, Tobias, Elizabeth and Sarah, who were listed as being younger than 14 years old. (7)\n\nIn the 1830 Census, Anna Bowers is listed in Forks Township. Her household contained one male under 5, one male 15-19, one male 20-29, one female under 5, two females 15-19, one female 20-29 and one female 40-49. Judging from the ages of the people listed, it seem certain that one of Anna’s adult children and his or her spouse where living with her. After consulting the 1840 and 1850 censuses, it seems most likely that the child was Jacob.\n\nAnna’s name does not appear in the 1840 Census, but it seems likely that she was living with her son Jacob in Forks Township. While he and his wife were in their 30s, his household contained one female 50-59, which is the right age range for Anna.\n\nIn the 1850 Census, Anna Bowers, age 66, is listed in Jacob’s household.\n\nAnna is frequently listed as Nancy in civil records, especially real estate transactions involving the Hess family in Luzerne County. She does not appear to have been able to write because she always signed with a mark rather than a signature. That was quite common for women in the early and mid-1800s.\n\nNancy died March 21, 1857. The Bauers are buried at Arndt’s Lutheran Church in Forks Township, just north of Easton. (8)\n\n(1) “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church, Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa. Vol. I,” page 12. Dietrich’s will, Northampton County Will Book 4, page 120. Two Jacobs appear in Northampton County records at this time: the Jacob in whom we are interested and a Jacob in Moore Township, who was married to a woman name Gertraud. Information on this family can be found in “Bauer Family History,” compiled by Andrew and Marguerite Swagler Bauer, a copy of which is in the Easton Public Library’s Marx Room. (2) The records linking Jacob to his children are a mishmash. Most are in “Plainfield Reformed Church,” appearing on pages 50, 53, 58, 65 and 77. Elisabeth’s birth is recorded in “Church Record of Salem Union Church in Forks Township, Northampton County,” which is available at the Easton Public Library. The births of Margaret and John Dietrich are recorded a St. John’s Evangelical Lutheran Congregation in Easton, which are available at the Easton Public Library. For some reason, Margaret’s birth, but no baptism, is also recorded in the Plainfield record. The dates in these two records conflict with each other and with the date on her tombstone at Forks Cemetery in Forks Township (see Anna Margaret Sandt). The youngest surviving children – Margaret, Tobias, Elizabeth and “Sarah” – are listed in Northampton County Orphan’s Court Record 10, page 270, a record made after Jacob’s death. “Sarah” was actually Salome, who’s listed as “Somla Metzger” in Nancy’s estate papers. Salome’s birth date comes from her tombstone at Niskey Hill Cemetery in Bethlehem (see Findagrave.com). The married names of the daughters appear in Nancy’s estate papers. Tobias’ birth and death dates are listed on a tombstone cited in “Burials at Arndt’s Church Near Easton, Pennsylvania,” page 16. He is not listed among Nancy’s heirs in 1857, so it must be assumed he was dead at the time and this is the correct Tobias. (3) According to a manuscript at the Wyoming Valley Historical Society, Anna and Jacob were married Nov. 2, 1801. Records from the church where the Hesses worshipped say an Anna Hess married someone with the first name of Jacob on Nov. 21, 1801. This is probably the record of the Bauers’ wedding. The man’s last name was omitted in the transcript, probably because it was unreadable in the original document. The manuscript is the rough draft for an item in “A History of the Wapwallopen Region,” by Lillie Cameron. It is in the “Hess” file at the historical society in Wilkes-Barre. The church record is in “Some of the First Settlers,” page 349. (4) Anna’s birth is recorded in “Some of the First Settlers of The Forks of the Delaware and Their Descendants,” by the Rev. Henry M. Kieffer, 1902, page 115. Her birth date is also listed on her tombstone. (The year is incorrectly copied in “Burials at Arndt’s Church Near Easton, Pennsylvania.”) A real estate transaction in Luzerne County mentions “Nancy Bauer (late Nancy Hess)” as an heir of Jeremiah Hess. This is Luzerne County Deed Book 22, page 611. Luzerne County Deed Book 35, page 716, describes her as “Nancy Bower (widow and relique of Jacob Bower deceased) of Forks Township, Northampton County.” (5) Plainfield Reformed Church, page 250. (6) Jacob and Anna’s death dates listed in “Burials at Arndt’s Church Near Easton, Pennsylvania,” page 15. Jacob’s estate papers are in Northampton County, File No. 3681. (7) Northampton County Orphan’s Court Record 10, page 270. (8) “Burials at Arndt’s Church” says Anna died in 1854, but her tombstone says 1857. The administration papers for her estate were filed in 1857. Estate papers in File No. 6584 in Northampton County.\n\nABRAHAM and CATHARINE BAUER\n\n(Diel, Dietrich)\n\nAbraham Bauer was born Feb. 11, 1783, in Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa., to Dietrich and Catharine Bauer. (1)\n\nMarried Catharine Keller. (2)\n\nChildren: (3)\n\nCharles, born Sept. 24, 1808.\n\nAnna, born Oct. 14, 1809. Married Conrad Bender.\n\nJohn Jacob, born Feb. 1, 1812.\n\nSamuel, born June 10, 1814.\n\nSusanna. Married Abraham R. Heller.\n\nAbraham, born June 25, 1818.\n\nLevi, born Aug. 25, 1820, and died May 22, 1821.\n\nAdam, born April 6, 1822.\n\nSabina, born Dec. 21, 1824. Married Aaron Roeder.\n\nElizabeth Jane, born Nov. 16, 1827.\n\nReuben Thomas, born Aug. 21, 1830.\n\nThe Bauers lived in Plainfield Township, where Abraham bought his father’s farm in 1818. (4)\n\nIn the 1810 Census, Abraham Bower is listed in Plainfield Township with one male under 10 years old, one male 16-25, one female under 10 and one female 16-25. Since his father’s household is listed separately, it seems likely that Abraham rented a farm at this time.\n\nIn 1820, the household included four males under 10, one male 10-15, one male 25-44, one male 45 or older, two females under 10 and one female 25-44. Two people were “engaged in agriculture.”\n\nThe 1830 Census records that the household contained one male 5-9, one male 10-14, two males 15-19, one male 20-29, one males 50-59, one female under 5, 1 female 5-9, one females 10-14 and one female 30-39.\n\nAbraham was very active in the Plainfield Reformed Church, where most of the children were baptized. On Nov. 27, 1835, he was elected treasurer and paymaster for construction of the church’s third building. He contributed $54 toward construction of the building. Only three people contributed more. (5)\n\nApparently, Abraham was well respected in the community and may have acted as an attorney. His obituary lists him as “Abraham Bauer, Esq.” (6)\n\nAbraham died Nov. 8, 1835. Upon Abraham’s death Peter Frutchy – his brother-in-law – was named guardian of Abraham, Adam and Sabina. (7)\n\nOn July 9, 1837, Catharine married John Shick of Easton. (8)\n\n(1) “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church, Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa. Vol. I,” page 19. (2) Maiden name comes from the Plainfield church record, page 99. (3) Most births are listed in “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church.” Levi listed in “Burials at Arndt’s Church Near Easton, Pennsylvania,” page 10. Daughters’ married names – as of 1835 – and youngest children are listed in Abraham’s will. Levi’s death is recorded in “Burial Records of the Old Cemetery of St. Peter’s Church of Plainfield Township,” page 10. Sabina’s marriage is recorded in Ancestry.com. “Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Church and Town Records, 1708-1985. “ (4) Northampton County Deed Book E5, page 66.

(1)\n\nMarried Susannah Hohenschild on June 4, 1809. (2)\n\nChildren: (3)\n\nWilliam, born Sept. 4, 1809.\n\nGeorge Peter, born Nov. 24, 1811.\n\nPhilip Findley, born Sept. 8, 1817.\n\nCatharine, born Sept. 28, 1819.\n\nThe family lived in Plainfield Township and probably attended Plainfield Reformed Church, where their children were baptized.\n\nIn the 1810 Census, Fred Bower’s household contained one male under 10, one male 25-44 and one female 15-26.\n\nIn 1820, the household contained two males under 10, one male 26-44, two females under 10, one female 10-15 and one female 26-44. One person was engaged in agriculture and one person was engaged in manufacture. If the census numbers are correct, it would seem that at least one of the sons listed in church records had died and that two additional girls had been born.\n\nFrederick’s family seems to disappear from Northampton County after the 1820 Census. Database searches have not turned up any evidence of their next home, but it seems likely that they moved westward with the expending frontier.\n\n(1) “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church, Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa. Vol. I,” page 23. (2) “Some of the First Settlers of The Forks of the Delaware and Their Descendants,” page 358. George and Elizabeth Hohenschild appear among the baptismal sponsors at Plainfield Reformed Church. It’s possible they are Susannah’s parents. The listing is on page 50. (3) Births listed in Plainfield church records.\n\nJOHN and VERONICA BAUER\n\n(Diel, John)\n\nJohn Bauer was born Jan. 30, 1784 in Northampton County, Pa., to John and Catharine (Heller) Bauer. (1)\n\nMarried Veronica Hahn on April 7, 1805. She was born Oct. 10, 1785. (2)\n\nChildren: (3)\n\nPeter, born Oct. 16, 1805, and died Sept. 16, 1828.\n\nRebecca, born Oct. 19, 1807.\n\nJohn, born Aug. 24, 1810.\n\nCatharine, born Sept. 26, 1812.\n\nThomas, born Jan. 18, 1815.\n\nElizabeth, born Nov. 7 (or 1), 1817, and died Sept. 7, 1821.\n\nWilliam Henry, born March 29, 1828.\n\nThe Bauer family lived in Plainfield Township. It’s possible that John was a blacksmith. The 1820 Census indicates that one person in his household was “engaged in manufactures” and the 1850 Census indicates that, while John had no occupation, his three sons were all working as blacksmiths. It’s very likely they learned the trade from their father.\n\nIn the 1810 Census, their household contained two males under 10, one male 16-25, one female under 10 and one female 16-25.\n\nThe 1820 Census shows the household contained two males under 10, one male 10-15, one male 26-44, two females under 10, one female 10-15, one female 26-44. One person was engaged in agriculture and one was engaged in manufacture.\n\nIn 1830, the household contained one male under 5, one male 15-19, one male 40-49, one female 15-19 and one females 40-49.\n\nIn 1840, the household contained one male 5-9, one male 10-14, two males 20-29, one male 50-59, one female 15-19 and one female 50-59. The numbers and ages of the children don’t match up well with the children listed in church records. It’s possible that these represent additional children who died young. One person was engaged in agriculture.\n\nJohn retired by 1850, when the census lists him as a 64-year-old with no occupation. His real estate was valued at $2,000. The household also contained his wife, Fanny, age 62; John, 36; Thomas 30; William H., 21; and Catharine, 33. Emilius Hawn is listed as a 16-year-old laborer.\n\nIn 1860, the household contained John, listed as a 76-year-old farmer; Frana, 74; Thomas, a 43-year-old coach maker; and Catharine, 45. It also contained William’s family: William H., a 31-year-old blacksmith; Mary E., his 25-year-old wife; Catherine, 6; Samuel, 4; and Sarah J., 2.\n\nThe Bauers probably attended Plainfield Reformed Church, where their children were baptized.\n\nVeronica died Oct. 2, 1868. (4)\n\nJohn died May 11, 1870 of “dropsy.” John is listed in death records as being a “gentleman,” which usually indicates the person is a retired, well-respected farmer. (5)\n\nBoth are buried in Plainfield Cemetery across the road from St. Peter’s Lutheran Church in Plainfield Township.\n\n(1) “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church, Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa. Vol. I,” page 21. (2) Wedding date comes from “Some of the First Settlers of The Forks of the Delaware and Their Descendants,” page 354.

(1)\n\nMarried Catharine Michael on Aug. 19, 1810.

(4) It’s uncertain whether Catharine remarried or moved out of the area after Daniels’ death. However, none of the Bauer/Bower families in the area seems to be Catharine’s.\n\n(1) “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church, Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa. Vol. I,” page 33.

(1)\n\nProbably married twice. (See below.)\n\nChildren: (2)\n\nMary Ann, born Feb. 4, 1830. Married William Walp.\n\nJacob D., born Jan. 12, 1834.\n\nMargaret Ann, born July 17, 1838. Married George Thomas.\n\nJohn, born Nov. 11, 1842.\n\nElsa, born March 30, 1844, probably died before 1850.\n\nThomas J., born in 1849.\n\nThomas was born in Plainfield Township but his family moved to Forks Township while he was young.\n\nIn the last 1820s, Thomas appears to have gotten married for the first time. The 1830 Census lists Thomas Bowers as the head of a household in Forks Township. The household consisted of one male age 20-29, one female under 5, one female 10-14 and one female 20-29. This would represent Thomas, his wife and their daughter, Mary Ann, who had been born earlier that year. The older girl – age 10 to 14 – would have been too old to have been the 24-year-old Thomas’ daughter. She was probably a sister of either Thomas or his wife.\n\nThe full name of this first wife is unknown. No marriage or birth records have turned up and Mary Ann died before Pennsylvania death records listed the names of the deceased’s parents. The books “Historical and Biographic Annals of Columbia and Montour Counties, Pennsylvania” and “Pioneers Families of Berwick, Pa.,” say that Mary Ann was the daughter of Thomas and a woman whose first name was unknown but whose last name was Switzer. If this is accurate, a likely candidate for her father would be Conrad Schweitzer, who is listed relatively close to Thomas in Forks Township in the 1830 Census. Presumably, Thomas’ first wife died sometime between 1830 and 1833.\n\nThomas married Anna Ernst on Feb. 2, 1834, which was about a month after Jacob’s birth. (3) At that time, he probably still lived in Forks Township since the wedding was recorded in the church book of St. John’s Evangelical Lutheran Congregation of Easton, Pa.\n\nThomas’ second wife, Anna, was born Nov. 9, 1809, according to her tombstone. (4) Her parents are unknown and no likely candidates appear in the Forks Township census records. She is frequently listed as Nancy in records.\n\nAt some point before 1840, the family moved northwest to Luzerne County, where the family of Thomas’ mother had migrated in the early 1800s. This began a series of moves within western Luzerne County and eastern Columbia County.\n\nBefore the first move, the family’s last surname was usually spelled “Bauer” with a few uses of “Bower” in civil records. Afterward, it was usually “Bower.” This probably happened because there were fewer Germans in northeastern Pennsylvania and those who kept records were unfamiliar with German spellings.\n\nThe 1840 Census lists Thos Bower in Salem Township, Luzerne County, where his household consisted of one male age 5-9, one male 30-39, one female under 5, one female 10-14 and one female 30-39. One person was employed in agriculture.\n\nWhile the family lived in Salem Township and neighboring areas, they worshiped at Salem Church, a union church serving both Lutheran and Reformed congregations. From May 1841 to March 1854, Thomas and his family are listed as taking communion there. In addition, John and Elsa were baptized in that church. German was the language used in services and early records. (5) The Bowers are also listed as Lutheran communicants at a similar union church in Nescopeck Township, Luzerne County, from Nov. 23, 1862 to November 1884. (6)\n\nIn the 1850 Census, Thomas Bower is listed as a farmer in Centre Township, Columbia County. This household also consisted of Nancy, age 40; Mary A., 20; Jacob D., 15; Margaret A. 12; John, 8; and Thomas, 1.\n\nThe Bowers’ second son, John, was mentally disabled. Although early census records don’t give any indication that John was disabled, the 1880 Census lists him as “idiotic” and unable to read or write. The Schedule for Defective, Dependent and Delinquent Classes notes that John’s “idiocy” began at birth and he was not self-supporting. It states that his head was “small” and that he had never been in a training school.\n\nIn 1860, the family lived in Hollenback Township, Luzerne County. The 1860 Census indicates that Thomas Bower was a farmer who owned real estate valued at $3,000 and personal property valued at $900. The household also consisted of Nancy, age 40; John, an 18-year-old farm laborer; and Thomas, 10. Notes indicate that the younger Thomas was attended school and that Nancy could not read or write. In addition to Thomas’ household, his son Jacob appears to have lived on the property at that time because Jacob’s household is listed beside Thomas’ but Jacob is not listed as owning any real estate.\n\nInterestingly, the census also seems to indicate that the household included the family of Jacob Radler (actually Readler). The family consisted of Jacob, his wife Lydia and their seven children. Among the children was Mary Jane, who would marry the younger Thomas a decade later. It uncertain whether the Readlers actually lived in the same household or the census contains an error.\n\nBy 1870, Jacob had moved away but the Bower home was still a busy place. That year’s census lists Thomas Baur as a 63-year-old farmer in Hollenback Township, where he owned real estate valued at $6,000 and personal property valued at $740. Nancy was 61 and keeping house and John was listed as a 26-year-old farmhand. Young Thomas had married in that year and his wife had moved into the household. Thomas is listed as a 21-year-old farmhand and Mary is listed as a 24-year-old domestic servant. In addition, the census lists John Thomas, age 5. John was the son of the Bowers’ daughter Margaret, who was married to George Thomas and lived in Salem Township.\n\nIn 1873, Thomas bought land in nearby Nescopeck Township. “Atlas of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania 1873” shows T. Baur’s farm in the southwest corner of Hollenback Township, near the border of Nescopeck Township. The Bower farms generally covered about 150 acres, according to Luzerne County deed books. (7)\n\nThe 1880 Census lists Thomas Bower as a 73-year-old “gentleman,” a term used for respected retired farmers. His household in Nescopeck Township contained Nancy, age 71, and a 15-year-old listed as “George Thomas.” However, it’s most likely that the boy was actually the same John Thomas who lived in the household in 1870. George Thomas – who was John’s brother and was actually only 12 years old – appears with his parents in Salem Township in the 1880 Census. The Bowers’ son John is listed in the household of his brother younger Thomas, who also lived in Nescopeck.\n\nIn 1882, there seems to have been some family turmoil. Thomas Jr. seems to have defaulted on a loan either from his father or guaranteed by his father. As a result, the father sued the son to recover the money.\n\nIn April 1876, Thomas Jr. bought about 4 acres of land in Nescopeck Township for $1,700. Six years later, Luzerne County records show the land being forfeited in a sheriff’s sale. On March 15, 1882, the court of common pleas commanded “that the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of T.J. Bower” be sold to recover “a certain debt of seventeen hundred dollars which Thomas Bower lately in the said court recovered against him as four & 25-100 dollars which to the said Thomas Bower were adjudged for his damages which he sustained by occasion of the detention of that debt ...” The land was sold for only $40, covering little of the $1,700. (8)\n\nThat November, Thomas drew up his will, which mentions the court decision and the debt. It reads: “As to my son Thomas J. Bower, I hold a judgment in the Common Pleas of Luzerne County of the amount of about seventeen hundred dollars, which judgment is unsatisfied. I consider the same to be his portion and an advancement out of my estate and that no proceeding may be had toward the collection of the same.”\n\nA little more than two years later, Thomas moved to Ridgely, Md., where his son Jacob had lived since the late 1860s. The communion listings of the Nescopeck church note that he moved there between Nov. 2, 1884, and May 17, 1885.\n\nNancy died Feb. 9, 1887. (9)\n\nThomas Bower died Dec. 6, 1890 in Ridgely. His death notice appeared in the Denton Journal under news from Ridgely: “Mr. Thomas Bowers died at the residence of his son, Mr. Jacob D. Bowers, on Saturday last, aged 84 years. Interment took place on Monday at the cemetery of the Reformed Church.” (10)\n\nThomas’ will was filed in Luzerne County. (11) In addition to addressing the younger Thomas’ situation, the will provides for the care of John. It reads: “It is my desire that my executor look after the interest of my son John and after the decease of his mother, if he should survive her, act as a trustee for him and if they think necessary apply to the court for the appointment of a committee or trustee for him.” The 1900 Census records that John lived with Jacob in Ridgely. John died there in 1902. (12)\n\nIn a codicil that was written Aug. 8, 1882, Thomas left $200 to John Thomas, the grandson listed as living with him in 1870 and 1880. The codicil also mentions: “I further give & bequeath to my son Jacob D. Bower my sausage grinder & stuffer and a lot of grain sacks and also a lot of meat I brought to him.”\n\n(1) Date of birth comes from “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church, Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa.

(1)\n\nMarried Susannah Hay on May 22, 1825. Susannah has born Dec. 25, 1800.

Married Samuel Lynn.\n\nSusan, born about 1835.\n\nJacob,\n\nThomas, born Aug. 1, 1843.\n\nTobias, born about 1838.\n\nMargaret.\n\nJacob was a farmer in Northampton County.\n\nThe 1850 Census lists Jacob as a 47-year-old farmer living in Forks Township. The household included his wife and children: Susan, age 49; William, 24; Eliza, 21; Susan, 15; Tobias, 12; Jacob, 10; and Thomas, 7. His mother, Anna, age 66, also lived in the home. The household also included laborer named Jacob Miller, 27.\n\nJacob died Feb. 4, 1854. (4)\n\nIn 1860, the census indicates that Susanna Bower, age 62, was living with her son William in Palmer Township. The household also contained her son Tobias, age 22.\n\nJacob, Thomas and Tobias fought in the Union Army during the Civil War. Thomas and Tobias died of wounds suffered in combat. Jacob survived the war.\n\nThe 1870 Census also lists Susannah Bower, age 69, as keeping house in the home of her son William, age 44, Palmer Township. The census also indicates that she owned personal property valued at $200.\n\nIn 1880, Susanna Bauer, age 79, is listed as the mother of William Bauer, age 53, the head of a household in Palmer Township. The census notes that she could not write.\n\nSusanna died April 20, 1881. (5)\n\nThe Bauers are buried at Arndts and Messinger Cemetery in Forks Township.\n\n(1) “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church, Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa.

(1)\n\nMarried Elizabeth Weber on Oct. 12, 1828. She lived in Lower Mount Bethel Township at the time of the marriage. (2)\n\nChildren: (3)\n\nJosiah Heller, born April 9, 1829. (4)\n\nSusan, born Dec. 2, 1830.\n\nWilliam Jacob, born Sept. 23, 1832.\n\nAnna Sabina, born May 2, 1836. Married Perry B. Sax.\n\nLouisa, born March 21, 1838. Married Enos Young.\n\nAbraham, born April 28, 1840.\n\nEmma, born about 1846.\n\nFranklin, born July 27, 1849.\n\nIn 1830 Charles Bower appears in Plainfield Township, Northampton County. His household contained one male under age 5, one male 20-29, one female 5-9 and one female 20-29.\n\nIn 1840, the census indicates the household of Charles Bower in Plainfield Township contained one male under 5, one male 5-9, one male 10-14, one male 30-39, two females under 5, two females 5-9 and one female 20-29.\n\nIn the 1850 Census, Charles is listed as a 42-year-old carpenter in Plainfield Township. The household also contained Elizabeth, age 44; Joseph (actually Josiah), a 21-year-old carpenter; Abraham, 10; Sabine, 14; Emma, 4; and Franklin, 1. Charles owned real estate valued at $300.\n\nUp to this point, the Bauers probably attended Plainfield Reformed Church, where their children were baptized.\n\nDuring the 1850s, the family moved to neighboring Monroe County. In 1860, the census indicates Charles was a 52-year-old farmer in Tobyhanna, Monroe County. The household also included Elizabeth, age 55; Emma E., 13; and Franklin, 10. It also included William Stubs a 21-year-old farm laborer. Charles owned real estate valued at $1,200 and personal property valued at $300.\n\nDuring the 1860s, Charles and Elizabeth followed some of their children westward to Ohio. In 1870, the census, lists Charles as a 61-year-old house carpenter in Liberty Township, Crawford County. He owned personal property valued at $150. Elizabeth is listed as 64 and keeping house. It appears that they were living on property owned by their son William, who is listed as a 37-year-old house painter. The Charles and Elizabeth are listed as a different family but in the same house as William.\n\nThe couple again moved westward during the 1870s. In the 1880 Census, Charles and Elizabeth Bower are listed as the father-in-law and mother-in-law of Enos Young, head of a household in Eldorado Township, Benton County, Iowa. Charles was listed as 71 and Elizabeth as 73. Both are listed as “at home,” which indicates neither had no occupation. It also notes that Elizabeth could not write.\n\n(1) “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church, Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa. Vol. I,” page 62. (2) “Marriages and Deaths, Northampton County, 1799¸1851, Newspaper Extracts, Vol. I,” page 273. (3) Children’s birth listed in “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church, Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa.,” volumes I and II. Emma is listed in the 1850 Census of Plainfield Township. (4) There seems to be a lot of inconsistency with Josiah’s name in the records. The transcription of birth and baptism record lists him as “Isaiah” and the 1850 Census lists him as “Joseph.” However, most later records say “Josiah.” It seems that the Josiah-Isaiah switch is a simple transcription error because the names look similar in cursive script. The appearance of Joseph can probably be blamed on a census taker’s sloppiness, which was pretty common.\n\nJOHN JACOB and FLORENTINA BAUER\n\n(Diel, Dietrich, Abraham)\n\nJohn Jacob Bauer was born Feb. 1, 1812, in Northampton County, Pa., to Abraham and Catharine (Keller) Bauer. (1)\n\nMarried Florentina Bender on Sept. 9, 1832. She was born about 1813. (2)\n\nMarried a second time to Sabina, who was born Feb. 4, 1814. (3)\n\nChildren: (4)\n\nJoseph Lewin, born .\n\nConrad, born May 2, 1835.\n\nSabina, born March 28, 1836.\n\nEphraim, born July 27, 1839.\n\nJoel, born Sept. 2, 1841.\n\nAmos, born Feb. 15, 1844.\n\nAaron Henry, born Feb. 13, 1846.\n\nMatilda Susanna, born Feb. 26, 1848.\n\nThomas, born Aug. 17, 1850.\n\nGeorge Peter, born April 19, 1853.\n\nLewis, born March 11, 1858, and was killed in an accident in May 1870.\n\nEmma Elizabeth, Jan. 17, 1860.\n\nIn the 1850 Census, Jacob Bower is listed as a farmer living in Plainfield Township, Northampton County. He owned real estate valued at $4,500. Most of his family members are listed by their first initials, but it’s easy to figure out who’s who. They were: F(lorentina), age 37; J(osiah), a 17-year-old laborer; C(onrad), 15; S(abina), 13; E(phraim), 12; Joel, 10; Enos, 8; A(aron) H(enry), 5; and Matilda, 2. In addition, Florentina’s father, Conrad Bender, age 83, is included in the household.\n\nIn 1860, the census again lists Jacob Bower as a farmer in Plainfield Township. This household included Florentine, age 47; Ephraim, a 21-year-old house painter; Joel, a 19-year-old farm laborer; Aaron, a 17-year-old farm laborer; Thomas, 11; Matilda, 10; George P., 8; Lewis, 3; and Emma E., 9 months. The notation on the value of Jacob’s property is difficult to read, but it appears to say that his real estate was worth $14,800 and his personal property was worth $1,275.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Jacob’s sons Conrad and Joel fought for the Union Army. Conrad’s unit, the 153rd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment saw action at the battle of Chancellorsville and Gettysburg. Joel’s unit, the 129th Pennsylvania Infantry, fought at the Battle of Fredericksburg.\n\nIn 1864-65, Jacob served as a Northampton County commissioner. (5)\n\nFlorentina appears to have died before the 1870 Census was taken. Jacob’s wife is listed as Sabina. Sabina was the widow of Jacob Bender, and had three children from the previous marriage: James F. Bender, Mrs. Reuben Ackerman and Mrs. Peter S. Miller. (6)\n\nBy the time the 1870 Census was taken, most of the children had moved away. The household in Plainfield Township included Jacob Bower, a 58-year-old farmer; Subina, age 56; George, a 17-year-old farm laborer; and Matilda, 10. It notes that Sabina could not read or write.\n\nIn the 1880 Census, Jacob Bauer is listed as a 68-year-old farmer in Plainfield Township. His household also included his wife Sabina, age 66; daughter Emma E., age 19; and a servant named Jacob Snyder, 18.\n\nThe Bauers probably attended Plainfield Reformed Church, where their children were baptized.\n\nSabina died Jan. 12, 1891, and is buried at St. Peter’s Lutheran Church in Plainfield Township.\n\nJacob died Dec. 5, 1895, in South Easton.

(1)\n\nMarried Maria Russell on Dec. 10, 1839. Maria was the daughter of George Russell. (2)\n\nChildren: (3)\n\nAnna Maria, born Aug. 24, 1840.\n\nSamuel Jacob, born March 18, 1844.\n\nSamuel Bower is listed in Plainfield Township in the 1840 Census. His household contained one male age 5-9, one male 20-29 and one female under 20. Since the Bauers had been married for less than a year when the census was taken, it’s most likely that the boy listed here was either a brother of Samuel or Maria’s or a child from a previous marriage.\n\nThe Bauers probably attended Plainfield Reformed Church, were their children were baptized.\n\nSamuel died April 20, 1844, and is buried in Plainfield Cemetery near St. Peter’s\n\nLutheran Church. (4)\n\nHis son Samuel, age 6, is listed as living with Maria’s parents, George and Elizabeth Russell, in the 1850 Census of Plainfield Township.\n\n(1) “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church, Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa. Vol. I,” page 81. (2) “Some of the First Settlers of The Forks of the Delaware and Their Descendants,” page 390. Samuel’s will names George Russell as his father-in-law.

(1)\n\nMarried Sarah Keller on Sept. 26, 1840. Sarah was born about 1819. (2)\n\nChildren: (3)\n\nMelinda, born April 21, 1841. Married L.S. Burroughs.\n\nEmma Elisabeth, born Oct. 8, 1842.\n\nUriah, born Jan. 27, 1844.\n\nJohn Henry, born March 31, 1846.\n\nTillman, born Dec. 28, 1847.\n\nJacob, born May 17, 1850.\n\nCatharine Susanna, Feb. 6, 1852.\n\nDavid Daniel, born March 30, 1854. Probably died young.\n\nReuben Thomas, Sept. 8, 1855.\n\nAlice, born about 1857.\n\nAnna, born about 1859\n\nMary Ella, born about 1863.\n\nThe Bowers probably worshiped at Plainfield Reformed Church, where they had their children baptized and Abraham’s father was very active.\n\nIn the 1850 Census, Abraham Bower is listed as a farmer in Plainfield Township. His household included Sarah, age 31; Milenda, 9; Emma, 7; Uriah, 6; John, 5; Tillman, 2; and Jacob, 4 months. In addition, Samuel Cambelin, age 14, lived in the home.\n\nThe Bowers probably moved from Pennsylvania to Ohio around 1856. In 1855, Reuben was the last child to be baptized at Plainfield Reformed Church and Alice was born in Ohio about 1857.\n\nIn the 1860 Census, the family appears in Liberty Township, Crawford County, Ohio. Abraham is listed as a 42-year-old farmer who owned real estate valued at $5,000 and personal property worth $500. His household included Sarah, age 41; Malinda, 19; Emma, 17; Uriah, a 16-year-old farm laborer; John, 14; Jacob, 10; Catherine, 8; Reuben, 5; Alice 3; and Anna, 10 months. Since David isn’t listed in this census, it’s likely that he had died before 1860.\n\nIn 1870, the census indicates that Abraham Bower was a 52-year-old farmer in Liberty Township. He owned personal property worth $818, but no real estate is indicated. His household included Sarah, 51; Catharine, 18; Reuben T., 14, working on the farm; Alice, 12; Anna, 10; and Mary E., 7.\n\nA land map from 1873 shows the Bower farm on the outskirts of Annapolis, which was a village within Liberty Township. (4)\n\nThe 1880 Census finds the family on Paris Street in Annapolis. Abraham Bower is listed as a 61-year-old farmer. Sarah was 61 and Ella (Mary E. in the previous census) was 17. The household also contained Sarah’s mother, Elizabeth Keller, age 85, and her sister, Rebecca, age 57. Rebecca is listed as “idiotic.”\n\nThe 1880 agricultural schedule of the census shows that Abraham owned a farm that contained 27 acres of tilled land and 15 acres of woodland. Its land, fences and buildings were worth $2,940, the implements and machinery were worth $20 and his livestock was worth $100. His farm production was valued at $255. In 1879, he planted 6 acres that were mown, and harvested 5 tons of hay. He owned a horse and two milk cows, which dropped two calves. One head was sold and one died or strayed. The cattle produced 100 pounds of butter in 1879. He also owned 35 barnyard poultry, which produced 50 dozen eggs. He planted 5 acres in Indian corn and harvested 200 bushels, 6 acres in oats and harvested 250 bushels, 5 acres in wheat and harvested 80 bushels, 1 acre in Irish potatoes and harvested 80 bushels. He also cut 20 cords of wood.\n\nSarah died on Oct. 29, 1888. Abraham died on Jan. 5, 1900. (5)\n\nThe Bowers are buried at Union Cemetery in Sulphur Springs, Crawford County.\n\n(1) “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church in Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa. Vol. I,” page 92. (2) “Some of the First Settlers of The Forks of the Delaware and Their Descendants,” page 391. Year of birth comes from 1850 Census of Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa. (3) Most of the children are listed in “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church,” volumes I and II. Alice, Anna and Ella are listed in the 1870 Census. That census lists the youngest daughter as Mary E. and the 1880 Census lists her as Ella.

(1)\n\nMarried a woman named Sarah A. She was born about 1836 in Pennsylvania. (2)\n\nChildren: (3)\n\nOliver, born about 1853.\n\nRachael E., born about 1856. Probably married L.W. Snyder.\n\nStella, born about 1859. Married James L. Martin.\n\nMatilda, born about 1862.\n\nWilliam, born about 1864.\n\nReuben grew up in Plainfield Township, Northampton County.\n\nIn 1850, Reuben Bower is listed as a 20-year-old carpenter in the household of Stephen Hasen in Plainfield Township.\n\nReuben and Sarah probably got married about 1852 since their first child was born about 1853. According to the 1870 Census, the couple’s first three children were born in Pennsylvania, which would indicate that they were married in Pennsylvania and lived there until about 1859. That’s probably the year that they moved to Liberty Township, Crawford County, Ohio.\n\nThe 1860 Census lists Reuben Bower as a painter in the village of Annapolis in Liberty Township. He owned real estate valued at $200 and personal property valued at $50. His family is listed as Sarah, age 24; Oliver, 7; Rachael, 4; and Matilda, 10 months. The household also contained Elizabeth Williams, an 18-year-old “domestic,” and William Heler, a 22-year-old painter. Since William was born in Pennsylvania, it’s possible he was a cousin from the Heller family.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Reuben served as a private in Company C of the 49th Ohio Infantry Regiment. (4) He enlisted on Feb. 17, 1864, in Sulphur Springs, which was near his home in Annapolis.\n\nReuben was discharged on Dec. 17, 1864, in Cleveland because of a wound. Records from the National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers indicate he had suffered a “GSW arm” – gunshot wound to the arm – on May 27, 1864, at Pumpkinvine Creek Ga. This engagement was part of Battle of Dallas, which occurred during Gen. William T. Sherman’s Atlanta campaign. The battle was fought from May 26 to June 1 and resulted in 2,400 Union and 3,000 Confederate casualties. Reuben was wounded before the main engagement, which occurred on May 28 when Confederate troops unsuccessfully assaulted the Union line. (5)\n\nIn 1870, Reuben T. Bower is listed as a 39-year-old house painter in Liberty Township. Interestingly, “R.T. Bowers” is listed as the census taker on the form. As a result, the information in this census should be very reliable. His family included his wife Sarah, age 33; Rachael E., 12; Matilda, 10; Stella, 8; and William 6. It’s possible that Oliver was working on another farm in Crawford County. An Oliver Bower who was 16 and had been born in Pennsylvania is listed as a farm laborer in the household of Benjamin Stevens in Sandusky Township.\n\nAt some point during the 1870s, Reuben and Sarah moved to nearby Hardin County. In the 1880 Census, Rubin T. Bower is listed as a 50-year-old painter in Blanchard Township in that county. Sarah A. is listed as 44 years old and it’s noted that she’s “Maimed, Crippled, Bedridden, or otherwise disabled.” In addition, Etta Martin, age 22, is listed as the Bowers’ daughter. This is Stella, who had married James Martin by this point. She may have been caring for her disabled mother, which would explain her presence in the household after her marriage. (6)\n\nSarah died sometime before 1885.\n\nOn April 25, 1885, Reuben was admitted to the home for disabled veterans in Dayton, Ohio. The home’s records provide quite a bit of information about Reuben. At the time of his admission, he was 54 years old; was 5 feet, 10 inches tall; and had a fair complexion with blue eye and gray hair. He was a painter who lived in Dunkirk, Ohio (a village in Blanchard Township). He was widowed. His nearest relative was his son-in-law L.W. Snyder of Tiffin, Ohio. This seems to be the husband of Rachel because Stella had married James Martin and Matilda was still single.\n\nReuben died April 6, 1894, of apoplexy “Suddenly in Barrack.” His money and effects were sent to his daughter Tillie Bower of “Sulpher Grove, Ohio,” probably Sulphur Springs.\n\nIt’s uncertain where Reuben is buried. On the veterans home records, there’s a notation in a different hand that states: “No headstone found & no record in the filing envelope to show that remains were removed.”\n\n(1) “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church, Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa. Vol. I,” page 130. (2) Sarah is listed as Reuben’s wife in the 1860 Census of Liberty Township, Crawford County, Ohio. (3) The children are listed in the 1860 and 1870 censuses of Liberty Township. (4) Ancestry.com, “U.S. National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, 1866-1938.” (5) The Battle of Dallas is described at the National Park Service’s website at www.cr.nps.gov. (6) The 1900 Census of the 7th Ward of Toledo reveals more information on Stella. In that record, she is listed as Ella Martin, wife of James. She and James had been married 21 years at that point and Ella had given birth 3 times but none of the children had survived. Their household also contained Ella’s sister Tilly Bowers, who had never been married or given birth.\n\nJOHN BAUER\n\n(Diel, John, John)\n\nJohn Bauer was born Aug. 24, 1810, in Northampton County, Pa., to John and Veronica (Hahn) Bauer. (1)\n\nJohn does not appear to have married or had children.\n\nJohn Bauer is listed as living with his parents in the 1850 Censuses of Plainfield Township, Northampton County. He was a blacksmith, as were his brothers Thomas and William, who also lived in the household.\n\nThe 1870 Census lists John as living with his brother Thomas and sister Catharine. He is listed as a 59-year-old a “gentleman,” probably indicating he was retired.\n\nJohn died Feb. 15, 1879. He is buried in Plainfield Cemetery near St. Peter’s Lutheran Church in Plainfield Township. (2)\n\n(1) “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church, Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa.

(1)\n\nThomas does not appear to have married or had children.\n\nHe is listed as living with his parents in the 1850 and 1860 censuses of Plainfield Township, Northampton County. In 1850, he was a blacksmith, as were his brothers John and William, who also lived in the household. In 1860, he was a coachmaker.\n\nThe 1870 Census lists him as living with his brother John and sister Catharine. He is listed as a carriage maker. He still lived next to his younger brother William and his family. It seems likely that they were living on different parcels of their parents’ property.\n\nIn 1880, Thomas Bauer is listed as a 60-year-old carriage maker. His household contained his 63-year-old sister Catharine. He still lived next to his younger brother William and his family.\n\nThomas died Oct. 10, 1884. He is buried in Plainfield Cemetery near St. Peter’s Lutheran Church in Plainfield Township. (2)\n\n(1) “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church, Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa.

Married Frank Eyers.\n\nWilliam grew up in Plainfield Township. In the 1850 Census of Plainfield Township, William Bauer is listed as living with his parents. He was a blacksmith, as were his brothers John and Thomas, who also lived in the household. It seems likely that his father was a blacksmith who trained his sons.\n\nIn 1860, William was still listed as living with his parents in Plainfield Township, but he was married and had two children. He was a 31-year-old blacksmith who owned personal property valued at $200. His family included Mary E., age 25; Samuel, 4; and Sarah J., 2.\n\nIn 1870, William Bower is listed as a 42-year-old carriage maker in Plainfield Township. His household contained Mary, age 35; Sarah, 12; John, 7; and Simon, 4. He was living next to the home of his siblings Thomas, John and Catharine. It seems likely that they were living on different parcels of their parents’ property and all of them were involved in some aspect of the carriage business.\n\nIn the 1880 Census, William Bauer is listed as a 60-year-old carriage maker in Plainfield Township. His household contained Mary E., age 46; John T., 16; Simon P., 13; and Martha S., 5. John and Simon are listed as laborers but also as attending school. William’s siblings Thomas and Catharine still lived next door and Thomas was still a carriage maker.\n\nDuring this time, the Bowers probably attended Plainfield Reformed Church, where their children were baptized.\n\nAt some point during the early 1880s, the family seems to have moved south to the town of Easton. In 1885, a William H. Bowers is listed as a carriage maker on South Sixth Street in Easton. (4)\n\nIt’s uncertain where William and Mary lived after that. In the 1900 Census, a William and Mary Bower are listed in Plainfield Township. However, the information doesn’t quite match up, even by census standards. The record indicates that William Bower, who was born May 1831, and Mary, who was born April 1834, were living in the household of Peter Miller and his wife Louisa. They had been married 45 years. William was a boarder in the home and worked as a farm laborer. Mary was a servant who had given birth to five children, four of whom were still alive.\n\nWilliam died Oct. 30, 1900. Mary died Feb. 9, 1903. Both are buried in Plainfield Cemetery near St. Peter’s Lutheran Church in Plainfield Township.\n\n(1) “Church Record of the Plainfield Reformed Church, Plainfield Township, Northampton County, Pa.

Married George Kostenbader.\n\nDaniel grew up in Plainfield Township and settled in nearby Bushkill Township after he married.\n\nIn the 1850, Daniel Bower is listed as a 33-year-old laborer in Bushkill Township. He owned real estate valued at $1,000. The members of his family are listed as Sobina, age 30; Joseph H., 8; Louesa, 5; Maretta, 3; Sobina, 2; and Harman, 1. Also living his house was his brother Charles D. Bauer, a 25-year-old shoemaker. Interestingly, it appears that Charles’ surname was originally spelled “Bower” on the census form but was written over to spell it “Bauer.”\n\nThe 1860 Census lists Daniel Bauer as a 44-year-old master shoemaker in Bushkill Township. He owned real estate valued at $2,200 and personal property valued at $295. His family is listed as Sabina, age 41; Joseph, 17; Sabina, 13; Edwin, 10; Carolina, 8; Ellevina, 6; Sarah, 4; Gorege (George), 2; and Anna, 6 months.\n\nThe Bushkill township census form that covers the family in 1870 is badly faded so it’s difficult to read Daniels’ listing. Daniel Bower is listed as 55 and his occupation seems to be “Farmer.” His family is listed as Sabina, age 51; Levine (possibly Edward), 20; Caroline, 18; Sarah, 14; Valentine, 11 (George); and Minerva, 7. The household also contained Barbara Michael, 50.\n\nIn 1880, Daniel Bauer is listed as a 64-year-old farmer in Bushkill Township. His family is listed as Sobina, age 61, and George V., a 21-year-old farm laborer. In addition, the household contained Caroline’s children Stella and Charles Walton, ages 9 and 8, respectively. At this point, Caroline was a widow. She is listed as a servant in the household of Peter Rohn in Lower Nazareth Township. Her daughter Catherine, 4, lived with her.\n\nThe family probably worshipped at Plainfield Reformed Church, where their children were baptized.\n\nIn 1885, a Daniel Bower is listed as an invalid living in Bushkill Center. (4)\n\nDaniel died Dec. 8, 1891, and Sabina died Nov. 4, 1884. They are buried at Plainfield Cemetery near St. Peter’s Lutheran Church in Plainfield Township.

I and II. George and Sarah Jane’s birth dates are listed in their Pennsylvania death certificates. In most cases, the husbands of the daughters were found by comparing death, burial and census records.

His household included Sarah, age 44; Mary, 14; Allen, 11; and Calvin, 6.\n\nCharles died May 30, 1899.\n\nAt some point before 1900, Sarah moved to West Bethlehem in Lehigh County. In that year’s census, Sarah A. Bauer is listed as a 65-year-old widow. She rented a house at 201 Vineyard St. in West Bethlehem borough. Her household also contained her daughter Mary E., age 34, and son Calvin D., a 26-year-old ribbon weaver. The census also indicates that Sarah had given birth to five children and all were still alive.\n\nSarah died Feb. 7, 1909 of bilious fever.\n\nCharles and Sarah are buried at Nisky Hill Cemetery in Bethlehem, Northampton County.

Bowers was born Jan. 12, 1834, in Northampton County, Pa., to Thomas and Anna (Ernst) Bower. (1)\n\nMarried Lucy Ann Hawk about 1857. Lucy was born Oct. 12, 1838, in Luzerne County, Pa., to John and Fanny Hawk. (2)\n\nChildren: (3)\n\nJohn Wesley, born in Nov. 11, 1856.\n\nGeorge Washington, born in Feb. 22, 1859.\n\nJacob’s parents moved to Salem Township in Luzerne County, Pa., within a few years of his birth. As Jacob was growing up, his family moved several times within the same general area. They lived in Salem Township in 1840; Centre Township, Columbia County, 1850; and Hollenback Township, Luzerne County in 1860.\n\nIn Luzerne County, the family worshipped at union churches, where Lutheran and Reformed congregations met under the same roof. They probably worshiped at a similar church when they lived in Columbia County, but records have not yet turned up. In 1854, Jacob took communion at Salem Union Church. He communed at a similar union church in Nescopeck in starting in 1862, when the family moved to neighboring Hollenback. (4)\n\nIn 1860, Jacob was a farmer in Hollenback Township, according to that year’s census. He probably lived on his father’s property because his household is listed next to his father’s and he is not listed as owning any real estate. Jacob’s household also included Lucy, age 21; John W., 2; and George W., 1. He owned personal property valued at $100.\n\nFrom 1866 to 1868, Jacob owned 3 acres beside his father’s farm in Hollenback Township, according to Luzerne County land records. (5)\n\nAbout 1868, the family moved to Caroline County, Md. Since they do not appear to have had any connection to eastern Maryland, it seems unusual that they would move south rather than west if they were looking to migrate. However, it seems that cheap land was available in Caroline County at the time. A group of men had decided to plant a city where the Maryland and Delaware Railroad ran by the Choptank River. They named the town Ridgely, after a local pastor who was helping them with their plans. They drew up a street map and started building in the summer of 1867, but they couldn’t attract enough interest to keep up with the bills and the project died within a few months. Soon afterward, a real estate firm set its sights on Ridgely and “for the first decade the most apparent growth lay outside the boundaries of the village. New settlers bought farms in the surrounding country where land was plentiful and cheap.” Jacob’s family was among the settlers mentioned. (6)\n\nThe 1870 Census shows Jacob Bowers living in Caroline County’s Second Election District, which was covered by the Greensborough post office. Jacob is listed as a 39-year-old farmer who owned $2,000 in real estate and $200 in personal property. It mistakenly says that he and his entire family were born in Maryland. The household also included Lucy, age 30; Wesley, 11; and George, 9.\n\nEarly records usually list the family’s surname as Bower, and occasionally Bauer. However, the name is almost always spelled Bowers after the move to Maryland. This is probably because other Caroline County families spelled the name with the “s” and the newcomers adopted the spelling over the years.\n\nThe 1880 Census lists Jacob D. Bowers as a farmer in Caroline County’s Second District. It says Lucy A. was 43 years old and keeping house and John W. was 22 and working on the farm. The household also contained George W. – age 21 and working on the farm – and his wife Permilla, 21.\n\nJacob and Lucy sold off several tracks of land during the 1880s and 1890s. In 1885, they sold 61 acres to Susan A. Green for $270, according to the Dec. 5 edition of the Denton Journal.\n\nIn 1890, the Bowers sold their farm and moved to nearby town of Ridgely. The transaction is mentioned in the July 26 edition of the Denton Journal, which states: “Mr. W.W. Seward has bought the Jacob D. Bower farm, near Ridgely. Mr. Seward intends to remove to his new home and Mr. Bower will reside at Ridgely.” The May 31 edition of the newspaper had noted that the property covered 93 acres and sold for $5,000.\n\nIn October 1891, they sold 62 acres to Sallie E. Camper for $2,400, according to the Oct. 31 edition of the Denton Journal. The Jan. 7, 1893, edition records the sale of a property in Ridgely to Harvey J. Baker for $100. The Feb. 4, 189, edition records Jacob’s purchase of property in Ridgely from Franklin P. Herr for $212.\n\nIn addition, Jacob and Lucy appear to have been involved in some dispute that resulted in their owing $1,750. The April 7, 1894, edition of the Denton Journal contains a legal notice headlined “Richard T. Carter, Assignee, vs. Jacob D. Bower and Lucy A. Bower.” The Caroline County circuit court ordered that “the sale made and reported by Richard T. Carter, assignee, in the above entitled cause, be ratified and confirmed unless cause to the contrary thereof be shown. … The report of sale sates the amount of sales to be seventeen hundred and fifty dollars.”\n\nThe 1900 Census lists Jacob D. Bower as a 66-year-old miller living in Ridgely. He owned a house that was mortgaged. His household contained wife Lucy, age 62, and his brother, John, who is listed as age 54. John moved in with Jacob after their father died. John suffered from some sort of mental disability, which caused him to be listed as “idiotic” in the 1880 Census. The 1900 Census says he could not read, write or speak English. This seems to have been a serious decline from previous censuses, which list him as a farm hand. John died in 1902.\n\nThe 1910 Census indicates that Jacob and Lucy had moved in with their son John and his wife, Rosie. John owned the house, which was on Central Avenue in Ridgely. Jacob D. Bowers is listed as 76 years old and having his “own income.” Lucy A. Bowers was 73. John W. was a 52-year-old carpenter. His wife, Rosie B., was 48. The household also contained Beatrice Passwater, a 12-year-old boarder. Beatrice was actually Rosie’s niece, whom John and Rosie adopted several years later. (7)\n\nIn that year, Jacob sold a property in Ridgely to his daughter-in-law Rosa for $1,500, according to the Sept. 3 edition of the Denton Journal.\n\nJacob died Oct. 21, 1910 in Ridgely. His death certificate states he had suffered from “general debility” for about a year and died from “inability to take food.”\n\nAfter Jacob’s death, Lucy continued to live with John in Ridgely. She does not appear to have been healthy during the last years of her life. Notices in the Denton Journal state that she “sustained severe bruises from a fall” in the Jan. 27, 1917, edition; “has been on the sick list” in the Dec. 20, 1919 edition; and “is quite ill” in the March 20, 1920 edition.\n\nThe 1920 Census shows 80-year-old Lucy living with John, who is listed as Wesley Bowers. The census also inaccurately lists Lucy and John’s mother-in-law. John was a widower. Rosie died before June 23, 1917, when her will was exhibited for probate, according to that day’s edition of the Denton Journal.\n\nThe 1920 census was taken on Jan. 23, and Lucy lived only a few more months. She died April 20 in Ridgely. Her death certificate states she had suffered from “senility – chronic nephritis,” the latter – a kidney disease – for five years.\n\nThe Bowes were buried in Ridgely, according to their death certificates, but their graves have not been located.\n\n(1) Information comes from Jacob’s death record at the Maryland State Archives. (2) The 1900 Census of Ridgely, Caroline County, Md., says that Lucy and Jacob had been married 43 years. Lucy’s birth date is listed in her death records in the Maryland State Archives. However, the 1900 Census indicates that Lucy was born in November 1837. Parents identified in 1850 Census of Newport Township in Luzerne County, Pa. (3) Children listed in census records for 1860 Hollenback Township, Luzerne County, Pa., and Ridgely, Caroline County, Md., 1880. “Genealogy of Conrad and Elizabeth (Borger) Hawk,” page 271, says the Bowers were married in August 1856 and John was born Nov 11, 1856. John’s birth date is confirmed in the Nov. 15, 1946, edition of the Denton Journal, which mentions he celebrated his 90th birthday on Nov. 11.

Bower is in Caroline County, Md., Estate No. 1917-217-D.\n\nJOHN BOWER\n\n(Diel, Dietrich, Jacob, Thomas)\n\nJohn Bower was born Nov. 11, 1842, in Luzerne County, Pa., to Thomas and Anna (Ernst) Bower. (1)\n\nJohn was mentally disabled. Although early census records don’t give any indication that John was disabled, the 1880 Census lists him as “idiotic” and unable to read or write. The Schedule for Defective, Dependent and Delinquent Classes notes that John’s “idiocy” began at birth and he was not self-supporting. It states that his head was “"
