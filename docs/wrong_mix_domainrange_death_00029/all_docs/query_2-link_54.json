        "text": "Eugene O'Neill's Sea Island Cottage!\n\nMust SeeTop 10 Florida Condos For Sale\n\nLiterary Nobel Prize winning playwright of 1936, Eugene O’Neill, was lucky to have somewhat accidentally fallen into his field. Ignored by his mother due to her depression and distanced from his actor father who toured continuously, Eugene had the rather adverse freedom to design his life as he wanted it, supported by the bank of dad, as one reviewer noted. Eugene turned to drink with no particular goals or ambitions, always fished out of trouble by his father. He tried acting, which was a failure, and decided to write a novel. Over time, his writing went from prose to plays. In later marriages, two of which ended in divorce, it seemed that he was looking more for a mother who would attend to his every whim, rather than a wife as romantic partner. This is evident in the fascinating diaries written by his third wife, Carlotta Monterey. A stage and film actress, Carlotta gave up her career to cater to O’Neill’s needs for 30 years until his death. Immediately after his death in 1953, she had his autobiographical play Long Day’s Journey Into Night published, which was awarded the 1957 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.\n\nAfter living in the Loire Valley in central France for a year, the O’Neills moved back to the U.S. and bought oceanfront property on Sea Island, Georgia. They had a home built to their own specifications according to the private lifestyle they wished to have. It was the first home they ever owned. In a time before television and Internet, daily activities were quite simple, according to Carlotta’s personal diaries, and their days were filled with reading, writing letters, ocean bathing and hosting a limited number of friends. O’Neill wrote his only comedy while living in Sea Island, Ah, Wilderness!. Now for sale, the seven-bedroom, seven-bath house of 6,967 square feet sits on almost three quarters of an acre. Built in 1931, O’Neill’s office was in the style of a schooner adding ambiance to its oceanfront location. Eugene and Carlotta O’Neill’s Sea Island house is now for sale at $6.45 million, reduced from $7.25 million."
