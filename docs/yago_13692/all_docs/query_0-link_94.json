        "text": "100% Arabica(100% Arabic) In this light-hearted musical comedy with a message, a North African pop group called Rap Oriental uses music to triumph over the bigotry and violence in 100% Arabica, the housing project on the outskirts of Paris that they call home. The band and their devoted fans are pitted against religiously conservative elders who want to stop the music. The film features Khaled and Cheb Mami, two real-life stars of rai music--a combination of North African sounds and western-style rap. The pair offers a message with a beat as they rock, groove, and ultimately soothe their 'hood with their unique sound. 400 Blows, The Francois Truffaut's first feature was this 1959 portrait of Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud), a boy who turns to petty crime in the face of neglect at home and hard times at a reform school. Somewhat autobiographical for its director, the film helped usher in the heady spirit of the French New Wave, and introduced the Doinel character, who became a fixture in Truffaut's movies over the years. Poignant, exhilarating, and fun (there's a parade of cameo appearances from some of the essential icons and directors from the movement), this film is an important classic 8:17 Darling Street A former journalist, three times divorced, Gerard is now a member of Alcoholics Anonymous who lives in a small apartment on Darling Street. By a combination of circumstances, he isn't home when his building explodes one evening, causing the death of six people. Moved by the fact that he has escaped death, Gerard finds his old journalistic instincts returning and decides to research his dead neighbors' past to understand what occured, but also to give meaning to this terrible event. Accompanist Sophie, a masterful pianist is hired by opera singer Irene to be her accompanist onstage during Nazi occupied Paris. Irene's husband, Charles, a businessman, is also introduced, and director Miller takes us through the kind of story an American studio would not even dream of making anymore. Irene is having an affair with Jacques, and she and Sophie and Charles decide to leave France for London. They are attacked by a single German plane on their way, but make it. The climax, involving death and lost love, is chilling. Adolphe The action takes place at the turn of the 19th Century. Adolphe (Stanislas Merhar) is a carefree, somewhat jaded 22-year-old, scion of a preeminent aristocratic family, with a very promising political career ahead of him.

At a soirée given by the Count (Jean Yanne) in his sumptuous castle, Adolphe sets his eyes on the beautiful Ellénore (Isabelle Adjani), a young widow, ten years his elder, mother of two children. She also happens to be the Count's mistress. Adolphe falls in love with Ellénore, for lack of a better thing to do. At first, Ellénore resists Adolphe's feverish advances. He insists, becoming an overwhelming presence (and nuisance) in Ellénore's life. Eventually, she surrenders. Soon after, the novelty of this adventure wearing out, Adolphe tries to liberate himself from his new lover, who has become a burden in his life, an obstacle to his freedom. However, he cannot bring himself to altogether sever his relationship with Ellénore, as the idea of making her suffer is to him unbearable.

Tales from Madagascar Angano...Angano... pioneers a new approach to ethnographic filmmaking, at once scrupulously non-interpretive yet deeply evocative. The central character in Angano...Angano... is the oral tradition itself, passing down the wisdom of the ancestors - the 'ear's inheritance' - through myths and folktales. Venerable storytellers recount for the camera and their listeners the founding myths of Malagasy culture. The filmmakers do not dramatize these tales; rather they document storytelling itself by placing it in its social and geographical context. The tales flow into and out of stunning shots of the daily Malagasy life which gave birth to them and which they in turn explain. Antilles Guadaloupe- Martinique The French Caribbean Island Guadeloupe looks from above like two butterfly wings. Its two islands Grande Terre and Basse Terre are separated only by a narrow channel.

Augustin Jean-Chretien Sibertin-Blanc is the delightfully quirky AUGUSTIN – a 32-year-old insurance clerk who dreams of becoming a great dramatic actor yet is totally unaware that he’s already a one-man comedy show. The odd parts Augustin has landed – in an insecticide commercial, as run-over pedestrian, and a cod thief, are due not to his acting but to his naturally droll personality. Augustin’s charm is such that everyone who encounters him laughs at him when they might just as easily swat him. Even real-life French film idol Thierry Lhermitte can’t help but be amused rather than offended when the geeky Augustin audaciously offers him acting tips during an audition! Aunt Danielle (Tatie Danielle) Auntie Danielle, supposedly in ailing health but in reality just a nasty old bitch, lives with a paid housekeeper who she regularly abuses. When the housekeeper dies falling off a ladder, Danielle moves in with her great-nephew and his family.

Joining them for the meal will be a Danish general who, as a young soldier, courted one of the sisters, but she turned him away because of her religion. The village elders all resolve not to enjoy the meal, but can their moral fiber resist the sensual pleasure of Babette's cooking?

When the Archbishop of Bedford suspects his eccentric cousin of poisoning his wife and disposing of the body, he sets off a wild and uproarious series of events spurred on by an upper-class disdain of scandal.

Then a bigoted coworker (Gerard Depardieu) tries to worm his way into the nebbish's good graces because he's afraid of being fired. In the wrong hands, The Closet could be ham-fisted slapstick. What makes this movie truly delightful is the superb understatement with which every gag is handled; even the sight of Auteuil wearing a giant condom tip on his head has an impeccable deadpan grace. All the performances are excellent; Depardieu's smarm is particularly delicious. Each scene takes a new twist of social discomfort and befuddlement in this winning comedy.

Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King In a dark age long passed, young Siegfried witnesses the horrible murder of his father, King Siegmund of the Netherlands. Vowing to take back one day what is rightfully his, Siegfried is granted refuge at an allied royal court. Under the watchful eye of his spell-casting mother, Hjordis, Siegfried rigorously trains for his big day of revenge, becoming a powerful warrior. Acquiring a magical sword forged from a fallen star, he sets out to rid the land from the brutal reign of the dragon Fafnir and to gain control over the gold Fafnir stole from the mythical Nibelungs. Victorious, Siegfried baths in the dragon's blood, making him invincible. His merriment is quickly tarnished, however, when the Nibelungs appear, wanting their gold back. Frustrated that they will not even negotiate their fair share, Siegfried, leaves the a portion, but takes for himself The Ring- the beautiful core piece of the Nibelung treasure.

Days of Glory (Indigènes) Algeria, 1943, through Italy and France, to Alsace in early 1945, with a coda years later. Arabs volunteer to fight Nazis to liberate France, their motherland. We follow Saïd, dirt poor, an orderly for a grizzled sergeant, Martinez, a pied noir with some willingness to speak up for his Arab troops; Messaoud, a crack shot, who in Province falls in love with a French woman who loves him back; and Abdelkader, a corporal, a budding intellectual with a keen sense of injustice. The men fight with courage against a backdrop of small and large indignities: French soldiers get better food, time for leave, and promotions. Is the promise of liberty, equality, and fraternity hollow? Deceits of Scapin Scapin constantly lies and tricks people to get ahead. He is an arrogant, pompous man who acts as if nothing were impossible for him. However, he is also a diplomatic genius. He manages to play the other characters off of each other very easily, and yet manages to keep his overall goal — to help the young couples — in sight. In their fathers' absence, Octave has secretly married Hyacinthe and Léandre has secretly fallen in love with Zerbinette. But the fathers return from a trip with marriage plans for their respective sons. Scapin, after hearing many pleas for help, comes to their rescue. Thanks to many tricks and lies, Scapin manages to come up with enough money from the parents to make sure that the young couples get to stay married. But, no one knows who Hyacinthe and Zerbinette really are. It ends in the classic 'And they lived happily ever after,' and Scapin is even brought to the head of the table at the ending feast (even though he has to fake a fatal wound to make it happen). Decline of the American Empire Four very different Montreal university teachers gather at a rambling country house to prepare a dinner. Remy (married), Claude (a homosexual), Pierre (involved with a girlfriend) and Alain (a bachelor) discuss sex, the female body and their affairs with them. Meanwhile, their four female guests, Louise (Remy's wife of 15 years), Dominique (a spinster), Diane (a divorcée) and Danielle (Pierre's girlfriend) are spending the time at a downtown health gym. They also discuss sex, the female body and, naturally, men. Later in the evening, they finally meet at the country house and have dinner. The discussion? Well, you can guess it... However, a ninth guest, named Mario, who used to know Diane, drops in on the group for some talk and has a surprise of his own.

Diabolique Before Psycho, Peeping Tom, and Repulsion, there was Diabolique. This thriller from Henri‑Georges Clouzot (Le corbeau, The Wages of Fear), which shocked audiences in Europe and the U.S., is the story of two women—the fragile wife and the willful mistress of a sadistic school headmaster—who hatch a daring revenge plot. With its unprecedented narrative twists and unforgettably scary images, Diabolique is a heart-grabbing benchmark in horror filmmaking. Diary of a Country Priest, The A young priest arrives in the French country village of Ambricourt to attend to his first parish, but the apathetic and hostile rural congregation rejects him immediately. Through his diary entries, the suffering young man relays a crisis of faith that threatens to drive him away from the village and from God. The fourth film by Robert Bresson (Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne) finds the director beginning to implement his stylistic philosophy as a filmmaker, stripping away all inessential elements from his compositions, the dialogue and the music, and exacting a purity of image and sound. Dinner for Cretins (Le Diner De Cons) To amuse themselves at a weekly dinner, a few well-heeled folk each bring a dimwit along who is to talk about his pastime. Each member seeks to introduce a champion dumbbell. Pierre, an avid participant of the game, runs into one problem after another that devilishly compromises his secrets, turning the tables on him and his objective, which diverges as the movie progresses. Firstly, wishing to be certain he has selected a winner, he invited his guest, Mr. Pignon, to meet him at home before setting off; but night of all nights, Pierre has put his back out and it is questionable whether he can manage to get to the dinner.

Doctor Despite Himself, The (Le medecin malgré lui) An attack on doctors, written seven years in advance of The Imaginary Invalid, and was a loosely structured farce, in which a woodcutter, again, by the name of Sganarelle, (Moliere, himself, by the way, played all the Sganarelles) finds himself mistaken for a doctor, when his angry wife plays a trick on him. Of course the patient that he is called in to see is only faking an illness to keep from being married off to someone she doesn't love. In the meantime, however, Sganarelle develops an irresistable urge toward the household's wetnurse, discovering that the disguise of doctor provides a cover for any number of abuses. Dog of Flanders, A Thanks to the support of a loving dog that he helps nurse back to health, an aspiring young artist never gives up hope, despite being subjected to all sorts of terrible hardships. Dom juan The story of this play follows the last two days in the life of a young courtier, Dom Juan Tenorio, a libertine, a seducer of women and an atheist. He is accompanied throughout the play by his valet, Sganarelle, a truculent, superstitious, cowardly, greedy fellow who engages with his master in intellectual debates. The unrepentant Don Juan will not escape the vengeance of Heaven, and he is ultimately punished. The various settings are all in Sicily. Dreamlife of Angels, The In Lille, two penniless young women with few prospects become friends. Isa moves in with Marie, who's flat-sitting for a mother and child in hospital in comas following a car crash. Isa is out-going, unskilled, with hopes of moving south to warmer climes. Marie usually is either angry or detached. Then, while Isa begins to visit the child in whose flat they live, going to hospital to read to her, Marie slowly falls for a rich youth. At first Marie keeps him at bay, then she not only pursues him, she begins to dream he is her life's love. When Isa tries to warn Marie, their friendship flounders. How will Marie handle the inevitable? And once they lose the flat, where will they go? Dreamlife of Angels, The 42-year-old Erick Zonca first gained international success with this chronicle of a tenuous friendship between two young women in northern France. Élodie Bouchez and Natacha Régnier shared the Best Actress award at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival for their work as the two directionless girls, who find romance and meager work as the situations arise. Zonca uses the two characters as representatives of the kinds of positive and negative emotional choices that affect people for the rest of their lives: while Bouchez's Isa shows an affinity for neglected, sensitive souls like herself, Régnier's Marie deepens her wounds by taking up with men who reinforce her low sense of self-worth. Régnier's short-fused performance commands immediate attention, but it's Bouchez's delicate, reserved compassion that makes the film worth seeing. Zonca is an affectionate but distanced director; events in the film occur with an unhurried authenticity. Drummer-Crab ( Le Crambe Tambour) A dying French naval frigate captain tries to make a last rendezvous in the winter storm-tossed seas off the Grand Banks, with 'le crab tambour,' a French war hero he had betrayed twenty years earlier. 'Le crab tambour' the drummer crab' was a boyhood nickname for the handsome young Alsatian whom the film depicts proving his courage, first in the war in French Indochina, and then again in the 'Generals' Revolt' in Algeria. Courtmartialed because friends like the French naval captain were afraid to risk their own careers by testifying for him, the exiled 'crab tambour' and his trawler, The Shamrock, is now a legend among the Grand Banks fishermen. Elegant Criminal On 9 January 1836, Pierre Lacenaire goes to the guillotine, a murderer and a thief. He gives Allard, a police inspector, his life story, written while awaiting execution. He also asks Allard to care for Hermine, a lass to whom he has been guardian for more than ten years. In flashbacks, from the prison as Lacenaire writes, from Allard's study as he and Hermine read, and from other readers' memory after the book is published, we see Lacenaire's childhood as he stands up to bullies, including priests, his youthful thieving, his first murder, his brief army career, his seduction of a princess, and his affair with Avril, a young man who dies beside him. Equality for All (Egalite for All: Toussaint Louverture & Haitian) Egalité for All: Toussaint Louverture and the Haitian Revolutiontells the story of the only successful slave insurrection in history. It grasped the full meaning of French revolutionary ideas — liberté, eqalité, fraternité — and used them to create the world’s first black republic. It changed the trajectory of colonial economics ... and led to America’s acquisition of the Louisiana territory from France. “It” was the Haitian Revolution, a movement that’s been called the true birth moment of universal human rights. Vaguely remembered today, the Haitian Revolution was a hurricane at the turn of the nineteenth century — traumatizing Southern planters and inspiring slaves and abolitionists, worldwide. Eternal Return In his adaptation of the Tristan and Isolde legend, Jean Cocteau modernizes its eternal theme while making his mark as a master of poetic realism. The tragic story of a young man who falls hopelessly in love with his uncle's wife conjures both beauty and agony through intense dramatic performances, romantic Wagnerian music, and imaginative settings. Eye of Vichy 'The Eye of Vichy' is a brilliantly chosen compilation of long forgotten film footage and newsreels produced by the Nazis and French collaborators during World War Two. From the small town of Vichy in central France, Field Marshall Petain's puppet government worked with their nazi overlords in creating pro-Nazi propaganda. Seeking to turn the tide of public emotion against both the Allied Forces and the Jews, they skillfully produced a strange alternative history of the war years that is shocking and grimly fascinating. French New Wave founder Claude Chabrol creates a masterful look at Nazis and media manipulation that is as engrossing as any of his thrillers. Faat Kine In Faat Kine, Ousmane Sembene, the unquestioned father of African cinema, calls his fellow Africans to a reckoning of the post-independence era at the beginning of a new century. At 77, he sums up 40 years of path-breaking filmmaking with a penetrating analysis of the interplay of gender, economics and power in today's Africa. Sembene accomplishes all this through the deceptively light domestic drama of Faat Kine, a gas station operator born, significantly, the same year as Senegalese independence, 1960. Faat Kine is, from its first shot to its surprising last, Sembene's tribute to what he calls the 'everyday heroism of African women.' In the opening frame, a procession of traditionally dressed women wends its way majestically through the hectic heart of modern Dakar. Faat Kine lets them pass and drives on as she carries their story into the present. Sembene has said: 'Africa's society and economy are held together today by women. But how can women have these responsibilities and yet be denied the same privileges as men?' Although the film covers several days, it feels more like a single day in the life of Faat Kine, from learning of her children's successful exam results in the morning to their party that night. This apparently uneventful plot is interspersed with brief flashbacks, announced by music cues, as Faat Kine recalls the struggles that made this moment of quiet achievement possible. Sembene dares in this latest film to reduce narrative to a minimum because Faat Kine is not so much a drama of events, as a drama of recognition, a long-overdue accounting which in its last scenes turns into a virtual public trial of a generation of misleaders. Throughout the film, it becomes clear that traditional roles, between males and females, parents and children, no longer apply and that it is time to start calling things by their real names. For example, Mammy describes herself as the 'daughter' of her daughter. Far Side of The Moon A man pondering the unrecognized aspects of space travel has more than a few problems to contend with on Earth in this French Canadian drama. Phillippe (Robert Lepage) is 'professional student' who lives with his ailing mother (Anne-Marie Cadieux) in a small, run-down apartment in Quebec. Phillippe has spent years working on his doctoral thesis, which looks at the philosophical and emotional consequences of the race into space between the United States and the Soviet Union during the 1960s and '70s. Phillippe just barely supports himself as a telemarketer, his cold-calling has put him in touch with a former girlfriend who isn't especially happy to hear from him, and an attempt to discuss his research with a former Russian cosmonaut has near-disastrous results. Phillippe also has to put up with his younger brother André (also played by Lepage), a television weather announcer who has money, a small degree of fame, a handsome boyfriend, and almost no respect for Phillippe. As his mother's health takes a severe turn for the worst, Phillippe's luck seems to have changed at last when he's invited to Russia to discuss his recently published thesis on the space program, but André is not willing to help look after their mother. Far Side of the Moon (aka La Face Cachée de la Lune) was written, directed, and edited by leading man Lepage, who adapted the script from his own stage play. Farewell, My Queen In July 1789, the French Revolution is rumbling. Far from the turmoil, at the Château de Versailles, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette and their courtiers keep on living their usual carefree lives. But when the news of the storming of the Bastille reaches them, panic sets in and most of the aristocrats and their servants desert the sinking ship, leaving the Royal Family practically alone. Which is not the case of Sidonie Laborde, the Queen's reader, a young woman, entirely devoted to her mistress; she will not give her up under any circumstances. What Sidonie does not know yet is that these are the last three days she will spend in the company of her beloved Queen Father And Son (Hautot Pere et Fils, Chez Maupassant) Victim of a hunting accident, Hautot father is a rich peasant who reveals his double life to his son and asks him to take care of his mistress.

French Twist (Gazon Maudit) After learning of her husband's infidelities, a housewife invites a lesbian to move in with them. None of their lives will ever be the same again. Fullbright The Man, The Mission & The Message America, in the middle of the 20th Century, was a country searching for a domestic and international identity. The end of World War II, followed by the Cold War, Korean, and Vietnam Wars; the American debate over civil rights; and, a global, economic sea change that laid a foundation for new alliances in Europe and Asia, were among the major events that shaped policies and programs, many of which continue to influence the lives of Americans today. Standing tall in the midst of these changes was Senator J. William Fulbright, a man whose political and intellectual influence helped define the United Nations, establish the Fulbright Program, and shape United States foreign policy. The vision of Senator Fulbright was of global, peaceful coexistence based upon a deep understanding and respect of other cultures as an alternative to conflict. When Fulbright died in 1995 his wife, Mrs Harriet Mayor Fulbright, began to explore ways to keep alive Fulbright's vision, his words, and ideas - many still relevant today. Harriet Fulbright understood one significant characteristic of her late husband's lifework: he was always examining the next horizon, searching for new, and better ideas in international relations. Senator Fulbright would not have wanted a reiteration of his own life to be his only legacy. His messages and his work should be debated, applied, even amended to new situations and events that shape our lives in the 21st Century.

Varda's own ruminations on her life as a filmmaker (a gleaner of sorts), gives her a connection to her subjects that creates a touching human portrait that the L.A. Weekly called 'a protest film that's part social critique, part travelogue, but always an unsentimental celebration of human resilience.

The story centres on the obsession he and his friends had with the Montreal Canadiens' organization and their star player, Maurice 'The Rocket' Richard.[1] He writes of how they emulated Richard's style and mannerisms, and on the ice: 'we were five Maurice Richards against five other Maurice Richards, throwing themselves on the puck. We were ten players all wearing the uniform of the Montréal Canadiens, all with the same burning enthusiasm. Holidays In France (Les Fetes en France) France’s long and colorful history has given its people many reasons to celebrate—the country’s calendar contains a large number of historical and religious festivals. Filmed entirely in France, this entertaining program explores five of the most significant French holidays Horace Based on the classic Emile Zola novel, Jean Renoir's La bete humaine was one of the legendary director's greatest popular successes, tapping into the fatalism of a nation in despair. Jean Gabin's emblematic portrayal of doomed train engineer Jacques Lantier granted him a permanent place in the hearts of his countrymen. Part poetic realism, part film noir, the film is a hard-boiled and suspenseful journey into the tormented psyche of a workingman. Horse of Pride, The (Le Cheval d'orgueil) Based on Pierre-Jakez Helias' best-selling autobiographical novel of the same name, The Horse of Pride (Le Cheval D'Orgueil) is a lyrical tale of Britanny from 1908 to 1918 .

Too poor to own a real horse, they are content to ride 'their horse of pride', an adage passe d down from generation to generation. In addition to exploring the customs and folklore of the Bretons, the film reveals the important changes brought about by World War I - when the real world began to impose itself on these primitive environs and an era of innocence gradually came to a close. Horseman on the Roof, The A rousing, passionate adventure! In a world ravaged by revolution and violence, two strangers -- a handsome renegade (Oliver Martinez, UNFAITHFUL) and a beautiful countess (Binoche) -- find their only chance for survival in each other!

Human Resources The 35-hour work week has all of France in its thrall. This film turns it into a feature about economic and familial politics. Frank, a business school graduate, returns to his provincial hometown to take a management position in the factory where his father has been working for 30 years. First Frank makes the mistake of actually asking the workers on the assembly line for their opinions. Then upper management manipulates his findings to lay off employees. This creates a huge rift, not only between labor and management, but between father and son. A human morality tale that evokes paternal and filial love, and illustrates the personal risk behind political ideas. Hypocrite (Depardieu) (Le Tartuffe) Moliere's timeless comedy, starring the incomparable Donald Moffat portraying the scoundrel Tartuffe, who manipulates his way into the confidence and affection of Orgon, an affluent bourgeois concerned with his own salvation. I want well (J'veux Bien) Filmed on location in Paris and surrounding areas, the 'J'veux bien!' video is a lively mix of narrated cultural segments and situational presentations illustrating language use.

Incendies A mother's last wishes send twins Jeanne and Simon on a journey to the Middle East in search of their tangled roots. Adapted from Wajdi Mouawad's acclaimed play, Incendies tells the powerful and moving tale of two young adults' voyage to the core of deep-rooted hatred, never-ending wars and enduring love. Indigènes During WWII, four North African men enlist in the French army to liberate that country from Nazi oppression, and to fight French discrimination. Indochine Deneuve stars as Elaine Devries, the seemingly repressed owner of a prosperous rubber plantation in French Indochina. Her steely exterior, however, is only a mask intended to hide her torrid love affairs from upperclass society. But when her adopted Indochinese daughter innocently falls in love with Eliane's secret lover, the scandalous lovers' triangle threatens to destroy their entire family. A sensual story of unbridled passionset against the violence of the bloody Communist uprising, INDOCHINE is a historically accurate, emotionally wrenching epic of love and war. Intervision Set in the future, this is the story of the success and fall of a man. Intouchables When Driss, an ex-con from the projects, is hired to take care of an eccentric French aristocrat named Philippe, his newfound job quickly becomes an unpredictable adventure. Speeding a Maserati through Paris, seducing women and paragliding over the Alps is just the beginning, as Driss turns the often humorous world of upper-class Parisian society upside-down. As this unlikely duo overcome adversity of every flavor in this true story, they also shatter their preconceptions of love, life and each other. Is Paris Burning? In this sprawling, star-laden film, we see the struggles of various French resistance factions to regain control of Paris near the end of World War II. The Nazi general in charge of Paris, Dietrich von Cholitz (Fröbe), is under orders from Hitler himself to burn the city if he cannot control it or if the Allies get too close. Much of the drama centers around the moral deliberations of the general, the Swedish ambassador (Welles), and the eager but desperate leaders of the resistance. Italian Straw Hat, The (Un Chapeau de Paille D'italie) Rene Clair s sparkling comedy of manners is a witty, delicate, inspired satire on propriety and behavior in the bourgeois mind-set. Transposing the action of the perennial stage farce from 1851 to a summer wedding day in 1895 the birth of cinema Clair recalls detail, costume and design captured by the first movies. The Italian Straw Hat Un Chapeau de paille d Italie triumphantly survives its 1927 journey from stage to screen; a dozen eccentric characters, superbly acted, try desperately to keep up appearances in the face of disaster, their attitudes, concerns and gestures exquisitely stylized under Clair s deft orchestration. The sets and costumes, too are a charming combination of the suffocating and the exact. A bridegroom is riding to his marriage when his horse eats a straw hat hanging on a branch while its owner, a married lady, enjoys a tryst behind the bush with her lover, a fierce hussar. She cannot go home without her hat, so the groom interlaces his wedding with an attempt to find madam a twin chapeau, launching a series of misunderstandings and embarrassments. Jean de Florette A greedy landowner and his backward nephew conspire to block the only water source for an adjoining property in order to bankrupt the owner and force him to sell.

Close to two million Vietnamese flee by boat but before they reach safety thousands of them will die. From the jungles of Vietnam to the streets of Southern California Journey From the Fall tells the untold story of what happened to millions of Vietnamese in the aftermath of the war. Jules and Jim French New Wave filmmaker François Truffaut's third film tells a dilettantish ménage-â-trois taking place around World War I, with Jeanne Moreau as the femme fatale at its center. The major theme of the film is the inability of the characters (Jules, Jim and the woman both are infatuated with, Catherine) to abandon a stage of youthful idealism and the longing for an illusory freedom. Changing constantly from pathos to whimsy and back again, the film is still fascinating to watch after almost half a decade. Jeanne Moreau's tired beauty has an erotic suggestibility that remains unmatched in the history of cinema. King is Dancing, The The King is Dancing tells the story of Louis XIV (Benoit Magimel) heir to the throne of a troubled kingdom. The future king, a shy young man, has his destiny altered when muscian Jean-Baptiste Lully (Boris Terral) and the famed playwright Moliere (Tcheky Karyo) enter his life. They immediately recognize the young king's talent for dance and with breathtaking artistry they compose and stage ballets that glorify Louis's image. The young monarch is transformed into the The Royal Dancer - The Sun King, a God on earth. King of Hearts During the latter part of World War I, Private Charles Plumpick is chosen to go into the French town of Marville and disconnect a bomb that the German army has planted. However, Charles is chased by some Germans and finds himself holed up at the local insane asylum, where the inmates are convinced that he is the 'King of Hearts.' Feeling obligated to help the inmates, Charles attempts to lead them out of town, but they are afraid to leave and frolic about the streets in gay costumes. Will Charles be able to deactivate the bomb in time and save his newfound friends? Kings of Pastry The collar awarded to the winners of the Meilleur Ouvrier de France (Best Craftsman in France) is more than the ultimate recognition for every pastry chef - it is a dream and an obsession. The 3-day competition includes everything from delicate chocolates to precarious six foot sugar sculptures and requires that the chefs have extraordinary skill, nerves of steel and luck. The film follows Jacquy Pfeiffer, founder of The French Pastry School in Chicago, as he returns to France to compete against 15 of France's leading pastry chefs. The filmmakers were given first time/exclusive access to this high-stakes drama of passion, sacrifice, disappointment and joy in the quest to have President Sarkozy declare them one of the best in France. Kirikou and the Sorceres This animated film exquisitely recounts the tale of tiny Kirikou -- a clever, courageous little boy born in an African village in which Karaba the Sorceress has placed a terrible curse -- as he sets out on a quest to free his village of the curse and find out the secret of why Karaba is so wicked. Kirikou depicts a precocious newborn infant who battles ignorance, and so-called evil, with endearing perseverance. This film speaks to the child within us all who yearns to express and defend the best in others and ourselves. Kirikou's stunning visuals are accented by a traditional music soundtrack by African music giant Youssou N' Dour. Kirikou and the Wild Beasts 'Kirikou et les bêtes sauvages' Kirikou's Grandfather says that the story of Kirikou and The Witch was too short, so he proceeds to explain more about Kirikou's accomplishments. We find out how little boy became a gardener, a detective, a maker of pottery, a merchant, a traveler and a doctor. Kirkou and the Witch 'Kirikou and the Sorceress' In a troubled African village, an unusual baby is born. Korkoro In this passionate WWII drama, a tightly-knit family of Gypsies journeys through occupied France, trying to avoid the violent Vichy patrols. Directed with wit and vigor by Tony Gatlif (Latcho Drom), Korkoro unearths the hidden story of the Romany people s joys and struggles during the war.Along the way a young French orphan named Claude (Mathias Laliberté) joins their ranks, and is initiated into their culture. Under the tutelage of acrobatic wild man Taloche (James Thiérrée), Claude learns to love his adoptive family. As the Vichy government passes a law restricting their movement, they avoid capture with the help of a local mayor and schoolteacher, who also have ties to the Resis- tance. But the longer they avoid arrest, the more dangerous their lives become.With free-spirited humor and soaring emotion, Korkoro is a revelatory movie about a little known chapter in WWII history. The phenomenal performances, especially Thiérrée s intensely physical efforts, truly make history come alive. The Birdcage(La Cage aux folles) A likable 1977 French farce (and the basis for the 1996 American remake, The Birdcage), this popular comedy was one of the most successful international films of all time, and even spawned a Broadway musical and two sequels. It tells the story of a gay couple who--when one man's son from a previous liaison brings home his fiancée--masquerade as husband and wife for their prospective in-laws. The film is saved from becoming an exercise in silliness by the heartfelt characterizations of the gay nightclub owners. La Cage aux Folles is one of the funniest imports from Europe and a great comedy in any venue. The Novena(La Neuvaine) The faith of a caring physician and an unquestioningly religious youth is shaken to the core when the pair is inexplicably brought together. La Vie en Rose Edith Piaf is the subject of La Vie en Rose, director Olivier Dahan's powerful if emotionally redundant biographical film about the iconic French superstar whose life, as depicted here, seems to have been a numbing succession of tragedies interrupted on occasion by artistic triumph. Dahan's portrait begins with Piaf's stay in a brothel as a young girl. Left to the care of her grandmother (who runs the place) after her father pulls her away from a narcissistic mother, Piaf undergoes significant health problems and grows up to sing on the street in lieu of outright prostitution. The film pulses along with the usual biopic rhythms, with pivotal moments in the life of Piaf (played as an adult by Marion Cotillard) turning up regularly only to be smacked aside by the unseen hand of perpetual misfortune. There's the impresario (Gerard Depardieu) who recognizes Piaf's great but raw talent only to have a run-in with the criminal element around her. There's the heavyweight fighter (Marcel Cerdan) who becomes the love of Piaf's life but can't be with her. Drug addiction, random car accidents, tax problems, you name it, it's all here, topped by an unnerving revelation that pops up in La Vie en Rose's final moments. After awhile, with such a concentration of bad news squeezed into 140 minutes, one begins to wish Dahan had taken a more expansive approach to Piaf's life and times. But the film is never less than interesting, and the lead performance by Cotillard is often astonishing. --Tom Keogh Lancelot of the Lake This 1974 masterpiece by the late Robert Bresson (Mouchette) is a remarkable act of mythic revisionism. Stripped bare of its enduring romance, the Arthurian legend in Bresson's hands becomes an ugly and uncomfortably familiar vision of powerful men capable of cruelty, rivalry, disillusionment, and self-destruction. Lancelot (Luc Simon) is portrayed as a ruthless and ignoble opportunist who returns from his impossibly futile mission to locate the Holy Grail, only to callously rekindle his affair with Guinevere (Laura Duke Condominas). The emotional impact of the film is that of pure shock: the Arthurian ideal turns out to have little chance in the real world, and as there may be nothing worse than a hollow dream, the Knights of the Round Table descend into selfishness. Known as the great minimalist of French cinema, Bresson uses his trademark repression of energy--editing action sequences so that the visual emphasis is on tiny details--to create a tension that finally snaps with the mucky dissipation of the dream on unhallowed ground: Camelot ending not with a bang or a whimper but with the last clank of armor in a deluded cause. Last Year At Marienband Connoisseur Video Collection VHS (Alain Resnais )' In a huge, old-fashioned luxury hotel a stranger tries to persuade a married woman to run away with him, but it seems she hardly remembers the affair they may have had (or not?) last year at Marienbad. Laurence Wylie A walking tour of the village of Roussillon, France known as Peyrane. Wylie comments on the social changes which have occurred since his first visit in 1950. He interviews several of the inhabitants who add insights into contemporary French culture. Le Chemin du retour (All Roads Lead Home) The story is about a 12 year old girl who loses her mother in an automobile accident. Her father struggles with the loss of his wife and trying to raise his young daughter who believes her father is partly responsible for her mother's death. Belle's maternal grandfather is a changed man since losing his daughter in the accident. He finds it difficult to have a relationship with Belle since she is a constant reminder of her mother. It is Atticus the new puppy who will change Belle's life and the lives of those who love her. The Grand Highway(Le Grand Chemin) A really superior film, this story of a 9 year-old boy leaving his mother temporarily to live in a small French town. He becomes educated to the ways of adults with the help of a worldy-wise girl aged 10. Although children are featured, this definitely is an adult movie, not one for small children. Quite simply this is one of the Best French films of the last fifty years. The relatively unknown Jean-Loup Hubert has produced the kind of film that the overrated Godard could not turn out if you gave him a hundred years (to be fair to the semi-Amateur Godard he would probably have no interest in addressing the Human Condition in such a refreshing straightforward fashion). The tone is set from the first with a wistful, haunting music track leading us into a nineteen fifties French countryside preserved in amber as Christine Pascal entrusts her son (Antoine Hubert) to the care of her friend Marcelle (Anemone) and her husband Pelo (Richard Bohringer). This is a French film and French film in a rural setting so we meet Marcelle as she is removing the eye of a rabbit with a knife as a prelude to skinning it. It's a great metaphor for the changes Louis will experience in the next few weeks (you don't see this in Paris, kid) and it also prepares us, the audience, for an arguably alien lifestyle embracing outside privys and indoor chamber pots. Writer-director Hubert (he adapted his own autobiographical novel for the screen) bravely cast his own son, Antoine, in the key role of Louis, despite the boy's complete lack of acting experience and the experiment paid off handsomely. Nor can we argue that he found it easy to coax a performance from his own flesh and blood because he has coaxed an even better performance from Vanessa Guedi as Martine, the ten-year-old tomboy who teaches Louis so much in such a short time. Learned Women 'Les Femmes Savantes', The Les Femmes savantes (The Learned Ladies) is a comedy by Molière in five acts, written in verse. A satire on academic pretention, female education, and préciosité (French for preciousness), it was one of his most popular comedies. It premiered at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal on 11 March 1672. Les Beurettes Les Boys Ever wanted to know what guys say when they get together? This light- hearted comedy explores the male world through an amateur hockey team. Every male stereotype is analyzed, comically of course. Les Fêtes en France France's long and colorful history has given its people many reasons to celebrate- the country's calendar contains a large number of historical and religious festivals. Filmed entirely in France, this entertaining program explores five of the most significant French holidays: Pâques (Easter), Les Fêtes des Rois (Three Kings Day), Poisson dÁvril (April Fool's Day), La Fête Nationale (The National Celebration, also known in English as Bastille Day), and Nöel (Christmas). The video addresses the importance of cultural awareness in learning a language. Les Miserables This brilliant film manages to reinterpret the story of Victor Hugo's classic novel, critique it, and investigate the nature of art and life on top of that--all in three hours that zip past, fueled by the dynamic performance of French icon Jean-Paul Belmondo (Breathless, Le Doulos). In 1900, Henri Fortin (Belmondo) is wrongfully imprisoned for murder; his loyal wife is forced into menial labor and prostitution; then in the beginning of World War II, Fortin's son (Belmondo again) helps a Jewish family elude the Nazis, setting in motion his own imprisonment, escape, and adventures as a criminal. Not only is that just the first half of the movie, there are also the story lines of the husband, wife, and daughter of the Jewish family, who each have their own struggles. The conclusion is joyous and heartbreaking. Director Claude Lelouch (A Man and a Woman) handles the entire movie with supreme skill, humor, and compassion. Liberation of Normandie, The Liberation of Paris, The In August 1944, after four years of occupation, Parisians revolted against the Germans, ahead of the arrival of Allied troops. General de Gaulle welcomed the residents in his famous speech to the City Hall.To understand how this liberation did indeed take place, the director went to meet witnesses of the time, like veterans of the German army, resistance fighters, American soldiers and the simple people. Life And Nothing But January, 1920. 350,000 French soldiers remain missing in action. Major Dellaplane tirelessly matches the dead and the wounded with families' descriptions. Honor and ethics drive him; he hates the idea of 'the unknown soldier.' Into his sector, looking for her husband, comes a haughty, politically connected Parisian, Madame Irène de Courtil. Brusquely, Dellaplane offers her 1/350,000th of his time, but as their paths cross and she sees his courage and resolve, feelings change. After he finds a surprising connection between her missing husband and a local teacher, Irène makes Dellaplane an offer. This man of action hesitates: has he missed his only chance? Life Is a Long Quiet River Two babies are switched at birth. When the mistake is discovered 12 years later, it leads to complications in the lives of both families. One family is affluent, with dutiful and (apparently) contented children. The other family is poor, with rambunctious (even delinquent) children, often hungry, but with lots of laughter in the house. Little Girl who sold the Sun, The (Cinema d'afrique DVD) A twelve year old paraplegic becomes the first girl to sell a daily newspaper in the competitive world of young male newspaper vendors. Little Nicholas (Le petit Nicolas) This dark, slightly absurdist comedy from France topped the French box office in 2009, becoming a local phenomenon. It is narrated by Nicolas (Maxime Godart), an eight-year-old boy supremely happy with his loving, doting parents and a colorful group of friends. It seems that life couldn't possibly improve - until Nicolas eavesdrops on his folks and surmises that his mother is pregnant. Horrified, he envisions a scenario where a new baby brother arrives and crowds him out of the house, leaving his parents with no time to care for him. Nicolas and his friends then cook up a series of wild schemes to dispose of the baby. Little Red Ridding Hood These simple renditions of the Little Red Ridding Hood story privide a perfect opportunity to let students hear a foreign language in a context where understanding is virtually assured. Living in France Three attendees at a puppet theater don various roles in order to sing a variety of songs by Jacques Brel, all while hippies and other eccentrics cavort about them.
