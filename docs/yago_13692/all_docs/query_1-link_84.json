        "text": "Benjamin Ward, who began his career as a traffic officer in white gloves on First Avenue, moved through a succession of state and city law-enforcement posts and eventually became the first black commissioner of the New York City Police Department, died yesterday at a Queens hospital. He was 75.\n\nMr. Ward was taken unconscious to New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens on Friday evening, said Sgt. Michael Wyskowski, a Police Department spokesman. He suffered from asthma most of his life.\n\nMr. Ward, whose booming voice and strong sense of self made him seem even taller than his 6 feet 1 inch, was a lifelong study in focused ambition. The son of a cleaning woman, he earned degree after degree while working at full-time jobs. He served as city traffic commissioner, as corrections commissioner for both state and city, and as chief of the city housing police before becoming New York's top police official.\n\nIn more than five years as police commissioner, from 1983 to 1989, he commanded the city's war against the scourge of crack and the addicts desperately in need of money for their habit. It was a wild period of heightened crime, when many people put signs on their parked cars declaring no radio was inside.\n\n''He was operating with very, very limited resources, and he was able to reassure the public that the Police Department was in control,'' said Robert McGuire, who served as police commissioner from 1978 to 1983.\n\nAlong the way, Mr. Ward achieved national visibility by becoming one of the nation's first promoters of community policing in which officers add an element of social work to their presence on the beat.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
