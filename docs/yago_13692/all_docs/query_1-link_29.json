        "text": "It’s a world just like ours – only with orcs and elves (and magic, obviously).\n\nWhen the mystical equivalent of a nuclear weapon – a magic wand – is discovered, it falls to Officers Daryl Ward (Will Smith) and Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton) – the first orc in the LAPD – to deal with the situation.\n\nIn a new featurette, Smith and Edgerton discuss their characters and the world they live in.\n\nBright premieres globally on Netflix on December 22nd.\n\nBRIGHT\n\nA NETFLIX FILM\n\nCOMING DECEMBER 22, 2017\n\nThe streets of Los Angeles will never be the same. This December, Will Smith and Joel Edgerton bring the heat (and some hardcore deadly magic) to fans across the world in the Netflix film, Bright. Directed byDavid Ayer, known for the box-office hits such as Suicide Squad and Training Day, this action-thriller follows the story of two LAPD police officers played by Smith (Officer Ward) and Edgerton (Officer Jakoby). InBright, the unlikely duo are working around the clock to keep the mean streets of Los Angeles safe from a sinister underworld filled with gang violence and dark forces at work.\n\nIn this latest sneak peek, Will Smith and Joel Edgerton reveal the unique partnership between their characters Officer Ward and Officer Jakoby. Director David Ayer showcases how these two mismatched partners anchor the story, explaining that “the most important thing about this film is the relationship between Will and Joel.” Take a closer look at the action-packed movie that Will Smith describes as “wildly unique” and watch the brand new trailer when it debuts on October 25th!\n\nBright will be available in select theaters and on Netflix starting December 22nd, 2017.
