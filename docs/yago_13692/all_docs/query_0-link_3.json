        "text": "The immediate film that caused me a contrast effect was The English Patient, the famous overrated Academy Awards stealer. This is not a great film either, but at least it does a better work at retelling a tragic story set in war times.\n\n63/100\n\nA pretty judicious and restrained take on the war drama, even if it has one of the most egregious yellow filter examples set to film. I like the careful focus of the film, and the way that it doesn't stray far from the perspective of its lead's experiences. Some of the scenes come off as maudlin (he drops the earring of a former lover into the puddle and watches it drift away...), but at least the actors bring a little bit of subtlety to it.\n\nBased on a novel, this film deals with a World War I hospital where the Gueules cassées (\"broken faces\") are healed. It's really difficult to find the distance for such a story in a film but cinematography is really wonderful. The scenario deals with the social aspect of the wounds in a very subtle way."
