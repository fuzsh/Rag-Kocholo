        "text": "Rarely has a film impacted an audience and held the test of time as the film Gone with the Wind. I have always been curious if director, Victor Fleming and producer, David O. Selznick and screenplay writer, Sidney Howard knew what they were creating a masterpiece and how this film would have such an enormous impact on audiences for years to come. Interestingly enough there were some who thought the film should not be made, as Irving Thalberg said to Louis B. Meyer in 1936, “Forget it Louis, no Civil War picture ever made a nickel” (Ten Films that Shook the World).\n\nBased off Charles Webb’s 1963 novel by the same name, The Graduate is an American romantic comedy/drama released in the United States on December 21, 1967 starring Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, Katharine Ross, and William Daniels. The film was directed by Mike Nichols, produced by Lawrence Turman and the screenplay written by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham. The film was produced by Lawrence Turman/Mike Nichols productions starting in March of 1967. Mike Nichols has also directed other well known films such as Catch-22 (1970), Working Girl (1988), and more recently Closer (2004). The film was distributed by AVCO Embassy Pictures nationally and United Artists internationally. AVCO Embassy Pictures studio, founded by Joseph E. Levine, the films executive producer, also claims production/distribution for other hit films such as Godzilla, King of Monsters! (1956), The Fog (1980), and Prom Night (1980). The movie was well received due to its $104 million dollar box office opening tab. The score was produced by Dave Grusin and the songs written by Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel.\n\nThe Frontline film Separate and Unequal discussed about creating a new school system; however, there are opposition by others who wants to maintain the current school system. If we look at the perspectives of the two groups, it is understandable in why there is support and opposition from the people of the city. The supporters of the new system wants a system that can provide better opportunities for their children without any violence. As the film claimed “the school was not teaching and were only babysitting the children”, which was likely a reason why there was a need for a new school system. With the chaotic and uncontrollable situation in the current system, many supporters have push forward the idea of a new system in a new city. From\n\nNorth By Northwest is a thriller,mystery and crime film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, that was released in 1959 during the midst of the Cold War era. He depicts the United States Government and their use of spies during the time. When reading about the covert operations used by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War it is astonishing how little the general public knew about the affairs of the government.The film centres on the character of Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive who finds himself mistaken as a United States spy - George Kaplan. Reference to cold war as Edger Hoover said communist were inflicting in corrupting ‘’various spheres of American lives’’.Ultimately, this resulted in a incredible paranoia and\n\nWorking out conflicts face to face can and cannot make a difference in resolving the problem.“These face-to-face interactions build trust, understanding, and a real sense of a shared mission, and this has made all the difference in the world.” This direct quote from Forbes.com explains how this specific way can improve how the world communicates to each other. Many people will disagree with the previous statement, but it is just one of the basic elements of the social system. Admittedly, not everyone believes in face to face interaction. People can choose whichever side they want to, but people can solve their problems by talking to somebody.\n\nJames Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman were on their way to help with trying to get the local African Americans to where they could vote for the elections that they were not allowed to vote for. The three men were arrested on traffic charges and was locked up until a set time in the middle of the night. The three were released and was heading down Highway 19 south toward Meridian, when something strange happened. The three were being following and eventually police sirens were going off and they thought that they were just being pulled over. The police officer that released them and the Ku Klux Klan abducted and killed them. All three were shot and beaten until an unrecognizable state and were put in a swamp like area on County Road 515. The three would be missing for forty-four days before an informant would tell the FBI that was looking for the three where the bodies were located. Before the informant told where the bodies were, people were beginning to think that the whole thing was a hoax and that they were probably somewhere laughing at the whole thing. Name would begin to fly around and fingers would begin to be pointed but there was not enough evidence for the state officials to step in and prosecute the case. However, after much uproar from locals and civil right activists the federal authorities would eventually step in and take over the case.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Schwerner joined forces with SNCC along with his chief aid, James Chaney, a black Mississippi native. They both had hopes that the federal government would be pushed by their numbers to increase FBI and federal protection for the students. The third man on their team was Andrew Goodman. He was a reasonably wealthy, white, 20 year old from Manhattan. Idealistic and eager to work, Andrew had no clue that his first day in Mississippi would also be his last. On the night of June 21st in Neshoba County the three young men disappeared after being stopped on a bogus traffic violation. After discovering their burned out car on the second day of the search, most everyone knew the three had been murdered. The press followed the search and brought the case to the nation’s attention. Many bodies of murdered civil rights workers and black citizens were recovered from the backwaters and swamps as federal agents and Navy seamen scoured Neshoba County. The killers in Neshoba County had made a very grave mistake. They hadn’t just murdered three local “colored boys” this time. The parents of Schwerner and Goodman had money; they had ties. So much so, that they were given an audience with\n\nThe lighting techniques used in the scenarios shall differ, while on one set the cinematographer and director shall play along with low-key lighting, the other scenarios base shall be that of natural light or hard light. The filters that shall be used in the scenarios shall only be set once the script is complete. There shall be a difference in décor, as both these scenarios will not be correlated. The same can be said about the costumes. The placement of the camera, the amalgamation of the type of shots required shall further help provide scenic realism and help derive a desired emotion. The goal is to understand these elements better by further research and practice.\n\nThroughout this class, various discussions and blogs have been used to analyze the different elements of films such as theme, cinematic techniques and genre. It is time to bring all of these separate elements together in the analysis of one specific film, according to class text, “analyzing levels of meaning below the surface story can greatly enhance enjoyment as well as understanding of a film” (Goodykoontz & Jacobs, 2014. p. 10.03). There are several different approaches to film analysis including formalist, auteurist, and generic or any combination thereof. Utilizing a genre theory lens, the 1956 film The Searchers will be analyzed addressing contextual information, story/plot, aesthetic choices, social/personal impact and how these areas come together to develop the film.\n\nThe movie takes place in 1964. Three civil rights workers are killed and the two FBI agents, Ward and Anderson, are hired to investigate the disappearance of them, but they quickly learn that it is not only the disappearance of the three men that is the biggest problem in the Southern town of Mississippi. They find out that the sheriff’s office is linked to Ku Klux Klan. Agent Ward wants to continue with “bureau procedure”, but Anderson, who is well aware of the racial problems in the South, wants to do it in other ways. The local black community has a huge fear of Ku Klux"
