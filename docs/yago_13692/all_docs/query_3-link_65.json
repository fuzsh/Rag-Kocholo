        "text": "A man. A woman. A deserted rest area by the side of a highway, where the man and woman meet by chance. She (Catherine Deneuve) has been abandoned there by an abusive husband who has left her stranded, in her fur coat and fur hat and dark glasses, in the middle of the night. He (Gerard Depardieu) has already been there for a couple of days, trying to fix the engine of his car, an engine that -symbolically, no doubt - will not go.\n\nThey begin to talk. He is brutish at first, rude and familiar, shouting insults as he chases her around the rest area and demands that she go away. He draws an imaginary line and insists that she not cross it. She, for her part, at first wishes only to survive, but then she wants more. She wants shelter, acceptance, relief from her pain. She wants to feel attractive again. He lends her sweat socks and running shoes. It isn't much, but it's a gesture.\n\nSo begins ''A Strange Place to Meet,'' a film by Francois Dupeyron that's essentially a claustrophobic, two-character exercise. Set at the rest area and a nearby truck-stop cafeteria, spanning a period of 48 hours, the film allows its characters, France and Charles, to talk endlessly about very, very little. Their feelings shift, their attachment develops, their pasts are revealed. For neophyte acting students, this material might seem worth playing to the hilt, but for two of the French cinema's greatest stars it's an odd choice indeed. The reasons why Mr. Depardieu and Miss Deneuve chose to co-produce ''A Strange Place to Meet'' will be, for anyone who sees the film, a complete mystery.\n\nAmong the more absurd touches here, beyond the sight of Miss Deneuve wandering dazedly around a truck stop in her dark glasses and sable, are the fact that Mr. Depardieu is supposed to be a surgeon and the peculiar identification that Miss Deneuve's character feels with a woman who has, at the beginning of the story, tried to jump in front of her car. Among the more exemplary lines in the screenplay, by Mr. Dupeyron and Dominique Faysse, are ''Loving someone always ends up as a kind of death'' and, when the pathologically submissive France finally reaches her husband by telephone, ''Did the frost nip the mimosas?'' Mr. Depardieu's Charles is also asked, at one point in the story, to rhapsodize quite seriously about the beauty of running shoes."
