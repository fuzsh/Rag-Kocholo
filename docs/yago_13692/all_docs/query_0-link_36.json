        "text": "Plot\n\nThe film concentrates more on the period spent in hospital than the original novel, and emphasizes the horror of the friends' injuries. On Adrien's arrival at the ward, all the mirrors are removed and staff are instructed not to give any to him, but we see from the expressions on the faces of others just how bad the damage is. Adrien becomes increasingly desperate to see the damage done to his face, even asking a visitor to draw a picture of him. Dupeyron ensures that we do not see the horrifying extent of Adrien's injuries until the moment that he himself does - by looking at his reflection in a window pane.\n\nThere is a strong focus on the fleeting romance between Adrien and Clémence, a woman he meets by chance shortly before departing for the war, and his later attempts to track her down. When he finally does meet her again, she fails to recognise him.\n\nWhereas the novel follows the experiences of the group right up to World War II and beyond, the film ends just after the First World War, the final scene being Adrien's chance meeting with his future wife.\n\nCast\n\nEric Caravaca - Adrien\n\nDenis Podalydès - Henri\n\nGrégori Derangère - Pierre\n\nSabine Azéma as Anaïs\n\nAndré Dussollier as the surgeon\n\nIsabelle Renauld as Marguerite\n\nGéraldine Pailhas as Clémence\n\nJean-Michel Portal as Alain\n\nGuy Tréjan as the minister\n\nXavier De Guillebon as Louis\n\nCatherine Arditi as Adrien's mother\n\nPaul Le Person as Adrien's grandfather\n\nCircé Lethem as Adrien's sister\n\nElise Tielrooy as nurse Cécile\n\nAgathe Dronne as Adrien's wife-to-be\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nCannes Film Festival (France)\n\nNominated: Golden Palm (François Dupeyron)\n\nCésar Awards (France)\n\nWon: Best Cinematography (Tetsuo Nagata)\n\nWon: Best Actor – Supporting Role (André Dussollier)\n\nNominated: Best Actor – Leading Role (Eric Caravaca)\n\nNominated: Best Costume Design (Catherine Bouchard)\n\nNominated: Best Director (François Dupeyron)\n\nNominated: Best Film\n\nNominated: Best Writing (François Dupeyron)\n\nNominated: Most Promising Actor (Grégori Derangère and Jean-Michel Portal)"
