Despite also gaining a degree of popularity in southern Germany and northern Italy, the band were complete unknowns in Britain.\n\nFormed by singer Barry Window aka Berry Window (b. 25 November 1946, Basel, Switzerland), the original formation comprised bass player Peter Rietmann (b. 14 June 1945, Switzerland; d. 2009); sax player Ferdinand Keller; drummer Dietmar Carl; keyboard player Fritz Trippel (b. 10 December 1937, Chur, Switzerland, d. 2010); and – last to join – lead guitarist Ronald William Bryer (b. 23 April 1947, London, England; d. 25 June 1973).\n\nWindow (whose real name is Urs Fenster; Fenster being German for window) started his career as the drummer for R&B/soul band The Sam Wee Five, a popular Basel outfit that never recorded, in 1964.\n\nWindow’s grandfather was born in Brazil while his father Kurt had arrived in Basel via Düsseldorf with the American Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Like his father, Berry mastered the drums but at heart had aspirations to be a singer. He certainly had the voice and stage presence to suggest he could be a dynamic front man and, by June 1967, was ready to step out from behind the drum kit and make his mark.\n\nOne of the first musicians he lined up for The Movements was Peter Rietmann, who had first come to prominence with The Dynamites in spring of 1964.\n\nThe bass player worked with this band until April 1966, leaving to join The Blue Sounds for two months. This fascinating outfit, featured two English musicians – singer/harp player Robert Muir and guitarist Mike Whitlock, who’d come to Basel with Merseyside band The Marksmen.\n\nRietmann, however, didn’t hang around long and soon joined top Austrian outfit, The Slaves, working with them until around March/April 1967 before he briefly gigged with The Countdowns. By early summer, he was ready to join Window in putting The Movements together.\n\nWhile Dietmar Carl (aka Karl) was formerly a member of Basel group The Kettles, the much older Fritz Trippel was a seasoned musician steeped in jazz and well connected in music circles, notably in Stuttgart (more of which shortly).\n\nAccording to the singer, Berry Window & The Movements secured an important engagement at Seiler’s Atlantis, a former coffeehouse that had specialised in jazz when it opened in the late 1940s, within a month of forming. By the mid-1960s, Seiler’s Atlantis had remodeled itself as a rock venue and had hosted a number of visiting British bands to the city.\n\nAt the time The Movements were still without a guitar player but the club booking necessitated a photo session and so a “stand-in” was brought in to pose with the other musicians sitting in a boat in the middle of the River Rhine.\n\nWindow, however, already knew who he wanted as the guitarist – British musician Ron Bryer who until recently had been working with expatriates The Big Wheel, a popular R&B outfit that had played at the Hotel Hirschen in Zurich and the Tanzrad in Basel among others.\n\nBryer had started his career with Bexley, Kent group, The Loose Ends but had departed in mid-1965 before they signed with Decca Records and cut two great Mod 45s, including a cover of George Harrison’s “Taxman”.\n\nBriefly adopting the stage name Ron Spence, the guitarist next worked with The Revellos for six months or so before joining The Carl Douglas Set with future “Kung Fu Fighter” Carl Douglas, and recording some unreleased tracks that were later issued by the Acid Jazz label.\n\nIn June 1966, however, he replaced Del Grace (ironically on his way to replace him in Carl Douglas’ band) in The Big Wheel. Keyboard player Andy Clark, later of Clark-Hutchinson and Upp fame, was instrumental in bringing Bryer into the group.\n\nAfter releasing a lone 45 in Switzerland in February 1967– Clark’s “Don’t Give Up That Easy” c/w “You’re Only Hurting Yourself” on the Eurex label, Bryer was ready for a fresh challenge.\n\nDebuting at Seiler’s Atlantis, Berry Window & The Movements proved so popular with local fans that the club’s owner extended their residency (a photo shows them performing on stage that August). By then, Trippel had used his contacts to secure a recording deal with the Bertelsmann Group Intercord label, based near Stuttgart in West Germany.\n\nRushed into the studios, the band kicked off with two German-language recordings, penned by Trippel: “Abschiedslied” and “Ich Bin Allein”, which were coupled for the band’s debut 45 on the German label.\n\nSoon afterwards, the group recorded its debut English-language single for Intercord, a cover of Bobby Robinson and Irral Berger’s “Warm and Tender Love” backed by Steve Cropper, Eddie Floyd and Alverts Isbell’s “I’ve Got Everything I Need”, issued in late 1967.\n\nThe same line-up was responsible for the follow-up release: an impressive reading of Isaac Hayes and Dave Porter’s “Hold On, I’m Coming” backed with Eddie Floyd and Steve Cropper’s “Knock On Wood”. Both English-language singles proved popular locally.\n\nDuring this period the musicians were still heavily reliant on cover material and recorded their debut LP Soul & Love at Bauer Studios in Ludwigsburg, north of Stuttgart over two days.\n\nDrawing largely on the material they played live, this included impressive takes of Otis Redding and Arthur Conley’s “Sweet Soul Music”; Mack Rice’s “Mustang Sally”; James Brown’s “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag”; and Smokey Robinson and Ronald White’s “My Girl”.\n\nOn 25 November 1967 (Berry’s 21st birthday), the band made a rare TV appearance, guesting on the “Hits A Go-Go” programme, aired in West Germany and Switzerland before resuming their busy live schedule, taking in the Chemilhütte in Basel and the Hazyland in Zurich among others.\n\nSoon afterwards, Fritz Trippel departed and Belgian multi-instrumentalist, composer and keyboard extraordinaire Joel Vandroogenbroeck (b. 24 August 1938, Brussels, Belgium; d. 23 December 2019) took over, raising the standard of musicianship in the process.\n\nHaving made his first appearance on classical piano when he was only six years old, Vandroogenbroeck had toured Europe with The Quincy Jones Orchestra in the late 1950s but had a long and distinguished career. When he met Barry Window & The Movements he was playing with American singer Dee Dee McNeil (more of which shortly).\n\nAround the same time Peter Rietmann followed Trippel out of the door and briefly reunited with the Chur-born keyboardist in the popular Swiss band Les Sauterelles.\n\nBass player Peter Giske (b. 1947, Basel, Switzerland) took over from Rietmann, who later progressed to work with Swiss band Crusade in 1969. Giske had Polish ancestry, adding to the diverse mix of nationalities that comprised The Movements.\n\nDuring early 1968, the group returned to the studio with new drummer Hans-Peter Schweizer to record material for a Swiss-only EP entitled I Like Soul, which featured reworked (and superior) versions of “Knock On Wood”; “Hold On, I’m Coming”; and “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag”. By this point Ferdinand Keller had departed.\n\nThanks to Joel Vandroogenbroeck’s connections with Dee Dee McNeil, the musicians next got the opportunity to record an LP with the American singer for the German MPS Records label in spring 1968. Entitled Soul Hour, the record was credited to Dee Dee, Barry & The Movements.\n\nWith new drummer Wolfgang Paap (b. 1944, Danzig, Germany) behind the kit, the sessions for the LP took place in Basel on 16 and 17 April 1968 and included powerful covers of Allen Touissaint’s “Get Out of My Life Woman”, Wilson Pickett and Steve Cropper’s “In the Midnight Hour”, plus yet another re-recording of “Hold On, I’m Coming”.\n\nSoul Hour also came with some interesting sleeve notes about the individual musicians’ backgrounds. In addition to new member Wolfgang Paap on drums, the album also featured French sax player Barney Wilen (b. 1937, Nice, France), who’d previously worked with Miles Davis among many others.\n\nAround this time Berry Window & The Movements appeared on West German TV show “We Like Soul” playing “Hold On, I’m Coming”. On several tracks Dee Dee McNeil joined Window for a duet and the recording also shows a second sax player.\n\nNot long after, Berry Window & The Movements started work on their second studio LP Soul In Action, which remains arguably one of the best continental LPs recorded during the 1960s. Gone was the reliance on cover material, replaced by superb band originals, mainly co-penned by Vandroogenbroeck and Bryer, such as “I Gave You My Heart”, “Go Away” and the horn- driven soul-rocker “Give Me the Time”.\n\nBerry Window had a hand in a few songs too, collaborating with Vandroogenbroeck and Bryer on “Rock Locomotion”, which was paired with Vandroogenbroeck and Bryer’s “I Wanna Get Moving out of Here” for a single, and the sublime, jazzy number “Stay as You Are”.\n\nVandroogenbroeck also came up with two gems on his own: the Hammond drenched soul outing, “Funky for Now” and the majestic “Solitude Street”, which saw the Belgian step away from the keys and demonstrate his mastery of the sitar.\n\nIn fact, his use of the Indian stringed instrument on several tracks created a unique psych-soul blend to the LP. The front cover shows him sitting on the floor with sitar in hand and Window standing over him.\n\nTwo non-LP tracks further demonstrate Vandroogenbroeck’s skills on the instrument, the hypnotic “I’ll Wait for You” and the driving, infectious “Hear Me, Help Me” again penned by Vandroogenbroeck and Bryer. Coupled as a single in the latter half of 1968, they are, as far as this writer is concerned, the band’s creative peak.\n\nLike the group’s previous Intercord single release which paired two more non-LP Vandroogenbroeck and Bryer collaborations – “Remember The Rain” and “It Happened Once Before”, the recordings failed to achieve the commercial success the band deserved.\n\nUndeterred by the public’s reaction to their excellent LP and cache of superb singles, Berry Window & The Movements continued to gig across southern Germany, Switzerland and also northern Italy. The highlight of this period was perhaps a 40-minute TV show that West German station ARD recorded in Baden-Baden in September 1968.\n\nAs 1968 turned to 1969, Wolfgang Paap bowed out (subsequently to reunite with Vandroogenbroeck and Bryer) and new drummer Marc Hellman stepped behind the kit. Barney Wilen also departed to record the brilliant Dear Prof. Leary LP.\n\nAt this point, Window expanded the horn section bringing in two Caribbean musicians – Roy Edwards (trumpet) and Rudy Jones (sax) for some fresh recordings at SAAR Studios in Milan, Italy.\n\nAccording to Window, a friend of his was on holiday in Spain at the time and had seen the two horn players at a club in Playa de Aro called the Maddox backing singer Eddie Lee Mattison and had alerted Window, who was on the look-out for a brass section.\n\nFour tracks were recorded in early 1969 – English and Italian versions of Doug Sahm’s “Mendocino” and Alan Bergman, Marilyn Keith and Norman Luboff’s “Yellow Bird”, which were released in quick succession on the Italian Joker Dischi label.\n\nBy then, The Movements were on their last legs. With the end in sight, Bryer and Vandroogenbroeck pieced together a new, far more experimental band, The Third Eclipse, which soon became better known as Brainticket. The pair was reunited with Wolfgang Paap who joined the group’s most famous line-up and appears alongside the duo on the classic Cottonwoodhill LP.\n\nThe Belgian would continue to lead Brainticket for decades but Bryer soon returned to England where he subsequently reunited with former Loose Ends singer Alan Marshall in his band One. Sadly he died prematurely of an accidental drug overdose on 25 June 1973.\n\nWith a restructured band featuring Roy Edwards and Rudy Jones, Berry Window changed his name to Barry and took the revamped line-up to London where, as The London Cats, they recorded two tracks for Baf Records – David Porter and Isaac Hayes “I Thank You” and Roger Penzabene, Norman Whitefield and Barrett Strong’s “End of Our Road”, which were coupled for a British-only single.\n\nThat might have been the end of Berry Window & The Movements but that same year, RCA Records combined a recent recording that the singer had cut with Italian studio musicians, a cover of Herbert Pagani and Adriano De Grandis’ “Preistoria, Preistoria” with a second (and arguably superior) version of the classic “I’ll Wait For You”, cut in 1968 when Vandroogenbroeck and Bryer were still members.\n\nWith Edwards and Jones remaining in the UK to join JJ Jackson’s band, Window returned to Switzerland and embarked on an illustrious solo career which he continues to this day.\n\nFortunately, anyone who wants to check out the band’s excellent legacy can hear the group’s entire work (minus Soul Hour) on the Early Years double CD.\n\nThanks to Rolf ‘Ray’ Rieben of Feathered Apple Records and Barry Window for their help\n\nCopyright © Nick Warburton.

The quintet’s music bridged psychedelia and progressive rock with hints of soul/R&B and both releases were notable for their top notch production and the superlative musicianship of its players.\n\nTrinidad-born singer Kenny Bernard had first come to prominence with R&B outfit The Wranglers during 1963. Formed around the Lewisham area, the previous year, the group subsequently recorded a lone single for the Pye label, “The Tracker”, which was released in August 1965. Around the same time, the musicians were captured live at the Ad Lib Club in Leicester Square for a rare acetate that years later found its way into the hands of Mark Lamarr. The DJ passed the live tracks to the Acid Jazz label, which released the recordings as the Kenny Bernard & The Wranglers Live ’65 CD in 2011.\n\nWhen The Wranglers splintered a few months later, Bernard stayed with Pye Records and recorded a cache of stylish R&B/soul-inspired singles during 1966 and 1967, none of which troubled the charts. However, as Bernard noted in his autobiography, You Came Into My Life, he found going solo a daunting experience and missed working with a band on stage.\n\nOne night (the most plausible date is sometime in June 1967), the singer was out at the Scotch of St James nightclub in Mayfair with his old friend Pete Gage, former guitarist in Geno Washington & The Ram Jam Band, when he heard that South London group, The Loose Ends, were looking for a singer to front the band.\n\nOriginally from Bexley Heath in Kent, The Loose Ends had cut a couple of singles for Decca Records with singer Alan Marshall at the helm before undergoing a major overhaul in October 1966, which left the singer with the name. Marshall’s manager Bryan Mason then linked him with Croydon outfit, The Subjects, who featured guitarist Alan Griffin, keyboard player Phil Lanzon and drummer Roy Manderson.\n\nOver the next few months, The Loose Ends’ manager also started to bring in musicians from Bexley band, Bob ‘N’ All to replace outgoing musicians. These included new bass player Colin Pullen and second singer Bob Saker. However, shortly before taking up a residency at the Bang Bang Club in Milan in mid-January 1967, first Roy Manderson and then Alan Griffin dropped out to make way for new recruits. Both, however, kept in touch with Phil Lanzon.\n\nFast forward to early March and The Loose Ends were back in London, and with Alan Griffin back in the fold, the group performed at the Scotch of St James and the Speakeasy. Shortly after a gig at the Central London Polytechnic on 15 April, where they opened for The Savoy Brown Blues Band, singers Alan Marshall and Bob Saker took up soul legend Otis Redding’s offer to fly to the US to record at Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals.\n\nLeft without their two front men, The Loose Ends, who’d brought Roy Manderson back on board after his replacement Tony Glyde had left to join first The Fenmen and then Simon K & The Meantimers, put out feelers for another singer. With Marshall and Saker out of the picture, the musicians also decided to revamp themselves as Cats Pyjamas.\n\nAfter spending a month or so working up a stage set with Kenny Bernard, Colin Pullen recalls that the group’s debut gig took place at a college in Epsom, Surrey, which quite possibly could have been nearby Ewell Technical College Refectory, a popular local venue for up and coming bands to perform at.\n\nOver the next few months, Cats Pyjamas gigged fairly incessantly, and one of the band’s most notable gigs during this period was an appearance at the Starlight Room at Boston Gliderdrome in September with The Original Drifters. Pullen also recalls playing in Bournemouth’s Winter Gardens during the first few months of the group’s existence.\n\nHowever, in early December, Cats Pyjamas secured a crucial deal with the Rik Gunnell Agency, which most likely was brokered by their manager Pete Gage, who’d co-written one of the band’s standout songs, “Virginia Water” with Kenny Bernard and had previous dealings with the agency during his time with The Ram Jam Band.\n\nSelected gigs:\n\nAccording to the Reading Evening Post, 12 August, Kenny Bernard plays at the Bag O’Nails around this time (and this would be with Cats Pyjamas).\n\n13 August 1967 – Starlight Ballroom, Crawley, West Sussex with The Geranium Pond (Crawley Advertiser)\n\n30 September 1967 – Starlight Room, Boston Gliderdrome, Boston, Lincolnshire with Original Drifters and The Magic Roundabout (Lincolnshire Standard)\n\n7 October 1967 – Clouds, Derby (Derby Evening Telegraph)\n\n22 October 1967 – Elm Hotel, Southend, Essex (Southend Standard)\n\n4 November 1967 – The Place, Hanley, Staffordshire with Scots of St James (Evening Sentinel)\n\n11 November 1967 – Cesar’s Club, Bedford, Bedfordshire with Geranium Pond (Bedfordshire Times)\n\n2 December 1967 – Cliff’s Pavilion, Southend, Essex with John Walker and The Timebox and The Seychells (Southend Standard)\n\n2 December 1967 – Luton Boys Club, Luton, Bedfordshire with Tramline (Evening Post: Hemel Hempstead)\n\n8 December 1967 – The Place, Hanley, Staffordshire with The Wafer Board (Evening Sentinel)\n\nThe link-up with the Rik Gunnell Agency brought in steady stream of live work and importantly gave the band a regular spot to shine at the agency’s top Soho club, the Bag O’Nails on Kingley Street. It also led to a recording deal with the Direction label and, that same month, the musicians recorded a superb version of Jeff Barry, Ellie Greenwich and Phil Spector’s “Baby, I Love You”, originally a top 30 US hit for The Ronettes in 1963, at Olympic Studio’s in Barnes.\n\nTo this listener’s ears, however, it is the flip, the Pete Gage/Kenny Bernard penned “Virginia Water” that is the more impressive recording. A psych/prog-rock masterpiece, the song, named after the Surrey commuter town, benefits greatly from Mervyn Conn’s excellent production and demonstrates the inventiveness of a band that is only a few months old.\n\nAlan Griffin sets the scene with a sizzling “nosediving” guitar effect, which is soon buried in the rhythm section’s intricate, syncopated bass and percussion lines. The action then cuts back to the guitarist, who interjects with a series of strident riffs, signalling the arrival of Phil Lanzon’s majestic, prog-rock Hammond fills. As the brooding atmosphere threatens to spill over, Kenny Bernard joins the fray with his distinctive, powerful and soulful lead vocals.\n\nThe single, when released on 26 January 1968, should have been a massive hit, but instead sank without a trace. Perhaps “Virginia Water” would have fared better had it been promoted as the A-side but then again the band’s unique style, marrying psych-progressive rock with soul influences was probably far too inventive and dare I say it, “ahead of its time” to meet the narrow demands of the pop charts. Needless to say, breaking into top echelons of the charts was practically an impossibility anyway given The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and others’ virtual stranglehold.\n\nInterestingly, “Virginia Water” caught the attention of Scottish progressive-rock band, Writing on The Wall, who later recorded the track under an “unknown” title for their Power of The Picts LP.\n\nSelected gigs:\n\n15 December 1967 – Sibyllas, Swallow Street, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n16 December 1967 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n18 December 1967 – Kettering Working Men’s Club, Kettering, Northamptonshire (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings/Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph)\n\n19 December 1967 – Pantiles, Bagshot, Surrey (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n22 December 1967 – Roaring 20’s, Carnaby Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n23 December 1967 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n24 December 1967 – Beachcomber, Nottingham (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n26 December 1967 – Pantiles, Bagshot, Surrey (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n28 December 1967 – Klooks Kleek, West Hampstead, north London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n29-30 December 1967 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n31 December 1967 – Rasputin’s, New Bond Street, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n2 January 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n5 January 1968 – “Big C”, 1 Camp Road, Farnborough, Hampshire (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n6 January 1968 – Cliff’s Pavilion, Southend (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n9 January 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n11-12 January 1968 – Sibyllas, Swallow Street, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n13 January 1968 – Marquee, Wardour Street, Soho, central London with The Gods (Tony Bacon’s Book: London Live)\n\n13-14 January 1968 – Il Grotto, Ilford, Essex (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings/Redbridge & Ilford Recorder)\n\n15 January 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n17 January 1968 – Sibyllas, Swallow Street, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n19 January 1968 – Pantiles, Bagshot, Surrey (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n20 January 1968 – Margon’s College, King’s Road, Chelsea, southwest London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n21 January 1968 – Alex’s Disco, Salisbury, Wiltshire (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings/Salisbury Journal)\n\n25-26 January 1968 – Sibyllas, Swallow Street, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n27 January 1968 – Holborn College of Law, Red Lion Square, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n28 January 1968 – Kettering Working Men’s Club, Kettering, Northamptonshire with Deuce Coupe (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n29 January 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n1 February 1968 – RAF Wyton, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n2 February 1968 – Sibyllas, Swallow Street, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n3 February 1968 – Luton Boys Club, Luton, Bedfordshire (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n5 February 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n9-10 February 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n10 February 1968 – Cliffs Pavilion, Southend, Essex with The Merseys and North Sea Bubble (Southend Standard)\n\n13-15 February 1968 – Rasputin’s, New Bond Street, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n16 February 1968 – Pantiles, Bagshot, Surrey (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n17 February 1968 – Cliffs Pavilion, Southend, Essex with Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n18 February 1968 – Carlton Club, Erdington, West Midlands with The Amboy Dukes (Birmingham Evening Mail/Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n20 February 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n23 February 1968 – Boat 27, Sibyllas, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n24 February 1968 – Ceasar’s, Bedford, Bedfordshire (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n28 February 1968 – Rasputin’s, New Bond Street, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n2 March 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n3 March 1968 – Beachcomber, Nottingham (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\nUndeterred by the chart failure of their debut 45, Cats Pyjamas returned to Olympic Studios in Barnes with Mervyn Conn to record a follow up release. According to Rik Gunnell’s agency bookings, the group spent two days recording (4 and 5 March).\n\nColin Pullen remembers that The Steve Miller Band were recording tracks for Children of The Future in the studio next door and when Cats Pyjamas had finished their session they watched the San Francisco group at work.\n\nDuring the sessions, Cats Pyjamas recorded two new Kenny Bernard songs, “Camera Man” and “Houses”. Bernard would revisit the pedestrian “Houses” in later years and but here the rest of the band give the song a semi-acoustic treatment complete with progressive organ fills. To this listener’s ears, the track wouldn’t sound out of place on The Small Faces’ Autumn Stone or Family’s Music From a Doll’s House. Far better is the raving Mod/prog cross-over “Camera Man” with its infectious chorus and stomping, driving beat.\n\nLike “Virginia Water”, “Camera Man” demonstrates just how innovative Cats Pyjamas could be in the studio; unfortunately the group’s second outing would follow its predecessor into obscurity. The tragedy is that the group never got the opportunity to cut more material towards an LP.\n\nSelected gigs:\n\n7 March 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n8 March 1968 – Meridan Youth Club, Royston, Hertfordshire (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n9 March 1968 – Locarno, Swindon, Wiltshire (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n11-12 March 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n16 March 1968 – Gaiety Ballroom, Ramsey, Cambridgeshire with The Friction (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings/Cambridgeshire Times)\n\n17 March 1968 – King Alfred, Bellingham, southeast London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n20 March 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n23 March 1968 – Central School of Art, Southampton Row, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n24 March 1968 – Foseco Sports & Social Club, Drayton Manor, Tamworth, Staffordshire (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n25-27 March 1968 – Rasputin’s, New Bond Street, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n25-27 March 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n29 March 1968 – Pantiles, Bagshot, Surrey (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n30 March 1968 – Twickenham College, Twickenham, west London with Mystie Romance (Melody Maker)\n\n3 April 1968 – Cue Club, Paddington, central London (Melody Maker)\n\n5 April 1968 – Ministry of Health, Alexander Fleming House, Elephant & Castle, London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n6 April 1968 – Stax Club, Cirencester, Gloucestershire with The Purple Barrier (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n7 April 1968 – Bull’s Head, Yardley, West Midlands (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n9 April 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n11 April 1968 – Cue Club, Paddington, central London (Melody Maker)\n\n13 April 1968 – White Tiles Disco, Swindon, Wiltshire (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n14-15 April 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n19-20 April 1968 – Rasputin’s, New Bond Street, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n21 April 1968 – Tower Ballroom, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings/Yarmouth Mercury)\n\n25 April 1968 – Station Hotel, Selly Oak, West Midlands (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings/Birmingham Evening Mail)\n\n26 April 1968 – Bolero Club, Wednesbury, West Midlands (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n27 April 1968 – Adelphi Ballroom, West Bromwich, West Midlands with The Happiness (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings/Express & Star)\n\n27 April 1968 – Elbow Room, Aston, West Midlands (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings/Birmingham Evening Mail)\n\n28 April 1968 – Carlton Ballroom, Erdington, West Midlands (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n29 April-3 May 1968 – Rasputin’s, New Bond Street, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n4 May 1968 – Brave New World, Eastney, Hampshire (Website: http://michaelcooper.org.uk/C/birdcage.htm)\n\n9-10 May 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n11 May 1968 – Cue Club, Paddington, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n12 May 1968 – Bull’s Head, Yardley, West Midlands (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n13 May 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n17 May 1968 – Rasputin’s, New Bond Street, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n18 May 1968 – Dandylion Club, Cross Hands Inn, Brockworth, Gloucestershire (Gloucester Citizen/Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n20 May 1968 – Yeoman, Stafford, Staffordshire (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n21-22 May 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n24 May 1968 – Rasputin’s, New Bond Street, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\n30-31 May 1968 – Bag O’Nails, Kingley Street, Soho, central London (Rik Gunnell Agency bookings)\n\nReleased on 24 May 1968, “Camera Man” c/w “Houses” was another creative step forward but all was not well within the band.

and following some final gigs for Rik Gunnell in mid-November, the singer parted ways to resume a solo career.\n\nCats Pyjamas stuck together a bit longer but sometime in 1969 Colin Pullen left. Around November of that year, remaining members Alan Griffin, Phil Lanzon and Roy Manderson joined Geno Washington and worked as his Ram Jam Band until the spring of 1970. Griffin remained with the singer when he put together a new version that year.\n\nPhil Lanzon, however, maintained the greatest profile over the succeeding years, later working with Grand Prix, Chris Spedding and Sweet among others before joining Uriah Heep in 1986 with whom he continues to play.\n\nHuge thanks to Colin Pullen (who kindly shared the Rik Gunnell Agency booking list), Alan Griffin and Phil Lanzon for providing information about the band.\n\nCopyright © Nick Warburton.
