        "text": "This blog aims to post albums that currently don't exist in the mainstream, but which I think should. They will be albums rejected and shelved by record companies, collections of rare tracks and b-sides, or theme-based compilations of an artist. There will also be imagined albums which could have been recorded in an alternative universe. Hope you enjoy these albums that I wish existed.\n\nNO MUSIC IS STORED ON THIS SITE.\n\nTO LISTEN, EMAIL ME AT aiwe2@yahoo.com.\n\nMusic is also stored on SoulseekQT, which can be downloaded here: http://www.soulseekqt.net/news/node/1 , or if that doesn’t work then SoulseekNS can be downloaded here: https://soulseek.en.softonic.com/download\n\nSearch ‘band name aiwe’ (e.g. dylan aiwe) for my albums. If that doesn't work I'll give a search hint at the end of the post.\n\nFor full instructions on Soulseek, or if it doesn't work for you then drop me an email at aiwe2@yahoo.com. If you want to burn these albums to CD then PowerPopTom has kindly put together some covers for them. Email me for a download link.\n\nColourisations are done with palette.fm"
