        "text": "Image used to solely illustrate subject for an album review, and consistent with Fair Use Doctrine\n\nRoger Daltrey’s sophomore solo album, Ride a Rock Horse, was recorded from November 1974–February 1975, during the filming of the absolutely bizarre Ken Russell film Lisztomania, which makes zero attempt at historical accuracy or even reality. (Was Mr. Russell permanently high during the Seventies or what?!)\n\nThe album was released 4 July 1975, three months ahead of Lisztomania. Roger’s cousin Graham Hughes once again designed and photographed the cover. Is it really that much of a stretch to imagine Roger as a randy centaur?!\n\nWhereas Lisztomania flopped (despite a few good critical reviews) and its soundtrack only charted at #85 in Australia and #145 in the U.S., Ride a Rock Horse was a brilliant success. Its highest position was #10 in Australia, and it was also popular in the U.K. (#14), the U.S. (#28), and Canada (#46). In the U.K., it was certified silver.\n\nOnce again, Roger didn’t contribute any songs to the album. He’s written and co-written some songs here and there over the years, both for himself and The Who, but that’s just never been his strong suit or something he’s chosen to focus on developing. Roger is first and foremost a vocalist.\n\nGerald Scarfe made a trippy animated music video for “Hearts Right.”\n\nTrack listing:\n\n“(Come and) Get Your Love” (written by Russ Ballard) (#46 in Australia; #68 in the U.S.)\n\n“Hearts Right” (Paul Korda)\n\n“Oceans Away” (Phillip Goodhand-Tait) (released as a single but inexplicably failed to chart)\n\n“Proud” (Russ Ballard)\n\n“World Over” (Paul Korda)\n\n“Near to Surrender” (Russ Ballard)\n\n“Feeling” (Paul Korda)\n\n“Walking the Dog” (Rufus Thomas) (#52 in the U.K.; #77 in Australia)\n\n“Milk Train” (Dominic Bugatti and Frank Musker)\n\n“I Was Born to Sing Your Song” (Chris Neal and Donny Marchand)\n\nMy favourite tracks are “Oceans Away” (so beautiful and romantic!), “(Come and) Get Your Love,” and “Feeling.”\n\nRoger is in top vocal form on this album, and it’s a really fun listen, but I personally wouldn’t recommend it as an ideal first solo album of his. My feeling has always been that the material isn’t consistently strong or in enough of a cohesive style to elevate it into a 5-star listening experience."
