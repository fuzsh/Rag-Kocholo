        "text": "GT\n\n14.11.2011 08:57 After much research I have found a previously unknown album by artist Phillip Goodhand-Tait that Roger Taylor contributed percussion to.\n\nReleased in 1973, this was Phillip's 4th album and was produced by Robin Cable and recorded at Trident Studios in St. Anne's Court, Soho, London.\n\nThe catalogue number is DJLPS 432 and was released on LP in a textured gatefold sleeve.\n\nPhillip: \"The recordings at Trident were made over a long period of time with many,\n\nuncredited, brilliant session musicians and it would have been on the\n\nalbum (\"Phillip Goodhand-Tait\") that Robin Cable produced. We now plan to\n\nrelease that album on CD later this year (hopefully in time for Christmas).\n\nRobin Cable produced only the one album for me, plus a\n\nlater single. His productions were meticulous and excellent, as were all\n\nthose coming from the 'team' of producers (Gus Dudgeon, Perry etc) who\n\nworked at Trident\".\n\nYou can go to link if you want to find out more about this artist. GT\n\n16.11.2011 11:04 A few people have asked me if I can give them the track listing for the album, so here they are:\n\nSide 1)\n\nFive Flight Walk Up\n\nI think I Can Believe\n\nOne More Rodeo\n\nTeenage Canteen\n\nForever Kind Of Love\n\nSide 2)\n\nYou Are\n\nEmile\n\nReach Out For Each Other\n\nSugar Train\n\nWarm Summer Rain\n\nAnd also if I know what songs Roger played on. I don't know this as it was an uncredited session, but would be interesting to see if anyone can tell which ones contain Roger's involvement."
