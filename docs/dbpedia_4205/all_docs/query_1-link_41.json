        "text": "In August 1965, an obscure R&B outfit named Hamilton & The Hamilton Movement signalled its arrival on the London scene with an impressive rendition of The Velvelettes’ Motown classic “Really Saying Something” (later a sizeable UK hit for Bananarama) and then seemingly vanished off the face of the earth.\n\nThen, almost two years later, a band calling itself Hamilton & The Movement descended on the airwaves with the infectious soul-rocker, “I’m Not the Marrying Kind”, a Bill Wyman penned and produced number, infused with punchy horn lines, funky drums and some groovy Hammond organ fills. Could this really be the same band and, if so, why such a long radio silence?\n\nThe answer to that question is both a yes and a no. While both outfits were fronted by a singer called Gary Hamilton, they were in fact two entirely different groups, albeit each with fascinating histories. To understand how these two bands became entwined, it’s important to go back to the early Sixties and the man who kick-started ‘the movement’, so to speak – Gary Hamilton.\n\nThe son of an English mother and American father, Gary Hamilton was in fact a certain Gary Laub, who grew up in London’s Marble Arch and St John’s Wood areas.\n\nIn 1962, Laub formed his first (unnamed) group with a school friend and lead guitarist named Graham who lived opposite Lords cricket ground. Soon after, they were joined by bass player Chris Palmer, rhythm guitarist Ian Hunt and (finally) drummer Fedon Tilberis, who all attended Haverstock School.\n\n“How Chris and Ian met Gary I don’t know,” says Tilberis. “I joined a little later but Graham was still in the band and left soon after. We enlisted a replacement lead guitarist named Mike Allen and emerged as a five-piece named The Moondogs. The name was [Gary’s father] Mr Laub’s idea before we auditioned at the famous Two Is coffee bar.”\n\nFast forward to spring 1965 and Laub, Palmer and Tilberis had to reshuffle the pack when Allen and Hunt moved on. Through a friend of Tilberis, they were introduced to two older guitarists – Costas and Bernie – and started gigging as Cell Block 5.\n\n“Costas was an ex-pro who had played US bases in Germany; he was a men’s tailor by trade. Bernie was from Rochdale. They were then in their late Twenties,” remembers Tilberis.\n\n“We practised in the cellar of a scrap shop in south London that they knew. They did a three-nighter with us in a Greek Street cellar club called Les Cousins that I hustled but Bernie, not feeling very happy, left on the last night after the gig. Costas stayed on for a London suburb gig. They were only with us for about seven or eight weeks.”\n\nCoining a new name, The Reaction, Tilberis hit the jackpot when he stumbled across Rayrik Studio owners Rick Minas and Bruce Rea, who offered up their Chalk Farm studio as a practice room. In return, the outfit would play free on any demo recording sessions when required.\n\n“As it turned out, this was a great deal for us as we never had to record anything there other than our audition to clinch the agreement and practised for free,” continues the drummer.\n\nAbetted by guitar legend Mick Green, The Reaction duly auditioned and Minas was bowled over by the performance.\n\n“Chris and I had auditioned Mick at Chris’ place in Kilburn shortly before the Rayrik audition and we were both very impressed,” remembers Tilberis.\n\n“Although Mick didn’t commit himself, he was interested in doing the Rayrik session, maybe hoping for some recording session gigs. I can’t remember what the number was that we recorded or if Gary was even there, but do remember listening to the backing take after and Mick’s comment. He said that it was a good clean recording and that you could build on it. Rick and Bruce agreed.”\n\nHowever, when Mick Green opted to return to The Dakotas, with whom he had been playing with after leaving Johnny Kidd & The Pirates the previous year, Peter Vernon-Kell, a member of Goldhawk Social Club and Ealing Club regulars, The Macabre assumed guitar duties. Incidentally, Vernon-Kell had also been a brief member of The Detours, a forerunner of The Who.\n\n“Both Mick Green and Peter Vernon-Kell came to us via a [Melody Maker] ad in that order. We did see other guitarists but finally settled for Peter after Mick moved on to greener pastures [excuse the pun],” explains Tilberis.\n\n“Peter shared our new musical orientation and attitude, and as far as we were concerned, he fitted the bill. I then arranged our first practice at Rayrik.”\n\nPrior to Vernon-Kell’s addition to the group’s ranks, Minas and Rea had introduced impresario Robert Stigwood, and the Australian subsequently offered Gary Laub a recording deal and put the band on his agency books.\n\nStigwood insisted that “Really Saying Something” should be the ‘A’ side while Rick Minas and his song-writing partner Mike Banwell offered up “I Won’t See You Tonight” for the flipside.\n\nBefore cutting both tracks at a demo session at Regent Sound in Denmark Street, Vernon-Kell coined a new name; The Reaction sounding too similar to The Action, The Who’s regular Tuesday night opener at the Marquee.\n\n“He came up with The Hamilton Movement [in honour of Macabre guitarist Ed Hamilton] in the pub before the session [and] we thought it was great,” remembers Tilberis, who adds that Gary Laub, although at first not so keen, adopted ‘Hamilton’ as a stage name.\n\nHaving booked Olympic Sound (then situated in Baker Street) for the final recordings (and unbeknownst to the musicians), Stigwood augmented the band with Graham Bond on piano.\n\n“We were aware who Graham was and were pleased to have him on board for the session,” says Tilberis.\n\nAccording to the drummer, the tracks required only a few takes per playback and for the lead/backing vocals. Released in August 1965, the single entered the Radio Caroline charts at number 65 on 23 October and peaked at number 53 the following week.\n\nHowever, the musicians soon realised that any talk of ‘band democracy’ was just that. Not only did the single list the outfit as Hamilton & The Hamilton Movement but Stigwood started promoting them as such.\n\n“Only Gary was allowed to perform on Ready Steady Go using our playback, though we were allowed to attend the show,” explains Tilberis.\n\nInterestingly, as future Hamilton Movement member Mel Wayne recalls, Stigwood insisted on the same conditions with another of his charges, The All-Nite Workers, who were backing Indian singer Simon Scott around the same time.\n\n“Simon mimed to our backing track [on Ready Steady Go] while we had to stand on the balcony with the audience,” says the sax player. “It must have been a Stigwood thing.”\n\nAired on 22 October 1965, Gary Hamilton appeared on the popular British TV show alongside The Animals, The Searchers, Chris Farlowe & The Thunderbirds and The Rolling Stones, which may have been where the singer linked up with Bill Wyman.\n\nBy then, the group had started to pick up consistent live work, kicking off with a memorable gig at Sophia Gardens Pavilion in Cardiff on 30 August with The Who, The Graham Bond Organisation, The Merseybeats and The Easybeats (not the Australian outfit), which had been arranged by the Stigwood/Lambert-Stamp team.\n\n“It looked like a sports hall with an enormous stage at one end. We went up the day before and slept in the van and hung about till early next afternoon to unload our gear,” says Tilberis.\n\n“Townsend was also there early and limbering up in The Who’s dressing room. As our Pete knew him, he went to say ‘allo’ and introduce his new mates… [Townsend] asked Pete if he could borrow his Fender amp for the gig. Pete was more than wary, after all he didn’t want his amp wrecked so Townsend promised to only demolish his Marshall gear.\n\n“Keith Moon and Tony Banks, drummer of The Merseybeats, were looning around and generally getting on everybody’s nerves, especially Entwistle’s as Moon had donned his bass and was running up and down the stage strumming it like a maniac. I thought John was going to thump him.”\n\nMore provincial gigs followed, not to mention the obligatory Mod clubs in London, including the El Partido in Lewisham where the outfit played alongside The Duke Lee Sounds on 30 October 1965.\n\nHowever, in mid-late January 1966, the Stigwood/Lambert & Stamp team secured a spot for the band on a three-day, two shows a day package tour, once again opening for Vernon-Kell’s former band mates, The Who, and also featuring Screaming Lord Sutch & The Savages, The Graham Bond Organisation, The Merseybeats and The Fortunes.\n\n“Bob [Stigwood] arranged for us to practise at the Granada TV rehearsal studios at the Oval about a week beforehand,” remembers Tilberis. “He and Lambert came to oversee the rep and offer presentation tips for our opening spot on the show.”\n\nThe tour debut duly took place at the Astoria Cinema, Finsbury Park on 4 February and was followed by a gig at the Odeon Cinema, Southend-on-Sea the next day, culminating with a final engagement on 6 February at the Empire Theatre, Liverpool.\n\nThe following month, on 11-12 March, the musicians found themselves on the campus of Essex University in Colchester where a number of bands, including the up and coming Pink Floyd were entertaining the students.\n\nThen in April, Stigwood linked up with Chris Blackwell to promote a second package tour headlined by The Who, this time with Hamilton and The Hamilton Movement joining the likes of The Spencer Davis Group, The Band of Angels and (most notably) Jimmy Cliff & The Sound System (aka New Generation) (who featured musicians that would form part of the soon-to-be Hamilton Movement).\n\nThe four-day tour, with two shows a day, kicked off at the Gaumont Theatre in Southampton on 14 April. After weaving its way on to Fairfield Halls in Croydon, then the Odeon in Watford, the tour wound up at the Regal Theatre in Edmonton.\n\n“Gary’s mum called me on Saturday, 16 April in the afternoon asking if we would do the Watford gig that evening,” says the drummer. “Although we all had other plans I rounded up Pete and Chris and we did that gig.”\n\nStigwood then proposed a second single and once again engaged Graham Bond on piano. The sessions included a stab at The Who’s “A Legal Matter” as the ‘B’ side, which was cut as an instrumental track. However, the recording of the ‘A’ side did not go well, as Tilberis recalls.\n\n“We weren’t raving about the number. Stigwood arranged a practice room and gave us a single to learn but I can’t remember what it was called. I had a trouble with the drum part on the session.\n\n“Bob was well peeved but let us play one of our tunes that we were working on, but there was no melody line or title at that stage and he didn’t like it. The Olympic session was a blow out and Bob gave us the thumbs down, we were out and the gig flow stopped.”\n\nAs Tilberis points out, there was still no signed contract, and the singer was looking out for himself. “Gary’s dad [Harry] being a shrewd businessman and used to dealing with contracts and small print had deleted a hefty portion of the contract!”\n\nChris Palmer and Fedon Tilberis soon left for Jimmy & The Rackets, a British beat group with hit parade successes in Germany, Switzerland and Austria.\n\nJoining long-standing frontman, Jimmy Duncombe and guitarist Mike Bell, Tilberis remained with the Swiss-based outfit until spring 1968 while Palmer stayed on for another year.\n\nThe pair appeared on a cache of European-only released singles by The Rackets, kicking off with a cover of Eddie Cochran’s “C’mon Everybody” backed by a cover version of George Harrison’s “I Want To Tell You”.\n\nThe pair ended up setting up home in Switzerland where, in 1970, The Chris Palmer Band recorded the ultra-rare solo LP Fingertips, featuring originals from all the band members.\n\nPalmer later hit pay day in 1980 when Surface Noise topped the UK dance music chart with a cover of his song, “The Scratch”. Tilberis re-joined The Rackets and played with local bands, including Swiss Sixties specialists, The Countdowns.\n\nVernon-Kell meanwhile subsequently moved into production. Setting up PVK Records, he managed Peter Green and produced a string of his late 1970s and early 1980s albums. More recently, he’s become an executive producer for films and currently runs Cabana Films Ltd.\n\nBut Gary Hamilton wasn’t finished with The Hamilton Movement. In late July/early August 1966, he linked up with Jimmy Cliff’s backing band, The New Generation, renaming them The Movement.\n\nBass player Ron Thomas, who years later struck fame with The Heavy Metal Kids, thinks the link-up came through The New Generation’s keyboard player Mick Fletcher.\n\n“[Mick] was always going down all the clubs around Wardour Street,” says the bass player. “He was always ducking and diving and I thought he just met him [Gary Hamilton] out there one night.”\n\n“Me and Mickie Fletcher were great mates and frequented The Ship in Wardour Street and drank with Gary there quite a bit,” confirms sax player Mel Wayne.\n\n“We were all a bit frustrated the way things were going with Jimmy Cliff because he didn’t have a soul or pop voice, which was the sort of music Chris Blackwell wanted him to do and engaged us for.”\n\nNew Generation members Ron Thomas and Mel Wayne, together with fellow sax player Dave Mahoney, had first come together in West London R&B outfit Mike Dee & The Prophets.\n\nAdding Thomas’s school friend Mick Stewart on guitar in mid-1965, they split from Mike Dee and worked as Anglo-Indian singer Simon Scott’s backing group, The All-Nite Workers. Their lone single together was produced by none other than Robert Stigwood!\n\nBy late 1965, former Paramounts drummer Phil Wainman had assumed leadership, and after cutting several singles with Errol Dixon and briefly backing Freddie Mack, Mick Stewart jumped ship to join Johnny Kidd & The ‘New’ Pirates.\n\nHaving previously introduced Mick Fletcher from The Epitaph Soul Band, guitarist Tony Sinclair (aka Tony St. Clair) completed the new formation, now gigging as The Sound System.\n\nThrough a chance meeting with Chris Blackwell, the sextet supported his roster of artists – Jackie Edwards, Millie, Owen Grey and most notably Jimmy Cliff. Trumpet player John Droy joined just before the Gary Hamilton pairing.\n\nThe expanded group began rehearsing at London’s Colony Club where Gary’s father was employed; US film star George Raft worked as its casino director and briefly financed the outfit. Mel Wayne adds that the group also rehearsed at Caesars Palace in Dunstable and Ken Collier’s London club.\n\nWhen John Droy bailed after a short nationwide tour with The Walker Brothers in mid-August to join The Quotations, The Movement expanded its line-up, bringing in trumpet players – Mike Bailey, Alan Ellis and Patrick Higgs, the latter from Elton John’s group, Bluesology around December. (Ed: One of the unsuccessful musicians to audition was trumpet player Verdi Stewart, who would be instrumental in landing Mel Wayne future work with Carl Douglas.)\n\n“We had a ten-piece band; a five-piece brass section; three trumpets. When I think of it now, we were all on a wage,” recalls Thomas.\n\nThat November, Gary Hamilton landed a recording deal with CBS and the musicians entered IBC Studios to work with Rolling Stone Bill Wyman in the producer’s chair.\n\n“That was something that [Gary’s father] Mr Laub put together. He said, ‘We’ve got a song for you’,” remembers Phil Wainman, who adds that the group nailed both sides in a couple of takes.\n\n“He [Bill Wyman] just let us get on with it. The band was so good. We’d rehearsed it prior to the studio and… in three hours I think we were done, recorded and mixed.”\n\n“I’m Not The Marrying Kind” c/w “My Love Belongs To You” was duly released on 10 February 1967 and hit single written all over it.\n\nHowever, despite having supported The Who at Leeds University on 21 January and then making a notable appearance at the Saville Theatre opening for Chuck Berry and Del Shannon on 19 February, the single’s commercial failure prompted the backers to drastically reduce the group’s bookings.\n\nPhil Wainman was the first to abandon ship for The Overlanders and then Jack Hammer, author of “Great Balls of Fire”.\n\nAfter co-penning The Yardbirds’ cover “Little Games” and working with The Quotations, Wainman became a top session player and then a successful producer with Sweet and Boomtown Rats, among his credits.\n\n“As a producer I did so much better than as a musician,” says Wainman. “That’s where I did well. I probably sold about 300 million records.”\n\nJames Smith, fresh from an audition with The New Pirates, reforming after Johnny Kidd’s death, assumed the drum stool.\n\n“I got a call from Ron Thomas,” remembers the newcomer. “He said Mick Stewart had given him my number and would I be interested in auditioning? I got the gig, though it was a hard act to follow. Phil was one of the best drummers around at the time.”\n\nSmith remembers the band finding plenty of work on the university circuit that spring, including Keele, Nottingham, Leeds and Birmingham.\n\nIn the first week of April, Melody Maker reported that the group had whittled down from a 10 piece to a seven piece. Mel Wayne left to join Carl Douglas & The Big Stampede and two other horn players also departed, most likely including Pat Higgs.\n\nOn 27 May, Hamilton & The Movement joined Cliff Bennett & The Rebel Rousers, The Action, The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band and The Swinging Blue Jeans to entertain the students at Oxford’s Hertford Balls.\n\nThe drummer also says that The Hamilton Movement opened for US soul act Sam and Bill several times (most notably at the Boston Gliderdrome on 15 July) before further changes ensued during August and October 1967.\n\n“The brass section dropped out and this kind of triggered a fairly rapid exodus… There were no gigs for a while so Tony, Mick and Ron found other work,” says the drummer.\n\nWhile Mick Fletcher failed to reunite with Mel Wayne in Carl Douglas & The Big Stampede (the job went to Rod Mayall), he next appears to have played with The Rifle (with guitarist Del Grace from Carl Douglas’ band and singer Malcolm Magaron) and then The Amboy Dukes in late 1969 for a short tour into mid-1970.\n\nTony Sinclair briefly played with Lace before joining Freddie Mack’s band in early 1968. The soul outfit split from the former boxer in 1969 and worked with Dave Hadfield at his studio on the Old Kent Road, providing backing tracks for various artists on Hadfield’s Revolution label.\n\nRon Thomas meanwhile got a job with guitarist Pip Williams’s band, The House of Orange, backing US soul act, The Fantastics.\n\n“They were right in the middle of a tour backing Garnet Mimms,” he recalls. “They were a house band working with Roy Tempest. They just phoned me up. Their bass player had got slung out in the middle of the tour and they had a gig that night.”\n\nWith ‘The Movement’ on hold, James Smith had also started to explore other avenues and even had an offer on the table when Gary Hamilton convinced him to hang on.\n\n“Gary came up with Mick Stewart and Tony Savva and said he wanted to change the style and format going with a three-piece backing band, so I decided to stay,” says the drummer.\n\nBass player Tony Savva was best known for his work with A Wild Uncertainty, the group that featured Eddie Hardin, who had replaced Stevie Winwood in The Spencer Davis Group that spring.\n\nSavva is uncertain how the link-up with Hamilton came about but has some photos with A Wild Uncertainty drummer Gordon Barton and lead guitarist Peter Tidmarsh in them, which offers a clue.\n\n“Gary and I were behind the camera,” he explains. “How and why I don’t know but obviously we were backing Gary as vocalist. Maybe Gordon and Peter split and Mick [Stewart] and Jimmy [Smith] came in.”\n\nMick Stewart, however, can throw more light on this transition period. “I believe that I played with Tony Savva for a little while because of something to do with Don Arden’s son David being a would-be-singer at the time,” says the guitarist.\n\n“The intro to that was in a way due to Johnny Kidd. Over the years, he was in fact booked quite a bit by Don Arden’s agency and after he died, I believe that someone at Arden’s company suggested I play guitar in this back-up band. Tony was already in the line-up. At the end of the day, however, David Arden although he was a really great guy to be in a rock ‘n’ roll band with, he was not really a singer at all.”\n\nWith the new version finding its feet, Gary Hamilton returned to the studios with session musicians to cut a solo single. Produced by Tony Meehan and penned by Mike D’Abo, “Let the Music Play”, backed by the self-penned “Don’t Ask”, was released by Decca on 12 November 1967 but flopped. A dramatic, big band production, “Let the Music Play” appears on Colour Me Pop, Volume Three and Fading Yellow Volume 9: The Other Side of Life.\n\nDuring early November 1967, Gary Hamilton expanded the line-up by bringing in organist Terry Goldberg, who had previously played with The Mark Leeman Five and would go onto Tintern Abbey.\n\nThe five-piece gigged prolifically over the next four months, even opening for Ike & Tina Turner and others at the Boston Gliderdrome on 20 April 1968. Two days later, the musicians played possibly their final show at the 100 Club on Oxford Street before the inevitable split.\n\nDuring 1968, Gary Hamilton recorded a one-track acetate “Carry The Can“, which was never released. The tracks were recorded with studio musicians and not the final version of The Hamilton Movement.\n\nMick Stewart immediately joined James Royal and participated in a prestigious concert tour alongside Johnny Cash, June Carter and Carl Perkins. During 1969-1970, he recorded three singles with Sweet before later moving to the United States in the late 1970s, where he works in Los Angeles and Nashville as a successful record producer and also owns a music publishing company and a recording studio.\n\nTony Savva meanwhile subsequently worked with Lionel Bart and Samuel Prody among others and currently lives in Cyprus. James Smith, who later recorded with Aquila, played with a revamped Nashville Teens before reuniting with Ron Thomas in The House of Orange.\n\n“[Ron] said The Fantastics were coming back to the UK for a tour and he and Pip Williams were getting a backing band together and looking for a drummer and organist. I’d seen Ron and Pip previously so I didn’t need asking twice.”\n\nAs for Gary Hamilton, he joined the London production of Hair before resuming his solo career with a lone single for CBS and gigging briefly with Cozy Powell’s band, Big Bertha. Produced by Bernard Lee, the self-penned “Easy Rider” stalled when it was released on 5 December 1969.\n\nUndeterred, he returned to Polydor for a cover of Ed Welch’s the “Monkey Song”, produced by Peter Knight Jr and arranged by John Fiddy. Released on 20 November 1970, the single flopped and Hamilton moved into movie acting; the eagle-eyed can catch him in the cult horror flick, Tower of Evil.\n\nThanks to Fedon Tilberis, Peter Vernon-Kell, Chris Palmer, Ron Thomas, Phil Wainman, Mel Wayne, James Smith, Mick Stewart and Tony Savva\n\nTo add information and make corrections, email: Warchive@aol.com\n\nA version of this article appears in Ugly Things magazine.\n\nCopyright © Nick Warburton.

The list below is a start but I’d welcome any additions and corrections plus any photos of the venue/posters of advertised gigs/photos of bands who appeared there (all credited accordingly).\n\nThis exclusive Mayfair establishment was primarily a late night members club with gambling but did put on live music occasionally (see The Stormsville Shakers gigs immediately below). It was officially opened as a late night club offering regular live music from 14 July 1965.\n\n1965\n\nDrummer Tony Richard says that his band The Fetish Crowd played at the Scotch of St James, which would have been the 1965-1966 period.\n\nSinger James Nairn (aka James Royal) notes that his bands James Royal & The Hawks and The James Royal Set both performed at the club.\n\n7 May (Friday) – The Stormsville Shakers (website: http://www.stormsvilleshakers.com/bandhistory.html)\n\nPhillip Goodhand-Tait kept diaries from 1961 onward and notes that his band The Stormsville Shakers were paid to play the Scotch on the above date. They arrived at 7.30pm and finished at 2am on the Saturday morning after playing three spots of 35 minutes. They were re-booked at the Scotch for the two dates below.\n\n14 May (Friday) – The Stormsville Shakers (website: http://www.stormsvilleshakers.com/bandhistory.html)\n\n15 May (Saturday) – The Stormsville Shakers (website: http://www.stormsvilleshakers.com/bandhistory.html)\n\nAccording to London Life magazine’s 9-15 October issue, The Marionettes were the resident band during this week.

This is where Otis Redding picked up singers Alan Marshall and Bob Saker and took them back to the US to record tracks at Fame Studios during June.\n\n23 April (Sunday) – The Wages of Sin (Melody Maker)\n\n28 April (Friday) – Moon’s Train (Malcolm Penn’s gig diary – thanks to Peter Gosling for sharing)\n\nDrummer Phil Wainman, who went on to produce The Sweet, remembers playing the club in May 1967 with Jack Hammer & The Hammer Jammers.\n\nKeyboard player Mick Ketley says The Motivation/Penny Peeps played at the Scotch of St James on two occasions which would have been from May 1967 onwards.\n\n7 May (Sunday) – The Marshall Scott Etc (Hounslow Post)\n\nThe Loose Ends were performing at the Scotch of St James in early June 1967 when former Ram Jam guitarist Pete Gage brought singer Kenny Bernard into see the musicians. This led to the formation of Cats Pyjamas with some of the group members.\n\n16 June (Friday) – Vince Edwards (Del Paramor’s gig diary)\n\nThe Manchester Playboys performed at the Scotch of St James and July seems the most likely period as they were in London gigging. Also Peter Simensky, who had joined the band recently, was a member at the time and he recalls singer Billie Davis working at the Scotch at the time.\n\nFrank Torpey, who was lead guitarist with London band, The Tribe (and would go on to become the original lead guitarist in The Sweet), says that when the group was playing regular Saturday nights at the Marquee in Wardour Street between July-September, the Marquee’s owner John Gee would get a call from the Scotch of St James asking what band was on and would they like to double up? He says The Tribe always said yes as it was a great top up. Torpey adds that they never had another band on with them. He thinks they may have played at the Scotch maybe three or four times.\n\nIt sounds like The Tribe may have played the Scotch in the early hours of the Sunday morning after finishing up at the Marquee but this would need confirmation.\n\nThis insight is interesting as it might mean other groups that played the Marquee went on and played the Scotch of St James after finishing up.\n\n1 July (Saturday) – The Tribe (Tony Bacon’s book, London Live)\n\nThe Tribe (which changed name to The Dream in late August 1967) played at the Marquee every Saturday from 1 July to 30 September according to Tony Bacon’s excellent book on the London music scene and its Marquee listings, so it’s impossible to know what Saturday evenings/early Sunday mornings The Tribe went on to play at the Scotch of St James afterwards. It’s also quite possible that the other band sharing the billing at the Marquee with The Tribe may have been asked as well (see Torpey’s recollections above).\n\n7 July (Friday) – Vince Edwards (Fabulous 208)\n\n8 July (Saturday) – The Manchester Playboys (Graham Sclater’s diary)\n\n1 August (Tuesday) – The Manchester Playboys (Graham Sclater’s diary)\n\nTimebox played at the Scotch of St James during August 1967. They had a Tuesday night gig at the Marquee so possibly played afterwards. Former Felders Orioles drummer John Halsey advertised in Melody Maker for a new band on Thursday, 17 August and auditioned with Timebox shortly afterwards at the Scotch.\n\n29 August (Tuesday) –

The club’s opening was reported in The Stage in its 8 October 1964 issue.\n\nBrian Auger who played here with The Trinity claims that the Cromwellian is where Jimi Hendrix first jammed with his band after arriving in London in late September 1966, although others point to the Scotch of St James.\n\nAt its height in 1966-1967, it also hosted numerous jam sessions, featuring the likes of Chris Farlowe, Georgie Fame, Long John Baldry, Eric Burdon and Eric Clapton among others.\n\nLike other exclusive clubs like Blaises and the Scotch of St James, the entrance fee was expensive and therefore catered less for music fans and more for the celebrities of the day and wealthy clientele.\n\nThe Cromwellian was rarely advertised in the music papers so it’s been difficult to find gigs. The list below is a start but I’d welcome any additions and corrections plus any photos of the venue and posters of advertised gigs as well as band photos (all credited accordingly).\n\n1965\n\nAlthough it’s not been possible to find exact dates the following musicians confirmed their bands played at the Cromwellian during 1965-1966:\n\nSinger Jim Nairn (aka James Royal) says that James Royal & The Hawks and The James Royal Set played there throughout this period.\n\nTony Richard who drummed and sang with The Fetish Crowd says that his group performed there during 1965-1966.\n\nSinger Alan Chamberlain says that The Just Four, which became The Guests, played at the venue in 1965-1966.\n\nGuitarist/singer Stuart Cowell says he was working with Ralph Denyer’s Rockhouse Band when they performed at the Cromwellian in late 1965 before he left to join Gass.\n\nRay Lovegrove, who DJ’d at the venue, remembers seeing Stevie Wonder and also The Groundhogs at the club during 1965 when he was there. However, the Stevie Wonder gig could have been 26 January 1966 (see below).\n\nThe following list for 1965 is incomplete so I’d welcome additions:\n\n1 April 1965 (Thursday) – The Drifters (Melody Maker)\n\n5 June 1965 (Saturday) – The Soul Sisters (Melody Maker)\n\n8 June 1965 (Tuesday) – Donnie Elbert (Melody Maker)\n\n15 June 1965 (Tuesday) – Solomon Burke (Melody Maker)\n\n23 June 1965 (Wednesday) – Doris Troy (Melody Maker)\n\n13 July 1965 (Tuesday) – Georgie Fame & The Blue Flames (Melody Maker)\n\n23 July 1965 (Friday) – Inez & Charlie Foxx (Melody Maker)\n\n6 August 1965 (Friday) – The Stormsville Shakers (website: http://www.stormsvilleshakers.com/bandhistory.html)\n\n14 August 1965 (Saturday) – The Stormsville Shakers (website: http://www.stormsvilleshakers.com/bandhistory.html)\n\n30 August 1965 (Monday) – The Mark Leeman Five (Martyn Hanson’s Hang on to a Dream: The Story of the Nice book)\n\nAccording to Hanson’s book, this was keyboard player Terry Goldberg’s final gig with Mark Leeman’s band.\n\n8 September 1965 (Wednesday) – The Stormsville Shakers (website: http://www.stormsvilleshakers.com/bandhistory.html)\n\n11 September 1965 (Saturday) – The Stormsville Shakers (website: http://www.stormsvilleshakers.com/bandhistory.html)\n\n15 September 1965 (Wednesday) – The Loose Ends (South East London Mercury)\n\n16 September 1965 (Thursday) – The Stormsville Shakers (website: http://www.stormsvilleshakers.com/bandhistory.html)\n\n23 September 1965 (Thursday) – Dave Anthony’s Moods (Kevin Cann’s research – thanks to Andy Neill for sharing)\n\nGuitarist Tim Large says that Dave Anthony’s Moods had a regular Wednesday night gig at the Cromwellian but most of the 1965 gigs below are Thursdays.\n\n25 September 1965 (Saturday) – The Stormsville Shakers (website: http://www.stormsvilleshakers.com/bandhistory.html)\n\n1 October 1965 (Friday) – The Stormsville Shakers (website: http://www.stormsvilleshakers.com/bandhistory.html)\n\n7 October 1965 (Thursday) – The Stormsville Shakers (website: http://www.stormsvilleshakers.com/bandhistory.html)\n\nLondon Life magazine for the week 9-15 October, and for subsequent issues running to December 1966 when it closed, notes that several groups played each week.\n\n20 October 1965 (Wednesday) – Dave Anthony’s Moods (Kevin Cann’s research – thanks to Andy Neill for sharing)\n\n28 October 1965 (Thursday) – Dave Anthony’s Moods (Kevin Cann’s research – thanks to Andy Neill for sharing)\n\nBoz & The Boz People played at the Cromwellian sometime before 4 November, according to the West Surrey Advertiser (see pic)\n\n4 November 1965 (Thursday) – Dave Anthony’s Moods (Kevin Cann’s research – thanks to Andy Neill for sharing)\n\n11 November 1965 (Thursday) – The Mark Leeman Five (Kevin Cann’s research – thanks to Andy Neill for sharing)\n\n2 December 1965 (Thursday) – Georgie Fame & The Blue Flames (Record Mirror)\n\n9 December 1965 (Thursday) – The Mark Leeman Five (Kevin Cann’s research – thanks to Andy Neill for sharing)\n\n10 December 1965 (Friday) – The Beatstalkers (Kevin Cann’s research – thanks to Andy Neill for sharing)\n\n13 December 1965 (Monday) – The Beatstalkers (Kevin Cann’s research – thanks to Andy Neill for sharing)\n\n14 December 1965 (Tuesday) – The Nite People (Barry Curtis’ gig diary – thanks to John Warburg for sharing)\n\n15 December 1965 (Wednesday) – Major Lance (Record Mirror)\n\n16 December 1965 (Thursday) – Bluesology (Melody Maker)\n\nElton John (then known as Reg Dwight) was Bluesology’s keyboard player.\n\n20 December 1965 (Monday) – Joe Tex (Record Mirror)\n\n1966\n\nAlthough it’s not been possible to find exact dates the following musicians confirmed their bands played at the Cromwellian during 1966:\n\nKeyboard player Stan Marut, who worked with Julian Covey & The Machine from late 1965-mid-1966 says the group had a regular Saturday night residency at the club in early 1966 (and also possibly late 1965 when John McVie was briefly a member when Jack Bruce filled his spot in John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers). He remembers Sands were playing at the venue around the same time.\n\nAccording to Chris Groom’s excellent book “Rockin’ and Around Croydon”, Croydon group The Kingpins played at the Cromwellian in early 1966.\n\nSinger Alan Chamberlain says that The Guests played at the venue during 1966 (possibly with The Shevelles).\n\nJim Nairn (aka James Royal) says The James Royal Set played at the club this year.\n\nGuitarist Frank Torpey, who later became an original member of The Sweet, confirms his group The Tribe played at the Cromwellian (most likely this year and possibly also 1967).\n\nGuitarist Jim Cregan says that Blossom Toes performed at the venue (but this might have been 1967).\n\nRay Brown, who played bass with Jeff Curtis & The Flames from mid-1965 to late 1967 when they became The Kool, says that the band played at the Cromwellian a few times, most likely in 1966 (but also possibly early 1967).\n\nDrummer Rocky Browne confirms that The Summer Set had a weekly residence at the Cromwellian during 1966.\n\nDrummer Tony Richard says The Fetish Crowd played at the club during 1966.\n\nThe following list for 1966 is incomplete so I’d welcome additions:\n\n4 January 1966 (Tuesday) – The Mike Cotton Sound with Lucas (Melody Maker)\n\n11 January 1966 (Tuesday) – Pattie La Belle & The Bluebells with Bluesology (Melody Maker)\n\nElton John (then known as Reg Dwight) was Bluesology’s keyboard player.\n\n13 January 1966 (Thursday) – The Exciters (Record Mirror)\n\nRecord Mirror originally billed this show for 19 January.\n\n15 January 1966 (Saturday) – The Riot Squad (website: http://brunoceriotti.weebly.com/the-riot-squad.html)\n\n19 January 1966 (Wednesday) – Lee Dorsey (Record Mirror)\n\nRecord Mirror also listed this for 31 January so this may not have happened. Dorsey was most likely backed by The Krew featuring sax player Howie Casey. I also have The Sidewinders, so probably shared. They were back the following Wednesday to back Stevie Wonder.\n\n26 January 1966 (Wednesday) – Stevie Wonder (Record Mirror)\n\nStevie Wonder was backed by The Sidewinders (confirmed by drummer Malcolm Penn).\n\n31 January 1966 (Monday) – Lee Dorsey (Record Mirror and Rave Magazine)\n\nLee Dorsey was most certainly backed by The Krew.\n\n5 February 1966 (Saturday) – Bobby King & The Sabres (Clive Chase’s gig diary)\n\nThis was 2-6am on the Sunday morning after a show at the Glenlyn Ballroom in Forest Hill on the Saturday night.

The members will meet regularly at the Cromwellian.\n\nIn early June Melody Maker prints a “Guide to Good Raving” which lists the “in” clubs of the London scene. The Cromwellian is featured and the magazine notes that Gary Farr & The T-Bones, The Mark Leeman Five, Dave Anthony’s Moods, The Shevelles, Sands and The Peter B’s (actually The Shotgun Express) have recently played at the venue (performing until 2am).\n\n10 June 1966 (Friday) – Mike Cotton Sound with Lucas (Melody Maker)\n\nAccording to the Nottingham Evening Post, The Five Proud Walkers who play at the Beachcomber Club on 18 June came from the Cromwellian.\n\nAccording to the Southern Evening Echo (Southampton), The Move, who play the Adam & Eve in Southampton on 12 July, came from the Cromwellian (see above)\n\nAccording to the Nottingham Evening Post, The Cromwellians who play at the Beachcomber Club on 23 July came from the Cromwellian.\n\n27 July 1966 (Wednesday) – The Shevelles (Fabulous 208)\n\n30 July 1966 (Saturday) – The Riot Squad (website: http://brunoceriotti.weebly.com/the-riot-squad.html)\n\nThe Eyes of Blue, who have won Melody Maker’s National Beat Contest, celebrate with a party at the club on 7 August.

One of the first artists to introduce reggae to a wider audience, Cliff started performing in his native Jamaica during the early 1960s where he was spotted by Island Records founder Chris Blackwell, who brought him to England in October/November 1965.\n\nOver the next four years, Cliff worked the UK club scene with a series of backing groups – The New Generation, The Sound System, Dave Anthony’s Moods, The Soul System (aka The Attack), The Shakedown Sound (December 1966-February 1968) and The Wynder K Frog Band, playing a mixture of soul and R&B.\n\nJimmy Cliff & The New Generation\n\n(November 1965-February 1966)\n\nJimmy Cliff – lead vocals\n\nDave Pegg – lead guitar\n\nGraham Gallery – bass\n\nDave Brown – organ\n\nFrank Devine – drums\n\nAyshea Brough – vocals\n\nPete Hodge(s) – vocals\n\nCliff’s first band, The New Generation, was a Birmingham group known as Roy Everett’s Blueshounds, whose most notable member was future Fairport Convention bass player Dave Pegg.\n\nThe Blueshounds were good mates of The Spencer Davis Group, who put in a good word for the band when Chris Blackwell was looking for musicians to support Cliff on the road. In November 1965, Blackwell released The Spencer Davis Group’s “Keep on Running”, the band’s first number one single.\n\nAround the same time, Blackwell signed The Blueshounds to the agency he co-ran, West End Promotions Ltd, which also represented The Steampacket, Hedgehoppers Anonymous, The Alex Harvey Go Soul Show, Millie Small, Ayshea Brough and the newly arrived Jimmy Cliff.\n\nWith Pete Hodge(s) taking over from Roy Everett, The Blueshounds attended an “audition” recording session at Cecil Sharpe House in London on 23 November 1965 with promoter George Webb (The Spencer Davis Group’s agent) and DJ Alan Freeman.\n\nAlso in attendance that day were Jimmy Cliff and Ayshea Brough, a young singer that George Webb was trying to launch on the scene, who’d been working with future Hedgehoppers Anonymous drummer Glenn Martin.\n\nPassing the audition, The Blueshounds were renamed The New Generation and Cliff travelled up to Birmingham to stay with Dave Pegg’s family for about two weeks while rehearsals took place to ready the band for the road. Singers Ayshea Brough and Pete Hodge(s) were also added to the touring band and had their own vocal spots in the show.\n\nThe (incomplete) gig listing below, which is taken from Dave Pegg’s scrap book unless otherwise noted), shows that the band’s debut took place at the Ritz Ballroom in King’s Heath, West Midlands in mid-December.\n\nFor most of these gigs, the band was billed as The New Generation, although the Marquee gigs list them as The Jimmy Cliff Big Sound. The only exception is a show at the Cue Club in Paddington, central London on 28 January where the band was billed as The Sound System, which may originally have been assigned for Cliff’s second support group (see below), although Dave Pegg’s version did honour this gig.\n\nNotable gigs (from Dave Pegg’s diary unless noted)\n\n15 December 1965 – The Ritz Ballroom, King’s Heath, West Midlands\n\n17 December 1965 – The Carlton Ballroom, Erdington, West Midlands with Steampacket and Graham Bond\n\n17 December 1965 – Birmingham Town Hall, Birmingham with Steampacket and Graham Bond\n\n23 December 1965 – Marquee, Wardour Street, Soho, central London with Steampacket (billed as Jimmy Cliff Big Sound)\n\n24 December 1965 – Jigsaw, Manchester with Jimmy Powell 5 Dimensions (Manchester Evening News & Chronicle) (Billed as Explosive Jimmy Cliff, The New Generation, Ayshea and Pete Hodges)\n\n26 December 1965 – The Place, Hanley, Staffordshire with Chris Farlowe & The Thunderbirds and The Tribe (Evening Sentinel) (billed as Jimmy Cliffe, Ayshea, Peter Hodges and The New Generation). This is missing from Dave Pegg’s list\n\n31 December 1965 – Dungeon, Nottingham with Ayshea and Pete Hodges (Nottingham Evening Post)\n\n3 January 1966 – Cooks Ferry Inn, Edmonton, north London (Tottenham Weekly Herald)\n\n6 January 1966 – The Village, Cleethorpes with Ayshea and Pete Hodges (Grimsby Evening Telegraph)\n\n8 January 1966 – The Village, Cleethorpes with Ayshea and Pete Hodges (Grimsby Evening Telegraph) Says back by demand\n\n14 January 1966 – Il Rondo, Leicester (Leicester Mercury)\n\n15 January 1966 – Jigsaw, Manchester (Manchester Evening News) (billed as Jimmy Cliff plus New Generations Plus Ashea Plus Pete Hodges)\n\n16 January 1966 – Black Prince Hotel, Bexley, south east London (Melody Maker) (billed as Jimmy Cliff & The New Generation with Ayshea and Pete Hodges)\n\n22 January 1966 – Mr McCoys, Middlesbrough (Middlesbrough Evening Gazette) (billed as Jimmy Cliff & The New Generation)\n\n23 January 1966 – Jigsaw, Manchester (Manchester Evening News) (billed as the Explosive Jimmy Cliff with New Generation, Pete Hodges and Ayshea) Replaced Manfred Mann\n\n27 January 1966 – Marquee, Wardour Street, Soho, central London with The Steampacket\n\n28 January 1966 – The Cue Club, central Paddington (billed as Jimmy Cliff, Owen Gray, Ayshea and The Sound System)\n\n29 January 1966 – The Ricky Tick, Clewer Mead, Windsor, Berkshire\n\n30 January 1966 – The Village, Cleethorpes with Ayshea and Pete Hodges (Grimsby Evening Telegraph)\n\n4 February 1966 – Bluesville R&B Club, Manor House, Finsbury Park, north London (billed as Jimmy Cliff & The New Generation featuring Ayesha and Pete Hodge)\n\n5 February 1966 – Chelsea College, south west London with The Spencer Davis Group\n\nIt’s not entirely clear why Jimmy Cliff & The New Generation went their separate ways in early February 1966. Dave Pegg’s diary shows that a gig planned for 6 February was cancelled and on 13 February he was back in Birmingham working with a new band – The Uglys.\n\nAldershot News does list Jimmy Cliff playing at Farnborough Town Hall on 9 February but this may not have happened.\n\nThe decision to find a second band to back Cliff on the road was probably made in mid-late January and Chris Blackwell already knew who he wanted for the job.\n\nJimmy Cliff & The Sound System/New Generation\n\n(February-July 1966)\n\nJimmy Cliff – lead vocals\n\nTony Sinclair – lead guitar\n\nRon Thomas – bass\n\nMick Fletcher – organ\n\nJohn Droy – trumpet\n\nMel Wayne – sax\n\nDave Mahoney – sax\n\nPete Hodges – vocals\n\nAyshea Brough – vocals\n\nPhil Wainman – drums\n\nThe next group to back Jimmy Cliff on the road was also, somewhat confusingly, initially billed as The New Generation, although they also used the name The Sound System. Promoters added to the confusion by sometimes billing the band as The Jimmy Cliff Big Sound and The Jimmy Cliff Sound.\n\nThe Sound System, as they became around early January, had originally been called The Phil Wainman Band/Set. Phil Wainman, who years later found fame as a noted producer among other things, had first started out as a drummer in the early 1960s, working with The Hi Grades in Sweden and The Paramounts before linking up with the remnants of west London band, The All-Nite Workers around October 1965.\n\nRon Thomas, Mel Wayne and Dave Mahoney had all been members of this group, which had morphed out of Mike Dee & The Prophets in early-mid 1965. Mick Fletcher joined from The Epitaph Soul Band when it became The Phil Wainman Band/Set around October 1965 after briefly playing in The Herd while Tony Sinclair and John Droy came in soon after, the former from Johnny Halliday’s band in France.\n\nAccording to David Katz’s excellent book, Jimmy Cliff – An Unauthorised Biography, The Phil Wainman Band/Set secured a residency at Dolly’s Club in Jermyn Street in central London around November of that year. One night Chris Blackwell dropped in and introduced himself.\n\nAfter be-friending Wainman, he kept the musicians in mind as a support band for the Jamaican acts on Island Records’ roster, including Jackie Edwards, Millie Small and Owen Gray.\n\nChanging name to The Sound System, Wainman’s band started rehearsing with these acts in late January and one early gig, backing Owen Gray, took place at the New All Star Club in Artillery Passage near Liverpool Street station, London on 5 February 1966.\n\nAround this time, it became clear that Cliff and the original New Generation would be separating so Wainman’s band started rehearsing with the singer when he wasn’t gigging with Dave Pegg’s group. After a few weeks’ rehearsals, Jimmy Cliff & The Sound System/New Generation debuted at the Marquee on 10 February, billed as The Jimmy Cliff Big Sound.\n\nOver the next four and half months, Wainman’s band backed Cliff on the road, which included a package tour with The Who and The Spencer Davis Group in April 1966. It was during this time that Keith Moon spotted Wainman’s Red Sparkle Premier drum kit with two bass drums and decided to switch to the same set up two months later.\n\nAccording to Wainman, Jimmy Cliff & The Sound System/New Generation were particularly popular in Grimsby and played there at least once a month. They also played four nights at the Penthouse.\n\nHowever, some time in late July 1966, Jimmy Cliff and The Sound System/New Generation went their separate ways.\n\nIt’s not clear who backed Jimmy Cliff for a series of gigs that took place at London’s Whisky A Go Go on 9, 16 and 23 August as no support band is listed in Melody Maker, but he was joined by Dave Anthony’s Moods and The Soul System (aka The Attack) at some point during this period.\n\nIn December 1966, Jimmy Cliff hooked up with his next group, The Shakedown Sound with whom he worked with until February 1968. He then joined forces with Wynder K Frog.\n\nAs for The Sound System, the musicians joined forces with singer Gary Hamilton who was putting together a new version of Hamilton & The Movement (see future entry).\n\nNotable gigs:\n\n10 February 1966 – Marquee, Wardour Street, Soho, central London with Steampacket (Melody Maker) (billed as Jimmy Cliff Big Sound)\n\n13 February 1966 – Nottingham
