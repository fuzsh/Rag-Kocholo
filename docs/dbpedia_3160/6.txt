From whole beans to brewed coffee without the guesswork or mess, this 10-cup programmable coffeemaker features a completely automatic, integrated mill-and-brew system. Simply add water and whole-bean coffee, select from seven grind selections or turn the grinder off to brew already ground coffee, then enjoy the freshest, most flavorful coffee imaginable. The unit’s brew-pause function allows for pouring a cup midbrew, and its clock display automatically springs forward, falls back, and resets after a power failure. Other highlights include a water reservoir with a large viewing window, high-quality stainless-steel grinding blades, a permanent stainless-steel filter basket, a warming plate with automatic shutoff, and hidden cord storage.

Not only does the coffeemaker brew great-tasting coffee, it also provides animated weather information on its large, bright-blue backlit LCD display. MSN Direct region-specific up-to-the-minute weather information is transmitted via an FM signal within minutes of plugging in the coffeemaker–there’s no setup, subscription, or Internet connection required. The appliance displays the current temperature and conditions, high and low temperatures, and chance of precipitation, as well as four-day weather forecasts. The coffeemaker also displays scrolling weather information; visibility; sunrise/sunset time; the UV index; and National Weather Service warnings and alerts (the display flashes when a warning alert is issued). In addition to its optional sleep function, where if the unit is idle for a period of time an animated, napping cat appears, the user interface can display a 12- or 24-hour clock; temperature in degrees F or C; along with English, French, or Spanish languages. The 10-cup programmable coffeemaker with animated coffee and weather information measures 8 by 11 by 14 inches and carries a one-year limited warranty.
