        "text": "From whole beans to brewed coffee without the guesswork or mess, this 10-cup programmable coffeemaker features a completely automatic, integrated mill-and-brew system. Simply add water and whole-bean coffee, select from seven grind selections or turn the grinder off to brew already ground coffee, then enjoy the freshest, most flavorful coffee imaginable. The unit’s brew-pause function allows for pouring a cup midbrew, and its clock display automatically springs forward, falls back, and resets after a power failure. Other highlights include a water reservoir with a large viewing window, high-quality stainless-steel grinding blades, a permanent stainless-steel filter basket, a warming plate with automatic shutoff, and hidden cord storage.\n\nNot only does the coffeemaker brew great-tasting coffee, it also provides animated weather information on its large, bright-blue backlit LCD display. MSN Direct region-specific up-to-the-minute weather information is transmitted via an FM signal within minutes of plugging in the coffeemaker–there’s no setup, subscription, or Internet connection required. The appliance displays the current temperature and conditions, high and low temperatures, and chance of precipitation, as well as four-day weather forecasts. The coffeemaker also displays scrolling weather information; visibility; sunrise/sunset time; the UV index; and National Weather Service warnings and alerts (the display flashes when a warning alert is issued). In addition to its optional sleep function, where if the unit is idle for a period of time an animated, napping cat appears, the user interface can display a 12- or 24-hour clock; temperature in degrees F or C; along with English, French, or Spanish languages. The 10-cup programmable coffeemaker with animated coffee and weather information measures 8 by 11 by 14 inches and carries a one-year limited warranty. We all lead busy lives, and require real-time (and immediate), nonintrusive weather information (meaning: no pop-up ads on the internet or commercials). Melittaâs Smart Mill & Brew 10-cup programmable coffeemaker with MSN Direct region-specific weather information is a revolution in the coffee and kitchen world. It brings together the kitchen, the nucleus of the household, with up-to-date weather information, the information you demand in your recreational and work lives. Whether youâre brewing a cup of coffee for your morning ritual, or entertaining, or heading to the beach, gardening, playing tennis or golf, deciding whether or not to put sunblock on the kids, or walking out the door to work, you can access the weather information you need while brewing a cup of high-quality coffee. Itâs your grind, redefined.\n\nIt Starts with the Mill & Brew System\n\nThe integrated Mill & Brew system is completely automatic, which allows you to go from whole beans to brewed coffee without the guesswork or mess. Simply add your favorite whole bean coffee and water. Then select the grind level for coffee as strong or mellow as you like it–then enjoy fresh, flavorful coffee. The system features a grind level selector, high-quality stainless-steel blades, an easy-pour water reservoir with large viewing window, pause-and-pour functionality, a warming plate with auto shutoff, a permanent stainless-steel filter basket, and hidden cord storage. Stop Wondering About the Weather\n\nMSN Direct transmits region-specific weather data via an FM signal straight to the coffeemaker, making it easy to check todayâs weather, or upcoming weather, on the large LCD display. Itâs a plug-and-play system, so thereâs no subscription fee, activation fee, needed Internet connectivity, or fuss (the user must check to see if MSN Direct coverage is available in their area–currently, itâs available in 125 cities in the U.S. and Canada). Within minutes of plugging in the coffeemaker, you will receive weather information specific to your area. The weather data is updated 24 hours a day, seven days a week with the most up-to-the-minute information, and the clock automatically springs forward, falls back, and resets after power failure. The bright blue, backlighted screen doesnât only feature weather information though. It also lets you easily select your coffee grind and tells you what stage your coffee-making process is at. Donât be afraid to seamlessly integrate the Smart Mill & Brew into your busy life.
