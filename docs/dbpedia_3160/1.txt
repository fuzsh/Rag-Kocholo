The year: 2010. The setting: Your hotel room, after a day of business travel. You walk in to find a bevy of technology-fueled amenities—from a digital peephole in your door, to a toilet that lifts its own lid. That’s the vision of Guestroom 2010, the “hotel room of the future,” on display recently at a conference run by the Hospitality Financial and Technology Professionals (HFTP).

After polling frequent travelers on the ins and outs of hotel rooms, HFTP gave the traditional model a makeover. One example: Guestroom 2010 features a technology-laden bathroom, located at the rear of the room rather at its usual location near the entrance, says Frank Wolfe, CEO of Hospitality Financial and Technology Professionals.

Not all the 70 ideas featured in Guestroom 2010 may interest hotel companies, but HFTP’s goal is to start the discussion, Wolfe says. Here are a few of the examples on display.
