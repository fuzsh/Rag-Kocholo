        "text": "Note: This review was written back in 2003 when the book was first published. I tried to do a more formal review and submitted this for publication to a leftist magazine. It was rejected.\n\nStolen Land\n\nCONAN OF VENARIUM\n\nBy Harry Turtledove\n\nA Tor Book, New York, NY July 2003\n\nA new Conan book has hit the shelves. The seemingly never-ending adventures of this barbaric hero begin anew. Conan of Cimmeria, for those unaware, began life during the depression era in the pulp magazine Weird Tales. Conan didn’t achieve pop culture fame until about 30 years after his creator’s self inflicted demise though. A best selling paperback book series, Marvel Comics, and a movie featuring Arnold Schwarznegger as a muscle bound ersatz version of the barbarian cemented a pop-culture image of Conan as throwaway fantasy entertainment. Readers of the original stories by Robert E. Howard know that Howard’s Conan stories amount to more than that though. Conan reflected the depression and the myriad political contradictions of those times in manifest ways. The original stories are artifacts worth rediscovering.\n\nPopular science fiction author Harry Turtledove is doing just that. He bases this new novel on a paragraph in one of Robert E. Howard’s best Conan stories, “Beyond the Black River.” In this story Conan is a scout for an invading imperialist country called Aquilonia (think Rome or the USA). The Aquilonians are seeking to steal land from the Picts (think of Rome’s conquest of Britain or the United States conquest of the American West). In the set up to this tale, Conan opines, “This colonization business is mad, anyway. There’s plenty of good land east of the Bossonian marches. If the Aquilonians would cut up some of the big estates of their barons, and plant wheat where now only deer are hunted, they wouldn’t have to cross the border and take the land of the Picts away from them.” Conan later says, “They tried to colonize the southern marches of Cimmeria: destroyed a few small clans, built a fort-town, Venarium.” It is explained that Venarium was lost by the Aquilonians in a great slaughter. “I was one of the horde that swarmed over the hills,” says Conan proudly.\n\nTurtledove takes this idea from “Beyond the Black River” and creates a novel around it, a novel about imperialist conquest and the hatreds that burn on the fuel of stolen land. At the very least Conan of Venarium makes the reader think about the ramifications of being occupied and being the occupiers.\n\nTurtledove opens the novel by introducing some of the Aquilonian invaders. Vulth and Granth are stereotypical griping foot soldiers. Vulth is a little class conscious and snipes about the Aquilonian aristocrats using them as frontline fodder. Most of the men are nervous about facing their wild-eyed barbaric foes. The justification for the invasion is Cimmerian raids on border towns and farms.\n\nConan and his family are introduced. Turtledove has Conan’s family mirror the family of Conan’s creator. Robert E. Howard had a strained relationship with his father (a small-town doctor) and committed suicide when his mother went into a coma after a lingering illness. Conan’s father, Mordec is the village blacksmith and Conan’s mother, Verina is suffering with a lingering illness. Conan and his village have become aware of the invading army. Conan and his family are united in their hatred of the invaders. However Mordec thinks Conan too young to engage in battle although Conan is anxious to fight. Mordec savagely beats the boy into submission.\n\nThe Cimmerians make a rash effort to force the Aquilonians back and lose. They burn with desire for revenge but know they are beaten for now. An uneasy occupation develops. Some Cimmerians cooperate, most don’t. Granth thinks about the Cimmerians, “Those roaring, bellowing barbarians who kept coming, kept killing despite wounds that would have slain a civilized man on the instant were enough to chill the blood.”\n\nConan pursues his own boyhood adventures of hunting and honing his developing warrior skills. The original Conan stories by Howard always held a supernatural element hence their placement in Weird Tales. Howard was writing fantasy, not historical fiction, and in the best Conan stories the supernatural element was essential to the tale but in some of the stories the fantasy element was merely a sidebar. Turtledove’s tale is primarily about opposing peoples and the fight over land, a realistic situation, and Turtledove in this case possibly rightly has the supernatural element occur in Conan’s sidebar adventures. Conan first weird encounter is with a giant snake and then later with a flying demon. Both are a little cliché but a Conan tale traditionally requires a bit of a supernatural element.\n\nTime passes and settlers come in to farm the land under the Aquilonian army’s protection. Conan encounters a settler named Melcer. Conan has learned a little bit of the man’s language and confronts him speaking broken Aquilonian, “Not your land. You go home.” The man insists on peace, Conan replies, “No peace. You go, then peace.”\n\nConan is his wanderings throughout the forest encounters a lone Aquilonian soldier. Conan laughs at the man’s hunting technique and the Aquilonian is enraged and attempts to kill Conan. Conan aptly defends himself and kills the man. He has to hide the body to avoid a mass punishment being meted out to his tribe.\n\nIn the tradition of simplistic Hollywood movies Turtledove has the head commander of the Aquilonian army, Count Stercus, be a sexual degenerate. Apparently just being the head of an invading army that tramples on the rights of the native people isn’t quite villainous enough, or just maybe it is too villainous. The sexual degeneracy is good camouflage for making the villain just unrecognizable enough for those whom might see some of their own country’s history reflected in the villain’s deeds. Deliberately challenging your audience isn’t good for profits. Count Stercus’ predilection for young girls is only a partial catalyst for the Aquilonian army’s retreat though. Turtledove, realistically, has the Cimmerians hate the invaders from day one regardless of Count Stercus’ sexual urges.\n\nTurtledove is at his best when he juxtaposes Cimmerian attitudes with Aquilonian ones as in this bit of dialog between a soldier and Conan’s father:\n\n“You haven’t got noblemen in Cimmeria, have you?”\n\n“We have clan chiefs, but a man is a chief because of what he has done, not because of what his great-great-grandfather did.”\n\n“I thought so. That explains it. […] If you know who’s on top right away from the start, you don’t need to fight about it all the time.”\n\nThat made more sense than Mordec wished it did.\n\nEventually the southern Cimmerians gather enough of an alliance with their northern brothers to succeed in chasing the invaders back to their border. Turtledove has the Cimmerians engage in savage violence and bloodletting. You can almost sympathize with the settlers who simply wanted land to farm and did not reckon with the savage fury of a people that they thought their army had broken.\n\nPrimarily the novel is meant to entertain the reader with a tale of swords and revenge in a forgotten age. Turtledove is no Chomsky analyzing the politics of empire. He does an evenhanded job telling the story of the occupied and the occupiers though. Turtledove in the final analysis does not have the righteous indignation about the modern world that Robert E. Howard did. Howard’s best Conan stories are hardly leftist screeds but they do have critical things to say about modern issues. “The Tower of the Elephant” can be read as dealing with animal rights, “The God in the Bowl” is very much an anti-police brutality tale, but sadly “Rogues in the House” reflects Howard’s ultimately cynical views about things political. So Turtledove is true to his source in that regard. Still, it wouldn’t be a bad idea for those interested in depression era fiction to give Robert E. Howard and Conan a try."
