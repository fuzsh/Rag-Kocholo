For one hour, electricity flowed to Arco, Idaho, from this boiling water reactor. It demonstrated the practical and peaceful uses of nuclear power and the progress made at that time. The BORAX III reactor was used to also power the BORAX test facility and part of the National Reactor Testing Station. The reactor continued to be used for tests until 1956.\n\nScientists at the IAEA are helping local researchers find dangerous biotoxins in marine algae that can lead to outbreaks of contaminated seafood. Using nuclear and isotopic techniques, researchers can accurately measure biotoxins and study how they are transferred from organism to organism, making their way up the food chain and potentially reaching our plates. atoms.iaea.org/3LEIdvL\n\n🤔 What happens when you ask young people for innovative ideas to cultivate the next generation of the nuclear workforce? Nearly 90 young science enthusiasts from 26 countries accepted the IAEA's proSTEM challenge! From empowering students with special needs to making #STEM learning more fun for children, discover some of the most innovative projects by young aspiring STEM professionals 👉 atoms.iaea.org/3WjDRAa #WorldYouthSkillsDay\n\nDid you know that there is a nuclear solution to plastic pollution? #NUTECplastics, an IAEA flagship initiative, brings together countries and partners from around the world to address the global challenge of plastic pollution on two fronts: at point of source, by introducing new technologies to improve plastic recycling; and in the ocean, where the bulk of plastic waste ends up. https://lnkd.in/d2Zmj_k7"
