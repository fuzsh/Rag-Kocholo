III\n\n2006-05-01\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize to the IAEA and Director General ElBaradei in equal shares. The IAEA and its Director General won the 2005 Peace Prize for their efforts to prevent nuclear energy from being used for military purposes and to ensure that nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is used in the safest possible way. The IAEA Board of Governors subsequently decided that the IAEA's share of the prestigious prize would be used to create a special fund for fellowships and training to improve cancer control and childhood nutrition in the developing world. This fund is known as the 'IAEA Nobel Peace Prize Cancer and Nutrition Fund'. The money will be dedicated to enhancing human resources in developing regions of the world for improved cancer control and childhood nutrition. In the area of cancer control, the money will be spent on establishing regional cancer training institutes for the training of new doctors, medical physicists and technologists in radiation oncology to improve cancer treatment and care, as part of the IAEA's Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT). In the realm of nutrition, the focus of the Fund will be on capacity building in the use of nuclear techniques to develop interventions to contribute to improved nutrition and health for children in the developing world. Fund-supported fellowship awards will target young professionals, especially women, from Member States, through the IAEA's Technical Cooperation (TC) Programme. Alongside such awards, regional events will be organized in Africa, Asia and Latin America in cancer control and nutrition during 2006. The IAEA Secretariat is encouraging Member States and donors to contribute to the IAEA Nobel Peace Prize Cancer and Nutrition Fund by providing additional resources, in cash and in-kind\n\nIAEA Nobel Peace fund schools for nutrition. Combating child malnutrition\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFull text: Dhaka, Bangladesh - Malnutrition remains the world's most serious health problem and the single biggest contributor to child deaths in the developing world, according to the World Bank. Now, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is using its Nobel Peace Prize earnings to promote the use of nuclear techniques to combat malnutrition during the earliest years of life. 'One out of every ten children born in developing countries will die before his or her fifth birthday,' explains IAEA nutrition expert Lena Davidsson. 'That's more than 10 million dead children each year. And the vast majority of these child deaths in developing countries are preventable with a combination of good care, adequate nutrition and appropriate medical treatment,' explains Dr. Davidsson. 'This brings us hope that unacceptably high childhood mortality can be substantially reduced with effective and well-targeted nutritional interventions.' Undernutrition is an important factor in more than half of all child deaths worldwide. The high prevalence of infants born with low birth weight and undernutrition among Asian children, especially in South Asia, emphasizes the urgent need to develop effective nutrition interventions within 'the window of opportunity', i.e., to target young women before pregnancy as well as infants and young children during the first 2 years of life. The IAEA Nobel Peace Prize Fund School for Nutrition for Asia will be held in Dhaka, Bangladesh, April 22-26, 2007. It will focus on Interventions to combat undernutrition during early life and seeks to disseminate information about the usefulness of stable isotope techniques in intervention programs that reduce malnutrition, in particular in infants and children. The event is hosted by the Government of Bangladesh through the International Centre for Health and Population Research (ICDDR, B) and the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC).

Nobel Peace Prize awarded to IAEA and Director General\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nElBaradei, M.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nOn the occasion of receiving the Nobel Price the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei expressed his feeling of gratitude, pride and hope. He stated that with this recognition, the Norwegian Nobel Committee underscores the value and the relevance of the work the IAEA has been doing. It recognizes the urgency of addressing the dangers we face: nuclear proliferation, nuclear armaments, and nuclear terrorism. The award will lend prominence and impetus to the IAEA's ultimate objective - of passing to our children a world free of nuclear weapons - and for that I am deeply grateful. He takes great pride in all the men and women who serve at the International Atomic Energy Agency. The IAEA was founded with a simple credo: 'Atoms for Peace' - meaning that nuclear science should be used safely and securely in the service of humankind - in peaceful applications related to energy production, health, water, agriculture and other aspects of development -- and not for its destruction. More than anything, this award suggests that, almost five decades later, we are still focused unwaveringly on living up to that objective. He believes that the road to international peace and security lies through multilateralism - the collective search by people of all racial, religious, ethnic and national backgrounds to find a common ground, based not on intimidation or rivalry but on understanding and human solidarity. In a practical sense, this means developing a functional system of international security that does not derive from a nuclear weapons deterrent - but rather based on addressing the security concerns of all. The fact that the IAEA was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize gives renewed hope that, working in concert, the international community can achieve this goal. It strengthens both aspects of the Agency's mandate: ensuring that the benefits of nuclear energy are distributed as broadly as possible in the service of humankind, and working\n\nIn the service of peace: 2005 Nobel Peace prize\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n2006-01-01\n\nNobel Citation: The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2005 is to be shared, in two equal parts, between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its Director General, Mohamed ElBaradei, for their efforts to prevent nuclear energy from being used for military purposes and to ensure that nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is used in the safest possible way. At a time when the threat of nuclear arms is again increasing, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to underline that this threat must be met through the broadest possible international cooperation. This principle finds its clearest expression today in the work of the IAEA and its Director General. In the nuclear non-proliferation regime, it is the IAEA which controls that nuclear energy is not misused for military purposes, and the Director General has stood out as an unafraid advocate of new measures to strengthen that regime. At a time when disarmament efforts appear deadlocked, when there is a danger that nuclear arms will spread both to states and to terrorist groups, and when nuclear power again appears to be playing an increasingly significant role, IAEA's work is of incalculable importance. In his will, Alfred Nobel wrote that the Peace Prize should, among other criteria, be awarded to whoever had done most for the abolition or reduction of standing armies. In its application of this criterion in recent decades, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has concentrated on the struggle to diminish the significance of nuclear arms in international politics, with a view to their abolition. That the world has achieved little in this respect makes active opposition to nuclear arms all the more important today.

According to Geir Lundestad, Secretary of the Nobel Committee, of the 300 some peace prizes awarded worldwide, ânone is in any way as well known and as highly respected as the Nobel Peace Prizeâ (Lundestad, 2001. Nobel peace speech is a unique and significant international site of public discourse committed to articulating the universal grammar of peace. Spanning over 100 years of sociopolitical history on the world stage, Nobel Peace Laureates richly represent an important cross-section of domestic and international issues increasingly germane to many publics. Communication scholarsâ interest in this rhetorical genre has increased in the past decade. Yet, the norm has been to analyze a single speech artifact from a prestigious or controversial winner rather than examine the collection of speeches for generic commonalities of import. In this essay, we analyze the discourse of Nobel peace speech inductively and argue that the organizing principle of the Nobel peace speech genre is the repetitive form of normative liberal principles and values that function as rhetorical topoi. These topoi include freedom and justice and appeal to the inviolable, inborn right of human beings to exercise certain political and civil liberties and the expectation of equality of protection from totalitarian and tyrannical abuses. The significance of this essay to contemporary communication theory is to expand our theoretical understanding of rhetoricâs role in the maintenance and development of an international and cross-cultural vocabulary for the grammar of peace.\n\nIn the service of peace: 2005 Nobel Peace prize[For the efforts to prevent nuclear energy from being used for military purposes and to ensure that nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is used in the safest possible way\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNONE\n\n2006-01-15\n\nNobel Citation: The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2005 is to be shared, in two equal parts, between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its Director General, Mohamed ElBaradei, for their efforts to prevent nuclear energy from being used for military purposes and to ensure that nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is used in the safest possible way.

Cancer is a disease that is spreading very fast in the developing world and the IAEA has come to realize that we need to do much more to combat cancer in this part of the world, says IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei in a video address to the conference. I hope this event will be the first of many events that would enable us to work together - national governments, international organisations, civil society - to help combat this dreadful disease and provide quality of life to our fellow human beings. With the support of African Nobel Laureates Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and F.W. de Klerk, this unprecedented gathering will bring together senior representatives from major national and international cancer organisations. Together with leading public figures and specialists they will assess the growing cancer burden in Africa and focus on building effective cancer control programmes at the national and regional levels. The IAEA is sponsoring the intensive workshops using funds awarded for the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize. The IAEA's Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy, or 'PACT', was established in 2004 to help achieve these goals. Building on the IAEA's 30 years of expertise in promoting radiotherapy, PACT aims to help get more cancer treatment facilities up and running in the world's developing regions, along with the trained personnel to operate them. 'PACT' is building partnerships with the WHO and other international cancer-control organisations so that the battle against cancer can be waged at country level. This includes cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis and palliation, and more importantly education and training of professionals, says PACT Head Massoud Samiei.

The International Atomic Energy Agency and its Director General, Mohamed ElBaradei, were awarded the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize. Although this is a tremendous achievement for the Agency, it is by no means an isolated one within the UN family. The IAEA award is the eighth time the United Nations or partner international organization has won the Peace Prize. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the UN shared the 2001 prize; the UN Peacekeeping Forces were honored in 1988; the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) in 1965; the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in 1981 and 1954; and the International Labor Organization in 1969.

I cannot think of anyone today more deserving of this honour. In less than a year in office, he has transformed the way we look at ourselves and the world we live in and rekindled hope for a world at peace with itself. President Obama has provided outstanding leadership on moving towards a world free of nuclear weapons. He has shown an unshakeable commitment to diplomacy, mutual respect and dialogue as the best means of resolving conflicts. He has reached out across divides and made clear that he sees the world as one human family, regardless of religion, race or ethnicity. President Obama has brought a new vision of a world based on human decency, fairness and freedom which is an inspiration to us all.

A large volume, elegantly produced, it offers an overview of the Agency that is both attractive and educational. The book explores in pictures the balance between the IAEA's work as a nuclear watchdog and rigorous advocate for safety and security and its mission in helping developing countries use advanced science for humanitarian benefit. Issued at a time of unprecedented international interest in the Agency, it addresses the fundamental concepts that underlie the work of the IAEA and its 'Atoms for Peace' mission. It also describes the historical evolution of the IAEA, illustrating the successes and challenges that have shaped the organization over the past half century. Notable milestones covered include US President Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace speech, the establishment of safeguards regimes, the international response to the Chernobyl accident and the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005. Ongoing efforts, in fields ranging from sustainable energy production to human health and agricultural productivity, further detail the diversity and complexity of the IAEA's contribution - as IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei explains in the foreword - to 'the betterment of the human family.'

Poor medical facilities and lack of trained personnel and funding are limiting countries' ability to expand cancer care services and treat patients, while cancer rates are expected to double by 2020. More than 70 per cent of all cancer deaths occur in low and middle income countries and globally cancer kills more people than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. Through its Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT) the IAEA is using funds, awarded for the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize, to sponsor training workshops, such as the Buenos Aires event, that alert policy makers and health experts to the pressing need for national cancer control plans and programmes. 'I hope that this event in Latin America is the first of many that will enable us to work together to help combat this dreadful disease and provide quality of life to our fellow human beings,' said Director General of the IAEA, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei. 'Cancer is a disease that is spreading very fast in the developing world and we have come to realise that we have to do much more to combat it in this part of the world.' In Latin America, there are an estimated 450,000 cancer deaths annually. The most commonly occurring cancers in men are prostate, stomach, lung, and colorectal and in women the most commonly occurring cancers are breast, cervix, stomach and colorectal. Breast and cervical cancer can be prevented through screening and early detection and can be cured in the early stages with effective treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that cancer will soon reach epidemic proportions, causing up to 10 million deaths a year by 2020. Yet at least one third of all cancers are preventable.

This awarding to a group of scientists may look surprising. However, it just reflects the fear that climatic change represents a threat for the international safety. It shows that any mastering action of this global warming involves a very strategical sector, the energy sector, and disturbs our ways of producing, of consuming and of transporting ourselves. It is of prime importance to maintain the dialogue between the supporters of the two opposite visions of the world with contradictory interests, since the climate topic is a strong source of potential conflicts. This is one of the missions of the IPCC, a group of experts elected by their peers to establish a state-of-the-art of the scientific knowledge about climate change. This original scientific institution intercedes here not as a judge but as a warrant of the truthfulness of the informations in domains where the knowledge remains fragile and disputed.

Our role is to help prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and to make nuclear science and technology available for peaceful purposes, especially to developing countries. Nuclear power is the best known peaceful application of nuclear technology. The use of nuclear power continues to grow throughout the world despite the Fukushima Daiichi accident three years ago. The IAEA does not encourage countries to use nuclear power, nor do we try to discourage them. It is up to each sovereign state to make its own decision. However, many countries believe nuclear power can help them achieve energy security, boost their economic competitiveness and help to mitigate the effects of climate change. The IAEA works closely with the 30 countries which already have nuclear power programmes, and with those planning to build their first reactors, to help them use nuclear power safely and securely. In recent years, we have been active in helping Japan deal with the aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi accident and improving global safety standards. The goal is to do everything humanly possible to prevent accidents at nuclear facilities, and to minimise the consequences if an accident should occur. The IAEA plays a central role in strengthening nuclear security. We help countries to properly protect nuclear and other radioactive materials, as well as the nuclear facilities in which they are housed. Our work covers a broad range of activities, from supplying radiation detection equipment for countries to use at ports and airports and providing specialist training, to helping protect major public events against nuclear terrorism. Through our technical cooperation programme, we help to make peaceful nuclear technology available to developing countries in areas as diverse as cancer control, nutrition, the eradication of the tsetse fly, and combating environmental pollution.

Established as an autonomous organization under the United Nations (UN) in 1957, the IAEA represents the culmination of international efforts to make a reality of US President Eisenhower's proposal in his 'Atoms for Peace' speech to the UN General Assembly in 1953.

One emphasizes the potential benefits of the peaceful application of this source of energy to a variety of purposes, particularly the generation of electric power. The other stresses the risks engendered by the transfer of nuclear material, equipment and technology that might lend themselves to the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Recipient States have traditionally underlined their need and their inherent right to have unimpaired access to the peaceful applications of nuclear energy, while the supplier States, wishing to avoid contributing to the spread of a nuclear-weapon capability among recipients, have advocated restrictions on international transfers, especially of nuclear know-how and installations. In 1977, 15 supplier States agreed upon criteria for the application of IAEA safeguards to exports and formulated requirements to prevent unauthorized transactions, including restrictions on re-exportation. In February 1980, the Conference on the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation (INFCE), initiated by the United States, completed a technical evaluation of data and options that it had undertaken to find less proliferation-prone nuclear fuel cycles. Sixty-six States-both suppliers and recipients of nuclear technology-took part in the evaluation, which did not, however, lead to the hoped-for result\n\nThe meaning of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize. Microcredit evangelism, health, and social policy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBond, Patrick\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe awarding of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize to Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank, provides an opportunity to consider the use and abuse of microfinancing, especially because credit continues to be touted as a poverty-reduction strategy associated with health education and health care financing strategies. Not only is the Grameen diagnosis of poverty dubious, but many structural problems also plague the model, ranging from financial accounting to market failures. In Southern Africa, to illustrate, microcredit schemes for peasants and small farmers have been attempted for more than 70 years, on the basis that modem capitalism and peasant/informal system gaps can be bridged by an expanded financial system. The results have been disappointing. A critical reading of political economy posits an organic linkage between the \"developed\" and \"underdeveloped\" economies that is typically not mitigated by capitalist financial markets, but instead is often exacerbated. When applied to health and social policy, microcredit evangelism becomes especially dangerous.\n\n[Surgeons and Neurosurgeons as Nobel Prize Winners].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChrastina, Jan; JanÄÃ¡lek, Radim; HrabovskÃ½, DuÅ¡an; NovÃ¡k, ZdenÄk\n\nSince 1901 Nobel Prize is awarded for exceptional achievements in physics, chemistry, literature, peace, economy (since 1968) and medicine or physiology. The first aim of the paper is to provide an overview of surgeons - winners of Nobel Prize for medicine or physiology. Although the prominent neurosurgeons were frequently nominated as Nobel Prize candidates, surprisingly no neurosurgeon received this prestigious award so far despite that the results of their research transgressed the relatively narrow limits of neurosurgical speciality.The most prominent leaders in the field of neurosurgery, such as Victor Horsley, Otfrid Foerster, Walter Dandy and Harvey Cushing are discussed from the point of their nominations. The overview of the activity of the Portuguese neurologists and Nobel Prize Winter in 1949 Egas Moniz (occasionally erroneously reported as neurosurgeon) is also provided. Although his work on brain angiography has fundamentally changed the diagnostic possibilities in neurology and neurosurgery, he was eventually awarded Nobel Prize for the introduction of the currently outdated frontal lobotomy.The fact that none of the above mentioned prominent neurosurgeons has not been recognised by Nobel Prize, may be attributed to the fact that their extensive work cannot be captured in a short summary pinpointing its groundbreaking character.\n\nAbout the Nobel peace price awarded to the GIEC; Autour du prix Nobel de la paix pour le GIEC\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHourcade, J.Ch\n\n2008-02-15\n\nOn October 12, 2007, the Nobel peace price was awarded to Al Gore and to the less mediatized IPCC (intergovernmental panel on climate change). This awarding to a group of scientists may look surprising. However, it just reflects the fear that climatic change represents a threat for the international safety. It shows that any mastering action of this global warming involves a very strategical sector, the energy sector, and disturbs our ways of producing, of consuming and of transporting ourselves. It is of prime importance to maintain the dialogue between the supporters of the two opposite visions of the world with contradictory interests, since the climate topic is a strong source of potential conflicts. This is one of the missions of the IPCC, a group of experts elected by their peers to establish a state-of-the-art of the scientific knowledge about climate change. This original scientific institution intercedes here not as a judge but as a warrant of the truthfulness of the informations in domains where the knowledge remains fragile and disputed. This dossier presents the contribution of the IPCC (GIEC in French) to the climate change debate, and the CIRED, a mixed research unit involved in the sustainable development issue.

Poor medical facilities and lack of trained personnel and funding are limiting countries' ability to expand cancer care services and treat patients, while cancer rates are expected to double by 2020. More than 70 per cent of all cancer deaths occur in low and middle income countries and globally cancer kills more people than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. Through its Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT) the IAEA is using funds, awarded for the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize, to sponsor training workshops, such as the Buenos Aires event, that alert policy makers and health experts to the pressing need for national cancer control plans and programmes. 'I hope that this event in Latin America is the first of many that will enable us to work together to help combat this dreadful disease and provide quality of life to our fellow human beings,' said Director General of the IAEA, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei. 'Cancer is a disease that is spreading very fast in the developing world and we have come to realise that we have to do much more to combat it in this part of the world.' In Latin America, there are an estimated 450,000 cancer deaths annually. The most commonly occurring cancers in men are prostate, stomach, lung, and colorectal and in women the most commonly occurring cancers are breast, cervix, stomach and colorectal. Breast and cervical cancer can be prevented through screening and early detection and can be cured in the early stages with effective treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that cancer will soon reach epidemic proportions, causing up to 10 million deaths a year by 2020. Yet at least one third of all cancers are preventable. A further one third of cases can be effectively treated if detected early. PACT was established\n\nAlfred Nobel and His Prizes: From Dynamite to DNA.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLichtman, Marshall A\n\n2017-07-01\n\nAlfred Nobel was one of the most successful chemists, inventors, entrepreneurs, and businessmen of the late nineteenth century. In a decision later in life, he rewrote his will to leave virtually all his fortune to establish prizes for persons of any nationality who made the most compelling achievement for the benefit of mankind in the fields of chemistry, physics, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace among nations. The prizes were first awarded in 1901, five years after his death. In considering his choice of prizes, it may be pertinent that he used the principles of chemistry and physics in his inventions and he had a lifelong devotion to science, he suffered and died from severe coronary and cerebral atherosclerosis, and he was a bibliophile, an author, and mingled with the literati of Paris. His interest in harmony among nations may have derived from the effects of the applications of his inventions in warfare (\"merchant of death\") and his friendship with a leader in the movement to bring peace to nations of Europe. After some controversy, including Nobel's citizenship, the mechanisms to choose the laureates and make four of the awards were developed by a foundation established in Stockholm; the choice of the laureate for promoting harmony among nations was assigned to the Norwegian Storting, another controversy. The Nobel Prizes after 115 years remain the most prestigious of awards. This review describes the man, his foundation, and the prizes with a special commentary on the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\n\nIAEA Orientation for Diplomats 2013.

The Agency assures the international community that States party to Safeguards Agreements are complying with their undertaking not to use facilities and divert nuclear materials from peaceful uses to the manufacture of nuclear explosive devices. The task of IAEA safeguards can be summed up as to detect diversion of nuclear materials committed to peaceful uses of nuclear energy, or the misuse of equipment or facilities subject to certain safeguards agreements, and to deter such diversion or misuse through the risk of early detection. This lecture concentrates on the factors the Agency takes into account in designing and implementing safeguards approaches at facilities.

Its 17-member delegation attended the 1 st International Conference on Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy in Geneva in August 1955. Czechoslovakia was invited to work of the twelve countries on the final draft of the International Atomic Energy Agency Statutes in 1956, it became a member of the IAEA Board of Governors (alternating with Poland), and the first Czechoslovak Governor P. Winkler was elected President of the Board in 1957. Czechoslovakia also was one of the fifteen countries designated to the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation in 1955. Besides, Czechoslovak specialists participated actively in the work of committees of the International Commission on Radiological Protection for many years. Involvement in the international cooperation on peaceful use of atomic energy represented for Czechoslovakia obligations as well as stimuli to the national development of nuclear fields, including radiobiology.

The knowledge to build an atomic bomb was in the hands of rival powers and would soon be shared by many countries, the President said. It was time to create a U.N. body that could ensure that the new technology served no military purpose. It was time, moreover, to 'devise methods whereby this fissionable material would be allocated to serve the peaceful pursuits of mankind' in agriculture, medicine and other peaceful activities. Eisenhower foresaw a world safe from the destructive power of atomic fission but gaining from its technological advances. Half a century later, the world continues to witness his foresight through the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA aims at four formidable goals: safeguarding nuclear nonproliferation; enhancing the security of nuclear facilities and radioactive materials; ensuring the safety of nuclear technologies; and promoting nuclear science to meet human needs. As the world's 'nuclear watchdog,' the IAEA's impartial inspectorate verifies the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in scores of countries. By joining the Agency's strengthened safeguards system and concluding an Additional Protocol, countries can assure the world-and the IAEA can verify-that their nuclear activities are not used for weapons purposes. True to Eisenhower's vision, the power of the atom is being tapped for many human benefits, especially in the world's less developed nations. Extreme poverty remains a profound problem today: some 1.2 billion people in the developing world survive marginally on less that US$1 per day. Another 2.8 billion struggle on less than US$2 per day. The IAEA is mobilizing nuclear science to help address these pressing needs. From managing water better, to controlling pests and diseases, to protecting the environment, the IAEA is helping poor countries make sizeable advances. At the same time, the IAEA works\n\nEisenhowerâs Atoms for Peace. The Speech that Inspired the Creation of the IAEA\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRÃ¶hrlich, Elisabeth\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSixty years ago, on 8 December 1953, US President Eisenhower delivered his historic âAtoms for Peaceâ address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The Cold War and the nuclear arms race were the background for the Presidentâs speech. However, instead of solely focusing on the perils of atomic war, Eisenhower lauded the civilian nuclear applications in agriculture, medicine, and power generation. He proposed the establishment of an âinternational atomic energy agencyâ that would promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy âfor the benefit of all mankind.â In October 1957, Eisenhowerâs vision became reality. From todayâs perspective, it is striking that during a tense period of the Cold War international agreement on nuclear matters was reached within only four years. In October 1957, the first IAEA General Conference took place in Vienna, and the city was chosen as the location of the new organizationâs permanent headquarters. When the first IAEA General Conference convened, the renowned Austrian journalist Hugo Portisch declared that Vienna had become âthe worldâs centre of the atom.â With the IAEAâs establishment, the way was paved for Viennaâs role as a centre of international organizations\n\nPeace and development through the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n2015-01-01\n\nNuclear science and technology can help find solutions to many of the problems people face every day across the globe.

The Nobel Prize is today widely considered as the most prestigious international symbol of scientific excellence, but it still is an exciting research question how it gained such prestige. Drawing on files from the Emil von Behring Archive in Marburg, Germany, and the Archive of the Nobel Assembly for Physiology or Medicine in Stockholm this essay aims at shedding light on why the first Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1901 was awarded the German immunologist Emil von Behring, and how this decision was viewed at that time.

The most significant role that the IAEA undertakes is the development and application of safeguards to nuclear material, other material, equipment and facilities; this work consumes about 35% of the IAEA budget. The authority, procedures and limitations for the application of safeguards were described together with the relationship between the IAEA and the States where safeguards are in effect. Claims that the IAEA is not adequately fulfilling its safeguard role are usually based on misunderstandings of its role and authority. The IAEA's relationship to inspected States is not adversarial, regulatory, or guarding. It provides assurance to all States that peaceful nuclear activities are not diverted to a military program and in so doing enhances the reputation of States to whom safeguards are applied. Safeguards would be only one of many factors that would be involved in a States embarking on a military nuclear program. If proliferation of nuclear weapons occurs, this may be due in entirety or in part to these other factors. Many States could now undertake a military program but do not do so, because of their enlightened viewpoint that such activities are not in their own, or the world's best interests. However, any trend to further proliferation of nuclear weapons could be diminished by: -a lessening of political and economic tension between States, -restrictions on the supply of required technology, equipment, and material, and -an effective IAEA safeguard regime. There has been a regrettable trend to politicization in the direction and operation of the IAEA. It is hoped that this trend will be reversed and that IAEA will return to its earlier more technical role. There is a pressing need for the general public and governments to more fully understand the IAEA's role and its limitations\n\nSafe and peaceful use of nuclear energy - an IAEA perspective. Address. Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Auswaertige Politik, Bonn, 17 April 1998\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nElBaradei, M.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe document reproduces the text of the conference given by the Director General of the IAEA at the Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Auswaertige Politik in Bonn on 17 April 1998. After a presentation of the Agency's role in the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy, the conference gives an overview of the main issues facing nuclear energy in the following three major areas: the contribution of nuclear energy to economic and social development, nuclear safety, and verification. In the last part, the Director General makes some comments about the future\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency - IAEA\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPezzutti, A.A.C.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nThe origens, functions and objectives of the IAEA are analysed. The application of safeguards to avoid military uses of nuclear energy is discussed. In the final section the agrement between Brazil and Germany regarding IAEA safeguards, as well as the competence for executing the brazilian program are explained. It is, then, an informative study dealing with nuclear energy and its peaceful path, the creation of International Fuel Cycle Evaluation and nonproliferation [pt\n\nAtoms for peace. A vision for the future\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nElBaradei, M.\n\n2003-01-01\n\n'Atoms for Peace', these three words embody the vision that has driven the IAEA since its inception: that the power of the atom, newly tapped in the mid-20th century, held a vast potential - as a weapon of destruction on a scale previously unimaginable, or as a reservoir of energy that could be harnessed for a wealth of benefits to humankind. As with any advanced science, atomic energy posed a choice for the human race: would we use this tool for good or for ill? With the horrific images of Hiroshima and Nagasaki still fresh in the mid-1950s, 'Atoms for Peace' invoked the solemn commitment that nuclear science and technology would henceforth be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. Fifty years later, the 'Atoms for Peace' ideal remains appropriate and vital, the unifying principle behind the IAEA's dual mission. We are committed to containing the spread of r nuclear weapons, and we firmly support the elimination of the nuclear arsenals that exist. And we are equally committed to advancing the use of nuclear science and technology in peaceful pursuits: to enhance human health; to increase t agricultural productivity; to improve the management of water resources; to generate electricity free of greenhouse gas emissions; and to strengthen many other aspects of social and economic development. But with new times come new challenges. While 'Atoms for Peace' continues to express the IAEA vision in the 21st century, it is worth considering how our approach has evolved, in response to these new challenges, as we seek to implement various aspects of this vision. Fifty years ago, the international community set about to move towards a world in which nuclear weapons would no longer be needed or pursued, and in which peaceful nuclear technologies would provide enduring benefits to all peoples and cultures. The 21st century has brought new and critical challenges to this mission. But the question remains: what legacy do we want to leave to our children?\n\nThe international framework for safeguarding peaceful nuclear energy programs\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMazer, B.M.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nInternational law, in response to the need for safeguard assurances, has provided a framework which can be utilized by supplier and recipient states. Multilateral treaties have created the International Atomic Energy Agency which can serve a vital role in the establishment and supervision of safeguard agreements for nuclear energy programs. The Non-Proliferation Treaty has created definite obligations on nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear weapon states to alleviate some possibilities of proliferation and has rejuvenated the function of the IAEA in providing safeguards, especially to non-nuclear-weapon states which are parties to the Non-Proliferation treaty. States which are not parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty may receive nuclear energy co-operation subject to IAEA safeguards. States like Canada, have insisted through the bilateral nuclear energy co-operation agreements that either individual or joint agreement be reached with the IAEA for the application of safeguards. Trilateral treaties among Canada, the recipient state and the IAEA have been employed and can provide the necessary assurances against the diversion of peaceful nuclear energy programs to military or non-peaceful uses. The advent of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and its guidlines has definitely advanced the cause of ensuring peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The ultimate objective should be the creation of an international structure incorporating the application of the most comprehensive safeguards which will be applied universally to all nuclear energy programs\n\nQuality assurance measures applicable to IAEA anomaly and discrepancy resolution (ISPO Task D.52). Program for technical assistance to IAEA safeguards\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHarms, N.L.; Smith, B.W.\n\n1984-11-01\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards program provides assurance to the international community that nations comply with their commitments for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. This assurance is based on the capabilities of the IAEA safeguards program to detect diversion of nuclear material. Anomalies and discrepancies, which occur in the event of a diversion or concealment, are detected as part of the IAEA safeguards program. Anomalies and discrepancies normally result from innocent causes and it is the purpose of the resolution process to determine the significance of them. The IAEA is instituting quality assurance measures for the IAEA inspection process. This paper reviews the anomaly and discrepancy resolution process and describes quality control measures which are the basis for quality assurance. 13 references, 6 tables\n\nIAEA safeguards and non-proliferation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHarry, R.J.S.\n\n1995-02-01\n\nAn overview is given of the efforts to contain the nuclear weapons proliferation during half a century of man-controlled nuclear fission.

The Non-Proliferation Treaty laid the basis for a unique system of voluntarily accepted international inspections to verify the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The IAEA got the task to implement this 'Full Scope Safeguards' on all nuclear material and all nuclear activities in the non-nuclear weapon states.

'The purpose of my visit will be to initiate an in-depth process of verification of all of Libya's past and present nuclear activities', Dr. ElBaradei said in a news conference. 'We shall define the corrective actions that need to be taken and consult on the necessary steps to eliminate any weapons related activities.' The announcement follows a meeting held in Vienna on 20 December 2003 between Dr. ElBaradei and H.E. Engineer Matooq Mohamed Matooq, Assistant Secretary for Services Affairs of the General People's Committee of Libya. In that meeting, Mr. Matooq informed Dr. ElBaradei of Libya's decision to eliminate 'materials, equipments and programmes which lead to the production of internationally proscribed weapons'. The Agency was also informed that Libya had been engaged for more than a decade in the development of a uranium enrichment capability. This included importing natural uranium and centrifuge and conversion equipment and the construction of now dismantled pilot scale centrifuge facilities. Some of these activities should have been, but were not, reported to the IAEA under Libya's Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA. Mr. Matooq stated, however, that Libya's nuclear enrichment programme was at an early stage of development and that no industrial scale facility had been built, nor any enriched uranium produced. Libya has asked the IAEA to ensure through verification that all of Libya's nuclear activities will henceforth be under safeguards and exclusively for peaceful purposes. In that regard, Libya has agreed to take the necessary steps to conclude an Additional Protocol to its NPT Safeguards Agreement, which will provide the IAEA with broader inspection rights, and to pursue with the IAEA a policy of full transparency and active co-operation. Dr. ElBaradei said, 'Libya's decision to\n\nMultiscale modeling of nerve agent hydrolysis mechanisms: a tale of two Nobel Prizes\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nField, Martin J.; Wymore, Troy W.\n\n2014-10-01\n\nThe 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems, whereas the 2013 Peace Prize was given to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for their efforts to eliminate chemical warfare agents.

Our role is to help prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and to make nuclear science and technology available for peaceful purposes, especially to developing countries. Nuclear power is the best known peaceful application of nuclear technology. Despite the Fukushima Daiichi accident three years ago, the use of nuclear power continues to grow throughout the world. The main centre of expansion is in Asia. The IAEA does not encourage countries to use nuclear power, nor do we try to discourage them. It is up to each sovereign state to make its own decision. However, many countries believe nuclear power can help them achieve energy security, boost their economic competitiveness and help to mitigate the effects of climate change\n\nNobel Prize ceremony 2013\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2013-01-01\n\nOn 10 December 2013 particle physics took central stage at the Nobel ceremony in Stockholm.

And with this progress came an incredible amount of responsibility for scientists and governments. The creation of the IAEA and its technical cooperation programme brought together scientists and governments to use nuclear technology for the 'peaceful pursuits of mankind'. The programme supports application of nuclear techniques to solve socio-economic and human development problems in areas as diverse as agriculture, health, natural resource management, and radiation protection. Fifty years after President Eisenhower's famous 'Atoms for Peace' speech, the IAEA technical cooperation programme provides more than $70 million worth of experts, training, and procurement services each year to approximately 75% of its 137 Member States. But as development budgets shrink, the programme is seeking to make more meaningful use of resources at hand (national capacities, regional resources, development partners and the voluntary Technical Cooperation Fund), targeting specific problems of Member States and partnering with other sustainable development organizations. At the same time, efforts continue to overcome the past legacy that necessitated the 'Atoms for Peace' proposal in the first place. Even as development challenges are addressed, the IAEA, its partners and governments face other challenges along the way, including public opinion for a technology that had a devastating global introduction\n\nThe continuing role of item-specific agreements in the IAEA safeguards system\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDeFrancia, Cristian\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) 'safeguards system' serves as the foundation of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime, under which the IAEA acts as an auditor, monitor and inspector of state-administered nuclear energy programmes. The system consists of agreements and practices that enable the IAEA to gain a clear picture of a state's nuclear activities in order to provide credible assurances that nuclear energy is used for exclusively peaceful purposes\n\nAtoms for peace and development: Contributing to global progress through nuclear science and technology\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAmano, Yukiya\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCultivating new crop varieties, reducing soil erosion and helping African countries respond to Ebola Virus Disease are just some of the areas in which the IAEA helps Member States to benefit from nuclear technology. Assisting countries in the safe and secure use of nuclear techniques for development is as important to the IAEA as its non-proliferation work. For many developing countries, it is the most important thing we do. Our mandate has been summarized as Atoms for Peace. Today, I feel that our mandate could be better understood as Atoms for Peace and Development.\n\nNPT and the peaceful use of nuclear energy\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPellaud, B.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nIn his opening remarks the author spoke on the role of IAEA safeguards in the process of international verification and confidence building that peaceful nuclear programmes are not used for the production of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices\n\nTowards Producing Black Nobel Laureates Affiliated with ``African Universities''\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKenneth, Jude\n\nWhile Africa has produced a handful Nobel laureate in literature and peace, it has continued to shy away from producing any in the other categories. The reason is not farfetched; our university system is not up to standard. It is saddening that in this century, African countries place emphasis on certificates and not on knowledge. This has made the continent produce students that lack the intellectual capability, experimental ability, fundamental training, creativity, and motivation to excel except they get a foreign training. It is this backdrop that precipitated the research into the methods of teaching and research in universities across Africa. The study is designed to identify the problems and proffer solution to them. Two important questions immediately come to mind. (1) What factors account for the difficulty in producing Nobel laureates affiliated with African universities? (2) What strategies could be adopted to improve teaching and research in African universities? Several factors were investigated which revolve around funding, the competence of the lecturers, quality of students admitted, attitude of the students, parents and government. Nigerian universities were investigated and important deductions were made. During the study an inquiry was made on the method of instruction at various universities, from result obtained, the study therefore concluded that adequate funding, the presence of erudite scholars and brilliant minds will produce future Nobel laureate affiliated with the continent. The study therefore recommended admission and employment of only students and lecturers who have got a thing for academics into the universities and adequate funding of universities and research centres.\n\nThe IAEA Promotes the Application of Safety Standards and Best Practices for the Management of Radioactive Waste\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe IAEA works to promote a high level of safety as it facilitates peaceful uses of nuclear energy worldwide. The IAEAâs Statute authorizes it to establish or adopt standards of safety for protection of health and minimization of danger to life and property, and to provide for the application of these standards. The Statute also mandates the IAEA to foster the exchange of scientific and technical information to facilitate the peaceful uses of atomic energy. To this end, the IAEA develops safety standards on different topics, including on the safety of radioactive waste management. These standards, issued in the IAEA Safety Standards Series, reflect an international consensus on what constitutes a high level of safety for protecting people from harmful effects of ionizing radiation and protecting the environment\n\nThe roles of Euratom and the IAEA in nuclear non-proliferation - a Euratom view\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSzymanski, P.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe IAEA safeguards conclusion that all nuclear material has remained in peaceful activities in a State is based on the finding that there are no indications of diversion of declared nuclear material from peaceful activities and no indications of undeclared nuclear material or activities in the State as a whole. The state-level concept that has been introduced by the IAEA in this respect allows and obliges the IAEA to take into account state specific factors to determine the set of safeguards activities to be applied in a State. The effectiveness of the EURATOM regional safeguards systems, its cooperation with the IAEA and its independence from States and operators are among the factors which the IAEA needs to consider in order to apply safeguards in an effective and efficient way. Socio-economic and political factors like the support to international non-proliferation should also be factors in this concept. The intended evolution of the state-level concept by the IAEA then should result in making better use of the activities of EURATOM safeguards. This is possible by the IAEA relying more on the EURATOM activities for the verification of declared nuclear material and the IAEA concentrating on getting assurance on the absence of undeclared materials and activities. Developing a regional-level concept that supplements the state-level concept can contribute to determine the extent to which the IAEA can make better use of EURATOM safeguards in the future.

In the more than thirty years that have passed since that time, the potential applications of nuclear techniques have greatly expanded. Over the period, many of the applications have moved from research laboratories into hospitals, farms and industrial enterprises. The direct resources made available to the IAEA by its Member States to support technology transfer processes have grown rapidly since the late 1950s. The current trends in the technical co-operation activities of the IAEA and some examples of projects supported by the IAEA are briefly presented in this document\n\nIAEA activities in gas-cooled reactor technology development\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCleveland, J.; Kupitz, J.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has the charter to ''foster the exchange of scientific and technical information'', and ''encourage and assist research on, and development and practical application of, atomic energy for peaceful uses throughout the world''.

The IAEA works with its Member States and multiple partners worldwide to promote safe, secure and peaceful nuclear technologies. To catalyse innovation in nuclear power technology in Member States, the IAEA coordinates cooperative research, promotes information exchange, and analyses technical data and results, with a focus on reducing capital costs and construction periods while further improving performance, safety and proliferation resistance. This paper summarizes the recent major IAEA activities to support technology development for water cooled reactors, which is the most common type of reactor design at present and will probably still be in the near future. (author)\n\nFifty years of 'Atoms for Peace'\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHeller, W.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nFifty years ago, on December 8, 1953, the then U.S. President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, in his famous speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed his 'Atoms for Peace' program, which was to initiate a policy of international cooperation. The event had been preceded by a policy of the United States intended to guarantee to the United States the monopoly in the production and use of nuclear weapons, which ultimately failed because of the resistance of the Soviet Union. The doctrine of a technological monopoly in the nuclear field was to be changed in favor of cooperative ventures under the rigorous control of the United States. The 1954 Atomic Energy Act clearly formulated the will to cooperate. Following a U.S. initiative, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was founded in 1956 to assist in transfers of nuclear technology and assume controlling functions to prevent abuse for non-peaceful purposes. Quite a number of countries used the 'Atoms for Peace' offer to develop nuclear power in very close cooperation with American industry and depending on U.S. nuclear fuel supply. On the whole, 'Atoms for Peace' has paved the way to a worldwide peaceful use of nuclear power. (orig.)\n\nPeace and development: Nuclear energy in the service of humanity.
