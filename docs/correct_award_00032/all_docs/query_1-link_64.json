        "text": "ElBaradei, who was re-elected in September to a third term as the United Nations' supreme atomic honcho, has just received another one of those phone calls that could mean trouble.\n\nA normal life in an abnormal world\n\nHe gazes pensively from a window on the fifth floor of a villa near the Schwarzenberg Palace. ElBaradei insisted on living near the center of Vienna, on a \"normal\" street, among \"normal\" people. He tries to disappear into that normal world as often as possible, the world beyond the sound-proofed, double-pane windows of his office, beyond the endless UN discussions of various threats to the world's continued existence. His favorite time to get away is in the early morning hours, when he hides his face under a baseball cap, jogs through the city's winding streets and alleys and stops to read the paper in a coffeehouse -- all the while hoping not to be recognized.\n\nElBaradei's wife doesn't mind her husband's habit of withdrawing to his study after dinner. She knows that he likes to work late into the night. Sometimes, to take his mind off things, he looks at old family photos displayed on a side table, photos that take him back to his roots, to the beginnings of his career.\n\nHis father was president of Egypt's influential lawyers' association during the reign of pan-Arab autocrat Abd al-Nasser. He fought for freedom of the press and an independent judiciary, and taught these fundamental democratic values to Mohamed and his four siblings. By contrast, other children of similar upper-class families ended up becoming part of the Islamist underground. Ayman al-Zawahri, the son of a professor and nine years younger than ElBaradei, joined the Muslim Brotherhood and later became a mentor for terrorist leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nElBaradei studied law at the University of Cairo. But his belief that democracy was more likely to thrive in the West took him to the United States after he received his law degree. He was awarded a doctorate from the New York University School of Law in 1974.\n\nHis career as a diplomat was equally successful, taking him to the Egyptian-Israeli peace talks at Camp David. ElBaradei joined the UN in 1980 and in 1984 went to Vienna, where he was a senior staff member of the IAEA Secretariat. In 1997, a successor was being sought for the then IAEA director, Hans Blix. But ElBaradei was neither Blix's favorite candidate nor the first choice of the Egyptian delegation. He was ultimately named to the position because other candidates failed -- as an East-West compromise.\n\nNowadays, Blix and ElBaradei insist that they hold one another in the highest regard. Their more tense relationship in the late 1990s may have had something to do with their different styles: the Swede is a man who thrives in the public spotlight, which contrasts to the quiet Egyptian who favors behind-the-scenes, consensual solutions.\n\nContinue reading on page 3\n\nThe two men learned an important lesson in 1991. The inspections that the United Nations imposed upon Iraq after Saddam Hussein's invasion of neighboring Kuwait and first Gulf War revealed that the Iraqis had managed to conceal a secret uranium enrichment program from the IAEA, thereby taking an important first step in the direction of developing nuclear weapons.\n\nSaddam's officials repeatedly tried to obstruct the UN inspectors' efforts. But nuclear facilities cannot be kept secret over time, at least not when inspectors know where to look for them. ElBaradei's team eventually managed to destroy Iraq's nuclear research centers and equipment. When the international inspectors were forced out of Iraq in 1998, they were convinced that they had completely uncovered and destroyed the country's nuclear program. But opinions remained divided over Saddam's chemical and biological weapons programs.\n\nHussein continued to provoke the United Nations. In November 2002, he was forced to yield to international pressure and allow inspectors back into the country, a success ElBaradei attributes to the threat of US military action. However, the search for WMD quickly proved to be an unnecessary farce. Although Saddam was capable of anything, the sanctions had severely diminished Iraq's technological capabilities, and the inspectors were unable to find any evidence of a revived nuclear program.\n\nIt was precisely the opposite of what the administration in Washington wanted to hear, where the decision to go to war with Iraq had apparently been made long ago. US Vice President Dick Cheney insisted that the US government knew \"with absolute certainty\" that Saddam was continuing to pursue his nuclear ambitions. The \"key piece of evidence\" was peddled by British intelligence and presented by an irate George W. Bush in his address to the nation in January 2003: claims that the dictator had secretly tried to buy uranium in the West African nation of Niger.\n\nIt took a few weeks before the \"evidence\" was made available to the IAEA, but less than 48 hours for its inspectors to expose it as a blatant forgery. The minister of Niger who had allegedly signed the agreement with Iraq wasn't even in office at the time.\n\nOne last chance for peace?\n\nBlix and ElBaradei traveled to Baghdad one last time in February 2003. They implored the Iraqi leadership to finally refrain from its provocative behavior. But did their trip truly represent \"one last chance for peace,\" as Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair claimed? Colleagues say that it was ElBaradei's darkest hour, this discrepancy between diplomatic appearance and reality, this charade of arriving in brand-new Land Rovers, of meeting with Iraqi officials in palaces while practically being able to see the bombs that would soon rain down on the city causing imminent suffering of its inhabitants. In early March 2003, ElBaradei appeared before the UN Security Council and argued for a last \"investment in peace,\" for a few more months to allow the inspectors to issue a final report over Iraq. The war began two weeks later.\n\nAt the time, ElBaradei, elegantly and politely presented his case to the Security Council, arguing against the flawed reasoning used by the Bush administration. Is this something that politicians and directors of intelligence can ever forget? Is the CIA's recent surveillance of ElBaradei and the White House's campaign to frustrate his re-appointment a delayed consequence of his remarks in 2003? ElBaradei has a direct answer to these questions: \"Someone once said that it's dangerous to be wrong, but that sometimes it's even more dangerous to be right.\"\n\nIn recent years, ElBaradei and his UN agency have experienced roughly equal measures of success and failure. He has repeatedly noted that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), concluded in 1968, is in urgent need of revision to conform to a changed global environment. Since 1968, the world has gained three new nuclear powers, Israel, India and Pakistan, all non-signatories to the NPT and, according to ElBaradei, \"35 to 40 other states have acquired the technical expertise to build nuclear weapons.\" His idea of a supplementary protocol intended to allow UN inspectors unfettered access to all facilities without significant notice, at least in the signatory states, is beginning to take hold. Sixty-nine countries have already signed the protocol, including Iran. But although it signed the protocol in 2003, its parliament has yet to ratify the document.\n\nThe return of the bomb\n\nDespite ElBaradei's and the IAEA's efforts, the world now faces the risk of a horrific return of nuclear weapons -- and marginalization of the UN weapons inspectors. The IAEA's contributions to the most dramatic of recent discoveries have been negligible. Opposition exile groups exposed Iran's secret nuclear projects at Arak and Natans. Intelligence agencies deserve most of the credit for uncovering the network of Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan. Libya abandoned its nuclear ambitions solely as a result of negotiations with the United States. And the parties to the current six-nation talks over North Korea's nuclear future include the country's neighbors and the United States, but not the United Nations agency charged with nuclear disarmament.\n\nIn recent months, some who know Mohamed ElBaradei well have sensed a new character trait in a man widely viewed as an eternal optimist when it comes to his profession: melancholy over his Sisyphean task. \"He has always liked sentimental films,\" says Laila ElBaradei in London. \"But for some time now he only likes to go and see films that he knows will have a happy end.\"\n\nBut, as Laila believes, all of that will now be eclipsed by the triumph of being awarded the Nobel Prize. \"You really should visit the IAEA,\" she says, \"and you'll see that, as I believe, there is a palpable sense of new optimism in the air.\"\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, housed in a faceless glass high-rise on the banks of the Danube, is a Moloch with a staff of more than 2,300. The IAEA was founded in 1957, in the wake of then US President Dwight Eisenhower's spectacular \"Atoms for Peace\" speech before the UN. Today it has an annual operating budget of $304 million and counts 138 member states from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. Despite its size, the agency still conveys the impression of tremendous cohesion, almost a sense of the familiar. This air of congeniality is due in large part to the agency's director. ElBaradei enjoys great respect among his staff, and not just because he \"captured\" the Nobel Prize.\n\nA bridge between the West and the Middle East\n\nDavid Waller, the American IAEA Deputy Director General and head of the Department of Management, says -- with a touch of criticism for Washington -- that the West ought to clone a man like ElBaradei: \"We need Muslims from the Arab world who have spent much of their professional life in the West and understand both worlds.\"\n\nAnd Laban Coblentz, ElBaradei's speechwriter, knows a thing or two about his boss's high standards. \"He notices every detail and has an elephant's memory, which sometimes causes him to lose patience with incompetent people.\" Coblentz, also an American, was part of the crew of a nuclear submarine during a two-year stint with the US Navy, before embarking on a career monitoring security in nuclear power plants.\n\nElBaradei has suggested that a copy of the Nobel Prize certificate be made for each IAEA employee. He himself has invited both his key staff, as well as his family, to join him at the awards ceremony in Oslo. His mother and his siblings will also attend the three days of banquets, receptions, ceremonies and speeches. ElBaradei will give the keynote speech after receiving the Nobel Prize in the presence of Norwegian King Harald V. It will be his opportunity to once again urgently turn the global public's attention to proliferation as the greatest threat to world peace. And perhaps one of the other speakers will point out the parallels between Alfred Nobel, the man behind the Nobel Prize, who invented dynamite in 1867 and lost his brother in an explosion, and the man being honored this year, the man whose job is to monitor the modern age's vastly more devastating nuclear weapons.\n\nIt will be a festive and at times even a relaxed affair. The musical program will remain a surprise to the very end, although the winner of the prize is traditionally asked to name his requests for performers. ElBaradei has requested Jazz singer Norah Jones and classical cello virtuoso Yo-Yo Ma -- both very relaxing performers.\n\nBut he senses that even the euphoria surrounding the Nobel Prize festivities will hardly banish the worries that plague him and the rest of the world, the images of Hiroshima that have become so deeply imprinted in his mind.\n\nGiven these problems, how nice it would be to be Superman and to save the world with his superhuman powers. But ElBaradei is no Superman, and he is more likely be doomed to feel a bit like a modern Sisyphus, repeatedly pushing a (radioactive) boulder up the mountain and, always at the last possible moment, failing to complete his task -- a parable of power and powerlessness."
