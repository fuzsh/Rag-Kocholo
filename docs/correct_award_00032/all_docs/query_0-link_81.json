        "text": "Among the most prestigious scientific awards in the world are the Nobel Prizes for Chemistry, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine.\n\nAll three of these Nobel Prizes have been presented since 1901, with the Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded by the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet. (For more information about the Nobel Prize, visit nobelprize.org.)\n\nGoing back to the earliest days of the Manhattan Project, the Department of Energy and its predecessor agencies blended cutting-edge research and innovative problem-solving to keep the United States in the forefront of scientific discovery. The 118 Nobel Laureates associated with DOE serve as a proud testimony to both the high quality and the impact of the research underwritten by or associated with the Department.\n\nA list of the 118 DOE-affiliated Nobel Prize winners is provided below."
