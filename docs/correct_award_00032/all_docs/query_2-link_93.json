The United States welcomed the Nobel Peace Prize win for the UN nuclear watchdog(AFP/Dieter Nagl)\n\nMohamed ElBaradei and the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear watchdog agency he heads, won the 2005 Nobel Prize for Peace today.\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee called ElBaradei \"an unafraid advocate\" for nuclear nonproliferation \"at a time when the threat of nuclear arms is again increasing.\"\n\nElBaradei, whose ouster was sought by the Bush administration led by controversial United Nations appointee John Bolton, is a longstanding critic of the president's decision to go to war in Iraq. So was former President Jimmy Carter when he won the prize in 2002, an award widely interpreted as a shot at the Bush administration.\n\nAs the recipient of what many consider the world's most prestigious award, ElBaradei joins a pantheon that includes former President Woodrow Wilson, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Mother Teresa and a host of agencies connected, like the IAEA, with the United Nations, including the U.N. itself and Secretary General Kofi Annan.\n\nNuclear weaponry, and peacemaking, have been the constant themes of the awards, created by the will of Alfred Nobel, the Swede given credit for the development of dynamite.\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee cited ElBaradei and the IAEA \"for their efforts to prevent nuclear energy from being used for military purposes and to ensure that nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is used in the safest possible way.\"\n\nThe Vienna-based IAEA, established under U.N. auspices in 1957, coordinates nuclear safety around the world and monitors materials that could be diverted for weapons use. It has played pivotal investigative roles in four major crises in recent years: Iran, Iraq, North Korea and the nuclear black market run by one of Pakistan's top scientists.\n\n\"The award sends a very strong message,\" the new laureate said at a news conference in Vienna. \"'Keep doing what you are doing -- be impartial, act with integrity', and that is what we intend to do.\n\n\"The advantage of having this recognition today,\" ElBaradei said, \"is that it will strengthen my resolve. The fact that there is overwhelming public support for our work definitely will help to resolve some of the major outstanding issues we are facing today, including North Korea, including Iran and nuclear disarmament.\n\n\"It is a responsibility, but it is also a shot in the arm,\" he said.\n\nDespite the fact that the United States helped install ElBaradei in his job eight years ago, ElBaradei's refusal in 2003 to confirm White House allegations that Iraq's Saddam Hussein had rebuilt his nuclear weapons program lost ElBaradei the U.S. support he had enjoyed.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post last fall, ElBaradei said the day the United States invaded Iraq \"was the saddest in my life.\" It was not because he was a fan of Hussein,\n\nbut because he was so sure Washington's assertions about weapons stockpiles and a secret program would be proved wrong.\n\nWashington responded to ElBaradei's findings on Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction by trying to prevent him from taking a third term, despite requests from other board members that he stay on. \"I am staying because I was asked, because so many board members made me feel guilty about leaving at such a crucial time,\" he said in an interview earlier this year.\n\nThe Bush administration launched a vigorous but solitary campaign -- including a complete halt of intelligence sharing, recruitment of potential replacements for ElBaradei and eavesdropping on him in search of ammunition against him. But as his popularity diminished in Washington, it soared elsewhere.\n\nNobel Committee chairman Ole Danbolt Mjoes said the prize was not a veiled criticism of Washington, wire services reported.\n\n\"This is not a kick in the legs to any country,\" he told a news conference. A former chairman had described the 2002 prize to Carter as a \"kick in the legs\" to Bush.\n\nOne expert said the prize would have been less controversial if it had gone to the IAEA alone. ElBaradei's inclusion \"is an implicit criticism of the United States,\" said Stein Toennesson, head of the Peace Research Institute, Oslo.\n\nElBaradei was virtually unknown when the United States engineered his candidacy eight years ago to run the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency. He was a soft-spoken lawyer then, who left the Middle East of his youth for New York, first as a diplomat, then as an academic and finally as a career U.N. servant.\n\n\"What more could we ask for than a smart, respected Egyptian who cares passionately about the New York Knicks and nuclear nonproliferation?\" said John Ritch, a former U.S. ambassador to the IAEA who was instrumental in ElBaradei's selection.\n\nThough ElBaradei lacked any experience leading a major institution, U.S. support was enough for him to beat the only other contender -- a South Korean whose own country abstained -- in a 34 to 0 vote that launched ElBaradei's tenure as director general of the IAEA.\n\nElBaradei became a champion in the eyes of many who opposed the war in Iraq, especially those in the Arab world. He is often asked for autographs, and occasionally applauded, when he lands in Arab capitals and is one of the most sought-after officials for media interviews.\n\nPrivately, Bush administration officials acknowledge that the IAEA's Iran investigation, now in its third year, has been thorough and that the agency has uncovered far more than U.S. intelligence could have learned without it.\n\nThe work and the war have changed ElBaradei, who is 63. He still shuns the social circuit and prefers to spend most evenings at home with his wife in Vienna, but he has become far more vocal in recent years.\n\nWhen this story was posted in September 2005, this was on the front page of PCOL:\n\nPeace Corps Online The Independent News Forum serving Returned Peace Corps Volunteers Returned Volunteers respond to Hurricane Katrina\n\nFirst and foremost, Give. Carol Bellamy says \"In situations such as this one, money is needed the most\" and added that Hurricane Katrina's impact on New Orleans is comparable to last year's tsunami. Thailand RPCV Thomas Tighe's Direct Relief International has committed an initial $250,000 in cash to assist hurricane victims. Mayor Tom Murphy (RPCV Paraguay) says Pittsburgh is ready to embrace refugees from devastated areas. Mark Shriver of Save the Children says it will assist rural communities it serves in rebuilding. Brazil RPCV Robert Backus is among the first Vermont doctors to volunteer to travel to Louisiana to treat victims. Ohio Governor Bob Taft (RPCV Tanzania) says students displaced by \"Katrina\" can enroll in Ohio Colleges and Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle (RPCV Tunisia) is sending soldiers to help residents of Louisiana. Do you know what it means to lose New Orleans? Contact your local Red Cross to Volunteer. Military Option sparks concerns\n\nThe U.S. military, struggling to fill its voluntary ranks, is allowing recruits to meet part of their reserve military obligations after active duty by serving in the Peace Corps. Read why there is opposition to the program among RPCVs. Director Vasquez says the agency has a long history of accepting qualified applicants who are in inactive military status. John Coyne says \"Not only no, but hell no!\" and RPCV Chris Matthews leads the debate on \"Hardball.\" Latest: Avi Spiegel says Peace Corps is not the place for soldiers while Coleman McCarthy says to Welcome Soldiers to the Peace Corps. RPCVs: Read our poll results. Why blurring the lines puts PCVs in danger\n\nWhen the National Call to Service legislation was amended to include Peace Corps in December of 2002, this country had not yet invaded Iraq and was not in prolonged military engagement in the Middle East, as it is now. Read the story of how one volunteer spent three years in captivity from 1976 to 1980 as the hostage of a insurrection group in Colombia in Joanne Marie Roll's op-ed on why this legislation may put soldier/PCVs in the same kind of danger.
