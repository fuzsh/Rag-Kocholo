        "text": "Muhammad el-Baradei (file photo) (CTK) Prague 7 October 2005 (RFE/RL) -- The United Nations' nuclear watchdog and its chief have won this year's Nobel Peace Prize. The award, one of the world's top accolades, went to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Muhammad el-Baradei for their efforts against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe head of the Norwegian Nobel committee, Ole Danbolt Mjoes, made the announcement at the Nobel Institute in Oslo. \"The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2005 is to be shared in two equal parts between the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and its director-general, Muhammad el-Baradei, for their efforts to prevent nuclear energy from being used for military purposes and to ensure that nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is used in the safest possible way,\" Mjoes said.\n\nPrize 'Will Strengthen My Resolve'\n\nEl-Baradei, speaking at the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna, said the decision was an \"absolute surprise.\" He added that the recognition will help the agency as it tackles nuclear disputes about Iran and North Korea.\n\n\"I think the prize recognizes the number one danger we are facing today, and that is the threat of proliferation of nuclear weapons, the continuing existence of thousands of nuclear weapons, and the prospect of nuclear terrorism,\" el-Baradei said. \"The [Nobel] committee recognizes that these dangers and others can only be resolved through the broadest possible international cooperation and recognizes, in awarding the award to the agency [IAEA] and myself, the role of multilateralism in resolving all the challenges we are facing today. The prize will strengthen my resolve and that of my colleagues to continue to speak truth to power, to continue to speak our minds. We have no hidden agenda except to ensure that our world continues to be safe and humane.\"\n\nControversial Choice?\n\nThe Egyptian el-Baradei has led the UN nuclear agency since 1997 through a succession of nuclear crises from Iraq to North Korea. His work has won him many plaudits -- but also criticism. In the run-up to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq two years ago, he annoyed the United States when he stood by findings that there was no evidence Saddam Hussein’s regime had restarted its nuclear weapons development program.\n\nMore recently, the IAEA has found Iran in noncompliance with international nuclear proliferation safeguards. The agency’s board of governors stated last month that Tehran will be referred to the UN Security Council if it fails to alter its nuclear policy. Mjoes said that at a time when the threat of nuclear arms is again increasing el-Baradei had \"stood out as an unafraid advocate\" of new measures to strengthen the regime of nuclear nonproliferation.\n\n\"At a time when disarmament efforts appear deadlocked, when there is a danger that nuclear arms will spread both to states and to terrorist groups, and when nuclear power again appears to be playing an increasingly significant role, IAEA's work is of incalculable importance,\" Mjoes said. He noted that he shared the prize with the IAEA as a whole, saying, \"the prize has been awarded not only to me, but to the agency (IAEA), to every single staff member of the agency, and I am very gratified for that because it is [because of] these wonderful men and women, whom you see around you here, that we are where we are today.\"\n\nIAEA spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said earlier that it was the agency's proudest moment.\n\nGlobal Reaction\n\nCongratulations have been quick to come in from around the world. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was delighted, saying the prize was a welcome reminder of the need to address nuclear disarmament. French President Jacques Chirac, speaking at a joint press conference with U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair in Paris, congratulated el-Baradei. Blair added his praise as well.\n\n\"I endorse entirely [President Chirac's] congratulations to Mr. el-Baradei and to the Atomic Energy Agency on the receipt of the Nobel Prize,\" Blair said. \"It is well deserved and very important and shows the significance that is attached to the work that that agency does.\"\n\nNot Entirely Unexpected\n\nThe IAEA and el-Baradei had been tipped as front-runners for the Nobel Prize, partly because nuclear crises over Iran and North Korea have dominated headlines this year. It's also 60 years since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nLast year. the peace prize went to Kenyan environmentalist Wangari Maathai for her campaign to plant trees across Africa. That all led to speculation that this year the prize would go to an individual or organization more engaged in peace or disarmament efforts.\n\nIn his will, Alfred Nobel, the man who founded the prize, listed disarmament as a key criterion -- something the committee mentioned in their citation today.\n\n(compiled from agency reports)\n\nFor RFE/RL's complete coverage of the controversy surrounding Iran's nuclear program, see \"Iran's Nuclear Program.\"\n\nIran's Nuclear Program\n\nIran's Nuclear Program\n\nTHE COMPLETE PICTURE: RFE/RL's complete coverage of controversy surrounding Iran's nuclear program.\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\nAn annotated timeline of Iran's nuclear program.\n\nThe homes of several Afghan migrants in the southern Iranian city of Khur have reportedly been set on fire in apparent retaliation for the killing of an Iranian man allegedly by an Afghan national.\n\nHosna, an Afghan who lives in Khur, told RFE/RL’s Radio Azadi on July 19 that he moved his family from Khur to Shiraz in Fars Province out of fear for their safety.\n\n\"People in the region are very angry and set homes of several Afghans on fire,\" he claimed.\n\nHosna and others who spoke to Radio Azadi attributed the anger to the July 3 killing of a 62-year-old restaurant owner in the town of Khenj by his 17-year-old apprentice. Iranian media have not identified the nationality of the suspected killer, but Hosna said the suspect was an Afghan citizen.\n\n\"The people of the region have sworn not to sell 1 kilogram of meat, or even a piece of bread, to Afghan nationals,\" Hosna said. \"So, many were forced to flee to Shiraz.\"\n\nAnti-Afghan sentiment in Iran has been on the rise in recent years, especially after a mass influx of migrants following the Taliban's return to power in August 2021.\n\nOccasionally, a hashtag that describes the expulsion of Afghan migrants as a \"national demand\" becomes a top trend on X, formerly Twitter, often boosted by anonymous accounts.\n\nLast week, an unsubstantiated claim on social media blamed Afghan migrants for an alleged rise in leprosy cases in Iran.\n\nThe UN’s refugee agency says Iran hosts around 780,000 Afghan refugees, in addition to some 2.6 million undocumented Afghan migrants. But Iran claimed last year that the number of illegal Afghan immigrants was closer to 5 million.\n\nThe authorities have vowed to deport illegal refugees and hundreds of Afghan migrants are sent back to Afghanistan every day. They are also banned from living or working in half of Iran's 31 provinces.\n\nAfghans living in Iran have complained to Radio Azadi about rising harassment, even during deportation.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:04:13 0:00\n\nTehran has for years maintained that it does not receive sufficient financial aid from international organizations to handle the number of refugees on its soil.\n\nTehran is upping the ante in its effort to go after Iranian Kurds abroad it deems \"terrorists,\" demanding that Baghdad extradite leaders and members of Iranian-Kurdish opposition groups based in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region.\n\n\"A list of nearly 120 terrorists who identify themselves as noble Kurds has been sent to Iraq for extradition and their trial will be held soon,\" Iranian judiciary official Kazem Gharibabadi said on July 13.\n\nGharibabadi did not reveal the names on the list. But he said that preparations had been made for the trial of \"leaders and members\" of a \"terrorist group.\"\n\nKurdish and Iraqi media have reported that the list contains the names of some 120 leaders and members of Iranian-Kurdish groups opposed to Tehran.\n\nMany of these groups were armed, with some demanding autonomy within Iran and others fighting for secession from the Islamic republic. Kurds make up around 10 percent of Iran's population of some 88 million and primarily live in the country's west along the border with Iraq.\n\nGharibabadi cast the move as part of a broader effort to fight terrorism, saying that similar extradition requests would be sent to \"relevant foreign countries.\"\n\nBut the move follows backlash to Iran's strong-armed approach in Iraqi Kurdistan, including deadly air strikes that have targeted Iranian-Kurdish opposition groups as well as alleged Israeli targets.\n\nMembers of Kurdish opposition parties cast the pressure by Iran, which follows the signing last year of a security pact between Tehran and Baghdad, as misguided cover for undermining the Kurdish independence movement.\n\nMany Iranian-Kurdish political parties and factions opposed to the Islamic Republic of Iran are based in Iraq's Kurdistan region. That includes the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the most prominent exile opposition faction; Komala, a leftist group; and Free Life Party of Kurdistan (PJAK), the Iranian offshoot of Turkey's Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and designated by Washington as a terrorist group.\n\nTehran has long accused unspecified Kurdish opposition groups, without providing evidence, of coordinating with Israel, its archfoe, to stage attacks on Iran from Iraqi Kurdistan. Kurdish opposition groups deny the allegation.\n\nCross-Border Strikes\n\nIn a security pact agreed between Tehran and Iraq's central government in March 2023, Baghdad agreed to secure Iraqi Kurdistan's lengthy eastern border with Iran, as well as to disarm and relocate Iranian-Kurdish opposition groups based in the region.\n\nMany offices of Kurdish parties that oppose Tehran have since been shut down.\n\nBaghdad's dealings with Iran have been fraught with controversy. Multiple strikes have been carried out by Iran in the Kurdistan region, including a missile attack on the headquarters of the PDKI in the Kuisanjaq district in 2018 that killed 15 members of the party's leadership as well as Peshmerga forces.\n\nIn 2022, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps again targeted the PDKI, as well as Komala, with missile and drone strikes in the regional capital, Irbil, and the city of Sulaymaniyah in the east of the Kurdistan region.\n\nLast year, protests broke out in Iraqi Kurdistan over the construction of a security fence along the region's border with Iran. And tensions rose significantly between Iraq's central government and Tehran after Iran carried out missile strikes in January against what it said were Israeli targets, killing four people in Irbil.\n\nAfter Tehran reached out to resolve its differences with Baghdad, the head of the semiautonomous region, Nechirvan Barzani, visited Iran in May and met with top officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nBarzani gave a commitment in writing that Irbil would work to disarm \"terrorist groups\" and ensure their removal from the Kurdistan region.\n\nWhile Iran claims the alleged anti-Iranian activities of such groups to be a key security challenge, representatives of Iranian-Kurdish factions who spoke to RFE/RL's Radio Farda denied that assertion and suggested that Tehran had ulterior motives.\n\nReza Kaabi, secretary-general of Komala, said that Iran had focused its pressure on Kurdish parties by targeting them with \"missiles, drones, and long-range weapons.\"\n\nBut in reality, he said, \"the Islamic republic has actually targeted the Kurdish people's liberation movement.\"\n\nFears Of Kurdish Independence\n\nIraq's Kurdistan region held an independence referendum in 2017 that was overwhelmingly approved by voters with more than 92 percent in favor.\n\nKurdish leaders suggested the vote, which was opposed by Baghdad, would not lead immediately to independence. But neighboring states like Iran, Syria, and Turkey -- which have large ethnic Kurdish populations -- saw the referendum as a troubling sign of possible secession.\n\nAfter the referendum, the Iraqi military took control of Irbil and the oil-rich city of Kirkuk from Peshmerga forces, prompting the government in Iraqi Kurdistan to renounce the referendum and to negotiate with Baghdad.\n\nThe regional government later announced that it was \"committed to responsible behavior in order to prevent further violence and conflicts.\"\n\nSami Rikani, an independent political activist who resides in the Kurdistan region, says that in the aftermath, pressure from Iran and Turkey increased.\n\n\"Especially after the referendum on the independence of the Kurdistan region of Iraq in 2017, Iran and Turkey came to the conclusion that they should start the process of confronting the Kurdish groups,\" Rikani said.\n\nThe recent demand by Tehran for Baghdad to expel leaders and members of Iranian-Kurdish groups is in keeping with this strategy as well as a security agreement signed between Iraq and Turkey in 2016, Rikani adds.\n\nTurkey has also recently increased its military measures and operations in the Kurdistan region of Iraq with the aim of \"combating the Kurdish groups opposed to the Ankara government,\" according to Ankara.\n\nThe question now, considering Iraq's subsequent security pact inked with Iran last year, is whether Baghdad will acquiesce to Tehran's demand.\n\nNeither Iraq's central government nor the government of the Kurdistan region immediately responded to the extradition request.\n\nWritten by Michael Scollon based on reporting by Iliya Jazaeri of RFE/RL's Radio Farda\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump has been in Tehran's crosshairs ever since he ordered the killing of top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in neighboring Iraq in 2020.\n\nTehran has repeatedly vowed to avenge Soleimani, and many officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have alluded to killing Trump and other senior members of his administration on U.S. soil.\n\n“We will prepare the ground to exact vengeance on the Americans from within their homes, using their companions,” Esmail Qaani, who succeeded Soleimani as the commander of the Quds Force, the overseas arm of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), said in January 2022.\n\nWATCH: An animated video posted on Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's website that envisions a drone strike on Donald Trump:\n\nAnimation On Khamenei’s Website Showcasing Trump Drone Strike\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:01:47 0:00\n\nU.S. media reported on July 16 that the Secret Service had enhanced Trump’s security detail after receiving intelligence in recent weeks that Iran was plotting to assassinate him. Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee in the November 5 presidential election.\n\nThe alleged plot appeared to be unrelated to the failed attempt on Trump’s life on July 13, the reports said.\n\n“Plotting to kill a foreign leader, particularly an American presidential candidate, marks a significant leap in the crassness and risk-tolerance of the clerical regime,” said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank.\n\nIran has long been accused of carrying out assassinations, including of Iranian dissidents, on foreign soil, although it has always denied responsibility.\n\nOne of the most high-profile incidents was the 1991 killing of Shapur Bakhtiar, the last prime minister of Iran before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Bakhtiar was shot dead in his home in France, in a killing that was widely blamed on Tehran.\n\n“Iran has not been successful in such endeavors in recent years, and its activities tend to aim at disruption rather than assassinating former or potential heads of state,” said Gregory Brew, an Iran analyst at the U.S.-based Eurasia Group.\n\nHe said while it was “unclear whether Iran's intelligence services are up to the task,” Trump’s close call on July 13 brings “into question any confidence that the Secret Service can keep him totally safe from harm.”\n\nTaleblu said it would therefore be a mistake to dismiss Iran’s threats.\n\nThe Secret Service has been criticized since a 20-year-old gunman shot at Trump at a rally in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, grazing the former president’s ear and killing a member of the crowd.\n\n'Legal Route' To Avenge Soleimani\n\nDespite public declarations by senior Iranian figures about the desire to avenge Soleimani by killing Trump, Iranian diplomats have dismissed reports linking Tehran to plots to assassinate the former president.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said on July 16 thatTehran was “determined to prosecute Trump” while the Iranian mission to the UN insisted that the Islamic republic had “chosen the legal route” to hold him accountable.\n\nSeparately, Acting Foreign Minister Ali Baqeri Kani said Iran “will resort to legal and judicial procedures…at the domestic and international level.”\n\nTaleblu said the comments by Iranian officials were in line with the “standard division of labor” in Tehran’s security policy.\n\n“The Foreign Ministry tries to nullify threats through changes in style, while the IRGC and others are able to press ahead with the same sort of terror and destabilization in substance,” he added.\n\nIn December, a Tehran court ordered the U.S. government to pay nearly $50 billion in damages for assassinating Soleimani. The court convicted Trump and 41 other U.S. officials over the assassination.\n\nSaid Mahmoudi, professor of international law at Stockholm University, told RFE/RL’s Radio Farda that Iranian court cases against Trump were only for show and lacked credibility.\n\n“It is very, very unusual for a [foreign] country…to prosecute Trump. Only international courts are equipped to do this,” he said, adding that international law does not allow domestic courts to prosecute current and former heads of state based on local laws.\n\nPotential Impact on Tehran-Washington Ties\n\nTrump is currently leading President Joe Biden in most opinion polls ahead of the November election and some argue the assassination attempt could, at least temporarily, provide a boost to his chances.\n\nReports of an alleged Iranian plot against Trump’s life could torpedo attempts by reformist President-elect Masud Pezeshkian to tone down Iran’s anti-West rhetoric, Damon Golriz, a lecturer at The Hague University of Applied Sciences, told Radio Farda.\n\nBrew said Trump might be “even more hostile towards Iran” if elected but noted that the hostility is mutual.\n\n“It should temper any expectations of forward progress, on the nuclear issue or any other policy area, in the event Trump wins November's election,” he added.\n\nWith reporting by Reza Jamali and Hooman Askary of RFE/RL’s Radio Farda.\n\nThe chief of police in Iran's Alborz Province said on July 17 that women who took part in an Ashura procession in the city of Karaj without hijabs have been \"identified and summoned.\"\n\nA video posted on Instagram shows a number of young women, most wearing dark clothing but no head scarves, walking in the street in observance of Ashura, a commemoration of the martyrdom of Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, which is marked mainly by Shi'ite Muslims.\n\nTo mourn his death, Shi’a wear black during Ashura processions in which many participants beat their backs with chains in a symbolic expression of regret for not being able to help Hussein before his death.\n\nThe video of the procession in Karaj on July 16 has been met with widespread reactions on social media.\n\nHamid Hadavand, the chief of police in Alborz Province, claimed that the publication of the video and others like it had led to \"hurting the feelings of Hossein's mourners\" throughout the country.\n\nHadavand accused the individuals seen in the videos of \"desecration,\" adding that all of them \"have been summoned to the Alborz Province police after being identified.\"\n\nHe did not say how many people were summoned or how they were identified.\n\nIn addition, the head of the Organization of Religious Boards and Organizations revoked the permission granted to the organization that held the Ashura procession in which the young women took part without hijabs.\n\nMajid Babakhani also announced that the head of the organization had been \"summoned\" with the help of the police and said that he would be dealt with legally.\n\nAshura is marked on the 10th day of Muharram, the first month of the Muslim calendar. Last year Muharram was also marked by reports of the identification and detention of women without compulsory hijabs across Iran.\n\nAuthorities have stepped up confrontations with people who oppose the mandatory hijab law since protests that followed the death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran's morality police in September 2022 for allegedly improperly wearing her hijab, and there have been frequent reports of violence against detainees.\n\nIn recent months, the police again started a security crackdown on women flaunting the compulsory hijab law by reimplementing the Plan Noor initiative under which the morality police strictly enforce dress codes. This has led to several incidents of violence against women challenging the mandatory head scarf.\n\nBefore the reimplementation of the Plan Noor initiative the city of Tehran and the Interior Ministry prior employed hijab guards in some subway stations. The interior minister and the mayor of Tehran denied playing any role in this.\n\nDespite these measures, the presence of women and girls without compulsory hijabs in public in Iran has not stopped over the past two years.\n\nIran is set to swear in moderate reformist Masud Pezeshkian as president early next month. Pezeshkian has said that while the hijab law should be observed, \"there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behavior toward women.\"\n\nKiana and Ali Rahmani were only 8 years old when they left Iran to reunite with their father, Taqi Rahmani, who had fled the country as the Iranian authorities sought to arrest him.\n\nTheir mother, activist Narges Mohammadi, could only imagine the scene from her jail cell as her children would be taken from her for an \"unknown\" period of time and endure a \"separation that would make me a stranger to my children and them unfamiliar to me.\"\n\n“I haven’t seen my mom in nine years. I have become used to growing up without a mother,” Kiana, now 17, told Roya Maleki of RFE/RL’s Radio Farda as she marked another anniversary of separation from her mother on July 16.\n\n“My father is a good dad; he has been both a father and a mother,” she added.\n\nIn a statement posted on her website on July 16, Mohammadi recalled staying awake through the night in her prison cell on July 16, 2015, knowing her children would be on a plane to France soon.\n\nThe separation, she said, “felt like vanishing into a misty void of lost connections, tearing a mother and her children apart, leaving us in an indescribable abyss of heartache and longing.”\n\n\"A separation that would turn me into an unfamiliar woman to my children, bearing the name ‘mother’ in a ‘misplaced’ manner,\" she added.\n\nMohammadi, 52, has been campaigning for human rights in Iran for decades and has been in and out of prison in the last 20 years. She has been convicted five times since March 2021 and is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence.\n\nShe is currently in jail for “spreading propaganda” against the Islamic republic.\n\nKiana recalls that it was “difficult” going through adolescence as a young girl without her mother, forcing her to turn to her friends and other women for advice.\n\n“I had to learn things that a mother should teach her daughter. I had to ask my friends or their mothers whenever I had a question because I did not have a mother,” she said.\n\nDespite remaining behind bars for so long, Mohammadi has remained at the forefront of Iran's women's rights movement.\n\nHer efforts were honored last October when she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Her children accepted the award on her behalf in December.\n\nKiana said the award raised her mother’s spirits but worsened her conditions in prison because it led to further restrictions, such as limited visiting privileges and phone calls.\n\nDespite not seeing their mother for half of their lives, Ali said they had learned from their mother to “defend our brothers and sisters” from the Middle East.\n\n“We come from a place where there is little freedom and war is constant,” he added.\n\nIn her statement, Mohammadi bemoaned that not seeing her children for so long would make her a “stranger” to them.\n\n“I hope my children understand that I, like all imprisoned mothers…was a loving mother whose heart still aches with overwhelming sorrow for her children,” she wrote.\n\nWritten by Kian Sharifi based on an interview by Roya Maleki of RFE/RL’s Radio Farda.\n\nAn unsubstantiated claim on social media linking an alleged rise in leprosy cases in Iran to the country’s Afghan community has resulted in renewed calls for the expulsion of Afghan migrants.\n\nIranian media have cited the Health Ministry as reporting nine new cases of leprosy over the past year. The reports said three of those afflicted were Afghans.\n\nThe same day, a freelance Iranian journalist who advocates for the expulsion of Afghan refugees alleged without evidence that “Afghan migrants” were responsible for spreading leprosy in Iran.\n\nHe incorrectly charged that “no cases of leprosy had been seen in Iran in years” -- a claim that is easily debunked by data available on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) website.\n\nOn July 9, another journalist who often writes in support of expelling Afghan migrants went as far as calling the alleged rise in leprosy cases “bioterrorism” and demanded that the incoming government of President-elect Masud Pezeshkian “start deporting Afghans.”\n\n“Afghans are bringing and spreading the leprosy virus,” he wrote without offering evidence, falsely claiming that leprosy, which is caused by bacteria, is a viral disease.\n\nBoth posts on the social media platform X have received nearly half a million views, been shared more than 1,000 times, and liked by over 7,000 accounts.\n\nWhat Does The Data Say?\n\nLeprosy in Iran has never been eliminated, but it has declined sharply since 2005, dropping from 79 to six in 2022, according to WHO data. No certified health authority has ever declared leprosy an epidemic in Iran or Afghanistan.\n\nLeprosy is a chronic bacterial infectious disease that mainly affects the skin and peripheral nerves. It is curable but leaving it untreated may cause permanent disabilities.\n\nThe disease spreads via droplets from the nose and mouth through close and frequent contact with untreated individuals.\n\nRising Anti-Afghan Sentiment\n\nAfghans fleeing the Soviet invasion in the 1980s were welcomed in Iran, thanks in large part to the anti-Soviet views of the recently established Islamic republic. But animosity toward the growing Afghan community has only worsened since.\n\nIn recent years -- especially after an influx of migrants following the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021 -- there have been more frequent displays of anti-Afghan sentiment.\n\nOver the past several months, a Persian hashtag that calls the “expulsion of Afghans” a “national demand” has been trending, often boosted by anonymous accounts.\n\nThe UNHCR, the United Nations’ refugee agency, says Iran hosts 780,000 Afghan refugees, in addition to 2.6 million undocumented Afghan nationals.\n\nBut the authorities in Tehran claimed last year that 5 million Afghans were living in Iran illegally, and vowed to deport them. Afghan migrants were later banned from living or working in half of the country’s 31 provinces.\n\nIn recent months, Afghan migrants in Iran have complained to RFE/RL's Radio Azadi about rising harassment, even during deportation.\n\nIran has long said that it does not receive enough financial assistance from international bodies to deal with the number of refugees on its soil.\n\nThe world has long been aware of the scourge of apartheid -- the systemic segregation or discrimination of people based on their race. But what about the institutionalized practice of singling people out for ill-treatment due to their gender?\n\nThe push to recognize \"gender apartheid\" under international law is gaining steam, with oppression against women and girls in Afghanistan and Iran fueling calls for immediate action, but tremendous obstacles remain.\n\nWhat Do They Want?\n\nAdvocates want to clearly define gender apartheid as a crime under international law. Currently, only \"persecution\" on the basis of gender is recognized as a crime against humanity. But rights groups and activists say the concept of persecution does not fully capture the scope of the abuses committed under a system of institutionalized gender apartheid.\n\nThe goal is for the United Nations to make up for this gap by legally shielding women and girls from systemic abuse and violence.\n\nAfghan women's rights defenders are credited with being the first to articulate the concept of gender apartheid in the 1990s, during the Taliban's first regime.\n\nSince the Taliban returned to power in 2021, the hard-line Islamist group has reimposed its oppressive policies against women and girls, including severe restrictions on their appearances, freedom of movement, and right to work and study.\n\nHoda Khamosh, an Afghan women's rights activist, says the recognition of gender apartheid would greatly benefit women's rights in the country.\n\n\"We would be able to hold accountable the authorities and perpetrators of gender-based violence and discrimination against women,\" Khamosh told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi.\n\nMeanwhile, Iranian women’s rights activists have said the institutionalized discrimination against women in the Islamic republic amounts to gender apartheid.\n\nUN experts have said the violent enforcement of the hijab law and punishments on women and girls who fail to wear the head scarf could be described as a form of gender apartheid.\n\nWhen Do They Want It?\n\nToday. The United Nations has been considering the adoption of a major treaty that would unite signatories against crimes against humanity.\n\nDozens of rights groups and hundreds of individuals signed a statement in March calling for gender apartheid to be included on the draft list of such crimes.\n\nThe hope is that the UN General Assembly will adopt procedures to begin negotiations on the treaty when it next meets in September.\n\nTough Going\n\nWhile the concept of gender apartheid has increasingly been used by the United Nations and international organizations, particularly in connection with abuses against women and girls in Afghanistan and Iran, there have also been missed opportunities.\n\nDuring UN-hosted talks in Doha with the Taliban in early July, for example, women did not have a seat at the table.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:46 0:00\n\nRights activists calling for the recognition of gender apartheid and for sanctions to be imposed on those responsible accused the UN of giving legitimacy to the Taliban's rule and of betraying its commitment to women's rights.\n\n\"The international community has a moral obligation to ensure the protection of Afghan women’s rights and uphold the principles of justice and equality in any engagement with the Taliban,\" Sima Samar, former chairperson of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), told CIVICUS, a global alliance of civil society organizations.\n\nImprisonment And Death In Iran\n\nLike the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran's clerical regime has been labeled a \"gender apartheid regime\" by rights watchdogs.\n\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian human rights activist who lives in exile, is among the key signatories of a global effort to End Gender Apartheid Today.\n\nThe movement, highlighting the international community's successful effort to end apartheid in South Africa decades ago, noted that women in Iran are banned from many fields of study, sporting events, and from obtaining a passport or traveling outside the country without their husband's consent.\n\nThe Iranian authorities' goal is to maintain women's subjugation to men and the state through a system of laws, the movement said. Violations can lead to \"violence, imprisonment, and death.\"\n\n\"The situations in the Islamic Republic of Iran and under the Taliban in Afghanistan are not simply cases of gender discrimination,\" the movement concluded in its call for support.\n\n\"Rather, these systems are perpetuating a more extreme, systematic, and structural war against women designed to dehumanize and repress them for purposes of entrenching power.”\n\nWritten by Michael Scollon with reporting by RFE/RL's Radio Azadi\n\nIn the early morning of July 9, 1999, students at Tehran University were sleeping off a long day of demonstrating for reforms in Iran when they were awakened to brutal reality.\n\nPlainclothes police and paramilitary volunteers stormed into dormitories, kicking in doors and beating students in their rooms. Some were thrown from windows and at least one student was killed, while hundreds were injured.\n\nWhat had begun as relatively low-level demonstrations against the closure days earlier of a reformist newspaper wouldquickly spread from the capital to other major cities.\n\nOver the course of a few days, at least five protesters would be left dead, hundreds injured, and thousands more detained in what would stand for a decade as the largest antiestablishment protests in Iran since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.\n\nLooking back at the events 25 years later, a former student who unwittingly became the face of the demonstrations against the clerical establishment says the protesters truly believed they could help usher in societal and structural reforms promoted by the reformist political camp.\n\n\"We thought reforms represented a new paradigm, driven by individuals genuinely different and committed to change,\" Ahmad Batebi told RFE/RL's Radio Farda.\n\nThat the violent crackdown came during the presidency of the country's last reformist president, Mohammad Khatami -- who was elected in 1997 on promises of strengthening the rule of law and greater social freedoms -- no longer comes as a surprise.\n\n\"Time has shown that the reformists were not fundamentally different from those entrenched in power, [they were] just simply another facet of the Islamic republic,\" he said.\n\nBatebi was one of thousands of reform-minded Iranian students who took to the streets after the dormitory raid in open defiance of the establishment.\n\nWhen the cover of the British magazine The Economist showed him holding up the blood-stained shirt of a fellow protester who had been shot by security forces in Tehran, it awakened the outside world to the demonstrations.\n\nBut the now-iconic photo also attracted the attention of the Iranian authorities. Batebi was arrested and sentenced to death for his alleged involvement in \"street unrest.\"\n\nNamed a prisoner of conscience by rights groups, Batebi's sentence was eventually reduced to 15 years due to international pressure. He served nine years before fleeing to neighboring Iraq while on medical leave to treat the many ailments he suffered in prison and eventually moved to the United States.\n\nBatebi said that the Islamic republic relied on violent repression from its beginning, pointing to the mass executions of political prisoners in the 1980s and deadly crackdowns against protests in the cities of Mashhad, Qazvin, and Eslamshahr in the 1990s.\n\n\"The Islamic republic habitually employed such methods of suppression, recognizing no other approach,\" Batebi said.\n\nThe harsh response to the student protests of 1999 was \"not unusual,\" Batebi added, because \"the government was accustomed to and prepared for such actions, and knew no other way to operate.\"\n\nThose events simply foreshadowed the establishment's method of dealing with subsequent antiestablishment protests, including student demonstrations in 2003, mass demonstrations against the results of the disputed 2009 presidential election and the suppression of the Green Movement.\n\n\"This is the inherent nature of the Islamic republic and it will continue to operate in this manner,\" Batebi said.\n\nHe also addressed more recent protests, including the 2019-20 protests fueled by water shortages and economic woes, and the Women, Life, Freedom protests of 2022.\n\nAs many as 1,500 demonstrators were reportedly killed during the nationwide protests that broke out in 2019. More than 550 demonstrators were killed in the crackdown against the 2022 protests, which followed the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini and lasted for months.\n\nHuman rights watchdogs say the response was marked by a litany of atrocities carried out by the state, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and rape.\n\nBatebi said the level of suppression to which the state will go has \"surpassed what was experienced at the university dormitories\" in 1999, which was by far eclipsed in scale and in violence by the 2009, 2019, and 2022 protests.\n\nBut so too has the involvement of the general population, he added.\n\n\"Initially, the student movement was at the forefront of social protests, making their suppression highly visible,\" Batebi said. \"However, over the past decade, every segment of society, from teachers to workers and nurses, has been involved.\"\n\nThe former student protester said he saw a \"significant maturity and sophistication among today's activists\" in Iran. But he laments that the reforms the students of his era fought for, including greater political and social freedoms, are essentially dead.\n\n\"From the reform movement that once sought structural changes, only a name remains,\" he said. \"The reforms we see today are vastly different from those initial aspirations and are, in fact, part of the government, deviating slightly from its authoritarian segment while attempting to realign with the long-standing governmental ideals.\"\n\nThe recent victory of Masud Pezeshkian -- who cast himself as a reformist during Iran's snap presidential election after ultraconservative Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May -- will make no real difference, according to Batebi.\n\nBatebi expressed doubt over Pezeshkian's \"reformist\" credentials, but pondered for argument's sake what could happen if he deviated from his alignment with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei or from Raisi's policies.\n\nEven if he Pezeshkian was a \"true democrat, genuinely modern, and eager to implement changes in Iran, how would he achieve this?\" Batebi asked. \"The tools for change are lacking in Iran. There are no institutions outside the supreme leader's control.\"\n\nThis includes the judiciary, media, security forces and military, the Intelligence Ministry, and all influential government bodies \"that could obstruct presidential initiatives\" in domestic and foreign policy.\n\n\"The situation is clear,\" Batebi concluded. \"Regardless of an individual's democratic intentions or transformative aspirations, without the necessary instruments for change, substantial reform is unattainable. Therefore, in my view, the potential for change is virtually nonexistent.\"\n\nWritten by Michael Scollon based on an interview by Nasrin Afshar of RFE/RL's Radio Farda\n\nModerate reformist Masud Pezeshkian, the winner of Iran's runoff presidential vote, will be sworn in before lawmakers early next month, Mojtaba Yosefi, a member of the Iranian parliament's presiding board, told state media.\n\nPezeshkian defeated ultraconservative hard-liner Saeed Jalili in the July 5 runoff, garnering 53.7 percent of the vote, or 16,384,403 votes, while Jalili received 44.3 percent, or 13,538,179 votes, according to final results announced by the Interior Ministry.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate power in Iran, first has to give his approval to Pezeshkian's win in a ceremony known as \"tanfiz.\"\n\nFollowing that ceremonial step, \"the swearing-in ceremony of the president will be held on August 4 or 5,\" Yosefi was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA on July 7.\n\n\"The president will then have 15 days to present his proposed ministers to the parliament for a vote of confidence,\" he said, adding that, according to parliamentary rules, Pezeshkian will officially renounce his lawmaker mandate on July 31.\n\nPezeshkian has been a member of parliament since 2008 and served as deputy speaker between 2016 and 2020, when moderates and reformists had a majority in the legislature.\n\nPezeshkian's victory came amid a turnout of 49.8 percent, considerably higher than the record-low 40 percent in the first round of the election, which was triggered by the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May.\n\nPezeshkian, who finished the first round with 10.5 million votes -- 1 million more than Jalili -- appears to have been the one who benefited from the larger turnout in the second round, finishing the runoff with nearly 3 million votes more than his opponent after voting was extended three times until midnight.\n\nHis campaign had sought to increase turnout by convincing young and disappointed people who boycotted the first round to vote in the runoff.\n\nFollowing his surprise victory, Pezeshkian thanked young Iranians for helping him win.\n\n\"I am especially grateful to the dedicated and capable young people who came to work lovingly and sincerely on my team and together with the rest of the people shone a ray of hope and confidence in the future,\" the 69-year-old former heart surgeon wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nHowever, he warned that a \"difficult path\" lies ahead for the Islamic republic and appealed to Iranians not to leave him \"alone\" as he begins his presidency in a country beset by economic hardships compounded by international sanctions and dominated by a repressive theocracy.\n\nKhamenei called the runoff vote \"very important\" and urged everyone \"to work together.\n\nIran's theocracy, installed after the Islamic Revolution of 1979, has long maintained that it derives its legitimacy from strong popular support that translates into high voter turnout, but poor participation in recent elections and deadly antiestablishment protests have challenged the legitimacy of the current leadership.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:03:43 0:00\n\nPezeshkian questioned Iran's methods of enforcing the Islamic head scarf for women following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in 2022 while in the custody of Iran's dreaded morality police for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly.\n\nHe has also said that while the hijab law should be observed, \"there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behavior toward women.\"\n\nPezeshkian has called for \"constructive relations\" with Western countries and favors reviving the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, but he also supports the principles of the Islamic republic and said he would follow Khamenei's policies if elected.\n\nIran's acute economic doldrums worsened after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration withdrew from a landmark 2015 nuclear agreement between Tehran and world powers in 2018, reimposing harsh sanctions.\n\nFollowing Pezeshkian's victory, the European Union said it was prepared to talk.\n\n\"We take note of the results of the presidential elections in Iran and congratulate President-elect Masud Pezeshkian,\" Nabila Massrali, EU spokeswoman for foreign affairs and security policy, said on X. \"We are ready to engage with the new government in line with EU policy of critical engagement.\"\n\nWashington, however, dismissed the impact of Pezeshkian's election.\n\n\"The election will not have a significant impact on [Washington's] approach to Iran,\" a U.S. State Department spokesman told RFE/RL's Radio Farda. \"Our concerns about Iran’s behavior are unchanged.
