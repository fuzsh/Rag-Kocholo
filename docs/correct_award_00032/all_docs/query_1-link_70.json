        "text": "Nuclear weapons and disarmament history\n\nThe first nuclear explosion was in July 1945 when the United States tested its first atomic bomb in the state of New Mexico. Three weeks later, in early August 1945, atomic bombs were dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in an effort to end the Second World War.\n\nNuclear weapons have posed a threat to the world ever since.\n\nSixteen years after the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings the United Nations called for a treaty to combat the spread of nuclear weapons. This action prompted widespread international concern about the threat posed by nuclear weapons.\n\nIn July 1968 the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was opened for signature. This landmark international treaty aimed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and technologies and to promote peaceful cooperation in the use of nuclear energy.\n\nThe treaty, implemented by 1970, was extended indefinitely on 11 May 1995. In all, 191 countries joined the treaty, including the five nuclear-weapons nations (United States of America, Russia, United Kingdom, France and China).\n\nICAN\n\nThe International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) was launched in Melbourne in April 2007 to promote the cause of nuclear disarmament.\n\nThe idea of ICAN was first proposed by Ron McCoy, a Melbourne-based obstetrician and former co-president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW).\n\nHe first suggested the idea through the IPPNW network. At its 17th world congress in 2006 in Helsinki the IPPNW adopted ICAN as a priority action. By 2007 ICAN had set up its first office in Melbourne.\n\nWhat developed was a coalition of multiple and diverse partner organisations around the world working towards a clear objective, which was a ‘comprehensive, binding treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons and provide for their elimination’.\n\nKey factors that informed the development of ICAN were the need to be global, to engage young people and to firmly advocate the unacceptability of nuclear weapons.\n\nIn 2011 ICAN, with the support of a grant from the Norwegian Government, established an office in Geneva, in order to head up an international workforce.\n\nICAN is now a coalition made up of non-governmental organisations from over 100 countries.\n\nTreaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons\n\nIn 2016 ICAN successfully advocated for a special UN working group on nuclear disarmament and campaigned for the UN General Assembly’s resolution to undertake negotiations on a treaty for the purpose of prohibiting nuclear weapons.\n\nThe subsequent Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was driven by a growing sense of frustration over inaction on nuclear disarmament. An alternative approach to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was taken, one that asserts the prohibition (as opposed to the reduction) of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nICAN was an active participant in the treaty negotiations process.\n\nIt has been argued that the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons has polarised the international community because it is underpinned by a principle of immediate prohibition.\n\nNegotiations have so far not allowed other arrangements to be made with nuclear-armed countries, including a phased approach to disarmament. As a result, all nuclear-armed countries and many of their allies (almost 40 countries) have not taken part in the treaty negotiations.\n\nThe Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons will only come into effect after 50 countries ratify it. At the end of 2019 there were 80 signatories, but only 34 countries had ratified the treaty. Australia has not signed the treaty.\n\nNobel Peace Prize\n\nAt a ceremony held in Oslo on 10 December 2017 ICAN was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize. The prize was awarded:\n\nfor its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons.\n\nAt the ceremony Beatrice Fihn, Executive Director of ICAN, proclaimed:\n\nWe are a movement for rationality. For democracy. For freedom from fear. We are campaigners from 468 organisations who are working to safeguard the future, and we are representative of the moral majority: the billions of people who choose life over death, who together will see the end of nuclear weapons.\n\nICAN’s receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize demonstrates, among other things, leadership among some Australian communities in the international disarmament movement."
