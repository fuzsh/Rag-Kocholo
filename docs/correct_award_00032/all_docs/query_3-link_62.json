        "text": "Electron-Ion Collider coming to Brookhaven gets substantial U.K. investment\n\nApril 1, 2024, 7:00AMNuclear News\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy is constructing the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory to explore the boundaries of nuclear physics—both for the sake of science and to support diverse applications, including in nuclear medicine, radiation safety, and nuclear energy. The project, already supported by international collaborators in 40 countries, just secured a significant commitment from the United Kingdom.\n\nTags:\n\nShare:\n\nThe IAEA celebrates International Women's Day\n\nMarch 8, 2024, 9:30AMNuclear News\n\nMarch 8 is International Women’s Day, and this year the International Atomic Energy Agency is marking the occasion by bringing more than 400 women together for a two-day event on March 7 and 8: For More Women in Nuclear: IAEA Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship and the Lise Meitner Programs.\n\nTags:\n\nShare:\n\nIAEA and FAO launch global food security initiative\n\nOctober 23, 2023, 3:02PMNuclear News\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations launched Atoms4Food on October 18 at the 2023 World Food Forum in Rome as a flagship initiative to help boost food security and tackle growing hunger around the world. Atoms4Food will support countries as they apply nuclear techniques to boost agricultural productivity, reduce food losses, ensure food safety, improve nutrition, and adapt to the challenges of climate change.\n\nTags:\n\nShare:\n\n2023 ANS Winter Conference and Expo coming to Washington, D.C.\n\nOctober 6, 2023, 7:00AMANS News\n\nThe American Nuclear Society’s largest and most anticipated annual event, the Winter Conference and Expo, will take place November 12–15 at the Washington Hilton in Washington, D.C.\n\nThis year’s theme is “Maintaining the Momentum,” which suits nuclear energy’s current moment in the spotlight. In the last few years, public investment in both new and existing nuclear technology has expanded alongside a rise in public support and acceptance. Now is the perfect time for the nuclear industry to seize this momentum by coming together to maintain current nuclear plants, expand the nuclear workforce, strengthen supply chains and infrastructure, increase public and private sector investments, and continue to advocate for the benefits of nuclear power.\n\nFusion is prioritized in net-zero R&D initiative and IRA funds, but fission factors in too\n\nNovember 10, 2022, 3:00PMNuclear News\n\nJust days before COP27 and the U.S. midterm elections, the White House announced $1.55 billion in Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding for national laboratories and the launch of a Net-Zero Game Changers Initiative based on a new report, U.S. Innovation to Meet 2050 Climate Goals. Out of 37 research and development opportunities identified, fusion energy was selected as one of just five near-term priorities for the new cross-agency initiative. Together, the announcements signal policy and infrastructure support for fusion energy—the biggest chunk of Department of Energy Office of Science (DOE-SC) IRA funding went to ITER, via Oak Ridge National Laboratory—and for advanced nuclear technologies to power the grid and provide process heat to hard-to-decarbonize industrial sectors.\n\nTags:\n\nShare:\n\nNovember 7: The unofficial day of women in nuclear science?\n\nNovember 7, 2022, 12:00PMNuclear News\n\nMarie Curie was born in Warsaw in 1867 on this day, 155 years ago. Exactly 11 years later, in 1878, Lise Meitner was born in Vienna. November 7 is also the date when, in 1911, the Swedish Royal Academy of Science decided to award Curie a second Nobel Prize for her 1898 discovery of the elements radium and polonium (coincidentally, her 44th birthday). Curie, who at age 36 had shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel, later accepted the chemistry prize on December 10, 1911. She remains to this day the only person—man or woman—to receive two Nobel Prizes in two different fields of science. (Linus Pauling was also awarded Nobel Prizes in two categories: chemistry and peace.) On this unofficial day of women in nuclear science, let’s take a moment to acknowledge the fundamental discoveries of both Curie and Meitner.\n\nTags:\n\nShare:\n\nAmerican Nuclear Society publishes special issue of Nuclear Science and Engineering on Versatile Test Reactor\n\nOctober 14, 2022, 2:37PMPress Releases\n\nLA GRANGE PARK, Illinois – Idaho National Laboratory’s crucial Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) project is the focus of a newly released special issue of Nuclear Science and Engineering, the first and oldest peer-reviewed journal in its field. This special issue of the American Nuclear Society’s flagship journal presents a current snapshot of the nuclear innovation project at INL, which is being developed in partnership among six national labs and a host of industry and university partners.\n\nTags:\n\nShare:\n\nZoonotic disease experts agree to use nuclear science against monkeypox, Lassa fever\n\nJune 13, 2022, 7:01AMNuclear News\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency convened a workshop last week to explore how nuclear techniques backed by the IAEA’s Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action (ZODIAC) initiative could be used to avoid outbreaks of monkeypox and Lassa fever. The meeting, held in Vienna, Austria, on the sidelines of the IAEA Board of Governors meeting, was organized to assist countries in using nuclear and related techniques to detect, mitigate, and understand the behavior of the viruses.\n\n“It is important that we are reacting quickly, as things happen. I am happy that concrete work is being carried out on something before it becomes a very difficult problem,” said IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi as he opened the one-day summit.\n\nTags:\n\nShare:\n\nProgress being made on Nuclear Grand Challenges\n\nJanuary 24, 2022, 9:29AMNuclear NewsAndrew C. Klein\n\nEarly in my year as ANS vice president/president-elect, I was determined to try to find a project that the entire ANS community could rally behind and could be completed during my year as ANS president. I was looking for something that would provide community-identified focus areas for future activities and that would mobilize, energize, and inspire ANS members during that year and in the years ahead.\n\nTags:\n\nShare:\n\nArgonne celebrates 75 years that began with a nuclear mission\n\nJuly 1, 2021, 3:05PMNuclear News\n\nSeventy-five years ago today, on July 1, 1946, the first U.S. national laboratory was chartered with the singular mission of developing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Now, the Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory is one of the nation’s largest science laboratories, working on diverse challenges in energy, climate, science, medicine, and national security.\n\nTags:\n\nShare:\n\nWisconsin professor hosts podcast series on nuclear science\n\nJanuary 19, 2021, 12:01PMANS Nuclear Cafe\n\nShelly Lesher, a University of Wisconsin-La Crosse professor, is hosting the My Nuclear Life podcast series centered on how nuclear science is perceived in the community, La Crosse television station WXOW reported.\n\nMy Nuclear Life explores the intersection of nuclear science and society.
