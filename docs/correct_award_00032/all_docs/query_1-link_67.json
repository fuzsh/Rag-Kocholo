Amanullah Khan (Mak).\n\nI am writing to offer my wholehearted congratulations on your Nobel Peace Prize achievement today! I was part of the IAEA from April ´94 - September ´97.

Iverson, Sedona, AZ USA.\n\nI am just a citizen of the world but I followed your fighting for the truth about \"the weapons\" in Iraq and always believed in you and your team.

I´m an Egyptian living in Australia. On hearing the news on Arabic radio in Sydney, I was jumping with joy, and I even called my family in Cairo just to share the great news, without even realising that it was after midnight there! Then I was telling just about everyone I met at work today about this news we´ve all felt greatly honoured to hear. Thanks for making us so proud, and all the best with all your huge responsibilities. -- Riham Youssef, Sydney, Australia.\n\nI have just learnt that your organisation and Dr. ElBaradai has won the Nobel Prize.

All the best for the future and do not stop with you work, people appreciate very much what you are doing. -- Isabelle Eyrich, Germany.\n\nA lot of congratulations to you and IAEA. Hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. May I use this time to share my happiness with you and your family for getting the Nobel Peace Prize. I beg you to visit our country whenever you become free. With love, -- Abdul Rashee K., India.\n\nMy husband and I want to congratulate you and Mohamed ElBaradei for receiving the Nobel Peace prize. We feel it is an extremely significant award that is given to people and organizations which are working hard to help preserve our world. Your organization has shown great objectivity and hard work in dealing with complicated and difficult issues facing the world. The Nobel peace committee has chosen wisely in awarding your organization and Mohamed ElBaradei this award. -- Beth Galton and Fred Phelps, Switzerland.\n\nAll the work carried out by the IAEA would be impossible without the work of all the members of its staff. This award means a deep recognition of the value of this organization since its beginning nearly 50 years ago and to the future forever. Congratulations to the IAEA and to all of you. -- Dra Diva E. Puig, Uruguay."
