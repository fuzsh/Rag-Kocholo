Until 2003, he was Professor of Nuclear Engineering at the University of Tokyo, and is now honored with the distinction of Professor Emeritus.\n\nDr. Suzuki's major scientific areas are nuclear fuel cycle engineering, radioactive waste management and material safeguards, and energy modeling from global perspectives. He managed a number of projects in which he was the project leader or task force chair. For example, at the University, he led a security management project. Internationally, he was co-leader of the joint study on Interim Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel between Harvard University and the University of Tokyo, and a task-force chair of the Panel Report on Managing the Global Nuclear Materials Threat at Center for Strategic and International Studies, Washington D.C.\n\nIn 1978, Dr. Suzuki was selected as the Representative from Japan for the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship that provides an opportunity to stay in the United States as an honorable guest. For one and a half years, from 1974 to 1975, he worked in Austria for the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in the global energy study group as an expert of mathematical modeling and nuclear energy.\n\nIn 2005, Dr. Suzuki was appointed by the Prime Minister as a member of the Scientific Council of Japan, and internationally, served the Board of Nuclear and Radiation Studies at the National Academy of Sciences in the United States, 2000-2006. Currently, Dr. Suzuki serves the IAEA as a member of INSAG and the FANR, the nuclear regulatory body of UAE, as a member of international advisory board.\n\nDr. Suzuki is Fellow of the Atomic Energy Society of Japan, and was a member of the American Nuclear Society, where he used to be Associate Editor in Asia of Nuclear Technology.
