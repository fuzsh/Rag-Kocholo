        "text": "Atoms for Peace - The International Atomic Energy Agency\n\nThe IAEA is widely known as the world's \"Atoms for Peace\" organization within the United Nations family. Set up in 1957 as the world's centre for cooperation in the nuclear field, the Agency works with its Member States and multiple partners worldwide to promote the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear technologies.\n\nThe IAEA Secretariat — the international body of staff tasked with running the Agency — is made up of a team of some 2560 multidisciplinary professional and support staff from more than 100 countries. They come from scientific, technical, managerial and professional disciplines.\n\nMost of these men and women work at Agency headquarters in Vienna, Austria. Others work at IAEA regional offices in Toronto and Tokyo; liaison offices in New York and Geneva; and research laboratories in Seibersdorf, Austria and Monaco. The organizational framework of the IAEA comprises six major departments: Management, Nuclear Sciences and Applications, Nuclear Energy,Nuclear Safety and Security, Technical Cooperation and Safeguards.\n\nThe work of staff in these departments is as diverse as the landscape of peaceful nuclear technologies. Safeguards inspectors and analysts check and verify the whereabouts of sensitive nuclear material. Technical officers run projects that help countries bring fresh water to cities and richer harvests to farmers' fields. Others help scientists to better understand and protect the environment, and some also help medical doctors to prevent and treat diseases. Nuclear experts, radiation specialists and engineers assist countries with meeting safety standards at nuclear plants, or to more safely manage and transport radioactive material.\n\nThere are also IAEA staff who work behind the scenes in a range of positions, such as computer specialists, book editors and publishers, translators and interpreters, communication professionals, accountants, financial experts and conference organizers. They work to keep systems running, constituencies informed and channels open for the valuable exchanges of information influencing the world's nuclear development.\n\nThe contributions of IAEA staff are multiple and varied. They underpin the Agency's important \"atoms for peace\" mission and, in turn, support efforts for international peace and development.\n\nWorking Toward Peace and Prosperity\n\nThe IAEA offers challenging assignments in a stimulating multicultural workplace. As international civil servants, staff members engage with current, meaningful issues of global peace, security and development. They are personally committed to the mission of the Agency, and their dedication is reflected in the lasting change that the IAEA's work makes around the world."
