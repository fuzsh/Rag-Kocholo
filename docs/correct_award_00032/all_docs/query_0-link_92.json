        "text": "For the last four years the Norwegian Nobel Committee that awards the peace prize has tended to shy away from people or organisations at the coalface of global affairs. The awards to Kenyan environmentalist Wangari Maathai in 2004, Iranian human rights activist Shirin Ebadi in 2003 and former US president Jimmy Carter in 2002 were well deserved but essentially about recognising people the international community had overlooked. The 2001 award to Kofi Annan and the United Nations \"for their work for a better organised and more peaceful world\" felt almost neutral after the era-defining attacks of September 11 that year.\n\nWith the 2005 award to Mohamed ElBaradei and the International Atomic Energy Agency, the peace prize committee has returned to sticking its neck out. Unlike the Swedish committee that gives the awards for physics, chemistry, medicine and literature, the Norwegians are free to give an award for a peace that is a work in progress. Although Dr ElBaradei and the IAEA have worked both on North Korea and Iraq, it is the watchdog's handling of Iran and the suspicions of the US and the European trio of France, Britain and Germany that the Islamic Republic is developing nuclear weapons that is its current biggest job. It is not working in the backwater of world affairs, as the flaming between Tehran and the west serves to demonstrate.\n\nThe agency has been calm and methodical but that does not mean it is a soft touch. The last meeting of the IAEA board voted to refer Iran to the UN security council for what it said was non-compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. It has previously accused North Korea of nuclear brinksmanship. The prize committee said the IAEA's work was \"the clearest expression today\" of international cooperation to meet the increasing threat of nuclear weapons.\n\nComing after the oil-for-food report and a spike in UN bashing, largely from the US right, the award to the IAEA, a UN agency, is also a boost to the world organisation and an endorsement of the principles of multilateral diplomacy. The peace prize is an award that confers a huge amount of prestige on its recipients.\n\nDr ElBaradei, who admitted today to being \"humbled and honoured\" by the award, said it sent a very strong message about his work to keep nuclear energy out of military hands: \"Keep doing what you're doing.\""
