        "text": "On October 15, 1958 a radiation accident took place at the Vinča Nuclear Institute near Belgrade (Higuchi and Hymans 2021; IAEA 1962; Anonymous 1960).Footnote 3 An uncontrolled run of the institute’s heavy-water nuclear reactor resulted in six researchers receiving massive radiation doses. They all developed severe radiation sickness and were rushed to the Boris Kidric Institute for first aid. The next day the patients were all flown to Paris to receive an experimental treatment that was the only available medical option for cases such as theirs: a bone marrow transfusion (BMT) (Kraft 2009). Five of the six patients received infusions of bone marrow while the other one went through conventional treatment with medication and blood transfusions. One of them died one month after the accident, and eventually the rest all rejected the transplants. But it was probably those transplants that contributed to their survival before rejection (Mathé et al. 1959; Ninković 2000; Jansen 2005; Oliveira 1997).\n\nThe accident and its aftermath made headlines in major newspapers, including the New York Times (Anonymous 1959c). On April 17, 1960, the Yugoslavians announced that the reactor at the Vinča Nuclear Institute was going to be switched on again. The reason was the increasing international interest in reconstructing the accident in order to accurately estimate the radiation doses received by the physicists. This was expected to provide a better understanding of how to resolve issues of radiation protection related to the construction of industrial nuclear reactors and clarify whether the used medical method (BMT) was promising in case of radiation overexposures, especially in industrial settings.\n\nIndeed, to Sterling Cole, the ranking US Congressman who agreed to head the IAEA during its formative years, the reconstruction of the accident was “of major importance to the Agency” because it could inform their safety criteria in the construction and operation of nuclear reactors. Karl Morgan, director of the health physics division at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, hastened to get involved in the discussion. He confirmed that “in view of the extreme importance of obtaining an accurate estimate of the dose received by these individuals,” the US team was willing to participate in a joint project. “Such data can be extremely useful” continued Morgan, naming the assignment of emergency doses following accidents in the nuclear industry as a major reason.Footnote 4 Eventually, in April 1960, Morgan’s scientific team joined the newly founded IAEA in locally reconstructing the accident (Morgan 1998).\n\nFollowing this project, the IAEA organized a meeting in Vienna a few months later, inviting leading scientists from 33 countries to discuss issues regarding radiation dosimetry. In his closing speech, Cole emphasized the importance of advancing knowledge in the field of radiation dosimetry and made clear that the Agency would take appropriate action to help meet this need. Very soon it actually did. According to Horst Eisenlohr, later head of the dosimetry section, that same year the IAEA established its own dosimetry laboratory. The physicist Johann Nagl from Vienna’s Technical University was appointed as its head (Eisenlohr 2010).\n\nThe idea of adding a research laboratory to a diplomatic agency did not develop as smoothly as one might expect. Already within the IAEA’s Preparatory Commission in 1957 the establishment of a scientific lab had been a controversial issue. As David Fischer writes of the IAEA early days, “hardly any matter could be discussed without provoking lengthy, ideologically tinged, arguments” (Fischer 1997: 77). Fischer served as Assistant Director General for External Affairs throughout the 1980s and later documented the history of the Agency. Referring especially to the establishment of its laboratory, he speaks of the “strong opposition” of the USSR and some Western countries (Fischer 1997: 80).\n\nThe man who orchestrated the planning of the laboratory was Henry Seligman, the IAEA’s Deputy Director General for Research and Isotopes during Cole’s administration (1957–1961). Seligman, whom the New York Times had characterized as “Britain’s No. 1 isotope salesman” (Anonymous 1955) had been head of the isotope division of the British Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell before joining the IAEA. An enthusiastic supporter of the use of radioisotopes in industry and medicine, Seligman strongly influenced Cole on how to develop the Agency’s laboratory and its radioisotope and dosimetry programs (Sigurbjörnsson 1993). As Otto Suschny, a Viennese chemist who in 1961 became the head of the Agency’s Low Level Radioactivity Laboratory, later remembered,\n\nHe [Seligman] alone had the vision to realize that such facilities were essential not only to provide a solid foundation for the unique scientific and technical tasks to be performed by the new organization but also to ensure its support by the scientific community […]. He also had the skill and managerial capability to put his idea into practice in spite of considerable opposition from some colleagues and from several Members of the Board of Governors who did not share his vision, and of formidable practical and financial difficulties. (Suschny 1997: 213)\n\nIndeed, in the final report of the Preparatory Commission in 1957 it was suggested that it could be a “very valuable service” to the Agency’s member states to establish methods of measuring radioactive samples and calibrating measuring equipment. Cole took up the Commission’s recommendations and proposed the topic to the Board of Governors meeting on June 16, 1958. During the critical years 1958 and 1959, heated debates took place in several IAEA board meetings. The major financial investments required for the establishment of the laboratory were just an excuse. Aspects of epistemic power in the Cold War context was the true issue at play. An intense exchange took place during the Agency’s General Conference held on October 4, 1958. Both the Soviet representative Vasily Emelyanov and the Yugoslavian Slobodan Nakicenovic argued that the Agency could use existing laboratory facilities instead of building expensive new ones. Emelyanov went so far as to opine that the Agency’s plans did not raise a “single serious issue”; instead there were irrelevant discussions about setting up a laboratory “intended for minor activities.” And Pavel Winkler from Czechoslovakia warned the General Director that a decision to set up a scientific laboratory might lead to the Agency becoming a fundamental research organization instead of an “organization for broad international cooperation and assistance to under-developed countries” (Winkler 1958).\n\nThe representative of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, and in particular the United States insisted that there was no doubt that such a laboratory was critical for the Agency’s work as it could provide several services to member states. Trying to reach a middle ground, Carlos Sánchez del Río, the representative from Spain, suggested caution before any decision was taken. At stake were the IAEA’s power in defining research projects on nuclear science and technology on a global level and the potential of it becoming a center for fundamental research controlled by the US and their close allies. At the end of the day, the conference voted in favor of setting up the laboratory and Cole moved forward with its establishment (Anonymous 1959a: 15). His decision was backed up by President Eisenhower’s generous gesture of donating a mobile radioisotopes training laboratory to the Agency just before the second IAEA General Conference in 1958 (Rentetzi 2021; Mateos & Suárez-Díaz 44,45,a, b, 2019).\n\nIn the Agency’s press release of April 9, 1959, it was confirmed that the laboratory plans had been approved and that the “functional laboratory” was to be built on a site adjoining the Austrian reactor and atomic laboratories at Seibersdorf, near Vienna. Most probably, the decision to place the lab that far from the Agency’s headquarters was influenced by the fact that the new premises were going to use the chemical and low-activity waste disposal system that was already set up by the Austrian “Studiengesellschaft für Atomenergie” (SGEA) and served its own reactor and labs. John McCone, the US Representatives to the IAEA announced the United States’ donation of $600,000 dollars in order to partially cover the costs of constructing and equipping the Agency’s laboratories, while the Netherlands donated the first equipment to be used (Kammerhofer 2011).Footnote 5\n\nThe initial idea was to create a laboratory “as flexible as possible” so as to serve the Agency’s statutory responsibilities, which were the regulation and production of radiation standards. But while the new laboratory complex was not planned to be completed before 1961, Cole recommended that the “work could very well start on a small scale in some rooms of the basement of the Grand Hotel which are not required for other purposes” (Kammerhofer 2011: 3). Affirming the “not to lose momentum” kind of argumentation, Suschny later recalled that “[f]acilities for radioactivity measurements and dosimetry were rapidly set up […]. Very soon the basement of the Grand Hotel was bustling with activity.” Taking advantage of pre-existing fume cupboards that served the hotel’s kitchen, the first dosimetry work and the radiochemical laboratory were both set up in that basement along with an electronics workshop (Suschny 1981: 214).\n\nEarly laboratory work was centered on a program of absolute radionuclide calibrations, badly needed at the time because of the discrepancies that appeared in measurements carried out in different laboratories around the world. In his recollections, Munir Ahmad Khan, Chairman of the IAEA Board of Governors, conjured up a vivid picture of the “informal and invigorating” atmosphere of those days. At the same time, his observations reflect the unique mingling of nuclear science and diplomacy in action. In the lobby of the hotel, the makeshift IAEA headquarters, one could come across distinguished scientists such as the British Nobel Prize winner in physics in 1951, John Cockroft, or great diplomats such as the Soviet Vyacheslav Molotov. “During lunch hour one could stroll along the Kärntnerstrasse,” Khan recalled, “or go to the cellar to imbibe the pioneering spirit of Dr Henry Seligman’s analytical laboratory” (Khan 1987: 7).\n\nThe laboratory remained in the kitchen for two years, until the larger-scale research facilities were constructed in Seibersdorf. In September 1961, two months before Cole left office and was succeeded by Sigvard Eklund as the Agency’s Director General, the Seibersdorf laboratory was finally inaugurated. “The establishment at Seibersdorf is the world’s first full-fledged laboratory of a truly international character,” announced the IAEA Bulletin (Anonymous 1962a). All laboratory sections were moved from the Grand Hotel’s kitchen to the new location, except for the tritium and hydrology and the medical sections. The section on metrology and standardization, that on environmental contamination, as well as the chemistry laboratory and the electronics workshop were now operating in Seibersdorf (Kammerhofer 2011: 7). By the time the move was completed in 1961, the Agency had added to its operations a food and agriculture development section. A new allocation of laboratory space along with an extension of the existing space in Seibersdorf were already in demand (Suschny 1981). (Fig. 1).\n\nThe laboratory was designed to fulfill five objectives: a) the metrology of radionuclides and the preparation of radioactive standards, b) the calibration and adaptation of measuring equipment, c) the quality control of special materials for nuclear technology, d) measurements and analyses in connection with the Agency’s safeguards and health and safety program, and e) services for member states undertaken by means of the facilities needed for the other activities. In these early years the IAEA invested most of its attention and resources to radiation dosimetry, in particular concerning radiation therapy.\n\nIn August 1959 a group of twenty experts from twelve countries jointly convened by the IAEA and the WHO met to review issues related to the use of radiation for the treatment of cancer. Up to that time, malignant tumors had been treated either by using radium applicators, which had been popular especially before World War II, or with high-energy radiation in the form of gamma or X‑rays. The IAEA study group concluded that both high-energy gamma radiation, produced from large sources of radioactive materials like cobalt-60 or cesium-137, and electron beams, produced by high-voltage particle accelerators, were the future of radiotherapy.Footnote 6\n\nIt was suggested that the two United Nations organizations should invest in training medical personnel worldwide through their technical assistance programs. Moreover, the determination of radiation doses for clinical practice and the standardization of dosimetry methods were both crucial for the success of the overall program (Anonymous 1959b). The IAEA’s newly established dosimetry lab was tasked with the preparation and testing of a system that would allow the Agency to provide calibration and dose comparison services simply through the mail. It was the first time in the history of radiation that an international political and diplomatic organization was planning to devise a technoscientific system of standardizing dosimetry on a global level. And indeed, soon after, the IAEA embarked on a major dosimetry project—a global experiment without precedent—that led to its establishment as the key metrological organization on radiation on the planet.\n\nToday the IAEA’s Dosimetry Laboratory plays a key role in radiation protection throughout the world, ensuring the maintenance of high standards and guiding the calibration of radiotherapy beams in both low- and high-income countries. It is the central laboratory in the international measurement system for radiation dosimetry, which consists of a network of about 80 Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratories (SSDLs) jointly operated by the IAEA and the WHO (Fig. 2). The laboratory calibrates more than 50 ionization chamber systems, verifies some 450 beams from radiotherapy equipment in hospitals across the globe, and provides a follow-up program for hospitals that report dosimetry deviations—including, if needed, on-site visits by IAEA experts and training in radiotherapy equipment.\n\nThe assistance that the Agency provided to its member states in the medical sector comprised four levels. First, the IAEA encouraged medical clinics in member states to employ physicists in radiotherapy institutions and establish physics services in individual hospitals, thus enforcing the establishment of medical physics as a distinct and strong discipline. Second, it offered specialized training in radiation physics to those wishing to staff their newly established centers. Third, the Agency supported those physicists already employed in the medial sector with available data, advice, and networking opportunities. For example, starting in 1961, the IAEA made a direct financial contribution to the ICRU, the commission responsible for establishing a unit for measurement of radiation when applied in medicine. The three international organizations—ICRU, IAEA, and WHO—also formed an advisory panel on clinical medicine. Finally, at the request of its member states, the Agency offered in its headquarters in Vienna a whole-body counter for the measurement of doses received by radiation workers or overexposed patients (Anonymous 1963: 25; Anonymous 1962b).\n\nThis multilevel service demanded reliable radiation dosimetry. And in 1964 the time was finally ripe to provide it. “The number and scope of requests for advice and support in nuclear medicine have substantially increased in 1964,” the IAEA’s Board of Governors realized, fully expecting this trend to continue in 1965–66 (Anonymous 1964: 21). In view of these demands, the Agency initiated a dosimetry project, aiming to access the reliability and accuracy of radiation protection measurements in a small number of European laboratories. This plan was conceived at the Symposium on High-Energy Electrons that took place at Montreux, Switzerland, in September 1964.Footnote 7\n\nDuring an “informal session,” a small group of physicists—among them Nagl, representing the IAEA’s dosimetry lab—decided to test a simple and relatively inexpensive calibration method. In February 1965 the plan was already in place, and Seligman sent a circular letter to a number of European laboratories describing the project to be undertaken in March and April of that year:\n\nAs a first attempt to make a contribution to the improvement of the present situation, the International Atomic Energy Agency plans to distribute four intercomparison chemical dosimeters to institutions interested in the dosimetry of high-energy electron beams. This might be followed by similar intercomparisons of dosimetric measurements involving other types of instruments such as thermoluminescent dosimeters.Footnote 8\n\nNagl and the physicist Alexandre Sanielevici, who had previously worked at Marie Curie’s lab in Paris and was now the Deputy Director of the IAEA’s Division of Research and Laboratories, took over the task. In order to achieve reliable dosimetry, IAEA scientists had to compare absorbed dose measurements in high-energy electron beams from a given laboratory with those measured at its own laboratory. Based on the results, the next step was to calibrate each laboratory’s equipment according to the IAEA standard. Although the idea was simple, its execution proved to be very demanding since difficult decisions had to be made when it came to both the devices for measuring radiation and to comparing the measurements.\n\nIt is important to recall that the history of defining the ways we measure radiation, as well as that of the concept of the dose, has been long and complicated. In the early 1920s the dose was defined in a pharmacological sense as the quantity of radiation given to a patient. This view changed only in the 1940s when scientists finally developed the notion of the absorbed dose, that is, the quantity of radiation energy absorbed per unit mass of the irradiated body. This concept of the absorbed dose was used in the calculation of radiation uptake in living tissues (Wyckoff 1980; Walker 2000). But comparing measurements also required the right tool, called dosimeter. At the time the most reliable seemed to be the Fricke dosimeter, a well-known and widely used dosimeter designed in 1927 by physicists Hugo Fricke and Sterne Morse (Fricke & Morse 1927).\n\nFricke was a Danish physicist who had earlier worked with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen and subsequently in Lund with Manne Siegbahn. In 1919 he moved to the United States and worked first at Columbia and then at Harvard before he ended up in Cleveland, Ohio, as director of the new biophysical laboratory of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. In 1925 he had already founded the Victoreen Instrument Company which produced commercially the Victoreen dosimeter, widely used in the nuclear industry. The dosimeter that acquired Fricke’s name was a kind of chemical dosimeter that contained a corrosive liquid (Ferrous sulfate solution) in a “ground-glass stoppered, radiation-resistant, quartz spectrophotometer cell” (Soares et al. 1987: 1). This instrument was for many years the only chemical dosimeter with such high accuracy and precision (Oller et al. 1969).\n\nThe principle on which the Fricke dosimeter was based is the fact that ionizing radiation when passing through matter could displace an electron from its orbit around a nucleus. The displaced electron produces further chemical reactions with the medium, leading to new products. When the medium is human tissue, then chemical reactions lead to cell damage and often death. But if the medium is a particular solution in which the reaction products are stable and easily measured, then this solution could be used as a dosimeter. Fricke dosimeters were widely used in radiation biology and medical physics. When irradiated, the Fricke solution produces ferric (iron ions with oxidation number of +3) in proportions that are analogous to the absorbed dose deposited in the solution. The chemical changes that the solution undergoes lead to changes in optical properties that can be measured by simple optical means. Thus, the ferric concentration is measured by absorption spectroscopy, and this is why Fricke dosimeters are placed in spectrophotometer cells.\n\nIn view of the above, the IAEA team favored the use of Fricke dosimeters in their first experimental trial. On May 3, 1965, they sent the first batch to ten institutions throughout Europe and to New York’s Memorial Hospital. “The Agency considers to distribute the Fricke solutions only as a first preliminary step, mostly to find out if this technique is useful for the dosimetry of high energy electrons” explained Sanielevici to John Laughlin, director of the Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research in New York.Footnote 9 In total, eight countries were involved in the first trial: Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, and the US. It is important to note that none of these invited institutions was located in the Soviet Union or any of the Eastern Bloc countries that had signed the Agency’s statute. Cold War politics clearly defined participation in the first trial.\n\nThe IAEA package contained four Fricke dosimeters—samples A, B, C, and D—sent free of charge to each institution (Fig. 3). The participants were advised not to irradiate samples A and B. Sample A was going to be mailed back to the IAEA and used as reference for checking possible changes in the physical or chemical properties of the solution during the trip. Sample B was evaluated for optical density by the participating institution. The other two samples, C and D, were each placed in a relatively small (6 × 10 × 15 cm) phantom of water-equivalent material. Both of them had to be irradiated under very specific conditions, carefully described by the IAEA team, and with a total dose of 5,000 rad coming from a 30 MeV electron beam. The measurement of this dose was supposed to be done with the institutes’ monitor dosimeters. Participants were advised to send Sample C back to the IAEA dosimetry lab for evaluation. Sample D was going to be evaluated by the participating institution itself. Thus, the institution had to evaluate two samples—B and D—and report the results. A document entitled “Procedure” accompanied the package of dosimeters that was sent to each laboratory, which described in detail the conditions under which it ought to perform the experiment.Footnote 10 When a package left the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, the participating institution was informed by cable about the exact date so as to expect it. The note simply read, “kindly requested to return immediately irradiated Fricke dosimeters.”Footnote 11\n\nThe Fricke dosimeters proved to be very precise. Dr. Pierluigi Cova from the radiotherapy department of Casa Di Cura Sant’Ambrogio in Milan explained to Sanielevici: “We usually employ ionization chambers (Victoreen and PTW) for the dosimetry of high-energy electrons and we know that they are not suitable for a correct determination of the real absorbed dose […]. We therefore think that, until a calorimeter [that is] completely tissue equivalent will be realized, the better evaluation of absorbed dose must be made by means of Fricke dosimeters.”Footnote 12\n\nLaughlin, a pioneer of radiation therapy in New York, informed Sanielevici that “we have had under way in the United States a somewhat similar intercomparison program among a number of institutions.”Footnote 13 Laughlin had studied with Donald Kerst, the inventor of the betatron, at the University of Illinois where he also carried out nuclear research on the university’s cyclotron designed by Gerald Kruger and, in 1950, initiated the first therapeutic use of high-energy electrons (Luther 1986). In the early 1960s, Laughlin participated in the joint ICRU/ICRP study group on radiation dosimetry. Following an invitation from the United Nation’s Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), the group ventured to study the radiation doses received by patients during medical treatments with ionizing radiation (Taylor 1979: 9.272–9.274). Hoping to gain from Laughlin’s experience, Sanielevici asked for his participation in the first intercomparison, although his institution was not located in Europe.\n\nOn March 2, 1965, Nagl informed all invited institutions that they had received “favorable replies” from the majority of them so that the experiment would soon take place.Footnote 14 Scandinavian institutions were especially eager to participate. They already had an intercomparison program running for the new betatrons in Copenhagen, Oslo, Helsinki, Gothenburg, Lund, Stockholm, Umeå, and Örebro.Footnote 15 Three of the hospitals, those in Gothenburg, Lund, and Umeå, all in Sweden, were invited by the Agency to participate. The first batch of dosimeters was sent out a day later. The Radiation Physics Department of the Royal Medical School of Umeå was impressively fast in performing the experiment and providing data. “We obtained your dosimeters yesterday,” wrote Gunnar Hettinger to Sanielevici, “irradiated and returned them by air the same day.”Footnote 16 Not all institutions were this fast. Wolfgang Pohlit from Frankfurt reported that carrying out of the experiment had been delayed because of necessary repairs to their betatron.Footnote 17 Pohlit was working under the direction of one of the most influential biophysicists of his time, Boris Rajewsky, at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysics.\n\nBy June 18, all participating institutions had concluded their measurements and returned their results. The IAEA team circulated a new letter to all institutions including the results and a corrected formula for calculating the absorbed dose which had been wrongly reported in their first letter.Footnote 18 They clearly handled the procedure with great discretion: the final review of the experiment, which is not included in the available archival material, mentioned participant institutions by number without their names, thus making identification impossible, and the list of final results sent out by Sanielevici on October 21 indicated only the number of each institution as well. The IAEA’s discretion and diplomatic phrasing even of scientific data were indeed novel to the experimenters involved. Diplomatic language had already permeated scientific language. As Sanielevici informed all of them, the next intercomparison experiment was already planned for early 1966. He asked for suggestions regarding the details of the planned intercomparison and also for new interested participants.\n\nOn December 20, 1965, right after the end of the first intercomparison experiment, Sanielevici contacted Victor Ivanov, the scientific adviser to the resident representative of the Soviet Union to the Agency. He informed him about the experiment, attached a summary, and announced that the IAEA was planning a second intercomparison “aimed at calibrating routine dosimeters for high-energy electron beams used for radiotherapeutical or other purposes.”Footnote 19 His kind request was whether Ivanov could inform the IAEA’s dosimetry group of any institutions in the Soviet Union willing to participate in this second trial. This contact resulted in a dosimetry study tour in the Soviet Union ending in 1971.\n\nWith a circular letter sent on January 20, 1966, a number of institutions were invited to participate in the new intercomparison. They were informed that the reproducibility of the results obtained from the first experiment was about +−2%. This second distribution of Fricke dosimeters targeted institutions with accelerators. They wanted to finally compare the radiation dose measured by the Fricke dosimeter that the IAEA provided with the reading of the dosimeter that each institution used routinely in their daily work. The letter listed 13 institutions. An interesting handwritten note (“this letter was also sent to the joining persons”) reveals a slightly less guardedly attitude on the IAEA’s part. The institutions, once again, were located in Europe, in nine different countries, besides Laughlin’s institute in New York.\n\nBy the time the IAEA team initiated the intercomparison experiments, Laughlin had already conducted a series of eight intercomparisons between his own Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases and the M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston (Laughlin et al. 1965). The core of their work was to investigate the stability of irradiated dosimeters during air travel. Samples of Fricke dosimeters in Pyrex glass vessels were sent back and forth between the co-operating institutions. They also used a second kind of dosimeter, stored in polyethylene capsules containing 174 mg of lithium fluoride powder, known as TLDs. The goal was to compare the behavior of both Fricke and TLDs when traveling. As Garrett Holt, Laughlin’s colleague, informed Sanielevici, “we have come to the conclusion that for the accuracies required in practical dosimetry—that is perhaps an accuracy of +−2%—the lithium fluoride dosimeter is the most convenient to use for this purpose.”Footnote 20 The Agency, however, insisted on using Fricke dosimeters in its second intercomparison trial.\n\nOn March 29, 1966, Nagl sent the dosimeters to the participant institutions. The ampoules were made of glass with thin walls, filled with ferrous sulfate dosimeter solution, sealed, and placed in a MIX‑D phantom brick, a water-equivalent material. The institutions were asked to irradiate the phantoms with 5,000 rads and return them to the Vienna laboratory for evaluation.Footnote 21 The trial went smoothly and on July 12, Nagl was almost ready to publicize the result. As he admitted to M. J. Day from the Regional Medical Physics Unit of the Newcastle General Hospital, “the results were in very good agreement with the values of institutes which have done some research with this dosimetric system.”Footnote 22 One day later Sanielevici dispatched a number of identical letters to participant institutions to inform them individually about the final results of the experimental trial.\n\nOverall, these first two intercomparison experiments were conducted mainly because the IAEA wanted to “check the feasibility of distributing Fricke dosimeters by air-mail, to irradiate them in various places and to return them by air for evaluation.”Footnote 23 By October 1966 the Agency scaled up its project. It decided to offer this kind of intercomparison service to interested institutions in member states once a year. As Nagl explained to the Institute for Radiation Technology in Karlsruhe, the ICRU was planning to propose the Fricke dosimeter as reference standard and the IAEA had decided to harmonize its service with them. But when Tran Hoang Hai from the Department of Betatron in Lausanne asked Nagl whether they “can afford comparison and standardization of dosimeters in different laboratories with your Standard in IAEA laboratory,” Nagl was very careful not to claim standardization as the Agency’s actual project.Footnote 24 He argued:\n\nThese measurements are comparison measurements. We avoid the expression “standardization” because until today the ICRU has not recommended a primary standard for dosimetry of high-energy radiation. Therefore, we do not use “standardization” in spite of the fact that the ferrous sulphate dosimeter is a recommended secondary standard.Footnote 25\n\nTo understand the Agency’s caution, one has to view it in the context of international developments in preparing and negotiating radiation standards. The IAEA was determined to create a niche for itself among regulatory institutions with a long and strong tradition in radiation protection. Given the IAEA’s powerful political position, the others had to strive for a compromise. What seems to have been decisive was the personal acquaintance of Lauriston Taylor and Sterling Cole. Taylor, the American pioneer in radiation protection and chairman of the ICRU at the time, knew Cole from his time as a member of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in the US. This personal link helped settle the division of labor among the three international organizations in 1960—two of them (ICRU and ICRP) scientific and the third (IAEA) political and diplomatic. As a compromise Cole promised an annual budget to both the ICRU and ICRP. The IAEA was going to produce codes for radiation protection but the philosophy was going to be dictated by the other two organizations (Boudia 2007; Vetter 1966; Taylor 1979: 9.259).\n\nThroughout the early postal dose intercomparison trials, reports and official documents published by the IAEA were, as expected, written in a neutral, strictly technical manner. Take for example Nagl’s and Sanielevici’s article in Strahlentherapie published in 1967 as a response to many requests for a detailed description of their experimental procedures. Giving scant attention to the long list of complexities and failures, the many repairs and adjustments that had to be done, or the delays that many laboratories faced, the IAEA group appeared confident that scientific work would proceed more easily as soon as standards were agreed upon. “This dosimetry intercomparison is inexpensive,” they wrote, further asserting that “only manpower and transportation costs have to be taken into consideration” (Nagl & Sanielevici 1967: 566; Nagl et al. 1964).\n\nIn reality, while Fricke dosimeters were very accurate, they were extremely laborious to produce, and the instability of materials became obvious in each step of their production. Particular care had to be taken during the preparation, handling, and evaluation of the procedure. Given that organic impurities could affect the final measurements, all glassware used had to be cleaned with chemicals and rinsed several times with distilled water. Spectrophotometer cells also had to be rinsed with distilled water several times throughout the production process. After the procedure was finished, all laboratory utensils had to be carefully stored in dust-free and specially designed cabinets. Preparing the Fricke solution, filling the spectrophotometer cells, and pre-irradiating the first batch of dosimeters for control check usually took a whole day. The personnel had to be especially cautious and wear rubber aprons and face shields (Soares et al. 1987).\n\nAnd the problems did not end with the production of the Fricke dosimeters. Given that they were very delicate—after all they were thin glass ampoules full of a corrosive liquid—it was generally difficult to handle them. During the first experimental trial, Ulla-Brita Nordberg, a physicist at the Radiophysics Central Laboratory in Lund, informed Sanielevici that “the ampoule no. 78 was broken during the attempt to take it out from the phantom. The solution then was impured.”Footnote 29 Yet, the most troubling part of the whole experiment involved finding a suitable system for mailing the Fricke dosimeters to the participating institutions. “By this test with a small number of Institutes,” Nagl explained, “we would like to try to get some knowledge on the possibilities of mailed Fricke dosimeters.”Footnote 30 Indeed, since they contained a corrosive liquid in unsealed containers, it was complicated to send these dosimeters by mail. In case of air transportation, the Agency had to deal with package regulations, given that the package had to travel in the pressurized compartment of the airplane.\n\nWhen, for example, Laughlin’s group tried to return the irradiated dosimeters to Vienna for a readout, “the package was delayed at the air express office in New York City for about three weeks before it was finally dispatched to Vienna.”Footnote 31 The long delay between the exposure of the dosimeter and the reading of the density might have had effects on the accuracy of the determination of the dose—but Nagl hastened to assure them that that effect was negligible.Footnote 32 Karl Johan Vikterlöf from Örebro in Sweden expressed similar concerns: “The only small problem I see is that we have no direct air-communication here to Orebro, which means that we perhaps will be delayed some few days due to the necessity of using a combination of air-transport and train-transport from Stockholm to Orebro.”Footnote 33\n\nThe “mailing techniques” came up again and again as the major concern of all those involved in the trials.Footnote 34 When the Argonne National Laboratory returned to the Agency the set of their irradiated dosimeters, they included also a copy of their shipping order and detailed info on the route of the package to make sure that it would be received. References to long delays appear in a number of other responses coming from US laboratories. During the third trial the participant laboratory at the University of Chicago did not even receive the sent IAEA package.Footnote 35 But if sending and receiving dosimeters posed a problem in the US, it was an even bigger challenge to clear IAEA packages at the customs in Khartoum, Sudan. “Unfortunately, it has taken a long time to clear these items from the customs here, and we are now waiting for an export permit to allow them to be returned to you” wrote T. J. Davy, an IAEA expert who was sent to Sudan to oversee the establishment of a radiotherapy center in Khartoum, the first of its kind in an African country.Footnote 36\n\nOn top of these issues, several airlines refused to transport the Fricke dosimeters on passenger aircrafts since they contained a corrosive liquid and were thus tagged as a “restricted article.” Nagl clearly made an effort to persuade airlines to change their restrictions. As an international organization the IAEA had the power to bring the issue directly to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). On March 22, 1967, Nagl addressed the Association hoping that they could add a new article in the next edition of its restricted articles regulations:\n\nThis liquid is in fact a 2% solution of sulfuric acid, has as a matter of fact a lower acid concentration than vinegar and is, according to information of the University of Vienna, so harmless that it could be swallowed. We usually dispatch in one package less than 50 cm3 of this solution in 10 sealed ampoules, which are placed in wax blocks and surrounded by absorbing material.Footnote 37\n\nAdrianus Groenewege, the Association’s secretary, responded within a week. He had already circulated Nagl’s letter to the members of the IATA’s relevant working group and suggested that this matter had to be reviewed at the Association’s annual meeting. Commenting directly on Nagl’s assurance that the solution was totally harmless, Groenewege mentioned that “personally I am rather doubtful about this statement, and I certainly would not suggest to anybody that they attempt to do so [swallow the solution].” On July 26, Groenewege informed Nagl that the IATA working group was persuaded that the “article,” meaning Fricke dosimeters, “does not meet the definition of a corrosive liquid.” Yet it was not considered as completely harmless and thus IATA placed it under “Other restricted articles,” which required special packaging. Nagl thanked him, expressing his hope that this will help to overcome difficulties in the future.Footnote 38\n\nBut even if airlines could be disciplined and materials stabilized, and the Fricke dosimeters reached their destinations, the IAEA group had to deal with the unruliness of the laboratory throughout all trials. During the first experiment and after the IAEA announced the results, Garrett Holt, Laughlin’s colleague at Sloan Kettering, reported that the IAEA group had gotten wrong two things for their own case. First of all, for the irradiation of the first batch of dosimeters Laughlin and Holt used a source of 30 MeV and not 5,000 rad as the IAEA team expected. Second, the results of the samples that appeared on the IAEA’s final report did not agree with those reported by Laughlin and Holt. Again, they were not the only ones to point to similar issues. Almost all participant institutions made mistakes of all sorts during the procedure.Footnote 39\n\nIn the end, what the IAEA had hoped to be a one-off experiment followed by a routine black-boxed service to its member states, turned out to be an endless experiment that required strictly controlled spaces, materials, bureaucracies, and even architectures. In 1967 the Agency finally also tested TLD dosimeters, which proved much better suited for travel. A year later, at the request of the IAEA, a panel of experts together with representatives from the WHO met in Caracas to discuss dosimetry in radiotherapy. The selection of Venezuela was not accidental. At the time there was not a single laboratory in Latin America that could calibrate dosimeters, and there were only five qualified hospital physicists in the whole region. It took the IAEA and WHO another six years to agree in setting up a global metrological system in dosimetry through the SSDL network.Footnote 40"
