        "text": "Named after pioneer physicist and twice Nobel Prize laureate Marie Skłodowska-Curie, the Programme aims to inspire and encourage young women to pursue a career in the nuclear field, by providing highly motivated female students with scholarships for Master’s programmes and an opportunity to pursue an internship facilitated by the IAEA.\n\nSelected students receive a scholarship for Master’s programmes in nuclear related studies at accredited universities. They are also provided with an opportunity to pursue an internship facilitated by the IAEA for up to 12 months.\n\nScholarships are awarded annually. In the selection of students consideration is given to field of study, and geographic and linguistic diversity as well as other factors. More information is available here.\n\nThe importance of women in science\n\nScientific breakthroughs have given the world previously unimaginable benefits. Marie Skłodowska-Curie's pioneering work on radioactivity in the late 1800s enabled us to harness the power of the atom, producing countless benefits to humankind.\n\nAs the world faces pressures from a changing climate, growing populations, food insecurity and increased energy demand, maintaining a qualified workforce to drive innovation and productivity is all the more crucial. Nuclear related studies can help countries tackle several of these challenges, and the demand is high for qualified professionals in this field and will continue to grow.\n\nIn its unique mandate to accelerate and enlarge the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, the IAEA is at the forefront of research and technology transfer and depends on a stable pool of qualified technical professionals to fulfil its mission. This workforce does and must include women.\n\nWomen, however, are far from being adequately represented in the nuclear field. They often face barriers to enter and progress in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), right from their school years. The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship Programme seeks to enable more women from around the world to pursue a career in the nuclear field. The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship Programme builds up gender-balanced capacities relevant to nuclear energy, other nuclear applications, nuclear safety and nuclear security, as well as non‑proliferation."
