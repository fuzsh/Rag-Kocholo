Mohamed ElBaradei and the International Atomic Energy Agency that he heads won the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize Friday for their efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. ElBaradei, a 63-year-old lawyer from Egypt, has headed the U.N. nuclear agency as it grappled with the crisis in Iraq and the ongoing efforts to prevent North Korea and Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

The Nobel Committee said ElBaradei and the IAEA should be recognized for addressing one of the greatest dangers facing the world. “At a time when the threat of nuclear arms is again increasing, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to underline that this threat must be met through the broadest possible international cooperation. This principle finds its clearest expression today in the work of the IAEA and its director general.”

ElBaradei, who was reappointed last month to a third term, has had to contend with U.S. opposition to his tenure. Much of the opposition stemmed from Washington’s perception that he was being too soft on Iran for not declaring it in violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. That stance blocked a U.S. bid to haul Tehran before the U.N. Security Council for more than two years.

He also refused to endorse Washington’s contention that Iran was working to make nuclear weapons and disputed U.S. assertions that Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq had an active atomic weapons program Ã¢€” both claims that remain unproven, despite growing suspicions about Tehran’s nuclear agenda.

U.N. nuclear watchdog head Mohamed ElBaradei said on Friday winning the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize would give him and his agency a much-needed “shot in the arm” as they tackle nuclear crises in Iran and North Korea. ElBaradei said he had been certain he would not win, despite being favored, because he had not received the traditional advance telephone call from the Nobel Committee. He only learned of his win while watching the televised ceremony.

The 63-year-old Egyptian lawyer and the International Atomic Energy Agency won the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to prevent both the spread of nuclear weapons, to new states and to terrorists, and to ensure safe civilian use of nuclear energy.

“The award sends a very strong message: ‘Keep doing what you are doing — be impartial, act with integrity’, and that is what we intend to do,” ElBaradei told a news conference in Vienna.
