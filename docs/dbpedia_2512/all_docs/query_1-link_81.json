        "text": "What are eating disorders?\n\nThere is a commonly held misconception that eating disorders are a lifestyle choice. Eating disorders are actually serious and often fatal illnesses that are associated with severe disturbances in people’s eating behaviors and related thoughts and emotions. Preoccupation with food, body weight, and shape may also signal an eating disorder. Common eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder.\n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of eating disorders?\n\nAnorexia nervosa\n\nAnorexia nervosa is a condition where people avoid food, severely restrict food, or eat very small quantities of only certain foods. They also may weigh themselves repeatedly. Even when dangerously underweight, they may see themselves as overweight.\n\nThere are two subtypes of anorexia nervosa: a \"restrictive\" subtype and a \"binge-purge\" subtype.\n\nIn the restrictive subtype of anorexia nervosa, people severely limit the amount and type of food they consume.\n\nIn the binge-purge subtype of anorexia nervosa, people also greatly restrict the amount and type of food they consume. In addition, they may have binge-eating and purging episodes—eating large amounts of food in a short time followed by vomiting or using laxatives or diuretics to get rid of what was consumed.\n\nAnorexia nervosa can be fatal. It has an extremely high death (mortality) rate compared with other mental disorders. People with anorexia are at risk of dying from medical complications associated with starvation. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for people diagnosed with anorexia nervosa.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org . In life-threatening situations, call 911.\n\nSymptoms include:\n\nExtremely restricted eating\n\nExtreme thinness (emaciation)\n\nA relentless pursuit of thinness and unwillingness to maintain a normal or healthy weight\n\nIntense fear of gaining weight\n\nDistorted body image, a self-esteem that is heavily influenced by perceptions of body weight and shape, or a denial of the seriousness of low body weight\n\nOther symptoms may develop over time, including:\n\nThinning of the bones (osteopenia or osteoporosis)\n\nMild anemia and muscle wasting and weakness\n\nBrittle hair and nails\n\nDry and yellowish skin\n\nGrowth of fine hair all over the body (lanugo)\n\nSevere constipation\n\nLow blood pressure\n\nSlowed breathing and pulse\n\nDamage to the structure and function of the heart\n\nBrain damage\n\nMultiorgan failure\n\nDrop in internal body temperature, causing a person to feel cold all the time\n\nLethargy, sluggishness, or feeling tired all the time\n\nInfertility\n\nBulimia nervosa\n\nBulimia nervosa is a condition where people have recurrent and frequent episodes of eating unusually large amounts of food and feeling a lack of control over these episodes. This binge-eating is followed by behavior that compensates for the overeating such as forced vomiting, excessive use of laxatives or diuretics, fasting, excessive exercise, or a combination of these behaviors. People with bulimia nervosa may be slightly underweight, normal weight, or over overweight.\n\nSymptoms include:\n\nChronically inflamed and sore throat\n\nSwollen salivary glands in the neck and jaw area\n\nWorn tooth enamel and increasingly sensitive and decaying teeth as a result of exposure to stomach acid\n\nAcid reflux disorder and other gastrointestinal problems\n\nIntestinal distress and irritation from laxative abuse\n\nSevere dehydration from purging of fluids\n\nElectrolyte imbalance (too low or too high levels of sodium, calcium, potassium, and other minerals) which can lead to stroke or heart attack\n\nBinge-eating disorder\n\nBinge-eating disorder is a condition where people lose control over their eating and have reoccurring episodes of eating unusually large amounts of food. Unlike bulimia nervosa, periods of binge-eating are not followed by purging, excessive exercise, or fasting. As a result, people with binge-eating disorder often are overweight or obese. Binge-eating disorder is the most common eating disorder in the U.S.\n\nSymptoms include:\n\nEating unusually large amounts of food in a specific amount of time, such as a 2-hour period\n\nEating even when you're full or not hungry\n\nEating fast during binge episodes\n\nEating until you're uncomfortably full\n\nEating alone or in secret to avoid embarrassment\n\nFeeling distressed, ashamed, or guilty about your eating\n\nFrequently dieting, possibly without weight loss\n\nAvoidant restrictive food intake disorder\n\nAvoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), previously known as selective eating disorder, is a condition where people limit the amount or type of food eaten. Unlike anorexia nervosa, people with ARFID do not have a distorted body image or extreme fear of gaining weight. ARFID is most common in middle childhood and usually has an earlier onset than other eating disorders. Many children go through phases of picky eating, but a child with ARFID does not eat enough calories to grow and develop properly, and an adult with ARFID does not eat enough calories to maintain basic body function.\n\nSymptoms include:\n\nDramatic restriction of types or amount of food eaten\n\nLack of appetite or interest in food\n\nDramatic weight loss\n\nUpset stomach, abdominal pain, or other gastrointestinal issues with no other known cause\n\nLimited range of preferred foods that becomes even more limited (“picky eating” that gets progressively worse)\n\nWhat are the risk factors for eating disorders?\n\nEating disorders can affect people of all ages, racial/ethnic backgrounds, body weights, and genders. Eating disorders frequently appear during the teen years or young adulthood but may also develop during childhood or later in life.\n\nResearchers are finding that eating disorders are caused by a complex interaction of genetic, biological, behavioral, psychological, and social factors. Researchers are using the latest technology and science to better understand eating disorders.\n\nOne approach involves the study of human genes. Eating disorders run in families. Researchers are working to identify DNA variations that are linked to the increased risk of developing eating disorders.\n\nBrain imaging studies are also providing a better understanding of eating disorders. For example, researchers have found differences in patterns of brain activity in women with eating disorders in comparison with healthy women. This kind of research can help guide the development of new means of diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders.\n\nHow are eating disorders treated?\n\nIt is important to seek treatment early for eating disorders. People with eating disorders are at higher risk for suicide and medical complications. People with eating disorders can often have other mental disorders (such as depression or anxiety) or problems with substance use. Complete recovery is possible.\n\nTreatment plans are tailored to individual needs and may include one or more of the following:\n\nIndividual, group, and/or family psychotherapy\n\nMedical care and monitoring\n\nNutritional counseling\n\nMedications\n\nPsychotherapies\n\nFamily-based therapy, a type of psychotherapy where parents of adolescents with anorexia nervosa assume responsibility for feeding their child, appears to be very effective in helping people gain weight and improve eating habits and moods.\n\nTo reduce or eliminate binge-eating and purging behaviors, people may undergo cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which is another type of psychotherapy that helps a person learn how to identify distorted or unhelpful thinking patterns and recognize and change inaccurate beliefs.\n\nMedication\n\nEvidence also suggests that medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, or mood stabilizers may also be helpful for treating eating disorders and other co-occurring illnesses such as anxiety or depression. The Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) website has the latest information on medication approvals, warnings, and patient information guides.\n\nHow can I find a clinical trial for an eating disorder?\n\nClinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions. The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although individuals may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future.\n\nResearchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with patients and healthy volunteers. We have new and better treatment options today because of what clinical trials uncovered years ago. Be part of tomorrow’s medical breakthroughs. Talk to your health care provider about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you.\n\nTo learn more or find a study, visit:\n\nNIMH’s Clinical Trials webpage: Information about participating in clinical trials\n\nClinicaltrials.gov: Current Studies on Eating Disorders : List of clinical trials funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) being conducted across the country\n\nWhere can I learn more about eating disorders?\n\nFree brochures and shareable resources\n\nEating Disorders: About More Than Food: A brochure about the common eating disorders anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder, and various approaches to treatment.
