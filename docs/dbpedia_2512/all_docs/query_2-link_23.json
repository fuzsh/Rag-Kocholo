In the first story, the Yo-kai Nansukanku takes center stage. This particular Yo-kai is known for making people feel sleepy and lazy, especially during the rainy season. The episode explores the impact of Nansukanku on various characters, including one who falls asleep during an important meeting and another who sleeps through an entire day of work.\n\nThe second story revolves around Ame-no-talk, another Yo-kai that is associated with the rainy season. This Yo-kai has the power to control the rain and make it pour down heavily. The episode showcases the trouble that Ame-no-talk causes, such as flooding and dangerous driving conditions. However, viewers also get to see the positive effects of the rain, such as helping plants grow and providing relief from the heat.\n\nThe third and final story is centered around the return of the Nyanpachi Teacher, a popular Yo-kai who was featured in earlier episodes. This time around, the Nyanpachi Teacher is leading the Sumo Club at the local school. The episode follows the adventures of a group of students who join the Sumo Club and learn the art of sumo wrestling.\n\nOverall, Yo-kai Watch season 3 episode 23 offers viewers a glimpse into the world of Yo-kai during the rainy season. From the lazy Nansukanku to the powerful Ame-no-talk, this episode showcases the many different Yo-kai that can impact people's lives during this time of year. Additionally, the return of the Nyanpachi Teacher provides a fun and entertaining storyline that will appeal to fans of the series. Finally, the Sumo Club storyline adds a level of excitement and action to the episode, making it a well-rounded and enjoyable experience for viewers of all ages."
