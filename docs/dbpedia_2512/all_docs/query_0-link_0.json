        "text": "Komasan in Love Episode 3 (Japanese: コマさんシーズン3 恋とポエムとコーヒーと 3杯目, Komasan Shīzun 3 Koi to Poemu to Kōhī to Sanbaime), Yo-kai Grubsnitch (Japanese: 妖怪つまみぐいのすけ, Yōkai Tsumamiguinosuke), and Yo-kai B3-NK1 (Japanese: ロボニャン始動!, Yōkai Karakuri Benkei) is the 23rd episode of the anime series. It was broadcasted in Japan on June 20, 2014, and in the United States on March 1, 2016.\n\nSummary[]\n\nTemplate:Empty section\n\nPlot[]\n\nKomasan in Love Episode 3[]\n\nKomasan and Komajiro follow after the human lady that Komasan is in love with after he hears her say that she's being targeted over the phone. When they see a man approach her, Komasan rushes to defend her, but he simply asks her to direct him to a nearby pancake shop. From there, she goes to cross the road, saying over the phone that she has to make someone disappear. Komasan rushes to stop her, distracting her and making her drop a folder she's holding, full of pages of a manga. She panics, and Komajiro finds the page where a manga character says that she's being targeted and has to make someone disappear, revealing that what she said over the phone was simply lines from her manga. Komasan gathers the manga pages and hands them to her in his human disguise. When she leaves after thanking him, he reverts back to his regular form and thinks about how he loves her.\n\nYo-kai Grubsnitch[]\n\nWhen Nate's mother is preparing breakfast for Nate and his father in the morning, she suddenly takes a piece of food and eats it. When Nate points it out, she responds by saying \"it's just a bite!\". Later that night, she makes a large platter of food, and when Nate tries to take a bit, she tells him not to. Then, she proceeds to take food herself, repeating that it's \"just a bite\" before suddenly returning to normal and admonishing Nate for snitching food. She then continues to snitch food before Nate searches for a Yo-kai and finds Grubsnitch. Nate and Whisper decide to try to defend the food from Grubsnitch and Nate's mother before his father comes home, to no avail. Nate then decides to call Hungramps for help. Hungramps and Grubsnitch each Inspirit Nate's mother until Hungramps wins out. Grubsnitch accepts defeat and gives Nate his medal, before Hungramps's influence makes Nate sit down and eat all the food with his mother. By the time Nate's father returns home, there's nothing left, and he has to eat cup noodles for dinner.\n\nYo-kai B3-NK1[]\n\nNate tries to watch TV and the TV won't turn on. After finding out from his parents that many other appliances and devices have ceased to function, he searches for a Yo-kai and finds B3-NK1, who introduces himself and tells Nate, Jibanyan, and Whisper that he is searching for 1000 Heroic Screws to awaken the true power of his polearm. He takes his 998th screw from Nate's air conditioner and his 999th screw from the vacuum. Nate summons Robonyan to fix the broken electronics. When B3-NK1 sees him and realises he's a robot, he pierces him with his polearm in order to find another screw. Robonyan turns out to enjoy the sensation, finding it ticklish, and when B3-NK1 initially fails to find the screw, Robonyan insists he try again. Upon more stabbing from the weapon, Robonyan reacts by extending his limbs and neck and wrapping his tails around B3-NK1's arm before retracting them all and falling off the polearm, leaving behind a golden Heroic Screw, the best one B3-NK1 has ever seen. The polearm transforms and B3-NK1 thanks Nate and Robonyan before giving Nate his medal. Then, Robonyan's self-destruct is activated, sending Nate, Whisper, and Jibanyan into a panic when they discover that he could explode and destroy the entire city. Jibanyan punches him, getting Robonyan to reboot. Robonyan, once he comes back online, requests that B3-NK1 stab him again, causing Nate, Whisper, and Jibanyan to intervene.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nHumans[]\n\nNate\n\nLily Adams\n\nAaron Adams\n\nYo-kai[]\n\nWhisper\n\nJibanyan\n\nRobonyan\n\nB3-NK1 (debut)\n\nGrubsnitch (debut)\n\nHungramps\n\nKomasan\n\nKomajiro\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThis episode shows that Robonyan's model number is RBN-000.\n\nYo-kai B3-NK1 segment is claimed to be one of the most suggestive moments in the entirety of the Yo-kai Watch anime series, and thus caused a large following for both B3-NK1 and Robonyan.\n\nBecause of the segment's suggestiveness, the entire episode was skipped in the Latin American dub despite the episode already being edited.\n\nB3-NK1's blade color is changed to black in the Korean dub, but retains the golden color after it's transformed with the screw. The roses around Robonyan's feeling of being hurt by the naginata were also removed.\n\nYo-kai B3-NK1 and The Sleepover are the only episodes to be reanimated by OLM for the English dub.\n\nIn the Japanese preview promo for Jibanyan's Secret Past, the reanimated scenes of Robonyan getting struck by the polearm are used even though availability of the episode in Japan still has the original scenes. It was also shown under one month before the original episode's Australian airdate in January 2016.\n\nDub Differences[]\n\nThe infamous scene relating to Robonyan and B3-NK1 had to be edited for western audiences, to make it look a lot less suggestive.\n\nWhen B3-NK1 stabs Robonyan with his polearm, Robonyan says that machines don't have feelings. The dub alters this with Robonyan saying that B3-NK1 is just \"readjusting his circuitry\".\n\nWhenever B3-NK1 stabs Robonyan with the polearm, Robonyan laughs instead of moaning. Certain scenes are also reanimated to show the blade going through his chest rather than vertically between his legs.\n\nTowards the end of the segment, Robonyan taunts B3-NK1 by shaking his bottom at him. In the English dub, this scene is reanimated to show Robonyan moving back and forth.\n\nIn the original version, B3-NK1 didn't mind attacking Robonyan some more. This was changed to him wanting more \"tickles\".\n\nWhen Nate and Whisper imagine Robonyan's self-destruction, the powerful explosion to the city is changed to a simple white fade-out despite the sound effect still being kept.\n\nIn the French dub of the preview (from the end of EP022), this edit is not retained, despite most other episodes' edits being present in their respective preview dubs.\n\nErrors[]"
