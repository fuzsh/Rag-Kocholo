        "text": "The Night Agent will be back for a season 2 on Netflix in 2024. The renewal was no surprise in early 2023, with the show becoming one of Netflix’s biggest new series launches in history. Here’s everything we know about The Night Agent season 2 so far, including the latest on production, what to expect from the story, new cast members, and much more.\n\n“Serving as an adaptation of Matthew Quirk’s novel ‘The Night Agent,’ with some expanded and original ideas, the show follows a young FBI agent who answers a call that plunges him into a deadly conspiracy involving a mole at the White House.\n\nThe show is produced for Netflix by Sony Pictures Television and showrunner Shawn Ryan, who is behind titles like The Shield and S.W.A.T.\n\nHas Netflix Renewed The Night Agent for Season 2?\n\nOfficial Renewal Status: Renewed on March 29th, 2023\n\nNetflix officially renewed The Night Agent for a second season and announced the second season would be debuting in 2024 (more on this soon) with ten new episodes.\n\nShawn Ryan, creator, showrunner, and executive producer of The Night Agent, said on the season 2 renewal:\n\n“The last week has been a whirlwind as we’ve finally been able to share The Night Agent with the world. To see the tremendous reaction to the show has been a great joy and is a credit to our cast, our writers, our directors, our crew and our partners at Sony Pictures Television and Netflix. We couldn’t be any prouder or more excited to get cracking on Season 2 to share the further adventures of Night Action with our newfound fans.”\n\nKatherine Pope, President of Sony Pictures Television, said:\n\n“We are thrilled to see The Night Agent become an instant global sensation and can’t wait to continue telling this story with our remarkable cast, creative leader, Shawn Ryan and our wonderful partners at Netflix.”\n\nJinny Howe, Vice President of Drama Series at Netflix, said on the renewal:\n\n“We’re proud to see The Night Agent deliver a breakout performance and become instantly embraced around the world. Shawn Ryan has created a spy thriller sensation that viewers cannot get enough of, with a stellar cast featuring Gabriel Basso, Luciane Buchanan and Hong Chau, and we’re here to bring them more of the action and suspense they love.”\n\nAs we’ve covered previously, renewals all come down to the numbers. As we’ll cover below, The Night Agent pulled in some big numbers for Netflix, and that, combined with the fact the completion rate looks to be high and the show’s budget (which is reportedly between $2-$3M per episode – up to $30M total) made it a no brainer.\n\nShawn Ryan, ahead of the renewal, implied that there’s room for more story talking to Deadline, saying:\n\n“I certainly have some ideas; I probably want to keep those to myself until the time comes. What I will tell you is that the initial pitch for this show that we sold to Netflix was that each season would tell its own, mostly self-enclosed, a beginning, middle and end story, and any future seasons would include a few but not most of the characters that we saw in the previous season.”\n\nHow well did The Night Agent perform on Netflix?\n\nThe Night Agent has quickly become one of Netflix’s top performers, with multiple stats backing this up.\n\nEvery Tuesday, Netflix releases 40 hourly statistics for their biggest shows and movies, and their data shows that The Night Agent had a huge debut on Netflix.\n\nPer Netflix’s press release for week 1, “the action-thriller ranks #3 for premiere week of viewing across all Season 1 TV and appeared in the Top 10 in 93 countries.”\n\nThe show ultimately featured in the Netflix global top 10s for ten weeks, with 776.62 million hours watched.\n\nWeek Period Hours Viewed(M) Rank Week in Top 10 March 19th, 2023 to March 26th, 2023 168,710,000 1 1 March 26th, 2023 to April 2nd, 2023 216,390,000 (+28%) 1 2 April 2nd, 2023 to April 9th, 2023 130,480,000 (-40%) 1 3 April 9th, 2023 to April 16th, 2023 90,040,000 (-31%) 1 4 April 16th, 2023 to April 23rd, 2023 56,650,000 (-37%) 2 5 April 23rd, 2023 to April 30th, 2023 37,680,000 (-33%) 4 6 April 30th, 2023 to May 7th, 2023 26,880,000 (-29%) 5 7 May 7th, 2023 to May 14th, 2023 20,340,000 (-24%) 6 8 May 14th, 2023 to May 21st, 2023 16,800,000 (-17%) 8 9 May 21st, 2023 to May 28th, 2023 12,650,000 (-25%) 9 10\n\nThose numbers place the show in the list of most watched shows and movies on Netflix of all time, but given the recent changes in Netflix methodology, it either ranks fifth or sixth depending on the metric you use:\n\nBased on the first 28 days metric, it is the fifth most-watched show of all time with 626.99M hours\n\nBased on the first 91 days, it’s the sixth most-watched show of all time, with 803.70M hours watched (98.20M CVE viewers)\n\nAccording to the Netflix Engagement Reports covering all viewing in 2023, The Night Agent was the most-watched TV show of the year. It picked up just shy of a billion hours watched globally (967,600,000 hours), which equates to 118,200,000 views.\n\nIf we break down the hour data into CVE (Complete Viewing Equivalent – taking the length of the show and dividing by the hours), we can see it outperformed Keep Breathing and 1899 but was shy of The Watcher.\n\nIn our top 10 report for the first week, What’s on Netflix contributor Frederic said the show had the “second-best launch for any series released on a Thursday, just behind The Watcher, which ended up being renewed (a feat for a limited series at the time).”\n\nUsing CVE, we can see that after 14 days, the show was one of the top-performing debut English language series, only behind The Watcher and Wednesday.\n\nNielsen numbers also showed the series performed well (their data covers viewing on connected TV devices in the US), with the show featuring in the top 10s for seven weeks, clocking up 173.50 million hours.\n\nHow about critical acclaim? Audience scores have been outpacing critics’ scores thus far, but it’s mostly positive all around. On RottenTomatoes, as of March 29th, the show holds an 82% score from audiences and 69% from critics. The series holds a 7.7/10 based on over 12,000 reviews on IMDb, and on Metacritic, it holds a 68 rating.\n\nWhat to expect from Season 2 of The Night Agent\n\nWarning: The following section contains spoilers. Proceed with caution!\n\nWhile The Night Agent season 1 certainly answers the most prominent questions by the end of episode 10, there’s still a lot to be learned.\n\nBy the time the credits of the final episode roll, we’ve learned that Diane Farr, the president’s own chief of staff, is the mole and worked with Vice President Redfield and Gordon Wick to plan the metro bombing. As a result, The Night Agent wraps up relatively nicely, but there’s still plenty to be explored potentially. After all, Peter ends the season by jetting off for his first mission.\n\nAs Ryan mentioned in the aforementioned Deadline interview, he suggested that if they’re “successful enough that Netflix wants more seasons, I think there’d be a whole new world in which you would see a limited number of characters from this current season going into that. ”\n\nRyan also covered some of the biggest questions Season 2 would have to seek to answer, including:\n\nWhat does it mean that Peter would be a night agent?\n\nWhere is Peter going next?\n\nWith Rose heading back to California, where does that leave Peter and Rose?\n\nAdditional snippets of information came from Ryan in a ComicBook.com interview where he revealed season 2 would not be taking place in Washington DC, saying:\n\n“We’ll be in a different part of the world exploring different characters than we had in Season One. And we’re determining who from Season One might appear in Season Two. But essentially we’re going to be telling a whole brand-new story, which is exciting and scary.”\n\nWhere is The Night Agent Season 2 in production?\n\nNo filming has yet to take place, and production on the second season has been severely impacted due to the Hollywood strikes that saw writers put their pencils down in May 2023 and the actors following suit from July 2023.\n\nWork did begin on the scripts for season 2, but all of the writers on the show have been striking since May 1st, 2023.\n\nShawn Ryan notably posted on X on May 5:\n\n“I’d rather be writing Season 2 of #TheNightAgent for Netflix\n\nrather than picketing them, but all writers need a fair deal before we can resume our work. We create the TV shows and movies that drive billions in profits. Writers deserve their fair share.”\n\nThe writer’s strike notably ended in late September 2023, and showrunner Shawn Ryan spoke to Variety about the show’s current status on October 12th. The interview states that writing on season 2 was “more than halfway done” before the strikes began in May.\n\nRyan also confirms that the writing staff has been working on the show since October 2nd but states some production preparation has occurred over the summer.\n\nNetflix first confirmed the series was filming on February 5th, 2024, with a slew of social media posts. The filming for some of the shows will take place in Thailand before they return to New York.\n\nThe budget for the new season is reportedly between $2 and $3M an episode, and numerous filming codenames for the series include TNAS2, OSPREY, and OSPREY 212.\n\nIn late March 2024, the team behind the show celebrated the first season’s first anniversary with a slew of new photos from the set of season 2.\n\nFilming on season 2 of The Night Agent is scheduled to wrap on June 7th, 2024.\n\nEpisode Titles, Writers, and Directors for The Night Agent Season 2\n\nThrough multiple sources, including looking diligently through Instagram and various profiles, we’ve compiled the current list of writers, directors, and any episode titles we’ve found for the show.\n\nWriters on this season of The Night Agent include:\n\nImogen Browder\n\nShawn Ryan\n\nTiffany Shaw Ho\n\nDirecting on this new season includes:\n\nGuy Ferland\n\nAdam Arkin\n\nAna Lily Amirpour\n\nNina Lopez Corrado\n\nSeth Gordon\n\nEpisode Titles\n\nThese will be updated as and when we learn about more!\n\nEpisode 201\n\nEpisode 202\n\nEpisode 203 – GOVERNMENT PROPERTY\n\nEpisode 204\n\nEpisode 205\n\nEpisode 206\n\nEpisode 207 – TILT\n\nEpisode 208\n\nEpisode 209\n\nEpisode 210\n\nThe Night Agent Season 2 – New And Returning Cast Members\n\nGabriel Basso and Luciane Buchanan are the two most prominent returning cast members confirmed for the second season.\n\nThrough several waves of announcements, we’ve got a big new cast coming up in season 2 of The Night Agent.\n\nIn December 2023, Amanda Warren (The Burial) was the first to be announced to join the cast as the series’ regular role-playing Catherine Weaver. She’s a seasoned case officer and veteran FBI agent with a sharp mind and a critical eye who doesn’t suffer fools. Handles herself well in the halls of power in DC and in the field.\n\nThen, in January 2024, the next wave of series regulars and recurring roles were announced. The new series regulars were:\n\nBerto Colon (Power Book II: Ghost, Orange Is The New Black) – Solomon Robinson – former Marine turned right-hand man fixer for powerful businessmen.\n\nLouis Herthum (Westworld) – Jacob Monroe – International businessman with powerful connections\n\nArienne Mandi (Tatami) – Noor Kabiri – Low-level aide in the Iranian mission to the UN in New York.\n\nThe two recurring roles were:\n\nBrittany Snow (X, The Good Half) – Alice Leeds – Peter’s partner and mentor as he joins Night Action.\n\nTeddy Sears (Raising the Bar, Masters of Sex) – Warren Stocker – High-level intelligence officer and the subject of a Night Action investigation.\n\nThen, in March 2024, Deadline revealed three guest roles for season 2:\n\nMarwan Kenzari (Black Adam) – Reza – Decorated soldier court marshaled.\n\nElise Kibler (The Sunlit Night) – Sloan – Glamorous British socialite.\n\nDikran Tulaine (The Blacklist) – Viktor – Former leader of a country but since convicted of war crimes.\n\nFurther casting for season 2 includes:\n\nMichael Malarkey (The Vampire Diaries) as Markus, a military chief and loyal nephew to a dictator newly convicted of war crimes by the Hague.\n\nNavid Negahban (Alladin) as Abbas the U.N. ambassador for Iran.\n\nKeon Alexander (The Expanse) as Javad – “oversees security for the Iranian Mission to the United Nations and monitors the loyalty of its employees.”\n\nRob Heaps (Station 11) as Tomas, the elitist son of the deposed dictator, who is keen on restoring his family to power.\n\nFrancesca Root-Dodson (Free Spirit, Gotham) as Amélie.\n\nKylo Freeman had joined the cast during The Night Agent’s birthday celebrations.\n\nDavid Chen as Jeff\n\nMichael Bonini as Tyler\n\nAnousha as Haleh\n\nSiya Rostami as Daryoosh\n\nMatt Dellapina as Frank\n\nOther roles Netflix was casting for in season 2 include:\n\nBraden\n\nMembers of an international crime crew run by a dangerous businessman (stunt-heavy roles) – Ben, Neil, Jeff, Dani.\n\nWhen will Season 2 of The Night Agent be released on Netflix?\n\nDespite our original prediction that a 2024 release date may be hard to achieve because of the strikes, Netflix is still very optimistic.\n\nWe say that because The Night Agent 2 was part of the 90+ roster of shows, it confirmed at the Next on Netflix event that it would be returning in 2024.\n\nGiven that the production wrap is scheduled for early June, we’d guess a November-December 2024 launch is most likely, but don’t be surprised if it gets knocked into 2025, either.\n\nWhile waiting for The Night Agent season 2, Matthew Quirk has plenty of other novels to read. Other Quirk novels like Hour of the Assassin, The Directive, Cold Barrel Zero, Dead Man Switch, or Red Warning\n\nAll these books are also ripe for adaptations and not necessarily as part of The Night Agent because, as the author explains on Twitter, “they’re mostly standalones.”\n\nMatthew Quirk’s most recent book, Inside Threat, was released on June 13, 2023.\n\nAre you looking forward to watching The Night Agent season 2 on Netflix in 2024?
