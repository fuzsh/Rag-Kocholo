They have like 5 endings that shuffle between them every episode and both openings are really good (specially the first one).\n\nI'll say that it is the kind of anime that you leave playing in the background and then come ... back to really pay attention to the transformations and the music.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI'm certainly tired of Yo-kai Watch trying to get attention from other grown-ups especially with teens and such what. Shadowside is good enough with:\n\n- The Stories is some episodes good compared to the original, having a more darker tone in this series.\n\n- The 5th movie, Forever Friends is good similar to the anime and the only good movie in the Yo-kai Watch series\n\n- Like the Yo-kais during the future timeline compared to original, as they have the ability to transform into their Shadowside form.\n\nCompared to Shadowside, Yo-kai Watch had once again copied the notes from other series like they copied from ... Digimon (Having creatures transform) and this time, they copied from My Hero Academia. I mean the opening of the series is good. But there are many issues with the anime.\n\n- Jiba Jinpei, the main character looks like Jibanyan fusing with Boruto Uzumaki from the series of the same name to have a bratty personality. Their voice looks almost the same but different voice actors.\n\n- All of Jiba's forms look like they are made from Sonic the Hedgehog especially the comics; anthropomorphic cat forms with connected eyes like Sonic. Even his main form looks like Jibanyan as a Sonic character.\n\n- They used My Hero Academia overall for everything in the series to mix it with the Yo-kai Watch series. Even some filler episodes are getting way boring similar to the original.\n\n- Some people would not like the idea that they turn them to humans. Probably except for Komasan & some human based Yo-kai like Fubiki-Hime.\n\nWhisper turned into a antagonist and he's even more weird.\n\nThe only good thing about the series is that:\n\n- The fights from the 6th Movie is good, similar to Pokemon XY.\n\n- The only character from the previous series to return is Enma-Daio. Other human characters from the previous series came back as minor characters (But different characters) like Keisuke Amano from Shadowside.\n\n- The series is connected to the previous Yo-kai Watch Series due to Soranaki, the main antagonist from Shadowside & made a comeback to the original.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nInterest Stacks\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecent News\n\nSpring 2020 Anime Postponements Due to COVID-19 Outbreak [Update 1/14]\n\n[Update] Further coronavirus-related delays can be viewed here.
