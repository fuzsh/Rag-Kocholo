That is the case with the timepiece that is given to young Nate by ghostly creature Whisper, who also serves as his butler. The watch allows him to see supernatural creatures known as Yo-kai, which are normally invisible to humans. While wearing the watch, Nate is also able to summon the Yo-kai he has befriended, enabling him to utilize the creatures' powers. Using the power of the Yo-kai, Nate goes around town, resolving trouble that he encounters.",
