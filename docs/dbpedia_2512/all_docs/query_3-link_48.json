        "text": "The politics of Fed independence\n\nA lot of folks like to weigh in on what the Federal Reserve should do with interest rates; Donald Trump said this week that if he were to reoccupy the White House, he should have a say in setting monetary policy. But keeping the Fed free of political pressure is important for several reasons. We'll get into them. Also: Oklahoma tribal nations fill a gap in federal food aid for kids, Oregon ranchers deal with major wildfire losses, and theme park attendance dips.\n\nThe politics of Fed independence\n\nListen · 25:45 25:45\n\nThis back-to-school season, “value” is at the top of America’s shopping list\n\nThe back-to-school shopping season is well underway. But with stubborn high prices in this economy, how will parents get their kids ready without feeling financially burdened? Also: decoding quarterly earnings, what goes into pricing mortgage rates, and why airport food is so expensive. Plus: A projectionist remembers his reel life.\n\nThis back-to-school season, “value” is at the top of America’s shopping list\n\nListen · 25:31 25:31\n\nThis back-to-school season, \"value\" is at the top of America's shopping list\n\nThe back-to-school shopping season is well underway.

But has the Fed ever found that sweet spot? It would be easier to answer if the economy wasn't always in flux. Also: Disney's streaming service posts its first profit, what we can learn from women entrepreneurs of the 19th century, and noise from a bitcoin mine haunts people in a rural Texas town.\n\nHas the Fed ever met its 2 goals?\n\nListen · 25:36 25:36\n\nWhy we freak out when the stock market freaks out\n\nHow are people feeling about the economy after the dramatic drop in stocks? They’re “Googling the word ‘recession’ like crazy,” an economics professor told us. On the show today: Why perception is so important in economics. Also: The not-so-bad reasons for the higher unemployment rate, what the Google antitrust ruling could mean for Big Tech, and stealth shopping — hiding purchases from partners — is on the rise.\n\nWhy we freak out when the stock market freaks out\n\nListen · 25:28 25:28\n\nWhy we freak out when the stock market freaks out\n\nHow are people feeling about the economy after the dramatic drop in stocks?

Global markets, including the major U.S. indexes, tanked today. Along with stocks, crude oil prices also took a hit. We’ll look at the causes and what might happen next. Also, the critical role of exporting services in this economy and a status report on a possible TikTok sale.\n\n“Chaotic,” “volatile,” “tumultuous”\n\nListen · 25:45 25:45\n\n\"Chaotic,\" \"volatile,\" \"tumultuous\"\n\nThese aren't words you want to hear about the stock market, but here we are.

One sector that took a hit is information and entertainment. That includes data processors, moviemakers, software publishers and — ahem — broadcasters and news websites. Do those job losses signal a meaningful change or was it just an off month for the field? Plus, shipping rates may come down next year, the Spanish-language interpretation industry is expected to grow, and remember when cellphones had antennas?\n\nThe information industry takes a hit\n\nListen · 25:47 25:47\n\nMaking more stuff without working more hours\n\nStrong productivity growth last quarter coupled with recent wage growth means we're generating more output and, at least to some extent, getting paid for it. In this episode, why productivity growth prevents a wage-price spiral. Plus, California wants to build an offshore wind turbine assembly plant, national economics impact national performance in the Olympics and equity-rich homeowners can't do much with their housing wealth right now.\n\nMaking more stuff without working more hours\n\nListen · 27:37 27:37"
