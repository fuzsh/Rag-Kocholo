        "text": "It’s the heart of docuseries season for the NFL.\n\nWith the first iteration of an offseason-themed Hard Knocks in the books, the traditional training camp series premieres Tuesday night, chronicling preparations for the season from the Bears and No. 1 draft pick Caleb Williams (above). Chicago has already played one exhibition contest—Thursday’s Hall of Fame Game against the Texans—that should offer some immediate behind-the-scenes content for viewers.\n\nLast Tuesday brought the finale of Hard Knocks: Offseason with the New York Giants, a first-of-its-kind five-episode season following the springtime front-office happenings like the NFL combine, draft, and free agency. But instead of the typical storylines around players and coaches that viewers may be used to, it was New York general manager Joe Schoen and his top scouts who were the show’s main stars.\n\nPlenty of good reviews came in for the series, and some suggested there was even too much secretive information revealed—a stark contrast to previous editions. Schoen was often shown strategizing with Giants owner John Mara, who was not happy with the decision by Saquon Barkley to sign with NFC East rival Philadelphia.\n\n“I was certainly a little nervous about it going in,” Mara told the New York Post. “It was a pretty honest depiction of what goes on, and I think people appreciated having that kind of access. … There were some uncomfortable moments in there, but all-in-all, I’m glad it’s over.”\n\nReady for More?\n\nThe NFL hasn’t announced whether the offseason version of Hard Knocks will return in 2025. But with the expansion of the show a key part of the NFL’s continued efforts to take over the sports calendar, there won’t be much time off for the franchise this fall.\n\nIn December, the now three-year-old in-season version of the series will begin documenting all four teams in the AFC North throughout the end of the regular season and into the playoffs. Last year, the in-season Hard Knocks followed the Dolphins through a loss in the wild card round. This year, four teams being under the microscope increases the chances of bringing more exclusive postseason content.\n\nNetflix Is Here, Too\n\nNetflix’s prowess as a force in sports docuseries reached the NFL last year with the debut of Quarterback, which followed three signal-callers—including Patrick Mahomes—throughout the 2022 season. Despite being headed up by Peyton Manning’s Omaha Productions, the show struggled to find more willing quarterback participants for a second season and ultimately pivoted.\n\nDuring the 2023 season, Netflix followed four wideouts—Justin Jefferson (Vikings), Davante Adams (Raiders), Amon-Ra St. Brown (Lions), and Deebo Samuel (49ers), as well as one tight end, San Francisco’s George Kittle, to create Receiver. The show, which was released in July, reached the No. 1 spot on Netflix’s top-10 most-watched list for several days. Plans for yet another follow-up during the 2024 season have not been announced.\n\nAmerica’s Team\n\nStill to come in the NFL documentary space is a 10-episode series exploring Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and the growth of his business empire in the 1990s. A release date has not been announced, but the project is in partnership with Skydance Sports, which is partially owned by the NFL and also collaborates on Hard Knocks.\n\nThe NBA is looking at expanding across the pond—and it’s not just for a few friendly exhibitions.\n\nCommissioner Adam Silver told the Associated Press that the league is having “much more serious” talks with FIBA, basketball’s governing body, about expansion in Europe, either with a tournament or even a league.\n\nTalks between the two sides have ramped up since the NBA finalized its media-rights deals last month. Silver has said before that the NBA would look to expand once its broadcasting negotiations were finished, though the belief was that the league would focus on adding to its current crop of 30 franchises.\n\n“We certainly haven’t made any definitive decisions,” Silver said. “I continue to believe there’s enormous opportunity here. It’s not something where we’ll transform a league structure in the short term. But I think that there’s an appetite among our team owners for additional investment in global basketball.”\n\nGlobal League\n\nThe NBA has launched several initiatives across different countries and continents around the globe. In 2016, the league opened the NBA Academy, which is a development camp for high school prospects in Senegal, Mexico, and Australia. NBA players like Josh Giddey and Dyson Daniels have participated in these camps, and in June, Cameroon’s Ulrich Chomche became the first player to be drafted directly from the NBA Academy.\n\nIn 2019, the NBA also launched the Basketball Africa League, which could be a model for the NBA should it decide to open a league in Europe. However, it will face stiffer competition in Europe, as the continent holds the EuroLeague, the second-best pro basketball league in the world.\n\n“We have a huge initiative in China. We have a huge initiative in Africa,” Silver said. “Given the quality of the basketball here in Europe, it would seem to make sense that we should be doing something here as well.”\n\nThe NBA has been looking to improve its initiatives in Europe for a while. The league played its first game in Europe in 1984 and has regularly sent teams for preseason and regular-season games since 1993. European clubs have also returned the favor by playing some NBA teams in the U.S. during preseason as well.\n\nThe World’s Finest\n\nThe next few years may be the best time for the league to expand in Europe. There were 125 international players on NBA rosters before the start of the 2023–2024 season, including 64 from Europe. The last two No. 1 overall selections in the NBA draft were from France, while the last six MVP awards were won by international players.\n\nThe 2024 Olympics have shown that the U.S. is still a basketball juggernaut, but many of the league’s brightest and most popular American stars are in their twilight years, including LeBron James, Steph Curry, and Kevin Durant. European stars like Nikola Jokić, Luka Dončić, and Giannis Antetokounmpo are in the prime of their careers, and the young Frenchman Victor Wembanyama (above) could be poised to take the crown from James as the face of the sport."
