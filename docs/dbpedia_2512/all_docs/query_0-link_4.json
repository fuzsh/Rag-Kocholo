        "text": "Doctor C's Dark Medical Records (Japanese: ドクターＣの闇カルテ, Dokutā C no yami karute) is the 23rd episode of the Yo-kai Watch Shadowside anime. It was broadcasted in Japan on September 7, 2018.\n\nSummary[]\n\nAt school, the news that handsome actor Ken Sakiyama has announced that he is taking leave from work is making the rounds. It’s not just Sakiyama. Many handsome actors have been taking leave, one after another, which is even being discussed on \"Usuranura\". At that point, Tate comes into the office, panicking, and says: “Ken Sakiyama is at the park!”. When Summer and the others rush to the park, they find Sakiyama, with an atmosphere around him that’s very unlike that of a celebrity. According to him, it seems he had no choice but to take leave after a monster called “Dr. Chameleon” took him to an abandoned hospital when he was on his way home, and drained his “handsome aura”. The detective team heads to said abandoned hospital right away.\n\nPlot[]\n\nTemplate:Empty section\n\nCharacters[]\n\nSummer\n\nTate\n\nCole\n\nBruno\n\nIsabelle\n\nKen Sakiyama\n\nTheo\n\nYo-kai[]\n\nShadowside Jibanyan\n\nWhisper\n\nSly\n\nSuper Sly\n\nMinamoto\n\nJunior\n\nShibumenken (mentioned)\n\nLeon/Dr. Chameleon\n\nTrivia[]"
