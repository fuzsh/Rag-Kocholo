        "text": "All Yo-kai Watch 4 discussion/speculation/madness remains here.\n\nIt's been confirmed by Level-5 that Yo-kai Watch 4 is coming to Switch this year in Japan.\n\nAkihiro Hino, a Level-5 employee:\n\nResetEra member Chris1964 seems to think it could release in Japan at the end of the year.\n\nLevel 5 won't release 2 major IPs at the same period. If Inazuma Eleven is summer Yo-kai Watch is fall/winter.\n\nAlso, the game is expected to follow the darker visual of the most recent movie:\n\nWell the anime just debuted. I just want it for crying out loud. And TBH Yokai Watch was fine to me, just expand on what's already there.\n\nYAAAASSS\n\nI still need to watch it. But the first two episodes debuted last week as an 1 hour special.\n\nThe reviews were glowing. [citation needed]\n\nHuh, i didn't know about the change in tone, do we know how japanese people (aka the biggest and probably only target for the game) are reacting to this?\n\nI've heard a little bit about how some of the early episodes of Shadowside scared some of the younger viewers... but that's what they're going for! I watched a bit of the first episode. Jibanyan with a really gruff/deep voice is... fantastic?\n\nAlso, YW3 has yet to even come out over here. I can't imagine they'll skip that.\n\nI thought it was already confirmed to be a summer 2018 release in Japan?\n\nI doubt we'll get it outside of Japan this year since we don't even have Yo-kai Watch 3 yet, but if they wanted to try to close the gap between Japanese and international releases this would be a good time to do it...\n\nI can't say I'm loving the Yo-kai redesigns, but it's more Yo-kai Watch so I can't complain! I just worry about the localization, both how long it will take and the quality of it. With news of the anime dub being recast, I don't have high hopes for quality, sadly...\n\nI can't believe Level 5 still has my wallet after all these years of hey let's play soccer on space\n\nWith that said, YW Shadowside (the anime) is slaying me. A tonal shift that I'm also expecting from the game. Let's see how they will deal with the whole redeeming aspect of it? How will you capture youkai now if in the anime they only turn into \"medals\" if you free them from their (non-)existential pain?\n\nI did see the first couple episodes of Shadowside. It kind of expects you to see the movie first but I still got the gist of it.\n\nI like the concept of Lightside and Shadowside. Jibanyan, Komasan and Slimmander look different depending on which way their key is turned in the Yo-kai Watch. Yeah no more medals, it's keys now. It will be interesting to see how the game incorporates that idea.\n\nLevel 5 wanted to take greater control of the localizations.\n\nAnd as we see with Busters, that has yet to happen. It seems like L5 relinquished YW to Nintendo in favor of non-YW stuff. That Lady Layton game is the only game they done themselves so far, and I expect Inazuma Eleven and possibly Snack World to follow suit. Not a lot of manpower to do 3 YW games (they could always outsource, I guess). And if they try to sync up with the anime, then the games will always be late\n\nIt's already been announced that it will take a darker approach and release in summer.\n\nNo it hasn't. The only thing that's been announced is that characters from the Yo-kai Watch Shadowside anime will appear in the game. Its release date is 2018 in Japan, it hasn't been narrowed down to a specific season.\n\nAh, I too remember when Yo-kai Watch was a PS3 game.\n\nI don't mind a darker tone (even though I don't think it's a great idea to revitalize the franchise—a reboot in the vein of new Pokémon generations would have worked better) but I hope they will keep the same structure of previous games.\n\nIn my opinion, the best thing about YW games is the world and how many details you can find by exploring it. So I want Level-5 to keep the exploration aspect intact and expand on this, following what they did with YW3.\n\nI also prefer the camera to be top-down as the previous games rather than behind the character in the first prototype shown in 2011. It would speed up exploration.\n\nIn terms of battle systems, I always liked the gameplay so I hope they don't change much the original formula.\n\nNo it hasn't. The only thing that's been announced is that characters from the Yo-kai Watch Shadowside anime will appear in the game. Its release date is 2018 in Japan, it hasn't been narrowed down to a specific season.\n\nAh, I too remember when Yo-kai Watch was a PS3 game.\n\nYW prototype was never announced for any console. it was a proof of concept\n\nThey are not going to localize this game before YW3. At the earliest, I would expect this title to come out in the West next year.\n\nWell, the change in tone in going to turn off a lot of young viewers.\n\nDon't be discouraged. Sudden tone change will do that, and I don't recall the first series being a regular in the later episodes.\n\nWait, are we getting 3 or what?\n\nWe should eventually.\n\nI know a Spanish ad appeared saying \"New Video Game in 2018\". Probably referring to Busters though.\n\nThis is just for when 4 comes out in Japan.\n\nI'm looking forward to this. Kinda burned out with the third and didn't bother with busters 2 but being on the switch is making me interested.\n\nWondering how long they will stick with it if it doesn't catch though. I'm playing snack world right now and it's pretty good but they just finished the anime suddenly, they say there's a 2nd season coming but it feels like maybe they've given up on it\n\nI know a people dislike the shift, but even as someone who loved Yokai for how cute it was, I'm hyped by this tonal shift. I think they could have gone on for a few more seasons before making the shift, but I'm not opposed to it. As for will it come over this year, seems highly unlikely considering we don't even have 3 yet. But in my wildest dreams I will continue to hope that Nintendo decides to push for a \"soft reboot\" and just call the series Yokai Watch Shadow Side 1 and release it in the West before 3.\n\nEnded up watching Shadowside Episode 1 because I didn't realize it released until reading this thread, and boy oh boy. I'm liking it even more than the original YW anime. It has the same sense of humor as the original, but a darker twist and creepier yokai, as well as better fight sequences. It's really something else.\n\nWatching the fourth episode of Shadowside... I have no idea how this will air on American TV.\n\nNot for horror or violence, but for when the Yo-kai of the Week turns Light Side and turns really lewd.\n\nI had hoped the perverted jokes would stay with the original series but I guess not!\n\nI hated that scene. Argh, the humor with masculine bodies can't end soon enough. It's super creepy. They are kids!\n\nYokai Watch 3 was fantastic and easily my most played game on 3DS ever (250 hours or something). Love this series and can't wait for the latest iteration. At least Level-5 attempt to innovate in their two-decade-old franchise...*cough* sorry, five-year-old franchise.\n\nHonestly, the joy of playing YW (and YW3 more specifically) is its wickedly addictive post-game with random events, difficult gatcha odds, and insanely expansive Yokai Watch Busters T side-game; something Pokemon games sorely lack. Once I beat the Elite 4, there is usually a few hours of extra content at best.\n\nI really don't like the new anime series. It's 100% made to try and go for an older demographic but I don't think it'll pick up. For me it's too boring and drab compared to the old series.\n\nWhat about it was boring to you? The humor is perfectly spot on with the old series. Shadowside is basically OG YW turned shonen, but the original's dna shines pretty clearly."
