        "text": "Yo-kai Watch Episode 23 Information Season 1 Number 23 English titles Komasan in Love Episode 3, Yo-kai Grubsnitch, Yo-kai B3-NK1 Japanese titles Komasan Shīzun 3 Koi to Poemu to Kōhī to Sanbaime (コマさんシーズン3 恋とポエムとコーヒーと 3杯目), Yōkai Tsumamiguinosuke (妖怪つまみぐいのすけ), Yōkai Karakuri Benkei (妖怪からくりベンケイ) Original air date June 20, 2014 English air date January 13, 2016 (AU); March 1, 2016 (US) Channel Disney XD Previous Yo-kai Watch Episode 22 Next Yo-kai Watch Episode 24 Discussion Episode 23 Forum Post\n\nYo-kai Watch Episode 23 is an episode of Yo-kai Watch Anime. It consists of Komasan in Love Episode 3, Yo-kai Grubsnitch and Yo-kai B3-NK1.\n\nKomasan in Love Episode 3\n\nAfter a brief recap of Komasan’s previous lovey-dovey adventures, Komasan and Komajiro are following the mystery lady down the street, determined to protect her. Komajiro is impressed by Komasan’s vigilance, but Komasan urges his brother to stay out of harm’s way. Before they can resolve their dispute, they notice a menacing-looking guy approaching the lady. Komasan is ready for action, but it turns out that the stranger is just a nice guy looking for directions.\n\nNevertheless, Komasan is resolved to watch over the object of his affections. At a crosswalk, Komasan gets another shock when he hears her talking on her cellphone again, saying “It looks like we’re going to have to get rid of him”, envisioning her tossing a man over a cliff into the sea. Concerned that she’s making a bad choice, Komasan cries out to her right as she’s entering the crosswalk. This causes her to drop a folder she was carrying, sending drawings flying everywhere.\n\nKomajiro picks up one of the drawings, and surprisingly it’s a manga page that contains the same phrases that Komasan heard the woman saying earlier. A short while later, Komasan has assumed his human form to give the woman back her drawings. Turns out she’s a writer and Komasan has fallen even further in love with her, watching her fondly as she walks away.\n\nYo-kai Grubsnitch\n\nNate is sitting down to eat breakfast with his mom and his dad. His mom’s just put the food on the table, when suddenly her eyes change and she snatches a piece of food from Nate’s plate. Nate’s dad suggests she have something to eat too, but seems like Nate’s mom isn’t hungry any more.\n\nOn the way home after school, Nate’s feeling pretty hungry. Good thing his mom cooked a ton of food for dinner! But something’s not quite right, as Nate’s mom tells him not to eat anything before his dad gets home—before snatching up some of the food herself, then blaming Nate for it! Nate insists that his mom is the one snacking before dinner, but she continues to blame him, even as she’s eating right in front of him!\n\nNate feels his mom is acting weird and that a Yo-kai might be the cause of it. Before Whisper can even blow him off, Nate has used the Yo-kai Watch to spot the culprit! Whisper makes a quick recovery and explains that they’re dealing with Grubsnitch, a Yo-kai that convinces people to snack on food instead of eating a proper meal. His powers are in full effect on Nate’s mom, as she snacks and samples to her heart’s content.\n\nIf Nate doesn’t stop his mom she’s going to eat all the food before his dad gets home, so he and Whisper decide to protect the food. Grubsnitch isn’t giving up that easy though, as he quickly distracts Nate and Whisper and snatches some more food. Next, Grubsnitch switches off the lights in the room and steals more food while Nate can’t see!\n\nNate scolds Grubsnitch, who pretends to apologize and grabs more food. It seems like there’s no end to the dirty tricks Grubsnitch will play, so Nate calls out Hungramps to take care of this situation. Whisper is a little confused on how Hungramps is going to stop Grubsnitch’s thievery, but Hungramps works his magic and makes Nate’s mom hungry for a real meal. This foils\n\nGrubsnitch’s plan, because now Nate’s mom is so hungry that she wants more than just a snack.Grubsnitch isn’t giving up though, as he activates his powers on Nate’s mom once more, making her want to snack again. Hungramps and Grubsnitch duel over Nate’s mom for a while, with Whisper helping out by fanning the delicious aromas toward her. Finally, Nate’s mom eats more than just a bite, foiling Grubsnitch’s plans.\n\nVictorious, Nate claims Grubsnitch’s Yo-kai Medal. Before he has time to celebrate, Hungramps makes him and his mom hungry, so they decide to dig into dinner, much to Whisper’s concern. Later, Nate’s dad arrives home only to find that dinner’s already been eaten up, and it looks like he’s just having cup ramen for dinner.\n\nYo-kai B3-NK1\n\nNate’s sitting down to watch some TV, but it doesn’t look like the TV’s working. Not long after, his mom mentions that the washer isn’t working, and his dad’s razor won’t turn on either. Nate’s mom goes to call an electrician, but her phone is completely out of battery! Before Whisper even has time to protest, Nate’s already got the Yo-kai Watch out and discovers B3-NK1, a robot Yo-kai that destroys machines and steals their screws!\n\nB3-NK1 is not amused by Nate’s lack of respect for him, and quickly destroys the vacuum cleaner right in front of him and taking its screws. B3-NK1 claims that once his sword absorbs 1,000 screws it will become unstoppable. Not just normal screws though, important screws that make the machines work. B3-NK1 is at 999 screws and just needs one more screw for his sword—but Nate is not about to let that happen, summoning Robonyan.\n\nB3-NK1 wastes no time in skewering Robonyan to take a screw from him. Nate and Whisper are aghast, until Robonyan starts laughing—apparently it only tickles him because he’s too complicated for B3-NK1 to get to his screw. B3-NK1 continues trying to skewer him but Robonyan seems to be enjoying it quite a bit, making it clear that B3-NK1 is making no progress.\n\nStumped, B3-NK1 is about to give up because he thinks Robonyan has no screws, but Robonyan urges him to continue the “reconfiguration” to find the screw he needs. Eventually Robonyan starts smoking and breaking down, and things get a little scary as Robonyan seems to glitch out for a bit. Finally, Robonyan’s golden screw finally comes out and is absorbed into B3-NK1’s sword, causing it to morph and become golden.\n\nB3-NK1 is quite grateful for Nate’s help, and hands over his Yo-kai Medal. No time to celebrate though, some kind of alarm is coming from Robonyan’s body-- The self-destruct sequence has been activated!! Nate and Whisper panic, but Jibanyan has Robonyan’s manual on hand. Whisper discovers that Robonyan’s designed to explode if he ever stops working properly, and they have just 30 seconds to stop it!\n\nNate tells B3-NK1 to give Robonyan back his screw to stop the self-destruct sequence, but B3-NK1 can’t take the screw out of his sword. There’s no time left and Robonyan’s counting down from 10! At the last second, Jibanyan punches Robonyan… and instead of exploding, Robonyan reboots and returns to normal. Robonyan immediately demands B3-NK1 “reoptimize” his other systems, and the episode ends as everyone tries to stop that from happening.\n\nCharacters\n\nHumans\n\nNate\n\nYokai"
