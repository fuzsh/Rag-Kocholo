Then it’s time to strap on your spirit-finding arm accessory and turn the old Crank-a-kai up to 11 as Yo-Kai Watch 2 finally makes it to Western shores.\n\nBelow is a quick, handy-dandy guide to the story campaign of the game, regardless if you have “Yo-Kai Watch 2: Bony Spirits” or “Yo-Kai Watch 2: Fleshy Souls.” The goal here is to list what you need to do and where you need to go for the game’s main key quests using as minimal information as possible about the story. I wouldn’t quite say it’s spoiler-free as some of the actions listed do reveal some of the story. Still, if you want learn how to progress through the campaign’s key quests while minimizing spoilers as much as possible, this quick story quest guide is for you.\n\nAlso, feel free to let me know if you see any errors and I shall fix them post haste.\n\nChapter 1: The Vanishing Watch\n\nStep 1: Go home to your house in Uptown Springdale and talk to your mom. Then leave the house and talk to your dad. You will receive $10.00.\n\nStep 2: Go to the Doughnuts area of Shopper’s Row. Buy a box of donuts from either Spirits or Souls Doughnuts.\n\nStep 3: Go back home with the donuts and talk to your dad.\n\nStep 4: Time to catch some bugs. Go to your house and get your bug net.\n\nStep 5: Go to the park and talk to your friends. Search the nearby trees, grass and flowers for bugs and catch 3 of them.\n\nStep 6: Head to the Memory Store behind Everymart Uptown. After receiving your new equipment, go outside and use the Crank-a-kai.\n\nStep 7: Head to the Uptown Fish Place. Use your Yo-Kai Lens to look for Jibanyan. Head back to the Memory Store.\n\nStep 8: On the way home, search the garbage area. Battle Brushido.\n\nChapter 2: Hi-Tech Hide-and-Seek\n\nStep 1: Head to the Sacred Tree on Mt. Wildwood.\n\nStep 2: Use the Yo-kai Lens when you run into an invisible barrier. Fight Blowcade.\n\nStep 3: Use the Crank-a-kai after acquiring a special coin. Pick between Tattletell, Manjimutt or Roughraff.\n\nStep 4: On the way home, you will encounter a troubled person and trigger a request. Just give the person what he’s asking for and you’ll clear it.\n\nStep 5: Clear Key Quests at Springdale Elementary and Everymart at Uptown Springdale. At the elementary school, use your Yo-Kai Lens on the goal post to reveal Nosirs and trigger a battle. At Everymart, you will need to find a Hungramps to station at the Baffle Board spot outside. You will find Hungramps at the kitchen in your house. Give him a Plum Rice Ball then take him to the store. Now you can really go home.\n\nStep 6: Head to Breezy Hills. Meet Eddie at Gourd Pond to trigger an event.\n\nStep 7: Follow the drifting Walkappa and get ahead so you can rendezvous with it down the river. Once you catch up, use your Yo-kai watch on Eddie’s watch. Chase after Yoink.\n\nStep 8: Give chase all the way to Gourd Pond. Then give chase up to Springdale. Continue your chase until you reach a wall and climb up. Head to the alley dungeon just north of the Everymart. Talk to the cat then battle Yoink.\n\nStep 8: Go into the manhole and explore the sewer. You’ll reach a dead end. Use the Yo-Kai Lens, then battle Swelton.\n\nChapter 3: School Is Strange\n\nStep 1: Talk to Jibanyan, then head to your school.\n\nStep 2: Head to the staff room and talk to your homeroom teacher. Head to your classroom and check your desk. Battle with Baku.\n\nStep 3: Head back home and talk to your mom to trigger the dinner mini-game. The higher your score, the better your reward.\n\nStep 4: Go to Blossom Heights and visit the “Timers & More” Watch Shop just west of Bear’s house. You will acquire the Wanted Yo-Kai list.\n\nStep 5: Go to the Gourd Pond Museum and head to the second floor. Find the Timers & More owner Mr. Goodsight and talk to him. This guy...\n\nStep 6: Clear the following three key quests. One involves Professor Gately at the Gourd Pond Museum, who is investigating the Gates of Whimsy. Another requires you to go to the Community Center in Uptown Springdale and take part in an official battle. For the third quest, go to the temple in Blossom Hills and talk to the monk to learn about fusions.\n\nStep 7: Head to Timers & More and talk to Goodsight. Then go south from Timers & More and visit the medicine shop to get his medication. Bring the medicine back to Goodsight. Head back to your house and sleep.\n\nStep 8: Go to the Whattafind antique store in Shopper’s Row to retrieve Goodman’s Pro Screwdriver. Return the screwdriver to Goodman. Smack him with his fancy screwdriver (just kidding, but I really wish you could).\n\nStep 9: Head to your school. After being unable to go in through the front gate, go around to enter from the right side. Make it to the top floor without being hit by the giant gashapon balls. Get ready for a bone-chilling boss fight.\n\nChapter 4: Let’s Go to Harrisville!\n\nStep 1: Talk to your mom to receive $10. You are now set for life. Head to Shopper’s Row to buy either Soul or Spirit doughnuts. Go back to the house and talk to your mom again, who will give you another $10 in pocket money for your train and bus fare plus directions to grandma's house.\n\nStep 2: Go to Springdale Central Station in Downtown Springdale. Head to the East train platform and buy a $3 Day Pass. Take the nonstop express to Fortune Place to save time (you can also take the local line to San Fantastico and get off at Fortune Place but your train will stop at every station along the way). At Fortune Place, transfer to the Echo Line and take the train to Harrisville. Once you disembark in Harrisville, click on the bus schedule at the bus stop to make the bus arrive. Pay $2 and take it to Harrisville. You feel your $10 nest egg slowly slipping away.\n\nStep 3: Meet grandma at the Harrisville bus stop. Head with her to the house while stopping to do errands along the way. Make sure to buy Bamboo Shoots from the store to save time later.\n\nStep 4: Clear three Key Quests: True Hide-and-Seek, No Time for Fishin!, and Secrets of Soulcery. The first requires finding some hiding kids within a set amount of time. The second requires you to catch a set amount of carp. The latter will require you to give Bamboo Shoots to the temple’s grand monk.\n\nStep 5: Head to Mount Middleton in the northernmost part of Harrisville to reach Fullface Rock. and talk to Mirapo to befriend him. Eventually, you will want to use your Yo-Kai Lens on a spot that appears to be impervious to rain to reveal a new Yo-Kai.\n\nStep 6: Use Mirapo to warp back to grandma’s house. Talk to grandma and have dinner.\n\nStep 7: Accompany Jibanyan outside to the toilet. Lol. Defeat Snobetty and two Mochismo then go back to bed.\n\nStep 8: Check on grandma to trigger an event. Head to the storehouse outside to investigate.\n\nChapter 5: Wind it Back 60 Years!\n\nStep 1: Enter the house then leave to trigger an event.\n\nStep 2: Head to the secret base of your grandfather (Nathaniel Adams if using the boy character or Kenny Forester if using the girl character) and check out the sparkling spot. Head to the train station after that.\n\nStep 3: Head to the left side just outside the train station and use your Yo-Kai Lens to uncover Miradox. You now have the ability to travel between time periods.\n\nStep 4: Use the steam train to travel to Old Springdale. Clear the following three Key Quests: Timers & More’s Part, The Shrine’s Part and the Ironworks’ Part. To clear the first quest, you will need to return to the present and acquire a spicy Heckapeno pepper from the curry shop so Goodsight can hopefully choke on it. The second quest requires you to visit the shrine in the past and use your Yo-Kai Lens near one of the statues to reveal Komasan, who asks you to find a letter for him. Head to the old Shopper’s Row district and head inside. From there, access the alley dungeon to the right and keep walking right until you reach a torii gate. Head inside it and investigate the mini shrine to get the letter, then head back to Komasan. For the third quest, go to the Ironworks facility in the past and you’ll receive a mysterious orb that allows you to see Yo-Kai. Go inside the building, search for Badsmella and battle her.\n\nStep 5: Head back to your grandfather’s secret base.\n\nChapter 6: Yokai Watch Model Zero\n\nStep 1: Talk to Hovernyan at the bridge near the shrine. Check out the Faux Kappa statue.\n\nStep 2: You will need to clear five key quests:\n\nFind Faux Kappa!\n\nFind Pallysol!\n\nFind Gnomey!\n\nFind Predictabull!\n\nFind Mermaidyn!\n\nGo back to the present and free Faux Kappa by investigating his statue. Pallysol can be found at Mount Middleton while Gnomey is inside your grandma’s house. Predictabull is in the observation deck of Excellent Tower. Finding Mermaidyn will require a bit more effort and patience. First, you might want to bring some Ramen products. After that, go to the school in Harrisville then use the Yo-Kai Lens inside the restroom. Head outside the school and talk to Toiletta to play a game. Travel by train to San Fantastico and head east to the cave by the sea. Use your Yo-Kai Lens at different spots in the cave to uncover three Baffle Boards. They will correspond to Wiglin, Steppa and Rhyth, who you will also need to find and befriend (ungh) in order to be able to raise or lower the water levels at key spots. All three can be found in the cave so keep searching and returning to Eyepo to replenish your health. If you brought some Ramen, you can try giving it to them in battle to increase your chances of recruiting them. Use your Target function to pick a Yo-Kai to give Ramen to if the Yo-Kai you want is not standing in the middle of its party during battle. By the way, this part ends in a boss battle so make sure your health and spirit power are refilled before getting to the end.\n\nStep 3: Go back to your grandfather’s secret base. Get ready for one of the more annoying boss battles in the game. If you need a hint, here is my key tip: Make sure you defeat both bosses at the same time so they do not resurrect. In my case, I made sure to evenly reduce their health by using the Target function to pin the enemy I need to hit then finished both of them off with an M Skill attack that hits multiple targets like Jibanyan’s Paws of Fury M.\n\nChapter 7: The Storm is Here!\n\nStep 1: You will need to finish three key quests once again: Jibanyan’s Secret, Retrace Dad’s Steps and Go For Rank B!\n\nStep 2: To find Jibanyan, step out of your house and talk to Komasan, who will be southwest from your house. Head next toward the bakery and talk to Noko. Then head northwest toward the riverbank. Get some tissue (in real life, not in the game).\n\nStep 3: If you didn’t dislike using the train before, the Retrace Dad’s Steps quest will likely change your mind. First, go to Sunshine Station and talk to the station platform attendant. Next, go to Spring Station and talk to the station platform attendant there. Then go to Fortune Place Station and, yep, talk to the station platform attendant there. After that, head to your father’s Office building in Downtown Springdale’s Business District. You will now need to find and befriend the turtle Yo-Kai Flushback, who can be seen in San Fantastico. Normally, he likes soba noodles. (I didn’t have soba so I just chucked rice balls at every Flushback I came across instead. You’re gonna have rice balls, Flushback, and you’re gonna like it!). Return to your dad.\n\nStep 4: Go to the Bike Shop in Blossom Heights\n\nStep 5: Talk to Goodsight at Timer’s & More to kick off your Rank B promotion quest. Head off the San Fantastico to battle the three monsters that Goodsight wants you to defeat. Chummer can be found at the Hidden Workshop mini-dungeon west of town. Chansin and Ben Tover can be found in the eastern cave where you did the Mermaidyn quest. Make sure you fight the ones with quest flags on their heads as regular versions of these monsters don’t count toward your quest.\n\nStep 6: Go home. Then head outside to check out what’s going on. Follow Brokenbrella until you reach the boss.\n\nChapter 8: Big Yo-Kai Battle\n\nStep 1: Head to Harrisville Station then use Miradox to go to the past. Head to Old Springdale station and talk to Hovernyan.\n\nStep 2: Check out the surrounding Yo-Kai. Talk to Tongus.\n\nStep 3: Head west toward the tunnel and go through it to reach the Yo-Kai battlefield at Flatpot Plains. Talk to the leader of your Yo-Kai faction.\n\nStep 4: Head to your faction’s mirror and protect it. Talk to your leader again.\n\nStep 5: Talk to Smogmella then start converting enemy stones to your side.\n\nStep 6: Approach the enemy commander’s position until you reach the barrier. Battle an enemy fighter.\n\nStep 7: Find the source of the enemy barrier’s power and take it down.\n\nStep 8: Fight the enemy commander.\n\nChapter 9: Master Nyada’s Trial\n\nStep 1: At the train station area of Old Springdale, approach Ray O’ Light and talk to him. Put up your dukes.\n\nStep 2: Head to the old Shopper’s Row district. Talk to your grandfather and give him the intel about Master Nyada. Remember, do or do not. There is no try. In order to be able to clear Master Nyada’s trials, your Yo-Kai Watch has to be Rank A so talk to Goodsight to take the promotion test. You will need to go to Nocturne Hospital near Shopper’s Square to fight Nird, Espy and Goruma. To reach Goruma, you will need to climb a vine in a room just south of the stairs in the second floor. This will get you to the third floor where Goruma is. His door is boarded up but if you need a hint, you can crawl through a hole in the wall from the room just to the right of Goruma.\n\nStep 3: Go to Harrisville and head north to Mount Middleton. You will need to clear three quests to pass Master Nyada’s trials.\n\nStep 4: Talk to Master Nyada to receive Nyada’s Trials IV, “The Trial of Courage.” This is basically a game of tag.\n\nStep 5: Talk to Master Nyada to receive Nyada’s Trials V, “The Trial of Love.” You will need to find five kittens. There should be one in the upper northeast part of the map. Another will be behind a wall that you can climb over. There’s also another kitten by the gate and another one by the well. Don’t quite remember where the fifth one is but it should be easy to find. Remember to rotate your camera view to help find them.\n\nStep 6: Talk to Master Nyada to receive Nyada’s Trials VI. Head to the top of the mountain to battle Demuncher. Try not to get any of your team members defeated as this refills Demuncher’s health.\n\nChapter 10: Back to Normal!\n\nStep 1: Go to Springdale to trigger an event and battle.\n\nStep 2: Talk to mom and dad, then leave your house.\n\nStep 3: Head to the Community Center. Use your Yo-Kai lens on the area to the left outside the center to reveal Miradox. Travel to the past once more.\n\nStep 4: Talk to your grandfather. At this point, you will be battling the Wicked Yo-Kai generals who are spread out across various parts of the city. Now would be a good time to either level up and evolve some of your team members or bring up to speed some lower level Yo-Kai who might have skills or elements that match well against the various bosses. I usually kept rebattling the Yo-Kai on the street northeast of Eyepo so I could heal and battle them over and over. Once you’re ready, head toward the flag locations. At the school is Unkaind, a water Yo-Kai. Untidy, an earth-element Yo-Kai, is by the pond. Lightning Yo-Kai Unkeen is at the Iron Works facility. Unpleasant, a wind Yo-Kai, is at the hospital.\n\nStep 5: Once you’ve defeated Dame Dedtime’s generals, it is time to face the boss lady herself. Head to the industrial area and make your way to Dedtime to trigger a fight with her. Any more information after this are potential spoilers so you can stop here if you’d prefer to figure out stuff yourself. Otherwise, you can keep reading below for more extra details.\n\nExtra details\n\nFinal battle: For your initial battle with Dedtime, you just need to whittle her down to half health. This will trigger a team switch where you control your grandfather’s team and battle Kin and Gin. As with your original battle with them, you have to take them down at the same time.\n\nFinal Final Battle: Once Kin and Gin are down, you resume your battle with Dedtime. Just beat her and the game is over.\n\nFinal Final Final Battle: Or not. Head outside and you’ll notice a dimensional rift. Check it and you will trigger the battle with Dedtime’s boosted giant form. Methods to take her down might vary but if you need a hint, the best strategy that worked for me during my fourth try was to target and pin her head so you can inflict damage on her main body while using multi-targeting Soultimate moves to hit her double dragons, too. When I did this, she didn’t use her crazy damaging skills as much (she practically spammed them when I pinned her dragons instead). If you notice several tadpole-looking spirits appear around her, use your Target ability to aim and then pin them. Pinning them will actually destroy them. Otherwise, they will inflict massive damage. Once they’re gone, pin Dedtime’s head once again.\n\nCongratulations, you’ve finished the main story and can now enjoy the post-game content. Make sure to check out the funky end credits!"
