        "text": "A new Pokemon series is currently streaming on Netflix, so there's no better time to refresh yourself on how to watch Pokemon TV in order. It's not quite that simple, however. As of writing, there are well over 1,200 episodes, dozens of films, and a sprinkling of specials and shorts to take into account.\n\nFirst, we'll show you how to watch the Pokemon series in order – including all 26 seasons, including the end of Ash's journey and the start of Liko's adventure in Pokemon Horizons: The Series. There's also the full list of Pokemon films in release order, so you can watch them alongside your mega Poke-binge.\n\nFrom there, we’ll present our sprawling, epic list of how to watch Pokemon in chronological order. That includes how all the movies and specials (roughly) fit in, right through to Ash's final episode. It’s not an exact science, but it’s a fun marathon for completionists. Gotta watch ‘em all, right?\n\nWe'll also clue you in on where you can watch every Pokemon season. When you take into account the removal of the Pokemon TV streaming service, it becomes even harder to track everything down. Knowing your Rokus from your Tubis will become essential if you want the full picture.\n\nThe below guide also covers other non-essential episodes, including some shorts and non-canon specials – such as ONAs like the brilliant Pokemon Origins. For more watch order guides, we've got a look at how to watch the Marvel movies in order. For more of an anime flavor, there's how to watch Demon Slayer in order and how to watch Attack on Titan in order. Then there's our rundown of everything we know so far about Jujutsu Kaisen season 3, One-Punch Man season 3, and our complete guide to new anime in 2024.\n\nPokemon: The Indigo League\n\nPokemon: Adventures in the Orange Islands\n\nPokemon: The Johto Journeys\n\nPokemon: Johto League Champions\n\nPokemon: Master Quest\n\nPokemon: Advanced\n\nPokemon: Advanced Challenge\n\nPokemon: Advanced Battle\n\nPokemon: Battle Frontier\n\nPokemon: Diamond and Pearl\n\nPokemon: Diamond and Pearl: Battle Dimension\n\nPokemon: Diamond and Pearl: Galactic Battles\n\nPokemon: Diamond and Pearl: Sinnoh League Victors\n\nPokemon: Black and White\n\nPokemon: Black and White: Rival Destinies\n\nPokemon: Black and White: Adventures in Unova and Beyond\n\nPokemon: XY\n\nPokemon: XY Kalos Quest\n\nPokemon: XYZ\n\nPokemon: Sun & Moon\n\nPokemon: Sun & Moon Ultra Adventures\n\nPokemon: Sun & Moon Ultra Legends\n\nPokemon: Journeys\n\nPokemon: Master Journeys\n\nPokemon: Ultimate Journeys\n\nPokemon: Horizons (ongoing)\n\nAbove is our guide on how to watch all of Pokemon in order. Yes, that means all 26 seasons. We start at Ash’s adventures in Kanto, before heading to the Orange Islands, then on to Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, and Galar – before ending Ash’s journey.\n\nLiko, from the Paldea region, is the current protagonist in Pokemon Horizons. The new series is currently airing, with the first 12 episodes airing on Netflix in the US and BBC in the UK. Part 2 of Horizons will be available from May 2024.\n\nOrdinarily, we would put a simple episode count next to each of these seasons – but that’s a fool’s errand here. Confusingly, the episode count differs by region and there are other factors to consider: Some episodes have been pulled or outright banned, while a couple of entries have never aired in the West. As such, we've kept it simple and only refer to the overall season name and number.\n\nPokemon: The First Movie (1999)\n\nPokemon: The Movie 2000 (2000)\n\nPokemon 3: The Movie (2001)\n\nPokemon 4Ever (2002)\n\nPokemon Heroes (2003)\n\nPokemon: Jirachi, Wish Maker (2004)\n\nPokemon: Destiny Deoxys (2005)\n\nPokemon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew (2006)\n\nPokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea (2007)\n\nPokemon: The Rise of Darkrai (2008)\n\nPokemon: Giratina and the Sky Warrior (2009)\n\nPokemon: Arceus and the Jewel of Life (2009)\n\nPokemon: Zoroark – Master of Illusions (2011)\n\nPokemon: Black – Victini and Reshiram/Pokemon: White – Victini and Zekrom (2011)\n\nPokemon: Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice (2012)\n\nPokemon: Genesect and the Legend Awakened (2013)\n\nPokemon: Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction (2014)\n\nPokemon: Hoopa and the Clash of Ages (2015)\n\nPokemon: Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel (2016)\n\nPokemon: I Choose You! (2017)\n\nPokemon: The Power of Us (2018)\n\nMewtwo Strikes Back: Evolution (2020)\n\nPokemon: Secrets of the Jungle (2021)\n\nAbove you'll find the complete watch order of Pokemon movies by release date.\n\nTo date, there have been 23 animated Pokemon movies. The first 19 up to Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel are all part of the mainline Pokemon series. While they are essentially canon, they rarely – if ever – impact the main series, and can be skipped if need be. Still, we really would recommend you seeking out the first five Pokemon movies at the very least.\n\nThe movies I Choose You, The Power of Us, and Secrets of the Jungle all take place in an alternate timeline from the main series and are either re-tellings, re-imaginings, or new adventures with Ash. It’s also worth noting that Mewtwo Strikes Back: Evolution is a CGI remake of the first movie – but we’ll get into the weeds of that more with our chronological order later on. On top of that, the Pokemon Black/White movies are two movies with slight variations. We’d recommend choosing just one and not both.\n\nHow to watch Pokemon in chronological order – including movies\n\nNow we’re getting into the tricky stuff. While Pokemon can be watched in chronological order alongside the movies, it’s not always clear where each feature-length adventure slides into the core narrative. But there are clues and hints to help guide us, and we’ve done our best to present the complete saga below.\n\nThe overall series is also split into eight eras: the original series, Ruby and Sapphire, Diamond and Pearl, Black and White, XY, Sun and Moon, Journeys, and Horizons. As of writing, however, not all episodes have been released in the West. We're still waiting for the conclusion to the first season of Horizons.\n\nTo help make the list seem less daunting, we’ve split everything up into those separate parts. We’ve also tagged each list entry with the episode number of that season, as per Pokemon’s website. E.g. Pokemon: The Johto Journeys may start at episode 105 overall, but we’ll stick to the official numbering convention of Johto Journeys episode 1, and so on – as that’s how it’s listed on various streaming platforms.\n\nAlongside our general list, there’s also three movies that consist of an alternate timeline/retelling of Ash’s adventures. These should be watched separately from the main series.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there’s also a CGI remake of the first Pokemon movie. Purists may prefer the original, but the choice is yours. We’ll also include certain story-heavy specials such as Mewtwo Returns in this list.\n\nThe Original Series:\n\nPokemon: The Indigo League (episodes 1-52)\n\nPokemon: Adventures in the Orange Islands (episodes 1-11)\n\nPokemon: The First Movie OR Mewtwo Strikes Back: Evolution (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: Adventures in the Orange Islands (episodes 12-49)\n\nPokemon: The Movie 2000 (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: Adventures in the Orange Islands (episodes 50-60)\n\nPokemon: The Johto Journeys (episodes 1-39)\n\nPokemon 3: The Movie (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: The Johto Journeys (episodes 40-41)\n\nPokemon: Johto League Champions (episodes 1-21)\n\nPokemon Mewtwo Returns (SPECIAL)\n\nPokemon: Johto League Champions (episodes 22-48)\n\nPokemon 4Ever (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: Johto League Champions (episodes 49-52)\n\nPokemon: Master Quest (episodes 1-46)\n\nPokemon: Heroes (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: Master Quest (episodes 47-64)\n\nRuby and Sapphire:\n\nPokemon: Advanced (1-34)\n\nPokemon: Jirachi, Wish Maker (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: Advanced (35-40)\n\nPokemon: Advanced Challenge (episodes 1-45)\n\nPokemon: Destiny Deoxys (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: Advanced Challenge (episodes 46-52)\n\nPokemon: Advanced Battle (episodes 1-41)\n\nPokemon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: Advanced Battle (episodes 42-52)\n\nPokemon: Battle Frontier (episodes 1-38)\n\nPokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: Battle Frontier (episodes 39-47)\n\nDiamond and Pearl:\n\nPokemon: Diamond and Pearl (episodes 1-39)\n\nPokemon: The Rise of Darkrai (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: Diamond and Pearl (episodes 40-51)\n\nPokemon: Diamond and Pearl: Battle Dimension (episodes 1-34)\n\nPokemon: Giratina and the Sky Warrior (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: Diamond and Pearl: Battle Dimension (episodes 35-52)\n\nPokemon: Diamond and Pearl: Galactic Battles (episodes 1-30)\n\nPokemon: Arceus and the Jewel of Life (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: Diamond and Pearl: Galactic Battles (episodes 31-52)\n\nPokemon: Diamond and Pearl: Sinnoh League Victors (episodes 1-27)\n\nPokemon: Zoroark – Master of Illusions (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: Diamond and Pearl: Sinnoh League Victors (episodes 28-42)\n\nBlack and White:\n\nPokemon: Black and White (episodes 1-37)\n\nPokemon: Black – Victini and Reshiram/Pokemon: White – Victini and Zekrom (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: Black and White (episodes 38-48)\n\nPokemon: Black and White: Rival Destinies (episodes 1-33)\n\nPokemon: Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: Black and White: Rival Destinies (episodes 34-49)\n\nPokemon: Black and White: Adventures in Unova and Beyond (episodes 1-25)\n\nPokemon: Genesect and the Legend Awakened (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: Black and White: Adventures in Unova and Beyond (episodes 26-45)\n\nXY:\n\nPokemon: XY (episodes 1-37)\n\nPokemon: Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: XY (episodes 38-48)\n\nPokemon: XY Kalos Quest (episodes 1-32)\n\nPokemon: Hoopa and the Clash of Ages (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: XY Kalos Quest (episodes 33-45)\n\nPokemon: XYZ (episodes 1-34)\n\nPokemon: Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel (MOVIE)\n\nPokemon: XYZ (episodes 35-47)\n\nThe Legend of X, Y, and Z (Pokemon: XYZ episode 48 – SPECIAL)\n\nSun and Moon:\n\nPokemon: Sun & Moon (episodes 1-43)\n\nPokemon: Sun & Moon Ultra Adventures (episodes 1-48)\n\nPokemon: Sun & Moon Ultra Legends (episodes 1-54)\n\nJourneys\n\nPokemon: Journeys (episodes 1-48)\n\nPokemon: Master Journeys (episodes 1-42)\n\nPokemon: Ultimate Journeys (episodes 1-48 available; 49-54 TBC)\n\nHorizons:\n\nPokemon: Horizons (ongoing)\n\nAlternate timeline [non-canon]\n\nPokemon: I Choose You!

However, we’ll deal with the ones that do fit into canon first.\n\nMewtwo Returns is the first chronological special, taking place midway through the Johto League arc. The Pokemon Chronicles trilogy titled The Legend of Thunder all fall during the Master Quest series. The Mastermind of Mirage Pokemon – released for Pokemon’s 10th anniversary – can be watched alongside the Ruby and Sapphire series. Finally, The Pokemon Mega Evolution Specials can be watched during Pokemon XY, with ‘The Legend of X, Y, and Z’ fitting neatly into the end of the Pokemon XY series arc.\n\nThe order of those specials are:\n\nMewtwo Returns (Johto League)\n\nPokemon Chronicles: The Legend of Thunder (Master Quest) [3 episodes]\n\nThe Mastermind of Mirage Pokemon (Ruby and Sapphire)\n\nThe Pokemon Mega Evolution Specials (Pokemon XY) [4 episodes]\n\nThe Legend of X, Y, and Z (After Pokemon XY)\n\nOn top of those, here are the other Pokemon specials and series to seek out.\n\nPokemon Generations is an anthology series based on Game Freak’s video games; Pokemon Twilight Wings is a series of YouTube shorts inspired by Sword and Shield; Poketoon are YouTube shorts first made available in the West in 2022; Pokemon Evolutions is a series of standalone episodes inspired by the eight Pokemon regions and Pokemon Hisuian Snow takes on the Hisui region from Pokemon Legends: Arceus.\n\nThere’s also the four-part Pokemon Origins series, which adapts Pokemon Red and Blue’s Gen 1 story where Red battles Team Rocket and the Elite Four.\n\nMost recently, Pokemon went stop-motion with the cutesy Pokemon Concierge. It proved a success, and more episodes are on the way.\n\nThe full list of spin-offs and shows to watch are below.\n\nPokemon Generations\n\nPokemon: Twilight Wings\n\nPoketoon\n\nPokemon Evolutions\n\nPokemon: Hisuain Snow\n\nPokemon Origins\n\nPokemon Concierge [Netflix]\n\nFinally, there are multiple Pikachu shorts – some attached to movies, some not available to watch in the West. It can be tricky, if not impossible, to seek all of them out, so it’s not really worth listing them all here. The most famous is Pikachu’s Vacation, which was shown before The First Movie.\n\nThere are also three shorts that serve as prologues to movies, but aren’t essential viewing. They are:\n\nMewtwo – Prologue to Awakening (Pokemon: Genesect and the Legend Awakened)\n\nDiancie – Princess of the Diamond Domain (Pokemon: Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction)\n\nHoopa – The Mischief Pokemon (Pokemon: Hoopa and the Clash of Ages)\n\nWhere to watch Pokemon online\n\nRight now, there's no way to watch all of Pokemon on one streaming service. Pokemon TV, the official platform, officially shut down on March 28, 2024.\n\nIn the US, Netflix has season 1 and seasons 23-25 (The Beginning and Journeys respectively) and season 26 - Pokemon Horizons - currently airing.\n\nPrime Video has seasons 3-9 (Gold and Silver and Ruby and Sapphire) and seasons 17-19 (XY). Hulu also has seasons X-Y, Roku has seasons 20-22 (Sun and Moon), and Tubi has seasons 14-16 (Black and White). Diamond and Pearl is also available via Prime Video channels.\n\nIn the UK, it's a similarly confused picture. POP has seasons 14-19 and seasons 24-25; BBC iPlayer has seasons 10-16 and seasons 20-22 and the new series Pokemon: Horizons (season 26); Netflix has season 1 and seasons 23-24, and Sky Kids has seasons 3-9 and seasons 14-19.\n\nAmazon is the best destination for the majority of Poke-series. Prime has seasons 14-16 and 20-22, plus seasons 2-9 and 17-19 available via Amazon Channels.\n\nWorse still, these platforms change all the time and may be out of date depending on the month. As such, we'd recommend renting or buying the complete series on digital platforms such as Google if you want the full picture from start to finish."
