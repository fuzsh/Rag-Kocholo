Will this just ignore that or are we gonna go to to like the east coast or something.\n\nProbably just retcon it.\n\n\"Nate, we're going to America!\"\n\n\"I thought we were already in America Whisper\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?

Fuck it alright\"\n\nNot sure how well these games sell in the west but lately I have seen pretty much all the Yokai merch in dollar stores.. which is not a good thing imo.\n\nGames do decently. The merch failure is mostly due to Hasbro fucking up. There's rumors that Level-5 is switching from Hasbro to Mattel (though that maybe related to something else like Snack World).\n\nPlus the franchise is doing waaaaay better in Europe, just like all of Level-5's franchises.\n\nConsidering the first two games localized is INTO America. Will this just ignore that or are we gonna go to to like the east coast or something.\n\nI'm wondering the same thing as well. It will be interesting to see how they handle that. Hope we get news about it soon. Loved the first two games and looking forward to the third one.\n\nYokai Watch 2 surprised the hell out of me. Played the first one but it had a lot of things that stopped the player from playing. The second one was cleaned up and kept it flowing nicely. Gorgeous little open world-ish 3D game. Loved it. More realness and heart than Pokemon games. Battling was the only downside. Fairly boring battling.\n\nThe third game seems to remedy this. It uses a grid-based system where you can move your Yo-kai around and avoid attacks. Allowing for more interaction and strategy.\n\nSupposedly Japan didn't like this too much but I don't know how true that is.\n\nProbably just retcon it.\n\n\"Nate, we're going to America!\"\n\n\"I thought we were already in America Whisper\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?

I watched the first season, but from what I know they haven't localised much more than that? It's a shame because I kinda enjoyed it.\n\nLoved Yo-Kai Watch 1, still haven't picked up 2, but I'll eventually grab Psychic Spectres. How was 3 recived in Japan? I know 2 basically kicked off a huge Yo-Kai craze over there, but it feels like it fell away pretty quickly\n\nHasn't the anime flopped like crazy too?

It's on hiatus right now after the 50 episode second season wrapped up back in June (episodes 27-76). Reruns still air on Disney XD.\n\nWhisper's voice actor said he recently did something Yo-kai Watch related. Whether it's Busters or the second movie or Season 3 is unknown.\n\nActually the anime is doing fairly well.

My info must have been seriously out of date. Sounds like I need to get back into the show then.\n\nI really enjoy this franchise. I had first played one of the games in Japanese as an additional way to study the language. Haven't gotten 3 yet, since I wanted to wait for the localization.\n\nThe merch failure is mostly due to Hasbro fucking up.

Is it about the general [low] quality of the products?\n\nI really enjoy this franchise. I had first played one of the games in Japanese as an additional way to study the language.

Stores overstocked on the first wave of merch, and enough wasn't moving. The most screwed over were the medal collectors. Lots of Wave 1, but good luck finding Waves 2, 3 and 4. I'm sure someone out there has compiled a more detailed breakdown on what happened, but it seems to be overstock one part and nothing being released on another. I think the most solid confirmation that deals have broken down is Psychic Specters not getting a medal where Bony Spirits and Fleshy Souls did get one.\n\nI'm not exactly sure how the series can continue without medals since they're pretty important. Hell, YW3 has Dream Medals that when used correctly in the Dream Watch can almost be like an amiibo (the third game adds a roulette for Merica instead of a gacha, and if you do it right you can make the entire roulette gold, guaranteeing a really good Yo-kai)."
