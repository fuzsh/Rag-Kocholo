He wears a beige kimono, a green straw skirt, and goes barefoot. He is usually seen drooling from the right side of his mouth.\n\nPersonality\n\nIn the anime, Grubsnitch is a very gluttonous Yo-Kai, choosing to possess humans in order to pass on this trait and satisfy his hunger. When threatened, he does not budge and tries to fight back; however, he admits defeat when overpowered. His favorite phrase, which is also present when possessing his targets, is \"Otsumami!\".\n\nRelationships\n\nAnime\n\nTsumamiguinosuke makes his debut in episode 23, causing Keita's Mother to snatch a small snack of the breakfast; however, he reveals himself when Keita's mother prepares a big dinner for her family. Said Yo-Kai posesses her and causes her to snatch small snacks from the meal. Keita tries to stop her mother to do so, but to no avail. Keita finally has the idea of summoning Himojii to force his mother to eat the whole dinner in one step; soon, Himojii and Tsumamiguinosuke start a possession battle with Keita's mother as the host, causing her wavering between snatching small snacks and devouring the meal in one step. Himojii finally overpowers Tsumaiguinosuke, causing the latter to admit defeat and grant his Yo-kai Medal to Keita.\n\nTrivia\n\nOrigin\n\nGrubsnitch might be based on the old urban legend of Perori Taro, about a boy with such an irrefrenable appetite for food his parents chased him out before he would drive them to starvation. From then on he wandered the country, getting hungrier and hungrier and begging people for food, causing them to run away when they saw him.\n\nName Origin\n\n\"Tsumamiguinosuke\" is a combination of tsumamigui (つまみ食い, eating food before a meal begins) and suke (助), a common part of a male given name.\n\n\"Grubsnitch\" is a portmanteau of the words grub, slang for generic food or to take food, and snitch, to steal of pilfer something of minimal value.\n\nJapanese: つまみぐいのすけ Tsumamiguinosuke\n\nKorean: 자꾸손 Jakkuson"
