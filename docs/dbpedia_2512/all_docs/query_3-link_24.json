(Softsub, hardsub)\n\nWatch this episode on vimeo or dailymotion!\n\nSEE LOOK I PROMISED. Unfortunately this “once in a blue moon” schedule really is the absolute best I can do right now. I am dead tired almost constantly and am pretty lucky to ever find the time or energy to do these things now. So at least for the duration for the semester (and definitely for the spring as well) the only real goal I can shoot for is don’t quit. Sorry.\n\nAnyway, this episode marks the last of this Komabros segment FINALLY, though there will be a little bonus episode later on. On things of note that weren’t explained well enough in the episode: Tomanoura is a port town in Fukuyama Ciy that is most notable overseas for being the inspiration for the setting in Studio Ghibli’s Ponyo. The brothers are briefly seen standing in front of the Joyato Lighthouse, the city’s most symbolic landmark and a remainder from the Edo Period. Mt. Fudekage is located in Mihara and is most famous for its observatory, which offers a view of the islands of the Seto Inland Sea. Momiji manju are like other kinds of manju in that they are rice cakes filled with red bean paste, but these are different in that they are shaped like maple leaves and local only to Miyajima. Finally, the shrine gate (torii) that the Komabros see in Miyajima does indeed belong to a real shrine known as the Itsukushima Shrine, which is considered the most famous shrine in all Japan. Tourists who visit the shrine have a tendency to stick coins in between its wethered cracks for good luck, which is actually damaging to the structure and pretty disrespectful. So keep in mind not to do that if you ever visit it. The end of this part of the episode featured a compliation of all the accents encountered throughout the series, of which two I uh…didn’t actually translate in their respective episodes. Whoops. If I had remembered this episode would refer to them even though the episodes they appeared in did not explicitly point them out, this wouldn’t be a problem. So anyway, I just attributed two dialects to them that I would have used if I hadn’t skipped them. Challenge yourself to see if you can figure out which English-speaking dialects I was going for with the two you don’t recognize (hint - they’re much less obscure than some of the other places I turned to, and neither are American).\n\nAssuming 163 is the next episode I release, I believe we will be seeing the ongoing Inaho segment come to a close as well as Dark Watch. Things start off fresh beginning with 165 (remember 164 has already been subbed). Otherwise, 161 will be next…I’m not sure yet."
