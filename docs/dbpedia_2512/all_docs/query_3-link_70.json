        "text": "It’s no secret that The Real Housewives of Dubai stars Lesa Milan and Chanel Ayan are no longer on speaking terms. As their friendship slowly begins to unravel in the show’s sophomore season, their co-star Caroline Brooks thinks it was “karma” for being “mean” to her in Season 1.\n\nIn the July 23 episode of The Real Housewives of Dubai, it was revealed that Ayan shared a voice message that Milan sent her in confidence with some of the other ladies. In the message, which was initially sent to Milan, Sara Al Madani appeared to say she’s not Brooks’ “biggest fan,” despite being the one guiding the salon owner through her healing journey.\n\nA confused Milan privately sent the message to Ayan, who then showed it to Caroline Stanbury. When everything came out at the dinner table, Milan declared that she could no longer trust Ayan.\n\nIn tonight’s episode, we find out that Al Madani was actually talking about Taleen Marie in the message. Meanwhile, Ayan goes off on Milan for saying she couldn’t trust her in front of the other women — resulting in tears from both parties.\n\nBrooks, for her part, seemingly celebrates the demise of their friendship.\n\n“I’m not going to lie, I did celebrate it because they were really mean to me in Season 1,” Brooks recently told DECIDER. “They were mean to me, they were mean to Stanbury. They were like the little — I said in my confessionals — dumb and dumber, dynamic duo, whatever you want to call them.”\n\nBrooks added, “It hurt my feelings. So when I saw them two fall out? Good! This is karma. Now you know how it feels. Don’t be mean to everybody.”\n\nThe Glass House owner further explained that she was on Stanbury’s side in the first season because Ayan and Milan were “shady together” and became “harsh” with the other women.\n\nBoth Ayan and Milan ultimately make up in tonight’s episode, meaning something must happen down the line that ends their friendship for good.\n\nDespite her initial feelings, Brooks admitted that she now wants her co-stars to bury the hatchet and be friends again.\n\n“After I saw how hurt Ayan was and Lesa was individually after it all happened, I then said, ‘I want them to be friends again.’ Because I could see the pain. I don’t want anybody to be in pain,” she said, before adding, “I could see that they were both hurt and missing each other. So I tried my best to put them back together.”\n\nHowever, Brooks said that she “cannot mend that fence,” telling us, “That’s up to them to be able to forgive each other. There’s not much I can do.”"
