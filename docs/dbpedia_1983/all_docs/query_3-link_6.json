What does it mean to be a JLN rep, beyond having vague Lambie-esque values? And who is she lending her name to?\n\nGambling is, as smoking was, a slow-acting poison that uses sport to mask its taste\n\nThe lush, matey world of Gillon McLachlan and co is busily debauching something we love, our games and recreations, by mixing them with the gambling industrial complex."
