        "text": "Post by maddogfagin on\n\nmoltenmetalreviews.wordpress.com\n\n24 June 2012\n\nAt 64 years of age and with a career that’s lasted more than 40 years, Ian Anderson isn’t ready to put down the flute and retire in silence. If anything, the legendary musician is more ambitious than ever. Calum Robson has a chat with Anderson to see what he could possibly have in store for us.\n\nMost people at the age of 64 have the thought of a cosy retirement in mind. Not Ian Anderson. The iconic flute-playing Scotsman is in his 44th year of his career and he isn’t planning a retreat into obscurity just yet. His work as the mastermind and soul of Jethro Tull could end tomorrow and it would be revered among the best of progressive rock discographies. But Anderson has big plans to go further. What better way to do so than risk the legacy of a classic Tull album by releasing a sequel and announcing a 19-date UK tour? Never one to take the easy route, Anderson plans to take ‘Thick As A Brick’ and upcoming new record ‘Thick As A Brick 2 – Whatever Happened To Gerald Bostock?’ on the road. 40 years on from the concept album, Anderson has no inhibitions taking on part two.\n\n“I’m not about to apologise for having an intellectual position – that I’m presenting a concept album in the year 2012 and frankly I don’t give a toss whether people like it or not,” he says. “I’m doing it for me not them – just to see if I can do it at age 64. It’s interesting for me to take on a big project while I can because it may not be the case three or four years down the line that I could cope with something like this.”\n\nAnderson is as determined as ever to push his own boundaries in the most challenging of ways. The outrageous task of creating a sequel to ‘Thick As A Brick’ is ambitious enough when you consider the esteemed nature of the ground-breaking record. The original ‘Thick As A Brick’ was conceived in reaction to the heightening pretension of progressive rock. Seeing that the genre was souring, Anderson cleverly took action. After many critics labelled Aqualung a ‘concept’ album, he took one step further, announcing that ‘Thick As A Brick’ would be a concept album with lyrics based on a poem by an eight-year-old schoolboy. Tull’s light-hearted poke at the intentional alienation and obscurity of prog would highlight the band’s humorous side.\n\n“It was a deliberate attempt to create a sort of album that was a little friendly dig at our peers like Yes, Emerson Lake and Palmer and early Genesis who were often making music in a very complex way and perhaps sometimes being – to put it politely – a little esoteric in terms of lyrics! I think Jethro Tull had two things that those other bands didn’t have – one was the sense of a more comedic theatricality and the other was the ability to laugh at ourselves in that context.”\n\nThe good-natured humour might have kept Tull’s feet firmly on the ground amidst the splurge of pretension that riddled ‘prog’. But that isn’t to say that the very concept of their fictional child poet doesn’t carry a deeper meaning. In ‘Thick As A Brick 2’ Gerald Bostock’s life is now considered. In a sea of opportunity, where would the child poet be now? It all sounds very reflective. But it’s without a rose-tinted vision of a bygone era. Anderson is in no way living in the past.\n\n“It’s an album for today,” Anderson explains. “It’s not going back to some nostalgic view of 1972. It’s a sequel but it doesn’t really involve what happened next. It’s not like Rocky 5 or Bat Out Of Hell 7 – it’s a big leap to 40-years in the future. I suppose Gerald Bostock, the mythical character, serves as a metaphor for the lives of all of us who are looking back on our lives from age 50, 60 or whatever it might be. It’s thinking about all of the possibilities of things that might have befallen us or decisions we made consciously in a life-changing sense – perhaps considering those fortunate or unfortunate chance occurrences that took our lives in different directions. Gerald Bostock is a vehicle to get us from then to now and consider the way life has changed in those 40 years.”\n\nIt’s a point of thought that we can all relate to, and Anderson is certainly not exempt from it. In his early years, the Dunfermline-born flutist tried a number of career paths himself – applying for the police force when he left school and later trying out as a local reporter before founding Tull in 1968. Since his childhood his interests have been as varied as his influences. It’s through his love of cats that the conversation moves to a reflection of his own childhood.\n\n“When I was a very small boy – eight or nine years old – I realised I had a preference for cats rather than dogs but I always had a preference for arts and painting,” he says. “I wasn’t particularly interested in football. I suppose I was a natural football player and sports person, but I wasn’t physically gifted in the sense that I was a big tough guy. I didn’t like being there with a bunch of other guys, who were usually a bit boisterous and tended to cheat! I liked music, drawing, pussycats and painting – I liked girly things! If somebody had put a pair of knitting needles in my hand I probably would’ve taken up knitting or embroidery!”\n\nThese diverse passions have developed since his effeminate days as a child. Online he’s written a lengthy guide for a curry eater, a page about endangered wildcats and dedicated a special section to Deep Vein Thrombosis, following his battle with it in 1996 that nearly cost him his life. Anderson’s interests stretch indiscriminately across a vast spectrum –much like his musical background. Moving from blues and jazz to classical and world music, the singer seeks out new things to taste a variety of sounds.\n\n“I always try to expose myself to music from a very wide background,” he says. “I wanted to dip a toe into that very broad picture of musical styles rather than getting locked into a certain kind of music. It was the case with some past members of Jethro Tull who clearly had a great preference for a specific kind of music and weren’t really able or willing to cross over into the slightly more eclectic music that forms the broad catalogue of Jethro Tull.”\n\nOver the years, 28 people have walked through the doors of the progressive act. Whether it’s as long as seasoned guitarist Martin Barre – who has played with the group since their first performance in February 1968 at Marquee Club, London – or as brief but sweet as the iconic yet eccentric bassist Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond, Tull’s history is rich with characters. But when the opportunity for change comes round, it leaves Anderson with tough decisions to make. The most recent of these decisions is putting the new album under his name and not including Barre. It’s all part of being leader and if anything, his attentive ear for perfection is arguably a trait that accounts for a lot of the band’s success.\n\n“It’s like picking a football team,” he says. “You have to leave some folk out sometimes and the fans may understand that or they may not, but frankly that’s the job of the football manager. I’m the Alex Ferguson of the flute – I have to make some difficult choices sometimes!”\n\nOne man who can relate to this is Iron Maiden’s Bruce Dickinson, who himself has been at the centre piece of the band for the best part of 30 years. He’s a character that Anderson has had pleasure working with.\n\n“Bruce Dickinson is one of the really nice guys that is just so easy to work with,” Anderson says. “He’s such an easy-going guy. He was one of my guests at Canterbury Cathedral before Christmas and we did a couple of Bruce Dickinson and Iron Maiden things but in a slightly different way, as befitting performance in the most famous cathedral in the Anglican Communion!”\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nSorry if this is a repeat, it's in my recent bookmarks. Did I see it here? or maybe I captured it from somewhere else? (In the early morning brain)...lol I don't know...\n\nIAN ANDERSON on War, Religion and (why not?) Cat Stevens\n\nwww.cliffordmeth.com/ianandersononwarreligionan.htm\n\nDecember 7, 2004\n\nAs Jethro Tull took a breather from the current leg of their European tour, Cliff spoke with Ian Anderson for quite some time regarding music, politics and the art of war. It was their first conversation in many years (Cliff once tracked the band regularly for such publications as Hit Parader, The East Coast Rocker, and Rock & Roll Disc). Feature stories by Cliff are forthcoming in THE AQUARIAN and www.Shotgunreviews.com, but here's the exclusive, uncut Q&A:\n\n---------------------------\n\nWhen Jethro Tull, the pioneers of Intellectual Metal, cut their teach on the seminal Aqualung, they were the last blokes we expected to trip the yule fantastic. Now, 33 years later, the band who sang, “If Jesus saves, then he better save himself” has gone-a-caroling. But far be it from me to stuff coal in their stockings, so allow me to remove tongue from cheek. Allow that The Jethro Tull Christmas Album is a seriously good spin--far better than that over-hyped (ad-nauseam) How to Dismantle An Atomic Bomb from the erstwhile born-again Irish lads. Really, gang: Tull remains unique, and always a superior listen. Martin Barre is still the Clark Kent of lead guitarists and the rest of the assemblage is superb. And Ian Anderson is, well, Ian Anderson.\n\nMeth: The last time we spoke was backstage at The Meadowlands in New Jersey as we watched the Berlin Wall coming down on a monitor.\n\nAnderson: I remember it well. Our German Tour manager broke down and cried when he heard the news and saw it on Television. Over here [in Germany] Mikhail Gorbachev appeared on a TV show that I also did a few months back and he got a standing ovation for five minutes on prime-time Saturday night TV. They don't let the audience applaud that long unless it's someone somewhere a little upscale from the Pope in people's love and admiration. He set in motion all these things and it was a momentous day. And now here I am in Germany on tour with a somewhat beleaguered economy as a result of paying for the old Eastern German integration into the German economy, but even now people still have a very big... Anyone over the age of 15 will remember those breaking news captions.\n\nMeth: While we're on geo-politics, most pop musicians have come out strongly against the U.S. and U.K.'s War in Iraq. What's your position on the subject?\n\nAnderson: I don't know. It's difficult to have an opinion that is clear cut about an issue as complex as this. I was having a discussion with a German friend in Germany two nights before the U.K. and U.S. attacked Iraq, and I was saying that if they go through with this, this will be years and years to come of a commitment from the U.K., U.S., and whoever else is foolish to go along with it. This is taking the lid off of a very dangerous country. And whether you like it or not, the evil Sadam Husein is the guy who kept that lid on and kept Iraq essentially free from being what it is now, which is a state that is fostering the most violent terrorism currently on the planet--at least most frequently violent in the sense that the number of deaths of American soldiers is over 1,000; the number of on-going casualties this week was 50 people. And that's just another day in Bhagdad. This is not something that will get a quick fix on January 30 any more than when Afghanistan voted in, this morning, the man in the green cloak, who seems a perfectly reasonable chap, but there is no way he is in control of Afghanistan, let alone the enormous increase in opium and therefore heroin production that has occurred since Afghanistan was so-called \"liberated.\"\n\nIt's all good and well playing with the ideas of democracy, but life ain't that simple. Whereas I don't think I can be one of those people who is saying I think the U.S. should pull out of Iraq--or the U.K. or any of the so-called coalition, which amounts to a few hundred other people (laughs). Far and away the U.S. is bearing the brunt of this and will do for years to come. I'm talking about the poor, old people who will have to fund the tens of billions that this will continue to cost the U.S.\n\nMeth: Although Tull arose during the U.S. involvement in Viet Nam, and you've always been outspoken on all subjects, your music has never addressed anything political.\n\nAnderson: My music is not going to address issues in a direct political way. You wouldn't find me on stage in the last run at the election joining Bruce Springsteen and calling for the mobilization of civilian troops, as it were, to place their vote in the box next to the name Kerry. I wouldn't be up in the stage doing that. But you would get me on the stage campaigning very simply with the word VOTE. That I'm very much dedicated towards. I wouldn't be partisan. I would certainly encourage people to vote and in my small way I did try to do that when I was last doing concerts before I went on tour because I do think it's very important from a moral point of view, as well as a political one, to take advantage of that democracy that I'm afraid so many Americans and British take for granted.\n\nPolitically, I’m an angry man. But the answer isn’t “pull the troops out.” We’re stuck with this now. We can’t abandon these people. We’ve brought notions of democracy to a country where they’ve been used to, at best, a patriarchal and tribal leadership. In Iraq, they were used to the tyrant dictator, but nonetheless, it was a stable country, for the most part throughout most its very complicated length and breadth, with all of its tribal and religious divisions. And when you go blundering in there as a Western Democracy with tanks and guns, you’re taking the lid off the hornet’s nest. And that’s unfortunately what seems to have escaped both Bush and Blair and their rather dodgy crew of advisors.\n\nIt just seemed so patently obvious from the word go that this was just going to result in a lot of tears that it’s beyond me that they could have done it. I mean, it just seems so incredibly naïve, if you give them the benefit of the doubt, to have gone in their guns blazing thinking all you do is take out the government, replace it with a friendly military force for a few months, then get them all to go to elections. How could they ever believe that given the complexities that existed in Iraq? And this was pointed out in countless articles by countless learned journalists from all over the world reporting from Iraq for the last ten years. It was pointed out time and again that the result of removing Sadam Husein would not be a simple one. That is what is so extraordinary! However, we don’t want to waste the entire interview talking about that, but yes, I’ve got my opinion, and the answer is that it’s far too late to pull out—far too late for people like me to be putting in music or in song any clear cut political message.\n\nThe job I do as a musician is to travel— not to Iraq, thus far, but to certain other places where we have seen the suicide bombers and the tragedy of war in the last 30 or 40 years. I go to places like Israel; I go to Turkey, to India, to places where people do blow each other up. But as a musician, I’m allowed to cross those boundaries in the worlds of art and entertainment; I cross boundaries that politicians can’t--even if they want to. So I think I’m rather happy to keep my message a generally uplifting one of music and song. If there’s a political or religious comment being made, I do so with a degree of, I hope, subtlety and artistry, which I hope does not make me appear partisan and does not allow for misunderstanding, although I’ve been at the end of misunderstanding before, choosing words in my lyrics perhaps not so carefully as I might have done back in 1971.\n\nMeth: You told me years ago that you felt Linda McCartney’s stance on animal rights was naive and uninformed. How did you regard Paul McCartney’s leadership role in The Concert for New York?\n\nAnderson: I’ve never been a McCartney fan, but it just seems like he’s trying to lay the ghost of Linda and I just don’t understand why he’s going near any of that stuff. His new wife is into the landmine stuff and that seems to me so… I mean, I got an invitation to go to that and I tore it up. I was really quite reviled by being asked to go and do something that is actually all about just giving money to the McCartneys to make them look good. One might almost think that if they manage to change the laws and Arnold [Schwarzenegger] gets to be president that maybe Paul McCartney is going to shoot for Governor of California. I don’t know. Must be some ulterior motive.\n\nMeth: Cat Stevens is a contemporary of yours.\n\nAnderson: Ah yes! Well, you see Cat Stevens would be a much better Governor of California. We actually met, funny enough, just before the opening of the Olympic Games--I bumped into Cat Stevens in Athens. He and I were both doing a TV show for German television. I hadn’t seen him for years and I went over and we chatted for ten minutes on a variety of subjects. He seemed very pleasant, very nice, and I got the inkling that music was becoming a meaningful part of his life again. A musical performance was definitely in the cards. So I was quite pleased with that and he had to go to make-up because he was being interviewed on this TV show—not performing music, just interviewed--so I went my way. Well, after I’d done my performance, his son came rushing over and said, “Oh, did my dad find you?” And I said, “Nope. I didn’t know he was looking for me.” He said, “He’s searching everywhere for you--he’s so embarrassed that he wants to apologize because he didn’t recognize you.” And I said, “Wow! That’s amazing! You tell your dad that raises him even higher in my esteem, that he would be so nice and pleasant and give ten minutes of interesting and pleasing conversation to someone who he must have regarded as a complete stranger.” (laughs)\n\nOne feels a little sorry for him having endured perhaps a degree of vilification, and certainly humiliation when he was denied entrance to the U.S. because we were told that the authorities had confused his name with another person who was on the terrorist list. I rather suspect there was more to it than that. My feeling is because of his pronunciations some years ago against Salmon Rushdie, when pressed on the issue, concurring with a fatwah put him in a pretty bad light, although Cat Stevens has always been a peaceful and inspiring person in regards to peace and tolerance and so-on. He is the benign face of Islam that unfortunately has been tainted by some assumption that he is aligned with the extremists. I really don’t believe for one second that he is or ever has been. I think we need more people like Yusef Islam who are going to stand up and show us the kind and caring and responsible and very human face of Islam. We need a lot more Yusef Islams, whether they call themselves that or Cat Stevens.\n\nMeth: A naïve notion of your religious viewpoint might be based solely on the flipside of the Aqualung album. In light of what you just said about Cat Stevens, how did you react to Bob Dylan’s “Born Again” phase, or Van Morrison’s spiritual material, or George Harrison’s Hare Krishna music?\n\nAnderson: I’ve never been anti-Christian. I wouldn’t call myself a Christian because I’m not an active, practicing one, but I believe in most of the tenets of Christianity. It’s very easy to go along with most of that as it’s equally easy to go along with most of Islam. It’s actually easy to go along with quite a lot of Hinduism, once you get over that big hurdle of slightly demystifying the pantheon of deities that litter the life of a Hindu (laughs). Hinduism is a tricky one, but you have to look at it more like you’re watching a Bollywood movie, or a sort of Walt Disney cartoon. It’s larger than life. It appears colorful and somewhat two-dimensional in the way that the many gods of Hinduism seem to operate. It is rather cartoon-like—however, behind it, it is essentially a monotheistic religion, and not a difficult one for us to go along with. Difficult probably for most westerners to think of practicing, but for me it would be difficult to be a practicing Christian because I can’t quite get my head around one or two things about Christianity that are fundamental, particularly regarding the degree to which Christ has become deified as a prophet and a symbol. So I have a problem with Christianity, but in terms of most of its teachings—most of it is practical and sensible moralities and codes for good living. I’m not anti-Christian; I’m actually quite pro-Christian, but I’m equally pro-Islam, as long as we don’t get into the car bombs. For the vast majority of practicing Muslims, the step from Islam to terrorism is a giant chasm they could not conceive of crossing. It’s just for some people, as always—Christianity and Islam alike—religion has been a means of whipping up hatred, bigotry, intolerance.\n\nJust look at the simple polarities in Belfast, in Northern Ireland, and that deep, undying hatred between Catholics and Protestants. It’s so hard for us to understand why those people still want to kill each other, and indeed on a Saturday night still do. Whether it’s a bottle fight down the road in Belfast or something more insidious, the hatred has not gone away. At the moment, the guns and the bombs are silent, but the deep divisions are still there with very little sign of being mended by the current and future generations.\n\nMeth: Almost like an English football game.\n\nAnderson: Unfortunately it mirrors some of the violence that we do see elsewhere in society, whether it’s at a football match or on the streets of London, if you’re careless enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nMeth: When I first saw Liverpool versus Manchester United, and it was unlike anything I’d ever experienced. All of the sport was in the audience, I thought.\n\nAnderson: Things get whipped up and unfortunately people rather enjoy having a simple cause to, if not die for, at least get their heads broken for. It is remarkable how, generally speaking, from an audience point of view anyway, sports in the USA seems mercifully free of that kind of violence from spectators. It’s something that's not only British, of course—it happens elsewhere in Europe. But I guess given the choice, I’d rather seen the violence contained within the walls of a soccer stadium than spreading onto the streets of a foreign country. Maybe, in some weird way, we are containing that outlet for violence by allowing it to happen and focus on something as silly as a football match.\n\nMeth: Have you seen Bob Dylan’s Chronicles?\n\nAnderson: I’ve been given a copy of it, actually, but I’ve yet to read it.\n\nMeth: It's outstanding. A superior book. Have you kept chronicles and diaries like this that you would ever consider publishing?\n\nAnderson: I’ve never kept anything, perhaps on the grounds of some belief that if I can’t remember it, it’s not worth writing down and expecting someone else to find it amusing. But also, doubtless, because of some degree of laziness. I know that a very early member of Jethro Tull, Glen Cornick, did actually keep diaries and memorabilia—things, photographs, bits of paper, stuff. And I rather regret now not having kept stuff. But ultimately I think I’m not really a stuff sort of person. I have a Grammy Award somewhere—I haven’t the faintest idea where it could be. It’s probably in the house somewhere. I live in a big house and I’m not going to spend the afternoon looking for the damn thing. It’s not that it’s not important to me—it is kind of important; I know that 6000 peers in the musical creative world took part in a voting system and preferred Jethro Tull as the winners of a Grammy. I’m not unimpressed by that, I’m really humbled by it, and very grateful to them for their show of approval at Jethro Tull’s activities over the years—not at being the best metal act or whatever the award was actually for; they were just giving us the-best-band-that-hasn’t-won-a-Grammy-before award–that was the spirit of people voting for us. So I’m not unimpressed by that, but I just don’t need the object itself to remind me. I’m not one of those people who needs something hanging on the wall to remind me that I’ve sold a million copies of an album or that I’m a clever chap. Especially because as a performing musician on stage every night, you are confronting real people in real time—it’s not just memories or symbols; you actually get the real deal when you’re a performing artist. So I’ve never really felt the need for stuff and reminders and whatever.\n\nAnd I don’t think I’d be much of a biography writer in the sense that I’m a little too sensitive about hurting other people’s feelings. If I got carried away, I would say some things that are possibly quite funny and deeply cutting and maybe cynical—overall I would have rather amusing and perceptive things to say about people that I’ve known, however many of them would be deeply hurt by it and for that reason I wouldn’t do it, even though it might amuse the hell out of me and maybe some other people. I know it would be hurtful to have that confidence betrayed by a public unveiling of events or character assassinations (laughs). So I don’t think I’m going to do that somehow.\n\nMeth: If Oliver Stone were going to make The Jethro Tull film, the way he did The Doors, who would play Ian Anderson?\n\nAnderson: I haven’t seen The Doors film—it would be a difficult one for me to relate to, but the first reaction would be don’t because whenever people do try to do movies about the rock music industry, everything I’ve ever seen has been... The one sterling exception is “Spinal Tap,” which was pretty spot-on, really, for a bunch of guys who were not part of it. I think you can do it if you’re very clever and you’re actually making fun of it. In a satirical way, you can do it. But if you’re actually trying to dramatize events... I mean, God help us if there was to be a film about The Beatles or John Lennon. It would be dreadful in the same way as the fools who try to make movies about Princess Diana. It’s just awful when people go that route because they never really touch upon the reality in the way that people close to it know it to be.\n\nI haven’t seen Oliver Stone’s movie about The Doors. But if I did, I’d be very surprised if it was something that made me feel that it was an accurate portrayal of something—not that I knew him or anything really about The Doors... Any poor fool who has to play me would probably have to take some serious lessons in standing on one leg. And it would have to go straight to video. And they’d release the soundtrack to the movie as a ring tone.\n\nMeth: You’ve clearly labored to keep your music fresh, but there has to be certain benefits to the nostalgic aspects of the band’s history and longevity.\n\nAnderson: That’s an interesting one because just before I came back from America, I actually went into XM Studios with the guys from Jethro Tull and we re-recorded the entire Aqualung album for a series on their radio where people go in and record their seminal albums as a live performance before a small, invited audience. I suppose in some ways just to prove they can actually remember all the chords. But also, perhaps, with a view to performing music not as a literal remake, but as a reinterpretation according to the times, technology, flirting with different arrangements. Or in the case with Jethro Tull, with three different band members.\n\nIt was kind of interesting to do because not only were we recording some pieces of music from the Aqualung album which we still periodically play live on stage, but there were also three songs from the album we had never, ever played since the day they were recorded, at the end of 1970. That was kind of interesting, and a little weird, to touch upon these songs that, for whatever reason, had never been attempted before. And they were actually three really enjoyable songs to do.\n\nMeth: Which songs?\n\nAnderson: “Hymm 43,” “Slipstream,” and “Up To Me.” And we started playing them—knowing that we’d be doing them for XM—live on the tour.\n\nMeth: I’m surprised that you never did “Hymm 43” – that one was getting airplay for many years.\n\nAnderson: Yeah, I think it was one of those songs that was, back in the days of A&R radio, would be frequently played as an example of Jethro Tull’s work. I would think it’s unlikely you’d be hearing it very often in today’s very, very restricted classic-rock radio programming. It’s never been one of my favorite songs. We did change the arrangement substantially, although we went back to the final verse in the original style. But it was interesting to play it and do it in a different way.\n\nBut going back to the idea of sort of keeping things fresh, it is something that’s not very difficult to do with most of the material because there’s always another interpretation of it. It’s not like being a classical musician and having to play the exactly what Mozart or Beethoven wrote, the only interpretation being, perhaps, in the tempo or dynamics or phrasing that a conductor will draw from the orchestra. It’s 1% of the outcome. 99% of it is what was written by the composer. It’s on paper—it’s definitive—there is no room to change any of the notes or parts or relationships between them.\n\nBut in the world of rock music, jazz, blues and some folk music, there is the room to not only interpret the song but to actually change things—to improvise. And beyond improvisation, to sit and deliberately, consciously reappraise something. There’s no one to stop you. So if you’re the author of that work—or even if you’re not—you can seek permission to vary an artist’s work. And if the artist has been dead long enough (laughs) then you can take pieces of traditional music, as I do, and do what the hell you want with them.\n\nMeth: When will we hear the XM Aqualung?\n\nAnderson: I believe it’s scheduled for a March broadcast. It will be rough and ready, but it’s okay. I think I sang three wrong words in a verse, which I fixed right afterwards, but apart from everything else, it’s as it is. There’s a few bad moments, and a few less than perfect bits of performance, but what you’ll hear is us live in a small studio with a bunch of people. It’s not a high level of technical and musical excellence. It’s kind of funky.\n\n2004 Clifford Meth\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nIan Anderson lays some new bricks\n\nBy DAVID BRINN\n\n08/22/2012\n\nLegendary leader of Jethro Tull performing ‘Thick As a Brick’ and sequel next month.\n\nwww.jpost.com/ArtsAndCulture/Music/Article.aspx?id=282215\n\nIn the current political environment of cultural boycotts targeting Israel, Ian Anderson is somewhat of an anomaly.\n\nThe longtime theatrical front man for British classic rockers Jethro Tull has been arriving on our shores with rhythmic regularity for multiple performances, whether with his veteran group or as part of grandiose solo projects.\n\nHe even donated his personal earnings from last August’s three performances by Tull to three non-profit organizations that work toward Jewish-Arab conciliation – Hand in Hand, Peace Child Israel and Neveh Shalom/Wahat al-Salam, and plans on doing the same with different organizations following his upcoming three shows – Ian Anderson performs Thick As a Brick I and II on September 6 at the Train Station in Jerusalem, September 7 at the Congress Center in Haifa and September 8 at the Ra’anana Amphitheater.\n\n“I don’t let those people bully me and tell me where to play, I make my own decisions,” said the 65-year-old Anderson recently from his home in England during a two-week band break between tours. “The fact that I might choose not to benefit financially from my performances and donate my earnings is my own decision as well.”\n\nNot one to hide his opinions, and possessed of a sharp wit that hasn’t softened over the years, Anderson acknowledged during a half-hour conversation that stepping into the Middle East maelstrom leaves him open to criticism from all sides.\n\nWhat kind of reactions did you get when you donated your proceeds to those organizations?\n\n“You’re walking on coals just by coming to Israel. People in my position will get hate mail from both sides of the fence, and believe me, I do. But you have to be a big boy and stand up for what you believe, quietly do what you have to do and hope you don’t offend too many people. But it’s better than doing nothing at all.\n\n“When I’m confronted by those idiots who refer to me as ‘falling into the clutches of feeding the Israeli government machine’ and call on me to boycott, I find it naïve and infantile. Nobody really gives a $h1t whether I show up for work or not – it’s not going to hurt the Israeli government if I don’t come and do a concert or if Elvis Costello [who cancelled booked shows in Caesarea three years ago] doesn’t come and do a concert.\n\n“The point is that we should go if we think we have a reason to go, and if we don’t feel confident or sure about that reason, we should stay home. In fact, why not just stay in bed, or stay under the bed for that matter, if you’re so fearful of getting involved. Sometimes there’s a way you can come and do something which is honorable and ultimately have more of an upside than a downside.\n\n“But it’s never a clear cut situation, and it’s always going to be complex. I’m in balance a ‘pro’ kind of guy and a positive supporter, but I can see lots of negatives as well, just as I can in my own country. But that doesn’t stop me from living here, and it wouldn’t stop me from living in Israel if I chose to do so... [pause and laugh] somebody else may stop me, though.”\n\nYou’ll be donating your earnings again from these shows in Israel?\n\nI’ll be donating all my profits after paying for the band’s airfare, wages, insurance and things like that. I personally will not be benefiting in any financial way. But I will hopefully benefit in a way which is the reason I get on the stage in the first place – that strange self-indulgent pleasure you get when you offer something to people and they seem pleased to receive it.\n\n“Sometimes that’s enough, but I have to learn my living in other places then, so don’t expect me to play for free in New York City [laughs]. Because I’m not on the ground, it’s a little tricky as far as giving money. If it was London and I’m doing shows to restore cathedrals, which I’ve done, it’s very easy to see what the outcome is – you see the roof covered in scaffolding.\n\n“It’s not so easy when it’s thousands of miles away, so to some extent I need to take advice. I pretty much know who the recipients of the income from this year’s concerts will be, but I will take a little more advice on it. I’m responsible for making sure the money gets to the right place. Anybody can say to the promoter, ‘just don’t pay me and do something good with the money’ but we all know what happens – money gets squandered. Look at Live Aid.”\n\nThick as a Brick is considered to be one of Jethro Tull’s masterpieces. How did it come about?\n\n(Thick as a Brick, Tull’s fifth album, was released in 1972, and includes one 44-minute song that changes mood and style multiple times. The original packaging, designed like a newspaper, claimed the album was a musical adaptation of a poem by eight-year-old Gerald Bostock, though the lyrics were actually written by Anderson.)\n\nThe album before it, Aqualung, was a collection of songs with two or three of them sharing a theme of organized religion.\n\nI always said that it wasn’t a concept album, but the critics kept insisting it was. That’s what bands were doing back then, it was the flavor of the month. Prog rock was not yet called prog rock but it was going in that direction.\n\nWith Thick As a Brick, it was my intention to write and record an album that would be a lighthearted spoof on, or parody, of the prog rock genre. On the face of it, it is indeed lighthearted, surreal and comedic, but parody is often a comic mask worn by tragedy and serious or dark characters. I think parody is a useful tool in luring people into something that perhaps has more serious undertones lurking behind the humorous side of things.\n\nIn the case of Thick As a Brick, it was the passage of childhood through puberty into manhood. The claim that the poem was written by an eight-year-old boy was something that half the people caught onto straight away and the other half took time to realize it really wasn’t written by a little boy.\n\nAlthough it has some elements of humor and comedic delivery in terms of its stage performance particularly, it has plenty of dark and somber moods as well. Perhaps that’s a reflection on the way we all look back on our lives, with a mixture of regret, fear and gratitude that we managed to cross a few roads and didn’t get hit by speeding traffic, and looking back you think how lucky you are to be here now. I’m sure I’m not the only person to think that.\n\nWhy did you decide to tinker with history last year to write and record Thick As a Brick II?\n\nI had always said no to the idea of doing a sequel to Aqualung or Thick As a Brick. I couldn’t see a way to go back in some nostalgic way and start stirring the coals of an almost dead fire into a moderately interesting blaze.\n\nBut at the beginning of last year, I suddenly got this notion, and wrote a little music and some words and suddenly I was off. After two or three weeks, I pretty much had the album written.\n\nLater in the year, the band deliberately went into the same process as we did for the original album – we rehearsed for seven days and recorded for 10 days. It was a pretty energized process.\n\nAre there similarities or common themes with the first album?\n\nOne thing we deliberately did was to choose the same sound palette used in the original album – the Fender jazz bass, the Hammond organ with rotating Leslie speakers, the Gibson Les Paul guitar – the same sonic values, but of course, with different musicians.\n\nYou’ll recognize some deliberately carefully chosen little moments in the lyrics or musical line if you’re paying attention and so inclined – little pop-up flags saying ‘hey, remember me?’ I tried to be deft in touch. I didn’t want to litter the whole album with constant references but I didn’t want there to be none at all.\n\nThe key element is the little recognizable intro on acoustic guitar and on the chorus, which appears on both albums.\n\nYou have to be careful not to overdo it.\n\nBeethoven was pretty good at choosing what he would slip in in the way of familiar-sounding motifs, but he was quite good at not making it too obvious. For those that recognize them though, it’s ‘ah! I remember that! He did that in the Third Symphony... as well as the 7th and the 9th’ [laughs].\n\nBut that’s what being an artist is about. Take Cezanne. How may pictures did he paint of Mont Sainte-Victoire? They’re all different from each other. I think one of the reasons he, as was Monet, [was] so besotted with water lilies is that they realized the same scene could be painted in so many different ways.\n\nIn music, there’s a restlessness on the part of composers who want to work in the limitations of 12 notes in the musical scale and a finite number of rhythms. You only have a certain number of tools in your kit bag, and it’s up to you what to do with them.\n\nWhat is the difference when it’s ‘Ian Anderson’ being billed as opposed to ‘Jethro Tull’?\n\nIt’s important to remind people that I’m the guy who wrote the music in the first place. I was the producer, I paid for it, it was my baby – as is the new one.\n\nIn a way, I’m getting to that point of wanting the recognition. With Frank Zappa, in the beginning it was the Mothers of Invention, then Frank Zappa and the Mothers, and then just Frank. He managed to do that in three or four years.\n\nI’ve taken longer pushing my name to the fore. It’s only been the last 10 years or so that I’ve done more tours using my own name, whether they be with an orchestra, an acoustic tour with a string quartet or some kind of religious Christmas-flavored tour.\n\nI use my own name because I don’t want the audience coming thinking they’re going to a Jethro Tull show and expecting to hear the best of Tull. That’s what’s suggested if on the ticket it says ‘Jethro Tull.’ That’s fine if that’s what I want to do. But with this project, I don’t really want people coming to the show if they’re expecting to hang out with their drinking buddies and hoot and holler for “Aqualung” in the quiet places. It’s a carefully planned device to keep the riffraff at home [laughs].\n\nI don’t mean to be as disparaging as that sounds, but if you’re doing a show like this – which is more of a theatrical musical event than a rock show – you want the audience to enjoy it, including the spaces and the silences, which are very much part of the performance.\n\nIt ruins it terribly for all involved if some drunken idiot thinks that that is the moment to shout out something.\n\nI would except the same kind of civility that’s afforded a string quartet, symphony orchestra or jazz group, where there’s a little more sophistication present. If it sounds like I’m a little above my station and am expecting too much from rock music fans, so be it – I’m absolutely unapologetic.\n\nBut I’ve never run into those things in Israel. Israeli audiences are real pussycats, and that’s one of the reasons I like to keep coming back to play there.\n\nPhoto: j-tull.com\n\nPost by maddogfagin on\n\nFrom www.soundspike.com\n\nQ&A: Ian Anderson\n\nStory by John Voket\n\nSoundSpike Contributor\n\nPublished September 20, 2012\n\nWhatever Happened To Gerald Bostock?\n\nIt's a fair question, but more than likely one that might be asked by either a hard core prog-rock fan, or at least a casual follower of Jethro Tull.\n\nFor those who may need a gentle reminder, the popular rock band led by the wild-eyed flautist, singer and songwriter Ian Anderson released its seminal concept album \"Thick As A Brick\" in 1972. Despite its decidedly complex and lengthy arrangements, \"TAAB\" became one of Jethro Tull's best selling and popular releases, topping the Billboard Album Chart.\n\nThe lyrical story arc of \"Thick As a Brick,\" as Anderson relates on his website, was credited at the time to the fictitious child character Gerald Bostock. As the story goes, Bostock entered a poetry competition and was subsequently disqualified from his win following an appearance on BBC-TV, where he uttered a profanity.\n\nIt was also revealed that his parents had lied about his age. Instead of the eight-year-old his parents claimed him to be, he was actually nine at the time of writing the poem and 10 when he won the competition.\n\nBut Bostock's poetry was repurposed for song lyrics that, in reality, eventually became the original \"Thick As a Brick\" album. So, 40 years on, what would Bostock -- aged 50 in 2012 -- be doing?\n\nAfter some prodding and serious lobbying by prog-rock vocalist-turned-record exec Derek Shulman of Gentle Giant fame, Anderson, who initially balked, began to warm to the concept of imagining Bostock in adulthood. The idea began generating creative traction and within just a few weeks, a present day sequel, appropriately titled \"Thick As a Brick 2,\" emerged.\n\nPerhaps the greatest joy of listening through \"TAAB2\" is discovering the subtle and not-so-subtle references to the original work couched in comparably stellar musicianship -- as well as the overlay of ideas and wit that were already well formed in the mind of nine-year-old Bostock (or Anderson) back in '72.\n\n\"TAAB2,\" Anderson said, examines the possible different paths that the precocious young schoolboy might have taken later in life, while at the same time, creating alter-ego characters whose song-section identities illustrate the hugely varied potential twists and turns of fate and opportunity.\n\n\"Not just for Gerald, but to echo how our own lives develop, change direction and ultimately conclude through chance encounters and interventions, however tiny and insignificant they might seem at the time,\" Anderson states.\n\nWith \"TAAB2\" receiving good reviews and overwhelming fan support, and after a well-received tour abroad, Anderson brings the \"Thick As a Brick 1 & 2 Tour\" to the U.S. The outing kicked off earlier this week in Miami. Plans call for Anderson and his backing band of David Goodier, Scott Hammond, Ryan O'Donnell, John O'Hara and Florian Opahle to perform the entire first and second album back-to-back and in their entirety -- and possibly with a few other select \"greatest hits\" as an encore -- during the tour.\n\nAnderson spoke to SoundSpike ahead of his arrival in the states, discussing the challenges of reproducing the complexities of these two companion \"bookend\" creations of \"Thick As a Brick\" that were conceived nearly 40 years apart.\n\nSoundSpike: Given the hit-oriented manner in which albums are produced today, it's unusual to sit and listen to an entire album front-to-back that is both cohesive and not apparently constructed around a few numbers sanctioned as hopeful hit singles.\n\nIan Anderson: Well at the time I was writing it in February 2011, I suppose I had some trepidation about taking on a big project of that sort. But within two or three days of starting work on it, I thought the ideas are coming thick and fast, so it's not something that is going to dry up on me halfway through. And indeed the problem became trying to shoehorn in an awful lot of stuff into the physical limitations of making a single project that would just about fit on a vinyl record. In fact, for those who would like the physicality of owning such a thing, I did a special vinyl release of \"Thick As a Brick 1 & 2.\" We cut the thing on copper instead of acetate at Abbey Road studios in London. After so many years of being in a studio and actually cutting a record, I thought it sounded pretty good. Mind you we were using the same equipment and materials used when the Beatles were recording there.\n\nThe musical and stylistic similarities between parts one and two are amazing. You really seemed to have nailed down the other bookend here 40 years hence.\n\nIf you're writing something like that, you have to find that middle path really between making it too disassociated in terms of style and content and sound -- and not wanting it to be some sort of nostalgic trip into the past. It's a question of trying to find that good balance. And that balance was, for me, trying to make an album for 2012 in terms of subject and material whilst retaining some of the sonic qualities of the original through the use of the same instruments, and generally the same approach to writing and recording -- which was doing it very much like a live performance. Although this was somewhat more efficient because on the original, I let myself get a little ambitious in the studio adding overdubs, extra voices guitar and flute parts that I actually couldn't play live. Once you start putting on two flutes you're in trouble -- or I'm in trouble, especially if I have to play guitar and flute at the same time, which does occur in many of the passages on the original \"Thick As a Brick\" album.\n\nSo how do you manage to replicate the original album live on the current tour?\n\nI have an extra hand on stage on this tour to help cover all the lines that otherwise would be missing because they are impossible to perform with only five people. It is an experience to try and bring these two things side-by-side on a live stage, and the fact there is a 40-year gap between them which is quickly crossed over by the vehicle that is the young Gerald Bostock growing up and becoming an adult, and through the various possibilities of life outcomes of a little boy. Those take us quickly into a series of contemporary songs that cover some of the passages along the way -- sometimes with a degree of humor, and sometimes with a degree of bleakness and harshness, but trying to keep things varied in terms of emotion. It's not a barrel of laughs, but it has its comedic moments, too.\n\nSo how is this fusion of two complicated projects shaking out in concert?\n\nThe first 15 or 20 shows were a big learning curve for band and crew. But during the latter part of the first tour, I think we began settling in and beginning to enjoy the little moments that come from the improvisational passages. To begin with, it's an enormous amount of stuff to learn and remember. To begin with it was a full-on feat of memory and concentration, but now enough of it is routine in terms of the arrangements that we can settle back a bit and kind of enjoy those flights of fancy moments which make every night a little different than the one before. And it keeps the Alzheimer's at bay by pushing the brain to that degree of concentration -- that's no joke by the way. I'm much happier stretching my mind doing this than I would going off somewhere fishing, or God forbid, taking up golf...(laughing).\n\nIs the live show just TAAB 1 & 2, or do you encore with a few more 'greatest hits'?\n\nWell the whole (TAAB) takes two hours, but there are occasions where we are forced to play a somewhat irrelevant encore of past material. For the most part we look at it as a theatrical musical presentation, and hope we can get away without playing \"Aqualung\" or \"Locomotive Breath,\" which is just like finishing an eight-course meal and somebody brings out another chunk of steak and says \"eat this.\" Asking for people's time and concentration as an audience, you'd think most people would want to run screaming for the exit doors by the time we finish part two. But sadly, that's not the case much of the time. So we get caught up in the inevitable encores once in awhile.\n\nBefore you were prodded into considering this new project, had you spent any substantial amount of time thinking about Gerald Bostock previously -- back when he was 40 or 25?\n\nThe material of \"Thick As a Brick\" was never far from my consciousness because we'd play 10 or 15 minutes of the album quite frequently in concert over the years. But to play the whole thing in its entirety was never something I gave any serious consideration to, until about three years ago when it crossed my mind. So I listened to the album and tried to play most of the way through it just to see, out of curiosity really, how difficult it was. And I figured I could learn to play it all again over the period of a few days. But as soon as I started analyzing the arrangements, I knew there would have to be lines of music dropped and lines of vocals dropped. It was only when I started working on \"Thick As a Brick 2\" that I thought I could find another performer who could play the flute or sing. So I tried out a young actor who worked on Pete Townsend's musical \"Quadrophenia.\" And we booked Ryan O'Donnell to do these upcoming tours. He's sort of an alter-ego for me although he's in his late 20s. As an actor he's able to bring a dramatic interpretation to whatever he might be asked to do -- and it's an interesting dimension to have. We gave him lots of parts to play in both pieces.\n\nMuch of the electric guitar work is reminiscent of Martin Barre's contributions on the original album and the old-school Jethro Tull material. How much did you work with Florian and the production team to craft the electric guitar contributions? And have you had any reaction from Martin about TAAB2?\n\nWell, not directly. But I did have a talk with Martin about this year and the plans I had. And it was determined that this year would be a time for the other [Jethro Tull] musicians to go and do other projects. You know, all of the musicians in the Ian Anderson band except for Ryan have been part of Jethro Tull in recent years. It's probably most difficult for young Florian to have to step into the shoes of someone who has played most of the Jethro Tull shows since 1969 when Martin joined. But Florian understands quite well to what degree he must recreate some of the style of Martin Barre's contributions.\n\nAnd he seems to do it quite well, no disrespect to Martin.\n\nOf course on TAAB2 he is doing his own thing -- we actually sat down and made demos of most of the material in March of 2011. But for the original \"Thick As a Brick\" in concert, the musicians have to take as their starting point the musical notation of those people who did it in 1972, and it was mostly written and arranged by me. A band is a band to some degree -- they are given the parts they are expected to play. I'm not embarrassed to say that Jeffrey Hammond was taught the bass part note-for-note, and he did a great job playing it. But when David, our bass player today, learns those parts, he's learning the parts I gave to Jeffrey back in the day. It's when contemporary band members have to find that improvisational moment, when I think you take a couple of elements from previous performers' inventions. But you have to put your own stamp of nuances and adventure into it. It would be really silly to copy things note-for-note, but you can pay homage to your predecessors -- create something based on the previous model.\n\nSeptember 2012\n\n18 - Miami Beach, FL - The Fillmore Miami Beach at The Jackie Gleason Theater\n\n19 - West Palm Beach, FL - Kravis Center for the Performing Arts - Dreyfoos Hall\n\n21 - St Augustine, FL - St. Augustine Amphitheatre\n\n22 - Orlando, FL - Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre\n\n23 - Clearwater, FL - Ruth Eckerd Hall\n\n24 - Fort Myers.
