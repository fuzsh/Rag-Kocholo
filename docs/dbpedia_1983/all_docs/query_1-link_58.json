Equally at home in all jurisdictions, his theatrical style, command of language and forensic skills filled public galleries, exposed witnesses, persuaded juries and ensured that judges paid attention. An icon of the Sydney and Australian Bar, he appeared in a raft of celebrated cases, became the subject of many media profiles and was, from the 1970s to the 1990s, the countrys most expensive advocate.\\nHughes has also been a wartime pilot, a politician, an activist federal Attorney-General, a grazier, and a racehorse owner. He survived a broken marriage, a spiteful sacking from ministerial office and a prolonged though not permanent loss of an inherited Catholic faith. He endured years of frustration before finding the right partner to replicate the perfect marriage of his beloved parents. Even in dark times, however, a thorough professional and a prodigious worker, Hughes remained focused on his first love, the law, always upholding its traditions and processes.\\nIn addition to published material, the book draws on a huge trove of personal records, including fee books, intimate diaries, autobiographical jottings and private correspondence, supplemented by interviews with Hughes, his family, friends and colleagues. Using these sources, the book provides insights into a many-sided character - telling the story of how Hughes and his immediate forebears embraced more of their English than their Irish heritage while becoming distinctively Australian. It also offers a personal perspective on several decades of Australian political, social and legal history.\\n** Ian Hancock speaking on Tom Hughes QC Many Sides to A Character, The Sydney Institute_13 July 2016 Listen to podcast.\\nIn the media\\n\\nTom Hughes on FIVEaa Adelaide, Afternoons with Jeremy Cordeaux _24 June 2016 Listen to interview.\\nHughes whos who, Richard Ackland, The Saturday Paper, 18-24 June 2016 Read article.\\nTom Hughes on 891 ABC Adelaide with Ian Henschke, Barrister Tom Hughes_16 June 2016 Listen to interview.\\nTom Hughes on ABC Radio National, Breakfast with Fran Kelly, The remarkable life of Tom Hughes QC_8 June 2016 Listen to interview.\\nTom Hughes on ABC Radio Sydney 702, Mornings with Wendy Harmer_8 June 2016\\nTom Hughes on ABC Radio Canberra 666, Mornings with Genevieve Jacobs_8 June 2016\\nJustinian, On the Couch interviews Ian Hancock, 4 June 2016 Read interview.\\nFederal election 2016: Hughes sorry for Abbott lunatic jibe, Rosie Lewis, The Australian - National Affairs, 4 June 2016 Read article.\\nMaking lunatic Abbott Lib leader a folly, Hughes wrote to Turnbull, Troy Bramston, The Australian, 3 June 2016 Read article.\\nTom Hughes urged defeated Malcolm Turnbull to stay in politics, Andrew Clark, Australian Financial Review, 3 June 2016 Read article.\\nThree ministers and a funeral, Australian Financial Review, 3 June 2016 Read extract.\\nTom Hughes sounded warning on switch from son-in-law Malcolm Turnbull to 'lunatic' Tony Abbott in 2009, Fergus Hunter, < Shipping may be from our Sydney, NSW warehouse or from our UK or US warehouse, depending on stock availability.
