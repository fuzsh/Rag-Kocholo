Here's how the arguments against EVs stack up\n\nMost of the perceived barriers to EV uptake aren't really barriers at all, or soon won't be, write Professor John Rose and Dr Andrea Pellegrini for The Conversation.\n\nHospitals worldwide are short of saline.

Shoohb Alassadi, from the University of Sydney and her co-author explain why."
