        "text": "Doorstop Interview Channel Seven and ACER\n\nInterviewer: Minister, I really appreciate your time for us here at Seven. Can I ask you, how bad is the shortage of maths and science teachers? Simon Birmingham: Well, we know there are potentially hundreds of vacancies for maths and science teachers around the country, but many, many more who are underqualified in terms of…\n\nInterview – Doorstop – Canberra\n\nZed Seselja: Welcome all, it’s great to have you all here at St Anthony’s in Wanniassa and can I thank Greg Walker, the principal, all the teachers and the staff and the wonderful students here at St. Anthony’s for hosting us. It’s great to have Minister Birmingham here visiting one of our wonderful schools here…\n\nInterview on 5AA Adelaide Breakfast with David Penberthy\n\nDavid Penberthy: Well the big education story this week was the release of the very depressing NAPLAN figures yesterday morning, where across the entire country there’d been no significant improvement across the board in the literacy standards of our kids, and in South Australia it was a particularly bleak result where improvement was only registered…\n\nInterview on 6PR Perth Drive with Adam Shand\n\nAdam Shand: Right, let’s talk about NAPLAN. The results are in, and there’s a plateauing of performance of students in the NAPLAN according to the results. The only one to buck the trend is Western Australia. When NAPLAN was on, okay, we had a number of calls from parents in Western Australia who said our…\n\nInterview on Channel 10 The Project with Waleed Aly, Carrie Bickmore and Peter Hellier\n\nCarrie Bickmore: Well, Senator Simon Birmingham is the Education Minister and he joins us now. Minister, as we’ve just heard, NAPLAN results are plateauing. We’re falling behind by international standards. Our education system just doesn’t seem to be in a good place at the moment. As Education Minister, that can’t be a great feeling? Simon…\n\nInterview on ABC AM with Michael Brissenden\n\nMichael Brissenden: The numeracy and literacy skills of Australian school students have plateaued despite an increase in Federal Government funding. Results from the 2016 NAPLAN tests released today show a slight improvement in reading and numeracy and a decline in writing. The Government says schools and parents need to focus on evidence-based measures to lift…\n\nInterview on SKY News AM Agenda with Kieran Gilbert\n\nKieran Gilbert: The latest data on the performance of our schools has revealed overall student’s literacy and numeracy skills have stalled. The preliminary NAPLAN results being released today show there’s been no significant improvement in these areas over the last year, despite record funding. I spoke to the Education Minister Simon Birmingham a short time…\n\nInterview on 2SM Breakfast with Grant Goldman\n\nGrant Goldman: Well the NAPLAN results are in and the Government is disappointed with the performance of the education system. Well, they’re not the only ones. The parents are as well and they have been for quite some time. Results show a plateau among students with reading, writing and numeracy not improving as much as…\n\nInterview on 3AW Breakfast with Ross and John\n\nRoss Stevenson: [Indistinct] has made no major gains in literacy and numeracy since 2012, despite the Government push to make Victoria the education state. To me, you can read these NAPLAN figures and construct whatever argument suits your purposes about because if you go through and take out the Australian Capital Territory because it’s not…\n\nInterview on 2GB Drive with Ben Fordham\n\nBen Fordham: Now, NAPLAN. This year’s NAPLAN test results, well, are they a wake up call or what? The scores reveal that billions of dollars in extra funding to our schools have failed to deliver improvements in learning. Literacy and numeracy skills have flat-lined over the last three years, writing skills have gone backwards, spelling,…"
