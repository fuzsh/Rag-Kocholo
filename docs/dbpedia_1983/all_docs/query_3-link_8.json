LINA supports digital and hybrid news publishers to increase the diversity and relevance of news services in communities across Australia. It was established as part of a partnership with the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia (CBAA) to develop industry-wide capacity.\n\nQNews www.qnews.com.au is an LGBTIQA+ media organisation founded in 2000. It is a community platform covering topics from pop culture, politics, and news, through the lens of today’s LGBTIQA+ communities. QNews prints monthly editions in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.

By featuring news, sport, in-depth opinion, interviews, and expert commentary, the publication seeks to foster greater understanding and collaboration within the broader community. IBN launched on July 22.\n\n“The Australian Press Council is delighted to welcome LINA, QNews and IBN,” said Neville Stevens, AO, APC Chair. “Each of these organisations is committed to upholding high editorial standards in their reporting.”\n\nThe Australian Press Council is responsible for promoting high standards of media practice, community access to information of public interest, and freedom of expression through the media. It is also the principal body with responsibility for responding to complaints about Australian newspapers, magazines and associated digital outlets, and digital-only news sites.\n\nFor more information, please contact Dorothy Kennedy, the APC’s media advisor, at Dorothy.kennedy@presscouncil.org.au.\n\nThe Australian Press Council (APC) is very pleased to announce the appointment of Helen Dalley as an Independent Journalist Council Member and Bruce Dover as an Industry Adjudication Panel Member.\n\nHelen Dalley is an experienced broadcast journalist. She is currently the creator and host of the podcast Build It. They’ll Come, a Governor of the Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, Patron of Healthy Bones Australia (formerly Osteoporosis Australia) and Non-Executive Director on the Board of not-for-profit Aurora Education Foundation.\n\nHelen worked as a reporter at the Nine Network for nearly 20 years before spending 11 years at Sky News Australia as a host, anchor and interviewer.

He has also been a foreign correspondent in Asia, winning the Graham Perkin Australian Journalist of the Year award (1986).\n\nIndustry Adjudication Panel Members are independent of publishers and have an important role in determining whether published material, which has been the subject of a complaint, has breached the APC’s Standards of Practice.\n\n“The APC is delighted to welcome Helen and Bruce. Their experience and perspectives are vital to the balance, relevance and integrity of Council’s processes and decisions,” said APC Chair Neville Stevens AO.\n\nThe APC is responsible for promoting freedom of speech through responsible and independent journalism and adherence to high journalistic and editorial standards.
