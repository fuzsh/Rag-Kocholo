The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:30 a.m. in room 406, Senate Dirksen Building, the Hon. James M. Inhofe (chairman of the committee) presiding. Present: Senators Inhofe, Isakson, Bond, Voinovich, Boxer, Thune, Jeffords, Lautenberg. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES M. INHOFE, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA Senator Inhofe. The hearing today is the fourth global warming hearing that I have held as Committee Chairman. This time, we are going to examine the media's role in presenting the science of climate change. I have to say, Senator Boxer, that we had decided to have this fourth hearing before the Republicans lost the majority on that fateful Tuesday. So we are going to go ahead and have this, and I am sure that we will have an opportunity to explore this much more under your chairmanship. Poorly conceived policy decisions may result from the media's over-hyped reporting. Much of the mainstream media has subverted its role as an objective source of information on climate change into a role of an advocate. We have seen examples of this overwhelmingly one-sided reporting by 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley, ABC's Bill Blakemore, CNN's Miles O'Brien, who I believe is here with us today or will be, Time Magazine, the Associated Press, Reuters, just to name a few. There are three types of climate research: first, the hard science of global warming by climate scientists; second, the computer modelers; and finally, the researchers who study the impacts. Rather than focus on the hard science of global warming, the media has instead becomes advocates of hyping scientifically unfounded climate alarmism. I am not the only one who believes that. Here are just a few examples of believers. Now these are people who believe, well, first of all let us clarify what the issue is. I think all of us know that we are going through cycles, and we have throughout recorded history where it gets warmer and gets cooler. We are going through a warmer cycle now, and I have contended, as many scientists have, that this is due to natural causes. But if you don't believe that and believe that it is due to anthropogenic gases or manmade gases or methane or CO2, then you are in that camp. So, some of the people who believe that still believe the media is wrong in the way they have been reporting it. Mike Hulme, the director of the U.K.-based Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, a group that believes humans are the driving force behind global warming, chastised the media and environmentalists last month for choosing to use ``the language of fear and terror to scare people.'' Hulme noted that he has found himself ``increasingly chastised by global warming activists because his public statements have not satisfied the activists' thirst for environmental drama and exaggerated rhetoric.'' Second, a report in August 2006 from the U.K.'s Labor- Leaning Institute for Public Policy Research also slammed the media presentation of climate science as--this is what they said; these are people who are believers in the other side of this about manmade global warming--``a quasi-religious register of doom, death, judgment, heaven and hell, using words such as catastrophe, chaos, and havoc.'' The report also compared the media's coverage of global warming to ``the unreality of Hollywood films.'' Now these are the believers we are talking about. In addition, NBC newsman, Tom Brokaw's one-sided 2006 Discovery Channel, his 1-hour program, a global warming documentary, was criticized by a Bloomberg News TV review that noted, ``You will find more dissent,'' referring to the presentation that was made by Tom Brokaw, ``You will find more dissent at a North Korean political rally than in this program.'' The media often fails to distinguish between predictions and what is actually being observed on the Earth today. We know from an April 23, 2006 article, in the New York Times by Andrew Revkin that ``Few scientists agree with the idea that the recent spate of potential Hurricanes, European heat waves, African droughts, and other weather extremes are, in essence, our fault, a result of manmade emission. There is more than enough natural variability in nature to match the difference.'' Again, we are talking about someone who generally would be on the other side. The New York Times is essentially saying no recent weather events including Hurricane Katrina is because of manmade global warming, yet most of the media fails to understand this fundamental point and instead focuses on global warming computer model projections of futures as if they were proven fact. This is perhaps the easiest scientific area for the media to exaggerate and serve as advocates for alarmism. Climate modelers project all kinds of scary scenarios. This allows the media to pick and choose which one they want to show and demonstrate and characterize as being true. Hysteria sells, and people are out there doing it. Clearly, we cannot today somehow disprove catastrophic predictions of our climate in the year 2100, but if the observations of what is happening today are not consistent with what global warming models predict should occur, then what we do know is that our understanding of the globe is incomplete. The fact is the biosphere is extremely complex, and startling discoveries happen every year. This point was driven home earlier this year when the journal, Nature, reported that trees emit methane. Now this is something that was brand new. They had not used the fact that trees emit methane. Methane is a type of anthropogenic gas, similar to CO2. If this does affect climate, it would affect climate. Yet, the models didn't even have this. This is a great discovery. Trees are everywhere, and we didn't use this as a basic fact about our planet. Some portions of this committee are focused on alarmism rather than a responsible path forward on this issue. If your goal is to limit emissions, whether for traditional pollution or CO2, the only effective way to go about it is the use of cleaner, more efficient technologies that will meet the energy demands of this century and behind. In the Bush administration, their Asia-Pacific Partnership is on target for this type of an approach. It stresses the sharing of new technology among member nations including three of the world's top 10 emitters who are exempt from Kyoto. We are talking about China, India, and South Korea. China, by the end of 2009, will become the world's largest CO2 emitter. What is disappointing is that the President's program gets more positive press in other countries than it does here in the United States. So the alarmism is not just coming in the media, it is advancing. They are becoming more desperate because former supporters of their views are now changing their position. Former advocates such as David Bellamy, Britain's famed environmental campaigner, was one of the most vocal back in the late 1990s on CO2 and manmade gases contributing to climate change. David Bellamy and also Claude Allegre, a French geophysicist and a former Socialist Party leader in France. I don't know anyone else who has this in their credentials. He is a member of both the French and the United States Academies of Science. Allegre now says the cause of warming remains unknown, and alarmism ``has become a very lucrative business for some people. In short, their motivation is money.'' I agree with Allegre, probably the only thing that I agree with him on, that it is money. [The prepared statement of Senator Inhofe follows:] Statement of Hon. James M. Inhofe, U.S. Senator from the State of Oklahoma Today's hearing is the fourth global warming hearing I have held as committee chairman.

'' The report also compared the media's coverage of global warming to ``the unreality of Hollywood films.'' In addition, former NBC Newsman Tom Brokaw's one sided 2006 Discovery Channel global warming documentary was criticized by a Bloomberg News TV review that noted ``You'll find more dissent at a North Korean political rally than in this program'' because of its lack of scientific objectivity.

The fact is, the biosphere is extremely complex and startling discoveries happen every year. This point was driven home earlier this year when the Journal Nature reported that trees emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Trees are everywhere, yet we didn't even know this most basic fact about our planet. It is unfortunate that so many are focused on alarmism rather than a responsible path forward on this issue.

Allegre now says the cause of warming remains unknown and the alarmism ``has become a very lucrative business for some people.'' In short, their motivation is money. And he's right . . . its about money. Senator Inhofe. Senator Jeffords, what we did was recess the business meeting, at which time as soon as we have 10 people here, we will go back in it for our three nominations. In the meantime, we have started this. We now have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. We have seven members. If you would like to be recognized now for your opening statement, feel free to do so. Senator Jeffords. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Inhofe. Let me say this before you do. I liked you equally when you were Republican as when you caucused with the Democrats. In the years we served together in the House and in the Senate and your chairmanship of this committee when I was the Ranking Member, then my chairmanship when you are the Ranking Member, equally enjoyable, and while we differ in our philosophies and our views, you have always been fair. You have been a good personal friend. I just appreciate so much the service that you have rendered to your State and to the country in both the House and the Senate. Senator Jeffords. Well, thank you for those very kind words, Mr. Chairman. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES M. JEFFORDS, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT I am going home. As my friend, Robert Frost, once said, ``Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.'' [Laughter.] Senator Jeffords. My farm is on the west side of Killington Peak in the small village of Shrewsbury, VT. The snow comes early there. I filled the woodshed for the winter already. My snowshoes are hanging on the hook in the shed. Hopefully, I will get to see the birches covered in snow next week. I miss my farm. Before we part ways, I would like to recognize a few people. Mr. Chairman, I thoroughly enjoyed working with you. Incredibly, when we disagree, it has always been in good spirit and our bond of friendship has carried us through these 5 years. You have been so kind to me in so many ways. Thank you. You have a wonderful staff. I have many friends on both sides of the dais. I wish you all well. This is one of the best committees in Congress. I hope the years ahead are as productive as I think they have been. I am happy now to know that Vermont will continue to be represented on this wonderful committee. Senator Sanders will easily fill the shoes of former Chairman Bob Stafford and me. All of Vermont is proud to have him in the Senate. I have been blessed to have an excellent staff serving me through the years here on the committee. I can't list them all, but there are a few here today. When I mention your names, will you please stand up and wave your hand? We already miss a few staff that have moved on including Alison Taylor, Geoff Brown, and Malcolm Woolf. Caroline Ahearn, David Sandretti, Nicole Parisi-Smith, Amanda Fox, Rachel Winnik, and Eric Thu have served me exceptionally well. Carolyn Dupree, who came with me from the HELP Committee, has been so committed to EPW and to me. She is one of the great ones. Jo-Ellen Darcy, Catharine Ransom, Margaret Wetherald, Chris Miller, Michael Goo, Mary Frances Repko, and J.C. Sandberg have all had legendary careers to date in the Senate, and I hope they continue. Cara Cookson from Cabot, VT, has served her home State with great honor. Diane Derby, another great Vermonter, has been an outstanding spokesperson and advisor to me for many years. She handled committee communications and my own press and was able to make this plain-spoken Senator sound august and intelligent. My hat is off to you, Diane. Bill Kurtz, my Chief of Staff, my friend, my golf companion, is simply one of the greatest people that has ever served me and the State of Vermont. Finally, I would like to thank my old pal, Ken Connolly. [Applause.] Senator Jeffords. Since 1993, he has been with me, and we have had some amazing times together. When Ken started with me those many years ago, he was single. He didn't have three children, and he didn't have any gray hair. I think we can only blame the Senate for the gray hair, not me. Ken helped me put together the greatest EPW staff of all time, and I thank him for that. As for the topic at hand, global warming, I can only say that I am sorry I was not able to do more to change the minds of the skeptics that remain in our Nation. The climate is warming. It is due to human activity, and only a change in human behavior will ensure that my grandson, Patton Henry Jeffords, will not suffer the consequences. As I rise from this chair, I do so knowing that its future occupant is a strong and courageous leader. I salute you, Senator Boxer, for your tireless effort to improve the lot of mankind. I will be watching from my quiet mountain retreat and praying that under your leadership, the committee will continue to be as great tomorrow as it has been in the past. In parting, I would like to cite one of Robert Frost's refrains, my favorite man: ``Whose woods these are I think I know. His house is in the village, though. He will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow. ``The woods are lovely, dark and deep. But I have promises to keep. And miles to go before I sleep. And miles to go before I sleep.'' Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [Applause.] [The prepared statement of Senator Jeffords follows:] Statement of Hon. James M. Jeffords, U.S. Senator from the State of Vermont Mr. Chairman, I'm going home. As my friend Robert Frost once said, ``Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.''

But I have promises to keep And miles to go before I sleep. And miles to go before I sleep.'' Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Senator Jeffords. That was beautiful. When you were introducing your staff, it occurred to me that so many people and probably the vast majority of the people in this room don't realize how close we have been with our staffs and how often we are in agreement. We went through the Transportation Reauthorization Bill, a really long and arduous thing, and the Water Bill which we unfortunately are losing now. It is not due to this committee. We worked together. Senator Boxer and Senator Jeffords and all of us on this side worked tirelessly and tried to get it done, and our staffs worked closely together. I just hope people realize that while we do have some subjects where we disagree, we have many more where we were in total agreement during the years that we served together. Senator Boxer. Mr. Chairman? Senator Inhofe. Yes, Senator Boxer. Senator Boxer. Can I have a point of personal privilege just for a moment to respond to our friend's comments? Senator Inhofe. Of course. Senator Boxer. First of all, how touched we are with what you said. I totally appreciate the fact that you mentioned how wonderful our Chairman has been to you. He is a good man. I think we have proven the fact that we don't have to agree on everything in order to get along and to respect each other and to work together. I think our Chairman pointed out actually there are some issues in which we can work really closely, and we will do that. I just want to say you have set the tone for me. I really have two goals for this committee, and I know you share them so I am going to say what they are. One is to protect the health of our families, our children, and the planet. The other is to bring bipartisanship back to this committee in a way that we really, truly reach out to each other because I know we can find common ground. I know that I have found that common ground with the Chairman. I have found that common ground with Senator Thune on certain issues. No one expected we could team up, and we did, and we will find it with others. I know the members on our side, many new members who are coming, are very excited about the traditions of this committee and to really get things done for the people. We are so lucky with the portfolio that we have. In many ways, yes, some contentious things, but there are a lot of things that we need to do to keep on growing in this country, and the public works side of it certainly enables us to make a contribution. But Senator Jeffords, you are loved; you are beloved. Your staff has served you magnificently, and it has been my privilege to work with them and with you. I will never forget our friendship and your courage and your dedication. Thank you. Senator Inhofe. Just a moment, Senator Isakson, did you have any comments to make along this line before we go to Senator Lautenberg? Senator Isakson. With regard to our distinguished colleague from Vermont, I do have a comment. I think John and I are the two, I won't say youngest but we are certainly the two newest members of the Senate on this committee. I had the privilege of being elected with John in 2004, and I had the privilege of meeting and getting to know Senator Jeffords. I just want to take this occasion to thank him for the many kindnesses he extended to me as a new member of the Senate, thank him for that which I have learned from him, and remind him that Frost wrote a lot of great poems. One of my favorite lines from Frost's work is ``Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.'' If there is anybody on this committee who is emblematic of taking a different road and making a difference, it certainly is you, and I commend you on your contribution to the committee, your contribution to the Senate, and I wish you a lot of luck in those snowshoes and fireplaces in Vermont. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Senator Isakson. Senator Lautenberg. Senator Lautenberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a special feeling for Vermont and Vermonters since I have owned a little place up there since 1968. My kids and I love the mountains, the Green Mountains, and the people who inhabit them. They are a particular breed, and they are not unlike the actual character of Vermont: hardy, tough, beautiful, attractive. Jim Jeffords comes with a line of distinguished Senators who have served here from Vermont on this committee. Bob Stafford and I were good friends. The fact that we are going to be having Senator Sanders with us, that gives me some encouragement that the Vermont influence will not diminish here, and I look at Pat Leahy. The Vermonters have a way of being direct without being offensive. Fairness has always been a cornerstone of Senator Jeffords' being. We are good pals. We are going to miss the heck out of you. But Jim, if I come up to Vermont, it is not snowshoes; I still like skiing. I hope that we will be able to cross paths along the way. God bless and thank you for the wonderful service you have given to this committee and this country. Senator Jeffords. Thank you. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Senator Lautenberg. Senator Voinovich. Senator Voinovich. I echo the comments of your other colleagues, Jim. You and I have been working together for 8 years. This is my 8th year on the committee. I must say that even though we have had some major differences of opinion, our relationship has been on the highest level, and I want you to know that I respect you for your integrity and for your advocacy on those things that you really believe in and feel are important to your State and to our country. I think that one of the things that impresses me with this body is that we have people like you who speak from the heart and really care about making a difference. I want you to know that we are going to miss your presence on this committee. I hope you enjoy your retirement and as you look in on this committee's work this year, that you not become too frustrated. Thank you so much for everything you have done for your State and for our country and for your friendship with me. Senator Jeffords. Thank you. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Senator Voinovich. Senator Thune. Senator Thune. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I too want to express my appreciation to Senator Jeffords for his service. You wouldn't remember this, but I do. In 1988, I and somebody I was working for, we went to Vermont and campaigned for your election to the Senate back then. I am not a collector of such things, but I was going through some stuff the other day, and I actually have a Jeffords pin or button I think from that 1988 campaign. In any event, that was a long time ago, and I have only been here a couple of years. Like Johnny, I appreciate very much your kindness. I think that is something that there just isn't enough of around here. I appreciate the fact that you have always been a gentleman and also that you are a principled individual. That is something too that is important to me. I think people in public life want to accomplish certain things, and I think you can do it in a way, a principled way but do it with an element of kindness too. I think those are two qualities that you have really embodied in your service here. So thank you, and I congratulate you. As you retire and go off and do hopefully more fun and pleasant things than battling some of the issues we battle around here, I wish you well. Thank you. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Senator Thune. As I had said earlier, we have recessed our business meeting. We will go back to it as soon as we get 10 people in here to make a quorum. The nominees are not going to be here, but we have announced who they are. But on the witnesses that are here today, we are going to welcome them and enjoy their opening statements. Prior to that, I would ask if there are other members who want to make a statement in conjunction with the subject of the hearing today. Senator Boxer. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Senator Boxer. Mr. Chairman, I am glad we are holding a hearing on global warming today. As you alluded to, next year this committee will continue to examine how to contain global warming. We have a big job since out of the 56 biggest emitters of carbon dioxide, American is now No. 1. We are 53d out of the 56 nations in our efforts to contain global warming. So we have a lot of work to do. I would like to raise a concern that I have about the focus on the media this morning. The free expression of the media is a deeply held valued in this country, and the one thing I would hope we don't want to do is to chill the free expression of the media. I have a concern about focusing a full Senate Committee hearing on whether we agree with the vast spectrum of media outlets when it comes to the presentation of global warming issues. In a free society in what is the greatest democracy in the world, I don't believe it is proper to put pressure on the media to please a particular Senate Committee view, one way or the other. It is clear that the dissenting views on global warming get plenty of attention in the media, and we have a witness today who will speak to that issue. At the same time, there is a consensus view of scientists, and that view is that global warming is happening and human activities are making a significant contribution. The Bush administration itself says that. Now there is a serious risk to the world. It is not just the consensus view among leading scientists including 11 National Academies of Science throughout the world including our own; it is a wide consensus view. For example, let us look at the business community. Lord Brown, CEO of British Petroleum, has said of global warming, ``Companies composed of highly skilled and trained people can't live in denial of mounting evidence gathered by hundreds of the most reputable scientists in the world.'' Let us look at the CEO of Wal-Mart, Lee Scott, who just said this year, ``Global warming is real now, and it must be addressed.'' JPMorgan Chase, the fourth largest banking company in the world, has a policy that states, ``JPMorgan Chase advocates the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.'' There is even a Pentagon report that says climate change should ``be elevated beyond a scientific debate to a national security concern.'' That is our Pentagon. And so, I think if you look at both what is being said in the media as well as the broad spectrum of voices on this issue, it seems more than clear that global warming is a serious concern. A consensus has developed that we need to act. My other sadness with this hearing is again we are arguing over who believes what rather than moving toward solving the problem. What we need to do next is focus our attention on how we can fight this serious threat. I believe that fighting global warming will have many benefits to our society beyond addressing the media issue. We discussed this a little bit at one of our other hearings, Mr. Chairman. The new technologies we are developing will produce jobs. The alternative fuels we are developing burn cleaner and will aid us with the critical goal of energy independence. Avoiding the dislocation that could be caused by global warming induced floods and other disasters will lead us to a more stable world. I have great faith in this country, and though we have been slow to address the threat, I am convinced, convinced that we can do what it takes to change course and protect the future for our children and our grandchildren. Mr. Chairman, this certainly is not going to be the last word, what we do today, but I am glad we are having this hearing because I think it gives us a chance to tell our constituents where we each stand on this question. Through a series of hearings, we are going to call forward people from both sides of the issue. We are going to call on other Senators, Senators in this committee. We are going to call on business leaders. We are going to call on faith-based organizations, many of whom have contacted us and want to work with us, faith-based organizations who believe we have to protect God's planet. So I think this issue is going to take on, in many ways, a life of its own, and I only hope and I do pray that enough of us on this committee will be able to work together to reach some consensus on beginning to contain global warming. Thank you. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Senator Boxer, for that excellent statement. On this side, any opening statements, Senator Isakson? Senator Voinovich? OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GEORGE V. VOINOVICH, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Senator Voinovich. Mr. Chairman, I have been a member of this committee, as I mentioned in my remarks with regard to Senator Jeffords, for 8 years, and I have had a chance to participate in numerous climate change hearings in this committee as well as the Governmental Affairs Committee. When Senator Lieberman was Chairman of that committee, he took that committee and had hearings on global warming and climate change. I have heard vigorous debate on both sides of the issue. Unfortunately, the media and those involved politically in this issue have raised the rhetoric to such a point that it is difficult for consensus. Far too often, we talk past each other because it doesn't promote or defend a certain agenda and any other point of view that is not orthodox is moot or, worse, unworthy to be heard. I remember, Mr. Chairman, when we had Michael Crichton here testifying, who wrote the book, State of Fear, and Mr. Crichton discussed the issue of the media's impact on this whole climate change issue. I asked him the question. You remember we had lunch with him afterward, and I said: Are they going to make a movie? Some of his books have been made movies. He said: You have got be kidding me. There is no way they will make a movie on State of Fear because the perspective that I outline in this book about the media's influence doesn't fit in with what most people in Hollywood think the issue is about. That is a good example, I think, of how the media does impact upon this. Then I remember when I first came here, Bjorn Lomborg who is from Denmark, who is a great environmentalist, and who studied Kyoto and came back and said that with the costs involved and the result that we would get from it, really if you look at the money spent on that, you could do far more with the money in terms of bringing potable water to African nations and health and education. There is no question that the media has had some impact on what we are doing. The reality is that not all climate change skeptics are denialists or ideologues, and those in the environmental movement are not all alarmists. We can learn a lot and achieve more if we listen a little more to each other, and I suspect that is what Americans believe and what they expect us to work together on in terms of this issue. I think one of the things, Senator Boxer, that has bothered me a bit about this committee is that so often we get together and we discuss some of these issues and because of special interest groups on both sides, because of media interest, we don't listen to each other. I happen to believe that there is a problem, that we have to deal with climate change, OK. The issue is how do we go about dealing with the issue. I think we also have to become well aware of the fact that what we do also is going to be impacted dramatically by the developing countries. For example, we know that China is building a new coal-fired plant every week, every single week, and many of them lack modern pollution control devices. We are talking about energy for cities like the size of Dallas. Researchers say, for example, that our Great Lakes that I am very interested in, 20 percent of the mercury now is coming from China. So this is a worldwide problem. I think any time we deal with it, we have to realize that we have a role to play, but we also must recognize that others have a role to play and the more we can engage them in this debate, the better off we are going to be and the better off the world is going to be. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Senator Voinovich. Senator Lautenberg did you have any comments? OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY Senator Lautenberg. Disappointingly, I may have some comments. Mr. Chairman, I want to start off by putting away the gloves. I am not going to lock the cabinet, but the fact of the matter is we just had one of those moments in the U.S. Senate when our hearts take a lead in our views. I am talking about someone as noble as Jim Jeffords is and how wonderful it is as he leaves this place that we all detail our feelings about how nice it is to work with someone who has such balance. I don't think the people who are new to come here were elected to cross the bipartisan divide but rather they are here to accomplish something, and we have to get on with that. We have to be frank with one another. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for providing us an opportunity today to prove to the American people or at least inform the American people that we don't think that global warming is really a hoax, that it is real, that is out there in front of us. To ignore it and to dismiss it as a bad joke doesn't, in my view, do the public any good and certainly does not speak well in my view of the Senate or those who are advocating push it away and maybe we will be lucky and it won't come back. I think everybody knows that I look at the world through my grandchildren's eyes and think about what I would like to see for the future. But for the last 6 years, the way the Administration has behaved toward the environment I think has negatively affected our world. We just heard from our distinguished friend from Ohio that this is a worldwide problem and that we are concerned now about China building all these plants and disregarding good environmental control. America is purportedly the leader in the world, so it is not for us to point our fingers at other countries and say they are going to do terrible things to the environment unless we lead the way, unless we convey a message that we really are concerned about the environment and it means something to us. Joined by Exxon, American Petroleum Institute, and others, there has been a misleading of the American people about the threats that global warming poses to our communities and our countries and the continents. The reason people are making movies and writing books focusing on the environment is because major changes in our environment like global warming are happening, and the evidence is so clear in front of us. Think about it. We have all seen pictures of the polar bears. The mighty polar bears are now reduced to ragged herds, searching, foraging for food. Their environment is being less hospitable to them, and they are out there searching for ways to stay alive. I don't know whether anybody has not ever seen a picture of a polar bear, but I have seen them up there, alive and powerful. Now to see them looking like almost enlarged alley cats is pathetic. Global warming is melting our glaciers, leading to record temperatures, changing our weather, changing the conditions of our oceans. For heavens sake, what does it take to say there is something amiss out there? The oil companies and the other polluters have borrowed a page from the tobacco industry's playbook: create fake science in order to undermine real science. But it is time to focus on, if I may borrow the words, an inconvenient truth. Global warming is real. It is caused by man; entirely, perhaps not but significantly, of course. The Bush administration has spent 6 years avoiding any real action. The Administration has declined to put mandatory caps on carbon emission and opposed the significant improvement of cap and trade standards. They refuse to let California set tailpipe emissions on carbon dioxide for their cars. In the past year alone, politicians, not scientists, have kept NOAA and NASA experts from discussing and releasing their work on global warming. Now when scientists can't tell the public what they have learned, then we will have to rely on the media to uncover the truth. I plead with those in the media: Speak up for heavens sake. Call it; say it like it is. That is the power of your profession. The power of science is that it is beholden to no one. It is not Democrat, Republican, or Independent. I am hopeful with a change here and the chairs are going to shift. I have great respect for our Chairman, and I have also, as some might have noticed, some great differences, occasional differences. But the fact of the matter is there is mutual respect because I know that Senator Inhofe ultimately has the same issues in mind as I have, and that is to make our Nation a healthier place, but we see it through different colored glasses. What I want to do and hope that we can is really reduce the threat that global warming brings to my grandchildren, to your grandchildren, and to your grandchildren, so the future generations can look at what we have done to contribute to their well-being and not to destroy reality. [The prepared statement of Senator Lautenberg follows:] Statement of Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg, U.S. Senator from the State of New Jersey Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to first thank Senator Jeffords for his service to Vermont and to our nation. He has worked for safer, smarter transportation, better health care options, and to protect our environment. He has served with distinction. He will be missed in this Committee and the Senate. Mr. Chairman, now I want to thank you for providing us an opportunity today to prove to you that global warming is not a hoax--it is real. I saw a movie recently called Hoot. It's a story about a boy and his friends who save a group of owls from losing their habitat. I liked Hoot because it tells the truth: the way we behave affects the world. For the last six years, the way the Bush administration has behaved towards the environment has negatively affected our world. Joined by Exxon, the American Petroleum Institute, and others, the administration has misled Americans about the threats global warming poses to our communities, our country, and the continents. The reason people are making movies and writing books focusing on the environment is because major changes in our environment--like global warming--are happening, and people want to know the truth. The truth is that global warming is no hoax. There is no conspiracy. What you hear, what you read, what you see, is reality. Global warming is melting our glaciers, leading to record temperatures, changing our weather, and changing the conditions of our oceans. The oil companies and other polluters have borrowed a page from the tobacco industry's playbook: creating fake science in order to undermine real science. But it's time to focus on an inconvenient truth: global warming is real, caused by man, and the Bush administration has spent six years avoiding real action. The administration has declined to put mandatory caps on carbon emissions, opposed a significant improvement of CAFE standards, and refused to let California set tailpipe emissions standards on carbon dioxide for their cards. In the past year alone, politicians--not scientists--have kept NOAA's and NASA's experts from discussing and releasing their work on global warming. And when scientists can't tell the public what they've learned, then we will have to rely on the media to uncover the truth. The power of science is that it's beholden to no one: it is not Democratic or Republican. I am hopeful that, in the aftermath of November's elections, and with a new Congress, America's scientists will be able to tell their own story--and we can use their expert advice and help to reduce global warming. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Senator Lautenberg. I would now ask that the statements of Senators Thune and Bond be included in the record. [The prepared statement of Senator Thune was not available at time of print.] [The prepared statement of Senator Bond follows:] Statement of Senator Christopher S. Bond, U.S. Senator from the State of Missouri Thank you Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing on climate change and the media. Certainly, we have heard, and will hear more today, examples of the media's focus on climate change advocates. What I want to focus on is what the media is not covering, what the media needs to cover and what this committee needs to focus upon if it is serious about considering climate change strategies. That is the human toll current climate change fighting strategies will impose on people, on families, and on workers. We cannot, I cannot, and I will fight, fighting climate change on the backs of the poor. The weak, the infirm, the vulnerable, are all in the crosshairs of proposals put forward by climate change advocates. Proposals that cap, ration or tax carbon energy and its waste will raise the cost of our most basic needs--heating, cooling, lighting-- that no family, rich or poor, can do without. However, it will be the poor that will suffer most when heating bills go up in the winter. Fixed income seniors will suffer most when air conditioning bills go up in the summer. Families, especially blue-collar, middle class families will suffer most when their bread-winner loses their job. These are the untold stories, the unreported stories that I challenge the media, and now the committee, to tell. Maybe we should not be surprised that the press is not talking about how current climate change proposals will hurt everyday people, because advocates surely are not talking about it. ``An Inconvenient Truth'' runs about 95 minutes. In it you will find about an hour and 20 minutes on global warming and its environmental impacts, 10 minutes of what to do about global warming and about 5 minutes on how much those proposals might cost. Nothing on forcing low-income families to choose between heat and eat. Read the book ``Field Notes from a Catastrophe: Man, Nature and Climate Change'' and you'll get chapters on the Golden Toad and the Mountain Ringlet Butterfly. It bills itself as ``the most important book about life on Earth in over forty years.'' But it provides no advice to fixed-income seniors forced to chose between prescription drug medicine and air conditioning their homes in the Summer. The book ``The Weather Makers: How Man is Changing the Climate and What it Means for Life on Earth'' does devote 30 of its 300 pages to solutions. But advice on walking, biking and hybrids will hardly meet the needs of blue-collar Midwestern manufacturing workers put out of work by higher energy costs. It is no surprise that advocates do not want to talk about the severe human toll of their current proposals. The ``Economist'' estimates the costs of adequate emissions controls at 1 to 5 percent of global GDP. That works out to between $440 billion and $2.2 trillion. Assuming America's fair at 25 percent would cost us $100 to $500 billion per year. And who will pay that $100 to $500 billion? You and me and everyone less fortunate than us because every electric utility, every car maker, every maker of a product we can't do without will pass that cost right on to us. We might as well be raising the cost of milk, diapers and prescription drugs. Do not tell me the costs are bearable because the average cost per family is low. Some groups will say that current proposals are affordable at only $100 per family per year. Of course, they do not say that no one will pay $100--that some will pay less and some will pay a whole lot more. They cannot tell us whether these nationwide cost figures will impose unbearable disproportionate regional harm--how they may spare the natural gas burning Northeast and West Coast but hit hard the coal burning Midwest. They cannot tell us whether their plans will impose disproportionate harm on certain blue-collar workers--how they may spare California high-tech and New York finance but will hit hard middle-class workers dependent on power from coal and natural gas, manufacturing, chemical, fertilizer and automotive jobs. If this committee wants to get past the rhetoric and seriously consider climate change fighting proposals, it must come up with these answers--we must debate these issues. We need to know what regions of the country, what States, what cities will be affected by proposals. What sectors of the economy, what types of jobs, their locations, who holds them and who will lose them? What types of workers, blue collar, union, are most at risk? What types of people, families, young, old, struggling, will face burdens too high? General legislation that leaves the details and dirty work to others, like those recently passed at the State level, that abdicate these questions, abdicate our responsibility to pass judgment on these issues, are unacceptable. We have a responsibility to those we may hurt to know more, consider more, and do more. Some have said that they want to make this committee an environment committee, not an anti-environment committee. We must be an environment committee, but we cannot be an anti-poor committee, an anti-blue collar committee, an anti-family committee. Then we will be able to see if we can work together. Thank you. Senator Inhofe. We will ask the witnesses to please come to the table. We have Dr. David Deming from the University of Oklahoma, College of Earth and Energy; Dr. Daniel Schrag, Laboratory of Geochemical Oceanography, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Harvard University; Dr. R.M. Carter, Marine Geophysical Laboratory, James Cook University, Australia; Dr. Naomi Oreskes, director of Science Studies Program, University of California at San Diego and professor, Department of History and Program in Science Studies; and Dan Gainor, The Boone Pickens Free Market Fellow and director, Business & Media Institute. It is not the purpose of this meeting and while I appreciate very much the comments that are being made, I do have documentation that I would be glad to share with anyone after the meeting on the plight of the polar bears--they are doing quite well--also a long list of scientists who certainly agree on the point that we are going through a warming cycle, but it is not related to manmade emissions. What I would like to ask you to do, the five panelist members, since we took a little longer on opening is to each one try to confine your remarks to 5 minutes. Your entire statement will be made a part of the record. I think particularly we might give a little bit longer to Dr. Carter. He came all the way from Australia for this meeting. So we appreciate that very, very much, Dr. Carter. At any time that we happen to have 10 members here, we will go back to our meeting. Senator Boxer, I don't think that is going to happen, judging from who isn't here right now. So let me just announce that after the first vote today, we will go to the President's room and have our business meeting at that time if we don't have 10 here, if that is all right. We will start with you, Dr. Deming, and thank you for being here from the great University of Oklahoma. STATEMENT OF DAVID DEMING, Ph.D., UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA, COLLEGE OF EARTH AND ENERGY Mr. Deming. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, and distinguished guests, thank you for inviting me to testify today. I am a geologist and geophysicist. I have a Bachelor's Degree in geology from Indiana University and a Ph.D. in geophysics from the University of Utah. My field of specialization in geophysics is temperature and heat flow. In recent years, I have turned my studies to the history and philosophy of science. In 1995, I published a short paper in the academic journal, Science. In that study, I reviewed how borehole temperature data recorded a warming of about 1 C in North America over the last 100 to 150 years. The week the article appeared, I was contacted by a reporter for National Public Radio. He offered to interview me but only if I would state that warming was due to human activity. When I refused to do so, he hung up on me. I had another interesting experience around the time my paper in Science was published. I received an astonishing e- mail from a major researcher in the area of climate change. He said, ``We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.'' The Medieval Warm Period was a time of unusually warm weather that began around 1000 A.D. and persisted until a cold period known as the Little Ice Age took hold in the 14th Century. Warmer climate brought a remarkable flowering of prosperity, knowledge, and art to Europe during the high Middle Ages. The existence of the Medieval Warm Period had been recognized in the scientific literature for decades, but now it was a major embarrassment to those maintaining that the 20th Century warming was truly anomalist. It had to ``be gotten rid of.'' In 1769, Joseph Priestley warned that scientists overly attached to a favored hypothesis would not hesitate to ``warp the whole course of nature.'' In 1999, Michael Mann and his colleagues published a reconstruction of past temperature in which the Medieval Warm Period simply vanished. This unique estimate became known as the hockey stick because of the shape of the temperature graph. Normally in science when you have a novel result that appears to overturn previous work, you have to demonstrate why the earlier work was wrong, but the work of Mann and his colleagues was initially accepted uncritically even though it contradicted the results of more than 100 previous studies. Other researchers have since reaffirmed that the Medieval Warm Period was both warm and global in its extent. There is an overwhelming bias today in the media regarding the issue of global warming. In the past 2 years, this bias has bloomed into an irrational hysteria. Every natural disaster that occurs is now linked with global warming no matter how tenuous or impossible the connection. As a result, the public has become vastly misinformed on this and other environmental issues. Earth's climate system is complex and poorly understood, but we do know that throughout human history, warmer temperatures have been associated with more stable climates and increased human health and prosperity. Colder temperatures have been correlated with climatic instability, famine, and increased human mortality. The amount of climatic warming that has taken place in the past 150 years is poorly constrained and its cause, human or natural, is unknown. There is no sound scientific basis for predicting future climate change with any degree of certainty. If the climate does warm, it is likely to be beneficial to humanity rather than harmful. In my opinion, it would be foolish to establish national energy policy on the basis of misinformation and irrational hysteria. Thank you. Senator Inhofe. Thank you very much. Thank you, Dr. Deming. Dr. Schrag. STATEMENT OF DANIEL SCHRAG, Ph.D., LABORATORY FOR GEOCHEMICAL OCEANOGRAPHY, DEPARTMENT OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES, HARVARD UNIVERSITY Mr. Schrag. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all the Senators for hearing us today. I am going to depart from my written comments and just speak from them more generally. First of all, let me say that I think one of the problems with media coverage of climate change is that it is being covered in a very political era where the issue has become quite divided across partisan lines. I think that is very unfortunate. This is really a bipartisan issue. Moreover, I think science reporters are often very concerned about making sure that both sides are discussed as opposed to framing the issue. I see the issue quite differently. I am an earth scientist who studies the history of the climate on all time scales and also modern climate dynamics. Let me just start a little bit with the way I think this issue should be discussed. I attached some figures that I am going to refer to in these comments. Let me start with some observations about the climate system, about the atmosphere that are absolutely incontrovertible. There is no serious objection to them at all even by the serious scientific skeptics. Carbon dioxide levels today are the highest they have been for at least the last 650,000 years and that is by direct observation from measuring gas bubbles in ice cores. We can't go further back than that because that is the oldest ice core we have. But indirectly by measuring chemistry of the ocean which tells us something about the ph and therefore the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we can say that levels that we are seeing today and levels that we will see this century are higher than they have been for tens of millions of years. If you look at the Figure 1 that I have attached, you will see this represented where today and relative to the last 650,000 years, the carbon dioxide concentration is far above anything we have ever seen. That is everybody in this room today is seeing an atmosphere unlike any human being ever in the history of the world. Now the question in front of us is: What is that going to do? We know that this carbon dioxide rises due to burning of fossil fuel primarily with some contribution from deforestation as well. The good news is that the Earth is actually cushioning us a little bit. Only about 60 percent of the CO2 we emit from burning fossil fuel ends up in the atmosphere. Some of it is taken up by the ocean. Some of it is taken up by terrestrial plants. Unfortunately, the natural world can't absorb it fast enough. We are burning fossil fuels too quickly, and the CO2 is rising faster and faster. As Senator Voinovich said, the developing countries, in particular China today, are burning more and more coal. Currently about 46 percent of the world's coal is being used in China, and that is contributing more and more. They will soon pass us as the largest emitter of carbon dioxide. Now the important thing here is then what is this going to do for the climate. We know that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It absorbs infrared radiation. In fact, in the laboratory, the way we measure carbon dioxide is by its infrared absorption properties. It absorbs heat coming from the surface, acting like a thermal blanket. That is not a controversy. We can look at our neighboring Venus and look at its atmosphere which is almost 100 times thicker and composed almost entirely of carbon dioxide. It is 460 C at the surface mostly because of carbon dioxide. The question is: What is a smaller increase in carbon dioxide going to do on the Earth? We have a variety of information about this. We have models, and I think the Chairman has referred to some of the uncertainty in these models. I actually share those concerns about these climate models. Climate models are the best physics, the best observations we have from the last 100 years of observations. We take those models and the best physics we can, incorporate them into a physical model, a computer model that we then try to use to predict the future. But try to understand it this way, that the carbon dioxide levels today are higher than they have ever been in human history, higher than they have been probably for 30 or 40 million years of Earth history. What that means is it is unreasonable to expect scientists like me to predict exactly what is going to happen when we are taking the Earth into a state that we haven't seen for 30 million years. The expectation that we will be able to predict exactly what is going to happen is unreasonable. I will say this though; I look at Earth history and try to use climate variations in the past to estimate how sensitive the Earth is to changes in carbon dioxide, and the general rule that I see is that the Earth is always more sensitive than the models whether you are talking about the difference between the last Ice Age and today, and that is Figure 3 here. If you look at Figure 3, the Northern Hemisphere, when most of North America was covered with ice, where I live in Boston, it was covered with a mile of ice, a very different world. The average temperature difference was 5 C for the whole world. We are talking about 3 to 5 C warming this century potentially. That is what some of the models say if we double or triple atmospheric CO2 this century. Exactly how this will affect our climate? Very difficult to say, but there is no question that it will be dramatic and significant. To me, we can look warm climates 40 or 50 million years ago when crocodiles lived up in Greenland, when there were palm trees in Wyoming, sea level was 300 feet higher because there was no ice anywhere on the planet, a very warm world. We think CO2 levels were something like two to four times higher than today, a very different world. We are not going to get back to that world in a hundred years--it takes longer for that for the ice to melt--but we are heading that direction. We are returning the atmosphere to a state it hasn't been in since that time. It is an experiment on the planet. That is the way I think is the right framing of this problem. We are doing an experiment on the planet. It is uncontrolled. We don't know exactly what is going to happen. The question is, it is an insurance question, how much are we going to risk? What is it worth to us? What is the cost of fixing this problem relative to the possibility that we will really do something bad? Senator Inhofe. Dr. Schrag, will you please wind up now in fairness to the other witnesses? Mr. Schrag. Yes, I will wind up right now, absolutely. I think the framing of this as an insurance problem is important. Ultimately, we don't buy insurance because we know our house is going to burn down. We do it because we can't afford it if it did burn down. What it comes down to then is: What is the cost of the premium? What does it cost to fix the problem? I think we heard Senator Bond earlier talk about 1 percent or 4 percent of GDP. I think recently there have been estimates that are much lower than that, 0.4 to 1 percent. The point is that it is actually relatively affordable. As Senator Boxer said, there are actually issues. There are many ways this will actually help our economy and help our national security. Senator Bond was exactly correct in asking how is this going to affect poor people. How is this going to affect different States? There are solutions, for example, for Ohio which depends heavily on coal. Senator Inhofe. OK, Dr. Schrag, thank you very much. Mr. Schrag. Thank you. Senator Inhofe. Dr. Carter coming all the way from the other side of the world, thank you very much. STATEMENT OF R.M. CARTER, Ph.D., MARINE GEOPHYSICAL LABORATORY, JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY, AUSTRALIA Mr. Carter. Mr. Chairman, Senators, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for the invitation to speak to you. I am aware, coming from a long way away, of the privilege that it represents. I am particularly pleased to meet Senator Boxer for the first time because, unbeknownst to her, we have something in common, and that is a brother-in-law of mine who lives in her electorate. So I just stopped there briefly on the way to Washington, and I wonder why you spend time in Washington rather than that lovely part of California? Climate change is a complex thing, and human-caused climate change is even more complex. It is important at the outset to appreciate there is no theory of climate in the sense that there is a sense of gravity, a Newtonian theory of gravity, for example. I like to look at it this way; there are three realities of climate change. The first reality is the reality that Dr. Schrag has just been speaking about, the science reality, and it is based upon facts and experiment and empirical testing. The second reality is virtual reality, and you have a very distinguished practitioner of it in the States, Dr. Jim Hansen, and many colleagues who spend their time devising computer models that are so mind-bogglingly complex that ordinary scientists like me can't begin to penetrate them. But the important thing to understand is that they do not produce predictions of future climate. They are virtual realities. They produce imaginary worlds. We learn a huge amount from them, but we do not gain predictions from them. The third reality is the cause of this hearing, mostly behind me but some gentlemen in front of me, the press. It is the public opinion, the general common view of climate change. Now those three realities are very different things and two of them are in complete conflict. The two are the science reality where there is vigorous debate as indeed there should be in any mature science or young science, I should say. There is vigorous debate on virtually every aspect of climate change. Yet, in the public arena now, it has become a political issue which is a done deal. Everybody knows the planet is overheating, and we have got to save it. How did that come about? How is it possible for there to be such a disjunct between the public understanding and the scientific situation? The answer to that has to be the press because the press carry the privilege of informing the public and informing them on climate change. The three players that they should be paying attention to are the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC; the non-governmental organizations with an environmental bent like Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund; and individual scientists like Dr. Schrag and others. They are the three big sets of voices. So the press' job then, is to translate what it hears from those people out to the public. The press is failing, and let me tell you why. They are failing to translate the uncertainty of the science. There is huge uncertainty in every aspect of climate science. The second thing they are failing to do is they are not transmitting many essential facts and especially facts that are relevant to the human influence. Let me give you two because I only have time for two. The first is that if you look at the ice core evidence, you will discover that yes, changes in carbon dioxide are accompanied by changes in temperature, but you will also discover that the change in temperature precedes the change in carbon dioxide by several hundred years to a thousand or so years. Reflect on that and reflect when you last heard somebody say that they thought lung cancer caused smoking, because that is what you are arguing if you argue on the glacial time scale that changes in carbon dioxide cause temperature changes. It is the other way around. The second example is--it will come as a surprise to some people in this room--using the official statistics of the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia, which are the statistics that the IPCC use, there has been no increase in global temperature for the last 7 years. Since 1998, global average temperature has remained unchanged, yet over those 7 years, carbon dioxide has been continuing its spiral upwards. Other things that the press do, briefly, and they are detailed more in my paper to the committee, are they make a great deal of alarmist stories about climate change. We all understand why; it sells newspapers. They play the man and the women, not the ball. It is not the science that gets discussed. It is the motivation or who is paying for the science. They use what I call couldism, mightism, and perhapsism. Droughts could go up; we might get more storms; and perhaps sea level is going to rise. They substitute he says/she says type of coverage for assessing complex scientific issues where there are not just two sides to the argument. There are multiple sides to the argument. But a reporter is trained from being knee-high, as far as I can tell, that the way you produce balanced coverage is to get a spokesman on the one hand and a spokesman on the other hand. Climate science is hugely more complicated than that. It requires the reporter to be able to make some judgments of his or her own. Finally, why am I concerned that this public hysteria--I agree with my colleague, Dr. Deming, on this--on climate change is such a problem? The reason it is a problem is it is diverting our attention from what is a real climate problem, and that is natural climate change, not human-caused climate change. Every experienced person who studies climate over the long haul understands rapid climate changes and especially coolings, can happen in a matter of a few years to a few decades. We do not understand what causes them. We do understand that a rapid cooling is going to be economically far more damaging than a gradual warming. Therefore, any policy should be based on adaptation to climate change, not on trying to prevent it. Trying to mitigate natural climate change is an exercise in utter futility. You might as well try to stop the clouds scudding across the sky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Dr. Carter. Thank you very much. Dr. Oreskes. STATEMENT OF NAOMI ORESKES, PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY AND PROGRAM IN SCIENCE STUDIES, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO Ms. Oreskes. Thank you very much. It is an honor to have the opportunity to speak to you today about the history of climate history. I am a professor of history at the University of California, San Diego where I teach and do research on the history of modern science. I hold a Bachelor's of Science in mining geology from the Royal School of Mines, part of the University of London, and a Ph.D., from Stanford University where I completed a graduate special program in geological research and the history of science. In recent months, the suggestion has been made that concern over anthropogenic global warming is just a fad or a fashion. The history of science clearly shows otherwise. Scientific attention to global warming has lasted over a century, has involved thousands of scientists, and extended across six continents. It has spanned the disciplines of physics, chemistry, meteorology, and oceanography, and included some of the most illustrious and trusted scientists of the 20th Century, and it has included scientific advisors to numerous U.S. Presidents, both Democratic and Republican. Let me explain. Scientists have been studying carbon dioxide and climate for a long time. John Tyndall first established in 1859 that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. From this, the great Swedish geochemist Svante Arhenius deduced in the 1890s that carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels could alter Earth's climate. By the 1930s, British engineer Guy Callendar had compiled empirical evidence that this effect was already discernible. Callendar's concern was pursued in the United States in the 1950s by the great American physicist Gilbert Plass, a pioneer in upper atmosphere spectroscopy; by geochemist Hans Suess, a pioneer of radiocarbon dating who worked closely with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission; and by the great oceanographer Roger Revelle, a one-time commander in the U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office. By the 1960s, Charles David Keeling's systematic measurements demonstrated conclusively that atmospheric CO2 was indeed rising, work for which he was awarded the National Medal of Science by the Bush administration in 2002. These basic facts of history are well documented, but what is less well known is that by the mid-1960s, a number of scientific advisory panels had expressed concern about global warming, and this concern was communicated by some of America's most illustrious scientists to Presidents Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Jimmy Carter. One early warning came in 1965 from the Environmental Pollution Board of the President's Science Advisory Committee, which warned that by the year 2000, ``There will be about 25 percent more CO2 in our atmosphere than at present and this will modify the heat balance of the atmosphere to such an extent that marked changes in climate could occur.'' Accordingly, President Lyndon Johnson stated in a special message to Congress: ``This generation has altered the composition of the atmosphere on a global scale through a steady increase in carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.'' A second warning came in 1966 from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences Panel on Climate and Weather Modification head by geophysicist Gordon MacDonald, who later served on Richard Nixon's Council on Environmental Quality. In the wake of the Arab oil embargo, Alvin Weinberg, the director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, realized that climatological impacts might limit oil production before geology did. In 1979, the subject was addressed by the JASON Committee, the reclusive group of highly cleared scientists who gather annually to evaluate scientific and technical problems for the U.S. Government and whose members have included some of the most brilliant scientists of our era, including physics Nobel Laureates Hans Bethe and Murray Gell-Mann. The JASON scientists predicted that atmospheric carbon dioxide might double by the year 2035, resulting in mean global temperature increases of 2 to 3 C and polar warming of as much as 10 to 12 C. This report also reached the White House where Frank Press, Science Advisor to President Carter, asked the National Academy of Sciences for a second opinion. An Academy Committee headed by MIT meteorologist Jule Charney affirmed the JASON conclusion: ``If carbon dioxide continues to increase, we find no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible.'' It was precisely these concerns that led in 1992 to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change which called for immediate action to reverse the trend of mounting greenhouse gas emissions. One early signatory was U.S. President George H.W. Bush who called on world leaders to translate the written document into ``concrete action to protect the planet.'' Three months later, the Convention was unanimously ratified by the U.S. Senate. Since then, scientists around the world have worked assiduously to flesh out the details of this broadly affirmed picture. The purpose of my 2004 study of the scientific literature, published in the peer-reviewed journal, Science, was to assess how much disagreement remained in the scientific community about the basic reality of global warming and its human causes. The answer surprised me. Not one scientific paper in the sample disagreed with the consensus position. Scientists, my study showed, are still arguing about the details, but the overall picture is clear. There is a consensus among both the leaders of climate science and the rank and file of active climate researchers. Now I should acknowledge that one skeptic has challenged my study and others have repeated his claim. This man is a social anthropologist in Liverpool who, to my knowledge, has never published his arguments regarding my study in a peer-reviewed journal. This past October, he admitted that he had made significant mistakes in his criticisms, and he now agrees with my general conclusion about the state of climate science. In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Commission, he acknowledged, ``I do not think that anyone is questioning that we are in a period of global warming. Neither do I doubt that the overwhelming majority of climatologists is agreed that the current warming period is mostly due to human impact.'' The scientific evidence is clear: The predictions made decades ago by Arrhenius, Callendar, Plass, Suess, Revelle, Charney, MacDonald, Weinberg, White, the JASON Committee, and many others have come true. I thank you very, very much for your time. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Dr. Oreskes. Mr. Gainor. DAN GAINOR, THE BOONE PICKENS FREE MARKET FELLOW, DIRECTOR, BUSINESS & MEDIA INSTITUTE Mr. Gainor. Thank you, Chairman Inhofe, Senators, and ladies and gentlemen. We are here to discuss the media coverage of the climate change debate, but there is only one problem; there is almost none of that debate actually in the media. Journalists who pledged to be neutral long ago gave up their watchdog roles to become lapdogs for one position. The media became alarmist, claiming the planet is at a tipping point as if at any moment everything would go over the edge. An April 2006 issue of Time Magazine pushed readers over that edge with 24 pages of advocacy, claiming, ``The debate is over. Global warming is upon us with a vengeance.'' CBS's Scott Pelley, who covers the environment, actually compared climate change skeptics with Holocaust deniers and claimed, ``There becomes a point in journalism where striving for balance becomes irresponsible.'' In an effort to provide balance to that irresponsible comment, let us recall the media's record on climate change. Reporters told us roughly 30 years ago that a similar fate awaited mankind. Then, journalists were convinced we would all freeze to death. In an April 1975 article entitled The Cooling World, Newsweek advised us that ``the Earth's climate seems to be cooling down.'' A May 1975 New York Times piece cautioned, ``Scientists Ponder Why World's Climate Is Changing: A Major Cooling Widely Considered to be Inevitable.'' The Washington Post, U.S. News and World Report, and Science News all chimed in that cool was suddenly very hot. One award-winning piece in Fortune said if the trend continued, it could ``affect the whole human occupation of the Earth.'' The irony of this scare is that just years before, we had been warned the Earth was warming. In March 1929, the Los Angeles Times told readers, ``Most geologists think the world is growing warmer and that it will continue to get warmer.'' The New York Times took a similar approach with a headline that said, ``America in Longest Warm Spell Since 1776.'' And less than 10 years before that, the Times detailed the exploits of Captain Donald MacMillan's Arctic expedition and how ``MacMillan Reports Signs of New Ice Age.'' In more than 100 years, the major media have warned us of at least four separate climate cataclysms: an ice age, warming, another ice age, and another bout of warming. If you count the current catch-all term of climate change, that would be five separate media predictions. Even by their count, they are 0 for 3. The hubris that convinces supposedly unbiased journalists they are providing the truth on climate change has led them to criticize America for its stance on the issue including the Kyoto Treaty, but they typically leave out the 95 to nothing vote against Kyoto by this very Senate or the many billions of dollars such an agreement would cost America. This attitude has resulted in a media obsession with Al Gore's film, An Inconvenient Truth. At least 75 TV shows covered Gore or the film in just 3 months this summer, more than three and a half times the length of the movie. The Today Show's Matt Lauer even lent his status to a SciFi Network program that listed global warming among other potential threats to our species, including asteroids, aliens, and evil robots. Scientists who dare question the almost religious belief in climate change--and yes, they do exist--are ignored or undermined in news reports as are policymakers and pundits who take similar views. The few journalists who sometimes give another side, like the New York Times' Andrew Revkin, emphasize funding sources for that side of the debate and rarely bother to question the billions of dollars that go into promoting global warming. This goes against the basic tenets of journalism to be skeptical of all sides of an issue. It also violates the ethical code of the Society of Professional Journalists which urges the media to ``support open exchange of views, even views they find repugnant.'' That code calls for reporters to ``distinguish between advocacy and news reporting.'' But that wasn't the media response when Chairman Inhofe read some of our report, Fire and Ice, on the Senate floor in September. Newsweek responded with a roughly 1,000 word clarification of its 1975 global cooling report but added it made this mistake as recently as 1992. Newsweek still claimed ``the story wasn't `wrong' in the journalistic sense of `inaccurate.' '' But at least it owned up to the error after 31 years. In the New York Times editorial that responded to Senator Inhofe's comments, the Times summarized, ``Cooling, warming, we never get right.'' That is the inconvenient truth. Thank you. Senator Inhofe. Thank you very much for the excellent statement. Without objection, I am going to enter into the record, Dr. Carter, a paper that you wrote called Human-Caused Global Warming because I find it to be very interesting as a supplement to your testimony. In order to accommodate Senator Boxer, we are going to expand the time for questioning. We will have a first round of 7 minutes and then we will have a round after that of 5 minutes. We are going to try our best, though, to conclude it in 1 hour from now because we have other uses for the room. Let me start off with the University of Oklahoma which shouldn't surprise too many people. I would like to have you, Dr. Deming, just repeat and just take a second to do it what you said about your call from the NPR to make sure everybody understands it. Mr. Deming. It was the week that my paper in the journal Science, had been published. I came into my office. There was a voice mail there from a reporter from National Public Radio. He said he wanted to talk to me about the paper, and I called him back, very excited. I thought I am going to be on the radio, and it is going to be wonderful, and it will help my career, and I will get all sorts of favorable publicity, and blah, blah, blah. I called him back, and to my surprise, he focused on the very last sentence in my paper where I said, I made the statement I thought was remarkably uncontroversial. I said the amount of warming that we have observed is within the range of natural variability for the last 10,000 years, and it is impossible to say at this point in time if it is due to human activity or a natural variation. And he said, did you really mean to say that? I said, well, of course, I did because I say what I mean. He said, well. He said, then I guess we have no story. He said, because if you had said it was due to human activity, that is what everyone is interested in. Then he hung up on me. Senator Inhofe. That is one of the problems that we have that is very serious. You also mentioned and as I said in my opening statement, 4 years ago when I became Chairman of this committee, I assumed that it was anthropogenic gases that were causing this because that was all I had seen in the media since IPCC came out and, of course, Michael Mann was the one you heard from more than anything else. When we started looking at the science, you commented on the hockey stick. Isn't it true that if he had been honest in his portrayal, using a hockey stick for the blades charted at the 20th Century and included Medieval Warming Period, that it would have two blades of approximately the same size? Mr. Deming. As I understand the hockey stick, that period of time, the medieval time period is included, but the result they get is different from virtually almost what everyone else has found, and it has subsequently been criticized for having the result as an artifact of the methodology. As I understand the hockey stick, it is based primarily on tree ring thicknesses which are probably one of the most problematical indicators we have of past temperatures. The area in which I am most familiar, borehole temperatures clearly indicate that there has been a Medieval Warm Period and also that---- Senator Inhofe. And a Little Ice Age, and I think also history, which Dr. Oreskes may want to address. Mr. Deming [continuing]. Polar sea maximum when temperatures were even warmer than the Medieval Warm Period about 5,000 years ago. Since that time, which used to be called, by the way, the Climatic Optimum. Before the warming scare, it used to be commonly acknowledged that warm temperatures are beneficial and cold temperatures are detrimental. Since that time, temperature, of course, has been undergoing variation, but it has been more or less systematically declining. Senator Inhofe. Thank you very much. Dr. Schrag, I think the only criticism I would have of your presentation is you said it is unfortunate that it has become very political and yet you have made appearance after appearance with Al Gore. I mean Al Gore clearly believes that global warming is his ticket to the White House. You appeared at the premiere of The Day After Tomorrow with not just Al Gore but also have made appearance with MoveOn.org and many of these highly political groups. If it is unfortunate that it has become political, why are you participating in those politics? Cut it short now. Mr. Schrag. Yes, in the discussion of the movie, The Day After Tomorrow, I felt the movie was so distorted in terms of its climate science, that I welcomed any opportunity to try to explain to the public what was fact and what was fiction. I think if you actually see my comments on that film, you will agree with that. I welcome the opportunity to appear in any Republican or Democratic forum on this, and I do that regularly at Harvard, briefing. Senator Inhofe. I appreciate that very much. I would like to have you, for the record, give me some of these comments on the science. My staff should have done this, and I should have been aware of it, but I would like to see some of the comments that you made concerned the flawed science of that movie. Mr. Schrag. Yes, well, the movie was really preposterous, essentially. The movie suggested that warming would lead to a shutdown of the thermohaline circulation which is actually possible. That part of it was correct. However, it happened in 3 days, and it resulted in a global ice age. In fact, a shutdown of the thermohaline circulation would have a minor effect on temperatures, probably only in the coastal regions of Northern Europe, and it might only mitigate future warming. It might reduce the impact of future warming. It certainly wouldn't cause a cooling. I would actually suggest that this is one example where certain climate scientists have probably, in my view, this is an unlikely thing to occur. Senator Inhofe. Thank you very much, very much. Dr. Carter, I have been a vocal critic of the IPCC for some time, and I actually dedicated one whole 1-hour speech on the floor of the Senate that I am sure no one listened to about the IPCC. Can you tell me your views about the IPCC's credibility and how it can be improved or lack of credibility? Mr. Carter. Well, of course, the IPCC started off with great hopes and intentions like most offshore bodies. The problem is today that after it has been going I guess for 15 years or so, it is basically unaccountable to anybody. The sovereign governments that receive its assessment reports use those assessment reports for their own climate policy. You could reflect on the thought of a sovereign government using an international body to set its next budget. I don't know why it is the governments have decided in this area of the environment that they defer to international advice where in every other part of their national management, of course, they use their own judgment. There is a lot of very good science in the IPCC volumes, but that is in the volumes. The problem is, as you, I am sure, heard many people say, it is the summary for policymakers. Senator Inhofe. It is the summary, the political summary. Mr. Carter. That is a political document, but that is all that most governments use in setting policy. Lord Lawson, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer in the United Kingdom, his view on this is that you should just shut the IPCC down. I would like to agree with him, but politically that is clearly not feasible. So I think you have to do something to make them accountable. I think AP-6, the Asia-Pacific Climate Accord, is the way to go. It is going to have to receive scientific and technical advice. It won't want to set up its own bodies because it is cumbersome and expensive and so on to provide that advice, but it will need an audit body of some sort. I think the IPCC could well contribute to AP-6 advice on climate change, but that then needs to be thoroughly audited by a group of independent scientists and engineers. Senator Inhofe. Thank you very much. Senator Boxer, this first round is going to be an 8-minute round, not a 7-minute round. Professor Oreskes, you have spoken about consensus about climate change, so I want to make sure that I understand what you mean. Is the definition of consensus that No. 1, the globe is warming and No. 2, that man's activities have contributed to that? Ms. Oreskes. Correct. Senator Inhofe. All right, I would like to be invited to be part of your consensus because I have said this and I have acknowledged that we are in a period where there has been warming now, as it was pointed out by Dr. Carter, not really since 1998 but generally a warming period. I have said many times that there are human contributions to this such as the expanded cities, the land use policies, the agriculture, the heat island effect. These things do have an effect. I understand that. My only concern has been CO2 specifically. Now I am going to stop right here and wait for the next round of questions in deference to my future Chairman. I want to make sure we get everything covered. Senator Boxer, 8 minutes. Senator Boxer. Eight minutes, thank you very much. A couple of comments, Senator Voinovich, I was very moved by what you said about working together and recognizing China is a threat, and I think I agree with Senator Lautenberg's remarks that the best way to engage other nations is to become a role model and at the same time pulling them along. I hope in the Foreign Relations Committee, maybe we can team up and do some work in reaching out to China because clearly China is going to surpass us in 2009 as the largest emitter of carbon dioxide. I think that is key, and I thank you for bringing it up. I also think attacking the press doesn't make the truth go away. So you can attack and flail away, but it doesn't work. A lot of politicians and their death rattles turn against the press. It doesn't work at the end of the day. It can be certainly frustrating, but at the end of the day, it is a free press that keeps us strong. I also think attacking individuals for speaking out at forums is anti-democratic, and I just feel that way, regardless of what forum. That is what differentiates us from others. We don't say to people you can't have an opinion, regardless of what your profession is. I encourage all my people at home, Dr. Carter, and maybe you do too, and I encourage your brother, however he feels on this subject, to speak out, to go to forums to be educated and lead. Since you, Dan Gainor, you put up the Times, let me put up a series of mainstream press. I want to show you this. I am going to ask Dr. Schrag, because I asked you before if you would read these articles, to comment on whether you think there is anything in these articles that is hysterical, as my Chairman says, hysterical. The first one is the Tulsa World. We go to Oklahoma, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I think you would be interested. Tulsa World, September 26, 2006: Global Warming Reaching Record: Earth's Temperature Highest in Millennia. Researchers say Earth's temperature has climbed to levels not seen in thousands of years; and warming has begun to affect plants, animals, researchers report in Tuesday's issue of proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences. So that is one. Let us go quickly with these because we have 8 minutes and eight charts. OK, here we go. Business Week, not your liberal bastion of a magazine: Global Warming Consensus Growing Among Scientists, Governments, Business. We must act fast to combat climate change. This has already sparked efforts to limit CO2 emissions. Many companies are now preparing for a carbon-constrained world. They cite a Pentagon report that tells of a plausible scenario in which the conveyor shuts off. They also quote Senator McCain as saying: The facts are there. We have to educate our fellow citizens about climate change. Let us go to the next one. This is the L.A. Times: Academies Warn of Warming. Science organizations from 11 countries including the United States call for global action against the changing climate. It goes on to explain that. Let us go to the next one. Washington Post: Growing Activity of Oceans. This is important because Dr. Deming made a very important point that the oceans are our friend and they sequester the carbon dioxide. But look what is happening to the oceans: Growing acidity of oceans may kill corals. That is quoted also from a report from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and that is the Bush administration. Let us go to the next one. This is the Financial Times: No Need to Become a Sitting Duck; Hurricane Zones: Businesses Can and Should Plan for Events Outside Their Control. Even the U.S. Pentagon says climate change should be elevated beyond a scientific debate to a national security concern. That is the Pentagon. That is the Bush administration, the current Administration. This is the New York Times: Yelling Fire on a Hot Planet. Between the poles of real time catastrophe and non-event lies the prevailing scientific view. Let me repeat that. The New York Times: Between the poles o"
