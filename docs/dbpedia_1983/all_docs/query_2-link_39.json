        "text": "This FAQ was updated on November 23, 2018.\n\n______\n\nThe New York Times is in Australia — we opened a new bureau in Sydney on May 1, 2017.\n\nWhy, and what are we offering readers?\n\nOur project is always evolving (like a start-up) and this page is meant to help explain what we’re up to.\n\nIf you have something I don’t address here, feel free to email nytaustralia@nytimes.com or bring your inquiry to our subscriber Facebook group.\n\nYou can also follow our efforts by signing up for my weekly newsletter, Australia Letter, and by checking our Australia page for a running tally of our coverage. (Or of course, you could just subscribe; it’s worth it, we promise!)\n\nNow for some questions and answers.\n\nWhy are you here?\n\nThe New York Times is expanding globally and Australia has become a priority for two reasons: because we have a significant number of digital subscribers in the country; and because Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific all offer a rich vein of reporting in a part of the world that is increasingly important.\n\nHow do you choose what to cover?\n\nWe have around a half-dozen journalists roaming Australia and its closest neighbors, and we aim to do many things at once: Cover the news with context; deepen Australia’s understanding of itself and the world; and provide a bit of surprise and delight.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
