        "text": "One of Australia’s top television journalists has opened a bout of national soul-searching by quitting his show over the racist abuse he faces as an Indigenous man in the spotlight.\n\nAn award-winning journalist with the ABC, Stan Grant said the national broadcaster had lodged a complaint with Twitter about the “relentless racial filth” he endured.\n\nBut he added the media itself “lie and distort my words” and depicted him as “hate-filled” after he raised Britain’s colonial persecution of Indigenous Australians during the ABC’s coverage of King Charles III’s coronation.\n\n“I pointed out that the crown represents the invasion and theft of our land,” Grant said in an article published Friday on ABC’s website.\n\n“Police wearing the seal of the crown took children from their families. Under the crown our people were massacred.”\n\nHis coronation commentary was heavily criticised as being one-sided and inappropriate by some conservative media.\n\nGrant said he spoke out of love for Australia because he needed to tell the truth that Indigenous people still have the highest rates of imprisonment and poverty.\n\nThe 59-year-old announced he would walk away as a presenter after the next episode of the ABC’s Q+A current affairs discussion programme on Monday.\n\n‘Toxicity around race’\n\nGrant took his own employer to task.\n\n“I am writing this because no one at the ABC – whose producers invited me onto their coronation coverage as a guest – has uttered one word of public support. Not one ABC executive has publicly refuted the lies written or spoken about me,” he said.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese offered his support to Grant telling journalists: “You can have respect for different views without engaging in vilification.”\n\nABC news director Justin Stevens also issued a statement backing Grant, saying he faced “grotesque racial abuse, including threats to his safety”.\n\nOsman Faruqi, culture news editor for The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald, who previously worked at the ABC, said staffing at the national broadcaster was not representative of the cultural mix of Australia.\n\nBut the issue went further than the national broadcaster, he said in an opinion piece on Saturday.\n\n“It’s also bigger than the media. There is a toxicity around race that resides deep within this country, infecting all of our institutions – the media, sport, arts, business and politics,” Faruqi said.\n\nIn his departure announcement, Grant said Indigenous people had learned to “tough it out”.\n\nBut the stakes are now higher, he said, as the country prepares for a referendum this year on whether to give Indigenous people the constitutional right to be consulted about laws that affect them.\n\n“There is a referendum on an Indigenous Voice to Parliament and I am not alone in feeling judged. This is an Australian judgment on us. Such is politics,” Grant wrote. “But racism is a crime. Racism is violence. And I have had enough.”"
