        "text": "Intel’s 11th-gen Rocket Lake chip won’t hit shelves until the end of March, but an unexpectedly early review of a retail Core i7-11700K labels the chip as power-hungry and unable to surpass AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800X in many tests. The review, written by respected CPU expert Dr. Ian Cutress of Anandtech.com, was based on a Core i7-11700K that is presumably one of the hundreds of CPUs accidentally sold a month before launch by a German retailer. Benchmarks of the chip have been making the rounds ever since, but Cutress is the first experienced journalist to publish a review. Cutress stepped carefully in his story, avoiding mention of any information he had already been given by Intel under embargo during regular briefings for the chip. He said he informed Intel that he had the…\n\nWhen Prince Harry returned to the U.K. in May to celebrate the 10th anniversary of one of his proudest achievements, the Invictus Games, his father, King Charles, was notably absent from the ceremony at St. Paul’s Cathedral. Just a few miles away, Charles was hosting a garden party at Buckingham Palace. Not only did the King, 75, skip the ceremony, but he also didn’t see his youngest son during his visit. Initially, Harry’s spokesperson cited the King’s “full” schedule as the reason for their missed meeting, but sources close to Harry, 39, suggest a deeper issue. Harry wanted to discuss his ongoing battle for security, which he has been fighting for in court for more than four years and believes Charles has the power to reinstate. (Buckingham Palace will not…\n\nWhat happened Fears of an all-out war in the Middle East were heightened this week when a surprise rocket strike on Tehran killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh—an assassination Iran blamed on Israel. Haniyeh, the highest-profile Hamas leader to be killed since the terrorist group’s Oct. 7 ambush on Israel, was visiting the Iranian capital to attend the inauguration of the country’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian. Israel did not immediately claim responsibility for the death of the 62-year-old leader but has a record of carrying out assassinations beyond its borders, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned after the Oct. 7 attack that “every Hamas leader is a dead man.” Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to “avenge [Haniyeh’s] blood,” adding that Israel has “prepared a harsh punishment for itself.” Haniyeh’s assassination…\n\nSouthport, U.K. Murder and riots: Far-right protesters attacked a mosque, set fire to cars, and fought with police in Southport this week, a day after three young girls were killed and five other children critically wounded in a stabbing attack on a Taylor Swift–themed dance workshop in the town. The riots were seemingly sparked by online disinformation about the identity of the 17-year-old suspect arrested for the stabbing spree. Police said a name being circulated online was incorrect. More than 50 police were wounded in the clashes with several hundred rioters, who included supporters of the far-right English Defence League. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the rioters “hijacked” a peaceful vigil for the young victims—ages 6, 7, and 9—and had “insulted the community as it grieves.” Ottawa Broken treaties: Canada’s supreme court paved…\n\nGrowing up in the 1990s, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen were undisputed pop culture royalty. Getting their start on Full House when they were just 9 months old, America immediately fell in love with the twins who starred as the adorably sassy Michelle Tanner on the hit sitcom for eight seasons. From there, the sisters went on to dominate the straight-to-VHS market, their smiling faces and iconic tween style (Tankinis! Butterfly clips!) enough to sell even the most outrageous plotline. They were named the youngest self-made millionaires in history by the time they were 10, and in 2004, they launched their Walmart collection of clothes and accessories, which raked in an estimated $700 million in sales thanks to millennials who either wanted to befriend them or be them. By the mid-aughts, the…\n\nOn July 2, Christina Hall sat down with Us to discuss the new season of her show Christina on the Coast. During the interview, the HGTV star talked about her nearly three-year marriage to Josh Hall, explaining that they make time for date nights and had plans to go out to dinner for her birthday on July 9. But when the topic turned to the pair’s upcoming series, The Flip Off (which costars her ex-husband Tarek El Moussa and his wife, Heather Rae El Moussa), there were undeniable hints of tension. “It’s never easy to work with a spouse,” Christina said. “It’s a whole new dynamic for us, and it’s going to be interesting how it plays out.” Interesting, indeed. Two weeks later, on July 15, the pair filed for divorce,…\n\nNew perspective takes time, and Josh Hartnett has found it. “I don’t mind getting older,” he says two days after his 46th birthday. “The passage of time these days feels a little bit daunting, how quickly it’s going. But age is a privilege. You always have to remember that.” The star’s approach to fame is different from the days when he felt trapped by his heartthrob label. After his big-screen debut as Jamie Lee Curtis’s son in 1998’s Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, Hartnett landed roles in movies like The Virgin Suicides, Pearl Harbor and Black Hawk Down. At the time, though, the actor from Minnesota wanted to be seen as more than a Tiger Beat pinup. “I was frustrated,” he recalls. “I didn’t want to be defined by other…\n\nTo date, PC vendors have shipped AI PCs. On Monday, Microsoft announced the next step in the AI PC’s evolution, the Copilot+ PC, and announced AI-powered Windows 11 features like Recall. “The pursuit has always been about how to build computers that understand us, instead of having us having to understand computers, and I feel like we really are close to that breakthrough,” said Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, in a briefing with reporters on Microsoft’s campus. A Copilot+ PC combines local, on-device AI with cloud AI, according to Microsoft, to provide a range of services. Some of the new laptops shipping with the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors will be classified as Copilot+ PCs, taking advantage of the NPU found within both chips. That NPU will power…\n\nShe’s With the Band Philadelphia, July 3 “It’s always an honor to share the stage with such talented musicians, but ones that have also served our country… this was special,” LeAnn Rimes said of performing with the United States Army Field Band at the Salute to Service.

Blues, no less—Dan Aykroyd has two parting words: “Stay cool.” But it’s the writer-performer who has done as much in his 72 years, delighting audiences with his roles in iconic TV shows and movies from Saturday Night Live and My Girl to Ghostbusters and Driving Miss Daisy. “I’ve had a beautiful run—I’m grateful for all of it,” says the Ottawa native. That theme carries through his new project, the Audible Original audio documentary Blues Brothers: The Arc of Gratitude, which brings together members of the cast and crew for an oral history of the classic 1980 film and the SNL sketch that launched it. “I hope people take away the emotion of…\n\nTECH COMPANIES love launching new products at trade shows, and at this year’s Computex, AMD treated us to a major chip announcement: the first Zen 5 processors. There are six new Zen 5 processors, four desktop versions, and two mobile, codenamed Granite Ridge and Strix Point. Zen 5 architecture offers, according to AMD, an IPC (Instructions Per Clock) gain of 16 percent over Zen 4, which, as generational IPC bumps go, is about average for a change of Zen architecture. There had been some speculative rumors about a higher IPC than this, with 30 percent touted. This would have been amazing, but proved spurious. As it is, the bump is enough to allow AMD to offers “the fastest consumer desktop performance in the world”, as CEO Lisa Su proclaimed from…\n\nApple has updated the iPad Pro for 2024 at an event that Apple CEO Tim Cook described as the “biggest day for iPad.” The new iPad Pro comes in two sizes, 11 inch and 13 inch, and it features the M4 chip, better display technology, and much more.

Hopping on the psyllium bandwagon is an easy fix. “Just add a scoop of psyllium to water and drink it,” suggests Gut Check author Steven R. Gundry, M.D. Both a tablespoon of whole psyllium husks (the most fiber-rich part of the plant) and a teaspoon of powdered husks deliver 7 grams of fiber. Impressive, right? And while all types of fiber offer benefits, psyllium stands out. One study found that if more of us took psyllium—which prompts the liver to eliminate cholesterol—we’d cut healthcare costs by $870 million a year. Researchers also identified psyllium as the only fiber supplement to improve cholesterol, blood sugar, digestion, blood pressure…\n\nThe consensus about the new iPad Pro (see page 52) is in: The hardware is more powerful and impressive than ever, but it’s still largely hampered by software that just hasn’t managed to keep up. Such has been the story of the iPad Pro almost since its inception almost nine years ago, and despite moves that would seem to augur good things for the platform—like forking iPadOS off from iOS—Apple hasn’t exactly done a bang-up job of assuaging users about its commitment to making the tablet a full-fledged citizen of its lineup. But zooming out, there’s a larger question at play here: What are the long-term prospects of the iPad? Once heralded the future of computing, the iPad seems to have fallen short of that promise, and in the process has…\n\nAt its Build 2024 conference, Microsoft unveiled a new AI trick for Windows PCs—one that can help users locate or remember details from their digital past. It could be looking for a PDF file worked on a couple of weeks ago. Or perhaps finding the name of a restaurant recommended by a friend earlier this year. Called Microsoft Recall, this feature could save you many lost minutes trying to hunt down whatever’s eluding your memory. Yet even before its launch, Microsoft Recall is already giving security experts indigestion. Underneath the futuristic shine, Recall comes with a potential massive hit to user privacy—and by extension, security. Here are the reasons for the unease—and what you should do when you actually encounter Microsoft Recall in the wild. 1. IT WATCHES AND RECORDS EVERYTHING YOU…\n\n> Fix server problems > Extend movie files > OEM license Server teething troubles I followed your feature on building a new server, but decided to install Ubuntu 24.04 LTS instead of Debian, as I know it better, and the new LTS supports Podman 4.9.3. So far, so good, but I’ve run into two annoying problems. The major one is that if I leave the server unattended for a short period, my Nextcloud client reports that the server is disconnected. If I log on to the server through cockpit, the connection is restored, but as soon as I leave the server to its own devices, it disconnects again. The second problem is that I cannot get the server to shut down on a schedule. I’ve edited both user and root…\n\n>1. MACKLIN CELEBRINI BORN June 13, 2006, Vancouver, B.C. 2023-24 Boston University (HE) HT 6-0 WT 190 SHOOTS L POS C CENTRAL SCOUTING No. 1 (NA skaters) THE FACT CELEBRINI was so good so early in the NCAA has talent hawks all aflutter. “Being 17, just that alone is spooky if you think about it,” one scout said. “At the start, he wasn’t blowing by guys like a Paul Kariya, but as the season went on, he started to make plays. He’s more of a cerebral superstar rather than a flashy one. His anticipation of where pucks are going is just different, in a good way.” Celebrini helped BU advance to the Frozen Four semifinal, where they lost to eventual champion Denver. That same weekend, he became the youngest player ever to win the Hobey Baker…\n\nWHEN HE RAN for president in 2004, Democrats were counting on John Kerry’s military service to define him as a strong leader in a time of war. The decorated Vietnam veteran headed into the party’s convention with a small lead over President George W. Bush, who had dodged serving by enlisting in Texas’ Air National Guard. But just a week after Democrats officially nominated Kerry, he was attacked with a brutal and deceptive series of ads from an unexpected quarter: veterans who, like him, had served on swift boats in Vietnam. Kerry’s lead evaporated, and the campaign never recovered, as “Swift Boating” entered the lexicon as shorthand for a dishonest political smear. The man largely responsible for the ads was a Virginia consultant named Chris LaCivita. He’s now co–campaign manager for…\n\nEIGHT BILLION PEOPLE INHABIT PLANET EARTH. Thirty million live in Texas. Residents of the town of Silsbee, just west of the Louisiana state line, number roughly 7,000. Let's estimate, for the sake of argument, that on any given Tuesday evening, 20 of those Silsbee residents are out cutting their grass. Out of all those 20 mowers and 7,000 Silsbee residents and 30 million Texans and 8 billion humans, only one that we know of, 65-year-old Peggy Jones, was unlucky enough to have a living, writhing snake fall out of the sky and onto her. The story only gets weirder. Peggy and her husband, Wendell Jones, were tending a property they own just outside the Silsbee city limits on July 25, 2023. Wendell was out front, weed-eating, while Peggy drove a tractor (Kubota, 26…\n\nBuilding Business Los Angeles, June 26 Selena Gomez rocked a Versace dress to Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where she was interviewed by guest host Martin Short. “You must be in your element — all eyes are on you!” quipped Selena to her Only Murders in the Building costar. Getting Carried Away Los Angeles, June 25 “I have no idea how they got me off the ground!” exclaimed The Bear’s Lionel Boyce after his pals Tyler the Creator, Travis Bennett and Jasper Dolphin gave him a lift at the season 3 premiere. (Lionel, Tyler, Travis and Jasper were all members of the music collective Odd Future.)

It’s nearing lunchtime at Fieri’s 42-acre compound in California’s wine country, a stretch of rolling Steinbeckian earth that is the 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue of Flavortown, U. S.A. Fieri is dressed in a black tee and dripping silver bling as he commands the outdoor kitchen in his backyard. Wood in a Santa Maria grill is kicking up flames. A bulbous brick oven is at full tilt. And Fieri, knife in hand, is hot on this salad. He slivers fennel into white toothpicks. He chops herbs, slices a Fresno chile thin, and cubes Medjool dates. “All the colors! All the flavors! All the textures!” he says in the same near-yell you’ve heard if you’ve watched TV in the past two decades. Next, he rough-cuts grapefruit and orange…\n\n>13. COLE EISERMAN BORN Aug. 29, 2006, Newburyport, Mass. 2023-24 U.S. NTDP HT 6-0 WT 198 SHOOTS L POS LW CENTRAL SCOUTING No. 12 (NA skaters) EISERMAN CAME INTO the year regarded as the odds-on favorite go No. 2 overall, but some evaluators worried about a Captain Ahab-esque focus on breaking the NTDP goals record. “That might have hindered his game,” said one scout. “There’s no backup game right now. He struggles on ‘D,’ and he’s never the first guy back. But if you’re going to have one attribute, scoring is a pretty good one to have.” Which is true. Not only can he score – he did break the all-time NTDP goals mark – but he can do it any way you like. He doesn’t have an ‘office’ like an Alex Ovechkin. He is committed to Boston…\n\nThe cast of Sing Sing, made up largely of formerly incarcerated men, aren’t just telling a remarkable true story—they’re reliving their own. With the exception of Oscar nominees Colman Domingo and Paul Raci, the heart-wrenching drama features alumni of Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA), a thriving organization of theater and other arts program operating in maximum- and medium-security prisons throughout New York State. “I commend my fellow brothers for coming in and crafting a role that’s a version of not only yourself, but other people you’ve witnessed [behind bars],” says actor-producer Domingo, 54, who stars as the charismatic John “Divine G” Whitfield, one of the movie’s creative consultants and a former RTA participant. Clarence “Divine Eye” Maclin, another consultant, served more than 17 years at Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining,…\n\nThey Get Makeovers From Their Kids! When John Legend went on a family vacation with his wife, Chrissy Teigen, and their children, Luna, 8, Miles, 6, Esti, 19 months, and Wren, 13 months, the “Ordinary People” singer got some colorful ink courtesy of a talented (temporary) tattooist. “Back art by Luna Simone,” declared the proud papa as he showed off the floral design. It’s not the first time the EGOT winner’s body has served as a kid-friendly canvas: In 2021, he got an actual tattoo of a bouquet based on a sketch by Luna! How Just Like Us is… JASON BIGGS? The New Jersey native made pop culture history when he got his just desserts in the classic comedy American Pie. Is his off-screen life just as relatably awkward?

Then my head chef calls in sick this morning, and we have a formal dinner tonight. And now there are police all over the place.” “Sorry,” Callaway said. “We’ll try to get out of your way as soon as we can.” The twosome went through a door and down a hallway, stopping at an open door. “There they are,” Lewis said, and he turned and left. In a room, Callaway saw three people: a man in a tuxedo, a woman in a red gown with a corsage pinned to it and another woman, this one…\n\nWeight is something that I've thought about every single day of my adult life,” says Jennifer Blackburn*, a 49-year-old public relations professional in Toronto. Following decades of trying different diets and medications—and nding little success—in fall 2022 she started taking Ozempic, the diabetes drug that has become synonymous with celebrity weight loss. “It has been life-changing,” she says. U.S. health-care providers wrote more than 9.million prescriptions for Ozempic and similar drugs during the last few months of 2022, around the time Blackburn received her script. Some 890.million adults have obesity worldwide, and weight-loss drug sales are forecast to grow to as much as $100.billion by the end of the decade. No wonder obesity medications are a hot topic. But there's still mass confusion around who should take them, whether the potentipal side…\n\nWhen Shannen Doherty reunited with her Beverly Hills, 90210 castmates for a 90s Con panel in Tampa in September 2023, she teared up as she received a standing ovation from the audience and her castmates alike. Just three months before, the actress had shared on social media that her stage 4 breast cancer had spread to her brain. Wiping her eyes, she expressed her gratitude. “Thank you so much,” Doherty told the crowd. “I have a fight for my life that I deal with every day.” Doherty’s remarkable journey ended on July 13 when she died at age 53 nearly a decade after she was diagnosed with cancer. She was surrounded by loved ones and her beloved dog Bowie. Soon after, tributes poured in, a testament to a woman whose acting…\n\nAstronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have found six massive galaxies with roughly as many stars as our own Milky Way, but in the cosmic dawn less than a billion years after the Big Bang. These galaxies are not supposed to exist at such early times. Galaxies like our own take billions of years to amass their hundreds of billions of stars. To put it in perspective, a galaxy that is madly churning out stars produces only 100 Suns’ worth of stars per year. And our own staid Milky Way makes only a handful of stars per year that together weigh about as much as our Sun. So, the galaxies spotted by JWST would have had to be massively productive since the dawn of the universe — and the…\n\nYour Mac, iPhone and iPad look set to change in fundamental ways later this year – and it’s all thanks to Apple take’s on artificial intelligence (AI), which the company’s renamed Apple Intelligence. Making its debut in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia this autumn, Apple Intelligence will give you easier and faster new ways to do things, all the while safeguarding your privacy. Or that’s the promise. On iPhone, the most obvious change will be a revamped version of Siri, which now shimmers around the edge of your iPhone’s screen when you invoke it. Apple says Siri can glean facts about you, the things you like to do and your key relationships and combine them in useful ways. In its keynote Worldwide Developer Conference address in June, Apple gave one…\n\nThe art of flying fast is both nuanced and complex – it’s definitely not just about gliding as fast as we can. And having recently taken up gliding, I’ve been working hard this summer to increase my average speed in order to crack my 500km flight. Along the way, I’ve been lucky enough to talk with several glider pilots in my local club, and also go on a coaching week. And there’s lots we can learn from glider pilots when it comes to increasing our efficiency as paraglider pilots. In a recent issue, Baptiste Lambert gave some fascinating insights into how efficiency and tactics translates into the kind of speeds needed to break paragliding world records. He explained how efficiency means doing different things in different situations. It may indeed…\n\nCPU AMD RYZEN 5 7600 WWW.AMD.COM Don’t be fooled by its understated demeanor compared to its X sibling; the Ryzen 5 7600 is no slouch when it comes to CPU prowess. Both chips feature the same core counts, the same cache, the same CCD setup, and more impressively, similar clock speeds as well, at least at stock. For your money, you get six cores, with multithreading for 12 threads, along with a base clock of 3.8 GHz and a turbo of 5.1 GHz. There’s all the hardware support you’d expect for a Ryzen 7000 series chip, including PCIe 5.0 and DDR5, but it’s the differences in clock speed that blew us away. The Ryzen 5 7600X is only 200 MHz faster on its boost clock, and although it has 900…\n\nWatercolor has long been used by artists to create travelogues of their adventures. Although sometimes these studies are used as preparatory sketches for later studio paintings, many artists consider their plein air work finished pieces. These “travel diaries” provide interesting insight into the artist's mind: what captured the artist's attention, what colors and contrasting shapes stood out, and what atmospheric conditions the artist experienced. Watercolor has proven to be an ideal medium to make these quick studies. Easy to carry, with little cleanup time required, watercolor enables an artist to succinctly capture the ambiance of the subject. Only requiring water, paints, and a substrate, watercolor is an excellent and convenient choice for the plein air artist. Travelogues have the powerful ability to transport the viewer back to a particular time and place…\n\nNo, it’s not your imagination: As we get older it becomes more difficult to manage our weight. What gives? Neal Barnard, M.D., a world-renowned nutrition expert at George Washington University, has the answer: “Eating the wrong foods is poisoning your calorie-burning ability,” he asserts. The good news: “This change is not something permanent or irreversible. With the right food choices, it goes away.” He says, “You’re about to learn the easiest and most effective way to lose weight permanently.” Now more than ever, experts know exactly what foods to eat to restore an aging, sluggish metabolism and shed unwanted pounds. Why? A number of scientific discoveries have helped pinpoint what Dr. Barnard calls “power foods.” Food discovery #1: Back in 2005, a team at the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine proved that…\n\nEYES ON THE PRIZE Paris, July 26 Snoop Dogg, who served as a torchbearer for the 2024 Olympic Games’ Opening Ceremony, showed off his spirited spectacles. “The torchbearer is a peace messenger, the one who delivers peace,” the rapper said in a video on Instagram. “So it fits who I am.” CATCHING UP Amagansett, N.Y., July 25 Longtime friends Gwyneth Paltrow (left) and Cameron Diaz connected at the opening of Paltrow’s Goop French Pharmacie three-day pop-up in the Hamptons.

A string of good luck saved him, even though he lost a hand and a leg. Sharing his story with People, the 47-year-old, now a motivational speaker and environmentalist featured on Shark Week (streaming now on Max), recalls the nightmare, how he healed and what it taught him. It started out as a pretty boring day. I was doing a counterterrorism training exercise with my mates when I felt this big whack on the back of my leg, but I…\n\nWhat happened Vice President Kamala Harris rode a wave of newfound energy among Democrats this week, as donations to the presumed presidential nominee’s campaign poured in and polls showed the race with Donald Trump narrowing into a dead heat. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll put Harris ahead of Trump in four of seven swing states, a dramatic shift from previous polling that showed the Republican nominee with widening leads over President Biden. Harris held 2-point leads in Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada, and led in Michigan by 11 points. The pair were tied in Georgia, which Biden’s campaign had all but written off. Harris’ campaign reported raising $200 million in its first week—two-thirds of it from first-time donors—and signing up more than 170,000 new volunteers. “My phone has been blowing up,” said…\n\nAs families go, the Fergusons of Anaheim Hills, Calif., seemed closer than most. Jeffrey Ferguson, an Orange County superior court judge, and his wife, Sheryl, a homemaker, doted on their adult son Phillip, a student at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where his parents bought him a home and planned to retire so that they could spend more time with him in the future. Family friend Early Hawkins ran into the trio at a bar association social event last summer. “I gave Sheryl a hug,” Hawkins recalls, and he teased Phillip about the photos of gourmet meals he had cooked that Sheryl proudly posted on Facebook. “They seemed like a happy family,” says Hawkins. “They seemed fine—very fine.” But all was not well. On Aug. 3, 2023, Anaheim police arriving at…\n\nWhether you’re in a panic about feeding your newly vegan kid or managing appointments for a parent’s illness, you likely have a lot keeping you up. Add biology, and if you wake up ready to embrace the day, you’re one of the lucky ones. In your teens and 20s sleep was so easy you could do it, well, with your eyes closed. But with age come saboteurs like hormonal changes and a weakening circadian rhythm, the body’s 24-hour biological clock that governs sleep patterns, appetite, temperature regulation and more. No shock, then, that about a third of U.S. women report rarely or never waking up feeling rested, per a new survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Sadly, the fallout goes beyond feeling draggy and irritable: Chronic poor sleep drains your…\n\nBig Sur is a major upgrade to macOS, and some people are ready for it. However, if you’ve been running Mojave or an earlier version of macOS to keep 32-bit applications running, you may still be holding back. If you’re otherwise ready to move forward, you have a few options for keeping your Mojave installation active. In each case, I’d recommend starting by making a full disk image backup of your current macOS setup with Disk Utility, SuperDuper!, or Carbon Copy Cloner. In case something goes wrong, you can revert to it or restore from it. Your easiest path is to buy or use a sufficiently large external drive and clone to it directly from your current Mac. This lets you even boot from it in a pinch, so you don’t have a…\n\nColleen Hoover gives excellent hugs. Before sitting down for an interview with People during the fifth and final year of Book Bonanza, her annual romance book festival, she offers a warm embrace before introducing herself. It’s immediately clear that the author of such smash hits as Verity, Heart Bones and It Ends With Us—the 2016 novel about generational domestic violence that has been made into a new movie (out Aug. 9)—hasn’t let massive success change her. Hoover, 44, who co-executive-produced the film with stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni (who also directed it), is still an introvert who’d rather wear press-on nails than sit through a salon appointment. She drives an unassuming black SUV so she can remain under the radar while going about her day-to-day business in her small Texas…\n\nIT was only a matter of time. With Catherine, the Princess of Wales, out of the spotlight as she contends with cancer, the rumors came back. Before she announced her diagnosis, Kate’s mysterious absence from public life gave rise to much speculation, the nastiest of which was that she and Prince William were on the verge of a divorce — and that he was throwing her over for his “mistress,” Rose Hanbury, the Marchioness of Cholmondeley. Things got so bad that in March, Rose broke her five-year silence to address the alleged affair via a statement from her attorneys: “The rumors are completely false.” Yet they persist, with some now claiming that in the wake of his wife’s illness, William, 42, has gone running back to Rose. Since 2019, he has…\n\nHEALTH Who doesn't wish for an easier weightloss journey? It can be tricky to make those all-important changes to improve our diet and exercise, and trickier still to know which of the endless weight-loss fads will be the one to work for you. Of course, there is no substitute for healthy eating and regular exercise, but scientists might have found something of a cheat code for burning calories. And it all comes down to a fat-burning mechanism that you already have in your body. It's known as beige fat. Lots of mammals, including humans, have three types of fat cells: white, brown and beige. A team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, USA, have discovered a way of getting white fat cells to transform themselves into beige.…\n\nI have an admission: Though I frequently review new Apple products, I don’t always buy them. Like many of you, I can’t afford to update every bit of Apple hardware every time the company revises one of its products. So I have to carefully measure when my stuff has now become too old and needs to be replaced with the shiny and new versions. Of course, Apple would love us all to buy new stuff all the time. But the company has to earn its sales the hard way. I might buy a new iPhone because of an upgraded camera or a new MacBook Air because of a new design and a faster processor. I might bypass the latest Apple Watch because the new features just don’t matter to me. As the…\n\nWHETHER YOU REALIZE IT OR NOT, YOU’RE PART OF A REVOLUTION. Let me explain. In the past, ideas to interpret the nature of things developed slowly. Before there was astronomy, there was astrology, attempting to divine mystic meaning from the motions of stars and planets. What became chemistry was originally alchemy, seeking to transform lead into gold. It took millennia for these primitive practices to mature into the sciences. And even when they did, early science was largely about classification, whether it be bones, mineral specimens, or tree leaves. The landscape of astronomy really changed in the 1860s, when the development of spectroscopy ushered in a new era of understanding the universe: the era of astrophysics. Finally, astronomers could begin in earnest to decipher the physical nature of objects in the cosmos in…\n\nACTRESS ALISON SWEENEY ‘Oh, This Is It. This Is Really Happening’ Recently, when Alison Sweeney’s son Ben, 19, spent a few days away from the family, his 15-year-old sister was the first to remark on his absence at dinner. “There was an empty seat at the table, literally,” recalls Sweeney, 47, “and Megan finally said, ‘He’s not here for me to tease about his drama class.’” The moment was a sneak peek at the family’s new normal as Ben prepares to head off to Baylor University in Waco, Texas, in August. “He’s really looking forward to it,” the Hallmark star says. “The tears sneak up on me, but he’s going to be just fine.” Here she shares her coping strategies. Give them some credit. “He knows how to make himself dinner and how to…\n\n“Demi made a promise to Bruce that she would look after Emma and Mabel and Evelyn, too.”— a friend tells Star MORE than two years ago, Bruce Willis’ loved ones bravely shared news of the movie star’s heartbreaking health crisis with the world. In 2022, they announced he’d retired from acting after being diagnosed with aphasia, a brain disorder that robs a person of their ability to communicate. Another devastating diagnosis — frontotemporal dementia — followed less than a year later. In recent months, a source confirms to Star, things have only been getting worse. “Bruce’s dementia is progressing,” says the source, leaving his family to make peace with what’s to come. Second wife Emma Heming is Bruce’s loving and devoted primary caretaker. But nearly 24 years after their divorce, ex-wife Demi…\n\n“She just wants to blend in.”— a friend tells Star SHILOH JOLIE was just a few weeks old when she landed her first paying gig, raking in a reported $4.1 million posing adorably with her A-list parents on the cover of a national magazine. Since then, she’s traveled the globe with mom Angelina Jolie and dad Brad Pitt, worn a Dior dress on the red carpet and lived comfortably in Angelina’s $25 million Los Angeles mansion. As a source tells Star, “Shiloh has never wanted for a thing.” After turning 18 on May 27, the famous Hollywood offspring is ready to spread her wings. In a nod to her newfound independence, Shiloh promptly filed legal papers to drop her dad’s last name, and now the source tells Star she wants to start…\n\nSO THE NEXT version of the Mac’s operating system, macOS 15, is to be called Sequoia. Found in northern California and southern Oregon, the sequoia is a giant redwood tree, the tallest trees on Earth.

But he was a teenage boy, and he was curious.” An outdoorsy kid, “he wasn’t really into social media,” Bogard recalls. Except YouTube, where Mason liked to watch how-to videos on tying fishing lures. At one point, however, he showed his mom a video of a funny viral challenge. “We had a conversation right then: ‘Buddy, some of these challenges can be dangerous.’” Just two weeks after that talk, on May 1, 2019, Mason, then a 15-year-old freshman, hugged his dad good night, told his mom he loved her and went upstairs…\n\n1 MAKE & MODEL Burris Veracity PH 4-20X50 RETICLE Rapid Cross MOA MSRP $1,560 URL burrisoptics.com NOTES Burris Optics’ Veracity PH 4-20x50 riflescope is crafted for precision with a Rapid Cross MOA illuminated reticle and ED glass for clear vision.

But even her most ardent fans will be surprised by her frankness in the recently unearthed interviews at the center of the new documentary Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes. Director Nanette Burstein, whose film made its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May and debuts on HBO Aug. 3, marvels at how Taylor “spoke so candidly at the height of her career.” The documentary samples 40 hours of conversations between the star and the late journalist Richard Meryman in 1964 and 1965—a time when Taylor’s relationship with new husband Richard Burton demanded so much attention that the paparazzi were invented in order to cover it. “So much had been written about her and scandalized about her,” says Tim Mendelson, cotrustee of Taylor’s…\n\nFor the third year in a row, the July 10 milestone came and went without any public acknowledgement from Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher. “They’ve been married for 14 years, but they haven’t publicly celebrated their anniversary since 2021,” a source notes of the pair, who haven’t walked a red carpet together since November 2022. “He never shows up at her events anymore — and he’s been almost entirely absent from her Instagram feed.” To an extent, insiders tell In Touch, Carrie and Mike have been leading separate lives. “They’ve been spending a lot of time apart,” the source says of the retired hockey player, who is often at their Nashville home base with the kids while the country superstar travels to perform. ”Her focus on her career over family time…\n\nPasswords are among the banes of most people’s online lives. Even though passkeys (where you can use a second device to prove you are you and gain access) are beginning to make things easier, it will be a long time before we move away from the confusing collection of numbers, symbols, and letters (at least one of which should be uppercase) that online services demand. Remembering the various account details for each site or app we use is an overwhelming task, meaning we often resort to having the same login for everything, which is a disaster waiting to happen. To get around this, without having to write down all our passwords in a little book or, worse still, in the notes app on your phone, a password manager is a far…\n\nVanessa Williams looks back on her decades-long career on stage and screen and asks herself, “Is it typecasting? Am I always going to play these strong women that have attitude?” It’s true, the actress, singer and former beauty queen, 61, has stepped into the stilettos of quite a few alpha women, including her latest role, reimagining Meryl Streep’s steely fashion magazine mogul Miranda Priestly in London’s upcoming musical adaptation of the hit 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada. But Williams, who is spending her one day off from rehearsals reflecting on her life at a stately English manor near her current gig, is not the type to be the least bit bothered by the roles, or the cards, she’s been dealt. “I always find it fascinating. My characters are formidable because…\n\n“I need to level with you,” said Donna Merrill’s doctor. “Your liver is getting worse, and if you need a transplant, you’ll be denied because your BMI is too high.” The Nebraska grandmother felt panic race through her body. Her mind began to race too. For years they’ve told me if I eat better, my health would improve, Donna thought. All those diets I gave up on—why didn’t I try harder? Now I could die, and it will be my own fault. “It’s not too late to make changes,” added the doctor, patting her knee. Donna nodded, unconvinced. She’d had little luck when she was in better shape; now she was 309 pounds and always exhausted. Donna tried to hold back tears as she thought of her family.

Medical experts spill the ailing 81-year-old chief executive has seemingly been ravaged by the effects of dementia — a progressive neurological illness that slowly robs the victim of the ability to think, remember and reason — and it’s only going to get worse with time! “I do not think he’d be able to survive another term as president, and if he did, I do not believe he’d be able to endure the rigors of the job,” Connecticut-based psychologist Dr. Holly Schiff tells The ENQUIRER. “Dementia is progressive, and his brain structure and capabilities will continue…\n\nIF YOU’VE BEEN a PC enthusiast for long enough, you’ll know the feeling: your once-proud system has started to feel a little long in the tooth. Back in the heyday of Moore’s Law, that might only take a year or two, but things have slowed down quite a bit these days. Every generation of new hardware outperforms the previous generation, but sometimes the gap can be quite narrow. Most of us don’t have unlimited funds, and the question inevitably becomes one of stretching your existing hardware as far as possible and choosing the most beneficial upgrades. That’s especially true with gaming PCs, where the usual advice tends to focus on replacing the GPU. It’s the pixel-pumping heart of any gaming rig, after all—why bother with upgrading any other components? It helps…\n\nFOR ANY LONG-TIME PC veteran, the mechanical keyswitch might seem like a bit of an oddity, arriving back into the PC market after so many years, and with good reason. The first keyboards produced by IBM back in the early ’80s were actually based on a similar mechanical design. In fact, if you took the stats and specs of a Model F, and placed them side by side with a similar mechanical keyboard today, you’d be hard pressed to tell them apart, at least outside of the realm of RGB. The Model F launched with a ‘buckling spring’ style of keyswitch. Effectively, a long spring situated under the keycap would push down and bend when pressed, pushing force onto a metal plate that would make contact with the PCB below, completing…\n\niPhone 16 details leak What can you expect in the next–generation iPhone? BASED ON PAST practice, Apple is due to launch the iPhone 16 in the fall, most likely as early as mid September. Recent leaks have already given us a good idea of some of the key specs. > A18 CHIP IN ALL MODELS A leak of Apple product identifier codes suggests all four models of iPhone 16 will have an Apple A18 chip inside. The new codes — iPhone17,1 through 17,4 — follow Apple’s usual convention, which denotes the chip used. The iPhone 15 Pro, for example, is designated iPhone16,1 and has the A17 Pro chip inside. So, four models all with the same chip, but possibly more processor cores etc in the Pro models. There is also a…\n\nTop Gun: Maverick. Anyone But You. Hit Man.

Last year was the 18th consecutive year that LP (long play) sales grew in the United States, and it was the biggest year for the format since Luminate, a company that tracks music sales, began collecting data in 1991. Almost 50 million vinyl albums were sold in 2023, up 14.2% from 2022—still a long way from the 1970s, when more than 300 million records would sell in a single year. 2 THIS RECENT surge is fueled by none other than Ms. Taylor Swift. Last year's top-selling vinyl album was her 1989 (Taylor's Version), the first record to sell a million copies in a calendar year since Luminate's launch. Swift had five of the top…\n\n15 / ADVENT Not very long ago, a long-time audio buddy gave me a chance to hear his Double Advent setup (and in his garage!). The experience, in a sense, just about took my breath away: The speakers, even in that primitive setting, were magnificent! They remained as uncolored and neutral as ever, exceeding too many of today’s socalled “super” systems. I had, if the truth be told, forgotten (audibly) just how very special this doubling up (stacking a pair atop another pair) of Henry Kloss’ last great speaker was and remains. Wished I had had the sense to hold on to the pair I bought back when (actually in 1972, just before I started Issue One of this rag).

We’re saying “fairly easy” because as you’ll see, the settings aren’t all stored in the same place, so you need to go on a bit of a security safari to use them all. The bulk of these features are designed to limit the information that others can access, but some are specifically for preventing a lost or stolen iPhone from becoming an even bigger nightmare. So what should you do if your iPhone gets misplaced? Using another Apple…\n\nKaren Fairchild, Jimi Westbrook, Kimberly Schlapman and Phillip Sweet—the four musicians who make up country band Little Big Town—know a thing or two about banding together. “When my husband died, they literally picked me up and carried me. They were my arms and my legs for so many days,” says Schlapman, 54, whose first husband, Steven Roads, suffered a fatal heart attack in 2005 just as the group was notching their first major hit with “Boondocks.” “That took us to another level of bond and things that families share that nobody else really understands.” Experiencing a death in their extended musical family led to some reevaluation. “At the time, realizing our career had been so in the forefront, you go, ‘Oh, we still live life, and no matter what we’re…\n\nA Match Lit in Heaven Mitch loves cigars, and I love the smell and buying them for him. Every time he smoked one, he'd take the cigar band off and place it on my finger. On our one-year anniversary, we took a motorcycle ride to a boisterous Irish pub. He lit up a cigar, and as usual, I put out my hand. He placed the band on my ring finger and asked me to marry him. Once I realized he meant it, I quickly said yes. He asked if I wanted a special ring, and I said yes, but something unfussy that I could wear 24/7. The romantic in him surprised me once again: He designed matching rings shaped like cigar bands with our initials entwined. —SHANNON MESENBURG Port Charlotte, FL Head over…\n\nWe can understand so much aboutwhat people are communicating by simply paying attention to their physical cues. Let’s say that you’re walking down the street and pass a guy who raises his arm in the air, then swings a knife at you. Body-language-wise, he wants to stab you. Or how about if you’re at work, and your boss calls you into her offce, then takes a swipe at you with a knife? Well, that’s already two people who have tried to take you out. Maybe you’re on a first date and the person seems pretty great so far. You’re starting to feel a physical attraction toward her but aren’t sure if it’s mutual, because she’s not waggling her tongue back at you, and it’s been more than a minute. Another scenario: You’re at…\n\nThey Get Emotional Over Sports! Royal pains! Prince William and Prince George wore matching ties — and intense expressions — while holding their heads in their hands as they cheered on England against Spain at the 2024 UEFA European Championship final in Berlin, Germany, on July 14.

Arson charges: A California man accused of igniting the fifth-largest wildfire in the state’s history, the Park Fire, was arraigned this week for arson. According to the Butte County district attorney, Ronnie Dean Stout II, 42, pushed a burning car into a ravine in the city of Chico’s sprawling Bidwell Park last week. After falling 60 feet, the car crashed and spread its flames across nearly 400,000 acres—or more than 600 square miles—in Northern California. “It looked like a volcano,” said Chico resident Paul Mozzino, “like something out of Hellraiser.” Thousands of residents evacuated, and at least 277 buildings were destroyed. About 80 percent of the fire is still burning uncontained and is expected to spread. Stout, who was released from prison in 2018 after serving 20 years…\n\nPresident Biden isn’t the first incumbent to end his re-election bid. In 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson also chose to walk away. Why did Johnson drop out? In March 1968, the Texas Democrat was in a tight spot. A shrewd and colorful former Senate majority leader and vice president, he had assumed the presidency following the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and the following year had won election to a full term in a landslide. With large Democratic majorities in Congress, Johnson had a remarkably productive run, passing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, Medicare and Medicaid, and a slate of social programs for what he called the Great Society. But by 1968, his domestic wins had been eclipsed by growing anger over the Vietnam War, in which some 500…\n\nWell, that was fast. The M3 chip, introduced last October, is already yesterday’s news. We’re living in an M4 world, courtesy of the surprising announcement that the new iPad Pro is powered by Apple’s next generation of chips. Even if you don’t care about iPads, this announcement will affect the trajectory of the Mac and iPhone in quite a few ways. The first question to answer is: Why so soon? The iPhone gets a new chip generation once a year when the new iPhones arrive. Apple likely wants the M series on a similar cadence, since the two chips are really variations of one another. The rush to the M4 breaks this cycle. A NEW CHIP ARCHITECTURE The answer is complicated and has a lot to do with the vagaries of chip manufacturing.

Logan, as Wolverine is also known, turns out to be a surprisingly obliging guest, politely if unsmilingly observant of his host’s house rules. In other words, the film is a vehicle for Deadpool and for Reynolds. If there isn’t much going on beneath D&W’s fussily textured surface of meta-humor, well, that’s the point. What you get is a winkingly self-aware stream of jokes about comic-book franchises and Disney corporate might—a superheroes’ volley of inside industry references. It’s a game of pickleball played by giants. That should be enough irreverence for any Marvel movie (or at…\n\nSOMETIMES YOU GO LOOKING for a car, and sometimes a car finds you. While I am prone to oddball searches just for entertainment’s sake—Facebook Marketplace is basically my Tinder for the Merkur XR4Ti—I wasn’t in the market for a 1990 Daihatsu Rocky. Until very recently, I was barely aware of the Rocky’s existence. But then I happened upon a neighborhood estate sale, and there in the garage was the most pristine Rocky I’d ever seen. It was also the only Rocky I’d ever seen. My weird-car antenna went up like the telescoping one on a Daihatsu Rocky A-pillar, which you can reach with your left hand from the driver’s seat. If you’re ready for more Daihatsu Rocky facts, buckle up—just not with the center rear belt of a Rocky, because…\n\nExtraction 2 FRIDAY, JUNE 16 ORIGINAL DRAMA Thor has a hammer, but Netflix has a Rake…as in Tyler Rake, the black-ops mercenary played by Marvel god Chris Hemsworth (right). In this sequel to the 2020 hit—still one of Netflix’s most watched originals ever—Rake’s recovery from a brutal face-off with an Indian drug lord is cut short when his team is recruited to free his former sister-in-law and her kids from a foreign prison. The action is A+ (strap in for a jaw-dropping 21-minute escape sequence!), and Hemsworth is in on almost all of it, raves stuntman turned director Sam Hargrave. “If you are seeing his face, then he was doing [the stunt]…. He was in the cars doing driving, he was hanging from wires off the side of the buildings. He was lit…\n\nREMEMBER WHEN? Blond, buoyant and full of charm, Donna Mills is as beautiful today as she was when she burst onto the Hollywood scene in the 1970s. But fans of the glamorous bombshell might be surprised to learn that at 83, she’s making a name for herself in a whole new business: wine making. And Donna and her companion of 22 years, Larry Gilman, grow the grapes to make their vintage malbec or cabernet sauvignon wines right in their backyard. Donna says her vineyard–which she and Larry dubbed Mandeville Vineyards—is her new sanctuary. “I don’t know what I would do without it!” she shares with Woman’s World. “It takes me to a place that is so basic and real. Being out in nature, growing something—it’s calming and centering.” That’s not to say she has…\n\nDorian Scott shook his head reading yet another email in his inbox clearly meant for someone else. He recently started working as a surgical technician at Ochsner Medical Complex-Clearview in New Orleans but kept getting emails about scheduling issues. This time, he decided to investigate and learned the emails were actually intended for a woman in the surgical scheduling department named Dorionne Scott. Same name, different spelling. Interesting, he thought. But then… Could it possibly be? Dorian wondered. Parallel lives Dorian was only 2 years old when his tummy began to swell and he started having seizures. His pediatrician referred him to New Orleans’ Children’s Hospital, where doctors made a traumatic discovery: Dorian had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). “The good news is this kind of leukemia is very treatable with an exceptionally high success…\n\nYOU KNOW HOW WHEN YOU’RE NERVOUS you get butterflies in your stomach, or you can feel tired and logy all day when you’re constipated? This shows that the gut and the rest of the body have a big influence on each other. In recent years, research has made that connection even clearer.

At 47, Johnson has created and sold businesses for a combined total of over $1.15 billion. His direct-to-consumer orthodontics provider, Byte, reached a billion dollars in valuation without any external investment; Alter, a fitness brand focusing on DNA and daily biometrics, “is on a trajectory to exceed that number by multiples,” he says. His seventh enterprise—a consumerfinance company, Forma—has just launched. Success has allowed Johnson to explore passions including art, watches, pens, and philanthropy. “I’ve had so many lucky breaks along the way—especially at the age…\n\nJust a few years ago, astronomers witnessed something strange happening in a galaxy 848 million light-years away. The supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of this galaxy was chugging along, steadily gobbling up matter. Then in December 2020, it suddenly flared up as it feasted on a wayward star and became 1,000 times brighter — only to subsequently develop an odd, steady flicker. For four months, until the outburst eventually faded, the galaxy’s center dimmed slightly every 8.3 days — a behavior never seen before in an SMBH outburst. After some forensic investigation, astronomers think they know why: This supermassive black hole has a smaller companion black hole zipping around it that kicks up dust every time it pops through the disk of material that surrounds the SMBH. In a paper published…\n\nIN TOUCH INVESTIGATES Hollywood GETS HACKED! Disney isn’t the happiest place on Earth right now for some A-listers. A hacker group called Nullbulge — said to be based out of Russia — claims to have obtained and leaked more than 1 terabyte of data from Disney’s internal Slack channels. Disney, which is a parent company to Marvel Studios, Disney+ and Hulu, among other businesses, “was our target due to how it handles artist contracts, its approach to AI, and its pretty blatant disregard for the consumer,” Nullbulge reportedly wrote in an email to Variety. Now Hollywood is bracing for the fallout. “Secrets are going to come out,” an industry insider tells In Touch. “Once-confidential information is already spreading over the dark web.

KIPLINGER: You’ve said the Fed is using the wrong gauge for inflation and targeting the wrong level. What do you mean, and what would you prefer? ZANDI: The fed targets 2% inflation as measured by growth in what’s known as the personal consumption expenditures deflator. At the current time, it’s a flawed measure of inflation because it includes something called owners’ equivalent rent. That’s the implicit rental cost of owning your own home—it tries to measure what a homeowner would have to pay in rent to live in their home. In theory, that sounds great. But in practice, it’s very problematic, in large part because the housing market is upside down. The affordable part of the market is extra ordinarily tight, with vacancy…\n\n1 SAMSUNG GALAXY RING • £399, samsung.com Some launches wow us with the tech – and there’s plenty to be wowed about here – but some excite us most with their attitude. Samsung’s long-awaited Galaxy Ring scores highly on the latter: Samsung’s philosophy is clearly that there should be no barriers to improving your health, and it’s done everything to ensure that’s possible.

When the CD is gone, and it will be soon, we’ll miss it. New CD releases are winding down.1 In the classical world, the era of big, bargain-priced boxes of CDs—a somewhat recent development—is ending because, after a long, slow descent, retail sales have fallen off a cliff in the past year or so. In pop and rock, if you discover a new band you like, you may or may not be able to buy a CD. Perhaps they’ll self-publish a few to sell at concerts; there’s a better chance they’ll have LPs, assuming they can get time at a vinyl-mastering studio and a pressing plant, both of which are booked to the max. CDs, though, are an afterthought if they’re even that. Vinyl records will likely stay…\n\nBlake Benthall stumbled into a job running an online drug bazaar, said Ryan Mac and Kashmir Hill in The New York Times. Things didn’t go the way you might expect. AT A CRYPTOCURRENCY convention in Austin in May, Blake Emerson Benthall hustled for investor money alongside scores of other entrepreneurs. But none of them, it is safe to say, could pitch their experience as the leader of a multimillion-dollar criminal drug enterprise. In the convention’s “Deal Flow Zone,” Benthall, 5-foot-4, clean-shaven, and wearing a gray tee with his startup’s logo, turned his laptop around at a lunch table and began giving his spiel to a bespectacled potential investor. “I’m a lifelong entrepreneur,” Benthall said as he clicked through a presentation that detailed how he had run Silk Road 2.0, the second iteration of…\n\nTHE DUST has settled on the orgy of silicon, sweat-shop capitalism, and silly AI marketing straplines that was the 2024 Computex show in Taiwan. All that’s left bar the cocktail of air-travel contracted pathogens currently laying waste to the post-Computex attendees is to decide which was the best new laptop chip announced at the show. AMD’s or Intel’s? I know what you’re thinking. What about Qualcomm’s new Arm chip, the Snapdragon X? It may well be a turning point for Arm on the PC, but there’s a long way to go, and much to prove, not least the efficacy of its x86 emulation. In reality, the vast majority of laptops are still going to use AMD and Intel x86 chips for several years to come. In some ways, Intel’s Lunar Lake…\n\nAs the sun rose over rural Oklahoma on Sept. 4, 2023, father and son Victor and Dailen Presgrove drove along Highway 81, anxiously bracing for what they were about to find. Less than an hour earlier, they had gotten a call with devastating news: 19-year-old Noah Presgrove, Victor’s son and Dailen’s little brother, had been found dead on the side of the road outside Terral. Now Victor and Dailen were looking for his body. “We didn’t know exactly where he was, so we’d go up each hill unaware if we were about to see Noah,” recalls Dailen, 24. “That drive felt like a year.” They soon met authorities where passing drivers had found Noah lifeless by the highway. A silver-plated chain necklace from Noah’s grandmother lay scattered in pieces not far…\n\nThe golden age of artificial intelligence has just begun, with AI tools now available that help people get more things done. But Apple’s presence in AI has been muted, to put it kindly. Apple needs to do something to make an impression and tell the world it’s keeping up with the times. That impression was made during Apple’s “Let Loose” event to showcase new iPads. The company also used the event to announce the new M4 chip, which has the fastest Neural Engine Apple has ever created—the Neural Engine is used to perform AI functions. It’s clearly Apple’s effort to keep up with the competition. Delivering the M4 chip at this time is a dramatic change from Apple’s typical chip cycle.

When scouts watch Dickinson, they see a blueliner who has the requisite size and strength to be an impact player in the NHL and has no discernible flaws. “He’s big and mobile, and the strength of his game is without the puck,” one scout said. “And then you watch him and you say, ‘Wow, he’s pretty good with the puck.’ I think there’s a high ceiling for this guy.” Dickinson is already bigger and stronger than most of the players in the OHL,…\n\nTHE REVOLUTIONARY PRODUCT THAT REPRESENTS SO MUCH MORE THAN APPLE’S FIRST EVER AR HEADSET Phew! By the time you read this, you will have probably had some time to absorb the news from this past week of an abundance of both hardware and software announcements from Apple. But there can be no doubt about the standout performer among the headlines: the new, long-in-development Apple Vision Pro augmented reality (AR) headset. A memorable keynote opened the formalities of the Cupertino firm’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference with the kind of self-assurance that even Apple’s fellow tech giants can rarely seem to equal. And of course, there were quite a few well-merited reasons to get excited about WWDC ’23, even long before CEO Tim Cook brought back his late predecessor’s “one more thing…” refrain for… well,…\n\n>9.

He’s clearly taken the advice his father gave him and run with it. And like there was with Jarome, there is an awful lot to like about all aspects of Tij’s game. But one stands out above the rest. “He has an unbelievable shot,” one scout said. “An absolute rocket. You get the puck to him anywhere in the offensive zone and he’s a threat to score.” Added another scout: “One of the things I like about him is his ability to release…\n\nFROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THERE COMES time for every family when the tables turn and the parent has to answer to the child. Mine came recently when my wife and I stayed with our elder son in Los Angeles—our first visit in several years and the longest since he moved west in 2014. A whole week under his roof! “Dad, don't leave the water running when you brush your teeth,” Nathaniel admonished on our first night. Ditto when I washed my hands. All right, I figured, this is California, where drought is a concern. But I also got busted for pulling extra paper towels to wipe the kitchen counter and was instructed to use the dishcloth, which didn't seem sanitary. More edicts followed. Not to leave my clunky walking shoes sitting out,…\n\nOVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS, the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Gaia space observatory has transformed our understanding of the history of our Milky Way Galaxy. From Gaia’s perch at Earth’s L2 Lagrange point, roughly 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) distant, it has produced the most comprehensive three-dimensional survey of the Milky Way ever made: a catalog containing the precise locations, motions, and chemical compositions of nearly 2 billion objects. For scientists, the Gaia catalog is an astonishing treasure trove that has revealed that the Milky Way had a more violent and dynamic history than we ever imagined. Researchers have identified families of stars with common origins, related by similarities in their composition and motions. Some of these families are streams of stars flowing through and around the galaxy, flung about…\n\nAMD’s Zen 5 is here! AMD launched its next-generation Ryzen 9000 series of desktop PC processors at Computex in early June, kicking off the next round of processor competition between AMD, Intel, and (now) Qualcomm. If you recall our Ryzen 7950X review, you’ll remember that chip was accompanied by three others.

This is AMD’s Granite Ridge architecture, supported by new X870 motherboards. There’s a treat for existing customers, too: AMD is formally extending the lifespan of its AM5 socket through 2027, up from the previously pledged 2025, and is adding the Ryzen 9 5900XT and Ryzen 7 5800XT too on the AM4 platform.

Newhart recalled his refusal in his 2006 memoir: “This stammer bought me a house in Beverly Hills.” Indeed, Newhart’s signature speech pattern—frequent, uncertain pauses while attempting to rationally navigate outrageous situations—was what struck a chord with audiences and propelled him to stardom. He became a celebrity nearly overnight in 1960 when his first record shot to the top of the charts. “I marvel at it daily,” he said of his rapid rise. Throughout his success in TV and film, he remained a down-to-earth family man—a father of four and husband of 60 years—and worked steadily until his death on July 18 at age 94 after a series of short…\n\nAs founder and chief designer of Sonus Faber, Franco Serblin designed and manufactured many loudspeakers of acclaimed high quality, mainly in box form. Nevertheless, he remained painfully aware that such conventional rectangular parallelepiped constructions inevitably possessed an inherent and hard-to-suppress resonant signature characteristic of box-form cabinetry, significantly differing from that for a musical instrument. Franco had long obsessed over the sound and construction of classical string instruments, violins, violas, and cellos made by grand masters over centuries. He valued highly those richly resonant, expressive, complex sonic signatures. Most loudspeakers have, to some degree, a characteristic voice or color, partly stemming from their materials and construction. While designers have become skilled in controlling those voices, especially working to decolorize enclosures, some of that characteristic parallelepiped structural signature remains; we sometimes use the…"
