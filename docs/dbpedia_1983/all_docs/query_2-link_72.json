        "text": "“The extreme [Australian] views that are held about China, the fearmongering, the laziness to think and to read and really understand and engage with people whose views you don’t agree with. That’s really worrying.”\n\nShe said in China, the Chinese knew a lot more about Australia than Australians about China.\n\nNick Coyle, Cheng’s partner and former chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, who also spoke at the interview, said it was important that Australia become adept at “walking and chewing gum” over its relationship with China.\n\nParticularly, it was important for the Australian media and the political class not to overreact or “score political points” at every issue that surfaced between the two nations, he added.\n\nBoth agreed there was little nuance in the Australian media’s coverage of China which was “far too binary”.\n\n“[It’s] hug the panda or mug the panda,” Cheng said.\n\n“For the media, they’ll have their go-to persons. This person is anti-China, I’ll just interview this person. This person is pro-China, and you don’t always get the full picture if you don’t talk to people who can be quite holistic in their views on China.”\n\nWhen asked if she felt any bitterness about China after her recent detention, Cheng said while China had deep-seated problems such as freedom of expression, it also embodied a lot of “beauty”.\n\n“When it comes to China, it just evokes so many feelings in me because I’m a very sentimental person and China represents so much, and we all have hopes for people to get along, for beauty to be appreciated,” she said.\n\n“So it’s very complicated, and ask any Chinese person living in Australia, there are things that they miss intensely, that they long for, that they try to replicate here. And there are things that they hate and want to escape, and it’s all a matter of calculus.”\n\nAt the same time, it was also important that people were conscious about not being “seduced” by glossy depictions of China, she added.\n\nRemembering her detention, Cheng said she was aggrieved she could not help her Chinese “cellmates” and felt anger that Beijing treated its people far worse than she experienced.\n\nPatriotism among the Chinese towards their country has waned over the years, in particular among those from Hong Kong and Taiwan, she said.\n\nBeijing views Taiwan as a renegade province that should be reintegrated into mainland control, by force if necessary. While many nations, including the US, do not officially acknowledge Taiwan as an independent state, they oppose any use of force to alter the existing status quo.\n\nThe word on the streets was that China’s defence forces were “a mess”, said Cheng, adding that the Chinese were not united over the Taiwan issue.\n\n“If you ask ordinary Chinese people who have been brainwashed, including myself when I was in primary school in China, is Taiwan part of China? I think most will probably say yes. But if you ask, should China overtake or take over Taiwan by military means, I think you’ll get a much smaller number,” she said."
