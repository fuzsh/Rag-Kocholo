        "text": "See also Tom’s Wines of the Year 2008\n\nRichard Bray, UK\n\nRed: Ridge Montebello 2000, Santa Cruz, USA\n\nWhite: R. Lopez de Heredia Viña Tondonia Gran Reserva Blanco 1987, Rioja, Spain\n\nBudget red: Tramontane Wines Côtes du Roussillon 2009, Roussillon, France\n\nBudget white: Secateurs Chenin Blanc, Badenhorst Family Wines, 2007 & 2009, South Africa\n\nSweet: Consolation Armistice Late Harvest Syrah 2007, Roussillon, France\n\nSparkling: Moët & Chandon 1961, France\n\nFortified: Barbeito 10yo Malvasia, Portugal\n\nDud: The cynicism and growing exclusivity of the fine wine market. Or Mouton 1990, which was inexcusably awful.\n\nThing: Opening Day, Fenway Park, Boston Massachusetts.\n\nComment: It’s bizarre. I’ve chronicled my tastings more than ever this year, and yet the overall impression is a sea of good wine, rather than individual bottles or glasses. The Ridge just barely pipped Leoville-Barton 2000 to the post for reds, which is odd as overall I felt remarkably disappointed by both Bordeaux and Cabernet based wines in general. But the Montebello was enormously impressive and a relative bargain. I confess to being late to the Lopez party. The Tondonia white was simply at a different level, and probably my single wine of the year. In the interest of full disclosure, I help out Andy Cook & Philippe Gard at Tramontane. It doesn’t change the fact that this is the best red I’ve had under ten pounds in the last three years. The Secateurs is great stuff. I wouldn’t be surprised to see more of Adi Badenhorst’s wines on future lists. Again, Consolation’s wines are close to my heart, but I’ve never tasted anything like Armistice. Deservedly becoming legendary among those who have tasted it. The Moët was a magnum opened for the bells at Hogmanay by old friend and bubbly lunatic Pete Crawford. Generous to a fault – it was extraordinary. I’ve had the Barbeito several times this year and it’s never disappointed. The Mouton wasn’t worth its name and I would say the market is self-explanatory. Being at Fenway Park for the Red Sox first game of the season was a dream come true. Just a shame the rest of the season didn’t go as well. Looking forward to new wines in 2011\n\nTOM: Terrific list. The Secateurs is a great representative of the fine Chenins, Syrahs and other wines coming from Swaartland in South Africa – like Leyda or Elqui in Chile, a must-watch area. Andy Cook is an ex-colleague of Richard’s and mutual friend who now makes wines in the Languedoc, including Richard’s budget red – but hey, I am fascinated by the sound of that late harvest Syrah too. One to look out for.\n\nRaymond Tilney, UK\n\nRed: Calera (USA) Reeds Vineyard P.Noir 1996\n\nWhite: Guigal (France) Ex Voto Ermitage 2005\n\nBudget red: No Thanks!\n\nBudget white: Chamonix (S.Africa) Chardonnay 2008\n\nRosé: Jacques Selosse (France) Brut Rose N.V.\n\nSweet: Jacques Selosse (France) Cuvee Exquise N.V.\n\nSparkling: Krug (France) Vintage 1981\n\nFortified: Yquem (France) 1999\n\nDud: Musar (Lebanon) Blanc 2001\n\nThing: The real life occasions that stem from the UK Wine forum\n\nComment: Sorry to be so late Tom but we only had the 81 Krug at the weekend after a dry festive season due to various sicknesses,I just knew it would be the outright WOTY. I had loved the 98 Musar Blanc but just thought the 01 was pants, we really did not get it. The “Thing” has to be the fantastic get togethers in person. The Champagne and Christmas UK Forum ‘Wimps’ and the post CIVC do at The Ritz, joined The Pebbles Blind Challenge as really top events…. there were others.\n\nTOM: I think this officialy makes Cape Chamonix estate in South Africa the ‘sleeper’ of the 2010 WOTY – at least three people have picked their wines in the budget category, which considering how many thousands of estates are on the wine shelves of the UK alone, is pretty remarkable. Raymond – I will let you off wiht the Yquem in the ‘fortified’ category, even though I’m sure you know it is not!\n\nKevin Courtney, New Zealand\n\nRed: Clos des Papes (France) Chateauneuf du Pape 2001\n\nWhite: Schoffit (France) Clos Saint-Theobald GC Rangen Tokay Pinot Gris 2002\n\nBudget red: Borsao (Spain) Crianza seleccion 2006\n\nBudget white: Gran Vinum Essencia Divina (Spain) Albarino 2008?\n\nRosé: Lafon-Veyrolles (France) Bandol Rose 2009?\n\nSweet: Riverby Estate (New Zealand) Noble Riesling 2008\n\nFortified: Morris (Australia) Old Premium Liqueur Muscat\n\nDud: All my oxidised 01 and 02 white burgs.\n\nThing: Finding international acceptance for Marlborough rieslings\n\nComment: I would never have thought my white wine of the year would be a pinot gris, but there you go. I am horribly biased regarding the sweet wine, but it is quite good. Of course I did try heaps of very good New Zealand wine, especially chardonnay, riesling and syrah, but because the European wines are rarer they tend to stick in the memory better. The sparkling is missing because it is a style I just don’t drink enough of.\n\nTOM: Yes, Riesling is definitely a grape with great potential on the South Island, and could be a very useful extra string to Marlborough or Otago’s bow.\n\nPaul Anderson, UK\n\nRed: Meerlust (South Africa) Rubicon 2005\n\nWhite: Zind-Humbrecht (France) Clos Jebsal Pinot Gris 2004 Vendanges Tardives\n\nBudget red: Churton Winery (New Zealand) Tummil Flat Marlborough Pinot Noir 2008\n\nBudget white: Punt Road (Australia) Yarra Valley Chardonnay 2005\n\nRosé: Janison et Fils (France) Rosé Champagne NV\n\nSweet: Lafaurie-Peyraguey (France) Sauternes 1997\n\nSparkling: Drappier (France) Champagne Grande Sendrée 1996\n\nFortified: Quinta do Noval (Portugal) Silval Port 1997\n\nDud: Many white Burgundies (Grrrrr)\n\nThing: Has to be swine flu\n\nComment: I’ve had a few really good wines this year so choosing he best ones was quite difficult. The Rubicon just seemed to punch well above its price mark (£17) and tasted rather sublime with lamb on Christmas Day. The Clos Jebsal (and Z-H) has stirred a bit of debate on W-P recently but this wine was superb. Drank it over three days and it just seemed to improve with each day. The Tummil Flat was my bargain find of the year at £8. Churton Winery is fully biodynamic and it really shows in the quality of this Pinot – not trying to be like Burgundy made it all the better. I was surprised I went for an Oz Chardonnay for my budget wite but if the Punt Road is a sign of what’s to come from there then I’ll be buying more. Good acidity and balance has helped it over the 5 years of ageing. Sneaked a Champagne into the Rosé category but this was the ‘Asda bargain’ flagged up here on W-P and I managed to get a case of the stuff. Superb Champagne for a tenner. The Drappier is now showing well at 14 years old with lovely strong Pinot character coming through. The Silval was about the only Port I had of any quality so it was a no-brainer. The dud has to be white Burgs and this is annoying me more and more. I just wish they’d get their act together having poured so many down the drain. My episode with swine flu was well documented on teh UK Wine Forum and I am still in recovery mode from the effects of being in ICU for 7 weeks. With it being all over the news now brings it all back and reminds me I’m one of the fortunate ones who, having suffered the worst effects of it, actually survived.\n\nTOM: A surprising list from Paul, a stalwart of wine-pages and our UK WIne Forum, who’s list is normally comprised solely of Burgundy, Alsace and Champagne! Maybe that dreadful experience with swine flu gave you time to contemplate other areas! All the best for the continuing recovery.\n\nAngus Duncan, UK\n\nRed: DRC (France) Romanee St Vivant 1972\n\nWhite: Bonneau du Martray (France) Corton-Charlemagne 1990\n\nBudget red: Ampeau (France) Auxey-Duresses 1994\n\nBudget white: Will Schaefer (Germany) Riesling 1997\n\nRosé: Cedric Bouchard (France) Roses de Jeanne Rose de Saignee Creux D’Enfer 2006\n\nSweet: Pierre Bise (France) Coteaux du Layon Chaume 2004\n\nSparkling: Krug (France) 1988\n\nFortified: Fonseca (Portugal) 1963\n\nDud: Flat tires\n\nThing: Mt Ventoux\n\nComment: A lot of my drinking has been at village and premier cru level in Burgundy with an increasing amount of champagne. Cycling has taken a bigger part in my life and Mt Ventoux now has an almost religious significance in my life with 4 separate visits there this year and many climbs (twice following Rayas 98 the night before!)\n\nTOM: Well, I’m in need of a drink just thinking about cycling up Mt ventoux after a bottle of Chateauneuf the night before, so full of admiration!\n\nTim Carlisle, UK\n\nRed: Man O’ War Vineyards Dreadnaught Syrah\n\nWhite: Hans Vineyards Viognier\n\nBudget red: Rene Rostaing Les Lezardes VdP 2005\n\nBudget white: En La Tradition Cotes de St Mont Blanc, Plaimont\n\nRosé: Villa Wolf Pinot Noir\n\nSweet: Royal Tokaji 2005 5 Putts\n\nSparkling: Bollinger Grande Annee 2000\n\nFortified: Fonseca 1994 Vintage Port\n\nDud: Burgundy 08 – especially whites\n\nThing: Rhone Varietals\n\nComment: By no means a classic year but a few things stood out, a colleague spent 3 weeks in New Zealand and when it came to our Kiwi promotion the wines we bought on his recommendation blew me away, none more so that Man O’ War. I also did very well in the WSET Diploma and will visit Austria for a week next year on the back of that, and will expect South Africa to feature next year after I spend a week there in July after winning another industry award – happy days! I could easily have filled most of the holes with Kiwi wines but Bolly 2000 stood out as the current release I’d love to be able to afford and the Fonseca 94 was quite simply amazing. This website and its forum have always encouraged me to delve further into wine, and having started as a pleb looking for more interest it seems fair to pay respect to Tom now I work in the trade, know the difference between Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon Blanc and get to travel places as a result. What a great place the UK Wine forum is!\n\nTOM: Well thank you Tim! And enjoy South Africa – if it is your first time then I am sure you will be just blown away by the beauty of the wine country there.\n\nAnders Lind, Sweden\n\nRed: Ch. Haut-Brion 1989\n\nWhite: Chablis 1cru Montee de Tonnerre 2008, Louis Michel\n\nBudget red: Rosso di Montepulciano, Contucci, 2004\n\nBudget white: Parallèle 20, Vermentinu (Corse) 2009\n\nRosé: Camille Savès Rosé Grand Cru\n\nSweet: Ch. Climens 1988\n\nSparkling: Billecart-Salmon cuvee N. F. 1996\n\nFortified: Taylors Vintage Port 1977\n\nDud: Corked bottles (Las Cases -82, among too many others…)\n\nThing: Spotify music !\n\nComment: Bought the H-B 89 early at still sensible price… fulfilled every possible expectation. Spotify streamed music site changed my life – will never play CD´s again.\n\nTOM: A fine collection of ‘classics’ from Anders – and I wish I’d had the foresight to buy that ’89 Haut-Brion, which is still one of my all time greatest wines.\n\nLars Jensen, Denmark\n\nRed: Rocca & Vinding-Diers´ Due Normanni (Sicily) 2005\n\nWhite: Villa Bucci Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Riserva (Italy) 2006\n\nBudget red: Redhead studios (Australia, Mclaren Vale) The red sedan, Shiraz 2008\n\nBudget white: Gutsverwaltung Niederhausen SchlossBökkelheim Hermannsberg Kabinet (Nahe) Riesling 2006\n\nRosé: Chateau Thuerry, (France) L´exception Merlot-Grenache 2006\n\nSweet: D´yquem (France) 1990\n\nSparkling: Cristal (France) 2002\n\nFortified: Burmester Colheita 1937\n\nDud: Cantenac Brown 2003. Simply not a good wine.\n\nThing: Summer tastings at Chateau D´esclans in Provence. Even though that I will never pay €80 for a rose – by nice tasting it\n\nComment: Hurra! After several years of stand still my “local” German wine Pusher is again able to supply me with Peter Lehmanns Stonewell Shiraz. By far the best australian wine I ever tasted…\n\nTOM: I wonder if the time is right for Verdicchio to make more of an impact on the wine-buying public? There have been a few votes for them this year, and I featured a couple as Wine of the Week and so on. They really can be wonderfully refreshing, subtle but complex wines. selection below added 07/01/2011\n\nIan Matte, Canada\n\nRed: Daniel J Belda ( Spain ) CA’ Belda 2006\n\nWhite: Riverby Estate ( New Zealand ) Sali’s Block Riesling 2009\n\nBudget red: Daniel J Belda ( Spain ) Tempranillo 2005\n\nBudget white: Vina Falernia ( Chile ) Torontel 2010\n\nRosé: Domaine de Cabasse Le Rose de Marie-Antoinette 2009\n\nSweet: Riverby Estate ( New Zealand ) Noble Riesling 2008\n\nSparkling: Edoardo Miroglio ( Bulgaria ) Brut Rose\n\nThing: QR Codes on bottles 🙂\n\nTOM: Nice choices. Love the wines from Falernia in the unearthly Elqui Valley in Chile, and in case anyone is wondering: QR Codes are those squiggly, square barcode patterns that can be read with a smartphone and which take you to lots of information about a product.\n\nDouglas Murray, UK\n\nRed: Ata Rangi (New Zealand) Pinot Noir 2007\n\nWhite: Schloss Johannisberger (Germany) Rosalack Riesling 2007\n\nBudget red: Terra Noble (Chile) Gran Reserva Carmenere 2007\n\nBudget white: Pegasus Bay (New Zealand) Main Divide Riesling 2009\n\nSweet: Kracher (Austria) TBA No. 6 “Grand Cuvee” 2007\n\nSparkling: Pol Roger (France) Vintage Champagne 1998\n\nFortified: Taylor’s (Portugal) Quinta de Varagellas 2001\n\nDud: Chateau de Tracy (France) Pouilly Fume 1997 (kept too long)\n\nThing: Wine tasting visit to New Zealand last February. Marvellous wines, delicious food and charming and delightful people\n\nComment: There were so many excellent wines which I tasted in New Zealand that I feel I must mention a few of them. Te Whau Chardonnay 2008, Kumeu River Hunting Hill Chardonnay 2007, Te Mata Woodthorpe Syrah 2008, Mills Reef Elspeth Cabernet Merlot 2007, Muddy Water Hare’s Breath Pinot Noir 2008, and Seresin Rachel Pinot Noir 2007. For something different another red I really liked was Trapiche Single Vineyard Malbec Vina Federico Villafane 2006.\n\nTOM: Nice, wide-ranging selection from Douglas and whetting my appetite for my trip to NZ in a couple of weeks. Agree too about those single vineyard Malbecs from Trapiche which can be absolutely stunning.\n\nEdward Bolland, UK\n\nRed: Soldera (Italy) Intistieti 1995\n\nWhite: Bouchard (France) Corton Charlemagne 2002\n\nBudget red: Gérard Mouton (France) Givry 2007\n\nBudget white: Roulot (France) Bourgogne Blanc 2007\n\nRosé: Dom Perignon Rosé (France) Champagne 1996\n\nSweet: Raymond Lafon (France) Sauternes 1995\n\nSparkling: Gosset-Brabant Noirs d’Ay NV (France) Champagne\n\nDud: A corked Grand Puy Lacoste\n\nComment: I have not opened that many great bottles this year, but had some fantastic champagnes at the end of the year. My top three wines of the year were champagne, hence the cheat of sneaking in DP Rosé in the Rosé slot. Salon 90 was pretty awesome, but a touch obvious compared with the magnificence of the Gosset-Brabant Noirs d’Ay a wine which just built and built. I look forward to participating in UK Wine forum life in 2011 and enjoying the wonderful input of so many other members.\n\nTOM: We haven’t had a huge number of corked wines being cited as ‘duds’ this year. I wonder if the problem is decreasing, or if people now just write corked bottles off as a hazard of daily wine life?\n\nMichael Keating, UK\n\nRed: Domaine Digioia-Royer, 1er Cru Les Groseilles 2002, Chambolle-Musigny, France\n\nWhite: Eric Morgat, L’Enclos 2005, Savennieres, France\n\nBudget red: Domaine des Rochelles, La Croix du Mission 2003, Anjou-Villages Brissac, France\n\nBudget white: Domaine des Aubuisieres, Silex 2003, Vouvray, France\n\nRosé: Domaine du Sauveroy, Cabernet d’Anjou 2005, France\n\nSweet: Chateau Pierre-Bise, La Pierre de Coulaine, Savennieres Doux, France\n\nSparkling: Roederer NV, Champagne, France\n\nDud: Chateau Duhart-Milon 1996\n\nComment: I don’t drink Loire and/or French exclusively, although the above might give that impression. A Prado Enea 2001 nearly got my Red vote, a Vinalba Malbec Reserva 2006 my budget red. Bought a lot of Mosel Riesling 2008/9 during 2010 so no doubt these will feature in the future sometime.\n\nTOM: Not excluisvely LOire, but pretty comprehensively 🙂 The Vinalba is great value – and subsequent vintages have been very good too.\n\nDon Reid, UK\n\nRed: Jim Barry ( Australia) The Armagh 1994\n\nWhite: Aldo Conterno ( Italy) Bussiador Langhe Chardonnay 2006\n\nBudget red: 2008 Château Maris ( France ) Vieilles Vignes Minervois Cru La Livinière\n\nBudget white: 2009 Marqués de Riscal ( Spain ) Rueda Blanco\n\nRosé: 2009 Château de Sours ( France ) Bordeaux\n\nSweet: 1988 Château Climens ( France) Barsac\n\nSparkling: Vilmart ( France) Champagne Coeur de Cuvée 1990\n\nFortified: Turley (USA) Zinfandel Delinquent 2001\n\nDud: Running out of wine storage space at home.\n\nThing: Discovering we are to be Grandparents again, in June. Fingers crossed.\n\nComment: My WOTY was the exceptional Turley Delinquent, aided by its being matched with the Pave of Chocolate served as dessert at the November WIMPS lunch (a regular luch arranged through the UK Wine Forum). So many of the wines I drank this year were shared with others from this site’s Forum community that the people are as important as the wines in most of my choices. Huge, and annual, thanks to Tom Cannavan for the opportunities provided by this friendly community.\n\nTOM: Lovely choices from Don (a stalwart of our forum community) and reminds me that I have a single bottle of that 94 Armagh in the cellar which I must liberate soon!\n\nMike Bartlett, UK\n\nRed: Cheval Blanc, St Emilion, 2001\n\nWhite: Mac Forbes Yarra Valley Chardonnay 2008\n\nBudget red: Nadal, Domaine de Fondreche, 2007\n\nBudget white: Bruno Sorg, Gewurtzaminer, Alsace, 2007\n\nRosé: Cabaret, Provence 2009\n\nSweet: Petit Vedrines, 2005\n\nSparkling: Pol Roger, special Cuvee, 1998\n\nFortified: have so enjoyed a number of Manzanillas this year\n\nDud: Bruno Giacosa, Barolo Falletto 2000\n\nThing: my 1 year old twins\n\nComment: The Cheval Blanc was my first experience of this wine, still youthful, but already delicious to drink. I loved Mac Forbes’ elegant and distinctly European Chardonnay. The budget red is quite incredible value and testimony to the magnificent 2007 vintage in the Southern Rhone. And the barolo, which I had been saving carefully for a special occasion, was corked… you could smell a bit of the magic, but ultimately it was undrinkable…oh well!\n\nTOM: Is it a late surge for corked wine ‘duds’ I wonder? That Pol Roger 1998 is coming up on the rails as this year’s most nominated fizz I think.\n\nPaolo Strada, Italy (but living in Switzerland)\n\nRed: Tenuta delle Terre Nere (Italy-Sicily) – Etna Rosso La Vigna di Don Peppino Prephylloxera 2006\n\nWhite: Emrich Schonleber(Germany) – Monzinger Frühlingsplätzchen Riesling Spätlese 2006\n\nBudget red: Domaine Des Antimagnes (france) – Cotes du Rhone Les Escaravailles 2007\n\nBudget white: Santa Caterina (Italy-Liguria) – Giuncaro 2009\n\nRosé: Chateau La Canorgue (france) – Cotes du Luberon Rose 2009\n\nSweet: Cave du l’Etat du Valais (Switzerland) – Petite Arvine Fletrie 1995\n\nFortified: Mas Amiel (France) – Maury Prestige 15 ans d’Age\n\nDud: Two Hands (australia) – Shiraz Bella’s Garden 2006\n\nThing: My Wedding in Provence in June!!!! And the honey moon in Turks and Caicos\n\nTOM: COngratulations on the wedding Paulo, and for a intriguing list – the pre-Phyyoxera red included.\n\nMatthew Bryan, UK\n\nRed: Dujac (France) Gevrey Chambertin 1er cru Aux Combottes 1998\n\nWhite: Francois Cotat (France) Sancerre Les Culs de Beaujeu 2007\n\nBudget red: AA Cos (Italy) Frappato 2008\n\nBudget white: Jadot (France) Pouilly Fuisse 2008\n\nRosé: Oeil de Perdrix (France) Champagne NV\n\nSweet: Kracher (Austria) NV #8 Traminer 1995\n\nSparkling: Dom Ruinart (France) Champagne 1990\n\nFortified: Fernando de Castilla (Spain) Antique Oloroso\n\nDud: Medal winners from international wine competitions\n\nComment: A rather old world look to the list, I fear, though not through a lack of experimentation. New and exciting experiences have come largely from France and Italy, particularly from tastings at the Oxford offline group – thanks Mark! My favourite bottles of the year, though, are mainly ones where I have been able to experience the full journey of the wine over the course of a good meal and where I have been able to have several glasses. The ethereal nature of the burgundy in particular – perhaps the closest I’ve ever come to a ‘haunting’ wine – would have been lost on me if I’d merely had a single tasting measure. The Cos wine is far from cheap, but it is a unique and stunning wine which I have pressed onto more people than I can remember this year; the Jadot came in at just 6GBP in a sale at TEE and is more than fine for the money. The champagnes were had to celebrate the birth of our daughter in February – the rose at a party and the mesmerising Ruinart with my wife. This was incontrovertible evidence that champagne can be a serious food wine. A word in despatches too for the Sherry – my first foray into ‘serious’ examples of the type and the most mind-blowing wine of the year. The ‘dud’ is, I’m sure, more a reflection on my shortcomings than anything else, but I have become slightly disillusioned with wines that have triumphed in the IWC, DWWA etc. Too many have been bland; seemingly aiming at being generally pleasing without ever scintillating. None of the several I have bought have come close to some fabulous recommendations that I have picked up from wine-pages this year. Thanks to Tom and everyone who contributes to make this such an invaluable resource and fun place to spend time.\n\nTOM: Congratulations on another wine-pages new-born! That Oeil de Perdrix fizz (a permanent fixture in Majestic stores) is always great value for money I think. This year I am swapping from being a judge at the IWC for these past few years to judging the DWWA (Decanter Awards). I hear the judging process is very different, so look forward to seeing how they compare.\n\nAnthony Taylor, UK\n\nRed: Stag’s Leap Vineyards, Cask 23 Cab Sauv 1985 , Napa Valley, California\n\nWhite: Domaine Varoux Grand Cru Bougros 2002 Chablis, France\n\nBudget red: Wynns Coonawarra Estate Cab Sauv 2005, S Australia\n\nBudget white: Zind 1 2007, Domaine Zind-Humbrecht, Alsace\n\nRosé: Charles Melton Rose of Virginia 2008, S Australia\n\nSweet: Chateau Coutet 2001 Barsac, France\n\nSparkling: Henri Giraud En Fut Du Chene 1998, Ay, France\n\nFortified: Unknown Crusted Port (at least 60 yrs old)\n\nDud: Corked Clarendon Hills Astralis on Boxing Day\n\nComment: The Stag’s Leap ended up being one of the great bottles of my life, and finally convinces me of Napa’s ability to create truly great wine. A late choice as it was drunk on Christmas Day. The hardest choice of all was in the sparkling category, with equally honourable mentions to Veuve Cliquot Vintage Rare 1988, Clos De Cazals 1999, and Vilmart Coeur De Cuvee 1998. The Wynns is surely one of the great fine wine bargains in the world, it will only improve with time. The Coutet is also a Christmas day entry, being the first of an EP case. Simply delightful.\n\nTOM: I visited Champagne grower Henri Giraud a couple of years ago and tasted his base wines from barrel, where the Chardonnay could easily have been bottled and passed off as Meursault 1er Cru, being so rich and full. selection below added 06/01/2011\n\nChristiaan Jonkers, UK\n\nRed: Dujac Clos de la Roche 1978\n\nWhite: Coche Dury Meursault Les Chevalieres 2002\n\nBudget red: Coudelet de Beaucastel 2007\n\nBudget white: Olivier Leflaive Bourgogne Les Setilles 2007\n\nRosé: Henri Billiot Rose NV\n\nSweet: Yquem 1989\n\nSparkling: Salon 1988\n\nFortified: Taylors 1977\n\nDud: Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett\n\nThing: Many, but England retaining the Ashes is fresh in my mind\n\nComment: Although not the grandest white I have had this year, the Coche merits its inclusion by being the best village wine I think I have ever had. I was struggling to find a dud, and there is nothing wrong with the Prum, but, try as I might, I just don’t get it.\n\nTOM: That Bourgogne Les Setilles was one I really enjoyed – declassified Puligny and Meursault and good value at £12 or so. JJ Prum is one of those revered names of winemaking, so a brave choice as ‘dud’, but I like that honesty.\n\nPhil David, UK\n\nRed: Jaboulet (France) Hermitage La Chapelle 1979\n\nWhite: JJ Prum (Germany) Wehlener Sonnenuhr Spatlese 1995\n\nBudget red: Clonakilla (Australia) Hilltops Shiraz 2004\n\nBudget white: Steffens Kess (Germany) Rieler Goldlay Riesling 2006\n\nRosé: Larmandier Bernier (France) Rose de Saignee 1er Cru NV\n\nSweet: Mullineaux (South Africa) Straw Wine 2009\n\nSparkling: Pol Roger (France) Chardonnay 1998\n\nDud: Mollydooker (Australia) The Boxer Shiraz 2007\n\nThing: The Bordeaux Index sale\n\nComment: A tough one this year and nowhere more so than the reds. Calling it a shortlist would be a misnomer, for it stretched far and wide; 1999 Mascarello Barolo Monprivato, 1979 La Chapelle, 1999 Gilles Barge Cote Rotie Cote Brune, Palmers 1982 and 1996, 1985 Vina Tondonia GR and 1999 Sorrel Le Greal were all in the mix but finally the ’79 Chap wins it for the combined pleasure of wine and occasion at The Ledbury. I should say that only two of these were directly purchased by me; the rest were supplied by generous fellow diners at various offlines. Riesling certainly supplied the thick part of my white pleasures this year. By no means were they all from the Mosel but the two that made this list just happened to be, Prum’s wonderful Wehlener Sonnenuhr Spat and an equally wonderful basic effort from a slightly more obscure producer, picked at random from an organic Berlin grocery. The two Aussies are an instruction in the folly of geographical generalisation – Clonakilla’s Hilltops is reliably precise and pleasurable for the price point, the Mollydooker almost a parody of Oz Shiraz, packing 16.5% alcohol and fruit so ripe you’re swatting the flies off it. I suspect my sweet of the year would have been Climens 1990 but sadly that was just a snatched sip, while the beautifully pleasurable Straw Wine was consumed with a delightful dessert at the same table as one of its makers. My thing of the year is a salute to the sadistic sod who devised the fiendish Bordeaux Index Price Drop sale, in which participants had to gamble on the prospect of reducing prices against rapidly vanishing stock.\n\nTOM: and as if to prove the point about JJ Prum, the very next entry received has one of his wines as the best of the year.

The Musigny (out of a half kindly shared with me by Rainer Guntermann) was just sublime, what a great Grand Cru should be. The Brand still needed decanting and was supreme. The Ogier was moreish, the Manzone most refreshing and original. Having cut down on sweet things, the Avignonesi was just a rich fruit cake of a wine, while I had the Vilmart several times, it remained an excellent and very reasonable set of bubbles. The Taylors (assuming it was so) was gorgeous, just about mature. No real duds as such but after sublimely good bottles having my last Ceretto of three corked was a pain. Too many things but cutting back and losing weight keeps me on track to be realistically hedonistic, the Highlands for the first time were intoxicating, and of course, beating such luminaries as Linden Wilkie and David Wainwright for the blind tasting challenge shall live on as an example of inspired blagging.\n\nTOM: I’m sure Charles’ winning of the blind-tasting challenge was not ‘blagging’ at all, but a highly experienced palate – as can be witnessed by this list of wines!

A gorgeous Tignanello that was enjoyed at dinner with a fellow forumite and a Chave that shone at a tasting which gave me a glimpse into what good Hermitage Blanc can become become my top two. A meaty and savoury southern French red with real structure that was ludicrously good for the price and a consistently good Chenin from the Loire give me my budget options that I have enjoyed several times. One of only two or three Rosés drunk all year so Hobson’s Choice. I have been treated to, and opened, some fabulous sweet wines this year but this one wins on sheer dollars for value. The first Quartz Reef Vintage bubbly after a three year gap is absolutely outstanding and will make a devious ringer in Champagne tastings. The fortified might fudge the rules for some but this fortified dessert wine was tried at a cave in Beaumes de Venise itself alongside the Domaine de Durban and it won me over. The Janasse is a label that I have enjoyed in the past but this bottle was (alcoholically) hot, soupy and almost verging on the unpleasant which made it a huge disappointment for me. Finally, the arrival of Lena means that you cannot wipe the smile off the face of this very proud father.\n\nTOM: Congratulations on the new baby Mark.

It’s a shame that the only New World wine in the list was the ‘dud’, but I do think Errazuriz’s ‘Wild Ferment’ Pinot Noir is nowhere near as good as the equivalent white, their Chardonnay.

With palate suitably recalibrated, it was a tremendous relief to return to drinking finer wines!\n\nTOM: Interesting experiment! I do think we wine nuts can get out of touch occasionally with what the average supermarket shopper is buying week in, week out, which does indeed tend to be the big brands on some sort of promotional pricing. But good to see from your list that you managed some rather fine wines later in the year (and that you clearly retained an open mind about the quality of which companies like Wolf Blass and Penfolds are capable).\n\nCharles Mutter, UK\n\nRed: Chateau Gloria (St Julien, Bordeaux, France) 2004\n\nWhite: Domaine Leflaive (France) Bourgogne Blanc 2004\n\nBudget red: Gulf Station (Australia) Pinot Noir 2007/8\n\nBudget white: Alfred Merkelbach (Mosel, Germany) Urziger Wurzgarten Auslese 2003\n\nRosé: Chateau d’Aqueria (France) Tavel 2008\n\nSweet: Chateau Coutet (Barsac, Bordeaux, France) 2004\n\nSparkling: Champagne Lahaye (France) Brut Nature NV\n\nFortified: Gonzalez Byass (Jerez, Spain) Matusalem Oloroso Dulce\n\nDud: some “local” cider from our farmers’ market that was in fact vinegar\n\nThing: Kindle mk 3\n\nComment: Gloria drunk at L’Espalier in Boston – perfect.

Kindle preserved my sanity throughout a 3-week concert tour of the US last month.\n\nTOM: Very nice choices.

Dom’ Chevalier is drinking so well at the moment. Thought I’d include a mention for Ch Thenac from Bergerac – almost as good and a third of the price. The Prima Bianco from Casa Mesa on Sardinia shows just what a great grape Vermentino is and celebris was hauntingly good. Please can supermarkets stop making all their reds taste the same – there is actually some good wines tying to break through the obsession with Carbonic maceration and chemical inclusion.\n\nTOM: Fine choices. I published an article on the wonders of white Bordeaux in 2010 and still think these wines are underrated overall.

In many instances I’ve opted for the wine that surprised me most; particularly in the red categories where I had no great expectations from an 03 Barolo (even this one), and who’d have thought that a Spanish Syrah from baking hot Almansa would manage to put me in mind of the northern Rhone? A reminder to me that predjudices are dangerous. I can’t think of any wines that have been real duffers this year, selective memory perhaps, so I’ve slightly cheekily nominated snow – a car trashed in January and a holiday trashed in December. I hope you’ll let it pass this once and I’ll try to find a real horror for next year…\n\nTOM: Terrific list and yes, good to have ones prejudices knocked for six now and again with wine! I will certainly let you away with nominating the snow for your dud of the year as it seems to have impacted you from start to finish of 2010!\n\nselection below added 31/12/2010\n\nJim Fulcher, UK\n\nRed: Penfolds (Australia) Grange Hermitage 1988\n\nWhite: Domaine Rollin (France) Corton Charlemagne 2006\n\nBudget red: Chamonix (South Africa) Rouge 2007\n\nBudget white: Linar de Vides (Spain) Albarino 2002\n\nSweet: Ch Rieussec (France) 1983\n\nSparkling: Champagne Laetitia (France) Grand Cru NV\n\nFortified: Fernando De Castilla (Spain) Palo Cortado\n\nThing: The UK forum Edinburgh Offlines – Always a real pleasure\n\nComment: A lot of really good wines this year and my first steps into Burgundy thanks to some Edinburgh offliners advice and their generosity.

My red, white and sparkler were all flawed in some tiny way but were my WOTY on account of the generosity of those who supplied them. The P-C is the oldest claret I’ve tasted, the Reflets a special act of generosity (a wine I love but can never get). The duds of the past fortnight made my wife comment on how lucky we are in what we serve ourselves. As for my “thing”, you should try it!\n\nTOM: Apart from the top two, another list that celebrates some of the less well-trodden corners of France which is always fascinating – and makes me realise how impossible it is to really stay on top of the whole world of wine. I’ll try that Champagne and Riedel tip – and have noticed a couple of posh restaurants, including the Greenhouse in London last month, offer the choice of Champagne flutes or big, Bordeaux-style glasses when ordering a decent bottle of Champagne.\n\nIve Marx, Belgium\n\nRed: Pichon Lalande ’82 (magnum)\n\nWhite: DRC Montrachet 2000\n\nBudget red: CdR ’07\n\nBudget white: M-S-R ’09\n\nRosé: Canon La Gaffelière ’09\n\nSweet: Gillette CdT ’59\n\nSparkling: Dom P ’90\n\nFortified: something 19th C\n\nDud: Belgian Pinot\n\nThing: corked cork\n\nTOM: I think Ive must work in a top-secret cryptography laboratory deep within a Belgian mountain (?).

The Leflaive is one of my top 3 white wines of all time, drunk at a fabulous restaurant near Hull. The Henschke was my first HoG, and what a way to start with the 1990! The Eszencia is as unctuous as you would expect, and the 1908 Dows, courtesy of feelow UK Wine Forum member Mr Wainwright, was a belter. At the same lunch, the HB88 was curiously flat – a real disappointment. Finally, one of the great memories of the year (and my goodness, there have been many) had to be the Pebbles bike ride. I’ll never forget that. I was very lucky to be involved, and the level of generosity shown by all was humbling. It helped us get over the line.\n\nTOM: Another vote for a Chamonix wine, and great to see that Ray enjoyed his bike ride in aid of The Pebbles Project charity so much, as along with wine-pages visitor Keith Prothero I know he is one of its main UK-based volunteers.\n\nMatthew Hemming, UK\n\nRed: Clos de Tart 1945\n\nWhite: Corton Charlemagne 2000 Bonneau du Matray\n\nBudget red: Bourgogne Pinot Noir 2006 Meo Camuzet\n\nBudget white: Bourgogne Blanc 2006 Roulot\n\nRosé: Bollinger 2002\n\nSweet: Pinot Gris Clos Jesbel SGN 2007 Zind Humbrecht\n\nSparkling: Bollinger 1999\n\nFortified: Merchant Prince Rutherglen Muscat\n\nDud: POX and my (now deceased) car\n\nThing: Beef\n\nComment: Perhaps a boringly predictable list? Neither budget wine was particularly ‘budget’ but they stand out as wines I bought in case quantities at prices at which I was happy to open them in reckless abandon at my 30th birthday lunch. The Bahans HB 2001 I used at the same lunch would also count as it was an auction bargain (~£180/cs!) but the Meo was just nicer. Oeno 1996 competes with the Bolly 1999. The 99 was the last of Mentzendorff’s UK stock and the last disgorgement prior to moving to the 2000. I got mags for the birthday and it was totally delicious.\n\nTOM: Boringly predictable – if that means 1945 Clos du Tart, Grand Cru white Burgundy and rare Champagnes and sweet whites I’ll have some boring predictability too!\n\nChris Hewson, UK\n\nRed: Bovin (Macedonia) Alexandar, Tikves, 2008\n\nWhite: Rolly Gassmann Gewurztraminer (France) Alsace, 2007\n\nBudget red: Paulie Heins Cabernet-Merlot (South Africa) Single Vineyard, 2006\n\nBudget white: Bodegas Naia (Spain) K-Naia, Castilla y LeÃ³n, 2008\n\nSweet: Argyros Vinsanto (Greece), Santorini, 1989\n\nSparkling: Le Mesnil (France) Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru, Champagne, Le Mesnil Sur Oger, 2002\n\nFortified: Grahams 1980\n\nDud: Andean Vineyards (Argentina), Condor Peak Mendoza, 2006\n\nThing: The realisation that 2011 is going to be… interesting\n\nComment: The Bovin was a real eye opener, and the QPR had me reeling to the extent I bought 2 cases on the spot. The Paulie Heins was an inconseqential bottle, bought some time ago from Virgin for little over a fiver – took it to a party, and wished I’d kept it for myself (and in the end virtually did). I could also have mentioned any number of Santorini whites… and their Vinsanto’s are vastly underpriced, albeit the one mentioned is c.£60, most are in the £20’s.\n\nTOM: The Bovin wines are unknown to me, but I will try to rectify that. I like the strikingly modern wines of Bodegas Naia too – alwayd beautifully made.\n\nDavid Ludlow, UK\n\nRed: Chateau Haut Brion 2000\n\nWhite: Vergelegen The White 2006\n\nBudget red: Terrasses de Maynard Saint Chinian – Roquebrun 2007\n\nBudget white: Domaine Magellan Grenache Blanc 2007\n\nRosé: Domaine Ott 2009\n\nSweet: Chateau Doisey-Daene 1989\n\nSparkling: Ridgeview Merret Fitzrovia Rose 2004\n\nFortified: Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Amontillado\n\nThing: Enjoying the late Autumn sunshine in Crete\n\nComment: The Haut Brion 2000 was a fantastic wine, even if I was drinking it several years too young. It pipped a Flacionella 1997 for wine of the year. The white from Vergelegen was one of the white hghlights of the year together with Hamilton Russel Chardonnay 2008, Planeta Cometa 2008 (100% Fiano) and also Pieropan La Rocca Soave 2007. The Amontillado is excellent and has shown up how good the Taste the Difference range can be.\n\nTOM: Château Haut-Brion and its sibling La Mission Haut-Brion are getting a huge number of mentions so far this year – much more than any of the other Bordeaux first growths. As one of my favourite, and I think comparatively under-appreciated estates, I am delighted with that.\n\nTom Hewson, UK\n\nRed: Escoda-Sanahuja (DO Conca de Barbara, Spain) ‘Les Paradetes’ 2006\n\nWhite: Ascheri (Piedmont, Italy) Montelupa Viognier 2005\n\nBudget red: Bodegas Carchelo (Jumilla, Spain) ‘Carchelo’ 2008\n\nBudget white: Sartarelli (Marche, Italy) Verdicchio di Castelli di Jesi ‘Tralivio’ 2008\n\nRosé: Nicodemi (Montepulciano, Italy) Ceruasolo 2008\n\nSweet: Stefano Mancinelli Verdicchio di Castelli di Jesi ‘Goti’ 2007\n\nSparkling: Paul Bara 2000\n\nFortified: Romate Amontillado ‘NPU’\n\nDud: Henri Giraud Code Noir NV\n\nThing: Preservino wine preserving doo-da\n\nComment: This has been a year of Italian discovery for me. Verdicchio surely has the potential to be one of Europe’s greatest white grapes. Mancinelli’s late-harvest ‘Goti’ was one of the wine experiences of the year for me; mad but brilliant. Ascheri’s Viognier is a slap in the face to all those that say the grape doesn’t age well – if Italian merchant Bat and Bottle still have some, buy it (even if it’s a bit late for Christmas lunch this year). Extraordinary stuff. Lastly, the blanc de noirs ‘Code Noir’ from Giraud was burly, coarse and awkward for the price. Oak fermented blanc de noirs champagne is obviously a difficult act to pull off…. some more scribblings at www.tomhewson.com/foodwine\n\nTOM: Another interesting list exploring Spain and Italy. I do agree that the Verdicchio wines of Castelli di Jesi rarely disappoint, and at around £6 or £7 for really good examples in stores like Majestic and Waitrose, there are wines well worth trying.\n\nBenjamin Cain, UK\n\nRed: Beringer, Cab Sauv Reserve, 1994\n\nWhite: Clos de la Coulee de Serrant, 1990\n\nBudget red: Torbreck, The Juveniles, 2001\n\nBudget white:Henksche, Tilly’s Vineyard, 2008\n\nRosé: Dom Perignon Rose, 1986\n\nSweet: Willi Opitz, Opitz 1, 1997\n\nSparkling: Dom Perignon, 1990 Magnum\n\nFortified: Gonzales Byass, Noe\n\nDud: Damargi, Gaja, 1994\n\nThing: A free holiday in L.A courtesy of winning it on Classic FM (UK)\n\nComment: A mixed year wine wise but one where keeping fizz and having the strength not to drink it early has paid off with some glorious bottles.\n\nTOM: We had the pleasure of Torbreck’s owner/winemaker Dave Powell at wine-pages Glasgow ‘miniBOWL’ event in May and the wines went down a storm.

Having to open 4 bottles just to see if the wine is progressing seems rather unfortunate. The Caiarossa is the best modern Tuscan wine I have ever tried, with balance, depth, length and complexity – and acquired for scarcely more than half its usual price in BBR’s sale. The Ãœrziger WÃ¼rzgarten is the most absorbing/tingling so far of a variety of German 2005s that I have waiting for me. I am a serial consumer of Thévenet\\’s wines over 2 decades and the 2005 is the best-balanced vintage he has done in many years, although it strains to qualify as a “budget white”. The De Bortoli has genuine complexity and finesse, as well as another few years of development – an achievement in Australian Chardonnay.\n\nTOM: Oh yes, the Caiarossa is really terrific stuff, and I have been very impressed by it on a couple of occasions. Great to see a vote for Martinborough Vineyard’s PInot too – one of New Zealand’s original Pinot specialists.\n\nCameron Clark, The Netherlands\n\nRed: 1997 Turley Hayne Zinfandel\n\nWhite: 1966 Clos du Petit Demi-Sec, Applias Pere et Fils\n\nBudget red: 1998 Peninsula Estate Hauraki, NZ\n\nBudget white: 1966 Vie-Vie Murfatler Chardonnay, Romanie\n\nRosé:\n\nSweet: 1937 Massandra White Muscat\n\nSparkling: 1996 Mailly Cuvee Les Echansons\n\nDud: Young Left Bank Red Bordeaux\n\nComment: Stand out wine was the desert wine at a recent Xmas meal – the 1937 Massandra White Muscat. Dark brown, caramel and a finish that did not stop. Best wines of the year though were the Murfatlers that were picked up at auction for 10-12 Euro a go. The Tokaj like Chardonnay was the pick of the 3, but I’ve had great bottles of the 64 Pinot Gris and the 66 Mucat. Red wine of the year was a Turley Zin, which astounded a group of us with a finish that also went on for ages. Auctions seen to be where I but most of my interesting wine at the moment and as well as supplying the 2 budget wines and the sweet wine, it also supplied the White wine of the year. Actually bought it but mistake (distracted by Trudi), but its a wonderfully complex wine. Started the year with some good drinking Bordeaux reds (right bank), but finished with a few duff left bank reds for Xmas. I know the summers are getting warmer there, but they’ll never have that wonderful accessability that the New World has.\n\nTOM: Nicely obscure bits amnd pieces in here, and someone else including an aged Romanian white as one of their choices.

The Campuget has grit and character for under a fiver whilst also under a fiver the St Hallet has been our house white all year. Whilst I have tasted many far grander champagnes this year the basic Bolly N/V gets it for being so consistent throughout the whole year, I have tasted it perhaps twenty times this year and on each occasion it has been quite splendid. Two new discoveries, the Isabel sweetie was excellent whilst the Barossa Tawny from David Franz was exceptional.\n\nTOM: A fine list, and that’s the second vote for the white Musar this year – a wine that ususally splits the jury in my experience. Agree on the consistent excellence of the Bolly.\n\nGarry Clark, UK\n\nRed: La Mission-Haut-Brion (France) Pessac-Leognan 2005\n\nWhite: Larrivet-Haut-Brion (France) Pessac-Leognan 2007\n\nBudget red: La Chapelle du Marin (France), Cotes de Rhone 2008\n\nBudget white: Ant Moore (New Zealand) Sauvignon Blanc, Malborough 2010\n\nRosé: Charles Melton (Australia) Rose of Virginia, Barossa 2009\n\nSparkling: Ruinart (France) Dom Ruinart Rose 1990\n\nFortified: Madeira Bual 1935 (producer unknown)\n\nDud: Failing my Court of Master Sommeliers Advanced Exams\n\nThing: Turning some major corners in my life and being stronger and happier in my achievements.\n\nComment: I can’t believe we are back to the end of the year again. The red was kind of hard to pick again, but i chose the La Mission because it shows such amazing potential, yet is accessable and breathtaking. The Larrivet Haut Brion is one of my wiser purchases en primeur, we bought an awful lot of it, but its drinking sublimely just now and again shows amazing potential. Both my budget wines are Boutinot wines and as our supplier they have come up trumps this year, every wine they have brought for us to look at has been a winner, and many of them at the budget end of the market too. My Rose is possibly my favourite, after all these years Charlies wines are still wowing me, this seems to get darker with each passing year, i almost expect a red soon. I’m not a big fan of the sweeties, so struggle to fill this one in. The fizzy was a toss up between the Ruinart Dom Ruinart Rose and the Dom Ruinart Blanc de Blancs, but the rose had the edge due to the added maturity. Stunning. Dud was my failing the Court of Master Sommeliers Advanced Exams. I was woefully underprepared on the theory paper and it flumoxed me. Im pleased that I passed the practical paper though as I was nervous as hell. And my thing this year was just seeming to get my life back on track. I think that last year I was in a bit of a rut, both with work and my personal life, and it all seems to have come together nicely this year. Im fast approaching my seventh year here at the Chester Grosvenor and things are going from strength to strength. Hopefully January will give us some good news on the Michelin front and then we will see where the rest of 2011 takes us. I plan to resit my Court of Master Sommelier exams, having done a lot more studying on Germany!!! Then who knows, maybe I might give the MS a go.\n\nTOM: A fine, postive round-up of your year Garry, and as always some enviable drinking too! La Mission 2005 was a star for me (96-points) in the extraordinary vertical tasting of 50 vintages back to 1929 that I attended a couple of years ago. Good luck on the exam and Michelin fronts for the Chester Grosvenor too – I am long overdue a return visit there.\n\nJeremy Holmes, Australia\n\nRed: E.Pira e Figli Barolo 1971\n\nWhite: Domaine Leflaive Chevalier-Montrachet 2009\n\nBudget red: Claude et Catherine Marechale Bourgogne ‘Gravel’ 2008\n\nBudget white: Tribut Chablis ‘Beauroy’ 2008\n\nRosé: Arrivo Rosato di Nebbiolo 2009\n\nSweet: Yquem 1996\n\nSparkling: Krug 1988\n\nFortified: Sandeman 1945\n\nDud: Corked botts at a Jayer dinner\n\nThing: Cellartracker\n\nComment: Disclaimer: I have sold a couple of these wines and bought plenty for our personal cellar.\n\nTOM: Cracking Euro-centric, indeed euro-classic selection from down under.\n\nJohn Lamond, UK\n\nRed: Chateau Leoville Barton ((France), St. Julien 1989\n\nWhite: Le Clos Blanc de Vougeot (France), Vougeot 2001\n\nBudget red: Palataia Pinot Noir (Germany), Pfalz 2009\n\nBudget white: Jim Barry Lodge Hill Riesling (Australia) Clare, 2007\n\nRosé: Cellier des Esperides (France), Cotes de Provence 2009\n\nSweet: Torcolato (Italy), Veneto 2003\n\nSparkling: Bollinger Grande Annee (France), Champagne, 2000\n\nFortified: Guimaraens (Portugal) Port 1996\n\nDud: Robert Skalli Syrah (France) Languedoc 2008(?)\n\nThing: The sunroom\n\nComment: Discovery of the year was the vast improvement in the quality of M&S’s wine offering\n\nTOM: I had the 2000 vintage of the Leoville-Barton just a couple of evenings ago and it was my Christmas highlight.

I do drink the occasional NZ, Australian, American, Chliean wine etc. but they nearly always seem to not be worth the effort or expense compared to the elegance and completeness of the the terroir-driven wines of Europe. I will keep trying other wines, but I always come back to Europe. Cornas is one of my very favourite wines, and it was a great year for drinking Cornas both from my cellar and at offlines. When I offered to organize an offline centred on Cornas I was overwhlemed by the response and ended up running two back-to-back dinners at 28-50 where we tasted the great and the good of Cornas back to 1983 with most wines being a very great pleasure to drink. The Allemand Reynard from 1991, 1994 and 2001 were highlights, but there were another ten wines of great stature and more importantly of pure pleasure in that line-up – you just have to give these wines time. I have picked out the Allemand Reynard 1991 as my red of the year – it was superb. There\\’s always a danger that wines like Le Montrachet are over-rated on the basis of their appellation alone, but the Jadot 2004 was stunning – perhaps the best dry white wine I have ever drunk (thank you David W). Apart from some of these grand wines, I got much pleasure from some that are very affordable and very available. La Gitana is always a delicious aperitif, and the Domaine de Chevalier rose, while a little recherche, was all you could ask for in a simple, fresh rose wine. On the sweet front, there were many potential contenders this year. One of the good things about offlines is that we often end on a glass of something sweet and this gives me a chance to try more sweet wines than I do at home where consuming a whole bottle (or even half bottle) between two is more of a challenge. Thinking of challenges, it was at Neil Holland\\’s vintage pairs event that I got to taste the Huet Le Mont moelleux 1950 – what nectar. I love old chenin blanc wines. Finally to the dud – my Ch de Beaucastel 1998 was a soupy mess at the Beaucastel vertical early in the year. Very disappointing. Chapoutier’s Chante-Alouette Hermitage blanc 1999 has also been a serial failure when pulled from a case bought en primeur and stored impeccably. Finally, I jsut want to say how much of a pleasure it has been to meet, drink and eat with so many generous and engaging friends from the UK Wine Forum over 2010. It wouldn’t have been the same without them. Here’s to a great 2011 on the wine front.\n\nTOM: If that rosé is from the Domaine de Chevalier in Pessac-Légnan I confess I did not know it existed, let alone know what it tastes like! No need to apologise for a Euro-centric list here, as despite plenty of New World brilliance, surely nobody could deny that Europe is still responsible for so many of the world’s finest expressions of grape and place? selection below added 29/12/2010\n\nRichard Shama,UK\n\nRed: Jaboulet-Aine (France) Crozes Hermitage Thalabert 1990\n\nWhite: Domaine Huet (France) Loire Le Mont Demi Sec 2002\n\nBudget red: Catena / Domaines Baron Rothschild – Lafite (Argentina) Amancaya 2008\n\nBudget white: Tomas Cusine (Spain) Auzells 2008\n\nRosé: Henri Bonnaud (France) Provennce Palettes 2007\n\nSweet: Chateau de Fargues (France) Sauternes 1990\n\nSparkling: Philipponnat (France) Clos des Goises 1996\n\nFortified: Lustau (Spain) Murillo PX NV\n\nDud: K Vintners (USA) All!\n\nThing: Birth\n\nTOM: This is the third vote in for the Philipponnat Clos des Goises 1996 Champagne – makes me even more certain I committed vinous infantacide when I served both of my bottles at a dinner around four years ago…\n\nRonald Massard, Thailand\n\nRed: Domaine Peyre-Rose (France) Clos des Cistes, Coteaux du Languedoc 1998\n\nWhite: Chateau La Nerthe (France) Chateauneuf-du-Pape 2000\n\nBudget red: Domaine du Vissoux (France) Coeur de Vendanges, Beaujolais 2008\n\nBudget white: Ten Minutes by Tractor (Australia) 10X Chardonnay, Mornington 2007\n\nRosé: Horiot (France) Rose des Riceys 2006\n\nSweet: Bernard Plageoles (France) Vin d’Autan, Gaillac 1997\n\nSparkling: Chateau Le Roc (France) Vin Turbulent, vin de table NV\n\nFortified: Seppelt (Australia) GR 113 Rare Rutherglen Muscat, Rutherglen NV\n\nDud: Domaine Germain (France) red Saint Romain 2008\n\nThing: Ex aequo : a mushroom year and young chefs in Paris : Gagnaire-trained Guillaume Delage at Jadis (XVth) and the stellar Petter Nilsson at La Gazzetta (XIIth) – try his “pied de cochon et oursin, oignon doux des Cevennes”. (pig trotter and sea urchin, sweet onion)\n\nComment: At the end of an endless rugged track, I finally saw Marlene Soria’s kingdom at Peyre-Rose : a windy plateau surrounded with odorant bush. She captures the soil austerity and the garrigue scents, controls the alchemy for a number of years (1998 released in 2005). The result reveals natural environment and winemaker’s character : frank and austere, yet delicate and expressive. The 10-year-old white La Nerthe was at its best : powerful and vertical, with a miraculously mineral backbone and profound complexity. No real hit in bubblies this year, so I chose the funny negrette-mauzac frizzante from one of the forefront Fronton (near Toulouse) producers, just ahead of Plageoles’ Mauzac Nature (a delight on strawberries in summer).\n\nTOM: Lovely evocative selection and fascinating to see so many wines from less well-trodden wine roads of France. As I spent some time in the Southwest around Gaillac last year and will do the same again this Spring, I have some new names to look out for.\n\nLinden Wilkie, Hong Kong and UK\n\nRed: Chateau Lafite-Rothschild (France) Pauillac 1870\n\nWhite: Trimbach ‘Clos Ste Hune’ (France) Alsace 1976\n\nBudget red: Penfolds ‘St Henri’ (Australia) 2004\n\nBudget white: Domaine Roulot (France) Bourgogne Blanc 2007\n\nRosé: Sacha Lichine’s Chateau d’Esclans (France)\n\nSweet: Chateau Suduiraut (France) Sauternes 1929\n\nSparkling: Louis Roederer ‘Cristal’ (France) Champagne 1979\n\nFortified: ABLE shipwreck ‘Madeira’ (Portugal) c1800\n\nDud: Domaine Roumier (France) Corton Charlemagne 2003\n\nThing: My son – now 3 months old\n\nComment: A lot of changes in 2010 – the arrival of my first child in September, and a move to Hong Kong in June, while commuting back and forth to the UK (which will continue). Not the best wine of the year, but the most interesting was the circa 1800 ‘Madeira’ I served at an event in December. It sunk with the Able off the Georgia coast in 1840 and was salvaged in 1979, sold at auction in 1980 and then bought by me this year at auction. Still deliciously sweet and fragrant. I’m stretching things a little to say Penfold’s St Henri is a ‘budget red’, but they made such great 2004s and it’s one of the exuberant but superbly balanced wines that is great now, but will age and intrigue for decades I suspect (the ’71 is still going strong).\n\nTOM: As always, an eye-popping list from Linden (who’s job does entail sourcing some of the world’s rarest wine!). In June 2002 that CLos Ste Hune was my Wine of the Month, when it stood out in a vertical tasting of the wine.\n\nRichard Manley, UK\n\nRed: La Rioja Alta Gran Reserva 904 1995\n\nWhite: Karthauserhofberg Auslese 1991 Magnum\n\nBudget red: Potensac 2002 or 2004 both excellent\n\nBudget white: Karthauserhofberg Kabinett 2001\n\nRosé: Moondah Brook 2004\n\nSweet: Vendanges Tardives Gewurztraminer\n\nSparkling: Pol Roger NV Magnum at a friends wedding occasion just made it\n\nDud: A few Burgundy reds\n\nThing: Eldest joining the Army.

I’m surprised to be putting 2 Burgundies down as top wines given the variety of stuff I get through for work and play, but these two were outstanding when I took them along to my Dad\\’s birthday lunch – both did everything you could possibly have wanted of them, delicious and all the better for sharing with the family. The Rueda is an old favourite that I had not had for 3 years or so – stunning stuff for the money if you like lemony crisp whites. Not had much rose this year and certainly nothing to inspire except the bubbly version (sorry Tom, but it IS pink!), this seemingly venerable old thing was delicious, really toasty and complex and a bargain to boot! Plenty has been written about the Straw wine on wine-pages and it’s all true, lovely, lovely wine. The Andre Jacquart is there because it really sticks in the mind as the best fizz I tasted at the CIVC tastings, I have probably had better fizz this year, but this one really stood out. The Warre’s is in a great place right now, drinking superbly. The less said about the bolly the better, although if anyone was in any doubt about what oxidation looked, smelled and tasted like (some brave souls did try it) all doubts have now been banished. My son (4) came up to me in January and said he was worried about the birds not getting enough food so could we make a bird-table? I finally found a use for all those box-ends that I had been keeping for reasons unknown even to me. It’s been great to meet so many people from the UK wine forum at the events I’ve been to this year, lots of good food, good fun and good company. Here’s to an even better 2011. Cheers!\n\nTOM: Sounds like you had a great year in many ways Chris, and indeed there are several wines in your list that could easiy have been in my selection, including the very characterful little budget red from Portugal, and Chris and Andrea Mullineaux’s Straw Wine, which I had again just last week! selection below added 27/12/2010\n\nNigel Pulsford\n\nRed: Vieux Telegraphe Southern Rhone Mag 1981\n\nWhite: Sarda Mallet L’insouciant Languedoc 2009\n\nBudget red: Mugneret Gibourg Bourgogne Rouge 2003/4\n\nBudget white: Pierre Yves Colin-Morey Bourgogne Blanc 2007\n\nRosé: Domaine Tempier Bandol Rose Provence 2007\n\nSweet: Doisy Daene Sauternes 2005\n\nSparkling: Pol Roger NV\n\nFortified: Warre Porto Vintage 1983\n\nDud: Hosanna Pomerol 1999\n\nThing: Arcade Fire – The Suburbs\n\nComment: Lots of great wine – bought too much which means I’ll have to drink too much…\n\nTOM: Why is buying wine even easier than drinking it?

Wishing all other forumites and their families a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!\n\nTOM: And more congraulations obviously due here Simon.

Not that I don’t love Cornas, but the best of the year? Well, I don’t know if it really was the best of the year, but it was the most memorable, in terms of being my favourite wine at the best UK Wine Forum offline of the year – the first Rhone offline at 28-50. One of those nights where just about everything was in perfect condition. The Leflaive was from Bobby’s offline at The Fish Club, although the 1985 Combettes could have got the nod. The 1995 Oenotheque was also from that night and I liked it enough to go out and buy some – ahead of the 1996, for me. Other than that, odd not to see any Italian wines in the list – just funny how things worked out.\n\nTOM: Lovely list, and greay when a relatively (emphasis on the relatively) moderst wine like the Cornas can be the most memorable. And one of every wine lover’s dreams, to have a proper cellar at home.\n\nIan Crawford Amstad, UK but living in USA\n\nRed: Chateau La Conseillante (France) Pomerol\n\nWhite: Coche Dury Meursault (France) 1996\n\nBudget red: Vietti Perbacco (Italy) Piedmont 2007\n\nBudget white: Gavi di Gavi, many producers (Italy)\n\nRosé: Chateau Minuty (France) Provence\n\nSweet: Chateau D’Yquem (France) Sauternes 1970\n\nSparkling: Champagne Billiot (France) 2002\n\nDud: 2010 – not a great year\n\nThing: Volvo XC60\n\nComment: I mainly content myself drinking Bordeaux, burgundy and Piedmont these days. As for vinous highlights La Conseillante is my wine of the year and I enjoyed three examples: 1989 (‘won’ our vertical in April), 1982 (much better in August) and 1990 (my wotn in a 1990 horizontal in Dec). The most mesmerising wine was certainly La Tache 1985, and from Bordeaux Mouton 1995 ‘won’ our ‘Paris ’76 Revisited’ event ‘beating’ Harlan and Bryant. Leoville Barton 2001 is as good as it gets at a reasonable price point. Lots of good barolos and barbarescos too, the stand out being Giacosa’s Rabaja Riserva 2001, it will turn out to be really something in 15-20 years. Cappellano remains my ‘go to’ producer, however.\n\nTOM: Lot’s of terrific wines in Ian’s year obviously, so the Conseillant and Molitor did very well to win! Funnily enough 2010 was a year when Gavi really won me over too – many of them much brighter and more zingy than I’d often found. selection below added 24/12/2010\n\nKeith Prothero, UK and South Africa\n\nRed: Palmer 1961\n\nWhite: Jadot Chevalier-Montrachet “Les Demoiselles” 1985\n\nBudget red: Vincent Paris St Joseph 2007\n\nBudget white: Musar 2001\n\nSweet: Yquem 1950\n\nSparkling: Vilmart Cuvée Creation 1999\n\nFortified: Leacock Solera 1808\n\nDud: Beaucastel 1998\n\nThing: Pebbles now looking after over 600 children\n\nComment: Another brilliant year of UK Wine Forum ‘offlines’, with my highlight being the Charity Dinner for Pebbles with Jancis Robinson. At this dinner we were fortunate to taste some great bottles with the Palmer 61, Yquem 50 and Leacock Solera 1808 being absolutely sensational. Love the wines of Vincent Paris and the St Joseph is excellent value for money, especially as I bought three cases at the cellar door for less than E10 a bottle. The 2001 Musar blanc is a truly outstanding wine, and an absolute steal at under £15. Many thanks as always to Tom for the Forum and to everyone who contributed their time, money, company, and/or bottles for various Pebbles fund raising events in the year.\n\nTOM: Keith’s fund-raising work for the South African charity The Pebbles Project is tireless, so I am glad he at least gets to drink some half-decent plonk!\n\nDerek Salmon, Australia\n\nRed: Bethany LE Shiraz\n\nWhite: Peter Lehmann Wigan Eden Valley Riesling\n\nBudget red: Pikes Eastside Cab Sav 2008\n\nBudget white: Yalumba Pewsey Vale Riesling 2010\n\nSweet: D’arenberg The Mud Pie\n\nSparkling: Krug Rosé\n\nFortified: Seppeltsfield Paramount Collection Tokay\n\nDud: Henschke Hill of Grace 2006\n\nThing: Expecting First child / First Head Chefs Posistion\n\nComment: Some great wines tasted and wine dinners attended.

I have tasted that 1990 Mouton a couple of times, but not for eight years I see from my records.

The top red was the hardest – early highlights included my favourite totally unready wine, with a barrel sample of Chateau Margaux 2009, and finished with some lovely wines like Cos 1929 and Palmer 1961, but it was the Jayer, drank at Michel Bras over a wonderful dinner that really made the biggest imprint. It didn’t last long, but for 30 minutes that wine soared from the glass, in my imagination oozing its aromas over the lip of the glass and covering the entire table. Another very notable wine was the Charvin 07 – never have I had such filth in a glass. Everything about the winemaking and intentions I like the sound of, but the result was sickly beyond redemption. Must try it again at some point in the future. I’ve also been a convert to drag-less fly reels. When I rarely catch anything, and when I do its tiny, whats the point of titanium-carbon braking systems that weigh a tonne and make a racket when you can use your thumb instead.\n\nTOM: A very classic selection there, and all European – but at least that includes the ‘dud’ 🙂 I haven’t tasted the Charvin ’07, but know it has something of jury-splitter, with some finding the sweetness and oak overdone.\n\nJem Netley, UK\n\nRed: Cahuil Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chile) Leyda Valley, 2008\n\nWhite: Viognier Roussane, Romaneaux Destezet (France) 2007\n\nBudget red: Château de Caraguilhes Rouge (France), Corbières, 2006\n\nBudget white: The Naked Grape Riesling (Germany) Pfalz, 2008\n\nRosé: Chateau d’Esclans (France) Garrus 2008\n\nDud: Originel, Clos de la Bruyere (France) Courtois\n\nComment: The Originel wasn’t so much a dud, as not what I was expecting.
