        "text": "Following malicious media attacks by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp media outlets since signing a letter in support of ethical reporting of conflict in Gaza, Antoinette Lattouf has been fired from ABC, and Nova Podcasts axed Clementine Ford’s award-winning podcast. At least three other journalists have faced targeted accusations and smear campaigns from Murdoch’s media, including Patricia Karvelas, Lauren Dubois, and Jan Fran. All reported negative impacts on their abilities to do their jobs. The Coalition For Women In Journalism and Women Press Freedom is alarmed by the attempts to discredit the journalists and urges media outlets to maintain ethical journalistic standards and not resort to smear campaigns against those who do not follow a particular narrative while reporting on the conflict.\n\nCritics argue that Australian mainstream media, including numerous outlets owned by Murdoch's News Corp, exhibits a pro-Israel bias in its coverage of the Gaza conflict. In response to the perceived bias, over 270 Australian journalists signed a public letter calling for media organizations to adhere to ethical standards when reporting on the war. The journalists called for adequate coverage of credible allegations of war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and apartheid.\n\nFive women journalists who have criticized the Australian press’ coverage or have reported on the conflict reveal that they have been subjected to smear campaigns, misleading reports, and slander by news outlets owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch.\n\nAntoinette Lattouf\n\n“Another Murdoch hit piece against me today. It’s now so common I can set an alarm to it. There are so many important stories in this country, but that’s not their business model,” wrote ABC Radio National Breakfast presenter Patricia Karvelas in response to an article about her in News Corp-owned The Australian.\n\nKarvelas, a routine target of smear campaigns, took to Instagram to refute The Australian’s claims about her apparent bias regarding the Gaza conflict. News Corp’s The Australian wrote that Karvelas “appears to support the Albanese government’s ceasefire position” after engaging in a discussion on the call for a ceasefire with journalist Samantha Maiden. The article also said Karvelas had joined “the chorus of leftists” in its views on the viral video that Lattouf investigated for Crikey outlet.\n\nClementine Ford, a writer, public speaker, advocate, and feminist, has consistently expressed her views on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and criticized the way mainstream media covers the conflict. As a result, Ford has been the subject of articles making misleading claims about her stance, labeling her an antisemite for her pro-Palestinian stance.\n\n“There’s a highly defamatory petition being circulated that outright labels me an antisemite. People are tearing the covers off my books in department stores. It’s insanity,” Ford says.\n\nFord told The Australian that any suggestion she is anti-Semitic is “ludicrous.” “I am the granddaughter of a Lithuanian concentration camp survivor whose father was shot and killed by German soldiers and who lost her whole family in WWII. In opposing the indiscriminate slaughter of thousands, I not only honor her memory but also stand alongside countless Jewish activists and leaders who have fought for decades for Palestinian liberation,” the author explains. “Anti-Semitism is real, and we should all oppose it vigorously,” Ford added.\n\nThe writer revealed the personal toll of the attacks, including severe online trolling and financial losses: \"I’ve lost one major contract and had it explicitly outlined to me that it’s because my focus on Palestine is ‘risky’ for their business.\"\n\nIn a video on Instagram, Fran responded, describing a portion of The Daily Mail article. \"There’s a bit in the body of the piece where they say, ‘Fran took aim at the journalism industry, labeling it a malevolent, biased, agenda-driven institution controlled by lobby groups.’ No, I f_ing didn’t. What I said was I don’t blame the people who think that of the media industry. The whole point of my piece was the opposite – that often, it is not, that journalists act righteously. They believe that they’re doing a good thing. See, this is what The Daily Mail does – they steal people’s work, they misquote it, they put it out to their following, and then those people get trolled for things they didn’t say.\"\n\nMurdoch’s Media Empire in Australia\n\nSince the escalation of conflict in the Middle East following Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7, Western media outlets have been struggling to report on the conflict with objectivity and sensitivity. CFWIJ has documented numerous cases of journalists facing backlash from their employers and online trolls for expressing their views or reporting on the conflict. This incident in Australia is made even more troubling by the claims of the journalists that the media owned by Murdoch is targeting them.\n\nMurdoch’s News Corp owns a majority of Australia's metropolitan print mastheads, popular news websites, radio interests, and a majority share in the Foxtel news network. Rupert Murdoch's impact on the Australian media landscape is extensive, playing a pivotal role in shaping public opinion, influencing political decisions, and contributing to ongoing debates on social and political issues. Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd went so far as to label Murdoch's control over the industry as a \"cancer on democracy.”\n\nThe Coalition For Women In Journalism and Women Press Freedom denounces the targeted assaults on journalists reporting on the Gaza conflict and raises mounting concerns about media bias and the pervasive influence of Murdoch's News Corp. We stand in solidarity with these women and all journalists who face such reprehensible tactics. The targeted attacks and professional repercussions faced by these journalists are not only detrimental to their individual careers but also pose a serious threat to the principles of free press and ethical journalism. We urge a critical examination of the power dynamics and influence wielded by entities like News Corp in shaping public discourse in Australia. Media outlets must uphold ethical standards and resist resorting to smear campaigns. We also call on ABC and Nova Podcasts to critically examine their decisions following the fallout and demand an internal investigation is conducted to examine the flawed processes that led to their dismissal. It is essential for the media to remain a platform for diverse voices and perspectives, ensuring a well-informed public and a vibrant democratic society."
