        "text": "It’s awesome. We’re all very proud of the story that we submitted about the Christian Democratic Party and this coup d’etat in state politics in New South Wales. And we all had so much fun working on it together.\n\nPat did an amazing job on the graphics. I’m not a state political reporter, I’ve never worked in Canberra, so for us it was really exciting to get to go into New South Wales parliament. We wanted to have the graphics sit within that space, and he did a great job of doing that.\n\nAnd then Jack Tulleners, this was his first edit of a feature. I sat with him through that process and I had a very clear vision about how it would look, from the music to the references, like House of Cards and quite Shakespearian, dramatic stuff.\n\nPicking up an award from the Walkleys for your first edit, that’s a pretty big honour!\n\nYeah. It’s a big office joke, because we’re notorious, we have a funny relationship — when he started at The Feed I always told him I’m his mentor, and I’m going to take him to the big heights of wherever. We gave him the nickname, JT, and we just love working together. I’m sure he probably wouldn’t say the same, but we’ve loved working together. This is just really great that for his first edit he’s won a Walkley. It’s pretty astounding, and he’s pretty happy about it.\n\nJT is so young and he’s got a Walkley. He’s set from here. I don’t think he ever expected that. That’s going to change things for him. I’m sure he’s going to increase his rate as an editor, which is not good for me. But to be honest, it’s nice to have recognition. We were very proud of that story, and lots of people had great things to say. It wasn’t a viral hit, but I really think we did a good job of turning something that could have been a boring state political story into something that will engage someone who maybe isn’t interested in politics and engage people in the process of democracy.\n\nTell us a little bit of the story behind this particular yarn. How did you come across it? How did it develop?\n\nThis is a classic example of something that happens in the industry a lot — you see an article that exists already. It was being reported on, that there had been this attempted coup of the Christian Democratic Party, and it was by this 18-year-old. The leader of the Christian Democratic Party is infamously Fred Nile and he’s 84. Just that, on paper, is already an exciting story of young ambition in a party that’s very conservative.\n\nI was reading it and thought ‘this is going to get buried as a state political story, and no one’s ever going to see who the characters are’. And that’s what you look for when you’re making documentaries or features, working in video production — who are your characters? Who are the people that are going to carry the story? For this story, all the characters were there, I just needed to bring them to life and, hopefully, get them all to agree to talk to me on camera.\n\nThat was an obstacle. Fred did not want to speak to us. He’s an old man. He probably won’t respond to an email or a phone call — he’ll probably respond to being met in person, so I thought, why don’t we just go to state parliament and try and meet him? It’s public, what he has on in parliament, so I knew that he was going to be there on that day.\n\nWe just waited in the foyer, and then when he went from place to place, I just asked him again and again. At one point in the conversation I said, “You’ve never seemed scared of an interview, Fred, over the course of your career in politics.” And he said, “You’re right. I’ve never been scared of an interview, Martin.”\n\nI said, “Well, just sit down with us, we’ll have a chat.” On the second or third time, he said, “All right, why don’t you come to this event I have on?” It was like a conservative meeting, a talk on political correctness and why it’s gone wrong, and Fred was there as a dignitary. During the filming of that, Fred fell asleep. He invited us to a press conference that he napped at.\n\nThen later when I asked him in the chambers, when he finally agreed to do an interview, he said, “I never nap. I don’t nap in parliament. I’ve never done it.” And we just knew that we had this footage of him dozing off several times. I mean, I would too if I was his age and still in parliament.\n\nSo we had everyone on interview. We interviewed all the characters and people involved. And Fred was the last person, the last piece of the puzzle.\n\nWhat are the best things for you about working at a show like The Feed?\n\nThe work that The Feed does, it opens up a window into other people’s experiences and we tend to tell quite heartfelt, authentic stories. That’s our style, it’s different to the way the 7:30 Report or Four Corners may approach things, they have quite a traditional approach. We’re a young team, everyone’s under 30, pretty much, and the way that we’ve seen the world, growing up, has been different.\n\nI think we reflect that in the way we approach stories. I certainly think about that when I’m making things. There are so many overlaps of people’s experiences, so you’ve got to be creative in the way that you think about approaching them.\n\nI had a submission for “Wage Theft” that I was nominated for last year. I did a lot of reporting around how wage theft and wage exploitation discriminates against the migrant community, who were too scared to speak out because they fear being sent back to their home country. I was quite proud of that reporting, and I do think it has led to social change. Not my story, necessarily, but just all the reporting that was done last year on wage theft has led to real change, giving a platform to employees that have been ripped off up to millions and millions of dollars. We’re now seeing that it’s become a crime in Victoria.\n\nWhat was it that first drew you into the idea of a career in journalism?\n\nI started working in entertainment and I found it a little bit vacuous and non-fulfilling, to be honest. I was working in music journalism and entertainment, and I loved that because I was 21 and I got to go to festivals and shows all the time. I had a great lifestyle. It was very fun.\n\nBut eventually I did feel like I wanted to do a bit more, get my teeth stuck into a bit more. I studied an arts degree at university, but it sparked my interest in lots of different topics, including politics. I studied refugee policy and migration, and I became fascinated by some of those things. I was also exploring my own cultural heritage. My mom migrated to Australia in 1975, from Lebanon. I found it fascinating going back into that history, and it made me want to try to tell other migrant stories while I was finding out about my own and my mother’s.\n\n“There’s a lot of mistrust towards certain media outlets, this all-encompassing idea that anything you read anywhere will be untrue, and that’s a really scary world to live in”\n\nWhat is your personal message to Australians about the importance of journalism and public interest journalism to the strong functioning of society?\n\nNow more than ever we need good journalism — strong, thorough journalism. Unfortunately we’re seeing a lot of institutions eroded, people’s jobs being lost. And that’s sad to see. I’m grateful every day that I have a job and SBS has been amazing through the pandemic in offering flexibility to their staff. I had to lock in with my parents and I was able to continue working.\n\nThat led to me doing better stories, anyway — that flexibility allowed me to continue to work, but in a way that suited the way things were going. It’s unfortunate, but online there’s a lot of polarisation and division about news sources and what you can trust and what you can’t.\n\nI’m hearing it from my extended family, from my friends — there’s a lot of mistrust towards certain media outlets. It’s this all-encompassing idea that anything you read anywhere will be untrue, and that’s a really scary world to live in.\n\nMarty Smiley is a reporter and producer at The Feed, a half hour show that airs nationally on SBS at 10pm on Tuesdays. Since 2018, Marty’s been making short and long form stories for the program, most notably producing two half hour documentaries: “#YesAllMen” about toxic masculinity and “End Of Britain?” about Brexit’s impact on young people. In the last year Marty has focused on migrant stories. He conducted an investigation into how wage theft disproportionately affects migrants. “Shadow Workers” proved to be a shocking snapshot of the life of international students and asylum seekers trying to make a living in Australia.\n\nJack Tulleners is a Brisbane-born shooter/editor. He interned at The Feed during film school and was hired as a production coordinator and then promoted to a shooter/editor. Jack is comfortable shooting and editing anything from celebrity interviews to documentaries and even sketch comedy. He has recently gone freelance as a producer/shooter."
