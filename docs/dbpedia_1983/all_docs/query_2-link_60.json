        "text": "The Sydney Morning Herald’s chief investigative reporter, Kate McClymont, has been honoured with the Walkley Award for outstanding contribution to journalism in recognition of her fearless reporting spanning more than three decades.\n\nNow a winner of 10 Walkley Awards for excellence in journalism, McClymont’s contribution to the industry has previously been recognised by an appointment as a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) and induction to the Australian Media Hall of Fame. She has won many other awards.\n\nMcClymont’s reporting has held the powerful to account and uncovered corruption, fraud and criminal enterprise across politics, business, sport and wider society. Her investigations are synonymous with some of the biggest scandals and stories in Sydney and Australian public life.\n\nPerhaps best-known for her coverage of corrupt former NSW Labor MP Eddie Obeid, McClymont’s revelations resulted in Obeid being jailed not once but twice for his conduct in public office.\n\nMcClymont also exposed allegations of inappropriate conduct against High Court judge Dyson Heydon and revealed serious misconduct by television star Don Burke.\n\nHer coverage in the Herald and on 60 Minutes of neurosurgeon Charlie Teo’s treatment of his patients led to sanctions against the controversial neurosurgeon.\n\nShe led the coverage of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs’ NRL salary-cap scandal, which resulted in the team losing all its competition points and being fined $500,000.\n\nAn investigation into the then ALP national president Michael Williamson and the Health Service Union’s east branch forced him off the party’s executive.\n\nMcClymont also delved into the mysterious world of Sydney fraudster Melissa Caddick, helming the hugely successful, Walkley-nominated Liar Liar, which has now recorded more than 6 million downloads.\n\nHerald editor Bevan Shields said McClymont was a “powerhouse of Australian journalism”.\n\n“Her enthusiasm for the yarn is legendary, as is her willingness to mentor younger colleagues,” Shields said.\n\n“She is generous to a fault with contacts, tips and encouragement to fellow reporters. Colleagues admire her fearlessness in the face of threats to her safety, and her ability to pry information from reluctant sources. She is a legend of our industry and recognition of this status is long overdue.”\n\nThe Herald’s economics editor Ross Gittins, a recipient of the same award in 2020, was one of several industry leaders to support McClymont’s nomination, saying: “In a highly competitive profession not noted for its willingness to mentor potential rivals, Kate’s record of encouraging and training many younger colleagues stands out.\n\n“It adds a further significant dimension to her selfless contribution to both the profession and the public interest. She is a woman of whom all journalists can be proud.”\n\nHerald senior writer Jacqueline Maley said in the nomination that McClymont “is collegiate, warm and will always serve the story ahead of serving herself”.\n\nKirsty Thomson, the executive producer of 60 Minutes, said: “It’s a rare achievement in the highly competitive world of journalism but Kate is almost universally admired and respected by both her colleagues and rivals."
