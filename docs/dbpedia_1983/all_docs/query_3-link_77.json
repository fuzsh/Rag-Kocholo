        "text": "​​​​​​​​​​​​Australian values based on freedom, respect, fairness and equality of opportunity are central to our community remaining a secure, prosperous and peaceful place to live. Our values define and shape our country and they are a reason why so many people want to become Australian citizens. Our democratic institutions and shared Australian values have created our peaceful and stable society.\n\nAustralian values include:\n\n​respect for the freedom and dignity of the individual\n\nfreedom of religion (including the freedom not to follow a particular religion), freedom of speech, and freedom of association\n\ncommitment to the rule of law, which means that all people are subject to the law and should obey it\n\nparliamentary democracy whereby our laws are determined by parliaments elected by the people, those laws being paramount and overriding any other inconsistent religious or secular “laws\"\n\nequality of opportunity for all people, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, race, or national or ethnic origin\n\na 'fair go' for all that embraces:\n\n​mutual respect\n\ntolerance\n\ncompassion for those in need\n\nequality of opportunity for all\n\nrecognising the English language as the national language, and as an important unifying element of Australian society.\n\nThese values are outlined in the Australian Values Statement (AVS) that visa applicants must sign. When you sign the AVS, you acknowledge those Australian values and undertake to conduct yourself in accordance with these values. The aim of the AVS has been to help new residents understand the values that have helped to create a society that is stable and cohesive but, at the same time, dynamic and ​diverse. The Australian Government has changed the AVS to make it more meaningful and to reflect the importance we place on the values that define and shape our country and culture.​​\n\n​"
