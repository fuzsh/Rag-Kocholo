        "text": "Annabel Crabb is one of Australia's most beloved journalists. She is an ABC writer and presenter who has covered Australian politics for 20 years but also is nationally well-known for her insightful and humorous analysis on gender and current affairs. Annabel has written and presented six seasons of the ABC's enormously popular Kitchen Cabinet, as well as the groundbreaking documentary series on life inside Parliament, The House, With Annabel Crabb. She also presents Back In Time For Dinner, the top-rating ABC series on Australian history and food, and co-starred in Tomorrow Tonight with Charlie Pickering.\n\nShe is the creator and presenter of Ms Represented, which is a raw and honest account of politics from the female perspective.\n\nOver her career in journalism Annabel has worked as a political correspondent for The Advertiser, The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald, as Europe correspondent for Fairfax's Sunday titles and written a popular syndicated newspaper column on politics and social affairs. She is the author of The Wife Drought, a humorous and best-selling account of women and work in Australia. Her Quarterly Essay about Malcolm Turnbull, Stop At Nothing, won Annabel a Walkley Award and was expanded and republished as a book in 2016.\n\nShe received two Logie nominations in 2013 including the Graham Kennedy Award For Most Outstanding New Talent and Most Popular New Female Talent for her work on the show.\n\nAnnabel has written cookbooks, Special Delivery and Special Guest: Recipes for the Happily Imperfect Host, with childhood friend Wendy Sharpe.\n\nWith friend and ABC colleague Leigh Sales, Australia's pre-eminent current affairs journalist, Annabel hosts the cult podcast Chat 10 Looks 3 where the pair discuss books, film, culture and cooking. Their first book together, Well Hello, was published in 2021.\n\nIn 2011, Annabel travelled to the United States as Australia's Eisenhower Fellow to study developments in digital media and politics. She is a regular face on ABC TV's election night and Budget broadcasts, and has a long history of appearances on ABC's Insiders programme and across the ABC radio network.\n\nAnnabel boasts the awkward distinction of being Twitter's most-followed Australian journalist, with an audience of over half a million."
