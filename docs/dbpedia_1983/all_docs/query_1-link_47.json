        "text": "Invocation\n\nOh lord and giver of all good, we praise thee for our daily food.\n\nMay Rotary friends and Rotary ways help us to serve thee all our days.\n\nQuote for the month\n\nPaul Percy Harris the founder of Rotary made some forthright comments on War and Peace.\n\nIt is easier to interest men in war than in peace; it therefore requires more moral courage to talk peace than war.\n\n'The Rotarian February 1917.'\n\nMust the best genius of men be devoted to the science of war and none to the science of averting it.\n\n'The Rotarian February 1940.'\n\nWar is a ghastly blunder; even the winners lose.\n\n'My Road to Rotary.'\n\nI have no hesitation in saying that world peace could be achieved and made permanent if reared on Rotary's firm foundation of friendliness, tolerance, and usefulness.\n\n'Addressing the 1940 Rotary Convention, Havana Cuba.'\n\nWill the world's leaders ever learn!!!\n\n...............................................................................................................\n\nRotary Theme for the month of April\n\nMaternal and Child Health\n\nGUEST SPEAKERS URGENTLY NEEDED TO FILL VACANCIES. TEAM LEADERS NEED TO FIND APPROPRIATE SPEAKERS FOR MEETINGS ON THE 1ST AND 3RD THURSDAY OF EACH MONTH.\n\nLET KEITH ADAMS KNOW (email or phone) WHEN YOU HAVE A SPEAKER AS HE MAINTAINS THE RECORDS.\n\nPLEASE ALSO LET THE BULLETIN EDITOR KNOW SO THAT DETAILS CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE DUTY ROSTER.\n\n................................................................................................................\n\nIMPORTANT MESSAGE\n\nCAR PARKING - YALUMBA WINERY\n\nWe have agreed to supply personnel services to assist with parking of vehicles on the following dates- 6th May, 7th May and 8th May.\n\nYalumba Winery at Angaston are hosting the Barossa Valley version of \"Tasting Australia\". Four(4) sessions over the 3 days, 2 on Saturday 7th May. Require say 20 volunteers over the 3 days.\n\nShould be nothing arduous, just making sure that cars are parked efficiently in Yalumba Winery car park. Would expect that each shift would take about 1 hour.\n\nRotary stands to make about $500.00 from this event.\n\nPeter Perkins\n\nMobile: 0409 768 908\n\n................................................................................................................\n\nPast President Keith - His remarks\n\nWelcome to our new home. As was communicated after the meeting on 31st March, the outcome of the voting for our club meetings venue was Tanunda Hotel = 18, Wanera = 15. Thanks to everyone who participated.\n\nSandie says Thank You to all the Rotary Polio Ute Raffle ticket sellers, our clubâs allocation of tickets has added $400 to our contributions to the Rotary District 9510 Foundation.\n\nBill and Sandie have again organised the first prize, which is the âFly The Barossaâ package consisting of two nights at Rogasch Cottage, courtesy of Jan and Craig Rogasch, a wine tasting and two bottles of Bethany Wines, thanks to Geoff Schrapel, two ten minute helicopter rides with Barossa Helicopters, and our club is donating four adult tickets to the 2023 Barossa Airshow and a twenty minutes glider flight. President Bill and Sandie will attend the Rotary District 9510 Foundation lunch on Sunday 15th May, when the raffle prizes will be drawn.\n\nRegards the District Conference, it was good for me to meet old friends from Mitcham and catch up with what is happening at my old club.\n\nWe were well represented at the Conference. Bryce was assisted by Sandie and President Bill with a Showcase display about our clubâs ring pulls project âRing Pulls Transform Livesâ. Many attendees picked up flyers and several were unaware that this project is ongoing, so they now know what to do with the collections they have at home! Weâve shared information about the project with other clubs for their newsletters and itâll be mentioned in the next edition of the District Classifieds. We ran a competition for attendees to guess how many ring pulls in the jar, the prize being a magnum of Jim Barry Riesling. Forty-three entries were recorded, ranging from 896 to 10,101!! Nelson Petersen of Adelaide Uni Rotaract Club won with a guess of 1890, only 27 off the 1863 in the jar! (Bryce counted them twice to be sure, to be sure!)\n\nThe Soapbox presentation about the Airshow was well received and generated several questions at later breaks. The Sunday BBQ lunch was a great success with us serving up about 300 lunches that gave the departing attendees a pleasant memory of their final act at the conference.\n\nIn early June there will be a massive Rotary Showcase at Adelaide University, to which the public will be invited.\n\nThere are several things on the go this month including\n\n2023 Airshow Committee meeting will be on Tuesday next week, if you have any interest in assisting in the planning of the airshow, please talk to me or a committee member.\n\nThe Nuri clothing bin will be back in action soon so the collectors need to be ready. I am scheduled for 29th April to 12th May. The problem is I will be in the Flinders Hospital from the 5th May to the 7th May and will not be very mobile in the following days. I will need someone to fill in for me for 8 days. (As a kid. I had an accident on my bike and damaged my urethra. Scar tissue has built up so they are going to remove it.)\n\n..............................................................................................\n\nDONATIONS IN KIND\n\nGuest Speaker David Cockshell. David joined the Gawler Light Rotary Club in 2001. Since then he has held many positions, including President in 2005/6. Since 2010 he has held the position of Chairman/Regional Manager of DIK Central Region. In 2020 David received the RI Service Above Self recognition for his work and commitment to DIK. Those of us who have seen the enormous changes at DIK know how much work David has done since he took over the role of regional manager.\n\nDIK is a major program of RAWCS which is split into five regions. David manages Central Region which started in 1992. The major objective of DIK is the collection of goods and distributing them to needy communities. The goods collected/donated include medical supplies and instruments, dental and hospital equipment and furniture, school books, desks and chairs along with computers, sewing machines, toys and clothes - a wide range of quality goods that can be beneficial to another country. Hospitals have been a huge source of useful goods, much of which is sent to third world countries such as SW Pacific, SE Asia and Africa.\n\nFreight costs are never cheap and range from $3000 to $11,000 depending on the size of the container and destination country.\n\nGoods for local beneficiaries include wheelchairs and domiciliary equipment. DIK is not just a humanitarian service as much of the goods collected are beneficial to someone else with less going to landfill.\n\nOver the years several of our members have worked at DIK packing containers, including for Myanmar and Tuvalu and Africa. DIK usually has an annual working day when up to fifty or so Rotarians and friends spend a day working as directed with a BBQ lunch provided. You will come home tired. However, it is an opportunity for Rotarians to enjoy some hard work and aching bones. Recommended to all those who have never taken part.\n\nFinally with the change in Royal Adelaide Hospitals (the old to the new) a huge amount of surplus equipment was directed and collected for DIK. It was the largest single Rotary Project undertaken in South Australia. Similar good from Calvary Hospitals have been collected. With the outbreak of COVID DIK was able to provide equipment for SA Health, particularly beds that were needed for contingency management of the pandemic locally. Past President Keith Millington thanked David for his very interesting talk supported by acclamation from those present. He then handed him the usual small gift.\n\nPPs Sue and Keith thanked David for his excellent presentation\n\n................................................................................................................\n\nDistrict 9510 Conference.\n\nGovernor Jeff Neale with his RIPPR Dennis Shore,\n\nPDG from D9800\n\nEditor's notes:\n\nThis was the 24th District Conference I have attended in my 38 years of Rotary.\n\nI attended the Rotary Foundation Breakfast on Saturday morning April 2nd at the Weintal Motel. Approximately fifty people attended. Speaker at the breakfast was Alexandra Rose a Rotary Peace Scholar. Alex is already a highly credentialled graduate of the University of Queensland, experienced in working in a number of different cultures and fluent in several languages. Alexandra has now been offered a fully funded Master's Degree Course at Duke University, North Carolina USA. These Peace Scholarships are always very highly sought by students from around the world. In due course she will join an international network of people working to reduce the intensity of existing conflicts, to assist those caught up in conflicts and to contribute to the education of people to avoid causing conflict situations. Rotary Foundation Chair Marie-Louise then presented Level 11 certificates to three clubs for their support of The Rotary Foundation. Our club's donation was the equivalent of $250 per member.\n\nAcknowledgement of donation to the TRF of RI\n\nBill, Bryce & Peter chatting at the Conference\n\nFrom Club Secretary Sandie: the Conference was a well organised event of amazing diversity and awe-inspiring impressive speakers, whose presentations were interesting with sometimes confronting topics. The Conference dinner was a big Saturday fun night, which included a first class meal with drinks and many masked up Rotarians . Sandie said that the conference was a great opportunity to share our projects (Ring Pulls) and learn from other clubs. The speakers were excellent and included nine Rotarians who each had a five minute soap box regarding their particular project.\n\nPP Keith Millington was the first to tell us all about the success of the 2021 Airshow and then advised that 2023 Airshow will be April 16th.\n\nMany other presenters included Ian Henschke who addressed the rights of older Australians,\n\nPolice Commissioner Grant Stevens, COVID got a mention here.\n\nPolice Commissioner Grant Stevens\n\nPhilip Hoffmann Travel acknowledged the difficulties of the industry through COVID. He now employs 200 passionate South Australians across ten branches and an annual turnover at more than $155 million is testament to Phil's impeccable reputation, In recognition of his work and contribution to Rotary he was awarded a Paul Harris Fellow.\n\nConference MC Lynton Nicholas seeking a few answers from Phil Hoffmann.\n\nPeter Gorayski is a Radiation Oncologist at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI) on North terrace Adelaide. His work with Proton Therapy and Research has been beneficial in treating cancer. If you have never visited SAHMRI it is worth a visit. Regular tours are provided.\n\nAnother key note speaker was Rotarian Lisa Dallow. Lisa was on White Island NZ when the explosion occurred on December 9th 2019. Twenty two people lost their lives, To her it was an unspeakable tragedy. Her darling husband Gavin (well known to many of us) and her beautiful, bright daughter Zoe lost their lives in the eruption. Lisa asked everyone in the audience to take out their mobile phones and send a message to members of their families telling them how much they are loved. She continues with her recovery therapy and has returned to work as an engineer.\n\nOther speakers to name a few included, Elaine Bensted Chief Executive Zoos SA, Dr. Leanne Beagley CEO Mental Health Australia and Martin Hamilton-Smith. AllKids was the chosen project of our District Governor's wife Jenny Neale, so it was fitting that we heard from Paul Otto, AllKids Country Director. Paul's presentation covered his 10 years of education in rural Cambodia. At the beginning of Jeff and Jenny's year she asked clubs to support her AllKids project. Up to and including conference time she told the gathering that $33,000 had been donated from the D9510 clubs.\n\nThis Conference was yet another outstanding event enjoyed by more than 400 Rotarians and partners.\n\nIncoming DG Paul Thomas and wife Kathryn\n\nSo what about next year? Well, our incoming Governor is Paul Thomas from the Northern York Peninsula Club and he told us of his rather unique plan for Conference 2023. The International Convention 2023 is being held in Melbourne from May 27th to 31st, so rather than have a District Conference as well, Paul and his committee will be encouraging us all to represent D9510 by attending the International Conference. The plan begins by taking the Overland Train from Adelaide to Melbourne on or about May 25th 2023, accommodation to be included. PDG David Egan heads up the planning committee. We will hear plenty more in coming months as this arrangement begins to fall into place. All being well I hope to be on that train.\n\n...............................................................................................................\n\nMembers of the Barossa Valley Club cooked up about 300 lunches to feed Conference attendees before sending them on their way.\n\nSomeone has to do it.\n\n.................................................................................................................\n\nMaundy Thursday Breakfast 14th April\n\n22 members, partners and guests enjoyed a breakfast of egg & bacon on toast, followed by the usual delicious hot cross bun. Retired Lutheran Minister Brian Schwarz began with his thoughts from Philippians in presenting a short interesting Easter message. President Bill thanked Brian and presented him with a nice bottle of Red. Thank you Peter Sich and all helpers for yet another pleasant Rotary get together.\n\n................................................................................................................\n\nAttendance April 7th 2022\n\nMembers attending 19\n\nVisiting Rotarian 1 Guests attending 1\n\nTotal Attending 21\n\nMember Birthdays\n\nIan Mader April 5th\n\nSue Graetz \" 16th\n\nPeter Frazer \" 18th\n\nJohn Semmler \" 30th\n\nDate Joined Rotary\n\nIan Rice (now Honorary) 1/4/1978 44 yrs\n\nPatrick Ritchie-Haydn 1/4/1982 40 yrs\n\nDavid West. 10/4/2008 14yrs\n\nIan Mader 11/4/2019 3 yrs\n\nRoxane Canning 24/4/2014 8 yrs\n\nSue Graetz 24/4/2014 8 yrs\n\nMarie Rothe 24/4/2014 8 yrs\n\n................................................................................................................\n\nJUST A THOUGHT\n\nIn a time marked by crisis, despair and desperation Easter reminds us that in the face of darkness there is light.\n\nTo all readers..
