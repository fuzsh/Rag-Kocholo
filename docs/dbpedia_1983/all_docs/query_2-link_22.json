        "text": "SYDNEY, Australia — Two Australian journalists have rushed out of China after a five-day diplomatic standoff that began when Chinese state security officers paid them unannounced visits, prompting fears that they would be detained.\n\nThe journalists — Michael Smith, the China correspondent for The Australian Financial Review, and Bill Birtles, a correspondent with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation — arrived in Sydney on Tuesday morning after their organizations hastily arranged flights. They were the last two correspondents working in China for Australian news outlets.\n\nTheir exit, which occurred after negotiations between Australian and Chinese diplomats that led China to revoke a ban on their departure, added another conflict to the deteriorating relations between the two nations. It also highlighted Beijing’s increasingly heavy-handed tactics to limit independent journalism in the country.\n\n“Their rushed departure from China marks a new low in a relationship which had already seemed to have reached rock bottom,” said Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney think tank, and a former China correspondent.\n\n“Other countries grappling with China should take note,” he added. “If their bilateral relationship deteriorates, then their own nationals will be in the firing line, as well.”\n\nFor Mr. Smith and Mr. Birtles, the sense of vulnerability — and the departure process — accelerated with visits from Chinese state security last week. Seven officers called on each of them at the same time: after midnight on Thursday at the homes of Mr. Smith in Shanghai and Mr. Birtles in Beijing.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
