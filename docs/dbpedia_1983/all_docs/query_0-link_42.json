        "text": "Against:\n\nEven in the most balanced of them, the flavor. It’s a sweet red synergy between the ripe yet bright red fruit and the equally sweet tasting oak. It’s in the Shiraz, the grenache, and sometimes the cabernet. Bubblegum is too harsh a word but it gives a hint of that flavor.\n\nParker in cahoots with the Grateful Palate. Except for Grange Hermitage and the more elegant Hill of Grace, Americans on average were blissfully unaware of SAus reds until Dan Philips started importing Noon and Ringland-made and other wines through Oxnard and the then-very esteemed Parker suddenly threw scores at that portfolio that competed with the brand new Napa cult cabs like Bryant Harlan SE Colgin and the more elegant but vintage sensitive Araujo. The timing with the great SAus1998 vintage was perfect. But then after the linear 1999s and the subpar 2000s people bought 2001s with 98 Parker points and IMO they were part 2007 CNduPape and part Frankenstein powdered tannin and awkward oak… and America turned its back on SAus. Meanwhile RunRig and Three Rivers were outliers, great wines lost in the backlash.\n\nAnd Philips turned the Ringland name into an empty franchise.\n\nAnd that’s how it sat about 12 years ago. And still sets IMO. It’s over. Right?\n\nFor:\n\nIn the past year for me, the same experience repeated again and again: off the top of my head:\n\nYarra Yering Dry Red 1 and 2 1998.\n\nMaxwell Lime Cave cab 1998.\n\nJohn Riddoch 1994 cab.\n\nDutschke Oskar Semmler 1998.\n\nEvery Three Rivers I’ve had except 2003. In general my favorite wine tied with 2000 Margaux.\n\nTorbreck’s weird 2005 experiment cofermenting Shiraz with Roussanne and Marsanne instead of Viognier.\n\nEven Sparky and Sarah Marquis’s 1998 Fox Creek Reserve.\n\nEverything made in 1996? I hope so.\n\nThese wines are showing fresh and unoxidized. They are quieter and more elegant versions of their newly released selves, although the cabs are slowly aging like cabs. They are aging better than their Napa counterparts. They delight me.\n\nCaveat: I intentionally avoid the really high alcohol ones and the grenaches, a grape I love. The Torbrecks don’t seem built to last. I avoid 2001 and 2003.\n\nThe question is, can you handle that Aus flavor, even if it’s in an outstanding balanced complex wine that is aging beautifully? Or did you suffer too much PTSD (Parker Toxic Score Deception) from the worst offenders and those 98 points for undrinkable 2001’s?\n\nEither position is valid. But with the memory of very old Grange and most Three Rivers and Rockford SVS as my lodestones that there is true greatness in Oz, with Margaret River as an unexplored (except for Leeuwin red and white, those I know) world class lesson in QPR elegance, I have had some great not expensive wine experiences this year, with wines showing as their younger selves but quieter.\n\nTonight is the 1994 Riddoch cab. It’s young and Cabernet-ish more than it is Oz-ish. I have some 1998, and based on tonight I might hold those. I did not expect that.\n\nLast year I visited Sydney. I was poured a Beechworth $35 Castagna. Whoa. It would immediately change the mind of many Americans who went through PTSD trauma. The whole Victoria and Beechworth region is unto itself and I’ve known for 15 years about the perfect balance of Jasper Hill wines.\n\nBut I’m limiting this post to the Parker darlings of 1998. Except for JJHahn (odd because Rolf Binder’s Hanisch1998 is gentlemanly and lovely) they’re quite satisfying and pretty for me.\n\nNoon? No idea what they turn into. Maybe Turley zin. Ask me in 10 years.\n\nI think vintage and original material matters. Wines from 1990 that I bought here and there from Winebid had not aged well for me but that could be provenance. I think the size of 1998’s helps them age. I have a couple of high end 1996’s which was a quieter but very elegant year and I will be very curious to see whether the balance kept the quieter fruit fresh. I should open them soon. The cabernet I had last night from 1994 though, not a famous year, was aging really well and seemed to be changing the way a cabernet should. There is no Napa 1994 cabernet as good for my palate at the price I paid.\n\nThe higher alcohol ones IMO should suddenly get unpleasant when the huge fruit fades even a little, leaving the vodka unmasked. If it showed hot on release, I have no interest in seeing whether time has helped. However, a wine that showed way too oaky on release is unpredictable. It can have the oak integrate leaving a beautiful wine, or the oak could be hiding alcohol and cynical winemaking that emerge later, a fear I also have about several recent expensive Napa cabernets, Parker 98-100. In that case I look to the track record of the winemaker to guess what will happen.\n\nBut anyone who thinks Australian reds cannot age is objectively wrong and has never had a Grange. I had a 1991 a couple of years ago and to me it had the awkwardness of a four year old wine. Meanwhile an ullaged 1971 at age 30 was one of the best wines I’ve ever had and it showed like a great Bordeaux. I’ll drink my one bottle of 1998 Grange in 2028 for my 70th birthday, if I can.\n\nIn short, their ageability depends on what you started with, and that’s where Parker has been no help at all. Pedigree is your best guide. Your palate isnt much help because on release there’s all that oak and fruit synergy creating that distinctive Oz flavor of, I dont know, strawberry jam, plus powdered tannibs, making it hard to extrapolate… The Marquis wines are too risky for me because on release I can’t tell how much is winemaking and how much is good strong fruit underneath.\n\nThe big message that it took me a while to appreciate, is that there was much more to Australia than the local critics’ love of South Australia, and certain US writers’ love of the biggest wines from McLaren Vale and Barossa Valley. Not all age well, and many more might age without ever gaining much additional complexity. Some do though, but on the whole that doesn’t match with the bigger is better, biggest is best mentality which seemed the focus of US importing when Parker et al were driving the market.\n\nEven in Australia, despite a good few sarcastic jibes at the gloopy wines making it big in the USA, has to my mind often focused too much on South Australian Shiraz at the bigger end of the scale. Grange has been the leading wine in Australia for many decades, but I think it’s rather held back the industry, as too many people saw that as the style they must emulate. There is much more out there and some great older wines that don’t fit the big fruit / big oak model. There is also that wonderful attitude of the Aussies to try new stuff out. It’s wrong to pigeon-hole them.\n\nI do not drink many of the wines you have mentioned so it is difficult to comment on them. However, I do like the Yarra Yering. I had the 2008 vintage last week. Very young indeed but just beautifully composed. Elegant wine with lots of potential.\n\nRecently, I hosted a few tasting for my friends (who are just a bit in to wine but not with cellars etc ) to show case them how Australian wine ages. We had a 2000 Craiglee Shiraz. Its made in the outskirts off Melbourne. Its a very nice mid bodied earthy wine. Effortless drinking. Well priced too. Other older wines Australian wines in those tastings were: 1998 Lakes Folly Cab (NSW), 1998 Yeringberg Cab (Vic), 1994 Henschke Edelstone, 1995 Houghton show reserve shiraz (WA). And a pair of 1997 and 1997 Tyrrells Vat 1 semillons (NSW). All were unique in their own expression and great. And with loads of potential.\n\nOther memorable Australian wines I had in the past couple of years have been:\n\n1990, 1991 and 1996 Penfolds Bin 28,\n\n1996 Penfolds Bin 389,\n\n1996 Penfolds St Henri\n\n1996, 1999, 2001 Moss Wood Cab\n\n1998 Brokenwood ‘graveyard’ shiraz\n\n2002 Clonakilla Shiraz Viognier\n\nThere are lots of stylistically different wines out there."
