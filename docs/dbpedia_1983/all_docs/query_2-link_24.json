        "meta_description": "Australian Journalism Review publishes articles on a broad range of perspectives relating to journalism research, practice and education. Its emphasis is on original theoretical, empirical and applied research, but it also provides opportunities to canvass perspectives on current debates on research, practice and education through commentary pieces on specific topics.This double-blind peer-reviewed journal is published twice annually, with the second edition each year focused primarily on a theme and supplemented by a small selection of broader-ranging papers.Prospective guest editor submissions on themes for future editions are always welcome. While many of Australian Journalism Review&apos;s submitting authors are based within the Australia-Pacific region, the journal welcomes scholarship from around the world and extending into broader media and communication topics of relevance to journalism.The journal incorporates a regular section highlighting the work of early career researchers, particularly current or recent higher degree by research students, as well as book reviews focusing on recent additions to the journalism, media and communications publishing landscape.AJR is the journal of the Journalism Education and Research Association of Australia.",

        "text": "The process of digitization has proven to be a boon for researchers, and especially for historians, because producing a digitized record of a thing allows researchers anywhere in the world to have access to artefacts. Digitization is especially important for mass communication researchers studying issues surrounding news. Digitization of news publications enables researchers to conduct word, phrase or other thematic searches using appropriate software. But where content has not been digitized, researchers must undertake cumbersome searches by physically reading through the original documents or some analogue record, like microfiche, and then they are limited by the assiduity of themselves, their teams and by the degradation of the originals as they age. Researchers in Australia are considerably assisted by the existence of the Trove database, which has digitized the content of Australian newspapers up to the end of 1954. The National Library of Australia considers Australian copyright law, which says content must be at least 70 years old, limits what may be digitized. Researchers who want to look at more recent news content must do so via state libraries’ microfiche records, limiting access. To make access equitable and democratic, Trove should digitize newspaper content into the twenty-first century.\n\nThe crisis in the news industry is affecting journalism as a profession. There are concerns about the increasing precarity of the job, with fewer opportunities of full-time employment and a clear career path. Through an analysis of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Census 2021 data, this study examines the current state of journalists’ occupation. Since 2011, there was an overall decline (19 per cent) in the number of journalists in Australia. The largest reduction occurred in print media, where the number of journalists halved. In contrast, the number of ‘journalists not further defined’ increased by 39 per cent. This category reflects the increase in the number of journalists who would not typically be working in a traditional journalism role. Workers in these categories of ‘not further defined’ and ‘not elsewhere classified’ earn less, are younger and are less likely to be employed full-time. Overall, the data reveal that many journalists in 2021 are facing precarious work arrangements.\n\nIn the present study, we compare coverage in mainstream English and minority ethnic media in Australia of the Uluru Statement proposal for a Voice and later referendum announcements, over the period from 1 January 2018 to 31 March 2023, to compare any changes over time within and between these two sets of media. With the election of the Labor government in 2022 and subsequent referendum announcements in early 2023, we are provided an opportunity to study the influence of key actors, in this case an incoming government with a signature policy, on discourse in the multi-ethnic public sphere. Our overarching aim is to compare the extent to which an issue of national, political and civic importance is addressed across both the mainstream English and the minority ethnic public sphere in contemporary, multicultural Australia. The results of keyword searches show that, while there were significant increases in mainstream English media coverage of the Voice referendum proposal, corresponding to the election of the Labor government in 2022 and then subsequent announcements of an upcoming referendum in early 2023, there was inconsistent coverage across the minority ethnic media we studied: while significant increases in coverage in the Chinese media mirrored those in the mainstream English media, there was only a small increase in one of the Vietnamese media over the same period, and no increase in the other Vietnamese media. The findings presented here have implications for scholars and others interested in the development of a truly multicultural public sphere in Australia and elsewhere."
