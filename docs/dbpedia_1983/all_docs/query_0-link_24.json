Cahudhry Government MP JONE TAKUVULA called Speight as a 'two-bit wonder'. Youths carrying sticks, rocks, knives and guns left the Parliamentary compound to make the attack on the TV station. Fijilive.com reports that Fiji One had gone off air, as had Pay TV channels. Fiji One was available on one pay-TV channel only; four of five stations are shut.\n\n* RADIO FIJI studios in Suva were also reportedly hit in Sunday night's attack. Windows were smashed at the radio station building, as armed rioters damaged and torched remaining buildings in the Fiji Islands capital. Earlier, four shots were fired at the back entrance of the home of President, RATU SIR KAMISESE MARA. Suva's Central Police Station was plunged into darkness, with the electricity source sabotaged. The effect on The Fiji Times Monday edition was unknown, when Media Flash went to print.\n\n* JERRY HARMER, Associated Press cameraman, was shot on Saturday in crossfire between Fiji Army soldiers and rebel troops. He was airlifted to Sydney late yesterday. JOHN FERGUSON, of News Limited, reported that Harmer was shot through the right forearm. JAY TOWN, Melbourne-based Herald Sun photographer, narrowly missed being shot.\n\nAussie Radio Industry Revalues\n\n* PAUL THOMPSON of DMG Radio Group (through its 85 per cent owned GD Ventures subsidiary, with British GWR) re-valued the Australian redio industry on Wednesday with a $155 million bid for a Sydney FM radio station licence. BRUCE GORDON'S WIN TV Wollongong (through its Wollongong Radio Pty Ltd) paid $10 million for the new Campbelltown FM licence. ABA chairman PROFESSOR DAVID FLINT offered a warm welcome to auction participants: 2UE'S TONY MOLTZEN dropped out between $80-100 million, REG GRUNDY'S RG Capital at $100 million, US company Second Generation dropped at $140 million. JANE SCHULZE of Fairfax said BARRIE UNSWORTH'S 2KY (NSW Trades and Labor Council) went to $145 million. Flint said the ABA was 'pleasantly surprised'. It was the first new commercial licence release in Sydney in 20 years.\n\nThompson Sets Pace ... Again\n\n* PAUL THOMPSON also re-set radio values in Australia by bidding $80 million for 2DAY-FM in the 1980's. Austereo boss PETER HARVIE was quoted to say the English DMG group had used the weak Australian dollar to break into the market. RG'S TIM HUGHES was said to describe the price paid as 'extraoprdinary' and predicting the station was unlikely to be profitable.\n\n* SUSAN HILLIARD, partner at law firm Mallesons, was reported as the 'dummy' bidder for DMG ... and to whom the licence was 'knocked down'.\n\nRex Hunt's Radio Daze\n\n* REX HUNT'S arrangement with 3AW has reached $325,000 this year, according to papers filed in his Court dispute with former agent GREG NUMA. The radio package is said to be worth $325,000 in 2001, and $350,000 in 2002. KARL MALAKUNAS of the Herald Sun reported on Saturday that Hunt claims he has not been paid $720,000 of a $1.086 million deal with K-mart. Hunt claims he has not received $360,000 of an $850,000 deal with RAMS Home Loans. Other work has been with Shimano fishing gear, Dairy Farmers milk products, Pan MacMillan publishing house and Discovery Leisure Network media group. The papers say Hunt had a $60,000 promotion package with Crown Casino. Hunt's wife LYNNE is said to have been told by Pan MacMillan that her husband was paid $177,995.12 in royalties for his Rex Hunt's Fishing Adventures book.\n\nASNA Awards - All The Winners\n\nBY ASH LONG in Adelaide (Judge of Best Suburban Newspaper)\n\n* WAYNE BUTTNER, Editor-in-Chief of Melbourne's Leader Newspapers, was main recipient of awards at Saturday's Australian Suburban Newspapers' Association Southern Division gala night at the Playford Radisson Hotel, Adelaide. ASNA Chairman GENE SWINSTEAD noted the hotel was built on the site of RUPERT MURDOCH'S Adelaide News where Swinstead and Fairfax chief NEIL COLLYER had started their journalism careers. The hotel bar operates where Murdoch's office was situated, the ballroom occupies the area once the Editorial Department.\n\n* SEAN CALLANDER of The Werribee Banner (Vic.) accepted the award for Best Suburban Newspaper Under 40,000 Circulation. Second: Doncaster-Templestowe News. Third: Whittlesea Post. Commendation: Weekend Courier Community (WA). News Ltd consultant DON LUDBEY named Progress Press as Best Suburban Newspaper Over 40,000 Circulation, and described its gloss color U magazine as 'sensational'. Second: Community News - Moonee Valley Edition (Vic.) represented by MD GRAEME GOODSON and Editor JIM LAWRENCE. Third: The Journal (Dandenong, Vic.) represented by Editor-in-Chief TREVOR LEWIS.\n\nBest Editorial Award\n\n* RON COLEMAN, Editor of The Western Times (Vic.), accepted ASNA's Best Editorial award winner judged by KIM LEWIS of Lewis Communications. The Stirling Times Community (WA) and Eastern Courier Messenger (SA) were finalists.\n\n* CHARMAINE NEWTON'S '$4000 Scholarship For Secretary's Daughter' story in the Weekly Times Messenger (SA) won the Best News Story award judged by retired Messenger Newspaper Group staffer ALEC MATHIESON. (That company's GM, TOM MILOSEVIC, hosted the evening, chiefly organised by TRACY MOTTOLA, ASNA Secretariat, of Fairfax Community Newspapers). Place-getters were DANIEL MOLONEY of The Melbourne Times for a CityLink tunnel exposÃ©, and the Mornington Peninsula Leader's school inquiry campaign by ADAM COOPER and PETA TOMLINSON (now to work in Hong Kong). ANDREW FAULKNER won commendation for his Eastern Courier news coverage.\n\nTops For Community Service\n\n* LEANNE RUTHVEN, Editor of the Salvation Army's War Cry, named The Mail (Regional Editor: SUE SCOTT) as winner of the ASNA Community Service award. Second and Third were the Weekly Times Messenger (SA) and Diamond Valley News (Vic.) respectively.\n\n* RIC HILDEBRANDT, Group Real Estate Manager of Leader Newspapers, accepted the Best Newspaper Promotion award for a full-page eight-week series in U Mag, Whitehorse Gazette and Doncaster Templestowe News for TIM FLETCHER'S then-Fletcher & Parker real estate agency. Judge PAUL BURROWS of Brown Orr Fletcher Burrows named Community News as place-getter for its Dining Card and Footy Cash Jackpot promotions.\n\n* MAL CHANDLER, Manager of the Frankston Standard (Vic.), accepted the Best Sports Story award judged by BRUCE LONEY of Cumberland Newspapers (NSW). Reporter PAUL AMY had won the award for a story on a comeback coach, as well as a commendation for a Mordialloc Chelsea News story. Place-getters were STEVEN MILNE of The Advocate (Brimbank, Vic), MATT DEIGHTON of Adelaide's City Messenger, and MICHAEL PLACE of the Waverley Gazette.\n\nOther ASNA Awards\n\n* WENDY McCORMACK, former Cumberland Newspapers Editor-in-Chief, named STEPHEN MARMO'S Moreland Sentinel 'Safe House Support' story as 'Best Pictorial News Story', backed by RICHARD WALKER'S single picture. Placings were achieved by Yarra Ranges Journal, The Heidelberger and the Macedon Ranges Telegraph.\n\n* ANDREW WILSON of Wilson Everard named the Frankston Standard's 110th Anniversary edition as Best Advertising Feature, with Victoria's Community News and Free Press given placings. The Port Adelaide-based Portside Messenger's pub feature was commended.\n\n* Judge SUE MARSHALL gave honors for Best Feature Story to PETA TOMLINSON of the Frankston Standard, with MATT DEIGHTON'S City Messenger cricket tale achieving second place. Third was KAREN McCANN'S bushfire survivor story in the Geelong News placed third.\n\n* ANDREW BROWNBILL of the Doncaster-Templestowe News won first and second prizes in the Best Sports Picture Award judged by JOHN FRENCH and KEN IRWIN of The Age. DAVID SMITH'S Caulfield Glen Eira Leader pix won third. The same judges assessed IAN COOK'S Mornington Peninsula Leader photography as 'Best General Picture'. Second was ANDREW BROWNBILL of Doncaster Templestowe News; and third was IAN RODDIE of the Standard Messenger (SA).\n\n* KATHI DUNBAR of The Advocate took honors for the Most Enterprising Use of Color for the Victorian paper's 'End Of The Century' front-page. Judge JO GINICH of The Ballarat News named the South Australian Leader Messenger and Portside Messenger as place-getters.\n\n* SYLVIA BRADSHAW, Publisher/GM of Leader Newspapers, accepted the award for 'Best House Designed Client Advertisement', as judged by PRUE KIRKALDI of The Starship Enterprise Advertising Agency. Placings were gained by The Echo (MD COLIN DUCK) and The Hobson Bay Times (MD JULIE UPSON).\n\nOnline Auctions For Ad Space\n\n* JOHN McALPINE, Network 10 CEO, says online auctions between media buyers for advertising time and space, could be part of the market-place soon. ANDREW McKENZIE of The Australian noted McAlpine's speech to the International Advertisers' Association. McAlpine urged the Nine and Seven Networks to co-operate with an industry proprietary system, but flagged that Ten was prepared to go it alone through its Buyten.com.au website.\n\nMPG To Be 60 Pages\n\n* JOHN ALLAN, Associate Publisher of The Age, predicts that its Melbourne Property Guide gloss color weekly insert will hit 60 pages this year: \"The Age MPG has been enthusiastically welcomed by readers and advertiser. New real estate agents are joining The Age each week with product averaging 40-44 pages per week. The outlook is to grow the MPG to around 60 pages by the end of this year based on the response from vendors who wish to appear in the product.\" Media Flash wonders whether the 60-page product will be an amalgam of MPG and the 24-page Domain midweek section.\n\n* ANTHONY McDONALD, General Manager of The Melbourne Weekly, is more than holding the level of his publication, with this week's edition measuring 128 pages with 97 pages real estate. TMW has sold its 'Property Of The Week' tag to the RACV, which accompanied with a quarter-page to promoted its home loans funded and administered by the Bank of Western Australia.\n\nPINA Nius Online: 10 Bulletins A Day\n\n* NINA RATULELE, Editor of Pacific Islands News Association, advises that the PINA Nius Online was sending out up to 10 news bulletins a day throughout the Fiji crisis: \"PINA's members are the radio and TV stations, newspapers, magazines and national associations of journalists in the Pacific Islands. PINA runs a daily e-mail news service for its members in 21 Pacific Islands countries and territories and associate members such as Radio New Zealand International and Radio Australia.\"\n\n'A Silly Report', Says Press Council\n\n* PROFESSOR DENNIS PEARCE'S Australian Press Council says the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies has produced 'a very silly report. which proposes that public monies be spent on a problem that does not exist. The report - In The Public Interest: Monitoring Australia's Media - proposes a taxpayer-paid Media Complaints Commission. \"The report is heavy in its support for media control. This, of course, is attractive to many politicians as it enables avoidance of public attention relating to their affairs. However, the report pays scant attention to that most fundamental of principle: that a free society only exists where there is a free press.\"\n\nNine To Pre-Empt Seven News Push\n\n* JOHN SORELL, Nine News boss in Melbourne, confirmed with Sunday Age reporter WENDY TUOHY, that the station is examining a 5.30pm half-hour, possibly called Melbourne Extra, and fronted by former Seven newsreader JENNIFER KEYTE. Although this may hit the Channel 10 5pm newshour, it is also thought that the program could pre-empt DAVID ASPINALL'S push to restructure Seven News in Melbourne. Aspinall is believed to have considered poaching MAL WALDEN (Channel 10) and DENIS WALTER (WIN-TV regionals) to improve the ratings currently gained by DAVID JOHNSTON and ANNE FULWOOD. Sorell formerly ran a Melbourne Extra program fronted by JOHN JOST. Former Seven news chief NEIL MILLER is named in Tuohy's article as a strong tip to produce the program. A 5.30pm slot works well in Brisbane, and the same concept is also being considered for Sydney, especially with the Olympic Games in September.\n\nThey Said It ...\n\n* ERIC BEECHER goes down in history, telling Age media reporter MELISSA FYFE that everything was going 'gangbusters' at Text Media, just prior to closing The Eye magazine.\n\n* MICHAEL SCHILDBERGER has just dismissed the $30 million failed deal to absorb MICHAEL WILKINSON'S company into his Infosentials group: \"We didn't really need Information Australia,' he told Fairfax reporter OLIVIA HILL-DOUGLAS. \"We're comfortable where we're going now.\"\n\nAsia-Pacific Report\n\n* ALASTAIR THOMPSON'S Scoop site (New Zealand) carried a large number of items on the Fiji coup, included an authorised lift of last week's Media Flash coverage.\n\nThis Week In Byron Bay\n\nAPN's Northern Star boycotted by local schools for prejudicial reporting of teachers' strike; local politicians to join Mullumbimby High School's Walk for Reconciliation; NorthPower's controversial cable much noisier than calculated; Fast Buck$'s open letter to John Mant; Pyramid selling and casino economics: globalisation explained - all in this week's ECHO, Byron Shire's independent locally-owned weekly with attitude.

The Hospital said it had a loss of donor support and criticism from staff, patients and visitors. The Press Council said the paper overlooked its responsibility to achieve a balance.\n\n* MICHAEL WALSH, Executive Director of Givewell, a firm involved in charitable donations, complained to the Press Council over Sun Herald (Sydney) articles about the charitable giving habits of the rich. Mr Walsh raised concerns on January 31, and it was March 26 before a letter was published. \"Had the newspaper not been so dilatory in publishing a reasonably held view contrary to the trhrust of the original articles ... the Press Council would have dismissed the complaint.\" The complaint was partly upheld.\n\n* PROFESSOR W.H. McCARTHY, a Sydney University cancer expert, challenged Daily Telegraph (Sydney) accuracy over a report on a new vaccine against melanoma. He said the report was misleading, inaccurate and based on inadequate data. The Press Council upheld the complaint, and warned on the need for care in producing reports on medical treatments.\n\nYour ABC\n\n* SUE HOWARD, one-time 3LO breakfast shift presenter, is widely tipped to takeover as ABC radio chief.\n\n* IAN HENSCHKE, South Australian based Landline reporter has been elected by national ABC workers to represent staff on the Corporation's Board.\n\n* TERRY LAIDLER, 3LO drive host, is quitting on June 16 to become Director of the Centre for International Research on Communication and Information Technologies at RMIT University.

Australian Provincial Newspapers, which is half owned by an overseas media conglomerate, is part of the community only through the jobs it provides at the Northern Star and the Byron News. This is not an inconsiderable benefit, but it is debatable whether it makes it part of the community. After all, economic rationalism rules at APN as at any other corporation, and if it suits the bean-counters, jobs are shed, down-graded or moved to Queensland. And, unlike genuinely local businesses, APN's profits do not stay in the community.'\n\nPersonal Bests\n\n* CAROLYN BATT, Age journalist, has won the COLUMB BRENNAN Award for excellence in court reporting, as part of the Victoria Law Foundation legal reporting awards.

Friday's service saw former News Limited chairman KEN COWLEY say: \"Ken's wisdom, judgement and experience rubbed off on a generation of senior executives and editors.\" FRANK SHAW, former Adelaide News colleague: \"You wouldn't find a better bloke than Ken if you hunted the world.\" Former News chief-of-staff from the 1950's, MURRAY JAMES, said: \"Ken May was a great bloke. I had a tremendous regard for and unlimited appreciation of his skills and friendship.\" RAE ATKEY'S Sunday Mail article was headed 'Journalism Mourns Leader Of Courage', with the st\n\nGlass House Dept.\n\n* JAMES TSAVIOS, 3AK producer, was asked by afternoon announcer BRUCE MANSFIELD: \"What did you do last night?\" Tsavios, not the quickest at repartee, shared with listeners that he went to bed at 8.30pm, before rising at 6am. Oops! Tsavios forgot about the 1am-5.30am Overnight shift that he pre-records on the 'Wizard'. Worst still, no-one corrected him, no-one heard.\n\nIt's A Date\n\n* JULY 17-20.

It is sponsored by trans-Tasman newsprint manufacturer Fletcher Challenge Paper. The sections have been designed to allow all newspapers to compete on reasonably even terms and are being judged by six eminent former newspaper editors.
