        "text": "MAGAZINES THE NEXT VINYL? I often get asked how and why at Adventure Entertainment we continue to invest in magazines, in what some consider a \"dying industry\". Today I read this article from Brian Morrissey, Founder of the Rebooting, that succinctly captured some of the key points: https://lnkd.in/gXxnFzZU These two bits in particular really stood out: 1) \"The heightened awareness of the downsides of algorithmic recommendation media is renewing interest in hand-crafted media creation and discovery. This counter approach will be rooted more in human curation and focused on communities and niches.\" and 2) \"It’s worth remembering that for all the talk of death, most media forms stick around. Streaming music hasn’t eliminated vinyl. Paper books are still more popular than e-books. It wouldn’t be surprising for physical media to become a mental health habit as a way to cut down on screen time.\" At Adventure Entertainment our core focus is on building communities and sharing quality and diverse content from and amongst those communities. Our experience is that there is a high demand for this from community members as well as from advertisers seeking to connect with that community. Print magazines offer a way of engaging with the community that is not transient or fleeting, but authentic, real and lasting - something people are craving in the post-COVID world. The other trend we are seeing is an increasing blurring between print and digital such that the \"medium\" of delivering content is less and less relevant. For example, we are integrating QR codes into our magazines (as are our advertisers) allowing jumping off points to our digital streaming service and websites, as well as to directly purchase an advertiser's products. We are delivering products and brochures with subscription copies to help our partners get their message directly into the hands of core consumer groups in ways that is simply not possible with digital alone. And we are investing in new digital tools to take our content off the page and into the digital world as well. In this way the brands of our magazines are becoming mastheads for communities, not just traditional \"print mastheads\". At Adventure Entertainment we are proud to be growing across all key metrics in our \"magazine\" business including readership, subscriber numbers, digital penetration and advertising, as well as investing in the acquisition of new titles, improvement in print quality, and expansion to new geographies. Thank you to all the community members, contributors and business partners out there who are supporting us.
