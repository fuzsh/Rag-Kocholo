        "text": "The two played mother and daughter on the hit sitcom \"Modern Family.\"\n\nModern Family alum Julie Bowen still feels very maternal toward her TV children.\n\nThe actress, 54, responded to headlines about supporting former costar Sarah Hyland during a past abusive relationship. Bowen played Hyland's mother on the Emmy-winning sitcom and said on the Skinny Confidential Him & Her Podcast any responsible adult would have done the same.\n\n\"Sarah Hyland gives you credit for saving her life after a violent relationship,\" co-host Lauryn Bosstick said.\n\n\"That's very sweet of her,\" Bowen responded.\n\nBosstick said, \"You were, it sounds like, a mother to her.\"\n\n“I was a responsible adult that happened to be around at the right time,\" Bowen said. \"But I mean, I'm sure another responsible adult would have done the exact same thing. I just love her.”\n\nRelated: Modern Family alum Aubrey Anderson-Emmons is all grown up, shares prom photos\n\nWhen asked if she looked at Hyland maternally, Bowen said \"absolutely,\" adding that she looked at all of the child actors — Nolan Gould (who played her onscreen son Luke), Ariel Winter (Alex, her youngest onscreen daughter), and Rico Rodriguez (Manny, son of Bowen's onscreen stepmother played by Sofia Vergara) — as if they were her kids.\n\n\"Well, Rico was always like an adult — a tiny adult,\" Bowen said. “But yeah, I look at them all like my kids. I love them.”\n\n\"So you can just text them or call them anytime?\" Bosstick asked.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nBowen replied, \"Absolutely.\"\n\nHyland made headlines back in 2014 when she filed a temporary restraining order against former partner Matthew Prokop, an actor who also made an appearance on one episode of Modern Family. Hyland accused Prokop of abuse, alleging he choked her and became hostile after she broke off the relationship, including making threats to burn down her house.\n\nBowen was reportedly mentioned in the docs, with various outlets reporting that Hyland detailed seeking help from her onscreen mother by asking her to come over to her home to help \"peacefully end the relationship.\"\n\nBowen and Hyland played a mother and daughter within the expansive Pritchett clan in the ABC sitcom, which followed the everyday lives of the blended family led by patriarch Jay (Ed O'Neill) and his much younger second wife Gloria (Vergara). It ran for 11 seasons between 2009 and 2020, with much of the cast staging a reunion at this year's SAG Awards. \"Is it too early to talk about a reboot? They made me park a mile away from here,\" star Jesse Tyler Ferguson quipped from stage.\n\nRelated: It's a Dunphy reunion! Modern Family stars Sofia Vergara, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, and Julie Bowen reunite\n\nThe cast has remained close since the show wrapped. Hyland wed Bachelor Nation's Wells Adams in 2022, and her TV family, including Bowen, attended the wedding. Ferguson, who played her onscreen uncle, officiated the ceremony.\n\nListen to Bowen's podcast interview in full above."
