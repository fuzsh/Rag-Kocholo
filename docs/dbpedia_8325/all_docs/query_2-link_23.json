        "text": "A hot new host has entered the villa.\n\nAriana Madix, 38, confirmed she is taking over Sarah Hyland’s “Love Island USA” hosting gig for Season 6.\n\n“This summer I am trading rhinestone buckles for bikinis,” she began in a video she shared on Instagram Friday. “I can’t wait to stir up trouble in paradise.”\n\nThe “Vanderpump Rules” star’s announcement came after TMZ reported the news Wednesday.\n\nHyland, 33, took to Instagram Wednesday to confirm her exit from the show after TMZ broke the news.\n\n“I have committed to an exciting project, that will be announced soon, that conflicts directly with the shooting dates for LOVE ISLAND USA,” she penned.\n\n“While I’m sad I can’t return, I hope to see lots of love this summer on Peacock this upcoming season!”\n\nRepresentatives for Madix did not reply to Page Six’s request for comment.\n\nMadix previously made a cameo during Season 5 of “Love Island,” appearing at the picturesque waterfront villa to host an intense round of her “favorite” game, “Mr. and Mrs.”\n\nShe revealed she was a fan of “Love Island” during “Vanderpump Rules” Season 10 while she was arguing with her now-ex, Tom Sandoval, about how to strengthen their relationship.\n\n“You don’t sit there and watch episodes of ‘Love Island’ with me,” she complained.\n\nMadix told Rolling Stone she was “over the moon” when she was tapped to surprise contestants on the Peacock show.\n\n“I have seen every episode of every iteration of ‘Love Island’ and it is my favorite show,” she gushed during the July 2023 interview. “Most of my friends are well aware of my obsession and were just as excited as I am for me to be able to live my dream.”\n\nHer guest spot came months after Sandoval, 40, was caught cheating on her with their former co-star Raquel Leviss, who now prefers being called Rachel. Madix also went on to compete in Season 32 of “Dancing with the Stars” and is currently starring in “Chicago” on Broadway.\n\nFor more Page Six reality TV updates …\n\nListen to our “Virtual Reali-Tea” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nHyland has hosted the show for its past two seasons.\n\nBefore her, Arielle Vandenberg led the series for its first three seasons.\n\n“Love Island USA” is a spinoff of the popular British series of the same name."
