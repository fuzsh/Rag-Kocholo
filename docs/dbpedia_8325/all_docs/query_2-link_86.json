The stunning woman from Columbia was bartending in a bikini at the pool party that Jay threw for himself on the day that his wife left him. Now that Jay and Gloria are married and he has to work hard to keep up with his much younger, hotter wife and her passionate teenage son, Manny Delgado (Rico Rodriguez).\n\nJay’s adult daughter, Claire (Julie Bowen), is having a hard time raising her own family. Her husband, Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell), is a great guy, except for the fact that he thinks he’s “down” with their teenage kids, much to their constant embarrassment. Their three kids are Haley (Sarah Hyland), Alex (Ariel Winter), and Luke (Nolan Gould). Haley is a typical teen, isn’t always the brightest, and dates slacker Dylan (Reid Ewing). Alex is a brainy overachiever who enjoys messing with her siblings. Luke is a rambunctious boy who often gets into trouble when his parents aren’t paying attention.\n\nJay’s gay son, Mitchell Pritchett (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and his enthusiastic and emotional partner, Cameron (Eric Stonestreet), have just adopted Lily, a precious little baby girl from Vietnam. While Mitchell is comfortable with his sexuality, his Dad still has a hard time accepting it.\n\nThis single-camera comedy offers a ‘mockumentary’ view into the complicated, messy, loving life of three unique and connected families.\n\nSeries Finale:\n\nEpisode #250 — Finale, Part 2\n\nThe entire family discovers saying goodbye is much harder than it seems.\n\nFirst aired: April 8, 2020.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you like the Modern Family TV show? Do you think it should have ended or been renewed for a 12th season?"
