        "text": "ACTRESS Sarah Hyland is known for playing Haley Dunphy in the ABC sitcom Modern Family.\n\nHyland received critical acclaim and numerous accolades for her role in Modern Family, including four Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series.\n\nWho is Love Island host Sarah Hyland?\n\nHyland is 31 years old and was born in New York City.\n\nShe is best known for portraying the role of Haley Dunphy in the ABC sitcom Modern Family from 2009 to 2020.\n\nThe star began dating Wells Adams in 2017, and the couple eventually got engaged in July 2019.\n\nThe 38-year-old was actually a contestant on season 12 of The Bachelorette.\n\nThe two first met on social media when Adams first messaged Hyland on Instagram, according to Us Weekly.\n\n\"Have you seen those memes of ‘Slide Into the DMs’? That. He slid into my DMs,\" shared Hyland on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in January 2018.\n\n\"I thought he was funny, and he was a fan of [my] show. I saw him as the bartender and I was like, 'That’s really cute!'\"\n\nWhat is Hyland's net worth?\n\nHyland has amassed a $14million net worth, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nWhen Modern Family first debuted, Hyland was earning a salary of about $70,000 per episode.\n\nThis remained the norm from 2013 to 2018, and from that point on, Hyland earned a sum of $130,000 per episode until the series ended in 2020.\n\nWhen did Sarah Hyland marry Wells Adams?\n\nThree years after getting engaged, Wells and Sarah tied the knot on August 20, 2022.\n\nTheir wedding was at Sunstone Winery near Santa Barbara, California, in an outdoor ceremony.\n\nPreviously, there were speculations about when they were set to marry.\n\nFor example, Hyland and Adams halted their wedding plans due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt a point, it was unclear exactly when the celebrity couple would tie the knot.\n\nHyland previously told PEOPLE that she and Adams \"definitely want to get married one day and have the wedding of our dreams and have everybody that we love there.\"\n\nShe continued: \"But we postponed wedding planning because we want to be able to focus on what's important right now.\n\n\"There is a lot going on in the world right now and that's what we should be focused on.\"\n\nThey were supposed to tie the knot during the summer of 2020, but the Covid-19 pandemic forced them to postpone the big day indefinitely.\n\nThe Modern Family star did have her bridal shower in June 2022, according to E! News.\n\n\"Soooooo I finally had my bridal shower yesterday,\" shared Hyland on her Instagram Story on June 5.\n\nThe photo showed a custom enamel box clutch with the words 'Mrs. Adams' in gold lettering.\n\nThe bridal shower featured Hyland's close friends, including Vanessa Hudgens, GG Magree, Kimberly Daugherty, Natalie Joy, Ashley Newbrough, Jesse Tyler Ferguson's husband Justin Mikita, and Hyland's maid of honor, Ciara Robinson.\n\n\"Hosted by the most amazing maid of honor.\""
