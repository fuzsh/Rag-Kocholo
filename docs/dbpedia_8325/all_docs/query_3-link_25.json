        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nShe may play the slightly dim-witted, misunderstood and sometimes scantily clad Haley Dunphy on ABC's Modern Family, but actress Sarah Hyland is no dummy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHyland's been on the stage since age five, starring in Disney films and TV shows before landing on the network sitcom. If she looks familiar, it's probably because you may have mistaken her for Mila Kunis (Someone needs to sign them up to play sisters!). Even tabloid magazine editors can't tell the two apart.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou've seen her parents on TV and in movies.\n\nHyland is the daughter of actors Melissa Canaday and Edward James Hyland. Canady was featured in last year's \"Green Apples & Wannabes\" with Edward. Hyland's father is known for \"The Happening\" (2008), \"The Switch\" (2010) and small cameos on Boardwalk Empire, Gossip Girl and Law & Order.\n\nShe also has a brother, Ian, who has acted in \"Spanglish,\" and cameoed in episodes of 30 Rock and Weeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe's actually 21.\n\nThe young-looking actress may play a 16-year-old high schooler on \"Modern Family,\" but in real life she's nearly the age of a college graduate.\n\nHyland told Ellen in her first talk show interview appearance she has no problem with looking young. \"I look like I'm 12 and that's okay,\" Hyland said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSorry fellas, she's taken.\n\nHyland has been dating Disney co-star Matt Prokop for five years.\n\nThe couple met while trying out for \"High School Musical 3\" and began dating shortly afterward. The duo starred on screen as couples in Disney's television film \"Geek Charming\" and USA's TV film \"Conception\" which also starred Modern Family co-star, Julie Bowen.\n\nIn the past, Hyland suggested she would pefer Prokop as a love interest on her ABC hit. \"I rather my boyfriend on Modern Family be him, so I don't have to make out with some random dude,\" Hyland told the ladies of The View.\n\nShe got her wish. Zap2It revealed late last month Prokop will indeed star as her next flame. We hope he can top old flame Dylan's \"In the Moonlight\" serenade to Hyland's character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe can sing.\n\nFrom 2001 through 2008, Hyland has appeared in six musicals, including workshop productions of \"The Prince and the Pauper\" and \"A Little Princess.\"\n\nIn 2002, Hyland starred as the titular character in the Paper Mill Playhouse adaptation of \"Annie.\" However, it wasn't until 2006 that she made her Broadway debut in \"Grey Gardens.\"\n\nHere she is singing \"Freedom\" from \"The Unauthorized Autobiography of Samantha Brown\" at a 2008 senior showcase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat wasn't her first time in \"Annie.\" Hyland played Molly in Disney's 1999 television film version.\n\nHere she is in a scene singing \"You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe's played Howard Stern's daughter in the past and a young Audrey Hepburn.\n\nHyland's first acting gig was in \"Private Parts\" where she played one of Howard Stern's daughters at the age of five.\n\nShe then played an eight-year-old version of Audrey Hepburn in the self-titled, made-for-TV film, \"The Audrey Hepburn Story,\" featuring Jennifer Love Hewitt as the lead. You can catch a glimpse of her here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was on ABC before Modern Family.\n\nIf you think Hyland looks familiar, it's probably because you've seen her previously on the network that helped her rise to stardom.\n\nHyland brushed elbows with soap queen Susan Lucci playing a brief—two episodes—role in 2000, on the now-canceled All My Children. Seven years later, she landed another small role on One Life to Live.\n\nThese weren't the only soaps on which Hyland appeared. For a year in 2001, she starred in Another World as a child found in a park.\n\nFrom daytime, Hyland headed to primetime playing the daughter of a musician and a producer on NBC's Lipstick Jungle for a year until landing her role on Modern Family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe guest-starred on '90s sitcoms \"Touched By an Angel\" in 1994 and \"Law & Order: Special Victim's Unit\" five years later in 1999.\n\nShe had a mini-breakthrough role her second time on \"Law & Order\" when she portrayed a psychotic student who killed her roommate in order to become the smartest girl at her school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe's rubbed elbows with Hollywood A-listers.\n\nHyland had minor roles in a few big films. In 1998, she starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Paul Rudd and Hayden Panettiere in \"The Object of My Affection.\"\n\nIn 2004's \"Spanglish,\" starring Adam Sandler, if you look really closely, you'll notice Hyland as one of the girls at a sleepover.\n\nThree years later, she voiced a child in \"Blind Date\" featuring Oscar-nominated Stanley Tucci.\n\nEverybody confuses her with actress Mila Kunis …\n\nShe and Kunis are aware of their doppelganger status. Both have been mistakenly for the other in public … and in magazines including this Teen Vogue post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n... So she and Kunis pretend to be each other.\n\nAfter meeting each other in December 2010, Kunis told Hyland that she gets confused with the \"Modern Family\" star all the time. Naturally, Kunis figured the best thing to do was play along.\n\nHyland liked the idea so much she asked Kunis if she could pretend to be her in public as well. She said yes.\n\nShe starred in an Olive Garden commercial featuring one of the fakest laughs you'll ever hear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe hurt Lea Michele's feelings.\n\nDuring an episode of E!'s \"Fashion Police,\" Hyland mocked the Glee star posing on the red carpet, pouting her lips and sticking out her collar bones.\n\n“It’s like a slow-motion picture kind of thing. It’s just like, she puts her hands on her hips like this and like sticks out her collarbones — I don’t know if you can see — she sticks out her collarbones to make her look skinnier and she sticks out her lips.”\n\nHyland didn't apologize to Michele.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n… and blasted Charlie Sheen.\n\nAfter Charlie Sheen joined Twitter, Hyland was among the 26 lucky people he decided to follow. Unfortunately, she didn't view it this way, tweeting the following:\n\n\"FYI, I've never met @charliesheen in my LIFE, and he's following me now? Really creeped out. Ew. #notwinning.\"\n\nHyland removed the tweet soon afterward.\n\nHey, it could have been worse. At least he didn't profess his love for you …\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe credits Adele with—indirectly—saving her life.\n\nWhile traveling to an audition for her boyfriend Prokop, the couple's vehicle spun out of control on a Los Angeles highway during a rainstorm. Hyland credited an Adele song for keeping Prokop's eyes on the road.\n\n\"He would have been focusing on remembering his lines [but] 'Someone Like You' came on the radio, so we blasted it to sing along to it,\" the actress told E! \"And then we hit a water pocket ... The wheels turned to the right and locked and then it spun.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo word on wedding bells for Sarah Hyland and long-term boyfriend at the moment; however, these 15 celebrities decided to elope.\n\nCheck out which stars eloped and who made it work>\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
