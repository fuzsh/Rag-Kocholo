The show, created by Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan, focuses on the daily lives of three unique family units in suburban Los Angeles. All of these families are connected through their patriarch, Jay Pritchett. \"Modern Family\" was created based on Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan's discussions about their modern-day families. The show boasts an ensemble cast and utilizes a mockumentary style, where the characters frequently engage with the audience by speaking directly to the camera during confessional interview scenes. The show's final season premiered on September 25, 2019, after being renewed on February 5, 2019. The series finale was broadcasted on April 8, 2020. During its initial seasons, \"Modern Family\" was widely praised by critics. Although critical reception became more varied as the show progressed, it maintained a dedicated fan base throughout its 11-season run and remained popular. The last season garnered positive reviews, and the series finale attracted 7.37 million viewers during its first airing. Additionally, the documentary aired before the finale had 6.72 million viewers during its initial airing. Throughout its run, \"Modern Family\" received a plethora of awards. It won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in each of its first five seasons and amassed a total of 22 Emmy Awards from 75 nominations. Julie Bowen won two awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, while Eric Stonestreet and Ty Burrell each won two awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. The show won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series - Musical or Comedy 2011.

The show's popularity resulted in it being the 10th highest revenue-generating program of 2012, with each episode earning $2.13 million.\n\nModern Family Locations\n\nModern Family is one of the most beloved television series in recent years, and it has a lot of production value from its filming locations.
