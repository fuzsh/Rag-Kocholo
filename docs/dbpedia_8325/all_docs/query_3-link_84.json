He goes, ‘This is going to be very sexual for me.'\n\n\"He was like, ‘It’s like my wife is doing Marisa Tomei in 'My Cousin Vinny' and it’s very hot'.\"\n\nThe loved-up duo tied the knot in 2022, and Sarah previously joked that she's become a \"golf wife\".\n\nThe actress - who is best known for playing Haley Dunphy in the sitcom 'Modern Family' - told E! News: \"I've become a golf wife.\n\n\"I actually know who the golfers are now. I know the terminology now. We went to the Masters - that was his Christmas present, it wasn't a compromise. I had so much fun.\"\n\nSarah is loving married life and she is full of praise for her husband, too.\n\nShe shared: \"He's a wonderful, wonderful husband.\n\n\"I think he has to compromise - and it has been our entire relationship - of my multiple alarms in the morning.\"\n\nWhat's more, Sarah believes their relationship hasn't actually changed since they tied the knot.\n\nShe said: \"We were together for so long and went through a pandemic.\n\n\"We were engaged for a really long time before we were able to get married, so I think the greatest thing about our marriage is that nothing has changed - other than a woman at a bar seeing his ring.\""
