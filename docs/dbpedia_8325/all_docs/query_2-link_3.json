        "text": "01 of 11\n\nTy Burrell as Phil Dunphy\n\nTy Burrell's \"cool dad\" character Phil cracked us up for a decade with his dad jokes, pipe dreams and \"Phil's-osophies,\" earning the actor two Emmys in the process.\n\nWhile the family man tried (and often hilariously failed) to connect with his extended clan on the show, the actor and his castmates share a tight-knit bond off-screen.\n\nIn 2017, Burrell told Haute Living Los Angeles that post-Modern Family, he was looking forward to potentially taking a step back from the spotlight to spend more time with his wife, Holly, and their two daughters, Frances and Greta.\n\nHe added that he would still be open to future projects — they would just need to be \"something like another television show, where it was close to home and I knew the hours were going to allow me to be around the way that [Modern Family] has.\"\n\nIn addition to film credits (including 2014's Muppets Most Wanted and 2017's Rough Night) and a variety of voice work (he voiced himself on Family Guy), along with a series of guest appearances on other TV shows amid Modern Family's run, Burrell lent his voice to the animated sitcom Duncanville, which aired from 2020 to 2022.\n\n02 of 11\n\nJulie Bowen as Claire Dunphy\n\nJulie Bowen earned two Emmys for her role as micro-managing mom Claire, who was as competitive as she was compassionate when it came to her loved ones. While her on-screen family was \"fake,\" their bonds are very real.\n\nThe real-life mom of three, who divorced her husband in 2018, tried her hand at directing an episode of the hit ABC series, as well as a video for the Power On Film Series on YouTube.\n\nBowen has also appeared in movies such as Horrible Bosses (2011), Hubie Halloween (2020) and The Fallout (2021).\n\nShe's an active board member of Baby2Baby, a charity that supports children in need.\n\n03 of 11\n\nSarah Hyland as Haley Dunphy\n\nSarah Hyland had a handful of TV roles and small film appearances before finding her home on Modern Family at age 18, but the actress is now best known for her portrayal of the oldest Dunphy child, Haley, a rebellious social butterfly who preferred boys to books and had a penchant for screwing up.\n\nDuring the show's run, the actress revealed she underwent a kidney transplant in 2012 and another in 2017, after the first went into failure. She's since been candid about her difficult and emotional recovery process, but in 2018, she said, \"I'm stable,\" in an interview with SELF. \"I'm thriving. I'm super happy with life.\"\n\nAmid her run on Modern Family, Hyland also appeared in films such as Geek Charming (2011), Scary Movie 5 (2013), Vampire Academy (2014) and The Wedding Year (2019). She joined the Pitch Perfect Peacock spin-off series, Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin, in 2022.\n\nIn August 2022, after postponing their wedding multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Hyland and The Bachelorette alum Wells Adams finally married. Her Modern Family costars were there to celebrate the big day in Santa Barbara, Calif.\n\nHyland and Adams first met via social media in 2017 and got engaged in 2019.\n\n04 of 11\n\nAriel Winter as Alex Dunphy\n\nAriel Winter took on the role of know-it-all middle child Alex at age 11, but she'd been in the industry since her mom signed her up for commercials at age 4. \"I love what I do, but I don't know if it's a choice I would have made on my own,\" she told PEOPLE in 2016.\n\nWhile Claire's Type A mini-me daughter was growing up, Winter was also voicing characters on TV series including Phineas and Ferb and Sophia the First. She became an emancipated minor in May 2015 and later moved in with then-boyfriend Levi Meaden. The pair split in 2019, and Winter is now dating Dumplin' actor Luke Benward.\n\nThe actress enrolled at UCLA in 2017 before taking a break from her studies six months later so could \"continue to pursue my career and also try to have a little bit more of a life because I've been so busy,\" she told Entertainment Tonight. \"But I think education's really important. I love being there. I love learning. I will continue to keep learning.\"\n\nIn 2022, Winter said she decided to move away from Los Angeles to pursue a quieter life away from paparazzi.\n\n05 of 11\n\nNolan Gould as Luke Dunphy\n\nModern Family's first season premiered in 2009, when Nolan Gould was 10 years old. While his character Luke was defined by his high energy level, non-existent filter and low IQ, Gould is actually a member of high IQ society Mensa International and graduated high school with a GED at age 13.\n\nFollowing Modern Family's run, Gould appeared on The Celebrity Dating Game in 2021 and an episode of Grey's Anatomy in 2022.\n\n06 of 11\n\nEd O'Neill as Jay Pritchett\n\nEd O'Neill was already well-known on the small screen for portraying Al Bundy on Married... with Children before he took up the role of Jay.\n\nAs the often ignorant but well-meaning patriarch of the Pritchett-Dunphys, O'Neill's character was an old-fashioned man's-man who struggled to accept his son Mitchell being gay and his son-in-law Phil being, well, Phil.\n\nThe ABC sitcom's many seasons were benchmarked by Jay's increasing tolerance and understanding toward his family, who all strived to impress him (except his second wife, Gloria — she set him straight every time).\n\nIn addition to his TV roles, O'Neill has also voiced a number of characters in films such as Wreck-It Ralph (2012), Finding Dory (2016) and Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018).\n\n07 of 11\n\nSofía Vergara as Gloria Delgado\n\nSofía Vergara had a handful of TV roles before taking the small screen by storm as the feisty Gloria. Her role as the fiercely family-oriented, outspoken and sexy second wife of Jay (and mother of Manny) provided many of the show's most hilarious moments and earned the Colombian American actress the title of the highest-paid TV actress in 2017. She also received four Golden Globe nominations and four Emmy nominations for her portrayal of Gloria.\n\nVergara — who married fellow actor Joe Manganiello in 2015 and has a son, Manolo, with ex-husband Joe Gonzalez — has also starred in 2019's Bottom of the 9th alongside her husband and has been a judge on America's Got Talent since 2020.\n\nShe also has a denim line for Walmart and endorsement deals with several lifestyle brands.\n\n08 of 11\n\nRico Rodriguez as Manny Delgado\n\nRico Rodriguez has grown up quite a bit since taking on the role of the precocious Manny, whose intelligence and sophisticated adult sensibilities were constantly tested by his nephew and unintentional partner-in-crime, Luke (who could forget the tequila worm episode?).\n\nRodriguez also starred in the 2015 chess film Endgame and has appeared as himself on TV shows including Nickelodeon's The Substitute and Unfiltered.\n\n09 of 11\n\nEric Stonestreet as Cameron Tucker\n\nEric Stonestreet was best known as Ronnie Litre on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation before warming our hearts as flamboyant farm boy Cam, whose enthusiasm and musical passion knew no bounds. Stonestreet's performance earned him two Emmys for best supporting actor, which would make Cam proud.\n\nThe actor took up a handful of other roles throughout the seasons, appearing in Bad Teacher (2011) and Identity Thief (2013). He also joined costar Winter in doing voice work for the TV series Sophia the First and voices the character Duke in the Secret Life of Pets franchise.\n\nIn 2021, Stonestreet got engaged to pediatric nurse Lindsay Schweitzer, whom he began dating in August 2017.\n\n10 of 11\n\nJesse Tyler Ferguson as Mitchell Pritchett\n\nJesse Tyler Ferguson had a successful theater career and a handful of TV appearances under his belt before taking on the role of the fittingly theater-obsessed lawyer Mitchell, whose constant bickering with his sister Claire and longtime partner Cam (whom he eventually married) set the stage for some of the series' sweetest reconciliations.\n\nIn addition to Modern Family, Ferguson served as a guest judge on So You Think You Can Dance from 2011 to 2013 and hosted Extreme Makeover: Home Edition in 2020. In 2022, he won a Tony for his performance in the Broadway revival of Take Me Out.\n\nFerguson married husband Justin Mikita in July 2013, and the couple welcomed their first child, Beckett Mercer, in 2020 and second son, Sullivan Louis, in 2022."
