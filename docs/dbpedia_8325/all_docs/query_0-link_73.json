The beloved ABC sitcom ended its 11-season run in 2020 and earned over 20 Emmy Awards during its time on air.\n\nMore from Soaps.com\n\nNCIS Star Teases Role on Tony & Ziva Spinoff: 'I'm So Happy'\n\nThe series followed the lives of three different types of families (nuclear, blended and same-sex) living in suburban Los Angeles, who are interrelated through their patriarch, Jay Pritchett, and his two children Claire and Mitchell. It’s now been four years since the show bid farewell, but fans still can’t get enough of it on streaming and want even more seasons. Keep reading to see if Modern Family is getting a reboot. Plus, see which cast members would reprise their roles.\n\nIs Modern Family getting a reboot?\n\nAlthough we don’t know for sure, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who starred as Mitchell Pritchett, has fans speculating that a reboot of some sort might be in the works. On May 23, 2024, Ferguson posted a photo from the Modern Family set on his Instagram Story, captioned: “Haven’t seen this view in a while.” The photo instantly set the internet ablaze and fans had plenty of questions.\n\nDuring a June 4 appearance on The Talk, Ferguson clarified the rumors and revealed: “It’s something I can’t really talk about … Isn’t that annoying.” He teased: “I was on the set with some of my castmates. It’s not a reboot … Is it a movie? I don’t know.” Ferguson added that he “probably shouldn’t have” posted the photo, but noted: “Because people are so excited about this photo, I’m just thrilled that people want us back that much.”\n\nThe actor also said that he “would love to do a reboot,” but claimed fans would know if there was one happening. “But there is something coming out that you’ll like,” he concluded.\n\nSarah Hyland, who portrayed Haley Dunphey, also addressed the rumors and told PEOPLE that she is open to a reboot. In fact, she already has an idea for her character’s storyline. “I would want to see a script first,” she told the outlet. “I think creatively for me, I would want to know what was going on with Haley. I want to see her career back and stuff and her creativity and I want her to be able to do both.” The final season of Modern Family saw Hyland’s character, who is the eldest daughter of Phil (Ty Burrell) and Claire Dunphey (Julie Bowen), struggle to balance her career with motherhood after she welcomed fraternal twins.\n\n“[I want to see Haley] do what Claire [Dunphy] then set out to do and did as an amazing mother as well as businesswoman and CEO,” Hyland continued. “And I would really love to see that creative side back for Haley. So yeah, I don’t know.” When asked if she would want to get the cast back together for a reboot, she answered: “Yes. I love Modern Family so much. I love the cast with my entire heart and soul. I mean, Jesse and I are so close, and his husband Justin and my husband Wells, the four of us vacation together. I would love to be back with everybody.”\n\nThe cast of Modern Family, which also includes Eric Stonestreet, Sofía Vergara, Ed O’Neill, Ariel Winter, Nolan Gould, Rico Rodriguez and Aubrey Anderson-Emmons, are still incredibly close and frequently have cast reunions, sharing photos from the meetups on social media. In March 2024, Ferguson and Bowen reunited to see Anderson-Emmons perform in a school play. The young actress portrayed Lily, the adoptive daughter of Cam (Stonestreet) and Mitchell (Ferguson), for seasons 3-11, landing the role at just 2 years old.\n\n“Took my sis to see the kiddo in her school musical, The Theory of Relativity. So proud of you @aubreyandersonemmons! If you are near @vipstheatre go check it out this weekend,❤️” Ferguson wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of him, Bowen and Anderson-Emmons.\n\nO’Neill, who played family patriarch Jay Pritchett, has also addressed the possibility of a reboot. While promoting his new FX series Clipped, the Married… with Children alum noted that he doesn’t normally like doing reboots, but would be open to it if his castmates are. “I mean, I am open to it,” he told TV Insider. “I like everybody involved, so I wouldn’t be the guy who [says no if everyone else wants to]. I wouldn’t do that.”\n\nThe veteran actor isn’t the only Modern Family star with a new project out. In fact, the majority of the cast have been booked and busy since Modern Family wrapped. Vergara is fresh off her hit Netflix show Griselda and is currently a judge on America’s Got Talent; Hyland recently hosted two seasons of Love Island and is about to star in the romantic comedyThe Token Groomsman; Ferguson just starred in the film All That We Love and Burrell is heading back to ABC for a new sitcom called Forgive and Forget. Perhaps Burrell’s new show will feature some cameos from America’s favorite TV family.\n\nModern Family is available to stream on Hulu.\n\nWatch ‘Modern Family’ on Hulu\n\nPrice: $0+\n\nBuy Now"
