        "text": "Modern Family is a sitcom created by Christopher Lloyd and Steve Levitan. It is a show about three different but related families taking on life one day at a time, but in the most hilarious ways imaginable. The show has gone on to be one of the most-watched shows and is loved by audiences worldwide. It has won several awards, including 22 Emmys wins from 85 nominations. Those are outstanding numbers but if you ask me, I will tell you it probably should have won more of them.\n\nThere are so many different reasons that make the show so special. Unfortunately, they can’t all fit in a single article but I would try to fit in as many as I possibly can. The first thing to point out has to be the writing. From the concept of the showdown to the cheeky lines used in episodes, the writing in the show just stands out from the crowd. A particular tweet from someone that I follow always comes to my mind. It goes something like “ When you watch an episode of Modern Family, prepare yourself to ugly laugh at least five times.’’ The plot of each episode is always creative and so different from the last, even when it comes to the recurrent “holiday’’ episodes. The series always leave you wanting more.\n\nThe characters and the casting are not far from perfect. The actors carry these roles so well that it would make you believe that they are that exact way in real life. The shock on my face when I found out that Nolan Gould, the actor who plays Luke Dunphy is a genius in real life was epic. I had somehow forgotten that they are all just incredible actors. The cast is loveable and this makes the connections we feel with every character amazing. The way they deliver their lines, their facial expressions, and their mannerisms are all top-class. While all the actors are incredible fits for their well-crafted characters, the standouts in my opinion still are Ty Burrell as Phil Dunphy and Sofia Vergara as Gloria Pritchett. I don’t think any person in the world could have played those characters better than those two, but to be fair this applies to the cast in general.\n\nThe issue of diversity is also handled so well in the show. The minority groups in the cast are represented in a way that feels so natural, not like they were added just because there was some quota the creators felt they had to meet. The non-white and LGBTQ characters are portrayed as just our regular day people with their strengths and flaws, trying to navigate everyday life. In the end, that’s how we all really are. Even though these characters do act as symbols of representation for their various minority groups, they do not feel like political additions in any way whatsoever. They all flow amazingly well with the plot and their character developments are amazing to view throughout the series.\n\nThe emotional moments in the show are so perfectly orchestrated. Throughout the series, we become acquainted with the failures, regrets, and societal pressures that each character faces, very much as everyone does in real life. This builds us to get even more invested in the characters because we are now familiar with their flaws and feelings. The show also explores the themes of death and the grieving of a loved one exceptionally well. There are several deaths of significant side characters and we always get an episode dedicated to seeing how the member(s) of the main cast, who were closest to them deal with the loss. Sadness aside, we also get the emotional moments of success, celebrations, and just pure appreciation of family and the ones who mean the most to us. It sends a message that everyone should always cherish the special people in their lives.\n\nThe lack of laughing sound effects is another thing to appreciate about the series. This may just be a personal opinion, but comedy shows just hit harder when there is no background laughing voices. It makes the jokes feel much more natural and lets them settle down better. Sometimes, the sound effects end up overshadowing a joke because of the volume and the viewer may not get to hear it in its entirety. Luckily, there are no such issues when watching Modern Family.\n\nThis show is my favorite of all time and a lot of the time I wish I could watch it all over again. I recommend it as a must-watch for everybody."
