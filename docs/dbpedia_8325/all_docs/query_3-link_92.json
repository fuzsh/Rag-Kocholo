        "text": "Dynasties play a significant role in nearly every industry imaginable today. From politics and doctors to smaller business forms, established families often steer the next generation towards continuing the legacy they already set. However, there can be times when the industry can be overwhelming. Veteran actor Edward James Hyland has been around Hollywood long enough to know how exhausting it can be there. However, his daughter, Sarah Hyland, was adamant about making it and is best-known today as a member of the comedy ensemble of Modern Family.\n\nBorn in Manhattan, New York, to Edward James Hyland and Melissa Canaday, Sarah grew up in her family’s apartment with acting in her blood. Watching her parents work was the primary source of inspiration as she envisioned following in their footsteps. Her father, however, knew how complex the entertainment industry could be and wanted her to take a different career. In the end, Sarah would have her way, earning her first role at the age of five.\n\nPlaying the role of Howard Stern’s daughter in the 1997 film ‘Private Parts,’ Sarah would continue pursuing more roles. She would act alongside Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd in ‘The Object of My Affection’ before seeking more roles in television films.\n\nDespite working towards an acting career, Sarah Hyland continued her studies, attending the Profession performing Arts School to polish her craft. At the same time, she struggled with kidney dysplasia, which was often evident to her co-workers behind the scene. Throughout the years, Sarah would go through several surgeries to improve her health.\n\nAlthough the pain persisted, Sarah endured through it all. When she turned eighteen, Sarah’s determination saw her switch from living in New York to Los Angeles. Her decision proved to be a blessing because only one month later, she would join the ensemble of Modern Family, for which she would be best remembered as Haley Dunphy.\n\nDuring the early years of her career in Modern Family, Sarah’s kidney would continue to worsen. It became too painful for her to stand up straight and filmed some scenes leaning against a table or a wall. By 2012, she had to undergo a transplant from her father. For a while, the matter seemed resolved before the kidney failed, resulting in the need for a second transplant. This time, her younger brother Ian would step up to help her recover. Following the surgeries, Sarah would resume her work, impressing her onscreen family with her stoic drive to continue in front of the camera.\n\nAlthough Sarah spent the better part of her career with the show, she managed to earn guest roles in other projects like ‘Punk’d,’ ‘Bonnie & Clyde’, and ‘Childrens Hospital,’ to name a few. Additionally, Sarah started to showcase her singing abilities, covering songs like ‘Closer’ and ‘Don’t Wanna Know’ with Boyce Avenue.\n\nSince leaving home to make it out on her own, Sarah Hyland has braved through many tribulations, overcoming her health problems and enduring an abusive relationship. Today she is engaged with radio personality Wells Adams. Following the series finale of Modern Family, Sarah is set to join another project produced by ABC titled ‘Yours, Mine, & Paul.’\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://www.aceshowbiz.com/celebrity/sarah_hyland/biography.html\n\nhttps://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/sarah-hyland.html\n\nhttps://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/sarah-hyland/\n\nhttps://www.thelist.com/210589/the-untold-truth-of-sarah-hyland/\n\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2020/05/19/modern-family-book-what-we-learned-sarah-hyland-fred-willard/3109163001/"
