        "text": "Highest Rated: 73% My Fake Boyfriend (2022)\n\nLowest Rated: 0% Satanic (2016)\n\nBirthday: Nov 24, 1990\n\nBirthplace: New York, New York, USA\n\nTalented comedic actress Sarah Hyland found the perfect role playing the high-maintenance teen Haley Dunphy on the Emmy-winning sitcom, \"Modern Family\" (ABC, 2009- ). Starting her showbiz career at age seven as one of Howard Stern's daughters in the feature film \"Private Parts\" (1997), the young actress began nabbing roles in such diverse projects as the feature comedy \"The Object of My Affection\" (1998) and as a young Audrey Hepburn in the TV movie \"The Audrey Hepburn Story\" (ABC, 2000). Her performance as Brooke Shields' daughter on \"Lipstick Jungle\" (NBC, 2008-09) further showcased her talents. After the show was cancelled, within weeks she landed the juicy part of the eldest Dunphy sibling on the hilarious comedy \"Modern Family.\" Although in her twenties, Hyland effectively portrayed the vain and reckless teenager, yet would also prove her mettle with more mature roles in the films \"Geek Charming\" (2011), \"Cougars, Inc.\" (2011), and indie dramas \"See You in Valhalla\" (2015) and \"XOXO\" (2016), on which she also took producer credits, pointing toward an expanding behind the scenes role.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n73% My Fake Boyfriend 71% XOXO\n\n65% Joe Gould's Secret\n\n44% The Wedding Year\n\n33% Struck by Lightning\n\n30% Date and Switch\n\n20% The Audrey Hepburn Story\n\n19% Dirty Dancing\n\nPhotos\n\nGood Morning America, Sarah Hyland, 11/03/1975, ©ABC The View, Nicolle Wallace (L), Sarah Hyland (C), Whoopi Goldberg (R), 08/11/1997, ©ABC Modern Family, from left: Julie Bowen, Ed O'Neill, Sofia Vergara, Sarah Hyland, 'Australia', Season 5, Ep. #20, 04/23/2014, ©ABC The View, Whoopi Goldberg (L), Sarah Hyland (C), Nicolle Wallace (R), 08/11/1997, ©ABC None None None None None None STRUCK BY LIGHTNING, Sarah Hyland (left), 2012. ph: Suzanne Houchin/©Tribeca Film Modern Family, from left: Christian Barillas, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Eric Stonestreet, Ariel Winter, Nolan Gould, Sarah Hyland, Barry Corbin, Aubrey Anderson-Emmons, Sofia Vergara, Ed O'Neill, 'The Wedding, Part 2', Season 5, Ep. #24, 05/21/2014, ©ABC SCARY MOVIE 5, Sarah Hyland (center), 2013./©Weinstein Company CRADLE WILL ROCK, Barbara Sukowa, Sarah Hyland, Evan Katz, John Turturro, Alysia Zucker, 1999, family marching Modern Family, Sarah Hyland, 'Haley's 21st Birthday', Season 6, Ep. #10, 12/10/2014, ©ABC Modern Family, Sarah Hyland (L), Sofia Vergara (C), Julie Bowen (R), 'Haley's 21st Birthday', Season 6, Ep. #10, 12/10/2014, ©ABC Modern Family, Sarah Hyland (L), Sofia Vergara (C), Julie Bowen (R), 'Haley's 21st Birthday', Season 6, Ep. #10, 12/10/2014, ©ABC Modern Family, from left: Sarah Hyland, Christian Barillas, Nathan Lane, Ty Burrell, 'The Wedding, Part 2', Season 5, Ep. #24, 05/21/2014, ©ABC Modern Family, from left: Ariel Winter, Christian Barillas, Sarah Hyland, Nathan Lane, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Eric Stonestreet, 'The Wedding, Part 2', Season 5, Ep. #24, 05/21/2014, ©ABC Modern Family, Sarah Hyland, 'The Day Alex Left for College', Season 7, Ep. #2, 09/30/2015, ©ABC\n\nFilmography\n\nMovies\n\nCredit 73% 55% My Fake Boyfriend Kelly (Character) - 2022 44% 50% The Wedding Year Mara (Character) - 2019 No Score Yet No Score Yet Espectacular 90 aniversario de Mickey Unknown (Character) - 2018 19% 35% Dirty Dancing Lisa Houseman (Character) - 2017 71% 52% XOXO Krystal (Character) - 2016 0% 17% Satanic Chloe (Character) $205 2016 No Score Yet 62% The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar Tiifu (Voice) - 2015 0% 32% See You in Valhalla Johana Burwood (Character),\n\nProducer - 2015 30% 38% Date and Switch Ava (Character) - 2014 17% 56% Vampire Academy Natalie Dashkov (Character) $7.8M 2014 No Score Yet 62% Call Me Crazy: A Five Film Unknown (Character) - 2013 33% 52% Struck by Lightning Claire Mathews (Character) - 2012 No Score Yet 39% Conception Tracey (Character) - 2011 No Score Yet 56% Geek Charming Dylan Schoenfield (Character) - 2011 No Score Yet 18% Cougars, Inc.
