        "text": "Earlier this week, actress Sofía Vergara, who starred in the ABC hit series Modern Family, shared a look at the recent reunion she shared with two of her former co-stars, whom she describes as some of her most favorite people on earth.\n\nVergara played Gloria Pritchett on the ABC show alongside her TV husband, Jay Pritchett, played by actor Ed O’Neill. This week, the actress took to Instagram to share photos of her time with actress Julie Bowen and actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who played siblings Claire Dunphy and Mitchell Pritchett on the show.\n\nABC’s “Modern Family”\n\nModern Family is an American sitcom television series created by Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan for the Disney-owned ABC network. The series ran for 11 seasons, beginning on September 23, 2009, and ending on April 8, 2020. The critically acclaimed sitcom follows the lives of three diverse families living in Los Angeles, each of which is connected via the patriarch of the family, Jay Pritchett, played by actor Ed O’Neill (Married With Children).\n\nO’Neill is joined by a talented cast in the series, including Sofia Vergara, Julie Bowen, Ty Burrell, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Sarah Hyland,\n\nEach episode of the series is presented as a “mockumentary,” as various family members give their perspectives on the situations at hand and allow the viewer more insight than he or she could have had without the show’s mockumentary-style delivery. The creators of the show have said they were inspired to develop the show by their own “modern families.”\n\nThe series ran an impressive 11 seasons and features 11 core characters (12 beginning in Season Four with the birth of a new baby), five of which were children or teenagers when the series began. Each of the original characters remained in their roles–causing the show to garner even more fans who appreciated the opportunity to get to know the characters as they were embodied by the actors cast to play them.\n\nThe series won numerous awards, including an Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in each of its first five years, as well as an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series four times, twice each for Eric Stonestreet and Ty Burrell, as well as the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series twice for Julie Bowen. In total, Modern Family was the recipient of 22 Emmy Awards from 75 nominations.\n\nBut for actress Sofia Vergara, who played Gloria Pritchett in the series, the cast of Modern Family became like her own family.\n\nA “Modern Family” Reunion\n\nOn Tuesday, Vergara shared photos of her impromptu reunion with Julie Bowen and Jesse Tyler Ferguson on Instagram, saying that her former co-stars are some of her “favorite people in the world.”\n\nJesse Tyler Ferguson included the meet-up with his former co-stars in the celebration of his 48th birthday and also posted photos to Instagram.\n\nFans of the long-running comedy and drama series say they’re keeping their hopes up for a reunion in which the entire cast is present."
