        "text": "E! took viewers behind the scenes of \"Modern Family\" with a special presentation about the hit comedy. There were interviews with the cast, and a few interesting secrets about the show. One of those was that ABC wasn't all too happy with that cast in the beginning. While it's been widely reported that the network wanted Craig T. Nelson over Ed O'Neill, that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nABC originally passed on Ty Burrell and was pursuing Matt LeBlanc for his role. Julie Bowen wasn't even being considered for the show because she was pregnant at the time. In fact, Kristen Johnston and Lisa Kudrow were in the running, which would have made for a very unusual weekly \"Friends\" reunion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe network also originally wanted Jesse Tyler Ferguson to play the more flamboyant Cam, rather than buttoned-down Mitchell. Luckily, though, they didn't get their way. Instead they got a critical darling, a ratings smash, and a cast that's winning tons of awards, and getting nominated for even more.\n\nAnd that cast has grown so close that they took the time during the special to make fun of one of their own: Sofia Vergara. Her accent is apparently just too tempting to not try and mimic.\n\n“I’ve been here for 18 years in this country and I sound still like this,\" Vergara said. But it's an accent that people love, just like her character. And fans will get to see and hear more of her when \"Modern Family\" returns for Season 5 on September 25 on ABC."
