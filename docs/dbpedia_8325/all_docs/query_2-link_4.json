        "text": "It’s summer, which means sunshine, the beach, swimwear and, of course, a new season of Love Island USA. As viewers wait for the action on the Peacock original series to heat up, they know that they’ll be ushered through every moment of it by the series’ host, Sarah Hyland.\n\nAlthough she’s a newer addition to the Love Island family, Hyland came into the mix with a bang and immediately captivated both newcomers and longtime Love Island fans alike with her sparkling personality and propensity to salivate with us all over the coupling drama that happens in the villa. Despite loving her on the show, some may still be unfamiliar with who she is and what she did before coming to Love Island (as well as where the heck she goes when she’s not stirring up drama for the Islanders).\n\nRELATED: Find Out What Ariana Madix Will Be Doing When She Appears on Love Island USA Season 5\n\nWell, fear not reality TV fans because we’re here to answer all your burning questions about the host of Love Island USA, Sarah Hyland.\n\nWho is Sarah Hyland?\n\nOK, we’ll start with the obvious one. Before she was the host of Love Island USA, many fans may recognize her from her various acting roles (one specifically, but we’ll get to that).\n\nShe actually made her debut playing the role of Howard Stern’s daughter in the movie Private Parts in 1997. From there, she appeared in a variety of smaller and guest roles in films and TV shows. Like most great actors, she appeared on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Law & Order: Trial by Jury and the flagship Law & Order throughout the early 2000s.\n\nHowever, it was in 2009 that she hit the big time landing the role of Haley Dunphy in the smash-hit sitcom Modern Family, which didn’t end its run until April 2020. During that time she also took on some film roles in movies like Vampire Academy, Satanic and the Peacock original film Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin.\n\nIn addition to being an actress, in 2018 Hyland became a mental and physical health advocate by sharing her deeply personal health journey that saw her get 16 surgeries by the time she was 28, six within the same 16-month span. She revealed she has kidney dysplasia, which led to two transplants, as well as a surgery for another condition, endometriosis, which is very common among women yet difficult to find treatment. She told SELF living with the chronic illness gave her very depressed thoughts. Fortunately, today she is living happy and healthy while still managing her chronic conditions.\n\nWho Is Sarah Hyland married to?\n\nIn 2022, Hyland tied the knot with radio personality and Bachelor Nation alum, Wells Adams.\n\nThe duo first started dating in 2017, shortly after he was on The Big D host JoJo Fletcher’s season of The Bachelorette. While his journey there did not result in him finding love, he caught the attention of the Modern Family star and they began flirting on social media. Not long after, they made their romance official for the world to know. He popped the question on a beach in 2019 and, after a delayed wedding due to the pandemic, they finally got hitched and are currently living their happily ever after.\n\nHow Long has Sarah Hyland hosted Love Island USA?\n\nSarah Hyland got a text to be the new host of Love Island USA just before Season 4 of the series aired.\n\nShe spent the entirety of last season moving the couples along through the show process (with a little help from the narration of all-star voice talent Iain Stirling) until a winner was chosen. Now, she’s back to do it all again in Season 5."
