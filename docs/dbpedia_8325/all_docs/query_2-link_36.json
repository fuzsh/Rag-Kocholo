        "text": "Season 1\n\nHaley is described by Claire as being very much like her when she was a teenager, so she tries to prevent Haley from making the same mistakes. Haley starts dating Dylan in the first episode. Claire is disappointed with Haley's choice of boyfriend, due to his low intelligence, lack of manners, and the age difference between them. She keeps an eye on Haley's relationship, which Haley is continuously annoyed by. Phil likes him and is happy with Haley dating Dylan, but is wary of them moving too fast and tries to make sure nothing sexual happens. He is highly protective of Haley but struggles to keep up with her, which makes it easy for Haley to manipulate him. However, she rarely gets anything past Claire.\n\nHaley gets her learner's permit and learns how to drive from her parents, but she is a dangerous driver who doesn't learn from them so they get another instructor. She is afraid of failing her driver's test, but ultimately passes.\n\nHaley and Alex frequently bicker, and Alex tends to have the upper hand due to her ability to manipulate and annoy Haley (once convincing Haley she would lose Dylan to a girl with tattoos in \"Fizbo\") but Haley also annoys Alex (falsely believing Alex read her journal, she defiled Alex's signed poster and Alex stated she would never forgive her in \"Not in My House\"). She has a better relationship with Luke as he never intentionally does anything to annoy her. Her step-uncle, Manny, develops a crush on her (\"Great Expectations\") which she finds gross and shuts down but also uses to her advantage at times.\n\nSeason 2\n\nDylan wins Haley back after performing a song outside her house on Valentine's Day. Haley tells her family that she does not want to go to college because she believes it's a waste of time. But she later explains to Alex that she's scared about leaving high school since she's barely passing the 11th grade.\n\nSeason 3\n\nWhile vacationing with the family in Wyoming, Dylan proposes to Haley in front of her entire family. Claire immediately says no for her, causing tension in their relationship since Haley believes that her mother won't let her make her own decisions. However, Haley reveals to Claire that she was going to say \"no\" to Dylan's proposal anyway but wanted the choice to. Haley and Dylan break up once again. She is afraid that she won't be accepted into a college, but she is wait-listed by a college at the end of \"Election Day\". After months of waiting and finally accepting that she won't be accepted into a college, she decides to move in with Dylan after she graduates. Luke confesses though that he hid her acceptance letter (along with a lot of other mail) because he doesn't want her to go. After finding out that she is, in fact, going to college, she and Dylan decide to go to prom.\n\nSeason 4\n\nHaley finally goes to the college (\"Schooled\"). But is kicked out for underage drinking and (accidental) battery of a police officer. She then moves back in with her family and starts having to deal with the pressure from her parents to attend community college, go to work and get her life together in general before she is able to re-apply at the college next semester.\n\nSeason 5\n\nHaley is back living with her parents and attending community college. In \"Three Dinners\" she is pressured by her parents who do not believe she has any future plans or aspirations, but she proves them wrong by revealing her interest in fashion photography, and the blog she is keeping to earn extra money. In \"ISpy\", her work is featured in a photography exhibition (one of only five in her class chosen) and one of her photographs is sold. In \"A Fair to Remember\", Haley encounters Andy for the first time. Although, initially, they don't completely hit it off; as the day continues, they seem to have developed a mutual liking for one another as evidenced by their playful banter and friendly teasing. As the season progresses, so too does Haley's feelings for Andy. In \"Other People's Children,\" Haley steps in as a stand-in for Andy's girlfriend Beth for the video love letter he's making for her with Phil's help. Andy lifts Haley up and holds her in his arms and looks deep into her eyes as he recites how much he loves his girlfriend. The look on Haley's face confirms she is beginning to fall for the nice guy.\n\nLater, Haley watches Andy lovingly as he and Phil reenact the movie \"Gravity.\" She tells Alex, \"It's weird. There's something about him.\" Alex replies, \"Yeah, he's just like Dad.\" Despite this comparison grossing Haley out initially, she can't seem to stop the feelings she is developing for Andy. In \"The Wedding (Part 1)\", Haley agrees to drive Andy to the airport. When Andy's phone rings, he asks Haley to answer it because he doesn't want to put their lives at risk since he's driving. Haley reads a text that his flight has been delayed and also sees a text from Beth telling Andy that it's over. At the coffee shop, Haley confronts Andy about the text message and if he is sure about getting on that plane. Andy tells Haley that Beth just likes the drama and that Haley should drop the issue. In \"The Wedding (Part 2),\" Haley can't stop checking her phone due to concern about Andy. Alex confronts Haley about her feelings for Andy, which Haley denies. Alex finds the whole thing hilarious because Andy is not Haley's usual type.\n\nHaley returns to the coffee shop and tells Andy he \"deserves better\" than Beth. After returning to the new wedding venue (Cam and Mitch's house), Haley keeps checking her phone for updates on Andy. She tells Alex she is going to invite Andy to hang out at the wedding. Alex warns Haley that she better know what she is doing. Alex tells her, \"Here's the thing about nice, quiet dorks like Andy. You get over us much faster than we get over you.\" With Alex's warning fresh in her mind, Haley lies and tells Andy she was speaking generally when Andy calls her to ask if she meant anyone in particular when she said he deserved better. She tells Andy, \"The hardest part is just figuring out what you want.\" Andy says that's what he thought and they say goodbye to each other disappointed. Unbeknownst to Haley, Andy pulls away in a taxi that was waiting right outside the house.\n\nSeason 6\n\nHaley is still living in the basement of her parents' house. On her 21st birthday, her Dad buys her a brand new car. She gets a job working as the assistant to fashion designer, Gavin Sinclair after she and Andy help each other prepare for job interviews. In \"The Cold\", Andy and Haley share their first kiss, which visibly affects Haley. Despite kissing, Andy and Haley continue to be just friends. It's revealed throughout the season that they have been spending a lot of time together. They attend a carnival (\"Closet? You'll Love It!\") and a Radiohead concert (\"American Skyper\"), get cronuts together (\"Connection Lost\"), and even help each other prepare for job interviews that help them to secure job positions (\"Queer Eyes, Full Hearts\"); however, both secretly have stronger feelings than just friends for one another. When Haley visits Andy in the hospital before his appendectomy surgery and believing Andy is unconscious, Haley confesses he has a shot with her (\"Closet? You'll Love It!\").\n\nA couple of weeks later, after Andy can't stop thinking about Haley, he decides to have the big talk with her about what she had told him in the hospital, but, unfortunately, she's now dating a doctor she met on that same day (\"Grill, Interrupted\"). Later, she tells Andy that she isn't looking for anything serious so Andy decides against telling her how he really feels. Without knowing how Haley really feels about him and due to Phil's encouragement to propose to Beth, after Andy told him he has a \"serious connection\" with another girl, Andy decides to propose to his girlfriend, Beth, in \"American Skyper.\" Haley confides in her Dad about how she thinks Beth is after her because Beth thinks Haley is in love with Andy. Phil asks her if she is and Haley says \"no\" and then goes on to say that she cares about him, he makes her laugh, and she likes spending time with him.\n\nPhil asks if she thinks about Andy when he is not around. She replies, \"Sometimes I see something funny and I think, 'Oh, Andy would love that; I wish he were here so I could share it with him.'\" Phil replies, \"That sounds like love to me.\" With tears in her eyes, Haley says it doesn't matter anyway because he's in love with someone else. Andy knocks on the door and enters the room as Haley wipes her eyes. He has come to say goodbye. Haley and Andy hug, and Phil, who is watching them, realizes based on Andy's facial expressions that Haley is the girl Andy was talking about earlier. Phil tries to tell them that they love each other and that Andy is making a huge mistake by proposing to Beth, but they cannot hear him as the sound on his iPad has gone off. Andy leaves with Beth to head to the beach where he is planning to propose to her that day. Haley closes the front door behind them and stomps off upset and frustrated.\n\nSeason 7\n\nIn \"Express Yourself\", Haley is still living in the basement of her parents' house while working in fashion. She is no longer attending her two-year community college because she graduated after spending three years there. In \"Summer Lovin\", in May, Haley tries to stop Andy proposing to Beth, but Claire makes her consider if she's sure about what she's about to do. Andy proposes to Beth, and Haley watches, heartbroken. Two months later, a depressed Haley starts dating Dylan again, Andy accidentally overhears Phil and Claire talking about how Haley tried to stop the proposal. He becomes so distressed that he eats his feelings, gaining weight. Haley is made aware of this, who confronts him but he brushes it off and they continue their respective relationships. In \"The More You Ignore Me\", Haley and Dylan run into Andy and Beth at the movies, Andy has lost weight but things are awkward between Andy and Haley, however they all go out for burgers and beers together. Afterwards, Haley breaks up with Dylan in her car while driving back home.\n\nIn \"Phil's Sexy, Sexy House\", a couple of weeks later, Haley encounters Andy again in a house Phil's trying to sell. They almost kiss on the couch before they hear other intruders and hide. When everyone leaves and it's safe for them to come back out, they blame their almost kiss on the sexiness of the house. Once Haley exits the house, she immediately runs back in to give Andy a passionate kiss, which he willingly reciprocates. In \"Clean Out Your Junk Drawer\", it's revealed that Andy and Haley continued their affair, but no one is aware of it except from them. In \"White Christmas\", they are eventually caught by Haley's family due to Lily believing she heard a noise from a closet. Phil encourages Andy to break up with Beth if he wants Haley, or stop with Haley if he wants Beth. Andy and Beth break up, and he starts dating Haley. It's also revealed that Andy passed his real estate license test after Haley helped him cram.\n\nIn \"The Storm\", Andy tells Haley he wants to slow things down a bit between them in order for them to catch up emotionally to where they are physically so they don't burn out and wants to wait for the perfect moment so they can start their relationship right. Haley points out that they are in a perfect moment and they share a romantic kiss out in the storm. In \"Express Yourself\", Haley tells Andy, \"I love normal Andy. Tomato-soup-and-grilled-cheese Andy. Still-in-bed-by-11:00 Andy. Uses-the-word-tummy Andy... I like the me I am when I'm with you.\". In \"Double Click\", Andy's cousin Evan offers him his dream career as a real estate agent, but he'd have to relocate back to Utah. Phil and Haley tell Andy to take the job so he does. Haley and Andy decide to do a long-distance relationship. As they say goodbye to each other at the airport, Andy tells Haley he doesn't regret a single minute he spent with her and Haley tells Andy he is the first man she ever loved.\n\nSeason 8\n\nIn \"A Stereotypical Day\", Haley got fired from her job as an assistant fashion designer, and planned to hide it from her parents until she got a new job. But when Alex came home from college because she has infectious mononucleosis, she worked it out and told their parents after Haley lied that she would quit her job and nurse her sister back to health. In \"Blindsided\", Haley decided to stop looking for a job and becomes a Social Media Club Promoter. Phil was more accepting than Claire was, but later changes his mind and takes her to see Merv Schechter to apply to be his new assistant.
