        "text": "I don’t know how she did this: “There are some episodes of Modern Family where I do not remember filming because I was asleep. Dead-ass asleep,” she said. “I was not able to be awake for eight hours at a time. I was so exhausted all the time,” she explained, noting that she was only able to stay awake from the very moments scenes began and finished shooting. “I’d be on the set, we’d be filming, I’d be dead asleep, my head on the table, I would hear, ‘and…’ and my head would go up.”\n\nF—ing high heels: She and Jesse went on to recall a specific day that they were shooting a scene that involved her pushing a car. Jesse begins, “I remember a day when we were shooting—I don’t remember the specifics of the scene, and you might not remember it because I think you were in an intense amount of pain that day—but we were pushing a car?” In response, Sarah revealed that she actually had gout in her foot at the time, which meant that she had to use crutches on set. “I was on dialysis, I had gout. It was wild,” she said, before later explaining that she got gout after being put on medication for retaining too much water. Then, Sarah revealed that despite being in the “most excruciating pain,” the Modern Family producers “insisted” that she film the scene in high heels. “They put me in high heels,” she said. “They had not established my outfit yet, and they insisted that I was wearing heels.”\n\nJesse took care of her: “I remember there was a day on set… I think I was in rejection on dialysis, and I was just in an extreme amount of pain,” she said. Explaining that “there wasn’t enough time” to go back to her trailer in between takes, Sarah said, “But I also could barely move. So I found a little corner, I sat in a chair… and I was just kind of curled up into a ball.” Sarah told Jesse, “You came up to me and very lightly touched me on the shoulder… You were just like, ‘Can I get you anything? Is there anything you need? I’m here for you.’”"
