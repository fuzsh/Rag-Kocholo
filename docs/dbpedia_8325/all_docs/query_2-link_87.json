        "text": "Ed O’Neill & Catherine Rusoff (Married)\n\nThe patriarch. The myth. The man. We’re talking about Jay Pritchett, obvs. This guy definitely isn’t going to be able to enjoy his semi-retirement peacefully; between chasing Gloria, his kid Joe, his step-kid Manny and his grand-kids, well…livin’ ain’t easy. There’s no doubt that the show wouldn’t be the same without him. On the show he’s a divorcee that’s remarried a younger, Colombian beauty, however, in real life, he’s had a lot more staying power; he’s been married to Catherine Rusoff since 1986…that’s over 30 years! That number of years with the same person is something millennials definitely won’t be able to wrap their heads around!\n\nThe pair met whilst they were on the sitcom Married…with Children, (a series for which O’Neill, as Al Bundy, was nominated for two Golden Globes!) and have been together ever since. While Ed continues with his role on Modern Family, his wife Catherine has since had her curtain call and is focused on spending time with their two daughters, Sophia and Claire.\n\nSofia Vergara & Joe Manganiello (Married)\n\nLook, if any woman is going to get the hunky, gorgeous, demi-god-like man which is Joe Manganiello, it is most certainly going to be Sofia Vergara! The Colombian actress who plays Jay’s Latina wife, Gloria, is an absolute stunner; with her curvaceous figure and long dark hair, we know she stops traffic not only on the show but in real life! It’s no wonder she caught the attention of ex-werewolf Manganiello. Ex-werewolf you ask? Surely you remember his role on the blood-sucking drama True Blood? The one where he took his shirt off basically every episode. Ah yes, that got your attention didn’t it?\n\nVergara, who is 4 years Manganiello’s senior, is definitely still smoking hot at 46 years of age! Yes, that’s right, 46! The pair got engaged just six months after they started dating and got married beach-side in 2015. Since then they’ve experienced wedded bliss and are one of Hollywood’s hottest couples! If they ever decide to have kids (we hope they do!) we know they’ll be absolutely gorgeous!\n\nJulie Bowen & Scott Phillips (Divorced)\n\nThe woman who holds it all together, Claire Dunphy, is next on our list. Super-mom, homemaker and… let’s face it, control freak, has left us with…well, a little bit of a crush really. Married to Phil, sometimes we think her role is basically just a lot of head-shaking and yelling, but that’s why we love her! Claire’s marriage to Phil works well: the pair even pretended to pick each other up at a bar, which was guaranteed to end hilariously, however in real-life, things are not quite so rosy.\n\nIn 2003, Bowen tied the knot with software developer and real-estate investor Scott Phillips. It seems that after 14 years and three kids, the pair were decidedly not happily married and went their separate ways. We’re sure that with a career and three kids to juggle she will still be kept extremely busy and be able to move on with her life.\n\nTy Burrell & Holly Burrell (Married)\n\nThe moment Phil Dunphy walks into the room, all eyes are glued on him, awaiting his next move. Anything he touches turns into a disaster, which becomes comedy gold! Any idea he has…well, you know what we mean! We still can’t get over the alpaca. The hilarious, yet extremely quirky Phil is forever trying to be the “cool” dad…when really, he just can’t seem to win the approval of his kids. Except for Luke of course! He’s got his dad’s back! But when Ty Burrell isn’t making his on-screen wife pull her hair out on Modern Family, he is happily married to his professional chef wife, Holly.\n\nWhilst we often sadly see celebrity relationships break down, Ty and Holly may have found the secret; pursuing careers in different industries! Holly actually started out in the entertainment world just like Ty; it seems fitting that the pair first met at the Shakespeare Theatre in Washington D.C. Look, if we’re ever invited over for dinner (the chances may be slim but we’re hopeful), we’ll sure be in for a treat!\n\nJesse Tyler Ferguson & Justin Mikita (Married)\n\n“I actually came out to my Dad three times before he acknowledged it. I’m not sure if maybe he was hoping he heard it wrong, like I said ‘Dad, I’m grey.’” Pretty sure you know who would’ve said this; it’s Jay’s first son, Mitchell Pritchett! Of course, we know that he makes up half of the fabulous gay couple in the series, alongside his partner in crime, Cameron Tucker. Mitchell is most definitely the calmer, more grounded partner…though he isn’t without his occasional moments! He definitely is the yin to Tucker’s flamboyant yang, though we know that whilst the pair have on-screen magic, Eric Stonestreet just isn’t the right man for Jesse.\n\nTyler Ferguson is married to actor and producer Justin Mikita, with whom he dated for many years before walking down the aisle in 2013! Mikita, who is also an activist and social innovator, seems to be quite the interior decorator; recently the couple were featured on Architectural Digest’s website for their stylish home. Who says you can’t have it all?! Oh, and we’re totally gaga over the fact they’re tight with John Legend and supermodel wife Chrissie Teigen!\n\nEric Stonestreet & Lindsay Schweitzer (Dating)\n\nThere’s certainly only room for one kween on the show – and that is of course Cameron Tucker. His temper-tantrums and antics bring so much life and comic relief to the show, he’s like the Hawaiian shirt of the family! Portrayed by Eric Stonestreet, who, to many people’s surprise is straight, it is clear that Eric has an amazing talent! Who would’ve thought a straight guy could play such a wonderfully flamboyant lead!\n\nOutside of the show, Eric has been seen strolling the red carpet with his lady love, Lindsay Schweitzer. The pair have been dating since mid-2017, and the combination of actor and pediatric nurse seems to be well, without us sounding corny, a match made in heaven! Sources say the pair met at a charity event, and she and Stonestreet have been joined at the hip, ever since!\n\nSarah Hyland & Wells Adams (Dating)\n\nWe’ve reached our resident troublemaker/party girl/ make-up artist/ drama queen (watch out Gloria…and Cameron!) Haley Dunphy. Whilst she may not possess even a quarter of the brains her sister Alex has, she certainly has the looks which…in a teenage girl’s world, are totally, like, more important! The eldest of the Dunphy’s, she seems to be only interested in boys and partying – though her family is constantly shaking their heads at her poor dating choices. Love is blind, okay?!\n\nWhilst she seems to have trouble with the opposite sex on the show, in real life, Sarah Hyland doesn’t have a problem at all! The dark-haired beauty is dating reality TV-star Wells Adams. Recently, he’s been in a little hot water over being able to afford a ring for his lady, after radio hosts Bobby Bones, Lunchbox and Amy Brown claimed the 34-year-old couldn’t afford to buy her a ring, and also dissed him for living in her LA home! To be fair…she’s certainly making enough bank to cover the ring AND the wedding. Don’t worry Wells, your baby girl’s got you.\n\nAdam DeVine & Chloe Bridges (Dating)\n\nSure, Haley Dunphy seems to chew through boyfriends like the dog does her homework, but we think she’ll always have a soft spot for Andy Bailey. Of course, now that you’re looking at his face…you can surely place him! Yep, that’s right, he’s the very sassy Bumper from Pitch Perfect! Whilst he doesn’t exactly have a singing role on Modern Family, he’s definitely made his mark on the show. In real life, he’s something of a comedic genius, what with his work on Pitch Perfect, as well as on the show Workaholics. Quite a talented guy, eh?\n\nBut whilst he may play cute and coy on the show, in real life he’s snagged himself a real diamond! His girlfriend, Chloe Bridges, is quite the stunner. The pair, dating since 2015, recently enjoyed a long romantic European holiday. There were rumors spreading he was going to pop the question, as he was booking the honeymoon suites (lucky gal!) but he’s assured the media he has no plans on getting hitched anytime soon!\n\nJoe Mande & Kylie Augustine (Married)\n\nA relative latecomer to the show is stand-up comedian Joe Mande. The walking funny bone portrays Ben, Alex Dunphy’s love interest in season 8 of Modern Family. Whilst he only makes a brief appearance on the show, it’s his real-life that has us interested! Quickly gaining in popularity, the actor-comedian is also a writer, and a huge animal lover!\n\nTogether with his wife Kylie Augustine, (as well as their kids!) Joe’s home has become something of a dog shelter – just check out Kylie’s Instagram! So…many…puppies! The couple tied the knot in 2015, and, refreshingly, have decided to keep their private life, well, private! Not only does it give their beautiful family a chance to grow without the pressure and the media spotlight, but also some privacy! That’s no joke! (ha…ha...)\n\nFred Willard & Mary Willard (Were Married)\n\nIt’s only fitting really that the father of Phil Dunphy would be equally as hysterical as his son! The funny gene runs deep in the Dunphy family, and fans of the show were well in their rights to be introduced to the person from whom Phil gets some of his best dad jokes! Playing Frank Dunphy was Fred Willard. Don’t think this was his first comedic rodeo – oh no, Fred was very well known on the comedy circuit! Best known for his roles in This Is Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, A Mighty Wind, For Your Consideration and of course, Anchorman, Fred was a great fit on the show! You have probably also recognized him from his recurring role on Everybody Loves Raymond as Hank MacDougall, Robert Barone’s father-in-law!\n\nThey say that looks fade, but humor never does…and that was probably the secret to his and Mary Willard’s 51-year marriage! The pair married in 1968, and, all credit to them, have managed to weather the paparazzi raining down on them (oh yes, as if we wouldn’t put a Dad-worthy pun in there!) as well as the Hollywood spotlight. Sadly, however, both Willard and his beloved wife are no longer with us.\n\nNathan Lane & Devlin Elliott (Married)\n\nOkay, so we’re having a bit of a moment with this next character. Nathan Lane! Like, Nathan Lane! He’s only appeared in over 45 films, including The Lion King, The Birdcage, Mouse Hunt, and The Producers! The 62-year old plays Sherman “Pepper” Saltzman, one of Mitchell and Cameron’s extravagant gay friends, and, somewhat controversially…he dated Cameron before the series began! Back to Mr. Lane, you’ve seen The Birdcage, you’ll totally understand when we say we feel he’s reprised his role. So, so, fabulous darling! The best part; Pepper’s eccentricity, obnoxiousness and dramatic flair are almost on par with his real-life self!\n\nA renowned Broadway performer, he has impressively won three Tony Awards, as well as six Drama Desk awards, six Outer Critic’s Circle Awards, two Obies…two Golden Globe nominations…a Screen Actor’s Guild Award….AND a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. There are more accolades he has accumulated over the years, but we’re exhausted already! And how wonderful that he has a partner (sorry, husband!) that is just as dazzling, and talented! Sharing the highs (and lows, no doubt) of his career with his long-time theatre-producer boyfriend, Devlin Elliott, Nathan Lane has certainly found his life partner. The pair dated for 18 years (!!!) before deciding to make things official. These days the power-couple are still going strong, albeit with an adorable side hobby; launching a children’s book series following the life of a French bulldog, named Mabel. We love it and love him!!\n\nElizabeth Banks & Max Handelman (Married)\n\nAnother one of Mitchell and Cameron’s closest friends is the wildly glamorous Sal. But while she’s a great friend and all (well, most of the time), she does have her dark side. I mean, who fights with a little girl? Confused? Well, she seems to despise little Lily (Say what?!). Why’s that? Because the couple started “hanging out” with their DAUGHTER more than with her after the adoption. Priorities, friends. Once a party girl, always a party girl it seems; we see in the show that Cameron and Mitchell are constantly having to put her on the straight and narrow! The things we do for our friends, huh?\n\nYou’ll be pleased to know that in real life she’s definitely not as flaky, nor as party-girl! The famous actress has been married for 16 years to Max Handelman. It seems that he’s the type of man that can handle a lot of things! (There’s our inner Phil coming out again, apologies). An American sportswriter, film producer and blogger, he’s just as talented as his stunning wife! The pair have two gorgeous children together, Magnus and Felix.\n\nNathan Fillion & Krista Allen (Rumored)\n\nYou basically know you’ve got the job of weather-man when your name is Rainer Shine, right? We’d hire him on the spot! Look, we got serious narcissistic vibes from this dude…and sure, Haley might be a bit vain, but this guy’s just too much! In Season 8, he proposes to Haley, which doesn’t sit well with Phil at all! Alas, it wasn’t meant to be, when the pair have doubts after five minutes…awkward.\n\nWhile he plays the most self-obsessed character we’ve encountered on the show, he is the total opposite in real life! He and author PJ Haarsma co-founded the NFP organisation Kids Need to Read – what an awesome pair of humans. We really don’t know much about his real-life partner; however, rumors are swirling that he is currently dating Krista Allen, an American actress of soap-opera fame on Days of Our Lives and Baywatch! She also is known for her on-again, off-again romance with heartthrob George Clooney.\n\nRob Riggle & Tiffany Riggle (Married)\n\nIn any industry, it’s a given that you’re up against some competition…even rivalry. That’s exactly who Gil Thorpe is to Phil Dunphy. We could probably even go as far as to say nemesis! You’ll know Rob Riggle’s face when you see it – he’s popped up in quite a slew of US films and TV shows; and he’s quite the comedian. You might’ve seen him in The Hangover, The Other Guys, The Lorax, 21 Jump Street or of course, Step Brothers!\n\nBefore Riggle was an actor, he served as a US Marine – so not only has he served his country lots of laughs, he’s literally served his country! While he isn’t particularly fond of the spotlight, he’s been married to his wife Tiffany Riggle for 18 years. She too prefers to be away from the limelight and prefers to enjoy her husband’s success with him while raising their two kids!\n\nBenjamin Bratt & Talisa Soto (Married)\n\nSo, most of us watch the show and know that Gloria was married, had Manny, but then found Jay…and clearly, a better life! But of course, any ex is bound to make an appearance! Playing Manny’s biological father is American actor Benjamin Bratt. Best known for his role as Rey Curtis on Law & Order, on the show he plays the very charismatic and very passionate Javier Delgado. But whilst he’s the “cool” and “exciting” dad, he’s just…flaky af!\n\nSure, he’s handsome…sure he’s a bit of a bad boy…and even Manny can’t resist enjoying his dad’s company. Oh and even Cameron has a little crush on Javier! Ayyy Papi! Whilst the cast, and fans around the world are also having a moment, there’s only one person who’s got his undivided attention; his gorgeous actor-model wife, Talisa Soto. Best known for her portrayal of Princess Kitana in Mortal Kombat as well as in Licence to Kill, the beauty has been married to Bratt for 17 years! The gorgeous couple have two teenagers; we’ll just have to wait and see if they follow in mom and dad’s footsteps!\n\nDavid Cross & Amber Tamblyn (Married)\n\nSo, this may be many moons ago, well, seasons ago…season three specifically, but we can’t get over David Cross’ cameo on the series! His appearance as councilman Duane Bailey; basically, the embodiment of annoyance. He goes head-to-head with Claire in her bid for town councilor; guaranteed laughs!\n\nSo, like we don’t want to say cradle snatcher...but…his wife is 20 years younger than him! In real life he’s married to American actress and writer Amber Tamblyn. The pair have been married since 2012, recently welcoming a baby girl into the world. Whilst some may judge for the serious age difference, y’all seem to be fine with Jay and Gloria’s marriage on the show!\n\nAndrea Anders & Matt LeBlanc (Dated)\n\nThere’s something about Andrea Anders that reminds us of Gladys Kravitz from Bewitched. Ah yes, it’s definitely the nosey part! Season six saw the introduction of Phil and Claire’s new neighbour. Her irritating snooping had viewers simply frustrated! Though thankfully, in real life, she’s certainly not as pesky! We bet you didn’t know that she was dating none other than Matt LeBlanc (yes, Joey!).\n\nAfter Matt split from his former wife in 2006, the pair began dating. However, LeBlanc is back on the market, after calling it quits with Andrea Anders after 8 years of being together.\n\nSarah Hyland & Dominic Sherwood (Dated)\n\nNaturally, a girl with Sarah Hyland’s looks would attract the attention of quite a list of suitors. So yes, she’s got a little line of ex-boyfriends who we’ve included on the list. Right now, of course, we know she’s dating the handsome Wells Adams of Bachelor fame – but this wasn’t always the case! Pre-Wells, she strolled the red carpet with tall drink of water Dominic Sherwood.\n\nHe’s known for his roles on Shadowhunters and Vampire Academy, and at the time, the pair were pretty much all over each other. However, all good things come to an end – much to the surprise of millions of fans – when in August 2017 they decided to call it quits. She seems to have moved on pretty quick to Adams, the Bachelor in Paradise star, so we wonder if he’ll face the same fate!?\n\nNolan Gould & Hannah Glasby (Rumored)\n\nSo, this next one we’re actually kinda freaking out – can you believe that the actor who plays Luke Dunphy is turning 21 this year!? Luke will forever be the kid brother that’s given the run-around by his older sisters. It seems that his best pal is Phil, and we literally mean that. Their relationship is so far from father-son, it’s more like best friends!\n\nPlayed by Nolan Gould, Luke’s the baby of the Dunphy family, and we love his innocent yet consistently truthful observations about people and his family. In real life however, he’s making his mark and becoming quite the young man. Now that Nolan’s all grown up, naturally he’d be dipping his toes in the dating pool. Rumors are swirling that Nolan is now dating Aussie model, Hannah Glasby. The paps spied the pair looking rather loved up at a local farmer’s market. Naw, young love!\n\nChris Geere & Jennifer Sawdon (Married)\n\nChris Geere is a new face on the Modern Family block, and has been rather well received by fans. He’s got a doubled role on the show, as Alex’s college professor, Dr. Arvin Fennerman, and now Haley’s latest boyfriend! We love the episode when he first appears, “In Your Head”, when Haley tries to sneak into Alex’s class, which ends in her disrupting the whole class! After class, he finds Haley and quite coolly tells her that they’re going to get married one day.\n\nHey, who knows? Maybe this self-fulfilling prophecy will end in marriage!? While he’s hanging around the college yard on the show, in real life he’s happily married to musical artist Jennifer Sawdon. The pair have a six-year-old son, Freddie, and are living blissfully. We, like other fans, will be hanging for Dr. Fennerman screen time!\n\nPhilip Baker Hall & Holly Wolfe (Dating)\n\nThe next actor on our list is a bit of a legend. Actor and comedian Philip Baker Hall is best known for his roles in Secret Honor, Hard Eight and Duck. Again, only a short role for Baker Hall, but a welcome one! He portrayed Walt Kleezak, playing the stereotypical grumpy old man, who was neighbor to the Dunphy family! Bit of a Grinch really. But the one person he did like was Luke Dunphy! And how could anyone dislike a kid like him?\n\nIn real life, Philip has been married twice. He tied the knot with his second wife, Holly Wolfle in 1988, and the pair have been together ever since. The now 87-year-old has two daughters with Wolfle, Anna and Adella. What beautiful names! And we wish nothing but good health to Baker Hall. A true golden oldie.\n\nKevin Hart & Eniko Parrish (Married)\n\nYou can’t really help but laugh pre-emptively when you see Kevin Hart on the screen. You just know something good is about to happen! Like our other celebs that have appeared on Modern Family, Hart’s stint on the show is, fittingly, as Phil’s neighbour and friend, Andre. He only appears in three episodes, but he’s certainly extremely memorable.\n\nFor the first time in our list, however, it seems that Hart’s character’s marital woes do somewhat mirror his real life relationship. He admitted to cheating on his wife of two years, Eniko Parrish. However, it seems that the bad blood’s been drawn out, with the pair welcoming their first child, Kenzo Kash Hart into the world. We hope things only go up from here for the couple!\n\nChazz Palminteri & Gianna Ranaudo (Married)\n\nAs you go through life, friends may come and go, but some just stick. Such is the case with the ongoing bromance between Jay Pritchett and his best friend, Shorty. They banter and bicker in equal amounts, but we know at the end of the day there’s nothing but love between them. Played by American actor, film producer and screenwriter Calogero Lorenzo “Chazz” Palminteri (what a mouthful right?!), Shorty has stood by Jay for many years.\n\nChazz not only enjoys acting but is a man of great faith. It’s no wonder that he met his current wife Gianna Ranaudo during a church service. Is it too far for us to stretch it and say it was an act…of...God? The pair have been married since 1992, and now are living the life in New York with two beautiful kids.\n\nAndrew Daly & Carri Levinson (Married)\n\nMajor throwback time. Back in ’09 on the show, when Haley and Alex were still in high school, you may remember an episode where the pair were in a little trouble with the Principal! Playing Principal Brown was Andrew Daly, disciplining the pair for cheating on their school tests!\n\nIn his personal world, Daly is an actor, comedian and writer, known for his role as Forrest MacNeil on Comedy Central series Review, as well as Mad TV and Eastbound & Down. He’s married to actress Carri Levinson, since 2004. 15 years later, the pair have found success and are now living in Los Angeles with their two daughters.\n\nJennifer Tilly & Phil Laak (Dating)\n\nSo, we all know Shorty, Jay’s BFF. But we’re throwing it back to season three, when we were introduced to his eclectic and bubbly girlfriend, Darlene. In real life, Jennifer Tilly is an actress, poker player and writer. She’s also been nominated for an Academy Award, AND she’s won a World Series of Poker Ladies’ Event bracelet.\n\nIt’s no surprise then that she met her boyfriend Phil Laak on the poker circuit. Both being professional poker players, it was this change in career which led her to meet Irish player Phil at an event. We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again; and the rest is history!\n\nStephanie Beatriz & Brad Hoss (Married)\n\nYou probably know Stephanie Beatriz as the tough, leather-jacket wearing bad-ass on sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine, but once upon a time she made an appearance on Modern Family as Gloria’s sister! You may also remember that it was SHE who was in fact supposed to marry Jay initially! Sure, on the show she’s not exactly portrayed as the most bubbly, fun person to be around, but it’s definitely the opposite in real life!\n\nActor boyfriend Brad Hoss knew she was the one and popped the question in October 2017. The pair got married in secret, in 2018. We wish them all the best!\n\nLeslie Mann & Judd Apatow (Married)\n\nWhat we love about these celebrity cameos is that they may be small, but they certainly add a bit of pizzazz! In a hilariously funny twist, Cameron tried to prove that he still had the wit and charm to make a woman fall for him! Enter Leslie Mann. Are you surprised that it worked? We’re not! Cam’s still got it, ladies and gents!\n\nIn the real world, we’re sure she’s swatting away men, but she’s only got her eyes for one man; Judd Apatow. An American TV producer, writer, director, actor and stand-up comedian, he’s even founded his own production company! The pair have been married for almost 22 years and have two beautiful girls.\n\nJames Marsden & Edei (Dating)\n\nOkay, we’re fangirling. Again. But with a smile like James Marsden’s, it’s impossible not to fall in love. He’s popped up here and there and has made quite the name for himself; you would’ve seen him most recently starring in the futuristic-western drama series, Westworld. On Modern Family however, he certainly has a more light-hearted role; possibly you’ve forgotten his not-so-grand entrance when he attempted to sleep in Mitch and Cam’s backyard…in a princess castle…\n\nMarsden was married to Lisa Linde for 11 years, with whom he has three children. The pair, however, decided to split up. Since then, he found British singer Edei, whom he has been dating for two years. The pair aren’t shy of sharing their personal life on social media, however, they do their best to not appear too frequently in the spotlight!\n\nJudy Greer & Dean E. Johnson (Married)\n\nWhen it comes to Claire Dunphy, being the mother hen…you notice that as a mom, she’s got that mysterious mother’s intuition. Is she ever wrong!? As per usual, Claire smelt a rat when Denise came into the picture. Her gut feeling was proven right when it became apparent that Judy Greer’s character was sneaking around, and her messaging Phil on social media wasn’t exactly innocent. What a homewrecker! But most certainly not on Claire’s watch!\n\nWhile she, like many other actors who've had brief stints on the show, Judy has created quite the career for herself; you probably recognize her face from The Wedding Planner, The Descendants, Love happens, 13 Going on 30, 27 Dresses and Love and Other Drugs. While she was clearly willing to be unfaithful in the episode, with her real-life husband, TV producer Dean E. Johnsen, things are of course the total opposite! The pair married in 2011 following a blind date. Funnily enough, the couple have been in the media recently due to the fact that they are finally moving in together! Only took them 7 years!\n\nMatt Dillon & Roberta Mastromichele (Dating)\n\nWe may have seen how Gloria’s ex stirred up a little trouble earlier on our list, and it seems the wrath of the exes continues. Enter Robbie Sullivan, portrayed by Matt Dillon. Robbie was Claire Dunphy’s high school boyfriend, but there was a twist; he had some fantasies about Claire’s mommy dearest, Dede. The plot thickens when Claire finds out that Robbie and Dede were actually romantically involved! This sounds exactly like that song…oh yes…Stacey’s Mom, has got it going on…she’s all I want and I’ve waited for sooo long…STACEY CAN’T YOU – okay, we’re done. We promise.\n\nThough Robbie didn’t quite get the girl he came for on Modern Family – or did he? In real life, he’s snagged himself a beautiful Italian actress. The pair have been dating since 2014, however, have kept their relationship under a veil of secrecy.\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda & Vanessa Nadal (Married)\n\nTony Award winner Lin-Manuel Miranda is one of the biggest names in show business, known for his musical mastery and acting genius. Most famous for penning and starring in The Heights, which was a Broadway hit, he is known for his creativity and flair. While he only appeared on Modern Family very briefly in 2011, he adds a little salsa to the episode, being in the middle of Jay and Gloria, trying to pitch a new idea for Jay to invest in! Even more interestingly, the episode was directed by Wonder Years star-turned-director, Fred Savage.\n\nIf we look at his personal life, Lin-Manuel is certainly far from the somewhat annoying Guillermo! He is married to a woman with beauty AND brains; she’s a lawyer and a scientist! The pair actually went to high school together but didn’t actually “meet” until 2005, when Miranda found her on Facebook. They reconnected, and the rest is history! The cutie even has her initials tattooed on his finger. Swoooon!\n\nMatthew Broderick & Sarah Jessica Parker (Married)\n\nWhile he may have had a small role on the show, he’s still part of the show’s legacy! Sorry but, how are we EVER going to forget THE kiss!? On Modern Family he appeared in the episode “Mistery Date” as Dave, Cam’s gay friend who gets close to Phil. Literally. While he was an absolute riot in that episode, let’s get to his extensive active chops! Who can forget his breakthrough role in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off? Absolutely iconic.\n\nYou probably already knew too, that he’s married to Carrie Bradshaw – oh, sorry, Sarah Jessica Parker! Sometimes actors really can’t be separated from the celebrated characters that they play! Oops! The pair have been married since 1997 and we think SJP puts it beautifully, “call me crazy, but I love him. We can only be in the marriage we are. We’re very devoted to our family and our lives. I love our life. I love that he’s the father of my children, and it’s because of him that there’s this whole other world that I love.” Goals.\n\nGreg Kinnear & Helen Labdon (Married)\n\nWhen you look at Claire Dunphy, it’s clear that Phil got super lucky. She’s not only completely gorgeous, but she’s got a head on her shoulders and can run a family like no one else! And it’s clear that Phil isn’t the only man in the Modern Family world that has good taste! Greg Kinnear’s role as the opportunistic Tad provides a humorous, yet slightly awkward encounter with Phil.\n\nWe don’t blame Phil for appearing totally aloof; that’s just, well, Phil! While Tad may persistently be making goo-goo eyes at Claire, we know she’d never stray from her adorable husband! Goofy, but lovable. In real life, Kinnear is married to British former-model, Helen Labdon. Kinnear first cast his eyes upon the blonde bombshell on the set of a movie, in 1994. The pair married in 1999 and have been happily together since. Isn’t it scary to think that 1999 was 20 years ago?!\n\nAriel Winter & Levi Meaden (Dated)\n\nOkay. She’s got the giant dorky glasses that she has to keep pushing back up on her nose, and an intellect to match…clearly, we’re talking about Alex Dunphy. A modern-day Hermione Granger, Alex got double the intelligence…if only it’d been shared with her older sis! Not only is she hugely knowledgeable...she is VERY competitive. It seems to come with the territory! But while she plays the geek so well, it seems she is the polar opposite in real life!\n\nThe LA socialite is not only very present on basically every social platform, she is also all about living her life her way. Sorry Ma! She’s frequently in the media about her latest skimpy wardrobe choice or the fact that her boyfriend is 11 years her senior. On the show she may be weak at the knees for geeky college boys, but it seems she’s only got eyes for Levi Meaden in real life. Best known for his roles on sci-fi show Aftermath and the Pacific Rim sequel, he’s trying his hand at landing work on the big screen! The pair have been inseparable since November 2016, parading a very public love life – on social media, or on the streets! Sadly they decided to go to separate ways in 2019."
