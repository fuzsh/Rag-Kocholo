        "text": "Though we love the characters they play, we admire the actors themselves. We can’t help but be curious about what they got involved with after a beloved project of theirs ended, especially when it comes to a popular movie or show. And there’s no better cast to look into than that of Modern Family.\n\nHere at Bright Side, we enjoy seeing cast members together, even after so many years, so we hope this compilation will fill your heart up with love as it did ours.\n\n1. Sarah Hyland\n\n20TH CENTURY FOX TV / Album / EAST NEWS, Invision / Invision / East News\n\nThe hilarious Haley Dunphy played by Sarah Hyland was definitely one of the most loved characters among theModern Family cast. For 11 seasons, she gave us her all, and apparently, Hyland did not stop there!\n\nShe’s now the host of the US version of Love Island. Aside from her career, Hyland just got married to her life-long partner, Wells Adams, on August 20 of this year. Some of the cast was there too!\n\n2. Ty Burrell\n\nNo list of Modern Family would be complete without Phil Dunphy. Played by Ty Burrell, the lovable and silly Dunphy dad ranked first among the cast, and no wonder!\n\nEven when he was on the show, Burrell dabbled in voice acting, and some of his roles include Captain Marvel in The Super Hero Squad Show, Parker in The Penguins of Madagascar, and Bailey the beluga whale in Finding Dory. After the show’s finale, Burrell took on yet another role, this time in Duncanville, Amy Poehler’s animated sitcom.\n\n3. Sofia Vergara\n\n20TH CENTURY FOX TV / Album / EAST NEWS, © sofiavergara / Instagram\n\nSofia Vergara lit up our screens for the whole duration of the show as the hilarious Gloria Pritchett, Jay’s wife. However, Sofia didn’t stray away from comedy in later years, staying true to her roots.\n\nAfter the end of Modern Family, Vergara took up a role in an animated comedy film, Koati, where she played a wicked snake named Zaina. Aside from starring in the film, she was also the executive producer. Vergara is also a judge on America’s Got Talent.\n\n4. Julie Bowen\n\nShooting Star / Sipa USA / East News, Jordan Strauss / Invision / AP / East News\n\nThe Dunphy mom, Claire Dunphy, played by Julie Bowen, embodied the sometimes-struggling mom of 3. It seems like a lot of the actors that acted in Modern Family chose to stick with comedy even after the show ended, and true to form, Bowen went on to do the same.\n\nThrough her own production company, Bowen & Sons, the actress is set to executive produce a comedic film that she will be starring in. Bowen & Sons will collaborate with Universal Television for this comedy.\n\n5. Eric Stonestreet\n\nShooting Star / Sipa USA / East News, PacificCoastNews / BWP Media / East News\n\nUnlike his colleagues, Eric Stonestreet, who played the lively Cameron Tucker on the show, wanted to move away from acting. After the show met its end, Stonestreet became part owner of the baseball team, Kansas City Royals. After this, he appeared as a guest star on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and as a judge on America’s Got Talent.\n\nIn his personal life, Stonestreet got engaged to his partner, Lindsay Schweitzer, announcing the engagement in a post on August 22 of last year.\n\n6. Nolan Gould\n\nShooting Star / Sipa USA / East News, Xavier Collin / Avalon / Photoshot / East News\n\nNolan Gould played the lovable and silly Luke Dunphy. Being up there with the memorable cast of Modern Family, we could say this was the role that truly ascended him into Hollywood.\n\nAfter his amazing performance on the sitcom, Gould landed a role in another comedy, The Nana Project. It seems that even after Modern Family ended, Gould is still the funny actor that we have come to love.\n\n7. Jesse Tyler Ferguson\n\nShooting Star / Sipa USA / East News, © jessetyler / Instagram\n\nJesse Tyler Ferguson played Mitchell Pritchett, Cameron Tucker’s partner. While we enjoyed seeing him on our screens, as fans, we wanted to see what he’s up to now. Ferguson has turned to cooking, releasing a cookbook as well as a food blog. Additionally, he once again showed his artistic side in a Broadway musical, Take Me Out. He is now married and has an amazing family. We couldn’t be happier for him!\n\nThe relationship between Mitchell and Cameron has really stuck with us, and we can’t help but want to see them together again. And, as it turns out, we’re not far off. The pair had a reunion back in March, putting a smile on all their fans’ faces.\n\n8. Ariel Winter\n\nShooting Star / Sipa USA / East News, Admedia, Inc / Sipa USA / East News\n\nPlaying the brainy member of the Dunphy family, Ariel Winter portrayed Alex Dunphy for all 11 seasons of the show. As of this year, Winter is set to take part in a TV series, Hungry. This is not the only gig she landed after her big role on Modern Family though. She also acted in a crime drama called Crimelands and a thriller, Don’t Log Off, to name a few. We can’t wait to see what else she has in store for us.\n\n9. Rico Rodriguez\n\n© starringrico / Instagram, Elizabeth Goodenough / Everett Collection / East News\n\nRico Rodriguez, who played Gloria’s son, Manny Delgado, has been quite positive after the show ended. Despite not landing any big roles after the show ended, he seems to be taking life as it comes, nothing more. He has been enjoying helping his friends with their projects, hanging out with his buddies and family, and reminiscing over the show that made him a household name.\n\n10. Ed O’Neill\n\nShooting Star / Sipa USA / East News, Invision / Invision / East News\n\nWe’ve known him since the popular show Married... with Children was on the air, and now we’ve come to enjoy his acting chops once again as Jay Pritchett on Modern Family. Ed O’Neill graced us with his presence in a great comedy role, however, his next big role involves a bit of drama and seriousness. The project is a TV mini-series called The Sterling Affairs, in which O’Neill will be playing an NBA owner.\n\n11. Aubrey Anderson-Emmons\n\n© Modern Family / 20th Century Fox Television and co-producers, Gilbert Flores / Broadimage / Broad Image / East News\n\nSimilarly to her fellow cast member Rico Rodriguez, Aubrey Anderson-Emmons, who played Lily Tucker-Pritchett on Modern Family, has been enjoying her teenage years after the show. Seeing how she was only 4 years old when she joined the cast, she practically grew up in front of us.\n\nLately, however, Anderson-Emmons has joined TikTok and YouTube, posting videos of her and her mother and generally enjoying having an online presence.\n\nDid you watch Modern Family? Which character was your favorite and why?"
