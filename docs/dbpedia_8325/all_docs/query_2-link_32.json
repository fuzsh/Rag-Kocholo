        "text": "Hilary Duff and the cast of Lizzie McGuire reunited for a virtual table read of the iconic \"bra episode\" and it was beyond perfect.\n\nIn a 44-minute Instagram video posted on May 11, Duff was joined by Jake Thomas (Matt McGuire), Hallie Todd (Jo McGuire), Robert Carradine (Sam McGuire), Adam Lamberg (Gordo), Lalaine (Miranda), Davida Williams (Claire), Ashlie Brillault (Kate) and Kyle Downs (who played Larry Tudgeman, but was reading David Carradine's lines) for a reading of one of the Disney Channel hit's most talked-about episodes, which happened to air on May 11, 2001.\n\nThe group even attempted to sing the theme song for fans, which didn't exactly go as planned.\n\nLindsay Lohan, Dennis Quaid, Elaine Hendrix and more stars of The Parent Trap have virtually reunited in honor of the beloved film's 22nd anniversary, proving it really was an everlasting love.\n\nThat's right, the Nancy Meyers-directed movie, a remake of the 1961 film, was released in theaters over 20 years ago in July 2020, so the cast came together in a 14-minute video hosted by Katie Couric on July 23.\n\nThe main stars, along with supporting standouts Lisa Ann Walter and Simon Kunz, shared their favorite memories from filming and also honored their late co-star, Natasha Richardson, who passed away in 2009.\n\nThis reunion special, in addition to delighting fans, was set up to help raise funds for José Andrés' World Central Kitchen.\n\nA sketch on All That might not quite be a Zoey 101 reboot, but if you ask the cast, it will hopefully lead to one.\n\nFor the second time, the cast of the Nickelodeon comedy reunited for an appearance on the kids sketch show, and it sounds like they'd be happy to keep coming together, especially if they were doing it in the form of a return to their original show. In fact, star Jamie Lynn Spears said there have definitely been talks, and it's \"the ultimate goal.\"\n\n\"I've had conversations, and we want to be able to tell everyone's story the best way we can, and finding the right home for it, I think that's the most important part right now,\" she spilled.\n\nE!'s Lilliana Vazquez chatted with Ross Lynch (Austin), Laura Marano (Ally), Calum Worthy (Dez) and Raini Rodriguez (Trish) in an epic reunion for the Disney Channel series that ran from 2011-2016.\n\nDuring the digital sit-down, the cast revealed their early memories of the show and what it was like filming it before the rise of Snapchat and TikTok.\n\nWhile Lynch admitted he was shocked when he landed one of the titular roles, his co-star assured The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina star that his fears were unwarranted.\n\n\"Ross, I'm not sure how you didn't know you got it, because at the end of the process there was one person for Austin, Ross, there was one person for Trish, Raini, and there were two girls for Ally. So, I actually had no idea if I got it or not,\" Marano revealed with a laugh during the chat.\n\nThey're all in this together!\n\nAlmost all of the stars of the iconic Disney Channel movie franchise reunited on Zoom in April, with one notable absence: Zac Efron was unable to participate. (Way to break our hearts, Troy Bolton!)\n\nBut Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Lucas Grabeel, Corbin Bleu and Monique Coleman, as well as HSM director Kenny Ortega, were all able to reminisce about their Wildcat days in the highly anticipated hangout.\n\nWho says you have to let it go?!\n\nGoonies never say die...or goodbye.\n\nIn a reunion put together by Frozen's Josh Gad, the stars of the classic '80s film came together for a virtual hangout in April.\n\nSean Astin, Corey Feldman, Jeff Cohen, Ke Huy Quan, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton and Josh Brolin all participated, though One-Eyed Willy was sadly unavailable.\n\n\"It's a great time to reassess what starts to surface as what's important and what's not so important,\" Brolin said during the virtual hangout, which went down over 35 years after the film's release. \"I'm so happy to see everybody I can't even tell you.\"\n\nWell, here's one day Ferris definitely didn't skip.\n\nAs part of his YouTube series \"Reunited Apart,\" Josh Gad reunited the stars of the iconic '80s film, including Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Jennifer Grey, Cindy Pickett, Lyman Ward and Ben Stein.\n\nDuring the hangout, Broderick recalled landing the part that made him a household name.\n\n\"John Hughes, who wrote it and directed it, I got a call from my agent that said he wanted me to be in a movie,\" he said. \"I was in a play at the time and everybody said he's the Steven Spielberg of teen movies…And then I rented Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles and loved them.\"\n\nTalk about some good news: During the first episode of his new YouTube show Some Good News (SNG)—a program dedicated entirely to, you guessed it, heartwarming news—John Krasinski virtually welcomed a very special guest: Steve Carell, his former The Office co-star.\n\nKrasinski and Carell, who played Jim Halpert and Michael Scott respectively on the iconic NBC sitcom, looked back on their favorite moments and shared behind-the-scenes details.\n\n\"Some of my most fond memories, personally or professionally, are entwined with that show,\" Carell shared.\n\nWeasley family forever!\n\nBonnie Wright and James and Oliver Phelps virtually reunited in July for the twins' podcast Double Trouble, staging a family get-together that surely delighted Harry Potter fans.\n\nThough it's been nearly 20 years since the cast met on the set of iconic film franchise, Wright and the boys recalled meeting their \"film family\" when they shot the King's Cross station scene in the first movie.\n\nWhile the rest of the Weasley family was unable to join for the virtual meeting, they had good reason! Ron Weasley, a.k.a. Rupert Grint, recently welcomed his first child with girlfriend Georgia Groom.\n\nDebby Ryan and other former stars of the Disney Channel hit series Jessie reunited on Zoom in April and they paid tribute to their late co-star Cameron Boyce, who died at age 20 in July 2019 after suffering an epileptic seizure.\n\nRyan, who played main character Jessie Prescott, remembered being comforted by Boyce when she was dealing with her mother Sandy's battle with breast cancer, which she did eventually beat.\n\n\"My mom was battling cancer and we weren't really vocal about it, so I would like go to chemo with her after work and then I would come back...sometimes people would be like, 'Tired, late night?' like making jokes, whatever and I would just be like kind of fragile but never shared about it,\" Ryan said during the show's Stars in the House repisode. \"[Boyce] had this sense, was aware, and I remember he would just pursue to come and give me hugs. I remember one time starting to cry and being like, 'You are like my younger brother.' He would have sort of like this maturity and this comforting- and it was like a two-way street for the first time in a really cool way. I just will never forget that.\"\n\nShonda Rhimes' fierce Gladiators assembled for the first time since the ABC hit series hung up its white hat in 2018.\n\nKerry Washington, Tony Goldwyn, Bellamy Young, Jeff Perry, Kate Burton, Dan Bucatinsky, Norm Lewis, Katie Lowes, Guillermo Diaz, Cornelius Smith, George Newbern and Joe Morton all came together as part of the Stars in the House series to benefit The Actors Fund. It was handled and the reunion provided Rudetsky with his biggest surprise from hosting almost 200 episodes.\n\n\"Kerry Washington ended the season by meeting her father. And she just said, 'Dad ,'and did it,\" he told E! News. \"They basically hadn't written the script for season three. So she said she had to record, like, six different line readings where they should be happy to see him, devastated to see him, depressed to see him, angry...it's so fun that like it's an old acting exercise.\"\n\nHow did John Krasinski follow-up his epic The Office reunion? On his next episode of Some Good News, he just casually reunited the entire original cast of Hamilton, one of the biggest Broadway hits ever. NBD!\n\nAfter learning that Aubrey, a 9-year-old superfan from Florida, had plans to see the hit Broadway play that were canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic, Lin-Manuel Miranda assembled Leslie Odom Jr., Anthony Ramos, and more cast members to perform the opening track \"Alexander Hamilton\" from the play for her via video chat.\n\nPlus, Krasinski's wife Emily Blunt joined in, as Aubrey is also a massive fan of Mary Poppins Returns, which Blunt and Miranda starred in together.\n\nAnd the episode ended with Krasinski gifting Aubrey and her mother with a trip to New York City to see Hamilton on Broadway once it's safe to do so.\n\nWith help from co-creator and ex-husband Peter Marc Jacobson, the beloved '90s series' star Fran Drescher managed to reunite the entire gang—including Renee Taylor, Nicholle Tom, Benjamin Salisbury, Madeline Zima and Rachel Chagall—for a virtual, pandemic performance of the sitcom's pilot episode.\n\nAvailable on YouTube, the table-read was put together, Drescher told E! News, because, \"We wanted to show our gratitude to their loyalty and give them something new to look forward to that makes you feel lighthearted. Laughter is the best medicine.\"\n\nAnyone else more than willing to say \"Bye bye bye\" to their Zoom happy hour to join this epic one? During a recent appearance on Watch What Happens Live, Lance Bass revealed the members of NSYNC have been keeping in touch while social distancing, even having virtual happy hours.\n\nBass and his former bandmates Justin Timberlake, Joe Fatone, JC Chasez and Chris Kirkpatrick have been getting together online after they all had done individual interviews for his podcast The Daily Popcast, which included reminiscing about their boy band days.\n\n\"I think the interviews really kind of even bonded us even more, especially during this quarantine,\" Bass explained. \"You know, your relationships, they get tighter so now we have happy hours every week together on Zoom, which is really fun.\""
