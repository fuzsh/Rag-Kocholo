        "text": "Who knew that Sarah Hyland could sing?\n\nNow that her collab with Boyce Avenue on a cover of The Chainsmokers and Halsey’s “Closer” has gone viral, many are left wondering why she kept her singing skills out of the spotlight for so long.\n\nHyland may be most recognizable from playing eldest sister Haley Dunphy on ABC’s Modern Family but she actually spent some time on another stage — Broadway.\n\nNaturally if you’re on Broadway, then you’re not too shabby in the singing department. So here’s a look back at her six greatest performances:\n\nOne of the earliest moments of her career found Hyland in the role of Molly for the 1999 TV movie adaption of Annie. While a lot of it is ensemble singing, there are a few moments where Hyland adorably takes over the screen during a rendition of “You’re Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile.”\n\nFast forward to her Modern Family days. While her singing is rare on the show, this clip from a 2013 episode entitled “The Late Show” features her character Haley singing Gladys Knight & The Pips’ “Midnight Train to Georgia,” with family members Luke (Nolan Gould) and Manny (Rico Rodriguez) in tow.\n\nIn 2013, Hyland took part in The Unauthorized Autobiography of Samantha Brown, which consists of songs written by musical theater team Kait Kerrigan and Bria Lowdermilk.\n\nHyland joined former Glee star turned Supergirl actress Melissa Benoist at a cabaret bar to perform songs such as “Freedom” and “Say The Word.”\n\nIn the video for “Say The Word,” Hyland shows off her range with a key change before the end of the song.\n\nReturning to the stage, Hyland played the role of Crissy in the musical Hair during its three-night stint at the Hollywood Bowl in 2014. In a video on YouTube, Hyland can be found singing “Frank Mills.”\n\nA few months later, Hyland took on the role of Sidney in The Unauthorized Musical Parody of Scream.\n\nIn the parody, Hyland belts out covers of songs like Bob Dylan’s “Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door,” No Doubt’s “Don’t Speak” and “(Don’t Fear) The Reaper by Blue Oyster Cult.\n\nHyland joins in at the 1:45 mark to belt out the classic rock tune from 1976.\n\nIn a video from 2015, Hyland joins another former Glee star, Jenna Ushkowitz, for their take on The Beatles‘ “Let It Be,” during a fundraiser for the Kindred Foundation for adoption. In the clip, she jokes around after messing up the lyrics at the 1:16 mark.\n\nAnd finally the video that started it all. In a cover with Boyce Avenue, Hyland harmonizes and sings Halsey’s parts from The Chainsmokers hit “Closer.”\n\nWith an already impressive resume, will a record deal be offered to the star? Only time will tell."
