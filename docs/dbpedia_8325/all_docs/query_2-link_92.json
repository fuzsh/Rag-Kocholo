        "text": "The Dunphy-Tucker-Pritchett clan is as tight as ever. Though the Emmy-winning sitcom Modern Family came to an end in 2020 after 11 years, the cast have remained close, and recently reunited at America's Got Talent Judge Sofia Vergara's house. It looks like they had a fantastic time, and the pictures are too cute. Warning: seeing the kids all grown up may make you feel old.\n\nThe Modern Family cast reunites at Sofia Vergara's home\n\nIn addition to the cast, co-creators Steven Levitan and Chris Lloyd were in attendance, or as Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who played Mitchell, called them, the \"two dads.\" His pictures also revealed that Vergara keeps the snap of herself and Julie Bowen from Haley's (Sarah Hyland) photography show in a place of honor.\n\nScroll to the second slide on this post to see the Dunphy sisters drinking wine together. It's truly too cute.\n\nThis full-fam reunion comes just weeks after Vergara hosted Ferguson and Julie Bowen, who played Type A mom Claire, for a get-together in...her closet. In fairness, Vergara's closet is as spacious as a studio apartment. In their respective Instagram Stories, Stonestreet and Ferguson posted about \"working with\" one another, so perhaps a commercial is in the works?\n\nRELATED: Sofia Vergara Reunited with Her Modern Family Costars in the Most Unexpected Place\n\nSofia Vergara takes a photo with on-screen husband Ed O'neil\n\n\"I love u Ed O’nei[l]l❤️❤️❤️ #modernfamily,\" Vergara wrote alongside a picture of herself and her on-screen husband O'neil — who played patriarch Jay Pritchett — embracing on a couch. Vergara was nominated four times for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her portrayal of the loud, proud and hysterical Gloria.\n\n\"So lucky to have worked with this people for 11 years❤️. I love and miss u all guys!!! #modernfamily\" Vergara wrote in another post, showing off her delicious-looking spread of snacks.\n\nWhy Ty Burrell wasn't at the reunion\n\n\"For 11 years we would take family pictures for Modern Family and without missing one ever, I would always say, ‘now let’s do one without Ty.’ Last night Ty couldn’t make it to our little impromptu reunion, so I had to bring his favorite picture of Phil so we could ‘do one without Ty,\" Eric Stonestreet, who played Cam, revealed in his Instagram post. Rest assured, concerned fans: Burrell is very much alive and kicking."
