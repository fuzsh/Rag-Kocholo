        "text": "This article is written by a student writer from the Spoon University at Lafayette chapter.\n\nThere’s no question about it: Modern Family is one of the most hilarious shows currently on television. Every Wednesday night, the extended Pritchett family brings us joy.\n\nYou know what else gives us lots of joy? Food. Duh. So, to pay tribute to our favorite dysfunctional family that we wish we were a part of, here’s a list of the foods that represent the characters of Modern Family.\n\nJay Pritchett: Steak Dinner\n\nJay is a meat and potatoes kind of guy. But only the best steak will cut it. He’s traditional and, to an extent, stuck in his ways, but definitely reliable.\n\nGloria Delgado-Pritchett: Jalapeño Margarita\n\nGloria is undeniably spicy. And that jalapeño margarita… you want it so bad, but you don’t mess with it until you’re ready. Tequila with an added kick? It’ll knock you right out if you’re not careful, much like Gloria will.\n\nManny Delgado: Crème Brûlée\n\nManny is put-together and classy, much like crème brûlée. But beneath that beautifully caramelized, crunchy sugar coating is nothing but a soft, squishy interior that you can’t help but love. For a healthier, but more tart version, try a brûléed grapefruit for breakfast.\n\nClaire Dunphy: A Granola Bar\n\nBeing a working mom of three, Claire is always on the move. Grab-and-go is a way of life for Claire, and only a handy granola bar could keep up with that lifestyle, always at the ready.\n\nPhil Dunphy: Breakfast for Dinner\n\nPhil is the fun dad, always giving his kids what they want. Breakfast for dinner (brinner, if you will) is the same way. Everybody loves it, but at the end of the day, are pancakes drowned in maple syrup really the most responsible choice?\n\nHaley Dunphy: Pumpkin Spice Latte\n\nHaley is trendy, popular, and, like, kind of a big deal. Same thing with the PSL – everyone’s always talking about it and it thrives on all the attention. If you say you don’t love the pumpkin spice latte, though, you’re probably lying.\n\nAlex Dunphy: Kale Salad\n\nAlex is smart and responsible – almost a little too smart and responsible. And like Alex, sticking with a kale salad is a very wise decision. It might be a little hard to get through if you’re not the biggest fan, but at the end of the day, kale is a superfood that works really hard to keep you healthy and on the right track.\n\nLuke Dunphy: Popcorn Covered in Maple Syrup and Fruity Pebbles\n\nWait, what? Luke is all over the place and a little weird, kinda like this crunchy concoction of sugar and artificial flavors. There are probably better things to do with your popcorn, but at the end of the day, both Luke and this crazy combo are pretty sweet.\n\nMitchell Pritchett: Avocado\n\nMitchell is a no-nonsense kind of guy on the outside, but deep down, he doesn’t want to be the bad cop all the time. Avocados have a thick dark skin that you need to get through, but once you’re inside, it’s like a beautiful green heaven where guacamole is born. Or, it’s rotten. Depends on the day.\n\nCam Tucker: Lemon Meringue Pie\n\nCam is fruity, fun and a little (okay, a lot) over the top. Lemon meringue pie, like Cam, is quite the spectacle, with those fancy meringue peaks and neon yellow filling. And with so many different kinds, who doesn’t love pie?\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett: Sour Patch Kid\n\nBoth Lily and Sour Patch Kids are bite-sized but full of flavor. Lily does not hold back when she has something she wants to say, much like the candy’s initial sour punch. But once you get past that, she’s sweet, fun, and really, nothing but a kid who means well.\n\nOn a TV kick? Keep on binging with these articles:"
