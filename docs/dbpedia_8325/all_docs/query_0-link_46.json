        "text": "They grew up before American viewers’ eyes. After lengthy on-and off-negotiations, the original kids cast of ABC’s flagship comedy Modern Family, Sarah Hyland, Ariel Winter, Nolan Gould and Rico Rodriguez — now all adults — have been locked in for two more years by 20th Century Fox TV with new contracts that include salary increases.\n\nThe studio turned its attention to securing Hyland, Winter, Gould and Rodriguez after closing new two-year deals with stars Ed O’Neill, Julie Bowen, Ty Burrell, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Eric Stonestreet and Sofia Vergara in May that paved the way for a two-year Modern Family renewal by ABC.\n\nLike with their older co-stars, who secured salary increases of over 40%, from about $350,000 an episode in the most recent Season 8 to about $500,000 in Season 9, I hear the young actors scored significant pay increases that takes them over $100,000 an episode.\n\nThe re-ups for Hyland, Winter, Gould and Rodriguez keep the entire original cast of Modern Family, whose contracts were up after Season 8, intact for the upcoming ninth and tenth seasons of the Emmy-winning comedy series. Production on Season 9 is slated to begin in early August. Winter’s participation on the show is not expected to be affected by her going to college this fall. She has enrolled into UCLA, which is in town and close to the show’s Los Angeles sets.\n\nModern Family‘s current child cast members, Aubrey Anderson-Emmons, who plays Lily Tucker-Pritchett, and Jeremy Maguire, who portrays Joe Pritchett, joined the show later and have more time on their deals.\n\nRodriguez plays Gloria’s (Vergara) wise-beyond-his-years son Manny; Gould, plays the Dunphys’ dim-witted son Luke; Winter plays his book-smart sister Alex; and Hyland plays their street smart older sister Haley."
