        "text": "21 Times The \"Modern Family\" Cast Proved They're Really Still Family\n\nI'm obsessed with Sarah Hyland including Ty Burrell in her Father's Day tribute this year...\n\nIt's hard to believe that it's been over three years since Modern Family ended, but the cast is still so close with each other that they really did become a family offscreen as well. Pretty often, cast members will share pics of them hanging out together. For example, most recently, Jesse Tyler Ferguson went to support Aubrey Anderson-Emmons (who played Lily on the show) at her school play.\n\nSince it's just so feel-good to see them all hanging out together IRL, here are 19 pics that'll almost make it feel like the show never ended:\n\n1. When most of the family got together to celebrate Sarah Hyland and Wells Adams' wedding — and Jesse Tyler Ferguson even officiated the event:\n\n2. When Sarah posted a Father's Day tribute to all her dads — her father, her father-in-law, and Ty Burrell, of course:\n\n3. When Sarah, Jesse, and Nolan Gould reunited on the WGA picket line:\n\n4. When Sofía Vergara, who's a judge on America's Got Talent, was totally surprised by her onscreen son, Rico Rodriguez, for a mini-reunion:\n\n5. When Eric Stonestreet went to visit Jesse's home (and met his son Beckett for the first time):\n\n6. When Jesse's IRL fam enjoyed a little Modern Family picnic:\n\n7. When Sofía shared a picture of Jesse and Julie Bowen hanging out in her luxurious closet...\n\n8. ...and then shared this selfie along with Jesse's husband, Justin, that shows she has a framed version of that famous pic of her and Julie from the show:\n\n9. When Nolan and Jesse just ran into each other on the street and Jesse joked, \"Just like real family he didn’t call to tell me he was in town\":\n\n10. When Sarah shared a selfie of her and her \"little sister\" Ariel Winter:\n\n11. When much of the cast reunited for Modern Family creator Steve Levitan's wedding:\n\n12. When Jesse starred in Take Me Out on Broadway, his cast showed up to support him. Like his \"nephew\" Nolan:\n\n13. Ty Burrell, who snapped this shot backstage:\n\n14. Aubrey, which makes the whole school play visit even sweeter:\n\n15. Sarah and Wells, who caught it before its Broadway run:\n\n16. Julie, who was a proud sister:\n\n17. And, of course, Eric was in attendance as well:\n\n18. When Rico and Nolan spent July 4th together this year:\n\n19. When Jesse and Julie showed how much they're like siblings IRL:\n\n20. When Aubrey and Jesse had a \"father daughter date night\":\n\n21. And finally, just this adorable pic of Jesse and Eric:\n\nShare This Article"
