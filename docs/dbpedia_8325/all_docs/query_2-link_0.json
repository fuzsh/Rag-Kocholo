        "text": "American actress (born 1990)\n\nSarah Jane Hyland (born November 24, 1990) is an American actress. Born in Manhattan, she attended the Professional Performing Arts School before having minor roles in the films Private Parts (1997), Annie (1999) and Blind Date (2007). She is best known for playing Haley Dunphy in the ABC sitcom Modern Family (2009–2020), for which she received much acclaim, including four Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series and a nomination for the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.

Hyland was featured in an Olive Garden commercial along with actress Molly Culver. She also appeared on Broadway as the young Jacqueline Bouvier in Grey Gardens (2006).[10]\n\nFrom 2009 to 2020, Hyland played Haley Dunphy on the ABC sitcom Modern Family, for which she and the rest of the show's cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series each year from 2011 through 2014.[11][12][13][14]\n\nIn 2011, Hyland co-starred in the Disney Channel Original Movie Geek Charming.[15] In 2012, Hyland appeared in the film Struck by Lightning.[16][17] In September 2012, she was involved in a Nintendo 3DS ad campaign[18] along with Dianna Agron and Gabby Douglas.[19][20]\n\nAdditional musical projects and theatre productions Hyland has performed in are: Kerrigan-Lowdermilk Live (2013 concert), Hair (2014 adaptation at the Hollywood Bowl), The Unauthorized Musical Parody of Scream (2014 play at Rockwell Table & Stage) and The Kindred Foundation for Adoption created by Jenna Ushkowitz and Samantha Futerman (2015 fundraiser).[21][22][23]\n\nIn 2014 and 2018, Hyland was a co-host at the Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade (during Disney Parks Frozen Christmas Celebration and The Wonderful World of Disney: Magical Holiday Celebration), which included dancing and singing with Jordan Fisher.[24][25][26][27][28] Hyland also made a guest appearance during The Wonderful World of Disney: Disneyland 60 (2016) and Mickey's 90th Spectacular (2018).[29]\n\nIn 2016, Hyland covered songs with Boyce Avenue such as \"Closer\" by The Chainsmokers[30] and \"Don't Wanna Know\" by Maroon 5,[31] both included on the Boyce Avenue album Cover Sessions Vol. 4, which was released on December 19, 2017. \"Don't Wanna Know\" peaked at No. 62 on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 chart in December 2016.[32]\n\nIn 2019, Hyland partnered with Olay for a skin product campaign.[33][34]\n\nHyland sang her debut performance of \"Met At a Party\" with Jordan McGraw (son of Dr. Phil) at the 2019 Teen Choice Awards. The single was released on August 9, 2019, via Republic Records.[35][36][37]\n\nIn December 2020, Hyland appeared in a Taco Bell commercial called \"The Craving\" with Joe Keery.[38][39]\n\nIn October 2021, she became the new creative director and co-founder of Sourse, a line of chocolate-infused vitamins (including \"Beauty Bites\" and \"Mood Bites\").[40][41][42]\n\nIn August 2022, Hyland began hosting Love Island USA on Peacock.[1] In August 2022, she appeared on America's Got Talent (alongside Sofía Vergara) during the first live Qualifier Results Show of season seventeen to assist season sixteen winner Dustin Tavella with his magic act.[43]\n\nHyland starred in Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin, which premiered in November 2022 on Peacock.[44]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nRelationships\n\n[edit]\n\nHyland dated her Geek Charming co-star Matt Prokop for four years after meeting in 2010.[45][46][47] In August 2014, Hyland obtained a domestic violence temporary restraining order against Prokop[48] for physically and verbally abusing her throughout the four years of their relationship.[49] In October of that same year, the restraining order became permanent.[50]\n\nHyland dated her Shadowhunters and Vampire Academy co-star Dominic Sherwood from 2015 until 2017.[51][52]\n\nIn 2017, Hyland began a relationship with Wells Adams, a radio personality and former contestant on The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise.[53] The couple became engaged in July 2019,[54] and, in May 2020, they purchased a home in Los Angeles,[55] a month before their planned wedding date. However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused them to postpone their wedding multiple times. An outdoor bridal shower in early June 2022 marked the end of their two-year delay,[56] and the couple was married at a California vineyard on August 20, 2022. Their wedding was attended by Hyland's Modern Family co-stars.[57][58][59]\n\nHealth\n\n[edit]\n\nHyland was diagnosed with kidney dysplasia as a child and received a kidney transplant from her father in April 2012. That kidney failed after a few years, leading to a second kidney transplant in September 2017, donated by her younger brother, Ian.[60] Hyland is on regular anti-rejection medicines and steroids to ensure that her body does not reject her donated kidney; consequently, Hyland has difficulty maintaining weight and muscle mass, and has been put on bed-rest several times, sometimes continuing to film Modern Family simultaneously.[61][62] Hyland has said that she does not recall shooting some episodes of Modern Family because she was so tired that she slept most of the time she was not shooting her scenes.[63]\n\nIn a December 2018 Self magazine article, Hyland said she had contemplated suicide because she felt she was a burden on her family and blamed herself for her body rejecting her father's kidney. Since birth, she has undergone 16 surgeries to improve her health, including numerous kidney surgeries and a laparoscopic surgery to treat her endometriosis.[60]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1997 A Tall Winter's Tale Elizabeth Private Parts Howard's daughter 1998 The Object of My Affection Molly Advice from a Caterpillar Lizbeth 1999 Cradle Will Rock Silvano – Giovanna 2002 The Empath Young Christine 2004 Spanglish Sleepover friend 2007 Blind Date Child Voice 2010 Monster Heroes Delilah Cougars, Inc.
