        "text": "I booked Modern Family in February 2009 after the show I was on, Lipstick Jungle, had gotten canceled. A few months prior, I'd decided to move to L.A., but my mom said, ‘No, you're not. You don’t even have a driver's license.’ I was determined, though. I was always told that the reason I didn’t book roles in L.A. every pilot season was because I wasn’t a local hire. So in the span of a couple months, I learned how to drive, got my driver's license, and moved to California.\n\nWhen I first read the script for Modern Family, I remember thinking, Oh, this is a lot like The Office and I love The Office. As for Haley, I thought she was funny, but I didn’t relate to her a lot. I don’t know how she goes about life because I’m more like Claire. I think the only time I ever really connected with Haley was the episode where she's not good at cooking.\n\nIt was so interesting when people would meet me in person, because they had this idea of how I was supposed to be. A lot of times I would hear, “You're so much smaller in person!” Or, “You’re smarter than she is. You can carry a conversation.” People forget you’re not like your character. Maybe it’s because I made the character choice of wearing padded and push-up bras at all times, but that shouldn’t have an impact on what someone views as intelligence. Haley's the first time I've ever played the hot girl, so, right or wrong, I was like, if Haley's going to be the hot chick, we’ve got to get her some boobs to make me feel sexy.\n\nWhen I signed on for the pilot, though, I never could have predicted we’d be on the air for 11 years. You just hope you get picked up by the network to go to series, let alone become a huge success. I was even staying at a friend's house because I didn't have my own place yet.\n\nLooking back, I love the early days on the show. Everyone was so little! It's fun to watch. My eyebrows were very thin and villainous. I don't know what was going on there. I know I've changed a lot, but I also feel like I've changed the least compared with my costars. The seasons that are the hardest to watch are four and five because I was recovering from my kidney transplant, and I didn't know how to treat my body while on prednisone. I was bloated, my hair was falling out, and I hated the way I looked. I hope one day I can watch those episodes and be empowered by the fact that I got through some really tough times.\n\nAt the start of season nine, in August 2017, we filmed the Lake Tahoe episode. I’ll always remember that because it was the start of things for me and my fiancé, Wells. We were texting a lot then. It’s that specific time where I can look back and be like, “Oh, that’s when our relationship was starting.”\n\nThe episode where Haley got into college also means a lot to me because Bryan Cranston directed that episode and gave me some really lovely compliments. You never forget that.\n\nThe show is a male-dominant cast, really, so the female relationships have meant so much to me. It’s been amazing to have Julie Bowen and Sofia Vergara to look up to as role models because they're so funny, smart, talented, and kind. It's also been amazing to see Ariel Winter turn into a beautiful, strong, opinionated, smart woman as well. Aubrey Anderson-Emmons too.\n\nJulie has been like a mother to me over the past 11 years. She is one of the strongest, smartest, most opinionated women I've ever met. But she is smart about being opinionated. There's a time and a place for things, and I'm still learning how to master that because I have no filter. She’s taught me how to keep, at times, my mouth shut. Watching her in interviews, in work settings—really just in life—her brain is the most fascinating thing to me.\n\nSofia taught me how to overdraw my lips with liner. It works! You get a good nude lip liner, like Pillow Talk by Charlotte Tilbury, and Chapstick over it. It looks so natural. Ariel has taught me a lot of lingo and what the hip new thing is to say, so I rely on her to keep me young. Now that I don't see her every week, I'm turning into my mother. It's already happened.\n\nModern Family was my first comedy—the first sitcom I'd ever done. I had been in the industry 14 years, and all I ever did was crime or dramatic shows, whether it was about murdering someone or being too ugly to lose my virginity. I didn't do a lot of funny things. It was all very, very serious dramatic work. So I'm proud of myself for taking the time to study these amazing actors I've had the privilege to work with over the past 11 years. I've always said the best acting class is experience and observation, and I've been so lucky and blessed to have had the best teachers in the comedy world. I'm grateful for the show because it opened so many doors for me.\n\nSince I was four years old, my entire life has been surrounded by work. That's all I ever wanted to focus on. So while I can’t wait to act and produce some more, right now my life is about staying safe, staying home, staying healthy, staying creative, and learning new things. Maybe I’ll relearn French. I took five years of that language and still had trouble when we went to Paris this year for the show. I’m also looking forward to learning how to ride a bike—but, of course, if I want to stay healthy and not get hurt, maybe I wait until this pandemic is over.\n\nI’m just so grateful for the last 11 years. Leading up to the finale, I was in denial and started to feel guilty that I wasn’t getting sad like everyone else. But then, during the taping of the last episode, I saw Ty Burrell with tears in his eyes. There's something about seeing your dad cry that makes you want to cry. I started bawling, which actually made me feel really happy. I was like, I'm not an ice queen! In the end, all of us—me, Ty, Julie, Ariel, Nolan—were in each other's arms and sobbing. It was really amazing and cathartic to be able to have that with everyone.\n\nThe series finale of Modern Family airs Wednesday, April 8, on ABC.\n\nJessica Radloff is the Glamour West Coast editor.
