        "text": "Spoiler alert! This story contains details from \"Modern Family\" Season 11, Episode 11, \"Legacy,\" which aired Jan. 15.\n\nIf you weren't expecting that death on Wednesday's \"Modern Family,\" you're not alone – Sarah Hyland was just as surprised as fans were.\n\nThe actress, who plays Haley Dunphy on the show, took to Instagram that night to share her reaction to \"Legacy.\" Because her character wasn't in the episode, Hyland says she didn't know what was coming until it aired.\n\nThe shocker? Her character's grandfather Frank, played by Fred Willard, dies.\n\n\"So I don't read scripts of episodes of 'Modern Family' that I'm not in,\" she said. \"So I just found out that my grandpa's dead along with all of you.\"\n\nShe added jokingly: \"I still feel special.\"\n\nSome fans must not have been too happy with Hyland dropping the plot point with no warning, as she returned to her story later that night to apologize for not offering a \"spoiler alert.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, I guess I should have put a spoiler alert for grandpa Frank dying, but I was just caught off guard,\" she said. \"Like, as his granddaughter, you'd think I'd be invited to the funeral?\"\n\nFor fans still upset, however, Hyland said she got her comeuppance for the spoiler.\n\n\"If it's any consolation to those who are angry about the spoiler alert, karma hit real fast and Boo (my dog) just farted in my face and then had to get off the bed because the smell was so bad,\" she said.\n\nThis isn't the first time a \"Modern Family\" character unexpectedly disappeared.\n\nRecurring character and family matriarch DeDe Pritchett (Shelley Long) – mom to Claire Dunphy (Julie Bowen) and Mitchell Pritchett (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and ex-wife of Jay (Ed O'Neill) – died in Season 10's Halloween episode, \"Good Grief.\"\n\n'Modern Family' killed off this surprising character on Wednesday's episode\n\nThe news of the death came at the beginning of the episode, with the shock that DeDe had died in her sleep of a heart problem.\n\n“She's directly involved with three of our characters and she touched everybody's life in some interesting way,” co-creator Steve Levitan said to The Hollywood Reporter of the decision to kill DeDe. “It seemed like the right character to put everybody through something. She seemed like the right character because she so directly affects so many of our characters.”\n\nSarah Hyland tells troll: I'll be engaged 'forever' to Wells Adams\n\nContributing: Anika Reed"
