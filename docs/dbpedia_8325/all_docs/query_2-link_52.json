        "text": "Here’s to the end of my blog as we know it.\n\nAs this will be my last blog post of the semester I wanted to finish out with one last post about what I’ve taken away from the blog and what Modern Family still has to offer in the future…I have to say that I really have enjoyed doing research on Modern Family, sharing what I’ve learned, and learning new things myself. I was a fan of the show before I started the blog, but now I’m definitely into it even more so. After learning so much about the background and details behind it all, the writers, what it takes to make an episode, the cast, and random fun facts. It makes me really love it. I’m a huge fan of the quirky humor, cleverness involved with the show, how the writers go about doing their writing, and how incredibly down-to-earth, different, and humorous the cast is. So much of what I’ve found out about the show I had never known before writing this blog and now I think I have a newfound admiration for what it takes to produce the incredibly successful sitcom. It’s been fun.\n\nNow that the blog is over…don’t stop watching Modern Family! The highly anticipated Modern Family Down Under special is premiering April 23! From the sneak-peaks I’ve seen I can tell the mega-sitcom’s vacation special is gonna be a great one. In a clip provided in an article written about the episode on smh.com.au, some of the plot is revealed. Apparently, Phil suffers a severe allergic reaction to Vegemite. Sounds funny to me. In the clip provided, Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell) shouts “Whaddya say, mates?”, with the famous Sydney Opera House in the background. Before the clip cuts, we see him in the bush getting punched by a kangaroo as a very terrified Gloria (Sofia Vergara) watches. To read more on the episode and watch the clip yourself, check this out:\n\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/modern-family-reveals-first-look-at-australian-episode-20140416-36qyy.html#ixzz2z40BWFgZ\n\nYou can also watch this awesome behind the scenes video of the cast and view filming in Australia, from Studio 10:\n\nTune in on 4/23/14! 9PM EST.!\n\nHaley Dunphy, played by Sarah Hyland, is he daughter of Claire and Phil, sister of Alexa and Luke. At the start of the series, Haley is 15 years old and a high school sophomore. Now, in Season 5, she technically would have been a sophomore in college but was expelled and now living back at home. Throughout the entirety of the show, Haley is portrayed as a stereotypical teenager. She’s also seen as a major flirt, and a little naive. She focuses more on boys, less on her schoolwork, and spends more time fighting her parents on everything they say than she does most other things. Though, at times, her wit is surprising.\n\nIt’s always a joke that Haley is growing up too fast. She’s incredibly independent, but still so oblivious to so much about life. According to her character bio on ABC.go.com, “she once rubbed a cell phone on her head for an hour because her sister, Alex, told her it would recharge the battery”. As many young teenage girls, she is also embarrassed by her dad and constantly arguing with her mom. This is especially apparent when he attempts to become friends with her boyfriend, Dylan. On top of it all, she’s obsessed with her popularity at school, her sexual life, as well as her social one. Haley has also never been the world’s greatest student. All of her application to college had been rejected until she received one final letter to open. The entire family gathered around as she opened it, hoping she’d be accepted, only to learn that she was wait listed. Turns out, her younger brother Luke was hiding the actual acceptance letter. But, it was definitely a challenge finding a college that would accept her nonetheless. In today’s episodes, Haley’s focus is on learning business and photography at a community college, as she has her photos shown and sold in an exhibit.\n\nI think the best part about Haley’s character is that she is played by someone who is 3/4 years older than the actual character. At the start of the series, Sarah Hyland was 18 years old, playing a 15 year old. When casting for Modern Family, they refused to even see her because they heard that she was 18, and they thought an 18 year old was too old to play a 15 year old. But, her agent insisted that they need to look at her head shots. Once they did, they understood. And, now here we are today!…Here’s a clip of Sarah, at age 20 (in 2011), talking about her role on Modern Family, joking about how young she really looks, on the Ellen Show:\n\n“I do, I look 12, it’s okay.”\n\nModern Family is a very unique 30 minute sitcom in regard to both its comedy and its structure. For the most part, each episode will go as follows:\n\nAct I – Commercial Break – Act II – Commercial Break – Act III – Commercial Break – Tag\n\nEach episode seems to open with a “Cold Open”, but after reading an actual Modern Family script, this is considered Act I. The Tag is essentially just the closing of the episode, a joke, which is included in nearly all sitcoms on television.\n\nAct I – The premise of the episode is established and the conflict involved within the A, B, and C stories is introduced.\n\nAct II – Plot twists and attempts to fix the conflicts are brought up. Sometimes, one twist will arise sending the entire storyline into a different direction. Which, in turn, will cause a new problem to be solved.\n\nAct III – A final solution leads to the resolution of the previous problem(s) and most of the time a minor truth is revealed about the characters involved. (That minor truth part is really important for Modern Family. If your script doesn’t reveal any truths, then you might want to go back to the outline stage.)\n\nTag – A quick joke that normally makes a reference to a scene or situation from the episode.\n\nWith that, there’s usually 3 stories included in each episode. An A story, B story, and a C story. At times, there may be a 4th story, or only 2 big stories, depending. As a whole, Modern Family tends to put together three stories of equal importance or weight (usually).\n\nIn an article written for StoryLink.com, executive producer and co-creator of the show, Christopher Lloyd discusses Modern Family and its structure. He mentions,\n\n“the story breaking process is both the same and different on Modern Family than it is on other shows of which I’ve been a part. The same: stories need a good mix of humor and heart, and until we’ve got a good ending (the hardest part always), we never sign off on a story. It’s an axiom of ours that ten good beginnings are worth one good ending. The different: when we’re telling three parallel stories they need to be a bit more compact than what you’d normally do on a television show, and the three should vary in tone (if one is a bit broad, another might be a bit more emotional). Also, the three should have some link – either a thematic one, or a story turn that brings the families together at some point during the episode.”\n\nBecause the character dynamics and strengths of the jokes and situations, the show seems to have the ability to fit to whatever story structure you are really interested in using. You could go ahead using the usual A-B-C stories, with each story line becoming progressively smaller than the one before. You could have a story with three parallel, but equally strong stories. Or, you could do something in between. Personally, I like the idea of writing three stories that are each fairly equal in importance, all linked by some overall theme and connection.\n\nI’ve noticed:\n\nThe A story tends to take up 6 of the 16 story beats\n\nThe B story tends to take up 7 of the 16 story beats\n\nThe C story only takes up 3 of the 16 story beats.\n\nIn most sitcoms, the C story is usually viewed as a the gag, the throwaway joke, filled with nothing meaningful. But, on Modern Family, the C story actually has some depth and significance in the episode. There’s usually some sort of metaphor or connection involved, necessary to complete the story and the joke of the episode.\n\nYou can check out the real Modern Family screenplay for the pilot of the show here!\n\nBesides her beautiful face, Sofia Vergera is also known for her (difficult to understand) Colombian accent. The media, and friends of the successful actress, are all huge fans of poking fun at the star’s way of speaking. And, it’s gotten to the point now that some believe, and question whether or not, she’s actually faking it. In 2012, Vergera’s son, Manolo Gonzalez Vergara, started a YouTube channel, in which he began to reveal his mother’s secrets. Or joke about them. Vergara assisted her son in spoofing the on-going rumor that her accented isn’t real, attempting to (and clearly kidding) prove that she is actually British. Not true. Though, the video is telling of her sense of humor. Which she has clearly passed down to her son.\n\nAs she is good friends with, and a fellow Cover Girl alongside, Ellen Degenerous, Ellen loves to joke about Sofia. She is constantly impersonating her and poking fun at her. Vergera is always a good sport, able to make fun of herself, and go along with it all. In an interview on the Ellen Show, in 2010, Sofia mentions,\n\n“I’ve been here for 16 years but I can’t get rid of my accent. Sometimes I talk and even I don’t understand what I said! I wait to see if the person understood, because I didn’t understand. I just move on anyway.”\n\nEllen thought it would be funny to see how other people react to Sofia’s accent, so she asked her to take part in a hidden camera trick. Classic Ellen move. With an earpiece on, the game-for-a-laugh actress went to a video store near the show’s studio and made a complete fool of herself. It’s definitely worth a watch:\n\nJust as Ellen does it, the entire cast of Modern Family enjoys knocking on Sofia, as well. It’s a very common request to have the members of the show attempt a classic Vergera accent, whether it be during a talk show interview or award show acceptance speech. You can laugh at their attempts here:\n\nIt’s even been an on-going joke on-screen, throughout all five season of Modern Family. What is she saying?\n\nSofia’s accent is huge part of who she is in real life, and who she is on screen, as Gloria. According to Vergara, in an article written for thewrap.com, Steve Levitan and Christopher Lloyd tailored the role just for her. She said,\n\n“They had meetings with me at the beginning and they would ask me things, because the character has a lot of similarities with my real life. I am an immigrant in this country, I have an accent, I’m Colombian, I have a child from a previous marriage. So it was created around me. But now they have Google so they don’t really need to ask me, ‘What is a Colombian dish or a Colombian hat?’ They just go and Google it.”\n\nModern Family Season 5, Episode 18: Las Vegas\n\nAired 3/16/14\n\nIn this episode of Modern Family, the adults of show take Las Vegas. There are 3 stories involved. And, a lot of jokes. It was strange watching an episode of the show where the entire family isn’t involved. None of the kids are a part of the episode. But, it was still funny, and still true to Modern Family, nonetheless. There was also a lot going on. Lots of running around and quick, intersecting scenes. The writer’s definitely did an incredible job connecting story lines and jokes. Thumbs up, guys.\n\nAccording to ABC, the breakdown (essentially) goes as follows:\n\nStory 1: The Vegas Vacation, a Butler and a Dog Maid\n\nThe parents take a weekend trip to Sin City for the weekend, compliments of Jay scoring “elite high-roller” suites at the Mandalay Bay’s exclusive Excelsior Level. Which, Jay believes to be the most elite, only to find out there are in fact 2 levels above Excelsior. Included with the suites is personal, British butler Lesley Higgins (played by guest star Stephen Merchant (The Ricky Gervais Show)). Gloria has no problem with him, but instead the maid. The hotel gift shop sells a gigantic dog statue dressed as a maid named Rebarka, which is believed to be the perfect match to Jay’s dog butler Barkely.\n\nStory 2: Phil Dunphy and the Secret Society of Magicians\n\nWhile Claire and Phil are hoping to have some alone time, together, in Vegas, Phil can’t shake the idea of slipping away to a Vegas Secret Magic Society. He was invited to performs for them and makes it his goal to get there, get it done, and impress. Once he finally slips away, Phil plans on performing his “Metamorphosis” trick to wow the society, which includes the heroes of the “underground magic blogosphere”. Meanwhile, Claire is interested in proving that Vegas has a gambling named Claire. She’s hoping to hit the casino and win back all of the money that she had lost on a girls’ night in Vegas, at which time she had gambled away the savings she and Phil were putting away for a 25th anniversary trip. She can’t stop, and goes as far as to get her brother involved in the obsession, as well.\n\nSTORY 3: Mitch, Cam and the Bachelor Party\n\nMitch runs into his ex, Langham (guest star Fred Armisen from Portlandia), in the hotel, whom he dumped via email. Turns out, Langham and his new partner Tim are engaged, and choose to invite Cam and Mitch to their Vegas Bachelor party. Mitch would rather stay away from the situation, and relax at the spa, while Cam decides he’d like to sneak away to check out the festivities. Which, ends up getting the two into a sticky situation during which Langham believes the two are interested in a threesome.\n\nMemorable Quotes:\n\nJay: “Gloria, there’s a floor above us.”\n\nGloria: “What?!?”\n\nJay: “I know, it threw me, too. Excelsior Plus. But to the people on that floor, we’re Excelsior Minus.”\n\nHiggins (watching The Kilty Pleasures perform in the hotel room): “This reminds me of my late grandfather.”\n\nPhil: “He was Scottish?”\n\nHiggins: “He was a stripper.”\n\nMitchell: “Oh, no, I’m really worn out from my massage, the sauna… It was a lot of detoxing, so…”\n\nClaire: “Uh-huh. You know what you need? Some toxing. Hand of blackjack, a couple of tequilas. C’mon, it’ll be fun. Do it!”\n\nMitchell: “You sound just like the kid who bullied me into smoking my first cigarette.”\n\nClaire: “Maybe this time you won’t tell on me.”\n\nPhil (introducing his magic trick): “The miracle of ‘Metamorphosis.’ They say the only constant is change. Well, all of that is about to ch… be different.”\n\nClaire: “Vegas you have a gambling problem and her name is Claire.”\n\nCameron Tucker, played by Eric Stonstreet, is the partner and bubbly counterpart to Mitchell Pritchett. Together the two are the parents of their adopted Vietnamese daughter, Lily. Before she went kindergarten he was a stay at home dad, but now, he’s a music teacher at Luke and Manny’s school. Known for his big and dramatic personality, Cam is a mix of unexpectedness, having been a professional part slow and offensive line for a Big Ten school. More specifically, he was, in fact, the center for the Fighting Illini, as well as a classically-trained Auguste clown named Fizbo.\n\n“I’m sort of like Costco. I’m big, I’m not fancy and I dare you not to like me.” -Cameron Tucker\n\nCam is a sweet giving man, but because of his over the top personality and popularity, he can sometimes overdo it, always wanting to be the center of attention. This creates conflict as he lashed out at other people in attempt to steal attention and be the best. According to his family back in Missouri someone who isn’t emotionally “farm strong” a “Cam”.\n\nIn my opinion, the best part of Cam Tucker is the fact that he’s played by Eric Stonestreet-who isn’t actually gay in real life. He identifies as straight, while playing a flamboyant gay man on screen. In my opinion, that’s a serious testament to his acting skills. Eric has won two Emmy Awards for his performance on Modern Family and seems to really enjoy playing his part. According to an article on the topics on Starcasm.com, he’s “openly straight,” and he has no problem playing a gay man on television. On-screen fiance Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who is in fact gay, doesn’t view it as an problem, either. Eric has joked, “I kind of always felt like I had to dig myself out of a bit of a hole and let girls know that I’m actually straight,”. According to Jesse, in Out Magazine in 2009, “He is so game for this character. We just clicked. We hang out a lot,”. Together, the two joke about Eric being “gay for pay”.\n\nIs he really anything like his character? Find out here:\n\nIn an article on the “Modern Writers” Behind L.A.’s Modern Family, writer and co-executive producer of the show, Bill Wrubel, opens up about what it takes to write one episode of the show. The timeline, the process, and outcome.\n\nEach episode is gone through a total of three times: first with the script, then during the shoot, and finally once more in the editing room. According to Wrubel, the actors on the show are respectful of the script, keeping the writer’s words in mind, but “they also get to play with them.” With that, Wrubel also mentioned that, “the focus is always on telling a story, not to tell a joke. We let the jokes come out of the story rather than concoct a story just to keep telling jokes.”\n\nWrubel mentioned, “The writing process for television is completely different than what I was used to, and I was intimidated because I didn’t know if it was something that I could be good at doing. The whole idea of thinking out loud in a room full of talented and funny people, when you know so much of what you say will be bad, is an intimidating reality you have to get comfortable with.”\n\nFor many shows, writer’s hours are known fro being incredibly long. According to Wrubel, Modern Family’s writer’s hours are fairly reasonable. On most days, Wrubel will work from 10 in the morning to 6:30 in the evening. And, it’s all work. Hours are never wasted “joking around or watching funny clips on YouTube”.\n\nEach episode is completely a group project. Levitan and Lloyd are the head honchos but the rest of the team of writers is also heavily involved. Each writer is assigned to write a specific episode, making it their task to decide exactly what it is that Levitan and Lloyd want. In order to complete what sounds like a difficult task of fitting this into a polished script is made easier by sticking to storytelling fundamentals.\n\nA typical timeline of a Modern Family episode appears below:\n\nAccording to Wrubel, when it comes time for the script to shot, the writer of the episode now wears the hat of a co-executive producer. While Lloyd and Levitan oversee the show, the writers will essentially be involved with every phase of the shoot, casting, and all. If the writer isn’t writing a specific episode, their job focuses to a number of different tasks, collaborating on various episodes in a single day.\n\n“On any given day I could be working on story breaking for one episode, reading someone’s script for another, looking at outlines and giving notes for as many as five different episodes,” said Wrubel.\n\nOverall, everything put into the show comes directly from the writer’s own experiences. All of the material is drawn from their own lives and stories. It would seem difficult to continue to get material for a show with ten distinct characters, after five seasons. But, with this many writers, and all of their live experience, there’s a lot to pull from.\n\nAccording to Wrubel, the writers come together, each day, after lunch to kick around stories from their lives and explore possible situations for the show. He also mentions, with a chuckle, “When I go to coach my daughter’s softball team, I secretly hope that something humorous or unusual will happen that I can put into a story,”."
