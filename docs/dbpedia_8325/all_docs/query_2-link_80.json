        "text": "About the Show\n\nIt seems that today's families have embraced this particular modern family, which is anything but cookie cutter and is just as honest and complex as their own. The Pritchett clan has Jay sitting at the head, a true guys' guy experiencing a bit of mid-life crisis, has remarried a much younger wife, Gloria, whose passion and loyalty is matched by her 11-year-old son, Manny, a boy wise beyond his years. Blending together into this new family has quite the learning curve with some culture clashes, a few awkward misunderstandings, and plenty of sweet victories along the way.\n\nJay's grown daughter, Claire, has her own family. Claire and Phil are the proud parents of three kids with whom they want that open, healthy, honest relationship. It's not always easy, especially when you have a teenage daughter who's growing up a little fast, a too-smart-for-her-own-good middle daughter and a scatterbrained boy. On top of that, Phil wants to be the \"cool dad,\" while Claire is just trying her best to run a tight ship, determined not to let her kids have the rebellious childhood she had.\n\nClaire's brother and Jay's grown son, Mitchell, adopted a Vietnamese baby with his partner of five years, Cameron. Opposites attract in this household, with Cameron having a wonderfully big personality and maybe a flare for the dramatic, whereas Mitchell is the more serious of the two. They balance each other out and are doting fathers trying to do their best as new parents.\n\nAll of these three families are unique unto themselves, and together they give us an honest and often hilarious look into the sometimes warm, sometimes twisted embrace of the modern family.\n\n\"Modern Family\" stars Ed O'Neill as Jay, Julie Bowen as Claire, Ty Burrell as Phil, Sofia Vergara as Gloria, Jesse Tyler Ferguson as Mitchell, Eric Stonestreet as Cameron, Sarah Hyland as Haley, Nolan Gould as Luke, Ariel Winter as Alex and Rico Rodriguez as Manny.\n\nThe series is produced by Twentieth Century Fox Television in association with Levitan Lloyd Productions. Steven Levitan and Christopher Lloyd are executive producers/creators.\n\nList All Shows\n\nModern Family Message Board\n\nWelcome to the \"Modern Family\" Message Board - the place to discuss anything and everything about \"Modern Family.\"\n\nFeel free to discuss the show in general, the individual episodes, the cast and characters, and any other aspect of the show.
