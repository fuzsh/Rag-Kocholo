        "text": "Sarah Jane Hyland is an American actress who portrayed Haley Dunphy (later Haley Marshall) on Modern Family.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nSarah Hyland was born in New York City, to parents Melissa Canaday and Edward James Hyland.\n\nCareer[]\n\nSarah began in the business at the age of 4 with commercial work and voice overs. Her first film was Private Parts (1997). She then moved on to The Object of My Affection (1998) and then spent time on \"Another World\" as \"Rain Wolfe\", a child found in the park, and fostered by Josie and Gary. Sarah would go on to work with Amy Carlson several more times: \"Falcone\", \"Law & Order\" and \"Law & Order: Trial by Jury\". Sarah was cast as one of the young \"Audrey Hepburns\" in Jennifer Love Hewitt's The Audrey Hepburn Story the same year she was cast as \"Molly\" in ABC's Annie (TV) starring Kathy Bates, Audra McDonald, Alan Cummings, Victor Garber and Kristin Chenoweth, Joe Gould's Secret and \"Falcone\". Aside from all of her film and television work, Sarah studied voice, ballet, jazz, hip-hop, tap, theater Dance, and performed with her tap and theater dance class at \"Reel to Real\" at Lincoln Center as invited performers.\n\nHer work on \"Lipstick Jungle\" (2008) as Brooke Shields's daughter further showcased her talent and, because of LJ's cancellation, drew her to Los Angeles and the role of \"Haley Dunphy\" on \"Modern Family\" (2009).\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nSarah has a maltipoo named Barkley, and is happily living in the Los Angeles Area. Her brother, Ian Hyland, is also an actor and, even though most think Ian is her older brother, he is really 4 years her junior.\n\nShe dated Matt Prokop, who was in HSM3 and Geek Charming (in which she starred alongside him) from 2009 until August 2014 for abusive reasons.\n\nShe then dated Dominic Sherwood from 2015 from 2017.\n\nIn 2017, Sarah began dating The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise alum Wells Adams. They got engaged in July 2019. Before he popped the question, Wells not only got permission to propose from Sarah's parents, he got it from Julie Bowen and Ty Burrell. On August 20, 2022, Sarah and Wells got married.\n\nKidney Disease & Transplant[]\n\nIn 2012, Sarah revealed as she reported to Seventeen Magazine & Good Morning America that she had a secret long battle with kidney disease since she was the age of nine. She hid her pain by sitting down and/or texting in character while filming. To make matters worse, she couldn't get a transplant until her pain worsened. Eventually it did, and she set out to find a donor. Miraculously, it was discovered that her father Edward James Hyland was the perfect donor. She finally got the transplant she had been waiting for for on April 22, 2012. Sarah recovered over the summer of 2012 while her current hit show was on summer break.[1][2][3]\n\nYears later in 2017, Sarah underwent a second kidney transplant when the one that was given to her failed her; this time with her brother as the donor.[4]\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm[]\n\nYear Film Role Notes 1997 A Tall Winter's Tale Elizabeth Short Film Private Parts Howard's Daughter Credited as Sarah Jane Hyland 1998 The Object of My Affection Molly 1999 Advice from a Caterpillar Lizbeth Cradle Will Rock Silvano - Giovanna 2000 Joe Gould's Secret Elizabeth Mitchell 2002 The Empath Young Christine 2004 Spanglish Sleepover Friend 2007 Blind Date Child Voice Only 2010 Monster Heroes Delilah I Owe My Life to Corbin Bleu Herself/Sarah Short Film 2011 Conception Tracey Cougars, Inc.
