        "text": "Repression\n\nWhen 18-year-old Meghan Ramsey (guest star Kelly Hutchinson) is aided by her therapist (guest star Shirley Knight) in recalling childhood molestation by her father (guest star Brian Kerwin), she reports the incest to Detectives Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni) in hopes of sparing her younger sisters the same fate. Though initially her mother (guest star Amy Irving) does not believe her, eventually the entire family turns on the accused man despite his protests and the discovery of tainted evidence. But when his punishment is exacted outside of the legal system, everyone in the fragile family becomes a suspect.\n\nHothouse\n\nWhen the body of a fourteen year-old girl is found floating in the Hudson River, Detectives Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) think she was smuggled into the country by sex traffickers. In an effort to identify the body, Detective Benson goes undercover as a Madame and busts sex trafficker Alik (Guest Star Misha Kuznetsov). When Alik makes a deal with ADA Kim Greylek (Michaela McManus) he identifies the body as Elsa Lychkoff. To the detectivesÂ surprise, Elsa wasnÂt a prostitute, but a child prodigy. Prying more into the victimÂs secret life, the detectives investigate her elite boarding school and her roommate Jennifer Banks (guest star Sarah Hyland), who in turn, leads them to compulsive gambler, Joseph Lychkoff (guest star George Tasudis), ElsaÂs father. When the motive of Joseph seems obvious as to why he would kill his daughter, Detective Odafin Tutuola (Ice-T) discovers some new evidence could change the entire case. Also starring: Richard Belzer (Detective John Munch), Dann Florek (Captain Donald Cragen), Ice-T (Detective Odafin Tutuola), Michaela McManus (A.D.A Kim Greylek), Tamara Tunie (Dr. Melinda Warner), and B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang)."
