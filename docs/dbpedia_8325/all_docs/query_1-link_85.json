        "text": "It's hard to believe that it's been over three years since Modern Family ended, but the cast is still so close with each other that they really did become a family offscreen as well. Pretty often, cast members will share pics of them hanging out together. For example, most recently, Jesse Tyler Ferguson went to support Aubrey Anderson-Emmons (who played Lily on the show) at her school play.\n\nSince it's just so feel-good to see them all hanging out together IRL, here are 19 pics that'll almost make it feel like the show never ended:\n\n1.When most of the family got together to celebrate Sarah Hyland and Wells Adams' wedding — and Jesse Tyler Ferguson even officiated the event:\n\n2.When Sarah posted a Father's Day tribute to all her dads — her father, her father-in-law, and Ty Burrell, of course:\n\n3.When Sarah, Jesse, and Nolan Gould reunited on the WGA picket line:\n\n4.When Sofía Vergara, who's a judge on America's Got Talent, was totally surprised by her onscreen son, Rico Rodriguez, for a mini-reunion:\n\n5.When Eric Stonestreet went to visit Jesse's home (and met his son Beckett for the first time):\n\n6.When Jesse's IRL fam enjoyed a little Modern Family picnic:\n\n7.When Sofía shared a picture of Jesse and Julie Bowen hanging out in her luxurious closet...\n\n8....and then shared this selfie along with Jesse's husband, Justin, that shows she has a framed version of that famous pic of her and Julie from the show:\n\n9.When Nolan and Jesse just ran into each other on the street and Jesse joked, \"Just like real family he didn’t call to tell me he was in town\":\n\n10.When Sarah shared a selfie of her and her \"little sister\" Ariel Winter:\n\n11.When much of the cast reunited for Modern Family creator Steve Levitan's wedding:\n\n12.When Jesse starred in Take Me Out on Broadway, his cast showed up to support him. Like his \"nephew\" Nolan:\n\n13.Ty Burrell, who snapped this shot backstage:\n\n14.Aubrey, which makes the whole school play visit even sweeter:\n\n15.Sarah and Wells, who caught it before its Broadway run:\n\n16.Julie, who was a proud sister:\n\n17.And, of course, Eric was in attendance as well:\n\n18.When Rico and Nolan spent July 4th together this year:\n\n19.When Jesse and Julie showed how much they're like siblings IRL:\n\n20.When Aubrey and Jesse had a \"father daughter date night\":\n\n21.And finally, just this adorable pic of Jesse and Eric:"
