She has been raised together with her younger brother, Ian Hyland. He is also an actor just like her.

She made her Broadway debut as Jackie Bouvier in the “Grey Gardens” production. The success of this role paved the way for her roles in film and television. Her big break came in 2009 when she got cast in “Modern Family” as Haley Dunphy, a role she played for the sitcom’s 11 seasons.\n\nDuring the same year, Hyland reprised her role in “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” on an episode titled, “Hothouse.” She went on to co-star with Matt Prokop, who she was dating then, in “Geek Charming,” a Disney Channel original movie.
