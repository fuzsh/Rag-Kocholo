Have an account? .\n\nThough it's been around for a while, \"Modern Family\" is still widely considered one of the most successful sitcoms of all time. Since its 2009 debut, the show has earned massive ratings and turned its cast members into full-fledged TV stars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout its time on air, the ABC sitcom has also brought on dozens of celebrity guest stars. Since even the most dedicated of fans likely don't remember every single cameo from over 200 episodes, here's a refresher on some of the many celebrities who have appeared on \"Modern Family.\"\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEdward Norton played bass player Izzy LaFontaine in season one.\n\nYou may not remember this cameo from all the way back in season one, but it's one worth reliving. In \"Great Expectations,\" Claire, in an attempt to finally give Phil a great anniversary gift, arranges for a private performance by Izzy LaFontaine, the fictional bass player of Spandau Ballet, played by none other than Edward Norton.\n\nDespite LaFontaine's best efforts, the gift doesn't exactly go over as well as Claire hoped, as it turns out Phil isn't actually a fan of the band.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin Hart played the Dunphys' neighbor during season three.\n\nBefore he and the Rock became onscreen and offscreen BFFs, Kevin Hart was busy playing a friend to Phil Dunphy on season three of \"Modern Family.\" His character, Andre, is an orthopedic surgeon who has been living next door to the Dunphys' for several years.\n\nHe shows up twice in season three, first offering to help Phil build a treehouse for Luke in \"Treehouse\" and then later convincing Phil to buy a Porsche, to Claire's chagrin, in \"Planes, Trains, and Cars.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Marsden portrays a Reiki therapy expert in season two.\n\nIn season two's \"Slow Down Your Neighbors,\" James Marsden makes a cameo as Mitchell and Cameron's eccentric new neighbor, Barry — or at least, that's who he claims to be when they find him in their hot tub. Barry soon reveals he's an expert in Reiki massage, causing Mitchell to quickly write him off as strange.\n\nCameron, taken by Barry's good looks, is quick to defend him against Mitchell's concern, but his infatuation comes to an abrupt end when he realizes that Barry is not actually living next door, but in their daughter's outdoor princess castle.\n\nMatt Dillon showed up as Claire's ex-boyfriend in season two.\n\nWhat's worse than having an ex-boyfriend show up at your niece's birthday? Having your ex-boyfriend show up with your mother, as Matt Dillon's Robbie Sullivan did in the season two episode \"Princess Party.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJane Krakowsi portrayed Gloria's nemesis in season five and nine.\n\n\"Modern Family\" fans may not remember Jane Krakowski's fairly good impression of Regina George in the season five episode \"Under Pressure.\" Gloria encounters Krakowski's mean mom character, Dr. Donna Duncan, during an open house at the high school.\n\nDr. Duncan showed up again more recently in season nine, upstaging Gloria's celebrations for with a bigger party in \"Clash of the Swords.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRay Liotta plays himself on the show's seventh season.\n\nRay Liotta helps save the day during a disastrous birthday celebration for Mitchell in the season seven episode, \"Playdates.\" After Hayley, Luke, and Alex forget to plan the belated birthday surprise they promised their uncle, they end up taking him on an impromptu walking tour of celebrity homes to try and find Barbra Streisand's house.\n\nInstead, they run into Liotta, who makes Mitchell's dream partly come true when he calls Streisand on the phone and allows him to talk to her. Streisand makes a voice cameo in the episode as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeegan-Michael Key's Tom wins a bet against Phil in season seven.\n\nIn addition to featuring Liotta and Streisand, season seven's \"Playdates\" also brought Keegan-Michael Key into the fold, although not as himself. In the episode, Key plays one-half of a wealthy couple that Claire and Phil meet on vacation and hit it off with. That is, except for one little problem: The two, Tom and Lisa, never offer to pay for a meal, always leaving the Dunphys' to pick up the bill instead.\n\nClaire gets more and more worked up over the issue — until, in typical \"Modern Family\" fashion, Phil is forced to admit that the reason they're paying for the meals is actually his fault, as he lost a bet to Tom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda's character tries to pitch Jay a business idea on season two.\n\nWe can thank Lin-Manuel Miranda's character, Guillermo, for introducing Jay to his now-favorite member of the family, his dog, Stella. The grocery store worker brings the pooch over in an attempt to sell Jay on the idea of a dog-training system called \"The Good Doggy/Bad Doggy Training System.\"\n\nWhen Jay bluntly tells him that his pet business idea isn't very good, Guillermo decides to rethink his life and ends up leaving the Pritchetts with Stella, who Jay quickly falls in love with (much to Gloria's annoyance).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJosh Gad plays a billionaire who credits Phil for his success in season three.\n\nIn season three, Josh Gad plays Kenneth, a former neighbor of the Dunphys who became a tech ingenue and made billions of dollars on a video game invention. Kenneth claims he owes his success to Phil, who he used to idolize as a young kid and who he says always encouraged him to follow his heart.\n\nUnfortunately for Claire, his visit ends up backfiring on her. Taken aback by his former neighbor's achievements, Phil tells Claire he would be more creative too, if only she wasn't constantly stopping him from pursuing his ideas.\n\nPatton Oswalt portrays the leader of a magical society during the show's fifth season.\n\nPatton Oswalt makes a cameo during the season five episode, \"Las Vegas,\" in which the whole \"Modern Family\" crew heads to the city for the weekend. While Claire is occupied trying to win back some money she lost on a similar trip to Vegas years ago, Phil goes on an underground audition for a secret society of magicians, led by Oswalt's peculiar character, Ducky.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Mantzoukas plays Haley's much older love interest in season four.\n\nMost of Haley's boyfriends on the show have made Phil and Claire mad at some point, and Jason Mantzoukas' season four character, Kenneth, is no exception. Kenneth is a jean designer who works with Hayley at a boutique. When the two decide to go out on a date in the episode \"Party Crasher,\" it doesn't go over very well with her parents, since Kenneth is around Phil's age.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAisha Tyler's character offers Mitchell a job in season five.\n\nMitchell finds himself in some very confusing circumstances in season five episode \"Spring-a-Ding-Fling,\" thanks to the appearance of his old classmate, Wendy, played by Aisha Tyler.\n\nAfter reuniting, she offers him a new job and takes him to her office to show him around. But a series of mishaps and miscommunications lead him to believe she's a terrible boss who treats her employees horribly. Before he can realize his mistake, Mitchell decides to confront her, leading to an awkward but enlightening interaction between the two.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJesse Eisenberg plays a judgmental neighbor in season five.\n\nMitchell and Cameron are forced to confront another crazy neighbor in season five's \"Under Pressure,\" this time played by Jesse Eisenberg. Eisenberg's Asher is a know-it-all environmentalist whose pushy ways rub Mitchell the wrong way.\n\nThe two seem to eventually make peace after Asher admits that his passion for the planet and eco-friendly practices have prevented him from making friends. But Mitchell's daughter Lily remains less than impressed by the neighbor, especially after he asks her if her dollhouse is made out of sustainable materials.\n\nVisit INSIDER's homepage for more.\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
