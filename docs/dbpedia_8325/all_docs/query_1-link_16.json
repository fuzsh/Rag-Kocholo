        "text": "Modern Family (originally titled My American Family[1]) is an American television sitcom, created by Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan, that debuted on ABC on September 23, 2009. Presented in a mockumentary style, the fictional characters frequently talk directly into the camera. The program is the story of Jay Pritchett, his second wife, his stepson, and their infant son; and his two adult children and their families in suburban Los Angeles. Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan conceived the series while sharing stories of their own \"modern families\". There are eleven seasons total of the show.\n\nCreation[]\n\nAs creators Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan retold stories about their families, they realized that the stories could be the basis for a show. They started working on the idea of a family being observed in a mockumentary-style show. They later decided that it could be a show about three families and their experiences. It was originally going to be called My American Family, and the camera crew was originally supposed to have been run by a fictitious Dutch filmmaker named Geert Floortje who had lived with Jay's family as a teenage exchange student and developed a crush on Claire (while Mitchell had had a crush on him). The producers later felt that this component was unnecessary, and it was scrapped. Lloyd now prefers to look at the show as \"a family show done documentary-style\".\n\nThe creators pitched it to the Big Three television networks (they did not pitch it to Fox because of issues Lloyd had with the network over Back to You). CBS, which was not ready to use the single-camera style of filming nor ready to make another large commitment, rejected the series. The network had recently aired Welcome to The Captain and Worst Week, two single-camera sitcoms that lasted only one season (CBS would not attempt another single-camera series until 2013, when it picked up both We Are Men and The Crazy Ones for its fall lineup; We Are Men was cancelled after two episodes, The Crazy Ones was also cancelled after one season). NBC, already broadcasting The Office and Parks and Recreation, decided against taking on a third mockumentary-style show. ABC accepted the series and picked it up for a full season.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nThe show revolves around three (3 and now Four \"4\") families are all living in the Los Angeles, CA area who are interrelated through Jay Prichett and his children, Claire and Mitchell.

They have three children: Haley, the stereotypical ditzy teenage girl and now married to her boyfriend into new husband Dylan and now ready to raise new twin children are Poppy & George; Alex, a nerdy, smart middle child; and Luke, the offbeat only son.
