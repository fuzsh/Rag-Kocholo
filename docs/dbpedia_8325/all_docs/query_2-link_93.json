        "text": "Interview: Judy Greer Details On Oscar Nominated ‘Descendants’ Film, Confirms Our Admiration For Her\n\nJudy Greer is that kind of actress that anyone would be truly lucky to interview. Whether the conversation be about a current project, a past role or just to chat about working hard and just following through with something you love to do. Let’s just say I consider myself quite fortunate that I was able to speak with her and I wasn’t shy admitting it.\n\nGreer has a memorable face because it’s probably quite difficult going through a whole week without seeing her somewhere on television. For me it was The Wedding Planner in 2001 as the quirky friend Penny that hooked me. Since then she’s moved on to appearing in 13 Going on 30, The Village, Elizabethtown, 27 Dresses, Love and Other Drugs and can currently be seen in the Oscar contenderThe Descendants. Not to mention her guest spots in some of the biggest small screen hits like Arrested Development, Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory, How I Met Your Mother and Two and a Half Men.\n\nDuring our chat Judy revealed that she loves both television and film and searches for any kind of role. Recently she just struck a deal to star and executive produce a new ABC comedy pilot titled American Judy. Just signifying her role as a household name once again.\n\nBut enough of the girl crush moment–talking with Judy is simply the perfect way to end a day. We talked George Clooney, her passions besides acting and her scene-stealer ways. Not to mention–how L.A. really does have awful traffic.\n\nWow. Well, you are one of my favorite actresses and I know we only have a few minutes so I’ll get right to it.\n\nOh, you’re so sweet, thank you by the way.\n\nYou’re just great and your work in The Descendants shows that. What drew you to the film and your role Julie?\n\nWell, Alexander [Payne]. [Laughs] The script is amazing, the role is amazing but I would have done anything he was directing.\n\nWhat’s it been like hearing all of this Oscar buzz for it?\n\nIt’s really exciting! I agree with it and I’m excited to be part of the movie and to be doing this kind of press for a movie. It’s all new for me. It’s nice not to have to come and go, you know?\n\nAbsolutely. You can hold on to it for a bit longer. I was talking to Nick Krause on how the film is like an emotional roller coaster, up and down. What do you think audiences will take away from it?\n\nThat’s a really good question. I think it’s a movie about forgiveness. I feel like maybe audiences will take away really enjoying two hours of amazing film making or they’ll see something a little deeper in their own lives that could affect the choices they make in the future.\n\nWould you consider yourself like your character?\n\nI think I’m kind of like all my characters I play. I bring a lot of myself to my roles. And in this situation, I felt like I was similar to Julie. Gosh, I don’t know off the top of my head but I felt like there was, like a I had a real sense of comfort when I was playing her. She wanted to have a nice, normal life and things got really turned around for her and she was trying to deal with it the best way she knew how.\n\nYou’re married to Matthew Lillard in the movie and there’s of course George Clooney. How was it working with them?\n\nWell, working with George is always a pleasure because he is very fun, as I’m sure you’ve heard. He’s very professional and really compassionate and I’ve worked with him before he was a director. I wouldn’t say he’s changed since he’s been a director but he’s very conscious of the process, how every actor’s process is different and he’s really mindful of that when we’re doing scenes together. And working with Matthew Lillard, it was really a pleasure. He’s so positive and happy. I really think he’s a real artist. He cares so much about acting and about his work and that’s always inspiring when I work with people who love what they do. So many people are complainers!\n\nComplainers?\n\nYeah! So many people just complain all the time!\n\nI get what you mean! It’s especially kind of weird when people with great careers complain. It’s nice when people are appreciative of what they have.\n\nYeah I always think so too. I mean there are always things to complain about, but it’s amazing to me what people come up with.\n\n[Laughs] What’s a specific scene in the film that you’re really proud of or you just enjoyed acting in the most?\n\nI guess I felt that the scene on the beach was very simple and I liked how simple and easy that scene came together. The scene where George Clooney’s character talks to me for the first time. There was a lightness I felt when we were shooting it that I really loved. He’s asking me what I’m doing, if I live on the island. He’s trying to get information out of me but I don’t know that. I just think he’s a man talking to me on the beach. And I really like that scene because two different people are doing two different things. You know, I’m just chatting with the guy and he’s got a whole different agenda.\n\nWhat’s one memory you would take away from set?\n\nI remember one night when we were shooting the scene on the deck and it was raining intermittently, and it would rain and we would all go inside and sit in the house and hang out and talk and then it would stop so we would go back outside and keep shooting. I remember all of us sitting in the house together and hanging out and just chatting and talking about acting and life and I just remember it being really fun.\n\nThat’s nice!\n\nReally! The company of actors.\n\nYou’re such a scene-stealer in every project you do. Some actors don’t like to be type casted but in every movie you seem to be somewhat of a comedic relief. What’s one of your favorite characters you’ve played?\n\nWell I loved my role in The TV Set. That was the movie with Sigourney Weaver and David Duchovny that Jake Kasdan wrote and directed. I play David Duchovny’s manager who doesn’t know anything about Hollywood. I loved that whole job and I loved that character–just unapologetically misinformed and uneducated about what she does for a living. I also loved being Kitty Sanchez on Arrested Developmentbecause she is totally crazy. Like over the top crazy. So really with that role and that cast, anything goes.\n\nYou’ve done so many guest spots too like Modern Family. Is there a chance you’ll be back?\n\nI loved Modern Family.\n\nYou were so hilarious!\n\nAh so fun! I love Modern Family. I don’t know if I’ll be back—I would love to go back. I loved playing the weirdo lady on My Name is Earl. [Laughs] She was so weird and cool. Those are the two cools ones.\n\nBecause of the comedic roles, do you consider yourself funny?\n\nYeah I don’t know if I’m that funny in real life…but I certainly try to be! I try to make people laugh. My publicist is nodding her head. [Laughs]\n\nYou’ve worked with so many people, so many people have worked with you. Is there anyone else you hope to collaborate with?\n\nI’d love to be directed by George Clooney and I’d love to be in Tom McCarthy’s next movie.\n\nWhat’s three passions you have besides acting?\n\nI’m passionate about the Mary Tyler Moore Show. I’m passionate about reading. And gosh, I guess food. I’m not a good cook but I really like eating. I would like to say something way cooler. [Laughs] I really like this place in downtown L.A. called Homeboy Industries. It’s amazing; it’s a gang rehabilitation program. I think it’s a really cool organization. It’s really special and I think there are so many great charities and foundations and organizations. I support a lot of them but this one is something that is making an impact on the actual place I live.\n\nThat’s awesome. I was just going to ask what you do on your downtime when not acting.\n\nI drive around L.A. in traffic [Laughs].\n\nWhat a pain! I know you did ballet years ago. When was the moment you knew you wanted to start acting?\n\nIt happened very organically for me my whole career, so it wasn’t until a few years after I started acting that I realized how scared I was that I wouldn’t be able to do it [ballet] forever. And I was like, “Wow I really love this, I really care about this. I want this to be the thing I do with my life.” It was cool because I wasn’t so very driven in the beginning I just felt, ‘Oh I need to get jobs so I can support myself.” And yeah, I guess I had some kind of Aha moment. I was like “Okay yeah, this is it.”\n\nYou seem so natural. Did you not have lessons?\n\nOh no, gosh I trained like crazy! Even then I was like, ‘Oh I could always go to grad school and do something else.’\n\nWhat do you think you’d be doing if you weren’t an actress?\n\nI think about that all the time. If I had to quit acting now and do something else I don’t know what I would do. I don’t know! I don’t have a sense of what I’m good at anymore. I can’t really use computers and I think you have to use a computer for almost everything these days. So I don’t know.\n\nHaha, okay. So one last question. You do both film and television. Are you always looking for the next project?\n\nI search for everything. I’m still sort of a medium list. I’m still not partial. I like good projects and good people.\n\nInterview: ‘Modern Family’s’ Ariel Winter Talks Inside Jokes And Who Gives Her Advice On Set\n\nModern Family needs no introduction. Its a huge ABC hit with an even bigger following. Its brought us quick one liners, a thirty minute pick me up each week and the Dunphy family we all wish we could be a apart of for just one day. Its also brought us without a doubt, break out actress Ariel Winter. At 13-years-old, Ariel has booked work in everything from film to television that include roles in ER, Bones, Criminal Minds, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and Horton Hears a Who!\n\nWith a perky attitude and an obvious maturity, Ariel left us wondering how she could only be 13 while she clued us in on some behind the scenes scoop. So check out what actor she’s closest to on set, what other dad besides Phil she’d like to act with and how the cast reacted the day after they won their 2011 Emmy for Best Comedy Series.\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to start acting? What was your first job?\n\nMy very first job was a Cool Whip commercial. I’ve always known I really, really wanted to act but I think, as I got older–once I hit eight- I knew immediately. Once I started doing movies and television I knew immediately that this is everything I’ve ever wanted to do. I love acting. I love playing a different character. It’s just a passion. It’s like Halloween 365 days a year!\n\nDo you take classes on the Modern Family set?\n\nI do school with Nolan and Rico. Every day we do three hours of school when we’re on set. It’s cool to go to school on a set. Not many kids can say that they do so I think I’m pretty lucky about that. I’d rather be in like a home schooled or online school while on set just because if I didn’t act and had to go to public school I’d be really sad because I love acting.\n\nThe show is of course a huge hit and won an Emmy for Best Comedy Series in 2011. So well deserved! Did you and the cast think you were going to win?\n\nEach year its like we could win, but we’re going to be happy for everybody because we are just so grateful to be nominated. So many of those amazing shows, I mean we watch the other shows and we’re like, ‘this is so amazing. I can’t believe they’re recognizing us among these people.’ And I think every year it’s just a blessing and we’re lucky. Julie and Ty definitely deserved their win that night and we’re so happy for them. They’re incredibly humble. They really deserved it.\n\nWhat was it like the next day? Is it straight back to work?\n\nIt’s totally just straight back to work. We all carry around our little Emmy. The other actors, we don’t get Emmys. The producers and writers all get Emmys so we carry around their Emmys sometimes like ‘Well I’m not coming out of my trailer, I have an Emmy!’ [Laughs] We never mean it though. We’re one of those sets where we actually treat each other like family…we are all a family. We genuinely love each other and we’re genuinely happy when something happens for the other one.\n\nWhat’s your favorite episode with your character Alex and with the cast?\n\nMy favorite episode as Alex would be ‘Dude Ranch.’ It was definitely a changing episode for Alex, growing up and evolving. I really like that the show is starting to kind of give her, her own personality in a sense. I really like my character in that episode and in the third season because I’m becoming more of a role model. I like that because all of my fans can see that it’s cool to be smart and be funny and be popular. And you can just be yourself and that you don’t have to act like somebody else to be your best. You yourself, you’re perfect as just the way you are and I really like that. I like how Alex is kind of preaching that to the whole world.\n\nMy favorite episode as a cast, that’s really my favorite episode as a cast. I wouldn’t be able to pick one. Its like our whole show is SNL crazy so it’s kind of hard to pick a favorite episode.\n\nAlex Dunphy is definitely branching out. Have you thought of any story lines you’d like her to do in the future?\n\nThere are a lot of story lines that I’ve thought about. One would be–I know this is going to sound crazy–but I really think Andy Samberg should guest star as a teacher or something. He can be a teacher that can take over the school…or like having the whole school accepting the nerds. I think that would be a really good episode but I’m really plugging in this whole Andy Samberg thing because I think it should happen. [Laughs]\n\nIs there any inside jokes or traditions on set?\n\nWe never say ‘Oh my God.’ Its always ‘No my God’ because of Jesse Tyler Ferguson. He came up with that. So every time there’s something shocking we go, ‘No my God!’ [Laughs] We have a lot of funny things. Julie’s always doing very weird yoga in the hair and makeup trailer. She does this funny stuff where she stands on her head and hands and her feet are in the air. Ty is always making jokes and every time he comes in in the morning he goes, ‘Where’s the coffee?’ Everyone has their little corks when they come in. So we have a lot of fun things that everyone does on the set.\n\nYou’re all clearly funny. Who’s the biggest jokester?\n\nNolan Gould for the kids is probably the biggest jokester. Adults, I wouldn’t be able to pick one. It’s just so funny with what they do. I wouldn’t be able to pick one out of them–Eric or Ty might be the biggest jokesters on set.\n\nIs there someone who’s a bit more serious? If being serious is even possible on set.\n\nI’m not serious but I know my lines! I don’t think anybody really is really serious on our set. I always know my lines. I have a photographic memory. I just kind of take a mental picture of how things look on a page and then I can remember what the line is. Its odd but it comes in handy. I’m very grateful for my photographic memory. My parents may say that I can’t remember everything they tell me though. [Laughs]\n\nIs there someone you go to for advice or spend the most time with?\n\nWe all see each other at events and we’re always hanging out, but I’d probably say I’m probably the closest to Julie Bowen. She’s always giving me motherly advice even when it’s something really crazy. She’s always helping me out with my situations because she’s a girl and she knows how things go so she helps me out with boys. So does Sarah Hyland and Ty Burrell. They all really help me out. They are like real family to me. I always tell Nolan Gould all of my secrets. Not all of my boy secrets, he already thinks I’m boy crazy. I don’t tell him all of my secrets because he’s very likely to steal them. [Laughs] But you know I’m always telling Julie and Ty a lot of things about life. They are really good TV parents.\n\nThat’s hilarious about Nolan and nice that you have that bond with Julie and Ty! If you had to choose, which dad would you act alongside besides Phil Dunphy?\n\nI’d have to say Ed O’Neill. Ed O’Neill is an incredibly amazing actor. He’s an incredible guy and we’re just so lucky to have him on our set and to be able to work with him. I am so lucky that I actually get to spend time with him each day on the set. He’s so cool and honestly, I’d give him bragging points. I would allow him to brag because he’s incredible. He was in Married With Children for eleven years. He’s so humble and I would love to have more scenes with him. All of the guys really are like my family. I’ve worked with Jesse, Eric and Ty this season–if I could work with Ed that would be a blast.\n\nThat would be an interesting change for Alex to act more with Jay! How’s the new Lily doing?\n\nOh, Aubrey [Anderson-Emmons] is so cute! She’s such an adorable baby and she’s so smart. For a four year old she really knows her lines. She comes in and she knows her mark. She says things and she has personality when she says them. She’s great! We’re really lucky to have Aubrey. We’ll always miss Jaden and Ella [Hiller] but things change. We got Aubrey and we love all of the babies since we’ve bonded with each one of them. We bonded with Aubrey right away when we met her at the photo shoot. She’s an adorable, sweet little baby and she gave me a hug the first time I met her. I was like, ‘Oh my God I love this child!’ [Laughs] So we get along great.\n\nOne of your passions is clearly acting. What are your three other Ologies?\n\nMine are traveling, iPhone, family and then boys. I have to put boys last because my family would be like, ‘Um, why are we number four and not number three?’ [Laughs] My family might actually be number one. Family would be number one, then iPhone, then traveling. No, I’d say put traveling at number four and do boys at number three."
