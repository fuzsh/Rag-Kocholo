Screen Actors Guild Award winner Sarah Hyland and beloved stage and film star Andrew Barth Feldman will star as Audrey and Seymour in the three-time Best Musical Revival Award-winning production of Little Shop Of Horrors, beginning Tuesday, May 28th, 2024. Hyland and Feldman will star opposite Tony Award Nominee Kevin Del Aguila, who joins the company on May 14, and James Carpinello, who continues in the role of Dr. Orin Scrivello D.D.S., at the Westside Theatre .\n\nSarah Hyland, renowned for her iconic portrayal of 'Haley Dunphy' in the critically acclaimed series \"Modern Family,\" has led a multifaceted career that spans across film, television, and theater. She made her Broadway debut in Grey Gardens as Jackie Bouvier and was most recently seen on the stage in the 2014 production of HAIR at the Hollywood Bowl.

And having Andrew, a beloved staple of the Broadway community, step into Seymourâs iconic shoes is such a joy â this is a duo not to be missed!â\n\nHyland, Feldman, Del Aguila, and Carpinello are joined in the cast by Aaron Arnell Harrington (Gun & Powder) as The Voice of Audrey II, Tiffany Renee Thompson as Ronnette, Morgan Ashley Bryant as Crystal, Khadija Sankoh as Chiffon, as well as Camryn Hampton, Michael Iannucci, Weston Chandler Long, Jeff Sears, Teddy Yudain, Zakiya Baptiste, Noel MacNeal, Jon Hoche, Johnny Newcomb, Melissa Victor, and Christine Wanda.\n\nJinkx Monsoon and Corbin Bleu play their final performances as Audrey and Seymour on Sunday, May 26.
