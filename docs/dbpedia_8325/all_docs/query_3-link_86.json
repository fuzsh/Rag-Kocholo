        "text": "Julie Bowen had the best reaction to being credited for helping co-star Sarah Hyland leave an abusive relationship.\n\nWhen asked about the 2014 breakup on Monday’s episode of the “Skinny Confidential Him & Her Podcast,” the actress clarified that she was simply “a responsible adult that happened to be around at the right time.”\n\nBowen, 54, added, “I mean, I’m sure another responsible adult would have done the exact same thing.”\n\nBowen gushed that she “love[s]“ her “Modern Family” co-star, 33, and thinks of her onscreen children — Hyland, Ariel Winter and Nolan Gould — as her own children.\n\nShe confirmed that they “absolutely” still text and call each other “anytime,” even after the long-running series ended in 2020.\n\nTikTok users praised Bowen for not coming “close to disclosing ANY personal information” about Hyland’s past romance during the podcast episode.\n\n“Such a beautiful and honorable way to [respond],” one fan wrote, with another calling her a “national treasure.”\n\nWhile Bowen and co-hosts Lauryn Evarts and Michael Bosstick did not name Hyland’s ex, the former “Love Island USA” host made headlines in 2014 for obtaining a restraining order against Matt Prokop.\n\nShe claimed in court docs that the actor, 33, choked her with a “grip … so tight” she was “scared and in fear for [her] life.”\n\nHyland alleged that Bowen came to her house at the time to help her “peacefully end the relationship.”\n\nBowen, however, called her role “grossly overblown” in a HuffPost Live interview later that same year.\n\n“The reality is I’m just nosy,” she went on to tell Us Weekly. “I stick my nose in anything and everything. I love my kids, my fake kids and my real kids, so if anyone needs help I’m a soft touch.”\n\nHyland has since moved on with Bachelor Nation member Wells Adams, whom she began dating in 2017.\n\nThe couple got engaged in 2019 and walked down the aisle at a California winery three years later."
