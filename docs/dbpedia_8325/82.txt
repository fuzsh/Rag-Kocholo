Her work on "Lipstick Jungle" (2008) as Brooke Shields's daughter further showcased her talent and, because of LJ's cancellation, drew her to Los Angeles and the role of "Haley Dunphy" on "Modern Family" (2009).

Personal Life[]

Sarah has a maltipoo named Barkley, and is happily living in the Los Angeles Area. Her brother, Ian Hyland, is also an actor and, even though most think Ian is her older brother, he is really 4 years her junior.

She dated Matt Prokop, who was in HSM3 and Geek Charming (in which she starred alongside him) from 2009 until August 2014 for abusive reasons.

She then dated Dominic Sherwood from 2015 from 2017.

In 2017, Sarah began dating The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise alum Wells Adams. They got engaged in July 2019. Before he popped the question, Wells not only got permission to propose from Sarah's parents, he got it from Julie Bowen and Ty Burrell. On August 20, 2022, Sarah and Wells got married.

Kidney Disease & Transplant[]

In 2012, Sarah revealed as she reported to Seventeen Magazine & Good Morning America that she had a secret long battle with kidney disease since she was the age of nine. She hid her pain by sitting down and/or texting in character while filming. To make matters worse, she couldn't get a transplant until her pain worsened. Eventually it did, and she set out to find a donor. Miraculously, it was discovered that her father Edward James Hyland was the perfect donor. She finally got the transplant she had been waiting for for on April 22, 2012. Sarah recovered over the summer of 2012 while her current hit show was on summer break.[1][2][3]

Years later in 2017, Sarah underwent a second kidney transplant when the one that was given to her failed her; this time with her brother as the donor.[4]
