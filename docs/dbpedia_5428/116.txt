Vanessa Redgrave has admitted to having "a few affairs on the side" over the course of her 42-year relationship.

The 71-year-old has been involved with Italian actor Franco Nero on and off since 1966 and they have 38-year-old son Carlo.

The couple met while filming Camelot but soon split and Redgrave began dating former Bond star Timothy Dalton.

However, they later reunited and finally exchanged vows in an unofficial ceremony on January 1, 2007.

Redgrave is quoted by Contactmusic as saying: "Franco said when somebody asked him: 'We've been married for 42 years.' So that's his version and I'm sticking to it."

But she added: "Franco's never lived in the same house. Never, never, never. He's an Italian; Italians like to live in Italy and I couldn't transfer my life to Italy."
