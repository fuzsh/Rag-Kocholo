        "text": "Vanessa Redgrave either chose to ignore or, more likely, failed even to notice the compliment. A gushing admirer - describing her performance as Nora Melody in A Touch Of The Poet - had spoken of \"pure magic\" and insisted that she actually \"became the old, downtrodden and defeated\" wife of Eugene O'Neill's brutal braggart. But, instead of impatiently brushing the tribute aside or offering her fluttering thanks, she turned to her brother Corin: \"Con Melody would be a great part for you\". She smiled at the thought of his potential success.\n\nThen, addressing nobody in particular, Vanessa Redgrave asked, \"Do you realise that it's the same story as The Deep Blue Sea\" - the play by Terence Rattigan about a judge's wife who gives up everything for a younger man - \"a woman who willingly sacrifices herself for a man she believes to be a hero?\" It was a perfect illustration of three of the characteristics which govern her complicated personality - reverence for her brother, a penchant for dramatic theories which are most charitably described as novel, and admirable distaste for the flattery which follows fame. Redgrave behaves as if she does not realise how great a star she is - even though her status is confirmed by everyone who speaks about her.\n\nEdward Fox - not a natural ally - commenting on her performance in the film Julia, repeats more or less the comment stuttered out by her adoring fan: \"She became Julia. One leg. Victim of Nazi persecution. Everything.\" In its way, playing Julia - Lillian Hellman's radical heroine - was ideological type-casting. And it won Redgrave an Oscar. But can she become Prospero, in this month's Globe production of the Tempest? For Prospero, if we are to rely on Shakespeare's text, is a man.\n\nFox is even enthusiastic about the prospect of that unconventional casting. \"Wouldn't go to see any other actress do it. But Vanessa is different.\" It is an extraordinary tribute to an actress for whom acting was, at least at the beginning of her career, only second best. Despite the Oscar, the Cannes Palme D'Or, the Evening Standard drama awards and the Olivier prize - all in the cabinet in her drawing room - Redgrave still speaks with obvious regret of her failure to become a ballerina.\n\nShe insists, \"All my tragic moments about what I missed came when I was much younger\". But the yearning in her voice - part of the happy inheritance from her father - is always most pronounced when she talks of those youthful dreams of classical ballet. They faded simply because she grew too tall.\n\nPerhaps her parents always secretly wanted her to act, not dance. In August 1937, Laurence Olivier, playing Hamlet, interrupted his own curtain call with the news, \"Tonight a great actress was born. Laertes has a daughter.\" Laertes - Michael Redgrave - had met Rachel Kempson, Vanessa's mother, when they were playing a season of repertory in Liverpool. They married and moved to London to join Tyrone Guthrie at the Old Vic.\n\nMichael, after starring in The Lady Vanishes and The Stars Look Down, was voted the most popular film actor in England. The war, and stardom, kept him away from his family. But, says Vanessa, they \"accepted that was the way things were\". With Christmas and a reunion in prospect they \"wore out fingers and thumbs making presents - pipe holders and pen wipers\". Affection and admiration were indivisible.\n\nFifteen years after his death, Michael Redgrave is still a living influence on his daughter. Only last year she told Edward Fox that every time she re-read An Actor's Ways and Means, a collection of lectures given by her father at Bristol University, her acting improved. She still talks, with regret, about the films she missed and, with proud satisfaction, about the plays she saw. Asked about his performance in Antony and Cleopatra, at a time of physical illness and mental anguish, she obviously still feels the pain. Loss of memory, an early symptom of undiagnosed Parkinson's disease, was prejudicing his whole career. \"We were all on tenterhooks over this terrible thing about him not being able to learn his lines. He got on top of it. But all I remember is sitting there with knots in my stomach\".\n\nAnguish aside, it was a highly privileged childhood. \"One day my father came home and said, 'You're going to present a bouquet to Princess Elizabeth at the Royal Command Performance. And you are to have a lovely new dress'. Lovely dress! Yes, thank you. Anyway, I was quite awe-struck. I had collected pictures of the little princesses from my nanny's magazines\". Redgrave is careful to point out that she \"was not presented at court but went to friends' coming-out parties. Coming out had a different meaning in those days.\"\n\nRachel Kempson knew before her marriage that Michael Redgrave was bisexual. \"Of course\", she told her grown-up children, \"I thought I could change him.\" She was wrong. Her daughter now talks of her father's complicated emotional life with a relaxed frankness that makes nonsense of gossip-column theories about its discovery causing her own marital upheavals and excursions on to the wilder shores of politics. Their relationship is perfectly summed up by brother Corin, \"For Vanessa, he was much the most important influence on her life,\" and \"he worshipped her talent as if it had nothing to do with his own\".\n\nInevitably, the daughter of Michael Redgrave enjoyed opportunities denied to other young actresses. After the ballet classes, and a year or two at the exclusive Queensgate girls school in Lon don, she enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama. Her description of the three years that followed confirms her retrospective contempt for the tuition. \"I took my training very seriously. I was so ignorant about what sort of training existed abroad that I was just thrilled to be there. I was totally uncritical.\"\n\nShe won the Sybil Thorndike Prize and left to join the Frinton-on-Sea repertory company. The first part she remembers playing was Helena in Look Back In Anger. \"I felt totally unsuitable. Helena was calm, sophisticated and superior, and I was none of those things. I wanted to be poor put-upon Alison. But I got Helena.\"\n\nIt is hard to imagine Redgrave hoping to be type-cast as the woman John Osborne made Jimmy Porter call \"Lady Pusillanimous\". But if her confidence really needed a boost, it was provided by an invitation to play in N C Hunter's A Touch of the Sun. She volunteers, without embarrassment, that the offer came \"at the request\" of her father.\n\nThe action is set in the south of France. Vanessa recalls, \"I could feel I was there!\" That description is an explanation of her genius - the ability to become, rather than act, the parts she plays. It is a quality which Peter Hall describes as \"absolute veracity - the determination to hold nothing back\". In rehearsal she goes \"immediately into top gear. It enables her to ignite a scene\" and, combined with \"an extraordinary generosity on stage to other actors\", means that \"people who play with her are likely to play better, because of her presence\".\n\nIt was Hall who asked Redgrave to join the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford and play Rosalind in As You Like It. The woman in boy's clothing, walking through the Forest of Arden swinging her velvet cap as she confesses her love, became one of the defining images of the 60s. And Rosalind's reappearance, in a gleaming white dress - triumphantly a woman being a woman - was one of the great moments of 20th-century theatre. Peter Hall recalls how Jean Renoir reacted to the sudden magic. \"Like most directors, he was always reluctant to watch other people's work. But I persuaded him to stand at the back of the theatre for a minute or two. On came Vanessa and he asked with proper Gallic enthusiasm, 'Oo is that girl?' He stayed for the rest of the play.\"\n\nRenoir was not the only director to be entranced by Rosalind. Tony Richardson, who had rejected Vanessa for a part in his film of Look Back In Anger, fell in love with her when he saw her in As You Like It. They were married in 1962 and the birth, in quick succession, of Natasha and Joely, now themselves internationally successful successful actors, meant that for three years motherhood took precedence over stage and screen. But in 1966, she came back with a succession of bangs - The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie on stage, and five films, including Morgan - A Suitable Case for Treatment, Blow-Up, and Camelot.\n\nPerhaps she worked so hard that year because she was unhappy. Tony Richardson, after three years of marriage, had fallen in love with Jeanne Moreau. Despite all Redgrave's attempts to rescue the marriage, including abandoning a \"cultural exchange\" delegation on its way to Moscow in the hope of convincing him that he was the centre of her life, they parted in Rome. Art imitated life. Richardson was directing a film in which Moreau starred, while his wife had only a small part.\n\nBut, when Joshua Logan asked her to play Guinevere in Camelot, it was from her estranged husband that she sought advice. \"I was about to turn it down. But Tony said 'You'd be absolutely mad. If you do Camelot, everyone will want you to be in their films. If you don't, nobody will'. That's how it works. Because I did Camelot, I got offered almost everything that was going.\"\n\nTo many of her warmest admirers, Redgrave seemed an unlikely (singing) Guinevere. And there have been other films, from Murder On The Orient Express to Yanks, which critics thought unworthy of her classical talents. She gamely defends every one, but explains that she does them \"so that I can do theatre\", where it is \"quite impossible to make a living. I'm going to start a year's work at Shakespeare's Globe followed by the National Theatre. It will all but ruin me. Films, often made when I need a holiday, make it possible. I get £400 a week at the Globe and £600 a week at the National. If I just relied on that, I couldn't pay the mortgage.\"\n\nAnd, as if to prove her point, 36 hours after the end of her long run in Noel Coward's Song At Twilight, she flew off to Canada for a week's filming before she began rehearsals of The Tempest, only pausing to take a couple of Chechen politicians to a lunch with sympathetic dons in Oxford, Chechnya being her current cause.\n\nAn actress who has starred in so many films should not be short of money. But Eileen Atkins - perhaps Redgrave's closest friend and the woman she regards as \"probably the best actress in the world\" - says: \"She's given it all away. Swimming pools for schools. All sorts of things. She lives very humbly. Have you seen her flat? It's nothing very special. The films are what she lives on.\"\n\nRedgrave is not the woman to rest the justification of her dra matic decisions on anything as prosaic as the hope of fame and the need for money. If provoked, she will defend every film she made. \"I wanted to do Camelot because it was all about equality,\" adding, like the revelation of a new truth, \"they had a round table.\" Questions about King Arthur's status, and the life of the serfs outside the castle walls, do nothing to shake her theory about \"the one brief shining moment\". Her original theories about the parts she plays and the plays in which she performed have become the stuff of theatrical legend.\n\nAtkins has a fund of stories which illustrate the combination of absurdity and dramatic genius which marks the Redgrave approach to acting. \"In every new production she has about 50 original ideas: 49 are ludicrous and one is brilliant.\" During rehearsals for Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman at the National Theatre, \"she suddenly threw herself on the floor\". That was judged ridiculous. But then she started cutting in before Atkins had finished her lines. \"At first\", Atkins says \"I was irritated. Then we realised that it gave the whole scene the urgency which it lacked.\"\n\nRedgrave's ideas for improving Vita and Virginia - the letters of Mesdames Sackville-West and Wolfe, prepared for the stage by Atkins - were even more original. The problem of conveying the physical side of the characters' relationship \"without the unattractive sight of two middle-aged women kissing\" could, she told Atkins, be overcome by having two ropes hanging down on the stage, and the two lesbian lovers swinging out over the stalls to replicate their ecstasy. That was rejected. But her idea of conveying their constant partings by covering the furniture with sheets - an instantly recognisable image of desolation - \"added a new dimension\" to the show.\n\nPeter Hall recalls how, towards the end of rehearsals for Tennessee Williams's Orpheus Descending, Redgrave concluded that the spirit of the play could not be adequately conveyed by synthetic music and arrived one day carrying several mandolins. Hall resisted but, before the play transferred to Broadway, she began to take mandolin lessons in the hope of changing his mind. Hall believes that sensible directors rejoice in her obtrusive originality. \"A lot of actors hold back 10 or 20% at rehearsals. She's 100% all the time.\"\n\nThe willingness to risk rejection and perhaps even ridicule is, Atkins says, proof of Redgrave's \"supreme self-confidence. She is braver than most actors, braver in general, not just brave on the stage. That makes her absolutely spontaneous. She has no feeling of fear that she is going to make a fool of herself.\" Atkins attributes the courage and confidence to her privileged, if unconventional, background - great actors enjoying great public acclaim as they privately endured the stress of con stantly shifting liaisons. It may also be responsible for one of her most endearing qualities. Redgrave is, she says, \"transparently vulnerable\".\n\nPerhaps that is why there have been so many passionate but brief relationships in her life. When Tony Richardson left her she said she wept \"not because he loved Jeanne Moreau, but because he didn't love me any more\", a reflection of her father's view that the good life is not necessarily monogamous. Subsequently she loved (and left or lost) Franco Nero (Lancelot in Camelot and father of her son Carlo), Timothy Dalton (who was Antony to her Cleopatra and receives eternal gratitude for having taught her to fish) and, most recently, David Harewood (now a television star) who played in the Antony and Cleopatra which she directed for the Moving The atre Company. Antony and Cleopatra is the play in which she seems to find all the excitement and mystery of the stage. And she uses it again and again to illustrate her theories of drama in general and Shakespeare in particular.\n\nShe is didactic in a diffident sort of way. Over-modest about both her education and her intellect, she constantly emphasises what she has not read and does not understand. It is an endearing feature of her generally self-effacing off-stage character.\n\nAlthough she fills the stage, she has no wish to dominate a room and shows every sign of finding celebrity status tedious. But, reminded that she has spoken of \"the magic moment when you know what a play is about\", she is adamant (perhaps even vehement) that her performances match intuition and intellect. \"It's a synthesis. Always loads of work. Then the moment comes, because of the loads of work. It was like that with Antony and Cleopatra. Whenever I've played it, or directed it, we had to do masses of reading to get to grips with it.\"\n\nHer reading has reinforced the view that \"whoever Shakespeare was, he wasn't a little ordinary yeoman who headed back to Stratford after he had his fun\". Indeed, although she claims to be \"not really interested in 'what is called the controversy',\" she is sure that she knows who he was not.\n\n\"I'm quite certain that he was a quite exceptional aristocrat who had to keep totally quiet and needed Shakespeare as cover. It was a McCarthy-like period in England... Shakespeare wrote at a time of unprecedented tyranny and persecution... when he wrote 'alas England' the lines really came from thought and experience.\"\n\nAsked why she was so sure that the tortured soul who so often disguised his dissidence by basing his histories on texts which supported the Tudors's legitimacy, was an aristocrat rather than a commoner, she says: \"Simply because there were a number of aristocrats... it may have been Southampton... Or that other guy... A working man would not have had time... All the aristocrats, even the butchers, were extraordinarily well read and educated.\"\n\nWhatever her reasons for rejecting the contemporary evidence that Shakespeare came from humble origins, she has no doubts about the capabilities of the common man. Her political commitment is entirely genuine, if not altogether consistent: at the height of her revolutionary passion, she sent her daughter Natasha to St Paul's (public) school.\n\nBut her constant support for radical causes is unrelated to a desire for either publicity or popularity. In 1964, pregnant with her first baby, she sang at the Wembley rally that launched Labour's general election campaign and then canvassed door to door in London's Barons Court constituency. All her campaigns turn into crusades. Her causes are always righteous and her beliefs invariably absolute.\n\nThe Labour Party of the 60s and 70s, led by the determinedly pragmatic Harold Wilson, was never her natural political home. Nor was the Workers Revolutionary Party. For its intellectually violent approach to politics was at odds with her essentially gentle (if occasionally hyper-active) view of life. But in politics, as in the theatre, the woman whose dramatic genius is the product of instinct and emotion, always wanted to believe that what she achieved was the result of careful study.\n\nCorin, who had, for a time, been the full-time \"Yorkshire Organiser\" of the WRP, was able to answer all her questions about what causes the miseries of the world. \"I never met anybody else who could make a serious attempt to analyse and explain, from a historical point of view, contemporary events,\" she says. She was, \"drinking at the time and at a bit of a dead end\". But even now, recovered in every way and loosely attached to something called the Marxist Party, she remains touchingly loyal to her old comrades. The WRP collapsed in a flurry of allegations about Gerry Healey, its leader, who was expelled in 1985 for allegedly exploiting (indeed abusing) young female recruits. Redgrave is \"certain that the scandal was a put-up job\".\n\nIt is her outright refusal even to acknowledge either the absurdity or the iniquity of the political extremists with whom she has been involved which made Peter Hall say that \"In life, which is true, she is false. In art, which is fake, she is true.\" That strange paradox is illustrated by her insistence that the British troops (sent into Derry in 1969 at the pleading of Bernadette Devlin) were dispatched to oppress the Republicans.\n\nRedgrave now says that her ideas of revolutionary politics (which have certainly softened with the years) were crystallised in her mind by the difficulty she found in persuading anyone to help in the defence of Dolores Price, the young Irish Nationalist, when she was charged with terrorist crime. Price was jailed for life in 1973 for her part in three London bombings which injured hundreds.\n\nThere seems to be a filter in Redgrave's brain which holds back facts inconvenient to her view of life, or at least allows her to interpret them in a way which confirms her prejudices. Cato Street, Robert Shaw's play about an early 19th century wrongful conviction, led her to suspect that Price and her associates had probably been framed.\n\nMore often than not she has avoided a collision between acting and politics, though Edward Fox says: \"All that business with Equity (the actors' trade union, which she tried to politicise) cannot have helped her career.\" And her acceptance speech, after she won her Oscar for the supporting role in Julia, included a recklessly heroic attack on the \"Zionist hoodlums\" who had campaigned against her because she had defended the Palestinian Arabs. No one doubts that that outburst prejudiced her prospects in Hollywood.\n\n\"Had it not been for that,\" says a close associate who refuses to be named, \"she might have become the biggest star of her time, as well as the greatest actress. As it is, her films have too often been character parts.\" Even her sister, Lynn Redgrave, grew briefly impatient with Vanessa's political reputation which, in the strange world of movie-making, rubbed off on her. But their reconciliation is complete. At the party in March to celebrate the Redgrave Archives' acquisition by the Theatre Museum, she was loud in her praise of both Vanessa's energy and acting.\n\nOccasionally, Vanessa Redgrave's political commitment has entirely creative consequences. Mark Rylance's idea that she should play Prospero is, at least in part, the result of his admiration for one of her qualities \"which impel her to rally for every cause which she believes defends the exploited and the oppressed - her strong sense of justice. Prospero is a man with immense power who is moved to mercy. Vanessa understands that.\"\n\nRylance, it must be said, is as great an admirer of her dramatic technique as of her moral values. When he saw her in Noel Coward's Song At Twilight - her most recent West End appearance - he thought her so believable as Carlotta, the outraged ex-lover of an elderly, literary titan, that he thought \"she might walk off stage at any minute\". And that, he said, is typical of a style which reflects her personality. \"She is always on the edge.\"\n\nSheridan Morley, who directed Song At Twilight, knows exactly what Rylance meant. Because he was Coward's literary executor, with a duty to do his best for both the author's reputation and his posthumous earnings, Morley wondered if, when the play transferred from the King's Head in Islington to the Gielgud in the West End, he should hand over to a director of greater experience. In the end, he accepted the advice that Redgrave is either undirectable or in no need of direction - \"she does something different every night\". Morley regarded his role as \"clearing a flight path so she could land in whatever way she chose\".\n\nHe describes her as \"fearless\". Rylance speaks of her \"courage and absolute absence of self-consciousness\". And he regards her \"instant agreement to play Prospero at the Globe on a strange stage to a constantly visible audience\" as confirmation of her reckless daring. But he added \"innocence\" to his list of virtues - the best explanation possible for the often strange and sometimes troubling political causes which she has defended.\n\nSpeculating about the roots of her extraordinary talent he referred to her as \"driven\"; then as \"being on the run\"; then as \"propelled\", adding that he did not know whether \"it is something behind her or something in front that keeps her dashing on\".\n\nMorley believes that personal history and political conviction often combine to give her an extra dimension. The second act speech in Song At Twilight - a celebrated but secret homosexual describing the trauma of constant deception - was, he believed, one of the reasons that she agreed to take over from Nyree Dawn Porter when the play moved to the West End.\n\nPerhaps Redgrave's genius can only be described in intangible generalities - veracity, sincerity, truth, courage - qualities which, by general consent, will keep her working into old age, \"two actresses in one\" as Morley describes her, \"Rosalind to the middle aged, and Stephen Fry's mother in Wilde to the young\".\n\nHe regards the longevity as the final proof of her greatness. \"Evening Standard drama awards in four consecutive decades: 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. No one else has done that.\" But she is an extraordinary human being as well as a great actress: committed, compassionate and slightly crazy. The ballet's loss is the world's gain.\n\nLife at a glance: Vanessa Redgrave\n\nBorn: January 30 1937.\n\nEducated: Queensgate School, London; Central School of Speech and Drama, London.\n\nMarried: 1962 Tony Richardson (two daughters, Natasha and Joely), marriage dissolved 1967.\n\nCareer (some plays): Frinton Summer Repertory 1958 Touch Of The Sun, 1959 A Midsummer Night's Dream,1960 Lady From The Sea; Royal Shakespeare Theatre Company 1961 As You Like It, 1964 The Seagull, 1966 The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie, 1973 Antony And Cleopatra, 1984 The Aspern Papers, 1986 Ghosts, 1990 Three Sis ters,1992 Heartbreak House, 1996 John Gabriel Borkman.\n\nSome films: 1966 Morgan - A Suitable Case For Treatment, 1967 Blow-Up, 1967 Camelot, 1972 Mary, Queen Of Scots, 1976 Julia, 1985 Wetherby, 1992 Howards End.\n\nAwards: 1977 Best supporting actress Oscar for Julia."
