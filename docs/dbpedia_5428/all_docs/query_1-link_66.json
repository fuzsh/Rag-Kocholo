The only problem I saw in his performance in LTD is that he seemed uncomfortable saying the one-liners in the screenplay. But that problem was taken care of in Licence To Kill. Ah, Licence To Kill! I loved the bar fight scene, was so happy that this was the Bond movie that Desmond Llewellyn got the most screen time as Q in the entire series, thought Carey Lowell was great, hated Talisa Soto (I really liked the red dress she wore in the casino scene, however), felt that Benicio del Torro and Robert Davi were good villians, and Wayne Newton was strange but funny.\n\nAs for Timothy Dalton' s non-Bond films, my favorites are The Rocketeer, Wuthering Hights, and Jane Eyre (I know that it's a BBC series and not a movie, but just roll with the punches, okay?).\n\nI love, love, LOVE Timothy Dalton!

I haven t seen this in about 40 years, so I hope it is as good as I remember. Dalton isn t a huge part of it, but this was the first I saw of him, and I kept thinking he would be an excellent James Bond.\n\nI remember the book, it was huge and vaguely remember the miniseries. Had no idea Dalton was in it either. In that photo, he looks like I picture he'd be if he was Bond for OHMSS or in the early '70s."
