        "text": "Acting legends Vanessa Redgrave (Isadora, Julia) and Glenda Jackson (Women in Love, The Maids) star in this sweeping portrait of two of the world’s most fascinating leaders, Mary, Queen of Scots and Queen Elizabeth I of England. Redgrave earned an Academy Award nomination for her stunning portrayal of Mary, who returns to her troubled homeland following the death of her husband, the King of France. From the moment Mary reclaims her throne, Elizabeth (Jackson) seeks to oust her, fearful that Mary will one day have a son who will ultimately rule both countries. Aided by Mary’s deceitful brother (Patrick McGoohan, Ice Station Zebra), Elizabeth schemes to arrange an ill-fated marriage between Scotland’s queen and a vain nobleman (Timothy Dalton, The Lion in Winter) with allegiance to Tudor England. Mary and Elizabeth’s undaunted quests for power leave a trail of deception, murder and holy war. Directed by Charles Jarrott (Anne of the Thousand Days) and co-starring Nigel Davenport (Play Dirty), Trevor Howard (Outcast of the Islands), Daniel Massey (Star!), Ian Holm (Alien) and Andrew Keir (Quatermass and the Pit), Mary, Queen of Scots was nominated for 5 Academy Awards, including Art Direction-Set Decoration, Costume Design and Score (by the great John Barry, The Ipcress File).\n\nPress & Exhibitors\n\nBelow please find additional information and promotional materials for this film.
