        "text": "Quartet Records, Universal Pictures, Geffen Records and Universal Music Enterprises present an expanded and remastered edition of a timeless John Barry classic score for a 1971 Universal film, MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS, directed by Charles Jarrot and starring Vanessa Redgrave, Glenda Jackson, Patrick MacGoohan, Timothy Dalton and Trevor Howard.\n\nDignified and regal, romantic and bittersweet, John Barry’s music for MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS evokes the period, enhances the atmosphere and underlines the emotions. It is one of Barry’s undisputed masterpieces and was Oscar-nominated for Best Original Score in 1971.\n\nDecca Records issued an album coinciding with the film’s release, beautifully produced by the composer. But while the album contained most of the score’s highlights, it ran just 28 minutes, or a little more than half of what Barry had recorded at London’s CTS studio. This CD marks the first release of the entire score, thanks to the recent discovery of previously unknown tape rolls in the Universal vaults. We have included the remastered original Decca album in stereo and the score presentation in mono, as it has survived.\n\nThis collection has been produced by Neil S. Bulk and Mike Matessino, and mastered by Chris Malone. The package includes a 20-page booklet with an in-depth essay by film music historian and John Barry authority Jon Burlingame."
