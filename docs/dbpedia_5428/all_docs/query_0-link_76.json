        "text": "A heartbreaking, true story.\n\nJoan Didion wrote a memoir about her double-loss – first her husband and then her daughter. This is her one woman play based on that memoir. Vanessa Redgrave plays Joan.\n\nWe found it moving, although the critics tended to be equivocal in their praise and in their sense that the production moves as much as it should:\n\nPaul Taylor in the Independent wasn’t sure about it – click here;\n\nSusannah Clapp in the Observer found the piece problematic but is more positive about it – click here;\n\nMichael Billington in the Guardian suggests that the Lyttelton is the wrong place for a one woman show – I agree – click here.\n\nThe audience went a bit Vanessa-sycophantic at the end, which always tends to irritate us a bit, but then she is one heck of an actress.\n\nThis was a great production of great play. Paul Scofield as the big man, Vanessa Redgrave as the long-suffering wife, Eileen Atkins, Michael Bryant, a great supporting cast, Richard Eyre directing, what was not to like?\n\nHere is a link to the Theatricalia entry for this production.\n\nJanie doesn’t tend to like “classics” but tends to makes an exception for Ibsen. This production was no exception to her exception.\n\nAs is often the case, the Lyttleton did the play no favours, too big and set back for intimacy yet not quite big enough or shaped right to be the big stage. But when the only criticism one can muster is that, the fact is that this was a great night at the theatre and I am so glad we saw this production.\n\nPaul Taylor in the Independent loved it – click here.\n\nHere’s another little review archive link – click here.\n\nMichael Billington in the Guardian waxed lyrical about it:\n\nBillington on Borkman Sat, Jul 13, 1996 – 30 · The Guardian (London, Greater London, England) · Newspapers.com\n\nBut in truth, you had to be there. One of the more memorable evenings at the theatre.\n\nObviously I was better from my 48 hours of food poisoning by the Saturday. I’m pretty sure I went in to work on the Friday and then a full weekend of activities.\n\nNow I have had written complaints from Jilly already about my handwriting, so the above page is only for artistic effect. Here is the entry for the Saturday:\n\nSaturday 10 December: Driving lesson & Orpheus Descending With Jilly & Annalisa Party\n\nThere – that wasn’t so challenging, now, was it?\n\nI remember really liking this play and production. What a fabulous cast.\n\nThe Theatricalia website lists the production thus.\n\nNote that we saw this production three days before the stated first performance, so Jilly and I must have gone to see a preview.\n\nBelow is Michael Billington’s Guardian review:\n\nBillington on Orpheus Thu, Dec 15, 1988 – 28 · The Guardian (London, Greater London, England) · Newspapers.com\n\nBelow is Kate Kellaway’s Observer review\n\nKate Kellaway on Orpheus Sun, Dec 18, 1988 – 40 · The Observer (London, Greater London, England) · Newspapers.com\n\nThey made a film based on that Peter Hall production with some (but not all) of the cast we saw in it. Here is the trailer for that movie – far more melodramatic looking than the stage production I remember, but still it should give you some idea:\n\nFor that particular evening, I’m sure that the original idea was that Bobbie would join me to see this play/production. But when she had to pull out for some reason, it made a great deal of sense for Jilly to act as sub, especially as we were both invited to Annalisa’s party and were given leave to be fashionably late arrivals.\n\nIn truth, I cannot remember specific details of this particular party at Annalisa’s place in Hinde Street, but her parties were always popular, always lavish in hospitality and always late nighters. At that time, just a couple of years after Annalisa had finished at Keele, I suspect it was a very Keeley crowd that night.\n\nAs the diary says, on the Sunday, I:\n\n…went to G Jenny with Ma & Pa…\n\n…the next day, quite probably a little tiredly and sore-headedly. But Grandma Jenny no doubt wanted to know all about my new flat and my new job, so I’ll guess that I was centre of attention that Sunday afternoon.\n\nNot one of Eugene O’Neill’s greatest plays, but my log suggests that Bobbie and I both found this production very good…\n\n…and why shouldn’t we. Vanessa Redgrave & Timothy Dalton, with support from Amanda Boxer, Malcolm Tierney and several other good names. David Thacker directed it.\n\nHere is the Theatricalia entry for this production.\n\nThis was, in fact, a West End transfer of a much-lauded Young Vic production; the UK premier of this play. Bobbie and I couldn’t get in at the Young Vic but got in early during the transfer, so saw the original Young Vic cast/production.\n\nHere is the Wikipedia entry on this lesser-known O’Neill play.\n\nA rarity for a production of this antiquity, I have managed to find a review by Frederick Wilkins in The Eugene O’Neill Newsletter – dated Spring 1988 – which reviews the Young Vic production at both of its locations.\n\n(Just in case anything ever happens to that Newsletter, I have scraped that fascinating review to here)\n\nMichael Ratcliffe’s review is clipped below:\n\nMichael Ratcliffe On Cat Sun, Feb 7, 1988 – 26 · The Observer (London, Greater London, England) · Newspapers.com\n\nMichael Billington admired the piece thus:\n\nBillington on Poet Thu, Feb 4, 1988 – 14 · The Guardian (London, Greater London, England) · Newspapers.com\n\nI wonder what Bobbie remembers of that production and that evening?\n\nPostscript: a couple of days before I got to this piece, to add the clips, in January 2020, I ran into Vanessa in Speck. Small world."
