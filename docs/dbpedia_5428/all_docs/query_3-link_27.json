        "text": "If there is a single point at which Vanessa Redgrave can be said to have been definitively prevented from becoming the world’s greatest living actress, it would be the night of April 3 1978, at the 50th Academy Awards in Los Angeles. Bounding up to the stage in a tent-like black velvet dress, Redgrave was handed the Best Supporting Actress Oscar – for her role as the anti-Nazi heroine in Julia – by John Travolta, and then took the microphone.\n\nShe was already a controversial choice for the award. An advocate for the cause of the Palestinians, Redgrave had recently produced and appeared in a documentary about Palestine, and the release of the film in the United States had been marked by protests by Jewish groups, including a firebombing of one cinema, and pickets at which the actress was burned in effigy. As she prepared to give her speech, sharpshooters were stationed on the roof of the theatre to guard against attempts on her life.\n\nIt’s clear now that she was referring to the extremists of the Jewish Defense League who had offered a bounty to have her killed. Yet in the context of her support for the PLO, this was a spectacularly ill-chosen phrase, one that made it possible for Redgrave’s detractors to imply that she meant the whole state of Israel, and thus damn her as an anti-Semite for years to come. Its immediate effect was to make her all but unemployable in Hollywood. She had not so much snatched defeat from the jaws of victory as recklessly smashed victory’s teeth in with a hammer.\n\nYet these were not words blurted out in haste: she had prepared her speech in advance, and even written it down: “The basic line,” she tells me one winter morning in Manhattan. “Just in case I won, I thought I’d better.” And even with more than 30 years’ hindsight, and while recognising the harm she did to her own career, Redgrave says she still doesn’t regret anything she said. “You do what you feel is right. People get it or they don’t. I did what I thought was right – and whether that would have any effect on my career or not was quite beside the point.” Found today on YouTube, the speech lasts just 45 seconds. “Gosh, that’s not very long, is it? So I didn’t overrun my time,” she says brightly, apparently genuinely pleased that, whatever damage she may have inflicted on herself, she was not so unprofessional as to derail an otherwise smooth-running stage production.\n\nAt 75, her once-imposing 6ft frame hunched with age, Vanessa Redgrave remains as steely and opinionated as ever. Her relationship with the press may now be less proscribed by rules and caveats than it once was – she used to insist that she would discuss either politics or acting, but not both at once, and never her personal life – but she still approaches interviews with suspicion. “Because I’m an actress, and because of all my experience, I think I’m quite a good bull---- detector,” she tells me eventually. “I can be very wrong, but if I pick up on what I think – perhaps mistakenly – is some bull---- going on, I get pretty relentless – rather sharp.” She is not especially easy to talk to: she often speaks in sentences of Victorian length and complexity, filled with qualification, footnotes and subclauses, and turns over questions with the painstaking caution of a bomb disposal expert. And although she’s warm, the threat of a peremptory knuckle-rapping is never far away.\n\nBut the woman I first meet on the pavement outside a Manhattan photo studio – she has stolen downstairs for an additive-free cigarette – is certainly a gentler version of the actress-radical who twice stood as a parliamentary candidate for the Trotskyite Workers Revolutionary Party. As recently as 1994 – in an autobiography whose index lists “Hoskins, Bob” between “Honecker, Erich” and “House Un-American Activities Commission” – Redgrave wrote: “I remain absolutely convinced of the necessity of Marxism, and that not for a single day has this conviction been shaken.” But since the late nineties she’s been voting Liberal Democrat, and regards herself more as an advocate for human rights. The causes for which she has struggled – banning the bomb, getting out of Vietnam, opposing the first Gulf War, supporting Chechen separatists, including Akhmed Zakayev, recently revealed to be the target of an assassination plot – have gradually become more personal and closer to home. Recently she advocated for the Dale Farm travellers; she’s now campaigning to stop the demolition of a cinema near where she lives in Chiswick. And since the death of her older daughter, Natasha Richardson, three years ago, after a skiing accident in Canada, wherever she goes Redgrave has carried a postcard sent to her at the time by a friend. It’s an image from an illuminated manuscript of the fourth or fifth century held in the British Museum, showing two figures separated by a river. One, a man, is wearing a long red gown; the figure of the other, a woman, is depicted only in outline. “It’s about a man whose wife has died – she’s on the other side of the river,” Redgrave says. She explains that the image reminds her of how her world has changed since her daughter died. “What people say reverberates differently. Everything that happens, there’s a different sound, a different look. One sees with more perception. One considers more. One doesn’t feel impelled to rush precipitously.”\n\nSo she’s a very different person from the one she was? “I don’t know if I’m very different,” she says. “But I see everything differently.” She’s bought a lot of copies of that postcard lately. “I send them to people I’m very, very fond of.” Acting has, famously, been in the Redgrave family for more than a century: four generations, with a fifth on its way. Vanessa’s grandfather Roy— “the dramatic cock o’ the North” – skipped out on his wife and three children to find fame in the Australian silent film industry in 1908, when their younger son, Michael, was just six months old; Laurence Olivier declared that Vanessa, Michael’s eldest daughter, would be a great actress on the night she was born in 1937, from the stage in The Old Vic, where the two men were appearing in Hamlet together. When she was five, Michael took Vanessa backstage before his appearance in the melodrama The Duke in Darkness to show her the set – a castle – and the mattress that lay at the foot of the battlements, “so that I wouldn’t scream, or anything like that,” when she saw her father being thrown over the parapet at the play’s climax. The next play she saw was when her father appeared as Macbeth. “I fidgeted a lot,” she says.\n\nThat may have been the last time she failed to regard acting with anything but the utmost seriousness. Since giving up her early desire to be a dancer – she trained with the Ballet Rambert as a teenager but became too tall to make it as a professional – she has given herself entirely to almost every role she has taken. Redgrave has been nominated for six Oscars, and credited in more than 100 films, and although these appearances may be brief – as the enigmatic woman at the centre of Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow Up, or the age-ravaged Briony at the end of Atonement – they’re frequently powerful enough to tilt an entire movie on its axis.\n\nNevertheless, it’s been suggested that Redgrave tried to discourage her daughters from becoming actors. “Be anything but that,” Joely Richardson is reported to have quoted her mother as saying. Redgrave says she never did any such thing: So she didn’t discourage them? “I have absolutely no memory of that whatsoever. Actually I meant to check this out with Joely because we’re both always, or frequently, texting each other, saying, ‘Listen, it says in such and such that I said this. I didn’t. What I actually said was this. I’m so sorry’.” She’s been misquoted? “She to me or me to her. We care very much about each others’ feelings.”\n\nRedgrave’s commitment to radical politics not only burned her film career, depriving her of mainstream roles for long after the Oscar controversy, but also had a more personal cost. As a six year-old, Natasha begged her mother to stop travelling around the globe in support of political causes to spend more time at home, only to be told that this was a sacrifice she should be prepared to make for the benefit of all children of her generation, for the future. “But I need you now,” Natasha replied. “I won’t need you so much then.”\n\nIn order to finance the making of her documentary about the Palestinians, Redgrave sold the house she shared with her children – three, by then, including Natasha and her younger sister Joely, from Redgrave’s marriage to director Tony Richardson, and Carlo, her son with Italian actor Franco Nero. After leaving him at the beginning of the 1970s, she embarked on a long relationship with Timothy Dalton, who instilled in her a lasting love of fly fishing. One often-repeated story about their breakup is that it was provoked by her choice to spend one Sunday afternoon on a picket line rather than with him. She refuses to discuss whether there is any truth in this. “It happened a long way away – Tim Dalton is a good, good, good, friend of the family as well as of me. I don’t want to go up and down the bank looking out for people who said things all those years ago.”\n\nFive years ago Redgrave finally married Franco Nero, shortly before her 70th birthday, and more than 40 years after they had first met, on the Burbank set of Camelot in 1965. Even then the ceremony was an entirely unofficial affair: “We did it the best way possible, in my view. Which is that you don’t enter into a legal agreement, which I think spells trouble.” She says she rarely watches her own movies these days. But Camelot is an exception.\n\nYet Redgrave’s impassioned pursuit of the things she believes in has not always been as rigidly doctrinaire as it has been portrayed. Even before she had bought an Edwardian mansion in the Peak District to house a Trotskyite “School for Revolutionaries” in the mid-Seventies, Redgrave had donated her biggest paycheck of the period – from her title role in Mary, Queen of Scots in 1971 – to build a new nursery school, near her home in west London, which she gave to the state and remains open today. “In spite of the cutbacks,” she says, “to which I’m mightily opposed.”\n\nToday, Redgrave lives in a two-bedroom flat that, she says, remains “mortgaged up to the hilt” – a result of giving much of her money away over the years to both political and creative causes. One of the most expensive of these was the Moving Theatre Company, which she launched with her brother Corin in 1995— a typically quixotic venture that included staging an entire season of plays to mark 50 years since the end of fascism. The company proved a financial bloodbath. “We didn’t get even half-full houses most of the time,” Redgrave says. Even now, she worries about money. “Oh golly – I don’t know anyone who doesn’t, who’s in sort of my situation, you know.”\n\nIn contrast to her longstanding public image, Redgrave’s stage work has been defined by what her close friend, the actress Eileen Atkins, once described as her “transparent vulnerability”. Unafraid to make a fool of herself, Redgrave’s confidence in the righteousness of her beliefs also ensures that she contributes dozens of dramatic suggestions to the productions she’s involved in – regardless of how outlandish they may seem. “In every new production she has about 50 original ideas,” Atkins once said. “Forty-nine are ludicrous and one is brilliant.” Redgrave says that the preparation for her appearance in the one-woman show based on Joan Didion’s The Year of Magical Thinking was the most demanding of her career. Despite Didion being close friends with Redgrave’s ex-husband Tony Richardson for many years, and their daughters spending summers together in France, the two women had never met before they began work on the play. “She was totally part of the Richardson family life, and although I was a Richardson and remained to some extent a Richardson, that wasn’t my life,” Redgrave says. The play was an hour and a half of monologue – the actress alone onstage, channelling the anguish of a woman mourning the sudden death of her husband, and then her daughter. The Broadway and West End runs of the production had both concluded by the time Natasha died in March 2009, but Redgrave had already committed to one last performance, a benefit staged at the cathedral of St John the Divine in New York, just a month later.\n\n“Everybody said to me, ‘You don’t have to do it, you know.’ But I felt that at some point I did have to do it and that it would be, in its own way, one of my little homages to Tash.” She postponed the show, and went ahead with it in October – “which seems rather odd to me now, because the distance between April and October isn’t very huge”. When she had first performed the play, Redgrave thought she’d understood it as well as she could; playing the role after her daughter’s death, she realised she hadn’t understood anything about it at all. “I wouldn’t do it again,” she said.\n\nLast November, while she was starring in the West End stage production of Driving Miss Daisy opposite James Earl Jones, Redgrave was the subject of a tribute staged in London by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Thirty-three years after they had awarded her the best supporting actress Oscar for Julia, it was the first time the Academy had ever mounted such an event for an actor in Europe. David Hare, who had directed her in The Year of Magical Thinking, presented a series of clips from her films. “There are not many consistently brilliant 50-year careers in the history of cinema, but hers is one of them,” he said.\n\nWhen I ask Redgrave what she noticed about the way her performances changed as she got older, she allows herself a dry cackle. “Well, that I got older,” she says. Sitting there in the audience, for a few minutes she felt as if she wasn’t there at all: “I thought I must be dead, and somehow present at a memorial.” These days, she says she no longer makes any distinction between political work and acting. “At the present time, it’s probably better if I concentrate on how – within some artistic event – to highlight or give a focus in a human rights question.” Next month, she will be guest directing this year’s Brighton Festival, where she’s directing and narrating a one-off performance based on A World I Loved, a memoir by Wadad Makdisi Cortas, who grew up in Lebanon during the creation of Israel – “the whole idea of this year’s festival being how the arts, in all kinds of different ways, can help resolve conflicts, of whatever kind they may be.”\n\nWhen we meet, Redgrave is in New York to visit two of her grandchildren – the boys Natasha had with Liam Neeson – and says she’s trying to find the time to write. She’s working on a new book, but won’t say what it’s about. “I’m not going to tell you,” she says in a creakily coquettish voice. “Because it might not even work out. It’s non-fiction. Yes — I couldn’t possibly write fiction.” But after her work in Brighton, she says she has no idea where her next acting performance might be. “I’m not sure. It’s the first time I find myself planning a year ahead. It’s funny – it’s kind of super, in a way.” There will be more time with her family, much of which will be spent in the kitchen. And there’s a part in a play by South African dramatist Athol Fugard coming up."
