        "text": "The Redgrave and Richardson names are synonymous with the entertainment industry, and the family is among a very short list of so-called 'acting dynasties'.\n\nSir Michael Redgrave, Dame Vanessa Redgrave, Lynn Redgrave, Natasha Richardson, Joely Richardson and newcomers, Micheál Richardson and Daisy Bevan, are all part of the famed family of British thespians, which includes Irish actor Liam Neeson by marriage.\n\nSo how did the Redgrave-Richardson family become so prominent in showbusiness? It all began with the little-known actor Roy Redgrave.\n\nREAD MORE: How Liam Neeson keeps wife Natasha Richardson's memory alive\n\nRoy Redgrave\n\nRoy Redgrave is considered the first member of the acting dynasty.\n\nAn English stage and silent film actor, George Ellsworthy Redgrave was born on April 26, 1873, in South London.\n\nHe married actress Ellen Maud Pratt in 1894. It is not known when he started acting but six years later, the two had their stage debut in a play at the Britannia Theatre in April 1900.\n\nThe couple had three children in quick succession, but that didn't stop Redgrave from falling in love with a young actress named Esther Mary Cooke (known as Ettie Carlisle).\n\nAfter she married someone else, he followed her to South Africa before the pair ran off together.\n\nREAD MORE: Warring Gallagher brothers haven't spoken in 15 years\n\nThey arrived in Australia, where records show Redgrave listed as a supporting actor in the play Sunday, which ran at Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney in 1904.\n\nIn 1906, Redgrave and Cooke had a son together, Victor, before Redgrave's wife pursued him to Australia and pleaded with him to return home, to no avail.\n\nHe eventually returned to Britain, where he appeared on stage at the Grand Theatre, in Brighton, England. There he met actress Margaret Scudamore.\n\nThey married in Glasgow in 1907, and the following year, they had a son, Michael Redgrave.\n\nJust six months later, he left his new wife and son behind and returned to Australia, this time permanently.\n\nThe most famous and influential Hollywood families\n\nHe appeared on stage at Melbourne's King's Theatre in 1909. The following year he toured Australia in a play before returning to the Melbourne stage and later, the burgeoning film industry. He appeared in several silent films from 1911 to 1920, including Robbery Under Arms.\n\nFor years, his famous family didn't know what happened to him after that. His actress granddaughter Lynn Redgrave finally unravelled the mystery decades later.\n\nIn 1979, she travelled to Australia with husband John Clark to trace her grandfather.\n\nThe search led them to Sydney Opera House library, where they found an obituary, which had been printed in The Sydney Morning Herald, stating he had died on May 25, 1922, aged 49.\n\nAfter learning he was buried in an unmarked grave in South Head Cemetery, Vaucluse, she found the spot and arranged for a headstone to be erected.\n\nShe wrote about the events in a 2009 article for Oprah.com.\n\n\"I found my paternal grandfather's grave on the top of a hill in Australia, unmarked, but with documented evidence that he had been there since his death in 1922,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I contacted a stonemason and brought the news back to my dad, the great actor Michael Redgrave. He had never known where his father Roy was buried. 'What shall we put after his name?' I asked. 'Actor,' he said.\"\n\nSir Michael Redgrave\n\nMichael Redgrave was born in Bristol, England, on March 20, 1908,\n\nAfter his father returned to Australia, his mother continued to act in theatre and films, and later remarried.\n\nAfter school, Redgrave attended college in Cambridge, where he began acting in college plays.\n\nAfter graduation, he taught modern languages at a Surrey school for three years, where he gave himself starring roles in the school plays he also directed.\n\nIn 1934, he made his professional acting debut on stage in Liverpool, England.\n\nHe remained with the Liverpool Repertory Company for two years, where he met Rachel Kempson. The two married in 1935.\n\nHe made his London stage debut in 1936 in Love's Labour's Lost. In 1937, he appeared on TV for the first time.\n\nHis first major film role followed in 1938 when he appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes.\n\nHis first US film, Mourning Becomes Electra, earned him a 1948 Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.\n\nAll the celebs you might not have realised are nepo babies\n\nOver the next three decades, he starred in numerous films, TV shows and plays, including with the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre company.\n\nRedgrave and Kempson had three children; Vanessa born in 1937; Corin, born in 1939; and Lynn, born in 1943, all of whom became actors.\n\nDespite having a string of affairs with both men and women, Redgrave and Kempson were married 50 years until his death in 1985. He was 77.\n\nDame Vanessa Redgrave\n\nVanessa Redgrave was born on January 30, 1937, in London.\n\nRenowned actor Laurence Olivier, who at the time was starring alongside her father in Hamlet, reportedly announced her birth to the audience, saying, \"A great actress has been born this night.\"\n\nAfter finishing school, Redgrave entered the Central School of Speech and Drama in 1954.\n\nShe first appeared on stage opposite her brother in London's West End in 1958. The next year she appeared in the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre production of A Midsummer Night's Dream opposite Laurence Olivier in the title role.\n\nHer first starring role came in the 1960 play, The Tiger and the Horse, opposite her father.\n\nIn 1962, Redgrave married film and theatre director Tony Richardson. The couple had two daughters who both went on to become actors; Natasha Richardson, who was born in 1963, and Joely Richardson, who was born in 1965.\n\nIn 1966, she starred in the film Morgan – A Suitable Case for Treatment, which won her a Cannes Film Festival award and Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations.\n\nShe received Oscar nominations followed for her roles in the 1968 film, Isadora, and Mary, Queen of Scots (1971), before winning Best Supporting Actress Oscar for the role in the 1977 film, Julia.\n\nShe starred in a host of stage, film and TV productions, and received more Oscar nominations for her roles in The Bostonians (1984) and Howards End (1992).\n\nAfter she and Richardson broke up, Redgrave and Italian actor Franco Nero, had a son, Carlo Nero, an Italian screenwriter and film director, born in 1969.\n\nShe was in a relationship with actor Timothy Dalton from 1971 to 1986, before reuniting with Nero, whom she married in 2006.\n\nIn 2009, Redgrave's eldest daughter, Natasha, died following a skiing accident. Her two younger siblings, Corin and Lynn, died just one month apart in 2019.\n\nRedgrave, now 87, is the grandmother of actor Micheál Richardson, Natasha's eldest child with actor Liam Neeson, and actress Daisy Bevan, who is Joely Richardson's only child with former husband Tim Bevan.\n\nLynn Redgrave\n\nLynn Redgrave was born on March 8, 1943, in London.\n\nShe trained at Central School of Speech and Drama, before making her professional debut in a 1962 production of A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Royal Court Theatre.\n\nAfter appearing in London's West End, she joined the National Theatre for its inaugural season at the Old Vic, working with directors including Laurence Olivier and Noel Coward.\n\nAround this time she began appearing in films, including the 1966 movie Georgy Girl, opposite her mother, which saw her win a New York Film Critics Award, and Golden Globe and Oscar nominations.\n\nIn 1967, she made her Broadway debut, and for the next two decades, she acted in a string of theatre productions, TV shows and films.\n\nShe appeared opposite Vanessa a number of times on stage and screen.\n\nIn 1983, she starred as Cleopatra in the US TV show Antony and Cleopatra opposite Timothy Dalton — who at the time was her sister's boyfriend.\n\nRedgrave wrote the one-woman play, Shakespeare for My Father, about her childhood and relationship with her largely absent dad. It ran on Broadway from 1991-93 and received a Tony Award nomination.\n\nRedgrave married actor John Clark in 1967 and they had three children but their marriage was dissolved in 2000 after it was revealed he had fathered a child with her assistant.\n\nRedgrave was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002 and underwent treatment, but later relapsed. She died at her home in the US on May 2, 2010. She was 67.\n\nShe is buried in St Peter's Episcopal Cemetery in New York alongside her mother and niece Natasha Richardson."
