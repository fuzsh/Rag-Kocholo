        "text": "Shardlake wrote:\n\nI like Dalton I really do, I was one of those mourning his loss after seeing GE but for me personally just after witnessing Skyfall Craig takes Bond to a level that Tim didn't, his confidence in the role is now so recognisable.\n\nHe manages the quips to a degree that he's equalling Connery for me, he also in Skyfall is presenting to me a Bond with so much more depth, he presents a version of Fleming's Bond, maybe not the version Dalton did, Craig mixes it more with the cinematic version but with a confidence I never saw in Dalton.\n\nI don't remember Fleming writing about some suave playboy who causes havoc and destruction with no accountability and said oof allot when he got punched. Seriously you must be reading different Fleming to me, I've seen that interview with Moore when he attributes his performance to the element of Bond that doesn't like killing but he does because it's his job in one of the books, it might have started out like that but can you honestly tell me that it is Fleming's Bond in Moonraker?\n\nSeriously OP is now getting held up as lost Bond classic? The film with a sequence that contains John Glenn doing a dreadful pastiche of Raiders of The Lost Ark ( quite ironic considering Cubby turned down Spielberg to direct an entry) and has Bond screaming like Tarzan and that line about keeping you in curry for a week, someone's grasping at straws surely?\n\nFair enough no one is taking away from Rog that he was suave, smooth with the ladies and had great comic timing but to try and say he plays a more Fleming Bond than Craig and that OP has more tension than any Craig entry? No one would take away from him what he was known for he does better than anyone else but now you are trying to attribute the darker side of the character to him the side that Dalton and Craig are known for the Fleming Bond, you can't have your cake and eat it.\n\nShardlake wrote:\n\nI like Dalton I really do, I was one of those mourning his loss after seeing GE but for me personally just after witnessing Skyfall Craig takes Bond to a level that Tim didn't, his confidence in the role is now so recognisable.\n\nHe manages the quips to a degree that he's equalling Connery for me, he also in Skyfall is presenting to me a Bond with so much more depth, he presents a version of Fleming's Bond, maybe not the version Dalton did, Craig mixes it more with the cinematic version but with a confidence I never saw in Dalton.\n\nI don't remember Fleming writing about some suave playboy who causes havoc and destruction with no accountability and said oof allot when he got punched.

No one would take away from him what he was known for he does better than anyone else but now you are trying to attribute the darker side of the character to him the side that Dalton and Craig are known for the Fleming Bond, you can't have your cake and eat it.\n\nOh @Shardlake you were doing so well\n\nYou go and see Skyfall, you think it's good and Craig is good (which I am delighted to hear) and then feel the need to attack Roger Moore's era...very bizarre.\n\nWhether you like it or not, Moore portrayed a side of Fleming's bond just as Craig is doing now. Fact. You cannot deny Moore's Bond wasn't in Fleming's material because it was. The Fleming stories were out of date by the Moore era and unfit as they were so needed major revamping. Moonraker is a consequence of that and whether you think its good or bad, it happened and contributed to the continuing success of the Bond series. Without Moore, Bond would be dead. You couldn't have FRWL, OHMSS, LTK or CR in Moore's time because the world had moved on/wasn't ready for those type of films. Just as if Moonraker was made today, it would too be rejected as being out of it's time.\n\nAs for your bashing and unfair criticism of Octopussy, I am speechless. Octopussy is a classic and is better than any Craig entry (still to see Skyfall but tbh, I won't judge Skyfall in terms of ranking until the DVD comes out). Let's turn the tables: how is CR/QOS/SF a classic where OP fails to be? It's a matter of opinion. Octopussy is a great film and there is just constant quality throughout. And yes it is most tense and exciting. Compare the bomb scene in OP to that in the Miami Airport in CR...CR is nothing compared to OP. And here we go...the Moore bashers bring out the Tarzan argument. 4 seconds in a whole 2 hour film and that's the only criticism they got...it's so weak and boring now. Yes it was a mistake and not good but seriously, Richard Branson in CR? The Mongoose/Snake fight in CR? Mr Mendel in CR? Or aren't we not allowed to mention them because it's Craig??\n\nOP is the most tense Bond film held together by Roger Moore. His acting is seriously brilliant and he is tense and portrays Fleming's bond to a tee...I have never said Moore is darker than Craig/Dalton because that would be stupid. I am saying people like you fail to acknowledge the serious and dark moments of Sir Roger in his movies. And that is both a shame and biased. If Dalton/Craig had done Octopussy minus the Tarzan scene, you would rave about it. Because it's Moore, you don't want to give him credit"
