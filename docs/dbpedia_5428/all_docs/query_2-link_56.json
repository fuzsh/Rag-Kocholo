(there were 12 years between my parents, so, frankly, 15 doesnt seem too outrageous to me they''re not children, either of them.) and i think it''s a stretch VRBeauty to call him a marginal celebrity! he was voted Hollywood''s most powerful man on more than one occasion, he owns 2 movie studios and one recording studio, produced hollywood''s highest grossing film only a couple of years ago and he''s still generally considered to be able to headline a movie.\n\ndoes this make him a good guy? hardly. i think he''s anti-semitic and an alcoholic - an ugly combination. he also strikes me as being incredibly arrogant. but i think it''s always good to be careful with rhetoric - just in the interests of accuracy. and he definitely isnt the only alcoholic, arrogant racist in this country, that''s for sure! the best path forward, if you dont like him - and i dont - is just to avoid his movies. which is exactly what i do. frankly, i think he''s the new tom cruise when it comes to anti-popularity - and the only way to hurt either of them and to send a message of disapproval is in their hip pocket.\n\n(just for reference, his brother (the one that does the voiceovers) is married to the sister of a friend of mine, so i''ve always paid a tiny bit more attention to the things pertaining to him)\n\nWhitby, I always love your balanced and factual posts! (I don''t care for Mel, either, but I do like accuracy!). Alcholism is a devastating condition, that is for sure."
