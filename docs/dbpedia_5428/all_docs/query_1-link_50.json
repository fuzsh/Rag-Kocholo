        "text": "The character of James Bond has had many relationships over the years- so we thought it was time to take a look at the real life loves of the men behind the character to celebrate the release of the new film Spectre.\n\nDaniel Craig and Rachel Weisz\n\nDaniel Craig\n\nIn 1992, Craig married and lived in London with actress Fiona Louden, to whom he has a daughter with, Ella; however the marriage only lasted for two years and they divorced in 1994.\n\nFollowing his first divorce he entered into a 7 year relationship with German actress Heike Makatsh, whom he attended the premiere of Casino Royale with in 2006.The relationship ended in 2001 and then he went onto date producer Satsuki Mitchell between 2004 and 2010.\n\nHe was friends with his current wife, Rachel Weisz for many years before they worked together as husband and wife on the movie Dream House. \"I really enjoyed working with him,\" Weisz said . \"We have actually known each other a long time - since our early twenties. He's a good actor.\"(The Mirror)\n\nThey began dating and subsequently married on 22nd June 2011. The lovers were wed in New York City in a private ceremony with only four witnesses, one of which was Craig's daughter- Ella and the other- Weisz's 5 year old son, Henry. According to the Toronto Sun, Craig said: \"I did it secretly - I can't tell you how I pulled it off... My private life is incredibly important to me, and certainly that aspect of it is more than incredibly important to me.\"\n\nPierce Brosnan\n\nBrosnan has been married twice. He met his first wife, actress Casandra Harris, through her stepson David Harris not long after he left drama school. When he met her he recalled \"What a beautiful looking woman. I never for an instant thought she was someone I'd spend 17 years of my life with. I didn't think of wooing her, or attempting to woo her; I just wanted to enjoy her beauty and who she was.\" (Wikipedia)\n\nThey started dating and then bought a house together in Wimbledon before getting married on 27th December 1980. The pair had one son together (Sean), born on 13th September 1983. Brosnan and Harris both lived with her children (Charlotte and Christopher) to Dermot Harris and when he died in 1986, they adopted Brosnan's name.\n\nWhile he was filming The Deceivers in Rajasthan, in 1987, Harris became very ill. She was diagnosed with ovarian Caner and died on 28th December 1991 at only 43.\n\nHe said after her death; \"When your partner gets cancer, then life changes. Your timetable and reference for your normal routines and the way you view life, all this changes. Because you're dealing with death. You're dealing with the possibility of death and dying. And it was that way through the chemotherapy, through the first-look operation, the second look, the third look, the fourth look, the fifth look. Cassie was very positive about life. I mean, she had the most amazing energy and outlook on life. It was and is a terrible loss and I see it reflected, from time to time, in my children.\" (Wikipedia)\n\nHarris reportedly always wanted Brosnan to play the role of James Bond, a wish that came true in 1995.\n\nBrosnan then met journalist Keely Shaye Smith in 1994 on a beach in Mexico and married in 2001 at Ballintubber Abbey in County Mayo, Ireland.\n\nThey have two sons, Dylan Thomas Brosnan, who was born on 13 th January 1997 and Paris Beckett Brosnan, born on 27 th February 2001.\n\nTimothy Dalton\n\nDalton had a relationship with English actress Vanessa Redgrave with whom he starred in the movies Mary, Queen of Scots and Agatha with. They dated from 1971 and 1986.\n\nDalton remains unmarried however he has a son with Russian musician Oksana Grigorieva.\n\nGeorge Lazenby\n\nLazenby married his girlfriend, Chrissie Townsend whom he had been seeing for three years back in 1973. They have two children together, Zachary and Melanie.\n\nIn 2002, he married Pam Shriver, a former tennis player, but in 2008, Shriver filed for divorce from Lazenby citing 'irreconcilable differences'. They have three children together, including twins.\n\nRoger Moore\n\nMoore married his fellow RADA student and actress Doorn Van Steyn in 1946 when he was just 19. They resided in Streathan with her family, however tensions meant that their marriage didn't last and they divorced in 1952.\n\nHe then met Welsh singer Dorothy Squires who was 13 years older than him. They married and moved to New York to progress in their respective careers. Due to age differences, the marriage broke down.\n\nWhile Moore was filming the Rape of the Sabine Women in Italy, he left his wife for Italian actress Luise Mattioli. Squires sued Moore for loss of conjugal rights. Moore and Mattioli lived in together until 1969, when Squires granted a divorce seven years after they initially separated.\n\nMoore and Mattioli wed in Caxton Hall, Westminster in 1969.\n\nThe couple have three children together Deborah, Geoffrey and Christina.\n\nIn 1993, the pair separated when Moore's affections moved to Danish socialist Kristina Tholstrup after being friends for many years. Mattioli refused to divorce Moore until 2000 in a Â£10 million settlement. He married Tholstrup in 2002 and still speaks highly of her, calling her; \"organised\", \"serene\", \"loving\" and \"calm\". He reflected; \"I have a difficult life. I rely on Kristina totally. When we are traveling for my job she is the one who packs. Kristina takes care of all that.\" Moore also noted that his marriage to Tholstrup was \"a tranquil relationship, there are no arguments.\"\n\nSean Connery\n\nDuring the filming of South Pacific, Connery dated Carol Sople, whom he called a \"dark-haired beauty with a ballerina's figure\", however her family reportedly warned her away from him.\n\nHe then started seeing Julie Hamilton, the daughter of a documentary filmmaker. Supposedly, Hamilton was not attracted to Connery until she saw him in a kilt and she quickly changed her mind.\n\nConnery was married to Diane Cilento from 1962 to 1973; the couple have a son together, actor Jason Connery in 1963.\n\nThe divorce was said to be linked to the enormous toll that Connery playing Bond took on their lives and their marriage.\n\nThey initially met while they performed in the BBC production of Eugene O'Neill's play Anna Christie.\n\nOn 8 th October 2011, Cilento sadly died at age 78.\n\nSource: Wikipedia"
