        "text": "Call the Midwife star Vanessa Redgrave has had quite the career. The 84-year-old actress has been on our screens since 1958, when she debuted as Pamela Benson-Gray in Behind the Mask.\n\nIn her 64-year career, there has hardly been a moment when she has been out of work. She even has three more films coming out, one which has been completed and two that are still in post-production.\n\nIn Call the Midwife, a BBC drama series about a group of midwives working in the East End of London in the late 1950s and 1960s, Vanessa provides the voice for a mature Jenny Worth, a midwife who fell in love with a married man before fleeing to Poplar to escape her feelings.\n\nREAD MORE: Vannesa Redgrave's life from losing 3 close family members in 14 months to marriage to famous husband\n\nNot only does Venassa portray the character beautifully, she shows that after a period of over six decades, she still hasn’t lost any of her acting talent.\n\nThen again, that can only be expected considering her entire family have more or less been brought up in the theatre and film business.\n\nHer late ex-husband was Tony Richardson, an English theatre and film director and producer who won an Academy Award for Best Director for his 1963 comedy film Tom Jones. The couple were married from 1962 to 1967 and had two daughters, Natasha and Joely Richardson.\n\nBoth of their daughters grew up to be actresses.\n\nJoely has taken roles in several films and television series’ including The Tudors, 101 Dalmatians, Event Horizon, The Patriot, Return to Me, Anonymous, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Endless Love and Red Sparrow.\n\nHer older sister Natasha, who sadly passed away in a tragic skiing accident in 2009 at the age of 45, also starred in a number of films and theatre plays.\n\nShe was also the wife of Hollywood actor Liam Neeson, who really needs no introduction at all, having made his mark in films like Schindler's List. Les Misérables, Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace and Batman Begins to name a few.\n\nAnother thing many might have forgotten about Vanessa is that for a while after her divorce she actually dated a James Bond actor.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1986, Vanessa was in a 15-year relationship with Timothy Dalton, who featured in two 007 movies - The Living Daylights (1987) and Licence to Kill (1989). The pair met while both acting in the biographic classic Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nAfter they split, Vanessa reunited with another ex, Italian actor Franco Nero, who she later married in 2006.\n\nVanessa and Franco had already had a son together in 1969. Their son Carlo grew up to be a well-known screenwriter and film director. In fact, Vanessa even acted in one of her son’s films, The Fever, in 2004.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that Vanessa’s late brother Corin and later sister Lynn were actors as well. They both passed away within 13 and 14 months respectively of Vanessa’s daughter Natasha’s death."
