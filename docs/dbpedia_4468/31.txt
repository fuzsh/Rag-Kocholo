By the mid-1970s badge engineering was in full swing at General Motors and one of the best examples was Pontiac’s version of Chevrolet’s Vega, better known as the Astre. The final year of the Astre, however, is somewhat unique in that car came powered by Pontiac’s 2.5L “Iron Duke” inline-four-cylinder. This engine saw duty in a variety of GM products (the Fiero immediately comes to mind) as well as even finding its way to some Jeep products for a time before Chrysler bought that brand.

A one-owner, 57K mile, survivor example 1977 Astre is originally listed in September 2021 on Craigslist in Hampton, Tennesee appears to be nicely preserved and offered at $7,500 currently. Comparing that price against the Collector Car Market Review Online Tool confirms the seller’s ask falls between this guide’s #2 “Very Good” estimate of $6,600 and its #1 “Excellent ” appraisal of $9,875.

Pontiac’s badge-engineered version of the H-Body Chevrolet Vega was the Astre. Initially marketed in Canada for model years 1973–1974, the Astre debuted in the U.S. for the 1975 model year as a subcompact offering to help Pontiac dealers offer a sporty subcompact offering decent fuel economy. Like the Vega, Astres came available in hatchback, notchback, wagon, and panel delivery body styles. The Astre shared the aluminum-block 2.3-liter inline-four engine with the Vega through 1976, while the final 1977 models used Pontiac’s all-iron 2.5-liter “Iron Duke” inline-four engine. Pontiac replaced the Astre with its version of GM’s J-Body, the Sunbird, for the 1978 model years.

We came across this 1976 Pontiac Sales Training ad that attempted to help dealerships sell the features and benefits of the Astre:

With its much more durable and powerful 2.5L Iron Duke inline-four combine with working factory air conditioning, there’s a lot to like about this all-red Astre.

Here’s the seller’s description:
