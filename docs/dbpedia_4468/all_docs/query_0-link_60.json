        "text": "DETROIT, March 15—The General Motors Corporation is expected to drop the slow‐selling subcompact Chevrolet Vega and its sister car, the Pontiac Astre, at the end of the 1977 model year, accord ing to informed sources.\n\nSpecial to The New York Times\n\nThe action is being planned as part of a realignment of G.M.'s small car lines for 1978, the sources said, adding that small cars have not been selling well this year and that G.M. is going to reshuffle its lineup next year in hopes of boosting sales.\n\nRobert D. Lund, Chevrolet general manager, acknowledged, “We are going to consolidate the bottom end of our product line,” but, he said,” I am not in a position to define right now just what we are going to do for 1978. We still have a lot of 1977 cars to sell and it would be premature to announce any product line,” but, he said, “I am not\n\nBut he did confirm that Chevrolet will add a four‐door model of its Chevrolet Chevette minicar this year. “It will give the consumer a choice and a dealer an opportunity to sell more than the two door,” he said, adding the company is also “looking at the possibility” of a Che vette wagon.\n\nPontiac May Drop Ventura\n\nMeanwhile, Pontiac general manager Alex P. Mair said his division may drop the Pontiac Ventura compact line this year if the new Phoenix compact due this spring is as popular as expected. The Phoenix is a Ventura with a new front end design featuring the first use of large rectangular headlamps.\n\nThe entire Vega‐Astre subcompact line consisting of a coupe, a hatchback and a wagon will not disappear entirely, how ever, the sources said. They said the hatchback and wagon models are expected to be redesigned and to become part of the Chevrolet Monza line. The Pontiac Sunbird is similar to the Monza. With the Astre line dropped, the sources said the Sunbird is expected to pick up the subcompact wagon for the Pontiac deal ers to sell.\n\nThe aluminum engine used in the Vega and Monza cars is also expected to be replaced by a new cast iron four‐cylinder engine from Chevrolet, similar to the four‐cylinder iron engine Pontiac now uses, the sources said.\n\nDropping the Vega name, however, will mean that once again Chevrolet has been bested by Ford in a small‐car sales race.\n\nThe Vega lost the sales race to the Ford Pinto just as in the 1960's a Ford Falcon outsold the Corvair, the controver sial car Chevrolet discontinued after Ralph Nader challenged its safety and sales plummeted.\n\nProblems of Vega Model\n\nThe Vega did not suffer any such seri ous safety challenge but it had problems nonetheless. The early models rusted. The aluminum engine overheated. G.M. says both these problems have now been solved, but sales are still down.\n\nIt was not known what impact the product moves will have on employment at the G.M. assembly plant in Lawrence town, Ohio, which makes the Vega and Astre cars. The plant was modified earlier this year to also build the Monza and Sunbird cars in what was seen as a pre liminary to phasing out the Vega and Astre nameplates at Lawrencetown.\n\nThe Lawrencetown plant has 5,800 workers who were idled for a month dur ing January and February because of disappointing small car sales. The Chevette is made at the Wilmington, Del., 3.M. plant which has 1,725 workers."
