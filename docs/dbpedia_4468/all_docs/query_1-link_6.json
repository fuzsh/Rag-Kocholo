        "text": "The st0opid internetz lost my post in the ether. I'll start again.\n\n1992 Mustang GT Convertible - this was my first car. My Dad bought it new in 1992. I miss that car a ton and I wish I never sold it.\n\n2000 BMW Z3 2.3 (hence my username... Z3... get it?) - This is why I sold the Mustang. I always wanted one and I loved it as much as I knew I would. It was that strange Coppery red called Sienna Red Metallic. It was a beautiful color.\n\n1994 Mazda Miata - I bought this 6 years ago for $100 and thought I'd make it into a GRM $2008 Challenge car. I built it under budget, filled out the application, then started wondering how I'd get it home when it inevitably broke down. Six years and 50,000 miles later, that car hasn't let me down once. I should have brought it down, but I still TT the crap out of it.\n\n2008 Buell Lightning XB9SX City-X - I loved this bike too. I bought it from my brother with 6,500 miles and sold it a couple years later with over 23,000. I never crashed it, but I did jump a deer with it once.\n\n2001 Lexus IS 300 - I loved this car and owned it for a year, but I parted with it when I bought the Viper so I could eventually replace it (the Lexus) with a tow vehicle. Interestingly enough, it was my only car with any of the following: four doors, a hard roof, and an automatic transmission.\n\n1994 Dodge Viper RT/10 - I wanted one since I was 7 years old. I remember almost every occasion I ever happened upon one. I picked it up in Michigan in September and road-tripped it home to my parents' house in York PA before taking it to my house the following day. It was an epic ride with beautiful weather, and a pair of lunatics playing pranks on each other for 13 hours. \"Dad, I told you the road isn't damp! It's just the pavement! It looks damp because... oh. You're just berkeleying with me.\"\n\nPatterns were interesting. I went from a V8 to an I6 to an I4 to a V-twin before I started back in the right direction. I've owned 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 cylinder cars now. All have been manuals, except the Lexus. All have been convertibles, except the Lexus. Three have been roadsters. The latest one has about the same horsepower as the last three combined and roughly the same displacement as all of the previous combined--not counting the Mustang. Also, I currently own only cars made in 1994.\n\nI'd post pictures, but photobucket won't let me load a normal website on my Surface. The mobile site is terrible and I'm 10,000 miles away from my lap top with all of the other pictures anyway."
