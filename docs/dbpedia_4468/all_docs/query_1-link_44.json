        "text": "Geely Emgrand GT\n\nSaw one of these leaving a parking space, that's looks far better than any other Chinese cars i've spotted on the road. Who knows? Maybe we could see Chinese Cars becoming the next Hyundai and Kia.\n\nWhy it looks better than previous cars Geely have made is because they are the current owner of Volvo, and so Geely decided to ask Volvo chief designer if he willing to help designing their cars and he agreed. The result is as what you can see above and you will notice there is design influence as usually seen in the recent Volvo cars as well.\n\nCelica SS-III. I was well aware of the SS-II, but I just booted up my NTSC-J copy of GT2, went to the Toyota used section and sure enough, not one, not two, but three Celica SS-III's show up. And I don't remember ever seeing it in the game before, and didn't know it was a thing. Apparently they came with BEAMS 3Ss, similar to the limited run MR-Spyder.\n\nView attachment 667100 View attachment 667101 View attachment 667102\n\n@GDII could probably correct me on this but I think the SS-II also came with the BEAMS 3G.\n\nAlso, here is Lamborghini L30, designed by Horacio Pagani in early 90's as successor to Countach, but the whole thing is scrapped and instead the Diablo was born. You can also see these design had influence to the later Zonda :\n\nThis was actually designed to be a 30th Anniversary model for Lamborghini; Horacio was the designer behind the Countach 25th Anniversary, so the project was again pinned by him. Money was very tight back then, so Chrysler & their investors decided on going with a new Diablo model instead to celebrate.\n\nThe Diablo was spawned by the Cizeta design as seen by P132, contracted to Gandini immediately following the 25th Anniversary car.\n\nIt ended up working out in the long run as the Diablo shed away a lot of Countach similarities would not have aged the car as well as it has today.\n\n@GDII could probably correct me on this but I think the SS-II also came with the BEAMS 3G.\n\nWell both the SS-II and SS-III came with the BEAMS redtop after December 1997.\n\nHere is an SS-III. Part number 11101-88560 is a BEAMS head. Chassis code ST202-0131002.\n\nhttp://www.toyodiy.com/parts/p_J_199807_TOYOTA_CELICA_ST202-BLMZF_1104.html\n\nHere is an SS-II with the same part number for the head. Chassis code ST202-0131003.\n\nhttp://www.toyodiy.com/parts/p_J_199807_TOYOTA_CELICA_ST202-BLPVF_1104.html\n\nI picked the chassis codes to force toyodiy to tell me exactly what the car had from the factory rather than listing all 3 heads.\n\nThe Redtop came in the JDM only GEN5 SW20 G-Limited from December 1997 to September 1999. The MR-Spyder had either the normal GEN3 3SGE or as they were made after 1997 they would get the BEAMS but very rare as the only made 93ish of the cars over about 4 years or so. Most were auto.\n\nLancia Stratos HF RX\n\n​\n\nWell, as it turns out the Stratos was also used as a rally-cross machine. Funny that this one has escaped me, considering how aware I am of it's rallying heritage, but also the fact that I have a better knowing of the Stratos' whereabouts as a group 5 silhouette machine, and even it's history as a Le Man 24H racer, before knowing it was a proper RX beast .\n\nThough looking at it now, I suppose it makes a fair bit of sense to evolve it into a rally-cross machine from a \"standard\" rally car, given it's ability. And I suppose it did then in the 70's, even when considering that RX was still a relatively \"new\" thing. And Austrian Andy Bentza was the guy responsible for said project.\n\nAnd it seems like it worked, as his then teammate Franz Wurz; father of Alex of course, managed to take the inaugural European Rally-cross title in '76 when it was regonised as an official championship by the FIA, and then the GT class title in Bentza's hands 2 years later.\n\nAlso interestingly (bonus nerdy fact alert ), whilst both cars used the same 2.4L Dino V6 as the rally car, one of them was eventually fitted with a tuned 3.0L version of the same engine , which was initially used by Wurz, before Bentza took over and used it right up until 1983. And as a result, it's apparently the only Stratos to use a 3.0 Litre version of the Dino V6. Can only imagine it would've been even more of a handful (and even quicker), than it already was .\n\nOh and for another random interesting fact, Bentza kept the car for another 30 years after he stopped racing it, before selling to no other than Alex Wurz, who then restored it and put it back in it's original spec and Memphis livery, as per 1976. Pretty neat stuff if you ask me.\n\nWell I learned something right there, I thought the BEAMS 3SGE was only available in the Altezza.\n\nHere's more on the BEAMS 3SGE.\n\nThe Redtop in the MR2 and Celica is a GEN4 3SGE. There is also a Greytop that the Caldina GT had which makes 10hp less. It has a black valve cover but has a grey intake plenum so to differentiate between the GEN5 Altezza BEAMS 3SGE with it's black valve cover it's called a Greytop. The GEN5 3SGE in the Altezza sits straight up and down vs the GEN1-4 3SGE. It also has dual VVT-i where the GEN4 has single and the 1-3 had nothing.\n\nGEN1 3SGE\n\nGEN2 3SGE\n\nGEN3 3SGE\n\nGEN4 Redtop\n\nGEN4 Greytop\n\nGEN5 Blacktop\n\nI like to consider myself a Porsche enthusiast (if you cant tell from my screen-name and avatar...) but I still sometimes learn about Porsches. For example, did you know about the 2.7 Carrera MFI? I didn't! Or I chose to ignore it, I dunno. The MFI (which stands for Mechanically Fuel Injected) has the same engine as the legendary 2.7 RS of 1973, but the MFI had the \"G\"-series impact bumpers.\n\nThe 1974 2.7 MFI had the ducktail from the RS (with a wing delete option):\n\nThe 1975-76 one had the whale tail (with a wing delete option):\n\nThey even made some Targa versions:\n\nVery little that comes up here is new to me, but this is.\n\nPassport/Asuna.\n\nPassport was a Canadian car dealership network owned by General Motors in 1988.\n\nThis way they can sell their imports in Canada, from Isuzu to Saab, and its own branded car, the Optima.\n\nIt is yet another blatant rebadged Opel Kadett/Daewoo LeMans to cut costs of making a new car from scratch. Bearing striking similarities to its U.S. sibling, the Pontiac LeMans and offering the same exact body styles.\n\n3 or 5 door hatchback\n\nAnd 4-door sedan\n\nHell, there was even a GSi model that nobody payed attention to.\n\nAlthough it got 52mpg on the highway, the Passport Optima never caught on with buyers as it was very slow and didn't last long, as well as the company. It was axed in 1991 and GM rebranded it as Asuna in 1993, renaming the Optima as the Asuna SE and GT.\n\nIt still looked the same as the LeMans but it had a restyled front fascia and the sedan had different looking tailights.\n\nAsuna sold other cars but just like these above, they were badge engineered too.\n\nSunfire (Isuzu Piazza) Fun fact: The name of the car was later brought over to the J-body Pontiac Sunfire replacing the Sunbird.\n\nSunrunner (Suzuki Escudo/Geo Tracker) It took the place of the other obscure Tracker clone, the GMC Tracker. It was marketed as an upscale model as it had no base model. It was equipped with all the GMC Tracker SLE's standard features.\n\nBut alas, they all sold poorly as Asuna shut its doors in 1994, making it the most short lived marque from GM.\n\nContinuing this onslaught of oddball Canadian cars, you'll be flabbergasted to discover that Lada actually sold cars in North America. CANADA to be precise.\n\nLadaCanada started importing in 1979. The first model was the 2106 (1500/1600) with a 1500cc motor.\n\nThe Niva 4x4 came with the choice of two engines, a carbureted 1.6 OHC 75hp I4 or a fuel injected 1.7 80hp I4. Interestingly, the single-point fuel injection system came supplied from General Motors.\n\nSpeaking of GM, the pickup model had taillights that were taken directly from the Chevrolet Astro & GMC Safari.\n\nThe Riva was renamed the Signet as it was briefly sold as the \"Dennis Signet\" after the importer Peter Dennis Motor Corporation. With a sticker price of $4,998, it was the cheapest car you can buy in Canada at that time.\n\nAnd the last one was the Samara. It competed with cheap hatchbacks with the likes of the Nissan March, Toyota Tercel, and Hyundai Excel.\n\nOne thing that the Samara has going for is that the 75hp 1,499cc I4 was developed by Porsche. Yeah, i'm not making this up, the head was developed in Porsche's co-operation which echoes a similar thing they did with the MK1 SEAT Ibiza.\n\nSurprisingly they sold pretty well and lived on until 1998, and sightings of these are a rare spot with a small number of running examples rolling around. Heck, there's even a couple up for grabs on Kijiji. https://www.kijiji.ca/b-cars-vehicles/canada/ladas/k0c27l0\n\nThose are getting me the urge to go up to Canada to drive one of these to seach for other rarely seen Canadian cars and save them from extinction.\n\nSomehow a tiny number of 110s snuck their way into Canada for reasons unknown.\n\nTo make it even more outlandish, Lada is returning to Canada in 2019.\n\nhttp://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/42206/lada-to-return-to-canada/\n\nWe'll see if Lada can live another life in Canada or quickly vanish like every other car company in Canada."
