        "text": "In today’s Story from the Museum Floor, Chiara from the Visitor Team takes a look back at some of the behind the scenes work that has been on show in The Conservatory on the Third Floor at Manchester Museum over the last few months.\n\nThis versatile space is currently being used for Jallianwala Bagh 1919: Punjab under Siege, a collaborative exhibition with the Partition Museum, India, which is open now and runs until 2nd October 2019. And watch this space for more exciting developments in the future.\n\nFor more on the ways the Museum is changing, have a look at the hello future blog.\n\nCaring for our Collection\n\nWe have galleries filled with incredible things, objects and stories. It is exciting to work with incredible objects that tell you something unique, interesting and sometimes unexpected about the period, or the people who made, used or found it.\n\nHowever, one of best thing about working in a museum, along with the objects, is the people – their range of talents, expertise and everybody’s enthusiasm for the place and the collection.\n\nSharing Skills, Sharing Stories\n\nRecently, in The Conservatory on Manchester Museum’s third floor, we have been given a glimpse of the behind the scenes work, skills and expertise that goes into the conservation and care of our collection.\n\nCleaning the Dragon. Sam Beath, Collections Care Manager and Senior Conservator, working on a nineteenth century Japanese incense burner in The Conservatory.\n\nOver the last few months, the Conservation Team have been sharing their skills and experience with the visitors, bringing objects they are working on into the work space on the third floor. One of the long-term projects involves a team of volunteers working daily on the cleaning and restoration of 100 year old replica gesso plaster casts of the Parthenon’s south end Metopes.\n\nCaring for Casts – The Parthenon Metopes\n\nThe Manchester Museum gesso casts of the Parthenon Metopes are copies of the originals, currently on display the the British Museum. Each one reproduces a self-contained scene, usually including two figures. The subjects were taken from legendary battles and symbolise the victories of the Athenians over the Persians. The theme of the scenes on the south side was the fight of the Thessalian youths (Lapiths) against the Centaurs (Centauromachy).\n\nThe two bas-reliefs currently being worked on by Manchester Museum volunteers, show an old Centaur opposed by a young Lapith, after the famous attempt to abduct Lapith women during a wedding celebration. On Metope VII (pictured below on the left), the head of the Centaur, present on the drawing attributed to Jacques Carrey, has since disappeared. However, the head of the other figure, the Lapith, in place in 1674, was found in 1913 near the Varvakeio at the foot of the Acropolis. It is now at the Acropolis Museum of Athens, still separated from the Metope, which is still on display at the British Museum.\n\nSouth Metopes of the Parthenon in Athens; Drawing attributed to Jacques Carrey, 1674 (Source); Original marbles (446 – 442 BC), on display at the British Museum (source); Manchester Museum replicas in the Conservatory, Manchester Museum.\n\nThe plaster replicas at Manchester Museum are constituted by layers of gesso applied onto a metal frame structure and strengthened inside by a mixture of organic material, including horsehair. Historically, especially because it was so easily available, hair has been commonly used in plaster as a binding medium, giving tenacity to the material. Hair functions in much the same way as the strands in fibreglass resin, by controlling and containing any small cracks during drying.\n\nThe Volunteer Project\n\nThe process of cleaning involved an initial stage of gentle brushing and a vacuuming of the surface and then subsequently using cotton buds stick soaked in sterile water to remove the first layer of dirt. The volunteers then proceeded onto a further step of removing dirt and sediment with solution of water and methylated spirits.\n\nFor the areas where the casts needed restoration, a solution of PVA glue and water was applied onto the exposed parts of the cast. The absences were then filled with a mix of plaster and water. This process was repeated a multiple times in order to let the gesso layer solidify naturally, until it was hard and ready to be shaped.\n\nVolunteers working on the restoration of the casts of the Parthenon Metopes. Also visible is the exposed metal frame and organic mixture in the construction of the cast.\n\nCaring for the Past, Present and Future\n\nMuseum objects often need conservation, either as preparation before they go on display or as a prevention against deterioration, however this is not usually a process seen by the public!\n\nRecently Conservator Irit Narkiss used the Conservatory space to carry out some important care work on a very interesting ancient Egyptian object. Doing this work in public gives our conservators an opportunity to communicate some of the processes and the importance of the work that usually take place behind the scenes.\n\nConservator Irit Narkiss working on an ancient Egyptian fragment of scene from the wall of a house in Tell el-Amarna.\n\nThe object Irit was working on is a scene painted on mud and plaster which was once part of a wall, found in Egypt at the archaeological site of Tell el-Amarna, dating to the 18th Dynasty. It was removed to England in 1890 already mounted onto a wooden board with cement, by British Egyptologist Flinders Petrie. It was donated to Manchester Museum in 1891 by Mr Jesse Haworth, a Manchester cotton magnate, whose financial generosity supported Manchester Museum as well as Petrie’s archaeological excavations in Egypt.\n\nThe wall painting is quite exceptional in that rather than a temple or tomb, it comes from a private house. It is a wall decoration from a villa, and depicts two men bowing in the foreground and doorway on a step or platform. The figures are painted in iron rich hematite red, and their clothes are white. The doorway is painted with blue stripes in a blue-green copper oxide, and the background is in yellow ochre.\n\nRevelation and Consolidation\n\nThe the surface of the painted plaster had been covered under a layer of dirt deposited by the thick industrial Manchester air. This needs to be cleaned very gently in small areas in order to avoid the removal of mineral pigment itself.\n\nAfter this process the object will be impregnated with water and adhesive in a treatment called consolidation. This will prevent fracture or loss of parts from the surface, additionally, the adding of very light glass micro-balloons will strength and increase the resistance of the structure, without adding weight or modifying the flexibility.\n\nThis intervention, as with the majority of the conservation work carried out by expert conservators, is intended as far as possible to be reversible, and each process is recorded as it becomes a part of the history of the object.\n\nThe tools of the trade. Conservator Irit Narkiss at work in The Conservatory, Manchester Museum.\n\nThese are just a couple of the activities that have been taking place in The Conservatory. Work like this takes place everyday behind the scenes at Manchester Museum, as we continue to use our collection to tell the stories of past people and places and to inspire our visitors to think about the world in new ways, as well as keeping it safe for the future.\n\nChiara Ludolini\n\nFor more about volunteering opportunities at Manchester Museum, have a look at our website.\n\nFind out more:\n\nTarbell, F.
