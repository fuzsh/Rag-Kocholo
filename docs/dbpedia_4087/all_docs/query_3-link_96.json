        "text": "From their beginnings, archaeology museums have reflected a complex and dynamic balance between the demands of developing, documenting, and preserving objects on the one hand and sharing knowledge, access, and control on the other. This balance has informed and inflected the ways that museums present the past, including both practical aspects of pedagogy and exhibition design as well as more critical and contested issues of authority, authenticity, and reflexivity in interpretation. Meeting the complex requirements of curation, deliberate collections growth, management, and conservation, as well as the need to respond to continuing challenges to the museum's right and title to hold various forms of cultural property, archaeological museums play an active role in both preserving and shaping the public's view of the past and reflect the prospects and perils of being at once a temple to the muses and a forum for sometimes contentious public discourse.\n\nMuseum Theory is the first volume of a four volume set of International Handbooks of Museum Studies. Edited by myself and Kylie Message, the book is organised around the central idea of conjunctures – between theory, practice and context. It therefore looks at ideas about museums, the relationships between various disciplines and knowledge production in museums, and at practice -the latter in terms of the application of theory in museum contexts as well as thinking about practice as a form of 'doing theory'. Contributors come from many different countries. They include early career scholars as well as internationally renowned figures and they come from practice as well as academia. The range of museums discussed is also wide and from around the world.\n\nRESCUE – The British Archaeological Trust welcomes the publication of Understanding the Future: Museums and 21st century life as an opportunity to debate the role of museums at the beginning of the 21st century. We are particularly pleased to see commitments to the museums sector being made by ministers and look for these to be carried forward into practical policies which will reverse the chronic underfunding which has plagued the museum sector, and particularly the local and regional component of that sector, over the next few years. In our response to the discussion document we have sought to highlight a series of issues which affect the effectiveness of museums in carrying out their various tasks. Our concerns are focussed specifically on archaeology, but our comments may also have more general applicability\n\nI reviewed the following books in the series: Contesting Human Remains in Museum Collections: The Crisis of Cultural Authority by Tiffany Jenkins. (New York; London: Routledge, 2011). Designing for the Museum Visitor Experience by Tiina Roppola. (New York; London: Routledge, 2012). Exhibiting Madness in Museums: Remembering Psychiatry through Collections and Display. Edited by Catharine Coleborne and Dolly MacKinnon. (New York; London: Routledge, 2011). Museum Gallery Interpretation and Material Culture edited by Juliette Fritsch. (New York; London: Routledge, 2011). Representing Enslavement and Abolition in Museums: Ambiguous Engagements edited by Laurajane Smith, Geoffrey Cubitt, Ross Wilson, and Kalliopi Fouseki. (New York; London: Routledge, 2011).\n\nThis chapter reflects on the future of archaeological museum as an institution that is actively engaged in public debates on current social, cultural and economic problems, and serves as an instrument for democratic education. An idea of a “critical archaeological museum” is introduced and discussed in reference to a claim that only by (re)connecting museums and academies, museums can actively engage in on-going social discussions and debates. The discussion is supported by an analysis of a contemporary Polish artwork performed by Agnieszka Kalinowska, “Heavy water”."
