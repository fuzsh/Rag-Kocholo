        "text": "Our BA Ancient History and Archaeology will enable you to combine the techniques of archaeology with the culture and history of ancient civilisations in your studies.\n\nThe study of people lies at the heart of our courses, such as exploring how the Roman Empire used architecture as a political statement.\n\nYet we also use scientific methods to examine ancient objects, human remains and landscapes. You will study ancient Mediterranean empires alongside the archaeology of Britain, Western Europe, the Greek and Roman worlds and the Near East.\n\nThroughout the course, you'll have opportunity to study ancient languages and to conduct expert-led archaeological fieldwork, gaining knowledge of two complementary approaches to the past while gaining key skills in analysis and interpretation.\n\nStudy with us and you'll explore artefacts, architecture, ancient texts and beliefs using our well-equipped laboratories, our own departmental teaching collections, and the exclusive archives and curatorial expertise of Manchester Museum.\n\nExperience digs in the UK and abroad\n\nFieldwork training is an integral part of Archaeology, and you'll be introduced to excavation techniques by experienced archaeologists,Â with the opportunity to join fieldwork or museum placements during your degree.\n\nPlacement year option\n\nApply your subject-specific knowledge in a real-world contextÂ through a placement year in your third year of study, enabling you to enhance your employment prospects, clarify your career goals and build your external networks.\n\nStudy abroad\n\nYou may apply to spend one semester studying abroad during Year 2. You'll have the opportunity to join research teamsÂ and help make discoveries that shape our knowledge of the world.\n\nDestination-specific specialisms could support research on such as Inuit material culture, Australian rock art or Scandinavian hoards, enriching could shape your final year dissertation.\n\nExplore in-depth collections on campus\n\nDiscover artefacts, architecture, ancient texts and beliefs using our well-equipped laboratories, our own departmental teaching collections and the exclusive archives and curatorial expertise of Manchester Museum .\n\nOutreach and engagement\n\nYou'll have the opportunity to share your passion for archaeology through community and public engagement projects.\n\nManchester MuseumÂ\n\nManchester Museum Â is The University's own award-winning facility, home to important prehistoric, classical and ethnographic collections, which you'll draw from in yourÂ learning.Â\n\nYou'll go behind the scenes to handle, analyse and interpret rare artefacts, including one of the finest Egyptology collections in Britain.Â\n\nOur ongoing collaboration between the museum and the global work of archaeology staff offers unique opportunities for students to get involved in the design of major exhibitions.Â\n\nWhitworth Art GalleryÂ\n\nThe Whitworth Art Gallery Â holds important archaeological textile collections, and art and sculpture on themes such as landscape as part of its broader internationally significant collections.Â\n\nThe Granada Centre for Visual AnthropologyÂ\n\nThe Granada Centre for Visual Anthropology Â is home to a film library with some 1,500 titles, from classic ethnographic film to contemporary documentary and world cinema.Â\n\nTo complement the film titles, it boosts a comprehensive collection of written materials by anthropologists and film makers, including a selection of journals.Â\n\nArchaeological laboratoriesÂ\n\nOur dedicated archaeological laboratories contain a wide range of equipment you can use during your degree.Â\n\nGet to grips with our extensive archaeological artefacts, ranging from the Early Palaeolithic to the 20th century.Â\n\nUse microscopes, professional photography and measurement equipment, a 3D scanner and printer, and portable XRF to analyse and record artefacts.Â\n\nOr try out our GPS equipment, total stations and drones when out in the field.Â\n\nLearn how to combine these with software for digital illustrations GIS analysis of maps and spatial data and 3D digital models to enhance your analysis and understanding.Â\n\nThroughout your degree, this equipment will be available for loan from our dedicated lab technician, who can also offer any extra training you need.Â\n\nOur separate teaching and research labs are used for teaching thorough our degrees andÂ are available for independent student study and research.Â\n\nThey also host our experimental archaeology group, which regularly meets to make and use types of artefacts from a range of archaeological periods.Â\n\nFind out more on theÂ facilities Â page."
