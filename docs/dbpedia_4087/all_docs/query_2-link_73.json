        "text": "Museums in Skipton, Dundee, Manchester and London will compete for the 2024 Museum of the Year award.\n\nThree of this year's five shortlisted museums have undergone major renovations, only reopening in the last 18 months.\n\nThe shortlisted institutions cover museums spanning portraits, natural history, science, textiles, fine art and children's creativity spaces.\n\nThe winner, announced on 10 July, will receive Â£120,000, while Â£15,000 will be given to each of the other four finalists.\n\nDescribed as the world's largest museum prize, the shortlist for Museum of the Year was announced by Art Fund, the UK's national charity for art.\n\nThe prize recognises projects open to the public from autumn 2022 through to winter 2023.\n\nOrganisers say they particularly focus on community engagement, sustainable ways of working and reinvention when selecting the shortlist.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the judges, Jenny Waldman, the director of Art Fund, described the shortlist as \"shining examples of the impact museums are making locally and nationally\".\n\n\"Each of our finalists truly has something for everyone and all have community at the very heart of their programming,\" she said.\n\n\"Their commitment to innovative partnerships whilst operating within an extremely challenging funding environment is incredible, and I'm so pleased to see the way they support and centre young people through their work.\""
