        "text": "Did you know that Manchester has some of the finest museums in the world? Yes. In the museums, you will find cotton mills, rare fossils, football trophies and discover many other things. For example, you might discover the city’s industrial, musical and sporting heritage. The following are some of the museums to visit today. Manchester taxis are here to help you reach the museums within the shortest time possible.\n\nOld Trafford Museum and Tour Centre\n\nIf you are a football enthusiast and a Manchester United’s fan, you might need to visit the Manchester United’s Museum and Tour Centre to learn more about the football club. Graphing the lows and highs of the world’s successful football teams, the museum has more than 130 years of history ready for football enthusiasts. Also, consider booking a tour of the Old Trafford stadium.\n\nMuseum of Science and Industry (MOSI)\n\nThe Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) is housed in buildings that are also historic. Two of the buildings are in the Grade II list and one of the two represents the site of Manchester’s oldest passenger railway station.\n\nYou can learn about the city’s industrial past through live demonstrations. That includes steam engines and weaving machines in Power Hall of the Textile mill. In the Air and Space Hall, you will find planes, automobiles and bikes. Entrance is free. https://www.scienceandindustrymuseum.org.uk/\n\nManchester Museum\n\nFor individuals who love the Ancient Egypt, the University of Manchester has a collection for you. In addition to mummies, the museum has three galleries purposely devoted to Egyptology. The museum opened its doors in earlier 1880s and their collection focuses on anthropology and archaeology. Use services of taxis in Manchester to reach the museum at any time of the day. You will find the Maude, the famous Tigon (a lion/tiger/ cross, which has been in storage for over 65 years in this museum.\n\nImperial War Museum North\n\nIn Trafford, you will find a striking building that is specifically designed to leave all visitors slightly uneasy and assist them to process all the feelings that conflicts and war can evoke – the building lies on a former bomb site. The main exhibitions chart all the wars that have affected Britain since the First World War. Taxis in Manchester are here to help you avoid missing out the Big Picture Show – a blend of film and photographs. It broadcasts across 27ft high walls within the exhibition space. The films, which run for around one hour, focus on issues like Children at War and Home Front.\n\nPeople’s History Museum\n\nThe motto of the People’s History Museum is “ideas have always been worth fighting for”. With political objects, the museum has managed to show all the struggles for equality in the country within the last 200 years. If you are interested in politics, you will find many posters, slogans, cartoons describing the radical fights for freedom.\n\nGreater Manchester Police Museum\n\nThe Greater Manchester Police Museum is among the museums to consider during your tour in Manchester. You can visit the museum during the opening hours (Tuesdays) but you can pre-book in the other days. From early police prototypes to Peelers and the present day forces, expect to find a wide collection of police uniforms.\n\nElizabeth Gaskell’s House\n\nWith Manchester taxis, you can now visit the Elizabeth Gaskell’s House. Elizabeth Gaskell was a famous novelist with many famous works such as Cranford and North and South, which are already adapted for television. Also, consider visiting the Grade II listed Regency villa. You will learn more about the famous writer, her family circle and her work after visiting the gardens and taking afternoon coffee in what was her kitchen.\n\nManchester Jewish Museum\n\nThe Manchester Jewish Museum is the only Jewish museum you will find out of London. The Victorian building is Grade II listed and was built in 1874. It is, therefore, the oldest synagogue in Manchester. Originally, the Jewish community settled in Manchester around 1788. The first Jews to arrive were 15 traders. In the 1840s and 1930s, immigrants fled persecution but Holocaust survivors entered the city in 1940s. You can get all the history inside the museum.\n\nNational Football Museum\n\nIn 2001, the National Football Museum was transferred from Preston to Manchester. The museum has over 140,000 football artefacts such as boots, programmes, paintings and balls. To visit the primary exhibition, you will not pay anything. However, you can buy some credits if you would like to try out a few interactive football skill games. The president of this Museum is Sir Bobby Charlton, Manchester United’s most celebrated player and 1966 England World Cup Winner. Actually, one stand in Old Trafford is named after him. Take a Manchester Taxi today and check out George Best’s Ballon d’Or award (1968), Diego Maradona’s 1986 World Cup Shirt and many other world cup treasures.\n\nClayton Hall Living History Museum\n\nThe Clayton Hall Living History Museum dates back to the 15th century and you will therefore not see the global moated medieval buildings. The Museum is in the Grade II category. Volunteers have restored it back to its original look and it is now open to the public twice a month. You kids will get dressed up in the Museum to live like Victorians."
