The OG immersive museums are living, walk-through educational spaces. They’re designed to plonk you in the middle of another time and place – and give you an engaging, multisensory way to learn.\n\nAnd the UK has long been spoilt with proper, good old-fashioned immersive museums. Filled with artefacts and inhabited by energetic actors, they’re ideal for getting to grips with everything from industry in the Black Country and Victorian high streets to Anglo-Saxon village life. Want to see history come to life before your eyes? Head this way: here are the nine best living museums in the UK to visit right now."
