The new biographies will also be added to the museum’s online archives.\n\nManchester Museum’s collection includes artefacts from Africa (primarily Egypt and northern Sudan), the eastern Mediterranean (Syria, Palestine), and western Asia (Iran, Iraq).\n\nThey were acquired during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, at a time when British colonial influence enabled the removal of vast quantities of archaeological material. These regions overlap significantly with the countries of origin of many of the UK’s contemporary forced migrants."
