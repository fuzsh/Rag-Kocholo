It was formed in 1980 to preserve the industrial heritage of the last working steam mill engine in the area.\n\nThis magnificent mill engine, with its two cylinders and 16 foot flywheel can generate over 600 Indicated Horsepower and originally drove some 1,250 weaving looms via its main shaft more than 260 feet in length.\n\nBancroft Mill Engine Trust, Gillians Lane, Barnoldswick BB18 5QR\n\nwww.bancroftmill.org.uk\n\nBath, Somerset\n\nMuseum of Bath at Work\n\nThe Museum of Bath at Work is dedicated to illustrating the real Bath rather than the lives of the rich and famous who came to visit to take the waters. The core of the exhibits is a re-creation of the works of Jonathan Bowler whose family business operated from the 1860s to the 1960s.\n\nBowlers specialised in engineering but also had a small foundry, made carbonated water for the local restaurants and pubs and did work on gas installation and illuminated signs. When the business closed in 1969 a local industrial designer Russell Frears purchased the contents, much of which dated back to the previous century, and acquired premises to display them. Apart from the Bowler collection the museum has exhibits illustrating the other trades that existed in Bath including malting, brewing, papermaking and printing, textiles, stone quarrying and furniture making. There is usually also a temporary exhibition changing once or twice per year as well as talks, films and theatrical performances.\n\nMuseum of Bath at Work is near the Assembly Rooms at Camden Works, Julian Road, Bath, Somerset BA1 2RH, UK\n\nwww.bath-at-work.org.uk\n\nBeamish, County Durham\n\nBeamish Museum\n\nThe Museumâs guiding principle is to preserve an example of everyday life in urban and rural North of East England at the climax of industrialisation in the early 20th century.\n\nMuch of the restoration and interpretation is specific to the late Victorian and Edwardian eras, together with portions of countryside under the influence of industrial revolution in 1825.

After 1697 the Hall was rented out to various tenants.\n\nIt was during this period that a young Samuel Crompton came to live there with his parents. In 1779 he invented his Spinning Mule, which revolutionised the cotton industry.\n\nGreen Way, Off Crompton Way, Bolton BL1 8UA\n\nhttps://www.boltonlams.co.uk/hall-i-th-wood-museum\n\nBradford, Yorkshire\n\nBradford Industrial Museum\n\nMoorside Mills was built around 1875 as a small worsted spinning Mill by John Moore. Ownership of the mills changed many times, and they developed and grew. In 1970, Bradford Council bought Moorside Mills from Messrs. W & J Whitehead to create an innovative museum.\n\nBradfordâs Industrial Museum has permanent displays of textile machinery, steam power, engineering, printing machinery and motor vehicles, along with an exciting exhibitions programme.

Discover the story of cotton cloth production.\n\nHarle Syke, Burnley BB10 2HX\n\nwww.lancashire.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/museums/queen-street-mill-textile-museum.aspx\n\nThe Weaverâs Triangle\n\nThe Weaversâ Triangle is a modern name for an area astride the Leeds and Liverpool Canal that was once at the heart of Burnleyâs textile industry.\n\nThe name was first used in the 1970s, as interest developed in preserving Burnleyâs industrial heritage, and refers to the roughly triangular shape of the region.\n\nExploring the area will still find many buildings from the days when the town led the world in the production of cotton cloth. A largely unbroken sequence of weaving sheds and spinning mills encloses the canal, making this one of the finest surviving Victorian industrial landscapes in the country.\n\nThe area contains many other historic buildings â foundries, warehouses, domestic buildings and a school. Of particular interest is Slater Terrace â an unusual row of eleven houses above a canal-side warehouse.\n\n85 Manchester Road, Burnley BB11 1JZ\n\nwww.weaverstriangle.co.uk\n\nCoventry\n\nCoventry Transport Museum\n\nCoventry Transport Museum opened in 1980, after it became clear that the road transport collection was outgrowing the space it occupied in the Herbert Art Gallery & Museum. The Museumâs current collection of vehicles is acknowledged as being one of the finest in the world, and the largest in public ownership.\n\nThe first exhibits were acquired in 1937 when Samuel Bartleet gifted the City of Coventry his own private collection of cycles. The first motor cars were added to the collection in 1952, and the collection has continued to grow ever since.\n\nThe first major public exhibitions began in 1960 with the official opening of the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum. As the transport collection grew, the vehicles were housed in a number of local sites, eventually settling at their present location in 1980.\n\nThe Museumâs collection consists of motor cars, commercial vehicles, cycles and motorcycles. In addition, extensive collections of automobilia, books, photographs and a wealth of other archive material is held and conserved at the Coventry History Centre at the Herbert Art Gallery & Museum. Most of the collection exists through the outstanding generosity of individual donors.\n\nCoventry Transport Museum is in Coventry City Centre: Millennium Place, Hales Street, Coventry CV1 1JD\n\nwww.transport-museum.com\n\nDudley, West Midlands\n\nBlack Country Living Museum\n\nThe Black Country Living Museum is distinctive because of the scale, drama, intensity and multiplicity of the industrial might that was unleashed. It first emerged in the 1830s, creating the first industrial landscape anywhere in the world. Beneath the smoke and glare from blast furnaces and forges, Black Country innovation, entrepreneurial and manufacturing skill established the regionâs supremacy for the making of wrought iron. The Black Country also possessed important hardware and other manufactures distinctive to itself â structural ironwork, chain making, locks and keys, tube manufacture, trap making and many others â which brought fame to Black Country towns across the globe.\n\nBlack Country Living Museum, Tipton Road, Dudley, West Midlands DY1 4SQ\n\nwww.bclm.com\n\nEllsmere Port, Cheshire\n\nNational Waterways Museum\n\nIs housed on a seven acre site that was previously a thriving canal docks.

Today you can still walk round the locks, docks and warehouses and visit the forge, stables and workers cottages.\n\nSouth Pier Road, Ellesmere Port, Cheshire CH65 4FW\n\nwww.nwm.org.uk\n\nElvington, York, Yorkshire\n\nYorkshire Air Museum\n\nThe Yorkshire Air Museum sits on the site of former RAF Elvington in North Yorkshire, a World War Two airfield used extensively by Allied bomber crews during the war. It is also the home of The Allied Air Forces Memorial. The Allied Air Forces Memorial and Yorkshire Air Museum is a registered charity. It receives no state or local government aid and is a not-for-profit business.\n\nThe Museum is a living memorial to all allied air forces personnel particularly those during the Second World War, and especially the tens of thousands of young people who gave their lives in that conflict. We aim to be relevant to present day generations by explaining, in a realistic way, what life was like on a typical wartime. Throughout the site you can explore aspects of design and technology dating from the 1850s right up to the present day.\n\nElvington, York YO41 4AU\n\nhttp://yorkshireairmuseum.org\n\nGlasgow, Scotland\n\nGlasgow Transport Museum\n\nThe dynamic Riverside Museum displays Glasgowâs rich industrial heritage, which stems from the River Clyde.

From ancient times man has reaped the natural treasures of the oceans â pearls and coral have been collected since at least 5000 BC. The 18th century saw an explosion of interest in recovering treasures from sunken vessels. Experimentation with diving bells was followed by the invention of the diving helmet in the 19th century â commercial diving was born. After the Second World War, sport diving became popular. Today, divers can work at depths as great as 300 m doing everything from military operations, oilfield support, salvage and construction to fish farming, archaeology, research â and even just for fun! From ancient to modern, it is all at The Diving Museum. The co-inventor of the diving helmet, John Deane, lived in Gosport from 1835 to 1845 during which time he discovered the Mary Rose. The first diving helmet ever sold by the inventors was to a Gosport mariner, Henry Abbinett. Gosport represents a natural home for the countryâs premier historical diving museum.\n\nThe Diving Museum is an outreach project of the Historical Diving Society and it is staffed entirely by volunteers.\n\nThe Diving Museum, No 2 Battery, Stokes Bay Road, Gosport, Hampshire PO12 2QU\n\nwww.thehds.com/museum\n\nGreenock, Scotland\n\nScottish Fire and Rescue Service Heritage Centre\n\nThe Fire Station, Municipal Buildings, Dalrymple Street, Greenock, Renfrewshire, PA15 1LY\n\nwww.sfrheritagetrust.org\n\nHelmshore, Lancashire\n\nHelmshore Mills Textile Museum\n\nNestling side by side in the quiet village of Helmshore in the stunning Rossendale Valley are two original Lancashire textile mills, Higher Mill and Whitakerâs Mill, together known as Helmshore Mills Textile Museum.

Certainly, slate roofing was a feature of many thirteenth century monastic buildings and it has been used as a building material in the region for many centuries. However, the first confirmed records of slate mining in Honister do not appear until the early 1700s. Quarrying on a significant scale was taking place in the 1750s and, from 1833, under the managerial eye of entrepreneur Sam Wright, the business expanded with the creation of underground mines as well as open quarries. Following the creation of the Buttermere Green Slate Company in 1879, âinclinesâ were built to carry the finished slates away. Previously, they had been carried by packhorse, or by sleds running precariously down the scree slopes to the road. After 1892, The Hause became the centre of operations and was linked to the quarries by road, tramway, aerial ropeway (1928) and huge inclines inside the mountain (1930s).\n\nHonister Pass, Borrowdale, Keswick, Cumbria CA12 5XN\n\nwww.honister.com\n\nKillhope, Cowshill, County Durham\n\nNorth of England Lead Mining Museum\n\nAlso known as Killhope, is an industrial museum that stands on the site of the former Park Level Mine, which is being restored to show the workings of a 19th century lead mine.\n\nNear Cowshill, Upper Weardale, County Durham DL13 1AR\n\nwww.killhope.org.uk\n\nLeeds, Yorkshire\n\nLeeds Industrial Museum\n\nOnce the largest woollen mill in the world, today Armley Mills tells the story of Leedsâ rich industrial heritage through the collections, exhibitions and galleries of Leeds Industrial Museum. Like many other textile mills, Armley could not cope with the combination of the loss of markets as the British Empire split up, the increase in competition from abroad and the increasing use of man-made fibres. In the early 1970s the mill finally closed as a business and, in recognition of its historic importance, the site was bought by Leeds City Council, re-opening in 1982 as Leeds Industrial Museum.\n\nLeeds Industrial Museum, Armley Mills, Canal Rd, Leeds LS12 2QF\n\nhttps://museumsandgalleries.leeds.gov.uk/leeds-industrial-museum\n\nLeyland, Lancashire\n\nBritish Commercial Vehicle Museum\n\nThis remarkable museum brings the compelling story of commercial vehicles to life.

Many images are available to purchase on-line or via the newly refurbished on-site store.\n\nKing Steet, Leyland, Lancashire PR25 2LE\n\nwww.britishcommercialvehiclemuseum.com\n\nLlanberis, Gwynedd, Wales\n\nNational Slate Museum\n\nDinorwig Quarry closed in 1969. Today, rather than fashioning wagons and forging rails â the workshops tell a very special story: the story of the Welsh slate industry.\n\nThe National Slate Museum is situated in the Victorian workshops built in the shadow of Elidir mountain, site of the vast Dinorwig quarry.\n\nThe workshops and buildings are designed as though quarrymen and engineers have just put down their tools and left the courtyard for home.\n\nLlanberis, Gwynedd LL55 4TY\n\nhttps://museum.wales/slate\n\nLondon\n\nThe Geffrye\n\nThe Geffrye explores the home from 1600 to the present day.

The collection spans over 100 years, from an 1890s horse bus to a full-size prototype Metrolink tram.\n\nOpened in 1979, the Museum is a partnership between Transport for Greater Manchester and Greater Manchester Transport Society and is an early example of successful partnership working between a local authority and a voluntary body.\n\nMotor bus services in Greater Manchester were originally operated by local authorities, with additional services provided by private companies. In 1968 the Government reorganised bus services in the metropolitan counties such as Greater Manchester and Passenger Transport Executives were created to provide local bus services instead. Known as SELNEC (South East Lancashire and North East Cheshire), the PTE was renamed Greater Manchester Transport in 1974 when Wigan was included.\n\nBoyle Street, Cheetham, Manchester M8 8UW, UK\n\nhttps://motgm.uk\n\nPeopleâs History Museum\n\nThe Peopleâs History Museum derives its origin from the Trade Union, Labour and Co-operative History Society. From the 1960s the society formed a small collection and between 1975 and 1986 ran a museum in Limehouse Town Hall in London. The collections were then in storage until the Greater Manchester authorities made a funding offer. A new trust was created and the museum re-opened in 1990, initially at 103 Princess Street.\n\nIn May 1994 new museum galleries were opened in the Pump House on Bridge Street. This is the only surviving Edwardian hydraulic pumping station in the city and it used to supply power to the warehouses and even wound the Town Hall clock and raised the curtain at the Opera House!\n\nThe museum was known as both the National Museum of Labour History and the Pump House Peopleâs History Museum. In 2001 the museum decided to use one name to embrace the whole organisation: Peopleâs History Museum.\n\nIn October 2007 the museum closed to the public to allow for the start of a multi-million pound re-development scheme. A bigger and better Peopleâs History Museum re-opened on 13 February 2010.\n\nLeft Bank, Spinningfields, Manchester M3 3ER\n\nwww.phm.org.uk\n\nScience and Industry Museum\n\nWith permanent galleries spread across five listed historic buildings and collections ranging from early textile machinery to modern X-ray equipment, thereâs a lot to learn about MOSI.

Visitors can walk through the back kitchen of a small terraced house to see how a worker in a hat factory might have lived in the late 19th century, when hatting became an urban occupation.\n\nThe late 19th century was the heyday of the hat, and Stockportâs hatting industry became large and prosperous at this time. Hat Works has a good collection of twentieth century British hats, including top hats, bowler hats, trilbies, homburgs, 1950s/60s ladies synthetic hats, and all kinds of hats dating from the 1930s to the 1970s. We also have spectacular examples of the very best in couture millinery on display.\n\nAbout 250 of these hats can be seen in thematic displays in the museum, with an approximately equal but ever-growing number of hats in store, waiting to take their place on display.\n\nTo complement the museumâs existing collection, Hat Works are currently concentrating on collecting hats made before 1900, hats from other countries, and hats made by modern designers.\n\nHat Works has a unique collection of hatting machinery. As the fur felt hatting industry began to decline in the 1960s and 70s, curators acquired a range of Victorian-style machinery from hat factories facing closure. After a good hundred years of prosperity for the industry, hats had gone out of fashion. This might have been because hairstyles had become popular, and cars meant that when travelling, oneâs head did not get so cold. By 1998 there were no hat factories left in Stockport.\n\nThe felt hatting industry had mechanised in a piecemeal fashion from the mid nineteenth to the early twentieth century, with machines gradually replacing each stage of the manual hatting process. The industry retained this one-machine-for-one-process approach until the end. With approximately 45 different processes going into making one hat, the mechanical variety at Hat Works is astounding.\n\nA tour round Hat Works ground floor allows the visitor to see most of the machines in the museumâs collection. They sift and clean fur, shape hats, shrink hats, stiffen and dye hats, bend brims and trim hats. Many of them still work, and demonstrators are on hand to start them up. Also on display is a comprehensive selection of hand tools used for hat making. Hat Works opened on Easter Monday 2000, three years after the closure of Christysâ, the last local hat factory.\n\nHat Works is located in Wellington Mill, built in 1828 by leading Industrialist Thomas Marsland to help accommodate the burgeoning cotton industry. There is, however, a hatting connection, as the firm of Ward Brothers occupied part of the building from the 1890s to the 1930s.\n\nWellington Mill was one of the first fireproof mills, making it extremely expensive to build and only an option for the wealthiest of factory owners. The mill was built with cast iron columns and brick vaults, which are filled with sand. The ceiling cavities were also filled with sand. There are 2 rows of 14 cast iron columns on each floor and cast iron roof trusses, which are very unusual. At 7 stories tall, Wellington Mill is one of the tallest mills in Stockport. The 200 foot chimney, which is a famous Stockport landmark, was added in 1860.\n\nWellington Mill, Wellington Road South, Stockport, Cheshire SK3 0EU\n\nwww.hatworks.org.uk\n\nStyal, Wilmslow, Cheshire\n\nQuarry Bank Mill and Styal Estate\n\nOne of Britainâs greatest industrial heritage sites, shows how a complete industrial community lived. Quarry Bank overflows with the atmosphere of the Industrial Revolution. Contains the cotton mill, powered by Europeâs most powerful working waterwheel. See the Apprentice House, which housed the pauper children who worked in the mill and also see Styal village, built by the mill owners the Gregs to house the mill workers.\n\nDemonstrations on how cotton was processed into cloth are offered.\n\nStyal, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9 4LA\n\nhttps://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/cheshire-greater-manchester/quarry-bank\n\nSwansea, Wales\n\nNational Waterfront Museum\n\nTells the story of industry and innovation in Wales, now and over the last 300 years. The Industrial Revolution in Wales had a tremendous effect on People, Communities and Lives as well as that of the rest of the World.\n\nNational Waterfront Museum, Oystermouth Road, Maritime Quarter, Swansea SA1 3RD\n\nhttps://museum.wales/swansea\n\nTelford, Shropshire\n\nIronbridge Gorge Museum\n\nThe Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust was established in 1967 to preserve and interpret the remains of the Industrial Revolution in the six square miles of the Ironbridge Gorge. Responsible to a Board of Trustees, the Museum staff manages 35 historic sites within the World Heritage Site of the Ironbridge Gorge, ten of which are museums.\n\nAs well as ten museums, the sites also include a research library, a tourist information centre, two youth hostels, archaeological sites, historic woodlands, housing, two chapels, and two Quaker burial grounds.\n\nCoach Road, Coalbrookdale, Telford TF8 7DQ\n\nwww.ironbridge.org.uk\n\nWakefield, Yorkshire\n\nNational Coal Mining Museum\n\nIn 1988 the Yorkshire Mining Museum opened at Caphouse Colliery. It was established with funding from West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Councils, Wakefield and Kirklees Metropolitan District Councils and technical support and assistance from British Coal. The Museum was granted national status in 1995. Following this the Department for Culture, Media and Sport carried out a detailed study into the Museum, and in 1998 provided funding which secured its long-term future. In 2001 the Museum received a Heritage Lottery Fund Grant of just over £4.5 million. The Museum raised just under £2 million to complement this grant. Work carried out using this money included restoring buildings, new gallery areas and the store for large machinery.\n\nCaphouse Colliery, New Road, Overton, Wakefield WF4 4RH\n\nwww.ncm.org.uk\n\nWoodhorn, Northumberland\n\nWoodhorn Museum\n\nFor more than 80 years Woodhorn was a coal mine. Work to sink the first shaft began in 1894 and the first coal was brought to the surface in 1898. At its peak almost 2,000 men worked at the pit and 600,000 tons of coal was produced each year. Production stopped in 1981 but the shafts continued to be used for neighbouring Ashington Colliery until 1986.\n\nIt began its life as a museum in 1989 and following major redevelopment, reopened in October 2006. Today, the yellow Ashington brick buildings have protected, listed status. The site is recognised as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and it is the best surviving example of a late 19th/early 20th century colliery in the North East tradition.\n\nWoodhorn, QEII Country Park, Ashington, Northumberland NE63 9YF\n\nwww.experiencewoodhorn.com\n\nYork, Yorkshire\n\nNational Railway Museum\n\nIncluding over 100 locomotives and nearly 200 other items of rolling stock, tells the railway story from the early 19th century to the present day.\n\nLeeman Road, York YO26 4XJ\n\nwww.nrm.org.uk\n\nNational Railway Museum âSafety Movementâ Gallery\n\nIn August 1913 the Great Western Railway introduced a campaign that changed the way Britain tried to prevent accidental deaths and injuries. The âSafety Movementâ used photographs, booklets and competitions to persuade workers to avoid dangers.\n\nSafety education showed workers what to do and what not to do, an idea which became enormously influential. It has been used ever since by the railway industry for both workers and passengers.\n\nThis eye-catching and visual approach to preventing deaths and injuries also spread throughout other industries and was soon found across British society, tackling road and home safety. It remains important today, as seen in the annual Christmas anti-drink-driving campaign.\n\nDiscover the story of railway safety over the last 100 years in this gallery of highlights from the National Railway Museumâs collection. Explore the attempts to prevent injuries and deaths amongst workers, passengers and children, and the lasting influence of the Great Western Railwayâs innovative safety campaign.\n\nBased on research by Dr Mike Esbester and funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.
