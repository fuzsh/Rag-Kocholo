In addition, there are north-west European Iron Age coins, and coins from Parthia, South Asia and China.\n\nArchaeology exhibitions are a popular feature of Manchester Museum's public programme. Over the last ten years, several temporary exhibitions have been shown, including Lindow Man A Bog Body Mystery, Figurines from Koma Land Ghana, Whitworth Park: Pleasure, Play and Politics, Making Monuments on Rapa Nui, Nature Through Roman Eyes and a UK touring show, Gifts for the Gods: Animal Mummies Revealed.\n\nBlogs\n\nKeep up to date with archaeology-related activities at the Manchester Museum by reading the following blogs:\n\nAncient Worlds\n\nEgypt at the Manchester Museum\n\nEvents"
