This list is not definitive and will be added to. You may also be surprised at what is to be discovered at your local museum too!\n\nThe museum has important world cultures collections ,as well as being home to part of the Edward Lovett collection of charms, amulets and talismans (although these are classified as \"superstitions\"). Unfortunately it is closed whilst the building is restored following a serious fire in 2013, but is expected to reopen in 2019. Some of the collection can be viewed on the web-site however.\n\nOne of the top archaeological and world cultures museums in the country, the Pitt Rivers has an extensive colection of amulets and charms from around the world, including the collection of Adrien de Mortillet and another part of that gathered by Edward Lovett.\n\nHome to an outstanding collection from around the world, from ancient Egypt to modern Japan, the BM also houses iconic British objects, including the Sutton Hoo treasure, Dr. John Dee's scrying equipment, and the Grimes Graves Chalk Goddess.\n\nAlthough the extent to which freemasonry is related to magic is debated, some of the higher orders are in the area of ceremonial magic and the developmental mysteries are both inspired by ancient practice and in turn a foundation and inspiration to modern magical orders, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, as well as Wicca. The museum is home to an extensive collection of all things related to freemasonry and sub-masonic fraternal societies."
