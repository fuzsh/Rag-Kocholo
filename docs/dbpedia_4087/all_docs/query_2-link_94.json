        "text": "One of the many things our capital does very well is arts and culture – the amount of museums in London is pretty impressive. The city has such a bounty of world-renowned institutions that it can be hard to know which to visit first: from cutting-edge London exhibitions at the Tate Modern to Hope, the huge skeleton of a blue whale at the Natural History Museum. Alongside the big names, there’s also a trove of smaller, more eclectic London museums to explore, where you can find everything from a history of cereal packets to a taxidermy walrus with his own Twitter page. Discover the best museums in London, including the top free-entry spots.\n\nAre all museums in London free?\n\nThere are a variety of museums in London that offer free entry, but a select few do require an admission fee. However, many of the best museums in London are free to attend, which means you can enjoy all the art and history the city has to offer without worrying about the cost. Be sure to explore the British Museum's (London's biggest museum!) sprawling galleries or lose yourself in the works of Georgia O'Keeffe and Andry Warhol at Tate Modern.\n\nWhat is the most visited museum in London?\n\nAccording to 2021 data, The Natural History Museum and the British Museum are two of the most visited museums in London. Both offer unique experiences, with The Natural Museum being the perfect visit for animal lovers, while the British Museum is an architect's dream.\n\nFree museums in London"
