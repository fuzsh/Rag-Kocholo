        "text": "Third dialogue: with Federica Gonzato and Nick Merriman\n\nModerated by Corinna Riva\n\nThis event will be held in Italian and English, with English simultaneous translation.\n\nEuropean museums of archaeology interact with a wide range of communities. Their educational mission is particularly important today, as the cultural diversity of these communities is greater than ever before; even local museums work in contexts that are no longer as ethnically or culturally homogenous as they once were.\n\nHow should all such institutions be inclusive, and pay attention to the diversity of visitors, particularly addressing those who might not find traditional museum presentations accessible or interesting to them? What vision should archaeological museums have to address the debates surrounding the role of the past in contemporary European societies? These questions will be addressed by three dialogues between directors of Italian and British national, regional and local museums.\n\nThe series is hosted by the Italian Cultural Institute in London, curated by UCL archaeologists Corinna Riva and Andrew Gardner, and supported by the Institute of Classical Studies, London, the Accordia Research Centre, the ‘UCL-in-Rome’ initiative, and the British School at Rome.\n\n[BOOK NOW]\n\nFederica Gonzato studied conservation of cultural heritage at Udine University. She got a PhD in Proto-History, Prehistory and Ancient History of the Mediterranean Sea at Florence University, and spent many research and study periods at the Italian Archaeologic School, Athens. From October 2013 to December 2016 Federica was Director of the National Archaeologic Museum in Fratta Polesine. In November 2015 she was appointed Director of the National Archaeologic Museum in Verona and Director of the Museum Villa del Bene in Dolcè (Verona).\n\nFederica has been Director of the National Museum in Este (Padua) since September 2016.\n\n(source: Università degli Studi di Verona-Amministrazione Trasparente)\n\nNick Merriman studied archaeology at Cambridge University, and began his career at the Museum of London in 1986, as Curator of Prehistory and subsequently Head of the Department of Early London History and Collections. Nick was Reader in Museum Studies, at University College, London. Subsequently he was appointed as Director of the Manchester Museum.\n\nNick has been the CEO of the Horniman Museum since May 2018.\n\nCorinna Riva is Associate Professor in Mediterranean Archaeology at UCL, specialised in East-West interaction and comparative archaeology of Iron Age and 1st-millennium BC Italy and Mediterranean. Among her publications: The urbanisation of Etruria: funerary ritual and social change, 700-600 BC. New York: Cambridge University Press."
