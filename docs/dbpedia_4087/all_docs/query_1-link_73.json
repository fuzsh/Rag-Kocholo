        "text": "Egyptologist and author Dr Campbell Price has been announced as the new Chair of Trustees at the Egypt Exploration Society (EES) – the UK’s leading charity supporting archaeological fieldwork and research in Egypt.\n\nDr Campbell Price, 36, who lives in Liverpool, Merseyside, has been Curator of Egypt and Sudan at Manchester Museum for the last decade where he has redeveloped some of their galleries and organised some award-winning exhibits.\n\nThe museum is home to one of the UK's most significant Egyptology collections.\n\nOriginally from Glasgow, Dr Price was awarded a Blue Peter badge for mummifying an orange live on children's television.\n\nHe has published widely on ancient Egyptian material culture and has lectured extensively throughout the UK and internationally and regularly comments and advises on Egyptological themes for TV and radio.\n\nDr Price explained: “I am taking on the Chair at the EES at an incredibly exciting time for Egyptology. Next year marks both the bicentenary of the decipherment of hieroglyphs and the centenary of the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun.\n\n“And it is in Egypt that the most significant developments are taking place – including a range of newly opened museums and heritage sites. This includes the world-class Grand Egyptian Museum at Giza which will showcase material from Tutankhamun’s tomb. Some of the most significant objects in Egyptian and international museums were uncovered in the course of EES excavations and it was the EES that first sent a young Howard Carter to Egypt, where he was to become arguably the world’s most famous archaeologist.\n\n“As the EES reaches its 140th anniversary in 2022, it is an important chance to contextualise the work of the Society and its practitioners in terms of our understanding of Egyptian heritage today.\n\n\"One of the twin aims of Manchester Museum is to build understanding between cultures of the past and present, and the EES embodies this mission.”\n\nDr Carl Graves, Director of the EES added:\n\n“I’m excited to be working with Dr Price as we continue to transform the Egypt Exploration Society for the twenty-first century and engage people all over the world with the remarkable and unique heritage of Egypt.”\n\nThe EES remains committed to working for the preservation of Egyptian cultural heritage – whether that is through its extensive online events programme, or through the steady reopening of its collections to researchers.\n\nMore information on EES events and details on how to book can be found on the EES website here.\n\nMembers can receive discounted rates for courses. For information on how to become a member of the EES, visit the website here.\n\nGet all the latest news, updates, things to do and more from your local InYourArea feed."
