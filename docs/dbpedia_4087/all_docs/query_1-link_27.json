        "text": "This week, Manchester Museum is involved in not one, but two festivals!\n\nThe Civilisations Festival, connected with the BBC ‘Civilisations’ series – the first episode of which was aired last night – and also the Wonder Women Festival, celebrating pioneering women across Manchester. As part of this celebration we are running a series of blog posts about the women who have shaped Manchester Museum, our collection, and the University of Manchester.\n\nHave a look at our post about Christabel Pankhurst on the #WonderWomen blog.\n\nMargaret Murray is the focus for today’s Story from the Museum Floor, and is today’s featured Wonder Woman. She was a pioneer – an Egyptologist who shook the institutional foundations, improving the status of women, but also by targeting some of her publications, lectures and classes for a general audience, she extended Egyptology beyond academia, telling the stories of the treasures, myths and history of an ancient civilisation…\n\nWomen and Egyptology at Manchester\n\nFrom archaeologists to academics, from the curious to the curators, there is a long history of women in Egyptology at Manchester Museum. These are the pioneers who have made and shaped our collection and have impacted significantly on Egyptology becoming not just an academic discipline, but at the forefront of an interdisciplinary approach, which a century on, is something that is being advocated and championed by universities worldwide. Here is the story of one of those women …\n\nMargaret Murray\n\nMargaret Alice Murray (1863-1963) was born on 13 July 1963 in Calcutta, British India, the daughter of wealthy English parents, and her life was to take her on ground-breaking adventures across the archaeological and theoretical landscapes of Egyptology, folklore and feminist political reform.\n\nMargaret Murray in 1928 (Image from the National Portrait Gallery)\n\nIt has been suggested that her early years growing up in India had a lasting impact on her life, Amara Thornton considers that Margaret Murray had a “hybrid transnational identity” that was both British and Indian.\n\nAlthough she had no formal learning before studying at University College, London, Margaret and her sister, Mary, were given a strong Christian education by their uncle, John, a vicar who believed in the inferiority of women – these were both things that Murray would reject through her career, however it was uncle John who ignited her passion for archaeology.\n\nMummies and Manchester\n\nMargaret Murray is perhaps best-known in Manchester for the unwrapping of mummy, Khnum-Nakht, one of Manchester Museum’s famous residents, popularly known with Nakht-Ankh, as the ‘Two Brothers’.\n\nHer Egyptology career began in 1894, when she commenced study at University College, London, in the newly opened department of Egyptology, learning hieroglyphs under the Francis Llewelyn Griffith, and while her classmates were struggling, with the aid of a grammar book by Adolf Erman and her fluency in German, she began to forge ahead. It was at UCL that she developed both a professional relationship and a friendship with William Matthew Flinders Petrie, producing the drawings for the publications of his excavations at Qift and Koptos. Petrie encouraged her to publish her research and it was he who appointed her as Junior Lecturer in 1899, making her the first female lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom – the first of several pioneering firsts for Murray!\n\nMargaret Murray was very aware of British Egyptomania, and recognised that along with an academic interest, there was a popular fascination around ancient Egypt, and to supplement her income from lecturing gave public classes and lectures at the British Museum and at Manchester Museum.\n\nUnwrappng Khnum-Nakht\n\nAnd following the excavations at Deir Rifa in 1907, and the receipt of the entire tomb group of the ‘Two Brothers’, in 1908 it was Margaret Murray herself who led the unwrapping of Khnum-Nakht. This was the first time that a woman had publicly unwrapped a mummy.\n\nThis unwrapping was not just remarkable because Murray was a woman. The unwrapping of mummies through the nineteenth century had rather been ‘unrollings’, a curiosity, even a voyeuristic experience of ‘undressing’ and exotic Egyptian princess…\n\nMurray’s unwrapping took an interdisciplinary approach and has been hailed as the beginning of what has become known as the ‘Manchester Method’. And the ‘Two Brothers’ continue to reveal their secrets through scientific methods, very recently DNA testing has confirmed the identity of our two elderly residents as half-brothers.\n\nEgyptologist and Pioneer\n\nMargaret Murray’s impact on academic Egyptology has often been overshadowed by the achievements of WMF Petrie, but Murray was an acclaimed archaeologist and a researcher in her own right.\n\nHer first fieldwork in Egypt was as part of Petrie’s 1902-3 excavation in Abydos, and then during the following season in Saqqara. The publication of her transcriptions and translations of the inscriptions on the mastaba tombs at Saqqara proved particularly influential within the Egyptological community, with Petrie recognising Murray’s contribution to his own career.\n\nMargaret Murray had joined the Abydos excavation as the site nurse… However, Petrie himself taught her how to excavate, and consequently she was given a senior position on the site. Perhaps unsurprisingly for the time, there were many workers on the site who did not want to take orders from a woman.\n\nMurray was a strong and determined woman, and this experience, along with discussions with other female excavators (some of whom were active in the feminist movement) that shaped her future involvement in Feminist campaigning.\n\nFeminist and Campaigner\n\nMurray was an Egyptologist and an archaeologist in a man’s world. This was a world that she, and many others around her fought to change. She joined the Pankhursts’ Women’s Social and Political Union, took an active role at protests and marches, including the 1907 Mud March and the Women’s Coronation Procession in June 2011.\n\nWater-colour portrait of Margaret Murray by her former student, Winifred Brunton; it is dated 1917, when Murray would have been 53 or 54 (photo: Stuart Laidlaw; UCL Art Museum – Image from Archaeology International)\n\nJust as she found out in the field, Margaret Murray lectured at University College at a time when academia was likewise a difficult place to find your way as a woman – despite her lectureship, UCL was not to appoint a female professor until 1949. Therefore, she spent much time at UCL campaigning on behalf of both staff and students for an improvement women’s status, facilities and working conditions at the University.\n\nAnd it is said that if campaigning failed, she could always resort to witchcraft…\n\nThe Grandmother of Wicca\n\nAt Manchester Museum, Murray is famed as an Egyptologist, however, during the First World War, with no possibility of continuing excavations in Egypt, ever the researcher, Murray turned her focus to folklore and the witch-cult hypothesis – the theory that the witch trials of Early Modern Christendom were an attempt to extinguish a surviving pre-Christian pagan religion devoted to a Horned God.\n\nMargaret Murray appears never to have been afraid of taking risks, and although her comprehensive publication on witchcraft have since been academically discredited, her work had a lasting impact on the emerging religious movement, and consequently becoming known as ‘The Grandmother of Wicca’.\n\nOn the shoulders of giants\n\nMargaret Murray celebrated her 100th birthday on 13 July 1963, with a speech and presentation being made in her honour.\n\nMargaret Murray at the celebration of her 100th birthday. (Image from Archaeology International)\n\nShe died later that year on 13th November, leaving an indelible mark, paving the way for so many female Egyptologists, academics and researcher …\n\n… Living, studying and working in Manchester, it has been very easy to be both a woman and an Egyptologist, and perhaps even easier to take this combination for granted.\n\nMargaret Murray is one among many pioneering women connected with the University of Manchester upon whose shoulders we stand.\n\nMichelle Scott\n\nFind out more about Egypt and Sudan at Manchester Museum on the Curator’s blog, Egypt Manchester.\n\nYou can read about some more of Manchester’s pioneering women on our #WonderWomen site."
