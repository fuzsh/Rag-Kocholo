Displays cover trade unionism (the museum is the holder of the largest collection of trade union banners), the women’s suffrage movement, the cooperative movement, the 1945 general election and football. Digital interactives and period displays bring the museum’s unique collections and stories to life.\n\nTo give an idea of the diversity of the items held by the museum, they range from Hayley Cropper’s red anorak from Coronation Street which highlights the rights and changes to the representation of the LGBT+ community through to a Suffragette banner used by Emmeline Pankhurst during some of her most significant speeches in Manchester.\n\nAs well as tackling current ideological theory, the museum looks to the past and its collection has items relating to the Peterloo Massacre, the infamous meeting at St. Peter’s Field (now the Central Library) which turned into a disaster when the local Yeomanry were ordered to contain the 60,000 strong crowd, killing 15 and wounding over 600 in the process.\n\nAn exciting programme of public talks, performances and events add to the displays and take them further and entry is free to the museum, though donations are appreciated.\n\nLocated at the edge of the Spinningfields district of the city, you could combine a visit to the museum with a visit to the restaurants and pubs there, or take a wander down Deansgate’s shopping area.\n\nShould you fancy delving deeper into Manchester’s Social History and its nation impact we can recommend visiting:\n\nWorking Class Movement Library - 51 Crescent, Salford, M5 4WX\n\nYou’ll find the walls not just full of books but covered in posters, paintings and other visual material to represent the diverse voices of the working classes.\n\nwcml.org.uk\n\nThe Central Library, St. Peter’s Square, M2 5PD\n\nThe library holds a unique archive of documents relating to the event which you could explore in the surroundings of the incredible domed Wolfson Reading Room.\n\npankhursttrust.org\n\nThe Pankhurst Centre, 60-62 Nelson Street, M13 9WP\n\nThe only museum dedicated to telling the story of women’s right to vote and the Suffragette movement.\n\nPeople’s History Museum, Left Bank, Spinningfields, Manchester M3 3ER\n\nphm.org.uk\n\nOpen: Wed - Sun 10am-4pm\n\nfree entry, suggested donation £5\n\nRecommended visit time: 2-3 hours\n\nElizabeth Gaskell’s House\n\nLocated near to Manchester’s University Quarter, no trip to Manchester would be complete without walking in the footsteps of one of Manchester’s most famous writers.\n\nWith the aim to celebrate the life and literature of Elizabeth Gaskell, it celebrates one of the most important writers of the C19th.\n\nHer work will be familiar to anyone immersed in the sweeping Sunday evening epics of North and South or Judi Dench’s portrayal in Cranford.\n\nPenning the novels Cranford, North and South and Wives and Daughters amongst others, Elizabeth Gaskell lived in this now Grade II listed building from 1850 to 1865.\n\nThe house also played host to a who’s who of the 19th century literary sphere with Charles Dickens, Charlotte Bronte and Harriet Beecher Stowe visitors to the house.\n\nRooms in the house including the Drawing Room, Study, Dining Room and most recent addition Elizabeth’s bedroom have been restored to their 1857 look.\n\nMuch of the inspiration for the likely style of the house comes from Elizabeth’s own letters with period furniture and even a rescued Victorian pattern for the carpets reused to bring the house to life.\n\nYou are encouraged to immerse yourself in the period, stay and enjoy the house.
