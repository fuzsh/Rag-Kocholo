        "text": "It is easy to become a bit of a cultural snob when you live in or near London – some of the world’s best museums are on your doorstep, packed full of everything from Maori artefacts to the Elgin marbles and priceless masterpieces by Turner and Vermeer.\n\nBut get out of the capital and there are just as many amazing treasures to see. Head north to Manchester and you’ll find one of Britain’s best museums – the Manchester Museum. Although the museum is currently undergoing a multi-million pound refurbishment, and some galleries are closed during this process, on a visit I made a few years ago I got a sense of its incredible and varied collections.\n\nManchester has a rich mercantile history, and it’s therefore not surprising that its museum owes its origins thanks to the collections of local businessman and cotton manufacturer John Leigh Phillips. On his death in 1821 a band of wealthy businessmen bought his collections of books, art and natural history specimens, creating the Manchester Natural History Society.\n\nIn 1868 the collections were passed to Owens College, which would eventually become the University of Manchester, and a new building to house the growing collections, designed by Alfred Waterhouse, was opened in 1890. The Manchester Museum continued to grow in the early 20th century, thanks in part to donations made by local grandee Jesse Haworth (1835-1921) who had a keen interest in Egyptology.\n\nToday the Museum stretches over a number of historic buildings and modern extensions in the heart of the city, and the varied collections have grown to over 6 million objects.\n\nFor me the Manchester Museum is sort of “Night at the Museum” come to life, and it must seem that way for wide-eyed children who walk through its fossils and animals collections, with everything from a t-rex and an elephant skeleton, to cases bursting with taxidermy animals from around the world.\n\nBut of course my favourite galleries are invariably the Egyptian ones, which are sadly closed during the museum’s refurbishment. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the museum received many Egyptian objects through their support of excavation work by the Egypt Exploration Society, British School of Archaeology in Egypt and the Liverpool School of Archaeology.\n\nSome of the museum’s objects were uncovered by Sir William Flinders Petrie (1853-1942), whose work was supported by Jesse Haworth, who became enthralled by Egypt after a visit there in 1880. Haworth donated his personal collection of Egyptian antiquities to the Manchester Museum.\n\nThe Egyptian Dept at Manchester includes over 16,000 objects, making it one of the largest Egyptian collections in the UK. There are statues, ushabi, sculptures, and of course a few mummies too. There is even a granite column from an Egyptian temple.\n\nThere is also a lovely granodiorite bust of the goddess Sekhmet, found at Bubastis, with finely carved whiskers and crowned with a sun-disc and uraeus. However, the objects I am most drawn to are the smaller, more personal items – a simple bracelet, a perfume bottle, a shabti with a personal prayer for the afterlife. It is these small objects that bring us closer to people in the past.\n\nIt is these little objects that are the real treasures – they offer a window onto the people and places of the distant past, and can often lead to a better understanding of who we are today.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how these objects will be re-displayed when the refurbishment works at the Manchester Museum are done – their displays were incredibly interactive and interesting in 2016, so it will be fascinating to see what the curators come up with.\n\nSo, if you are fascinated by archaeology, natural history and this magnificent planet of ours, head to the Manchester Museum. Even though some galleries are closed right now, you will find something to inspire you. The £13 million pound refurbishment project should be completed by 2021, and I will certainly be heading back to see how things progress.\n\n(a version of this article was first publish on AncientEgyptHeritage.wordpress in 2016)"
