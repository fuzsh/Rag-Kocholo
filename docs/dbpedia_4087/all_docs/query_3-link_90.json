China’s involvement, and the profound impact this was to have in the subsequent unfolding of its history of revolution and war, is one, however, that receives little attention in the West. This lecture aims to explore this wartime encounter between China and the West, focusing on the much neglected part played by Chinese Labour Corps at the Western front. Recruited by the British and French Armies to help alleviate acute shortages in manpower, this workforce numbered some 140,000 men by the time of the Armistice of 1918. What were the circumstances which brought these workers to France? And what of their experiences in a foreign land and the knowledge of the West that they brought back when they were repatriated? What influences did these have in the shaping of China’s emerging national consciousness, and its search for a distinctive modernity?\n\nUrban Naturalist: Weather\n\nSat 27 Sep, 2-4pm\n\nBook on 0161 275 2648 or museum@manchester.ac.uk, £3, adults\n\nJoin Michael Flynn to find out more about the weather station that was once in Whitworth Park and to learn more about the current weather recording undertaken by the University of Manchester.\n\nWonderstruck Singing Workshop\n\nSat 27 & Sun 28 Sep, 1.30-4.30pm\n\nDrop-in, free, adults\n\nWould you like to perform in Manchester Museum as part of a remarkable Weekend of Wonder?
