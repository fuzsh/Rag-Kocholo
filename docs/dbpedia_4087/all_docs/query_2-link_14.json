        "text": "Manchester is in my top-5 cities to visit in the UK apart from London, and it’s all because of its amazing architecture and cultural influence.\n\nVisiting Manchester Cathedral, walking along the Manchester Ship Canal and River Irwell, strolling along the Chinatown, peaking at Manchester Town Hall, seeing the city from above are all great activities to do in this city but this time I’d like to show you the museums of Manchester!\n\n1. Museum of Science and Industry\n\nMuseum of Science and Industry is a must visit if you want to understand Manchester: once called Cottonopolis, this city was in the very centre of the industrial history and scientific discoveries of the whole country! Due to the cotton and textiles production, it became prosperous, advanced but also acquired some hate from other areas of the UK – If you read North and South, you know what I’m talking about.\n\nCurrently a multi-million-pound restoration programme of the museum is underway.\n\n2.Manchester Museum\n\nManchester Museum at University of Manchester will provide you with exhibits on natural history, anthropology and archeology. It’s not very big but is definitely worth an hour or more of your time: dinosaurs, mummies, links between Manchester and China The museum has just reopened after an expensive restoration.\n\nBy the way, you can have a tour around Manchester University too: did you know that Owens College there is England’s first civic university?\n\n3.Manchester Art Gallery\n\nThe Manchester Art Gallery occupying three connecting buildings was one of my top reasons to visit the city: it has such an amazing collection of Pre-Raphaelites, especially William Holman Hunt and John William Waterhouse! There are more things to see there too as the objects exhibited cover over 6 centuries of art.\n\n4.The John Rylands Library\n\nThe John Rylands Research Institute and Library is a magnificent place undeniably evoking the Hogwarts vibes because it’s built in Victorian Gothic style. This is not surprising, since inside this late Victorian building looks fascinating. The library itself was founded by Enriqueta Augustina Rylands in memory of her husband, John, and opened to the public in 1900.\n\nThe library’s collection is amazing: it includes a huge amount of mediaeval manuscripts, a collection of William Caxton’s prints including a 1476 edition of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales and Gutenberg Bible!\n\n5.Elizabeth Gaskell’s House\n\nThe House of Elizabeth Gaskell, the famous British writer and author of Cranford, North and South and Wives and Daughters, her husband William and their daughters is another museum to visit at Manchester. Elizabeth lived here from 1850 to 1865. Every room shows you not only the different sides of Gaskell’s life – her major works were written here – but also makes you reflect on different events of her time.\n\nYou might also like my other blogs about England:\n\nHarrogate\n\nWindsor\n\nOxford\n\nBath\n\nEastbourne\n\nYork: guide\n\nYork: museums\n\nDurham\n\nTop-ten British cities\n\nBibury\n\nLewes Castle\n\nWimpole Hall\n\nCottesbrooke Estate\n\nWaverley Abbey\n\nEnglish Lavender\n\nThe Grove Hotel\n\nRushton Hotel and Spa\n\nChristmas holidays in British countryside"
