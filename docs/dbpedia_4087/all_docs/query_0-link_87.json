        "meta_description": "Egyptian mummies are at the centre of attention of most Egyptology collections. Their dual nature as bodies (human remains) and artefacts make them peculiar museum objects and, consequently, they have been left out of the debate concerning the collection, retention and display of human remains. This paper aims to reinvigorate the debate over the display of Egyptian mummies in museums by addressing three points: the ‘object habits’ of collectors which led to the building up of mummy collections, the specificity of mummies and how it has been addressed by UK museum authorities, and finally, the new modes of display, making a case for a better understanding of human remains collections through the use of object biographies.",

        "text": "3An examination of the cultural histories and object biographies of Egyptian human remains raises the questions: how is the identity of the Egyptian mummy framed in the museum space, and what are the variables involved in changing attitudes towards these objects? Examining permanent and temporary displays in the UK, this paper seeks to open up a debate concerning the study and display of Egyptian human remains.\n\nMuseum artefacts and medical corpses: the collecting of mummies\n\n4The extensive and diverse history of the mummy’s entry into European culture and its subsequent admission into scientific Egyptology has meant that many of the reasons mummies were collected have been lost or forgotten. The cultural histories behind the building up of private and public collections of Egyptian human remains, which have been dismissed as accidental and with little incidence on both the reception of the mummy and the display of Egyptian human remains, illustrate how the identity of Egyptian mummies was constantly evolving as the mummy entered different contexts. The British Museum’s mummy collection, the largest outside of Egypt, was begun by its founding donor, Sir Hans Sloane (1660-1753), who collected at least three Egyptian mummies. It was, however, the donation of another collector, Colonel Lethieullier, a former member of the short-lived Egyptian Society in London, which attracted public attention on the opening of the museum on 15 January 1759. Thus, the origin of the British Museum collections lies in contemporary sociocultural practices that predate the museum. On entering the museum, however, with greater exposure to the public and evolving institutional practices, the mummy was bound to change. A further change would take place a century later when most other human remains were moved to the new British Museum (Natural History), ensuring that the Egyptian mummies at the British Museum would be perceived as archaeological, rather than biological, remains.\n\nDisplaying human remains in UK museums: the specificity of the mummy\n\n6While the presence of the dead body in museums in the UK has led to debate, it has been the controversy surrounding the holding of indigenous remains from other parts of the world that has forced a change of attitude. The active contribution of human remains in the understanding of past cultures is undeniable: human remains offer a lens through which researchers can contribute to the advancement of the archaeological understanding of the past, as well as contemporary concerns such as the development of diseases and climate change. Such research, however, no longer goes unchallenged by groups concerned with their identities, their cultural and religious beliefs, and the possession of their ancestors. By the end of the twentieth century, museums faced a major dilemma: could human remains be displayed in museums?\n\nThe future of mummy display: a case for object biographies\n\n9Object biographies are a means through which the cultural histories of Egyptian mummies and museum displays can coalesce around the shared aim of presenting the mummy as the embodiment of its different identities: archaeological artefact, corpse, pathologist’s specimen, and also, image of a mythical figure.\n\n11In recent years, the development of bioarchaeology and forensic archaeology has led to an ever-evolving understanding of conditions of life and death of the Egyptian bodies in museum collections. The data collected have been gradually included in museum exhibitions, for example, through videos explaining the Mummy Tissue Bank at the Manchester Museum. The potential of X-rays was realised in the 1890s although the solidified resins used in the mummification process impaired the clarity of images. The issue was addressed by the development of computerised axial tomography. CT- scans are used as a metaphor for transparency in museum displays, allowing the visitor to uncover data on the bodies they are encountering. The 2014 Ancient Lives, New Discoveries exhibition at the British Museum offered the visitor the opportunity to virtually unwrap Egyptian mummies through the use of enhanced digital technology."
