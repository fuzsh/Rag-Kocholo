What sets this Gallery apart from other displays of South Asia is the way the community has been involved in every aspect of its being, right from the inception of the gallery's idea as a reflective space for the diaspora to its execution. It is a joint effort by The Manchester Museum, The British Museum, and The South Asia Gallery Collective. The South Asia Gallery Collective is a group of thirty-plus individuals of the South Asian diaspora in Manchester belonging to different fields, including science, journalism, fashion, history, etc. The focus is on putting the personal stories of these people at the forefront and then weaving narratives with the wider topics these personal memoirs spoke of. Hence, the gallery has been divided into six themes: Past & Present, Lived Environments, Innovation & Language, Sound, Music & Dance, British Asian, and Movement & Empire.\n\nWhile the entire gallery experience was wonderful, certain aspects stood out the most. Firstly, the clear depiction of British colonialism and imperialism through the stories of the Collective members as well as the exhibits is such an important one because more often than not, museums and art galleries have refused to acknowledge provenance and decolonization. These histories are often traumatic and it would have been difficult for a lot of members to put them forward. But, they understood that it was critical for them to come forward. Also, the effects of colonization have been shown in the present scenario as well, putting into perspective just how damaging it was. An interactive installation in the Sound, Music & Dance section features renditions of popular and indie music from South Asian artists. It was blissful to be able to listen to such music and freely dance in the gallery because I believe everyone has their own way of perceiving and experiencing. Other poignant objects included a bulletin board containing flyers, magazine pages and pamphlets of queer spaces for South Asians from the 1990s, showcasing how South Asian queers fought to establish safe environments and become visible in a society that is homophobic to this day. A projection with three screens displayed cultural traditions of the people, with renditions of songs like \"Morni Banke\" and \"Baharo Phool Barsao\" playing."
