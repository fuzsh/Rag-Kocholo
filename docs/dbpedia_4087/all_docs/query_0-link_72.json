        "text": "Nick Merriman, OBE, esteemed director of the Horniman Museum and Gardens in South London, boasts a distinguished career in the museum sector. His previous role as director of the Manchester Museum in Manchester, England, was preceded by significant contributions at the Museum of London and University College London. Merriman's academic achievements were recognized in April 2017 when the University of Manchester appointed him as an honorary professor of museum studies.\n\nRenowned for his pivotal role in advancing public archaeology and museum studies, Merriman has been a driving force in addressing vital issues such as cultural diversity, sustainability, and the evolving role of collections in the heritage sector.\n\nIn our interview, we delve into the insights from his latest work, 'Museums and the Climate Crisis,' a compelling read published by Routledge on December 22, 2023, that explores the critical intersection of museums and environmental stewardship.\n\nIn your book, you emphasize the unique position of museums in addressing global climate and ecological crises. Could you elaborate on how museums, with their long-term perspective and public trust, can effectively communicate and engage the public in climate action, particularly in ways that other institutions might not be able to?\n\nMuseums are amongst a small group of institutions mandated to take a long term view – backwards and forwards in history – beyond the short term cycles of politics and economics. Many have collections relating to the Earth’s previous five mass extinction events, and we are now in a new, human-made one, the Anthropocene. Because of this perspective, they have a duty to speak out about this existential crisis. Museums are also some of the most publicly trusted organisations, so they can use this to communicate and engage people in the crisis in ways that are meaningful to them.\n\nYour book includes international case studies and insights from various museum professionals. From these examples, what are some of the most innovative and practical strategies you've seen museums implement to reduce their carbon footprint and promote biodiversity? How can these strategies be adapted by museums of different sizes and resources?\n\nThe first thing to say is that any action is better than no action, so all museums should make a start, no matter how small it is. Summarising the examples in the book, I would suggest that museums first set out an overall long-term plan to decarbonise and increase biodiversity, and start doing one action at a time. My own organisation, the Horniman Museum and Gardens, is medium sized and we have set out a ‘road-map to net zero’, which shows all the things we will have to do by 2040.\n\nThe biggest tend to be replacing gas heating by renewable sources such as heat pumps and solar. Here, you have to be opportunistic and whenever there is a capital project you ensure that renewable energy is installed. In our gardens we crowd-funded the planting of a ‘microforest’ by a busy road adjacent to our site to absorb noise and pollution. It uses the Miyawaki method of planting small saplings closely together which grow swiftly, competing to reach the light, producing a dense thicket within a few years.\n\nWhilst some measures are simply those that need to be taken by any organisation, there are some that are specific to museums. In November 2023 the first UK Museum COP was held at Tate Modern in London where six working groups on issues such as collections management, managing heritage buildings, workforce needs and Scope 3 emissions presented their recommendations, which were voted on and agreed. Amongst these was a commitment to pursue ‘green first’ options in relation to loans, including using sea freight for international transport.\n\nThere are some good examples of innovation in relation to exhibitions. The Design Museum’s exhibition ‘The Waste Age’ was accompanied by a detailed analysis of its carbon footprint which showed, among other things, that 50% of emissions were caused by shipping one artwork from Ghana, and the largest single carbon footprint in the exhibition build comprised 4,800 steel screws which had an impact of around 7% of the total exhibition footprint.\n\nA significant challenge in climate communication is combating climate exhaustion and motivating people to take action. How do museums, through exhibitions and events, inspire visitors not just to understand the climate crisis but to actively participate in solutions? Could you share an example of a museum initiative that effectively turned visitors into environmental advocates?\n\nThere is good evidence that the so-called ‘deficit model’ of communication, which involves setting out the facts of how bad things are, doesn’t work, and in fact promotes climate anxiety and a feeling of powerlessness. Instead, a more productive approach is to harness the emotions alongside trusted information and expertise.\n\nArt galleries have been in the forefront of this approach to climate engagement, such as Tate’s showing of Olafur Eliasson’s melting glacier chunks called Ice Watch and his subsequent exhibition In Real Life.\n\nBut it’s not only artists and stories that engage the emotions: ‘scientific’ natural history museums also have staged dramatic interventions in their galleries to highlight vital issues. Curators at Bristol Museums shrouded 32 animals in their permanent display which were extinct or endangered in an intervention called ‘Extinction Voices’, and the Horniman Museum and Gardens removed some of the specimens in its aquarium, replacing them with plastic rubbish in a striking initiative entitled ‘Beat Plastic Pollution’.\n\nIn editing the book I have also been struck by the remarkable example of the National Network for Ocean and Climate Change Interpretation (NNOCCI) in the USA, which has grown into a Community of Practice of over 40,000 trainees and develops new techniques, applications and content. But probably the best and most comprehensive example is the Natural History Museum in London, which developed a new strategy a few years ago to focus on responding to the climate and biodiversity crisis. Using its huge collections, scientific expertise and large reach, it now aims to convert its visitors into ‘Advocates for the Planet’, who will try to live more sustainably and take wider actions to mitigate the crisis.\n\nMORE\n\nCase study ‘Working to make change in ‘Waste Age’’ by the Design Museum\n\nhttps://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/waste-age-what-can-design-do/working-to-make-change-in-waste-age\n\nAbout the Miyawaki Method and the planting of the ‘microforest’\n\nhttps://www.horniman.ac.uk/story/the-miyawaki-method-london-forest-road-border/\n\nArticle: ‘Natural History Museum declares ‘Planetary Emergency’ and reveals bold new Vision and Strategy to 2031 in response’\n\nhttps://www.nhm.ac.uk/press-office/press-releases/natural-history-museum-declares--planetary-emergency--and-reveal.html\n\nMuseums and the Climate Crisis on Amazon\n\nhttps://www.amazon.fr/Museums-Climate-Crisis-Nick-Merriman/dp/1032389419/\n\nNick Merriman on LinkedIn\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-merriman-6b807513/"
