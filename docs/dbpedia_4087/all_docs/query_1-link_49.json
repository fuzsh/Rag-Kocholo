        "text": "A medieval plaque discovered in a field in Oldham has been acquired by Manchester Museum, part of the University of Manchester.\n\nIt will be on public display when the museum reopens in February 2023.\n\nIt is the first Mosan plaque known to have been discovered in the northwest of England and the preservation of the object is described as ‚Äòremarkable‚Äô with most of its enamel intact.\n\nIt dates back to the 12th or early-13th century and shows the figure of St. Luke at a writing desk. He's shown wearing a robe, seated on the right-hand side facing towards the left, with his head surrounded by a yellow trim halo. Above the writing desk is the head of a bull, which is the patron animal of St. Luke.\n\nThe term ‚ÄòMosan‚Äô is used to describe sculpture, stained glass and metalwork produced in the valley of the River Meuse between Luxembourg and Belgium, Germany and France. Experts say the plaque is likely to have been used to decorate a religious object, such as a book or an altar.\n\nIt will be available to see in Manchester Museum‚Äôs new Belonging Gallery from February 2023. The Belonging Gallery will tell stories, both old and new, of how humans, animals, and plants have lived harmoniously with each other and in different landscapes. Religious objects help to explore identities of people and communities.\n\nThere is also the opportunity to see the plaque at Gallery Oldham from 9 September to 1 October 2022 as part of The Oldham Histories Festival.\n\nThe medieval plaque was discovered in a field in Oldham\n\nThe plaque has been purchased with support from the Arts Council England/V&A Purchase Grant Fund, Headley Museums Archaeological Acquisition Fund and The Aurelius Charitable Trust.\n\nCurator of Archaeology for Manchester Museum, Bryan Sitch, said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled to have this piece of local history within the museum‚Äôs collections and I‚Äôm sure it has quite a story to tell having travelled from mainland Europe to Oldham.\n\n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt currently know why, how, or when the plaque ended up in a field in Oldham. Mosan enamels are quite rare finds for England and to have one turn up in the northwest is very much welcomed.\n\n‚ÄúA huge thank you to our partners who have supported this acquisition and our investigations into the history of the object, including Arts Council England/V&A Purchase Grant Fund, Headley Museums Archaeological Acquisition Fund, The Aurelius Charitable Trust, Portable Antiquities Scheme, and Liverpool Museum.‚Äù\n\nManchester Museum is currently closed to the public while it undergoes a major transformation. As well as the Belonging Gallery, it will gain an impressive new Exhibition Hall, a Lee Kai Hung Chinese Culture Gallery, and a South Asia Gallery which is a partnership gallery with the British Museum.\n\nTo keep up to date with the museum‚Äôs transformation, visit mmfromhome.com/hellofuture\n\nüì∞ Sign up to our newsletter üì∞\n\nWant to get regular round-ups of news in your local area straight to your inbox?
