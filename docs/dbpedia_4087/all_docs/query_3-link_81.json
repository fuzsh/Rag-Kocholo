The awe and wonder of this artefact is a powerful tool to inspire your pupils, staff and local community.\n\nManchester Museum is pleased to invite the next phase of schools to take part in this very special programme for 2023-24.\n\n“A fantastic stimulus to hook the children”\n\n“It has been a fantastic opportunity for us [teachers] to develop our subject knowledge”\n\n“The kudos of actually housing a real artefact from a museum put a real positive focus on the school”\n\nThis project aims to:\n\nraise aspiration and build skills in history for pupils\n\nexpand subject knowledge and build skills for teachers\n\nprovide a focus for your community engagement\n\npromote cross-curricular collaboration between professionals, inside and outside of the school\n\nbuild social and cultural capital for your pupils\n\nWe will be offering:\n\nprofessional installation of a genuine museum artefact in your school between January and April 2024 (no additional insurance or security required)\n\na collaborative planning and CPD event in Autumn 2023, and a network of like-minded teachers\n\nresources, activity suggestions and case studies to inspire your planning\n\naccess to museum professional educators, conservators and curators including Egyptologist Dr Campbell Price\n\nWhat would you do with your shabti?\n\nSchools from the first three cohorts have:\n\nInvited families, communities and other schools to visit in-school museums, curated and guided by students themselves\n\nHosted both live and digital talks and debates with museum curators, for teachers, students and families\n\nUsed the shabti to develop teacher skills in teaching history using source material, and in coordinating whole-school projects\n\nHeld whole-school Shabti Days, which inspired artwork, food, games and more\n\nGet more ideas from the pilot schools case study and blog post!\n\nWho is eligible?\n\nWe are able to offer this opportunity to a limited number of state-funded schools inside the M60 motorway.\n\nWhat we will be looking for?\n\nThis is a creative, innovative programme where the more you put in the more you will get out. Our first three cohorts of schools have shown that the hook of the artefact is a fantastic way to bring staff, pupils and the community together around a real point of pride and inspiration.\n\nWe have a very limited number of spaces on the project and expect demand to be high. Therefore we will prioritise schools who can demonstrate in their application that:\n\ntheir teachers will benefit from the collaborative CPD and development opportunities\n\nthey will use their shabti creatively (e.g. across a broad curriculum, to teach history innovatively, or for parental engagement in learning)\n\nthe shabti would have a wide impact in their school community and build cultural capital (e.g. a high number of individuals will be in contact with it and/or plans will allow for deep and rich engagement.\n\nNew Session Alert: Curious Classification\n\nAs part of our work with Indigenising Manchester Museum, our brand new workshop Curious Classification is ready to be rolled out to your school. Using our taxidermy handling collection in the Inflatable Museum, this workshop explores different ways of approaching, classifying, and grouping animals from around the world. We can’t wait to guide your students through classification and build their confidence in considering how others approach classification and presenting the museum display they’ll create.\n\nEmbroidering The Museum: Free CPD Craft, Science and Wellbeing Workshops for Primary Teachers and TAs\n\nPrimary Teachers and Teaching Assistants are invited to join Manchester Museum’s artist in residence, Lucy Burscough, for an inspiring cross-curricular workshop, ‘Dab Hands: Embroidering the Museum’, designed especially to expand your creative skill set and explore the wonderful things that can happen when arts and crafts meet science.\n\nYou will receive a free, beautifully designed embroidery kit themed on objects from the museum’s collection. In a choice of live or digital workshops, Lucy will lead you through learning the basics of embroidery, leaving you with the skills and knowledge that you need to complete your kit and develop your own embroidery lessons.\n\nParticipants will enjoy the wellbeing benefits of learning embroidery skills in a supportive environment, alongside taking away new perspectives on how this craft can help pupils to look closely at and record scientific specimens such as plants and insects.\n\nDigital sessions using the embroidery kits will take place on Wednesday 15 June (7-8.30pm) and Thursday 23 June (6-7.30pm). Lucy may be able to attend your school in person to work live with you and your colleagues.\n\nTo book as an individual online participant, please email your name, school, and choice of date to school.bookings@manchester.ac.uk. These are free of charge but places are limited.\n\nTo discuss an in-school activity for teachers and TAs, please email amy.mcdowall@manchester.ac.uk with your school name, location, and your proposed numbers and date/s.\n\nTo find out more about Dab Hands and Lucy’s work at the museum please visit www.lucysart.co.uk/stitches.\n\nHelp us shape the future of learning\n\nhello future\n\nManchester Museum has an exciting career opportunity and invites applications for the post of Learning Programme Assistant – Outreach and Museum, providing full time employment for the next two years, throughout the final year of our hello future redevelopment and into the first year of reopening.\n\nThe Learning Programme Assistant will play a key role in keeping Manchester Museum’s incredible collection alive during our closure period, ensuring – through your amazing engagement skills – that we continue to inspire young people across the region throughout this time.\n\nYou will also provide creative ideas and support testing of brand new programmes ready for our reopening late in 2022, in line with our values and mission and in collaboration with the Primary Learning Coordinator and other team members. If this sounds like…\n\nView original post 321 more words\n\nWorking Scientifically at the Museum\n\nYou might have seen our post in May about ‘Inside Out’ – a project with primary schools last year that had children discovering for themselves how the real-life setting of the museum works in a scientific way. They checked pest traps, created an ethical experiment with tadpoles, curated some ancient Chinese objects….and much more!\n\nThe children worked really hard to develop their findings into five fantastic films that were premiered at the Great Science Share flagship event in June, as well as events in schools to share with family and friends. We’re delighted to say that these videos are now live and ready for children all over the world to learn from.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe videos could be used as an introduction to a science-focused visit to the museum, as part of a discussion about scientific careers, or as an introduction to real-life working scientifically.\n\nThey touch on collections care, entomology (bugs!), herpetology (amphibians and reptiles), Egyptology, archaeology, palaeontology, and more. All five areas of working scientifically are featured: Identifying, classifying and grouping; observing over time; research using secondary sources; comparative and fair testing; and pattern-seeking.\n\nWe absolutely loved working with the 5 schools, 10 teachers and 150 children who took part in this project, and we hope they had fun too!\n\n“[The project] has been massive for boosting my pupil’s confidence in science.” (project teacher)\n\n“Nearly every child said their highlight for the year was visiting Manchester Museum.” (project teacher)\n\nFor future opportunities like this for your pupils, please sign up to the Primary & Early Years E-newsletter. With many thanks to the University of Manchester’s Faculty of Science and Engineering for the Widening Participation funding that made this project possible, and our fantastic partners in SEERIH. We hope you enjoy the films!\n\nAncient Egypt at Central Library\n\nManchester Museum’s latest installation at Manchester’s Central Library – Young, Rich & Famous – challenges us to think of how we will be remembered after death and what we will leave behind.\n\nIf you’re missing our Ancient Worlds galleries, but you’re taking a class into central Manchester this school year, this could be a great way to enrich your history topic in 2020 – with zero entry fee.\n\nWhat might my class do there?\n\nWe’ve put together notes, activity sheets and resources for key stages 2 and 3 to help you get the most out of your class’s visit. Your pupils might:\n\nHelp Princess Isis to entertain the gods\n\nSketch and annotate an artefact like an archaeologist\n\nCompare ancient Egyptian tombs to modern social media\n\nDebate whether these artefacts should be in Manchester\n\nand more!\n\nThe display can comfortably fit around 15 children at once. Later in 2020, we expect to offer a combined visit to Central Library using our amazing Inflatable Museum at a discounted rate. Contact Jenny to express your interest.\n\nHow do I book?\n\nTo book your visit to Central Library, please contact Angela Rawcliffe.\n\nCan I make a day of it?\n\nIn the same building, why not ask Central Library if they can provide a workshop on books about ancient Egypt, or visit Archives Plus to get stuck into some local history?\n\nYou might also combine your library visit with a trip to the nearby historic John Rylands Library on Deansgate (perhaps for their popular Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs workshop), or to Manchester Art Gallery, just across the road.\n\nCentral Library is right next to the Metrolink St Peter’s Square stop.\n\nLet us know how you get on!\n\nDownload: Activity sheets and teacher notes\n\nFestive Ancient Egypt!\n\nWe know it can be tricky to fit in school trips and even visitors to school during December. The hall is taken up with panto rehearsals and staff are rushed off their feet.\n\nSo let us take the hassle out of your December with our Pop-up Festive Ancient Egypt offer!\n\nWe’ll bring to you a miniature version of our Inflatable Museum (gazebo-style!) that can fit into your classroom – bringing the style and excitement of the Inflatable without the need for your school hall.\n\nWe’ll run a version of our Archive Explorer: Ancient Egypt workshop – complete with real ancient artefacts and mummification challenge – but with a festive twist.\n\nAnd in the spirit of seasonal goodwill, we’re offering this at specially discounted rates:\n\n– For 1 class in a day: £250 £180\n\n– For 2 classes in a day: £380 total £250 total\n\n– For 3 classes in a day: £500 total £300 total\n\nPlaces are limited and first-come, first served within a 30 minute drive time of M13 9PL on Wednesdays and Thursdays in December.

There’s all this discovery that children can have and I think that’s a really exciting thing”\n\n“I think it has engaged all our pupils and it has created learning opportunities to develop those key skills, research, that analysis, that evaluation, which are skills they need in all subjects …This experience with the shabti is something these children will tell their grandchildren.”\n\nApply now\n\nEarly Years update\n\nWe are particularly pleased to be welcoming more nursery and reception groups visiting the museum for self led visits this term.
