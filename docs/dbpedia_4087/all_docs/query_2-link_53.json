        "text": "Detail\n\nThis notice cancels and replaces Notice 998 (November 2017). Details of any changes to the previous version can be found in paragraph 1.2.\n\nThis notice explains the VAT rules that apply to those museums and galleries that are eligible for refunds of VAT under section 33A of the VAT Act 1994 and which are listed in the ‘VAT (Refund of Tax to Museums and Galleries) Order’ (as amended).\n\n1. Overview\n\n1.1 Information in this notice\n\nThis notice applies to those museums or galleries that offer free admission to the public and which are eligible for refunds of VAT under the museums and galleries VAT Refund Scheme. Eligible bodies are listed in the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax to Museums and Galleries) Order 2001 (as amended). This is reproduced in the annex to this notice.\n\n1.2 What’s changed\n\nThe list of qualifying museums and galleries has been updated in line with the changes made in The Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax to Museums and Galleries) (Amendment) Order 2024 which took effect on 8 July 2024.\n\n1.3 Who should read this notice\n\nMuseums and galleries eligible for the museums and galleries VAT Refund Scheme.\n\n1.4 The law this notice relates to\n\nThe legal provisions concerning this scheme can be found at:\n\nVAT Act 1994, section 33A, which details the workings of the scheme\n\nVAT (Refund of Tax to Museums and Galleries) Order 2001 (SI 2001/2879) which lists those museums and galleries eligible for the scheme, and the date from which they became so eligible — see paragraph 1.5\n\n1.5 What the position is for museums or galleries that offer free admission to the public\n\nMuseums and galleries offering free access are not regarded as being engaged in any business in relation to this activity. They may, of course, have other activities that in their own right are business activities, for example, catering, sales of books and gifts and exhibitions for which there is a charge.\n\nOrdinarily, it is not possible to recover the VAT incurred on goods and services purchased to support non-business activities. Thus, VAT incurred in connection with the free admission of the public is not normally recoverable.\n\nIn certain circumstances, however, the government will reimburse this otherwise irrecoverable VAT. For this to be the case, the provisions of section 33A of the VAT Act 1994 (enacted on 1 April 2001) must apply, and the museum or gallery must be named in an Order made by HM Treasury.\n\n1.6 What bodies are in section 33A and from when\n\nBodies eligible to claim refunds of VAT under Section 33A are listed in column 1 of the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax to Museums and Galleries) Order 2001.\n\nDetails of the specific museums and galleries to which such claims relate are set out in column 2 of the Order.\n\nMuseums and galleries are eligible for a refund on or after 1 April 2001 unless column 3 of the Order specifies a later date from which a claim can be made.\n\nAs an example:\n\nColumn 1: body Column 2: relevant museums and galleries Column 3: effective date if after 1 April 2001 A museum New building 1 August 2014 — A museum — — Address — — Town — — County and postcode —\n\n1.7 Who can be added to section 33A\n\nSection 33A of the VAT Act 1994 is a VAT Refund Scheme aimed at supporting the provision of free access to museums and galleries. Introduced in 2001, the scheme allows eligible museums and galleries to claim back VAT incurred on most goods and services purchased in order to grant free rights of admission to their collections.\n\nFrom 16 March 2016 the eligibility criteria for the scheme have been broadened. Applications are no longer restricted to national and university museums and galleries only.\n\nThere are strict conditions for inclusion in the section 33A scheme and it is not sufficient that a museum or gallery admits the public free of charge.\n\nRequests to include new bodies in the scheme, or to add a new museum or gallery operated by a body already in the scheme, will be considered. Requests must be fully supported by one of the appropriate following administrations or departments.\n\nThese are:\n\nDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport\n\nWelsh Government\n\nNorthern Ireland Assembly\n\nScottish Government\n\nMinistry of Defence\n\nNominations should be sent in the first instance to the relevant department or administration listed.\n\nThe completion of an application does not guarantee admission to the scheme, and the decision on whether to include a museum or gallery in the scheme is ultimately made by ministers.\n\nTo be eligible to apply for admission to the scheme museums or galleries must:\n\nbe open to the general public for at least 30 hours per week, without exception\n\noffer free entry, without prior appointment\n\nhold collections in a purpose-built building\n\ndisplay details of free entry and opening hours on the museum website\n\nNewly eligible museums will also be required to complete a strategic business case as part of the application process, including:\n\nproof of Arts Council England Accredited status (or equivalent)\n\npast and, or projected visitor figures\n\ninformation on existing and planned education programmes and community engagement work\n\nUpon admission to the scheme museums will be required to provide:\n\nevidence confirming an obligation to providing or continuing to provide free entry\n\nvisitor figures on a bi-annual basis\n\n1.8 How section 33A applies to a library\n\nSection 33A does not extend to libraries. However, the Treasury has extended the scheme to cover permanent collections in the British Library, the National Library of Scotland and the National Library of Wales. This is because these qualify as museum collections. Section 33A does not refund, for example, VAT incurred in relation to the reading rooms. This VAT is subject to the normal rules explained in VAT guide (VAT Notice 700).\n\n1.9 VAT groups and section 33A bodies\n\nSection 33A bodies can form a VAT group if they meet the requirements for VAT group treatment as set out in VAT Notice 700/2: group and divisional registration. HMRC will grant such requests only if it’s satisfied that you’re not seeking the arrangement for tax avoidance purposes.\n\n1.10 Change in circumstances\n\nThe Treasury Order contains your name and the names and addresses of your museums or galleries that are covered by the refund scheme. Advise your sponsor department (paragraph 1.7) if any of those details change, or if you revert to charging for public admission. They in turn will contact HMRC.\n\n2. Definition of ‘free admission’\n\n2.1 What this section is about\n\nThis section explains what VAT you can reclaim under the scheme. From the date specified in the Treasury Order, you will be entitled to recover the VAT you incur in relation to ‘free rights of admission’ which would otherwise be non-recoverable.\n\n2.2 Free admission\n\nAdmission is free where the public is able to enter a museum or gallery (without pre-booking), view the collections on display and use freely available facilities for no charge. This includes, for example, access to common areas and facilities such as play areas for children, lectures and instructional classes provided for no charge.\n\n2.3 What VAT can be reclaimed under section 33A\n\nYou can reclaim VAT incurred on most goods and services you purchase in order to grant ‘free rights of admission’ to your principal collections. This extends to VAT incurred on:\n\nthe supply to you of goods or services\n\ngoods you have imported into the UK\n\ngoods you acquire in Northern Ireland from the EU\n\n2.4 The supply of goods and services\n\nWhether or not you’re registered for VAT, you can get refunds on goods and services you use or intend to use for free admissions only if you:\n\nplace the order\n\nreceive the supply\n\nreceive a tax invoice addressed to you\n\npay from your own funds (including funds awarded to you, for example, lottery funds)\n\n2.5 Time limits for claiming VAT\n\nYou must make your claim within 4 years of the due date of your VAT Return for the prescribed accounting period in which the VAT became chargeable — but commencing only from the date specified in the Treasury Order naming you.\n\nColumn 1: body Column 2: relevant museums and galleries Column 3: effective date if after 1 April 2001 A museum New building 1 August 2014 — A museum — — Address — — Town — — County and postcode —\n\nIf ‘New building’ incurs VAT on goods or services that is attributable to the provision of free rights of admission (see paragraph 2.6), and this VAT is incurred on or after 1 August 2014, the museum has a period of 4 years forward from that date to make a claim for this VAT.\n\n2.6 What we mean by VAT incurred in relation to ‘free rights of admission’\n\nWhere you admit the public free of charge to view the principal collections in your museum or gallery, you will be able to reclaim the VAT you have incurred on the:\n\nitems and collections on display (provided they have borne VAT)\n\ngoods and services necessary for their upkeep\n\nupkeep of the part of the building (including common areas) in which they’re housed\n\nprovision of free information in relation to the items or collections on display, including advertising and other promotional material\n\n2.7 Specific examples\n\nMore specifically, this might include the VAT you incur in relation to:\n\nbuying, acquiring or importing the items and collections to which the public has free access\n\nstoring, cleaning and restoring them\n\nrepairing and maintaining that part of the museum or gallery where they’re housed, including cleaning that area and making it secure\n\nbuilding a new wing to house them\n\nproviding ‘virtual’ access to, and information about them, including virtual museum tours via your free website (provided this is not a business activity)\n\nproviding free lectures\n\nadvertising and promoting them by any other means, including the internet\n\nIt also includes those areas, such as office space, that are not themselves open to the public but which are used for administration purposes in connection with free admissions.\n\n2.8 How section 33A applies if you charge the public to see specific items or exhibitions\n\nProvided the public has free access to the principal collections on display, it does not matter that you occasionally charge people to see special exhibitions and so on. However, your claim under section 33A is restricted to VAT incurred in relation to ‘free rights of admission’ as explained in paragraphs 2.2 to 2.6. VAT incurred in relation to the special exhibition the public pays to see is subject to the normal rules of input tax deduction, see VAT guide (VAT Notice 700).\n\n2.9 When VAT cannot be claimed under section 33A\n\nThe provisions in section 33A cannot be used to reclaim any VAT you incur in relation to:\n\nany non-business activities other than providing free admission to the public (see paragraph 2.2) — for example, you cannot recover under this provision any VAT incurred in relation to grant funded research\n\nany business activities, such as shops, catering outlets, commercial sponsorship (including commercially sponsored websites), or educational courses that you provide for consideration\n\nAdditionally, section 33A does not permit you to recover any VAT:\n\nthat cannot be recovered under the normal VAT rules — see VAT guide (VAT Notice 700)\n\nincurred in another country - in certain circumstances you can reclaim this VAT from the authorities in the country where you incurred the VAT – see Claim back VAT incurred in the UK if you’re established elsewhere (VAT Notice 723A)\n\n2.10 The VAT you’re entitled to recover\n\nThe provisions in section 33A cannot be used to recover VAT incurred in any circumstance other than those outlined in paragraphs 2.2 to 2.8.\n\nBut, if you’re registered for VAT you can recover the VAT incurred on the supply to you of most goods and services, and the importation or acquisition by you of most goods, that relate to your taxable business activities. See VAT guide (VAT Notice 700).\n\nYou cannot generally recover VAT incurred in relation to supplies you make that are exempt from VAT, and you’ll need to operate a partial exemption method to determine whether, and how much, input tax will be restricted. The VAT guide and Partial exemption (VAT Notice 706) give further details.\n\nIf you are not registered for VAT, you cannot reclaim any VAT other than to the extent that this is permitted under section 33A.\n\n2.11 Effect on input tax you’ve recovered from charging when you no longer charge the public for admission to museums or galleries\n\nMuseums and galleries listed in the Order are not required to account for VAT on goods and services on which they properly recovered input tax and subsequently used to offer free rights of admission. This makes sure that input tax properly recovered at the time on a capital item, as defined in the Capital Goods Scheme, is not made subject to adjustments under that scheme solely on account of the move to free admission. Further information can be found in Extra Statutory Concession (ESC) 3.34 in VAT Notice 48: extra statutory concessions.\n\n2.12 The effect of the VAT on the stock and capital assets on hand when your registration for VAT is cancelled\n\nThere are certain circumstances when you will have to account for tax on your business assets on hand at deregistration. These are explained in VAT Notice 700/11: cancelling your registration. However, any assets that you use solely for the purpose of admitting the public free of charge to your principal collections are no longer the assets of a business, and you do not have to account for tax on these assets at the point of deregistration.\n\n3. Recovering the VAT you’ve incurred on the free right of admission\n\n3.1 What this section is about\n\nThis section explains how you can recover the VAT you’ve incurred in providing free admission under section 33A of the VAT Act 1994.\n\n3.2 How VAT refunds are claimed after you’ve registered for VAT\n\nYou should claim your refund in box 4 of the VAT Return. In that box you should include not only the value of the input tax you incurred in making your taxable business supplies, but also the amount of VAT you’re reclaiming under section 33A on those goods and services you have bought for right of free admission. Be sure to include the net value of your claim in box 7.\n\n3.3 How VAT refunds are claimed if you are not registered for VAT\n\nIf you are not registered for VAT and you do not need to register, you should read section 4. You will still be able to claim a refund of the VAT you have incurred on the goods and services you have bought for your free admission activities.\n\n3.4 How to make a claim\n\nYou must:\n\nmake the claim in writing\n\nstate the amount you are claiming\n\nstate the periods covered\n\nexplain the basis of your calculation\n\nhold evidence to support your claim\n\n4. Museums and galleries not registered for VAT\n\n4.1 What this section is about\n\nIf you’re a museum or gallery in section 33A of the VAT Act 1994 and you are not registered for VAT, this section will help you make sure your claims for VAT refunds are valid. It also explains how to make them.\n\n4.2 If you’re in section 33 but not registered, the goods and services you can recover VAT on\n\nStep Action 1. Read section 2 of this notice to find out the main principles 2. Read section 3 to see whether you can meet the various requirements set out there 3. Reclaim the VAT you have incurred only when you can attribute it to your free rights of admission 4. Remember that, because you are not registered, you may neither:\n\n• charge VAT on your taxable business activities\n\n• recover the VAT relating to them\n\n4.3 How to claim a VAT refund\n\nStep Action 1. Apply in writing 2. Make sure that your claim relates to a period of at least one calendar month — or at least 12 months if it’s for less than £100 3. Make sure the period you choose ends on the last day of a calendar month 4. Make sure you make your claim within 3 years after the end of the month in which you received the supply, acquisition or importation. For example, you receive goods in July 2010, so you must submit your claim by 31 July 2014 5. Keep invoices and other records to support your claims for 6 years, unless your local VAT Business Advice Centre agrees in writing to a shorter period 6. If you obtain refunds by Bacs (Bankers Automated Clearing Service), inform us of any changes to the details of your bank account\n\n4.4 Submitting an application for a refund\n\nYou need simply make a declaration along the following lines:\n\nI am claiming a refund of £X for the period…… to…… to cover VAT charged on goods and services bought for (name of body) the provision of free admission to the public.\n\nSigned.\n\nFor (name of body).\n\nAddress.\n\nContact name.\n\nContact telephone number.\n\nYou should keep evidence to support the basis of your claim.\n\n4.5 Where to send your claim\n\nSend your claim to:\n\n4.6 What we’ll do when we receive your claim\n\nOnce we receive your claim we will:\n\n(a) make your refund by Bacs or payable order\n\n(b) give you a unique number to quote on all claims — but this does not mean that we have registered you for VAT\n\nAnnex to Notice 998\n\nMuseums and galleries eligible for refunds of VAT under section 33A of the VAT Act 1994 and which are listed in the ‘VAT (Refund of Tax to Museums and Galleries) Order’\n\nBodies that are eligible to claim refunds of VAT under Section 33A are listed in column 1. Column 2 specifies the museums and galleries to which such claims relate. Museums and galleries are eligible for a refund on or after 1 April 2001 unless column 3 specifies a later date from which a claim can be made.\n\nBody Relevant museums and galleries Effective date if
