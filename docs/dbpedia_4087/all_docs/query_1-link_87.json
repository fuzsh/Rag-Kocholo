        "text": "The Egyptological museum search is a PHP tool aimed to facilitate locating the descriptions and images of ancient Egyptian objects in online catalogues of major museums. Online catalogues (ranging from selections of highlights to complete digital inventories) are now offered by almost all major museums holding ancient Egyptian items and have become indispensable in research work. Yet the variety of web interfaces and of search rules may overstrain any person performing many searches in different online catalogues.\n\nEgyptological museum search was made to provide a single search point for finding objects by their inventory numbers in major collections of Egyptian antiquities that have online catalogues. It tries to convert user input into search queries recognised by museums’ websites. (Thus on museum websites, stela Geneva D 50 should be searched as “D 0050,” statue Vienna ÄS 5046 as “AE_INV_5046,” and coffin Turin Suppl. 5217 as “S. 05217.” Egyptological museum search aims to allow searching for inventory numbers in the form, in which they are cited in scholarly literature.) The following online catalogues are supported:\n\nShort nameFull nameFree license AberdeenUniversity Museums, The University of Aberdeen— Allard PiersonAllard Pierson Museum, Amsterdam— AshmoleanAshmolean Museum, Oxfordfree for non-commercial educational purposes BerkeleyPhoebe A.

CC 0 and CC BY allow using images in printed publications and on websites.\n\nSearch forwarding is not yet supported for Global Egyptian Museum and Bible and Orient Museum, Fribourg.\n\nMore information on Egyptian collections can be found online on Trismegistos, Artefacts of Excavation, and Desheret.org.\n\nThe tool can be used in two ways. First, one may use the online search interface. One may select the museum, enter the searched inventory number in the box, and press “Search.” Then the browser is redirected either to the object desription in the online museum catalogue or to a search results page on the museum website. Second, one may send HTTP GET queries to the Egyptological museum search in order to connect it to a one’s own online or offline application by creating query URLs of the following form:\n\nhttp://static.egyptology.ru/varia/mus.php?museum=(Museum)&no=(Inventory number)\n\nIn order to provide compatibility with other databases, which may use different designations of the museums, Egyptological museum search supports a number of aliases. Examples of query URLs:\n\nhttp://static.egyptology.ru/varia/mus.php?museum=Leyden&no=D 127\n\nhttp://static.egyptology.ru/varia/mus.php?museum=New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art&no=56.136\n\nhttp://static.egyptology.ru/varia/mus.php?museum=Turin&no=Cat. 1374\n\nIn case you wish to adapt Egyptological museum search for the needs of a different discipline, you may make use of its source code published on Github."
