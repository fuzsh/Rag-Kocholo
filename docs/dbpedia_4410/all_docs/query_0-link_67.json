        "text": "#1 - Michael Angelis (, Narrator (voice UK))\n\nâ€‹From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Michael Angelis (18 January 1952 - 30 May 2020) was an English actor and voice actor. Michael Angelis was one of the stars of the famous 1982 BBC drama serial Boys from the Black Stuff and another Alan Bleasedale drama G.B.H. (TV series). He also starred in comedies such as Luv and The Liver Birds, in which he appeared between series 5 and 9. He appeared as a villain in the revived television series Auf Wiedersehen Pet, alongside former fellow Black Stuff star Alan Igbon. Angelis is perhaps best known for narrating the British Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends series, which he has done since 1991, when he took over from Ringo Starr. Angelis was originally intended to provide some of the voices in the film adaptation of the series, Thomas and the Magic Railroad, but he was dropped from the project when US test audiences thought he made the characters he originally voiced, James and Percy, sound too old. In 2007, he was reported to have stepped down from his role, with Pierce Brosnan taking over the role. However, Brosnan's narration was only heard in one feature special The Great Discovery, and Angelis has continued to provide the narration ever since. Angelis also narrated John Peel's autobiography, Margrave of the Marshes, on BBC Radio 4 in 2005. In 2006 he starred in the movie Fated, set in his home town of Liverpool, as well as in episodes of Midsomer Murders and The Bill in 2007. Angelis was married to the Coronation Street actress Helen Worth; however the two divorced in 2001 when Angelis admitted having an affair with model Jennifer Khalastchi Description above from the Wikipedia article Michael Angelis, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\n\nMichael Angelis plays as , Narrator (voice UK) in Thomas The Tank Engine & Friends.\n\nMichael Angelis is the top #1 member of the cast and appears in 350 episodes.\n\n#2 - Ringo Starr (Narrator (voice))\n\nRichard Starkey, MBE (born 7 July 1940), better known by his stage name Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer-songwriter, and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for The Beatles. When the band formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool band, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. He became The Beatles' drummer in August 1962, taking the place of Pete Best. In addition to his contribution as drummer, Starr featured as lead vocals on a number of successful Beatles songs (in particular, \"With a Little Help from My Friends\", \"Yellow Submarine\", and The Beatles version of \"Act Naturally\"), as co-writer with the song \"What Goes On\" and primary writer with \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\". As drummer for The Beatles, Starr was musically creative, and his contribution to the band's music has received high praise from notable drummers in more recent times. Starr described himself as \"your basic offbeat drummer with funny fills\", technically limited by being a left-handed person playing a right-handed kit. Drummer Steve Smith said that Starr's popularity \"brought forth a new paradigm\" where \"we started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect\" and that Starr \"composed unique, stylistic drum parts for The Beatles songs\". In 2011, Starr was picked as the fifth-best drummer of all-time by Rolling Stone readers, behind drummers such as John Bonham, Keith Moon and Neil Peart. Starr is the most documented and critically acclaimed actor-Beatle, playing a central role in several Beatles films, and appearing in numerous other movies, both during and after his career with The Beatles. After The Beatles' break-up in 1970, Starr achieved solo musical success with several singles and albums, and recorded with each of his fellow ex-Beatles as they too developed their post-Beatle musical careers. He has also been featured in a number of TV documentaries, hosted TV shows, and narrated the first two series of the children's television series Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends. He currently tours with the All-Starr Band.\n\nRingo Starr plays as Narrator (voice) in Thomas The Tank Engine & Friends.\n\nRingo Starr is the top #2 member of the cast and appears in 52 episodes."
