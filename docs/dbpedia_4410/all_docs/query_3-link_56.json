        "text": "Variety Awards Circuit section is the home for all awards news and related content throughout the year, featuring the following: the official predictions for the upcoming Oscars, Emmys, Grammys and Tony Awards ceremonies, curated by Variety senior awards editor Clayton Davis. The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\nVisit the prediction pages for the respective ceremonies via the links below:\n\nOSCARS | EMMYS | GRAMMYS | TONYS\n\n2025 Oscars Predictions:\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nWeekly Commentary (Updated Aug. 22, 2024): Originality often plays a significant role in this category, which frequently aligns with the best picture race.\n\nSean Baker could finally receive recognition with his dark comedy “Anora.” At the same time, the prestige of the World War II epic “Blitz” and the musical “Emilia Pérez” are likely to be at the forefront of voters’ minds.\n\nThe “x factor” in this race is Jason Reitman’s “Saturday Night,” a film that delves into the first episode of the long-running NBC sketch show “Saturday Night Live” with an impressive acting ensemble. Reitman hasn’t been nominated since his work on “Juno” (in directing) and “Up in the Air” (double nominated for adapted screenplay and directing). Could this be the year he makes his return to the awards circuit?\n\nMore to come.\n\nRead: All Primetime Emmy predictions in every category on Variety’s Awards Circuit.\n\nThe 97th Oscars will be held on Sunday, March 2. The full rankings are below. All movie listings, titles, distributors, and credited producers are not final and are subject to change.\n\n** denotes the film is not yet dated or can open in 2025."
