        "text": "Martin T. Sherman (born 28 November, 1966) is an American actor, voice actor, voice director, writer and director who provided voices for the US dub of Thomas & Friends from 2009-2015.\n\nHe started acting around the age of 9 at a local Jewish community centre in Florida. He also provides voices for several video games. Two of his better known roles are Pac-Man in the video game Pac-Man World 3 and Ryan from DreamWeb.\n\nVoices\n\nUS\n\nThomas (2009 - 2015)\n\nHenry (declined)\n\nPercy (2009 - 2015)\n\nDiesel (2013 - 2015)\n\nThe Bird Watcher (Henry's Good Deeds)\n\nSome Children (Time for a Story, Pop Goes Thomas and Toby and Bash)\n\nSome Sodor United Soccer Players (Pingy Pongy Pick Up)\n\nThe Tree Specialist (Day of the Diesels only)\n\nSongs\n\nSeries 18\n\nI Do Like to be Beside the Seaside (performed)\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nIt's Great to be an Engine (performed)\n\nSurprises (performed)\n\nSounds (performed)\n\nSir Topham Hatt (performed)\n\nReally Useful Engine (performed)\n\nLet's Have a Race (performed)\n\nThomas' Anthem (performed)\n\nDeparture from the Series\n\nIn 2014, it was announced that Sherman would leave his roles on Thomas & Friends due to contractual disagreements with the production team. He announced his departure via The SiF Blog in July. In the post, he claimed to be feeling exploited and complained about the low wage the series was paying him. He also apologised to any fans who might be affected by his departure.\n\nLater that month, in an interview with The Guardian, he stated that HiT Entertainment contacted his agent and had threatened to take legal action against Sherman, if the blog post was not removed. Sherman said he felt bullied and silenced and was reportedly seeking legal advice regarding the blogpost. The blog post was later removed. In the same Guardian interview, HiT Entertainment refused to comment on the contracts it has with its talent and wished Martin Sherman the best in his future professional endeavours.[1]\n\nAfter his Departure\n\nJoseph May took over the US voice of Thomas starting with The Adventure Begins, Christopher Ragland took over the US voice of Percy in Sodor's Legend of the Lost Treasure and Kerry Shale began voicing Diesel in the US as well as continuing to voice him in the UK dub starting with the nineteenth series.\n\nDuring an interview in December 2020, he apologised again to the fans for putting them in the middle of the situation, along with apologising to David Menkin for asking him to not accept the offer to voice Thomas, in order to show support towards Sherman. However, Sherman stated he regretted this decision and thought that Menkin would have done very well with voicing Thomas.[2]\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nGreen Street Hooligans (2005)\n\nSpirit of the Forest (2008)\n\nThomas & Friends: Hero of the Rails (2009)\n\nLeap Year (2010)\n\nThomas & Friends: Misty Island Rescue (2010)\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger (2011)\n\nThomas & Friends: Day of the Diesels (2011)\n\nThomas & Friends: Blue Mountain Mystery (2012)\n\nThomas & Friends: King of the Railway (2013)\n\nBurton and Taylor (2013)\n\nThomas & Friends: Tale of the Brave (2014)\n\nTelevision\n\nAdventures on Orsum Island (2008)\n\nThomas & Friends (2009-2015)\n\nDoctor Who (2015)\n\nGames\n\nDreamWeb\n\nSimon the Sorcerer II: The Lion, the Wizard, and the Wardrobe\n\nConflict: Desert Storm II - Back to Baghdad\n\nDriv3r\n\nSecond Sight\n\nPac-Man World 3\n\nTimesplitters: Future Perfect\n\nJuiced\n\nSniper Elite\n\nKameo: Elements of Power\n\nPerfect Dark Zero\n\nThe Witcher\n\nHaze\n\nSo Blonde\n\nCrysis Warhead\n\nIL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey\n\nDriver: San Francisco\n\nDeponia\n\nXenoblade Chronicles 3\n\nTrivia\n\nIn an interview with Sodor Island Fansite, he explained that he played Thomas based of himself at age fifteen and he played Percy as the little brother he never had.[3]\n\nIn the same interview with Sodor Island Fansite, he said he had auditioned for the US voice of Henry, However, he was declined in favour of Kerry Shale.[3]\n\nSherman was also a performer in the 2011 North American tour of the live show Thomas Saves the Day, playing the role of Stephen Hatt.\n\nIn a 2020 interview, when he was asked about the criticism of the series for its writing during the thirteenth to sixteenth series from longtime fans (especially criticism directed toward former head writer, Sharon Miller), Sherman responded saying;\n\n“ I think you need to understand that writing for a show like Thomas with long standing adult fans and children coming in is very difficult. There is the constant push to change, to keep up with the times and to remain the same. Sharon did her best to walk that razor’s edge. But, personally, I avoid reading comments because I don’t want to be thinking about that when I am trying to work. I rely on people directing me like Ian, Sharon and Greg to synthesize the fan’s feedback into the show.\"[2] ”\n\nSherman's favourite Thomas & Friends project was Day of the Diesels. He said in the 2020 interview that it gave him the chance to explore some complicated emotions between Thomas and Percy.[2]\n\nIn the same interview from 2020, he stated after one year in doing the show, he pitched the concept of Thomas globetrotting. Although HiT Entertainment turned down the idea at the time, it would form the basis for Big World! Big Adventures! under Mattel four years after Sherman's departure.[2]\n\nSherman worked as a voice actor on David Mitton's unfinished \"Adventures on Orsum Island\" series.\n\nThe Strasburg Railroad still used Sherman's voice samples for their Thomas rides, even after his departure, until the CGI era was supplanted by All Engines Go.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences"
