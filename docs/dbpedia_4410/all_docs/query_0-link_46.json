Tom McGrath and Mireille Soria moved me deeply with their highly personal talks about the influence their families have had on their work. Peter Sohn and Doug Chiang wowed us with their dazzling creativity while at the same time speaking eloquently about their experiences growing up in immigrant families in the U.S. And I have a special place in my heart for the extraordinary hour I spent at VIEW Conference 2022, when Rob Minkoff, director of the original The Lion King, took to the stage with his ukulele and treated us all to a never-seen-before musical journey through his experience making one of the best-loved animated features of all time. If I’m allowed a shameless plug, you can enjoy that session and more through our extensive online archive of recordings – just visit the VIEW Conference website.”\n\nLooking ahead to this October’s program highlights, Gutierrez remarks, “There simply isn’t enough time to list them all! Suffice it to say, VIEW Conference 2024 promises a unique lineup of award-winning creatives discussing their latest projects alongside top-level Silicon Valley innovators. Live on stage, we’ll have the directors of this year’s big animated features – Inside Out 2, Ultraman: Rising and The Wild Robot, to name but three – but as always, we go deeper. For example, in addition to speaking about his movie, Josh Cooley, director of Transformers One, will also be teaching a special masterclass on the story, designed to enlighten and inspire professionals and students alike while passing on a wealth of practical advice and insight. We dive deep with VFX, too. Our exploration of Dune: Part Two boasts no less than five presenters, including triple-Oscar-winning Production VFX Supervisor Paul Lambert. We’re also proud to welcome the VFX supervisors of big movies like Twisters and Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire and hit streaming series like Fallout and 3 Body Problem.”\n\nIt was a pleasant surprise when the Spanish-French co-production Robot Dreams, which deals with themes of loneliness, companionship and people growing apart – without a word of dialogue – was nominated for Best Animated Feature at this year’s Academy Awards. Masterminding the adaptation of the graphic novel by Sara Varon was live-action filmmaker Pablo Berger (Blancanieves), who decided to try the world of animation, and in the process of doing so came up with some imaginative dream transitions. One transition in particular occurs when the Coney Island-stranded Robot is covered by snow, falls out of the frame, gathers himself and turns the image around to reveal a Hollywood set that resembles something out of The Wizard of Oz.\n\n“That is also one of my favorite scenes,” Berger laughs. “Jean-Claude Carrière, my favorite writer of all time, once said, ‘There’s only one rule in cinema. You have to surprise the audience.’ I like the idea that whenever I write the script it’s almost like a ‘Weeha!’ and I let myself go. In Robot Dreams, I brought a lot of references and inspirations from The Wizard of Oz to Buster Keaton and Busby Berkeley. I mix it all together. One of my favorite animators, Osamu Tezuka, is the king of breaking the fourth wall, and it’s also a homage to him.” The aspect ratio had to be taken in consideration to effectively accomplish the visual gag. “We were thinking about the previous shot so we could trick the audience. It should feel like a surprise, so we had to reduce the aspect ratio to be able to do that surprising effect,” Berger remarks.\n\nStoryboards are a major part of the filmmaking process. “Even for my live-action films, I spend a year doing the storyboards. Especially when you make an animated film, the storyboard is the treasure map,” Berger explains. “Every single shot, the angle, size and duration are already planned. In a way, before the animation started, we had the film already finished. We made it with a small team – five people working for a year and a half to make a rough animation. Every shot is clear. Of course, then you can do small changes when you begin to do the animation.” The source material broke the fourth wall in way that worked within the confines of a comic book panel. Notes Berger, “In the graphic novel you just see Robot getting out of the square, but it gave me an idea that I wrote in the script. When I started doing the storyboards, I had to decide where to put the camera for every single shot. Once you get animators and animation directors, they can bring you things. Animators are like actors and can propose certain actions.”\n\nGrunts and groans replaced actual lines of dialogue by the characters. “I had great support from the voice director, who was also the voice of Dog, Ivan Labanda,” Berger explains. “All of the big Hollywood films that have young characters are dubbed by him. For us, it was important to have a little giggle or laugh. It was a different kind of acting, but in our case it was pleasurable. I was not alone doing this. Ivan cast a group of his friends to do it, which became a little ensemble. With six actors, we created all of the voices, grunts, laughs, screams and little noises. For example, during the sledge race in snow, the Anteaters had to make specific noises. It was definitely hard work, but we also had a fun time doing it.”\n\nNuances, such as cheese from the macaroni splattering against the glass window of the microwave, had to be meticulously orchestrated yet feel accidental. “You have to realize, I’m a live-action director,” Berger notes. “If directors have one superpower, we can close our eyes and see our film finished. However, in live-action, there are so many accidents that the film changes completely from what you were thinking about. In animation, the final film comes close to the dream, so I can feel my fingerprints in every single frame. Of course, I’m working with a big team of artists, but I was involved with every single detail that happens because what you have to realize is, first you do the storyboard followed by layout, rough animation and then final animation; there are so many steps that you can make small adjustments.”\n\nAn interesting creative choice was not to give Robot mechanical actions. “The trending topic nowadays is AI and robots, but we started this film over five years ago,” Berger observes. “This robot is a metaphor for a friend, lover or companion. It doesn’t have any chip inside. There is no software. It’s like gears, wheels, bolts and springs. We wanted to do an old-style robot from the 1950s. It was also inspired by Hayao Miyazaki’s Laputa: Castle in the Sky.” Introducing motion meant that some of the character designs had to be altered. “Daniel Fernandez designed the characters, but then it was important when Animation Director Benoît Féroumon got involved. Initially, Robot was much rounder in the character design, but then early on Benoît said, ‘We need more rough edges so we can make it more 360.’ The designs at the end had to be approved by the animation director because he’s the one who is going to have to animate.”\n\nOne of the clever moments is when Robot teaches a chick to fly through the motions of his mouth. “I love the idea in animation that with just two circles and one dot you have an eye and with a single line you have a mouth, and how many things you can express with just one line,” Berger reveals. “And how, with the mouth, Robot can teach the bird to fly; we worked a lot on that one. In the first storyboard, he did it with the eyelids going up and down, but then we realized it wasn’t so clear. Suddenly, we decided to do it with the mouth. It’s a collaboration. The director gets the credit of the film, ‘A Film by Pablo Berger’; however, I had Benoît Féroumont, Sylvain Chomet [French writer and animator], Tom Moore [Co-Founder of Cartoon Saloon] and Art Director José Luis Ágreda, who has made amazing films. You feel like you have good players next to you, and they helped me in the making a lot of the decisions.”\n\n2D animation was chosen over a 3D style. “As a kid growing up in the 1960s and 1970s, everything was hand-drawn animation,” Berger states. “Robot Dreams takes place in the 1980s and is based on a graphic novel. For me, it was important that when people watch the film, they have to feel like it’s a graphic novel that is alive. We did not have any doubts thinking about 2D or 3D. 2D was definitely much more complex to find a team because there are so few animators in the world nowadays who know how to draw and create in 2D. Most animated films are using 3D. I also believe that when you want to create something new, you have to look to the past. I don’t think you always have to look forward. Hand-drawn animation still has so much to offer to animation. We can talk about Spider-Verse animated movies, which use 3D, but they’re doing an old style so that it looks like 2D. Why not?”\n\nThe growing popularity of adult animation has led to a hybrid approach to animation. “There is this amazing software called Blender, and you can combine with 2D,” Berger remarks. “You can get the best of both worlds. One of my favorite animated films in recent years is I Lost My Body, which has 2D and 3D, but you don’t notice it. Whatever works to tell the story.” In order to get the television screen to illuminate the face of Dog, some digital compositing was needed. “The good thing about doing a 2D hand-drawn film now is you can use digital compositing software and different ways to provoke color correction. You use visual effects elements in a 2D world because in the end you’re doing compositing as well.”\n\nAlong with making the transition to animation, Berger had to set up a pop-up studio called Lokiz Films, which has 100 animators working in Madrid and Pamplona. “We were going to make this film with Cartoon Saloon, and suddenly we are not,” Berger recalls. “And it’s my first animated film. We had to make this big decision. I thought I was Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, ‘Let’s put a show!’ Let’s make a pop-up animation studio. That was the hardest thing. We looked for animators all over Europe. It was the time of COVID-19. We didn’t want to work remotely. It was mandatory that the animators had to come to Madrid or Pamplona. It was absolutely hell!”\n\nAlso, a pipeline was being created from scratch. “The first time I heard the word ‘pipeline’ was in animation because we don’t use that term in live-action,” Berger reveals. “‘Pipeline? What is a pipeline!?’ Someone explained to me the animation pipeline, and I went, ‘But this doesn’t work for me!’ It was hard work to create a pipeline that worked for me. For me, the scenes had to be truthful, good acting, and I had to see them in continuity. I couldn’t think about a shot; in animation and visual effects we talk about the shot. For me, it had to be beats of 30 seconds or one minute to approve.”\n\nNot having to convert the methodologies of an established animation studio was beneficial. “At the beginning we thought it could be suicidal to create a studio, but after three or four months of fighting we realized, ‘This is working. We’re doing things our own way,’” Berger states. “We created our own pipeline. Although I love Cartoon Saloon and have been in Kilkenny, I know if we had done Robot Dreams with them, it would have had a Cartoon Saloon-like style, which is great, but this gave it a unique personality; we created our own style of animation. Benoît Féroumont worked on The Triplets of Belleville as an animation director, so the spirit of Sylvian Chomet is in the film. And Benoît also worked with Tom Moore on The Secret of Kells, so he knew Cartoon Saloon as well. Definitely, Benoît brought a lot of knowledge, and his style is in the film.”\n\nCentral throughout is the song “September” by Earth, Wind & Fire. “In the first draft of the script, it was already ‘September’ because I needed a song that Dog and Robot could roller-dance to in Central Park,” Berger explains. “Then I realized, what if this song becomes the theme of the film? It was great to have that decision so early on. The producers were not happy in the beginning because music rights are expensive, and if you want one of the most popular songs in pop history – it was an expensive song. But it was worth every penny that we spent. My producers spoiled me, and were able to put it into the budget. Definitely, the music was key. Not only the diegetic music like ‘September’ but also Alfonso de Vilallonga’s [Composer] created a beautiful, jazzy, original soundtrack with strong melodies of piano. I could say that Robot Dreams is musical. When you don’t have dialogue, music becomes the voice of the characters.”\n\nNew York City in the 1980s is a principal cast member. “Without a doubt, New York is the third protagonist of the film next to Robot and Dog,” Berger remarks. “But in the graphic novel, New York is not there. It’s just an American city. For me, to make New York a protagonist was key. I did a masters in film at NYU, then continued to live in New York for 10 years. This was my love letter to New York, and you cannot have New York without New Yorkers! What a better metaphor than to have a jungle of animals representing all New Yorkers. Sometimes with animated films, the characters in the background don’t move, but for me every single character in the background had to be doing something and dressed in a specific way. They have to have personality. That’s a good thing about animation. You can watch an animated film many times because they’re so rich in details. For people who love Robot Dreams, it’s worth to see it a second time just looking at the characters in the background!”\n\nThere are some dark moments with Robot getting a leg chopped off and his head severed. “I realized early on in the process that although it was an ‘animated film,’ this was no different from my live-action films,” Berger states. “Instead of using a camera, I was using artists who were drawing. The tone connects with my previous films. All of my films are tragic comedies; there is humor but also a lot of drama. I love that my films are filled with emotion. I love to think that Robot Dreams is a roller-coaster ride of emotions. Like in real life, there is drama. I hope that Robot Dreams will move people in many deep ways and they can have an emotional connection with the story. Drama is a big part of Robot Dreams.”\n\nInspiring the visuals was the source material. “The graphic novel by Sara Varon has what is called ‘ligne claire’ in French, which means ‘clear lines,’” Berger notes. “It’s an aggregate style from French and Belgium comic books. The colors are solid and the palette is stylized. It was important to get the New York colors, the buildings and streets, and the colors of the cars. It was also inspired by the research to have an 1980s feeling in the film. It had to be like candy. The film had to be very appealing visually, so the color is a big protagonist as well.” Close-up shots are part of the visual language. “I made a film called Blancanieves, which didn’t have dialogue. When you have to tell the story with images, you need numerous close-ups. Robot Dreams is filled with close-ups and dollies, but what you need is a lot of shots to make the film feel alive. It’s a combination of how I make films and the needs of a dialogue-free film.”\n\n“One of the most complex shots is the first time that Robot and Dog walk on the street together,” Berger states. “There is a long wide shot that is almost 10 seconds of traveling, and you see Robot and Dog, the Boar dancing; there are so many characters at the same time, and we have cars. Also, to find how Robot walks was one of the first things we did. Maybe the next time, if I do a live-action film I would even do an animatic, a moving storyboard.”\n\nRobot Dreams was not made for a specific demographic. “It’s for cinephiles,” Berger notes, “for people who want to go to the movies every weekend and have a fun time, and for kids. It’s a film that does not exclude audience members. It’s made of different layers, and every type of audience will get a different layer. That is what made this film unique for me.” Being an Academy Award nominee was something to treasure. “It was a great adventure. It was fantastic to go to the Oscars and meet other fellow directors. I even got to meet the great Steven Spielberg. I chatted with him. That was my Oscar!”\n\n“This is the first show that I’ve done where I was the overall Production Visual Effects Supervisor, so straight away it was a different experience,” Foddy states. “I’ve spent a lot of time on set for various projects before but have never been involved quite as early as I was on The Acolyte. As the Production Visual Effects Supervisor, you’re onboard from day one, so I was party to original drafts of scripts and had a creative voice throughout all of the prep. That was fantastic, and I’m keen to stay in a production role.”\n\nOther differences were prevalent. “It was a change from things I’ve worked on over recent years. I’ve done quite a lot of big Marvel films and various other Star Wars projects where they had a lot more reliance on CG content,” Foddy notes. “Leslye Headland wanted to try to keep everything real and practical. The mantra was, ‘What would have George Lucas done when he was making the original trilogy?’ Creatures and sets should be real. I had to approach the project with the view to minimizing the number of visual effects in most shots.” Despite the practical mantra, CG elements were unavoidable. “One thing that is all CG are the ships with the exception of a shot where we used a miniature. “Often, we had a practical ramp, or the inside of a compartment was a real set, but whenever you see the whole ship from the outside, whether it’s on the ground or out in space, those area always CG. The ships were designed by Kevin Jenkins [Production Designer] and the art department, and they always built physical models. Quite often, we had gray scale or balsawood models. We always had something there to visualize the form of the ship before getting it into CG; that allowed us to talk about things like the scale of the ship and what movement characteristics would they have when in space.”\n\nCG also assisted in transitioning a signature pink Lightsaber from The High Republic novels into its cinematic counterpart. “Full confession,” declares Foddy. “While all of the other Lightsabers do have tubes of LED lights, the Lightwhip itself did not have a practical component for safety reasons, as well as for technical and practical ones. The Lightwhip was something that Leslye desperately wanted to get into the show. I tasked the ILM art department with coming up with various concepts for how the Lightwhip might work and engaged in lengthy discussions with Pablo Hidalgo [a creative executive in story development at Lucasfilm] to make sure we got this right. Not only did we want to respect the fans of The High Republic novels but also discuss the technology of a Lightsaber and the physics of how the blade would work. We worked that out with Pablo to make sure that we did the whip so it felt plausible. We explored lots of different looks and pursued the idea that maybe the whip was made from small sections of a chain consisting of short Lightsaber blades or like a cat o’ nine tails that had more than one strand. Ultimately, we came down to the simplicity of the single strand. It’s down to the nonchalance of how Vernestra Rwoh uses the whip as well. There is the touch of Indiana Jones in the way she flicks it. Leslye was keen to make sure we see that the Lightwhip is not only the badass weapon, but that Vernestra looks like a total badass when she uses it. It is a normal Lightsaber and has been modified to turn into the whip. There is an instance when Vernestra deploys or retracts the whip, and it snaps into a straight blade before returning into the hilt.”\n\nMartial arts and ninja tactics such as throwing daggers were incorporated into the lightsaber fight choreography. “Wherever we could do it for real. we did it for real,” Foddy explains. “Obviously, you can’t throw real knives, but we did have rubber-bladed ones that could be thrown; however, that is still dangerous. In Episode 101, when Mae [Amandla Stenberg] is fighting Indara Force [Carrie-Ann Moss], who snatches the knives from her – that was a mixture of cunning switcheroos on the day [of shooting]. Amandla Stenberg would hold the knives in position, we’d cut the camera, she’d drop the knives, then we would run the camera again. There are some CG knives in the instances where they’re thrown or when Indara Force pulls them out of Mae’s belt. Most of the shots where you see Mae flipping the knives into her hands, that’s all real. Amandla learned all of the knife skills and the manual dexterity to do those things, like twirling the knives from her palm into her grasp.”\n\nTwins Leah and Lauren Brady were used for the scenes of Young Mae and Young Osha, while Amandla Stenberg portrays the adult versions of both sisters. “You will see more of the adult twins together as the series progresses,” Foddy reveals. “It has been a mixed approach. Amandla had a performance-double named Shanice Archer, who was fantastic, and she spent several months in prep with a movement coach learning to adopt Amandla’s physicality. All of the over the shoulders are Shanice. Quite a few shots have split screens. Also, we had quite a lot of involvement in the walk-throughs with the directors of photography and talked about how we could shoot scenes in a way that favored over the shoulders or seeing the two girls from behind. There are only very few instances where we had to worry about being able to do both of the twins’ faces. As well as split screens, we quite often shoot switcheroos as well, where I would literally have the girls swap places. In some cases, that gave us a facial element to put on the other actor who was done in the exactly same lighting conditions and camera position.”\n\nImpacting the world-building was the time period of the High Republic. “We are 100 years before the prequels. This is something we consulted with Pablo Hidalgo and Dave Filoni [CCO at Lucasfilm] about,” Foddy states. “Dave pointed out that the Republic has existed for thousands of years, so technology evolves at a fairly slow rate in the Star Wars universe. What that meant is, for the previous 100 years, things are not going to look radically different in terms of ship design, technology available or weapons. We did change a few little things to help sell that 100 years. If you look at Coruscant, the city is constantly building on top of itself, and the layers keep growing. A hundred years earlier, the surrounding buildings around the Jedi temple were all a bit lower. You can see that in some of the establishing shots. It’s a subtle touch while still keeping it recognizable for the audience. A good example of different technology are the ships. While the ships are capable of hyperspace travel, hyper drives at this point in time are so big and bulky that they’re a separate attachment. We’ve seen this in the Star Wars prequel films where ships have a hyper drive ring that they attach to the ship that allows them to travel at light speed. Every ship in this era has to have an attachment because they’re too big and bulky. We see that in Episode 101. When the Polan-717 arrives at Karlach, it detaches from its rear section and makes its way down to the planet.”\n\nFull CG elements were among the most complex to design, create and execute. “The Coruscant establishers were quite a lot of work to provide all the level of detail of the city and the ships flying in the background,” Foddy remarks. “For Episode 103, with the big fortress on the top of the mountain [which features fire and destruction], anytime you bring effects simulations into the mix and animation, that’s where things get complicated. There were lots of layers going into the composite and multiple departments involved. There is also some complex creature work. In Episode 103, the look development for the translucent butterfly creatures that the girls are playing with at the opening took a long time to get right. There is an almost Jell-O-like feel, and you can see light scattering through them. They had an iridescence to them. That was complex work to get that looking right and feeling natural, in particular when the creature lands on her finger and sits there.”\n\nThe Acolyte forges its own way narratively and aesthetically. “The Acolyte is the first live-action series to explore new characters in a completely new story arc outside of [LEGO Star Wars:] The Skywalker Saga. When Disney acquired Star Wars, there was talk about exploring the Star Wars universe, and that is what The Acolyte is doing. It’s allowing existing Star Wars fans to see more of what goes on in the other planets and in the history of the galaxy prior to the times that we’ve seen in the films. Also, for people new to Star Wars, you come at this fresh and don’t have to have seen any of the other films or books because it’s all new characters. Hopefully, it will open your eyes to the bigger galaxy.”\n\nAn iconic visual element is the gold-colored visor worn by the UNSC Marine Corps led by the Master Chief. “You would not believe how much attention was paid to the color of the visors,” states Visual Effects Supervisor Wojciech Zielinski. “It poses many challenges. For starters, visors are reflective, so every close-up for us means painting out the camera crew. At the same time, with the tint and coating that the visors got, quite often the actors couldn’t wear the helmets with the visors on. They are performing in different environments and lighting conditions, and quite often for safety the visors had to be removed; later on in post we had to add them.”\n\nAtmospherics such as smoke and mist play a heavy role in battle sequences, which means that there has to be tight relationship between stunts, special effects and visual effects. “A big proponent of the show is having practical elements as much as possible; however, there is a fine line,” Zielinski notes. “We always have to figure out what is the right level for the visual effects. We prefer to add more atmosphere or smoke in post. I like to have a base level that we match into; it was quite an organic process. It is tricky to maintain the same level throughout the shots, so later on we had to make sure that the level was consistent in post.” The density of smoke heightened the dramatic tension. “Quite often, our goal was to have the Jackals [a grouping of the Kig-Yar race] covered in smoke to add more character and something lurking in the smoke. Sometimes, the story literally calls for just a silhouette, but still we believe that the audience will understand, see and read the intention from the storyline.” The Jackals make use of lethal energy shields. “The shields almost look the same as the ones from Season 1. This is something that we didn’t want to play with in Season 2. The look of the shields is close to what they look like in the game. We want to make sure that the gamers appreciate how much has been retained from the game,” Zielinski remarks.\n\nSeason 2 commences six months after the narrative of Season 1. “You wouldn’t see that much of a technological change; however, because of the approach of new Showrunner David Wiener, Season 2 had a slight tonal shift,” Zielinski notes. “The story is more grounded and centered around the characters. You want to make sure that all of the assets that we inherited from Season 1 will work with what David wanted to achieve. Therefore, we did play with the look development of the creatures.” Along with the Jackals are the parasitic alien lifeforms known as the Flood. “It is a tease because this is a big character in the game, but literally towards the end of Season 2 we are introducing the Flood, which will hopefully be further developed in Season 3. It’s like a fungus that takes over your body and transforms into a combat form. We sourced the design of the Flood from the game, then modified it a little bit to make it feel more alien and organic,” Zielinski describes.\n\nSignificantly involved with the production of Halo is Microsoft under the leadership of Kiki Wolfkill, who serves as an Executive Producer, and 343 Industries, which provided game references. “In general, all of the environments and creatures were either conceptualized by the Production Designer [James Foster] or the visual effects team,” Zielinski states. “Because of the new tonal style of the show, we’re trying to employ a more cinematic look. It is important that every time we’re with the actors, certain modern and dynamic camera moves that are in the games never end up being utilized because they don’t fit the aesthetic of the show.” A look book was created by the art department. “For every visual effect, we created our own concept art as well. In addition, all of those dynamic sequences were previs, and creature battles were rehearsed by the stunt team and directors before we got even to the camera.” Fight choreography was assisted by stuntvis. “It’s a collaboration between the director, stunt coordinator, whoever at the same time was the second unit director, and visual effects department. There are so many moving pieces, but it all starts with the story. It’s a heavy collaboration within a limited time,” Zielinski states.\n\nMore than 2,600 visual effects shots were created over a period of 14 months for the eight episodes. “We used some of the vendors working on Season 1, but at the same time we had to find a few others with a skillset that works well for the requirements of the sequence,” Zielinski observes. “Ultimately, we had 18 vendors, and that kept us busy! The heavy lifters were Luma Pictures, El Ranchito, Monkey Rave, Image Engine, Cúbica VFX and Rocket Science VFX. We had a few sequences where we had shared shots, which required a big coordination between the different vendors.” Episode 204, which has the Battle of the Reach, is the most action-packed. “We follow our heroes battling the Covenant forces attacking Reach City and trying to join the UNSC troops. What is interesting about the sequence are the so-called ‘oners.’ We had multiple shots that are seamlessly stitched. Those had to be well-rehearsed and prepared to make sure that all of the stitches are working well. Sometimes, the story requires a complex stitch, meaning that we have to make sure that the end of one take is matching as close as possible to the beginning of the other take. It literally took us multiple takes to find the right stitch points.”\n\nWorld-building consisted of hybrid and entirely CG environments with 75% of Aleria being a practical set while Camp Currahee was fully digital. “The Sanctuary sequence was shot in Iceland on a bluescreen stage,” Zielinski explains. “We’re trying to source as much from the Iceland location and capture as much data as well, knowing later on in post we will be building or augmenting that environment. As far as the Reach City goes, we created CG assets for all of the establishing shots. The asset had to be rebuilt from the ground up to accommodate the destruction of the city in Season 2. It all comes down to overplanning the design of the sequences so we actually know which part of the city will be destroyed and by what means; that makes our life much easier in post and ensures that we focus on the right parts of the asset.”\n\nA significant number of digital doubles had to be produced. “It was quite heavy for digital doubles, especially in the action moments in which we see the Spartans [mechanically and biologically-enhanced elite soldiers] moving fast,” Zielinski reveals. “It was quite difficult for the actors and stunt team to perform those actions in those heavy suits. Quite often, when you see Spartans running, jumping and climbing mountains, those are digital doubles. With the crowd duplication, we can’t always afford having 3,000 extras, so you design the scene or shot with a limited number of extras. You place them close to the camera then populate either the midground or background to set the right number for the shot.”\n\nThen there were the virtual companions. “The virtual companion employed the same technology as we did this season for Cortana,” Zielinski states. “We decided to change the approach from Season 1. In Season 1 Cortana was a full CG character. This time, we applied a hybrid approach; in our case, the character was based on plate photography. We shot an actress interacting or performing with other actors. From the plate, we used the face of the actress, then augmented that with a digital body and CG hair. For Cortana shots, we also built a special LED rig, which was integrated into her practical costume that gave us reactive light on the actor, other actors and the sets.”\n\nA staple of sci-fi are space battles. “It was quite exciting for all of us,” Zielinski acknowledges. “We were happy to finally see some space action. As you can imagine, space battles and space jumps are 99% a full CG creation. For the space battles, we had to redesign all of the fleets of the UNSC and Covenant forces. It has been quite a long process to figure out the choreography and geography of the space battles. On the screen it may seem straightforward, but actually it’s quite complex. I wanted to make sure that the audience is not disorientated and understands the flow of the story in those shots.”\n\n“I had spent most of my career as a freelancer, so I haven’t experienced the nitty-gritty of productions,” states Vivienne Medrano, Creator, Executive Producer, Showrunner and Writer of Hazbin Hotel. “I’ve mostly done visual development and things that never got to see the light of day. Hazbin Hotel is different in the sense that it came from a proof concept that went viral and also had the benefit of a company like A24 that is risk-taking. It’s definitely not easy to put into a box that exists in the adult animation world, and I’m excited because the adult animation world is starting to bloom into something different, and we’re seeing more diversity in the shows.” Putting together a new pilot was complicated. “We only had eight episodes and a tight time to tell the story. I didn’t want to waste an episode on redoing the original pilot. We had to get the same information across, re-establish the world and characters, but also tell a new story with new characters and villains,” Medrano says.\n\nHow Bruce Timm draws women, like Harlequin and Poison Ivy, the exaggerated shape language of Tim Burton, cartoonist Jhonen Vasquez and classic Warner Bros. Animation and Disney were major influences. “It was fun to explore how to find an identity for the show and the style,” Medrano remarks. “The other aspect of my style is that it’s detailed with a lot of stripes; that’s a Tim Burtonism! I like specific outfits and accessories. It’s catered to my sensibilities.” Angel Dust was simplified, while a different idea for Charlie was introduced, especially with her braids. “Because it’s a hand-drawn show, I wanted to take off some of the superfluous details that were in the [original] pilot. However, I wanted to maintain those iconic, striking designs. Also, there were changes I always wanted to make to begin with from [original] pilot but we were too far in to do that.” Black and red dominate the color palette. “The biggest challenge of the show for my art director, Sam Miller, is that it’s a lot of red characters on numerous red backgrounds. It was a challenge to find the right balance and the tones of the reds that we use. I’m trying to lean more into contrast in the second season,” Medrano explains.\n\nRevisions are articulated by drawing over the work of artists. “I would red-line the change that I want; that’s usually the easiest because they can take that and finalize it,” Medrano states. “I do that with character designs and ever so often with backgrounds. For storyboards, I also direct, so I do thumbnails. I use a Wacom Cintiq tablet where you can directly draw on to. I have a bigger one that I’ve worked on since college and a smaller version that I use often. You can have it on your lap and work. It’s much more mobile.” Adult animation has provided more of an opportunity to blend 2D and 3D techniques. “The combination of 3D and 2D is cool. A great example is Arcane where they could have the 3D style, but it still has an artistic layering of texture. However, all of the effects are done in 2D, like fire and smoke. 2D effects are the coolest looking. For Hazbin Hotel, we don’t utilize a ton of 3D because it’s outside the process and pipeline of being a 2D show. On my other series, Helluva Boss, we utilized 3D a couple of times, and it’s fun to stylize the 3D to match the 2D world.”\n\nCollaborating on her third project with Medrano is Skye Henwood. “It’s an across-the-ocean story of an online relationship working out,” states Skye Henwood, Animation Director at SpindleHorse Toons. “I needed a job, she had a job opening, and I joined her studio. We ended up in a studio chatroom, and it was like an instant click. Now, it’s an Amazon show, and everybody knows the name. It’s crazy!” SpindleHorse Toons animated Episode 108 while Princess Bento was responsible for the rest of the series. “It’s all done digitally. Even the storyboards. We use Wacoms and work in Toon Boom Harmony. I’ve made like a million guides on how to do a basic shot. The stylization is easier in a way because the policy that Viv, Sam Miller, and I have is, as long as it looks cool or appealing, that’s it. It doesn’t necessarily have to look like the model sheet. You can stretch Charlie, make her eyes big, and if it’s cute or funny enough it’s getting in. There is a lot of creative freedom. This show is for artists by artists,” Henwood states.\n\nStoryboards and animatics are an essential part of the creative process. “The strength of the boards is the strength of the series,” Medrano notes. “I’m excited because for the second season we have some incredible artists joining and have more action, so there’s more of a uniqueness to the technique of the boards.” The poses of the characters are figured out in the storyboards. “We don’t usually invent many new ones from the boards. Thankfully, for Season 1 we had some fantastic board artists, in particular for the song sequences. Then my studio [SpindleHorse Toons] was able to do a little of the animation plus the boards. I’m glad that we got to do that because it heightened those moments.” The songs are vital during the writing stage. “The challenge for Season 1 was that I wanted the songs to be the length that they needed to be. Because we have a tight 22-minute run time, we had to work closely with the songwriters and figure out what part of the script was going to be music and what genre of music. What I love about musicals is that they go hand-in-hand with animation. The characters get to be really expressive, and the songs get to be bombastic and ‘out there,’” Medrano observes.\n\n“We have the music from the start, so we don’t have to go back and change it,” Henwood remarks. “Dealing with a musical in animation is hard because musicals are beautiful and so ‘out there’ and over-the-top, we have to get that ‘Wow!’ feeling, and there are reasons for why things are done in live-action and animation. We have to compromise and find how we can fit the wonders of a musical into a 2D TV animation. We find a way to make the reason why the character sings believable. It’s important to try to feel seamless when starting those musical moments.” Henwood did the first shots animated for Season 1. “I wanted to make it simple enough that any studio could do it, yet also capturing Viv’s emotions and style of drawing, which is the hardest thing because we draw every frame ourselves,” he says.\n\nMaintaining the proper poses is more difficult for some characters compared to others. “There is a spider demon and he has four arms, so when you’re having someone cross their arms, what are his bottom arms doing?” Henwood comments. “You have to come up with that. If he is angry or sassy, maybe on his hips. You have to make sure that looks appealing. We don’t want to hide his arms behind him. It’s thought out. My favorite trivia is Vox. We have a rule that he can’t be seen sideways because he’s a flat-screen TV. You’ll notice that even if Vox should turn around to leave a shot, his head will stay forward.” The one who has changed the most and for the better is Angel Dust. “In older iterations, he was more monstrous and had a poison skull on his chest. But as Viv was realizing this character, Angel Dust became this cutesy guy. My favorite part of all of the design changes is, right before we started animating it, Viv let me have my opinion on how to simplify them.” Jeremy Jordan has made clever vocal choices for Lucifer Morningstar. “Jeremy gets into that booth and does the silliest little takes we have ever heard. My favorite thing he does is what we call the ‘Lucifer wheeze.’ In Episode 105, Jeremy is coughing the name ‘Charlie.’ It’s really fun because that wasn’t in the script,” Henwood reveals.\n\nThe world-building for Hazbin Hotel has been a natural evolution. “Something that I’ve started working on is a bible of all the information that has been established about this world and rules that need to be maintained,” Medrano says. “It’s challenging because I have my other series, Helluva Boss, which is a different side of this expansive world. We have to make sure that there is a consistency because our audience will notice and care.” Adding life to the world is the background action. “It’s easier for the animators and less distracting to have a silhouetted character in the background; that is something stylistically I do a lot,” Medrano adds. One of the changes from the original pilot is having an entirely different voice cast. “I have the characters figured out and need to find the right voice. I have specific voices in mind. With Hazbin Hotel, we had the pilot where we established some voices that the audience was attached to. It was important to maintain a sense of cohesion between the two casts. When it came to casting for the new series, it was a re-audition for the original cast and new people. The actors we ended up going with were good at maintaining that original sound and vibe of the characters that I wanted and was attached to, but also bringing with it the musicality and singing talent that was needed for the show. Once we had the final cast, everything locked together, and it was exactly what I had envisioned – but I am picky about casting.”\n\nA number of characters are exaggerated representations of Medrano. “Angel Dust is nothing like me, but I put a lot personal trauma and experiences in him,” Medrano states. “Charlie is a lot like me in the sense that she is a driven and determined person in a world that can be hard and naysaying. There is part of me in Vaggie when it comes to being more practical and reserved; she’s more of a worrier and feisty. Like a lot of creators, I try to put in a little piece of real me, but it also came from things that I feel add to the story or character tropes that I enjoy. Niffty and Lucifer are catered to my sensibilities because I like the zanier, sillier characters as well.” Showcasing the most action and characters was Episode 108.\n\n“There is a shot where the camera is following characters through the battle, and it was comprised of two different shots that seamlessly come together as one,” Medrano remarks. “We start with Angel Dust and Cherri Bomb, who jumps up and throws a bomb. Then the bomb explosion transitions to another character. It was a challenge in the sense that the hookup had to be specific. There’s a lot of characters. There is a giant shield that had effects on it, so we had to make sure that the background was tracking and the camera was working with it while the effect was going on. That was a technical shot, but it turned out fantastic.”\n\nVisual effects are seen as way of elevating the dramatic or comedic aspect of a scene. “There is a lot of punctuation, and he uses visual effects in that way to either set up a scene or environment,” Wanstreet notes. “We had lots of flies and rats, different small creatures that normally are throwaways, but he uses them in a manner to heighten the reality of whatever scene that you’re in. We had one shot where the Captain and the General are in the latrine talking back and forth, and flies everywhere. The General is irritated; a fly comes in, lands on his cheek and then flies off. There are tons of subtlety and little things that director Park does where most people wouldn’t think, ‘Let’s do a visual effects fly for comedy relief in this tense situation.’ But he is constantly doing these things that are contradictory to what is being established.”\n\nAtmospherics, such as enhancing cigarette smoke, were important. “There were moments where we matched cut one person blowing out smoke to another blowing out smoke,” Wanstreet reveals. “There is one where Sofia Mori is in the Vietnamese restaurant and Captain is outside talking to Bon. We transition from Sofia blowing out smoke to then Captain match cut blowing out the exact same level of smoke; these specific details where color and amount [of smoke] director Park wants them to match back and forth. Later, when Sofia Moi and Captain are lying in bed together and are smoking together, he wanted to have exact same cigarette smoke across the two of them so there’s enhancement of cigarette smoke in there to make everything exact between the two.”\n\nScene transitions are meticulously planned with a particular one standing out. “After we see Bon’s legs running down an airport runway while carrying his dead wife, the scene transitions into the Captain’s car driving on an American highway,” Park explains. “At this moment, Bon’s legs are still visible as a reflection on the car body. This is a scene transition that brilliantly connects two timelines/two countries through the visual connection of running objects. The idea to show Bon’s legs on the car was entirely from Chad. It’s not often that the visual effects team spontaneously brings new ideas, as it is hard enough to fulfill requests of the director. However, Chad has done so for this scene and many others.”\n\nDigital assistance was provided to some of the scene transitions, such as when Captain is crossing names off of the evacuation list. “We definitely helped out with that,” Wanstreet notes. “As you know, director Park is specific as far as lines being in parallel or how they converge. Composition is important to him. We took the footage and skewed it, realigned it and did some stuff to make it lay out better on the page. There is a little bit of elements to that ruler that are also visual effects. When Captain pulls it across, that wipe, we’re carrying that and roto his hand so as it comes in the background it’s there, but then the hand brings the rest of it in. That was one of the things he and I worked back and forth on to get that exactly the way he wanted because it was funky in the beginning.”\n\nFireworks proved to be complicated to execute. “This is one of those [situations] where a lot of people go into a scene like that [and say], ‘We’re going to put fireworks in the sky,’” Wanstreet remarks. “But director Park wanted the texture of the fireworks reflecting all throughout that scene, which is visually amazing, but you can imagine from budgetary standpoint, we’re like, ‘Okay.’ We had big practical lights on the night. Those were great for interactive lights on the people and in some of the environments, but then they made nasty reflections on some of the metallics and the wet-down. We had to paint all of that out and then add fireworks reflections back in, so it was more organic and broken up. But at least we had something to start with. We took whatever was going on in the panels in the sky, then matched our colors of our fireworks to those so we had a match between practical interactive light and visual effects firework.”\n\nHaving Robert Downey Jr. playing the roles of the priest, auteur. Claude (CIA agent), professor and Congressman harkens back to when Peter Sellers portrayed three characters in Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. “The team that came on to do the makeup had done Perry Mason previously, and we had an excellent prosthetic artist as well,” Wanstreet explains. “They were upfront when they thought there would be an issue, and we went in touched stuff up, but for the most part what you see is what they did. Robert in the steakhouse and lounge were thoroughly planned-out scenes because getting him into prosthetics took three hours for each one of the characters, depending on which character it was. In order to shoot that, we wound up breaking it into multiple days; there were two Roberts on one day and two Roberts on the next day. He would do all of his lines, and we had markers all over the table for where cameras were, so we could replay how we shot one for when the next one came in. When Robert went away to do the prosthetics for another character, we would film backgrounds, like crosses of waiters from the different camera angles. so when we did the split screens, there was always movement in the background.”\n\nWhen the time came to shoot the lounge scene, face replacements were necessary, which led to some unique challenges. “When we were scanning Robert, it came down from director Park that he wanted the Congressman to lick whipped cream off this escort with a face replacement,” Wanstreet recalls. “Because we’re doing FACS and all sorts of expressions, I go, ‘Alright Robert, I have one more expression for you. I need you to give me a face like you’re going to lick whipped cream off of a naked woman’s breasts.’ He looked at me as if to say, ‘What?’ I said, ‘Trust me. You’re going to lick whipped cream off of this woman.’ Robert sits there for a second and goes, ‘Alright. I’ve got it.’ He makes this crazy expression, we scanned him, and he goes, ‘I’ve got a different one.’ We did that one as well. Then Robert comes out, and I go, ‘You’re probably one of the most scanned actors in the world. Have you ever had to pose for licking whipped cream off of a naked woman?’ He goes, ‘No. You’ve got the first, Chad.’”\n\nA personal first for Wanstreet involved a certain cactus. “Because director Park has this specific visual style, there were a lot of little things that popped up all over the place,” Wanstreet explains. “After Xuande gets blown up in Episode 105, he brought a cactus, and there was a line about a prickly dick. The cactus that we had on set wasn’t cactus enough and didn’t have the right needles; that became a thing. It was like, ‘Wait a minute. What?’ We had to add more needles to this cactus, which is something I’ve never had to do before.” Another fun shot featured an alligator in a swimming pool. “We had a remote-control alligator head on the day to give an eyeline for Robert. We would rehearse and take it away. Robert did wonderfully, as far as acting as if there’s an alligator in the water when there clearly is not. Those were complicated shots. Just getting the right number of bubbles and the cavitation correct.”\n\nLocations were the primary focus. “We filmed in Los Angeles, and when we went to Thailand it was all location shooting,” Wanstreet states. “We did one day of bluescreen, and that’s where we have Xuande going through the air. We had found a little road in Phuket that looked more French and had similar tones of what you might see in Vietnam. We spent about a month and a half going in and around the Bangkok area, then ended up in Phuket, Phang Nga, Nakhon Si Thammarat and Ban Phai. We were moving all around the country for bespoke one-off spots that we would augment with visual effects in post by adding monuments and things that were particular to that time. In Episode 101, when they do the farewell tour and drive through downtown Saigon, specific landmarks were wanted. There’s the opera house, ARVN monument and palace. I had gone to Vietnam and taken some photography, but all of those buildings had changed a ton since current day and 1975.”\n\nAround 1,200 visual effects shots were created for the miniseries, with the main vendors being Ingenuity Studios and Barnstorm VFX, along with Zoic Studios, Yannix, Incessant Rain Studios, BOT VFX, Mr. Wolf, Van Dyke VFX and Pidantic VFX. “I work differently than a lot of people in that I have all of my shots pre-tracked on my show,” Wanstreet says. “Yannix did all tracking and touched almost everything in every episode. We handed that off to whoever the vendor was and also did paintwork. There are lot of shots where one person is painting or tracking, and then somebody else is adding maybe the set extension. There were also elements like the flares that we were passing back and forth because that’s something that showed up a lot and was a thematic element that was in Episode 101, and we see it again in Episode 107, tying those two anchor points in those episodes. The helicopter was also a shared asset that moved around with different vendors; the same thing with the jet.”\n\nElaborate re-timed split screens were incorporated into a couple of the 4,000 frame shots. “They don’t sound gnarly, but one of them in particular was when we filmed in the interrogation room where the Watchman was and there were metal grates all over the place,” Wanstreet recalls. “When you start to do a re-time in a room like that, it warbles and distorts like crazy. We cleaned up all that stuff over 4,000 frames, and there was some stuff on the floor that we needed to remove. There were reflections of the camera guy and Kim Ji-yong [Cinematographer] in the glass; over 4,000 frames, you’re removing him over Robert’s face. We’re painting all of that out and trying to keep all of the metal grates exactly in line.” Lens aberrations were important. “Obviously, if you’re nighttime and an explosion goes off, as a DP you have two decisions: You can try to expose for the fire or your talent. We were constantly playing with getting this perfect blend where we would see the fire detail for a moment and our actors would go out and everything is black. You would get flares and then pull back so you’re seeing the talent again, and the explosions goes out and they’re brighter.”\n\nAs for the experience of collaborating with Park Chan-wook and Robert Downey Jr., Wanstreet remarks, “Working with director Park and Team Downey, who have a clear vision, you could imagine that there is this potential for a clash. That’s not what happened at all. Team Downey loved director Park and gave him a lot of latitude to do what he wanted to do. The two of them worked hand-in-hand.” When it comes to naming his favorite moments, Wanstreet answers, “I love the explosion of the theater and the finale as well. The ocean at the end is pretty and beautiful. There is a lot of stuff that is great in Episode 107. When the Captain releases the alligator into the auteur’s pool is wonderful work.”\n\nZaillian envisioned from day one that the show was going to be in black and white, so it was essential to develop a unique but efficient workflow for the internal VFX team and VFX vendors. “Early on, we even considered a workflow in which vendors would deliver two deliverables of every single shot submission, one in color and one in black and white,” VFX Producer Joseph Servodio notes. “However, since we had over 2,000 shots, you can only imagine how much media management that would create for the vendors, VFX team and Editorial. Ultimately, what made the most sense was to work on the shots in color, then our team presented them to Steve, predominately within cut context in our black and white look. Occasionally during reviews, we would flip back to the color look just as a quality check. Since black and white tended to be more forgiving, we would sometimes be able to see flaws in the color that we otherwise didn’t catch in the black-and-white viewing.”\n\nSince Bowers was joining a show that was already in progress, he was able to watch rough assembled cuts. “The visual effects when I joined were in varying states of completion,” Bowers notes. “Our director had actually been working on the show for years at that point, having started writing Ripley in 2019. My job was to come in and ask him as many questions as I could to understand his vision, both in general terms and for specific sequences and shots. We also always knew that Steve’s vision was to present the show in black and white. We did VFX work in color throughout, but editorial was cutting in black and white, so we were always designing shots with an eye towards how clearly elements and compositions would appear in their final form. It was coming in and understanding the conversations that had already happened between Steve and his editors and figuring out from that point how to carry it forward to final.”\n\nThere were 2,146 visual effects shots in total, most of which consisted of train windows, bus windows and apartment windows, as well as environment extension work. “Episode 3 had 400 shots in it, with as many shots in one 16-minute sequence as existed in some entire episodes,” Bowers says. “We had teams working all over the world: EDI in Italy, Wētā FX in New Zealand and Redefine in Canada, India and Europe. In order to coordinate a team on that scale, you really have to have a consistent vision and clear communication. We always wanted to make sure that we were prioritizing and making progress on our most challenging shots, especially in Episode 3. With different vendors working on different things, we often had to work in batches to present the director with coherent sequences that were nearly complete before soliciting his feedback. It was risky, but for some sequences, it was the only path to success.”\n\nChris White was Wētā FX’s VFX Supervisor on the show. “We were given a rough cut of the show when we began work,” White explains. “You could quickly tell it was a beautiful show with solid compositions and lighting. The visual effects would also need to support this aesthetic – with attention to the subtle details of highlights, shadows, environment and composition. Creative reference is always an instrumental part of the process and gives us a clear target. Because the series had so many beautiful shots, we went through the season cut and requested footage of other shots to reference. We used the series cinematography as our first inspiration. I studied chiaroscuro at university many years ago, so I drew on my memories of those studies, along with references from the old masters and noir photography.”\n\nWētā FX’s work for the show included two types of shots: the boat action sequence, where each shot had a unique action, and a series of shots in a static location on the water. “For the action shots, our animation team crafted dynamic boats that could simulate motion through the water,” White says. “For the static shots, we invested in an automatic setup. Once the look of the sequence was established, we could run multiple shots through a setup and tweak each shot to taste. The setup was crafted as a primary lighting and comp scene, establishing the base look. The digi-double shots were the most challenging, but they also brought the most satisfaction. They needed to be spot-on likenesses to the actors, with the complexities of underwater clothing simulation, bubbles, hair motion and lighting while preserving detail. The way light exits skin underwater differs from in the air, so particular attention had to be paid to underwater digi-double rendering.”\n\nFor Bowers, the 16-minute boat sequence in Episode 3 was the most challenging sequence in the entirety of the show. “It’s the most important story point of the show. Everything in the first two episodes leads up to it, and everything that happens in the remaining five episodes happens because of it,” Bowers explains. “If people know just one thing about The Talented Mr. Ripley, it’s usually this murder scene. The success or failure of the show as an artistic endeavor really depended on the realism and the artistry of this one scene; that was the challenge for us, and those were the stakes. On the technical side, every shot of either Tom or Dickie underwater was a digi-double, and those were quite close-up angles. Andrew Scott, who plays Tom Ripley, is in frame for almost every shot of Ripley, so the audience would be intimately familiar with his face and expressions by this point in the show. To then hand off to a digi-double? In a close-up of his face, underwater? We had to get that exactly right.\n\nContinues Bowers, “Wētā FX did fantastic work throughout that sequence. The underwater effects they created to make the environment feel literally immersive was really outstanding work. There was one full-CG shot in particular – near the end of the scene – where the camera is pointing straight down into the water, and Dickie’s body is sinking down into the depths. That was definitely the most challenging visual effects shot to create in the entire series. It needed to feel still and quiet and sort of melancholy at the end, but we still wanted to have the feeling of the camera being 15 feet underwater and really present. The first version of that shot that we presented for creative approval was version 223, and the final comp was version 557, so it went through quite a lot of iteration.”\n\nGaia Bussolati served as EDI VFX Supervisor on the show. “We started work on this project in mid-2021. The inspection and pre-production began in June. We were involved from the very beginning,” Bussolati says. “Thanks to our well-established relationship with American supervisors and studios, the production’s head of post-production visited us and asked us what kind of structure we had, if we had supervisors who could stay on set and follow their director, considering that there would be other main suppliers involved in the project. We were then told that we would take care of the part set in northern Italy.”\n\nWhen Bussolati and EDI came onboard in the pre-production stages, they received the scripts for all the episodes, which they then read in order to understand the mood of the series. “The main concern since the very beginning seemed to be related to the locations. Even the simplest, Atrani, which was the best preserved, did not seem to have all the elements that could reveal the director’s vision. So we realized that the work ahead would have been designing locations by assembling different components from different sources. Like a collage. The director’s vision was very clear; he knew what he wanted, and this was translated into a work with great attention to the smallest detail.”\n\nSince everything was based on previous footage or existing locations, it was important for Bussolati and EDI to find documentation about Sanremo in the ’60s and Caravaggio’s paintings. “Our aim was to create the most realistic output for the story and the context, so any reference was based on real references. This meant a lot of historical and iconographic research on our end,” says Bussolati. EDI was responsible for all of the Caravaggio’s shots and worked on around hundred, spread over six episodes out of eight of the series. “We were also responsible for the St. Louis of the French Chapel in Rome, The Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence in Palermo and David with the Head of Goliath at Villa Borghese in Rome,” Bussolati adds.\n\n“In Episode 3,” Bussolati continues, “we worked on recreating Sanremo, since the original scene was shot in Anzio. We also worked on other paintings, including Picasso’s, which can be seen both in Atrani and Venice. Sanremo’s scenes on the boat were shot with blue skies and sunshine. But the narrative was intended to start with a slightly cloudy sky and end with an almost stormy one to match in continuity with another vendor’s following sequence. This implied a very careful work on each and every nuance. A couple of other interesting scenes were related to Caravaggio’s paintings. The one in the St. Louis of the French Chapel in Rome was shot in Naples with a greenscreen, and then we have rebuilt the chapel based on photo reliefs and database images. Then The Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence in Palermo, was quite challenging, since the original painting was stolen in 1969 – it is in the world list of the 10 most important stolen masterpieces. According to the story, there was still the original, so we had to reproduce the brushstroke, the cracks, the texture of the canvas, and this was done thanks to an accurate analysis of documents and historical references.”\n\nSubverting genres is something that American comic book writer, screenwriter and producer Robert Kirkman has done so well, whether it be zombies in The Walking Dead or superheroes in Invincible. The latter, which has been turned into an animated series for Prime Video. revolves around teenager Mark Grayson coming into his supernatural powers and having to deal with the revelation that his extraterrestrial father was sent not to protect but conquer Earth. The second season consisting of eight episodes was divided into half with Part 1 released in November 2023 and Part 2 in March and April 2024.\n\nInvincible is not the typical production in terms of size and scope. “I’ve never worked on a project that is this big,” remarks Marge Dean, Head of Animation for Skybound Entertainment. “It’s 45 to 50-minute episodes as opposed to a 22-minute episode, so it’s twice the amount of content. But also, the nature of Invincible is that in every episode there is a big fight scene, lots of destruction, a high body count, even the main characters are constantly in flux in how they look because they get beat up or shot. What that translates into is an awful lot of pencil mileage. We have to draw all of those things. A major lesson was learned by Dean. With the scope and the way story is, it’s more like three times the [average] episode.”\n\nOutsourcing animation to Korea has been going on since 1980s, so the industry pipeline has been refined. “We have 70 people working on the show, and that’s not counting the folks in Korea,” Dean explains. “You figure out the whole season and decide how each episode fits in there. Then you have those written, and that’s given to the team. The directors are responsible for keeping the whole thing intact and on track. Once it gets to Korea, they’re replicating what we created. We have done a refined [version] and worked out a map for them of what we want the main animation to be, and this is in the form of our storyboards, animatics and model packs. All of the information that they need is there. Then we have conversations with them. When they send us the show, if there are things that do not fit the continuity or story or is not what we instructed them to do. we call retakes and make them do it again. When we make a mistake and do a creative retake, they’re given extra compensation.”\n\nWhat has changed is the acceptance and popularity of adult animation around the world which has made shows like Invincible possible. “In North America and Europe, people believed that animation was for comedy or kids,” Dean notes. “Then as anime started working its way out of Japan, and we have Millennials and Generation Zs who have grown-up with 24/7 animation on the Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, and have a broader understanding of animation as a medium not a genre. Then ‘Adult Swim’ launched Toonami, which introduced anime to the general public, definitely in the U.S. and other parts of the world, and that blew the lid off because in Japan, they totally get that you can do animation for all of the different forms of audiences that you have. It’s okay to make stuff for people who have a specific interest. There can be mature themes and stakes, and the characters don’t have to be cute little kids but can be grungier older people or people starting their professional life.”\n\nGiven the strengths and needs of animation, the series is not an exact replica of the comic book source material. “Visually, everything has to be animated. We’re a hand-drawn animated program,” Kirkman states. “With comics, everybody is drawing those panels one or two times, so it’s easy to put crazy detail and little flourishes on everything. But there is a streamlining process for animation. Then, with the story, most of the changes come from hindsight. We have the benefit of the series being completed and a 144-issue roadmap. We’re able to say, ‘This story is more important because it comes into play in seven different issues.’ We can spend a little time on that scene and put more foreshadowing to certain things that are going to come. I didn’t have that when I was writing the comic book series. There were far reaching plans, but for the most part it was put together as I went along. It has turned the show into a second draft.”\n\nThe sensibilities of Kirkman were different when he began writing Invincible. “There are a few off-handed jokes in the old issues where I was like, ‘That doesn’t play so great these days,’” Kirkman notes. “We were able to broom those things out and make everything more modern and updated. There are things that are antiquated as well, like technology, because the comic book series is 20 years old. Another thing is I feel that I’ve improved as a writer, and so there’s a lot of, ‘I don’t like how this dialogue goes.’ Or, ‘I can make this sequence flow better.’ There is also this notion of trying to top myself, so you’ll notice that a lot of the big memorable moments in the Invincible television series are enhanced. An action sequence will go on longer or some sort of gut-wrenching sequence will have an element added to it that makes it more off-putting or nerve-racking, or the tension is heightened more. Some of that comes from the scenes in the comics weren’t moving and didn’t have sound, and the show has that, so there is more latitude you can take in the individual scenes to amp up the emotion, scares and intensity.”\n\nLessons were learned from turning the demonic-exorcism comic Super Dinosaur into an animated series for Teletoon in 2018. “That show was so unsuccessful people might not be aware that it even exists, but we did 26 episodes, a half hour, and it was CGI,” Kirkman recalls. “It takes a lot to build CGI assets because every single character is constructed, and there are a lot of things that go into that. A lot of the budget is adding new characters into the show. I knew that Invincible could never be limited with how many characters that I could introduce per episode because this is such a vast world, and there are sprawling aspects that would be hampered tremendously by a 3D pipeline. There is a rich history in superhero programs having a 2D animation look so we’re playing off of that.” There is CG animation in Invincible, but the amount was purposely reduced for Season 2. “Quite a lot was used in Season 1,” Dean states. “We still use an element of CG, such as to build our backgrounds that are sent to the overseas studio, but, ultimately, the background is drawn into the animation. The overseas studio usually has a CG team, and they may decide on their own to turn some vehicles into CG and blend them into the scene. We allow that to happen. That’s the extent of the CG.”\n\nViolence is depicted within reason. “I want to stay on a narrow path,” Kirkman states. “If you go too far into different things it can distract from your story. The cool thing is that we have never had any content restrictions placed upon us by Prime Video.” Each season needs to be bigger than the previous one, not only in action but also in emotion, character arcs and the cast interactions with each other. “We have to make sure we’re not repeating ourselves and hitting those same notes. We’re shifting the storytelling and trying to make sure that different things are happening, so when we do huge moments of graphic violence, as we do frequently, we need to have in mind how to maintain that sense of momentum through the show. If someone is watching this show in Season 5 and goes, ‘They’re not reaching the heights of Season 3,’ we’ve failed. We’re always trying to have something new to spring on the viewer to shock and excite them and keep them engaged. In Season 1, the violence that Mark Grayson experiences is at the hands of his father, so you want to show that. In Season 2, it looks at the violence that Mark is capable of. The fact that Angstrom Levy is receiving it isn’t as important as the emotions that Mark is feeling having done it.”\n\nSuperpowers do not reflect personality traits. “We’re trying to make these characters feel real and three dimensional; they have hopes, dreams and aspirations,” Kirkman explains. “The superpowers serve the story and keep things moving. If you’re really paying attention, you’ll notice that a lot of characters have a similar powerset. Every now and then you have an Atom Even, Rex Splode, Duplicate or Robot who have a unique powerset. But Bulletproof, Invincible, Immortal and Omni-Man, these guys have the same powers! What differentiates them is their personalities, and that’s what makes them interesting.” A particular character has benefited from the animated series. “Debbie Grayson [Mark’s mother and wife of Omni-Man] was a major part of the comics and had a lot of big storylines, but there were long periods where the storylines were dealing with superpower, not human level stuff, so she would recede into the background. There is a tremendous opportunity in the show to find ways to keep her present. Then you also know that Sandra Oh is there to embody whatever we do. If we try to put some emotion into something, she takes that nugget and expands it. It’s a good example of an actor’s performance taking over and guiding the character at the writing stage.”\n\nInvincible delves into the multiverse, which runs the danger of being the answer for every narrative problem, thereby negating any sense of peril. “The sweet spot of multiverse storytelling is witnessing other aspects of what could have been or seeing what happened in other dimensions and wringing as much emotion out of it as possible,” Kirkman notes. “We’re also doing our best to keep it as simple as possible. There is one character who accesses the multiverse in Angstrom Levy, and everything that we experience with the multiverse is through that character.” A riddle to solve was the portal sequence in Episode 208. “That whole episode was difficult, if you think about every single trip into the multiverse as almost a completely different show. They’re going to completely different environments, characters, color palettes, and it’s a lot to ask of a team. I don’t remember the actual number of dimensions, but that was monumental. It is great to have a team that is willing to push things and take those risks and put the extra work into accomplishing those kinds of things. For most shows it would be like, ‘You only get six of those.’ Often times, there are no corners to cut and we have to knuckle down and do it.”\n\nIn The Fall Guy, Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) – a stunt double for action star Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) – suffers a horrific accident in a 12-story stunt fall in a building atrium. While recovering, Colt withdraws from both the film business and camera operator Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt), with whom he had been having an on-the-set romance. Eighteen months later, Colt re-emerges when Tom’s producer Gail Meyer (Hannah Waddington) invites him to do stunt work on Metalstorm, an epic sci-fi movie directed by Jody, whose career is taking off, and starring Tom. However, when Colt arrives at the shoot, he learns that Tom has gone missing. Gail tasks Colt with finding him – or the studio will pull the plug on Metalstorm and, with it, Jody’s ambitions. Meanwhile, Colt is doing all that he can to win back an aggrieved Jody.\n\n“To work on a movie inspired by a cult classic like The Fall Guy was a great experience,” says Cinesite VFX Supervisor Jennifer Meire. “The original series was known for its practical stunts and effects, so there was a delicate balance to strike between honoring the nostalgic elements and incorporating the more modern visual effects.” She adds, “Director David Leitch’s background as a stunt performer and action designer brought a valuable perspective to the creative process, which led to some seriously mind-blowing action sequences. He and Matt Sloan had a clear vision for how the visual effects could enhance the storytelling and action sequences, and their expectations were focused on achieving a seamless integration of practical and digital effects to create great shots.”\n\nFor his work on The Fall Guy, Chris O’Hara received the first ever Stunt Designer credit from the Screen Actors Guild and Directors Guild of America. The recognition is “well overdue,” according to Sloan. “If you think VFX has it bad when it comes to under-recognition, it’s nothing compared to the stunt department. These guys work hard. Like really hard. The planning and prep that went into the stunts on The Fall Guy were insane. It’s a long and meticulous process, and it should be – that shit is really dangerous. On top of that, the daily discipline required to maintain the levels of fitness and agility for each stunt performer’s skill set is incredible.”\n\nSloan continues, “Of course the math part isn’t sexy, so you’ll never really see that stuff in any of the behind-the-scenes footage. You just see a guy flying through the air, and you think, ‘That looks cool.’ But in the end, the designer takes responsibility for a series of decisions and calculations that, if incorrect, could result in a member of their team – and usually a friend – being seriously injured or worse. Designing stunts is a high-stress, serious job and deserves any and all recognition that comes its way.”\n\nThe Fall Guy had several death-defying stunts. The 225-foot truck jump “was practical,” Sloan says. “Logan Holladay jumped that car across the canyon on set. Utterly terrifying to watch. Naturally, there were a ton of cameras on that shot. For The Fall Guy movie [not Metalstorm] we cleaned a bunch of cameras out along with some crew vehicles and some distracting power lines in the BG. The Jody double got such a shock when the car suddenly roared over her that she did not pan her prop camera, so we fixed that as well. It was a perfect example of VFX being used to support a 100% real stunt.”\n\nThe high back-fall was “again, real,” Sloan explains. “Troy Brown back-flipped from a helicopter and fell 150 feet into an airbag. Watching that happen in front of you is incredibly unnerving – I did not realize I was holding my breath until the thumbs up came from the bag. Pure spectacle. VFX-wise, for safety reasons, we used a static helicopter buck as the platform for him to jump off. We replaced the helicopter buck so it could still be spinning in continuity with the rest of the sequence and added smoke from the gunshot damage. We did not touch the stunt itself!”\n\n“Each sequence is a series of different shots, each with its own VFX or stunt considerations,” Sloan remarks. “At the beginning of production, I told Chris [O’Hara] that I did not care how many wires/support equipment we needed to paint out as long as it was safe. He was great at minimizing the work we needed to do, but there were instances where we had a huge amount of rigging to remove, especially if it was Ryan and not one of the doubles. We opted for bluescreen for a lot of the interior car work; to shoot that practically would be too costly in terms of time. Time is the most expensive asset you have when you are shooting. David is super aware of this, and shooting that material on stage was just economically sensible. The work is perfectly serviceable to the story, and we could utilize that time-saving for larger, more complex shots/sequences.” There was other bluescreen work on and off throughout the movie. Sloan notes, “Our grip team had a bunch of ‘fly-in’ screens that we could run onto the set if something came up that required them. In saying that, this movie used less bluescreen than any other I’ve been involved in. [Yet it] also used more roto than any I’ve been involved in!”\n\nThe use of visual effects was extensive for the movie within the movie. “The Metalstorm shots were the antithesis of The Fall Guy,” Sloan explains. “Massive, overwhelming VFX silliness. We threw everything in there. Fighting aliens, explosions, spacecraft, and we even blew up the moon – why not! A lot of the Metalstorm shots were shot deliberately as Metalstorm shots, but some were not. We had a VFX team getting data with cams and ref on pretty much every shot on the film because we really did not know on a shot-to-shot basis where we would have to step in. When it came to post-production and we started fleshing out the shots, it just kept going bigger and bigger.” He continues, “I always loved the telling silence from Nicolas Chevallier, our [VFX] Supe at Framestore, on our calls each time we would increase the scope in these shots. ‘More explosions!,’ ‘More aliens!,’ ‘More lasers!’ and, of course, ‘The moon should explode on frame 67.’ They took it in stride and produced some very fun and technically spectacular shots.”\n\nFor Sloan, the Bin Truck chase was the most challenging sequence involving VFX. “It was an incredibly complex, fast-moving sequence that made us utilize pretty much every trick we had,” he says. “We had multiple driving rigs, vehicles, doubles, locations and, of course, massive stunts. Face replacements, CG vehicles, background changes, adding sparks, huge rig removals. Added to that, we were shooting multiple cameras, so you never knew which angle was going to land in the cut. Some were great, and some were absolute monsters of roto and prep. There was a huge amount of work in that sequence, and the Framestore team did an amazing job.”\n\nAnother sequence in a nightclub involved the creation of far more visible visual effects. “Colt’s drink has been spiked, and he is attacked by some bad guys. A magical look was added to the subsequent fight, inspired by anime, with sparkles, lens flares and color effects to show the effect of the psychedelic substances Colt has unknowingly consumed. These effects were created by shifting the RGB channels blended with time warps. The visuals were made to be as fluid and organic as possible, with the addition of chromatic aberration, lens flares and the kind of optical effects we often add in typical visual effects,” Meire comments.\n\nMeire observes, “If it had been possible for the film to have been completed entirely using SFX rather than digital, I think that would have been David Leitch’s preference. But there were many instances where SFX could take you most of the way there, but they needed help with the final 10%-20%. There were also instances where safety was a factor; for example the shot where we added flames to Ryan Gosling. They could not have achieved that shot seamlessly with the actual actor, close up, any other way. Wherever possible, SFX were used, but digital effects are [now] an essential part of every film, action or otherwise.”\n\nSloan points out the hard work that so often goes into invisible effects. “There is one shot I’d like to call out for special mention. It was, on paper, a super simple VFX shot – a stitch between two plates. Due to circumstances beyond our control, we could not get the camera on the B-side to match the angle of the A-side. Not even close. To the point, we added a cut initially because we had almost zero confidence that we could make it work. It had huge parallax issues, and the lighting was noticeably different. It took months of brute force, meticulous roto, warping, relighting and CG replacements of parts of the set and props, but it worked. It’s the definition of invisible VFX. But if you’re reading this and worked on that shot, know that the work was appreciated. VFX is a form of magic. Expensive magic, sure, but still magic.”\n\nWhen it comes to world-building, no canvas is broader or more complex than sci-fi. “The largest VFX challenge on Season 2 of Foundation was executing all of the different types of visual effects required on the show while maintaining the quality we had established on Season 1,” states Visual Effects Supervisor Chris MacLean. “The variety of visual effects was daunting given we had to complete complex CG environments, CG creatures, giant CG mechas, CG destruction, water simulation, CG vehicles, and holograms, just to name a few. If we are talking about a challenging sequence, I would have to say that the escape from Synnax in Episode 202 was one of the most difficult. There were a lot of practical sets and stunt work that had to seamlessly integrate with CG water simulation and stunt work. Beki, our domesticated Bishop’s Claw, was a huge win for us. Knowing how difficult it is to make a ridable CG animal feel grounded in reality, the team planned and executed this flawlessly.”\n\nJason Zimmerman, VFX Supervisor on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds for Paramount+, embraces the opportunity to add to the Star Trek legacy. “A big challenge with any Star Trek show is always working with canon on some of the fans’ most beloved characters, ships and effects,” he says. “In the case of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 2, we saw more of the Gorn than had been seen in many years. In addition to the stellar work from Legacy Effects in creating the practical Gorn, we worked to augment it with additional facial animation, drool, breath, etc. We also did entirely CG shots of the Gorn or CG Gorn with practical actor interaction to help tell the story in the final episode of the season. It was crucial to our showrunners that we seamlessly integrate the CG moments with the practical to aid in the storytelling.”\n\nZimmerman points to the Gorn fight and the conclusion of the last episode of the season as peak experiences. “In addition to the full-CG Gorn, facial performance enhancements and fight sequence, we had the scene take place on a backdrop of a partially destroyed ship hull destined to crash. Combining the practical and CG fight action and set extensions inside, with the exterior full CG beats as the ship begins to enter the nearby planet’s atmosphere, was both challenging and fun to play with as a team and with our vendors. The full CG exterior shots and destroyed ship assets were massive, requiring quite a bit of simulation in the debris field, re-entry fire and smoke, etc. Cut together with the interior fight scene with CG Gorn, along with the eventual escape of our heroes to the exterior in what became a full-CG shot with digi doubles, was quite challenging but ended up as one of our favorite shots during our tenure on the show.”\n\nOrchestrating the wide variety and different types of VFX work necessary to bring the story to life was a daunting task for Jay Worth, Visual Effects Supervisor on Fallout for Amazon Prime Video show. “I have worked on shows in the past where they were primarily a set extension show or genre or world-building,” Worth says. “However, in this one we had everything. We needed to help create the overall look and feel of the world we were inhabiting. We needed to develop multiple real-time environments for use in Unreal for shooting on a volume. We had multiple creatures with various skins and textures. We had human characters that needed photorealistic replacements to portions of their face. We had characters we were de-aging using new and cutting-edge methods. And unique hard-surface vehicles that needed to match 1:1 to practical production vehicles – as well as a lead character that needed to have a CG nose replacement throughout the entire series.”\n\nWorth and his team “fell in love” with the Cyclops. “I remember [Executive Producer] Graham [Wagner] calling me to say they wanted to do a cyclops,” Worth recalls. “When we started to talk about it, I realized how crucial this character was and how nuanced his performance would be. So, we tested a few methodologies – a pure compositing approach and an AI-generated approach. However, both of those had limitations in terms of the variety of environments we were shooting in along with performance flexibility we knew we would need. Chris Parnell’s performance was the primary thing we knew we needed to nail if we were going to pull this off, so we partnered with our long-time collaborators at Important Looking Pirates in Sweden and were ecstatic with the results. We were able to capture Chris’s performance, the humor, heart and nuance, while creating a full CG effect. I feel like we were able to push past the uncanny valley.”\n\nVisual Effects Supervisor Douglas Purver adhered to an extraordinary level of detail for Season 2 of HBO’s The Gilded Age. “With a show this opulent in its set design, costumes and more, there’s been a fine line to walk with the effects work. We don’t ever want to call attention to ourselves while maintaining the level of detail that seamlessly blends in with what’s captured on camera. Most of the time we can use elements from what’s practically there. I’m constantly taking stills of textures and architectural details, or we bring in a team to get high-resolution scans. But often we are creating things from scratch and finding a real-world reference is challenging, involving a deep dive into historical texts and postcards or a significant collaboration with our production designer and locations department to find elements that can fit into our world.”\n\nThe season’s climax found Purver and his team at the opening of the Metropolitan Opera House, “which was filmed in three different locations, weeks apart from one another, at a stage in Albany, New York, the main Opera House in Philadelphia and a set of five opera boxes built on our film stages,” Purver details. “Getting them all to sit together, especially when the camera wraps around Bertha as she enters her box for the first time, was extremely satisfying. Building the CG crowd to blend with our tiled plates filled the entire venue and gave it the grand opening it deserved. Being able to collaborate with the production designer on how much to build and where, with the cinematographer on light placements – how and when to move the camera – the director on which story pieces to shoot where, along with the amazing VFX team who contributed countless hours to allow the viewer to stay in the moment and marvel at this climactic, cinematic moment in our story – was just a fantastic experience.”\n\nTim Crosbie, Visual Effects Supervisor on Season 3 of The Witcher for Netflix, called out Episode 6 where “almost every shot required some form of VFX, from the spells cast during the battle to the many set extensions throughout all of the exterior fights, then the destruction of Tor Lara and Aretuza towards the end. Our on-set teams had their work cut out. We knew we needed to provide very accurate lighting and LiDAR data to ensure that post-production ran as smoothly as possible because the schedule was going to be tight to get all the shots through. All of our vendors came to the party and produced really beautiful work to help tell the story. This show was one of the more collaborative ones I’ve worked on, with everyone pulling in the same direction. I think the most satisfying accomplishment for us in VFX was how much value we were able to bring to the story.”\n\nCharlie Lehmer, Visual Effects Supervisor on All the Light We Cannot See for Netflix, cited the “rampart run sequence” in Episode 4 as the most challenging. “Early on in pre-production, director Shawn Levy emphasized the need for its immense scale, leading us to explore numerous shooting solutions. However, as ambition grew, on-location filming became unfeasible. Constructing a fully-CG, period-accurate St. Malo [an historic port city in France] environment demanded rigorous research and planning. The core difficulty lay in marrying historical fidelity with our artistic narrative vision.” Lehmer says. “We dedicated a week to thoroughly scanning and photographing St. Malo. Archival footage, both pre-and post-bombing, was further analyzed to ensure as much accuracy as possible. ILM did an amazing job digitally transforming the modern town into its 1944 counterpart. The result was a full CG city of St. Malo, procedurally built to allow for extensive bombing and collapse of various buildings.”\n\nJohn Haley, Visual Effects Supervisor on Marvel Studios’ Echo for Disney+, was heavily focused on the main action sequences in Episode 2. “Bushto and the train heist presented challenges due to their scope and complexity. Recreating the Choctaw Bushto environment for the stickball sequence, which takes place in the year 1200 AD in what is now Alabama, required careful research. The production and VFX teams worked with historians and cultural consultants to ensure that the sensitive historical details were correct. All the shots in the sequence were augmented with visual effects to make the game and scene as realistic as possible. The team at ILM thoughtfully created the environment and CG background characters to portray life in 1200 AD before the arrival of Europeans.”\n\nContinues Haley, “[For the train heist], combining live-action acting, stunt performances, digital doubles, face replacements, practical train cars, CG train cars and effects in photographed and digital environments seamlessly into the action-packed ‘Train Heist’ sequence was no easy feat. When Maya Lopez plunges off the highway overpass onto the speeding train below, the VFX team used all of those resources to achieve the shot – transitioning from the plate photography of Alaqua Cox to stunt photography on blue screen to a full Maya digital double, back to Alaqua on a bluescreen, all in a photorealistic all-CG environment. Whew! We wanted the train heist sequence to feel grounded and gritty, choosing camera positions as if we were shooting the scene on a fast-moving train or from a pursuit vehicle. Day-for-night train array plates were shot and color-graded, then used as a basis for the environment. Then, the nighttime environments were modeled and designed to give a sense of speed, danger and depth. Each shot was balanced and composited so it appeared as though it was photographed using only available moonlight and artificial practical light sources.”\n\nThe audience’s emotional reaction, particularly from fans of the book, to a couple of moments in Episode 8, the season finale, stood out to Andy Scrase, Visual Effects Supervisor on Season 2 of The Wheel of Time for Amazon Prime Video. “One was the death of Hopper. The performance of our Czech Wolfdog, Ka Lupinka, was fantastic! We supplemented that performance with an animated color flash to the eyes and added a pool of blood from Hopper’s fatal neck wound forming around the head. I think that little addition emotionally pushed everyone over the edge! It was straight-forward VFX work, but it gave such a payoff because it complemented the performance and initiated sadness and horror among those watching.”\n\nNot long after Hopper’s death in the episode is Mat Cauthon blowing the Horn of Valere. “Again,” Scrase notes, “this seemed to get a big reaction with the book fans, but at the other end [of ] the emotional scale. Seeing the ‘Heroes of the Horn’ form and emerge from a localized mystical fog brought a certain degree of euphoria. The fog moment features in the second book [The Great Hunt], and so it felt important to keep that component. We then used influences from the Hindi festival of Holi, fireworks exploding in thick smoke, and some beautiful photography I found of dancers holding poses in clouds of powdered paint to inspire the heroes appearing in our CG fog. The low of Hopper’s death almost immediately followed by the excitement of Mat blowing the Horn heightened the emotional reaction from those in the audience. For me, it showed how our work in the industry is not just about flashy effects or seamless additions; it can emotionally contribute to a scene and an audience’s reaction.”\n\nChristopher Townsend, VFX Supervisor on Season 2 of Marvel Studios’ Loki for Disney+, had many loose “threads and strands” to tie up for the finale of the limited series. “Creating some of the CG environments so they still fit in with the lo-fi, analog visual style of the whole show was challenging, particularly when outside the TVA, with swirling prismatic flares, a disintegrating spaceman-like suit and a massive floating loom weaving threads of time. The unique and original spaghettification and time-slipping effects were designed to fit within the visual motif of time represented as lines, threads and strands. The final tree-like Yggdrasil galactic image, showing the transformed timelines with Loki at its heart, felt like a beautiful and epic moment to end the show.”\n\nFor Jay Redd, VFX Supervisor on Season 4 For All Mankind for Apple TV+, the biggest challenge was the sheer variety of VFX work for Season 4 – and for every season of the show, “and keeping our feet firmly planted in real physics and science while bending the rules here and there to serve the storytelling,” he says. “While we are an alternate timeline show, our approach is hard science. We put a major effort into making sure things feel real in space, on Mars and on Earth. A lot of this work comes early in the previs stages, me working with The Third Floor in designing shots and sequences, working on physics, pacing, and scale. We work hand-in-hand with our astronaut and technical consultants to keep things as realistic and scientifically accurate as we can, knowing there are times when drama and story call for changing the pace and timings of certain events, like ships docking, landings, etc.”\n\nRedd continues, “This year, we had two big challenges: the huge expansion of the Happy Valley Mars Base and the Asteroid Captures. Happy Valley was a 50-fold expansion from Season 3, so there was a massive amount of work in designing and creating the dozens of new modules, landing pads, roads, terra-forming, vehicles, and connecting infrastructure to show the huge growth over roughly a decade. We worked very closely with production design to make sure we integrated our look from Season 3 while also showing the epic scale of growth in Season 4. The DNEG Montreal team, led by VFX Supervisor Mo Sobhy, did an amazing job in hitting a massive amount of detail across the base and multiple landscapes under varying lighting and atmospheric conditions.”\n\nThe Asteroid captures in the beginning and the end posed major challenges for Redd and his team. “Once again, we needed to make things as plausible and scientifically accurate as we could while serving a dramatic and emotional story,” he states. “Working with very limited set pieces on small stages, we had dozens of shots that are fully CG, partial live-action and hybrid/mid-shot blends – utilizing extensions, digi-doubles, face replacements and big simulations for asteroid pebbles, rock and dust. The designs of the asteroids are based on real existing asteroids, and capture ships and mechanisms come from real-world examples and future-looking potential endeavors. We had conceptual challenges in showing ships firing engines but appearing to be moving backwards, and slowing asteroids to enter Mars orbit. The Ghost VFX team in Copenhagen, Denmark, led by VFX Supervisor Martin Gårdeler did an incredible job in working with me on a ton of scope and detail in the models and simulations, and very specific lighting cues to show the scale "
