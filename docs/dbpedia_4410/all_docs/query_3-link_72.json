        "text": "Laurence Fishburne (born July 30, 1961, Augusta, Georgia, U.S.) is an American actor noted for the intensity of his performances. He was the recipient of a Tony Award (1992) for his work in August Wilson’s play Two Trains Running but is probably best known for his role as Morpheus in the Matrix film trilogy.\n\nFishburne began acting as a child, making his film debut in Cornbread, Earl and Me (1975) at age 14. He then lied about his age to win the part of Clean, a gunner on a swift boat in Francis Ford Coppola’s Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now (1979). The experience of filming in the Philippines with a veteran moviemaking cast and crew had a profound impact on Fishburne, who became committed to succeeding in Hollywood. Initially he found only roles as hoodlums, and he was happy to take the part of the lighthearted Cowboy Curtis on the children’s television show Pee-Wee’s Playhouse. He worked again with Coppola in Rumble Fish (1983) and The Cotton Club (1984) and with directors Steven Spielberg in The Color Purple (1985) and Spike Lee in School Daze (1988).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nIn the 1990s Fishburne hit his stride, turning in noteworthy performances in King of New York (1990), Boyz ’n the Hood (1991), Deep Cover (1992), and Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993). His portrayal of musician Ike Turner in What’s Love Got to Do with It (1993) earned him an Academy Award nomination for best actor. In 1995 he became the first African American to play Shakespeare’s Othello in a major film. In The Matrix (1999), Fishburne appeared as a guru who reveals an alternate universe to a young hacker (Keanu Reeves). The successful film paved the way for two sequels, The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and The Matrix Revolutions (2003).\n\nIn 2006 Fishburne played a professor who coaches a girl from south Los Angeles to compete in a national spelling bee in Akeelah and the Bee. Later that year he appeared as a hotel chef in Bobby, a film about the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. In 2009 he starred in the action thriller Armored, and two years later he portrayed a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention executive in the epidemiological thriller Contagion. In the Superman movie Man of Steel (2013), he played Clark Kent’s newspaper-editor boss. He reprised the role in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Fishburne’s other films from 2016 included Passengers, a sci-fi romance about hibernating space travelers heading to another planet.\n\nThe following year he was cast as a crime lord in the action thriller John Wick: Chapter 2; he reprised the role in the 2019 sequel. He played a Vietnam War veteran helping his old war buddy bury his son, a marine killed in the Iraq War, in Last Flag Flying (2017). Fishburne returned to superhero movies in 2018 with Ant-Man and the Wasp. His later big-screen credits included Richard Linklater’s Where’d You Go, Bernadette (2019), the action-thriller The Ice Road (2021), and the espionage drama All the Old Knives (2022).\n\nIn addition to his film roles, Fishburne’s work onstage and on television brought him acclaim. Following his performance in Two Trains Running, he portrayed King Henry II in a 1999 Broadway production of The Lion in Winter, and in 2006 he appeared in August Wilson’s Fences in Pasadena, California. He then starred as Thurgood Marshall in Thurgood, a one-man show staged on Broadway (2008) and later aired as an HBO movie (2011). Fishburne’s other small-screen credits included a guest role on the series Tribeca, for which he received (1993) his first Emmy Award. He also appeared in the TV films The Tuskegee Airmen (1995) and Miss Evers’ Boys (1997); for the latter movie, a fictionalized portrayal of the Tuskegee syphilis study, Fishburne, who served as executive producer, received an Emmy when it was named best made-for-television movie."
