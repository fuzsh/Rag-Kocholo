        "text": "The first attempt to adapt Awdry's stories for television came in 1953, when the editor of the Railway Series books, Eric Marriott, was approached by the BBC, who wished to use live-action model trains to re-create two stories from Awdry's first book, The Three Railway Engines. 00 gauge Hornby Dublo models appeared on sets that reflected the style of the original illustrations. The first episode (based on \"The Sad Story of Henry\") was broadcast live on the evening of Sunday 14 June 1953 from Lime Grove Studios.[9] The live broadcast did not fare well: a failure to switch the points caused the model of Henry to derail and it had to be replaced on the rails by one of the operators. The models moved jerkily, and all effects and music had to be superimposed.[10]\n\nNews of the broadcast hit the front pages of The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail. Awdry branded the episode \"unprofessional\", and the point-switching debacle an \"elementary mistake\". As a result, the second episode scheduled for 28 June 1953 was put on hold, and then later cancelled.[9][11] The BBC offered Awdry and the Railway Series publishers greater creative control over the production, but the publishers declined, preferring to focus on publishing new books for the series.[10]"
