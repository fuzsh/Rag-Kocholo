        "text": "Main Street (1920)\n\nWith this novel, Lewis added the words “Main Street” to Americans’ vocabulary to represent the closed culture and arrogant contentedness of small towns. In Main Street, Lewis portrays Gopher Prairie, Minnesota, as a typical small town in the American Middle West, “Its Main Street is the continuation of Main Streets everywhere.” His keen observations and attention to detail convinced many Americans that he was writing about their towns. However, this town does not conform to the friendly, close-knit stereotype. Readers see Gopher Prairie through the eyes of Carol Kennicott, the wife of the town doctor who has moved there from St. Paul after their marriage. She wants to bring social reform, as well as art and literature to the small community, but is rejected by the townspeople who are satisfied with their lives and disapprove of any quick changes. In this novel, Lewis criticizes Americans content with provincial lives. See Main Street: The Revolt of Carol Kennicott, by Martin Bucco (1993) and The Rise of Sinclair Lewis 1920-1930 by James Hutchisson (1997) for more information.\n\nBabbitt (1922)\n\nGeorge F. Babbitt is the eponymous hero of Sinclair Lewis’s Babbitt, a novel which was published in 1922 by Harcourt Brace. Babbitt is a real estate salesman who seems to be very much a product of his time and culture, interested in material possessions and practical education for his children. Much of the first half of the novel is primarily satire against various aspects of society: the church, men’s clubs, high school and college education, business, etc. However, in the second half of the novel, Babbitt begins to realize the sterility of his life and experiments with radical politics, engages in an affair, and attempts to find solace in male bonding in the Maine woods. All of this fails, and at the end of the novel Babbitt is back with his family, hoping that his son will have a life different from the one he has had (although it doesn’t look like it). “Babbitt” is often used to define someone who is a middle-class social conformist, although this is based primarily on the first half of the novel. Books focusing on Babbitt include Babbitt: An American Life, by Glen Love (1993) and The Rise of Sinclair Lewis 1920-1930 by James Hutchisson (1997).\n\nArrowsmith (1925)\n\nMartin Arrowsmith is the protagonist of this novel, a doctor who is torn between helping others and doing serious research. He moves from being a small-town doctor to a public health inspector to a researcher at a famous New York City clinic. However, after a disturbing episode while fighting the plague in the Caribbean, and the death of his beloved wife Leora, he decides to leave behind civilization and set up a research outpost in the northern woods. Arrowsmith was made into a movie in the 1930s with Ronald Colman as Martin and Helen Hayes as Leora. The novel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1926, but Lewis refused it. There have been two collections of essays focusing on Arrowsmith, Twentieth Century Interpretations of Arrowsmith: A Collection of Critical Essays, ed. Robert J. Griffin (Prentice-Hall, 1968) and Sinclair Lewis’s “Arrowsmith,” ed. Harold Bloom (Chelsea House, 1988).\n\nElmer Gantry (1927)\n\nElmer Gantry deals with the excesses of religion in American society. In creating Elmer Gantry, Lewis researched a variety of religions, spoke in the pulpits of churches, and attended Sunday School classes. In 1926, he stood in the pulpit of Burris Jenkins in Linwood Boulevard Christian (Campbellite) Church and dared God to strike him dead within fifteen minutes in order to prove His existence. This action created quite a stir and contributed to the novel becoming a bestseller. Elmer Gantry is a good natured, lecherous, and not very bright seminary student who is able to succeed in the ministry because of his wonderful speaking voice. Although almost all of his sermons seem to be variations on “love is the morning and the evening star” (a phrase he “borrows” from the noted atheist Robert Ingersoll), he is able to be successful because he tells people what they want to hear, even though he does not believe it himself. He starts out as a Baptist minister but is forced to leave after an affair with Lulu Baines, the deacon’s daughter, is exposed. He later becomes an evangelist with Sister Sharon Falconer, an Aimee Semple McPherson type of preacher. When that affair ends in fire and calamity, he becomes a Methodist preacher with a self-conferred doctorate. The novel ends as he prays for the United States to be a “moral nation” and simultaneously admires the legs of a new choir singer. This juxtaposition of the sacred and the profane is a hallmark of this novel. Elmer Gantry was made into a movie in 1960 with Burt Lancaster as Elmer Gantry, Jean Simmons as Sharon Falconer, and Shirley Jones as Lulu Baines. Both Lancaster and Jones won Academy Awards for their roles, and Richard Brooks won for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nDodsworth (1929)\n\nIn Dodsworth, the relationship between Americans and Europeans is foregrounded by the relationship between husbands and wives. Sam Dodsworth is an honest, hardworking, talented businessman with middle-class common sense. He is a fifty-year-old millionaire with strong beliefs in American values. After raising two children and helping her husband build his automobile business for twenty years, Fran Dodsworth insists that he retire so that they can go on a European tour, which Fran believes will make them more sophisticated. However, the tour results in their marriage’s destruction. Fran’s enthusiasm for the new and different is not portrayed positively; instead, Lewis applauds Sam’s American values. Ironically, Fran’s desire for status leads her to flirt with minor nobility and seek a divorce from Sam. When the nobleman’s mother rejects her as a wife for her son because she’s past child-bearing age, a dejected Fran seeks out Sam, who has learned to enjoy the slower rhythms of Europe and the charms of a glamorous divorcee, Edith Cortright. Sam and Edith also appear as characters in Lewis’s last novel World So Wide. They have become part of the community of expatriates living in Italy, belonging neither to the land in which they live nor the land in which they were born. Dodsworth was adapted into a play by Sidney Howard and later into a movie. Walter Huston played Sam Dodsworth in both versions. More recently it has been adapted into a musical.\n\nIt Can’t Happen Here (1935)\n\nResponding to fascist events in Europe, including Hitler’s aggressive actions and Franco’s murderous acts in Spain, Lewis warned Americans about the state of their own democracy in It Can’t Happen Here. He identifies the fascism that had been growing in the United States since World War I. In the novel, he portrays a slow and believable change in American culture and government; almost without realizing it, the United States becomes a totalitarian government. Lewis plays on American rituals, history, and commonplaces as he focuses on the electoral process and its corruptions. Doremus Jessup, a sixty-year-old newspaper editor is the focus of the novel. He stands in for those vaguely liberal, well-meaning people who believe that one doesn’t need to be too involved in the world. It is only after Berzelius Windrip becomes president, creates national concentration camps, and does away with democratic government, that Doremus becomes politically active. And by then it’s too late. Doremus’s son-in-law is killed by the government, one daughter sacrifices herself to assassinate a political leader, and the other is nearly raped by a fascist bully. Doremus is put in a concentration camp, tortured, and eventually joins the political underground, working for an American government in exile. The warning is plain. Unless citizens stay educated and involved, fascism can indeed happen here. Lewis was co-author of a play version of It Can’t Happen Here for the Federal Theater Project which had over 20 companies performing the play simultaneously. MGM planned to film the novel, but bowed to political pressure and aborted the filming. Lewis went on to play Doremus in summer stock in the late 1930s.\n\nKingsblood Royal (1947)\n\nNeil Kingsblood, a wounded veteran of World War II, returns to his hometown of Grand Republic, Minnesota, to resume his life as a banker and husband to wife Vestal and daughter Biddy. While doing some genealogical research at the suggestion of father, he discovers that his great-great-great grandfather was black. This knowledge, who he tells it to, and how he needs to rethink his identity, form the drama of the novel. Although he lives in the supposedly more enlightened North, his friends ostracize him, he loses his job, and his wife contemplates the abortion of their second child. He does come to see that the received knowledge about race is not only wrong but very destructive. As the novel ends, he, his family, and some friends of both races gather at his house which is being attacked by white society.\n\nVisit our page of scholarly works to see a more detailed listing of criticism on the works of Sinclair Lewis.\n\n1920s\n\nThe 1920s, also known as the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties, was a lively time in U.S. history when young, modernist ideas collided with old, traditionalist values. The end of World War I marked a turning point in American society. The horror of war, along with the use of forms of mass destruction including planes, tanks, and poison gas, created a somber mood that the average person tried to forget through jazz and booze. In this decade, the workweek was reduced from sixty to forty-eight hours and families began vacationing in the summer.\n\nWhile the 1920s monetarily separated the lower and upper class, people were brought together to drink during Prohibition. As part of the Volstead Act, the 18th Amendment eliminated the licenses of brewers, distillers, and wholesale and retail sellers of alcohol. Prohibition helped inspire many of the characteristic images of the 1920s. Men and women piled into speakeasies, and breaking the law became the rule, not the exception. This was the time of Eliot Ness, Al Capone, and the Chicago mobsters. A culture emerged from these speakeasies that included flapper style and dancing to the Charleston.\n\nDuring this decade, President Warren G. Harding brought the word “scandal” to the White House. There were a number of famous trials including the Scopes Trial, otherwise known as the “Monkey Trial,” where William Jennings Bryan took a trip to the stand to fight the teaching of evolution. In the Sacco and Vanzetti trial, two supposed robbers and murderers were tried, convicted, and executed. However, much evidence remains that the men were killed for their anti-capitalist political views. In the Leopold and Loeb trial, two law students were convicted of killing fourteen-year-old Bobby Franks for the thrill. The decade began with the Red Scare and the Palmer Raids and ended with the beginning of the Great Depression.\n\nAfter Harding’s death, President Calvin Coolidge declared that America’s business was business, and ordinary people’s trading on the stock market increased dramatically. Easy credit led to increased consumerism. Advertisements abounded, encouraging consumers to buy luxury items, like cars and radios. In 1930, not many people owned a radio, but by the end of the decade, one could be found in almost every household. During this time, Henry Ford revolutionized industry by speeding up production. He was also one of the first employers to view his workers as customers.\n\nThe 1920s were also a decade of reform. On August 26, 1920, the 19th amendment granted women the right to vote. This period included a push for other women’s rights, including contraceptives and birth control clinics. Reform movements focused on improved wages, hours and conditions, and opened the doors wider for women’s education. There were more women in the workforce than ever before. Like men, it became more common for women to smoke and drink. In fashion, women’s hemlines jumped from their ankles to their knees, and their dresses and swimsuits were much skimpier. Bobbed hair also became popular.\n\nFamous names of the 1920s:\n\nTheater: John Barrymore, Irving Berlin, Isadora Duncan, Oscar Hammerstein, Jerome Kern, Eugene O’Neill, Anna Pavlova, Will Rogers, and Florenz Ziegfeld\n\nArchitecture: Frank Lloyd Wright\n\nVisual Arts: Ansel Adams, Salvador Dali, Henri Matisse, Joan Miro, Georgia O’Keeffe, and Pablo Picasso\n\nJazz: Louis Armstrong, Bix Beiderbecke, Duke Ellington, George Gershwin, and Bessie Smith.\n\nPhilosphers: Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and Jean Piaget\n\nScience: Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein\n\nFilm: Charles Chaplin, Cecil B.

Major causes of the crash were stock market speculation and the unequal distribution of wealth in the 1920s. The decade of the 1930s was also the time of the Great Depression. The Depression did not affect only one class, though. From 1930 to 1933, unemployment quintupled, and fifteen million people were out of work. Children left school to help support their families, although not much work was available. This period saw the rise of labor unions including the Knights of Labor and the conservative and strong American Federation of Labor.\n\nIn 1932 Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected by a popular majority of seven million votes, and his New Deal presided over the rest of the decade. He implemented the Civil Works Administration (CWA) and the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and provided work and services for the American people. Part of the CWA, the Public Works of Art Project was an experimental program in federal work relief, providing the unemployed with public service jobs during the bitter winter of 1933-34. For example, it hired artists to paint murals on public buildings. Both programs funded government projects to aid public welfare and to employ Americans.\n\nOn August 14, 1934, President Roosevelt signed the social security bill, surrounded by reporters and cameramen. It provided a social safety net for older Americans. He used the radio to reach the American people, speaking to American families through nationally broadcast fireside chats.\n\nThe Depression called for cheap, escapist entertainment, and radio programs flourished. Comedians Fred Allen, Gracie Allen, Jack Benny, George Burns, and Bob Hope, as well as mystery programs like The Shadow and Suspense were popular. Board games also became popular, and Monopoly flew off the shelves in 1935.\n\nWilliam Randolph Hearst continued to feed the American people with print; by 1934 he published 33 newspapers that reached eleven million readers. He reported major events that occurred during the thirties, including the 1932 Lindbergh baby kidnapping, the 1934 Dustbowl in America’s Midwest, the 1937 Hindenburg crash, and Adolf Hitler’s 1938 move into Austria.

Lewis remarkably portrays ordinary life, ordinary characters, and ordinary speech. Many critics, including Heywood Broun, praised Lewis for his ability to meticulously reproduce different dialects and speech. Lewis used vivid detail to create scenes of the American middle class. His social satire was critical of American life and certain types of Americans and institutions which he felt harmed Americans and prevented the country from living up to its democratic ideals.\n\nLewis’s novels fit under the umbrella of American social fiction, fiction whose primary purpose is to represent contemporary American society, primarily in a realist style with realistic language. Lewis artfully described American culture and life of the time, helping Americans see their own lives with their many flaws. Critics praised him, claiming that his writing represented the culture of the 1920s and 1930s. Mark Schorer, in his exhaustive biography, notes regarding Lewis’s work, “American culture seems always to have had a literary spokesman, a single writer who presented American culture and American attitudes toward its culture, to the world” (270). Lewis was that author. The titles of two of his novels, Main Street and Babbitt, were introduced into the American vocabulary. These words developed their own cultural meanings.\n\nIn the wake of World War I, amidst the culture of the Jazz Age and the Great Depression, Lewis revealed to Americans their lives at a time when they were ready to listen. Lewis’s representation of the middle class and its discontent was presented through satire and social criticism. Main Street is the epitome of the “Revolt from the Village” novel and the logical conclusion to a literary trend started by such writers as Edgar Lee Masters and Sherwood Anderson. Babbitt, Arrowsmith, and Elmer Gantry serve as critiques of different aspects of American society such as consumerism and conformity, the medical profession, and organized religion. It Can’t Happen Here is a warning against the growth of fascism in our own country. Even a more minor text like The Man Who Knew Coolidge uses the distinctly American voice of the businessman, one that would be picked up by humorous writers like Robert Benchley and James Thurber.\n\nFollowing his five major novels, Lewis’s importance was secured when he became the first American to be awarded the Nobel Prize in 1930. Lewis also helped other young American authors. He was Elinor Wylie’s first literary contact, and he encouraged her during the beginning of her career. Lewis assisted Frazier Hunt, writer for the Cosmopolitan, and helped him write Sycamore Bend. He encouraged Zona Gale, helped Edith Summers publish Weeds, called Harcourt on behalf of Pola Negri and asked them to publish her memoirs, and congratulated Thomas Wolfe on his first novel, Look Homeward, Angel. Later in his life, Lewis hired Barnaby Conrad as his personal assistant and helped him to write The Innocent Villa.\n\nSome of his later novels were also bestsellers, includingCass Timberlane, a novel about the tension between husbands and wives in post war America, that was made into a film with Spencer Tracy and Lana Turner. Kingsblood Royal (1947), a novel about a man who discovers a black ancestor and endures attacks by his former friends and colleagues, exposed racism in middle class America to a white audience that had turned a blind eye to it.\n\nLewis influenced a number of authors in different ways. Authors who have written about businessmen in various guises, such as John Updike in the Rabbit series, draw on his thinking about the intersection between business and culture. Critics have also suggested that such authors as Philip Roth, J.F. Powers, T. S. Stribling, and Garrison Keillor drew on his social commentary."
