        "text": "Born in Montreal, William Hope joined the National Youth Theatre in London after high school and performed for three seasons with them. During that time he began training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). After graduation he worked almost uninterruptedly in theatre for the next seven years, in addition to over 100 radio plays for the BBC as a resident artist. In the mid 80's he was offered a major role in Stanley Kubrick's \"Full Metal Jacket\" but passed on it for a lead in James Cameron's Aliens (1986) as Lt. Gorman. The next ten years saw him regularly playing leading roles in many major regional, touring and West End companies, often living in London as a base for family, while he began working more extensively in front of the camera. The last five years, has seen him appearing in a wide mix of film and TV. His career to date includes art and indie films, mainstream international TV and numerous major Hollywood movies. This year will see him guest-starring in possibly the last series of \"Spooks\" (MI-5), performing alongside David Thewlis in Luc Besson's \"The Lady\", with Rachel Weisz in \"The WhistleBlower\" and Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's \"Dark Shadows\".\n\nA tall, wavy-haired US actor with a deep, resonant voice, Clancy Brown has proven himself a versatile performer with first-class contributions to theatre, feature films, television series and even animation.\n\nClarence J. Brown III was born in 1959 in Urbana, Ohio, to Joyce Helen (Eldridge), a concert pianist, conductor, and composer, and Clarence J. \"Bud\" Brown, Jr., who helped manage the Brown Publishing Company, the family-owned newspaper started by Clancy's grandfather, Clarence J. Brown. Clancy's father and grandfather were also Republican congressmen from the same Ohio district, and Clancy spent much of his youth in close proximity to Washington, D.C. He plied his dramatic talents in the Chicago theatre scene before moving onto feature film with a sinister debut performance bullying Sean Penn inside a youth reformatory in Bad Boys - Klein und gefährlich (1983). He portrayed Viktor the Monster in the unusual spin on the classic Frankenstein story in Die Braut (1985), before scoring one of his best roles to date as the evil Kurgan hunting fellow immortals Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery across four centuries of time in Highlander: Es kann nur einen geben (1986).\n\nBrown played a corrupt American soldier in the Walter Hill-directed hyper-violent action film Ausgelöscht (1987), another deranged killer in Mörderischer Vorsprung (1988) and a brutal prison guard, who eventually somewhat \"befriends\" wrongfully convicted banker Tim Robbins, in the moving Die Verurteilten (1994). His superb vocal talents were in demand, and he contributed voices to animated series, including Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm (1995), Street Sharks (1994), Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles (1994) and Superman (1996). Brown then landed two more plum roles, one as a \"tough-as-nails\" drill sergeant in the science fiction thriller Starship Troopers (1997), and the other alongside Robin Williams in the Disney comedy Flubber (1997).\n\nThe video gaming industry took notice of Clancy's vocal abilities, too, and he has contributed voices to several top selling video games, including Crash Bandicoot: Der Zorn des Cortex (2001), Lands of Lore III (1999), Star Wars: Bounty Hunter (2002) and Crash Nitro Kart (2003).

Krabs in the highly successful SpongeBob Schwammkopf (1999) animated series and films, and he contributed voices to The Batman (2004), Jackie Chan Adventures (2000) and Die Liga der Gerechten (2001) animated series. A popular and friendly personality, Clancy Brown continues to remain busy both through his vocal and acting talents in Hollywood.\n\nGrey Griffin was born in Fort Ord, California.
