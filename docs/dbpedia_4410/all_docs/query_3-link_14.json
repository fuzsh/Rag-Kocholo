The actor added to his voice work résumé with roles in the 1998 version of Dr. Dolittle, The Secret Life of Pets (2016), and various characters on The Simpsons over the years. He reprised his role as Marlin in Finding Dory (2016).\n\nA documentary about Brooks' life and career, titled Albert Brooks: Defending My Life, was released in 2023.\n\n02 of 15\n\nNemo (Alexander Gould)\n\nThe filmmakers found their Nemo in Alexander Gould. After voicing the lost clownfish, the former child star picked up an onscreen gig on the Showtime comedy series Weeds as Shane Botwin.\n\nGould's additional voice credits include Curious George (2006), Bambi II (2006), and HBO's The Life & Times of Tim. He left his Hollywood career behind in the early-2010s, though he had a cameo in Finding Dory, not as Nemo but as Carl, a delivery truck driver.\n\n03 of 15\n\nDory (Ellen DeGeneres)\n\nEllen DeGeneres brought her unique vocal talents to the charming and forgetful pacific regal blue tang Dory. In addition to getting her own spinoff in Finding Dory, DeGeneres' other voice credits are coincidentally similar to Brooks' — Doctor Dolittle and a 2010 episode of The Simpsons (as herself).\n\nDeGeneres previously starred in her own sitcom, Ellen, from 1994 to 1998, and began her wildly popular talk show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the same year as Finding Nemo in 2003. The show aired 3,294 episodes across 19 seasons, ending in May 2022.\n\n04 of 15\n\nGill (Willem Dafoe)\n\nWillem Dafoe lent his trademark sound to Gill, the wise Moorish idol who has seen a lot during his time in the tank.\n\nOutside of the fishy character, Dafoe has bounced between lead and supporting roles in such films as The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Clear and Present Danger (1994), The English Patient (1996), Spider-Man (2002), The Fault in Our Stars (2014), and The Lighthouse (2019), and Poor Things (2023).

She went on to lend her voice to Mr. Peabody & Sherman (2014), Minions (2015), and The Addams Family (2019), as well as episodes of Phineas and Ferb and Family Guy.\n\nJanney's résumé in film and TV is impressive, as is her awards record, winning four Emmys for The West Wing and two for the CBS sitcom Mom, as well as an Oscar, Golden Globe, and many other awards for her scene-stealing role in 2017's I, Tonya. She's since appeared in 2022's To Leslie and starred in Lou (2022), The People We Hate at the Wedding (2022), and The Creator (2023).\n\n07 of 15\n\nGurgle (Austin Pendleton)\n\nCharacter actor Austin Pendleton joined Finding Nemo as Gurgle, a nervous royal gramma fish in the tank at the dentist's office.

The actor also lent his voice to the Ice Age franchise, Kim Possible, American Dad!, and King of the Hill.\n\nLike many of his Finding Nemo costars, Root has worked diligently as a character actor for decades. Some of his most notable credits include the films Office Space (1999), No Country for Old Men (2007), and Get Out (2017) and the series Boardwalk Empire, True Blood, and Barry — for which he earned his first Emmy nomination.\n\n09 of 15\n\nDeb (Vicki Lewis)\n\nVicki Lewis found herself in the fish tank as Deb, a humbug damselfish who has a habit of mistaking her own reflection for another fish named Flo.\n\nThe Broadway actress also boasts roles in NewsRadio, Mousehunt (1997), and Godzilla (1998), as well as guest-star spots on The Blacklist and The Goldbergs.

He joined Pixar in 1990, where he now works as Vice President, Creative.\n\n13 of 15\n\nCoral (Elizabeth Perkins)\n\nElizabeth Perkins' appearance in Finding Nemo was all too brief, playing Coral, the wife of Marlin and mother of Nemo who dies at the fins of a barracuda.\n\nPerkins' largely onscreen résumé includes Big (1988), The Flintstones (1994), Miracle on 34th Street (1994), and the series Weeds, for which she earned three Emmy nominations.
