Martin T. Sherman is an American actor, and voice artist. He provided the voice of Tyler Scott in the first 22 episodes of Season 1, replacing Gabriel Bateman (who voiced him in the pilot) with his last episode being "A Fair to Remember". He was replaced by Christopher Ragland (starting in the episode "One of the Boys"), due to hitting puberty. He later returned as the voice of a minor character, a Shopkin named Groovy Glasses.

Coincidentally, Sherman's mother's first name is Chrissy.

Not counting his predecessor, Sherman is Tyler's only voice actor to not voice him in Listen Out Loud.
