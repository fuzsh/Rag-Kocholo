        "text": "Watch: Brian Cox regrets his recent comments about Johnny Depp\n\nBrian Cox has admitted he was a bit \"harsh\" on Johnny Depp and he now regrets the comments he made about his fellow actor in his new memoir.\n\nThe 75-year-old actor called Depp, 58, \"overrated and overblown\" in his autobiography and mocked his performance in Edward Scissorhands before claiming his career was dwindling.\n\nCox told Jimmy Kimmel Live: \"I just thought I was being a bit harsh. You know what it's like, you go for the easy joke. And I went for the easy joke.\n\nRead more: Brian Cox calls Johnny Depp \"overrated\" in his memoir\n\n\"That was what happened, and I sort of regretted it. Because I'm not like that normally; I was just being a bit glib, a bit flip.\"\n\nThe Succession star turned down the chance to work with Depp on the first Pirates Of The Caribbean movie, in which he stars as Captain Jack Sparrow.\n\nCox wrote in his memoir, Putting the Rabbit in the Hat: \"Personable though I'm sure he is, is so overblown, so overrated.\n\n\"I mean, Edward Scissorhands. Let's face it, if you come on with hands like that and pale, scarred-face makeup, you don't have to do anything. And he didn't.\"\n\nHe added: \"And subsequently, he's done even less.\"\n\nCox said of not being part of the Disney Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise: \"It would have been a money-spinner, but of all the parts in that film it was the most thankless, plus I would have ended up doing it for film after film and missed out on all the other nice things I've done.\"\n\nThe Scottish actor has previously told Yahoo he did not mean to disrespect Depp in his memoir.\n\nHe said: \"What certain people accused me of was my lack of respect, and I really do not disrespect anybody involved in this profession because I know how difficult it is.\"\n\nCox continued: \"Now, I may have reservations about their talent, but I certainly don't disrespect them. And my reservations about Johnny Depp are minimal â€” absolutely minimal.\n\n\"You know, I do think he's sometimes overblown, but I actually think he's also done some considerable work. Some of his work has really been extraordinarily good.\"\n\nDepp's work in Hollywood has dried up in recent years, in the wake of the high-profile fallout from his relationship with Amber Heard and her allegations of domestic violence against him.\n\nThe actor lost a libel action against The Sun in November 2020 over an article in which he was described as a \"wife-beater\".\n\nIn the wake of the case, Depp was dropped from his role as dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts franchise and replaced by Mads Mikkelsen.\n\nRead more: Johnny Depp looking for a 're-beginning' as he accepts medal from Serbian president\n\nDepp recently signed on for one of his first major roles since the court case, playing King Louis XV in a French drama set to shoot this summer."
