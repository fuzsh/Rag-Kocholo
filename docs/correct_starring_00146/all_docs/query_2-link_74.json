She won two academy awards from two of those appearances – Hannah And Her Sisters and Bullets Over Broadway. She also appeared in The Purple Rose Of Cairo, Radio Days and September.\n\nShe’s also had a long and great career outside her work with Allen. But which of those films are your favourite?\n\nHere are your choices:\n\nThe Birdcage\n\nEdward Scissorhands\n\nFootloose\n\nI Am Sam\n\nThe Lost Boys\n\nParenthood\n\nSynecdoche, New York\n\nOr write in your own.\n\nWe also wrap up our last poll – your favourite Jacki Weaver films.\n\nFirst with 36% of the vote is ‘Animal Kingdom‘. Directed by David Michod, it tells the true story of an Australian crime family and it’s downfall. It won a bunch of awards and is one of the most acclaimed Australian dramas in recent years.\n\nSecond with 30% is ‘Silver Linings Playbook‘.
