        "text": "It's hard to believe it's been 30 years since Tim Burton's \"Edward Scissorhands\" — the fantasy romance flick about a misunderstood man with scissors for hands who moves in with a suburban family — debuted in theaters on Dec. 7, 1990. In honor of the film's milestone anniversary, Wonderwall.com is checking in to find out what the cast has been up to since its premiere. Keep reading for more…\n\nRELATED: Celeb couples with big age gaps\n\nJohnny Depp starred as the titular, isolated Edward Scissorhands.\n\nRELATED: The biggest LGBTQ stories of 2020\n\nAfter \"Edward Scissorhands\" — which came on the heels of his \"21 Jump Street\" fame — Johnny Depp scored lead roles in small powerhouse films like \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\" and \"Ed Wood\" before moving on to more commercial fare like \"Sleepy Hollow,\" \"Blow,\" \"Finding Neverland,\" \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" \"Corpse Bride,\" \"Public Enemies,\" \"The Tourist\" and, more recently, \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" — though he had to resign from his villainous role in that franchise in late 2020 after losing a bombshell-filled libel case involving a U.K. tabloid that branded him a wife beater in the wake of his toxic marriage to Amber Heard, which ended in 2016. However, before that union and dueling abuse allegations made headlines, Johnny enjoyed happier romances with bold-faced names including Winona Ryder, Kate Moss and Vanessa Paradis — with whom he had two children — and a glorious career run that most notably, of course, included playing Captain Jack Sparrow in Disney's \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" franchise from 2003 to 2017. The three-time Oscar nominee also won a Golden Globe for his work in 2007's \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.\" Next up, he'll star in the 2021 drama, \"Minamata.\"\n\nRELATED: The best movie musicals\n\nWinona Ryder starred as Kim Boggs, Edward's love interest.\n\nFollowing \"Edward Scissorhands,\" Winona Ryder appeared in several films like \"Bram Stoker's Dracula,\" \"The Age of Innocence\" and \"Little Women,\" the latter two of which earned her consecutive Academy Award nominations. She also starred in \"Reality Bites,\" \"The Crucible\" and \"Girl, Interrupted.\" Following a brief hiatus from acting, in 2016, Winona staged a comeback of sorts playing mom Joyce Byers on the critically acclaimed sci-fi horror series \"Stranger Things,\" earning a Golden Globe nomination. After romancing her \"Edward Scissorhands\" co-star Johnny Depp — they were famously engaged for a time — she went on to date Soul Asylum musician Dave Pirner and Matt Damon. Since 2011, she's been in a relationship with fashion designer Scott Mackinlay Hahn. In 2020, she starred in the HBO miniseries, \"The Plot Against America,\" which was based on the 2004 Philip Roth novel of the same name.\n\nDianne Wiest played Kim Boggs' mother, Avon saleswoman Peg Boggs, who takes Edward in.\n\nAfter \"Edward Scissorhands,\" Dianne Wiest earned an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for her performance in Woody Allen's 1994 film \"Bullets over Broadway.\" She's also appeared in films like \"The Birdcage,\" \"Practical Magic,\" \"Dan in Real Life,\" \"Synecdoche, New York,\" \"Rabbit Hole\" and \"Sisters.\" For her work on the HBO drama series \"In Treatment,\" Dianne won an Emmy in 2008. She's also appeared on television shows like \"Law & Order\" and \"Life in Pieces.\"\n\nAnthony Michael Hall played bully Jim, Kim's boyfriend.\n\nWhat's Anthony Michael Hall been up to since playing Kim's bully of a boyfriend? The actor, who had already appeared in John Hughes teen classics \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"Weird Science\" before \"Edward Scissorhands,\" went on to land roles in films like \"Six Degrees of Separation,\" \"The Dark Knight\" and \"Natural Selection.\" From 2002 to 2007, Anthony starred on USA Network's sci-fi drama series \"The Dead Zone.\" In 2020, he appeared on TV's \"The Blacklist\" and \"The Goldbergs.\" Next up, he'll play Tommy Doyle in the 12th installment of the \"Halloween\" film franchise, \"Halloween Kills.\" On Sept. 7, 2019, he became engaged to actress Lucia Oskerova.\n\nKathy Baker played Joyce Monroe, Peg's gossipy friend.\n\nKathy Baker went on to appear in \"The Cider House Rules,\" \"Cold Mountain,\" \"The Jane Austen Book Club,\" \"Last Chance Harvey,\" \"Saving Mr. Banks\" and \"The Age of Adaline.\" From 1992 to 1996, she starred on the CBS drama series \"Picket Fences,\" winning three Emmys and a Golden Globe for her work on the hit show. Her performances on \"Touched by an Angel,\" \"Boston Legal\" and \"Door to Door\" also earned her Primetime Emmy Award nominations. In 2003, she married her second husband, director Steven Robman. She shares two children with first husband Donald Camillieri, whom she divorced in 1999.\n\nAlan Arkin played Bill Boggs, Kim's father and Peg's husband.\n\nAlan Arkin was a notable name in the movie business long before landing his role in \"Edward Scissorhands.\" The New York City native's impressive acting credits include \"The Rocketeer,\" \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" and \"Sunshine Cleaning.\" Alan earned three Academy Award nominations for his work in \"The Russians Are Coming,\" \"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\" and \"Argo.\" He took home the Oscar for best supporting actor in 2007 for his work in \"Little Miss Sunshine.\" From 2018 to 2019, he played Norman Newlander on \"The Kominsky Method,\" earning critical acclaim and a Golden Globe nod. Next, he'll voice Wild Knuckles in the animated film \"Minions: The Rise of Gru.\" He's been married three times and has three sons, including actors Adam and Matthew Arkin, with his first two exes. His current wife is psychotherapist Suzanne Newlander, who inspired his \"Kominsky\" character's last name.\n\nVincent Price played The Inventor, the man who created and cared for Edward.\n\nWhile Vincent Price was known for his legacy in horror projects at the time he made \"Edward Scissorhands,\" he's also been remembered for his diversity as a performer. Post-\"Scissorhands,\" the Missouri-born actor voiced Edgar Allan Poe on an episode of 1991's \"Tiny Toon Adventures\" and appeared in the 1992 TV movie \"The Heart of Justice\" before his death from lung cancer at 82 in 1993. He lost his third wife, Australian actress Coral Browne, two years before his own passing."
