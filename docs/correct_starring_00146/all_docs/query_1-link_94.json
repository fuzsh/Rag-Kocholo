        "text": "Born: 28-Mar-1948\n\nBirthplace: Kansas City, MO\n\nGender: Female\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Actor\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Footloose\n\nWiest's father was in the Army, which necessitated frequent moves for Wiest's family. As a young girl, she wanted to be a ballerina, but in adolescence her body bloomed a little too large for that petite line of work, and Wiest's interest was instead drawn to theater. She majored in drama at the University of Maryland, but dropped out when she was hired by the American Shakespeare Company. After several years on stage in many plays and several TV productions, she made her film debut with a small role in 1980's It's My Turn. Wiest first came to most moviegoers' attention as repressive preacher John Lithgow's longsuffering wife in Footloose.\n\nIn Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters, Wiest played the sister adrift, who saw herself as inferior to Mia Farrow and Barbara Hershey. In Edward Scissorhands, she played the Avon saleslady who first discovered the freakish Johnny Depp. In Bullets Over Broadway, she played the overdramatic actress who kept telling John Cusack, \"Don't speak!\" In I Am Sam, she was the reclusive neighbor who spoke up on Sean Penn's behalf. In Parenthood, she was Steve Martin's divorced and harried sister, struggling with her teenaged daughter, Martha Plimpton. In The Lost Boys, she moved with her sons to a quiet town infested by vampires. She also played the Evil Queen in The Tenth Kingdom. She has won Oscars for Hannah and Her Sisters and Bullets Over Broadway, and was nominated for Parenthood.\n\nWiest has never married, and has rarely been romantically linked with anyone, though having adopted two daughters. In 2005, her 17-year-old daughter Emily was arrested for beating up a classmate at the tony private Beekman School and stealing his iPod.\n\nBrother: Greg\n\nBrother: Don\n\nDaughter: Emily (adopted, b. 1987)\n\nDaughter: Lily (adopted, b. 1991)\n\nBoyfriend: Sam Cohn (Hollywood agent)\n\nUniversity: University of Maryland (dropped out)\n\nOscar for Best Supporting Actress 1987 for Hannah and Her Sisters\n\nOscar for Best Supporting Actress 1995 for Bullets Over Broadway\n\nGolden Globe 1995 for Bullets Over Broadway\n\nEmmy 1997 for Road to Avonlea (outstanding guest)\n\nTELEVISION\n\nIn Treatment Dr. Gina Toll (2008-09)\n\nLaw & Order DA Nora Lewin (2000-02)\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS ACTOR\n\nThe Mule (10-Dec-2018)\n\nSisters (12-Dec-2015)\n\nThe Humbling (30-Aug-2014)\n\nThe Odd Life of Timothy Green (15-Aug-2012)\n\nWoody Allen: A Documentary (30-May-2012) · Herself\n\nDarling Companion (26-Jan-2012) · Penny\n\nThe Big Year (14-Oct-2011) · Brenda\n\nRabbit Hole (13-Sep-2010) · Nat\n\nPassengers (26-Sep-2008)\n\nSynecdoche, New York (23-May-2008) · Ellen Bascomb\n\nDan in Real Life (26-Oct-2007)\n\nDedication (22-Jan-2007)\n\nA Guide to Recognizing Your Saints (3-Sep-2006) · Flori\n\nRobots (10-Mar-2005) [VOICE]\n\nCategory 6: Day of Destruction (14-Nov-2004)\n\nThe Blackwater Lightship (4-Feb-2004)\n\nMerci Docteur Rey (13-Oct-2002)\n\nI Am Sam (3-Dec-2001)\n\nThe 10th Kingdom (27-Feb-2000)\n\nThe Simple Life of Noah Dearborn (9-May-1999) · Sarah McClellan\n\nPractical Magic (16-Oct-1998) · Aunt Jet\n\nThe Horse Whisperer (15-May-1998) · Diane Booker\n\nThe Associate (25-Oct-1996) · Sally\n\nThe Birdcage (8-Mar-1996) · Louise Keeley\n\nDrunks (23-Aug-1995)\n\nThe Scout (30-Sep-1994) · Dr. Aaron\n\nBullets Over Broadway (16-Sep-1994)\n\nCops and Robbersons (15-Apr-1994) · Helen Robberson\n\nLittle Man Tate (6-Sep-1991) · Jane Grierson\n\nEdward Scissorhands (7-Dec-1990) · Peg\n\nParenthood (2-Aug-1989) · Helen\n\nCookie (2-Aug-1989)\n\nBright Lights, Big City (1-Apr-1988) · Mother\n\nSeptember (18-Dec-1987) · Stephanie\n\nThe Lost Boys (31-Jul-1987) · Lucy\n\nBigfoot (8-Mar-1987)\n\nRadio Days (30-Jan-1987) · Bea\n\nHannah and Her Sisters (7-Feb-1986) · Holly\n\nThe Purple Rose of Cairo (1-Mar-1985)\n\nFalling in Love (21-Nov-1984)\n\nFootloose (17-Feb-1984) · Vi Moore\n\nIndependence Day (21-Jan-1983)\n\nI'm Dancing as Fast as I Can (5-Mar-1982)\n\nIt's My Turn (24-Oct-1980)\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Dianne Wiest\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
