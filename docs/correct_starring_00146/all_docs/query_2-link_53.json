        "meta_description": "MovieâÂ·âSci-Fi & FantasyâÂ·â1990âÂ·â1 hour, 45 minutes â From Tim Burton comes an unforgettable fairy tale starring Johnny Depp, Wynona Ryder, Dianne Wiest and Vincent Price as the Inventor. Once upon a time in a castle high on a hill lived an inventor whose greatest creation was named Edward. Although Edward had an irresistible charm, he wasn't quite perfect. The inventor's sudden death left him unfinished, with sharp shears of metal for hands. Edward lived alone in the darkness until one day a kind Avon lady took him home to live with her family. And so began Edward's fantastical adventures in a pastel paradise known as Suburbia.",

        "text": "As the first collaboration between director Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, this melancholy gothic fairy tale was the start of a fruitful and long-lasting partnership. Set in an impossibly perfect suburb, Burton's beautiful and surreal production design not only frames the story but sets the film's emotional shifts. Depp creates a wounded romantic hero out of a Frankenstein-like figure who communicates almost entirely through silent, pained expressions. Along with his performance in John Waters' Cry-Baby earlier in 1990, Edward Scissorhands established the young actor as the first new movie star of the '90s. Dianne Wiest and Winona Ryder offer strong performances as Peg and Kim, the mother and daughter who take Edward in, as does a nearly unrecognizable Anthony Michael Hall as Kim's jealous high school boyfriend. An unlikely, magical love story, Edward Scissorhands remains among Burton's most enchanting and visually arresting films."
