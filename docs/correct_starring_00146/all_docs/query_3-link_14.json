He's a sweet and misunderstood robotic boy with scissors as hands that was created by an old scientist but he died before he could give him true hands. He's played by the legendary actor Johnny Depp.\n\nBiography[]\n\nPast[]\n\nEdward Scissorhands was made by a very old inventor. His inventor gave him everything but one thing: hands. Sadly, the inventor died before Edward could be completed.\n\nThe Present[]\n\nSeventeen years later, an Avon lady named Peg Boggs finds Edward and brings him to a colorful land called Suburbia. There, Edward shows his true talent by cutting hair, grooming pets, making beautiful ice and topiary sculptures. He also falls in love with Peg's beautiful daughter, Kim Boggs.\n\nMost of the neighborhood grows to accept and love the strange newcomer, but his innocent morals and unusually kind nature makes it clear that he does not fit in within the 'normal' world.\n\nThere is a dramatic showdown with Jim, Kim's abusive boyfriend and a serious of misunderstandings lead the town to shun him as a dangerous outsider.\n\nAt the end, Edward goes back to his lonely castle home and Kim kisses him which she tells him that she loves him.\n\nLater, Kim tells the town that Edward and Jim killed each other, ensuring that Edward will be left in peace forever. The last moments of the film reveal how much Edward's brief presence changed the town and Kim.\n\nTrivia[]"
