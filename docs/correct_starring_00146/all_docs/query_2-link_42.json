        "text": "While sticking to the Tim Burton theme, I chose to discuss the three main actors in Edward Scissorhands; Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, and Dianne Wiest.\n\nJohnny Depp:\n\nJohnny Depp is often known for his quirky and unusual character portrayals. In Edward Scissorhands, Johnny Depp plays an innocently shy robot/man that is abandoned once his creator dies. Edward is taken in by an Avon sales representative, who hopes to teach Edward how to live and interact appropriately within society. Johnny Depp delivers a solid and unique performance.\n\nWinona Ryder:\n\nWinona Ryder plays Kim in Edward Scissorhands; the daughter of the Avon sales representative, who falls in love with Depp’s dark and mysterious character Edward. Ryder also played in another film directed and produced by Tim Burton; Beetlejuice. Although she started out playing these complex characters, she eventually took on more grown up roles, like in the movies Little Woman and Girl Interrupted.\n\nDianne Wiest:\n\nDianne Wiest plays the Avon sales representative that sets out to befriend Edward, and offers him shelter and patience. Wiest acts in many different types of movies; comedy, thriller, drama, and even dips into the romance genre. Edward Scissorhands is the only Tim Burton film Wiest stars in.\n\nImages retrieved from google.com"
