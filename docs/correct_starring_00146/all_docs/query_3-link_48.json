Please cancel the meeting; I’m not going.’\n\n\"Are you f---ing nuts?,\" Depp recalled his agent saying. \"It was weird because there’s always that bastard in your skull that goes, ‘Come on, man, you’re a TV actor guy.’ Because, at that time. it was almost either or.\n\n\"[The script] passed through everything, anything, solid and went to the very core of whatever I am,\" Depp said. \"The writing was beautiful. The character was beautiful. What I suppose [attracted] me emotionally was that Edward was me. It’s exactly what I should be doing.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nAt the time, Depp admitted to feeling \"pigeonholed\" as a teen idol due to his success on \"21 Jump Street.\"\n\nDepp said he agreed to star in John Waters’ 1990 comedy movie \"Cry-Baby\" because he had to \"fight\" against the persona he had created.\n\n\"[It] was the first solid step in the direction I wanted to go,\" Depp said.\n\n\"In all honesty, I was probably doing my best for probably the last two years to get fired,\" Depp said about \"21 Jump Street.\" \"I knew how important the choice to make ‘Cry-Baby’ with John Waters was, which gave me the opportunity to make fun of this arena I’d been placed in.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBurton and Depp's collaboration on Edward Scissorhands would mark the first of many. The duo have also worked together on the 1994 film \"Ed Wood,\" \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" and \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.\""
