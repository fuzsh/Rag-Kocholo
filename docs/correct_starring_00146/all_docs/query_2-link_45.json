        "text": "Cocktail Cinema\n\nThursdays, June 13, June 27, July 11, and July 25\n\nThis season of Cocktail Cinema will explore four incredible films that shed light on the dark side of suburban living, revealing the hidden struggles and tribulations behind the facade of the perfectly manicured lawns and white picket fences. Join us as we uncover the unsettling truths lurking behind the idyllic facade of suburbia.\n\nBut first, join us in the Houston Atrium and purchase a movie-inspired cocktail. Then watch the feature on the big screen in the Annenberg Theater!\n\nCocktail Hour starts at 5:00 p.m., the films begin at 6:00 p.m.\n\nCocktail Cinema is a co-hosted event between Palm Springs Art Museum and the Palm Springs International Film Society."
