It’s exactly what I should be doing.”\n\n“He’s never going to cast me when everyone in Hollywood is after the part,” Depp recalled. “Tim’s really juggling because he’s getting hit by his agent, the studio, everybody. So I called my agent after reading the script and said, ‘Please cancel the meeting, I’m not going’.”\n\nThe actor continued her agent was not happy and said, “‘Are you f***ing nuts?’” He revealed, “It was weird because there’s always that bastard in your skull that goes ‘Come on, man. You’re a TV actor guy.’ Because at that time it was almost either-or.”\n\nJohnny Depp then “finally gave in” and met with Tim Burton. He got the part and ultimately earned his first Golden Globe nomination for the same.\n\nEdward Scissorhands also starred Winona Ryder as Kim, the local woman’s daughter who Edward falls in love with.\n\nMeanwhile, Johnny Depp has since worked with Tim Burton on several projects including Ed Wood (1994), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Corpse Bride (2005), Alice in Wonderland (2010), and more.\n\nRead also: Pregnant Taylor Swift fan went into labour during Eras Tour; Swiftie mom recalls the 'euphoric experience'"
