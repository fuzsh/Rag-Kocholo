        "text": "Dianne Wiest (born March 28, 1948, Kansas City, Missouri, U.S.) is an American actress who gained respect for her ability to convey vulnerability, her versatility, and her understated comic talents.\n\nWiest studied ballet as a child in Germany and at the School of American Ballet, but, after appearing in high-school plays, she decided on an acting career. Wiest graduated in 1969 from the University of Maryland and moved to New York City. She earned an understudy role in Kurt Vonnegut’s play Happy Birthday, Wanda June (1970–71) on Broadway and had numerous stage appearances throughout the 1970s. Her performance as a clumsy restaurant patron in The Art of Dining (1979) at the Joseph Papp Public Theater earned her an Obie Award. Other notable performances were as Masha in a 1982 production of Three Sisters and as Desdemona in a 1982 Broadway production of Othello that starred James Earl Jones and Christopher Plummer.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nWiest’s screen debut was in the minor film It’s My Turn (1980), starring Jill Clayburgh. She played the therapist of the protagonist (Clayburgh) in I’m Dancing as Fast as I Can (1982) and won praise for her portrayal of a battered wife in the little-seen Independence Day (1983). She also appeared in Footloose (1984) before gaining notice playing a Depression-era prostitute in Woody Allen’s The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985). Allen cast Wiest in a more substantive role, that of flighty cocaine-snorting Holly, in his Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), and her performance in that film earned her an Academy Award for best supporting actress and a nomination for the Golden Globe Award. She was nominated for a BAFTA Award for her role as the protagonist’s maiden aunt in Allen’s Radio Days (1987), and she starred with Mia Farrow, Elaine Stritch, and Sam Waterston in Allen’s September (1987). Wiest played mothers in The Lost Boys (1987), Bright Lights, Big City (1988), and Ron Howard’s Parenthood (1989), and the latter portrayal earned her Golden Globe and Oscar nominations.\n\nWiest starred with Johnny Depp in Tim Burton’s Edward Scissorhands (1990) and later played a psychologist in Little Man Tate (1991). She was cast as an alcoholic has-been actress in Allen’s Bullets over Broadway (1994), for which she earned a second supporting actress Oscar as well as a Golden Globe Award. Wiest also won an Emmy Award (1997) for a guest part in the television series Road to Avonlea (1990–96). She played a right-wing senator’s wife in Mike Nichols’s The Birdcage (1996) and the title character’s sister-in-law in The Horse Whisperer (1998)."
