        "text": "Gothic director Tim Burton’s Edward Scissorhands is a movie for the ages and is most notably remembered for Johnny Depp’s performance as Edward Scissorhands himself. Starring alongside Depp is Winona Ryder, who plays Kim Boggs in the movie, and the pairing of the two truly paved the way for the success of the cult classic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that the dust has settled, and Depp’s performance as the titular character is embedded in everyone’s minds, did you know that he wasn’t supposed to even play the lead role at all? There was another very well-known actor lined up way before Depp got considered for the role, but the Pirates of the Caribbean actor simply snatched it from him.\n\nA Must-Read: After Winning Defamation Trial, Johnny Depp Reportedly Star Attraction of Prestigious MTV Video Music Awards Next Weekend – May Be Invited as Chief Guest\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTop Gun Star, Tom Cruise, Came First Before Johnny Depp\n\nJohnny Depp‘s reputation as a talented actor who can play any role that is given to him spectacularly is unquestionable, as he has a track record in that field.\n\nRelated: ‘He Might.

But the iconic actor hadn’t made too much of his portfolio back then and was just behind rising star Tom Cruise for a role in the Tim Burton classic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately, for Depp, Cruise looked up the role he was offered and simply rejected it, deeming that Edward Scissorhands was an ‘ugly’ movie. Thus, Depp got the role, and from there on its simply history.\n\nAlso Read: Who is Julia Fox – Kanye West’s Ex-Girlfriend Who Will Do Anything To Support Amber Heard and Diss Johnny Depp\n\nHere’s Johnny Depp In A Video Game Trailer\n\nMosasaur Studio’s new game, Sea of Dawn is an upcoming MMORPG adventure game that will release on Mobile and PC platforms.
