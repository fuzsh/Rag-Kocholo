        "text": "Johan Cruyff died on Thursday.\n\nThe Dutch master will go down as one of the most influential people ever in football - not only as a one of the best players ever, but as a manager and shaper of other people's principles.\n\nCruyff, who was 68, invented the famous 'Cruyff turn' that first bamboozled players in the 1970s and led his Ajax teams to huge success at home and Europe and while he never managed to win the World Cup, his famed Netherlands team of the 1970s, exponents of 'Total Football' are remembered as one of the best and most entertaining teams ever.\n\nLater as a manager, he led Barcelona to title success and the European Cup, while his attacking principles and influence on Ajax and Barcelona can still be seen at those two clubs and others across Europe.\n\n\"In a way I’m probably immortal.\"\n\n\"Playing football is very simple, but playing simple football is the hardest thing there is.”\n\n\"The most difficult thing about an easy match is to make a weak opponent play bad football.\"\n\n\"Technique is not being able to juggle a ball 1000 times. Anyone can do that by practising. Then you can work in the circus. Technique is passing the ball with one touch, with the right speed, at the right foot of your team mate.\"\n\n\"Football is a game of mistakes. Whoever makes the fewest mistakes wins.\"\n\n\"It’s better to go down with your own vision than with someone else’s.”\n\n\"If I wanted you to understand it, I would have explained it better.\"\n\n\"Quality without results is pointless. Results without quality is boring.\"\n\n\"Why couldn’t you beat a richer club? I’ve never seen a bag of money score a goal.\"\n\nPep Guardiola: \"Johan Cruyff painted the chapel. And Barcelona coaches since merely restore or improve it.\"\n\nFranz Beckenbauer: \"He was certainly the best footballer Europe has produced.\"\n\nEric Cantona: \"If he wanted he could be the best player in any position on the pitch.\"\n\nFrank Rijkaard: \"He is like the Godfather of Dutch football.\""
