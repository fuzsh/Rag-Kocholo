        "text": "Another shoot for EA SPORTS! After the launch event of EAFC24 that Marcel Drent and I went to (https://lnkd.in/edeWEkAE), it was time for an in-house production. In just one day, we transformed our studio into an EA Sports setup. During the UEFA Euro24 draw, we delivered live updates to our audience about the integration of the Euro's into the FC24 game, highlighting the players and countries they can engage with. Fun one with the 433 team.\n\nProduced a new episode for Bundesliga International GmbH X 433: Our new Bundesliga Beyond series lets you find out more about some of the Bundesliga's biggest stars as we meet up with a different player each month to put them through their paces with a series of challenges. Made with a great team, and thanks to RB Leipzig (Daniela Möckel!) for their assistance. Full episodes can be found here: https://lnkd.in/enw_5a2x\n\nAnother LALIGA production in Spain, 'Elderbi Asturiano'! Our objective was to hype up the intense derby: Sporting de Gijón versus Real Oviedo in the Hypermotion league, check it here: https://lnkd.in/gUjkF3YT A concept I'm proud to have written and produced in a short time. The storytelling was crafted in the form of a rhyme, that footballer Santi Cazorla delivered in the form of a fairytale. Shot and edited in the two days we were there, prior to the match. Videography & Edit: Jim Hes, Martijn van Beek & Levy Berkenbosch. Besides that we produced another 433 takeover and a matchday experience video, reaching over 10 million views all together. On to the next one!\n\nBack at my old uni! For the third year in a row I got invited to talk at the sport business project week at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. This time it was for the third- and four year students from the ‘honours’ group. Their task? Pitching a sport event concept for Amsterdam's 750th birthday on the A10 highway. Leading up to their pitch at the municipality, I spent two mornings with them diving into examples of how we at 433 turn commercial briefings into content creation to help them enhance their communication plan. Highlighting our productions with Hublot, Call of Duty and Puma. It was nice to be back!\n\nA successful pitch night in a full AIR Amsterdam with 200+ people. I’ve worked hard on a story for a short documentary I'm really passionate about. I made it to the last 5 within the pitch contest for story makers organised by Represent Jezelf, thanks for the opportunity. A night with big media names like BNN, FunX, Omroep ZWART, De Stroom and positive feedback, has motivated me even more to continue with this. Keep you posted!\n\nWe are one of the finalists of the World Football Summit awards within the category ‘Most Impactful Branding Initiative’! Earlier this year, Sam van Raalte, Reinardus van Dam and I travelled to Indonesia to produce a new episode for the content series: ‘Common Ground’. This Bundesliga project is all about giving less privileged communities a place to play football and supporting children in their early development. Whether we win the award or not, I am feeling super proud to have worked on this project so intensively with an episode produced in Rio, Mexico City, New York, Jakarta and Zabrze. What a ride it was! The episodes are broadcasted locally on TV (Mexico Sky, ESPN NY, OneFootball Brazil), and on the social channels of the Bundesliga International GmbH & 433. Thanks to everyone that was involved and especially Martin Jäger and Daniel Donaldson for making this happen. Check the Jakarta episode here: JAK https://lnkd.in/e8XdjtwS The other 4 episodes can be viewed through these links: RIO https://lnkd.in/euu2BbWX MEX https://lnkd.in/eGgT8CBR NY https://lnkd.in/eJ_G-s3m ZAB https://lnkd.in/eH9gZzUp"
