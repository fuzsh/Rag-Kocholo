        "text": "Few countries have contributed more to the allure of the World Cup than the Netherlands, with their bright orange shirts and 'Total Football' making them among the most enjoyable sides to watch.\n\nHowever, they remain arguably the greatest footballing nation to have never won the tournament. Indeed, they hold the unenviable record of appearing in the most finals without a victory, losing in 1974, 1978 and 2010.\n\nHopes will be high that they can reach a second consecutive final in Brazil this summer to finally end their World Cup hoodoo and shake the tag of nearly men.\n\nHere, to continue our countdown to the 2014 tournament, Sports Mole looks at the top 10 players in the history of Holland.\n\n10. Edwin van der Sar (1995-2008, 130 caps, no goals)\n\n© Getty Images\n\nNarrowly beating out a host of other Netherlands legends is the greatest goalkeeper in the country's history. In a nation famed for their fluent and attacking football, Edwin van der Sar was an unlikely star but one that shone brightly throughout a 13-year international career.\n\nHis mammoth tally of 130 caps makes him the highest appearance maker in Holland's history, and he bowed out from international football with a spot in the All-Star team of Euro 2008. Individually, he was named Dutch Footballer of the Year in 1998 and holds the worldwide record for the longest time without conceding a league goal, going 1,311 minutes without being beaten during the 2008-09 season.\n\nThe 43-year-old is one of very few people to have won the Champions League with two different teams, while he also won eight league titles, five domestic cups and the UEFA Cup during his time with Ajax and Manchester United.\n\n9. Faas Wilkes (1946-61, 38 caps, 35 goals)\n\nAs if Faas Wilkes's international record of 35 goals in 38 games wasn't impressive enough, the striker saw his Holland career disrupted when he would have arguably been in his prime due to the country's refusal to allow professional players to participate.\n\nWith the absence of international football between 1949 and 1955, when Wilkes would have been 25-32, he continued his prolific goalscoring abroad with the likes of Inter Milan, Torino and Valencia.\n\nFamed for his creativity and mazy dribbling, Wilkes is still revered in his home country and even inspired a cartoon character, such was his appeal. He remains fourth in the all-time goalscoring charts for Netherlands, reaching his tally of 35 far quicker than the likes of Robin van Persie, Patrick Kluivert, Dennis Bergkamp and Ruud van Nistelrooy.\n\n8. Willem van Hanegem (1968-79, 52 caps, six goals)\n\nWhile the mighty Ajax were taking Holland and Europe by storm under the stewardship of Johan Cruyff and Rinus Michels, Willem van Hanegem was inspiring Feyenoord to compete with their domestic rivals on both fronts.\n\nIndeed, the midfielder made almost 300 league appearances in two spells for the club, helping them to three league titles, the KNVB Cup, the European Cup and the UEFA Cup at a time when Ajax were expected to sweep all before them.\n\nVan Hanegem teamed up with Cruyff and co on the international stage and was a key component in the team's golden era of the 1970s. He was part of the side that reached the final of the 1974 World Cup and finished third in the European Championships two years later, but he was one of many talented Dutch players to retire with no international honours.\n\n7. Frank Rijkaard (1981-94, 73 caps, 10 goals)\n\n© Getty Images\n\nThe second golden era of Dutch football supplied many more legendary figures, and Frank Rijkaard was right at the forefront of Holland's success in the 1980s and early 1990s. The defensive midfielder/centre-back established himself as one of the finest players in the world in either position, merging stylish skills with some of the darker arts of football.\n\nHe was part of the Dutch triumvirate that also included Marco van Basten and Ruud Gullit, joining his fellow countrymen at AC Milan, where they won back-to-back league titles and European Cups. Rijkaard also won five league titles, three cups and the Champions League during his time with Ajax, where he started and finished his illustrious career.\n\nHis greatest success came on the international stage, however, as he helped Holland to the one and only trophy in their history at the 1988 European Championships. He was twice named as the Dutch Footballer of the Year and also came third in the voting for the Ballon d'Or on two occasions.\n\n6. Ronald Koeman (1982-94, 78 caps, 14 goals)\n\n© Getty Images\n\nAnother member of that 1988 European Championships-winning side, Ronald Koeman was one of the finest attacking centre-backs the game has ever known. His powerful shots and deadly free kicks were well renowned throughout the football world, and he retired as the highest-scoring defender in history.\n\nIn addition to his success on the international scene, Koeman also amassed plenty of silverware at club level. Having won four Eredivisie titles, three KNVB Cups and a European Cup during his time in Holland with Ajax and PSV Eindhoven, Koeman became part of Johan Cruyff's 'Dream Team' at Barcelona.\n\nThere, he picked up another European Cup, a Copa del Rey and four consecutive La Liga titles at the start of the 1990s. Individually, he was named the Dutch Footballer of the Year in 1987 and 1988, beating off stiff opposition from the likes of Marco van Basten, Frank Rijkaard and Ruud Gullit.\n\n5. Johan Neeskens (1970-81, 49 caps, 17 goals)\n\n© Getty Images\n\nWhile Johan Cruyff is the man credited with leading the Dutch golden era of the 1970s, Johan Neeskens was every bit as important to the team's philosophy as the maestro. The embodiment of 'Total Football', Neeskens usually started the match in central midfield but was versatile enough to fill in anywhere that was required.\n\nIndeed, once Cruyff had retired from international football it was Neeskens that carried on the style and helped the team to their second consecutive World Cup final in 1978. That match ended in disappointment, as did the same event four years earlier despite Neeskens opening the scoring against West Germany from the spot.\n\nThere was no shortage of silverware at club level, however, as Neeskens amassed two Eredivisie titles, two Dutch Cups and three consecutive European Cups with Ajax before adding a Copa del Rey and Cup Winners' Cup to his haul at Barcelona.\n\n4. Dennis Bergkamp (1990-2000, 79 caps, 37 goals)\n\n© Getty Images\n\nThe goal pictured above arguably sums up Dennis Bergkamp better than any words could. In a tight World Cup quarter-final against Argentina, Bergkamp produced a sublime piece of control to take down Frank de Boer's 60-yard pass, beating Roberto Ayala before slotting the ball past the keeper to send Netherlands into the last four.\n\nHis technique was among the finest ever seen on a football field, and that winner in the dying stages against Argentina is just one of a number of breathtaking goals from a glittering career. While he never picked up any silverware on the international stage, his club career included four league titles, six domestic cups, two UEFA Cups and a Cup Winners' Cup with Ajax, Inter Milan and, most notably, Arsenal.\n\nIndividually, Bergkamp was named the Dutch Footballer of the Year twice and came third and second in the voting for the Ballon d'Or in 1992 and 1993 respectively. He also came third in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards on two occasions and is an inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame.\n\n3. Ruud Gullit (1981-94, 66 caps, 17 goals)\n\n© Getty Images\n\nCutting an unmistakable figure on the football field, Ruud Gullit joined Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard in dominating European football at both international and club level. The versatile attacking midfielder holds a unique place in Dutch football history having become the first player to pick up international silverware for Netherlands as captain of the 1988 European Championships-winning team.\n\nThere was more success at club level, where he won three Eredivisie titles and a KNVB Cup before his move to AC Milan. There, the Dutch connection helped the Italian giants to three Serie A titles and back-to-back European Cup triumphs, with Gullit scoring twice in the 1989 final against Steaua Bucharest. He later won a Coppa Italia with Sampdoria and an FA Cup with Chelsea to add to his honours list.\n\nIndividually, he was named the Dutch Footballer of the Year on two occasions and won the prestigious Ballon d'Or in 1987 before finishing second to Van Basten a year later.\n\n2. Marco van Basten (1983-1992, 58 caps, 24 goals)\n\n© Getty Images\n\nHad injury not curtailed his career and forced him to retire at the age of just 28, Marco van Basten may well have been mentioned in the same breath as the likes of Pele, Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi in the discussion of the greatest ever.\n\nDespite finishing at such a young age, Van Basten won the Ballon d'Or award three times - a tally only Messi can beat. At club level, he was the jewel in the Dutch crown of AC Milan, helping them to three Serie A titles and two European Cups alongside Rijkaard and Gullit. He also won three Eredivisie titles, three KNVB Cups and the Cup Winners' Cup during his time with Ajax.\n\nHis finest moment came at the 1988 European Championships, however. Van Basten scored five goals to fire Holland to their first international trophy, being named Player of the Tournament and capping his peerless campaign off with a spectacular volley from an impossible angle in the final against the Soviet Union.\n\n1. Johan Cruyff (1966-77, 48 caps, 33 goals)\n\n© Getty Images\n\nRegarded by many to be amongst the greatest to have ever graced the game, few players have had such a big impact on football as Johan Cruyff. As the on-field conductor of 'Total Football', Cruyff brought a new dimension to the sport and even has a move - 'The Cruyff Turn' - named after him.\n\nThe central cog in the all-conquering Ajax side of the 1960s and early 1970s, Cruyff won eight Eredivisie titles, five KNVB Cups and three consecutive European Cups with the team, while he added another league title and KNVB Cup with Feyenoord at the tail end of his career. He also spent a notable stint with Barcelona, where he won a La Liga title and the Copa del Rey.\n\nIt was on the world stage that Cruyff flourished brighter than most, however, as he led Netherlands to the final of the 1974 World Cup. Their defeat to Franz Beckenbauer's West Germany didn't stop Cruyff being named Player of the Tournament, and the Dutch side of '74 are still regarded as one of the greatest teams to have never won the trophy.\n\n'The Total Footballer' was named Dutch Footballer of the Year five times and awarded the Ballon d'Or on three occasions, becoming the first man to win the prestigious award more than twice. He was also named the second greatest player of the 20th century by the International Football Federation of History and Statistics, behind only Pele.\n\nNetherlands will face Spain, Chile and Australia in the group stages of this summer's World Cup, and you can follow every match live with Sports Mole."
