        "text": "With only one double weekend left to play in the Dutch premier league, Eddy Merckx is the best player on average with a slight lead over Ruben Legazpi. The Belgian scored 1.804 over 12 games, the Spaniard 1.801 over 14. Dave Christiani and Eddy Leppens realized the best matches with 3.636 over 40 caroms. Glenn Hofman is the best Dutchman with 1,763 over 16 games ahead of Frans van Kuyk with 1,594 over 20 games and Dave Christiani with 1,540 over 19.\n\nBefore this final weekend, it is nice to compare the individual average of the players in the premier league. Therefore, we apply that players must have played a minimum of five matches to be in the rankings. While Dick Jaspers and Omer Karakurt have the best averages, but they did not play those 5 matches. Dick Jaspers has 1,860 out of 2, Omer Karakurt 1,885 out of 3.\n\nDave Christiani and Eddy Leppens played the best individual matches over the season so far, both with 3,636. The shared number 3 position is for Eddy Merckx, Frans van Kuyk and Peter Ceulemans with 3,337, Glenn Hofman is number 6 with 2,857, followed by Ruben Legazpi, Raimond Burgman, Sergio Jimenez and Nikos Polychronopoulos with 2,666.\n\nIn the ranking over the entire competition, or at least 5 matches, Belgian Eddy Merckx leads with 1,804 out of 12 ahead of Spaniard Ruben Legazpi with 1,801 out of 14, Greek Nikos Polychronopoulos with 1,781 out of 13 and Belgian Eddy Leppens with 1,768 in 8 matches. Glenn Hofman is the best Dutchman with 1,763 over 16 ahead of Frans van Kuyk and Dave Christiani.\n\nThe ranking with individual averages (with the number of matches, possibly also in first division, like Roland Forthomme and Jef Philipoom, who only played 4 matches in the highest league):\n\n1 Eddy Merckx 1.804 (12)\n\n2 Ruben Legazpi 1.801 (14)\n\n3 Nikos Polychronopoulos 1.781 (13)\n\n4 Eddy Leppens 1,768 (8)\n\n5 Glenn Hofman 1.763 (16)\n\n6 Roland Forthomme 1.684 (24)\n\n7 Turgay Orak 1.616 (7)\n\n8 Frans van Kuyk 1.594 (20)\n\n9 Dave Christiani 1.540 (19)\n\n10 Peter Ceulemans 1.521 (20)\n\n11 Sergey Jimenez 1.509 (12)\n\n12 Peter De Backer 1.479 (20)\n\n13 Jeffrey Jorissen 1.472 (20)\n\n14 Jean van Erp 1.464 (17)\n\n15 Dion Nelin 1.458 (9)\n\n16 Barry van Beers 1,448 (19)\n\n17 Burak Hashas 1,440 (13)\n\n18 Jean Paul de Bruijn 1,428 (18)\n\n19 Raimond Burgman 1.421 (18)\n\n20 Johan Loncelle 1.418 (15)\n\n21 Martin Horn 1.413 (6)\n\n22 Anno de Kleine 1,401 (19)\n\nThe limit is set at 1,400, finishing just below are: Jef Philipoom 1,396 (25), Pierre Soumagne 1,394 (11), Birol Uymaz 1,393 (5).\n\nTherese Klompenhouwer, the only lady, finished with 1,168 out of 18 matches, an improvement on the previous season when she reached 1,027."
