        "text": "The Goal news website has named the Iranian international forward of the Dutch Heerenveen football club among the Eredivisie’s best XI of 2016-17 in a Monday (May 15) report.\n\nAccording to a report by IFP, Ghoochannejhad, who is not used to missing scoring chances, scored 19 goals in 34 matches to help his side finish in ninth place at the end of the season.\n\nGhoochannejhad ranked third among Eredivisie’s top scorers following Feyenoord’s Danish striker Nicolai Jorgensen (21 goals) and Vitesse’s Ricky van Wolfswinkel (20 goals).\n\nHeerenveen’s forward played a total of 2,924 minutes for his team this season and registered three assists. Sixty percent of his shots have been on target, more than top scorer Jorgensen (54 percent) and Wolfswinkel (58 percent).\n\nPraising his brilliant performance, the Goal report said scoring 19 goals for the Heerenveen team finishing right in the middle of the league is no easy achievement, but the Iran international has been deadly all season.\n\nOther members of Eredivisie’s best XI of 2016-17 are: Willem II’s Greek goalkeeper Kostas Lamprou, Feyenoord’s Dutch right-back Rick Karsdorp, Feyenoord’s Brazilian centre-back Eric Botteghin, Ajax’s Colombian centre-back Davinson Sanchez, Feyenoord’s Dutch centre-back Terence Kongolo, PSV’s Dutch midfielder Davy Propper, Feyenoord’s Dutch defensive midfielder Karim El Ahmadi, Ajax’s Dutch-born Moroccan attacking midfielder Hakim Ziyech, Jorgensen, Heracles’ Swedish forward Samuel Armenteros."
