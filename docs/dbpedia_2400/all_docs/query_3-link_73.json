        "text": "Pueblo is home to some historic sites when it comes to sporting venues.\n\nFrom “The Slab” basketball courts to Hobbs Field to the historic Dutch Clark Stadium, some of these locations have been mainstays in Pueblo for decades.\n\nBut what is it that makes these locations so iconic? Here is a quick look into the history of the iconic sporting venues in Pueblo, including how they got started and how they're looking now.\n\nMore: Here are 10 more notable former Pueblo high school athletes. See where they are today\n\n“The Slab”\n\nThe Slab is historic because its origins date back to 1937 when a Veterans Memorial was built there. Around 1953, due to improper drainage in the area at that time, the memorial deteriorated and was moved to its present location at Mineral Palace Park near the Lake Clara Bridge. The facility was reborn and converted into a recreational area with a large concrete slab.\n\nTwo basketball hoops were originally installed on each end of the “slab” with fencing separating the hoops from the concrete benches on either end. During the late 1950s or early 1960s, one additional hoop was installed and the original two were relocated to the east side of the SLAB, which resulted in three half courts for more play. It wasn’t until the late 70s or early 80s when new baskets were installed along the west edge of the SLAB creating four “condensed” full courts that are currently present.\n\nBasketball was considered the primary activity at the Slab. A recent Chieftain article stated that between the 1950s and 60s, the SLAB became a prime spot for teens and young adults, all of whom were itching for the chance to shoot hoops there.\n\nMike Sexton, current Assistant Parks and Recreation Director recalled the condition of the SLAB playing surface before the resurfacing project. “People played here so much it got like ice under the baskets,” he said, referring to the concrete’s tendency to be polished smooth by countless basketball shoes.\n\nThe courts were resurfaced again in 1992, which was the last time the SLAB surface was replaced.\n\nWith the completion of the SLAB basketball court renovations scheduled to be completed by October 1, 2024, this facility's future is again bright to be the prime spot for summer basketball competition.\n\n“I grew up there and this project is one that is very close to my heart,” Sexton said. “It is my hope that the next generation can remember the history of this Pueblo iconic sports facility. Generations of Pueblo athletes shot hoops here at one time or another. It has been one of the most used sports facilities in the city.”\n\nRunyon Sports Complex (Hobbs Field and more)\n\nRunyon Field was born when a set of bleachers were moved there from the old Merchants Field. In 1938, the field was officially established as a baseball field and called County Park. Babe Ruth would play an exhibition game at the park that same year.\n\nRunyon played host to many different teams over the years. From the Pueblo Rollers to the Pueblo Dodgers to the Pueblo Bruins — all teams affiliated with major league baseball teams. After years of teams coming and going through Runyon, in 1958 the Western League, the host of all these teams, folded. Runyon was on the verge of closing down; however, the community rallied and raised $15,000 to help keep the historic field open.\n\nIn the middle of 1985, a second full-size field and a youth field were built to expand the complex. Later in 1995, the main field at Runyon was renamed Hobbs Field after Oneal Hobbs. He is called the father of baseball in Pueblo as he was the general manager of the Pueblo Dodgers/Bruins while they played here and was also the former president of the Western League. A few years later the second full-sized field was named Andenucio Field after Tony Andenucio.\n\nOver the years, the complex has been host to many different events, tournaments, high school and collegiate games. It's been through the rigors of hot summers and cold winters. Eventually, repairs were necessary to upgrade the facility.\n\nIn 2022, Andenucio, Corsentino and Pusedu Fields were all upgraded with new infield turf. Later in the year, renovations began. In early 2024, Hobbs Field was reopened to the public featuring new turf, new dugouts, upgraded fencing around the infield to provide better viewing for the fans, and a new press box to boot.\n\nDutch Clark Stadium\n\nWith a growing need for a stadium to house the many fans that would show up for a Centennial versus Central football game, the idea of having a stadium for all the high schools in town began swirling around in the late 1940s.\n\nIn 1950, Pueblo Public School Stadium was officially built. It originally had enough seating to hold approximately 8,000 people, but within five years that had to be expanded to close to 13,000 seats. That same year, 65,000 fans attended events at the stadium.\n\nRewind about 30 years prior, a young man by the name of Earl Clark began his football career for Pueblo Central. “Dutch” as he was called would eventually become one of the greatest football players in the nation and have a lengthy career in the NFL. He passed away in 1978.\n\nThroughout his career, Dutch would win countless games and put up insane numbers during his pro days. After his passing, the community rallied to have the name of the local stadium changed to honor Earl “Dutch” Clark. Eventually, in 1980, District 60 Board of Education voted to rename the facility Dutch Clark Stadium.\n\nSince then, the stadium has played host to multiple sporting events including high school football, soccer, track and field, even basketball, as well as college games, high school graduation ceremonies and more.\n\nHowever, the one thing that the stadium has hosted more than anything else is the famous Bell Game. The Bell Game is the oldest rivalry game between two high schools west of the Mississippi. Pueblo Central and Pueblo Centennial have been playing for the Bell since Thanksgiving Day 1892.\n\nIn 1950, the rivalry game was officially declared the Bell Game when the introduction of the railroad bell as a trophy for winning the game. Since then, the rivalry games have expanded to include Pueblo East and Pueblo South, known as the Cannon Game.\n\nOver the years, the stadium has been expanded and renovated, with the latest renovations happening over the past few years, including new lighting.\n\nAaron Bravo, the current athletic director for Pueblo School District 60, has been leading the renovations and hopes to continue to upgrade the facilities while he is still there.\n\n“It truly is an iconic sports site in the state of Colorado, and we are fortunate to have the stadium linked to D60,” Bravo said. “We are currently in the thick of some major site renovations. New turf is currently being installed and should be completed this year.”\n\nMore: These lesser-known Pueblo athletes have been making waves in their sports\n\nChristopher Abdelmalek is a sports reporter for the Pueblo Chieftain and can be reached at cabdelmalek@gannett.com or follow him on X, formerly Twitter, @chowebacca.
