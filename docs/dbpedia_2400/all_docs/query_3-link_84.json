        "text": "Brighton have signed their fair share of Dutch players down the years. And as the Albion prepare to travel to Amsterdam to face Ajax in the Europa League, Billy Greening has taken on the task of ranking every Seagull from the Netherlands.\n\nThere are 13 in total. Some are household names (Davy Propper). Others you might not have head of (Soufyan Ahannach). And one would be able to make you a pretty good dinner (Former Dutch Marine CHEF).\n\nBut who comes out best of the Dutch? Read on to find out.\n\n13) Roland Bergkamp\n\nWe begin with unlucky 13 and Roland Bergkamp, the nephew of the Non Flying Dutchman and Arsenal great Dennis.\n\nSigned in July 2011 as Albion were promoted to the Championship, I only saw Bergkamp (Roland, not Dennis) in a pre-season friendly against Horsham in Worthing. He never made a first team appearance.\n\n12) Soufyan Ahannach\n\nAfter joining in 2017, Ahannach failed to make his first team debut but did have two appearances in Checkatrade Trophy games against Oxford United and Stevenage.\n\nOne of three Dutch players I have not seen live. Ahannach has had five clubs since leaving permanently in 2020 and currently plays for Wydad AC, Morocco’s most successful team.\n\n11) Kjell Scherpen\n\nThe second of the Brighton Dutch players I have not seen live, so perhaps harshly placed in 11th.\n\nFormer Ajax goalkeeper Kjell Scherpen joined us from the Dutch champions in 2021, making his debut away at West Bromwich Albion in a third round FA Cup tie.\n\nThe 6’8 stopper is current on loan to potential Europa League opponents Sturm Graz.\n\n10) Elvis Manu\n\nElvis was signed in 2015 for £1.5 million but failed to shake up the south coast. Making just 17 appearances, he was caught in a trap and soon left the building.\n\nNow plays for FC Universitatea Cluj in Romania.\n\n9) Tim Krul\n\nNinth spot on the list is possibly a bit cruel (sorry) for an outstanding goalkeeper like Tim.\n\nBest known for his time with Norwich City and his 2014 World Cup penalty shootout heroics for the Netherlands v Costa Rica.\n\nAlways felt confident with him in between the sticks and is currently signed with Luton Town.\n\n8) Bart Verbruggen\n\nOne of three Dutch players currently with Brighton and he may well find himself featuring against Ajax.\n\nSigned from RS Anderlecht this summer for £17 million. Verbruggen has not been with us long enough yet to warrant a higher ranking, but he has the potential to be one of the best Dutch goalkeepers the Albion have ever had.\n\n7) Danny Holla\n\nMidfielder Danny Holla made 33 appearances for the Albion, the vast majority coming under Sami Hyypia (shudder).\n\nAlways seemed to work hard and a good professional. His last club was Sliema Wanderers in the Maltese Challenge League.\n\n6) Rajiv van La Parra\n\nDespite only seven appearances on loan for Brighton in the 2015-16 season, I loved Rajiv van La Parra.\n\nSkilful, flair and a lot of potential. He went onto play in the Premier League for Huddersfield Town and the Champions League for Red Star Belgrade.\n\n5) Jan Paul van Hecke\n\nJan Paul van Hecke was born six months after Darren Freeman scored the first goal of the new Millennium when Brighton beat Exeter City at Withdean Stadium.\n\nHaving already pocketed Erling Haaland in his brief Brighton career to date, he is growing in confidence in every game.\n\nVan Hecke joined the Albion from NAC Breda in 2020. 23 appearances so far and I really think he is improving all the time.\n\n4) Davy Propper\n\nWith 121 games for the Albion, Propper is currently our second highest Dutch appearance holder.\n\nHe never gave the ball away in midfield with Dale Stephens after signing for what was then a club record fee of £9 million from PSV Eindhoven in 2017.\n\nA real stalwart. Came out of retirement and now plays for Vitesse Arnhem. He won 19 international caps for the Netherlands.\n\n3) Joel Veltman\n\nVeltman is fast becoming an Albion legend and will soon overtake the previously mentioned Propper in the Brighton appearance count for Dutch players.\n\nHe has played 119 games so far and after signing from Ajax for just £900,000, he must rank as the best value for money deal ever?\n\nA world class right back, the Ajax away fans gave him an excellent reception a fortnight ago at the Amex. He can expect the same at the Johan Cruyff Arena.\n\n2) Hans Kraay Jr\n\nA career which had it all. Hans Kraay became an instant favourite with the Goldstone Ground crowd and nearly 40 years on, he retains his own fan club on North Stand Chat.\n\nBrought total football to the south coast. Described by Chris Cattlin as “the finest professional footballer I have known.”\n\n23 yellows and multiple reds in as many games. You messed with Evil Hans at your peril. What a man.\n\n1) Michel Kuipers\n\nNumber one on the list of course had to be the Former Dutch Marine CHEF Michel Kuipers.\n\nMultiple world class saves and single handed match winning performances; Wolves away, Bristol City at Withdean in the Division Two title winning season and Blackpool at home the year before to name but a few.\n\n10 years of service, three promotions and close to 250 appearances. Kuipers was a real BHAFC legend who was always there for us when we needed him.\n\nAs a P.S I would like to thank the country of Curaçao so I did not have to rank Jurgen Locadia or Kemy Agustien."
