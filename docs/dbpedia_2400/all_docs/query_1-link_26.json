People often say that Belgium and the Netherlands might speak the same language, but culturally, they're different worlds. I've found that to be true. But honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way! I came across a quote by Steve Jobs this morning, shared by Dan Abrahams, that kind of summarizes my time in Belgium: \"Start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology.\" Here's how I see it. There are three key steps to grow a business while keeping fans at the center of every discission: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Engagement: Create content and experiences that actually engages people. It's not just about data, it's about creating real connections. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Technology: Connect every touchpoint you interact with fans both online- and offline. But don't just rely on data alone. It is important, but nothing beats talking to fans face-to-face. It gives you real insights into what works and what doesn't, on matchdays and every other day. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Commercials: Don't just raise prices; raise the experience. Make things better based on what you've learned, and the revenue will follow. Last week, I got a lot of questions about my top moments at Club Brugge. Besides making new friends and enjoying unforgettable championships and trips, here's what I'm proudest of accomplishing with the team: üåü We've built a marketing department from scratch, handling all digital campaigns. üåü During COVID, we've launched WEARBRUGES to motivate fans to safely venture outdoors. üåü We ditched lots of old software along the way and replaced it with new tech. This helped the Club grow the active fanbase from 30K to a whopping 100K+ within 2 years. üåü We revamped our cashback-program into a membership program to include everyone, from casual browsers to hardcore fans. üåü Updated and migrated the Club Brugge website to a new CMS, now fully integrated with the Club App. üåü Last but not least, launched ClubID 2.0 which led to over 200% increase in seat offers within just the first two games. To wrap this up, a big THANK YOU to everyone who's been part of this amazing journey at Club Brugge. Now, on to the next chapter in the beautiful world of football! üôè\n\nLast week I've had the honor of traveling to Melbourne with my colleagues Peter Sprenger, Damian Fran√ßois and Arno de Kloet from Techonomy to explore the latest trends and innovations in the sports industry. The trip was nothing short of incredible, and I came away with many new insights and ideas that I'm excited to share with you. One of the highlights of the trip was attending the SportNXT conference, where I've exchanged knowledge about the impact of AI, ML, loyalty, and memberships on the sports industry. It was inspiring to talk about how these technologies are transforming the way that sports organizations engage with their fans and stakeholders. It's clear that this will be the next big narrative in the industry, and it's an area that you won't want to miss out on! During our trip, I also had the chance to meet and share knowledgr with some amazing sports organizations, including Western Sydney Wanderers FC and Melbourne Victory Football Club. We discussed fan engagement strategies, memberships, and loyalty, and it was great to see that engagement is the top priority for driving commercial growth. At Club Brugge, I'm already looking forward to the launch of our renewed and upgraded membership program for both young and old fans. Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting project! It was also thrilled to see how Sion de Jong, Trent Jacobs and Hans Westerbeek of Sports Cloud Australia are helping Australian sports organizations to better engage with their fans and stakeholders. Their commitment to innovation and excellence is truly inspiring, and I can't wait to see what they'll achieve in the future. Overall, this trip was an incredible experience, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have learned so much and met so many amazing people. I'm excited to bring these new insights back to my work and to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the sports industry. But for now, it's time for a well-deserved break. I'm heading off to Bali for a week of rest and relaxation before diving back into the world of sports. Stay tuned for more updates, because I've got some exciting news to share with you soon!"
