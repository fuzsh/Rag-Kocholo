        "text": "I was wondering which Dutch players who are playing in the Dutch Eredivisie or other top divisions around the world that have parents or grandparents from Indonesia.\n\nPlayers that i have heard of who have Indonesian heritage are:\n\nJohn Heitinga - Ajax\n\nDemy De Zeeuw - AZ Alkmaar\n\nJeffrey Altheer - Excelsior\n\nGiovanni Van Bronkhorst - Feyenoord\n\nRoy Makaay - Feyenoord\n\nMichael Mols - Feyenoord\n\nJhon Van Beukering - NEC\n\nCharles Dissels - NEC\n\nMichael Timiselu - VVV Venlo\n\nJason Oost - VVV Venlo\n\nRobin Van Persie - Arsenal, England\n\nWilfred Bouma - Aston Villa, England\n\nDenny Landzaat - Wigan, England\n\nBobby Petta - Adelaide, Australia\n\nJeffrey Leiwakabessy - Aachen, Germany (2nd div)\n\nJeffrey De Visscher - Aberdeen, Scotland\n\nAlso players with Suriname heritage who also have Indonesian heritage:\n\nHedwiges Maduro - Ajax\n\nSigourney Bandjar - Excelsior\n\nDelano Hill - Willem II\n\nAlso one Belgium player with Indonesian heritage is:\n\nRadja Nainggolan - Piacenza, Italy (2nd div)\n\nDoes anyone know of any other players with Indonesian heritage in the Dutch Eredivisie or other top European leagues?\n\nAlso please make any corrections if i've made any mistakes.\n\nThe only ones I'm 100% certain about being of 100% Indonesian heritage are Bobby Petta, Denny Landzaat, Michael Mols and Gio van Bronckhorst. The latter two are actually of Moluccan descent - the Moluccan islands are stil fighting for their independence from Indonesia so I thought I'd mention it. One of Heitinga's parents is Indonesian. Van Persie I believe has an Indonesian grandmother but he also has Surinamese blood.\n\nOften when you think a Dutch player looks of Indonesian descent, what he actually is is Hindustan-Surinam. In colonial times, the Dutch recruited thousands of people from the Indian province of Hindustan to work on the Surinamese plantations. Many people of Hindustan-Surinamese descent have since settled in the Netherlands.\n\nEnd of the day all of them are as Dutch as Gouda cheese of course.\n\nWow, this really comes as a big surprise, i knew that almost all those players werent totally dutch, but i never thought they were of indo.. descent. I thought players like Oost, Bouma, Landzaat were mulattos.\n\nMaduro isn't suriname he's Aruban. and i dunno about bouma he has some ebo-features. i thought he was half Antilian.\n\ni dunno who u mean with charles dissels. i only know one, he plays at sparta and has no indo blood for all i know.\n\nof course we also have a coach with indonesian decent. ANDRE WETZEL\n\ni know there are more players with indo-blood, but its hard to tell who exactly.\n\ni think Cocu and Ruud van Nistelrooy have Indonesian heritage.\n\nThat's right, there is no Indonesion heritage, as Indonesia only came into existance when the parents of these players were of Dutch nationality as inhabitants of the former Dutch East Indies. It isnot so strange that there are so many, as the number of people that has Dutch Indies roots are about ten percent of the population. You also cannot distinguish them from \"normal\" Dutch by looking at them as the big(ger) part of them are blond and blue, green or grey eyed. The Moluccan are a special case, as they declared an independent state, that was overrun by the Indonesion state. So they had no nationality when they arrived in the Netherlands. But they too are of Dutch indies origin, and not Indonesian!!!\n\nI found this topic by accident but I have to say there are Surinamese players with Indonesian background.\n\nThere are many people in Suriname from Javanese descent!\n\nMany Surinamese people are mixed, but they look like they are from African descent, but they have a little bit of Chinese eyes, and a Chinese last name or some Portugese, Jewish or Dutch blood or Javanese in them. Like Humberto Tan has I Chinese last name but he doesn't look Chinese.\n\nThe players of Indonesian descent in Holland almost all have Dutch blood in them, the rich Dutch people there had Indonesian women.\n\nThe Moluccan players are often more 'pure blooded' they often were soldiers for the Dutch Indonesian Army in exchange for getting an independent Maluku (which they never got), but also sometimes they have some Portugese blood or some other."
