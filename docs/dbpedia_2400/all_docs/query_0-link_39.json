        "text": "Don‚Äôt do it. 113 The world‚Äôs tragedies can make life seem like a terrible option. From geopolitical horrors to utterly isolated suffering. If you stare long enough into the abyss, the abyss starts staring back into you. Too often, people with outwardly seemingly perfect lives, choose to end it. No complaints, no rumors, no signs, just clean cuts. Where my old econometrics professor said that ‚ÄúThe path to success, winds along the edge of the abyss of utter despair‚Äù, a whole lot of other trails pass by it as well. We are not accustomed to talk about our doubts, insecurities, and fears. Contrary to wishful thinking, we fear others may smell blood. It doesn‚Äôt have to be like that. We must foster close, intimate, long-lasting relationships to stay sane in this world. Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU Amsterdam) attributed their #AbrahamKuyperLezing to mental wellbeing in our days. A topic entitled to attention, given people in NL are 13 times more likely to kill themselves than to be killed by others. I‚Äôm no professional, but now that I have your attention, please: 1. Talk to your trustees 2. Step back into exercise and nature 3. Get to the bottom of things If all else fails, please, call 113 Zelfmoordpreventie.\n\nüåü What if curiosity isn't just a trait but a secret weapon for your business? Unlock the Power of Curiosity in Your Organization! üöÄ Curiosity is more than just a trait; it's a critical driver of organizational success. According to Francesca Gino's research published in the Harvard Business Review, fostering curiosity in the workplace can lead to remarkable benefits: ‚úÖ Improved Employee Engagement: Curious employees are more engaged and motivated. ‚úÖ Enhanced Collaboration: Teams that embrace curiosity collaborate more effectively. ‚úÖ Better Decision-Making: Curious minds make more informed and innovative decisions. However, many leaders mistakenly suppress curiosity, fearing it might lead to inefficiencies or risks. To harness the full potential of curiosity, consider these strategies: üëâ Hire for Curiosity: Look for candidates who demonstrate a natural inquisitiveness. üëâ Model Inquisitiveness: Leaders should set an example by being curious themselves. üëâ Emphasize Learning Goals: Shift the focus from performance metrics to continuous learning. üëâ Encourage Exploration: Allow employees to explore new ideas and broaden their interests. üëâ Ask Thought-Provoking Questions: Regularly pose questions like \"What if...?\", and \"How might we...?\" to stimulate creative thinking. By embedding these practices into your organizational culture, you can adapt more swiftly to market changes and external pressures, driving your business towards greater success. Let's cultivate a culture where curiosity thrives! #Leadership #EmployeeEngagement #OrganizationalCulture #ForeverLearners\n\nThe importance of boundaries at the workplace is understood but definitely not easy to follow. Especially when it comes to diverse teams with varying gender, culture, races. Is your company good at it? Are you talking about it? Talking enough? Here is a book coming out that you can pre order and better still: invite Evita to speak, inspire and invite her for a workshop to engage with your employees to co-create. I know Evita Lammes personally and was absolutely so impressed with her from the moment we met during an Equals session. Evita followed the Art of Hosting training in Netherlands in 2022 and this gave me the opportunity to feel her passion and sincerity for inclusivity, creating a safer space for all humans - especially those in the workplace. So I do not say this lightly when I say - please support this important piece of work Evita is bringing into the world. üìò‚Äú'Where do we draw the line?' teaches employees to effectively align boundaries with work, in their own way. How do you set your boundary? How do you address someone else? How do you ask a colleague about it? With many assignments, tips and a number of cases. A culture of accountability can never be the sole responsibility of HR or managers. With the book (and/or a training course) you lay the foundation for joint responsibility for social safety.‚Äù Links to buy and support are below! üëáüèΩ\n\nThis year I've written portraits of some female rolemodels in MICE for Meeting Magazine. After the pandemic, some experienced leaders left the industry. When business started to pick up, many young people joined and it brings a breath of fresh air. But it also brings challenges. The organisation of congresses and business events require KnowHow, attention to detail, understanding a diversity of corporate or institutional protocol, great handling of logistics. (etc, etc, as the king would say!) Underneath all of that, it requires emotional intelligence to deal with cross cultural issues. That kind of experience can rarely be learned at home or at school. In this series of portraits, powervrouwen (female leaders) give an insight into their paths and their succesformula. It was a pleasure to find that most powerwomen remain open and approachable. The gatekeepers-climate, found around some male dominated powerfigures, was almost completely absent. Could this be a signal of a bright future, where corporate communication needs not be like political powerplay? It looks like the democratisation of the work environement is starting to flow upstream. The interview with Dineke Philipse is a great example of a powervrouw who sets her example quietly but firmly, simply by living in truth to her own believes.
