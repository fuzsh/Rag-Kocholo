        "text": "The club’s Low-Cost, High-Value model approach is based on the Dutch philosophy, methodologies, and principles implemented in clubs across the Netherlands. Holland is known for the most successful youth development systems in the world and renowned for producing 100s of top players like Virgil van Dijk, Johan Cruijff, and so many more. Our highly qualified coaching staff follows the famous Dutch soccer curriculum that guides players from 6 years of age to 18. We implement an economic and guided discovery training process where we accelerate the development of the technical skill sets of the players. This enables us to rapidly level up our focus to the tactical, strategic, and thinking side of the game. An individual’s development and soccer success are dependent on the team’s progress, which can take years to develop, and the main reason for retaining the core group is so important. A group is more likely to succeed when a stronger bond, camaraderie, and team chemistry exists. The result is playing a more attractive Possessive Attacking style where the team can build the game up from the back and dominate possession, control the outcome, and win more games and championships. And because we understand there is more to life than just soccer, we positively mold the players’ character along the journey to overcome the many challenges and adversities they face, creating the habit of seeing all obstacles in life as an opportunity to grow individually. Our Club Dues are less than half of most of the clubs in the area.\n\nAcademy Club Dues run between $75-$110/month.\n\nSelect Club Dues run less than $1950/year.\n\nAs a certified Non-Profit 501c3 Organization, we can offer a Low-Cost, High-Value model, just like in Holland, thanks to our volunteers, sponsors, and partners. Contact the coach of the team you’re interested in or contact the Director of Coaching today to learn more about joining a team today."
