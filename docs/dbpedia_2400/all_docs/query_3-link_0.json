        "text": "One of the greatest, and unluckiest players the Netherlands produced.\n\nFaas Wilkes is the true meaning of a legend, and boasts one of the greatest goal ratios in the history of the Netherlands national team.\n\nHis status on the national team surpasses that of Kluivert and Bergkamp, for he has scored 35 goals, in only 38 games.\n\nBut that's not the whole story, the main reason he didn't make a higher record, which would have probably stood until this day, was because the moronic KNVB did not allow players who played abroad to play for the national side.\n\nDespite being written as a Dutch International from 1946 to 1961, Faas did not play from June of 1949, until March in 1955, and no one can argue that he would've made the record of 40 goals for the Netherlands a much, much higher record, that until this day, would have stood strong.\n\nHe sadly died on the 15th of July in 2006, aged 82, but no one can forget the greatest record to have ever been produced by a Dutchman.\n\nOut of all the players that played for the Netherlands national team, Faas Wilkes is probably the most stunning and most underrated talent the Netherlands has ever produced.\n\nFinally, the top 5. It was always a matter of guessing in the previous slides, but most of the people can guess all the remaining individuals finishing in the top 5.\n\nThe only thing left is, where will they be on the top 5 list.\n\nAnd number 5 is a player that has done it all, and seen it all.\n\nFrank Rijkaard is one of the Dutch legends that has done almost everything when it comes to football.\n\nHe has won the Champions League in both it's formats, new and old. He has won the Champions League as a manager with Barcelona (even when they don't play for the team they go and coach it, like I said, an eternal bond), he also won La Liga as a manager, Serie A as a player, and most of all, was one of the players who won the Netherlands one major trophy, the EURO 1988 trophy.\n\nThis is a man that has proven to the world what Dutch players can do, what Dutch managers can do, and what football is all about.\n\nUsually in football, when a player has his career ended by an injury, people usually say that he would've been great, had it not been for his injury, and that he would've been a legend.\n\nDespite having his career cut short by injury, van Basten has done everything a footballer can ever dream of.\n\nI'm not gonna waste my breath with his list of honors, it's a ridiculously long list, check it out for yourself. I just need to state that he won the Ballon D'or a record of three times (held jointly by Platini and another Dutch legend) .\n\nI will mention however, that he was the World player of the year, the European player of the year on many occasions, and that he was one of the greatest strikers in history.\n\nRegarded by many as one of the greatest footballers of all time, this man has won three Serie A titles, three Italian super cups, two Champions League trophies and a truckload of trophies and individual honors.\n\nVan Basten was ranked as the number one player that had his career cut short by injuries, and despite his short career, he has scored a massive 277 goals.\n\nOne of the most prolific players in history, and if the Netherlands is lucky enough to give birth to another van Basten, then truly trophies won't be far away from them.\n\nA man beyond words, and a man that has changed the history of football as we know it.\n\nCruyff has impacted his national team, and his clubs.\n\nNo man has ever changed Barcelona, Spanish or foreigner like this man did, the way they play football was triggered by his arrival to Barcelona in the 1970s.\n\nAs a player and as a manager, Cruyff is one of the very main reasons why Barcelona is where it is right now, and the player that started the eternal bond between the Dutchmen and Catalonia.\n\nIt's fair to say that had it not been for Cruyff, Barcelona would have been just another team from Spain. A good team, but not great.\n\nHe continued the total football style of play that he triggered upon arrival as a player, and made sure Barcelona played total football as a manager.\n\nUntil this day, Barcelona play in the total football style, mainly because of Rinus Michels (manager of Ajax at the time, and creator of the total football style of play), and Cruyff himself.\n\nHe was referred to as \"The Total Footballer\", and was voted as the greatest European player of the last century, along with winning the Ballon D'or a record of three times (Jointly held by van Basten and Platini).\n\nHe took the Netherlands national team to two World Cup finals, and were madly unlucky not to win any of them, if not both.\n\nCruyff's bond with Barcelona is so strong, that until today he is an influential advisor for the club, and his son Jordi even played for Catalonia, and Cruyff is now the manager of Catalonia.\n\nAnd now for the number one spot, which many people probably know who it is by now, and many people might criticize this decision, but it's really quite easy to explain.\n\nPlease allow me to introduce the greatest Dutchman in footballing history.\n\nThere is only one word to describe the Dutch players in football, and that word describes them more than any other footballing country on the planet.\n\nThat word is technique.\n\nCruyff was known globally as \"The total footballer\", and also as \"The flying Dutchman\". It's only \"The non-flying Dutchman\" that could be ahead of him on this list.\n\nMaradona and Messi are easily the greatest dribblers in history, and Cristiano Ronaldo is probably the greatest overall player football has ever seen. Johan Cruyff was referred to as \"The total footballer\", but \"The Dutch master\" is easily the most technically gifted player football ever seen.\n\nThis list wasn't based on personal awards (Bergkamp never won the player of the year), and it was never based on trophies (he has never won the Champions League either). Instead this list was based on who was the greatest Dutchman in the Dutchmen's biggest strength, and that strength is technique.\n\nDo yourself a favor, go to youtube.com and type \"Dennis Bergkamp - The Magic Moment\", you'll understand what technique is all about.\n\nThe world has seen many footballers, many great legends throughout history, but none of them has ever looked at football the way Bergkamp did.\n\nBritish author Simon Kuper once wrote in the Financial Times;\n\n\"One night last year some legends of Dutch football gathered for dinner in an Amsterdam house. Around midnight conversation turned to an old question: who was the best Dutch footballer ever? Dutchmen have been voted European Footballer of The Year seven times, more than any other nationality except Germans. Yet Jan Mulder, a great centre-forward turned writer, chose a player who had never even threatened to win the award nor, at the time, a Champions League: 'Bergkamp. He had the finest technique', said Mulder. Guus Hiddink , the great Dutch manager, nodded, and so the matter was settled.\"\n\nWhat defined Bergkamp from all the others was quite simple.\n\nAny footballer, or any human being for the matter, they always take it one step at a time, you dribble through the first, then if the second shows up you dribble through him too.\n\nBut Bergkamp was nothing like that, he always went by the golden rule.\n\nAlways account for variable change.\n\nHis goal for Ajax against Feynoord for example, he received the ball, and did not take a second touch, he made the first touch perfect, and then fooled the goalkeeper to leave the goal empty, and without even looking, he chipped the ball because he knew that there would naturally be a defender running to cover the empty goal.\n\nThe end result was one of the most magnificent goals in footballing history, and he didn't even look at the goal to know that there would be a defender, he just accounted for variable change, which was what defined him from all the other footballers to ever play the game.\n\nHe always planned things ahead, never needed to take a look, and not leaving things to instincts.\n\nIn a country that gave birth to the likes of van Basten, Gullit and Cruyff, it is Dennis Bergkamp who was the most gifted of all, and is quite truly, the greatest Dutchman football has ever seen."
