        "text": "After another embarrassing failure from the national team, Dutch football has plummeted to a new low that marks a spectacular fall from its golden days of club and international glory.\n\nThe 2-0 win over Sweden in their final qualifying game on Tuesday couldn't prevent Netherlands missing out on the 2018 World Cup, but the country had given up hope long before then.\n\nAfter reaching the finals and semi-finals of the last two World Cups, Oranje find themselves the laughing stock of Europe and the latest slip leaves the country wondering once again where its national game is headed.\n\nWith the famous style that blossomed at Ajax in the late 1960s under legendary coach Rinus Michels and a squad led by the iconic Johan Cruyff, the Dutch developed a philosophy that taught the world a new way of playing. Inspiring players and coaches for generations, their influence has been evident in some of the great foreign teams that have emerged since.\n\nThe Ajax, Feyenoord and PSV sides that won European, UEFA and Club World Cups in the 1970s propelled Netherlands from an afterthought on the world stage to a dominant force.\n\nStars like Cruyff, Johnny Rep, Johan Neeskens, Wim Jansen, Willem van Hanegem, and Ruud Krol led national teams that won the hearts of fans across the world as they reached the 1974 and 78 World Cup finals. They were so scintillating they remain celebrated as among the best the competition has ever seen, despite losing both times.\n\nKnown for producing excellent players to act out their style of high pressing, swapping of positions, neat passing in triangles and an attacking nature, they elevated football as an art form and spread the philosophy across the world.\n\nAs if building on from the 1970s Ajax team and the 1974 World Cup, Michels oversaw another crop of remarkable players as a side consisting of Ruud Gullit, Ronald Koeman and Frank Rijkaard won the only major trophy the esteemed country has to its name.\n\nThe combination of artistic beauty and sporting mastery that culminated in Marco van Bastenâs goal against USSR in the 1988 European Championship goes down as the last truly wonderful moment for the national team.\n\nThe current team showed little resemblance to the past greats as they had no energetic pressing, smart passing or any sort of tactical plan or cohesion.\n\nWith the midfield being completely bypassed and opponents finding it easy to isolate them on the wings, they looked helpless all the way through, carrying on a dismal three-year spell since the third-place finish at the 2014 World Cup.\n\nNeeding wins and lots of goals in their last matches against Belarus and Sweden as they looked to overcome a three-point gap and a huge goal difference deficit to seal a playoff spot, Dick Advocaatâs side fell flat and showed that the competition in Russia will not be worse off without them.\n\nAfter the horror of missing out on an expanded Euro 2016, another summer of inactivity awaits next year and the Dutch football association (KNVB) must work out the next step to fixing the many problems in the team before the issues continue.\n\nCrucially, they must prepare for a change in generation within the squad.\n\nWith veterans such as Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder, Robin van Persie and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar all being called upon throughout their qualifying campaign, the Dutch are still clinging to the team that made it to the final at the 2010 World Cup, but the switch in generation is inevitable.\n\n\"We are in a phase where we don't have top, top players,â Ronald de Boer told Goal when asked about the current problems.\n\n\"The top players are getting older and the young players are basically too young to fill in the gap. We have a lot of talent, but it is [young] talent, they have not arrived yet.\n\nâIf I see the qualities [of the young Dutch generation] I think they are incredible. But it is still only talent that fluctuates... it is going great then it goes down. But, for me, they are unbelievably talented and hopefully [in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar] they will be at the age of about 25.\"\n\nThe likes of Georginio Wijnaldum, Daley Blind, Kevin Strootman, Virgil van Dijk and Memphis Depay will develop further by then and suggest there will be a healthy bridge between age groups.\n\nThe way the talent of the current side has been handled through the latest catastrophe leaves little faith in the KNVB, given it is their long-term plan for getting through the two qualifying campaigns that led to it.\n\nThe governing body claimed to be defending Dutch footballâs âattacking principlesâ with the appointment of Guus Hiddink as Louis van Gaalâs successor after the 2014 World Cup, also naming Danny Blind as the man to take over after Euro 2016 to get them to Russia next year.\n\nThe plan to make them a dominant, attacking team fell apart within the first year, however, as Hiddink left during the Euro 2016 qualifying round and Blind was let go halfway through the now-closed road to Russia.\n\nAmid their awful performances, the need to build up through the wings, lack of movement and understanding between players, the only resemblance they had to the previous generations was the 4-3-3 formation.\n\nTo limit the Dutch style as merely the formation and desire to hold onto the ball for the sake of it is a wild misinterpretation of those attacking principles.\n\nâWe lost identity,â ex-Ajax and Tottenham boss Martin Jol said recently. âOur identity was always good organisation and an attacking style. Now, if we do that, we concede too many goals.\n\nâIn Netherlands our philosophy was to be different. Now we want to be like everybody else â and they are bigger and better than us.â\n\nThe 1970s was a glorious decade for Dutch club football after Feyenoord started an impeccable decade for the country with a 1970 European Cup win over Celtic. Each of Dutch footballâs big three won international trophies in the next 10 years: Ajax were crowned continental champions in each of the next three seasons, while Feyenoord and PSV both claimed the UEFA Cup.\n\nEven though between them they would each win just one European trophy over the next three decades, they continued to be held in high regard with the quality they had in the squad.\n\nAfter Ronald Koeman, Wim Kieft and Willy van de Kerkhof led PSV to European Cup success in 1988, the Dutch style had one last sensational run thanks to Van Gaalâs young 1995 Champions League winning team that featured the De Boers, Patrick Kluivert, Marc Overmars and Clarence Seedorf.\n\nNow, it has since become normal for Dutch sides to crash out of Europe before they enter the knockout rounds.\n\n\"Then you have the big leagues, who [in addition to signing the top players] are signing all the decent players too. Before we could attract decent players as well, towards places like Amsterdam.\n\n\"These players are not coming anymore. So now we are stuck with players [in the Eredivisie] who, in my eyes, are not good enough.â\n\nThe perpetual downgrading of their squads puts the Eredivisie teams in a dangerous spiral. As the league itself declines, teams find themselves unable to rise to the challenge against more tactically adept European opponents.\n\nAs De Boer put it, the gulf in quality between playing against Dutch sides and the European powerhouses is like going from playing against your mother to facing a legendary defender.\n\n\"If you want to develop yourself, you have to play against the best, or at least those good enough that you think âOh, I still have to reach this kind of level'.\n\n\"I think they are not tested. I always make the example: If I play against my mother, I win easily. So, I am not tested and I think that is good enough. But suddenly, I then play against Marcel Desailly and it is a different ball game. If I lose, I then think that next time I need to step up.\n\n\"But the players don't know when to step up as they are never tested. Then suddenly they are tested in Europe, but we only have Vitesse playing in the Europa League and Feyenoord because they are champions and automatically qualified for the Champions League. They lost 4-0 to Manchester City, they were destroyed. Then they lost easy to Napoli, 3-1.\n\n\"We are so far away now because we are not tested. We have to change, how we do it is difficult, though. We have an interesting league, it is nice, it is entertaining, but it is not good.\"\n\nThe current philosophy in the country is just too rudimentary for the rest of the world, who have moved on technically and tactically from the Dutch.\n\nThe concerns over the players they are producing, their identity, issues with the league, coaching and general bad management from the KNVB, the Dutch are looking inept in all aspects that saw them rise to the top of world football and stay there for decades.\n\nFalling to a new depth with their latest World Cup catastrophe, it has become clear they have strayed far from the Total Football philosophy that made them great in the first place.\n\nAs a delicate period nears, the KNVB must look for a way to get the entire national game back on track. It may not be another revolution the Dutch need, but instead just a re-revolution."
