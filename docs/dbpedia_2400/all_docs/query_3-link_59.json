        "text": "Ajax, Dutch professional football (soccer) club formed in 1900 in Amsterdam. Ajax is the Netherlands’ most successful club and is best known for producing a series of entertaining attacking teams.\n\nAjax was promoted to the top Dutch league, the Eredivisie, for the first time in 1911. Under the coaching of Jack Reynolds in three stints (1915–25, 1928–40, and 1945–47), Ajax won eight Eredivisie titles. Yet, by the mid-1960s, the club was struggling near the bottom of the first division until a former striker for the club, Rinus Michels, took charge. Michels turned Ajax’s fortunes around, fashioning an attacking style of play in which talented young players such as Ruud Krol, Johan Neeskens, Arie Haan, and Johan Cruyff frequently swapped positions during a game. That playing style, known as “total football,” soon became famous around the world. From 1966 Ajax won the Eredivisie six times in eight years, and in 1969 it became the first Dutch team to reach the final of the European Cup (now known as the Champions League). The club won the European Cup three times in a row (1971–73) and also won the 1972 Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Super Cup and the 1972 Intercontinental Cup.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz"
