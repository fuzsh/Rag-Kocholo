        "text": "To give a meaningful answer:\n\nThe following wingers appeared in the top 100 of Dutch footballers composed by Henk Spaan (a Dutch football journalist).\n\n98 Peet Petersen\n\n97 John van 't Schip\n\n96 Rinus Bennaars (inside-left; famous in Holland for containing Pele in a match when used as defender, an unusual position for him)\n\n90 Jo Bonfrere\n\n89 Henk Schouten (an inside-forward though, but not a pure striker)\n\n82 Jan Mulder (a great striker but used as a right-winger for the national team, if he played)\n\n81 Frans Bouwmeester (a natural left-winger but when he moved to Feijenoord and Coen Moulijn came along he became an inside-left)\n\n77 Coen Dillen (all-time goalscorer in a single season in the Eredivisie, hi managed this feat as a right-winger)\n\n74 Henk Wery (the right-winger of the European Cup winning team of 1970)\n\n72 Tscheu la Ling\n\n71 Mick Clavan (for 17 consecutive years a national team player)\n\n67 Gerard 'Pummie' Bergholz (a left-winger but Feijenoord had already Coen Moulijn so he moved to the right...)\n\n65 Tinus Bosselaar\n\n61 Theo Pahlplatz (famous Twente player in the 1970s)\n\n53 Simon Tahamata\n\n51 Gerald Vanenburg (the next Cruyff, the eternal talent and a very flashy player with a wide variety of tricks)\n\n49 Rene van de Kerkhof\n\n47 Piet van der Kuil\n\n44 Sjaak Swart\n\n38 Johnny Rep\n\n35 Tonny van der Linden (also an inside-left)\n\n31 Willy Brokamp (inside-left, very technically gifted player, a master of the free kick)\n\n29 Kees Rijvers (the inside-right of the Magical Inside Trio)\n\n24 Kick Smit (inside-left, 'the wanderer')\n\n21 Bertus de Harder (on of the first to go abroad)\n\n19 Coen Moulijn\n\n13 Piet Keizer\n\n7 Rob Rensenbrink\n\n5 Faas Wilkes (the inside-left of the Magical Inside Trio)\n\n3 Abe Lenstra (in the Dutch team nearly always the striker but his favourite position was the inside-left position and could operate as a outside-winger as well)\n\nIf somebody thinks I forgot one I can look it up.\n\nMaybe he had a nice peek at Ajax, but after that it was soon \"over\" for him and so only had a pretty short presence at the top. I am still thankful for him making that cross to Ruud against Germany at the Euro 2004 but he only played 17 times for the national team. At Everton he was almost always a bench player if I remember correctly.\n\nTo call him one of the best is not realistic, but maybe you like him like I like van Vossen. A player does not have to be the best in order for you to like him seeing playing.\n\nActually I think a lot of people making top lists of players do it with quite a margin of bias also. Maybe they will use as a base year to year ranking lists etc., but even then you have to puzzle so much that personal bias will get into it. I saw a knowledgeable poster from United claim that Jaap Stam should be rated higher than Dennis Bergkamp. He was dead sure. Wonder where that came from\n\nI have seen all games from Overmars for the NT and all from Robben. I have seen countless games from both on club level. Pretty hard to tell who I would choose. Both absolute great players.\n\nIt also feels a little bit inappropriate to me to compare them. They have both been great for my NT and therefor I love them both. It's like asking a parent what kid they love the most\n\nthe thing is with Van Der Meyde, i feel he left Ajax too early, and injury as well. but he only have 2 season shine at Ajax and the rest of his career is a downfall, he barely play for Everton, and was bad at Inter ( well most of the time )\n\nrealistically, yeah he;s not a world class, but he should have been, and he have that gift, he just made the wrong decision leaving Ajax\n\nOvermars and Robben is just 2 good players, hard to compare, but Overmars is more technical + tactical player though, Robben is a pure winger, Overmars can be anywhere on the pitch and still own, well overall, a more complete player than Robben\n\nSorry for the kick but here is a really good television profile about Coen Moulijn, made in 1965 so before the 'Golden Era' started. At that time Moulijn was the poster boy of Dutch football thanks to good performances against England national team and many more.\n\nhttp://www.geschiedenis24.nl/speler.program.7108432.html\n\nAt the end the journalist Herman Kuiphof, the Dutchies here know him, says the following as conclusion:\n\n\"The question whether he is the best left winger Holland has ever known is a question I can't remotely answer. Jan de Natris was also very good in his own age. And [Kees] Mijnders, Joop van Nellen, Koos van Gelder and what do you think about Bertus de Harder? Yes, that one was probably the best 'number 11' [traditional left winger] we had ever seen. But his best years took place in another era and therefore every comparison is pointless.\n\nMaybe Moulijn played his most electrifying game at the age of 18, which he has in common with De Harder and others before him. Maybe he could have developed his abilities further if he had left Feyenoord in favor of a foreign competition such as Spain. The interest from abroad was big, like when he played a marvelous friendly against Barcelona. Barcelona wanted to have him, but Feyenoord blocked it.\n\nBy any standard, he is not the old fashioned Dutch player. Not the one who symbolizes the 'big boy, brave heart'. He is supple, fast, skilled and tricky. He is blessed with the suppleness of an Argentinian, a Brazilian, a Spaniard.\n\nAt the moment he is out of shape with issues, but someone like him will return in the foreseeable future.\"\n\nInteresting and good summary because this good journalist mentions a few of the 'forgotten' national legends. Also nice that he briefly touches the dominant football philosophy until the 1960s, lets hope that these times will never return and someone like Leroy Fer will not be glorified.\n\nThe level of football journalism in these days also leaves a lot to be desired by the way."
