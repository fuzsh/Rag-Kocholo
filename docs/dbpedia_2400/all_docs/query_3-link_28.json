        "text": "Holland’s 5 Greatest Ever Footballers\n\nThe Dutch national team’s status as one of the best teams in the world is unquestionable both historically and recently.\n\nThe Western European side has only won one major international trophy in the form of the 1988 UEFA European Championships, but also regularly appears and place either second or third in major tournaments.\n\nThe Dutch are known for being exceptionally technical with a love for passing the ball and the national side has regularly consisted of multiple superstars in the same team.\n\nHere are 5 of the best to have represented Holland:\n\nJohan Cruyff\n\nPosition: Attacking Midfielder / Forward\n\nCaps: 48\n\nGoals: 33\n\nThe most famous proponent and exponent of the Total Football philosophy, as well as the originator of football’s most common dribble in the ‘Cruyff Turn’, Johann Cruyff is an icon of the sport. The maestro’s senior international debut came in September 1966 at the age of 19, and he took his chance, scoring in a 2-2 draw vs Hungary. His debut came in his second season as a pro for Dutch giants AFC Ajax.\n\nDespite hitting double figures for goals in six consecutive league seasons and often scoring 20 - 30 league goals per season, Cruyff was a sporadic member of the national team in the 1960s, with only 11 caps for Oranje by 1970.\n\nThis was partly due to the fact Cruyff had been sent off in his second game for his country, becoming the first Dutch international to receive a red card. He was also accused of being aloof at times.\n\nIn the new century, his importance began to grow. After 1971, Cruyff earned at least 4 caps a year until his retirement from international duty except for 1 year in 1975. By the 1974 World Cup, Cruyff was captain.\n\nPlaying as a forward with the freedom to roam, Cruyff started all 6 games and scored 3 goals as the Dutch finished as runners-up to Germany. His goals came vs Argentina and Brazil in the knockout rounds. Cruyff’s exceptional performances at the ’74 WC meant he was awarded player of the tournament.\n\nThe versatile attacker then led Holland to the 1976 Euros where the side finished third, with Cruyff only playing the semi-final loss to Czechoslovakia.\n\nAfter helping his homeland qualify for the 1977 World Cup, Cruyff retired from the national side in 1977 at 30 years old.\n\nCruyff is iconic due to the win-with-style philosophy which he learned whilst playing and carried over into coaching. This pass-and-move ethos has evolved into a national identity for the Dutch, and all youth players are taught to play this way in the present day.\n\nMarco van Basten\n\nPosition: Striker\n\nCaps: 58\n\nGoals: 24\n\nPossibly the most naturally talented #9 the Netherlands have ever produced, Marco van Basten had an illustrious career but one unfortunately shortened by injury.\n\nThe legend’s senior international debut came in September 1983 at 19 years old. The debut was at the start of his third season as a pro, then playing for Dutch club AFC Ajax. After scoring 2 goals in his first 3 games, van Basten became a regular member of the Netherlands squad, but not a nailed-on starter immediately.\n\nVan Basten’s transition to indispensable came in 1988. Prior to this year, van Basten had only scored 6 goals for his country. After getting called up to the squad for Euro ’88 and coming off the bench in Holland’s first game, the striker scored a hat-trick in the next game; a 3-1 win vs England.\n\nAfter this virtuoso display, he started the next 4 of his side’s games, scoring the winner in the semifinal and another goal in the final to lead the Netherlands to their first major international trophy in their history.\n\nPlaying under manager Rinus Michels - the coach who taught Johan Cruyff Total Football - van Basten was unstoppable at the Euros; playing in a fluid 4-4-2 as a #9 alongside Ruud Gullit. After finishing as the top scorer of the competition, the Dutchman was also named player of the tournament, Van Basten continued to be integral going into the 1990 World Cup.\n\nHe started all 4 games as Oranje exited in the RO16, not scoring at the competition in a disappointing display for both the player and the team.\n\nVan Basten’s last major international tournament was Euro 1992. The attacker started all 4 of Holland’s games as they reached the semifinals for the third time in history. While ending up goalless at the tournament, van Basten’s performance was impactful enough to earn him another player of the tournament. His last cap came in October 1992 at just 26-years old; this was due to persistent ankle injuries.\n\nVan Basten won the Ballon d’or in 1988, 1989 and 1992. An elegant technician with impeccable close control and dribbling, van Basten also excelled at volleys and headers due to his tall frame. He could shoot with both feet, and his composure was never shaken. A football legend who may have been one of the best ever without injuries.\n\nDennis Bergkamp\n\nPosition: Forward\n\nCaps: 79\n\nGoals: 37\n\nKnown as the ‘Non-Flying Dutchman’ due to his fear of flying in aeroplanes, Dennis Bergkamp never showed such fear when out on the pitch. The playmaker’s senior international debut came in September 1990 during his fifth season as a pro at Dutch club Ajax. Bergkamp was 21 years old at the time. After 5 goals in his first 9 caps, the attacker solidified his place in the squad for Euro 1992.\n\nWith the #7 on his back, Bergkamp started all 4 of Holland’s games at the tournament, scoring 3 goals as The Flying Dutchmen reached consecutive semi-finals, finishing with a bronze medal.\n\nPlaying either in the midfield of a 5-3-2 or a striker in a 4-4-2, Bergkamp was influential, scoring the winner in a group tie vs Scotland, and the equalizer in the 2-2 draw vs Denmark in the semis which Holland eventually lost on penalties. Bergkamp finished as the joint-top scorer of Euro ’92, as well as earning a place on the team of the tournament.\n\nThe forward continued to be influential going to the 1994 World Cup. Wearing the #10 now and playing as a shadow-striker in a 4-4-2, Bergkamp once again dazzled on the big stage. He started all 5 of the national side’s games, scoring 3 goals as Holland reached the quarter-finals for the third time ever.\n\nAfter performing well in two international tournaments, Bergkamp’s status as a starter was undoubted as Euro ’96 approached, and so it was. The playmaker started all 4 of Holland’s games, scoring once as the Dutch exited in the Euro ‘96 QFs to England.\n\nInitially not a starter at the 1998 WC, Bergkamp came off the bench in the first game vs Belgium but started the side’s next 5 games, scoring 3 goals as the Netherlands reached a WC SFs for the third time ever. One of his goals was a memorable late winner vs Argentina in the QFs.\n\nHis performance earned him a place on the team of the tournament. Bergkamp’s last major international tournament was Euro 2000. He started all 5 games as Holland earned another bronze medal, reaching the SFs. The forward retired from international football after the tournament, aged 31.\n\nAn intelligent player who was extremely silky on the ball, Bergkamp was as good at dropping deep and creating chances with his vision as he was at finishing chances he fashioned through his spatial awareness. His first touch was one of the best ever seen; Bergkamp was truly a magician.\n\nRobin van Persie\n\nPosition: Forward\n\nCaps: 102\n\nGoals: 50\n\nHolland’s top scorer of all time, Robin van Persie’s 12-year international career illustrates evolution and longevity. Initially, a winger, RvP’s senior international debut came in June 2005 at 21-years old.\n\nThe debut came at the end of his fourth season as a pro, but his first at the time for English club Arsenal FC. The attacker immediately became a regular starter for Oranje, and he was rewarded with a place in the 2006 World Cup squad.\n\nAt the ’06 WC, RvP started all 4 of Holland’s games and scored once, playing on either the left or right-wing as the Dutchmen made it to the RO16. He continued to be integral going into Euro 2008, and this was illustrated by van Persie being handed the #7 shirt prior to the tournament.\n\nAt the Euros, the enigma played all 4 of his side’s games (1 start), scoring 2 goals as the Dutch reached the QFs.\n\nBy the 2010 World Cup, van Persie had transitioned into being a proper centre-forward. Now wearing the #9, RvP started all 7 games as the Netherlands finished runners-up to Spain, scoring once vs Cameroon in the group, a game in which he was named man of the match. In a disappointing Euro 2012 which saw Oranje crash out in the group stage, the marksman started all 3 games, scoring once in a group game vs Germany.\n\nRvP was named captain of the national team in June 2013. The 2014 WC was van Persie’s last major international tournament and arguably his best for his country. After scoring a brace in a 5-1 win vs then-defending champions Spain, RvP then scored in a 3-0 thrashing of Brazil in the third-place playoff to seal another bronze medal for Holland. The forward scored 4 goals in the competition overall. Van Persie retired from national team duty in August 2017 at the age of 34.\n\nA technically brilliant attacker blessed with a good frame at 6 feet; possessing a venomous left foot and underrated footballing intelligence, RvP at his best scored with every chance he got. While a good winger, his transition to striker propelled him into being world-class later in his career.\n\nHe could score headers, freekicks, volleys etc. van Persie was the total package as a forward player.\n\nArjen Robben\n\nPosition: Winger\n\nCaps: 96\n\nGoals: 37\n\nRanked in Holland’s top 10 for both goals scored (Joint 4th – 37 goals) and total caps (9th – 96 caps), Arjen Robben provided flair and excitement anytime he represented his homeland.\n\nHis senior international debut came in April 2003 at 19 years old. Robben was at the end of his third season as a pro, and his first for Dutch giant PSV Eindhoven.\n\nAfter 2 goals in his first 4 caps, the attacker became a regular for his country. This led to a call-up for Euro 2004, where Robben started 4 from 5 games on the left wing of a 4-3-3 as the Dutch reached the SFs, earning a bronze medal. Robben scored the winning penalty in the QF shootout vs Sweden, which sealed progression to the semis. His performance certified his role as a starter in the national team.\n\nAt the 2006 World Cup, Robben started 3 out of 4 games on either flank of a 4-3-3, scoring once as the Dutch exited in the RO16. The winger’s solitary goal was the winner in Holland’s opening game vs Serbia and Montenegro, a game in which he won man of the match.\n\nHe also won this award in the next game vs Ivory Coast. Euro 2008 followed and was disappointing for player and nation as the Flying Dutchmen crashed out in the QFs. Robben only played 2 games (1 start), scoring once in a 4-1 rout of France in the group stage.\n\nBoth player and country redeemed themselves at the 2010 WC as the Dutch brought home silver for the third time in history. Initially unused during the first 2 games due to a slight injury, Robben then scored 2 goals in 5 games (4 starts) when he recovered. Both goals came in the knockout rounds, with one being the winner in the RO16 vs Slovakia and the other vs Uruguay in the SFs.\n\nAt Euro 2012, Robben started all 3 games on the right flank of a 4-2-3-1 as Oranje crashed out of the group stage, with the winger going goalless in his first major tournament. The 2014 World Cup was Robben’s last major international tournament, and like RvP, was likely his best.\n\nThe winger started all 7 of Holland’s games at the tournament, scoring 3 goals as the Dutch earned another bronze medal. His goals were all in the group stages, with a brace in the 5-1 win vs Spain, and another in a 3-2 win vs Australia.\n\nRobben retired from international football in October 2017 at the age of 33. For a player who relied a lot on his pace, Robben showed incredible longevity, playing in 3 World Cups and 3 European Champions during his international career.\n\nHe also made an impact usually, scoring in ~80% of the international tournaments he played in. Very left-footed, Robben cutting infield from the right flank to cross or shoot was well-known by all, yet remained unstoppable throughout his career. A good dribbler with a fantastic shot, the Dutchman is one of the best wingers of this century.\n\nHonourable Mentions:\n\nPatrick Kluivert, Danny Blind, Edwin Van der Sar, Wesley Sneijder, Harry Dénis and Giovanni van Bronckhorst."
