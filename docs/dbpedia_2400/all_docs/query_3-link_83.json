It was used to describe people acknowledged to be of mixed Dutch and Indonesian descent, or it was a term used in the Dutch East Indies to apply to Europeans who had partial Asian ancestry.\n\n-- I am also including European Dutch players born in the Dutch East Indonesia. Around 31 members of the Dutch national team in history were born over there. More players born in Dutch Indonesia have played for Holland than players born in Suriname.\n\n-- I am using \"any Indonesian\" blood rule. So anybody who has Indonesian blood is considered. Some players actually do not look Asian. And they also belonged to the Surnamese-Dutch.\n\n-- I am excluding any player from the Dutch East Indies team that went to the 1938 World Cup Finals. They are honoured here with South East Asia(ASEAN).\n\n-- Giovanni Van Bronckhorst is well-known about his Indonesian background. I do not know if people knows about Roy Makaay, Robin Van Persie and Nigel De Jong.\n\n-- Beb Bakhuys, Just Göbel, Dick MacNeill, Leo Bosschart and Edu Snethlage were of European descent, but born in Dutch East Indies (Indonesia).\n\n-- I do not know much about Karel Heijting, Dé Kessler and Dolf Kessler. So I excluded them.\n\n-- Dé Kessler and Dolf Kessler were cousins. They were born in Dutch East Indies. Dé's brother Tonny was born in Hague while Dolf's brother Boeli was also born there.\n\n-- Jaïro Riedewald is still too young to be considered.\n\n-- Radja Nainggolan was born in Belgium and capped by Belgium. He is not eligible for this team.\n\n-- Michael Mols' international career was limited by playing at the same generation as Roy Makaay, Pierre van Hooijdonk, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Patrick Kuivert and Ruud Van Nistelrooy. he was a very good player during his prime. Makaay was also limited to 43 caps for Holland.\n\n-- Aron Winter was of Chinese and Indian descent from Suriname. I do not think he is Indonesia.\n\n-- Five members of the 2010 Dutch World Cup team were selected into this team. Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Robin Van Persie, Nigel De Jong, Demy de Zeeuw and John Heitinga were the other four. Giovanni van Bronckhorst served as the captain. Four of them started in the Final against Spain. Demy de Zeeuw was injured during the semifinal.\n\n-- Nobody played on Holland's 1974 and 1978 World Cup team. Simon Tahamata made his national team debut in 1979. Both teams also did not carry a single Surinamese Dutch player. No one also played on the 1988 European Championship winning team.\n\n-- A lot of players played before the Second World War. They were Europeans born in Dutch East Indies.\n\n-- I do not know much about Lother Van Gogh's football career. His father was a full cousin of Vincent Van Gogh.\n\nFormation"
