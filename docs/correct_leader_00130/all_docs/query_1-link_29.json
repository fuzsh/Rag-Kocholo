        "text": "The \"Third Force\" probably extended beyond racist police and army officers who hoped that by fomenting black-on-black violence to \"prove\" that blacks were too violent to be trusted with government, or too incompetent to combat crime and maintain law and order, many South Africans would be persuaded to vote whites back into power.\n\nBut for that proposition to be feasible, blacks themselves who constitute the majority would have to vote for a return to the status quo ante; which was not only unlikely but out of the question.\n\nMost of the blacks who had been victims of the violence instigated by the \"Third Force\" believed that they were caught up in that vicious cycle of killings because white extremists and their black henchmen were behind it to destroy black majority rule.\n\nThe victims included, of course, the people in the village of Magoda near Richmond, a town about 40 miles south of Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal Province where President Mandela attended the funeral.\n\nAnd the destabilisation campaign continued, mainly in subtle and sophisticated ways in the bureaucracy which was still dominated by whites, in the white business community and in the media, to discredit and weaken South Africa's predominantly black government.\n\nYet that was the government which had been tolerant of the very same people who were trying to undermine it, despite some misgivings by some whites about Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and his colleagues and some of the ANC policies which even a number of critics conceded could not be roundly criticised because of the glaring inequalities between blacks and non-blacks. As R.W. Johnson, a white South African and former anti-apartheid activist and director of the Helen Suzman Foundation in Johannesburg, stated in The Wall Stree Journal:\n\n\"Deputy President Thabo Mbeki chairs the cabinet and runs the government; among the hundreds of officials, assistants and advisers who surround him is not a single white face.\n\nMany nonblacks see the pressure for affirmative-action appointments within the state machine and the broader labor market as a sort of reneging on the ANC's pledge of nonracism....(But) in a way this was all predictable....\n\nEven to complain about what is happening can sound churlish, particularly when whites, Asians and mixed-race 'coloreds' enjoy an average standard of living incomparably higher than that of blacks.\n\nIn fact, the black electorate, which the ANC promised 'jobs, jobs, jobs' in the last election campaign, is experiencing an unemployment rate between 25 and 40 percent.\" - (R.W. Johnson, \"South Africa's New Problems,\" in The Wall Street Journal, 19 September 1997, p. A-14).\n\nThe question is how long blacks can wait before they start getting their fair share of the economic pie.\n\nThey can't eat the vote. They know when they are hungry and why their stomachs are empty. They know when they don't have decent or affordable housing. And they know why.\n\nStatistics of economic growth mean absolutely nothing to them when those figures don't translate into concrete benefits for them in their everyday lives. And nothing is going to change without fundamental change.\n\nBut many non-blacks don't want to make sacrifices to help uplift their fellow countrymen, blacks people, who collectively suffer the most - in terms of economic disadvantages - even after the end of apartheid.\n\nMany of them, especially whites, have chosen to leave South Africa instead of staying to help build the country. They should also consider themselves to be very lucky there has been no backlash against them from many blacks in retaliation for the atrocities of apartheid.\n\nYet, it is also a fact that if blacks come down really hard on whites, they are going to speed up the brain drain they want to avoid in order to keep white professionals whom they need to keep their country going.\n\nThere are simply not enough blacks in South Africa who have the necessary skills to run such an industrialised country with a sophisticated economy. They were denied education for too long, and it will be a long time before they catch up with whites, if at all.\n\nAnd that is the only weapon whites have in their hands pointed at blacks and which they have been dangling over their heads. They can use it as a bargaining tool to extract meaningful concessions from the predominantly black government.\n\nIf all skilled whites were to pull out of South Africa today, their departure would have a devastating impact on the country. It would be a catastrophe. The economy, industry, and infrastructure would collapse overnight.\n\nTherefore they have a moral duty to remain in South Africa and help blacks whom they exploited for more than 300 years. But they keep on fleeing mainly because it is unthinkable for many of them to live under a black government. And they started fleeing soon after apartheid ended and have continued to do so through the years. Statistics on white flight even back in the 1990s tell the story:\n\n\"It's apparently not enough for the country's 10 million nonblacks to be told that they should feel lucky....They are disenchanted enough that large numbers are emigrating.\n\nThe figures are difficult to ascertain: Up to 40 per cent of whites have foreign passports and therefore need not formally emigrate. But the South African press estimates that 50,000 to 80,000 whites have left each year since 1994 - a loss perhaps 5 to 6 per cent of the total white population.\n\nFor the moment, the economic effect is somewhat diminished, because many skilled whites and Asians near retirement age are staying on.\n\nBut as they leave the labour market, the full effects of the departure of so many of their younger colleagues will be evident. Since almost all the country's professional and managerial skills are concentrated in the white and Asian populations, one can expect a significant 'deskilling' of the economy. Such wholesale emigration was disastrous even in Mozambique and Angola, primarily agricultural economies.\n\nSouth Africa's first black majority government must set out to make the white and Asian minorities feel more at home. It must ensure that the promise of national reconciliation is kept. And it must seek to reverse the brain drain that threatens the livelihood of all South Africans. That miracle is clearly within reach of this government - if only it would make the effort.\" - (Ibid).\n\nThat miracle is also possible if whites and other non-blacks reciprocate the feelings of the black-majority government whose conciliatory gestures have in many cases been rebuffed by whites.\n\nBlacks have been more forgiving than whites have been repentant, and they have been more patient than whites have been willing to sacrifice in order to close the economic gap between the two races.\n\nIt is whites who are making themselves uncomfortable; a point critics of the black-majority government ignore. Just turn the tables and see how they would feel had they been in the black man's position after being brutalised for centuries by their conquerors.\n\nAlso blacks can not by themselves keep the reconciliation process on track when the vast majority of whites are determined to derail it by contending that any discussion of the atrocities of apartheid - in a bygone era - is a witch hunt against them.\n\nThey should be glad blacks have not tried to do more than that. And there's no guarantee they won't in the future if nothing changes and if the intransigence on the part of whites continues.\n\nAnd blacks can not reverse the brain drain, as skilled whites continue to flee the country, if their former oppressors insist on maintaining white privilege as the price black people have to pay to keep trained whites in the country. Such confrontational tactics are counter-productive for both sides and will only make race relations worse.\n\nOne day, both sides could reach a point where they would be able to say, \"We can do without each other,\" as they bid each other farewell. Pray they don't live to see that day.\n\nAnd it can be avoided, but only if whites reciprocate the conciliatory gestures of the black-majority government and start making meaningful concessions to blacks in order to build a truly just society free of racial inequalities whites want to perpetuate in order to maintain their privileged position at the expense of their fellow countrymen.\n\nSome of the black groups which have been in the forefront of the liberation struggle to end economic apartheid - which still exists almost as much as it did during the era of legally sanctioned apartheid - are labour unions across the country, especially in the cities. And they have have formidable credentials to carry on the struggle.\n\nIt was black workers who were mobilised into a powerful force which brought the apartheid regime down to its knees and forced it to the conference table to start negotiating with its opponents for a transition to majority rule.\n\nIt is true that blacks are making inroads into the economy, a bastion of white power for centuries, without which political power is meaningless. But they still have a long way to go. As Mark Gevisser reported from Johannesburg in his article, \"Ending Economic Apartheid,\" in The Nation:\n\n\"In South African politics and government, blacks now rule, incontrovertibly.\n\nBut despite the fact that blacks are more than 80 percent of South Africa's population, black companies control only 8 percent of the equities on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange - [while] Anglo-American alone controls 24 percent.\" - (Mark Gevisser, \"Ending Economic Apartheid: Is Labor Capitalism Risking the Legacy of South Africa's Liberation Struggle?,\" in The Nation, New York, 29 September 1997, p. 24).\n\nThat was more than 10 years ago. And little has changed.\n\nHowever, there are blacks who complain that such \"economic empowerment\" benefits only the black middle class, to the exclusion of the masses who bore the brunt of the liberation struggle. As Sam Shilowa, the secretary-general of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), stated:\n\n\"Black people are justified when they say that democracy means more than just the right to vote; that it means economic empowerment. But there are those who believe it means self-enrichment of a few.\" - (Sam Shilowa, quoted ibid., p. 25. See also \"South Africa's Powerful Unions: Labour's Weight,\" in The Economist, 27 September 1997, pp. 48 - 49).\n\nStill, black trade unions have the financial - and the political - clout which can enable them to exercise some leverage, and in many cases a lot of leverage, in the economic arena.\n\nCollectively, the retirement funds of black workers amount to billions of dollars which the unions partly control.\n\nThat is a substantial amount of capital which can be harnessed to enable union members to buy shares in different companies and become active participants in the economy, not only as workers but as part-owners as well. Some can even buy shares directly on their own, or their trade unions can collectively buy substantial shares with their retirement funds on their behalf from which they will get returns.\n\nBut that is still not enough to level the playing field in the economic arena. And it is not enough to end racial disparities.\n\nMost blacks - in the general population - will be left out. And labour union members themselves can not expect a significant improvement in their lives simply because they own shares in companies through their membership in trade unions which have invested their retirement funds on their behalf.\n\nImmediate improvement in their economic status will have to come from better jobs and better wages from an economy controlled by whites, the majority of whom are not willing to make major concessions to blacks in those areas.\n\nYet it is white South Africa, because of the apartheid policies it supported, which is responsible for so much poverty and unemployment afflicting black communities. South Africa is the most industrialised country on the entire continent. Unfortunately, a disproportionately large number of blacks can not find jobs in such an economy because they don't have needed skills and the necessary academic training, thanks to years of inferior education for blacks under apartheid and even before then.\n\nAnd you can't take short cuts, just hire anybody or lower standards. Doing so will ruin the economy and the country as a whole.\n\nMany blacks can and do provide unskilled labour. It is cheap, and there is plenty of it. But it is not highly productive in such a sophisticated economy. By contrast, skilled labour is scarce and costly.\n\nTherefore it is the responsibility of white South African business owners and companies - all of whom were the biggest beneficiaries during apartheid - to train black workers in order to make them more competitive and more productive. As productivity increases, the economy grows and creates more jobs, and will in the long run help alleviate the problem of extremely high unemployment among blacks.\n\nAlso to help ease the economic plight among blacks, all whites need to pay a reparations tax to help black people until they catch up with them. That is not asking too much, considering the fact that for more than 300 years, it is whites who have enjoyed preferential treatment at the expense of blacks, while paying them almost nothing for their labour.\n\nIn fact, blacks were enslaved for years. After slavery ended, they continued to work as virtual slaves until the end of apartheid during the early 1990s.\n\nEven after the end of apartheid - no one should expect a miracle overnight but things could move a little faster - the income gap between blacks and whites is astounding. According to The Economist:\n\n\"Black incomes are barely a sixth of white ones.\" - (\"South Africa - How Wrong Is It Going?: South Africa's Breezy Post-Apartheid Self-Confidence Has Crumbled,\" in The Economist, 12 October 1996, p. 23. See also \"After Mandela's Gone,\" ibid., pp. 17 - 18).\n\nThat is just one of the remnants of apartheid. And, in the face of white intransigence, it partly explains why there are those who would settle for nothing less than tit-for-tat.\n\nThere is yet no groundswell for such feelings among blacks, the primary victims of legally sanctioned racism. But it can not be entirely ruled out in the future, depending on the extent to which whites, however grudgingly, are going to meet justified demands by blacks for meaningful concessions from their former oppressors:\n\n\"Not all blacks are as forgiving as Mr. Mandela. Some still seek vengeance for the crimes of apartheid, others merely want to press harder for black advancement.\n\nAnd no wonder: much power, especially in business, the civil service, the press and the universities, remains in white hands. It needs to spread....Whites should be clear that their privileges can not endure.\" - (Ibid., pp. 17, and 18).\n\nIt is this perpetuation of white privilege by the white oligarchy and bureaucracy in multiracial democratic South Africa which has been the main catalyst for \"Africanbond,\" a phenomenon of racial bonding among South African blacks - especially the elite - although in spirit and intent it is entirely different from the virulently racist Afrikaner Broederbond which was formed to perpetuate white supremacy. As reported from Johannesburg in October 1996, not long after apartheid officially ended, by The Economist:\n\n\"It was revealed this month that [some members of the black elite] had got together to hatch an 'Africanbond,' an informal black society that would promote the interests of black brotherhood.\n\nThe aim, declared the minutes of a meeting reported in South Africa's Sunday Times, was to combat 'the growing conspiracy against meaningful black participation in extending and leveraging political democracy to facilitate economic and social democracy.'\n\nThe guest list reads like a Who's Who of South Africa's top black business people, lawyers and media types.\n\nThe idea of an Africanbond sent a frisson through white South Africa. Many seized on the unfortunate choice of name, and its echo of the Afrikaner Broederbond, a secret society that started out as an informal means of promoting Afrikaners in a world dominated by white English-speakers, but ended up as a powerful, manipulative and corrupting network.\" - (\"Bonding of South Africa's Blacks,\" in The Economist, 18 October 1996, p. 50).\n\nIt also ended up being the true embodiment of the soul and spirit of Afrikanerdom and a hotbed of intrigue against blacks.\n\nBy glaring contrast, Africanbond is not intended to be a fountainhead of racist ideas or an instrument of racial oppression to be used against whites or other non-blacks; nor is it a team of black ideologues providing an ideological rationale for some future race war against non-blacks as the Afrikaner Broederbond did against blacks during the apartheid era. It is the antithesis of all that:\n\n\"There is nothing sinister about the Africanbond, insists Peter Vundla, who runs Herdbuoys, an advertising agency, and who was one of the hosts to the gathering: 'It's just a group of people who have been bonded by our collective African experience.'\n\nThe name, he says, was one of several suggested by the group. There are no plans to turn it into a formal organisation, with membership rules, let alone vows and silly handshakes. A nearer parallel would be the Brenthurst group, a loose clan of top white businessmen which from time to time meets members of the government.\n\nWhatever its nature, the Africanbond venture exposes the discontent of the country's black elite. Political liberation has not delivered instant access to other centres of power. Big business, most universities, the best-selling newspapers, remain firmly in white hands....Blacks are frustrated at their relative lack of business and intellectual clout.\n\nA striking example of this was the row last year (1995) when William Makgoba, then deputy vice-chancellor at the University of Witwatersrand, a stronghold of white liberalism, tried to 'Africanise' it....\n\nSome white academics found Mr. Makgoba's tactics more than unpleasant. He was eventually moved to another post.\n\nBlacks were indignant. He was 'the newest victim of the spontaneous white conspiracy against the black intelligentsia,' wroteThami Mazwai, a black writer and Africanbond guest....\n\nMuch of the time, black and white muddle along together, by choice or circumstance. But then comes a sharp reminder of how readily South Africans retreat into the racial laager.\" - (Ibid., pp. 50 - 51).\n\nAs they retreat into that sanctuary assuming a defensive posture, they start to hurl charges and counter-charges, recriminations which, in order to be properly understood, must be looked at in the context of apartheid South Africa which inflicted so much damage on its citizenry. The effects of this destruction continue to reverberate and are felt in every nook and corner of the South African society.\n\nAfter blacks took over, whites right away started complaining about the \"inefficiency\" of the predominantly black government. Black leaders were not surprised to hear that. And, as one former South African, John Chettle, pointed out:\n\n\"[It is true that] there are inevitably parts of the bureaucracy that now work less efficiently than before, although the South African bureaucracy under the previous regime was not famous for its efficiency.\" - (John Chettle, \"After the Miracle: Can South Africa Be A Normal State?,\" in The National Interest, Washington, D.C., Spring 1997, p. 66).\n\nThe apartheid regime was, in fact, inefficient and corrupt. It was also bloated. The only area in which is was highly efficient was in the dispensation of injustice when it functioned as a notoriously repressive apparatus against blacks.\n\nIts inefficiency was compounded by the fact that apartheid South Africa was nothing more than a welfare state for whites at the expense of blacks; nor do whites who complained about bureaucratic inefficiency mention the fact that even with the black-majority government in power, the civil service - hence the bureaucracy - is still mostly white.\n\nThey also complained that the rate of crime soared astronomically after the multiracial democratic government of President Mandela came to power. Yet they did not mention the fact that the police force, which should be fighting crime, was still dominated by whites and was highly corrupt.\n\nIt was also behind much of the crime going on across the country. As Chettle, who for nearly two decades was director of the South Africa Foundation for North and South America before he became an American citizen, stated in The National Interest:\n\n\"The Financial Times of London pointed to crime as the most significant factor inflicting damage on international views of the country. An average of 52 people were murdered each day in South Africa in 1995, proportionately nine times higher than in the United States (according to the South African newspaper, The Citizen, 18 April 1996).\n\nIn 1995, according to the corporate-sponsored Project on Crime, Violence and Investment, there were 97,950 car thefts. That is equivalent to nearly 47 percent of total sales in the year.\n\nWhen one links that to the evidence that police are organising car thefts, that many of the stolen cars are exported, and that 30 percent of all goods landed at Durban's port are disappearing, it suggests very extensive corruption among the police, customs, harbor authority, and other officials.\" - (Ibid., pp. 66 - 67. See also Tony Leon, \"Fumbling the Crime Issue,\" in the Sunday Times, South Africa, 10 December 1995; The Citizen, Johannesburg, South Africa, 18 April 1996; Edward Osborn: \"It's a devilish paradox, but crime is good for the economy; it's sustaining consumer spending,\" in the Sunday Independent, South Africa, 29 September 1996; The Mail & Guardian, South Africa, 4 October 1996).\n\nWho was behind all that? Black people? Who controlled the police? Who controlled the port in Durban even after the end of apartheid? Blacks?\n\nIt was the white-dominated police force which allowed all that to go on - because it was a part of the problem itself, and not a part of the solution - and then blamed the nation's black leaders for the mess, in order to discredit them after they assumed power when apartheid ended.\n\nIt wasn't just the police force. Even the customs officials and harbour authorities were mostly white. They were also the ones, in collusion with the white-dominated police force, who were behind the export of stolen cars and the disappearance of large amounts of goods landing at South African ports; not just Durban but also Cape Town, East London, Port Elizabeth and others.\n\nYet the black-majority government was blamed for all that. What was it supposed to do? Fire all those whites and then incur the wrath of the entire international community for being a black racist government?\n\nWhy didn't the white authorities themselves straighten out? They were corrupt. But they didn't want to straighten out and clean up the mess they caused because, besides lining their pockets by allowing rampant corruption to go on, they also had a hidden agenda, but which was not always hidden. And that was to make black leaders look bad and destabilise the black-majority government.\n\nThe black-majority government, hence the black community, is also blamed for white flight which is leading to the loss of much-needed professionals practically in all fields except politics. Yet, besides the refusal by many whites to live under black rule, much of that flight is not due to affirmative action policies opening up opportunities for blacks - although that also is a factor - but mainly due to the spiraling rate of crime the white-dominated police force allowed to spin out of control soon after the end of apartheid; again, as part of a hidden agenda - on behalf of the white community angry at the end of white minority rule - to ruin the country, and then blame blacks for it once everything deteriorates due to the loss of trained professionals most of whom are white.\n\nThere already about 500 major crime syndicates operating in South Africa with international ties round the globe, using the country, among several other criminal operations, as a transit point for drugs from Asia and Latin America going to Europe, North America and other parts of the world. These syndicates are not controlled by black people in South Africa.\n\nThey have strong ties to the South African business community, which is overwhelmingly white; to the banks laundering money for them, which are also controlled by whites; and to the police and customs officials who are also mostly white.\n\nNo small-time operator is going to export stolen cars or steal tons of goods landing at Durban and other South African ports:\n\n\"This is not the work merely of young, nervous, trigger-happy gunmen who confront the motorist. It may be the most serious remnant of the moral corruption of apartheid and, if it is not defeated soon, the consequences could be profound.\n\nIt contributes to what one political scientist called 'the negative halo effect.' It strengthens the notion that South Africa is fast becoming just another lawless (black-ruled) African state. It fosters the impression of government incompetence (by blacks).\n\nIt may be the biggest single reason for the exodus - still not statistically significant, but potentially so - of young professionals whose are not easily replaceable.\n\nIt is not surprising, then, to find these factors - crime and consequent emigration - cited by Anton Rupert, chairman of the worldwide Rembrandt Group, as the greatest threats facing the country.\" - (J. Chettle, ibid., p. 67; Sunday Independent, 29 September 1996).\n\nLike the slow pace of change in bridging the economic gap between blacks and whites which may radicalise a significant number of blacks, especially among the masses on the lowest rung of the economic ladder, and turn them against whites because of the latter's refusal to make meaningful concessions to the black majority for the sake of racial equality; white flight may also increasingly turn blacks against whites if the economy continues to deteriorate due to loss of skilled manpower as white professionals continue to emigrate in increasing numbers, in search of better life elsewhere, especially in predominantly white countries.\n\nAnd in both cases, the fault rests squarely on the shoulders of white South Africans: in the former, because of their intransigence - insisting on maintaining white privilege; and in the latter, because of the unwillingness by the white-dominated police and security forces to combat crime which - more than anything else including affirmative action for blacks - is forcing tens of thousands of whites to flee South Africa every year and settle in other countries, especially in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. According to The Economist:\n\n\"The emigration of skilled South Africans is hobbling the economy. A way to staunch the outflow would be to tackle the crime that drives whites out....\n\nThe falling rand and job-preferment for blacks are said to be minor annoyances compared with crime. A recent survey by FSA/Contact, a market-research group, revealed that 96 per cent of South African emigrants cited fear of criminal violence as a reason for packing their bags. They are fleeing, they say, because they want to live somewhere where speeding through red lights at night is not safer than stopping....\n\nThis is thought to be the main reason why every middle-class South African has friends who have left....\n\nAccording to the Central Statistical Service (CSS) in Pretoria, nearly 39,000 South Africans emigrated between 1994 and 1997. The true total is certainly higher....\n\nSince most emigrants are white, some less thoughtful South Africans bid them good riddance, imagining that every departing Caucasian leaves a vacancy for a formerly oppressed black.\n\nBut the government sees the haemorrhage of talent as hurting the economy....Almost all emigrants are managers, technicians or professionals and their families....\n\nAccording to FSA/Contact, 11 per cent of the top managers and 6 per cent of the middle managers who resigned last year (in 1997) did so in order to emigrate.\" - (\"White Flight from South Africa: White South Africa on the Wing - The Emigration of Skilled South Africans is Hobbling the Economy,\" in The Economist, 6 June 1998, p. 43).\n\nAnd the trend has continued through the years, unabated.\n\nThe problem of white flight also has multiplier effect, compounding the negative perception of South Africa, and the negative impact of the brain drain on the black population, especially for those in the cities who depend on jobs provided by whites.\n\nThe economy suffers, of course, from the impact of white flight. But in addition to that, several jobs are also lost when just one professional emigrates - with devastating impact on black families who depend on him for a living:\n\n\"Since South African bosses tend to be responsible for large numbers of staff - even electricians have assistants to pass them their screwdrivers and maids to iron their socks - each lost brain swells the unemployment rate, already a teriffying 30 per cent or so....\n\nMr. Mandela's regular pleas for whites to remain, and coercive policies, such as a proposal by the health minister, Dr. Nkosazana Zuma (one of the few women in the cabinet), that doctors should have to repay the government for their medical training if they refuse to work in South Africa, may stem the tide a little. A more permanent solution would be to cut violent crime. That will not be easy.\n\nAlongside Brazil, South Africa has the world's widest gap between rich and poor, meaning that there is a lot of stuff to steal and a lot of people for whom stealing is the most lucrative career option....\n\nFew criminals are caught or convicted, and few potential gangsters are deterred.\n\nMark Shaw of the Institute for Security Studies in Johannesburg argues that it will be years before crime begins to decline.\" - (Ibid., pp. 43 - 44).\n\nAll that helps to serve racist purposes: the higher the crime rate, and the longer it takes to stem the tide, the better for the exponents of white supremacy.\n\nWhites may have failed to maintain apartheid even after putting up stiff resistance against their opponents, but many of them seem to be equally determined to undermine the predominantly black government in retaliation.\n\nOne way of doing that is by letting crime get out of control, as the white-dominated police and security forces look the other way while they participate in criminal activities themselves, thus perpetuating the vicious cycle of violence.\n\nIt is a sophisticated destabilisation campaign by racists, blaming the wave of crime on blacks, which is intended not only to undermine the black-majority government but also to exonerate whites of any responsibility should South Africa degenerate into chaos, or if its economy fails to create enough jobs - especially for blacks - due to lack of foreign investments scared away by the spiraling rate of crime and white flight.\n\nBut in spite of white flight, South Africa continues - and probably will continue - to attract large numbers of foreign investors because of its relatively strong economy (the most developed and the strongest in Africa), trained work force, and free-market policies even the formerly socialist-oriented African National Congress (ANC) embraced when it came to power in 1994.\n\nIt was a radical change, for, this is the same party whose main leaders had been spouting socialist rhetoric through the years during the struggle against apartheid and promised to implement socialist policies once in power; only to be sobered by harsh economic realities when they went into office, especially after the collapse of communism following the disintegration of the Soviet Union and some of her satellites in the early 1990s.\n\nAnd after the collapse of communism, any rationale for socialism the African National Congress used, could not be sustained in the face of such catastrophic failure; even in Africa itself, socialism had proved to be a tragic failure in all the countries where it had been instituted, including my home country, Tanzania.\n\nThe end of communism did, of course, also deprive the National Party - which introduced apartheid - of its \"unassailable\" logic in defence of its hegemonic rule over South Africa, contending that it was a bulwark against communist onslaught into Africa and a protector of sea lanes round the tip of southern Africa which were vital to the survival of the West, with ships carrying oil and other vital supplies to Western Europe and North America.\n\nSo, the struggle between the supporters of the National Party, hence white-minority rule, and of the African National Congress could not be internationalised anymore in the new world order, and became localised after the latter became the legitimate government of South Africa. And it continues today as some whites try to sabotage the multiracial democratic government, although after more than ten years since the end of apartheid, some of the opponents of racial equality and black-majority rule have given up and virtually conceded defeat.\n\nThe economic arena is now the biggest theatre of combat between the two contending forces and will continue to be one probably for many years to come until whites sacrifice their privileged position for the sake of racial equality and national unity, and until blacks get their share of the economic pie. Statistics of the plight of the black masses are disturbing. They include figures compiled by the World Bank:\n\n\"The real long-term threat to South African economic policy (and race relations) arises more from certain structural problems in the economy....They center on poverty, productivity, and education. The worst problem is poverty.\n\nAmong comparable middle-income developing countries, South Africa has one of the worst records in terms of health, education, safe water, fertility, and income inequality.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, unemployment rates stand at 50 per cent among the poor. The lowest 40 per cent of households (almost all black), equivalent to 53 per cent of the population, account for less than 10 per cent of total consumption.\" - (J. Chettle, \"After the Miracle: Can South Africa Be a Normal State?,\" op. cit., p. 69. See also The Citizen, Johannesburg, 18 September 1996; Business Day, Johannesburg, 17 September 1996).\n\nSouth Africa's future stability will very much depend on how successful the predominantly black government is in solving problems of unemployment and in reducing poverty among blacks who constitute the vast majority of the population. But neither of these can be solved without cooperation from whites who control the economy.\n\nTherefore, however realistic and sound economic policies formulated by the government may be, they can not be successfully implemented unless whites make substantial sacrifices and give up the privileges they continue to enjoy at the expense of their fellow countrymen, and also at the expense of domestic tranquility.\n\nThe privileged position of whites, thanks to centuries of exploitation of the black masses, is clearly demonstrated by appalling statistics. As Antoinette Handley, director of studies at the South African Institute of International Affairs in Johannesburg, and Jeffrey Herbst, an associate professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University in the United States, stated in their article, \"South Africa: The Perils of Normalcy,\" in Current History: A Journal of Contemporary World Affairs:\n\n\"The new government inherited an extraordinary set of economic problems in 1994. Fifty-three percent of Africans live below the poverty line, compared to 2 per cent of all whites....\n\nEspecially in urban areas, poor black populations, often without adequate food, water, and shelter, coexist with a white society whose lifestyle is modeled on Europe and the United States.\" - (Antoinette Handley and Jeffrey Herbst, \"South Africa: The Perils of Normalcy,\" in Current History: A Journal of Contemporary World Affairs, May 1997, pp. 224, and 226).\n\nThose problems can not be solved overnight. But speed is critical. The pace of change will also be partly determined by the commitment of the black leaders themselves, combined with sacrifices made by - and concessions extracted from - whites.\n\nThis unconscionable economic gap not only exacerbates racial tensions but also fuels crime. As Nelson Mandela stated shortly before the transition from white minority rule to the new dispensation:\n\n\"The youths in the (black) townships have had over the decades a visible enemy, the (white) government. Now that the enemy is no longer visible, because of the transformation that is taking place.\n\nTheir enemy now is you and me, people who drive a car and have a house. It's order, anything that relates to order, and it is a very grave situation. \"- (Nelson Mandela, quoted ibid., p. 226).\n\nThe problem can be solved only through expanded economic opportunities, especially in the private sector, in order to not only fight unemployment but also raise living standards of black people who constitute a disproportionately high percentage of the poor and the unemployed in South Africa.\n\nThe question is how. As R. Stephen Brent, an officer in the US Agency for International Development (USAID) mission in Pretoria, South Africa, stated in Foreign Affairs:\n\n\"To make real progress in raising black living standards, South Africa needs higher growth, at least five percent a year, and it must be more employment-intensive.\n\nTo achieve this the new government will have to address South Africa's structural weaknesses and expand foreign investment and trade....\n\nIt wants to spend more on black social needs, but taxes and government spending are already high. It wants to create jobs for black South Africans, but it cannot hire more civil servants (the civil service is still dominated by whites) or force the private sector to make labor-intensive investments\". - (R. Stephen Brent, \"South Africa: Tough Road to Prosperity,\" in Foreign Affairs, March/April 1996, p. 116).\n\nAnd it can not concentrate exclusively on promoting economic growth and expanding the private sector at the expense of social services. Otherwise the government is going to alienate its supporters and help erode its political base anchored in the black constituency.\n\nTo maintain its legitimacy, it must provide more social services for blacks - health care, education, housing, clean water, electricity, transport; pursue affirmative action policies; and introduce changes in the economy in order to create more employment opportunities and increase black ownership.\n\nAll those goals must be pursued at the same time, and must also, of necessity, entail elimination of white privilege. But such erosion of white privilege, especially if it is done precipitately, will only lead to increased white flight, hence rapid deterioration of the economy.\n\nTherefore black demands for social equity, which are legitimate demands, must be tempered with realism in a world in which harsh economic realities rarely conform to people's aspirations.\n\nBlacks shouldn't expect miracles overnight - and they don't. And whites shouldn't insist on maintaining their privileged position they acquired at the expense of blacks. They should also remember that their country needs them as much as it needs blacks. And the government can not remove all whites from their jobs just to replace them with blacks. As Public Services Minister Zola Skweyiya bluntly stated:\n\n\"I had to tell them, 'We need your skills.'\n\nIn deciding who goes and who remains, the interests of the state must prevail....\n\nWhites have got skills, and we need those skills to run South Africa.\" - Zola Skweyiya, quoted by Lynne Duke, \"Affirmative Action, South African Style: With Skilled White Workers Still in Demand, the Black Majority Government Moves Carefully,\" in The Washington Post, National Weekly Edition, 22 July 1996, p. 18).\n\nThat is just one of the legacies of apartheid.\n\nAlthough apartheid has ended as a legal monstrosity, its dead policies continue to haunt and have a devastating impact on the living by keeping whites on top for many years to come, with dire consequences of a backlash from some blacks. And it is impossible to undo the damage that has been inflicted on blacks for centuries by an oppressive white minority. As Lynne Duke, reporting from Pretoria, South Africa, stated in The Washington Post:\n\n\"Apartheid's legacy is devastating: Adult blacks today have had half the educational years of whites; their salaries are barely a third of whites' salaries; and their unemployment rate is eight times higher.\n\nAlthough blacks run the nation's government, white still run the economy; whites are 13 percent of the population, but own 90 percent of the nation's wealth, according to government statistics.\" - (Lynne Duke, \"Affirmative Action, South African Style,\" ibid. See also \"South Africa's Wealth Gap: Even Less Equal in South Africa,\" in The Economist, 25 October 1997, p. 46).\n\nAnd because whites still control most of the jobs in both the private and public sectors, racial discrimination against blacks remains a major problem, in spite of the fact that blacks control the government , as exemplified by this case:\n\n\"Khosi Jiyane, 27, a black woman with a master's degree in business from one of South Africa's premier universities, was told by her bosses at an insurance firm that her ambition and assertiveness made her a threat to her white co-workers.\n\nNow a human resources consultant with a black-advancement firm called Bridging the Gap, Jiyane resigned from the insurance firm earlier this year (in 1996) after she was denied several promotions and her job as a junior personnel officer turned out to be unchallenging. 'What I ended up doing was some secretarial job, taking minutes,' Jiyane said bitterly.\" - (Khosi Jiyane, cited by Lynne Duke, ibid).\n\nMany qualified blacks have encountered open hostility and resentment from their white employers and co-workers, now that the end of apartheid has opened up opportunities for them in areas they would not even have dared to enter during the era of white-minority rule.\n\nThe demand for qualified blacks is great, nonetheless, but even more so for highly qualified black executives and managers. However, there has been little progress in the corporate area. Blacks hold only about 10 per cent of the management positions in the private sector. And that is considered to be an improvement.\n\nMany blacks say the government should set numerical goals to promote black advancement in the private sector and other areas. As Hazel Ralefeta, managing director of the Black Management Forum, an advancement advocacy group, stated:\n\n\"We believe the government should have come out much clearer with targets. If you do not set targets, how do you measure?\" - (Hazel Ralefeta, ibid).\n\nAnd in spite of the need to retain skilled whites in their positions, it is simply a matter of time before blacks become the dominant group in the educated labour force, including management. As cabinet member Zola Skweyiya put it, considering the nation's demographics, whites will be ultimately swamped:\n\n\"You can not run away from that.\" - (Zola Skweyiya, ibid).\n\nAnd as Thabo Mbeki, who was then deputy president under Nelson Mandela, also stated:\n\n\"If, in time, the majority of the black population sees that no change has occurred, one must expect that people will rebel.\" - (Thabo Mbeki, quoted in \"South Africa: The End of a Miracle?,\" in The Economist, 13 December 1997, p. 18).\n\nBut there is also the danger that the advancement of the black elite, especially their rapid accumulation of wealth, will alienate the black masses from them, the very same people who are supposed to end white bureaucratic control and domination of the economy and help open up more opportunities for blacks in general.\n\nYet at the same time, the logic behind such progress for the black elite has universal appeal even among the deprived black masses because it is a continuation of the black liberation struggle blacks of all classes supported. As Nthato Motlana, Nelson Mandela's former family doctor, bitterly remarked:\n\n\"They say it's good for a white man to be rich, but it's not good for a black man. If you're black and you succeed, there's something wrong.\" - (Nthato Motlana, quoted in \"South Africa: Black Can Be Rich: Black Capitalists in South Africa,\" in The Economist, 15 March 1997, p. 44).\n\nIn addition to being the product of apartheid which favoured whites, the wealth accumulated by whites is further augmented by additional income from criminal syndicates all of which are controlled and dominated by whites.\n\nMbeki explicitly stated that this criminal enterprise is part of a well-orchestrated attempt to undermine the black-majority government. According to The Economist:\n\n\"The police last year (in 1996) knew of 481 criminal syndicates involved in smuggling drugs, guns, diamonds, rhino horn or luxury cars....\n\nWorse still, some of these criminals work with ex-members (and current members) of South Africa's security forces, whose connections can still secure false papers and get police dockets destroyed.\n\nMr. Mbeki believes that some of them may even have a political motive: 'I wouldn't rule out a more orchestrated attempt to undermine the government by organised crime,' he says.\" - (\"South Africa: The End of a Miracle?,\" op. cit., p. 18).\n\nSome people, probably a significant number of whites, may interpret that as an overreaction or may be even as an attack on whites. Yet there is reason for such concern as expressed by Mbeki; for, there are still whites who would like to see the government fail and they will do anything they can to undermine it. Far from being anti-white, Mbeki is guided not only by pragmatic instincts, but by a genuine desire for racial equality.\n\nBut he also knows that it is impossible to achieve that goal by maintaining the status quo and without eliminating white privilege. And that explains why he was viewed with apprehension, and trepidation, by some whites when he was vice president and when he became president:\n\n\"Mbeki is content. Whites wonder....Unlike Mr. Mandela, he is less occupied with racial reconciliation than with racial transformation of South Africa's still-white institutions....White South Africans have some reason to fear that the world will not be quite so comfortable or familiar to them when Nelson Mandela is gone....A recent poll showed that only 6 per cent of whites wanted Mr. Mbeki to succeed him.\" - (\"Who Would Run South Africa?: Health of the Nation,\" in The Economist 9 March 1996, p. 41; \"Mandela and Mbeki: South Africa - The Old Chief and the New One,\" in The Economist, 5 April 1997, p. 43.\n\nSo it was with apprehension that many white South Africans entered a new era under Mbeki's residency. Yet little changed in terms of their privileged status contrasted with the predicament of the black masses who had suffered so much under apartheid when whites enjoyed a high standard of living, one of the highest in the world, as they still do today.\n\nAnd it is clear that much as people may talk about racial reconciliation in the context of South Africa, they must also come to grips with some harsh realities about the racial disparities which make such reconciliation virtually impossible. It is impossible to have racial reconciliation without racial and institutional transformation to rebuild a new society from the ashes of apartheid.\n\nWhites were worried about Mbeki's presidency, not because he was going to punish them for the sins of apartheid; they were worried because they did not want to make sacrifices to bring about fundamental change in the country, a change that would entail structural transformation of a structurally flawed society.\n\nTherefore apprehension about the future for whites under his presidency was clearly evident. And it was an assessment that came from more than one source. According to a report from Johannesburg in The Washington Post:\n\n\"The notion of a Mbeki presidency is disquieting for some.\n\nDespite a bold and poetic speech he delivered in May (1996) in which he welcomed whites as Africans along with blacks, the white-run media and other observers view him as less committed to racial reconciliation than Mandela.\n\nTom Lodge a political scientist at Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand, notes that Mbeki does not have any close white advisers. Rucky Naidoo (an Indian and), a Mbeki spokesman, counters that Mbeki has frequent contact with white businessmen here and abroad.\n\nThere also is concern over Mbeki's push to transform the white-dominated business and media sectors.\n\nHis special adviser, the Reverend Frank Chikane, says Mbeki really is 'an analytic and strategic thinker' and that his long-term strategy for transforming the country will naturally step on the toes of those not yet accustomed to black-majority rule.\" - (\"South Africa Prepares for Life After the Messiah: Nelson Mandela's Designated Successor is Already Getting Ready for the Transition,\" in The Washington Post, National Weekly Edition, 28 October 1996, p. 18).\n\nMbeki had on more than one occasion been asked whether or not he was satisfied with the pace of change in post-apartheid South Africa. His response was that transformation was going to take time, and it must be done. In one of his most definitive responses, he told The Economist:\n\n\"The reality is that the legacy of apartheid still defines present-day South Africa....The white population I don't think has quite understood the importance of this challenge....\n\nIf you were speaking of national reconciliation based on the maintenance of the status quo, because you did not want to move at a pace that frightens the whites, it means you wouldn't carry out the task of transformation.\n\nYou would not produce reconciliation on that basis.\n\nIt might look so to the people who benefited from apartheid - everybody's forgiven us, nobody's after nationalising our swimming pools. It isn't, because you have the anger that would be boiling among the black people. So, you've got to transform the society.\" - (Thabo Mbeki, quoted in \"White South Africa Awaits Mbeki: Who is Thabo Mbeki?,\" in The Economist, 1 November 1997, p. 45).\n\nIn short, Mbeki was seen as a nemesis for whites, a leader who was going to give them a harder time than they have had, if at all, since the end of legal apartheid.\n\nIt's not that he was going to nationalise their property or the country's large assets such as land and mines and industry, or raise taxes; he was going to use the government, and its power, to open up opportunities for blacks across the spectrum including the upper echelons of society. As he explained his policy of affirmative action:\n\n\"Affirmative action isn't a philosophy, it's not an end in itself. It's an instrument to get a more equal society, broadly representative of South African demography. \"- (Ibid).\n\nHis message was simple and direct, even if it scared whites. But he was just as firm in pursuing privatisation and other free-market policies to promote economic growth in which whites were expected to play a critical role since they controlled the economy. And he became business-friendly during his tenure as president to a degree many people did not expect.\n\nIn fact, many people in the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and elsewhere said, besides being somewhat aloof and lacking the common touch Mandela and other leaders including Jacob Zuma had, he was too business-friendly and they wanted the government to do more for the poor. Yet he was also determined to bring about fundamental change:\n\n\"He insists that whatever the pressure to go soft on economic management, some aspects, such as the pledge to cut the budget deficit, are 'set in stone.'\n\nNo less firm is his message to South Africa's whites, who still hold most of the country's economic power: if they do not change things voluntarily, he will not hesitate to force them to do so.\" - (\"White South Africa Awaits Mbeki,\" ibid).\n\nAnd most of them don't want to change voluntarily. They insist on maintaining white privilege, although they obtained those benefits with the help of a regime which brutalised and exploited blacks.\n\nThey would not have been able to acquire those benefits had it not been for the racist policies they themselves supported by deliberately keeping in power racist leaders whom they continued to support, and vote for, election after election.\n\nIn fact, many whites, if not most including the country's leading businessmen, contend that they never benefited from apartheid. Whom it benefit, instead? Its victims? According to The Wall Street Journal in its report from Johannesburg:\n\n\"During the years of apartheid, many companies grew rich and powerful. But rather than beg for forgiveness or apologize for any wrongdoings, most South African businessmen argued that the economic abuses of South Africa's past weren't their fault....\n\n(In) three days of hearings before the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission,...former bankers, heads of mining groups and an ex-chairman of the South African Chamber of Commerce all denied that business supported or benefited from the system of racial segregation and white minority rule known as apartheid.\" - (Robert Block, \"South Africa's Corporate Elite Says It Didn't Prop Up Apartheid,\" in The Wall Street Journal, 12 November 1997, p. A-18).\n\nIt is such denial and racist attitudes which make racial reconciliation very difficult to achieve, convincing many blacks that whites in South Africa - with the exception of a few - are not sorry for what they did to them during all those years of white-minority rule.\n\nThe result is racial polarisation, at best, paving the way for a populist rebellion and may be even a radical black government in the future which will end white privilege in one swoop even if it means scaring the majority of the whites out of the country.\n\nA number of black leaders in South Africa, and many ordinary black citizens, have looked across the border and have seen what President Robert Mugabe has done to end white privilege in Zimbabwe - through his fast-track land reform programme - and feel that is the right way to go, whatever the cost.\n\nDuring their testimony before the Truth Commission, only Eskom, the state-owned electric company, apologised unconditionally to black South Africans for \"entertaining and perpetuating apartheid.\" Eskom executive Willem Koch told the Commission on 11 November 1997 that his company did not conduct itself as a good corporate citizen and did little, if anything, to alleviate the plight of black people.\n\nHe was quoted by The Wall Street Journal in a report just cited above. And as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chairman of the Truth Commission, said about the 55 submissions from companies and business groups which remained adamant in their refusal to apologise and in their position on apartheid:\n\n\"No one today admits supporting apartheid.\"\n\nHe was also quoted in the same report by The Wall Street Journal when the hearings were going on before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in November 1997.\n\nIn its testimony, the Confederation of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), the biggest and most powerful labour organisation in the country, said business couldn't be trusted to fully disclose its role in suppressing black labour unions, in paying black workers starvation wages, in employing child labour on white farms, and in making use of prison labour on public works and white-owned businesses and farms.\n\nHowever, during the same hearings, there was another voice of reason from the white side besides the apologetic testimony by Eskom executive Willem Koch. It came from an economics professor at the leading Afrikaner institution of higher learning, Stellenbosch University, who proposed paying some form of reparations to blacks:\n\n\"Sampie Terreblanche, an economist at Stellenbosch University, proposed a restitution tax imposed on wealth accumulated under apartheid.\n\nEveryone with net assets of more than two million rand - $414,200 - could be taxed an additional 0.5 percentage point annually over 10 or 20 years, he told the hearing, to achieve what Dr. Terreblanche termed 'systemic justice and social stability' for the majority of South Africans.\n\nBusinessmen rejected the tax proposal.\" - (Sampie Terreblanche, cited by Robert Block in The Wall Street Journal, ibid).\n\nBy rejecting the tax proposal for reparations, South Africa's corporate elite were emphatically stating that they did nothing wrong to blacks during apartheid.\n\nSome did not even believe that apartheid was wrong, a sentiment forcefully articulated in public by the hawkish and finger-wagging former president and one of the last two leaders of the apartheid regime, P.W. Botha, who bluntly stated: \"We did nothing wrong.\" Therefore there was nothing to apologise for. And as Philip Krawitz, the former chairman of the South African Chamber of Business, told the Truth Commission:\n\n\"I believe it is not factually correct to assign guilt on a collective basis to business in South Africa.\n\nIndeed, there were individual businesses who did prosper under apartheid, who did exploit the system, who were cozy with the government. But we who were in the South African Chamber of Business and its forerunners....we stood resolutely against apartheid for many decades.\" - (Philip Krawitz, quoted ibid).\n\nIf the members of the South African Chamber of Business \"stood resolutely against apartheid for many decades,\" as Philip Krawitz contended, why did they continue to pay their black employees starvation wages? Why didn't they do something to help improve living conditions of their black employees and other blacks mired in poverty in the townships?\n\nWhy didn't they work with the South African Council of Churches and other groups opposed to apartheid to fight against racial injustice?\n\nThey never did any of that.\n\nHow is it that, at least some of them, never implemented the Sullivan principles to desegregate their businesses? Only some foreign companies doing business in South Africa did that; South African businesses didn't, they remained segregated and underpaid their black workers.\n\nWhy didn't they help to internationalise the struggle against the diabolical regime by working with anti-apartheid groups in other countries and by making financial contributions towards relief funds for apartheid victims?\n\nThey did nothing of the sort.\n\nWhy didn't they, as the linchpin of the South African economy, bring pressure to bear upon the white-minority regime to abandon its racist policies?\n\nThey never did.\n\nKrawitz simply did not tell the truth.\n\nHis argument contradicts what some South African business tycoons conceded, although they denied propping up apartheid.\n\nMining executives admitted that exploiting racial and tribal divisions helped cut labour costs. Afrikaner executives admitted that the Afrikaner-dominated apartheid regime helped them get contracts - in what amounted to an act of ethnic solidarity.\n\nThey were all solidly behind the white racist government even until the late 1980s when the edifice of apartheid began to crack under mounting international pressure from economic sanctions. As Donald G. McNeil stated in a report from Johannesburg in The New York Times:\n\n\"Many companies helped the government evade trade sanctions, thwart the oil embargo and the United Nations arms embargo so effectively that the country built a powerful arms industry and even nuclear weapons.\" - (Donald G. McNeal, Jr., \"Tycoons Voice Their Remorse for Profiting from Apartheid,\" in The New York Times, 14 November 1997, p. A-10).\n\nOne of the most blatant denials came from Armscor, the government-owned armaments industry.\n\nAlthough it supplied weapons to the police and the army, it still maintained that it never committed human rights violations and never even imagined that the weapons it made would be used against fellow South Africans.\n\nWhat is even harder to imagine is where the South African police in particular could have used the weapons besides South Africa itself.\n\nAnd to say that the South African police, using weapons supplied by Armscor, did not commit human rights violations is to stretch the imagination. The claim lacks credibility and stretches credulity.\n\nThey did it on regular basis, especially against blacks, and Armscor executives knew that. Yet, they kept on arming the nation's racist and repressive security forces. Even South African solders, armed by Armscor, attacked black townships within South Africa in addition to launching raids into neighbouring countries to kill anti-apartheid opponents directly on orders from President P.W. Botha himself, the Great Crocodile.\n\nArmscor executives were aware of all that and other human rights violations by the apartheid regime despite their professions to the contrary.\n\nAs white businesses - the biggest beneficiaries of South Africa's racist policies - continue to deny their role in propping up apartheid; and as the vast majority of whites, at least in the context of white electoral politics during the era of white minority rule, also continue to deny having played the most critical role in legitimising this abominable institution by electing racist leaders who openly enunciated and defended racist policies; the reaction from the other side, especially from blacks, is one of anger and disbelief, frustration and despair, at the refusal by whites to tell the truth about the atrocities perpetrated by one of the most racist and most oppressive regimes in modern times.\n\nBut the more whites continue to deny all that and try to undermine the black-majority government, the more militant blacks become.\n\nEven segments of the moderate wing of the African National Congress (ANC) may become increasingly radicalised, although not quite like the populist Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC).\n\nBut there is, nonetheless, a discernable trend in that direction even if it's for purposes of forestalling a populist rebellion by adopting measures strong enough to placate feelings among blacks who are becoming increasingly impatient at the slow pace of change, especially in the economic arena where they still have been locked out because of the intransigence of the white minority who still control the economy.\n\nAnd that was clearly the sentiment at the conference of the African National Congress at Polokwane when Jacob Zuma was overwhelmingly elected as the leader of the ruling party on 18th December 2007. It was the party's 60th congress.\n\nHis supporters never doubted that he had the popular touch, contrasted with President Thabo Mbeki who was seen as rather aloof. According to a report by BBC Africa, “Zuma: South Africa's Comeback Kid”:\n\n“'He is a man who listens; he doesn't take the approach of an intellectual king,' said one unnamed supporter, in an apparent swipe at Mr Mbeki....\n\nThroughout his political career, Mr Zuma has championed the rights of ordinary people.\n\nHis supporters believe the man they call JZ will redistribute South Africa's wealth in favour of the poor.\n\nThey say Mr Mbeki has been too business-friendly and presided over 'jobless growth.'\"\n\nThe ruling African National Congress (ANC) does not want to be left behind by its own supporters who may become increasingly radical in their quest for fundamental structural changes in society in order to achieve economic equality.\n\nThat was clearly the position of the ANC even back in the 1990s at its 50th caucus held in the small town of Mafikeng near the border with Botswana in December 1997. As Kurt Shillinger reported from South Africa in The Boston Globe:\n\n\"After more than three years of rhetoric about reconciliation, black leaders voice increasing intolerance toward begrudged whites, who in turn feel increasingly alienated under majority rule.\n\nThe working class, mired in static living conditions, feels forsaken.\" - (Kurt Shillinger, “ANC Convenes 50th Caucus, Readying Torch to be Passed: Mandela Takes Party to Point of a New Era,” in The Boston Globe, December 16, 1997, p. A-12).\n\nCritics said the ANC was more concerned about fiscal health than housing the poor and providing them with other services such as clean water, medical care, and electricity. And that was a very strong message the leadership could not ignore if the ANC was to stay in power well into the 21st century.\n\nAnd it is the same message today. As Steven Friedman, director of the Centre for Policy Studies in Johannesburg, stated:\n\n\"There is a sense among the grassroots that the government is not being responsible or accountable. That alienation is based on legitimate expectations of how government is supposed to work.\" - Steven Friedman, quoted, ibid).\n\nThe constant theme trumpeted by the militant wing of the ANC which may radicalise the ruling party is not only that the government is not fulfilling its promises to address the needs of the impoverished majority, but also that it is too lenient towards whites who are just as equally determined not to give up their privileges or share control of the economy with blacks.\n\nWinnie Madikizela-Mandela, former wife of Nelson Mandela and a stubborn populist, was the most forceful exponent of this collective sentiment of the downtrodden masses and remained one through the years. As Sipho Maseko, a black political scientist at the University of the Western Cape, stated:\n\n\"A majority need someone like Winnie Mandela to articulate their complaints.\" - (Sipho Maseko, ibid.).\n\nIn fact, that is what President Mandela himself did in his farewell speech as leader of the African National Congress at the ANC's 50th caucus in Mafikeng on 16th December 1997.\n\nHis speech will be remembered for its strident tone as much as for its potent message and was undoubtedly one of the most militant he had ever given since he came out of prison and assumed stewardship of the nation.\n\nHe accused apartheid-era leaders of waging a clandestine campaign to destabilise South Africa's multiracial government. “The leopard has not changed its spots,” Mandela said of the National Party, which instituted apartheid and still represented the Afrikaner minority of Dutch-French-German-descended white settlers and other whites as well as Coloureds and Indians. He went on to say:\n\n\"These elements find it difficult to redefine their role in the setting of nonracial democracy. They continue to be imprisoned by notions of white supremacy. - (Nelson Mandela, quoted in \"'A Militant Mandela Leaves ANC: While Remaining President, He Relinquishes Party Role,'\" in the International Herald Tribune, December 17, 1997, p. 6).\n\nMandela warned the African National Congress that some whites wanted to maintain vestiges of apartheid to protect their privileges of the past.\n\nHe went on to say that those “who have not accepted the reality of majority rule” were helping to instigate South Africa's widespread crime, sabotaging the economy and using the mass media to spread anti-ANC propaganda. The goal, Mandela said, was to make the country ungovernable, subvert the economy and erode confidence in the ANC's ability to govern.\n\nHe also accused the mass media and some aid and development groups of working against his government. In the three-and-a-half years the ANC had been in power, “the matter has become perfectly clear that the bulk of the mass media in our country has set itself up as a force opposed to the ANC,” Mandela said.\n\nHe went on to say some aid groups were in fact acting as the political ears and mouthpieces for local and foreign interests acting against his government. He quoted, in particular, a United States Aid for International Development (USAID) document which he said stated its goals as challenging his government on important issues, “in some respects making President Mandela's task more difficult.”\n\nPresident Mandela also listed the ANC government's achievements, including a new constitution, a stable government and programmes to provide electric power, running water and housing for millions of poor blacks ignored under apartheid.\n\n“Who in this country could do better than the ANC?,” he asked at one point in a booming voice, departing from his prepared text.\n\nIt was a bitter speech in which he lashed out at South Africa's whites, saying they expected continued economic advantages in exchange for relinquishing political power to blacks.\n\nResting several times and frequently drinking water in the stifling hot auditorium during his four-hour address, Mandela said whites had begun to define “national reconciliation” as a guarantee that “their privileged positions in the socio-economic sphere” remain untouched.\n\nHe was quoted by Suzanne Daley in her report from South Africa, “Mandela Speech Attacks White Economic Elite,” published in the December 17, 1997 edition of The New York Times.\n\nIn his last major speech as president of the ruling African National Congress, Mandela went on to say that transformation from apartheid to racial equality was far from complete. Yet when any meaningful changes were attempted, such as the use of affirmative action to end racial inequalities, whites “consistently demonstrated” their determination to maintain the status quo, he said. He further stated:\n\n\"The spokespersons of the advantaged have not hesitated to cry foul, citing all manner of evil, such as racism, violation of the Constitution, nepotism, dictatorship, inducing a brain drain and frightening the foreign investor.\" - (Mandela, quoted by Suzanne Daley, “Mandela Speech Attacks White Economic Elite,” in The New York Times, December 17, 1997, p. A-1.

As Allister Sparks, author of several books on South African politics, stated:\n\n\"It was a watershed speech in many ways. I think what you saw is Mr. Mandela legitimising a tougher line for Mbeki.\" - (Allister Sparks, quoted by Suzanne Daley, “Mandela Speech Attacks White Economic Elite,” op.cit.).\n\nOthers said the speech was also an attempt to focus on the general elections of 1999. By repeatedly characterising the struggle to transform South Africa as being far from complete, Mandela once again defined the African National Congress as a liberation movement which must stick together and mobilise forces in the on-going struggle against the vestiges of apartheid.\n\nBut there were those who said the speech was, in fact, prepared by Mbeki and his team. As Michael Bratton, professor of political science and African studies at Michigan State University in the United States, who once was a visiting Fulbright scholar at the University of Natal and at the University of Durban in South Africa, stated:\n\n\"When 3,000 ANC delegates gathered in Mafikeng for the party's 50th congress in December 1997, Mandela gave a vituperative valedictory speech.\n\nBefore cataloguing the ANC's achievements, he lashed out at 'a counterrevolutionary network [of those] who have not accepted the reality of majority rule.'\n\nAccused of subverting the government's program were apartheid holdovers in the bureaucracy, the main white opposition parties, foreign-funded nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and 'the bulk of the mass media.'\n\nAlthough the text of the speech was reportedly prepared by Mbeki's office and is thought to reflect his views, it was presented by Mandela, perhaps because his vast [moral] authority made a strident message more palatable, and because a reversal of roles enabled Mbeki, whose supremacy is still being established, to rise above the fray.\" - (Michael Bratton, “After Mandela's Miracle in South Africa,” in Current History: A Journal of Contemporary World Affairs, May 1998, p. 216).\n\nThe reaction from white South Africans was swift and strong, although muted in some quarters. But international press coverage was also negative.\n\nMany people, used to Mandela's conciliatory attitude towards whites, expected to hear the same kind of message in his farewell address as the leader of the ruling party, although he was to remain president of South Africa until his term expired in April 1999, after which he said he would not seek re-election for a second term.\n\nYet, such magnanimity on the part of blacks without reciprocity from whites would only embolden whites to become even more defiant against the black-majority government and its agenda for restructuring the society to achieve racial equality.\n\nThat is one of the most important things Mandela's critics, including much of the international press, ignored in their assessment of his valedictory speech which was nonetheless well-received among blacks who remain magnanimous towards whites and even elected a majority of non-blacks to the highest posts in the ruling African National Congress:\n\n\"International press coverage of the speech was adverse...[But] black domestic audiences reacted more favorably to a public rebuke of those white South Africans who insist on the preservation of what are widely perceived as ill-gotten gains.\n\nIndeed, Mandela probably enhanced his status with core constituents who felt that he had gone too far to accommodate white interests....\n\n[But also] to their credit, the 3,000 ANC delegates gathered in Mafikeng – who were overwhelmingly African – helped the ANC reaffirm its well-established nonracial credentials by electing seven non-Africans to the party's ten top executive positions.\" - (Ibid).\n\nIn his withering attack on whites still sympathetic to the old apartheid regime and who are also opposed to black-majority rule, President Mandela went on to say that an underground network of “the former ruling group” was poised “to launch or intensify a campaign of destabilization” that would include subverting the economy and using crime to “render the country ungovernable.”\n\nHe also attacked the media for “exploiting the dominant position it achieved as a result of the apartheid system, to campaign against both real change and the real agent of change, as represented by our movement.”\n\nAnd he mentioned both the largely white liberal Democratic Party, and the National Party which instituted apartheid, as parties “engaged in a desperate struggle” to convince white voters that they are the most “reliable and best defenders of white privilege.”\n\nSome of Mandela's most vitriolic statements were directed against the newly formed United Democratic Movement which was attempting to establish itself as a multiracial party and present itself as a credible alternative to the virtually unassailable multiracial African National Congress.\n\nBut the new party discredited itself right from the beginning with its dubious multiracial agenda and notorious leadership. As Mandela pointed out, the United Democratic Movement had drawn “into its ranks some of the most backward and corrupt elements in our society, which have no interest whatsoever in promoting the interests of the people. Thus the presence of leaders of criminal gangs at its founding conference was no accident.”\n\nMandela was quoted by Suzanne Daley, a reporter of The Washington Post, in her report from South Africa cited earlier.\n\nMany delegates praised Mandela's speech, saying it addressed issues most South Africans – that is, the vast majority of blacks – really cared about; particularly the intransigence and lack of effort on the part of whites to reach across the great racial divide and help end racial inequalities. As Vusi Chinga, a 25 year-old black delegate from Klerksdorp, bluntly stated:\n\n\"That is the reality of the situation. We expected a lot of changes in South Africa, but it seems like change is only expected from us. We are really the only ones reconciling. They just want to see an African fail.\" - (Quoted, ibid).\n\nAnd there is a lot of truth to that statement. The more blacks try to reach across the great racial divide, the further most whites pull back or look the other way; and the more blacks try to heal the wounds of the past through constructive dialogue and forgiveness, the more whites accuse them of conducting a witch hunt, instead of thanking them for being so forgiving.\n\nThey have made a big joke out of the whole reconciliation process by the Truth Commission to try and bring the races together in a spirit of brotherhood. As Professor Michael Bratton stated:\n\n\"The most ambitious goal of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, targeted through extensive radio and television coverage of its public hearings, is to change how white South Africans think. In this it has so far failed. Few whites are willing to admit complicity in apartheid.\" - (Michael Bratton, “After Mandela's Miracle in South Africa,” op.cit., p. 217).\n\nYet these are the very same people who deliberately kept the apartheid regime in power, as they consistently voted for racist leaders, election after election, year after year, decade after decade. They knew exactly what they were doing, whom they were voting for, and why: to keep blacks at the bottom - more than anybody else.\n\nWithout white voters, apartheid would have died a long time ago – and would not, in fact, even have had the chance to establish itself, except in the minds of those who conceived it. It would have been still-born. Even the architects of this diabolical institution knew that.\n\nSo, as whites continue to insulate themselves from the truth, race relations continue to be polarised, a feeling eloquently expressed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu in December 1997:\n\n\"Tutu summed up the mood of the country by saying in late December last year that whites begrudge being asked to carry a burden of guilt and blacks resent the failure of whites to acknowledge how lucky they are.\"- (Desmond Tutu, cited ibid).\n\nGiven what human nature is, they should indeed consider themselves very lucky, especially in a country where they are vastly outnumbered by the people they oppressed for centuries and who continue to be their victims in many ways.\n\nBut there is a limit to human patience. Even saints run out of it. That is simply human.\n\nEven people who have endured suffering without bitterness for years can not be expected to endure it forever. That partly explains why Mandela gave such a vituperative speech in which he strongly condemned and accused the white opposition and the white media of trying to thwart reforms in order to preserve and perpetuate white privilege at the expense of blacks.\n\nHe also warned that security networks established in the era of white-minority rule were never dismantled and still posed a threat to stability and democracy. He did not directly warn of an impending or a possible racial conflict but seemed to suggest such a possibility when he said that his three-year-and-a-half government's efforts to transform society still were new:\n\n\"[They have] not yet impacted seriously on the apartheid paradigm which affects all aspects of our lives. This process has not yet tested the strength of the counteroffensive which would seek to maintain the privileges of the white minority.\" - (Nelson Mandela, quoted in “Mandela Lambastes White Opposition in ANC Farewell,” in The Boston Globe, December 17, 1997, p. A-1; and in The Washington Post, December 17, 1997).\n\nHe went on to say that his efforts at reconciliation had been spurned by white political leaders. Specifically, he said the National Party's withdrawal in 1996 from a government of national unity showed that the party viewed the ANC with “implacable enmity.” South Africa's white parties had “decided against the pursuit of a national agenda” and had chosen instead to propagate “a reactionary, dangerous and opportunistic” position against the ruling African National Congress.\n\nHe also accused whites of invoking racist symbolism to gain political mileage from the nation's high crime rate and to suggest that a black government is doomed to fail. In addition, Mandela said, “the bulk of the mass media in our country has set itself up as a force of opposition to the ANC.”\n\nThat was one of the forces – racist white opposition – his successor Thabo Mbeki had to contend with after he assumed the presidency of the African National Congress at the party's 50th caucus in Mafikeng in December 1997, and of the country in June 1999.\n\nUpon taking control of the ANC, Mbeki pledged to eradicate the stubborn remains of apartheid and bring economic liberation to the impoverished black masses:\n\n\"We must pursue the objectives of high and sustained economic growth and development to achieve a visible improvement in the standard of living of our people, with special emphasis on the poor.\" - (Thabo Mbeki, quoted in “Mandela Passes ANC Torch: Successor Aims for Development,” in The Boston Globe, December 21, 1997, p. A-2).\n\nBut Mbeki's leadership also posed a dilemma. As Kurt Shillinger reported from South Africa in The Boston Globe:\n\n\"An advocate of swifter social transformation, Mbeki has in recent months (in 1997) led some whites to fear that he wants to push them farther to the sidelines.\n\nTrade unionists, meanwhile, worry that he is too conservative, focused more on economic growth than jobs for the masses.\" - (Ibid).\n\nThe trade unionists and their supporters had a point. During a period of 18 months before the 50th ANC party conference in Mafikeng in December 1997, the government's economic policies had cost the economy more jobs, through belt-tightening, than it had created. Labour Minister Toto Mboweni acknowledged this failure and the need for a careful balance between economic growth and job creation:\n\n\"Despite significant improvements in the rate of growth of the economy, there has been no visible improvement on the jobs numbers, and therefore we need to more vigorously proceed and implement some of the programs of economic transformation and development.\" - (Tito Mboweni, quoted ibid).\n\nMandela's speech signalled a possible shift to more emphasis on addressing the needs of the black masses than had been the case before among the ANC leaders whose focus on macroeconomic policy and fiscal austerity had often clashed with the need to tackle daily problems faced by millions of poverty-stricken blacks; a dichotomy acknowledged by Deputy President Mbeki and Labour Minister Mboweni as well as others in the ANC leadership.\n\nSince he became president of South Africa in 1994, Mandela had pursued racial reconciliation diligently and was even able to establish good relations with a right-wing racist general who launched a rebellion before the 1994 election in a desperate attempt to reassert white supremacy.\n\nHe also held regular meetings on economic policy with the white corporate elite. He did all this to reassure whites that South Africa was their country too; and also to keep their economic and military power from being used against the new fragile multiracial government.\n\nAnd he did that for good reason. Whites still dominated the armed forces and the entire security apparatus as well as the economy without which the government is nothing.\n\nBut in his farewell speech as leader of the ruling African National Congress, he stunned whites when he told them in no uncertain terms that they had not done enough in return:\n\n\"[He also] accused whites of treating reconciliation cavalierly and protecting their socioeconomic privilege by resisting efforts to uplift the nation's black majority. He singled out white opposition parties and the white media for opposing reforms, suggesting that their reluctance to buy into a 'new patriotism' being pushed by the ANC was tantamount to being an enemy of the state.\" - (“Mandela's Message: White Privilege Must Give Way,” in the International Herald Tribune, December 22, 1997, p. 1).\n\nHis speech clearly showed that South Africa was entering a new phase in which reconciliation would not necessarily be a top priority – unless whites reciprocate after deliberately choosing to remain aloof from the healing process in spite of all the efforts by the ruling African National Congress to try and reach out to them. As Lynne Duke reported from South Africa in the International Herald Tribune:\n\n\"Thabo Mbeki, Mandela's successor as ANC leader, has touched on these themes many times before, causing suspicion among whites that he would take a harder line toward them than Mr. Mandela did.\" - (Ibid.).\n\nIt was a perception shared by other analysts, since transformation of post-apartheid South Africa is usually seen as the antithesis of reconciliation because it entails elimination of white privilege whites are determined to maintain indefinitely, if not forever is possible. As Robert Schrirer, a political scientist at the University of Cape Town, put it:\n\n\"To some extent, the popular perception was of Nelson Mandela as the reconciler and Thabo Mbeki the transformer. I think that one should really view the speech as the opening shot of the Thabo presidency.\" - (Robert Shrirer, quoted , ibid).\n\nOn reaching out to whites, Mbeki said he would hold personal meetings with whites, in a spirit of constructive engagement, to allay their fears and at the same time let them know that it was imperative for all South Africans to face harsh realities if the country was going to achieve genuine racial reconciliation and justice and equality for all its citizens.\n\nBut some people feared that the Mandela-Mbeki team invoked racial group interests to an extent that is out of step with the new multiracial government's espoused goal of a non-racial society. As Themba Sono, the black president of the South Africa Institute of Race Relations, said about Mandela's speech:\n\n\"He was clearing the decks for Thabo Mbeki to come and focus no longer on reconciliation but on the primacy of the interests of the black majority.\n\nDoes this comport with our constitutional prescriptions?\" - (Themba Sono, quoted ibid.).\n\nIt does, of course, because the new South African constitution allows the government to correct past racial injustices such as those inflicted on blacks by apartheid; a point that, for some inexplicable reason, Sono did not seem to grasp.\n\nBut the constitution also allows for the protection of minority rights. Accommodating the interests of both is one of the main challenges the African National Congress is going to face for many years to come if it remains, as it probably will, secured anchored in power.\n\nThe ANC continues to see itself as a black liberation movement with a mission to not simply lead the country but also improve the living conditions of the vast majority of blacks who were denied opportunities during the apartheid era. Therefore it is obvious that the interests of the two racial groups are going to clash.\n\nBut that is primarily because whites, who are the richest people in South Africa, don't want to make any economic sacrifices to help uplift blacks who are collectively the poorest racial group in the country.\n\nIt is a zero-sum game in which one group's gains are seen as another group's loss.\n\nAnd the economic gap between blacks and whites will continue to exist and strain race relations unless whites, because of their disproportionately high incomes, are taxed higher than they are being taxed now, and also pay a reparations tax for decades in order to help improve the condition of the black masses.\n\nAlthough Mandela's speech was not well-received in the white community, and probably frightened the majority of them, one could still hear the voice of reason coming from a few whites; in fact very few.\n\nIn the media, Patrick Bulger, political editor of the Johannesburg Star newspaper, broke ranks with his colleagues – most of whom, because of their hostility, only vindicated Mandela's position when he said in his speech that they were working to undermine his government – when he wrote a scathing analysis of the white perception of the new dispensation, saying:\n\n\"[The common but unspoken white view is] that blacks somehow should be satisfied with less, that this is somehow in the natural God-given order of things.\n\nThe ANC, the conventional white wisdom would go, is welcome to bring about a better life for all South Africans, but not at the cost of white privilege. \"- (Patrick Bulger, in an editorial in the Johannesburg Star, December 1997; also quoted by Lynne Duke, “Mandela: Putting Whites on Notice,” International Herald Tribune, ibid., p. 9).\n\nWithout sacrificing their privileged position, there can be no better life for all South Africans. And what whites have always feared will become a self-fulling prophecy because of their intransigence.\n\nYet, that is exactly what the African National Congress has been trying to avoid but, unfortunately, without getting a positive response from most whites who would rather risk an all-out confrontation with blacks than give up their privileges they unjustly acquired during the apartheid era at the expense of blacks.\n\nBut, in spite of their defiance, the transformation will go on, nonetheless, in order to correct past racial injustices – they themselves were responsible for – and build a stable multiracial society. As The Economist reported after the 50th ANC party conference – which takes place every three years – in December 1997:\n\n\"There is mounting pressure for what South Africans call 'transformation.' This means the shifting of power – whether in business, the media, universities or the use of municipal resources – from white to black.\n\nThe two groups see this matter differently: whites seem to think they have done enough and it is time to get back to business as usual; blacks believe that genuine change has barely begun.\" - (“South Africa's New leaders,” in The Economist, 20 December 1997, p. 55).\n\nIt was in this context that Mandela lashed out at white intransigence in his militant speech which clearly showed that the struggle continues.\n\nBut probably more than anybody else, it was Winnie Madikizela-Mandela who embodied the anger and frustration of the most downtrodden black masses; a sentiment she had been able to articulate forcefully from a populist platform for years, sending a powerful message to whites that they may not even have a place under the African sun – because of their own undoing – if they didn't come to terms with the new realities of a free multiracial South Africa that was nonetheless predominantly black African.\n\nShe made it clear that white control was over. In a rare public address in February 1998, the former wife of Nelson Mandela told white business leaders at a conference in Johannesburg that newly democratic South Africa faces a second revolution to break the white stranglehold on the economy. She went on to bluntly state:\n\n\"The truth and reality is that South Africa today and into the future is no longer European or white, but African and, more often, black.\" - (Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, “Madikizela-Mandela Speaks Out: Says Whites' Control of Economy is Over in South Africa, in The Boston Globe, February 13, 1998, p. A-23).\n\nA leader of international stature in her own right with formidable populist credentials, the former Mrs. Mandela -whose ties to Mandela and continued use of her former spousal name also invests her with an aura of moral authority - told an almost white audience of businessmen and businesswomen that white dominance in the country's boardrooms was over, and also that following the victory of the African National Congress in the country's first all-race elections in 1994, South Africa faced “a second revolution that is focused on Africanism, African humanism, a clearer African identity. The second revolution will lead among other things to the demise of Eurocentric liberalism; the disappearance of the white man as we have known him and her in Africa; and the renaissance of African ubuntu.”\n\nAlso known for her fiery rhetoric, Madikizela-Mandela was viewed with apprehension by most whites because of her immense popularity among the masses – at the grassroots level – especially in the townships, a hotbed of radical activism, and had the potential to greatly influence the course of events in South Africa from behind the scenes even if she did not win any public office in the future as a national leader.\n\nAt the December 1997 ANC conference in Mafikeng, the 63-year-old former first lady shelved a bid for election as deputy president of the African National Congress – which would have virtually assured her the vice-presidency of the country after the 1999 general election – when she failed to win enough support from the convention delegates who had been manipulated by the party leadership to block her from winning because of her tarnished record in the final years of apartheid.\n\nShe was alleged to have masterminded a violent campaign against her opponents in the black township of Soweto during that period, but denied all the charges levelled against her.\n\nPolitical analysts linked her to the radical left wing of the ANC which shifted from socialism to more moderate positions after the party was unbanned in 1990 by the last apartheid rulers to prepare for a transition to black majority rule. She was also linked to a faction within the African National Congress, which was virtually assured of a second victory in the 1999 general election, that sought to limit the role of whites, Indians and Coloureds, and promote the influence of blacks.\n\nUsing the ANC's euphemism for the issue of race balances in government and business, the former Mrs. Mandela told the white businessmen and women: “This second revolution will address the national question in a program that is both systemic and prioritized.”\n\nSpeaking directly to business for the first time, Madikizela-Mandela said blacks would not tolerate cosmetic changes in corporations:\n\n\"Business, like all institutions of our society, should be Africanized during the transformation process. In short, transform the corporate culture.\n\nUnless the African is placed at the center of transformation and the national agenda, our country will not be stable, productive, and competitive.\" - (Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, quoted in The Boston Globe, ibid).\n\nOn the same day his former wife addressed white businessmen and women in Johannesburg, President Mandela appealed for unity to rebuild the country, returning to his more familiar theme of reconciliation after a hard-hitting speech at the 50th ANC party conference in Mafikeng in December 1997. He stated on 12 February 1998:\n\n\"What we need, as we approach the fifth year of freedom, is to become a nation rich in the diversity of its culture and opinions, but united in its resolve to relieve the poverty that still blights the lives of the majority.\"- (Nelson Mandela, quoted, ibid).\n\nIn spite of President Mandela's noble sentiment of multi-racialism, an equally noble sentiment of black nationalism is on the rise. And there is nothing wrong with black nationalism in a predominantly black nation provided the rights of minority groups are equally protected by the majority.\n\nThat is the ideological position articulated by Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, although the message may be misconstrued – or even deliberately distorted – by others to mean: exclude or shut out all whites and other non-blacks; which would be a contradiction of her position on what she calls “African ubuntu.”\n\nTrue ubuntu is colour-blind; it can't be but that as a philosophy predicated on the equality and brotherhood of men. And African ubuntu has proved to be exactly that as the history of the white man in Africa clearly shows. He has been embraced and treated with compassion in spite of all the pain and suffering he has inflicted on Africans since he conquered and took over the continent as if it belonged to nobody.\n\nThe position Madikizela-Mandela articulates on what she calls “Africanism,...[and] a clearer African identity” is also the same position articulated by the late Steve Biko, founder of the Black Consciousness Movement, who was murdered by the apartheid regime in September 1977 at the age of 30.\n\nEven President Mandela conceded the primacy of this position, articulated by his former wife and by Steve Biko, as he clearly demonstrated in his militant speech at the 50th ANC party conference in Mafikeng in December 1997.\n\nTherefore, although Biko is dead, his legacy lives on and will continue to inspire and shape the future of the African National Congress – as will, undoubtedly, the militant wing of the party whose most forceful and most articulate spokesperson was Winine Madikizela-Mandela. As Peter Beinart stated in a dispatch from Johannesburg in The New Republic:\n\n\"In the past several months, the ANC has begun an ideological transformation toward Biko-style black nationalism, a turn signaled most dramatically by Nelson Mandela's fiery, anti-white speech in December (1997) at the ANC conference in Mafikeng.\n\nThis shift is already prompting howls of fear and disapproval from white liberals in South Africa and the West.\n\nBut the fear is misplaced. The ANC's growing Africanism is the flip side of its remarkable embrace of the free market.\n\nIt is best understood not as a move to the left, but to the right – part of a broader turn toward market authoritarianism in black politics that is visible in phenomena as seemingly unrelated as the rise of IMF-approved autocrats like Uganda's Yoweri Museveni and in Louis Farrakhan's support of black entrepreneurship.\" - (Peter Beinart, “Black Markets: Why Capitalism is Trumping Multiracialism in South African Politics,” in The New Republic, Washington, D.C., February 16, 1998, p. 11).\n\nAnd affirmative-action policies pursued by President Mandela's government and by others after him are a key component of this increasing emphasis on Africanism, although they don't go far enough, at least according to the view of the charismatic populist icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and the radical faction of the ruling African National Congress of which she was an integral part. But it is a move in the right direction, nonetheless.\n\nIn a media campaign launched in February 1998, coincidentally or not, the same month in which the former Mrs. Mandela also gave her strongly pro-African speech, President Mandela's government announced a spate of affirmative-action policies in jobs and other areas including sports, land, mineral, and water resources. As Mandela himself said during the opening of parliament in the same month:\n\n\"Affirmative action is a corrective action. We shall not be discouraged by the sirens of self-interest that are being sounded in defense of privilege, and the insults that equate women, Africans,...Coloureds, and the disabled with a lowering of standards.\" - (Nelson Mandela, quoted by Kate Dunn in “Mandela Hits White Wealth: South Africa Turns to Affirmative Action,” in The Christian Science Monitor, February 26, 1998, pp. 1, and 7).\n\nThe imperative need for such corrective measures should be viewed in the context of the huge disparities which still exist today and threaten to put blacks and whites on a collision course with dire consequences for the country even without the possibility of "
