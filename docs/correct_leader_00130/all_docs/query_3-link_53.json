        "text": "Former State President PW Botha on Thursday indicated a willingness to assist the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in its continuing probe into human rights abuses, but said he had nothing to apologise for and would not seek amnesty.\n\nIn two-hour talks with commission chairman Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Botha also denied ordering the 1988bombing of Khotso House, the former headquarters of the SA Council of Churches.\n\nHe said the allegations implicating him in the attack were based on untested and unsubstantiated hearsay.\n\n\"I am, in any event, advised that the damage to property caused by the Khotso House incident does not constitute a gross violation of human rights... and consequently falls outside the scope of the jurisdiction of (the ) commission\".\n\nBotha said he was not guilty of any offence for which he should either apologise or seek amnesty. \"I therefore have no intention of doing this. I have nothing to hide.\"\n\nAs a Christian and an Afrikaner he could not, and never had, associated himself with \"blatant murder\".\n\nThe talks were held at the home of Botha's eldest daughter, Elanza Maritz, in the Southern Cape town of George.\n\nTutu asked for the one-to-one meeting after testimony by former senior policemen in court and before the commission that Botha ordered a string of political atrocities during his presidency in the 1980s.\n\nHe said later that Botha had received him with warmth and friendliness and treated him to Rooibos tea and sausage rolls in the \"voorhuis\" (parlour).\n\nHe described the meeting as a breakthrough, saying it signalled a softening in Botha's stance on the commission.\n\nIn a prepared statement presented to Tutu, Botha said he was willing to co-operate with the commission in its investigations and suggested the body compile a comprehensive list of matters on which it needed his comments.\n\nIn October, former national police chief Johan van der Merwe told the commission that Botha had authorised the Khotso House bombing.\n\nVan der Merwe said he believed Botha might also have been behind the murder of several anti-apartheid activists killed by booby-trapped grenades.\n\nTutu said on Thursday the commission's investigative unit and research department would be asked to draw up a list of questions for submission to Botha.\n\n\"We will be (assessing) the responses we will be getting from him. That will determine which way we go.\"\n\nHe defended the commission's \"softly-softly\" approach to the former state president, saying the body was obliged to follow the route which had the greatest potential for providing the truth.\n\nDuring the meeting, Botha said he was willing to do all in his power to persuade former Cabinet colleagues to co-operate with the commission.\n\nHowever, he warned Tutu not to limit the commission's investigations to the actions of previous government functionaries, but to also probe the gross violations of human rights committed by African National Congress members.\n\n\"The activities of the commission should also not be permitted to develop into a persecution and a series of Nuremburg-type trials.\"\n\nHe said as head of a legally elected and internationally recognised government, he accepted full political responsibility for his government's policies - as well as the sweeping reforms it had introduced.\n\nBut he could not be expected to take responsibility for those individuals who had exceeded the limits of their authority during the apartheid conflict.\n\n\"I stand, however, without any qualification behind all the thousands of members of the security forces who, in the lawful execution of their duties, bravely fought against the revolutionary onslaught of Soviet imperialism.\"\n\nHe asked for a six-month extension of the December 14 deadline for amnesty applications.\n\nBotha said his personal record of political reform in systematically removing racist and discriminatory legislation in an orderly fashion was a matter of public record.\n\nHis term of office had seen the abolition of the Mixed Marriages Act and influx control measures, and the recognition of property rights for blacks. His government had also desegregated metropolitan train services and removed the racial basis of the Liquor Act.\n\nIt was he who had personally initiated the process to free ANC leader Nelson Mandela from prison.\n\nBotha gave Tutu a copy of the book \"Fighter and Reformer\", which contains extracts of his public statements during his years in public office.\n\nÂ© South African Press Association, 1996\n\nThis text is for information only and may not be published or reprinted without the permission of the South African Press Association"
