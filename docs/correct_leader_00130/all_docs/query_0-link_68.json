        "text": "Former Heads of State, Former Heads of Government and Former Governors-General and their Deputies\n\nGovernor-General\n\nThe Union of South Africa was promulgated on 31 May 1910 after negotiations, which excluded black South Africans. The Union entailed the amalgamation of the four colonies in southern Africa (Orange Free State, Tranvaal, Natal and the Cape Colony) into a single political entity, which was itself a self-governing Dominion in the British Empire. The government of the Union was therefore subject to the Head of State of the British Empire, i.e. the King of England (at that time) who was represented in South Africa by an appointed Governor-General to whom the Prime Minister of the Union (the elected Head of Government of the Union) accounted. The Governor-General also represented the government of Britain as High Commissioner, i.e. (In these twin positions, his responsibilities also extended to the then Basutoland (now Lesotho), Bechuanaland (Botswana) and Swaziland.\n\nState Presidents of the Republic\n\nFollowing a racially-based referendum which excluded black people, South Africa was declared a Republic on 31 May 1961 and under international pressure withdrew from the Commonwealth of Nations (which had replaced the British Empire). With the onset of the Republic, the Office of the Governor-General was abolished and the position of State President was created as the figurative head of state (a situation which remained from until 1983 when under the Tricameral Parliament, the position became substantive and effectively displaced the significance of the Prime Minister. The position of Prime Minister was eventually abolished in 1984).\n\nPrime Ministers\n\nThe position of a Prime Minister was established in 1910, with the formation of the Union of South Africa. This position was the highest elected political office in the Union. It was abolished in 1984 by State President Willem De Klerk, when, under the Tricameral Parliament (established in 1983) the political significance of the position of the State President was increased and the position of Prime Minister became more and more superfluous.\n\nPresidents of the Republic\n\nPrior to the first non-racial elections in April 1994, South Africa adopted an interim constitution which provided for the position of President. The 1994 interim constitution finally gave way to the final constitution in 1996 which retained the position of President.\n\nGovernors-General\n\n17 July 1943 - 1 January 1946: Nicolaas Jacobus de Wet\n\n1 January 1946 - 1 January 1951: Gideon Brand van Zyl\n\n1 January 1951 - 25 November 1959: Ernest George Jansen\n\n26 November 1959 - 7 December 1959: Charles Robberts Swart\n\nState Presidents of the Republic\n\n31 May 1961 - 1 June 1967: Charles Robberts Swart\n\n1 June 1967 - 10 April 1968: Jozua Francois Naude\n\n10 April 1968 - 9 April 1975: Jacobus Johannes ('Jim') Fouch√©\n\n19 April 1975 - 21 August 1978: Nicolaas Johannes Diederichs\n\n21 August 1978 - 10 October 1978: Marais Viljoen\n\n10 October 1978 - 4 June 1979: Balthazar Johannes (BJ) Vorster\n\n4 June 1979 - 3 September 1984: Marais Viljoen\n\n3 September 1984 - 15 August 1989: Pieter Willem (PW) Botha\n\n15 August 1989 - 10 May 1994: Frederik Willem (FW) de Klerk\n\nPresidents of the Republic\n\n25 September 2008 - 9 May 2009: Kgalema Motlanthe\n\n16 June 1999 - 24 September 2008: Thabo Mvuyelwa Mbeki\n\n10 May 1994 - 16 June 1999: Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela\n\nPrime Ministers\n\n5 September 1939 - 4 June 1948: Jan Christiaan Smuts\n\n4 June 1948 - 30 November 1954: Daniel Francois (DF) Malan\n\n30 November 1954 - 24 August 1958: Johannes Gerhardus Strijdom\n\n2 September 1958 - 6 September 1966: Hendrik Frensch (HF) Verwoerd\n\n13 September 1966 - 29 September 1978: Balthazar Johannes (BJ) Vorster\n\n29 September 1978 - 14 September 1984: Pieter Willem (PW) Botha\n\nDeputy Presidents of the Republic\n\nVice State President\n\n1 January 1981 - 14 September 1984: Alwyn Schlebusch\n\nDeputy Presidents\n\n13 May 1994 - 16 June 1999: Thabo Mbeki (1st Executive deputy President)\n\n13 May 1994 - 30 June 1996: Frederik Willem (FW) de Klerk (2nd Executive deputy President)\n\n17 June 1999 - 14 June 2005: Jacob Zuma\n\n23 June 2005 - 24 September 2008: Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka\n\n5 September 2008 - : Baleka Mbete\n\nMinisters in the Presidency"
