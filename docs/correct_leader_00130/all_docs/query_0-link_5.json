        "text": "Former president PW Botha on Wednesday became the first apartheid head of state to face criminal charges after Western Cape Attorney-General Frank Kahn announced he would prosecute the 81-year-old for ignoring a subpoena to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\nTRC deputy chairman Dr Alex Boraine made a late appeal on Wednesday for Botha to reconsider, saying the TRC would approach Kahn to withdraw charges should he agree to appear before the TRC.\n\nThe decision to prosecute follows a public battle of wills between Botha and the TRC, in which he failed three times to appear before the commission: initially because he was ill, but later because it was a \"circus\" and a \"witchhunt\" against apartheid leaders.\n\nAfter his second refusal the TRC wanted to charge him but Kahn ruled the subpoena was flawed. Third time around, Botha defied another subpoena.\n\nKahn told a news conference earlier on Wednesday that in considering whether to proseucute, Botha's personal circumstances had weighed heavily on him.\n\n\"He is almost 82 years of age and no attorney-general in any civilised country lightly decides to prosecute a person of his age, especially given Mr Botha's medical history.\"\n\nHowever, he had eventually decided that a prosecution was warranted in law and in the public interest.\n\nKahn said he had not bowed to any political pressures in deciding to prosecute, and had not consulted any politician or persons outside his office.\n\nA summons would be served on Botha at his Wilderness home, ordering him to appear in the George Regional Court on January 23.\n\nBotha's attorney Ernst Penzhorn told Sapa on Wednesday that Botha would accept service of the summons and would appear in court on January 23 to answer charges.\n\nPenzhorn said his client had decided not to make any other public statements about the matter.\n\nBoraine told reporters the TRC had hoped that the issue would not reach this eventuality, as Botha had been given every opportunity to co-operate with the TRC.\n\nThe TRC bore no animosity towards Botha and the matter should never have ended in a court of law, Boraine said.\n\nIt was not the commission's intention for Botha to be punished or to go to jail. \"We have to respect our own Act\", Boraine said.\n\nThe TRC believed that Botha, with his experience and information as defence minister, prime minister and state president, could give vital information for the commission to fulfil its mandate.\n\nIt was clear that as chairman of the former State Security Council, Botha had information, knowledge and opinions the commission needed to weigh up, and which were critical for it to complete its work.\n\nJustice Minister Dullah Omar urged all South Africans to respect and accept Kahn's decision, and said it was vital that the rule of law be established in South Africa.\n\nOne of the problems of the past, which remained, was that too many people regarded themselves as being above the law, Omar said.\n\nNobody was above the law, he said, echoing previous statements by President Nelson Mandela.\n\nThe African National Congress hailed the decision as one which would reinforce the confidence of the majority of people in the TRC process.\n\nIt was unfortunate that so much effort and resource had been deployed to ensure Botha was brought before the doors of the TRC, said ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa.\n\n\"Kahn's decision in this regard will send a clear message that those who show contempt for the feelings of victims of gross human rights violations, and the TRC processes, will bear the consequences of their own actions.\"\n\nThe Conservative Party repeated earlier statements that the TRC was bent on undermining Botha and belittling the Afrikaner, who had made the largest contribution to South Africa's development as a first world country.\n\nThe National Party said that in terms of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, Kahn had no choice but to prosecute the former NP strongman.\n\nAppealling to Botha to respect the law and the courts, the NP said the law would now have to take its course.\n\nHowever, the NP believed the TRC had acted wrongly in forcing the issue to the point it was now at.\n\nThe TRC's actions against Botha were in sharp contrast to the accommodating attitude towards ANC leaders who were granted blanket amnesty contrary to the commission's founding legislation, NP spokesman Daryl Swanepoel said.\n\nFreedom Front leader Constand Viljoen said the issue was not against Botha alone, but impacted on the entire Afikaner volk.\n\nHe urged all Afrikaners to give Botha moral support, and said the action against the former state president was not something he could accept.\n\n\"It is not morally correct, and will definitely not contribute anything to making South Africa more acceptable.\"\n\nÂ© South African Press Association, 1998\n\nThis text is for information only and may not be published or reprinted without the permission of the South African Press Association"
