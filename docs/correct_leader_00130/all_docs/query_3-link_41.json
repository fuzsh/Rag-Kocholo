        "text": "-->\n\nInteresting as these exchanges are, they do not represent the most engaging subject illuminated in these papers. Both leaders focussed on the ongoing struggle for influence being waged in London by the ANC and the South African embassy. In the briefing notes Mrs Thatcher received from the Foreign Office, the section on ANC operations in London was heavily underlined in red and black ink. \"Neutralisation of ANC key target of South African foreign policy,\" she was told. \"ANC office in London said by South African Government to be nerve centre of terrorist activities.\"\n\nThis was a key issue raised by Botha in his tête-à-tête with Mrs Thatcher. \"Mr Botha asked that the ANC office in London should be closed,\" reveals the note written after the meeting. \"The Prime Minister said that we could not do this under our law, and there was no evidence that the office personnel had been guilty of illegal activities.\"\n\nMrs Thatcher's stand was based on her Foreign Office briefing. \"A thorough examination of all available information has revealed no evidence to support allegations of unlawful activity by ANC members here, including the linking of the London ANC office with active terrorism. Its main function remains what it has always been; publicity and propaganda.\" As it happens the briefing was not absolutely accurate. We now know that from as early as the late 1960's the ANC tested out some of its bucket bombs, designed to spread leaflets in South Africa, on Hampstead Heath.(1)\n\nThe papers reveal one small, but important, change in British thinking. This was over Joe Slovo, the ANC and South African Communist Party leader, who had a home in Camden. The Foreign Office described him as being \"top of the South African hit list.\" Slovo was \"...reputed to have been the mastermind behind ANC sabotage and to be a KGB officer.\" Slovo had indefinite leave to remain in Britain although he seldom actually lived here. He held Home Office travel documents. \"FCO has asked the Home Office to review these facilities critically.\" This remark was underlined twice and highlighted in the margin by Mrs Thatcher.\n\n-->\n\nMrs Thatcher had another issue up her sleeve. If Mr Botha pressed her about the ANC, she had extensive evidence of attacks organised by the South African embassy against ANC and SWAPO offices in London. The British had uncovered just what Stefanus Botha, the Embassy's First Secretary, had been up to. \"We have evidence of involvement by him and other intelligence officers in the break-in at AAM (Anti-Apartheid Movement) offices in May 1983,\" said the Foreign Office. Another letter - also from the Foreign Office - concludes that there was \"incontrovertible evidence\" that another member of the Embassy staff, Warrant Officer Klue, broke into SWAPO and ANC offices. He was withdrawn from London following British pressure.\n\nThe South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission later confirmed the accuracy of these accounts and indeed went much further, describing the bombing of the Anti-Apartheid Movement offices in London on 14th March 1982.(2) The plastic explosive for the bomb was smuggled into London in a diplomatic bag and those involved in the operation were decorated with the Police Star for Excellent Service. The operation was given the go ahead by the Minister of Law and Order, Louis le Grange, in reprisal for the involvement of British subjects in the ANC rocket attack on the Voortrekkerhoogte military base near Pretoria in 1981.\n\nThe Botha visit of 1984 satisfied all sides. Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, the chairman of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, sent Mrs Thatcher a fulsome handwritten thank you letter, praising her stand. \"It is impossible for me to thank you adequately for both the generosity of you reception to me and Mr Abdul Minty last Thursday and for your patience in listening,\" he wrote. \"At the same time I need hardly say how much your public statement on Television after the fateful meeting with Mr. Botha has done to give me encouragement and hope.\" [emphasis in the original]\n\nWhen the visit was over the Foreign Office was able to report from South Africa that Mr Botha had been \"delighted with the courtesy and respect with which he was everywhere received, even though European leaders were careful to maintain a certain reserve in their public welcoming.\" In reality the visit marked something of a high-watermark for the apartheid government - a breach in the wall of international isolation that increasingly surrounded the regime. A success that was not repeated. Yet the warmth of the welcome and the assurance that Pretoria had Western friends perhaps played some part in encouraging a measure of flexibility in the regime. Mrs Thatcher's reception at Chequers may have helped build confidence, allowing Botha's successor, F. W. de Klerk, to make the fateful decision to release Nelson Mandela in February 1990 and finally signal the end of apartheid.\n\n-->\n\nMartin Plaut was born and educated in South Africa and actively involved in the resurrection of the non-racial trade union movement before moving to Britain in 1977. He was Africa Secretary with the Labour Party until joining the BBC in 1984, reporting on Africa and retiring as Africa Editor, BBC World Service in 2013. He is currently with the Institute of Commonwealth Studies.\n\nNote: the papers are to be found at the National Archive in the file PREM 19/1392\n\n(1) London Recruits: The Secret War Against Apartheid, compiled and edited by Ken Keable, with an introduction by Ronnie Kasrils and a foreword by Z.
