They do not marry non-Europeans.\n\nAs MP of George, House of Assembly, 7 September 1948, as quoted in Dictionary of South African Quotations, Jennifer Crwys-Williams, Penguin Books, 1994, p. 251\n\nWith the with­drawal of Britain east of the Suez and the consequent vacuum caused in the Middle East, and the stocking of arsenals in some African states by Russia and China, the dangers threatening South Africa today are greater than ever before.\n\nAs Minister of Defence, speaking in Pretoria on 1 April 1968, Die Burger,[1] 2 April 1968\n\nIt should be noted that refugees are crossing the border from southern Angola to South-West Africa – not the other way round. There is no aggression from our side.\n\nAs Minister of Defence, denying shelling of southern Angola by the SADF, 9 November 1976, as cited in PW Botha in his own words, Pieter-Dirk Uys, 1987, p. 63\n\nThe United States needs a man at the helm who knows some psychology, who would know that you can't try to dictate to a people from abroad without stiffening their resistance.\n\nAs Minister of Defence, interviewed in the New York Times, 28 October 1977\n\nThe Cubans are not in Africa out of love.\n\nAs Minister of Defence, 22 January 1978, Beeld\n\nNo more mine-laying. No more murder. No more abduction of women and children. No more attacks on headmen. No more raids across the border. So long as these conditions do not exist there will be no withdrawal [from South-West Africa] of South African troops.\n\nAs Prime Minister to the House of Assembly, 8 March 1979, as cited in PW Botha in his own words, Pieter-Dirk Uys, 1987, p. 65\n\nI have been to Switzerland before but not to this [Paul Kruger's] house or to a Swiss bank.\n\nOn a European tour as Prime Minister, 31 May 1984, as cited in PW Botha in his own words, Pieter-Dirk Uys, 1987, p. 51\n\n...

We are not prophets. This is a step in the dark. We can only proceed into the future with faith.\n\nAs prime minister, introducing the 4th Amendment to the Constitution Bill, 23 May 1980, which envisaged a tricameral corporate federation.

Whether they are English- or German- or Portuguese- or Italian-speaking, or even Jewish-speaking, makes no difference.\n\nSpeaking to the House of Assembly on February 20, 1981, as cited by Andrew Donaldson, Sunday Times, 5 November 2006\n\nWe are a strong country in a rather sick world. … Our problems are not so much racial as radicals wish to make them.\n\nAs Prime Minister in a Business Week interview, USA, 4 April 1982, as cited in the Sunday Express, and Pieter-Dirk Uys, 1987, PW Botha in his own words, p. 15, 41\n\nI have come to the realisation and conviction that the struggle in South Africa is not between White, Black and Brown, but between Christian civilized standards and the powers of chaos.\n\nAs prime minister, Warrenton, 24 July 1982, as cited in PW Botha in his own words, Pieter-Dirk Uys, 1987, p. 23\n\nWe do not want chaos in South Africa.\n\nExplaining why cinemas were not open to all races, House of Assembly, April 21, 1983, as cited by Andrew Donaldson, Sunday Times, 5 November 2006\n\nWe dare not see ourselves as a chosen people.

It was only after half a century that an Afrikaner government started doing something about black rights.\n\nAs state president, unveiling a monument to Boer War victims at Delareyville, 10 October 1985, as cited in PW Botha in his own words, Pieter-Dirk Uys, 1987, p. 34\n\nKnowing [Mandela] will start up with violence again, I, as a responsible head of state, must release him so that he can carry on with his violence, and then arrest him? What a nonsensical argument.\n\nAs State President in the House of Delegates, 23 April 1986, as cited in PW Botha in his own words, Pieter-Dirk Uys, 1987, p. 86\n\nSouth Africa is not a jellyfish and is in many respects a swordfish.\n\nSpeaking to the House of Assembly on 28 April 1986, as cited by Andrew Donaldson, Sunday Times, 5 November 2006\n\nOur enemies latched unto the word \"apartheid\" and in a very sly manner transformed it into the strongest weapon in the onslaught against freedom and civilization in our country.\n\nAs state president at a parade of the SA Police College, Pretoria, 20 June 1986, as cited in PW Botha in his own words, Pieter-Dirk Uys, 1987, p. 37\n\nUnfortunately [South Africa] has been badly repaid for her loyalty because the West has expelled her from the family circle while befriending the most dictatorial regimes on Earth.\n\nAs state president in an interview with Figaro, Paris, 8 December 1986, as cited in The Star, and Pieter-Dirk Uys, 1987, PW Botha in his own words, p. 41\n\nNelson Mandela can rot in prison until he dies or I die, whichever takes longer.\n\nReportedly to Cape Town journalists in February 1987, though later denied.

Botha’s notorious “Rubicon” speech on 15 August 1985 at the National Party Congress in Durban was probably one of the most significant speeches in the history of South Africa. It was supposed to break the political and military deadlock between the apartheid government and the banned liberation movements, notably the ANC. Botha was widely expected to announce new policies that could possibly have ended the political conflict in the country. However, that did not happen. Instead the speech was a total fiasco. ...the South African government and P.W. Botha were not ready for such policy breakthrough announcements and had never planned to make them.\n\nFanie Cloete in Resolving P.W. Botha’s 1985 Rubicon riddle, Historia 64 (2), November 2019, pp. 132‐155.\n\nUri Friedman: Why did the South African government, in the mid-1970s, decide to embark on a nuclear-weapons program?\n\nF.W. de Klerk: The main motivation was the expansionist policies of the U.S.S.R. in southern Africa. They were supporting all the [African] liberation movements—they were supplying weapons and training—and it was part of their vision to gain direct or indirect control over most of the countries in southern Africa. They financed the deployment of many thousands of Cuban troops, especially to Angola, and this was interpreted as a threat first by Prime Minister John Vorster, and following upon him P.W. Botha. [The nuclear arsenal] was never intended, I think, to be used. It was a deterrent. Because of apartheid South Africa was becoming more and more isolated in the eyes of the rest of the world. There wouldn’t be, in the case of Russian aggression or invasion, assistance from the international community. It was felt that, if we have nuclear weapons, and if we then would disclose in a crisis that we have [them], it would change the political scenario and the U.S.A. and other [Western] countries might step in and assist South Africa.\n\nF. W. de Klerk as interviewed by Uri Friedman, \"Why One President Gave Up His Country's Nukes\". The Atlantic, (9 September 2017).\n\n[From as early as 1979, P. W. Botha], in his capacity as president of apartheid South Africa, was the real architect of the secret talks that ultimately led to De Klerk’s historic announcement in February 1990. ... Nelson Mandela started the process of persuading [Kobie] Coetsee that the time was ripe for the government to talk to the ANC, and that he was prepared to lead the initiative in prison even before consulting Lusaka. ... Botha’s response was to ... commence secret talks with the ANC to explore possible negotiations with the enemy. ... The South African conflict had reached a stalemate [with] no possibility of victory for either side. ... It was in this toxic environment that Mandela and Botha rose to the occasion, both without a mandate. Mandela defied the ANC and engaged the enemy without a mandate because he knew that the hawks in the ANC would have stopped his initiative. Botha [authorised secret talks] without informing his Cabinet because it was too risky to do so. ... White voters still viewed the ANC as terrorists controlled by Moscow in the context of the Cold War. Reports of Botha talking to the ANC would have sunk him as leader of the National Party and president of South Africa.\n\nSello Lediga in The unsung hero who changed the course of SA history, Opinionista, Daily Maverick, 6 February 2020\n\nEncyclopedic article on P. W. Botha on Wikipedia"
