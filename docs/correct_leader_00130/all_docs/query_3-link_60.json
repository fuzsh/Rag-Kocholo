        "text": "Mandela’s death has brought back to surface racial tensions that have existed between blacks and white. Boers on their websites are spurring hate speeches and do not even appreciate the contribution that Nelson Mandela made. There is still so much hate to go around and we still have a very long way to go. Last week, I heard the statement, “Black people are only good at toitoing!”. This just made me realize that even though there have been numerous exceptional men and women of colour, our white counterparts, still see us a useless waste of space. Below is a speech from PW Botha from 1985. I firmly believe that Botha did not try to be politically correct, he just said it as it saw it. Out of the abundance of he heart, the mouth speaks. I believe that the majority of white people still agree with Botha’s sentiments in this speech. In all fairness, a lot of what he says is actually very true. It saddens me that today, we have insensitive, money grabbing black people who only think about women and sex. As Botha says it, “They are good in nothing else but making noise, dancing, marrying many wives and indulging in sex.” Can we firmly disagree with him, l can think of a few African leaders who fit into that description.\n\nThis speech reminds me of a post Lazy African Scum written by Field Ruwe, a US-based Zambian media practitioner and author. In Zimbabwe we have the ZBC boss, Happyson Muchechetere who has been earning around US$40 000 a month, while his employees have gone unpaid for months. ZBC screens local Zimbabwean poor quality content, that nobody watches, but he can afford to pay himself that huge salary without regard for the viewers of his employees. The National Railways boss, who passed away a few months ago, was the same. The ZUPCO CEO who has been placed on suspension for financial misconduct, paying himself and not the employes. I can go on, it is the same in all parastatals in Zimbabwe. As Botha says it, black people cannot rule themselves.\n\nWe owed to ourselves and to our independence to rule and govern ourselves with utmost integrity so that we could silence our detractors. Unfortunately, we have gone and proven them right. They can boast, that they knew that black people were good for nothing. Can we say they are wrong? These are my own sentiments, I will not go further.\n\nBotha’s Speech -1985\n\nHe is famously quoted during this time as saying “This uprising will bring out the beast in us”. On 19 May 1986, frustrated by increasing ANC-backed agitation which was fuelling many elements of the disorder, the president called for air strikes against selected targets in Lusaka, Harare, and Gaborone. These included the offices of known ANC activists who had been living in Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana. Botha charged that these raids were just a “first instalment” and showed that “South Africa has the capacity and the will to break the [African National Congress].” Four days earlier, he had publicly warned neighbouring states known as open supporters of the organisation away from “unsolicited interference” in his nation’s affairs.\n\nTHE FOLLOWING is a speech made by former South African President P.W. Botha to his Cabinet. This reprint was written by David G. Mailu for the Sunday Times, a South African newspaper, dated August 18, 1985.\n\n“Pretoria has been made by the White mind for the White man. We are not obliged even the least to try to prove to anybody and to the Blacks that we are superior people. We have demonstrated that to the Blacks in a thousand and one ways. The Republic of South Africa that we know of today has not been created by wishful thinking. We have created it at the expense of intelligence, sweat and blood. Were they Afrikaners who tried to eliminate the Australian Aborigines? Are they Afrikaners who discriminate against Blacks and call them Nigge*rs in the States? Were they Afrikaners who started the slave trade? Where is the Black man appreciated? England discriminates against its Black and their “Sus” law is out to discipline the Blacks. Canada, France, Russia, and Japan all play their discrimination too. Why in the hell then is so much noise made about us? Why are they biased against us? I am simply trying to prove to you all that there is nothing unusual we are doing that the so called civilized worlds are not doing. We are simply an honest people who have come out aloud with a clear philosophy of how we want to live our own White life.\n\nWe do not pretend like other Whites that we like Blacks. The fact that, Blacks look like human beings and act like human beings do not necessarily make them sensible human beings. Hedgehogs are not porcupines and lizards are not crocodiles simply because they look alike. If God wanted us to be equal to the Blacks, he would have created us all of a uniform colour and intellect. But he created us differently: Whites, Blacks, Yellow, Rulers and the ruled. Intellectually, we are superior to the Blacks; that has been proven beyond any reasonable doubt over the years. I believe that the Afrikaner is an honest, God fearing person, who has demonstrated practically the right way of being. Nevertheless, it is comforting to know that behind the scenes, Europe, America, Canada, Australia-and all others are behind us in spite of what they say. For diplomatic relations, we all know what language should be used and where. To prove my point, Comrades, does anyone of you know a White country without an investment or interest in South Africa? Who buys our gold? Who buys our diamonds? Who trades with us? Who is helping us develop other nuclear weapon? The very truth is that we are their people and they are our people. It’s a big secret. The strength of our economy is backed by America, Britain, Germany. It is our strong conviction, therefore, that the Black is the raw material for the White man. So Brothers and Sisters, let us join hands together to fight against this Black devil. I appeal to all Afrikaners to come out with any creative means of fighting this war. Surely God cannot forsake his own people whom we are. By now every one of us has seen it practically that the Blacks cannot rule themselves. Give them guns and they will kill each other. They are good in nothing else but making noise, dancing, marrying many wives and indulging in sex. Let us all accept that the Black man is the symbol of poverty, mental inferiority, laziness and emotional incompetence. Isn’t it plausible? therefore that the White man is created to rule the Black man? Come to think of what would happen one day if you woke up and on the throne sat a Kaff*ir! Can you imagine what would happen to our women? Does anyone of you believe that the Blacks can rule this country?\n\nHence, we have good reasons to let them all-the Mandelas-rot in prison, and I think we should be commended for having kept them alive in spite of what we have at hand with which to finish them off. I wish to announce a number of new strategies that should be put to use to destroy this Black bug. We should now make use of the chemical weapon. Priority number one, we should not by all means allow any more increases of the Black population lest we be choked very soon. I have exciting news that our scientists have come with an efficient stuff. I am sending out more researchers to the field to identify as many venues as possible where the chemical weapons could be employed to combat any further population increases. The hospital is a very strategic opening, for example and should be fully utilized. The food supply channel should be used. We have developed excellent slow killing poisons and fertility destroyers. Our only fear is in case such stuff came in! ! to their hands as they are bound to start using it against us if you care to think of the many Blacks working for us in our homes.\n\nHowever, we are doing the best we can to make sure that the stuff remains strictly in our hands. Secondly, most Blacks are vulnerable to money inducements. I have set aside a special fund to exploit this venue. The old trick of divide and rule is still very valid today. Our experts should work day and night to set the Black man against his fellowman. His inferior sense of morals can be exploited beautifully. And here is a creature that lacks foresight. There is a need for us to combat him in long term projections that he cannot suspect. The average Black does not plan his life beyond a year: that stance, for example, should be exploited. My special department is already working round the clock to come out with a long-term operation blueprint. I am also sending a special request to all Afrikaner mothers to double their birth rate. It may be necessary too to set up a population boom industry by putting up centres where we employ and support fully White young men and women to produce children for the nation. We are also investigating the merit of uterus rentals as a possible means of speeding up the growth of our population through surrogate mothers.\n\nFor the time being, we should also engage a higher gear to make sure that Black men are separated from their women and fines imposed upon married wives who bear illegitimate children.\n\nI have a committee working on finding better methods of inciting Blacks against each other and encouraging murders among themselves. Murder cases among Blacks should bear very little punishment in order to encourage them.\n\nMy scientists have come up with a drug that could be smuggled into their brews to effect slow poisoning results and fertility destruction. Working through drinks and manufacturing of soft drinks geared to the Blacks, could promote the channels of reducing their population. Ours is not a war that we can use the atomic bomb to destroy the Blacks, so we must use our intelligence to effect this. The person-to-person encounter can be very effective.\n\nAs the records show that the Black man is dying to go to bed with the White woman, here is our unique opportunity. Our Sex Mercenary Squad should go out and camouflage with Apartheid Fighters while doing their operations quietly administering slow killing poison and fertility destroyers to those Blacks they thus befriend.\n\nWe are modifying the Sex Mercenary Squad by introducing White men who should go for the militant Black woman and any other vulnerable Black woman. We have received a new supply of prostitutes from Europe and America who are desperate and too keen to take up the appointments.\n\nMy latest appeal is that the maternity hospital operations should be intensified. We are not paying those people to help bring Black babies to this world but to eliminate them on the very delivery moment. If this department worked very efficiently, a great deal could be achieved."
