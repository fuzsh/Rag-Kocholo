Botha died there in October, 2006.\n\nThe Star reports that locals are speculating that the \"Groot Krokodil,\" as Botha was known, is angry because his home was sold to a black person.\n\nBotha's ghost reportedly wanders the corridors or sits in the former president's old office.\n\nAn employee of a local tourist resort, Pieter, says he is convinced the ghost of the \"old boss\" is still around.\n\n\"He was not keen on black people,\" says Piet.\n\nNtsaluba initially bought the home for historical reasons, saying that he believed Botha would have approved of the sale.\n\n\"I can't speak for him, but I think he would have been sad if it had fallen into foreign hands,\" he said.\n\nFormer president Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu met Botha at the house in 1998, where they unsuccessfully attempted to persuade him to testify in front of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission."
