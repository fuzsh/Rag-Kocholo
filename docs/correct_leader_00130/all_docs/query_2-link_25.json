        "text": "PW Botha, the former prime minister and president of South Africa, long known as \"the great crocodile\", died last night at his home in the village of Wilderness, in the Western Cape.\n\nA member of his security staff, Captain Frikkie Lucas, said: \"Botha died at home, peacefully.\" He was 90. His second wife Barbara found him dead in bed just after 8pm. He had seemed to be in good health.\n\nThe African National Congress, which now rules South Africa but which was outlawed as a terrorist organisation under Mr Botha, was one of the first organisations to offer condolences - in a symbol of how the new multiracial South Africa is trying to heal the wounds of its apartheid past.\n\n\"The African National Congress extends its sympathies and condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of former president PW Botha, who passed away this evening. The ANC wishes his family strength and comfort at this difficult time,\" it said in a statement.\n\nPieter Willem Botha saw South Africa descend into anarchy under his watch as he kept a tough line against what he called the \"total onslaught\" of communism and its partners in Africa's black liberation movements, leading South Africa through its worst racial violence and deepest international isolation.\n\nHe will be remembered as South Africa's \"securocrat\" - a man with a legendary temper who tried to bring a \"total strategy\" to bear on his perceived enemies, the black people of South Africa, whom he believed were waging a \"total onslaught\" against the state. As part of this strategy he created a hidden form of government, the \"national management system\", made up of the military, which shadowed their civilian counterparts.\n\nHe is widely believed to have been responsible for the setting up of hit squads which conducted a murderous campaign against anti-apartheid activists. And it is also suspected that he signed a pact with Israel which included the transfer of military technology and the manufacture of a least six atom bombs.\n\nMr Botha suffered a stroke in 1989, as a result of which he was forced out of power by his successor, FW De Klerk, who was, by Mr Botha's standards, a reformist.\n\nThe number of deaths for which Mr Botha carries \"command\" responsibility will never be known. But under his government the security forces killed more than 2,000 people, and an estimated 25,000 people were detained without trial and often tortured.\n\nBut black South Africa has treated him with surprising leniency. Nelson Mandela has credited to Mr Botha for the \"critical role\" he played in South Africa's transition to a non-racial democracy.\n\nIn 1994 Mr Botha refused to testify before Archbishop Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, describing it as a \"circus\". He was convicted of contempt of the commission and fined, but successfully appealed.\n\nMr Botha was first elected an MP in 1948, when the National party came to power under DF Malan. In 1983, five years after becoming prime minister, he introduced a constitution for a \"tri-cameral\" parliament in which whites, coloureds and Indians were given representation. He was elected the first state president under this constitution. In 1986 he made perhaps his biggest blunder, his infamous \"Rubicon\" speech. He had been expected to announce a reform programme, but instead famously wagged his finger at the cameras and warned the world that he would not surrender to pressure.\n\nThis speech was the straw which broke the camel's back as far as the international community was concerned, and a number of important financial institutions withdrew investments. The South African currency collapsed as a result.\n\nIn his own words\n\n路 Where in the whole wide world today can you find a more just society than South Africa has?' (1976)\n\n路 The separation of races happened long before the nationalist government. God separated the races' (1984)\n\n路 'I'll keep order in South Africa and nobody in the world is going to stop me' (1985)\n\n路 I switch off the lights and sleep within a few minutes. I never take a guilty conscience with me to bed' (1987)"
