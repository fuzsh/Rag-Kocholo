        "text": "“From 1960 to 1983 3.5 million non white South africans were taken from their home and were involuntarily put into segregated neighborhood made for them.”(rights). 1970, non whites South Africans were not allowed apart on the political side of South Africa. They were banned from doing anything with the whites of South africa; The non whites were stripped of their citizenship. About that time Nelson Mandela was 25 years old, he became involved with politics. He became a part of the ANC, or the African National Congress. The ANC began going on strikes and boycotting after the general election in South Africa in 1948 in which whites were only allowed to vote. “ At a rally on 22 June 1952, initiating protests for the ANC’s Defiance Campaign Against\n\nIn the 1960s, many of the colonial nations of Africa were gaining independence. The ANC was encouraged and campaigned for democracy in South Africa. They were mild campaigns at first, but as the government became more hostile, so did ANC protests. In November 1961, a military branch of the party was organized with Mandela as its head. It authorized the limited use of arms and sabotage against the government, which got the government’s attention—and its anger! Mandela went into hiding in 1964, he was captured, tried, and sentenced to life imprisonment. It was a sad day for black South Africa.\n\nArchbishop Desmond Tutu was one of these people and Doc 7 showed a 1984 speech to the United Nations Security Council where he addressed the possibility of a new society for all people in South Africa. 1984 was the year P.W. Botha became president and began his police state and South Africa was still yet to see the worst atrocities of the Apartheid struggle. Tutu believed that the only reason the whites in South Africa were cruel to the blacks was because they were scared; they were outnumbered and after the ancestors of the white population had fought against the natives for decades their fear was only reinforced through stories of the barbaric Africans. They were also scared that if given the opportunity the blacks would drive them out of South Africa and out of their land of birth. Tutu suggested a new nation in which all people were equal as they were created in the image of god and where the government was truly democratic. Because Desmond Tutu had lived through the entire period of Apartheid and was a leader of the back christian community in South Africa he would have seen and understood the feelings the people of South Africa had toward Apartheid. He would have also strived to implicate Christian beliefs of equality back into the hearts of the white people and end the use of violence. One year before Desmond Tutu's speech a new political party formed called the United Democratic Front. This party was a non-racial and anti-Apartheid organization which specifically opposed the Tricameral parliament which allowed coloured and asian south Africans minimal representation while the black population was still excluded. The Poster for the United Democratic front shown in Doc 9 gave an image to the blacks in South Africa that\n\nThese huge happenings both removed the global communist threat and freed people from injustices, which created an illusion that the entire world was listening in on South Africa, expecting a revolutionary change. From the very beginning protesters, especially Nelson Mandela himself, were influenced by Gandhi and his Satyagraha campaign in India as it was in several ways a similar fight. They both took place in countries that had been colonised by Great Britain, they both fought against the discrimination and oppression of the population and were both led by world-renowned leaders that shared fundamental ideas of unity and compassion. However, Gandhi’s philosophy wasn’t something Mandela followed meticulously. One of the major differences between their methods of ruling is that Mandela used violence at times, as it came to a point where he saw it as a necessity. It is important to note that without Gandhi’s fight in India, the protesters in South Africa may never have had motivation enough to see the potential they held, and what a difference they could make by\n\nThe life story of Nelson Mandela has long become a legend, a story that transcends race, borders, culture, or language. He is one of the greatest leaders to ever step foot on this Earth. He was willing to give up his own personal freedoms for the good of his people. Still, his decisions at major points in his lifetime hold lessons for individuals who are inspired of becoming good leaders. Many leaders are inspired by the actions and decision-makings abilities of Mandela. He kept the interest of others before his own. This is what made Nelson Mandela a great leader, and worthy of winning a Nobel Prize. From the decisions he made, and his life experiences while fighting for human rights, one can conclude that Mandela is truly\n\nMay 1994, Mandela was inaugurated as the first black president of South Africa. He held this post for five years. During his presidency the country moved away from minority rule and apartheid, he earned the respect throughout the world for the work on conflict resolution both within the country and internationally. Mandela spent one-third of his live as a state criminal in prison because of the political views, according to which the black population of South Africa should have the same rights as white population. It’s the same of Gandhi to the congress to the freedom. On my conclusion this are really good for this important people to get recognized on his country and be a better of one nation, the sacrifice of this person needs to be recognized and the Nobel prize it’s the all of the needed, that it’s my conclusion of this paragraph of the important people and they what do for his nation. The freedom for\n\nOne large problem that occurred because of apartheid and was the cause of many protests was from 1961-1994, 3.5 million colored people and their families were forced out of their homes while their property was sold for very low prices to white farmers. This was just one example of events that were completely unfair to the colored population. Nelson Mandela was the person who stopped these acts from happening. In 1994, Mandela became the country’s first colored president. Instead of trying to make the people who put him into jail for 27 years suffer in consequences, he embraced them and used peace to unite everyone as equals, and not oppressing the people who had oppressed him for most of his life. Apartheid was a very rough time for anyone who lived in South Africa before Nelson Mandela and his peace helped to stop it.\n\nImagine being systematically oppressed from the moment you exited the womb. All your civil rights, based on the amount of melanin in your skin. Drinking from the wrong water fountain, could even get you thrown into jail. Coincidently; this was the life, of black South Africans from the moment of Dutch colonization in 1652, to the first true democratic election in 1994. Apartheid, meaning “separateness” in Afrikaans; was legal segregation enforced by The National Party (NP) from 1948 to 1994. It legally imposed preexisting policies of racial discrimination on the Majority of the South African population. The entire basis of the racist policies, was the darker your complexion the less legal rights you had. Presumably this injustice, could have continued much longer if it weren’t for all involved in the fight against the NP, however the man who arguably contributed the most, was Nelson Mandela. He ended an apartheid, with both his philanthropy and political prowess. He united a nation that used to be segregated; which seemed a daunting task at the time, but through the sweat and bloodshed he achieved the impossible. This alone exhibited his heroic characteristics, but to be more precise: both his actions and inactions lead to his success. Furthermore, Mandela was both a strong leader and forgiving at the same-time. Being in the forefront of the abolishment movement, was an extremely risky move during the apartheid. He risked his life for what he believed in, and this personal"
