        "text": "Terms of Sale:\n\nWe are professional booksellers, autograph dealers, and antiquarians (members of the ABAA & ILAB) who began in business in 1969. We pride ourselves on providing books, autographs, art, and artifacts in the Best Available Condition (typically Fine, Very interesting, Scarce, or Unusual items).\n\nOur descriptions strive to be scrupulously accurate. Whenever possible, we detail flaws, include photographs of stock listed (rather than \"stock photos\"), and provide some background on the authors, creators...\n\nMore Information\n\nShipping Terms:\n\nAll our books and items are carefully packed. They are usually shipped in Manilla padded-envelopes or sturdy boxes with additional bubble wrap, styrofoam \"popcorn,\" or other protective layers. We strive to ship within 24 hours of receiving orders--allowing extra time for weekends or holidays.\n\nBooks shipped within the United States are usually shipped via USPS Media Mail. Postal charges for Media Mail typically run from $3.17 to around $5. When site-posted charges--usually $4.95--exceed actual USPS charges, any overage helps to defray our packaging and shipping costs.\n\nThose books requiring extra-swift transport or -care are often shipped via USPS Priority Mail. Postage charges usually average $13.50 for up to precisely 2 pounds, but rapidly escalate thus possibly making it necessary to contact clients.\n\nAutographs & manuscripts, art & artifacts are usually shipped in stout boxes with padding and reinforcement. Because Media Mail rates do not then apply, we normally use USPS Priority mail, but also ship via UPS and FedEx. Extra charges for insurance are often necessary for valuable items.\n\nOverseas' shipments (as to Europe) weighing with packaging Not more than 2 pounds usually incur postage charges of between $13.50 to $25. Those between 2 - 4 pounds average around $35. Packages of more than 4 pounds usually need to be quoted."
