        "text": "Clue – noun — anything that serves to guide or direct in the solution of a problem, mystery, etc.\n\n* * *\n\nAccording to the online Merriam-Webster dictionary\n\n‘The word clue was originally a variant spelling of clew, meaning “ball of thread or yarn.” Our modern sense of clue, “guide to the solution of a mystery,” grows out of a motif in myth and folklore, the ball of thread that helps in finding one’s way out of a maze. ‘\n\nThe “ball of thread” mentioned in the M-W etymology refers to one of my favorite stories in Greek mythology.\n\nThe Clue of Ariadne\n\nIt all started when there was a war between Crete and Athens. Crete won the war, and the rather sadistic King Minos of Crete exacted a horrible punishment on the Athenians. He required that the king of Athens periodically send seven young men and seven young women to the Isle of Crete to become dinner for the horrible monster, the Minotaur.\n\nThe Big M was housed inside a labyrinth constructed by none other than the ingenious Daedalus. The labyrinth was so large and complex that it served as a prison for the Minotaur. When the poor Athenian sacrifices arrived, they would be forced into the maze. At some point in their wanderings, they’d encounter the Minotaur, and things wouldn’t go well for them.\n\nAfter this horrific nonsense went on for a few years, a young man named Theseus, the son of the Athenian king, decided enough was enough. He vowed to put a stop to the awful goings-on by sailing to Crete, entering the labyrinth, and killing the Minotaur. That was a noble plan, but it had one problem: the labyrinth was so complicated, he probably wouldn’t find his way out.\n\nThat’s when our heroine, Ariadne, entered the picture. Ariadne was the daughter of King Minos, and she fell in love with the dashing Theseus. He promised to marry her if she could figure out a way to get him back out of the labyrinth after he offed Mr. M. (At this point, I feel compelled to say that without Ariadne, Theseus was clueless.)\n\nI truly love simple solutions to complicated problems, and I especially admire people who come up with them. That Ariadne was a problem-solver for the ages. She handed her true love a ball of thread, known as a clew, and told him to unwind it as he wandered around in the labyrinth. Then after he killed the Minotaur, he could just rewind it as he followed it out. Brilliant. And it worked!\n\nSounds like a Happy Ever After kind of ending, eh? Unfortunately, that scumbag Theseus broke his promise and didn’t marry the beautiful Ariadne, but I think she won out in the end. She got to go down in history as the very first mystery solver, and that’s endeared her to millions of readers through the years, whether they knew her name or not.\n\n* * *\n\nClues in a modern mystery are a little more sophisticated than a simple ball of thread, and detectives do more (at least we hope they do) than just wander around until they find the culprit.\n\nHowever, there is one major similarity in our mysteries to the story of Theseus: the detective and the readers are led into a labyrinth. Only this one is constructed by the author. The answer to the mystery is within the maze, but the detective needs to know which clues to follow and which are red herrings.\n\nI liked some of the clue categories listed on zaraaltair.com:\n\nPhysical clues: A gun or knife left at the scene of the murder. Maybe a button torn off. Of course, the villain can plant a clue at the scene to misdirect the detective.\n\nBiological clues: Strands of hair, DNA, fingerprints.\n\nPsychological clues: Profilers try to identify the type of person likely to commit a murder, but the detective uses his/her own knowledge of human nature to decide on suspects.\n\nTiming clues: This is one of my favorites. Alibis are established based on the time of death, but clever villains might be able to manipulate that piece of evidence. A smashed watch is always a good clue that might be a red herring.\n\nClues of Omission: Another favorite. Something should be evident, but it isn’t. There’s a famous example from the Sherlock Holmes mystery “The Adventure of Silver Blaze” by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Holmes (naturally) notices something everyone else has missed.\n\nGregory (Scotland Yard detective): Is there any other point to which you would wish to draw my attention?\n\nHolmes: To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.\n\nGregory: The dog did nothing in the night-time.\n\nHolmes: That was the curious incident.\n\nI don’t know about you, but if I can include clues in such a way the reader finishes the story and slaps him/herself on the side of the head, thinking, “I should have seen it,” then I’ll be happy.\n\n* * *\n\nSo TKZers: How do you decide what clues to have in your mystery novels? What clues have inspired you?\n\nIn Lacey’s Star, there’s only one clue to the murder, but it’s just a child’s note. It couldn’t be important. Could it?\n\nLacey’s Star is a Silver Falchion Award Top Pick (Cozy Mystery) at Killer Nashville.\n\nOn sale now at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Kobo, Google Play, or Apple Books.\n\nDeuteragonist – noun — the actor next in importance to the protagonist.\n\n* * *\n\nWe all know what a protagonist and an antagonist are, but I had never heard the word “deuteragonist” until a few months ago. It comes from the Greek word “deuteros,” meaning “second.” But a deuteragonist is not just a secondary character, he/she is the secondary character.\n\nWikipedia tells us that ancient Greek drama originally had only one actor, the protagonist, and a group of dancers, the chorus. But then the playwright Aeschylus introduced a second character, the deuteragonist, in his plays.\n\nAristotle explained it in his work Poetics.\n\n“Thus, it was Aeschylus who first raised the number of the actors from one to two. He also curtailed the chorus and made the dialogue be the leading part.”\n\nSo we can thank Aeschylus, who lived 2500 years ago, for the addition of the second character in drama, an innovation which enabled dialogue and conflict.\n\n* * *\n\n“The more complex you make your secondary characters, the more lifelike and involving your story will be.” –Donald Maass\n\nSo how is the deuteragonist different from the other secondary characters in today’s fiction?\n\nAccording to studiobinder.com\n\n“A deuteragonist is the second most important character in a story. This person is also known as the ‘secondary main character.’ While the protagonist gives us our primary point of view of the story, the deuteragonist often provides a different, but often similar, outlook.”\n\n* * *\n\nThe deuteragonist can serve different purposes, depending on the author’s goals. But whatever role the deuteragonist plays, he/she should complement the protagonist in a way that affects the main character’s arc in the story.\n\nOne possibility is as a supporter, friend, or assistant to the protagonist. Dr. Watson is a famous example of this type of deuteragonist in the Sherlock Holmes books. Watson not only narrates the stories, his gentlemanly compassion contrasts nicely with the purely logical Holmes.\n\nThe deuteragonist can also be a love interest. An example of this could be from the movie “Titanic” where Jack Dawson (Leonardo DeCaprio) plays the main secondary to Rose (Kate Winslet). In the movie, Jack shows Rose there is more to life than the suffocating high society she’s being forced into.\n\nVillains are always useful in helping protagonists overcome their shortcomings and face down danger. An example of this was the film “Die Hard” where the protagonist John McClane (Bruce Willis) matches wits with the villainous deuteragonist Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman.)\n\nSo there you have it. A deuteragonist can add spice and complexity to a story while enhancing the protagonist’s character arc.\n\n* * *\n\n“The three things that matter most in a story are characters, characters and characters.” –Bob Gale\n\n* * *\n\nSo TKZers: Are there deuteragonists that you like from books or films? Have you used a deuteragonist in any of your stories? Do you plan to? Tell us about them.\n\n* * *\n\nProtagonist Kathryn Frasier trains for a marathon, deuteragonist Cece Goldman rehearses for a play, and antagonist murderers hide in plain sight in The Watch Mysteries, an ebook boxset of three complete novels available at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Kobo, Google Play, or Apple Books. (Today is the last day of the 99¢ sale.)\n\nA little perspective, like a little humor, goes a long way. —Allen Klein\n\n* * *\n\nMy first two novels were written in third person. Each scene had one POV character and the verb tense was consistent throughout the scene.\n\nBut when I began my third novel, Time After Tyme, I decided to try something new. I gave one character a first-person POV in her scenes. The rest of the scenes were in third person. I discovered the power of first person in that novel, and I fell in love with it.\n\n“You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view … until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.” –Atticus Finch, To Kill a Mockingbird\n\n* * *\n\nI enjoyed writing first person so much that my fourth novel, Lacey’s Star, and the fifth (a yet-to-be-published middle grade effort), are written in first person from the main character’s POV. To me, first person is especially effective because the narration is a conversation (albeit one-sided) between the narrator and the reader. The narrator relays the story in his/her own words.\n\nBut there’s something else that’s special about first person that I think connects the reader to the story in a unique way. It’s a topic that I don’t recall having been discussed here on TKZ, so I’d like to raise it now. It has to do with verb tense.\n\n* * *\n\nExample 1 from the classic by J.D. Salinger.\n\nThe Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger\n\n“They kicked me out. I wasn’t supposed to come back after Christmas vacation, on account of I was flunking four subjects and not applying myself and all. They gave me frequent warning to start applying myself—especially around midterms, when my parents came up for a conference with old Thurmer—but I didn’t do it. So I got the ax. They give guys the ax quite frequently at Pencey. It has a very good academic rating, Pencey. It really does.”\n\nDid you see how the author switched from past tense to present so the character can move from telling the events of the story to offering a personal opinion? It’s as if the character wants to share a little detail with the reader, so he turns directly to the audience and hands out some extra information. This ability to offer side comments in the character’s voice seems to me to be unique in first person, and it shows an aspect of the character that may not work if the author stays with past tense.\n\nWhen I was working on my first-person novels, I didn’t realize I was using exactly this technique, but someone with editing experience reviewed some of my work and told me the tense had to agree all the way through each scene. I didn’t see it that way, so I went looking for examples that used the first-person past / present approach. In addition to The Catcher in the Rye, I found lots of other examples, and they convinced my friend this was a valid approach.\n\nExample 2 from a highly-regarded Middle Grade novel.\n\nThe Remarkable Journey of Coyote Sunrise by Dan Gemeinhart\n\n“Once upon a time, it was hot and I was sweaty. It was about five months before my thirteenth birthday, give or take. We were someplace in Oregon. Honestly, I don’t even remember the name of the town, but I know it was on the dry, hot side of the state, away from the ocean.”\n\nExample 3 where John D. MacDonald gives his main character, Travis McGee, so many opinions to share in present tense that I had a hard time deciding which one to pick.\n\nThe Deep Blue Good-By by John D. MacDonald\n\n“The next morning, after making laundry arrangements, I untethered my bike and pedaled to the garage where I keep Miss Agnes sheltered from brine and sun. She needs tender loving care in her declining years. I believe she is the only Rolls Royce in America which has been converted into a pickup truck.”\n\nExample 4 from an American classic.\n\nThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain\n\n“After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn’t care no more about him, because I don’t take no stock in dead people.”\n\nAnd finally, Example 5 from our own JSB.\n\nRomeo’s Justice by James Scott Bell\n\n“Which is why I owed her that blasted thing called honesty. I never want Sophie to have any illusions about this piece of work called Romeo.”\n\nSo, there you have it. Examples of past and present tense, each within one paragraph, and all from masters of writing. Novl.org has a nice summation:\n\n“We use tenses every day naturally as part of speech. While consistency is key when maintaining narrative voice, it’s important to remember that you can play around with tense for interesting narrative effect. Whatever you do, just make sure you choose the option that best serves your story.”\n\n“Whatever you do, just make sure you choose the option that best serves your story.” I like that.\n\n* * *\n\nSo TKZers: Do you write in first person? Have you noticed the use of both past and present tense in first person narratives? Will the two tenses work in third person? Any reflections on the examples above?\n\n* * *\n\nPrivate pilot Cassie Deakin offers a first-person opinion right from the get-go in Lacey’s Star:\n\n“I do not like handsome men… Like the one sitting in the passenger seat of my Cessna 172 while I did the run-up prior to takeoff. Frank White.”\n\nBuy on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Kobo, Google Play, or Apple Books.\n\nCome what may, all bad fortune is to be conquered by endurance. –Virgil\n\n* * *\n\nWriting a novel is often compared to running a marathon, and my experience dealing with the unexpected in the London Marathon in April 2010 was a good rehearsal for my later efforts in writing.\n\nI’ve never been a good marathon runner. I’m better suited for the half-marathon. But in 2009, having completed three marathons (San Antonio, Vancouver, and Toronto), I decided I’d go for just one more. And I wanted to run one of the big marathons for that once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\nI told my husband I’d like to celebrate our anniversary in 2010 with a trip to the UK where I would run the London Marathon in honor of our marriage. Then we could spend a week or so vacationing. Frank was supportive, and for some unknown reason, I was convinced everything would go my way.\n\nHmm.\n\nThe major marathons are so popular that they can’t admit everyone who wants to enter. If you’re a very good runner and can meet the qualifying time for your age group, you’ll be entered. But if you’re like most runners (me, for instance) and can’t meet the qualifying time, they’ll put your name into a lottery and it’s just a matter of chance.\n\nSo when they opened the online registration in April 2009, I jumped in and registered along with 150,000 other runners. Although only about a quarter of those would get places, I was ridiculously confident. Around October, I received an email from the London Marathon notifying me that I wasn’t chosen. Rats.\n\nBut they held out another possibility. I could run for a charity. “That’s even better,” I thought. I could do a good deed as well as run the marathon. So I applied to several of the charities that I thought I’d like to support, and a few weeks later, one of them called. With about four months to go, I had cleared the first hurdle. I was in the race.\n\nI was sure that from then on everything would be smooth sailing. (You can smile now.)\n\nMy running buddies at work were all excited that I was going to run the London, and that made me even more determined to do well. When they asked what kind of time I was planning on, I spouted off a near-impossible-for-me number. But if everything went perfectly, maybe I could make it.\n\nEverything did not go perfectly.\n\nOur treadmill, on which I was doing almost half of my training, broke. We needed a new one anyway, so we bought a bigger, better model. A few days of training lost.\n\nI injured my knee in a tempo run. A couple of weeks of training lost.\n\nI had stumbled over those first hurdles, but my excitement continued to ramp up as the days ticked closer to the race. Since I suffer from jetlag on international trips, we planned to fly to London six days prior to the marathon to allow my body to adjust to the time change before the race. But then…disaster.\n\nA few days before our scheduled departure, I woke up to the news that a volcano in Iceland had erupted, volcanic ash was drifting over western Europe, and airports were closing. Heathrow was one of them. Our flight was cancelled.\n\nYou can overcome a lot of obstacles. But a volcano? Time to throw in the towel.\n\nBut then the winds shifted, and airports reopened. We managed to get on a flight that put us in London in the early morning hours of Friday before Sunday’s race day. Okay, so my jetlag would be a problem, but the excitement of the race would probably overcome that. (Are you laughing yet?)\n\nI dragged myself out of bed on race day after just a few hours of sleep to discover there were more obstacles: the weather was warm (not good) and it was drizzling rain (super not good). Frank and I agreed on where we’d meet after the race, and he walked me to the starting area to join the other thirty-seven thousand people who had paid perfectly good money to punish their bodies for 26.2 miles.\n\nBut at least I had made it to the starting line. Now all I had to do was finish.\n\nThe London Marathon is unique. It’s a big party, and many of the marathoners wear costumes. One guy was dressed in a full suit of armor and someone else was carrying a huge replica of the Angel of the North sculpture on his back.\n\nAs time ticked down to the start, you could feel the buzz in the air. After an entire year of waiting, hoping, training, and planning, the starter’s pistol fired, and we were off.\n\nI wish I could say everything went well.\n\nFor the first time ever, my GPS watch malfunctioned. Bad omen.\n\nAnother first: I got a side stitch. At least now I can describe in a book what it feels like to be stabbed just below the ribs.\n\nAs the miles went on, fatigue set in, and I realized I was getting a blister on one of my heels.\n\nBy the time I got to the eighteen-mile mark, I was starving. I guess the time change had messed up my body clock. Honestly, if I had seen a child holding a sandwich by the side of the course, I probably would have snatched it out of the kid’s hand and run away before anyone could catch me. But there were no sandwiches, my back and foot hurt, and I was run-walking so slow that I knew I was going to turn in a terrible time.\n\n* * *\n\nThat’s when I had THE THOUGHT. I could quit. I could just step off the course, find a volunteer to give me a cart-ride to the finish, and it would be over. I wouldn’t suffer the embarrassment of a poor showing. I’d just tell everybody I was injured and couldn’t finish. I could bandage my foot and take an Advil and eat a steak dinner and forget this stupid marathon. The whole thing was wrong from the start. Why hadn’t I seen that? Why did I have to be so stubborn when there were just too many problems to overcome?\n\nThat little exercise in self-pity and frustration got me through the next mile or two. Then I had the SECOND THOUGHT. I would cross the finish line even if I had to crawl. Even if I was the last person across. Even if they had taken down the banners and all the volunteers had gone home and I didn’t get a medal or a T-shirt. Even if my feet were bleeding so profusely that I was leaving a trail of blood behind me on the course. (Self-martyrdom can be useful in certain situations.)\n\nAnd I knew no matter how long it took, Frank would be waiting for me, and I knew exactly what he’d say when he saw me. After all, this was the race to honor our marriage, not to show off my great (ha!) running talent.\n\nThose reflections got me through another mile or two, and then I was within just a few miles of the finish, so it didn’t make sense to quit.\n\nI crossed the finish line. I didn’t crawl, and I wasn’t the last person in the race. There were still a couple of thousand people behind me, including angel sculpture man and the guy in the suit of armor. A volunteer hung a medal around my neck and someone else handed me a T-shirt that said “LonDONE 25.04.10.” Then I walked into the meeting area and saw Frank waving. As I limped toward him with my hair frizzy from the rain and my clothes damp with sweat, he jogged over and put his arm around me. “Great race, honey.”\n\n* * *\n\nSo yeah. Writing a novel, especially a first one, is a lot like running a marathon. You start out with all this enthusiasm and confidence, but then things get hard, much harder than you thought. There are unexpected challenges, and it’s discouraging when agents and publishers don’t immediately see your genius and rush to sign you to a life-long contract.\n\nThat’s when many people give up. They hit the wall and decide it’s not worth all the pain and disappointment. According to selfpublishingus.com, only about 3% of people who start writing a book actually finish it. And of those, even fewer have their book published. But for those of us who stay in the race, there’s a satisfaction of accomplishment few have known.\n\nI learned some lessons from the London Marathon that I believe apply to my writing.\n\nLife (and running and writing) is more about what you put into it than what you get out.\n\nIt’s more about fighting the good fight than winning.\n\nIt’s more about the journey than the destination.\n\nYou value what you earn more than what someone gives you.\n\nAnd in the long run (pun intended), whether it’s running or writing or living, endurance is more important than talent.\n\n* * *\n\nThis has been a very long TKZ blog post, and if you made it to the end, you deserve a medal.

Nothing at all interesting about it. Though we want our stories to mimic real life, showing every moment or mile gets boring and repetitive fast.\n\nMy characters are constantly on the move. If I showed the entire drive, boat ride, or flight, I’d destroy the pacing. Instead, move characters from point A to B by skipping the boring parts.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nWhen we jump ahead, tell the reader how much time has passed.\n\nNothing is more jarring than a character at home one minute and in the next paragraph they’re in a new location with no explanation of how they got there. Ground the reader in the first sentence. Or at least, in the first paragraph. Some writers include a scene break between paragraphs — either white space or *** — but that still does not absolve us from orienting the reader.\n\nShow the characters getting into the car. Add a few lines of plot-related dialogue or trees zip past the window to show movement. And boom, they arrive at their new destination. Or, if nothing interesting happens, write something like…\n\nForty grueling minutes later without air conditioner, I arrived at the hotel with a wet scalp and my t-shirt molded to my chest.\n\nA new chapter signals a time or POV change and/or a new setting.\n\nIt’s fine to speed past uneventful stretches in a story. In fact, it’s encouraged. Just be sure to give the reader a sense of how much time has lapsed, especially at the start of a new chapter. Even if we include a timestamp, we should still mention it as many readers will only recall whether the previous chapter took place during daylight or darkness.\n\nDon’t make them have to backtrack to guess where or when the chapter begins.\n\nIf the action continues from the previous chapter, it’s still a good idea to set the scene with a brief mention of any time gaps or sensory cue to ground the reader. It doesn’t have to be complicated. “A few hours later” does the trick.\n\nEstablish who is present in every scene.\n\nNothing irks me more than a character appearing out of nowhere to offer a clue when they weren’t in the scene earlier. Too convenient. And frankly, obvious and lazy.\n\nAgain, adding a character to a scene needn’t be complicated…\n\nThe screen door slapped open, and Jack strolled out to the porch.\n\nNow the reader knows he’s there, so when he offers that all-important clue, it makes sense within the scene.\n\nChange in POV\n\nAs a reader and a writer, I don’t understand the fad of including the POV character’s name at the top of each chapter. In my opinion, it’s unnecessary. If we ground the reader in the character’s POV right away, they should know whose head they’re in without a label. If they don’t, then we’ve failed to set the scene. I prefer rotating POVs. They’re easy to follow and add to the overall rhythm of the story.\n\nIf you want to include the POV character’s name as a chapter heading, then by all means do so. It’s your story.\n\nThe main takeaway for this post is to orient the reader, whether the characters are on the move or we switch to a new POV.\n\nFor writers: How do you handle travel or signal a change in POV?\n\nFor readers: Have you ever been jarred out of a story due to a change in space or time?\n\nHappy Memorial Day to TKZers in the U.S.!\n\nA word fitly spokenis like apples of gold in a setting of silver.\n\n–Proverbs 25:11\n\n* * *\n\nA few months ago, James Scott Bell posted Micro Fiction for Your Writer’s Brain on TKZ. It was about writing fiction that was less than 500 words long. (I’ll wait while you go back and review.)\n\nThat post gave me an idea for writing about even shorter form fiction, and I came across a few types that are both fun and challenging.\n\nThe Clerihew\n\nThe clerihew is a form of poetry that was invented by E.C. Bentley, the author of Trent’s Last Case and other novels. Bentley’s full name happens to be Edmund Clerihew Bentley. I guess when you have a middle name like Clerihew, you may as well come up with some clever and inventive use of it.\n\nHere’s the definition of clerihew from Wikipedia:\n\nA clerihew (ˈklɛrɪhjuː) is a whimsical, four-line biographical poem of a type invented by Edmund Clerihew Bentley. The first line is the name of the poem’s subject, usually a famous person, and the remainder puts the subject in an absurd light or reveals something unknown or spurious about the subject. The rhyme scheme is AABB, and the rhymes are often forced. The line length and metre are irregular. Bentley invented the clerihew in school and then popularized it in books.\n\nHere are a couple of examples:\n\nSir Humphry Davy\n\nAbominated gravy.\n\nHe lived in the odium\n\nOf having discovered sodium.\n\nDid Descartes\n\nDepart\n\nWith the thought\n\n“Therefore I’m not”?\n\nHere’s my humble attempt:\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nHad a very great mind\n\nWhile in his prime\n\nHe relativized time\n\n* * *\n\nThe Haiku\n\nBack in 2021, Steve Hooley and his sister, Joyce, wrote a wonderful TKZ post on haiku poetry.\n\nDictionary.com defines haiku as\n\na major form of Japanese verse, written in 17 syllables divided into 3 lines of 5, 7, and 5 syllables, and employing highly evocative allusions and comparisons, often on the subject of nature or one of the seasons.\n\nHere are a couple of rather famous ones:\n\n“A Caterpillar” by Matsuo Basho\n\nA caterpillar,\n\nThis deep in fall –\n\nStill not a butterfly.\n\n“A Poppy Blooms” by Katsushika Hokusai\n\nI write, erase, rewrite\n\nErase again, and then\n\nA poppy blooms.\n\nAnd another one by me:\n\nAzalea blossoms\n\nPink, but ragged on the edge\n\nTomorrow’s lovers\n\n* * *\n\nThe Limerick\n\nHere’s what Britannica.com has to say about this poetic form:\n\nLimerick, a popular form of short, humorous verse that is often nonsensical and frequently ribald. It consists of five lines, rhyming aabba, and the dominant metre is anapestic, with two metrical feet in the third and fourth lines and three feet in the others. The origin of the limerick is unknown, but it has been suggested that the name derives from the chorus of an 18th-century Irish soldiers’ song, “Will You Come Up to Limerick?” To this were added impromptu verses crowded with improbable incident and subtle innuendo.\n\nHere’s a non-ribald example.\n\nA tutor who taught on the flute\n\nTried to teach two tooters to toot.\n\nSaid the two to the tutor,\n\n“Is it harder to toot, or\n\nTo tutor two tooters to toot?”\n\nPersonally, I love limericks. I occasionally compose one in honor of politicians or other strange creatures. 😎 I won’t share any of those, but here’s one I made up just for today:\n\nMy computer decided to die\n\nJust as the deadline drew nigh\n\nWhen the publisher screamed\n\nI knew I was creamed\n\nSo I kissed my contract good-bye\n\n* * *\n\nSo TKZers: What do you think about these poetic short forms? Pick one or two (or all three) and astound us by entering your work in the comments.

By 10 a.m. that morning, we still hadn’t heard from The Kid, which is unusual. He’s always been an early riser.\n\nSo, I shot him a text. “Still planning to come up today?”\n\nSeveral minutes dragged by before he responded. “Yes.”\n\nMy intuition tapped me on the shoulder. Something’s wrong. He never responds with one word. Besides, a simple yes didn’t give me enough information. If he brought all three grandkids, I would need to plan to feed six rather than three.\n\nPlus, I let my little fur-babies run around my office during the day, but our grandchildren have a habit of leaving doors open. So, when they visit, it’s safer to leave them in their guinea pig habitat.\n\nI texted back, “The Joe and the chicks coming, too?”\n\nAnother long pause. “Just The Joe.”\n\n“You okay? You sound… I dunno… off.”\n\nThe Kid knows I’m tuned into him. Over the years I’ve learned to trust my intuition, and it has never failed me. Lying would be pointless.\n\n“I was chasing ducks.”\n\n“Okay, cool,” I texted, but something told me “chasing ducks” wasn’t the full story. Regardless, I didn’t want to push the issue via text. “I get the feeling you won’t be staying long.”\n\n“We can stay for a bit.” The five-minute pause seemed to last twenty. “The longer the better. LOL”\n\nAnd there it was—the first hint of the real reason he seemed off. Which he’d spill in person. It’s much harder to hide behind a false façade while staring into a concerned parent’s eyes. Though I’d never want to come across as pushy—he is a grown man, after all—I can’t take it when my kid is hurting. I don’t care how old he is. I’ll always be fiercely protective of his beautiful heart.\n\nI do have a point to all this.\n\nWith that one simple word—Yes—I, the reader, knew to pay attention. That yes held power. That yes held unlimited power, more powerful than if he’d written an entire paragraph.\n\nWriters should do the same. It’s a simple but effective way to add tension to a scene, cause a disturbance, and cue the reader to pay attention. The one-word, staccato sentence is a tool used for emphasis.\n\nRun. Now.\n\nIt’s short and to the point. It calls attention to itself and exploits a reader’s emotions. Varying sentence structure holds a reader’s attention.\n\nThe following example looks like an exaggeration, but I once had to critique the first few pages of a novel written just like it.\n\nAs he stared at me, I could not look away. As I moved around the room, his stare held me hostage. As he moved closer, I told him to stop. As I backed away, he kept coming.\n\nEvery sentence began with “As” for three, never-ending pages. Not only is it grueling and repetitive, it’s annoying to read.\n\nRewrite:\n\nHis wolf-like stare held me hostage. Stop. Please stop. He moved closer. I backed away. Dear God, no. Not again. My spine hit the wall, my fingers searching behind me for the doorframe.\n\nSee how much more immediate the second example sounds? We don’t want to overdo it, but nothing can replace a well-placed staccato sentence here and there.\n\nWriters have access to a plethora of writing tips, but it’s important not to overlook simple ways to hone our craft, like the act of reading and sentence structure.\n\nThoughts?

Way back in 1970, there was a total eclipse in my hometown of Savannah, Ga. I remember the experience well, but not for the reason you may think.\n\nUnfortunately, the day was cloudy, but as the moon moved between the Earth and the sun, the clouds would occasionally break and give us a series of snapshots of the phenomenon. When the moment of totality arrived, the clouds once again opened, and we saw the black disk, then the bright flash of light as the moon moved on to continue its course. But that still wasn’t what astonished me.\n\nIt was the darkness.\n\nStanding on the front lawn of my parents’ home, I looked down the street and saw a wall of black shadow racing toward us. It wasn’t like a cloud that covered the sun. It was a dark, menacing presence, rushing forward to devour the light in its path until it overtook us, and suddenly all was night.\n\nEven though we understood what was happening, I had a sense of primordial awe that I have never forgotten.\n\n* * *\n\nAuthors of mystery, suspense, and thrillers are well acquainted with darkness. It’s a symbol of the unknown, and that usually means fear, anxiety, loneliness, or panic will grip the main character and get the reader’s heart pumping a little harder.\n\n“All great and beautiful work has come of first gazing without shrinking into the darkness.” –John Ruskin\n\nA character walks out into a black night and senses a presence that he can’t see, or comes face-to-face with his own demons in the dark night of the soul when all appears lost. That heart-stopping look into the abyss rivets the attention and keeps the reader turning pages.\n\nHere are a few examples.\n\n* * *\n\nWe probably all studied Edgar Allen Poe’s The Raven in high school. Fear and doubt consume the poet as he contemplates his own loneliness late at night. Then he hears a sound and thinks it’s a visitor knocking. He opens the door and sees … nothing.\n\n“Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before.”\n\nThe murky setting on the moors gave Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Hound of the Baskervilles a sense of mystery and foreboding.\n\n“As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon the borders of the great Grimpen Mire. It came with the wind through the silence of the night, a long, deep mutter, then a rising howl, and then the sad moan in which it died away. Again and again it sounded, the whole air throbbing with it, strident, wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness. ‘My God, what’s that, Watson?’”\n\nA sense of impending doom in Dean Koontz’s Midnight builds as a woman goes for a run on the beach in the middle of the night.\n\n“Suddenly, as she was passing a pair of forty-foot, twisted cypresses that had grown in the middle of the beach, halfway between the hills and the waterline, Janice was sure she was not alone in the night and fog. She saw no movement, and she was unaware of any sound other than her own footsteps, raspy breathing, and thudding heartbeat; only instinct told her that she had company.”\n\nLast week Kris introduced us to the Edgar finalists in her post.

Her sales are exceeded only by the Bible and the works of Shakespeare. According to her website at agathachristie.com, “She is best known for her 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections, as well as the world’s longest-running play – The Mousetrap. “\n\nAgatha Christie’s books have sold over two billion copies worldwide!\n\nGiven Ms. Christie’s extraordinary success, it might be a good idea to see if we can discover some of her secrets.\n\n* * *\n\nA few years ago, I watched a documentary entitled “The Agatha Christie Code” (available on Youtube) in which researchers examined various aspects of Christie’s writing. These researchers included\n\nDr. Richard Forsyth, Research Fellow in Applied Linguistics at the University of Warwick\n\nDr. Pernilla Danielsson, Academic Champion of Communications at the University of Birmingham\n\nDr. Marcus Dahl, Research Fellow at the School of Advanced Study – London University\n\nThey used computer technology to analyze Christie’s work, and they found interesting patterns in her stories that may give us a clue as to why she’s so popular.\n\nWord Choices\n\nChristie used simple language in her books, so readers were free to focus on the plot rather than the language. For example, the researchers found she used “said” often in an attribution rather than other words like “responded” or “answered.”\n\nChristie also often repeated words within a short section of prose – something I’ve been warned against. Here’s an example from the novel Sad Cypress that was used in the video. (My notations in red.)\n\nThe researchers thought the repetition cemented the information in the reader’s mind. My editor would probably faint if I sent something like that to her, but maybe we should rethink the multiple uses of a word in a short section of prose.\n\nVerbal Structure\n\nThe most interesting part of the video for me was when one of the researchers evaluated Christie’s works on the three criteria of\n\nWord length\n\nWord frequency\n\nSentence structure\n\nDr. Danielsson plotted information about these aspects on a three-dimensional graph and plotted the same criteria from Arthur Conan Doyle’s works on the same graph. Christie’s books exhibited a consistency shown visually by her plotted points being clustered together while the points of Doyle’s stories were spread farther apart indicating his works were more dissimilar when compared to each other. This indicated that Doyle’s style had changed through the years while Christie’s had remained remarkably consistent.\n\nPlot\n\nChristie’s mysteries almost always create a world where\n\nThere is a dead body\n\nA closed group of suspects are introduced\n\nA detective (either professional or amateur) is a character\n\nRed herrings are spread throughout\n\nThere is a denouement scene where the detective identifies the murderer and brings closure to the story.\n\nSome critics claim Christie wrote the same story over and over, but that’s not fair. For example, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Murder on the Orient Express, and And Then There Were None introduced novel twists to the standard murder mystery although they used a typical Christie template.\n\nHowever, this general structure reassures the reader that there will be a logical puzzle that will be solved in the end, and that contributes to the sense of satisfaction.\n\nCharacters\n\nWhile some famous characters appear in multiple books and are popular with the reading public (e.g., Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Captain Hastings), the number of characters in each novel may be just as important. This prompted an interesting theory by David Shephard, Master trainer in Neuro-Linguistic Programming.\n\nMr. Shephard pointed out that people have a limited focus and a conscious mind can only concentrate on five to nine things at a time. When presented with more information than that, a person will enter a sort of hypnotic trance.\n\nSince Christie’s stories often have more than nine characters and several plot lines, Shephard thinks the reader’s mind can’t handle the overload of information, so he/she begins to “feel” the book rather than just think about it. This emotional connection makes readers want to return to Agatha Christie’s books again and again.\n\nI’m not sure I can buy that explanation, but it’s very interesting and makes me think I should count the characters in my future books to see if I can put my readers into a trance.\n\nContent & Style\n\nAs we all know, Agatha Christie’s mysteries contain no explicit sexual scenes and no explicit violence. So why do so many readers still buy her novels? Readers of Christie’s books know there will be a logical solution to the murder, the killer will be caught, and the clues are all available to solve the mystery.\n\nDavid Suchet, who played the part of Hercule Poirot in the television series Agatha Christie’s Poirot, compared Christie’s books to sudoku puzzles. He believes readers enjoy the books because they’re completely absorbed in figuring out the solution to the puzzle.\n\nLength\n\nAlthough I found a site with the number of pages in each of Agatha Christie’s novels, I only found a reference to the word count on https://thewritepractice.com/word-count/. That site had an article that states Agatha Christie’s mystery novels average between 40,000 and 60,000 words. That’s a little short for most novels today, but it could explain why people found them easy to read.\n\nPacing\n\nAgatha Christie controlled the speed at which her books were read by laying out more descriptive passages at the beginning, but picking up the pace of the story as it progressed. Hypnotist Paul McKenna had an interesting take on this. He felt her particular pattern of writing caused certain brain chemicals to be released, resulting in a sort of addiction in the readers. This theory goes a little beyond my pay grade, but I do think picking up the pace is a technique that works well in mystery writing.\n\n* * *\n\nSo there you have it. While I’m sure there are other reasons for her success, these aspects of Agatha Christie’s writing are worth considering.\n\n* * *\n\nSo TKZers: Have you read many of Agatha Christie’s books? Why do you think they’re so popular? Have you viewed “The Agatha Christie Code” video? Is there anything you think we can glean from the data in this post that will help with our own writing?\n\n* * *\n\n“Very few of us are what we seem.” –Agatha Christie\n\nPrivate pilot Cassie Deakin lands in the middle of a mystery and discovers things are not always what they seem.\n\nBuy on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Kobo, Google Play, or Apple Books."
