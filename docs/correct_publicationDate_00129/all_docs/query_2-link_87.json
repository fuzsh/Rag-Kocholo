        "text": "Larry Wood, a retired member of the New York Army National Guard who loves painting and science fiction, has completed his new book, “The Earth Project”: an enjoyable book on Captain Dawson’s plan to save people and the galaxy itself upon his discovery of Earth’s true history, the terrifying truth that has been held secret from mankind, and the ongoing alien abductions as well as genetic manipulation.\n\nPublished by Covenant Books of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, Larry Wood’s new book is a commendable work of fiction about Captain Dave Dawson’s journey on saving mankind and the galaxy from a vile race that has conquered Earth, has killed and enslaved the first colonists of the planet, and has prepared to expand their influence.\n\nThe Captain has a role to play in the plan to save Earth from a dark, cold race of beings who operate from the shadows. He learns about portals, vortexes, wormholes, and who has been controlling the planet along the way.\n\nReaders can purchase “The Earth Project” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, or Barnes and Noble.\n\nCovenant Books is an international Christian owned and operated publishing house based in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina.
