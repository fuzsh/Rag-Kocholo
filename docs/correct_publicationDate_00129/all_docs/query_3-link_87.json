        "text": "As a teenager, I devoured science fiction, and my addiction resumed for extended periods later in life. I was attracted above all by the sheer creativity the writers demonstrated in speculating about life and reality from new perspectives. And I must admit I was a bit of a nut about space travel, too. I’ve always frustrated my progressive friends by supporting the space program.\n\nFrom pulp literature to speculative fiction\n\nIn times past, including the years of my youth, science fiction was widely regarded as pulp literature suitable only for 14-year-old boys. Those days are long past. Now the field is often referred to as speculative fiction. Which makes sense. The term has allowed such mainstream authors as Kurt Vonnegut and Margaret Atwood to deny vehemently that they write science fiction. Even if they really do.\n\nIn the lists below, you’ll find more than 100 top science fiction novels reviewed in recent years on this site. Some of these titles will be familiar to you if you’re a science fiction fan. You’re less likely to know others. Each title is followed by a link to my review.\n\nIn the first list, I’ve included only the top 10 books I’ve read and reviewed here over the past eleven years—not any I might have read earlier. Following the top 10 is a list of all the more than 100 top science fiction novels I’ve reviewed. And within that longer list, I’ve attempted to group the titles by theme. Again, those include only books I read and reviewed here. I’m excluding hundreds more that I read in earlier years but never reviewed. Within each list, titles are grouped in alphabetical order by the authors’ last names.\n\nA scene in the American Midwest as Emily St. John Mandel imagined it in Station Eleven. Image: The Portalist\n\nThe 10 top science fiction novels reviewed here\n\nOmar El Akkad, American War – A chilling tale, lucidly told, of a Second American Civil War\n\nIn American War by Omar El Akkad, the Second American Civil War erupts in 2074 when Sara T. (“Sarat”) Chestnut is six years old. Four states in the Deep South have seceded in response to federal legislation banning the use of fossil fuels—and a Southern “homicide bomber” has assassinated the President of the United States in Columbus, the country’s new capital. The Reds and Blues are now at war. And much worse is in store for the unfortunate people of this once-democratic nation. Read the review.\n\nMargaret Atwood, The Maddaddam Trilogy – Margaret Atwood’s classic dystopian fiction\n\nIn Oryx and Crake, Book #1 of the Maddaddam Trilogy, we enter the future world of Atwood’s cruel vision, the late twenty-first century shortly after the Waterless Flood, which virtually exterminated the human species. The most pessimistic projections of climate change have wrought havoc on Planet Earth, and it’s not a pretty picture. Book #2, The Year of the Flood, takes us back to the years preceding the Flood, when the conditions described in Oryx and Crakecame about. We learn the nature of the Flood, and how it came to be. Finally, in Book #3, MaddAddam, we encounter once again the principal characters of the first two books and follow them as the future grimly unfolds. Most of the action is compressed into a few months following the calamity of the Flood. Read the review.\n\nPaolo Bacigalupi, The Windup Girl – One of the best science fiction novels I’ve ever read\n\nThe action takes place in Bangkok sometime in the 23rd century. Sometime in the past, the oceans have risen twenty feet or more, and the city survives only because a visionary Thai king has built an enormous seawall, dikes, and pumps to hold back the waters of the annual monsoon. Genetic engineering has run amok around the globe, and the Thai Kingdom is one of few countries, perhaps the only country, still resisting the “calorie companies,” powerful food-exporting corporations headquartered in the American Midwest and in China. Having killed off virtually all traditional sources of food—and hundreds of millions of people—with genetically engineered plagues to increase their leverage in the market, the calorie companies hungrily eye Thailand and its own independent success in creating new fruits and nightshades capable of resisting the ubiquitous plant-killers. Read the review.\n\nJoe Haldeman, The Forever War (Forever War Trilogy #1) – This classic science fiction war novel won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards\n\nJoe Haldeman’s classic science fiction war (actually, anti-war) novel, The Forever War, appears on most lists of the all-time most popular stories in the field. The book won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for Best Novel. When it was published in 1974, the Vietnam War was winding down. Haldeman had fought in the war and was badly wounded there. At the time, a dozen publishers rejected the novel because, as Haldeman reveals in an Author’s Note at the front of the Kindle edition of the novel, “‘nobody wants to read a science fiction novel about Vietnam.'”\n\nToday, the parallel between the Vietnam War and Haldeman’s story is difficult to see. The Forever War could be no war in history, or every war. “It’s about Vietnam because that’s the war the author was in,” Haldeman writes. “But it’s mainly about war, about soldiers, and about the reasons we think we need them.” Read the review.\n\nMary Robinette Kowal, The Calculating Stars (Lady Astronaut #1)—This novel shows just how good hard science fiction can be\n\nThe Calculating Stars introduces Dr. Elma Wexler York, a mathematical genius with doctorates in physics and math from Stanford University. Elma had gone to high school at age eleven and to Stanford at fourteen. She’s the anxiety-ridden daughter of a Jewish Army general who works as a computer at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, or NACA. (In those days, “computers” were people, not machines, and most of them were women. Using paper, pencil, and adding machines, they wrote the equations for the ballistics calculations used in artillery and, later, in missiles and rockets.)\n\nAnd, yes, you read that right. It’s NACA, not NASA. Because the novel is set in the 1950s in an alternate history of the United States—and the planet. Tom Dewey had defeated Harry Truman in 1948. He has taken advantage of Wernher von Braun and the other former Nazi rocket engineers whisked away to the US. So, Dewey has jump-started the space program a decade before John F. Kennedy did so in reality. And Elma’s husband, Nathaniel, is the lead engineer in the rocketry program. Read the review.\n\nIra Levin, This Perfect Day – A superb tale of a future where artificial intelligence rules\n\nCenturies in the future, the people of Earth live under the control of an artificial intelligence called UniComp. A century and a half earlier, the computers governing the five continents had come together in the Unification. The result was a worldwide society free of war, hunger, crime, and violence of any sort. “Hate” and “fight” are swear words. This is the world Ira Levin describes in his superb science fiction novel, This Perfect Day. Although it reads as though it might have been written today, the book was first published half a century ago in 1970. Read the review.\n\nEmily St. John Mandel, Station Eleven – Life on Earth after the apocalypse\n\nSt. John Mandel’s story unfolds in a rapid succession of short scenes in the post-apocalyptic world along the shores of Lakes Huron and Michigan. It’s 15 and 20 years after the collapse. “Collapse” is the popular term for the apocalypse brought on by a pandemic. There are frequent flashbacks into the lives of the central characters. Through the twists and turns of the plot, the lives of these characters frequently intersect. One of them dies of the Georgian Flu. We visit the others both in flashbacks to their pre-pandemic lives and many years after the Collapse. Read the review.\n\nRamez Naam, The Nexus Trilogy – The post-human future explored in an outstanding SF novel\n\nWill the transformation of humanity by artificial intelligence stop there? Is there a step far beyond into post-human abilities so far superior to those of human beings today that a new species will result? This is the premise of Ramez Naam‘s brilliant science fiction trilogy. In Nexus, the first of the three novels, Naam explores the circumstances in which the conflict between humans and post-humans emerges into the open. Although the book is unquestionably imaginative, it is far from fantasy. Naam is a computer scientist and is intimately familiar with contemporary neurological research into using computer interface technology to enhance human cognitive abilities. Read the review.\n\nAdrian Tchaikovsky, Children of Time – Accelerated evolution is the theme in a superior science fiction novel\n\nTens of thousands of years after Earth has self-destructed in a horrific civil war, humanity has once again reached for the stars. The species has left behind the Old Empire, which spanned Earth and several of the solar system’s gas giant moons. Eventually, near-lightspeed interstellar ships began to spread through the galaxy, terraforming the most likely planets where Homo sapiens might find new homes.\n\nNow, the technology of the Old Empire has been lost to time. Mere hints of that technology are accessible only to the classicists who labor to translate the old, dead languages of the meager records that survived the Empire’s destruction. But the toxic wastes the war left behind have gradually rendered Earth lifeless. Now humankind cannot rebuild where it has lived for millions of years. The remnants of the human race have set out to relocate elsewhere in starships, each of which houses a half-million people in stasis. Read the review.\n\nConnie Willis, Doomsday Book — A time travel novel about the Black Death\n\nKivrin Engle is a bright and adventurous first-year student in medieval history at Oxford’s Brasenose College. In the mid-21st century, time travel is well established as a method for historians to study conditions over the past four or five hundred years, and Kivrin is eager to explore 14th-century England. Together with the acting head of medieval studies, Mr. Gilchrist, and her history tutor at Balliol College, Mr. Dunworthy, she develops a plan for a two-week visit in 1320, farther back than others have previously gone. Her target is the village of Skendgate, near the city of Bath in the country’s far southwest. Unfortunately for all concerned, everything goes wrong when Kivrin sets out for the past.

You’ll find links to my reviews of all the books in the series at The pleasures of reading the complete Vorkosigan Saga. I’m listing below just one of the 20 books in the series, which is in fact one of the best.\n\nLois McMaster Bujold, Komarr (Vorkosigan Saga #11)—The best book in the Vorkosigan Saga?\n\nBecky Chambers, The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet (Wayfarers #1) — A delightful modern space opera that’s all about character development\n\nBecky Chambers, A Closed and Common Orbit (Wayfarers #2) — Lovable characters in this off-beat space opera\n\nBecky Chambers, Record of a Spaceborn Few (Wayfarers #3) — A brilliant invented universe in an unusually good new science fiction novel\n\nBecky Chambers, The Galaxy, and the Ground Within (Wayfarers #4)—The last of the Wayfarers series from Becky Chambers\n\nAliette de Bodard, On a Red Station, Drifting – In this remarkable sci-fi novella, we enter a disorienting future reality\n\nNancy Kress, The Eleventh Gate—Political philosophies clash in this new space opera\n\nJohn Scalzi, The Collapsing Empire (Interdependency #1) – A promising start to a new John Scalzi series\n\nMany of these stories pursue the mantra of Star Trek: “Space: the final frontier.

To boldly go where no man has gone before!”\n\nAlien encounters\n\nSo far as I can tell, the author who has delved most deeply into the theme of First Contact is the endlessly inventive Australian writer Peter Cawdron. At this writing, he has published 17 standalone First Contact novels. I’m in the process of reading them all. You can access them by typing Cawdron’s name into the search box in the upper right-hand corner of the Home Page.
