        "text": "Tiptoeing in tapshoes.\n\nTen years ago, in a desperate attempt to save the Earth from invasion, an impenetrable barrier was created around it. It stopped the would be invaders but then became the problem: without any means of collapsing the shelf, Earth was slowly dying with. All of Earth's defensive fleet had been destroyed: only one space vessel survived, a small but agile craft, the Orlando, now captained by the ship's first officer, a scientist Jack Shepherd. With the enemy fleet again massing and Earth itself suffocating, the Orlando and her crew are the last and only hope to save humanity.\n\nThis might sound like a military S.F. book and there is a little of the space fighting which comes with that genre, but essentially it is a study of the interactions between the crew. And it is a really fun read, amusing and quite light-hearted. When a new crew member joins the, a cat like some rescued from a security prison, for example, there is an enjoyable contrast in culture over how to woo someone o the opposite sex.\n\nNarrator Josiah Bildner gives a fine performance, his warm tones matching the lightheadedness of the text, plus his individually differentiated voices of all of the characters the excellent, very much adding to the enjoyment of the story.\n\nThis is a fun book so do not expect anything intense. My thanks to the rights holder of The Last Starship, who, at my request, freely gifted me a complimentary copy, via Audiobook Boom. Some of the characters were a delight, especially an alien nicknamed simply Can't. The story itself was almost incidental. More a cozy science fiction than intensive battle action story.\n\nEngaging characters with intriguing story\n\nI really enjoyed reading this work. The characters brought a familiar feel for me as I know people in real life like them. The story was a nice break from reality and I found myself caught up in how the Orlando Crew would save Earth. Fang is my favorite character. It was nice to see the character development of him and the others as the story progressed.\n\nIf you need a break from reality, which I think many of us could use one right about now, I’d recommend this book. Let yourself get caught up in these new friends of Earth’s last Starship, The Orlando.\n\nThe breath of fresh air I didn't know I needed\n\nI was given this book for free in exchange for an honest review.\n\nI initially went into this book expecting to listen on a higher speed, since that's what I usually do with fiction books. It lets me almost watch the books like a movie in my mind's eye. But I quickly found myself ticking the speed down to just enjoy the ride. This was a character-rich story, which I love. Definitely going to look for more by the same author."
