        "text": "Windy, will consider swapping out Starship Troupers for one of those others. Do you think the overall quality of all four are roughly comparable?\n\nThey vary and usually are good for different reasons. I assumed Starship Troopers was there because it is a more famous Heinlein, though not my favourite. I mean if you wanted famous, then Stranger in a Strange Land would probably be it, but I'm really not a fan of it myself.\n\nFrom those Double Star may be your best bet. Despite the capes (!) it's probably held up best. And was a Hugo Winner, of course!\n\nHaving said that, Moon is a Harsh Mistress is on the reread pile here - I really liked it when I first read it, so it will be interesting to see if its still entertaining.\n\nThanks for the kind words, Windy, as ever. And pleased you're finding them readable, Matt.\n\nMatt, Mark has said it all other than that if I had to pick just one favorite Heinlein of the 40s and 50s it would be Citizen of the Galaxy - Wikipediahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_of_the_Galaxy\n\nwith Double Star next in line... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Star\n\nI was 7 when I read Double Star and 8 when I read Citizen of the Galaxy both in their publication year; and they made a big impression on me as to the way a man should behave that stood with me through the years. They are a good example of the transition to Heinlein's Glory years in the 60s and I picked Moon is a Harsh Mistress as my favorite from the early 60s.\n\nI look forward to seeing your take on the books that make up your journey\n\nThey vary and usually are good for different reasons. I assumed Starship Troopers was there because it is a more famous Heinlein, though not my favourite. I mean if you wanted famous, then Stranger in a Strange Land would probably be it, but I'm really not a fan of it myself.\n\nThanks again. Totally agree on Stranger. Funny how when you hear some one say about a major work \"Not my favorite\", it gives you the space to realize that you honestly don't like it much either. Hahaha... I read while young too and it was a huge, big, highly acclaimed novel of the time. Honestly, looking back didn't shape my aesthetic much.\n\nI think I'm going with Double Star on your combined recos. Btw, great to have chance to hob-knob with someone who has your level of background with Heinlein.\n\nI was the hoping the list might be edited into something actually do-able. I'm not a fast reader and on top of that I'm hoping to take some notes now and then. So I'd have to pare it into a main list and a reserve list. Also I'd also have to weigh the length of the novels to some extent.\n\nAny argument for E.R. Burroughs? Perhaps the type and flavor of the specific worlds he created was distinct from those already on the list? Can't say, cause have't read them. You may laugh... No idea if you consider him a hack. Just remember vivid worlds and page-turners...\n\nMatt, Mark has said it all other than that if I had to pick just one favorite Heinlein of the 40s and 50s it would be Citizen of the Galaxy ....I look forward to seeing your take on the books that make up your journey\n\nNoted Windy and thanks.\n\nI also look forward to my journey.. haha The situation reminds me a bit of Pygmalion, with you guys playing Henry Higgins My readership is material for your experimentation.\n\nLike I metioned to Mark, I want to make sure the list is really do-able. To achieve effect I want must be done in quick succession... Maximum velocity and mass So will need to make lots of tough cuts on the list... But will assemble all your recos soon into a cleaned up list of \"candidates\"\n\nInteresting about Heinlein. I would say he also possibly influenced me in ways, but the memory of his work has really faded into oblivion, since I haven't re-read him. Can wait to actual read Heinlein (again) instead of hearing about him.\n\nAny argument for E.R. Burroughs?\n\nI would try ERB's John Carter. They are 'of their time', but they are good fun if you can cope with the values of the time they were written.\n\nAnd in terms of influence, one of the biggest. We've said elsewhere that the movie's not as bad as its box-office takings would suggest. But the books are a definite influence on other writers - Heinlein included, if I remember right.\n\nnteresting about Heinlein. I would say he also possibly influenced me in ways, but the memory of his work has really faded into oblivion, since I haven't re-read him.\n\nOne of the reasons I went for the reread myself. The results have been mixed!\n\nSea, I hope you were not off-put by my weird expression of admiration. Who in a sci-fi writing forum doesn't love scientists?? To say it's \"super cool\" doesn't cover it. Sometimes I wonder if scientists are just a fictional creation... everyone's in business or marketing... ugh! Me, I'm a English major turned computer geek (databases). Should go without saying that anything you'd care to share about your work would be pretty fascinating...As a kid always wanted to be a scientist, and I love to pretend... I'm big on plants/botany (field ID, etc.), but I'm sure botanists don't exist... never met a real one!\n\nI’m happy to talk about science any time! Especially with my doppelgänger!\n\nComing to think of it I don’t think I’ve ever met a botanist either! Maybe they went out of favour in the 19th century !\n\nSea, my theory is they never existed at all.. neither did the 19th century!\n\nDo you feel you've exploited (are exploiting) your science background satisfactorily in your sci-fi fiction writing? I can imagine myself having a blast with that. Seems like any dry-seeming little detail from your day-to-day could be spun something marvelous... And the sea being soooo mysterious and all, (easier said than done, yeah...) Hopefully you can see whatever neat stuff you do through an outsider's eyes now and then. Don't forget you can make us believe anything with a few fancy words, lolol... So go ahead and give us a mini-dissertation (with pop quiz) on what you do in Oceanography whenever you are ready. If I can't story-ize it, I'll eat my hat!\n\nBtw, am browsing your work to see what's there... (did you do that one about the dice/snow flake thing or was that someone else? Was just reading now can't find it)\n\nEarlier in the year I was working on a list of must read SF novels (and a separate list for series), divided into Top 50, Next 50, etc.\n\nMost of the novels are standalone books but I included a few novels that are part of a series because of their iconic status (for example Dune and Ender's Game). This is still an ongoing project, but here is my provisional list of top 50 must read SF novels based on importance in the field as much as literary quality:\n\nANDERSON, Poul Tau Zero\n\nANTHONY, Piers Macroscope\n\nASIMOV, Isaac The Gods Themselves\n\nBESTER, Alfred The Demolished Man\n\nThe Stars My Destination (aka Tiger, Tiger)​\n\nBRUNNER, John Stand on Zanzibar\n\nThe Whole Man (aka Telepathist)​\n\nCARD, Orson Scott Ender’s Game\n\nCLARKE, Arthur C.

It wasn't included as is in my series file.\n\nFred Saberhagen's Empire of the East similarly was originally published as a trilogy, so is in my series list, but probably should be included on above list.\n\nRobert Sheckley Victims trilogy is the same as The Tenth Victim is a classic novel but became part of a trilogy.\n\nCordwainer Smith's Instrumentality series is a real publishing mess, and is in my series list.\n\nNorman Spinrad's The Void Captain's Tale had a sequel so is in my duology list.\n\nI will publish here my top selections from my duology list tomorrow.\n\nI have just checked my selected duology file and notice it is reasonably complete, so am copying it as it directly to here:\n\nMUST READ DUOLOGIES FOR THE DEDICATED SF FAN\n\nALLEN, Roger McBride\n\nAllies and Aliens duology:\n\nThe Torch of Honor\n\nRogue Powers\n\nASIMOV, Isaac\n\nFantastic Voyage duology:\n\nFantastic Voyage (adaptation of the movie)\n\nFantastic Voyage II: Destination Brain\n\nNOTE: author Kevin J.

It's kind of amazing that the view of military service could flip-flop so drastically in less than 20 years, but it's the difference between the WWII generation and the Vietnam War generation.\n\nI'd also suggest The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. LeGuin. Beautifully written and fully imagined, it creates a world and two distinctive characters in a short span of pages. I especially enjoy her short stories, by the way.\n\nSpeaking of short stories, a representative collection by Roger Zelazny would not be amiss; and if you're going to read James Tiptree Jr. (a.k.a. Alice Sheldon) her short stories are probably the way to go. Ditto with Cordwainer Smith, though there I do recall Norstrilla being fun, though it's too long since reading it for me to recall details.\n\nIf you want to follow a road less travelled, I'd recommend Edgar Pangborn: Davy or his story collection, Still I Persist in Wondering.\n\nRandy M."
