        "text": "I think this started with a book that is a minor variation on this trope. This is a book that is better in its Audible form but I don’t know why that is\n\nThe Sculpted Ship by K. M. O’Brien\n\nThat book set me off on one of the new endless series of short kindle books that don’t quite reach novella length, but I have enjoyed every one the first few are a bit of a young adult hero’s journey but it crosses over into an adventure series a few books in. The $4 fee for the next book in the series I have found easy to spend so I guess the system works\n\nThe Delphi series by Bob Blanton\n\nSo what do we have as recommendations for Science Fiction (on the hard SF part of the spectrum) where the protagonist finds a starship or even a spaceship and perhaps after figuring out how it works and what it needs to get running again the adventure begins.\n\nI have found a read a few others to those mentioned above but rather than list them now I will do so if others don’t put them forward.\n\nIn general books in this sub genre tend to be on the discovery and wonder side of the scales rather than post apocalyptic end of the world/universe sort of stories but I have become very tired of depressing stories of that ilk so happy (or even just not horrible) endings are fine for me right now.\n\nI also liked “The Sculpted Ship”. However, there is a problem as, whilst it is a reasonable first book of a series and doesn’t end in a cliff hanger, there are many unanswered questions and no sequel yet.\n\nIt was and is his first and only book. And as you say it has some first book faults and would have benefited from an experienced editor. I Check his Facebook every 6 months or so and he says he is working on a final polish of book two. I think there\n\nare the pressures of his jobs to feed his family along with a bit of \"fear of failure to launch\" syndrome.\n\nI hope when he does publish vol.2 that he can get the same narrator, Tanya Eby was a near perfect match to the text and her performance raises the book by an extra star for me\n\nScience Fiction & Fantasy Audiobooks narrated by Tanya Eby | Audible.com\n\nDownload Science Fiction & Fantasy Audiobooks narrated by Tanya Eby to your device. Audible provides the highest quality audio and narration. Your first book is Free with trial!\n\nI recall parts of . I think I read it when I was at university. He perhaps kept in memory evergreen\n\nRight now, I am working my way through this series and I am enjoying it so far as book 4 and I await #5 it’s use of elderly Vietnam vets puts the protagonists in my age group. And let’s this reader indulge in vicarious wish fulfillment.\n\nI seem to have become a sucker for SFF where the protagonist is in my age group.\n\nJunkyard Pirate (5 book series) Kindle Edition\n\nby Jamie McFarlane (Author)\n\nFrom Book 1: Knocking at death’s door. Bargaining for a second chance. Seems like a heck of a way to find out about an alien invasion…\n\nVietnam vet Albert Jenkins is battling a bulging waistline and a passion for drink. So when a towering pile of scrap rocket parts falls and crushes the stubborn curmudgeon, he thinks it’s finally the end. But just as he’s about to take one final breath, a snarky alien parasite offers him a deal: his life in return for sharing his body.\n\nWith a little coaxing from his new pop-culture-loving inner resident, AJ’s broken carcass improves so much that even an old flame is impressed. But his bright outlook fizzles when he discovers he's at ground zero of a galactic conspiracy to strip Earth of precious resources humans don't even know exist.\n\nCan the unlikely partners join forces and use AJ's rusty military skills to raise the alarm? Or, will the alien invaders put him down once and for all?\n\nJunkyard Pirate is the first book in an imaginative space opera series. If you like grizzled soldiers, clever twists and turns, and intergalactic tactical pairings, then you’ll love Jamie McFarlane’s fast-paced alien adventure.\n\nBuy Junkyard Pirate to boot the invaders back to where they came from today\n\nThis is the author and this short sub series is what started my reading of stories with older protagonists\n\nHe is my favorite author new to me this year an I can strongly recommend his stories and his wonderful imagination throughout his prose.\n\nThis is a spinnoff from his main 20 volume (novella length) series I think it is an excellent way to see if you like his writing… he has another SF trilogy I will put in the next post. I love the full series and I look forward to each new story in his EarthCent Ambassador series.\n\nthis author was just what I needed this year two of the pandemic. Very strongly recommended.\n\nEarthCent Universe (4 book series) Kindle Edition\n\nby E. M. Foner (Author)\n\nFrom Book 1: In space, nobody can hear you complain about the food.\n\nWhat do a group of retirees leaving Earth and a young woman in EarthCent’s new witness protection have in common? They’ve all going to live on Flower, an enormous alien colony vessel employed by Eccentric Enterprises to travel a circuit of far-flung human communities. But Flower is a sentient ship that’s been traveling the galaxy for 20,000 years and has her own opinions about how her inhabitants should conduct themselves.\n\nI wrote Independent Living because readers of my EarthCent Ambassador series were always asking what happens in the galaxy where the Stryx aren’t around to watch every second. The answer is, about what you’d expect. In terms of the EarthCent universe, Independent Living would be the seventeenth book in the sequence, but it can be read as a standalone\n\nThis is the author and this short sub series is what started my reading of stories with older protagonists\n\nHe is my favorite author new to me this year an I can strongly recommend his stories and his wonderful imagination throughout his prose.\n\nThis is a spinnoff from his main 20 volume (novella length) series I think it is an excellent way to see if you like his writing… he has another SF trilogy I will put in the next post.

But it takes a certain sort of person to start farming on a half-finished tech-ban world, and Flower’s residents soon find themselves playing host to traditional communities from the Old Way movement and Alt. Can treadle technology and sewing circles coexist with advanced aliens and interstellar jumps?\n\nAmazon.com: Slow Living (EarthCent Universe Book 5) eBook : Foner, E.
