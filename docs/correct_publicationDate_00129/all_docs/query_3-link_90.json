McCabe, Jenkins, and the Second Battalion long for home. Reinforcements have arrived, but the veterans of the MEF have one final mission. Defend Forward Base Zulu at all costs.\n\nWhile Generalfeldmarschall Brandt plans a decisive showdown at Forward Base Zulu, Reichsführer Wagner celebrates the activation of the first generation of the Hollow Programme. Surrounded and cut off, McCabe and Jenkins once again find themselves in league with the MAJESTIC-12 operatives known as the Black Visors. Now the future hinges on the sacrifices of a few determined soldiers.\n\n“The best stories are like tapestries. Their narratives are skilfully woven together to form a design which is easy to understand, complex to make. Damien Larkin has shown, in his third novel, Blood Red Steel, that he is an expert weaver. He takes numerous storylines and threads them together to create a story which never lets up. There is not just action a-plenty. There is non-stop, relentless action. It is breath-taking in its remorselessness.” – Phil Parker, author\n\n“The stakes are so high in this one. Larkin is a master storyteller and every plot twist is a punch to the gut.” – Jessa Forest, author\n\n“The many complex threads of this extravagantly layered war are brought together through a colourful cast of characters, jumping between POVs in a way that not only neatly connects all the action but also keeps you on edge wondering where their allegiances will ultimately fall and who will make it through. The stakes keep stacking up as the many paths of this wildly original tale come together, and the quality has only improved as the series has marched on.” - Phil Williams, author\n\nCassaDark\n\nBy Alex J.

His best friend almost dies when Bassan freezes. Now, he’s being sent across the galaxy to speak at an important conference. Despite saving the eleven races years ago, he’s paralyzed by doubt. Could things get any worse?\n\nOnce there, new acquaintance Zendar convinces Bassan to visit his planet for a humanitarian mission. Bassan’s special connection to ancient technology is the key to saving Zendar’s people. One problem though—it’s a prison planet.\n\nOn Ugar, he discovers things aren’t so straightforward. As each truth reveals itself, the situation grows more desperate. If he can’t find the right answers, he might die along with Zendar’s people. Can Bassan summon the courage to be a hero again?\n\n“Cavanaugh returns to the world of his Cassa Series…for a fourth inventive space opera.” – Publisher’s Weekly\n\n“If you enjoy classic SF novels with interesting, new ideas and plenty of twists and turns, then grab a copy of CassaDark!” - Damien Larkin, author\n\n“Alex has done it again!

The Reichsführer will sacrifice everything to initiate the secretive Hollow Programme and realise his nightmarish future for humanity.\n\nMcCabe, Private Jenkins, and the Mars Expeditionary Force must overcome bullet, bomb, and bayonet to destroy the Third Reich. While Jenkins fights to stay alive, McCabe forms an uneasy alliance with MAJESTIC-12 operatives known as the Black Visors. Will this be the final battle of World War Two or the first confrontation in an interstellar war?\n\n“I’m awed by Damien Larkin’s imagination… So truly Heinlein.” – Phil Parker, author\n\n“The many combat scenes keep the pages turning…” - Publisher’s Weekly\n\n“Brilliant follow up to Big Red.” – Tripp Ainsworth, author\n\n“Blood Red Sand is top class military sci-fi with plenty of heart pounding action sequences, excellent characterisation and a growing sense of mystery that readers will crave to uncover.” – Book Nest\n\n“Non-stop action and mayhem” – Alex J. Cavanaugh, author\n\n“Blood Red Sand is an absolutely brilliant science-fiction novel, one that’s simultaneously delightfully and unapologetically pulpy with a fantastic dieselpunk aesthetic, and yet also has a much more nuanced and complex background that Larkin carefully orchestrates and reveals in the latter half of the novel.” - SciFi and Fantasy Reviewer\n\nDark Matter: Artificial\n\nAn Insecure Writer’s Support Group Anthology\n\nPrint ISBN 9781939844828\n\neBook ISBN 9781939844835\n\nScience Fiction: Collections & Anthologies/Space Exploration/Genetic Engineering\n\nDiscover dark matter’s secrets…\n\nWhat is an AI’s true role?
