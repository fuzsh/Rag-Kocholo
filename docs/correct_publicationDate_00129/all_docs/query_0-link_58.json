        "text": "Description\n\nFirst Edition, With Dustwrapper\n\nIn original unclipped dustwrapper, scarce in such good condition. John Boyd was the pen name for the writer Boyd Bradfield Upchurch. He is best known for his work The Last Starship from Earth. His bibliography stretches to eleven science fiction novels, five novels of other genres and one biography. The Pollinators of Eden is Boyd's second novel. It was so popular that it was issued by the Science Fiction Book Club twice. The novel explores botanical research into potentially intelligent, sexually voracious plant species native to a newly discovered extrasolar planet.\n\nCondition\n\nIn original purple cloth binding held in original unclipped dustwrapper. Externally, excellent with just some minor bumping to the head and tail of spine. Dustwrapper is also excellent with just the smallest amount of shelfwear to the head and tail of spine. Internally, firmly bound. Pages are bright and clean throughout.\n\nOverall: Fine\n\nDelivery & payment\n\nWe send all of our books via courier which is a fully tracked and insured service.
