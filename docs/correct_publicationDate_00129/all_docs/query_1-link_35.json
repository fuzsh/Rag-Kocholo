        "text": "So this idea popped into my head:\n\nBasically its based in a fantasy dystopian world where society is being brainwashed into blindly following the agenda of a deceptive government.\n\nThe MC is a guy who doesn't like whats happening and seems to be the only one who thinks the whole thing is rotten.\n\nOne day he runs into a girl who, like him, is secretly against the government. Over the next few weeks he routinely skips school to be with her and they grow closer.\n\nSometime later she offers to show him the underground - a large secret organization of rebels who have come together in an effort to overthrow the current government. He goes with her and joins up with the underground.\n\nThe story ends when the MC discovers (after being forced to take medication by his elder brother) that he has been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and that the girl he loves and the undergound organization are all nothing but hallucinations and unreal.\n\nSo yea, ive had this idea playing about in the back of my mind for quite a while. About a week ago I saw 'A Beautiful Mind' and thought Damn, my story would be so damn similar to this.\n\nSo for those of you that have seen the movie; do you think the plot lines are too similar?\n\nI orignally thought of the whole thing after reading george orwell's 1984\n\nDo you guys think that someone reading my story would think it nothing but plagiarism?\n\nThanks\n\n\"Derivative\" isn't a bad place to start. I started a short story which seemed a lot like the M. Knight Shamala... M. Night Samala.... that one movie The Village. As soon as I realized that it was starting to seem like a movie I didn't even really like to begin with, I was inspired to make drastic changes and the story I ended up with was much better than the one I had originally outlined.\n\nYou could use 1984 as a jumping off point, but really make it your own. Because the trail has been tread before, there are better opportunities to diverge and make your own path.\n\nAlso, I think plagiarism would be directly copying text or making minor changes to the text of 1984. If copying the basic story were plagiarism, half of our favorite science fiction novels and movies would be locked in litigation. Shoot, 1984 alone has a ton of rip offs floating around.\n\nBut whatif the medication he takes just brings him back into 'the real world' and it turns out that there really is an alternative world/parallel universe that he can step into? Okay, now you've plagiarised The Matrix as well, but any story will suffer from that, but if it's well-written, then nobody cares..... Maybe he's been captured from the 'underground' world, and brought to this world to prevent the uprising - oops, Terminator. Whatif the 'underground' world is an experiment created by the real world, so they can see what happens, and then prevent it from happening in their own world? Whatif he's actually dead, and the 'real' world is the way station between earth (the underground world) and heaven, and he doesn't know he's dead? Whatif it's an interview for a job? ie the drugs allow him to solve problems etc, and he's judged by what he does... And he loves it so much he becomes addicted to the drugs because he wants to spend all his time there?\n\nWhatif I go and put the kettle on and have a cup of tea..?\n\nYou can't depend on a twist at the end to convince readers that your story is fresh and original. That's much too little and much too late.\n\nBesides, it's not the originality of an idea that counts, it's the treatment. Execution is everything. It's the characters and how they feel and how they respond to their situation that makes a story come to life. It's starting with a basic premise and then allowing your characters to strike out in new directions as their personalities dictate that will make your story original. It's the vividness of your characters and the details of your setting that let readers know from the beginning that it's not going to be exactly the same story that they've read before -- because these are the things that will dictate your character's journey far more than the original conception, if you will let them.\n\nIf you place their feet on a well-worn path there will always be the temptation to keep your characters moving in the same direction that so many others have followed before, but the sooner and the oftener they start to step off that trail the more unpredictable and the less derivative your story will become.\n\nWhat it comes down to, I think, is the difference between deciding to copy an idea and choosing to explore it. Depending on which one you decide to do, that's how derivative or original your story can be.\n\nAnd the insane come up with something original. Spend enough hours working alone in a dark room and eventually you'll be in the state to make your own story.\n\nAnywho, your plot is almost a synopsis of 1984. Still, if it were written in a different style, and if the world and characters were different enough, then I might not notice it so much if I read the actual story. As others have said; delivery is everything. To quote a less sober me; \"A dead cat is a dead cat, but there's lot's of ways a cat can die.\"\n\n... Yeah. Think about it.\n\nWhen an idea is as bare bones as the one you put up, most will sound derivative. It's mostly on how you execute. Look at Cormac McCarthy's The Road. A man and a boy walk in a dystopia. None too original that idea. His execution is masterful though (even if he is still quite overrated), and that is what ultimately matters. Stephen Baxter's new book, Flood, is about sea level rise and global rammifiications. That's also an oft used idea, but the book is still getting good reviews.\n\nWhy not write it from the perspective of those \"being brainwashed into blindly following the agenda of a deceptive government.\" You could develop your main characters through the eyes of multiple narrators. Use the two young lovers actions to convey how their relationship grows and their feelings about the world around them. Each chapter or section could be through the eyes of a different random individual who sees them on the street, at work, at a political rally. We need never hear from these witnesses again (or we might, to get their impressions of how the couple changed through time) Finally, the twist might come from the multiple narrators eyes being opened at the end (a group setting/event where all are in attendance) and the brainwashing being broken through as our MCs complete a task that shatters the illusions Big Brother has created."
