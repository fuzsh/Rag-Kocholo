The sheer numbers were staggering, a 100-1 advantage against all human spacecraft. If the highly aggressive, racist insects gained hyper-spatial tube technology - allowing them to cross 1,000 light-years in seconds - it would mean Armageddon for Earth. Star Watch desperately needs something powerful to offset the annihilating Swarm numbers. As if on cue, Professor Ludendorff declares he has discovered the whereabouts of ancient Builder technology, a tech so potent it could defeat the Swarm.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nDownward Slope\n\nBy Christopher on 05-02-17\n\nThe Lost Earth\n\nBy: Vaughn Heppner\n\nNarrated by: Mark Boyett\n\nLength: 11 hrs and 19 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 1,592\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 1,469\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 1,459\n\nIt finally happened.

No one - not the New Men, the Spacers, the Wahhabi Caliphate, or Star Watch - has faced such staggering odds. Alone or united, it makes no difference.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nWOW!!\n\nBy Christina Philips on 05-07-18\n\nThe Lost Artifact\n\nBy: Vaughn Heppner\n\nNarrated by: Mark Boyett\n\nLength: 16 hrs and 36 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 1,333\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 1,222\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 1,218\n\nStar Watch defeated the Swarm Invasion Fleet, but at a terrible cost in destroyed star systems, smashed battleships and billions of dead. In the aftermath of the costly victory, chaos threatens as worlds leave the Commonwealth of Planets, face mass starvation or succumb to increased piracy. The war against the Swarm Imperium has just begun. Humanity needs unity or each planet will fall alone. Brigadier O'Hara of Star Watch Intelligence stumbles onto a secret conspiracy. Someone is trying to destroy the Commonwealth from within, and they have an alien artifact of incredible power. O'Hara summons Captain Maddox. Although she fears to lose him, she knows that Maddox and his crew have the best chance of finding the hidden enemy. If the captain fails, the Commonwealth will be powerless to stop its destruction.\n\n2 out of 5 stars\n\nDisappointing… poorly written.\n\nBy Mark on 06-09-18\n\nThe Lost Star Gate\n\nLost Starship Series, Book 9\n\nBy: Vaughn Heppner\n\nNarrated by: Mark Boyett\n\nLength: 20 hrs and 16 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 1,075\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 982\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 978\n\nThe Swarm is coming! This time, enemy science vessels study us as Hive Masters gather hundreds of thousands of starships for an avalanche invasion. Instead of facing massed bug fleets in hopeless battle, we have a desperate plan: use a Builder nexus, create a hyper-spatial tube and send suicide-ships thousands of light-years into Swarm territory. There, our ships must find and destroy the nexuses that are the only way back home, all in order to stop the bugs from using the nexuses to reach Human Space.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nDisappointed\n\nBy Dennis on 05-23-19\n\nThe Lost Supernova\n\nLost Starship Series, Book 10\n\nBy: Vaughn Heppner\n\nNarrated by: Mark Boyett\n\nLength: 13 hrs and 9 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 759\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 676\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 672\n\nAndroids used to mingle among us, pretending to be human.
