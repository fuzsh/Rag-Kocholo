        "text": "What happens when two U.S. Naval Astronauts land on the planet Harlech, where there is no government, no law -- indeed, no concept of sin! Public nudity is a way of life and the paternalism of children is of little interest to their mothers. This wry, amusing, and suspenseful satire is truly John Boyd at his best.\n\nPraise for John Boyd's The Last Starship from Earth\n\n\"This is the best anti-Utopia, the strongest satire on trends in our present culture, I have seen since '1984' appeared. I enjoyed its humor, its half-buried allusions. The puns, the almost-not-quite-quotations, the thinly-veiled references to our 'real' world—all of these delighted me. It belongs up at the top, along with 'Brave New World' and '1984'.\" --Robert A. Heinlein\n\n\"A fascinating novel that kept me amused and interested to the end. The future society it describes is one of the most convincing I've ever encountered.” -- Arthur C. Clarke"
