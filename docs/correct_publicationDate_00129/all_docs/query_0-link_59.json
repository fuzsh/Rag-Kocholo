        "text": "Satirizing our (Western) past of imposing religion onto new cultures is a familiar theme of SF, using spacecraft or time travel as a substitute for ships and covered wagons. One of my favorite stories in the Harry Harrison collection The Best of Harry Harrison was “The Streets of Ashkelon,” where a spacefaring priest attempts to evangelize the inhabitants of a planet naïve to religion. The “Father Carmody” stories of Philip José Farmer cover similar ground, albeit with a less serious treatment.\n\nThe 1969 John Boyd novel The Rakehells of Heaven, a paperback that I must have acquired years ago after seeing this favorable review, is another work in this vein. It tells the story of two Navy pilots, raised and trained by a future theocracy, to go on a dangerous two-man “probe” mission to a distant planet. The spaceship returns with only one crew-member, who relates his story to the sole psychiatrist at the base.\n\nThe “story told as recollection to another character” is a device that hails back to the traditions of Wells’ The Time Machine and other classics: a provides a buffer against the frequent moments of implausibility, as possible untruths given by a motivated narrator. We’re not supposed to think that the returning spaceman, an evangelical Amercian named John “Jack” Adams, is entirely truthful about what he witnesses and why he took his actions, but we’re probably also not to dismiss his entire story as fantasy.\n\nAdams, whose religious habits arise from his upbringing in Alabama, is an example of a military man whose actions are couched in a formal code. This code is critical for survey missions, since mankind is desperate for inhabitable worlds and cannot afford to classify natives as humans with their own rights. Adams is trained to classify any indigenous beings as humans only when an absurdly stringent set of qualifications are met, including very specific ideas about sexual practices.\n\nAdams is paired with another pilot named Keven “Red” O’Hara, an Irish nonconformist and frequent prankster, on this mission by algorithms who matched their personality profiles. They are not only partners in the probe mission, but roommates and best friends throughout their entire tenure at the officer training academy. This puts Boyd’s novel squarely into the category of SF about friendships, and futuristic challenges that friends could face together. At least as much of TRoH is invested in the relationship between Adams and O’Hara as in the world-building of Harlech, the planet they land on. From their academy days (in a base located in a town called Mandan), we see how O’Hara plays the leader in the times their joint behavior strays from the officer’s handbook:\n\nOur Saturday sorties into the wilds of Mandan sometimes resembled forays. Red chose the “off-limit” houses guarded by military police on the theory that such places catered to officers who did not wish to be recognized by midshipmen. He might have been right about Madame Chacaud’s — Dirty Mary’s to the midshipmen. Her girls were refined enough not to stick their gum behind their ears and she kept a bottle of Jamiesons on tap for Red. Each girl had a television set in her room and Red would lounge around on a Sunday morning indulging in another of his passions — soap operas.\n\nSo, Boyd’s future Earth resembles our contemporary culture in some aspects. The world is not run by the hyper-religious military — otherwise there would be no Madame Chacaud’s in town. The neo-Calvinist ways of the military come in handy for doing the dirty work in preparing a planet for colonization, of course, but at home the civilians are evidently not held to the same standard.\n\nBefore departing Earth, Adams spent a summer break attaining a brand of religious zealotry that he would keep secret from his commanders:\n\nBy meditating, I learned that the Lord’s Will was for me to carry His Word to other galaxies, but there was a law against missionaries in space. Before the union of nations, the law had been put through by former colonial nations. After the union, the law was retained by the Interplanetary Colonial Administration, with full agreement of once underprivileged countries, to permit Earth colonization of planets inhabited by nonbelievers.\n\nI had the Call to preach to beings of alien species, and the Call was in violation of Navy Regulations.\n\nOnce they land on Harlech, they find it to be exceedingly inhabitable, and with signs of an active civilization. The first group of bipedal aliens they see is not a patrol, but a pair of soccer teams and a sizable female audience. The astronauts are immediately stricken with the females, and through the description of the “soccer” match, Boyd hints at an absence of the typical male hierarchy.\n\nThe game began and the procession from the woods dwindled and began to move faster. Watching through my glasses, it was difficult to follow the contest. A player would drive toward a goal and, when his shot was blocked, would turn and block someone else’s shot toward the same goal. No bodychecks were thrown and there was less contact because of the agility of the players than there would have been in basketball on Earth. There was no scoreboard and no referee.\n\nObviously, Adams and O’Hara are primed to be disruptors in this conflict-free world. In their first negotiations, they are offered positions as guest faculty in the planet’s universities. This gives the two of them opportunity to arrange a social pyramid, placing themselves at the top; Adams does this through introducing his religion, and O’Hara through performance art. Both men are completely taken with the constant availability of sexual partners, although O’Hara indulges far sooner and with greater profligacy.\n\nIf the phrase greater profligacy seems like an unnecessary indirection, that is actually the tone of TRoH: Adam’s point of view is a combination of asides and evasions about sexuality, something that is (often literally) in his face the entire time. The book, despite having a promising setup of potentially compelling themes, devolves into a near-constant sex romp. Predictably enough, Adams eventually chooses his “wife” (he has to ordain his now-rival O’Hara to administer the ceremony) and tries to plot a strategy to keep Harlech hidden from the Navy.\n\nTRoH is an uneven reading experience. Its many creative ideas are diluted by some over-stereotyped characters (yes, the aliens “learning” emotive expressions from the two men would justify being stereotypes) and draggy passages describing Adam’s lectures and O’Hara’s playwriting. Religion and culture are satirized almost constantly, so Boyd is due to miss his mark with frequency. Not a book to be taken seriously. 5/10.\n\nNOTE: The title, The Rakehells of Heaven, is a fair warning, in retrospect. Boyd uses an archaic version of rake in order to make his wordplay. Some readers are likely to appreciate many of the stylistic tradeoffs made to produce the jokes and satirical points."
