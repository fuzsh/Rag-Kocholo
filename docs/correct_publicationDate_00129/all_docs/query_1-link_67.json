        "text": "Number 170 is the last of the classic numbered series.\n\nAn SFBC imprint of varying type on the dustjacket and book spine remains in various forms until KILLER PINE (May 1974), then with THE GOLD AT STARBOW'S END (June 1974) the SFBC logo is on the dustjacket only and the following book - RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA - is identified only by the 'Readers Union' logo in all positions.\n\nThen from WONDERWORLDS (November 1977) a 'Science Fiction Book Club' logo appears on the upper front d/j of each issue until TIN WOODMAN(October 1980) when it disappears.\n\nThe 'New series' volume and issue numbering first appears with THE AVATAR - Poul Anderson - Autumn 1980; why it starts with Vol 1 No 12 is as yet unexplained. And may never be, frankly....\n\nAll numbering from number 171 on is essentially conjecture - no numbers actually appear on the books or dustjackets except the 'new series' numbering referred to above. The only numbers that apply are Readers Union stock numbers that are not necessarily consecutive..\n\nSee Wm Seabrook's explanatory note.\n\nAlso note - from January 1980 onwards several SFBC monthly issues are NOT SFBC reprints, being instead the standard publishers edition, entirely unchanged and without any specific SFBC markings or numbering. These are indicated below. Any numbering allocated is assumed.\n\nPlease note - all numbers and dates from No 170 onwards are subject to revision!\n\nThe Extras -\n\nthese were titles issued as optional extras for purchase by SFBC members.\n\nTHE NEON HALO was definately the first, according to the SFBC newsletter SCIENCE FICTION NEWS for January 1960. The early Extra issues I have seen conform with the SFBC style of the day, except for being un-numbered. Please note that I have not seen all the later books so there may be variations, and certainly many later (post 1965) Extras were the original publishers editions not identified in any way as being issued via the SFBC. (The intention here is to list only those Extras which were actually SFBC reprints and not the bought-in stock - there were a lot of optional extras offered in the end-years of SFBC).\n\nMuch of the information on the Extras is taken from issues of the SFBC's SCIENCE FICTION NEWS and Donald Tuck's Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, which has a cut-off date of December 1968 - there were Extras issued after that but they were rarely genuine SFBC reprints.\n\nThe assertion in Tuck that LORD OF THE RINGS was offered as an SFBC Extra twice - in December 1960 and December 1961 - is almost certainly an error. The information to hand certainly shows the December 1960 offer of a Readers Union reprint (not in SFBC guise) of LOTR, but there is nothing yet to show either an Extra offer in 1961 nor a RU reprint in that year.\n\nPlease note - there is no mention of Mitchison's MEMOIRS OF A SPACEWOMAN in Tuck, but according to SCIENCE FICTION NEWS it was issued on October 1963, and copies do exist. Similarly the ARTHUR C CLARKE OMNIBUS, SPECTRUM 4 and ANALOG ANTHOLOGY are not in Tuck ; regarding this last it seems the copies distributed were the normal publisher's (in this case Dennis Dobson) edition. Certainly many later, post-1970, 'Extras' were regular publishers editions sold at discount via the bookclub, they were not SFBC editions.\n\nThere are at least two other arguable Extras known - one was in a sense unrelated to SFBC but was heavily promoted as an optional extra to SFBC Members. This is Kurt Vonnegut's CAT'S CRADLE, issued as part of the Contemporary Fiction Book Club but cross-promoted at a special rate to SFBC members for obvious reasons for a period after July 1965. Also a non-fiction work, Rudolf Thiele's AND THERE WAS LIGHT, a popular astronomy book, was also promoted as an Extra, but it is unclear as to whether it was a specifically SFBC issue."
