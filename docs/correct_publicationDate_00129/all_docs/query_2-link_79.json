        "text": "Hypothesis: The human brain only uses the smallest part of its potential. If one could be trained to make use of the rest, virtually anything would be possible: telepathy, telekinesis, levitation, clairvoyance...\n\nIn Lost Legacy that is exactly what happens. Three people find they have enormous powers – a doctor can heal without the use of surgery or medicine – a lecturer can instruct without the use of words – a woman can drive without looking at the road ahead. But why have they got these powers? Can any human being be trained to develop their own ‘unknown’ abilities? Only a trip to the ancient mountain of Shasta can provide the answers.\n\nHypothesis: If one could change the genetic structure of any living being, then virtually any variation of life could be created in any shape, size or form.\n\nJerry Was a Man explores these possibilities, from a miniature elephant capable of communicating with humans to a flying horse… with all the sinister implications that such manipulation might engender.\n\nTwo powerful stories of speculative fiction from the acknowledged master, Robert A. Heinlein.\n\nThe Pursuit of the Pankera, by the legendary author of the classic bestseller Starship Troopers, is one of the most audacious experiments ever done in science fiction.\n\nRobert A. Heinlein’s The Number of the Beast, which was published in 1980, followed the adventures of Zeb, Deety, Hilda, and Jake when they are ambushed by the alien “Black Hats” and barely escape with their lives on a specially configured vehicle (the Gay Deceiver) that can travel along various planes of existence, allowing them to visit parallel universes.\n\nHowever, unknown to most fans, Heinlein had already written a “parallel” novel about the four characters and parallel universes in 1977. He effectively wrote two parallel novels about parallel universes. The novels share the same start, but as soon as the Gay Deceiver is used to transport them to a parallel universe, each book transports them to a totally different parallel world.\n\nFrom that point on, the plot lines diverge completely. The Number of the Beast morphs into something very different, more representative of Heinlein’s later works, whereas The Pursuit of the Pankera remains on target with a much more traditional Heinleinesque storyline and ending, reminiscent of his earlier works.\n\nThe Pursuit of the Pankera was never published, and there have been many competing theories as to why (including significant copyright issues in 1977). Over time the manuscript was largely forgotten, although it survived in fragments. A recent re-examination of these fragments made it clear that, put together in the right order, they constituted the complete novel.\n\nAnd here it finally is: Heinlein’s audacious experiment. A fitting farewell from one of the most inventive science fiction writers to have ever lived: a parallel novel about parallel universes as well as a great adventure pitting the forces of good versus evil in the way that only Heinlein could do."
