        "text": "This chapter addresses issues such as the history of plant knowledge within the Western context, the specificity of plants’ bodily functions, intelligent behavior and sensitivity in plants, their sex life and botanical queerness, technologically augmented plants, the future environments of plants on the earth and beyond, human-plant ethics, and finally, the imperative to ‘‘follow plants,’’ that is, to look to plants’ lives for inspiration on how to coexist with them and with others.\n\n\"This article argues for a specifically Darwinian etiology of the image of the monstrous plant, so ubiquitous in the modern genres of speculative fiction. In the profusion of such narratives in the late 19th century, we can identify a collective anxiety about the implications of universal common descent: acknowledging a shared evolutionary heritage for plants and animals threatens the boundary between the two kingdoms that had always permitted the purely instrumentalist and exploitative relationship between humans and plants. Evolutionary anxiety projected onto the figure of the man-eating plant only multiplied in the early pulp magazines, and continued on through John Wyndham's triffids and beyond. Considering the many monstrous plants of early speculative fiction in this way can help expand the purview of the critical formation known as animal studies: while this paper does not advocate for the development of a \"plant studies,\" it invites further thinking about the implications of taking the word \"species\" in animal studies a little more literally, as the word so often seems to mean “mammal species\" or \"animal species.\"\n\nThis issue of Antennae is the first of three installments entirely dedicated to plants in art and culture. The first focuses on different modalities of representation, the second on plant-encounters, and the third on networks. How we represent plants speaks volumes about our conceptions of their being and our intentions as well as our responsibilities towards them. It is the idea of responsibility that drives this extensive publishing project. Artists and scholars have the responsibility to shift plants to the fore of their preoccupations and to investigate the historical and cultural networks that bind us to them. Plants support all life on this planet and our lack of interest in them is certainly linked to climate change and general environmental deterioration. Paying attention to plants is essential to the possibility of conceiving a better, more equitable, and sustainable future.\n\nDownload free at www.antennae.org.uk The contributions gathered in the third volume of 'Vegetal Entanglements'—a tryptic entirely dedicated to plants in art and culture—focus on the inextricable, actual, and metaphorical links that bind plants, ecosystems, and humans. In this issue, the interconnectedness that characterizes plant lives is explored through a variety of media and approaches designed to foreground vegetal alterity.
