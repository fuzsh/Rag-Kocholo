Title:A Portrait of Donald Knuth Size:8" × 10" (~20 cm × 25 cm) Media: Acrylic on Canvas Panel Framed: Yes Price:Private Commission

Donald Knuth is probably best known for his ongoing work, The Art of Computer Programming, and the creation of TeX (the Greek letters tau epsilon chi, pronounced "tech"), a digital typography system. During the time he was writing Volumes 1 - 3 of The Art of Computer Programming, Knuth became dissatisfied with the way the equations were being typeset in his books, so he spent 10 years inventing TeX to solve the problem. TeX is widely used in publishing today, and in 1999, The Art of Computer Programming volumes were honoured along with writings by Einstein and Mandelbrot (and many others) as one of the best scientific monographs of the century.

To complete this artwork, I researched many images of Knuth as well as his personal homepage, and took into consideration much commentary from the individual that commissioned the painting. Knuth serves him as a role model, in his own words:

"Knuth serves as an inspiration to me as a computer scientist because he believes in doing things the Right Way. His principal fascination is making things elegant. In this world of Windows, AOL, and other crappy software, this painting of Knuth will smile down upon me while I am coding and remind me that programmers can produce beautiful things too."
