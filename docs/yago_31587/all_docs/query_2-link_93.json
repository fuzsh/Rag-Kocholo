        "text": "Donald Knuth is an American computer scientist, mathematician, and professor emeritus at Stanford University. He began writing \"The Art of Computer Programming\" in 1962, which is a comprehensive monograph that covers various programming algorithms and their analysis. The work is divided into multiple volumes that cover different aspects of computer programming such as fundamental algorithms, sorting and searching, and syntactic algorithms. In developing the book, Knuth also popularized the use of asymptotic notation or \"Big O\" notation to characterize the growth rate of functions. Frustrated with publishing tools at the time, he developed the TeX computer typesetting system, which later became known as LaTeX. Knuth is strongly opposed to software patents, arguing that ideas that should be easily"
