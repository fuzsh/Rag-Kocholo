        "text": "This is a transcript of an interview with the guy by Dikran Karagueuzian, the director of CSLI Publications, videotaped in 2006. Copyright 2006 Web of Stories Ltd., but the version of the transcript on their web site is just unreadable; this is my effort to clean it up a bit. It’s about 63 000 words, so it is probably around three or four hours of reading. Printed, it would be about 110 pages.\n\nPatches to improve the formatting and correct errors are welcome. Please don’t refill the paragraphs, though; it creates unnecessary merge conflicts.\n\nI know lots of people are going to hate the random boldface. But the interview, like any record of an extempore speech, is not really organized into headings, subheadings, and the like. The boldface is my attempt to pull out the main topics of each paragraph so that it’s possible to skim through the document to find a particular topic.\n\nIf you want to go way back, if you go like, 16 of my great-great-grandparents, in 1840 they all would have been in Germany, but by 1870, they all were in America. So if you know, consider all the different lines. My mother; my father’s, the Knuth part of my ancestry was the most diverse, in a way. He came from Schleswig-Holstein, rather near the border with Denmark, and he was the last to come over; during the Schleswig-Holstein crisis in the 1860s; I think it was 1864, probably, he went AWOL from the army; he didn’t want to fight against the Prussians, and he decided to come to America, and knocked on the window one night, and told his parents, I’m out of here, and wound up in Illinois, and then worked, learned to be a blacksmith at that time.\n\nSo then his wife was somebody he met in America. She had come — her family had come over earlier from the Hannover area, and she lived in Indiana, all very near Chicago area, and so that part of the family is from a different part of Germany. My mother’s side came; they all emigrated in 1840s, and they were farmers in the area of what is now Niedersachsen; it’s a small town in Germany called Bad Essen, and they, her family came and were farmers in Ohio, near Cleveland, Ohio. So they, yeah, the background then is, my father’s side round Chicago, where he was born and grew up, and my mother’s side from Cleveland Ohio, where she was born.\n\nMy dad’s first teaching assignment was in Cleveland, and that’s where he met my mom. Then he got a call to Milwaukee, which was way far from any of their, you know, anybody else in the family, because it was a job that opened up, so he went and took this job at a school that needed a teacher.\n\nIt all started in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 1938, I was born. I don’t remember anything about the first few years of my life, but I know a little bit from records that my parents kept that they were kind of unusual at that time, in introducing me to reading. All of their friends said that I shouldn’t, that I would be bored in school if they would do much reading for me, before I actually went to school, but I was — I guess I was the youngest bookworm in the Milwaukee Public Library.\n\nSo that’s the first, news I have from the past, because they saved a newspaper clipping. I guess I was like two and a half years old and I had become a bookworm at the Milwaukee Library. I start remembering things more when I get, you know, when I get into school, and I went to a small school at our church.\n\nMy father was a teacher there. His life’s work was to be an educator in the Lutheran School System, and their salaries weren’t much to speak of. I think, I think it was something like ten or $15 a month. But it was a very warm, loving community. We were pretty much ignorant of what’s going on in the world, but happy and sort of a stable, nice place to grow up. And when I was in First Grade my dad was the Second Grade teacher, but then he moved on so that when I got into the Second Grade he was the Fourth Grade teacher, and when I got into Fourth Grade, he was the Sixth Grade teacher. And finally, when I got into Sixth Grade, he went on to teach in high school, so, fortunately, I never had my dad as one of my teachers.\n\nIn this school we had about oh, I think 20, 25 kids, and our teachers weren’t real strong on Science or Mathematics, they were, but they were pretty good in English. They- like in Seventh Grade, I remember, that several of us would spend time after school, diagramming sentences; you know, take sentences of English that weren’t in the book, and figure out what’s the subject and the predicate, and how do the, you know, how do the phrases go in, so we, our teacher inspired us to know a lot about the English language, and by the time we got to high school, the teachers there in high school really didn’t know that much about English, so that was the only time I remember being bored, because we already knew everything that they were going to teach us in high school.\n\nSo the high school I went to, again, was a Lutheran high school. The people who work in these schools are, like my dad, doing it as kind of a mission, or, I don’t know, not, they consider it their life’s calling to be good teachers, and so we really had people who took a genuine interest in us, and were not, not in their job just because it was a job, but because it was something that they felt was an important service to the world. Some people think that the church schools are places where they teach intolerance and you know, that you’re supposed to only be, what do you say anyway? Only, only be appreciating of people who are like you, and so on, but that was absolutely not the case. I think we had a very good experience and it was, there was, one of my teachers was a little bit prejudiced against blacks, but he stood out, and we didn’t pay any attention to him.\n\nSo it was a, I think a really nice way to grow up, but nothing world class, in any sense of special, or, you know, special knowledge or unusual.\n\nI think I was kind of a wise guy, I think, I’d often sit in the back of the class and crack jokes, and the teachers didn’t, didn’t really like, the way, you know, my attitude. But you know, they learned to live with it, and I didn’t get, I didn’t get spanked too often.\n\nWe had good music also, in the school, for singing, and, but we also had a lot of freedom, so I remember like, we had a circle of four or five friends, and when we were in Fifth and Sixth Grade, we started doing some little projects, like we got hold of a tape recorder, this was in the 1940s, and we tried to write scripts for fake radio programs, and we pretended we were on the radio, and we put on these little shows, and recorded them.\n\nMy friends and I started a school newspaper. We called it “Newsweak”, spelled W, E, A, K, of course. And in that paper we would tell stories about things going on in the school, but also we recycled a lot of corny jokes we had seen in books, and had a puzzle page and things like that. But that was when I, I had my first experience in writing, and as I say, we had good English in that school, so from early on, I had a lot of training in things that had to do with languages, and then a chance to do some creative work with things like these skits.\n\nI should say something about my mom, who was also very important in my life, of course. She was unusual also at that time, because she had a good job. My parents were the first in their families, in the whole history of our family, to have some kind of education. My dad had gone to a teachers training college in Chicago, and my mother had taken one or two years of training as a secretary, as a legal secretary.\n\nAnd in the, during the Second World War, she got a job working for a man in downtown Milwaukee, who owned and managed several of the skyscrapers in town, downtown, and she became his personal secretary, and later a Trustee of the, of these, of some of the organisations that owned the property, and the time of his death she was, she had been doing rather well, and was asked to be, asked to be the manager of one of the buildings, so she spent her life working in real estate in Milwaukee with the large commercial buildings in the downtown area. And she had started doing this part time work, when I was five or six years old, but still doing everything else at home, as well.\n\nMy, but my grandfather was, my great-grandfather was a blacksmith, my grandfather was, my grandfathers on both sides, were in construction work, and maintenance. There was not a family tradition of education, and I certainly was the first one ever to go on to higher levels of education. It’s partly the story of America, of course, that more and more people are going to college, but when I was in high school, at that time still, it was, I think something like 7% or 8% of my classmates went on to college, and that was considered pretty good at that time.)\n\nI guess I can say a little bit more about my parents’ finances. Of course they were married during the Depression, and my dad’s first job, when he came to Milwaukee, they decided after a year, that they should cut his salary by $5 a month, and they told him that he would learn thrift, and he would, you know, this would be good for him, to, and of course the church was always having trouble with fundraising, but our family didn’t have an automobile till 1951, which is when I was in Seventh Grade.\n\nWe took our first, you know, auto trip at that time, to my mother’s family in Ohio. Before that we had gone once or twice a year by train, and rarely would relatives from Illinois or Ohio be able to come to visit us.\n\nWe, my dad would always ride his bicycle to work, and my mother, well, Milwaukee had good public transportation, and in fact it was a very safe city; completely different from now, when, because of drugs and things now, but when I was growing up, I could, I would always ride the streetcar downtown at all hours of the day and night. Now you take your life in your hands doing this. You know, no parent would let their child do any of the things that we were doing.\n\nI was, once I took the streetcar; I don’t know how old I was, but I think it was, you know, maybe Fourth or Fifth Grade, and I took the streetcar downtown, and went to the public library, and I started reading books, and I didn’t know that the library hours, that the library was closing, and the lights went off, so I went over to a window, where I could sit, and I kept reading, and finally the people, you know, and my parents didn’t, were wondering what happened to me, why didn’t I come home?\n\nBut somebody at the library found me, you know, just in the stacks, reading the books, and but you know, still they wouldn’t worry too much about letting kids go around the city, and so my mother would take the streetcar downtown to her work, and we never thought of having an automobile until they could finally afford something from the little jobs that my dad would take outside of his teaching experience.\n\nHe would; he and his friends got together and they invested in the stock market, what they called penny stocks. You could buy stocks in various mining companies. He met a man at the, I think it was at a, what do you call it? A bathhouse? Or, you know, a public bath, where you can go for a hot bath, and met a man there who introduced him to some people from Colorado who were into mining and so then they decided they were going to make some money this way.\n\nWell, I inherited all these stock certificates now, which make great wallpaper, but they, you know; they’re completely useless. One of the stocks, however, did well. It was called Silver Bell Mine, and we’ve, eventually we went out to Colorado, visited the place, and saw the, you know, we, the stock was sold to Union Oil eventually, and made a little bit of money on that. So, and my parents bought stock in Walt Disney, and that kept doubling and multiplying.\n\nSo by working hard and saving money, throughout my mom’s life; she died at almost age 90, and she never retired, she stayed working in real estate, even in her late 80s they had an office for her downtown, and she could come in, maybe three days a week, and, but putting money in the bank, and being a generous person, and contributing to charity and so on, but she had accumulated an estate of more than $1 million, by the time that she died. And this surprised everybody including her.\n\nBut they were, my dad was the bookkeeper for the high school, and so he took some classes in accounting, and so he spent a lot of his time actually filling out what we’d call spreadsheets now. And he’d stay keeping track of little transactions with stocks. The, so, I think it’s interesting to see that the way they could, just by being responsible citizens, make a good life for themselves, the way the times were in our country at that period. And this idea of personal responsibility was something I always took for granted, because I got it from my parents. So it never occurred to me that there was any other way to live.\n\nBack in high school, my main activities in high school, at, it was called Lutheran High School, and then during my Senior year it split into two schools, Milwaukee Lutheran High School, which was the one I’d went to, and Wisconsin Lutheran High School.\n\n1956 was the year I graduated, and that, well, the place where again I didn’t have special, teachers who were specialists in a world class sense, but they were always real interested in nurturing us.\n\nI went on to be a mathematician, but the math, but I didn’t have any interest very much in Math at the time in high school, because my, I would ask questions to my teachers, and they didn’t know the answer. So I could prove that one was equal to zero, and they couldn’t find any mistakes in the proof, and so you know, I couldn’t, and so, why should I go in, you know, go into mathematics? So my main interest at that time was in music, and also in physics.\n\nMy chemistry/physics teacher was a wonderful man, who sort of wrote his own textbook, he designed the chemical experiments, and I had a great admiration for him, and he encouraged me to you know, to think some about physics, and although I spent most of my time in music, outside of school.\n\nIn fact I, well I played the piano with the high school chorus, I sang in the chorus, I was in the band, I played the saxophone and I played the tuba in the band, and I played, you know, in the All-City, the Milwaukee All-City Band, or Symphonic Band. I wrote music, I arranged music for bands. I had, I had, at the time I took a; I was a big fan of Mad Magazine.\n\nAnd also of Roger Price, if anybody remembers Roger Price, and he had written a short story called “Milton and the Rhinoceros”. And so I made a take off on Prokofiev’s “Peter and the Wolf”, with the words from “Milton and the Rhinoceros”. I was very naïve at the time; I had no idea about copyrights, or anything, so I took Prokofiev’s music, and I scored it for band, and I took Roger Price’s words, “Milton and the Rhinoceros”, and I made this, this piece for, I don’t know, 20 minutes or something like this, for our, for our high school band to perform. And I proudly gave this to our band director, and he lost it, and I’ve never seen it again.\n\nSo I have no idea whether it’s any good, or whatever, but there it was.\n\nI also started the school newspaper. I was Editor of the paper, and during my Senior year, I would do an all-nighter every Monday night. I stayed up the whole night, getting the paper done by seven o’clock in the morning. We didn’t have a professional way to produce it, so I produced it on a mimeograph machine, which was something that’s way obsolete now, but it uses very greasy ink, and the reason I did that was because we happened to have one at our house.\n\nMy dad did part time work for an architect in Milwaukee, printing up the specifications, and you know, he could make a little freelance money this way to supplement his meagre salary, and he also used this machine to typeset music for local choirs, and so I had this machine at home, and also some electric typewriter that he had, or maybe my mother had; anyway we had it at home, so I could produce our school newspaper at home, without having to worry about fancy typesetting, but we had a lot of reporters, and I wrote some features for it, like crossword puzzles, and things like that. So again, I was doing a lot of writing in my spare time, during high school.\n\nI worked on the Yearbook and other publications as well, and friends of mine, friends and I wrote plays that were put on by groups in the high school. So it was a fun time. But I would say at that part of my life I was pretty much a, like a machine, an autom-, I mean I was just, I would just learn, absorb stuff, and take tests and you know, get 100% on the tests if I could, without really sitting back and taking a look at finer things in life, or something like this. I was a, I was a dutiful child who said, okay, you’re supposed to go to school Don, so I went to school, and you’re supposed to learn, so I learned, and I had fun on the side with some of these writing projects, but I really wouldn’t read a book unless it was assigned to me.\n\nSometimes I would read, I remember, I’m a very slow reader, and I remember Bleak House, by Charles Dickens, with 60, 70 chapters, and I, it took me so long to read it that I had to use it for two book reports instead of one, and I didn’t; so it wasn’t until I was in my 30s before I actually found some of the great literature of the world and read it for my own pleasure.\n\nIn high school, well I guess I was a fairly successful machine, because they said that my, okay, in those days they didn’t give just letter grades, like A, B, C, but they gave a number grade, and based on you know, when you took an exam, they would average these scores, and they would grade your homework and it was all based on a zero to 100 system, and they said that my average which was more than 97.5 was a record for the school that hadn’t been achieved before, so I was pretty much a nerd of nerds at that time.\n\nRather than sceptical, cynical, I would prefer satirical or something.\n\nKARAGUEUZIAN: Satirical.\n\nKNUTH: But anyway, that’s why I liked Mad Magazine, because it was like crazy type of satire on the sacred cows of the day, and so when my friends and I discovered in high school, you know, we devoured every page, and it was a special, you know, mad about Mad. We, and before that, as I said, I had the corny jokes, but my friends and I tended to be wise-cracking and not to take things too seriously.\n\nAlthough I said I was a machine, but I did also like to laugh, and so when I was writing for the paper, we always had sections about jokes, and we always had you know, in our Yearbook we had fun things in there that weren’t expected. So I’ve carried that through, as you know, and many; there are lots of corny jokes in the indexes to my books now that people probably haven’t discovered yet, but somebody will ask me, why do I have a reference to Bo Derek in The TeXbook? And it turns out that just all the pages which are cited in the index for Bo Derek is where I used the number ten, so all the way through I’ve had this silly streak of some sort that means I don’t take everything too seriously.\n\nWhile I’m on the subject of Mad Magazine, I might as well mention that then I did a project in my senior year, which was submitted to the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, well, no, first to the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, which is now called the Intel Science Talent Search or something, but it’s a nationwide competition, and it was called the Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures. This is a Polish word that was very popular in Mad Magazine, and I decided to base a system of weights and measures that was going to be better than the metric system. It was based on the thickness of Mad Magazine number 26, or something like this, and that was taken as one potrzebie of length. And then we had, you know, a kilo potrzebie was 1,000 of those, and a fershlugginer potrzebie was a million — and a farshimmelt potrzebie one millionth. We had units of time, weight, everything, in the system.\n\nAnd it won honorable mention in this Science Talent Search, and also was, I did some demos at the Academy of Sciences; it won an award in Wisconsin. I submitted it them to Mad Magazine, and they published it; they paid me $25, for it, and it came out in, during the spring of my Freshman year in college, and this was my first technical publication, so it is listed on my vita, you know, and publication number one is the Potrzebie System of Weights and measures, and it was published later in paperback in one of the Mad reprints, and it, and I used it as a basis of running for student government in college, and it failed miserably, you know, I didn’t get elected.\n\nI also sent a sequel to Mad, which was a crossword puzzle. One of their, the Alfred E. Neuman figure is one of the, was featured on lots of their articles, and this silly boy’s face with the missing tooth, and when I looked at his teeth, I could see, you know, white squares and black squares, reminding me of a crossword puzzle. So I added more white squares and black squares up in his forehead area, and where his hair is, and I filled, and I made that into a crossword puzzle with Mad-type clues, like, you know, “blank, me worry?”, or something like this, and I submitted that, and they rejected that, you know, they didn’t want, but I’ve still got it, and later on when we get to writing,\n\nI’m hoping that I’ll someday publish a book called Selected Papers on Fun and Games. We will not only reprint my first technical article on the Potrzebie System, but also the one that was rejected by Mad, and we will see the; people will decide whether they, you know, will be able to decide now whether they made the right decision in rejecting it.\n\nSo yeah, I like to see things sort of out of the box as well as in the box.\n\nMy parents were asked whether or not they should advance me a grade, because I was doing well in school. And they; in fact I was born in January, which meant that I was older than most of the kids in my class, because if I’d been born in December, I would have gone to school a year earlier, so I was one of the oldest in my class, and my parents, you know, a lot of kids at that time were being pushed ahead in school, and one of my friends, you know, graduated from college when he would normally have been entering high school.\n\nWell I, but I’m glad that they resisted this, because it gave me this time for all these extra-curricular activities, so I was always into a lot of things. I mean sports; I was a terrible athlete. I’m tall, but my left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing, so I would only get in the game after we were already behind by 50 points, and, but I was the scorekeeper.\n\nI was a terrific scorekeeper, you know, so I became manager of many of the sports teams in high school, and also in college. I was manager of the cross-country team, I was manager of the basketball team, I was manager of the baseball team, so I was a six or seven letter man without being able to do anything athletics, you know, whatever.\n\nBut I’m sitting there at the score table during the basketball tournament, and- a basketball game, and like, I’m talking a mile a minute to keep the other scorekeeper confused, so that he wouldn’t know, you know, if somebody said, who’s the fouler? And I could tell them, you know, who the foul was on, based on, you know, who it was most desirable for us to have the foul be on, rather than the person who really committed the foul, because the guy’s, you know, very mixed up by the way I’m talking. But anyway, I don’t think I won too many games at the scoring table, but I was the person who went along with the team and kept the scorebooks.\n\nBut all these extra-curricular activities were something that I had time to do, because my parents hadn’t advanced me, and so you know, I could do well in my classes but also participate in lots of other things.\n\nNow my, but, you know, so here I am, doing rather well at school, but I’ve still got an inferiority complex. I’m still always trying to prove myself. I’m thinking, you know, maybe I’m not getting it well, and in fact, so I was probably taking, you know, studying hard and getting 100s on these exams, because I’m trying to prove that I knew it. You know; if I was really overconfident, so confident, I wouldn’t have bothered to study. And that was, so that was one of the child’s eyes looking at it. I’m always scared that I’m not going to do well, so I was working hard at schoolwork.\n\nThe funny thing was that my; when I was being advised what to do for college, well, everybody in my school took a whole bunch of tests, national tests, and one of the tests was vocational, you know, what job are you cut out for? And I remember that that, according to that test, I should be an architect, and I should not be a veterinarian. I scored extremely low on veterinarian skills, but for architect, that seemed to be the career path that was recommended to me.\n\nBut the, and I won scholarships to different colleges, but the people at my high school, the Vice Principal called me in; he said, “Don, I think you’re going to be a failure in college”. He said, you know, you’ve done well here in high school, but college is completely different, and you’re just, you know, it’s just going to be too much for you, you’re not going to, you aren’t going to make it. And, well, so he scared me again, and when I got to college I kept studying.\n\nIn fact, just the week before college, the Dean of Students, whoever it was, told us. I went to Case institute of Technology in Cleveland, which was at that time not yet connected with Western Reserve University. So I went to Case, and the Dean of Case says to us, says, it’s a all men’s school, says, “Men, look at, look to the person on your left, and the person on your right. One of you isn’t going to be here next year; one of you is going to fail.” So I get to Case, and again I’m studying all the time, working really hard on my classes, and so for that I had to be kind of a machine.\n\nI, the calculus book that I had, in high school we — in high school, as I said, our math program wasn’t much, and I had never heard of calculus until I got to college. But the calculus book that we had was great, and in the back of the book there were supplementary problems that weren’t, you know, that weren’t assigned by the teacher. The teacher would assign, so this was a famous calculus text by a man named George Thomas, and I mention it especially because it was one of the first books published by Addison-Wesley, and I loved this calculus book so much that later I chose Addison-Wesley to be the publisher of my own book.\n\nBut Thomas’s Calculus would have the text, then would have problems, and our teacher would assign, say, the even numbered problems, or something like that. I would also do the odd numbered problems. In the back of Thomas’s book he had supplementary problems, the teacher didn’t assign the supplementary problems; I worked the supplementary problems. I was, you know, I was scared I wouldn’t learn calculus, so I worked hard on it, and it turned out that of course it took me longer to solve all these problems than the kids who were only working on what was assigned, at first. But after a year, I could do all of those problems in the same time as my classmates were doing the assigned problems, and after that I could just coast in mathematics, because I’d learned how to solve problems. So it was good that I was scared, in a way that I, you know, that made me start strong, and then I could coast afterwards, rather than always climbing and being on a lower part of the learning curve.\n\nIn high school, as I said, mathematics was just confusing to me. When I got to Case, though, the teachers, the chemistry teacher was, seemed to know chemistry okay, but he didn’t know anything about physics or math. My physics teacher knew physics and chemistry, but my math teacher knew all three subjects, and I had terrific respect for him, because he seemed really smart, and also he was very hard to please. No matter, you know, I could show him what I was doing in calculus, but he would, he never seemed to be impressed, so this was frustrating to me. I’d never had a teacher that I couldn’t impress, you know, so I worked even harder at my math. But he had a good sense of humor, and his name was Paul Guenther. And finally, after two years, I was able to impress him a little bit, and so this was good. But I developed an interest in Mathematics, but I have to go back a little bit.\n\nI, when I was choosing what college to go to, I had won several scholarships, and one of the scholarships would have been to Valparaiso University in Indiana, associated with the Lutheran Church, and it was, but there I would have been a major in music, and the other scholarship was to Case in Cleveland, which was where I would major in physics, and since my mother’s family is from Cleveland, she knew that Case had very high standards, and very few people that she knew were able even to be admitted to Case, and there was, considered to be one of the hardest schools to do. I’d never heard of MIT, by the way, until some years later, or much less Caltech. But Case, to me, was a challenge, where I would really have to work hard and well, Valparaiso, it would be something where I could just do some; music would seem to me much easier. And I decided to go for the challenge, at Case, and I was admitted to; they had a special section for Freshmen, called the Honors Section, where 20 of us were given, were taught each of our classes by the heads of departments. So I really had the, Case’s best, you know, physics teacher, chemistry teacher, math teacher and English teacher.\n\nI believe it was the first year they had tried this, and I’m not sure how long they continued the experiment, but the teachers, but what they called us the Honor Section, and this just meant that 20 of us just took all our classes together, while other students would tend to mix. I don’t think the other students all spent Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday the same as, the same hours, like we did. And so the classes that I had, then I think they challenged us a little more too, than they challenged the other students, perhaps.\n\nStill, I had time to do you know, to work on the school paper and to, one of the important issues of going to Case at that time was to join a fraternity. The, most of the interesting action on campus would be centered around the fraternity system, and so I pledged a fraternity also in my Freshman year, and I guess I can say more about that.\n\nBut I had mentioned that during the spring of my freshman year is when my Mad Magazine article came out, you know, and so that well, that led later to, later on I was editor of a magazine that we founded at Case, called Engineering and Science Review, which wrote about topics in science, and I wrote an article about Potrzebie System for that publication. I was in the music, I was in the basketball; I was manager of the basketball team, at Case.\n\nAnd I’ll say a few words about that, because after I got into computers later on, I combined that with my managing the Basketball team. So I devised a strange formula that I don’t believe in much any more, but anyway, I had it at the time, where you could compute each basketball player’s real contribution to the game.\n\nNot just the points that he made, the baskets that he made, but really you know, taking everything into account, so for example, if you have possession of the ball in basketball, this is worth something. In fact, when you’re watching a basketball game, if you sort of add one point to the score of the team who has the ball that sort of gives a more fair indication of what the real score is of the game. So possession of the ball is worth maybe one point. You can work it out after the game; you can say, really, how many times, when you had possession of the ball did you really turn over, and fumble it, or you know, how many points did you really get during that series? And so you can work out that it may be worth only seven-tenths of a point or something like this. But anyway, possession of the ball is worth something. So if you fumble, then you’ve lost your team one point, or seven-tenths of a point. So that’s a minus something for you. If you steal the ball, if you recover a fumble, you gain; your team gains possession, so you get credit for stealing the ball.\n\nIf you make a basket, in those days it was only two points, you don’t have the three-point shots in those days, but if you can make a basket you get two points, but your team also loses possession, the other team gets possession, so you don’t really; you didn’t really win two points for your team when you made the basket, you made two points, but you have to subtract from that, the fact that you have to get the ball again.\n\nSo at the end, according to my formula, the sum of all the players’ contributions would be the amount by which our team won or lost. But it would rate, you know, if somebody makes a shot and misses, then sometimes our team gets the rebound, sometimes the other team gets the rebound, so I, you lose a little bit for taking a shot and missing. So I calculated a huge number of statistics for every player, and I had a spotter, who would call to me, and I could write it down, every little thing, and after the game I would go and punch cards that recorded all these statistics, and fed them into a little computer program that calculated the formula and made a list for every player, what their real contribution to the game was, not just the field goals and all these traditional statistics.\n\nSo Case’s Coach, Nip Heim, loved this system, and you know, he posted these numbers, and the Case News Service was always good at trying to plant interesting stories in the local paper, so they sent reporters out to, and we showed, you know, told about this formula, and IBM heard about it. So IBM sent out a cameraman, a camera crew, to make a film of me spotting a game, you know, and there, our Case team playing basketball of course, but then, how I would punch the cards, you know, and put it into the IBM computer. Before they took the shot of the IBM computer, they planted a great, big IBM sign on the machine, so that nobody could fail to miss it, you know, that I was doing this, and then I’m turning the buttons on the console, and getting the numbers out, and it’s getting printed out on the IBM printer, and then the Coach is looking at it and posting this up.\n\nSo this was a little movie that I was in, about two or three minutes long. IBM supplies this movie to CBS, and they put it on the Sunday Evening News with Walter Cronkite, and all my relatives in Florida can see me on TV. This was very exciting. Also US News and World Report ran a story about it, and so this was my connection between computing and sports, when I was at Case. This was also a clever way for IBM to get their advertisements in there, rather subtly, but it was a fun.\n\nThat was when I first realized how hard it must be to be a movie star, because I had to walk through these scenes six times everything, you know, punch those cards over and over again. So I can see, how could Audrey Hepburn possibly look so beautiful after the sixth take, you know?\n\nAt Case, as I said, I pledged a fraternity. That was one of the things that — I’d met a few Case graduates in Milwaukee, or Case students, before, and they said — oh, Don, fraternities are the big thing at; you’ve got to take that very seriously when you go there. Well, anyway, the fraternity system was maybe a little different then than it is now. It certainly had its pros and cons, but it was a big; it was certainly a focus of my life at Case, because after my freshman year I would live at the fraternity, and with all my fraternity brothers.\n\nThe first thing, though, was something we called Hell Week. Raising. This is, or hazing, I mean. I’m sorry, forget that I said raising. And for seven days, all of us pledges, before we could become full-fledged fraternity members, were at the mercy of all the other brothers, who would have their paddles, and also, you know, we were sleep deprived, and basically they were, we were also cleaning the fraternity house, so that’s when I learned about ammonia and painting things, and scrubbing walls, and doing other, you know, fixing the roof, and things like this, that we would be doing, but then, but meanwhile they would also, they would play tennis where we were the balls, and they would, you know, swat us, and it hurt; and do other things to make sure that, you know, we knew that they had the power and we were just unimportant now.\n\nSo this is illegal now, and, but it was my equivalent of going through boot camp, I guess, which, you know, I never went into military service. And, you know, I matured an awful lot during that week. After that week, and I’d gotten through without the, you know, this time, I had a confidence that I’d never had before, so it’s hard for me to say that I wouldn’t want my son to go through the same thing. I don’t think he ever did, but it’s a paradoxical thing, in my estimation. Still, that was part of getting into the fraternity, and I have a picture of myself that they took at the end of it, unshaven, and looking pretty beat, but still knowing that I had come through an ordeal, which was something; it’s a question in my mind, how to really give that education to somebody in a way that is legal, would be legal. Now we’d have people suing.\n\nAt my fraternity, my best friend, who was also in the Honor Section at Case, his name is Bill Davis, he now, by the way, is a mathematics professor at Ohio State, and is very active in internet online education for teaching mathematics, but anyway, Bill and I were bosom buddies during my freshman year, and he, and then also in the sophomore year we both pledged Theta Chi fraternity, and so then we also went through Hell Week together and had rooms next to each other in the fraternity house.\n\nSo I started to date a girl at Western Reserve University; her name was Betsy, and her roommate was named Jill, and Bill was dating Jill, so I was — now, Betsy was Catholic, and I was Lutheran, and this was something that we thought, well, our families would never be able to understand, but still I thought that Betsy was pretty terrific, but I was also dating a girl named Becky, a Jewish girl, whose father owned a department store in Cleveland and I was dating some nurses too, you know, there were lots of girls would hang out around the Case area, and, but I was mostly interested in this Betsy, and I was, I decided to, and we’d had double dates with Bill Davis and his girl Jill, and as I said, Betsy and Jill were roommates; Bill and I were roommates.\n\nSo I was wondering, you know, how I’d ever be able to make more of a hit with Betsy, and I decided I would have lunch with Jill, to ask her for advice. And so this was probably the, my sophomore year, the spring of my sophomore year, and, you know, she was such a good listener, and gave such good advice, that I started dating Jill instead, and well, I’m not sure Bill ever forgave me for that, but she didn’t really like him, she thought, she said, well, anyway.\n\nWell, anyway, Jill is the one that I eventually got pinned to, and engaged to and married to, and we’ve been married now for 45 years. And Jill and I started having dates in the library, where we would study together, and, you know, I found that I enjoyed kisses for the first time, when they came from her. In high school I was afraid to kiss girls, even when they would stand up.\n\nI mean, I was dating a girl in high school who was about four and a half feet tall, I don’t remember her name any more, but I remember that she was real cute, because, I always liked short girls, because they seemed to, you know, have a good balance, they didn’t fall over as easily as tall ones, and I, being tall, I was, you know, but she was a cheerleader, and she stood on the steps of her house, and with her lips turned up, and I figured I’d got to kiss her, but I’d never done this before, how am I going to do it you know.\n\nAnd so I did, but I never realized how good it could be until I kissed Jill, when I was a sophomore.\n\nI’m not a real involved with the groovy set, I guess, throughout all my student time, and I remember then Jill and I started getting to know each other real well, and we would go to church together on Sundays. She was a Methodist, I, we studied, we went to Bible Study classes at her church on Sunday School. I had never gone to Sunday School, because I went to a Lutheran School as a child. We had something about Bible during the week, so why should I do something, why should I do anything more on Sunday? I’ve had plenty of religion during the week. But she had gone to public school and she, her tradition was to go to study the Bible on Sunday mornings, and so I went with her to church, and I learned something about that.\n\nIn college, our teachers were, I was introduced to lots of atheists, and people from lots of different religious experiences and this was something totally different, totally foreign to my previous experience, and I, so I went through a time of personal challenge, where I was trying to say, well, what do I really believe? Up to that time I had just, I had just listened to what my teachers said and passed the exams, and did what was expected of me, but I internalized something about what, you know, is there a God, and if so, how do you solve various paradoxes associated with God?\n\nAnd I went through that kind of experience during the Freshman and Sophomore years mostly in college, before I became somewhat comfortable with my, with internalizing what I had been taught as a child. And I’m sure that if I’d come from another background, I would have turned out differently, but, and I personally believe now that God is alive in many ways, but I do believe, you know, I do believe that God is somehow, mysteriously, involved with our universe, and that underlies a lot of what I do, and I also know I will never be able to prove it, but I’m thankful that I could never prove it, because if it was proved, I think then I would lose interest in the whole subject; there would be no mystery, and no interest in it.\n\nSo I, as they say, the growing up in a religious way took place during this time, when I’m meeting my future wife.\n\nI was on lots of sports teams, the cross country team, baseball. We would have a chance to; we would have a chance to travel to lots of other places then, with the team. That was fun as well. I worked on, I was the founding editor of this magazine, The Engineering and Science Review, and then, active in various other things, for example I was vice president of my fraternity.\n\nThere was one story about the newspaper and my fraternity I might as well mention. That we, I was, I would go to downtown Cleveland, where the newspaper was being typeset, and that’s where I first got experience with Linotype machines, and the way real printing was done. And I would be the, at first I was the copy editor, so I would check for errors in the text, before they did the final print run, and I noticed that there was a story about one of our Theta Chi fraternity parties, before Christmas, and it said that we had served hot buttered rum, and, well, it dawned on me that we actually weren’t supposed to serve rum at a fraternity party, and still, it was a linotype machine, and you had to pay for every correction that you made, and you had to keep your corrections to one line, if they had to reset several lines — so I changed it to hot buttered popcorn. And that worked out okay for the — for the story.\n\nNow, so I got more experience in writing, publishing, during that period, and we had the Chair of the English department as my teacher, as freshmen, and we had very good teachers also, you know, in my Western Civilization class, sophomore, junior years, so all the time I was writing. I was writing stories for, I was, you know, writing term papers, but I was also writing for campus publications. And I came to believe that really my education boiled down to 50% mathematics, 50% English; 50%, you know, writing skills, and somehow combining those two things, for the rest of my life is what everything else was somehow a mixture of those two things.\n\nI was in so many extra-curricular activities in fact, that Case has something called the Honor Key, which is based on points. You get so many points for being in the band, so many points for being in a fraternity, not very many for that, but certainly for the newspaper and for singing in the choir, chorus, and participating in other campus things, and if you get a certain number of points then you win the Honor Key, and at, you know, at Graduation Day they’ll mention the four or five students who have won the Case Honor Key. Well, it turned out I had enough points to win the Honor Key, but after three years, and, you know, so I think I had more points, more Honor Points than anybody else had had in the history of Case, so again I was, you know, a machine, saying, “Oh? There are points for this? Okay, I’d better do this.” And I signed up for these things. So I was involved with lots of extra-curricular stuff.\n\nI also had a chance to do a little bit of writing music. I wrote a five-minute musical comedy for our fraternity to perform at the whatever they call it, the oh, I forget what it was; it was an annual thing, where each fraternity would put on some kind of a skit. Varsity Day, or something, I can’t remember what we called it. And we would go to a theatre in downtown Cleveland and perform for whoever wanted to listen in. I wrote this five-minute musical comedy called “Nebbish Land”, based on nebbishes, you know, these were popular in the Greeting Card Industry at the time. And that I still have the score for, so maybe I’ll, maybe I’ll put some of the music for that in my book on fun and games.\n\nAt Case I put a lot of time into stuff out of class, but in class, I found a really clever way to, right now, let me brag this way to say, to avoid having to study too hard, for my classes. In the first place, I noticed though, that when I was a sophomore, my grades started to go down, in the first part of my sophomore year. And I ascribed it to too much ping-pong playing and playing cards too much in the dorm, and so; no, I’m sorry; this was the second half of my freshman year. I started having a little problem with my grades, and so I had to give up ping-pong.\n\nBut starting in my sophomore — junior year, I found out that you could take graduate courses at Case, and they were easier than the undergraduate courses. The reason is that Case had really strict admissions requirements for undergrads, but they were fairly loose about admitting graduate students. I think they wanted to build up, you know, admit graduate students, so when you had graduate students, in a class, they usually didn’t know as much as the undergrads did, so if you would take a graduate course, you didn’t have as much competition, you know, and the teacher would recycle stuff, and all this. So I started taking graduate classes, and you know, and all these hotshot undergrads would be taking the other classes.\n\nAnd as a result, I had accumulated also, by the time I was a senior, I had accumulated lots and lots of graduate credits. Now, as a result then, Case did, on Graduation Day, Case did an unprecedented thing that had never been done before, they awarded me a Master’s Degree, simultaneously with my Bachelor’s Degree. And this, the faculty had gotten together and made a, and voted unanimously that this should happen, and I remember, you know, that was another thing that got into the newspapers at the time, that they were awarding a Master’s Degree at the same time as a Bachelor’s Degree. So, but the reason was that I had taken these graduate courses because they were easier. I didn’t, I don’t know if I’ve ever told anybody else this before today, but that was one of the reasons I could do so many other things.\n\nI started in physics, and I continued in physics; as I said, I liked my math teacher very much, but I was a physics major, and in sophomore year I had another very good physics professor, and started learning quantum mechanics, and had classes in astronomy, and I also had a class called, I don’t know what it was called, but it was a laboratory class.\n\nAll physics majors were required to know how to do things like welding. Now, I was always very bad at lab work, in chemistry lab, I was always the last to finish experiments, and I would break the beakers and get chemicals on my hands and burn them and things like this, and start fires, things; it was bad, but when I got into this welding, this class where I’m supposed to do welding, it was just dreadful. I mean I couldn’t see, you know, I wear rather heavy glasses, and we had to wear goggles while we were welding, but the goggles wouldn’t fit over my glasses, so I couldn’t, you know, so I couldn’t wear my glasses and my goggles at the same time.\n\nSo I’m sitting there with these goggles that I can’t see very well out of, and I’ve got this electrical thing, which is thousands and thousands of volts, where I’m supposed to be welding material, but the table is way lower than I am; I’m kind of tall, and so I, and so here I’m holding this thing way out of my range, and I’m supposed to, you know, I’m supposed to get, solder things together, or whatever you call the stuff, and when I was supposed to put, to get one thing attached to another, the teacher would, you know, would pick it up and it would fall apart, by its own weight, so I was failing in welding class. And it was terrifying too, you see, with all this electrical juice going on in there, and me not being able to...\n\nMy astronomy class, I found out that it was very frustrating. I could pass all the exams, in fact I got a 100 on every exam in my astronomy class, but secretly I hated the subject, and I decided that I would continue the classes as self-discipline, because I didn’t want the teacher to know that I hated the class. And I figured, you know, I’m not going to be, I have to learn how to do stuff that I don’t enjoy as well as stuff that I enjoy. So I studied very carefully for the exams in astronomy, but I really — and why didn’t I like it?\n\nI’m trying, I believe it’s just because I was just, I couldn’t imagine how, they were so different from mathematics, in astronomy you would never be able to go to the sun and really know what it was like there. You always had secondary information. If I would be an astronomer, I would never, I would, I would have to die before I would know anything, which was really true, because it’s all based on speculation. It’s all based on our best guesses about the way the universe is, and nothing that you can really experience yourself, or prove correct. In physics, the same way, nature is beyond our grasp, and you don’t know.\n\nBut mathematics was different. Mathematics had this certainty about it that, where you could finish a problem, and you could say, you know, I know I’ve got the answer. And so I like that. It was easy. It’s much easier; you know, I have to admire the people who, the scientists who spend their life and never know whether they’ve solved the problem or not, they just get supporting evidence for or against it, but to me, anyway, mathematics got more and more appealing, for the reason that it gave me some certainty; just the opposite of the reason why religion was appealing, because it didn’t have certainty, I mean I would feel unhappy of the life where I had nothing certain, and life where I had everything certain. In either extreme, life, it’s hard for me.\n\nI gravitated toward mathematics. And there was another reason. Our mathematics teacher was very, was a very eccentric guy, and also very hard, my second year mathematics teacher, also hard to please, and he had quite a reputation at Case, because, a couple of years earlier, he had flunked the entire class. He decided that none of them was learning anything; he gave F to everybody in the course, so Louis Green was a legend at Case.\n\nAnd I was taking his class, as a sophomore, called “Basic Mathematics”, which he had written the textbook for himself. And that was a course where you, stuff like, lot, things that are different from the continuous things that physicists study. And there must, you know, there must be something in the way I grew up that made integer numbers more appealing to me. I, I mean it’s associated with computing, as everyone knows now. Of course computers didn’t exist, or hardly existed in those days.\n\nI’ll speak more about my first view of a computer later, but the, here we are, in Louis Green’s “Basic Mathematics” class, and I’m getting to a different kind of mathematics than calculus, and one day he gave a problem to the class. He said, “Here’s a problem that I don’t think — if anybody solves this problem, I’ll give you an automatic A in the class”. And the problem, now, it turns out, well, I can state the problem, he said, if you, putting parentheses around into a mathematical formula, if you have a formula with five variables, A, B, C, D, E. How many ways can you put parentheses into that formula so that you are combining two things at a time?\n\nSo you could say, A, you could say, parenthesize AB, and then parenthesize C, and then D or E, or you could start with B and C and combine that with A, and so different ways to do this. So if you start out with n of these variables, and you put, you combine with parentheses, what, how many ways are there to do it? And this, by the way, is something very dear to the hearts of computer scientists now, because we call it the number of binary trees with n leaves. But Louis Green gave us, as a problem, as a challenge, could we determine this number? And if anybody could, he said he’d give an A to them.\n\nWell. I don’t know to this day whether he knew the answer to the problem or not, but I have found out subsequently that the answer was published in the 18th century, and, and had a long history. And so these numbers are so famous now that one of my friends, Richard Stanley at MIT, has found 128 different interpretations of these numbers, parentheses is just one of these 128 ways. And he’s collected that many ways. In fact I had the honor of discovering number 128 last year, when I was with him in Sweden, but that’s; anyway.\n\nMy sophomore year, Louis gives us this problem, and we all knew Louis’s reputation, so we figured, why work on the problem? He’ll never give out a problem that we could actually solve, why should we, you know, why should we waste time on this silly thing? But it turned out that I was on the football, I was in the band, actually, not the football team, and our band was going to play in Detroit, at the football game, on Saturday, but I missed the bus. I got up too late, so I was, so I found out the bus had just left for Detroit, and I had a whole, and I had figured I’d spend all, you know, a wasted day, all day in Detroit.\n\nSo I figured, okay, I’ll work on Louis, I’ll spend this day thinking about Louis Green’s impossible problem. And I got lucky, and figured, and found the answer to it, and so I wrote it up on two sheets of paper, and turned it in on Monday morning, and he looked it over, and on Tuesday, he said, “Okay, you get an A in this class.” So I’m still a physics major, but I took his math class, and so I cut class the rest of the quarter, and he lived up to his agreement, and I got an A on my, on the score.\n\nWell, I felt a little guilty afterwards, having cut class, so I served as his grader for his course the following year. But that, what was I going to say? So, but that summer I switched into mathematics as a major, because of my experience with the welding in physics, and because I found that mathematics was something that I would be able to actually prove, prove correctness, and that, this appealed to me. Still, I didn’t study mathematics that much, because I already had the A, and an A was what I was looking for in my college grades.\n\nHow did I get into computers? I had a scholarship to Case, but it was, it didn’t cover my whole tuition; it just covered part of the tuition, and so I took a part time job. My parents had no money, and I took a part time job working in the Statistics Department. Taking, and one of the things I would do, would run a card sorter, an IBM card sorting machine, which was kind of a fascinating thing. You put the; take these punched cards, and you put them in the thing, and it distributes into different pockets, and then you pull them out in certain orders, and afterwards look at the results, and you draw graphs. And so I was drawing graphs for the Statistics Department.\n\nI guess I should say something more about graphs, while it flashes into my mind. In high school, I had taken time, one summer, working with; I was fascinated by this idea of graphs in mathematics, where you have, you know, as a function, as variable X varies, you have Y as a function of X, then you draw the position that’s Y units above the axis, and it makes a picture. And since I like visual things, I was fascinated by the idea that I might be able to take, start with the picture that I wanted to do, and find the equation that would, when you graph the equation, you would get that picture. And so I played around with graphs. I spent one summer in high school, I had drawn hundreds and hundreds of graphs, where I would take, where I would take an equation like the square root of X? + 5, 5x, minus something else, and I would, and then I would draw the graph.\n\nAnd I had, and my dad had a little calculating machine, which was a, where I, which could calculate square roots. It actually would print it out. He was an accountant, so it would also print it out on tape, that I could run this machine and it would do the multiplying and stuff for me, and then I would have this function of, and then I would say, instead of X? + 5x, I would maybe change it to X? plus 4x, and draw that graph too, until I would learn how different graphs looked.\n\nI didn’t have calculus, I didn’t know calculus in high school, but I did know how to graph an equation, and that fascinated me, so I had played, I worked so hard on this, in fact, on this orange graph paper that I had, I started to get headaches, it was not easy on the eyes, and I think I started wearing heavier glasses at this time, because I worked on the graphs, but this had given me some experience with graphs, and liked, I liked that kind of mathematics, even when I was in high school.\n\nSo now, I got my first, I got my first part time job at Case; I’m supposed to draw graphs for the statisticians. So that’s fine, and downstairs from the sorting machine was a new computer, an electronic brain, as they called it, in those days, and it was the first, it was called the IBM Model 650. This was the, historically, the first computer that was mass-produced; there were more than 1,000 of them. Before that, computers had; no computer had been made more than a few dozen at the most.\n\nAnd this computer arrived, about midway in my Freshman year at Case, and it was sitting in a room downstairs from the Statistics laboratory, where I was working. So I could peer through the window at this computer, and with its flashing lights it looked rather exciting. And one day a guy saw me looking through the window, and he said, he invited me to come in, and he explained to me how the machine worked, and so it was quite fascinating to me that it could do things much different than this mechanical calculating machine that my dad had shown me.\n\nSo I took a look at the operating manuals for the machine, and pretty soon I, he allowed me to punch cards that would go into that machine, as what; you know, I knew how to run a sorter, but now I could actually punch a card that would make a computer program. And I, and so I began to learn something about the inside of this machine.\n\nI read the manuals that came from IBM, and it had; the manuals had example programs in there, and I thought of better ways to write those programs. I thought of, you know, well, okay, this program works, but if you did it this way, it would be even better. And so that’s given me some confidence that maybe I had a talent for programming. Now, if the manual hadn’t had these bad examples in it, I probably would not have gotten interested in programming, because I wouldn’t have this confidence, and I would have been scared and say, oh, I would never think of this.But the fact is, the manuals were pretty stupid, and that’s what gave me the confidence that I should think a little more about programming, because I might be, you know, I might be good at it.\n\nSo, you know, I started to learn a little bit about computers in my Freshman year, then when I pledge at the fraternity, one of the fraternity brothers had a problem that he needed to solve, and he was eval — finding the roots of fifth degree equations. And I had learned about a program called the Bell Interpretive System that was, that looked like it wouldn’t be too hard to solve this problem on, and so, since he was, you know, he didn’t really want to do it himself, so for my fraternity brother I wrote a, I wrote something that would, could do one of his homework problems for him, and that was, and it seemed to run correctly the first time. I find it hard to believe, now, but it, as far as I know, it did.\n\nAnd so he was happy about that, and I, you know, and I got more involved with the people at the computing center, where, when I, when they stared letting me use this IBM machine during the night. And so between my freshman and sophomore year, I was, I had a part time job at the computing center, working for them. Really, they allowed us to write software that other people, other students, would be using.\n\nThe first computer program I wrote, and it was the following; I had to find the prime factors of a number. So you would dial in on the console of the machine; there were rotary switches, and you could set the switch to some number, like 100, and then it would punch out 100 is equal to two times two, times five, times five. So we find the prime factors of the number you dial on the console switches.\n\nI still have a copy of my program for that, that I wrote, and it started out something like 60 or 70 instructions in the program originally, and two weeks later I had the program working correctly, and it had about 130 instructions in it, and I think I had removed more than 200 errors, during the time. I mean I not only learned about programming, but about making errors. So what can go wrong when you? Well, anyway, I did, I didn’t really know that much about programming, at the time, but I learned it a heck of a lot by this exercise of trying to find prime factors of a number.\n\nSo I learned certain things like, what’s; this was a decimal computer, it worked not in the binary system, but in the decimal system, and you had ten-digit numbers, so I could learn, so it was also very slow, the division instruction in the machine took four milliseconds, that’s a, I think it’s something like four nanoseconds, in other words now machines go a million times faster. But you know, incredibly slow by today’s standards, but, so you couldn’t do that many divisions per second.\n\nAnd my method of finding prime factors was just to try dividing you know, you can divide by two? No. Divide by three? No. Divide by four? No. Until you find a factor. So now you take the largest ten-digit number that doesn’t have any factors. This program would take a long, long, long time. So one of the things I had to do was make it go a little faster. I wouldn’t divide by two and three and four and five, I could skip over the even numbers if it’s not divisible by two, it’s not divisible by four.\n\nAnd, you know, I had to do things like that in order to, then I, as soon as I got up to a five digit divisor, then I could stop; I didn’t know then back then, you know, I didn’t realize that at first, but I didn’t have to divide by every possible thing, because if it has a divisor at all, the smallest divisor has to be less than the square root of the number you’re looking at, less than or equal. I think I first thought less than, and then I, then I found I had to change my program to less than or equal.\n\nOne of the most subtle bugs was, and it took me, and it took me a hard time to do it, was the following. What if the number had lots and lots of prime factors? Well it turned out there are ten-digit numbers that have, I could only punch eight prime factors on a card, on the answer card, and so I would have to prepare my program, because I mean you can have more than 30 prime factors, so I could, so I had to change my program so that it wouldn’t only punch one card as the answer, but it would also punch up to four cards.\n\nSo anyway this was, I’m just trying to explain why this little program of finding prime factors was so instructive for me at the time, and I did it near the end of my freshman year, and I was allowed to spend all night sitting at the machine, turning the dials, turning the buttons, and Case had an extremely intelligent attitude toward undergraduates. They allowed us to go and touch the computers, do everything ourselves, work overnight, sleep in the, you know, in the room, and write programs that would be used by other people on campus.\n\nAnd Stanford had a completely different idea. If you used the computer at Stanford, I learned later, they had a professional staff that had been sent to them by IBM, of scientists who would do the; you would submit the job to them, they would put it through the machine, and you know, you’d get your answers the next day.\n\nCase, all hands on, we are allowed to all that stuff ourselves, and even, they didn’t worry that we were going to break the machine, you know, we’d learned how to open up the panels, and you know, when paper jams and cards jam, and things like this, or, we could wire the boards and all that stuff. So what if we’re freshmen? That’s okay. And I think Case and Dartmouth were the only two universities that were so liberal for allowing undergraduates to play with the machines in those days.)\n\nSo I got my summer job at, in the computing center, so I didn’t come home to Milwaukee, except for a short trip that summer. And this was before I had met these girls I was telling you about, in my sophomore year. So I had only the computer to be with, and my second program was to change the numbers from decimal to other bases, but my, but that was a fairly quick.\n\nMy third program is the one that I spent the most time on at that time, was to play tic-tac-toe. Now I found out later that a lot of computer scientists have worked on tic-tac-toe, Charles Babbage, the famous guy who, you know, was planning a machine that could do tic-tac-toe in England in the 1800s, Danny Hillis built a tic-tac-toe playing machine out of Tinker toys, that went into the computer museum at Boston. But anyway, I and, I decided I’d write a computer program to play this children’s game, and it was a bit of a challenge.\n\nI wasn’t using Tinker toys, but this IBM 650 had another interesting feature; not only was it decimal, with ten-digit numbers, but it only had 2,000 altogether. So the total memory of that computer was, oh well, let me see, 2,000 times, well what have we got? Five bytes or so? So that’s ten K bytes of memory. Now, right now, if you don’t have ten gigabytes, oh well, ten megabytes, you know, you’re dead. You can’t load Microsoft Windows unless you hundreds of megabytes, but here we had 10,000 bytes, total.\n\nAnd so I, but I was wanting it to play tic-tac-toe against me. I wrote three versions of tic-tac-toe. One was an expert version, which you know, I pre-planned a strategy that I knew was going to be right. What’s the second version? I can’t remember. But the third version was the most interesting. This was the learning version, where the machine starts out knowing nothing. And it learns by experience. So it, so it remembers all the possible positions on the tic-tac-toe board, just barely enough to fit inside of ten K bytes, and every time it plays a game, if it lost a game, it said, oh, these moves that I made were bad. The moves that the other guy made were good. If it won the game, it said, oh, my moves were good; the other guy’s were not. So it would adjust; it kept; it had one digit for every position, so it would start out like at four, and if you’d win a game it might go five. If you’d lose, it’d go to three. And so then if you had different moves, you’d it would try the ones that looked good in its ranking, and that took me a month to write the program, and I learned a lot playing around with that.\n\nAnd afterwards I, then I tried the learning program against the expert program, so I would use the expert program to play and train the learning program, so how many times would the expert play against, you know, like I think it was like 120 games or something, then the learning program learned not to lose against the expert.\n\nTic-tac-toe is a kind of boring game, because if you really know how to play it, every game comes out as a cat’s game; it’s a tie. Nobody wins. But before that it’s interesting. When you make bad moves, it gets really exciting. So then I said, okay, now I’m going to have two learning. I’m going to have the learning game play against the learning game, so both of them start out knowing nothing about the game, and each of them, so originally all their moves are completely blindfolded, and you know, they’re blundering along, but then at the end somebody happens to win the game, or somebody happens to lose the game, so then their strategy changes a little bit.\n\nWell now it turned out that after about 350 games, they would learn how to play conservatively, to draw against each other. It was a very dull game that they finally wound up doing; they played safe moves instead of brilliant moves, but it was anyway, a good learning experience for me, writing this tic-tac-toe program.\n\nMy family went to a summer camp in, on the shore of Lake Erie for a week, that summer, and, Linwood, it’s called. I revisited it a couple of years ago, to remember. Anyway, it’s on the beach, two weeks we were there, and I would play tennis with my uncles and so on, but I also had brought with me the, a couple of examples of computer programs that I had heard about, and so I had some spare time while I’m at the summer place, to look at these programs. And this made a big influence on my future life, actually.\n\nOne of the programs was what they call an assembler, which was, meant that instead of writing in the machine language, you could write in a more symbolic language that would make it easier for, I mean I, when I started my programming I was just programming everything in numbers. And so, if I wanted to add, add a number in location one to the number in location two, I would have to say something like, 20, oh, oh, one, something, anyway, I would have to write all these numbers out, and punch them into cards, and get it to work, and this was all I knew, when I started programming.\n\nBut then the symbolic, the assembly program was a new-fangled thing at the time, and allowed me to do it in a way that’s more easier to understand. Instead of choosing a number for every place in my program, I could give it a name, and then the machine would figure out the, you know, what number to associate with that name. And in those days computers couldn’t deal with letters very well, the computers were more set up for numbers, but we were allowed to use capital letters, so we had, so, and in this assembler we could use five capital letters, for a word, and I remember specifically when I used this for my tic-tac-toe program, and I, and I would have to think, what five-letter word would I use to indicate a current part of the program, and I remember, you know, with delight, when I want in my tic-tac-toe program, when it wins, I would go to location BINGO. So I could use the five-letter word B, I, N, G, O, for that part of the program.\n\nOkay, so I’m learning about a symbolic assembler at this time, and so I got the code, all right? So I’m using the assembler, but I was wondering how it did it? How did you know, how, what went on, behind the scenes that would take my symbolic thing that said, BINGO, and put it into numbers that the machine would understand directly? And so I had the listing for this program called SOAP Two, by Stan Poley of IBM.\n\nThen I had also brought with me another listing, from a program called IT, or Internal Translator, and this was a new program; had come from Carnegie Tech, later Carnegie Mellon University, written by four people at Carnegie, and IT took an algebraic language, instead of a machine language. So you’re writing here; it’s a; this is early days, this was before FORTRAN or other high-level languages were known. I’m talking here of 1956, 1957. The idea here then, you can write X = A + B. Ah, well, you couldn’t really write that because we didn’t have plus signs, so we would really write, X one, Z, X two, S, X three, where S stood for plus, and Z stood for equals, and, you know, and every variable was X one, X two, X three or something like this, but anyway, you could put in algebraic formula on your card, and then the machine would figure out, from that, how to compute A + B and store it in X, or whatever you wanted it to do.\n\nSo instead of a numeric thing; instead of a symbolic version of a numeric thing, it was algebraic, and you would put your program from the IT language into the computer, and it would flash the lights for a while, and then, punch, punch, punch, punch, and give you a machine language, in the computer’s language. Magic. I couldn’t; I hadn’t a clue as to how this was possible at all, so I got a copy of the program that they had used, to write this IT, translator, and I had a copy of the SOAP program, the Symbolic Assembly, the Symbolic Optimum Assembly Program.)\n\nI brought this to the summer place, and I spent nights looking at it and psyching out how this program worked. And, wow, I found; first I figured out how this IT worked, and so, oh yeah, that’s how they can look in the algebraic formula and convert it into instructions, but then, it was terrible style. The program was kludgy. You would read it, and every time they would do something, they did it the hard way. I looked at the SOAP program, the one that came by Stan Poley, it was elegant; it was beautiful; it was like hearing a symphony. It was, whenever it did an instruction, the instruction was sort of accomplishing two things at once. Everything fit together harmoniously; it was elegant code.\n\nI said, boy, I’d love to write programs like this guy can do. And conversely, you know, this clumsy, clunky code that came from the other one, wow. You know, I can do better than that. So a couple of friends and I wrote an improvement of IT, which we called RUNCIBLE; every program had to have an acronym in those days, and RUNCIBLE was Revised Unified New Compiler IT Basic Language Extended or something. We had some reason for the word R U N C I B L E. But we, but mainly we had, we wanted to redo that algebraic language in a way that was more elegant and had more features, and so improve it in, you know, in lots of ways and still stay within our ten K bytes.\n\nAnd so that was how I spent my first summer at the Computer Center. It turned out that after RUNCIBLE was done, we also, I wrote a user’s manual, for how to write, you know, how to use this program, and curiously, this user’s manual was then used as a text book for students the next year. And so I was in the unusual position of taking a class for which I had written the textbook, when I was a sophomore, one of my classes in computing.\n\nNow, RUNCIBLE, we revised it the next summer, and made it really, lots of bells and whistles, and still with our ten K bytes, but we got a floating point attachment, and we had some other things, so it was, so my friends and I came up with better versions.\n\nSo here, this, and I also wrote a SOAP Three, I loved the SOAP Two program we had from IBM, I wrote SOAP Three, which, which improved on SOAP Two, and this was used as the assembler program for other software development that we were doing. So here are Case is allowing about a dozen of us undergrads to write software that’s being used by the other students and faculty of Case, and I, the, Fred Way, who is the director of this program, was very fore-sighted, able to trust the students, and allow, and you know, and to, and we had a, we had lots of fun talking to each other about all these issues, and we did —\n\nNew literature of journals — the Communications of the ACM started up in 1958. All of a sudden we saw that there was, there were people publishing ideas from other parts of the world, about how to write programs, and we knew that we had already discovered a lot of these things too, and we had some better science out there. So my second technical publication, after Potrzebie System for Mad Magazine, my second technical publication was about this RUNCIBLE; the method we’d used in RUNCIBLE, to do the conversion of formulas into machine code. And here I sent it to this magazine, the Communications of the ACM, which was, which we had just, began, just, had just begun to come out, and I was totally naïve, not understanding anything about scientific journals or publication conventions.\n\nI had been seeing magazines; I knew what magazines were, and so on, but no people, but there was no idea of credit for something like this. It was just the story that was important. And so, when I wrote this up, I was, I considered myself to be a spokesperson, spokesman for these guys at Case Computer Center, who had been working together to create RUNCIBLE, and I, you know, so I, so I wrote an article about the methods that are used in RUNCIBLE. Nowhere in the article did I mention the names of these other guys, who had been working on it, and I didn’t know that I was going to be getting credit for any of these ideas, I just wanted to describe the ideas, and so this was a, you know, a, I learned later more about, about the scientific conventions of publication, but I was just, you know, I was just a journalist, and I was treating the story as that. So we set the story right when the article was published as part of my collected works a couple of years ago.\n\nIn those days, computing was so different from what it is now, not only was the memory tiny, only ten K, and the speed was slow, but also we, the way we wrote programs, well maybe as a result of that, the way we wrote programs was something I would never do today, because in order to pack it into this small memory, we had to do, resort to some trickery that was almost impossible to understand, and therefore highly likely to cause errors.\n\nBut one of the things we learned as, early in trying to write software, is that the users of your software always suggest new features, and they’re never satisfied. You give them ten things, and they’ll want ten more, and so we kept adding features and features. That’s called creeping featurism now. But we had only this tiny machine, so how were we going to pack more and more features, when there’s no space for it? And the answer is, we use more and more tricks.\n\nSo in this compiler RUNCIBLE, there were four versions of the compiler. You could ask it to produce computer instructions for a machine that did, that had the so-called floating-point attachment, or maybe your computer didn’t have the floating-point attachment, so you either had floating point or not. If you didn’t have the attachment, then you would have to go through a slower routine that would simulate, and pretend that the attachment’s there. Then you could also ask it to compile directly into machine language, or you could ask it to compile into the symbolic assembler language. The symbolic assembler would be able to produce slightly better final product, but it would take longer, because after you got the symbolic, you’d have to take those cards and run them through another program before you could run them. So we had, so either floating-point or not, either symbolic or not, it was four different possibilities.\n\nSo we wrote it, we wrote the program in such a way that there was a floating-point set of instructions, and a non-floating-point set of instructions, each of these we had exactly, let’s say, 731 positions of memory for, so you’d swap out those 731 for another, and similarly for the symbolic and non symbolic, you could swap out two parts of the program; each of those parts of the program had to be the exactly the same size, in order to pack it all in.\n\nSomebody asks for a new feature, or we want to extend the language a little more, then we think of a way to do it for the floating point, but then we have to think of a way to shorten the non floating point part of our program, so we kept on revising this program until it was really inscrutable. I mean every, all kinds of tricks were used for that. When I’d have a constant that was used in one routine, I would also make sure that it could be used in some other routine, for some other, completely different purpose. Almost everything in the program had many uses, and therefore a few months would go by, and we’d forget about these tricks, and we would try to change something else, and something would go wrong.\n\nSo it was a very shaky, bad way to do software, but it was the way that, the only way we knew how to do at the time, and it was, and people couldn’t believe that we were able to do with such a small computer, to do as many things as it did.\n\nI never thought of that as a career. That was my summer job at Case, but there was no such thing as a career in computers, and computers were just this weird thing on the periphery of society. What did I really want to do, as my own career? When I was in grade school, I wanted to be a grade school teacher. I wanted to, you know, if I was in sixth grade I was thinking of myself as a future sixth grade teacher, seventh grade and so on. And in high school, I wanted to be a high school teacher. I always viewed myself as having, as being a teacher later on, and also maybe with a part time job as a musician or something. So I got to college, I wanted to be a college teacher, I got to graduate school, I thought, okay, graduate school teacher.\n\nBut I never thought of computer science as a, as part of my career, it was something that I could do in order to make money, to prepare myself for a career that I’d heard about before. It was like, so I was going to be a physics teacher, then I was going to be math teacher, when I switched to math. And I went to, okay, so, when I finally graduated from Case, I had been recommended that I should go to the West Coast, well, no, I chose the West Coast for graduate school, because my family, we would go; finally we had enough money to take vacations in the summer time, and we could drive round, and so we had driven to the different parts of the United States, and I fell in love with California, and so when I applied to graduate school, I applied to Caltech, Stanford and Berkeley. Basically, where should I go to, to do my mathematics?\n\nAnd I was accepted to all three, and I had scholarships to all three, and, but the, I was specially recommended to Caltech, because of Professor Marshall Hall, who later became my advisor, since at Case we had a visitor, Professor Bose, a great Indian mathematician, who had just, who had been, introduced me to research, and he spoke very highly of Marshall Hall.\n\nBose, at the time, was doing his famous work about disproving Euler’s conjecture about Latin Squares; it’s an interesting subject, a several hundred year old problem, where people hadn’t been able to construct patterns that are, that are useful in many parts of statistics and combinatorics and Euler and this greatest mathematician of all time, probably, or at least in everybody’s Top Ten, in the 1700s, had conjectured that there was no solution to this problem, and three or four people had even proved that he was right, but there were mistakes in the proof, and so finally, my professor, my Professor Bose and two of his co-workers found that Euler was wrong, and that there were really patterns of that kind. And so Bose got me interested in research, because I was at the Computer Center, and he had a computing problem that he couldn’t solve, and he put me to work on Latin Squares of order 12, and I came back the next morning with five mutually orthogonal Latin Squares of order 12, and this excited him very much, and that was my third technical paper, I guess, was this paper with Bose.\n\nBut he recommended Marshall Hall, who was one of the leading mathematicians in the combinatorial mathematics area, and so I liked the idea of going to Caltech.\n\nDuring the summer, between Case in Cleveland and Caltech in Pasadena, I had a summer job, of writing compilers, this algebraic, this software that converts algebraic language into machine language. I had a job writing a compiler for Burroughs Corporation. Burroughs was headquartered in Pasadena, I mean the Burroughs Division that was dealing with software was headquartered in Pasadena, and Case had recently installed a Burroughs computer that I liked very much, during my senior year.\n\nSome people from Thompson Ramo Wooldridge approached me and said, Don, we understand that you can write compilers. We’re going to put in a proposal to Burroughs to write a compiler for their machine, the Burroughs 205, for a language called ALGOL, which was just being invented at that time, the Algorithmic Language an International Standard, that was supposed to replace FORTRAN, the most popular language at the time. And so Thompson Ramo Wooldridge was, made a proposal to Burroughs for I believe it was $70,000, to create an ALGOL compiler for the Burroughs 205. The people who made this proposal really, though, were clueless about how to write compilers, so they hired me, a Case senior, to do the job, because they had heard that I knew how to do it. I had done this RUNCIBLE and a couple of versions of other software at Case, so spring of my Senior year, they are showing me, they’re showing me about this machine that Burroughs had, and I started playing around with the computer, and I had learned, got interested in the project, but Burroughs turned them down; they didn’t give them the contract.\n\nSo after Burroughs said, no, they weren’t going to do it with Thompson Ramo Wooldridge, well I said, well, wait a minute, I’ve, maybe I’ll write to Burroughs on my own, and I sent them a letter and said, I’ll, you know, for $5,000 I can write you an ALGOL compiler. Now $5,000 was a huge amount of money in 1959, 1960. I mean a college professor was making $8,000 a year or something like this. So I thought $5,000 was an incredibly rich thing, you know, to do. I said to Burroughs, no, I, except that, I can do it in the summer, except I won’t have time to implement all of this ALGOL, I’ll be able to do everything except procedures. I’ll be unable to, you know, which is actually the hardest thing to do in a compiler, which is of subroutines, the ability to extend the language.\n\nWell, they wrote back, you, we can’t have ALGOL without procedures, you’ve got to put procedures in too. And so I thought about it and said, figured out, oh yeah, okay, I see how I can do it, but you’ll have to pay me $5,500, instead of $5,000. So they said, okay. So I spent the summer of 1960, that’s after my, after graduating from Case, I spent the summer writing this compiler for ALGOL, for the Burroughs 205, and I wrote it, but really I had it only in pencil and paper, I didn’t have it ready to go, and then I would take it with me on, as I went out to Pasadena, and work on it there when I was at the Burroughs plant in Pasadena.\n\nSo on my way out West; I had a little Volkswagen, that I had gotten from my parents, and I drove 100 miles a day, and got a motel, and sat down, and wrote code, wrote software, and took 30 days to drive from Milwaukee to Pasadena, every day writing a little bit of this software. Then I got to Pasadena, and had all my code, had all my notes, and started putting it on to punched cards, and you know, debugging it and by Christmas time I had their compiler for them, and it was a machine that didn’t sell very well, so there weren’t too many places in the world, but I heard for the next ten years that people in Brazil were still using it a lot.\n\nAnd so it was a, it was an interesting experience for me, but the most important, from my point of view, was I had $5,500, which was enough to get married. And so in the summer of ‘61 Jill and I got married, and it paid for our honeymoon trip in Europe, which was our first time seeing the world.\n\nI got to Caltech as a student, a grad student in mathematics. Again I was scared stiff that I wouldn’t be able to succeed, because the students at Caltech were really, really selective they, at Caltech, the undergrads, one out of three of them was first in their high school class, and the other two out of three were very near the top. And so it was awesome, the people there, but they only admitted 200 students a year in Caltech as undergrads. Graduate students, we had 12 of us in the math program, and they were excellent as well. It wasn’t like at Case where anybody could get into the Graduate School at the time.\n\nSo I, so I knew I had my work cut out for me, and I, again I went back into a mode where I did more than I needed to for my classes, but I also liked the people at Burroughs, so I took, and so I took a consulting job at Burroughs, working with their software group, which I had great admiration for. Their software group had, for another computer, the Burroughs 220, had written one of the best pieces of software ever, an ALGOL compiler for the 220, and I got to know the people who did that, and learned a lot from them.\n\nSo I enjoyed joining their group, but I wasn’t, but according to the rules, I couldn’t have my, I couldn’t have a fellowship from the National Science Foundation or from the Woodrow Wilson Foundation; I couldn’t have those, that financial support and not be a full time student. Having, you know, it was a no-no to also be a consultant, also be working, working outside Caltech. Wow, your education couldn’t possibly be any good that way. So I renounced those fellowships, and I did become a consultant, and I would spend time over at Burroughs several days a week, and for the next six or seven, seven or eight years, all the while I was down there in Pasadena.\n\nThe people at Burroughs were splendid to work with. I was in a group called Product Planning, which designed, had designed, or was, early on was in the process of designing a completely new kind of computer, one that would do in hardware what, what we had been doing in software before. That kind of computer is, is not in, it’s been realized later that it doesn’t really provide a real good cost benefit trade off, it’s better to build cheap hardware and good, and then make software than to build expensive hardware, but at that time it was you know, it was not at all clear what the future would say about that issue. And so we had the most complicated machine ever built, the Burroughs 5000, then the 5500, 6500, that came out later.\n\nAnd the Product Planning group where I was consulting was the group in charge of specifying the machine. Another group, the Engineers, had to build the machine. It was completely different than any machine done before. And my role as a consultant was to talk to the engineers who were building it and make sure they understood what the designers on the other floor knew.\n\nAnd so I got, really, to talk to almost everybody in the company, and my role was more of a communications role than anything else. These people, if they went through channels, they would have to go several levels up the hierarchy, and down again, and they couldn’t talk to each other, but they could talk to me, and then I could talk to the other people in the other group, and so I, and so I could provide a valuable service to Burroughs, and they, they would pay me, I think, you know, I think I was getting $5 an hour, or $7 an hour; considered high at the time, but it had no medical benefits or anything associated with it, so from their point of view they were getting a good deal too.\n\nAnd one of my roles was to check out the designs of the engineers, and see if there were any mistakes in them before they would build the machine. They would first take their designs and put them through a computer program to see if they would simulate, and apparently work correctly, but then, after they thought it was working correctly, then they would show it to me, and I still found several hundred errors in the design that I was able to catch, well you know, very weird cases that could come up, but hadn’t arisen during the simulations, so that the expensive corrections to the hardware weren’t necessary.\n\nYou know, really my role in that time, well, communication and trying to find errors, you know, if I could look at somebody else’s program, or design, and couldn’t find any mistakes in it, it was a rare event, and I would feel bad. I mean finding errors was my, was a big treat for me in those days, so far as my work in computers was concerned.\n\nBurroughs was a company established in the 19th century, and was quite pre-eminent in the banking industry, almost everybody used equipment from Burroughs to do its accounting, and in the early days of computing, Burroughs acquired the Electric Data Corporation, in Pasadena, and they were one of the many companies putting out computers. And, and as I say, not only that, they had very innovative computers, and I liked the spirit of all the employees working there as well.\n\nThe — later on, they were acquired by Sperry Rand, this was in the ’70s, I think, and became Unisys, combined with Sperry Rand. So half of Unisys was from the Burroughs Corporation, and half of it was the Sperry, which, the Rand, the Remington Rand, the people who had built the UNIVAC computer. That happened after I was no longer in Pasadena. And they continued to have banks as their primary customer base, but then, in more recent years, the, you know, other companies survived, and there were many, many changes in the computer industry, to that time.\n\nSo Burroughs was, you know, Edsger Dijkstra was also a consultant to Burroughs during the 60s, and he would come out to Pasadena, visit periodically, and it was a great company to work for in those days, I think.\n\nI had no idea that that work connected with mathematics in any way whatsoever. I wear one cap in the computer — when I’m consulting for Burroughs, and I wear another cap when I’m at Caltech as a student learning mathematics. Mathematics was something where we proved things correct; we knew what we were, you know, we knew what the rules of the game were. In the computer field, we just fiddled with something until it seemed to work and we couldn’t find any errors any more. But we never had this idea that it could be mathematically correct.\n\nThe only small exception to that was the area of syntax of programming languages. This means the grammar of languages. I mentioned that when I was in Seventh Grade my friends and I loved grammar, and we learned about English grammar. Well, now I was seeing the same kind of things, they were not nouns and verbs, but similar things in the algebraic languages like ALGOL, that I was supposed to write software for, and a theory had been developing called the theory of context-free languages, that was appealing to me, because here was something that I could be, I could use my mathematical cap and my and my computer cap at sort of the same time. You know, my computer science intuition, and my love of grammar and language was; would suggested interesting problems, the mathematics that I knew suggested how to solve those problems. So I, that was one thing where the two worlds, the computing and the math world, were coming together for me.\n\nAnd I have to say that on my honeymoon, when Jill and I sailed to Europe, I brought along with me a book by Noam Chomsky, which was one of the pioneering things about context-free languages, and I read that in odd moments, you know, when Jill was seasick or something, and I would try to solve the problem about context-free languages. The problem I tried to solve was, is there a way to test whether a context-free grammar is ambiguous or not? Ambiguous means that you could write a sentence that had two different ways to be understood. And I thought I might have a way to resolve this, and I reduced it to several other problems\n\nBut I couldn’t solve the problem, in general, and little beknown, you know, I learned several years later that in fact three Israeli mathematicians had already proved that the problem had no solution; that there was no way to solve this ambiguity problem, in finite time. But I didn’t know that during my honeymoon, and I just wanted to mention that, although I do love Jill, there were also other things that I love too, and one of them was the mystery of context-free languages. Another time I guess I should, I have to mention is the time when I forgot about one of our dates, and, when I was playing with the computer at Case Tech, but we won’t talk about that. But she doesn’t let me live that one down.\n\nHere I am then, earning money as a computer person, and enjoying, and then studying mathematics so that I can be a math teacher as a career. And the idea that there could be any connection with this, or there could be, ever be an academic field of computer science or something, never entered my mind whatsoever as a possibility. Very few people in the world had thought of it at that time either.\n\nNow, at Caltech, I — somebody had told me early on in life that you go to grade school for eight years, and you go to high school for four years, then you go to college for four years, and then you might want to go to graduate school for another three years, and get your, and get a PhD. I don’t know who had told me that early on, but somebody had said that it takes three years to get a Ph.D.. And I had believed that and so when I got to Caltech in 1960, I’m thinking, oh, okay, in 1963 I’ll graduate. And I’ve just sort of set my sights that way. Now if somebody had told me it was going to take five years, I’m sure I would have graduated in 1965, but I had always been thinking I would graduate in 63, so I, so I just sort of planned ahead.\n\nIt was, it didn’t occur to me, until the day of graduation, that none of my other colleagues were there. You know, Al Hales was there, but just two of our 12 had done it in three years, and I think it was partly that, just that we had set ourselves up that way, to do it.\n\nMy thesis, I was working with Marshall Hall, who I hadn’t met before coming to Caltech, but I got to enjoy. His lectures were very disorganized, but he really knew the subject, so he would be teaching us about permutations, what actually I found was that I would take notes of what he said during class, and the problem was to figure out a permutation of what he had said that made sense. What, how to re-order; you know, I mean every important idea had been presented some time during that hour, but they didn’t come to him in the right order, just like now, I’m not thinking of everything in the right order, well he, you k"
