        "text": "DESCRIPTION\n\nmixal is an implementation of the hypothetical MIX computer and its assembly language called MIXAL. The computer was designed by Donald Knuth for use in his monumental and yet to be finished book series The Art of Computer Programming. All programs and all programming exercises in the book are written in the MIXAL language.\n\nThis implementation is a load-and-go assembler, meaning that you provide it with a MIXAL program source, which it translates into MIX machine code, which it promptly executes by acting as a MIX emulator.\n\nYou give mixal zero or more MIXAL program source files in the command line, which the program interprets. If you give it no arguments, it expects to find a program in the standard input stream. After the program has executed, the final state of the machine registers is printed to the standard output stream.\n\nThe card punch and line printer devices are connected to the standard input and output stream, respectively. Console input and output are connected to standard input and output, and the disk devices are connected to files named diskN in the current directory, where N is the device number. Those files are created on demand.\n\nThere is one significant difference between the MIXAL input language and MIX as originally described by Knuth: Knuth puts fields at fixed offsets on a line, while this implementation expects them to be separated by whitespace. (Purists may wish to fix this obvious bug.) Since the ALF directive, which defines constant strings, becomes ambiguous when delimited by whitespace, there's a new syntax to achieve the same effect. Instead of\n\nALF rime\n\nuse\n\nCON \" rime\""
