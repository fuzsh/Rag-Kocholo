The first volume debuted in 1968, and the collected volumes (sold as a boxed set for about $US250, or $350) were included by American Scientist in 2013 on its list of books that shaped the last century of science – alongside a special edition of The Autobiography of Charles Darwin, Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff, Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and monographs by Albert Einstein, John von Neumann and Richard Feynman.\n\nLoading..."
