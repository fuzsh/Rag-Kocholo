        "text": "Analysis of Algorithms (AofA) is a field at the boundary of computer science and mathematics. The goal is to obtain a precise understanding of the asymptotic, average-case characteristics of algorithms and data structures. A unifying theme is the use of probabilistic, combinatorial, and analytic methods. The objects to be studied include random branching processes, graphs, permutations, trees, and strings.\n\nThe area of Analysis of Algorithms is frequently traced to 27 July 1963, when Donald E. Knuth wrote \"Notes on Open Addressing\". His fundamental books, The Art of Computer Programming, established ties between areas on study that include discrete mathematics, combinatorics, probability theory, analytic number theory, asymptotic analysis, and complexity theory.\n\nThirty years after Knuth's pioneering paper, the first seminar entirely devoted to the Analysis of Algorihtms was held at Dagstuhl, Germany, in 1993. Since 1993, several series of seminars related to analysis of algorithms have been established. These take place on an annual or biennial schedule; see the Meetings page for links to some of these meetings.\n\nThis website is dedicated to promoting the Analysis of Algorithms. All visitors are welcome. The bulletin board and webpages below are intended to be a forum of resources to assist both new and experienced scholars in their research and applications.\n\nSteering Committee:\n\nFrédérique Bassino\n\nJim Fill\n\nClemens Heuberger\n\nCecilia Holmgren\n\nBruno Salvy, Chair\n\nMark Daniel Ward\n\nClick here for Proposed Bylaws\n\nMeetings\n\nThe meetings page gives a listing of upcoming and recent meetings related to the Analysis of Algorithms. Whenever possible, links are provided to the homepages for the meetings.\n\nUpcoming Meetings\n\nSite link, speakers, registration, submission deadlines, etc. will be posted as they become available.\n\nResources\n\nThe Books, Journals, and Links page is a starting point for launching into the study of the Analysis of Algorithms. In particular, there are descriptions of several fundamental books related to AofA. The conference proceedings from several meetings are also listed, including citations and links. There is also a list of websites that are relevant to the Analysis of Algorithms.\n\nFeedback?\n\nAny additions, corrections, or other suggestions would be appreciated.
