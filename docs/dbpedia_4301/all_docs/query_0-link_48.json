        "text": "Wilson’s most eclectic album to date is ‘cinema for the ears’\n\n*****\n\nSteven Wilson has often said he would like to write a film score. He even wrote a screenplay with the film maker Mike Bennion, and they tried for a while to get the film made. When it became clear this probably wouldn’t happen, Wilson turned the project into Deadwing, the eighth studio album he wrote for his band Porcupine Tree. In September 2020, Wilson announced that he had rewritten the script with Bennion, and released a short film as a teaser to promote the project which was now called And No Birds Sing. The project doesn’t appear to have got any further at the time of writing, but it appears that Wilson’s passion for movies remains undiminished.\n\nWilson’s new album, The Harmony Codex his seventh solo studio album, follows the unexpected release of Closure/Continuation with Porcupine Tree last year, and his previous solo album The Future Bites in 2021. The new album is an eclectic soundtrack to Wilson’s rich imagination, and his love of cinema is shown by his ambition to create an album which he has described as ‘cinema for the ears.’\n\nWilson’s cinematic ambition manifests itself in various ways on the album. Like the European surrealist and art films that it he so admires, it has a loose structure, a series of sometime apparently unconnected scenes which are linked by a strong vision; the songwriter and musician as auteur. Like many films, the album is based on a short story, in this case The Harmony Codex written by Wilson and published in his 2022 book Limited Edition of One. Like many film makers, Wilson takes liberties with the story and doesn’t attempt to create a linear narrative that matches the events of his story, which does generally have a clear narrative and a sense of logic and realism even when it veers into science fiction and dream logic.\n\nWithin individual songs on the album, there is often a cinematic structure, as has often been the case in Wilson’s songwriting both as a solo artist and for Porcupine Tree. Wilson is perfectly capable of writing a rock or pop ballad with a conventional song structure, and even released a Christmas song in a conventional style, December Skies, much to the surprise of many (not least Wilson himself, who collaborated with an Artificially Intelligent lyricist to write the song). But many of his songs are much longer than the standard three to five minutes, have several different but connected sections and feel like short films or stories in themselves.\n\nThe other cinematic aspect of the album is the sound itself. Wilson has been working with surround sound, which was originally developed for the cinema, for many years. He began mixing Porcupine Tree albums and his own solo albums in 5.1 surround sound, receiving several Grammy Award nominations in the process. He has since remixed the work of several artists, including not only bands who share his prog credentials like King Crimson, Gentle Giant, Jethro Tull and Yes but also Black Sabbath and Tears for Fears. He has more recently adopted another surround sound format originally developed for the cinema, Dolby Atmos which adds additional height speakers to create a fully immersive soundscape. Although multiple speakers are needed to recreate the full effect at home, the technology is now available in Dolby Atmos-enabled Soundbars for TV, and some streaming services allow Atmos mixes to be experienced on headphones. Wilson moved to London a few years ago and built a new home studio equipped with the latest Dolby Atmos technology. The first album he mixed in this studio was The Future Bites.\n\nSteven Wilson’s home studio\n\nWilson launched the new album in a series of surround sound playbacks using spatial audio mixes in Dolby Atmos or using the L-Acoustics multiple loudspeaker system. As well as smaller listening rooms, Wilson used an actual cinema in central London and a medium-sized theatre in the EartH arts centre in Hackney, London, creating ‘cinema for the ears’ in a large, dark room. For many in the audience it was an unexpectedly profound experience, and Wilson has said he would like to recreate that experience in a live context with a band, in intimate venues with surround sound. He has said that he hopes that The Harmony Codex will become the demonstration recording to show how effective spatial audio can be for music, just as The Dark Side of the Moon was for stereo systems. But he didn’t write the album to be heard only in spatial audio – it was only in the mixing process that he considered the spatial aspects of the mix, and he was careful to ensure it worked well in stereo too. As Polly Glass said in her review in the November 2023 issue of Prog magazine, ‘we’ve listened to it at a spatial playback, through a basic Bluetooth speaker and headphones – it sounded great on all three.’\n\nThe short story provides a loose concept that influences some of the songs, but this isn’t a concept album in the way that some of Wilson’s previous solo albums are. For instance, Hand. Cannot. Erase. (2015) has an immensely complex back story about the disappearance of a young woman, and the 2013 album The Raven That Refused to Sing (And Other Stories) is based on a collection of ghost stories.\n\nThe Harmony Codex story describes a visit made by Harmony (a 12-year-old girl) and her brother Jamie (16) to visit their father in the tower block where he works in Whitechapel, East London. They ascend the skyscraper to the 38th floor, but before they can meet their father there’s an explosion. They try to escape the building via the staircase and the story passes from being a hyper-realistic description of their journey on the Tube and up in the lift, followed by a description of the moment of the explosion that reads like a film script, to a science fiction story in which Harmony and Jamie get trapped on an apparently endless staircase. The story ends ambiguously – it’s unclear whose point of view we are seeing the story from, and whether any of it has been real,\n\n‘Did he have a dream about his sister, Harmony? Or is Harmony dreaming him now?’\n\nWilson grew up reading science fiction that is more about inner space, an examination of the human psyche rather than outer space, the shape of things to come. His story is inspired by a short story written by the American science fiction writer Thomas M. Disch called Descending, published in 1968 in the collection Fun With Your New Head. The story begins with a realistic description of the un-named protagonist entering a department store, using his credit card to buy things he can’t afford. He takes the escalator down from the top floor to leave the building and at this point the story morphs into a dystopian science fiction satire like an episode of Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror. The protagonist becomes trapped on a never-ending series of descending escalators, which becomes a metaphor for the futility of life and pointless consumerism. There’s an interesting parallel with the video for Wilson’s song Personal Shopper, also a satire on consumerism, in which the protagonist is seen climbing an escalator in a shopping mall as Wilson himself descends an escalator on the other side.\n\nThe idea of an infinite staircase as a metaphor has fascinated Wilson for a long time. His second studio album for Porcupine Tree was titled Up the Downstair (1993) and it was originally going to include the single Voyage 34 (1992) which describes the 34th LSD trip of the protagonist, Brian. Spoken words on Voyage 34, sampled from an American documentary LP called LSD describe how Brian had pleasurable LSD trips until the 34th when he had a complete mental breakdown,\n\n‘On Voyage 34 he finally met himself coming down an up-staircase and the effect was devastating.’\n\nThe staircase here is a literal description of what poor Brian experienced on his trip, but also becomes a metaphor for his complete existential confusion; his psyche is trapped in an infinite staircase, like the figures in the Dutch artist M. C. Escher’s print Ascending and Descending (1960). Wilson called the collection of unused tracks from Up the Downstair by another staircase-related name, Staircase Infinities (1994).\n\nM. C. Escher’s print Ascending and Descending\n\nIn his short story, Wilson describes his protagonist trapped on an M. C. Escher staircase. On his new album, Wilson uses the staircase metaphor in a slightly different way, to describe the journey of life. This is another of Wilson’s recurring themes, dating back specifically to the Porcupine Tree song Arriving Somewhere But Not Here from Deadwing (2005). And the theme of pursuing a meaningful existence dates back even earlier to the albums Stupid Dream (1999) and Signify (1996).\n\nThe image of a staircase features in the album’s artwork, along with the skyscraper from the story. The German designer, illustrator, and photographer Hajo Müller has created a clever design to illustrate the infinite staircase, a bit like a 2-dimensional Rubik’s Cube, which is made up of ten bricks to represent the ten tracks of the album. A small version of the object features in the videos used to promote the album, and Wilson used a much larger version during his live show at EartH which concluded the surround sound playback of the new album.\n\nSteven Wilson performing at EartH on 27 September 2023. Author’s photo.\n\nThe brief live show was the first time for decades that Wilson had come on stage without wearing a guitar around his neck, although he was joined by guitarist Niko Tsonev. Wilson has often played live keyboards both with Porcupine Tree and on his solo tours, but his main live instrument has always been guitar. His decision to play exclusively keyboards was influenced by the electronic nature of much of the new album. Wilson has always loved electronica and ambient music, and his side project Bass Communion uses those styles, but it was his purchase of various classic analogue synthesisers before he wrote his previous album that led him to change his writing style. Most of the songs on the new album were written on synths rather than on the more conventional guitar or piano.\n\nThe Harmony Codex does include guitar parts, but many of them are played by collaborators such as Niko Tsonev and David Kollar. In fact, the album is remarkable for the number of additional musicians, contrasting with the most recent Porcupine Tree album on which almost all the instruments were played by the three band members. But rather than going into the studio to record with his collaborators, as Wilson had done particularly on The Raven That Refused to Sing, the new album was recorded in a similar way to Wilson’s first solo album Insurgentes, where in effect a bespoke band was formed for each individual track. The album was recorded during lockdown in Wilson’s home studio, so he could call upon a much wider range of collaborators than usual via file-sharing.\n\nThere are around twenty additional musicians on the record, including regular contributors such as Adam Holzman on keyboards, Ninet Tayeb on vocals, Craig Blundell on drums, Nick Beggs on bass and Theo Travis on woodwind. New faces include Nate Navarro and Guy Pratt (from Pink Floyd’s live band and Nick Mason’s Saucerful of Secrets) on bass, Nate Wood and Sam Fogarino (Interpol) on drums, Ben Coleman (ex no-man) on violin and Wilson’s wife Rotem on spoken word inserts. One of the reasons the album sounds more eclectic than his previous solo albums, particularly The Future Bites on which Wilson played almost all the instruments himself, is the wide range of collaborators used.\n\n1 Inclination\n\nThe opening track was written during the recording sessions for Wilson’s previous solo album The Future Bites. Wilson had originally intended to include the song on the bonus tracks for that album but decided it was too good. It opens with the sound of a trumpet, played by the Norwegian trumpeter and composer Nils Petter Molvær. An intriguing beginning to the record, it has some of the ornamental majesty of the first few bars of JS Bach’s famous organ piece Toccata and Fugue in D minor, drenched in echo as if being played in a large church like the Bach piece.\n\nBubbling synths lead to a heavily martial electronic rhythm track played by Pat Mastelotto of King Crimson, similar to the aggressive percussion pattern in Portishead’s Machine Gun from Third (2008). Ominous, rising keyboard washes are joined by feral, sampled breathing and a spidery trumpet solo that sounds more like a guitar. Shortly, the trumpet tone softens and sounds like Mark Isham who played trumpet and flugelhorn on albums by art rocker David Sylvian like Secrets of the Beehive (1987).\n\nThe track grinds to a halt at three minutes in and fades out with evocative soundscaping and it appears it has come to an end. Then, in a coup de théâtre that was particularly effective in the surround sound playback in the dark at EartH arts centre in London to launch the album, Wilson’s solo voice appears, sweet, almost tender but with an ominous undercurrent. He draws us in immediately, inviting us to, ‘Come see the fool.’ At first, it seems that the fool could be a figure who commands respect, a wise Fool like the court jester in Shakespeare’s tragedy, King Lear (1606); a Holy Fool with the gift of prophecy or deep religious insight; or the Tarot card that represents hope for the future. But in the next line it becomes clear that the fool is a swindler like the protagonist in Eminent Sleaze from the previous album, ‘He’ll swindle you out of the game.’\n\nThe protagonist is extremely combative, like the main character in the Radiohead song You And Whose Army from Amnesiac (2001); even the language is similar – compare ‘One at a time I will take you all on’ from Inclination with ‘Come on if you think/You can take us on’ from You And Whose Army. Wilson seems to be writing about a fictitious character, whereas Thom Yorke’s lyrics for the Radiohead song are much more political. In the June 2001 issue of Mojo, Yorke told Nick Kent the song was addressed to Tony Blair who was then Prime Minister.\n\nThe title of the track recalls the adage, ‘If you’ve got the time, I’ve got the inclination‘, which apparently refers to a joke in which the Leaning Tower of Pisa is addressing a clock in Westminster, London – possibly Big Ben, although the exact origin is obscure. In the context of the song, a jocular comment which possibly contains innuendo is turned into an aggressive threat.\n\n2 What Life Brings\n\nThis song is about the journey of life, and embracing whatever life throws at you. It’s unusually positive for Wilson, whose work often embraces the darker and more depressing side of life. It ends with the positive sentiment, ‘Love it all and hold it in your hands.’ There may be an autobiographical element to the song, in that his life journey has taken an unexpected – and happy – turn in recent years. In January 2017, in a rather poignant interview with Jarrett Bellini on YouTube, Wilson announced that, ‘I’ve sacrificed family for music.’ In September 2019 he got married, announcing on Instagram that it was the, ‘Happiest day of my life marrying the love of my life!’ He immediately gained a family, with two stepdaughters, and he seems to have embraced family life with all the enthusiasm he has always given to his musical projects.\n\nThe opening bars of the song, with languid drums and gently strummed acoustic guitars have a similarly dreamy, slightly melancholy feel to the opening of the soundtrack to Sofia Coppola’s film The Virgin Suicides (2000) written by the French band Air. On his website, Wilson described his song as ‘steeped in sun-dazed autumnal acoustics’, and this could also describe the Air soundtrack and the atmosphere of the film itself. In an interview with Jonathan Horsley of Decibel magazine in May 2012, Wilson expressed his admiration for the film’s soundtrack.\n\nThe beautiful, delicate imagery of the ‘oscillating sunset’ fading in a previous autumn evokes the nostalgic feel of many of Wilson’s solo works. There’s another important image in the lyrics, which links to The Harmony Codex short story. The word ‘haze’ is used to describe the ‘haze of smoke and dust’ caused by the explosion in the story. The ‘dream fog’ of the song relates to the fog of smoke in the story. The protagonist of the song is lost in the fog, just as Harmony and her brother Jamie are in the story, and Harmony is addressed in the fourth song, Impossible Tightrope. The ‘black freighter’ in the next song Economies of Scale is also lost in fog. The ‘dream fog’ of What Life Brings also relates to the ‘lucid dream’ experienced by Jamie’s character in the short story, and the final image of Harmony and Jamie wondering if they are dreaming about each other in the story.\n\nOn his website, Wilson described the song as a ‘perfect entry point’ to the world of the album, but on Twitter he said that at first he was reluctant to put it on the record as it sounds like something he had written in the past on an acoustic guitar in the old-fashioned way, finding the right chords and then writing a melody to go with them. He had similar misgivings about 12 Things I Forgot on his previous album, as he felt it didn’t match the more electronic style of the other songs. But the truth is that both songs are simply too good to have been left off the records, as they demonstrate Wilson’s ability to write wistful, gorgeously melodic pop songs.\n\n3 Economies of Scale\n\nEconomies of Scale was the first track to be released as a single, in late August 2023, a month before the album’s release. Wilson introduced the track on Twitter, saying it was ‘an obvious choice to be the first taster for the album.’ That may be the case from a musical point of view, as the track is heavily electronic like much of the rest of the album, but lyrically the track is a challenge to listeners, beginning with the words ‘Black freighter regale’ which are rather obscure. The ‘black freighter’ appears to be a pirate ship, as referenced in the song Pirate Jenny from Kurt Weill’s Threepenny Opera, ‘a black freighter/\n\nWith a skull on its masthead.’ The song has been covered by, amongst others, Nina Simone, Lotta Lenya, Judy Collins, Marianne Faithfull and Marc Almond. The imagery fits with the nautical themes of many of the songs on the most recent Porcupine Tree album, Closure/Continuation.\n\nMusically, the track continues the electronic style of Wilson’s previous solo album, The Future Bites. On Twitter, Wilson explained that the track began as a ‘weird modular synth loop’ provided by his regular keyboard player Adam Holzman. The loop can be heard at the start of the song, with added percussion which Wilson described as a ‘semi-electronic trap-beat.’ The arrangement of the song is very sparse, featuring Wilson on all instruments except Holzman’s loop. Wilson told Graham Fuller of the arts desk in December 2023 that he tried to add more instrumental parts too it, but each time he did so he felt he was making the song worse, ‘the less I added to it, the more emotional it felt.’ Wilson’s soulful vocals and rich backing vocals contrast with the skittering electronic backing track. There’s also a nod to the staircase concept, with a rising piano motif that suggests climbing stairs.\n\n4 Impossible Tightrope\n\nIn his book Limited Edition of One, Wilson entitled chapter 21, ‘The Impossible Tightrope’ to describe trying to please both himself and his fans, concluding that he must satisfy his own musical integrity first and hope that his fans will follow him. Later in the book he uses the same metaphor to describe working with his other band members in Porcupine Tree, and his desire not to, ‘jump permanently back on the tightrope’ of having to keep everyone in the band happy while maintaining his own artistic vision.\n\nThis instrumental track is one of three on the album which are around ten minutes long, the others being the title track (also an instrumental, with some spoken word inserts) and Staircase (track ten). The ten tracks on the album are over an hour long in total. This contrasts with the previous album, The Future Bites, a tight electronic pop record only about 40 minutes long with only one ten- minute song, Personal Shopper. Wilson has said that each of his solo albums is a reaction to the previous ones, and this album to an extent marks a return to long-form progressive rock songs, although Wilson himself has always resisted the term as it doesn’t really reflect the breadth of his vision; instead it reflects the depth of his ambition in that he is always trying to progress.\n\nOn Twitter, Wilson described the track as a mix of ‘progressive rock, spiritual jazz and electronica.’ It opens with sweet, cinematic violins played by Ben Coleman, who was the third member of art-rock band no-man before the group became a duo consisting of Wilson and Tim Bowness, most recently releasing Love You to Bits in 2019. Fiercely syncopated drums are joined by a vigorous guitar and bass riff which crescendo into explosive guitar chords. The bass line, played by Wilson himself from around 2.00 is based a single repeated low C, creating a driving, pulsating energy rather than the virtuosic, melodic part that a player like Nick Beggs might have created. The track breaks down and the explosive guitar chords are recreated by a jazzy acoustic guitar, beautifully played and recorded. The jazzy theme is continued by Theo Travis’ virtuosic and frenetic saxophone stylings, recalling his work on Wilson’s second solo album Grace for Drowning (2011).\n\nAbout half-way through the song, there’s an ambient section featuring Wilson’s solo falsetto voice manipulated via software to create a melody, rather than Wilson singing the melody himself. This a technique often used in urban music – a single sung or spoken note can be processed via Auto-Tune or similar software to create a range of pitches. In August 2023, Wilson told Stephen Humphries of Under the Radar that he was probably influenced by a much earlier song, Godley & Creme’s I Pity Inanimate Objects from their 1979 album Freeze Frame. Kevin Godley, ‘sang the whole lyric in a monotone… and then programmed the Eventide Harmonizer to pitch shift up or down.’\n\nA full choir – presumably from a sample library as no credit is given to a real choir in the sleeve notes – joins, giving the track a cinematic feel. It reaches an instrumental climax with a repeat of the unison bass and guitar riff heard earlier, followed by a spacey section which is shortly graced by virtuosic, jazzy soloing by Adam Holzman on electric piano, and some whimsical almost scat singing reminiscent of Wilson’s performance on Harridan, the first track on Porcupine Tree’s Closure/Continuation. The song ends with an invigorating analogue synth solo, creating counterpoint against a running bass line, before it finally dissolves into a reprise of the opening string section. An intriguing end to an epic song that is cinematic in its musical sweep.\n\n5 Rock Bottom\n\nThis song is a power ballad, written by Wilson’s regular vocal collaborator the Israeli singer Ninet Tayeb, who also sings backing vocals on the first two tracks on the album. Tayeb’s soulful, earthy mezzo-soprano voice has graced some of the most emotional songs on Wilson’s solo albums such as Routine from Hand. Cannot. Erase. (2015) and Pariah from To The Bone (2017). Wilson told Mark Millar of the XS Noize Podcast, ‘there’s something magical about the way we work together.’ He said Tayeb had written the track as an indie guitar song, but that – in keeping with the cinematic theme of the album – he asked her permission to turn the song into something with, ‘a big John Barry [James] Bond theme type of sound.’\n\nDespite the rich arrangement and soaring guitar solo from Niko Tsonev, the sentiment is very simple, similar to that of Pariah where the female voice tries to console the male voice. It’s Tayeb’s singing that gives the elemental lyrics their emotional depth and resonance. The addressee is urged to ‘break apart’, having reached rock bottom, and to embrace the hope of new life that will result.\n\n6 Beautiful Scarecrow\n\nBeautiful scarecrow is the second track on the album to feature a controlling, aggressive protagonist, the first being Inclination (track one). Here the protagonist is a charlatan, a fraudster or ‘racketeer.’ The title of the track is an oxymoron, or contradiction in terms – scarecrows are known for wearing tatty old clothes as they hang around in fields frightening birds. They are not known for their beauty.\n\nSuperficially, the protagonist may have a certain charm, but beneath the façade he is ‘deep in debt.’ It’s a strange image compared with the other more positive images of life’s journey elsewhere on the album. Perhaps there’s a warning here; this is how life could end up if you take the wrong path.\n\nThe song begins with an image of the protagonist pulling off the legs and wings of the person addressing him. The image of the human being as an insect may have been inspired by the character of Gregor Samsa in The Metamorphosis, the 1915 novella by the Czech absurdist writer Franz Kafka. When he was a teenager, Wilson and his friend Malcolm Stocks used to go to London together to buy novels by the likes of Kafka and the German-Swiss writer Hermann Hesse. Another literary image that may be appropriate is the lines from Shakespeare’s King Lear (1606), expressing the power that the gods exert over helpless humans,\n\nAs flies to wanton boys are we to the gods; They kill us for their sport.\n\nWherever the image originates, it suggests that the protagonist addressed in the song is in complete control, pulling the strings. At the end of the song, the protagonist and the person addressing him become one, ‘No longer slaves/We’re just the lonely souls that take their place.’ The subtle grace with which Wilson sings the vocals suggests a degree of empathy with the protagonist, whatever he has done.\n\nThe video for the song, directed by frequent Wilson collaborator Jess Cope of Owl House Studios in Harrogate takes the story in a different direction, indirectly inspired by the song. Co-directed by Venkatram Viswanathan, it’s a gothic horror story set in a post-pandemic world in which humanity is divided.\n\nThe track features the evocate sound of the duduk, a wind instrument which has a large double reed, originally from Armenia. The double reed is much larger than that of an oboe or bassoon, and the instrument itself looks like a recorder, with finger holes along one side but sealed at the bottom end. Here it is played by Theo Travis, a frequent collaborator with Wilson. The instrument can be heard clearly at around 2.00 minutes into the track.\n\n7 The Harmony Codex\n\nThe title track is one the most unusual tracks Wilson has recorded under his own name, as opposed to his ambient experiments under the name Bass Communion, or the material he collected for his compilation Unreleased Electronic Music (2004). To create a title track that is largely ambient, consisting of a long series of repeated, arpeggiated synth chords, is a brave move.\n\nIt would have been much easier to write a set of lyrics which are a summary of the short story Wilson wrote that provides the title for the track and build the music around that. Instead, with the confidence that comes from over 30 years of songwriting, Wilson decided to write a purely electronic track based on synth loops, reflecting his love for this style of music which he has largely ignored in his songwriting on his solo albums and for Porcupine Tree. He has often recounted the story of his mother getting Donna Summer’s album Love to Love You Baby (1975) for Christmas, and how he grew up loving the hypnotic disco sounds which she, Giorgio Moroder and producer Pete Bellotte created for the masterpiece that is the title track of that album. Wilson told FaceCulture in October 2023, ‘I love simplicity in music. I love atmosphere. I love texture in music.’\n\nAs befits the simplicity of the song, Wilson said on Twitter (X) that it was the ‘easiest and quickest to write’ as there is ‘very little to it.’ He kept adding to the song, but any extra layers detracted from the song that he had written in about 24 hours rather than the ‘months’ it often takes him to craft a song. On YouTube he showed how he built the foundations of the track with various vintage synths – an ARP 2600 to create bleeping noises and white noise, and arpeggiators on a Prophet-6 and a Moog, adjusting the filters on both keyboards in real time to vary the texture of the sound.\n\nThe result is spellbinding. The words of the German poet Stefan George, ‘I feel air from another planet’ (quoted by the Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg in his Second String Quartet) come to mind. During the surround sound playback at EartH arts centre in Hackney to launch the album, the trance-like nature of the track was deeply enhanced by the immersive sound; it truly felt as if the music was being beamed from a distant planet or from a dying star, creating a feeling of deep nostalgia for lost worlds but also a profound sense of joy.\n\nThe track does however give a tantalising glimpse of the Harmony Codex short story. Wilson chooses the most ambiguous part of the story, the final few paragraphs on the last page (p. 359 in the hardback edition). He takes the thoughts of Harmony’s brother Jamie, seen from a third person point of view in the story, and puts them instead into the first person, spoken on the track by his wife Rotem. He places the protagonist in the song ‘miles above the Earth’, gazing out not just over London where the story is set, but beyond to see the lights from ‘a thousand cities’, the ships and seas beyond them, and ‘a trillion stars in a billion galaxies.’ The crucial word comes at the very beginning of the passage, ‘It seems.’ It’s unclear whether this is reality or imagined, and even whether Jamie or Harmony is dreaming the other person. The short story makes the ambiguity even more profound, ending with the words, ‘It was how all their games ended’, casting doubt on the whole story; has it all just been a game?\n\n8 Time is Running Out\n\nThis is another song about the journey through life, probably the most autobiographical song on the album. In Chapter 24 of his book (entitled ‘60’), Wilson, then in his mid-fifties, describes the decade between 50 and 60 as only ’16 per cent’ of his time on Earth, showing how time seems to speed up as you get older. He also addresses the irony that just when you have worked out what to do with your life, you realise ‘time is running out.’\n\nVerse one compares the short existence of the human soul to ‘a cigarette on a summer night’, that burns out all too quickly. The image of the burning cigarette recalls Macbeth’s famous speech from Shakespeare’s 1606 play of the same name, beginning with the words, ‘Tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow’,\n\nOut, out, brief candle! /Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player, /That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, /And then is heard no more.\n\nThe second verse addresses the protagonist as a ‘startled deer in the headlights’, imagery which is reminiscent of a much earlier Porcupine Tree song about life’s journey, Arriving Somewhere But Not Here from Deadwing (2005), ‘Never stop the car on the drive in the dark.’ The chorus of the earlier song expresses the same sentiment as verse two of Time is Running Out,\n\n‘All my designs simplified/ And all of my plans compromised/ All of my dreams sacrificed.’\n\nIt’s remarkable that Wilson, writing only in his mid-to late-thirties, was able to express the sentiments of the song he wrote 20 years later.\n\nThe existential crisis suffered by the protagonist is illustrated by the panic attack he suffers ‘mid-way through the flight.’ The lyrics recall the Radiohead song Burn the Witch from their 2016 album A Moon Shaped Pool, ‘This is a low-flying panic attack.’ Another song on the same album, Glass Eyes, finds the protagonist getting off a train in a panic, finding it, ‘a frightening place’, with the cold glass eyes of the other passengers whose faces are ‘concrete grey.’\n\nThere’s a nostalgic element in verse three, Wilson name-checking the works of various bands and artist from the late 1970s when he was in his early teens. The Future Now is a 1978 album by the singer, musician and songwriter Peter Hammill, also a member of prog-rock band Van der Graaf Generator. In his book, Wilson describes the ‘twisted and nihilistic’ prog of Hammill and his band as being one of his ‘absolute favourites.’ The ‘Poison Girls’ were an English punk band formed in 1976, and their first album Hex was released in 1979. The Kick Inside was Kate Bush’s first album, from 1978. Wilson has often spoken of his admiration for her work. Finally, ‘a war of worlds’ refers to Jeff Wayne’s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds (1978) based on H.G. Wells’ novel of the same name published in 1898. Wilson discussed the album with Tim Bowness in their podcast The Album Years. Wilson described it as ‘an absolute masterpiece.’\n\n9 Actual Brutal Facts\n\nUnusually, this track features Wilson speaking rhythmically – not quite rapping – rather than singing. He told Stephen Humphries of Under the Radar that he was strongly influenced by Jack Dangers of the electronic group Meat Beat Manifesto, who did programming on this and other tracks, to write a track ‘in a hip-hop rhythm or at least trip hop.’ The vocals recall the quietly ominous rapping on Risingson from Mezzanine by Massive Attack (1998) provided by 3D (Robert Del Naja) and Daddy G (Grantley Evan Marshall).\n\nWilson created a similar sound by pitching his vocal down a few semitones; some listeners didn’t initially recognise his voice. There is a precedent for the use of spoken word/rapping in Wilson’s work – the title track of Deadwing (2005) includes a rhythmically vigorous contribution from Mikael Åkerfeldt of Opeth. And on tracks like King Ghost from The Future Bites Wilson heavily manipulated his voice to make it go much lower (and higher!) showing a new confidence in his vocal delivery that began with that album, partly due to the encouragement of his co-Producer David Kosten. The new confidence Wilson has in his voice is reflected in the supreme rhythmic precision with which he delivers the lyrics.\n\nThe protagonist of the song is the third of the despicable characters addressed on the album (the other two appear on Inclination and Beautiful Scarecrow; or perhaps it is the same character?). The opening line, ‘condescending will as condescending does’ is a clever reversal of the old expression, ‘handsome is as handsome does’, meaning that true beauty is revealed by a person’s deeds rather than physical beauty. There is also another reference to life’s journey and the significance that living a valid existence can bring (one of the themes of the Porcupine Tree album Signify from 1996). In this case, the protagonist’s past weighs heavily on him, ‘You drag the passing years behind you on a ball and chain.’\n\nBeatriz G Aranda of the Spanish newspaper El País suggested to Wilson that the chorus lyrics, ‘when you turn the shit to gold it’s not appreciated’ could be autobiographical. Wilson modestly replied, ‘I don’t consider myself that good at making gold!’ He also said, however, that if he had been born ten years earlier, he would probably have found it easier to achieve recognition. But a more likely protagonist is the ‘gold man’ described in Harridan on the last Porcupine Tree album Closure/Continuation, like the mythical King Midas whose every touch turned objects into gold – at first seen as a blessing when he touched roses but then as a curse when food and even his daughter turned to gold.\n\n10 Staircase\n\nThe final track on the album adopts the central staircase image, representing life’s journey. Wilson told Stephen Humphries that the staircase in this song represents the pressures of ‘growing older in this modern world; such as providing for your family, getting on the property ladder’, dealing with stress, anxiety, illness, your children’s health, and social pressures. In July 2022, over a year before the album’s release, speaking to Jonathan Cornell of Immersive Audio Album, Wilson said Staircase was a ‘pretty generic title’ and he was thinking of changing it, but he obviously decided not to, perhaps as the characters from the short story, Harmony and Jamie, became less important to the album than the staircase metaphor itself.\n\nWilson told Mark Millar of The XS Noize Podcast that the track was the last one to be written, and that he had agonised over writing it because he knew it was going to be the closing track, ‘I wanted it to feel like the final scene in a movie… the climax to this movie.’ Wilson has solved this problem, both by making the final track one of the strongest on the album, and by creating a track which has a complex structure like a short film over nearly ten minutes.\n\nTo add to the complexity of the track, there are two drummers playing at once. Wilson chose Craig Blundell who joined him on the To The Bone tour and plays on most of the current album. Blundell also played with other members of Wilson’s touring band – Nick Beggs and Adam Holzman – on the excellent jazz-inflected Trifecta. The other drummer is Sam Fogarino from the American rock bank Interpol. Wilson told Millar that Blundell played a very busy, technical part whereas Fogarino played in a more direct indie style. The result, which Wilson said took him weeks of trying different things to get right, is amusingly described by Wilson as a, ‘kind of composite Frankenstein drum pad.’\n\nThe track begins with a sparkling synth loop written on a Moog arpeggiator, in what sounds like a complex polyrhythm but is in fact in standard 4/4 – Wilson shares a love of rhythmic complexity with Gavin Harrison, Porcupine Tree’s drummer. The deep voice at around 0.45 is Wilson’s own, tuned down using vocal processing of the kind used extensively on the previous album. The bubbling bass line that arrives at around 1.15 could also have come from that album. The track springs gloriously to life at around 1.40, after some joyfully sarcastic backing vocals on the words ‘congratulate yourself’ which amplify the central theme of the first section of the track, the pointless accumulation of wealth.\n\nThe guitar solo, beautifully played by Niko Tsonev on a Fender Strat with some lovely David Gilmour string bends, breaks all the usual structural rules by appearing at just over two minutes into a nine and a half minute track. A breakdown section at around 3.00 leads to the chorus which begins with a reference that will delight Porcupine Tree fans, ‘a train set’. The song Trains from the 2002 album In Absentia is a fan favourite, with over 32m plays on Spotify at the time of writing. And Wilson got a train set for his birthday in 2019, as he excitedly announced on Instagram – nearly 50 years since his parents bought him his first one! Whether he ever got a ‘daguerreotype’ (a type of photograph popular in Victorian times) for his birthday is unknown. Like many of the words in the chorus, it appears to be there for its rhythmic punch rather than a deeper meaning.\n\nThe muscular bass solo by Nick Beggs on Chapman stick at around 5.00 is a highlight of the track, and indeed the album as a whole. The track drops away again at around 5.40; most artists would have ended it there, but Wilson instead plays some lovely contemplative piano chords that take us to the sound world of Hand. Cannot. Erase. (2015). Adam Holzman provides an evocative Moog solo that recalls the work of Swiss keyboard player Patrick Moraz, who played for Yes and the Moody Blues and worked closely with Robert Moog in the 1970s. As the track ends the Moog solo continues and we are transported again to the distant view of the Earth that we visited during the title track, via Rotem Wilson’s spoken words. A transcendent ending to a superb track.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt seems strange to classify The Harmony Codex as a lockdown album, compared for instance with the album Under a Spell by Porcupine Tree’s Richard Barbieri, which Barbieri described as a ‘weird, self-contained dream-state album’ reacting to ‘all this strangeness going on outside’ during the pandemic. In some ways, although it was written and recorded before lockdown, Wilson’s previous album The Future Bites has more of a lockdown feel to it. That album somehow reflected the intense inwardness of being trapped at home, with its concentration on electronics and heavily processed vocals and percussion. The postponement of the album’s release and cancellation of the accompanying tour because of the pandemic, with all the promotional interviews done on Zoom rather than in person, also strengthened the sense of it being a lockdown album.\n\nIronically, Wilson used the extra time he had at home during the pandemic to collaborate much more with other musicians, whereas the previous album had comparatively few collaborators – although it’s worth mentioning Sir Elton John’s spoken word contribution on Personal Shopper from that album. While writing The Harmony Codex, Wilson took the time to revisit his complete creative landscape, adding the richness of his solo albums before The Future Bites to the spiky electronics of that album.\n\nThe result is an album that is more eclectic than any of his previous work, more ambitious in scope, a cinematic treat for the ears and food for the soul. As Wilson approaches middle age (he was 56 last November) he uses his vast experience as a musician, songwriter and producer to create new worlds with each project. After over 30 years in the music industry, many artists (and their fans) would be very happy to repeat the same musical formula they perfected early in their career. It’s to Wilson’s immense credit that he continues to progress, sometimes deliberately alienating some of his fans, but constantly surprising and delighting those who are prepared to stay with him.\n\nSources\n\nKent, N.

The event was described by The Times as ‘a prog-rock comeback of propulsive perfection.’\n\nPorcupine Tree began essentially as a solo project for Steven Wilson, a fictitious band he had created to amuse himself. On the band’s first album, On The Sunday Of Life, some of the lyrics were written by his friend Alan Duffy, but otherwise Wilson wrote and performed the whole record. By the second album, Up The Downstair he began to be joined by other musicians and by the third album The Sky Moves Sideways Porcupine Tree had become a full band, largely so that Wilson could have his music played live.\n\nTwo decades later, the band began a run of classic albums that began with In Absentia in 2002. But the early albums have a great deal to offer, not just because they show the fascinating development of the band from psychedelia to their mature style, but also because they contain some very strong songs that demonstrate Wilson’s excellent songwriting, producing and arranging skills from the very start of his career.\n\nOn The Sunday of Life (1992)\n\nRadioactive Toy\n\nA song about nuclear war. The ‘radioactive toy’ which provides the ‘freedom to destroy’ suggests the words of Robert Oppenheimer, the ‘father of the atomic bomb’, who quoted from the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad Gita, ‘Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds’ when he witnessed the first detonation of a nuclear weapon on 16 July 1945. The following month, atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The track is closely related to ‘A Smart Kid’ from Porcupine Tree’s fifth album Stupid Dream, which describes the effects of nuclear war.\n\nLyrically ‘Radioactive Toy’ is very sophisticated. It shows Wilson’s early ability to write poetic lyrics that encapsulate a mood or an idea very elegantly and with great economy, as in the bleak line describing disposal of a body after a nuclear war,\n\nPour me into a hole, inform my next of kin\n\nThe same level of sophistication can be found in the musical structure and feel of the song; only the first few minutes feature vocals, after which it becomes a long instrumental. The long form song has been a feature of Wilson’s writing throughout his career, both with Porcupine Tree and his later solo projects.\n\nThe bass line of ‘Radioactive Toy’ is very reminiscent of ‘Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2’ from Pink Floyd’s The Wall (1979); it is in the same key as well, although it is slower, bringing a more ominous feel. The guitar parts are in a similar style to those of David Gilmour and lyrically the dark theme is very Floydian, leading some early fans of Porcupine Tree to hope that the band would be the next Pink Floyd.\n\nWhether or not the Pink Floyd comparison is valid, the track is the most satisfying on the album, a real highlight, and it gives a fascinating insight into the future direction the band would take. The fact that it is a personal favourite of Wilson’s is shown by his choice of the song for the setlist for the first ever live gig that Porcupine Tree played, in December 1993. He was still playing it twenty years later, on the 2013 tour supporting his solo album The Raven that Refused to Sing.\n\nAnd The Swallows Dance Above The Sun\n\nThe lyrics for this early track were written by Alan Duffy. According to the sleeve notes for the Stars Die compilation, they form a psychedelic poem about, ‘the contradictions of being trapped in boredom while surrounded by wonder.’ Duffy originally called the song ‘Like Ice On The Sun’ when he sent it to Wilson, but the name was changed later.\n\nWilson’s vocal delivery perfectly conjures up the mood of the lyrics, sounding breathless with excitement but bored at the same time, the repetition of the same rhythmic and lyrical pattern creating a trance-like effect. The rhythm is provided by a drum machine, with a similar feel to the drum break in James Brown’s 1970 song Funky Drummer. With its funky bassline and heavy echo on the voice, smooth synth pads and inventive guitar parts, the song has something of a long-lost early 1990s dance classic. The track also has a pleasing set of falling chords as it drifts languidly towards the words, ‘and the swallows dance above the sun.’ Although it is very different from most of the songs Wilson has written in the three decades since, there are signs here of a great songwriter finding his voice.\n\nUp The Downstair (1993)\n\nAlways Never\n\nThis is one of a number of tracks on the album with lyrics by Alan Duffy. The song is about the different stages of a relationship, compressed into two lines,\n\nI love you sometimes\n\nAlways never\n\nThe relationship is over now, and the narrator feels completely alienated from the addressee of the song and has become emotionally detached.\n\nThis track marks the debut of Colin Edwin as bass player. The bass line is less prominent than on many of the songs from later albums, but it is an auspicious start, demonstrating the inventiveness and great musicality that characterised Colin’s work throughout his career with the band. The song also features a riff that unites the guitar and bass, around two minutes in, that could have come from one of the much later albums if more distortion had been added, again an early sign of the much more heavy metal sound the band would later adopt.\n\nThe vocals in the verse sound completely resigned, reflecting the emptiness of the narrator’s feelings. The chorus is livelier, illustrating the fast movement of the relationship from beginning to end. It could be the chorus from a simple pop song, and sticks in the mind in the way that pop choruses often do. If the song stopped at three minutes, then it could be a single, but there are another four minutes of largely instrumental music to follow. After treading water for a while before the final verse is delivered, the track picks up momentum with a long guitar solo as it hurtles towards the conclusion, where again there is a brief moment of stasis leading into the title track.\n\nUp The Downstair\n\nAccording to the sleeve notes for Stars Die, this track is a ‘menacing trance epic.’ The song marks the introduction of keyboard player Richard Barbieri to the band. The track also features spoken words from Richard’s wife Suzanne, a writer and musician.\n\nThe spoken words are a stream of consciousness written by Wilson, including phrases like ‘Monuments burn into moments’ (the title of an earlier short track on the album) and\n\nBlack Sunday of sleep\n\nOpen for small angel escapes\n\nThe words are buried quite deep in the mix and are meant to create a surreal impression rather than being analysed in a conventional way.\n\nThe track begins with an ominous low drone which is joined by dystopian synth lines and a Mellotron choir which sounds like morose monks chanting. The synthesized bass line is trancelike, euphoric and mesmeric, endlessly looping back on itself. The heavily sequenced synth chords sparkle and glitter. The guitar part that arrives with a sudden change of key around four minutes is urgent, driving, and viscerally exciting.\n\nAt around seven minutes, the bass drops out and there is brief passage of introspection before the rhythm picks up again and tension builds as the track ascends to a climax, before dropping back into contemplation as the monks briefly return.\n\nBeing able to build up the dynamics over a long track (ten minutes in this case) has stood Wilson in good stead over his very long and productive career.\n\nThe Sky Moves Sideways (1995)\n\nStars Die\n\nAlthough not on the original UK album release, this track did appear on the US release in 1995. It is a very strong track, suggesting the direction the band was heading in future albums, and it therefore seems strange that it was left off the original UK release. The track gives its name to the 2002 compilation Stars Die: The Delerium Years 1991–1997, which is an excellent introduction to Porcupine Tree’s early years.\n\nThe song is beautifully melancholy, with a simple but haunting chorus that consists of only the two words of the title, in a two-note rising phrase with luxurious backing vocals. The concept of stars dying suggests that in the long term everything dies, that humanity is fragile and ephemeral and that the Earth itself will eventually perish.\n\nThe sample at around 2:30 is of President Richard Nixon speaking from the Oval Office in the White House to the Apollo 11 astronauts, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during the first Moon Landing in 1969. In what he describes as ‘the most historic telephone call ever made’, the President says that the astronauts’ achievements have inspired mankind to ‘redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquillity to Earth.’\n\nPerhaps the mission to the Moon brings hope. Although the song itself does not suggest that ‘peace and tranquillity’ will come to Earth, it does end with an image of humanity blasting away into space, astronauts in ‘hyper sleep’, the deep coma-like sleep that is essential for long-distance space travel.\n\nA Dislocated Day\n\nOn the original 1995 album all instruments on this track are performed by Wilson. Drums were added later by Gavin Harrison (who joined the band in 2002) for the 2004 re-release.\n\nThe track begins with a phone call which is not answered until the end, when Wilson is heard leaving a message. The rhythm is quite uneven and jerky, expertly creating a physical impression of the dislocation in the title. At the same time the sense of metaphorical dislocation from the rest of the world is beautifully expressed by the floating synthesisers and the detached vocals, drifting downwards as the track progresses. The surreal lyrics suggest that Wilson was still under the influence of Alan Duffy, retaining also some of Duffy’s quirky wit,\n\nStood beside an inlet\n\nA starfish leads a dance\n\nIt dreams it is a human\n\nAnd falls into a trance\n\nThe song ends with the recorded telephone message, in which Wilson gives us a glimpse of his thought processes about how the track could end, but rather than replacing that thought with music he leaves the raw material,\n\n…acoustic guitar … feeding back towards the end. I think that would make quite an interesting ending. Anyway, let me know what you think and I’ll speak to you soon. Bye.\n\nSignify (1996)\n\nDark Matter\n\nThis track was originally called ‘Toursong.’ According to the notes for the Stars Die compilation, it began life as, ‘a fairly drab account of life on the road and its attendant boredoms’, but the band’s manager Richard Allen and the other members of Porcupine Tree objected to the lyrics which amounted to, ‘came off stage, had a cup of tea, went to bed’. Wilson changed them so that they were, ‘about the business of being a musician and a product’, to make it a haunting meditation on the futility and emptiness of the life of touring artist.\n\nThe title ‘Dark Matter’ refers to the release of recordings which the record companies regard as ‘product’, something ephemeral, rather than of lasting artistic significance, a theme to which Wilson returned on the next album Stupid Dream,\n\nDark matter flowing out on to a tape\n\nIs only as loud as the silence it breaks\n\nMost things decay in a matter of days\n\nThe product is sold the memory fades\n\nThe song begins with darkly atmospheric synth washes, evoking the permafrost inside the tour bus,\n\nInside the vehicle the cold is extreme\n\nThe cold is a metaphor for a failure to engage with the outside world,\n\nI fail to connect, it’s a tragic divide\n\nThe protagonist ruminates on the fact that music has become a full-time career, but that there are other, quicker ways to become famous when you are young,\n\nTo die young would take only 21 years\n\nGun down a school or blow up a car\n\nThe media circus would make you a star\n\nThe song features some gorgeous Hammond organ playing from Richard Barbieri, showing his love of vintage keyboards rather than using emulation software to recreate sounds digitally. Wilson’s vocals are very closely-mic’d in the verses, giving the impression that the listener is on the tour bus with him. Most unusually for a Porcupine Tree song, the verses feature backing vocals, presumably from Chris Maitland (although he does not receive a specific credit for this track); usually the lush vocal harmonies that are so characteristic of many of the band’s songs appear only in the choruses, although the chorus of this song also features rich harmonies.\n\nThe song includes an extended guitar solo section which lasts around two minutes, culminating in a short section where the bass and the guitar join each other for a riff in unison, not as heavy as on many of the later albums but perhaps a little taster of the heavier, riff-driven style.\n\nWaiting (Phase One)\n\nThis track begins with the protagonist waiting to be ‘born again’, perhaps hoping for redemption, or at least for life to have some meaning. The repeated line, ‘Waiting … for the day when I will crawl away’ suggests hopelessness, even a desire for death.\n\nAccording to the sleeve notes for Stars Die, drummer Chris Maitland loved singing the vocal harmonies on the song, but if forced to take only one of the tracks to a desert island he would choose Colin Edwin’s bass line because, ‘it’s so hypnotic and subtle.’ Wilson’s guitar playing is another highlight, beginning with gentle strummed acoustic guitar chords, with spacey, psychedelic electric guitar which explodes towards the end in a manic solo that seems to express the frustration felt by the protagonist.\n\nStupid Dream (1999)\n\nEven Less\n\nThe song begins with a single held A on the strings, the note that classical orchestras always tune to, as if the orchestra were tuning up in anticipation. Slide guitars evoke a sunlit, humid American desert landscape, similar to that evoked by Ry Cooder’s soundtrack to the 1984 movie Paris, Texas. The guitars are doubled across the stereo channels so that they appear in both ears at once, a technique used extensively on later Porcupine Tree albums, particularly on heavy metal guitars, to add richness and bite.\n\nBut instead of remaining in an American setting, the song swiftly moves to an English landscape, as the same chords move from slide guitar to elemental distorted chords, almost punk-like in the simplicity of the chord progression. Acoustic guitar and piano accompany the description of a body being washed up on a Norfolk beach, a friend who, ‘could not be reached’, who has presumably committed suicide. There follows an even more disturbing image of another body, ‘a choirboy buried on the moor.’\n\nThe song ends with a series of heavy guitar chords in ‘Drop D’ tuning, where the bottom note of the guitar is tuned down by a whole note, a technique beloved of heavy metal bands and used extensively on later Porcupine Tree albums. As such, the song marks an important transition for the band, from earlier psychedelia to later progressive metal. But Wilson has not moved away from psychedelia yet – above the brutal, visceral crunch of the heavy metal chords floats a lovely Floydian guitar solo, complete with string bends, a technique often used by David Gilmour.\n\nWilson reprised the song at the Royal Albert Hall in London on his To the Bone Tour in March 2018 (Track eighteen on the Home Invasion concert DVD). He dedicated the song to people who had been listening to his music before the 21st century. Channelling his inner Billy Bragg, he reminded the audience what a great rhythm guitarist he is, and by stripping the track to the bone, what a powerful song writer he is.\n\nDon’t Hate Me\n\nThis is the final song in a trilogy of songs on Stupid Dream about unrequited love. It begins with an image of a deserted London as light snow falls. The image of a train, often elsewhere a symbol of Wilson’s nostalgia for his childhood, here represents the emptiness of the scene as no-one get on or off the train. A relationship has broken up, and weary resignation that haunts the verses of the song. The chorus is more impassioned, as the unrequited lover, who is so, ‘tired and alone’, pleads not to be hated, a plea which is moderated by the deeply sarcastic line, ‘I’m not special like you.’\n\nThis is one of Porcupine Tree’s most atmospheric songs, with a jazz-inflected interlude switching between a laid-back flute solo and a more anguished saxophone, both played by Theo Travis, moving from resignation to bitter anger. The long instrumental interlude would be perfectly suited to a film noir movie, conjuring up an atmosphere of dark streets with silhouetted figures, and cigarette smoke curling through darkened rooms. Wilson has often spoken of his songs being like short films and this is a perfect example.\n\nBibliography\n\nPorcupine Tree review — a prog-rock comeback of propulsive perfection by Dominic Maxwell, The Times 14 November 2022\n\nNotes from Porcupine Tree – Stars Die: The Delerium Years 1991–1997 (Kscope 2002)\n\nOn Track … Porcupine Tree by Nick Holmes (Sonicbond September 2021)\n\nDeluxe re-issue of Porcupine Tree’s 2005 album casts new light on a classic\n\n*****\n\nDeadwing is the second album in a run of three classic releases from Porcupine Tree, starting with In Absentia in 2002 and ending with Fear of a Blank Planet in 2007. It was released in the middle of that sequence, in 2005. The new Deluxe Edition on CD is housed in a handsome hardback book of around a hundred pages, including photos and artwork by Lasse Hoile and Mike Bennion, and detailed articles by Stephen Humphries. In 2017, the band’s singer, guitarist and main songwriter Steven Wilson remastered the album for release on vinyl, and that mix is included here for the first time on CD. The first CD contains the full album and the second CD includes five B-sides. The third has 13 demos, the first seven of which were recorded by Wilson, the eighth by Wilson and drummer Gavin Harrison and the rest by the full band with Richard Barbieri on keyboards and Colin Edwin on bass. The generous fourth disc is a Blu-Ray which includes: a new documentary Never Stop the Car on a Drive in the Dark – the Making of Deadwing directed by Jeremy George; the album and B-sides remastered in high resolution stereo (96/24 LPCM); a 5.1 surround sound mix including four B-sides; a concert video recorded for the German Rockpalast television series at Live Music Hall, Köln, Germany in November 2005.\n\nThe Deadwing Film Script\n\nMany of the songs on the album relate to a film script of the same name, written by Wilson and the director Mike Bennion, with whom Wilson had collaborated, writing music for several TV commercials directed by Bennion. The film of Deadwing script was never made, although it did resurface in 2020 in a new, simpler version called And No Birds Sing. A short teaser (featuring a brief cameo of Wilson as a rough sleeper) was released on YouTube in September of that year, but to date the film hasn’t been completed.\n\nIn the meantime, the Deadwing album was released partly to help the film get made – Wilson and Bennion were having difficulty creating any interest in their script. The irony is that the album is based, as Wilson admits in the fascinating documentary in this Deluxe Edition, on a script of a film that no-one has ever seen, and on characters that are known only to Wilson and Bennion. Wilson enjoys the irony, but does admit that the problem – if there is one – is that the album is impenetrable both ‘lyrically and conceptually.’ What has made the album even more difficult to interpret – until now – is that it has never been entirely clear which of the songs on the album relate to the film script. Wilson admits that around half of the nine tracks on the album are taken from the script, including the title track, Lazarus, Open Car, and Arriving Somewhere But Not Here. He gives tantalising glimpses of parts of the plot of the film, admitting to Humphries for instance that the eerie spoken words on the title track ‘Like a cancer scare/In a dentist’s chair’ are taken directly from the script. The images and photography, which are extensively and beautifully presented in the lavish book are also almost entirely based on the film script.\n\nIn the documentary, Wilson refers to the two main characters in the script, David and Elizabeth. David works in a sound studio in Soho, London. As I mention in my book On Track … Porcupine Tree (Sonicbond Publishing, 2021) the first 15 pages of the Deadwing script were posted online, but are no longer available. For a detailed summary, please see page 86 of the book, but briefly David is seen working on the sound for a video and is horrified when he glimpses a small boy who appears mysteriously in one of the scenes he is editing. He later meets Elizabeth on a Tube train platform – it’s unclear who she is, although we are told that she is a young woman in her late twenties, with a long red coat and red high heels.\n\nA fascinating revelation made by Wilson in the documentary is that David is the only survivor of a religious cult after the rest of them died in a mass suicide twenty years before the start of the film. He fled the cult as a child, and the opening scene of the film script shows a three-year-old boy running, barefoot, through the woods at night wearing a nightshirt. Just before this, we see the boy’s mother singing a lullaby to him; are we to assume that his mother was a member of the cult and died in the mass suicide? The song Lazarus seems to be a dialogue between the boy and his dead mother – David is mentioned by name in the song.\n\nWilson has often written about religion in his lyrics for Porcupine Tree, and Halo on this album is about the holier-than-thou attitude of a born-again Christian,\n\nI’m not the same as you\n\nCause I’ve seen the light\n\nWilson has also shown his fascination with religious cults. The track Last Chance to Evacuate Planet Earth Before It Is Recycled (Lightbulb Sun 2000) features real spoken word footage from the leader of the Heaven’s Gate religious cult, 39 of whom committed suicide in March 1997 in the tragic belief that they had left their bodies to return to the ‘Level Above Human in Distant Space.’ Wilson revisited the theme in The Blind House (The Incident 2009) which is again based on a real-life case, when a police raid in 2008 on the Yearning for Zion ranch in Texas led to the release of 400 children, some of whom had married the polygamist cult leader who is now serving a long prison sentence for sexual activities with minors. It’s intriguing to note that in the interview with Humphries, Wilson says that in the film script the ghosts of the dead cult members are now coming back to reclaim David. This combines Wilson’s scepticism about religion (inherited from his scientist father as Wilson says in his book Limited Edition of One (Constable 2022)) with his love of ghost stories – as shown on his solo album The Raven That Refused to Sing (And Other Stories) from 2013, which is based on a series of ghost stories that Wilson wrote.\n\nDespite the revelation about David and the cult from which he escaped, Wilson admitted to Humphries that using a film script that very few people have ever seen (although Barbieri and Edwin did read it when recording the album) could make the album ‘a little unrelatable.’ He said that ‘nobody knew who David was’. We may have to wait until the film is released to find out more about him. But the film script is not crucial to an understanding of the album and an appreciation of its emotional resonance. In a revealing section of the documentary, Wilson says that songs like Lazarus have universal themes, such as childhood nostalgia and regret, lyrical themes which have continued to haunt his solo albums including The Raven … and Hand. Cannot. Erase. (2015). He modestly fails to mention the fact that the success of Lazarus (with over 18 million plays on Spotify it’s the band’s third most popular song and Wilson has played it live nearly 500 times) is partly due to the gorgeous melody and the vocals which are delivered with sweet sincerity. Critics may agonise over the exact meaning of a lyric, whereas listeners may respond to the emotional truth of a song which is revealed as much by the music as by the words.\n\nThe Demo tracks\n\nAnother revelation – perhaps more startling – is that Lazarus originally contained extra material as can be heard on the demo version on CD2. From around 2:25 to 3:10 there’s a very strange bridge section which sounds completely incongruous, much more like the early psychedelic pastiches of Porcupine Tree when the band was still Wilson’s solo project. It’s a very unusual lapse of judgment on Wilson’s part – most of his demos are very similar to the final versions, but in this case Andy Karp from the record company said that the demo version of the song ‘suddenly went haywire with a real curveball of a middle part.’ Karp and the band’s manager Andy Leff shared the same reaction to the middle section. Their role was to turn a good piece of art into a great piece of art, just as poet Ezra Pound did when editing T. S. Eliot’s masterpiece The Waste Land (1922).\n\nAnother, more subtle but equally important difference between the demo and the final version of a song is Arriving Somewhere But Not Here. The demo begins with two minutes of ethereal choirs and the sound of a church organ. As Barbieri says in the documentary, Wilson asked him to add his distinctive sound design to the opening of the track, replacing the demo version with a ‘slowly building backdrop’ that leads much more effectively to the ‘dramatic moment’ when the main guitar theme first appears. Barbieri adds the ticking of a grandfather clock, electronic bleeps, backwards piano and a synth patch called Arab Soft Synth to create a richly enigmatic soundscape which creates, as he told Humphries, a ‘serene but portentous mood.’\n\nThe other demos are mostly versions of tracks which appear on the final album or as B-sides which are already reviewed in detail in On Track … Porcupine Tree. The B-sides on CD 2 are also covered in the book, mostly as tracks on the Stars Die compilation (see pages 130 – 132). There are however four new demo songs in the Deluxe Edition which aren’t reviewed elsewhere:\n\nGodfearing (Wilson) [04:57]\n\nThis track has been available for about ten years on Wilson’s SoundCloud account, where he says that he’s not sure which album it belongs to, ‘while it shares lyrical themes with the songs on In Absentia, one of the melodies seems to relate to another piece from [the] Deadwing era.’ It now seems he has decided that it belongs to Deadwing.\n\nThis is an archetypal Porcupine Tree track from the band’s later era, with opening metal riffs that could have come from Swedish prog metal band Opeth (with whom Wilson was working around this time); lovely delicate vocals in the verses contrasting with an epic earworm of a chorus; a very heavy riff that could have come from Deadwing; a contemplative section with heavily echoed piano; imaginative use of hammered dulcimer and a taste of Mellotron … all beautifully combined into less than five minutes. It’s good that the track has finally found a home on an official release.\n\nVapour Trails (Wilson) [03.53]\n\nNot to be confused with the single Vapour Trail Lullaby which was written before the sessions for In Absentia but wasn’t released until 2010, when it was given away as a single with copies of Wilson’s solo DVD Insurgentes.\n\nThe song is a reminder (if one is needed) of Wilson’s supreme ability to write a simple, heartfelt ballad – recent examples include 12 Things I Forgot from his solo album The Future Bites (2021) or Of The New Day from the Porcupine Tree album Closure / Continuation (2022). Its status as a demo is shown by the slightly strained vocals, and the very simple arrangement mostly based around strummed acoustic guitar. But there’s some lovely George Harrison-like guitar later in the song, and at 3:30 there’s a heart-stopping moment when the instruments briefly drop out, leaving emotive multi-layered vocals hanging in the air like perfume.\n\nInstrumental Demo 1 (Porcupine Tree) [05.19]\n\nThis is one of five demos featuring the complete band. Wilson had previously presented the band with songs in the form of completed demos on which he played and sang all the parts, but on Deadwing he was beginning to relax control a little and allow other band members into the writing process. On the main album, Halo and Glass Arm Shattering are written by the whole band, and The Start Of Something Beautiful is co-written with Gavin Harrison.\n\nThis song is notable for a typically melodic, wide ranging bass line from Colin Edwin in the verse, robust and intelligent drumming from Harrison, some spacious soundscaping from Barbieri, and rocky guitar from Wilson.\n\nInstrumental Demo 2 (Porcupine Tree) [05.23]\n\nHarrison says that the danger of a whole band writing together in a room is that they end up playing for half an hour in E major, but this song features an uplifting and imaginative sequence of key changes from around 1:15 which lift the song beyond the most basic of demos. With more work, this could have been turned into a classic Porcupine Tree song. From around 3:30 Wilson shows off his skills as a guitarist and at 4:00 Barbieri adds evocative keyboards.\n\nThe Surround Sound Mix\n\nThe Deluxe Edition provides an opportunity to hear Deadwing in a surround sound mix in 5.1 only – it was much later that Wilson began to mix in the more immersive and sophisticated Dolby Atmos format. The first Porcupine Tree album to benefit from 5.1 surround sound was In Absentia, mixed by Elliot Scheiner. Wilson worked with Scheiner on the 5.1 mix of Deadwing and by the next album Fear of a Blank Planet (2007) he had learned the art so well that his surround sound mix was nominated for a Grammy award, as was his mix of the next album The Incident (2009). Wilson has since become the go-to surround sound mixer for classic albums by bands such as King Crimson, Roxy Music, Jethro Tull, Yes, Gentle Giant, XTC and Tears For Fears. More recently he mixed his latest solo album The Future Bites (2021) and the new Porcupine Tree album Closure/Continuation (2022) in Dolby Atmos as well, adding more precise placement of instruments in the surround sound picture and height information as well.\n\nThe 5.1 mix provides a coherent, immersive experience that creates a unique sound world, strengthening some of the weaker tracks by drawing them into a creative whole. Backing vocals become much better defined in the surround sound image. Heavy metal guitar riffs are visceral. Fizzing synths that are hidden in the stereo mix lurk menacingly. Excellent use is made of the rear speakers, with the spoken word passages in the title track leaping out to startle the listener. Two tracks in particular benefit from the mix. Mellotron Scratch brings out the beauty and the pain of the song. The bass drum at the start is much more prominent, the syncopated rhythm creating a deliciously uneasy effect. The harmony voices are gorgeous. Later in the song guitars and drums join in a moment of sudden robustness as the bass drum returns. The final track, Glass Arm Shattering, provides a lovely relaxation of tension after the visceral onslaught of much of the rest of the album. In stereo, the simplicity of the track is what is most noticeable after the proggy polyrhythms of the previous track, Start Of Something Beautiful. The surround sound mix turns the track into more of an epic, a climax like Eclipse, the closing track of Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side Of The Moon. The track begins with nostalgic vinyl crackles, which lead to lush drums and electronics. Slide guitars in the rear speakers add to the richness of the picture, and the multi-layered vocals take the listener to a new heights of emotion. The track ends with a touch of subtle humour, the sound of a stylus in a crackly groove on a record circling around the surround sound image turning the whole room into a vast record player.\n\nConclusion\n\nDeadwing is in some ways a transitional album. It consolidated the distinctive Porcupine Tree blueprint, a hybrid of progressive metal riffs, melodic strength and rich vocal harmonies that had been a feature of the previous album, In Absentia. Perhaps what Deadwing lacks compared to that album is conceptual coherence. The next album, Fear Of A Blank Planet used the same musical formula and added a very strong concept, making it the band’s masterpiece. But Deadwing does contain two classic Porcupine Tree tracks, Arriving Somewhere But Not Here and Lazarus, and most of the other material is strong. The Deluxe Edition adds a great deal to the enjoyment of the album, an insight into the creative process and an excellent surround sound mix. So, **** for the music itself and an extra * for the rest of the new package. Following the release of the In Absentia Deluxe Edition in 2020, a Deluxe Edition of Fear Of A Blank Planet would complete the trilogy nicely.\n\nTrack Listing\n\nCD1 Deadwing (2018 remaster)\n\n1 Deadwing [09:46]\n\n2 Shallow [04:17]\n\n3 Lazarus [04:19]\n\n4 Halo [04:39]\n\n5 Arriving Somewhere But Not Here [12:02]\n\n6 Mellotron Scratch [06:57]\n\n7 Open Car [03:44]\n\n8 Start Of Something Beautiful [07:43]\n\n9 Glass Arm Shattering [06:08]\n\nCD2 B-Sides\n\n1 Revenant [03:05]\n\n2 So Called Friend [04:49]\n\n3 Shesmovedon [04:55]\n\n4 Mother And Child Divided [05:00]\n\n5 Half Light [06:38]\n\nCD3 Demos\n\n1 Arriving Somewhere But Not Here (demo) [13:03]\n\n2 Godfearing (demo) [04:57]\n\n3 Lazarus (demo) [04:10]\n\n4 Open Car (demo) [05:08]\n\n5 Vapour Trails (demo) [03:53]\n\n6 Shallow (demo) [04:15]\n\n7 Deadwing (demo) [10:35]\n\n8 Mother And Child Divided (demo) [05:02]\n\n9 Instrumental Demo 1 [05:19]\n\n10 Halo (demo) [04:50]\n\n11 Instrumental Demo 2 [05:23]\n\n12 So Called Friend (demo) [05:01]\n\n13 Glass Arm Jam [04:19]\n\nBlu-ray\n\nDocumentary Film, Rockpalast Broadcast & Extras\n\n1 Never Stop the Car on a Drive in the Dark (Deadwing documentary [54:20]\n\n2 Lazarus (promo video) [04:19]\n\n3 Deadwing (remastered album 96/24 LPCM stereo) [59:37]\n\n4 Deadwing B-sides (96/24 LPCM stereo) [25:25]\n\n5 Deadwing 5.1 surround sound mix (including 4 bonus tracks) 48/24 (2005 by Elliot Scheiner and Steven Wilson) [59:37]\n\n6 Additional 5.1 mixes of B-sides Revenant, Mother and Child Divided, Half-Light and Shesmovedon [19.47]\n\nRockpalast WDR TV broadcast:\n\n7 Intro [00:35]\n\n8 Blackest Eyes [04:33] In Absentia\n\n9 Lazarus [03:58] Deadwing\n\n10 Futile [02:31] In Absentia bonus track\n\n11 Interview [06:02]\n\n12 Mother And Child Divided [04:50] Deadwing B-side\n\n13 So Called Friend [05:00] Deadwing B-side\n\n14 Arriving Somewhere But Not Here [12:24] Deadwing\n\n15 Sound Of Muzak [05:06] In Absentia\n\n16 Interview 2 [01:20]\n\n17 Start Of Something Beautiful [07:24] Deadwing\n\n18 Halo [05:03] Deadwing\n\n19 Interview 3 [03:35]\n\n20 Radioactive Toy [06:05] On The Sunday Of Life\n\n21 Trains [07.18] In Absentia\n\nReferences\n\nNever Stop the Car on a Drive in the Dark – the Making of Deadwing directed by Jeremy George\n\nDeadwing: The History and track-by-track by Stephen Humphries (Deadwing book)\n\nTwitter @PorcupineTree – first draft of Deadwing Script\n\nOn Track … Porcupine Tree: Every Album, Every Song by Nick Holmes (SonicBond Publishing September 2021)\n\nLimited Edition Of One – How To Succeed In The Music Industry Without Being Part of The Mainstream by Steven Wilson with Mick Wall (Constable, an imprint of Little, Brown April 2022)\n\nGodfearing on Wilson’s SoundCloud account\n\n*****\n\nPorcupine Tree return after 12 years’ hiatus with their new album which reached number 2 in the UK charts\n\nPink Floyd once satirised the music industry executive who said, ‘You gotta get an album out/You owe it to the people’ (Have a Cigar from their 1975 album Wish You Were Here). When Porcupine Tree went on an extended hiatus after their last concert in 2010, there was no pressure on them from a record company to ‘get an album out’. Band leader Steven Wilson had already launched what became an increasingly successful solo career. The other members of what is now known in copyright terms as ‘Porcupine Three’ were also pursuing their own careers. Keyboard player Richard Barbieri released a series of solo albums, most recently the troubled lockdown masterpiece Under a Spell. Drummer Gavin Harrison toured with King Crimson and became a member of The Pineapple Thief, and recorded a superb jazz fusion album Chemical Reactions with bass player Antoine Fafard.\n\nIn the meantime, another bass player was writing new material with Gavin Harrison – Steven Wilson himself. As long ago as 2012, Steven went round to Gavin’s house for a cup of tea and a chat. Gavin suggested that they should jam together, and the only instrument in Gavin’s home studio that resembled a lead guitar was a bass guitar. Pragmatism is the mother of creativity, so Steven picked up the bass and played it like a guitar player. Many years later, when promoting his most recent solo album, last year’s The Future Bites he said that he had fallen out of love with the guitar as the main source of his creativity, preferring to write on keyboards, particularly analogue synthesisers. When asked about the possible return of Porcupine Tree, he naturally always deflected the interviewer towards the solo work that he was promoting at the time, although a careful re-reading of some of those interviews now reveals that he was sometimes dropping hints that Porcupine Tree might come back at some stage, perhaps as a side-project to his solo career.\n\nSo, without any pressure or expectation, the three band members quietly wrote an album, now released under the intriguing title Closure/Continuation, suggesting that this could be the final chapter of the Porcupine Tree saga, or it could be the start of a new chapter. The lack of commercial or artistic pressure meant that the band were able to work in a completely new way. Previously, Steven Wilson had delivered songs to the band as fully completed demos which the band rerecorded. For the latest album, for the first time Steven wrote songs with the other band members, and all the instruments and vocals were performed by the three of them without any external collaborators. When their work was complete, they then offered it to several record companies, eventually going with the independent label Music for Nations who describe themselves as the ‘naughty corner of Sony Music UK, proving people wrong since 1983.’\n\nThe album has seven tracks, which are reviewed in more detail below, although streaming versions add another three tracks, Population Three, Never Have and Love in the Past Tense that are taken from the Deluxe Edition Box Set. The album is unusual in the band’s catalogue in the there is no over-arching concept as there is with many of their previous albums such as Fear of a Blank Planet. Steven Wilson’s own solo albums to date are based on a strong concept, except for the first album Insurgentes released in 2008. Perhaps the fact that songs were written piecemeal over a long period of time, and by all three band members rather than Steven Wilson on his own, meant that a concept was not appropriate this time, although the lyrics are all written by Steven Wilson and express some of the concerns he has visited on previous albums. To use a literary analogy, each song can be viewed as a self-contained short story rather than a chapter from a novel.\n\n01 Harridan (Harrison, Wilson)\n\nThe title of this song has caused some online commentators to reach for their dictionary to discover that it means a haggard old woman. It’s an insult, or as the Oxford English Dictionary politely puts it, ‘usually a term of vituperation.’ Perhaps it leads listeners to expect a misogynistic rant, but instead the song is addressed to a man, making the term neutral. The man in question is a ‘gold man’, perhaps like the mythical King Midas whose every touch turned objects into gold, with a ‘silver tongue’ suggesting a powerful man who uses his eloquence to hide the truth which he keeps to himself. The truth in this case is that ‘you can only save yourself’. The chorus refers to hiding our cuts and our hurt from the world, appearing strong even at the point of death, ‘when we bite the dust’. The central character of the song could be a politician of the like that is dismantled in the third song on the album ‘Rats Return’, but it’s not made clear.\n\nBut the song is not completely bleak. The bridge section is much more tender, a gorgeous depiction of the ‘time of the almost rain’ which the next song Of the New Day reveals to be dawn. The beauty of the scene is poignantly combined with an expression of deep loss and regret; having ‘gone to earth’ to find love, the protagonist laments lost love, ‘and what is left without you?’ Wilson sings with a remarkable tenderness here, expressing a new vulnerability in his voice which seems to have begun on his previous solo album The Future Bites, showing a new confidence in his ability to use his voice as an expressive instrument.\n\nThe song was chosen as the first single from the album, and it was a good choice to relaunch the band on an unsuspecting world. It contains all the elements that became associated with the later Porcupine Tree, metal riffs, rich sound design, a wide range of dynamics, strong melodies, evocative lyrics and a sense of development as the track progresses. But there’s a new simplicity on this album, with pared-down production that bears a close relationship to the production style on The Future Bites. There’s less in the way of overt musical virtuosity than on previous Porcupine Tree albums, except unsurprisingly from Gavin Harrison on drums. At a recent Q&A session with the band in Leeds, Wilson and Barbieri amusingly recounted the arguments they had about who was the worst musician in the band, each trying to claim the crown and both (rightly) agreeing that Harrison is definitely the best musician in the band.\n\nThe track starts with Wilson playing perhaps the funkiest bass line ever heard on a Porcupine Tree record, with lovely ambient keyboards from Barbieri and fierce vocals from Wilson. In common with some of the other tracks on the album, the chorus is very short, giving a real sense of urgency. There’s also a yearning quality in the chords that lead up to the chorus. The song seems to have reached its end only about three minutes in after the contemplative bridge section, but it gathers itself again with fizzing guitar and a thunderous metal riff with driving guitar chords. The sound drops out with bubbling synths flying across the stereo picture, followed by a whimsical jazz section with Wilson almost scat singing in falsetto above. Another driving chromatic section follows with a triumphant return of the chorus and its matching riff. The coda to the song is a repeat of the bridge section, ending on an unresolved chord which disappears into noise. An inspiring ending to a superb opening song, announcing the group’s exultant return as if In Absentia was released only a year or two ago rather than 20 years ago.\n\n02 Of The New Day (Wilson)\n\nAfter the onslaught of the previous song, there follows a gentle ballad which expresses hope and optimism at the breaking of dawn, described by the Greek poet Homer as ‘rosy-fingered dawn’, a memorable image of a time here described by Wilson as ‘the hour of almost rain/When night becomes the day.’ It’s an image of rebirth, but as this is a Porcupine Tree song there are ‘tinges of darkness around the edges’ as Wilson admitted in a Twitter Listening Party with Tim Burgess of The Charlatans on 29 June. The darkness here seems to be the protagonist’s old life, which is still there despite the breaking dawn, ‘the old days that line up behind/The monolith of the new day.’\n\nAlthough it’s superficially a simple song, behind the balladry lies the rhythmic genius of Gavin Harrison. Apparently Wilson told the band’s drummer that he wanted to write a song that had multiple time changes. This means that the song has a slightly stop-start feel but it’s so well executed that after the initial slight shock of the time changes it soon resides in the brain as a classic Steven Wilson ballad.\n\n03 Rats Return (Harrison, Wilson)\n\nThis song is about politicians who ‘leave their principles at the door’ who ‘purge [their] guilt for nameless hoards’ (pedants will note that the correct spelling of the word is ‘hordes’). The idea of rats returning ties in with the more common image of rats leaving a sinking ship; in the song the rats are presumably returning to celebrate their complete control over the places they have laid waste by their policies. The hint of a nautical image becomes more of a theme as the album progresses.\n\nThe idea of psychopaths running society is something that preoccupies Wilson; in the video for the track Eminent Sleaze on The Future Bites he plays a character who represents the ultimate extremes of Capitalism as he watches the world end, leaving him as the sole survivor.\n\nIn Rats Return, the line ‘a conscience won’t help you win the war’ perfectly encapsulates the level of psychopathy that politicians often appear to need in order to be leaders. It’s a concept explored by journalist and broadcaster Jon Ronson in his fascinating book, The Psychopath Test, which looks at the lack of empathy in public figures,\n\n“Serial killers ruin families,’ shrugged Bob. ‘Corporate and political and religious psychopaths ruin economies. They ruin societies.”\n\nThe Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry by Jon Ronson (Picador 2012)\n\nWilson makes it clear that he is referring to real political and military leaders when he lists ‘Genghis K’ (Genghis Kahn, the military leader who was responsible for the deaths of millions), ‘Pinochet’ (the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet) and ‘Mao Tse Tung’ (Chairman Mao, responsible for countless Chinese deaths during the Cultural Revolution).\n\nThe song is another exercise in rhythmic mastery from Harrison. On Twitter he pointed out that the rhythmic pattern is so complex it takes, ‘at least half the song before people realise that there is a repeat of a four-bar syncopation, in which every bar is different.’ As a result, the rhythm is ‘spiky’, which suits the song’s sentiments perfectly. The main guitar riff could have come from the progressive metal style of some of the songs on the previous three Porcupine Tree albums, but the song also has a contemporary feel due to the sparse production. It feels like another classic Porcupine Tree song in the making.\n\n04 Dignity (Barbieri, Wilson)\n\nThis song addresses one of Wilson’s favourite themes, the role of ambition in our lives and the failure to achieve our dreams – the ‘stupid dream’ described in the album of the same name in 1999. On the Twitter Listening Party he said that Dignity describes a guy who ‘really used to be someone’, a film star or a CEO who is now living on the street, and ‘all the pathos that goes with that downfall.’ But there is also hope – the central character retains his dignity despite his downfall, ‘your dignity will never go and your mind is pretty sound’\n\nThe song includes a reference to the final section of T. S. Eliot’s epic poem The Waste Land, What the thunder said, in the line ‘Tell yourself it’s just what the thunder said.’ The first part of that section of the poem refers to the aridity and sterility of life in the 20th century (the poem was written in 1922, so is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year). The poem ends with the Sanskrit word ‘Shantih’ repeated three times. The word Shantih, used at the end of Hindu religious texts the Upanishads, means peace. Eliot himself in his Notes to the poem described it as the equivalent of the Christian concept of ‘The Peace which passeth understanding’ or the Peace that God brings. In the context of the song, which has no overt religious message, the fact that the poem ends on an ineffably positive note could suggest that if the protagonist in the song ignores what the thunder said, and instead follows the final message of the poem, this could provide hope despite his downfall. Whether Wilson had the poem in mind when he wrote the song is unclear, although the final section also has a reference to hooded hordes swarming over endless plains, which could relate to the anonymous ‘nameless hordes’ referred to in Rats Return.\n\nThe song starts with the sound of children playing, rather like opening of First Regret from Wilson’s fourth solo album Hand.Cannot.Erase, a brief evocation of the nostalgic theme that has often appeared in his work. A haunting wordless vocal, pure in tone, is provided by the Swedish singer and multi-instrumentalist Lisen Rylander Löve who has worked with Richard Barbieri. A cascading rock guitar line leads to a syncopated vocal line with folky backing vocals provided by Wilson himself. The chorus has a soaring lead synth line which rises in gentle euphoria. The chord structure uses a classic songwriting technique beloved of The Beatles and others, the change from major to minor on the words ‘you stare at the sun’, here describing a moment of hope as the sun breaks through, followed by a return to melancholy on the final word ‘done’. These chord progressions give the song an instant feeling of warm nostalgia, as if the song had already been heard many times before in a dream.\n\n05 Herd Culling (Harrison, Barbieri, Wilson)\n\nThe track opens with the visceral lines, ‘Son, go fetch the rifle now/There’s something in the yard’, throwing us immediately into a compelling psychodrama. As a lyricist, Steven has a poet or script writer’s ability to enter a story in medias res, half way through a story, the nature of which is gradually revealed as the song progresses, teasing the listener to extract the meaning of the song. In a fascinating and very detailed interview by the ever-perceptive Anil Prasad of Innerviews.org, Steven Wilson revealed the meaning of this song. He later retracted, saying he would prefer listeners to make up their own minds, so those who prefer their views not to be influenced by the lyric writer’s thoughts should skip to the next paragraph now. Wilson told Prasad that the song was inspired by the story of Skinwalker Ranch, near Ballard, Utah. Several accounts suggest that the ranch has been plagued by paranormal activities and UFOs, and a slew of books, films and documentaries have been published about it. The song describes the family’s attempts to defend themselves against aliens, ‘strange gods above the earth’ who may have landed to ‘cull a herd’ of cattle on the ranch. He told Prasad, ‘I remain skeptical [sic] when it comes to the UFO stuff and government coverups. But I love the stories.’ His fascination with ghost stories led him to write a collection of them that made up his third solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing (And Other Stories) released in 2013. On that album he used the stories to illustrate his thoughts about the human condition, and emotions such as regret and feelings of loss, rather than a scientific exploration of the existence or otherwise of ghosts. His scepticism is echoed in the chorus of the song, which consists of the single word ‘liar’, resentfully muttered at first then viciously spat out as his venom increases.\n\n06 Walk the Plank (Barbieri, Wilson)\n\nAnother song about the corruption of power in the 21st century. On the Twitter Listening Party, Richard Barbieri described the song as being about ‘the sort of characters that are causing global trouble, a sign-of-the times commentary’. The nautical imagery is much more overt than on Rats Return; this time the rats have abandoned the sunken ship and ‘will never find their way back again.’\n\nThe song is very unusual in the Porcupine Tree canon in that it features almost entirely keyboards and drums, with very little if any guitar. To an extent, it shares the fiercely electronic sound of some of the songs on The Future Bites, particularly Eminent Sleaze although ironically much of that song was recorded using real instruments. If some of the songs on this new album feel like closure, finishing a chapter in the band’s previous history, this one feels forward-looking to new territories the band might explore in future if they carry on writing and recording together. Interestingly, on Twitter Richard Barbieri described the track as ‘the joker in the pack… if it went further it wouldn’t be Porcupine Tree.’ Steven Wilson said that if the band did work together again they would probably push towards a more keyboard-based sound with less prominence given to the guitar.\n\n07 Chimera’s Wreck (Harrison, Wilson)\n\nOn Twitter, Wilson described this as ‘perhaps the most personal song on the album.’ It addresses a subject that has often troubled him, the nature of success and what we imagine that would look like when we are young. The ‘chimera’ described here is the illusion of the future, ‘what we imagine we want from life when we’re young probably wouldn’t have made us happy anyway.’ As mentioned above this was the theme of the Stupid Dream album, and it was also the theme of one of the hidden treasures of the Porcupine Tree back catalogue, ‘Buying New Soul’ which was recorded during the sessions for Lightbulb Sun which was released in 2000. In that song, Wilson describes his battle with the recording industry and his attempt to retain artistic integrity, ‘I still rage and wage my little war’ – but it ends with the depressing concept of selling out, of buying a ‘new soul at the start of every year’.\n\nThe personal nature of the song is emphasised by the reference to Wilson’s father, who passed away in 2011, and to whom he dedicated his second solo album Grace for Drowning, which was released later that year. Wilson began working on Chimera’s Wreck shortly after that, and the image of his father smiling at a child encapsulates their relationship in one short line. The reference to ‘A new town in the 60s’ is presumably Wilson’s home town of Hemel Hempstead, England. The new part of the existing town was completed in 1962, ‘out of concrete a design made for tomorrow’, and Wilson himself was born five years later in 1967.\n\nThe song uses sea imagery as on other parts of the album. It’s interesting that some of the imagery and language is quite archaic, almost arcane at times. This contrasts with the use of language on Wilson’s last two solo albums, which is much more direct. The final verse of this song refers to slipping the ‘wreck’ into a bottle, which presumably refers to the old practice of putting a model ship into a bottle. In this case the wrecked ship that has washed up on a shore is perhaps sealed in a bottle to because it’s no longer needed – a hopeful note on which to end the album. The robust backing vocals that appear at just over two minutes into the track have the feel of a sea shanty, and giving the song a nautical feel, a curious throwback to the 19th century. Musically, a strange but perhaps valid comparison is the music of Van der Graaf Generator, and in particular another epic track with a nautical theme, A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers from the 1971 album Pawn Hearts. Chimera’s Wreck shares the driving, repeated riffs of many of the Van der Graaf Generator songs, and their episodic nature, making it the most prog-rock song on the album.\n\nWilson has said that this is the best Porcupine Tree album, along with Fear of a Blank Planet and In Absentia. He also admits that ‘time will tell.’ It’s certainly by far the most collaborative album the band have ever released. The lack of an over-arching concept perhaps makes it more difficult to grasp initially than many of the previous albums, but individual tracks are very strong and as with most of Steven Wilson’s work it takes a while to give up its secrets, so repeated listens are recommended. It also maintains the consistently excellent levels of production that have characterised Wilson’s work for decades now, both as a producer and as an expert remixer of classic albums. Let’s hope that the new album, to quote one of the band’s own song titles, is the ‘Start of Something Beautiful’ rather than a final coda to their work.\n\nFor a detailed, track-by-track analysis of the previous 10 studio albums, bonus tracks, live albums and compilations see Porcupine Tree On Track by Nick Holmes, published in September 2021 by Sonicbond."
