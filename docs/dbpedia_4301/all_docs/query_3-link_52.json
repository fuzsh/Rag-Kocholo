It features Mick Wilson from 10cc along with other world-class musicians and singers.

Far from being the five-minute wonder that was anticipated, it started a lifelong passion for pop music that is just as strong today as it was then. Wilson still owns his first guitar, which can be seen at the back of the CD booklet on his new album, So The Story Goes.\n\nTurning to the bass guitar and teaming up with his elder brother Dave, the pair formed a band called Flame that played locally around their hometown of Barking in Essex. This eventually led to a meeting with Alan Blakely from The Tremeloes, who was looking for a band to produce. Wilson’s first taste of a real studio was at the age of 14 when he recorded the lead vocals to the band’s first single—a cover of Frankie Lymon’s “A Teenager in Love.”\n\nFor the next few years, the band released more Blakely-produced material, appearing live and on TV shows in the UK and across Europe, culminating in a record deal with EMI (recording the single at the famous Abbey Road Studio 2) and supporting stable-mates The Rubettes on a European stadium tour in the late ‘70s.\n\nEducation called and Wilson decided to concentrate on schoolwork until he was asked if he wanted to tour Germany playing bass. Leaving 3 A-Levels behind, he celebrated his 18th birthday in Berlin and realized that this is where his heart lay.\n\nThe ‘80s saw Wilson learning his craft and playing in various bands in and around London, eventually putting down the bass and performing and recording just as a vocalist. Wilson’s love of songwriting and producing led to him securing a publishing deal with Jobete Music (the publishing arm of Motown Records) in 1986. The following year on a writing trip to New York, he was approached to sign a deal with Virgin Music in Los Angeles.\n\nSince then, Wilson has performed and recorded with artists including Lionel Ritchie, Alice Cooper, Kylie Minogue, Alison Moyet, Chris Rea, Donny Osmond, Robin Gibb, Westlife, Cliff Richard, Cher, Lulu, and the K.L.F. He is also a regular member of The SAS Band, which plays all over the world with guest artists including Brian May, Roger Taylor, Roger Daltrey, Paul Young, Kiki Dee, and Tony Hadley.\n\nWilson also serves as lead vocalist of Three Friends, playing the music of Gentle Giant and featuring two members of the original line-up—Gary Green and Malcolm Mortimore.\n\nAlongside live performances, Wilson has had his own recording and production facility for over 20 years, which has been the base for a varied career as a producer and songwriter, as well as composing music for television and live events for companies such as Sky, BBC, ITV, Marks & Spencer, McDonalds, B.T., Levi’s, Toyota, Mercedes, Ford, Reebok, and Mitsubishi.\n\nSince joining Graham Gouldman for an acoustic set at the Green Room in London’s Café Royal over 10 years ago, Wilson has become a regular in the latest incarnation of 10cc, taking on lead vocal duties and playing percussion, guitar, and keyboards. Wilson and Gouldman have also performed acoustic sets at numerous charity events including the Teenage Cancer Trust.\n\nWilson continues to be in demand as a session vocalist in and around London, where he is based. He most recently featured as one of the guest vocalists on a series of concerts across Spain with a 40-piece symphony orchestra and rock band playing the music of Queen.\n\nAbout the DSO\n\nThe acclaimed Detroit Symphony Orchestra is known for trailblazing performances, collaborations with the world’s foremost musical artists, and a deep connection to its city. Led by Music Director Jader Bignamini since 2020, the DSO makes its home at historic Orchestra Hall within the Max M. and Marjorie S. Fisher Music Center, offering a performance schedule that features the PVS Classical, PNC Pops, Paradise Jazz, and Young People’s Family Concert series. In addition, the DSO presents the William Davidson Neighborhood Concert Series in metro area venues, as well as eclectic multi-genre performances in its mid-size venue The Cube, constructed and curated with support from Peter D. & Julie F. Cummings. A dedication to broadcast innovation began in 1922, when the DSO became the first orchestra in the world to present a live radio broadcast of a concert and continues today with the groundbreaking Live from Orchestra Hall series of free webcasts.\n\nSince its first school concerts a century ago, and particularly since the founding of the Civic Youth Ensembles in 1970, the DSO has been a national leader in bringing the benefits of music education to students, teachers, and families in Detroit and surrounding communities. The DSO remains committed to expanding its participation in the growth and well-being of Detroit through programs like its Detroit Neighborhood Initiative—cultural events co-created with community partners and residents—and Detroit Harmony, a promise to provide an instrument and instruction to any student in the city who wants to learn. With unwavering support from the people of Detroit, the DSO actively pursues a mission to impact lives through the power of unforgettable musical experiences."
