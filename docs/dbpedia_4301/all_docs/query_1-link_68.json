        "text": "POP\n\nFull reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.\n\nONEIDA There’s something about Oneida’s music that seems as if it could go on forever. Maybe it’s that dissonant organ, pounding a few chords over and over in long, throbbing noise-drones. Or maybe it’s the vocals, chanted as if part of some ceremony from rock ’n’ roll’s tribal prehistory. It could be the drums, fast and strong and unrelenting. Whatever it is, Oneida has been bashing it out for 10 years now as the consummate Brooklyn avant-rock band, weird enough to play a single riff for 14 minutes, as it did on “Sheets of Easter,” from its 2002 double album, “Each One Teach One” (Jagjaguwar), yet enough of a meat-and-potatoes rock outfit to have clear stylistic connections to the MC5 and Led Zeppelin.\n\nOver the last decade it has been easy to take Oneida for granted, as the band — above, from left, Hanoi Jane, Kid Millions and Fat Bobby — has played countless club shows and parties, remaining a local favorite even as other Brooklyn groups like its onetime opening act the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have gone on to national prominence. But at P.S. 1 in Queens Saturday Oneida makes an elder-statesman gesture by playing a 10th-anniversary show, supported by friends like Sightings, Ex-Models and Dirty Faces. May the weirdness go on and on. (Saturday at 3 p.m., P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, 718-784-2084, ps1.org; $10.) BEN SISARIO\n\nACID MOTHERS GURU GURU, USAISAMONSTER (Saturday) An avant-rock supergroup, Acid Mothers Guru Guru is made up of members of Acid Mother’s Temple from Japan — who call their style “extreme trip music,” which basically means big, sloppy noise jams — and Mani Neumeier, drummer of the long-running German band Guru Guru, whose style is somewhere between free jazz and psychedelic rock. USAisamonster is a guitar-drum duo from Brooklyn whose jerky, robotic constructions turn into powerful blasts of sound. With Phantom Family Halo. At 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Ben Sisario)\n\n* AGAINST ME!, MATT & KIM (Wednesday) As an old-fashioned political punk band with pop ambitions, Against Me!, from Gainesville, Fla., walks a tightrope — two, in fact. One for making a slick major-label album, “New Wave” (Sire) — the group’s origins are as D.I.Y. as you can get — and another for its lyrics, which excoriate Condoleezza Rice but also rail against protest singers for not doing enough to stop the wars they sing about. Matt & Kim are indie-rock’s ultimate birthday band: a Brooklyn couple who pound organ and drums through irrationally exuberant, major-key romps that are equal parts garage-rock and Nintendo. With David Dondero. At 8 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (212) 260-4700, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; sold out. (Sisario)\n\nAN ALBATROSS (Wednesday) An Albatross, from Wilkes-Barre, Pa., shrieks its way through dizzying but lighthearted prog-hardcore songs that borrow something from Captain Beefheart. With Shock Cinema. At 11:30 p.m., Spiegeltent, Pier 17, South Street Seaport, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $25.\n\n(Sisario)\n\nAMIINA (Wednesday) The four women of Amiina, who have recorded and toured with their fellow Icelanders Sigur Ros, are nominally a string quartet but also go into twinklier realms, playing harmoniums, glockenspiels, singing wine glasses, bells, harpsichords and other instruments in dreamlike, celestial combinations. With David Karsten Daniels. At 8 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario)\n\n? ARCTIC MONKEYS, VOXTROT (Wednesday) Emerging from Sheffield, England, a few years ago as an unstoppable teenage indie-rock machine, Arctic Monkeys played perfect, cutting post-punk riffs and sang of night-life exhaustion with a jadedness beyond their years. Now, with the members barely into their 20s, the band returned this year with “Favourite Worst Nightmare” (Domino), and thankfully not much has changed. Like Morrissey or Ray Davies, Voxtrot’s Ramesh Srivastava uses the small scale, tight script and jangly energy of the three-minute rock song — as well as a fragile voice perfectly comfortable with its limitations — to focus emotionally compelling character studies. At 5 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, Central Park, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 307-7171;$32.50. (Sisario)\n\nAVENTURA (Saturday) This appealing Latino boy-band makes hits in a variety of genres, from bachata to R&B to reggaetón. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $79.50 to $114.50. (Kelefa Sanneh)\n\n? BATTLES, DEERHUNTER (Friday) Call it post-rock, call it math-rock — it doesn’t matter. The mostly instrumental New York band Battles has perfected a sinewy guitar minimalism that is as cerebral as it is visceral. Deerhunter, from Atlanta, weaves sweet guitar and high-pitched vocal overtones into patterns both florid and evil, as its androgynous and beanstalk-thin singer, Bradford Cox, puts on a performance that’s part somnambulist and part angry stripper. At 6, with DJ Mike Wolf. South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789, seaportmusicfestival.com; free. (Sisario)\n\nBILL CALLAHAN, SIR RICHARD BISHOP (Thursday) Performing as Smog or under his own name, Bill Callahan is a lo-fi obscurantist, mumbling in a lethargic baritone and playing simple, obstinate guitar patterns; he used to hide it all behind a screen of noise, but recently he has been content to let his music speak for itself, however cryptically. Sir Richard Bishop — the title is self-bestowed — is the guitarist of the experimental Phoenix group Sun City Girls, and despite his music’s dissonance and confusion, he has a sharp sense of humor: his latest album is “While My Guitar Violently Bleeds” (Locust Music). With Blues Control. At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $15. (Sisario)\n\nCLUTCH (Friday) Like a machine whose design was perfected in prototype, this Maryland band’s sound — a taut funk-metal with big, tough Black Sabbathesque riffs and barked vocals — has barely changed since its debut in 1993, nor should it. The group plays the Bowery Ballroom with Hidden Hand, featuring Scott Weinrich (a k a Wino) of the Maryland doom-metal band the Obsessed; Fiend Without a Face, with Brent Hinds of Mastodon; and the suddenly ubiquitous Beatallica, which plays parodic combinations of Beatles and Metallica songs (“Sgt. Hetfield’s Motorbreath Pub Band”). At 7, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out.\n\n(Sisario)\n\nDINOSAUR JR., DR. DOG (Monday) One of the greatest and most influential original grunge bands, Dinosaur Jr. joined mopey lyrics to furious guitar sludge, prefiguring Nirvana. Long estranged, the original lineup of J Mascis on guitar, Lou Barlow on bass and Murph on drums recently released “Beyond” (Fat Possum), their first album together in 18 years, sounding as brawny and vigorous as ever. Dr. Dog, from Philadelphia, takes a jam-band approach to high-energy rhapsodies that recall “Abbey Road”-era Beatles. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario)\n\nDUMPSTAPHUNK (Friday) One of the MySpace images for Ivan Neville’s new group gives an idea of where it’s coming from: the site shows a satellite picture of Hurricane Katrina about to crash into New Orleans. Funk bands are supposed to be about good times, and Dumpstaphunk, the current reigning New Orleans funk outfit, provides that in abundance. But in angry, topical songs like “Livin’ in a World Gone Mad” it also reminds us why the good vibes are so badly needed. At 11, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $17. (Sisario)\n\nTHE EXPLOSION (Saturday) This unapologetically retro Boston punk band — “We look to the past, and ask for nothing more” goes one song — announced this spring that it would be breaking up, but before joining the rock ’n’ roll graveyard plays this final show at the Knitting Factory. With Modern Life Is War and the Ergs. At 6 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $12. (Sisario)\n\nGOV’T MULE (Thursday) Warren Haynes is a true road warrior: besides the endless touring he does with the Allman Brothers — so far this year they have played the New York area at least 16 times — he also plays guitar with Gov’t Mule, his Southern-rock-meets-Led-Zeppelin jam band. With Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, and Earl Greyhound. At 4:30 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 307-7171; $35. (Sisario)\n\n? IRIE JAMBOREE (Sunday) The lineup for this second huge reggae concert in a week is impressive, with Stephen Marley, a child of Bob, who has distinguished himself as a rapper, songwriter and Grammy-winning producer; the dexterous dancehall star Beenie Man; Morgan Heritage, featuring the children of the reggae star Denroy Morgan; and Assassin, a DJ and vocalist who calls himself “Agent 006,” along with Mr. Vegas, Anthony B, Munga, Jovi Rockwell and Tony Matterhorn. At 1 p.m., Roy Wilkins Park, Baisley and Merrick Boulevards, Jamaica, Queens, (888) 474-3692, iriejamboree.com; $59.99 and $99.99. (Sisario)\n\n? DANIEL JOHNSTON (Tuesday) One of the great savants of underground pop, Mr. Johnston writes stirringly candid songs that sound as if they could be the dreams or nightmares of John Lennon. At 10 p.m., Spiegeltent, Pier 17, South Street Seaport, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $25 and $30. (Sisario)\n\nKATATONIA (Thursday) This Swedish band has a moody and histrionic style that the critic Chuck Eddy once described as “Neanderthal-black-metal-evolving-toward-Cro-Magnon-sorrow-metal.” Also on the bill are Chthonic — a Taiwanese group that specializes in operatic black metal, a style long dominated by Scandinavian bands — along with Scar Symmetry, Insomnium and Swallow the Sun. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sisario)\n\nDAYNA KURTZ (Friday) That’s not weariness in the plain alto of Dayna Kurtz, a singer-songwriter from Brooklyn skilled at conveying the sting of heartbreak. It’s vulnerability, which means that no matter how many times a relationship collapses, she is still hopeful when asking her lover to kiss her “like a stranger.” At 8, Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10. (Sisario)\n\nLEDISI (Friday) This San Francisco jazz-funk singer combines a large, raw talent with a sunny personality. She is still at the early stage of a career in which she takes a childlike delight in the variety of vocal sounds (everything from screams and whoops to clucks and clicks) she can produce. Her voice is her portable playground. With DJ Moni. At 8, Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $28.\n\n(Stephen Holden)\n\nNEW MODEL ARMY (Thursday) An English band founded in the early 1980s by the songwriter Justin Sullivan, New Model Army has held onto the vehement idealism and revved-up guitars of the British punk-rock pioneered by the Clash. With Echoes & Shadows and the Last Conspirators. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15. (Jon Pareles)\n\nOAKLEY HALL, THE TEETH (Tuesday) Patient country-rock mutates into powerful, noisy pulsations in the songs of Oakley Hall, a Brooklyn band led by Pat Sullivan, a former member of Brooklyn’s other masters of psychedelic minimalism, Oneida. The Teeth, led by twin brothers who reportedly still work at the same Philadelphia pizza and cheese-steak spot, play a smart and exuberantly overstuffed kind of guitar pop that comes down from the Kinks and David Bowie. With Ola Podrida. At 8:30 p.m., Maxwell’s, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $10. (Sisario)\n\nPETER BJORN & JOHN, THE CLIENTELE (Wednesday and Thursday) The latest sharp and impeccably stylish import from Sweden, the trio Peter Bjorn & John sets heavy-hearted vocals over spare but peppery band arrangements that recall 1960s folk-pop. Best of all: lots of great whistling. There’s comfort in familiarity, and the Clientele’s soft, sweetly finessed songs, with echoes of the Byrds’ gleaming folk-rock and George Harrison’s breathy calm, are a seductive sonic cocoon. Wednesday at 9 p.m., Maxwell’s, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; sold out. Thursday at 8 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $26.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario)\n\nSTEVE RILEY AND THE MAMOU PLAYBOYS (Thursday) The accordionist Steve Riley leads one of the best bands from the Louisiana bayous. It reaches back to some of the oldest Cajun tunes and can play them in traditional style, but it’s not afraid of swamp-rock or a touch of country, either. At 7:30 p.m., with a free dance lesson at 6:30 p.m., Connolly’s, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 597-5126, letszydeco.com; $22. (Pareles)SATELLITE PARTY (Wednesday) The latest unimpressive project of Perry Farrell is Satellite Party, whose debut album, “Ultra Payloaded” (Columbia), when not sounding like a limp imitation of Mr. Farrell’s former band, Jane’s Addiction, resorts to tricks like borrowing an unreleased vocal track from Jim Morrison. With Mink. At 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25. (Sisario)\n\n? SEBADOH (Sunday) Next to Pavement, Sebadoh was the pre-eminent 1990s slacker band, talented and witty yet never accused of putting too much care into its recordings or of singing too well in tune. Its lo-fi methods were inseparable from its shaggy aesthetic, and on the heels of two important reissues, “The Freed Man” from 1989 and “Sebadoh III” from 1991, the classic Sebadoh lineup of Lou Barlow, Eric Gaffney and Jason Loewenstein is touring for the first time in 14 years. (Mr. Barlow is also in town this week with his other reunited band, Dinosaur Jr., on Monday at Webster Hall.) With Die! Die! Die! At 7 p.m., Europa, 98 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $20. (Sisario)\n\n? PATTI SMITH (Tuesday) Now 60, Ms. Smith is one of the official ribbon-cutters and blessing-givers of New York rock. Last year she played the final show at CBGB, and for the last nine New Year’s Eves has presided at the Bowery Ballroom, playing the rhapsodic and elemental music that made her the queen of punk and art-rock in the ’70s. On Tuesday she opens the Music Hall of Williamsburg, a major addition to the city’s club scene that has been painstakingly constructed by the company that runs the Bowery. At 9 p.m., 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (212) 260-4700, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; sold out. (Sisario)\n\nSUNBURNED HAND OF THE MAN (Wednesday) Improvisation means lots of things in rock, but to this Massachusetts collective, which has been churning out dozens of albums and homemade recordings since the mid-’90s, it means spacey, meandering drones that seem like endless psychedelic trips. With Zaimph and D. Charles Speer. At 8 p.m., Death by Audio, 49 South Second Street, between Wythe and Kent Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com; $8. (Sisario)"
