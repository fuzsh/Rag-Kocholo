We identified a 64-protein signature that predicts with high specificity a subset of HGSOCs refractory to initial platinum-based therapy and is validated in two independent patient cohorts. We detected significant association between lack of Ch17 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and chemo-refractoriness. Based on pathway protein expression, we identified 5 clusters of HGSOC, which validated across two independent patient cohorts and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. These clusters may represent different mechanisms of refractoriness and implicate putative therapeutic vulnerabilities.\n\nIn brief\n\nPatients with high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs) have a poor outcome, with the standard of care not having changed over the decades. A detailed characterization of the proteogenomic landscape of HGSOCs across multiple cohorts and validation studies identifies a distinct signature that predicts with high specificity a subset of patients with chemotherapy-refractory cancers and implicates potential therapeutic vulnerabilities.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEpithelial ovarian cancer accounts for >185,000 deaths/year worldwide.1 The most common subtype, high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), accounts for 60% of deaths. Despite improvements in surgical and chemotherapeutic approaches, HGSOC mortality has not changed in decades.2 The 5-year survival rate remains ~30% for the majority of patients.1,2\n\nStandard of care involves surgical debulking combined with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carbo- or cisplatin in combination with a taxane.1,3 At diagnosis, HGSOC is among the most chemo-sensitive of all epithelial malignancies, with initial response rates of ~85%, presumably related to DNA repair defects.4 Platinum is thought primarily to drive the response rate, due to the lower single-agent response rate for taxanes.5\n\n10%–20% of HGSOC patients have treatment-refractory disease at diagnosis, fail to respond to initial therapy, and have a dismal prognosis.6 The poor response to subsequent therapy and median overall survival of ~12 months for these patients has not changed in 40 years.7,8 Even for the ~85% of tumors that respond to initial chemotherapy, most relapse as resistant disease,9 defined as recurrence within 6 months of completing platinum-based chemotherapy.10 This chemo-resistant phenotype, which can occur following a single or multiple rounds of therapy, is also associated with poor responses to subsequent therapies11 and limited survival. Patients whose ovarian cancer has responded with a partial or complete remission are often treated with PARP inhibitors as maintenance therapy, with the greatest benefit in relapse-free survival observed in cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.12 These regimens are supported by level 1 evidence from randomized phase III trials13–16 but unfortunately do not apply to patients with platinum-refractory HGSOC.\n\nDespite >30 years of literature studying platinum resistance in cancer,17 there currently is no way to distinguish refractory from sensitive HGSOCs prior to therapy. Consequently, patients with refractory disease experience the toxicity of platinum-based chemotherapy without benefit. Due to their rapid progression, they are commonly excluded from participating in clinical trials. Accordingly, there is no ongoing clinical research that could identify effective therapeutic agents for these patients or provide insights into molecular mechanisms of refractory disease.\n\nTo address this unmet clinical need, we performed proteogenomic analysis of treatment-naive HGSOCs (chemo-sensitive and chemo-refractory) and identified a 64-protein signature that predicts a subset of chemo-refractory HGSOCs with high specificity and is validated in two independent patient cohorts. Additionally, five molecular subtypes are identified, and implicate possible therapeutic vulnerabilities.\n\nRESULTS\n\nStudy cohort and proteogenomic profiling\n\nWe performed proteogenomic analyses on pre-treatment biopsies from three HGSOC patient cohorts: FFPE (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded) discovery (n = 158), FFPE validation (n = 20), and frozen validation (n = 64). Biopsies were collected at the time of primary debulking surgery (prior to chemotherapy) and were reasonably balanced between chemo-refractory and sensitive tumors ( ). Refractory cancers were defined as those that progressed or had stable disease within 6 cycles of initial platinum/taxane therapy after initial debulking surgery (STAR Methods). Sensitive tumors were defined as those that responded to initial platinum/taxane therapy and did not progress within 2 years (STAR Methods). Demographic and clinical annotations are provided in Table S1. Biopsies were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a multiplexed tandem-mass-tag (TMT) isobaric labeling approach coupled with randomization to avoid bias (STAR Methods). Details regarding biospecimens and data quality assessments are provided (Figures S1B–S1J; STAR Methods). Proteogenomic data can be queried, visualized, and downloaded from http://ptrc.cptac-data-view.org/.\n\nThe FFPE discovery cohort consisted of 158 biopsies (91 sensitive and 67 refractory) ( ) sourced from 3 academic centers and representing a wide range of storage times (Figure S1A). 11,080 proteins and 11,817 phosphosites were quantified by LC-MS/MS. 8,800 proteins and 2,648 phosphosites were observed in >50% of the biospecimens in either sensitive or refractory groups and were included in downstream analyses (STAR Methods, processed data). Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA-seq were performed on the FFPE discovery cohort samples. Using mutation and copy-number (CN) variation (CNV) information derived from the WGS data (STAR Methods), we delineated sets of likely somatic or germline pathogenic variants (“mutations”) and CN aberrations. After imposing strict quality control (QC) (STAR Methods), genomic data were available for mutations (n = 120 tumors), CNV (n = 120 tumors), loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (n = 118 tumors), and RNA-seq-based gene expression (n = 106 tumors) ( ).\n\nThe FFPE validation cohort was an independent set of 10 sensitive and 10 refractory HGSOCs from a 4th academic center. TMT-based LC-MS/MS analysis of the FFPE validation cohort tumors identified 8,237 proteins and 3,080 phosphosites that were observed in >50% of the biospecimens (in either sensitive or refractory groups) and were included in downstream analyses (STAR Methods, processed data). Additionally, after QC (STAR Methods), somatic mutation data and DNA CN alteration data were derived for 19 of the 20 samples, while RNA-seq-based gene expression data passed QC filters for 14 samples ( ).\n\nThe frozen validation cohort included 64 HGSOC tumors (44 sensitive, 20 refractory) ( ), of which 29 overlapped with the FFPE discovery cohort to assess replicability between biospecimen types (i.e., paired frozen and FFPE biospecimens from the same patient). TMT-based LC-MS/MS analyses in this cohort identified 8,272 proteins and 17,448 phosphosites that were observed in >50% of the biospecimens in either sensitive or refractory groups (STAR Methods, processed data) and were included in the downstream analyses.\n\nIn addition to the validation cohorts generated in this study, two external, independent cohorts were used for validating findings: (1) Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK)-IMPACT18 and (2) the National Cancer Institute’s Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium’s study (“CPTAC-2016”).19\n\nGenomic alterations associated with chemorefractoriness\n\nConsistent with prior reports,20 we found few recurrently mutated genes (FFPE discovery cohort) ( ; Table S1). Tumors harbored 1–7 (median = 2) mutations in known tumor suppressor genes, with mutations in DNA damage response genes TP53 (67.5%), BRCA1 (15.8%), BRCA2 (15%), and CDK12 (10%) being among the most common (Table S1). As expected, mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 were more frequent in sensitive (S) vs. refractory (R) tumors (p = 0.001) ( ). No other significant associations between simple mutations (including TP53) and response were observed.\n\nWe observed a lower frequency of TP53 mutations compared with previous studies,20,21 likely because we used an allele frequency cutoff of 11% for calling mutations, which was considerably higher than that used in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),20 resulting in a lower mutation call. We chose this cutoff to focus primarily on clonal mutation (driver) events likely to contribute to tumor biology and clinical behavior.\n\nBecause HGSOC is characterized by extensive genomic instability exemplified by segmental and chromosome-level alterations, or even whole-genome duplication,22,23 we performed absolute CN analysis (STAR Methods). Both sensitive and refractory tumors were remarkably unstable, with similar levels of aneuploidy and polyploidy, as well as broadly similar frequencies and patterns of gains and losses (Figure S1K). Further comparison of local genomic alterations revealed similar patterns of focal chromosomal gains and losses ( ).\n\nTranscripts, proteins, and CNVs associated with chemorefractoriness\n\nWe screened for individual RNAs/proteins/phosphosites whose abundances were associated with treatment response using linear regression models adjusted for anatomical tumor location, neoadjuvant status, age, institutional sample source site, and tumor purity (STAR Methods). 22 RNAs, 4 proteins, and 1 phosphosite showed association (false discovery rate [FDR] ≤ 0.1) with treatment response (FFPE discovery cohort) ( ; Table S1). The observed fold differences for significant proteins and phosphosites were small (0.77–1.29), while fold differences for significant RNAs ranged from 0.20 to 10.18. Among the four proteins associated with treatment response, transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) was more abundant in refractory vs. sensitive tumors, while CARMIL1, CCDC167, and TPMT were more abundant in sensitive tumors. Examination of the validation cohorts indicated that only CCDC167 was significantly elevated (marginal p value < 0.05) in sensitive tumors. Moreover, no association between the four proteins and survival was detected using the dataset from the CPTAC-2016 study19 (STAR Methods). The weak association between “individual” RNA/protein species and treatment response could be due to the high heterogeneity among HGSOCs and multitude of mechanisms underlying platinum responses.17\n\nExamining the CNV data, we detected 938 genes associated with treatment response (FDR < 0.1; Table S1). As CNV profiles have strong spatial correlation, many of these genes are likely passengers sitting close to genes affecting treatment response, rather than direct contributors. In fact, of 938 genes, 361 genes were from nearby regions on chromosome 6 (Chr6), 355 genes from chromosome 11 (Chr11), 158 genes from chromosome 5 (Chr5), and 46 genes from chromosome 20 (Chr20). It is reasonable to assume that only a small subset of transcripts/proteins in these big regions might be the real “drivers” of response. To point to potential treatment-related genes over passengers, we performed an integrative analysis, as described below.\n\nIntegrative analysis identifies chemotherapy-response-associated genes\n\nWe performed an integrative analysis combining CNV, RNA, and global protein data (FFPE discovery cohort) and validated our findings using independent cohorts (STAR Methods). 424 genes with a combined FDR < 0.1 were identified, 303 of which had consistently higher CNV/RNA/protein measurements in sensitive HGSOCs and 121 of which were higher in refractory tumors. Of these 424 genes, 53 were validated (marginal p value < 0.05) in at least one independent validation cohort from this study or the CPTAC-2016 cohort19 (Table S1). Interestingly, a small region on Chr6 ( ) contains a group of 7 genes (TRIM26, HLA-DMB, TAP1, TAP2, TAPBP, HSP90AB1, and HSPA1L) that were up in sensitive tumors and are members of immune pathways (e.g., antigen presentation/processing, interferon) ( ). For example, our analysis of both FFPE discovery and FFPE validation cohorts revealed that chemo-sensitive HGSOCs had elevated TAP1 protein, RNA, and CN compared with refractory tumors ( ). TAP1 is a transporter associated with antigen processing.24 We also identified higher (in refractory vs. sensitive) CN, RNA, and protein abundance of BCL2L1/BCLXL, an antiapoptotic protein associated with treatment resistance25,26 (Figure S1L).\n\ncis-regulation between CNV, RNA, and protein differs between sensitive and refractory tumors\n\nThe average gene-level CNV-RNA and RNA-protein correlations in sensitive tumors were significantly higher than in refractory tumors ( ). When applying iProFun27 (STAR Methods) to screen for genes whose CNVs were significantly associated with their own RNA and protein levels (“CNV-RNA/protein cascade genes”), we observed a higher percentage of cascade genes in sensitive vs. refractory tumors: of the 8,605 genes with both RNA and protein abundances measured, 55% and 42% in sensitive and refractory tumors, respectively, were detected as CNV-RNA-protein cascade genes (p < 2.2e–16, ; Table S2). The higher percentage of cascade genes in sensitive vs. refractory tumors was validated in the CPTAC-2016 cohort19: 49% and 41% (of the 4,795 eligible genes) in proxy-sensitive and proxy-refractory tumors (STAR Methods), respectively, had CNV-RNA/protein cascade effects (p < 2.2e–16; Figure S2A; Table S2). For both cohorts, metabolism pathways (e.g., tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, fatty acid metabolism, and heme metabolism) have a higher percentage of cascade genes, while ribosome and translation pathways have lower percentage of cascade genes relative to the genome average.\n\nChr17-LOH is associated with chemo-sensitivity\n\nConsistent with previous studies,28 we noted significant LOH for most chromosomes (Figure S2B), with chromosome 17 LOH (Chr17-LOH) being the most common (~80% of cases). Among all LOH events, only Chr17-LOH was significantly (FDR < 0.1) associated with chemo-sensitivity ( and ). No other chromosome-level gain, loss, or LOH event showed association with treatment response ( ). 75% of tumors heterozygous for Chr17 (i.e., without Chr17-LOH) were refractory, compared with only ~40% of those with Chr17-LOH ( ). Consistent with these results, we observed in an independent cohort, MSK-IMPACT,18 that tumors enriched for Chr17-LOH have significantly higher overall survival ( ; STAR Methods), as expected for chemo-responsive disease.\n\nTP53 inactivation is associated with chemo-sensitivity\n\nChr17 harbors multiple tumor suppressor genes, including TP53. Bi-allelic inactivation of TP53 in cancers typically occurs through missense mutations accompanied by LOH.29 Indeed, we find that mutations in TP53 are significantly associated with Chr17-LOH (odds ratio [OR]: 14.6, p < 6.05e–06) ( ). We observed significantly higher TP53 RNA expression (p = 0.002) and p53 protein abundance (p = 0.001) in tumors with TP53 missense mutations vs. wild-type (WT) (consistent with the known stabilization of p53 by missense mutations30), and lower TP53 RNA expression (p = 0.024) and p53 protein abundance (p = 0.004) in tumors with TP53-truncating mutations (Figures S2D and S2E). Additionally, we observed elevated p53 levels (p = 0.011) among cases with Chr17-LOH ( ), in line with the enrichment of TP53 mutations in tumors with Chr17-LOH.\n\nWe hypothesized that the association between Chr17-LOH and sensitivity ( and ) is due to bi-allelic inactivation of TP53. We interrogated treatment responses stratified by genetic aberrations (i.e., TP53 mutations and Chr17-LOH) and by transcriptional signatures of both “WT” and “mutant” p53. Missense mutations abrogate WT p53 transcriptional activity31 and are associated with a mutant transcriptional signature.29 A WT p53 signature based on validated, direct, transcriptional targets of WT p53 has also been reported.32\n\nAs predicted, we found that Chr17-LOH was associated with a significantly lower WT p53 signature ( ) and a significantly higher mutant p53 signature (Figure S2G). The WT p53 signature tended to be higher in tumors without TP53 mutations, although the difference was not significant (Figure S2F). Moreover, tumors without Chr17-LOH have significantly higher expression of MDM2, a gene activated by WT p53, and significantly lower expression of CDC20, a gene repressed by WT p53 (Figures S2H and S2I). These results suggest that tumors without Chr17-LOH retain some p53 activity.\n\nNext, we asked whether WT or mutant p53 transcriptional signatures are associated with chemo-responsiveness. WT p53 activity was higher in refractory tumors ( ), whereas the mutant p53 signature was higher in sensitive tumors (Figure S2J). Tumors with both high WT TP53 activity and low mutant TP53 activity were predominately refractory (Figure S2K). Figure S2L illustrates selected pathways associated with Chr17-LOH. E2F targets are upregulated in tumors with Chr17-LOH (FDR = 1.47e–20), consistent with their lower WT p53 activity ( ), since WT p53 (acting through p21/CDKN1A and RB1) represses E2F.33 In addition, Chr17-LOH tumors show increased mTOR pathway expression (FDR = 3.1–21), consistent with repression of the mTOR pathway by WT P5334 (Table S2).\n\nUsing a multivariate regression model, we found that Chr17-LOH (OR: 15.76, p < 0.026), BRCA1/2 mutation (OR: 4.75, p < 0.011), and loss of WT TP53 activity (OR: 0.4, p < 0.006) remain independent predictors of response ( ). These results suggest that WT p53 activity is associated with refractoriness and that tumors with Chr17-LOH lack WT p53 activity, likely due to bi-allelic inactivation of TP53. Conversely, tumors with monoallelic, perhaps dominant-negative TP53 mutations, may retain some p53 WT activity.30\n\nResponse-associated proteins stratified by Chr17-LOH, BRCA1/2, and TP53 mutations\n\nWe hypothesized that additional biomarkers will be identified when tumors are stratified by Chr17-LOH, BRCA1/2, and TP53 mutations (Table S2). Using multivariate regression models with tumor mutation burden (TMB), patient age, and tumor purity as covariates (STAR Methods), we found that when cases were stratified by Chr17-LOH ( ), the abundance of L1CAM protein, a key driver of tumor cell invasion and motility35 that is strongly associated with TP53 mutations36 and poor prognosis,37 was positively associated with refractoriness (p = 1.9–5) in tumors with Chr17-LOH but not among cases heterozygous for Chr17 (p = 0.96) ( ). Conversely, expression of CDKN1A, a protein induced by WT p53,38 was associated with refractoriness in tumors without Chr17-LOH ( ). Because WT p53 activity was associated with refractoriness, we also dichotomized tumors by p53 activity scores ( ) and found that the TGM2 protein, a known TP53 target,39 was associated with refractoriness among high p53 activity tumors ( ).\n\nGenomic scars associated with chemo-response\n\nHGSOC genomes are characterized by “genomic scars” (i.e., summary scores reflecting patterns of genomic instability).40 In the clinical setting, the extent of number of telomeric allelic imbalances (nTAIs), weighted genomic integrity index (wGII), number of large-scale transitions (nLSTs), and number of LOH (nLOH) are used to identify homologous recombination-deficient (HRD) HGSOC as a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved companion diagnostic for selecting patients who benefit from PARP inhibitors.38 Since HRD is associated with chemo-sensitivity,41 we tested whether HRD scores differed between refractory and sensitive tumors ( ). We found elevated levels of “HRD scars” in sensitive tumors based on nTAI (p = 0.0176, left) and wGII (p = 0.053053, middle). Furthermore, chemo-sensitive tumors are associated with elevated frequencies of focal (short) gains and losses (p value = 0.0011, , right), but not with LSTs.\n\nAbove, we reported an association between Chr17-LOH and treatment response. Interestingly, tumors lacking Chr17-LOH had lower levels of genomic instability and HRD scores (nTAI and wGII), as well as weaker genome-wide LOH patterns vs. Chr17-LOH tumors (Figures S3A and S3B). Conversely, the genome-wide frequencies and distribution of chromosomal gains and losses were similar between tumors with and without Chr17-LOH (FigureS3B). To interrogate Chr17-LOH asa potential predictor of chemo-sensitivity in the context of the clinically established predictors (HRD score and BRCA1/2 mutation), we tested the association in a multivariate model ( ) and found that only Chr17-LOH and BRCA1/2 mutation status were predictive of response, both associated with chemo-sensitivity. We also noted an improvement in predictive power when Chr17-LOH is added to a baseline model combining clinical covariates and BRCA1/2 status in two S3H; independent patient cohorts ( and STAR Methods).The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of the resulting model is 0.73 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.63–0.84 (FFPE discovery cohort) ( ). In addition, the AUC of the resulting model is 0.66 with a 96% CI: 0.40–0.92 (FFPE validation cohort) (Figure S3H). Despite these encouraging results, better prediction models are needed for clinical practice. This motivated us to explore the proteomic data to determine whether more effective prediction models could be built based on protein markers.\n\nA protein panel predictive of refractoriness\n\nWe constructed an ensemble-based prediction model trained using global proteomic data (FFPE discovery cohort). We selected a panel of 1,082 proteins predictive of treatment responses ( ; STAR Methods) by leveraging proteogenomic profiles from HGSOC cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,42 31 years of literature on platinum resistance,17 and a machine-learning-based feature selection procedure (STAR Methods). We identified a subset of 64 proteins from the metabolic, hypoxia, and NF-κB pathways (Table S3; STAR Methods) that were associated with treatment response. We built an ensemble prediction model based on the 64 proteins using the ElasticNet,43 Random Forest,44 and XGBoost45 algorithms ( ; STAR Methods). Details regarding the 64 protein markers are shown in Figure S3C. For 7 out of the 64 proteins, the RNA-protein correlations were <0.25, and the correlations were negative for COX7A2, COX6C, and BIRC2 (Figure S3D), suggesting post-translational regulation.\n\nWe evaluated performance of the prediction model through 5-fold cross validation (CV) using the FFPE discovery cohort proteomic data. The ROC of the ensemble prediction models evaluated on the CV sets showed an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.77–0.90) ( ). At 98% specificity, we observed a sensitivity of 0.35 with 95% CI: 0.19–0.52. Next, we evaluated the performance of the prediction model using two independent patient cohorts (frozen and FFPE validation) ( ). For the frozen validation cohort, we separately considered the subsets of tumors that are independent of vs. overlapping with the FFPE discovery cohort. For the frozen-independent and frozen-overlapping subsets, we obtained AUCs of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.63–0.96) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.61–1.00), respectively. At 98% specificity, we observed a sensitivity of 0.25 (95% CI: 0.08–0.58) and 0.43 (95% CI: 0.14–0.86) for the frozen-independent and the frozen-overlapping subsets, respectively.\n\nFinally, because the FFPE validation data cannot be readily aligned with the FFPE discovery data (due to the lack of a common reference sample and small sample size), we re-estimated and evaluated the prediction model using 3-fold CV. The resulting AUC is 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84–1.00). At 98% specificity, we observed a sensitivity of 0.70 with 95% CI: 0.40–1.00. Based on these results, we conclude that a prediction model based on these 64 proteins detects a subset of refractory HGSOCs with high specificity.\n\nWe performed technical validation of the predictor model using a targeted multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) assay panel that quantifies 70 peptides representing 22 proteins from the model (STAR Methods). The assay was associated with an AUC of 0.76 (Figure S3G; CV), demonstrating the feasibility of developing a multiplex MRM assay for prediction and paving the way for an expanded assay including all 64 proteins in the model.\n\nWe built an ensemble-based prediction model using the phospho-proteomic data (FFPE discovery cohort) (STAR Methods) and obtained 89 phosphosites corresponding to metabolic, ERK, Fanconi, Hippo, and WNT signaling pathways. We evaluated the prediction performance of our model using the selected features in the FFPE discovery and FFPE validation phosphoproteomic data through CV. In the FFPE discovery data we obtained an AUC of 0.78, while in FFPE validation data, we obtained an AUC of 0.76 (Figures S3E and S3F).\n\nA proteogenomic panel predictive of refractoriness\n\nWe examined the prediction performance of a joint model using genetic predictors (Chr17-LOH and BRCA1/2 mutation status), the 64 protein markers, and clinical features (Figures S3I and S3J; STAR Methods). The resulting model achieved an AUC of 0.87 (CI: 0.79–0.93) on the training (FFPE discovery) cohort, and an AUC of 0.98 (CI: 0.93–1.00) on the FFPE validation cohort. These results were significantly better than the prediction models based on BRCA1/2 mutation status, Chr17, and clinical features in both the FFPE discovery (p = 0.038) and the FFPE validation cohorts (p = 0.016) (Table S3; STAR Methods). Moreover, at 98% specificity, the combined model had a sensitivity of 0.46 (CI: 0.1–0.66) and 0.8 (CI: 0.60–1.00) in the FFPE discovery and FFPE validation cohorts, respectively.\n\nPathway analysis shows diverse processes associated with refractoriness\n\nUsing enrichment analysis of global proteomic, phospho-proteomic, and RNA-seq data, we searched for pathways associated with sensitivity/refractoriness (Table S4). shows a subset of differentially expressed pathways (FDR < 0.1) in one or more of the omics datasets (FFPE discovery cohort). E2F targets, G2M checkpoint, and DNA replication, etc. are elevated in sensitive tumors in all omics datasets. Conversely, hypoxia, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), etc. are elevated in refractory tumors in all datasets. Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle are elevated in refractory tumors based on protein, but not RNA data, consistent with prior reports that concordance between proteomic and RNA-seq data are low for metabolic pathways.46 The implicated pathways have varying proportions of overlap with reported platinum resistance genes ( , left). We validated the association between several pathways and chemo-response using independent cohorts (FFPE, frozen, and CPTAC-201619) ( ; Table S4; STAR Methods).\n\nE2F transcription factors have been implicated in platinum response,47 and our study suggests an important role of silencing of this pathway in refractory disease, as significantly lower levels were observed in refractory tumors vs. sensitive tumors (Figure S4A). We also see that a multi-gene proliferation score48 is downregulated (Figure S4A; STAR Methods) in refractory tumors, suggesting a relatively lower proliferation rate. Consistent with these observations, downregulation of the E2F target PRIM2 (Figure S4A), which encodes the large subunit of the DNA primase, is associated with worse prognosis in ovarian cancer.49\n\nMultiple metabolic pathways were associated with chemo-refractory disease in two out of the three independent validation cohorts ( ), consistent with our previous studies using cell line and PDX models,42 where metabolic pathways were significantly upregulated in resistant cell lines and/or refractory tumors. Figure S4B illustrates the association of 492 proteins from metabolic pathways with response phenotype (FFPE discovery cohort). Among the 492 proteins, 45 were upregulated in refractory tumors (p < 0.05), including COX4I1, COX6A1, COX6C, COX7A2, COX7B, COX7C, MT-CO2, and NDUFA4, which are all part of mitochondrial complex IV (suggested to negatively regulate mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species50,51). Together with previous findings,42 our observations suggest association of these metabolic pathways with chemo-refractoriness in HGSOC.\n\nProtein-based pathway scores reveal five HGSOC clusters validated in independent patient cohorts and PDX models\n\nTo characterize the heterogeneity in mechanisms17 contributing to treatment response in HGSOCs, the top 150 pathways significantly enriched in differentially expressed proteins between chemo-sensitive and chemo-refractory tumors (FDR < 0.01, Table S4) were used to perform consensus clustering analysis (FFPE discovery cohort). Using single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA)-based protein pathway scores of the 150 pathways (STAR Methods), we identified 5 tumor clusters ( ). Cluster 1 was associated with higher expression of translational and rRNA processing pathways (pathway group 4, ). Clusters 1 and 2 showed high cell-cycle-related pathways (pathway group 5). Cluster 3 showed higher expression of metabolic pathways (pathway group 6), whereas cluster 4 showed upregulation of hypoxia, EMT, and TGF-β pathways (pathway group 3). Elevated immune pathway scores were observed in cluster 4 and 5 tumors (pathway group 1 and 2). Moreover, cluster 3 was enriched in chemo-refractory tumors (p = 0.027, Figure S4C). We did not observe association between the 5 clusters and tumor anatomical location (Figure S4D). We did observe more frequent Chr17-LOH in tumors in clusters 1–3 vs. clusters 4 and 5 (p = 0.020, ). Additionally, one region of chromosome 19p13.3 showed more frequent deletions in cluster 2 vs. other clusters (p < 0.0003) ( ; STAR Methods), while a large region of chromosome 1p had more frequent deletions in cluster 4 tumors vs. other clusters (p < 0.023, ). When comparing this clustering result with that based on random sets of 150 pathways or the 150 pathways exhibiting the most variable scores, the above clustering results achieved the smallest within/between-cluster-variances ratio, indicating that it is not likely due to chance (p = 0; ; STAR Methods).\n\nStrikingly, these five proteomic clusters were validated in two independent cohorts (frozen validation and CPTAC-201619) and PDX models42 based on both supervised and unsupervised analyses ( – , S5A, and S5B; Table S5; STAR Methods).\n\nWe developed an MRM-based assay to quantify 29 proteotypic peptides representing 10 metabolic proteins that were upregulated in cluster 3 vs. other clusters (STAR Methods). We applied the MRM assay to 102 FFPE discovery cohort (all tumors with sufficient remaining sample material). For 8 of the 10 proteins, we obtained qualified MRM-based abundance measurements (Table S3), which confirmed the upregulation of all 8 metabolic protein markers in cluster 3 ( and ). These 8 proteins also showed higher abundances in cluster 3 vs. other clusters in the independent CPTAC-2016 cohort19 ( ). Moreover, we utilized the average abundances (Z scores) of the 8 proteins in the MRM data as a classifier and obtained an ROC-AUC of 0.84 for identifying cluster 3 tumors ( ).\n\nComparison with other clustering results\n\nWhile our gene-level “RNA-seq” data replicate the subtypes reported by TCGA20 and others52 (Figure S4G; STAR Methods), the 5 “protein-based” clusters were distinct from the “RNA”-based subtypes (Figure S4F). This is consistent with previous studies53–55 reporting different results for transcriptomic- vs. proteomic-based pathway activities, likely because proteomic data capture post-transcriptional patterns invisible to RNA-seq data. Indeed, based on our FFPE discovery cohort, proteomic and transcriptomic pathway scores showed low correlation for many pathways ( ), especially metabolic pathways, suggesting extensive post-transcriptional regulation. Consequently, performing consensus clustering based on the RNA-seq vs. protein pathway data results in very different clusters (Figures S4F and S4H; STAR Methods).\n\nPathway-based clustering resulted in better separation of tumor clusters vs. protein-based analysis, as shown by significantly lower within/between variances based on pathway activity scores (Figure S4E; STAR Methods). Moreover, individual protein-based results failed to reproduce across validation datasets (Figure S5E), while pathway-based analysis results in more stable/meaningful clusters, consistent with recent literature.56\n\nImmune infiltration\n\nTo characterize the tumor microenvironment, we analyzed global proteomic and RNA-seq profiles (FFPE discovery cohort) using two deconvolution methods, XDec57 and BayesDebulk58 (STAR Methods). The estimated proportions of major cell types showed large variation across the 5 tumor clusters ( and S6C; Table S6). We observed the highest proportion of epithelial cells in cluster 1 tumors, and increased proportions of stromal cells (fibroblast, adipose) in cluster 2 and 4 tumors. High immune infiltration in cluster 5 was supported by high abundance of CD4, CD8A, and several HLA complex proteins. To verify these computational observations, we performed a blinded pathological review of a subset of the samples (STAR Methods) and found that the pathologist’s estimated proportions of epithelial, stromal, and immune cells showed good concordance with the computational results (Figure S6A). Additionally, multiplex in situ analysis using a fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) panel for immune cell markers (CD8, CD4, and CCR5) validated the inferred percentage of CD8+ T cells and macrophage from BayesDebulk58 (Figure S6B; STAR Methods).\n\nWe observed significantly higher immune infiltration in the cluster 5 refractory vs. cluster 5 sensitive tumors (Wilcoxon test p = 0.015, ). The frozen validation cohort showed a similar trend ( and S6D; STAR Methods). Investigation of specific immune cell types (inferred by BayesDebulk) suggested higher CD8 T cell (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.02) and macrophage (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.04) infiltration in the cluster 5 refractory vs. sensitive tumors ( ). Additionally, IHC data confirmed that the “cluster 5” refractory tumors had significantly higher percentages of cells with positive CD8, CD4, and CCR5 stains vs. cluster 5 sensitive tumors (Wilcoxon test, p < 0.01, ). shows substantial staining of CD8, CD4, and CCR5 in a refractory tumor sample, while limited staining of these IHC markers can be seen in a sensitive tumor sample.\n\nIt has been reported that CD8+ T cell infiltration predicts response to immunotherapy in multiple cancers.59–61 We evaluated an anti-PD1 response signature62 in cluster 5 tumors (Table S6). This signature was identified using a pan-cancer approach (9,282 patients of 31 different histologies) and has been shown to predict favorable response to PD-L1/PD1 checkpoint inhibitors. We observed a higher (p = 0.02) antiPD1 response signature in the cluster 5 refractory vs. sensitive tumors ( ). Note, some genes in the signature are related to immune cells, so changes of this signature were likely driven both by cell-type composition differences as well as molecular changes within the same type of cells. These observations suggest that this subset of tumors might respond to immunotherapy.\n\nBy studying the protein co-expression network in refractory tumors, we identified a module of highly correlated proteins containing T cell markers, e.g., CD8A, CD7, and CD3D (Figure S6G; STAR Methods). There was a trend toward increased abundance of proteins in this module in cluster 5 refractory vs. sensitive tumors (Wilcoxon test p = 0.083; ). This same trend also occurred in the frozen validation cohort (Wilcoxon test p = 0.085; ). Leveraging a published ovarian tumor single-cell RNA-seq dataset,63 we were able to annotate most genes in the module as T cell and macrophage markers (Figure S6E; STAR Methods), consistent with increased T cell and macrophage infiltration in cluster 5 refractory tumors ( and ). The most connected protein in this cluster (hub-protein) was SLAMF6, a regulator of exhausted CD8 T cells.64,65 Based on single-cell RNA data,63SLAMF6 is preferentially expressed in CD8T cells vs. other cell types (Figure S6F; STAR Methods), suggesting that SLAMF6 may play a role in immune regulation in some HGSOCs.\n\nAssociation of TGF-β, alt-EJ, and βAlt signatures with cluster and response\n\nAmong the pathways overexpressed in refractory HGSOCs ( ), the TGF-β signaling pathway was of interest due to its role in cancer development66–69 and as a therapeutic target.70–72 An inverse correlation between TGF-β and alt-EJ gene expression signatures across tumor types has been reported.73–75 Importantly, for tumors with low TGF-β and high alt-EJ gene expression (i.e., high “βAlt score”), clinical outcomes were better.73,74 We observed similar inverse correlations between TGF-β and alt-EJ gene signatures at both the RNA and proteome levels in four independent cohorts ( ). We also observed that the TGF-β, alt-EJ, and βAlt scores significantly differ among tumors assigned to different protein-based clusters ( ; STAR Methods). TGF-β scores were higher in clusters 4 and 5, while alt-EJ scores were higher in clusters 1 and 2. The RNA-seq data suggested similar trends, although the correlation was less significant (Figure S7A). Similar associations between the TGF-β, alt-EJ, βAlt scores and clusters were seen in two independent validation cohorts (Figures S7B and S7C).\n\nBidirectional regulatory loops between TGF-β, proteolytic activity, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression levels have been associated with increased migration, invasion, and EMT.76–79 To evaluate the possibility that MMP activity is related to TGF-β in our cohorts, we identified peptides resulting from proteases other than trypsin (STAR Methods) to serve as a surrogate phenotype for non-tryptic protease activity.66 When we calculated the semi- and non-tryptic median ratios for each tumor (STAR Methods), these ratios were elevated in clusters 4 and 5 (FFPE discovery cohort) ( ). This finding was validated in the frozen validation cohort ( ). Some non-tryptic peptides (79 in the FFPE discovery and 185 in the frozen validation cohort) that showed extremely high ratios belonged to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins ( right and 7D right; Table S7), consistent with increased MMP activity. The postulated increase in non-tryptic enzymatic activity was also supported by the increased protein abundances of several MMPs and TGF-β in cluster 4 and 5 tumors (Figure S7D).\n\nInterestingly, further comparison between the TGF-β, alt-EJ, and βAlt scores and treatment response within each sample cluster revealed elevated TGF-β scores ( ; p = 0.038) and lower βAlt scores (Figure S7E; p = 0.029) in refractory vs. sensitive tumors in cluster 4. These trends were also seen in an independent validation dataset (Figure S7F). In addition, we observed that the EMT pathway score was significantly higher in cluster 4 refractory vs. sensitive tumors (p = 0.04, , right). The abundances of the non-tryptic peptides enriched in ECM-related proteins (Table S7) showed a similar trend of upregulation in cluster 4 refractory tumors (Figure S7G). Collectively, these observations suggest that MMPs and TGF-β may have increased activity in cluster 4 refractory samples, motivating the hypothesis that these tumors may respond to therapeutic agents targeting TGF-β activity.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nImplications of the results for precision oncology\n\nDespite >3 decades of research on platinum responses in cancer,17 no predictive biomarker has been translated into clinical use. Predictors of refractory disease could enable a precision oncology approach and provide a means to select patients for clinical trials to identify and implement effective therapies.\n\nIn this study, we leveraged technological advances (e.g., LC-MS/MS-based multiplex protein quantification, machine learning algorithms) to employ an approach integrating: (1) decades of studies reporting single-analyte biomarker candidates,17 (2) proteogenomic analyses for dynamic profiling of pre-clinical models,42 and (3) proteogenomic analyses of human HGSOCs to identify an ensemble prediction model of chemo-refractoriness based on 64 proteins. The 64-protein prediction model detects a subset of ~35% refractory tumors with high (98%) specificity and is validated in 2 independent patient cohorts ( ).\n\nFurther validation of the 64-protein prediction model in clinical trials requires development of a higher throughput, clinical-grade, multiplexed assay, which is currently underway (Figure S3G) using a clinically translatable platform based on MRM-MS.80–82 Once mature, the assay will be evaluated for performance as a multi-protein panel, which may be algorithmically integrated to generate a single parameter, or score, tied to the likelihood of the patient having chemo-resistant disease (e.g., similar to the way that Oncotype DX83 provides the likelihood of recurrence of breast cancer). Similarly, data from our proteomic signature, evaluation of Chr17-LOH, and the identification of BRCA mutations could be combined into a single output for interpretation by a practicing pathologist. A current example in the clinical laboratory lies in the combination of LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of amyloidosis samples with histology, germline genetic mutations, and clinical history in the rendering of a diagnosis by the pathologist.84,85 Prior to full clinical deployment, validation of this classifier will need to be performed in additional retrospective and prospective studies, but the data from this study suggest that variability in study site and preanalytical processing procedure had limited effects on the resulting proteomic data, suggesting that the quantitative measurements will be robust in future evaluations.\n\nWe identified 5 subtypes of HGSOC (replicated in independent patient cohorts and PDX models; ) based on pathway protein expression ( ), possibly reflecting different mechanisms of refractoriness and implicating potential subtype-specific treatment approaches (e.g., immune therapies, TGF-β inhibitors, and metabolic inhibitors). In support of the hypothesis that these subtypes might predict therapeutic vulnerabilities, we demonstrated42 that a treatment-refractory HGSOC PDX model and cell line mapping to cluster 3 and showing upregulation of pathway “group 6” (metabolism, Figure S5C) are sensitized to platinum-based therapy either through pharmacological inhibition (Figure S5D) and/or CRISPR knockout42 of CPT1A, which catalyzes a rate limiting step in fatty acid oxidation. This motivates a hypothesis that refractory tumors in cluster 3 might respond to the addition of drugs targeting metabolic processes and sets the stage for further mechanistic studies, as well as additional in vivo studies to test other possible therapeutic vulnerabilities identified by our data (e.g., immune therapies and TGF-β inhibitors).\n\nStrengths of this study\n\nStrengths of this study include the (1) rigorous definition of refractory disease, requiring objective radiographic progression, (2) inclusion of two independent validation cohorts (and leveraging of two additional, independent published cohorts), in which major findings are confirmed, (3) multi-institutional design with inclusion of samples from 4 academic centers, making the results likely to be generalizable beyond this study, (4) retrospective study design enabling access to clinical responses and enrichment for chemo-refractory tumors, and (5) use of FFPE tissues, which should facilitate clinical validation studies and general applicability.\n\nLimitations of this study\n\nFirst, the sample size (242 tumors) was insufficient to fully capture the complexity of the heterogeneous mechanisms underlying chemo-response.17 Although the 64-protein predictor model detects a subset (~35%) of refractory tumors with high (98%) specificity, other refractory tumors are not detected. Although the current predictor will need to be refined in a larger study to predict 100% of refractory cases, this study (1) lays out a road map and justification for an expanded study and (2) reports a current predictor that if clinically validated would be a game changer for the 35% of patients with refractory disease who could avoid ineffective chemotherapy. Second, the reliance on archival FFPE biospecimens (vs. frozen) makes genomic profiling challenging and results in a reduced ability to study post-translational modifications. Regardless, we detected a panel of phosphosites predictive of refractoriness using the FFPE phospho-proteomic data (Figures S3E and S3F), suggesting that some clinically relevant signals may be preserved in archival tissues. Third, the lack of germline DNA presents challenges to calling somatic mutations. Fourth, although bulk profiling of cancer tissues has led to many advances, tumor heterogeneity is a complication. Although we employed pathological review, IHC, and deconvolution analyses to address heterogeneity, spatially resolved proteogenomics may add value.\n\nSTAR★METHODS\n\nRESOURCE AVAILABILITY\n\nLead contact\n\nFurther information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to the lead contact, Amanda Paulovich (gro.hctuhderf@ivoluapa).\n\nMaterials availability\n\nThis study did not generate new unique reagents.\n\nData and code availability\n\nRaw proteomic data files and all processed proteogenomic datasets as well as clinical meta information have been deposited at the Proteomic Data Commons and are publicly available as of the date of this publication.

URLs for this repository and for other code used in this study are listed in the .\n\nAny additional information required to reanalyze the data reported in this paper is available from the lead contact upon request.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND STUDY PARTICIPANT DETAILS\n\nPatient Selection and Cohorts\n\nTreatment-naive tissue specimens from Stage III or IV HGSOCs that underwent primary debulking followed by platinum/taxane adjuvant therapy were selected for the study and categorized with respect to response to adjuvant chemotherapy, as defined below. (After the profiling was completed, we learned that a subset of 13 tumors had undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and these are annotated in Table S1. These samples were not included in the construction and evaluation of the prediction model, and neoadjuvant status was included as a covariate in other analyses.)\n\nRefractory tumors were defined as follows: After primary debulking: for R0 disease (no residual/microscopic disease after primary resection), radiographically detectable disease must have been present at the end of 6 cycles of initial platinum/taxane therapy; for R1 disease (radiographically detectable residual disease is present after primary resection), residual disease must either progress or stay stable (radiographically) after 6 cycles of initial platinum/taxane therapy.\n\nSensitive tumors were defined by R1 or R2 disease that received primary resection followed by platinum/taxane adjuvant therapy and had a progression-free survival of at least 2 years (no R0 disease).\n\nAll biospecimens were collected with Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals: the Mayo Clinic IRB numbers: 08–005749 and 17–010405; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center IRB number 4563; University of Alabama at Birmingham IRB number 131007005; and MD Anderson Cancer Center IRB number 131007005.\n\nThe FFPE Discovery cohort consisted of 158 HGOC tissue biopsies (91 sensitive and 67 refractory) from three institutes. The FFPE Validation cohort consists of 20 HGSOC tumors from MD Anderson Cancer Center, an independent set of patients representing 10 sensitive and 10 refractory cases. The Frozen Validation cohort consists of 64 HGSOC tumors (44 sensitive, 20 refractory) from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. And 29 of these 64 tumors were from overlapping patients from the FFPE Discovery cohort.\n\nIn addition to the validation cohorts from this study, two published ovarian cancer datasets were also used as independent cohorts for validating findings: (i) Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK)-IMPACT18 and (ii) the National Cancer Institute’s Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium’s 2016 study (“CPTAC-2016”).19\n\nOvarian Cancer Tissues\n\n10 μm sections of the FFPE samples were cut using a microtome and mounted on glass slides (Leica Biosystems Cat# 3800040). The first and last “bookend” sections were 4 μm H&E sections for pathology review. Digital images of the H&E slides were recorded using a ScanScope AT Slide Scanner (Leica Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA, USA) under 20X objective magnification (0.5 μm resolution). Tissue sub-compartment cellularity was reported by a pathologist using the HALO Image Analysis Platform (Indica Labs, NM, USA). Follow-up multiplexed IHC analysis was performed on a subset of the FFPE samples from four 4 μm sections prepared as above.\n\nMETHOD DETAILS\n\nWhole Genome and RNA Sequencing of FFPE Samples\n\nSample Processing\n\nSamples were processed as follows: the protocol adapted from QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE Kit 80234, QIAamp® DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (56404) and miRNeasy FFPE kit (217504). This protocol is optimized for 150–250 mm2 10-μm sections. All isolations were performed under RNase-free working environment. De-paraffination and re-hydration was performed using Xylene and ethanol as per standard protocols. Tissue was lysed in buffer PKD as per manufacturer’s recommendations. The supernatant was processed for RNA and the pellet for DNA (after Protein K digestion and using QIAamp MinElute spin column). All nucleic acids were quantified by 260/280 determination.\n\nRNA Sequencing Library Preparation\n\nPurified total RNA samples were evaluated for quantity and quality by calculating the percent DV200 with an Agilent Fragment Analyzer RNA kit and reagents (Cat# DNF-471–1000). Samples with <100 ng of RNA and DV200 < 30% were excluded from the study. Sequencing libraries were prepared using Kapa RNA HyperPrep with RiboErase (Cat# KK8561) from 100 ng of RNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n\nWhole Genome Library Preparation\n\nPurified gDNA was quantified by Qubit Fluorometer and sheared to 300 bp using a Covaris M220. Sequencing libraries were prepared using Swift Biosciences Accel-NGS S2 DNA prep reagents (Cat# 210384) from 100 ng of DNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n\nNext-Generation Sequencing\n\nThe finished libraries were quantified by Qubit fluorometer, Agilent TapeStation 2200 D1000 screentape (Cat# 5067–5582), and RT-qPCR using the Roche Kapa Biosystems library quantification kit (Cat# KK4854) according to manufacturers’ protocols. Whole genome libraries were sequenced with >400M 150 bp read pairs and RNAseq libraries (Ribo-Erase) were sequenced with >50M 100 bp read pairs on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 by the Molecular Biology Core Facilities at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.\n\nWhole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Data Preprocessing and QC\n\nWGS Data Processing and Alignment\n\nAll genomic data processing has been performed using the TPO workflow (https://github.com/mctp/tpo), which implements standardized pipelines for the analysis of DNA and RNA sequencing data.\n\nDNA sequencing paired-end reads were trimmed from adapter sequences using BBMap’s bbduk tool with parameters ‘ktrim=r k=23 mink=11 hdist=1 ignorebadquality=t qin=33 tpe tbo’.125 Sequencing data were aligned to the GRCh38 reference (GRCh38.d1.vd1), according to the functional equivalence standards126 and BWA-mem101 (version 0.7.17-r1188) settings ‘-Y -K 10000000’. The alignments were sorted using Sentieon tools sort, which is equivalent to samtools sort.127 Alignment statistics have been collected using the algorithms MeanQualityByCycle, QualDistribution, GCBias, AlignmentStat, and InsertSize MetricAlgo. Following sorting we followed GATK best-practices, including indel realignment, base quality score recalibration (using algorithmsRealigner and QualCal, respectively), settings ‘-k ‘DBsnp all variants 20180418’, and the ‘known_indels’ and ‘Mills_indels’ from the GATK resource bundle. The resulting alignments were genotyped at common heterozygous SNPs (DNAscope gVCF typing) and all samples from the same individual were verified to have matching genotypes ‘tpo/refs/grch38/custom/genotype_positions_hg38.bed’. Duplicates were removed using Sentieon LocusCollector and Dedup. Since the sequencing was performed on a Novaseq an optical duplicate threshold of 2500 was used to mark ExAmp duplicates ‘--optical_dup_pix_dist 2500’.\n\nWGS Data QC\n\nFor the QC of WGS data, we derived multiple quality control measures, such as GC BIAS or duplication percentage, and confirmed that average qualities are not significantly different between the compared clinical patient subsets (Figure S1J). Downstream copy-number analysis factored DNA data quality directly into the procedure of segmentation and inference to minimize the influence of data quality on sensitivity and recall.\n\nWGS Data Variant/Mutation Calling\n\nTumor-only somatic variant calling has been performed using TNScope, which is a modified version of GATK3 MuTect2 algorithm, with the following settings ‘--max_fisher_pv_active 0.05 --min_tumor_allele_frac 0.0075 --min_init_tumor_lod 2.5 --assemble_mode 4 --trim_soft_clip’ and ‘--dbsnp homo_sapiens_assembly38.dbsnp138.vcf.gz’, which is included in the TPO resource bundle.\n\nSpecifically, the ‘trim_soft_clip’ parameter reduces the number FFPE-induced artifacts. Multi-nucleotide variants were merged based on phasing information using an inhouse script ‘tpo/pipe/carat-anno/carat_mnv.R’. The resulting variants were first filtered to protein coding regions (based on Ensemble 97), annotated using VEP,116 and further annotated with vcfAnno,117 using the following sets of parameters: ‘--assembly GRCh38 --species homo_sapiens --cache_version 97 --format vcf --gene_phenotype --symbol --canonical --ccds --hgvs --biotype --tsl --uniprot --domains --appris --protein --variant_class --sift b, --polyphen b --no_stats --total_length --allele_number --no_escape --flag_pick_allele --pick_order canonical,tsl,biotype,rank,ccds,length --buffer_size 20000’. For vcfAnno multiple sources of annotations were used including:\n\nGDC Panel-of-Normal v4136 based on MuTect2\n\n1000 Genomes phase3 variants\n\nGnomAD exomes r301\n\nGnomAD exomes r221\n\nClinVar release Dec. 2019\n\nCosmic v87\n\ndbSNP release 20180418\n\nUniProt release Dec. 2019\n\nThe resulting annotated variants were subsequently filtered to select for likely somatic and pathogenic variants based on automated rules, gene-specific threshold, and manual filters. We applied filters based on sequencing evidence (variant allele frequency, coverage, mutation likelihood TLOD, strand bias, allele depth, multi-allelic variants), and overlap in problematic regions including regions with low-mappability and repetitive sequence as well as homopolymer repeats. In addition, all long indels (>20 bp) were removed, as these were significantly enriched in this data due to the low quality of the input DNA. All called variants in genes known to be recurrently mutated in HGSOC identified based on COSMIC and literature, were manually reviewed, according to a procedure following applicable recommendations in Barnell et al.128\n\nTumor Mutation Burden\n\nThe tumor mutation burden was determined for each sample by counting the number of genes that have any type of mutations. The mutation call was first determined for each gene by the above pipeline, and then for a subset of known cancer driving genes the mutation call went through additional manual check. For subjects with multiple DNA samples, the mutation of a gene was called if it was observed in any DNA sample.\n\nCNV Analysis\n\nCopy-number analysis on the tumor DNA was performed by using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) coverage data and variant calls (see above). To perform the analysis, we used CNVEX (https://github.com/mctp/cnvex), a comprehensive copy number analysis tool that has been used previously in our ccRCC studies.55 CNVEX uses whole-genome aligned reads to estimate coverage within fixed genomic intervals and variant calls to compute B-allele frequencies (BAFs) at variant positions (as characterized above). Coverages were computed in 10 kb bins, and the resulting log coverage ratios between tumor and normal samples were adjusted for GC bias using weighted LOESS smoothing across mappable and non-blacklisted genomic intervals within the GC range 0.3–0.7, with a span of 0.5 (all target and configuration files are provided within the CNVEX repository). The adjusted log coverage-ratios (LR) and BAFs were jointly segmented by a custom algorithm based on Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS). Alternative probabilistic algorithms were implemented in CNVEX, including algorithms based on recursive binary segmentation (RBS),129 and dynamic programming,130 as implemented in the R-package jointseg.131 For the CBS-based algorithm, first LR and mirrored BAF were independently segmented using CBS (parameters alpha=0.01, trim=0.025) and all candidate breakpoints collected.\n\nThe resulting segmentation track was iteratively “pruned” by merging segments that had similar LR and BAFs, short lengths, enrichment in blacklisted regions, and a high variation in coverage among whole cohort germline samples. For the RBS- and DP-based algorithms, joint-break-points were “pruned” using a statistical model selection method.132 For the final set of CNV segments, we chose the CBS-based results because they did not require specifying a prior number of expected segments (K) per chromosome arm, were robust to unequal variances between the LR and BAF tracks and provided empirically the best fit to the underlying data. Given the relatively high variance of the sequencing data, we noticed that some samples were over-segmented using the default settings. To adjust the segmentation algorithm to the variance of each sample individually, we performed an adaptive procedure of pruning. Default pruning: Perform pruning as described above for all samples. Strict pruning: Count the number of segments for each sample, take the samples with the top 20 percentile number of segments and perform pruning with stricter parameters. Relaxed pruning: Take the samples with the lowest 20 percentile number of segments and perform more loose pruning on them. The above procedure was repeated two times, effectively adjusting segmentation pruning parameters to the noise-level of each sample. The quality of the resulting segmentations was manually evaluated.\n\nThe resulting segmented copy-number profiles were then subject to joint inference of tumor purity and ploidy and absolute copy number states, implemented in CNVEX, which is most similar to the mathematical formalism of ABSOLUTE28 and PureCN.133 Briefly, the algorithm inputs the observed log-ratios (of 10 kb bins) and BAFs of individual SNPs. LRs and BAFs were assigned to their joint segments and their likelihood is determined given a particular purity, ploidy, absolute segment copy number, and number of minor alleles. To identify candidate combinations with a high likelihood, we followed a multi-step optimization procedure that includes gridsearch across purity-ploidy combinations, greedy optimization of absolute copy numbers, and maximum-likelihood inferences of minor allele counts. Following optimization, CNVEX ranked candidate solutions. Because the copy-number inference problem can have multiple equally likely solutions, further biological insights were necessary to choose the most parsimonious result. The solutions were reviewed by independent analysts following a set of guidelines. Solutions implying whole-genome duplication were supported by at least one large segment that cannot be explained by a low-ploidy solution, inferred purity was consistent with the variant-allele-frequencies of somatic mutations, and large homozygous segments were not allowed.\n\nAfter selecting the best solution for purity/ploidy of a sample, we then used the method explained in PureCN133 to assign total absolute CN to each CNV segment using LR values. Purity and ploidy estimates also allowed us to use BAF values for calculating the absolute copy number for each allele. We then used the copy number of minor allele to detect LOH for each segment. Any segment that had a minor allele copy number of 0, was considered to harbor an LOH event.\n\nChr17-LOH Calling\n\nTo call samples with Chr17LOH, we used the same method mentioned above to call LOH for all the segments on chr17. Samples that had <25% of their chr17 covered with LOH segments were called chr17HET. Any other samples were placed in the chr17LOH group.\n\nMSK-IMPACT LOH Analysis\n\nTo validate the results of our chr17LOH, CNV data from MSK-IMPACT18 (997 patients) was used. Because the LOH values were not provided for this cohort, we used the LogRatio values as a surrogate. In our"
