        "text": "Amy Lee\n\nEarly life and education\n\nAmy Lee was born in Riverside, California to parents John Lee, a disc jockey and TV personality, and Sara Cargill. She has a brother named Robby and two sisters, Carrie and Lori. There is a rumor that Lee had a younger sister who died in 1987 at the age of three from an unidentified illness.The song “Hello” from Fallen has been reported to have been written for her late sister, as well as the song “Like You” from The Open Door. Lee took classical piano lessons for nine years. Her family moved to many places, including West Palm Beach, Florida[and Rockford, Illinois, and eventually settled in Little Rock, Arkansas, where Evanescence started. Lee graduated from Pulaski Academy, a private school in Little Rock, in 2000. She briefly attended Middle Tennessee State Universityin Murfreesboro to study music theory and composition in 2000 but dropped out to focus on Evanescence.[17]\n\nIn an interview on AOL Music, Lee said that the first songs she remembered writing were called “Eternity of the Remorse” and “A Single Tear”. The first was written when she was eleven years old and wanted to become a classical composer, and the second was for an assignment when she was in the eighth grade\n\nEvanescence\n\nFounding\n\nLee co-founded the rock band Evanescence with guitarist Ben Moody. The two met at a youth camp after Moody heard Lee playing Meat Loaf‘s “I’d Do Anything for Love (But I Won’t Do That)” on the piano. Within a month, the pair were playing acoustic sets at Arkansas book stores and coffee houses,and they eventually recorded two EPs, Evanescence EP (1998) and Sound Asleep EP (1999), selling them at various local venues. In 2000, Evanescence recorded the longer EP Origin. This demo contains three songs from the debut album Fallen and was written by Lee and Moody: “Whisper”, “Imaginary” and “My Immortal“. Whereas “Whisper” and “Imaginary” were altered before being included on Fallen, “My Immortal” is virtually unchanged, apart from additional string arrangements. A later band version of “My Immortal” was made available for download for those who had bought an official version of Fallen through their web site, but required that a CD checker program also be downloaded for verification before it would play.[21] The band version was included on later copies ofFallen, notably the Brazilian, Bolivian, and Argentine editions.\n\nOn October 22, 2003, Moody left the band citing “creative differences”. In an interview several months later, Amy said: “…we’d gotten to a point that if something didn’t change, we wouldn’t have been able to make a second record”. She also said “We’re finally a real band, not just Ben and I and a few others thrown together”.Ex-Cold guitarist Terry Balsamo replaced Moody in the band, both on guitar and as Lee’s writing partner.\n\nAnette Olzon\n\nEarly life\n\nOlzon was raised in a musical family and has been singing since childhood. Her mother also forced her to play the oboe for 8 years. She toured with her mother’s band and sang with them on some occasions. Later, she started to take part in various talent shows and received laudable recognition.[2] The first band she joined at seventeen years of age (Take Cover) was a cover band. However, it was short-lived as she took part in several bands and projects. At twenty-one, she played the leading role in the rock opera/musical “Gränsland” in Helsingborg. After that she got into the Balettakademien in Gothenburg. She sang in choirs, did studio work for various projects and occasionally performed as a wedding singer. Anette also sang a duet with Michael Bormann (ex-Jaded Heart singer) on his album Conspiracy.\n\nIn her earlier days, Olzon took singing lessons at the Copenhagen Music Conservatorie, in Helsingør, Denmark with a private teacher. Nowadays, she takes lessons from a private teacher at the Malmö Music University when needed.\n\nCareer\n\nWith Alyson Avenue (1999–2005)\n\nOlzon then joined Alyson Avenue, at first only as a studio singer, but later as their leading lady, replacing the male vocalist. The band received huge feedback for a demo they sent out in 1999, and Alyson Avenue was soon able to contact various labels. Main composer and keyboardist Niclas Olsson gathered the band, recording a four track demo which resulted in a record deal with AOR Heaven.\n\nIn November 2000, debut album Presence of Mind was released to positive reviews.[3] The next album Omega was released in 2004. Anette left Alyson Avenue in 2006. In May 2009, Alyson Avenue introduced Arabella Vitanc as their new lead vocalist.\n\nWith Nightwish (2007–2012)\n\nOlzon officially joined Nightwish as their new lead singer in early 2007, chosen from about 2,000 applicants of which 10 made it to prove their place in front of the band. The song on her demo tape was the 2002 single “Ever Dream”. She replaced the previous singer Tarja Turunen, who was fired in an open letter in the autumn of 2005. Olzon’s demo was one of the first that Nightwish received, although she was originally denied the position, as band leader Tuomas Holopainen was concerned about the fact that she had a young son. However, Olzon was persistent and sent the band a live DVD of her performing with Alyson Avenue. She was then contacted by Nightwish’s manager Ewo Pohjola, which eventually led to her taking up the position in February 2007. Tuomas commented on her selection saying “we (the band) took a formal vote, but it was unanimous that she would be the one. It was a matter of heart. We felt she was right.” Her identity was kept secret by various methods, including pretending to be Ewo’s “Swedish cousin” at a Tarot concert, until she was eventually announced as the new Nightwish singer on 24 May 2007.\n\nThe day after this revelation, 25 May 2007, charity single “Eva” was released as the first off the album, as download only. It was originally scheduled for release on 30 May but this was changed due to a leak on a British music download site. This was the first published song to feature Olzon. On 13 June Nightwish released the title, Dark Passion Play, and artwork to the new album on their official website, as well as the name and the cover of the second single (this time CD), “Amaranth“. “Amaranth” achieved gold status in Finland after less than two days in stores.\n\nDark Passion Play was released around Europe in the last week of September 2007, in the UK on October 1 and the United States on October 2. It was awarded double platinum in Finland the second day after its release and took the No.1 position on the charts of Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Hungary and Croatia and got in top 100 in other 16 countries, including the United States. Dark Passion Play has sold 6x Platinum worldwide up to date (over 1.5 million copies).\n\nIn October 2010, Nightwish began recording for the album Imaginaerum, with Olzon recording her vocals for the album in April 2011 at Finnvox Studios, Helsinki. The album was released on 30 November 2011 and was followed by the Imaginaerum World Tour, beginning on 21 January 2012. Olzon, along with the rest of Nightwish, starred in the film Imaginaerum, which featured music from the band.[11]\n\nOn 1 October 2012, Nightwish and Olzon went their separate ways. Olzon’s final performance with Nightwish was on 29 September, at The Complex, Salt Lake City.\n\nSolo career, Shine (2012–present)\n\nFollowing her departure from Nightwish, Olzon began writing and recording material for a future solo album.In an interview with ‘Dark Sirens’ in October 2013, Olzon stated that her solo album would be released sometime in 2014.\n\nIt was announced on 28 November 2013 that Olzon’s debut solo album will be called Shine. The album has been produced by Stefan Örn and Johan Glössner and co-produced by Olzon and Johan Kronlund. About the album, Olzon said:\n\n“The overall message of the album is that life can be really dark and filled with hardship and sadness, but you can always choose to see some light coming through, to make you stronger and full of life – making you SHINE… no matter what.”\n\nOlzon described the album’s musical direction as “a pop rock album maybe, or would you call it pop metal?”. On the January 27th, Anette announced that the release date for her album had been pushed a month, making the new release date 28 March 2014\n\nThe first song from Shine, “Falling”, was released for digital download on 17 December 2013 along with a lyric video on YouTube. A teaser for the album’s first official single,“Lies”, was posted on Anette Olzon’s official Facebook page on 7 February 2014; followed by the single’s eventual release on 14th February 2014.\n\nCristina Scabbia\n\nCristina Adriana Chiara Scabbia (Italian pronunciation: [krisˈtiːna adriˈaːna ˈkjaːra ˈskabbja]; born 6 June 1972) is an Italian singer and lyricist, best known as one of the two vocalists in the Italian Gothic metal band Lacuna Coil. She also writes an advice column in the popular rock magazine Revolver, alongside musician Vinnie Paul. Scabbia is featured in a Megadeth song, “À Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)“. She is also the featured artist in the Apocalyptica song “S.O.S. (Anything But Love)” and another version of the Alter Bridge song “Watch Over You“. Scabbia has said that the biggest compliment that a fan could pay her would be to remark on her vocal abilities. Her highest note ever hit is claimed to be an A7. Scabbia performed a duet with the Italian ex-singer of Linea 77 Emiliano Audisio on the track “Beautiful Lie” to be part of the soundtrack for the 2013 Italian film Passione sinistra.\n\nLacuna Coil\n\nIn 1991, Scabbia began singing professionally as a touring musician for other bands and providing backing vocals. Later that year, she met the male vocalist Andrea Ferro and bass player Marco Coti Zelati of Lacuna Coil in Milan‘s Midnight club. At the time, the band was named Ethereal, and Scabbia was first employed only as a session singer. She was employed to record backup vocals for the choruses of songs on their demo tape, but the band members liked the way the male and female vocals sounded together, and asked her to be a permanent member.After several changes in the band’s line-up, the members were reduced to Ferro, Coti Zelati and Scabbia. The members recorded a two track demo in May 1996, and were soon signed by the German branch of Century Media, eventually joining with the American branch of the label. Once signed, the band changed their name to Lacuna Coil after learning that a Greek band signed to Century Media had already claimed the name Ethereal. Adding new band members, Lacuna Coil began to tour, releasing their first album in 1997.\n\nFloor Jansen\n\nFloor Jansen (pronounced [flɔr ˈjɑnsɛn]; born 21 February 1981 in Goirle) is a Dutch singer and songwriter. She is a classically trained dramatic soprano, and sings in the styles of rock and heavy metal such as symphonic, progressive and power metal. She also has the versatility to sing operatic and belt as well as growls, aggressive and harsh vocals. She is the current lead vocalist of the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish and the Dutch progressive metal band ReVamp.\n\nJansen had been the lead vocalist of symphonic metal band After Forever that she joined in 1997. After they disbanded in 2009, she created ReVamp and released two albums with the band. In 2012 following the departure of their lead vocalist Anette Olzon, Nightwish replaced her with Jansen as a session member until the end of their Imaginaerum World Tour. In 2013 the band announced her as their now full-time lead vocalist.\n\nShe is also a member of progressive metal supergroup Star One, and sang in Ayreon albums Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer and 01011001. She is the older sister of fellow singer Irene Jansen.\n\nBiography\n\nAfter Forever (1997–2009)\n\nJansen was sixteen when she joined Apocalypse (the name of the band After Forever in its early days) in 1997. Three years later the band released its first album, Prison of Desire. Her ability to sing both classical and rock music has made her reasonably popular in the metal scene. She took sole charge of After Forever’s lyrics and vocal melodies since the departure of Mark Jansen (no relation) in 2002.[1] Prior to this, up until the Decipher (2001) album, the two would write together.\n\nJansen started studying music at the Dutch Rock Academy in 1999 and entered the conservatory three years later. She studied musical theatreand one year of opera. Later, she started teaching performing in her own course called Wanna be a Star?!.\n\nJansen plays the guitar, piano and flute and has completed several years of music studies.\n\nThree albums by the Dutch composer and multi-instrumentalist Arjen Anthony Lucassen include guest vocals from Jansen. She sang one song onUniversal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer, made a number of contributions to the Star One project and plays the character Ω in the Ayreonalbum 01011001. She is the older sister of fellow singer and Ayreon guest vocalist Irene Jansen, who played “Passion” on The Human Equation. She has also been a guest for the metal band Nightmare.\n\nReVamp (2009–present)\n\nBecause of the burnout that After Forever band mate Sander Gommans underwent, the band took a year off starting in January 2008 but ultimately decided to call it quits in February 2009. Jansen posted on her website, that while After Forever was on hold (and since then disbanded), she would use this opportunity to start writing music with Jørn Viggo Lofstad (no) (Pagan’s Mind, Jørn Lande) for a new musical project. On 16 June 2009, Jansen announced through her MySpace site, that she had started a new metal band, which has put the project called Sinh with Lofstad on hold.\n\nOn 17 October 2009, Jansen announced via MySpace, that the name of her new band was ReVamp. ReVamp’s first album was produced with After Forever keyboardist Joost van den Broek, bass player Jaap Melman (formerly of Dreadlock Pussy) and guitarist Waldemar Sorychta (Grip Inc., Voodoocult, and Eyes of Eden) as songwriters and producers. The current line-up of ReVamp features keybordist Ruben Wijga, bass player Jaap Melman, guitarists Jord Otto and Arjan Rijnen and drummer Matthias Landes.\n\nIn August 2011, Van Canto announced on Facebook, that ReVamp would no longer participate in their Out of the Dark tour, as Jansen suffered a burnout herself.\n\nIn late 2011, Jansen joined her former band mate in After Forever Mark Jansen for his band MaYan‘s Latin American tour, performing in São Paulo. In 2012, Jansen joined Adrenaline Mob on stage in Bochum and Weert. ReVamp’s second album, Wild Card, was released in 2013.\n\nNightwish (2012–present)\n\nAfter Nightwish’s previous lead vocalist Anette Olzon parted ways with the band, Jansen acted as Nightwish‘s live lead vocalist for the remainder of the Imaginaerum World Tour. On 9 October 2013, Jansen was announced as Olzon’s permanent replacement in the band."
