        "text": "Evanescence\n\nEvanescence, a band composed in 1995 by Amy Lee and Ben Moody, recorded their first album ‘Fallen’in 2003. One of the songs of this album was ‘my immortal.’ the song was written by Ben Moody, the guitarist of the band, and produced by Dave Fortman. The video was directed by David Mould and was completely shot in black and white in Barcelona. Fallen, in 2003, sold more than 15 million copies worldwide and helped them win two Grammies and seven nominations. The second recorded album, ‘the Open Door’, sold more than 5 million copies. Their final album, published in 2011, sold 127,000 copies in its first week.\n\nDavid Mould is one of the most prolific and worldwide respected music directors. He is currently working with 7ltd, a commercials film production company in London, UK. After a college degree in art, his passion for music and film brought him to shoot the music video for the rap band Cut 2 Kill. His next video was ‘Popscene’ for Blur with which his career started that in the last fifteen years, counts more than 100 music videos (Oasis, Kylie Minogue, Evanescence, Placebo, Robbie Williams.) In the last years, he started working as film commercials director. For example his projects include Honda, 888 and William Hill commercials.\n\nEvanescence are signed by the largest independently owned record label in the world, called Wind Up Records, based in New York City. It was formed in 1997 by Alan Meltzer, who previously owned CD One Stop. Wind-up Entertainment, the parent company, runs numerous publishing companies, retails, online and tour merchandising.\n\nSince September 2009, Wind-up Records reached an agreement with EMI Germany and EMI Canada; through this partnership, EMI is now responsible of production and distribution of Evanescence and other bands owned by Wind-up Records, outside of the United States.\n\nMusic video\n\n‘My Immortal’ is an interpretative music video because through certain elements of the mise en scene, cinematography and lighting, the visual aspects follow in depth the lyrics of the song. Amy Lee, the vocalist of the band, and Ben Moody, who was until 2003 the lead guitarist of the band, interprets the song and the way in which they are represented is deeply connected to the lyrics.\n\nIn the music video, for example, Amy and Ben are supposed to represent to completely different roles because as the lyrics suggests, Ben is the person that has been left behind while Amy is singing from heaven, and she is in fact represented as an angel.\n\nThroughout the video, she wears a fairy white dress, white bandages around her feet and hands, and flowers in her dark hair. The establishing shot portrays Amy’s foot, covered in bandages, slightly caressing the water of the fountain. She walks on the borders of it, stepping lightly on the concrete, as if she was trying to be part of the reality. Since the start of the video, Amy is shot mainly through close ups and over the head shots. The close ups emphasize her expression, slightly sad, while she sings the song and they also highlight her hands, reaching towards the ground, as though she wants to touch, to be part of the world she does not belong anymore. In fact, the lyrics of the song say:” ‘cause your presence still lingers here”. This suggests further that Amy’s presence is not real but for the person she has left behind, which is interpreted by Ben Moody in the video. The over the head shots are used to highlight Amy’s position, because throughout the whole video, she never touches the ground. She is on the top of a car, a roof, walks on the corners of a fountain and sits on the branches of a tree, but she does never put her feet on the ground. The chosen shots also accentuate her laying position, which reminds of a dead person and further suggests that she is gone and the memory other people have of her is the only thing left on earth.\n\nBen, on the opposite, is presented in a dark room, sitting on the piano stool, with his bare feet on the ground, which is opposite to Amy because she never touches the ground. He is wearing a black suit, white shirt and a black tie, which can be seen as an element of mourning, as if he just went to a funeral. The lyrics say ‘I am so tired of being alone’: Ben is portrayed through close ups and long shots, walking around Barcelona, with a sad expression on his face, looking around and especially up, towards the sky as though he was looking for the lost person close to him, which is emphasized by a worms’ eye view shot of the sky. Ben’s loneliness and emptiness is emphasized in this\n\nparticular sequence, because he can see that everyone else is going on and living their life, whilst he cannot. For example, in a medium shot that portrays Ben walking and looking up, a man on a bicycle, passes in front of him: this detail, as well as the wide shot on children playing ball games near the fountain, emphasize the continuance of life, in spite of pain and loss. While in the room, the shots chosen emphasize especially his emotions. For example, with the use of two subsequent close ups shot, the first one focused on his expression and the second one on his hands touching the key of the piano. As it can be seen from the screen caps, Ben’s head is rested on his arm, which is leaned on the piano, while he slightly touches the keys. The position conveys sadness and pain, as well as his sad eyes and expression. Later in the video, after his walk, he comes back to the room. Although he is portrayed in darker tonalities of black, Ben is surrounded by the strong light that comes from the window. Playing the piano, with his bare feet on the floor, the band is represented performing through the portieres. A wide shot presents the other members of the band, which are further portrayed through single medium and long shots. While the other members are portrayed stereotypically and follows rock conventions, Ben’s representation is completely opposite, because he is still resting on his arm, his hands on the piano, as though he was trying to cope and deal with the pain through the music."
