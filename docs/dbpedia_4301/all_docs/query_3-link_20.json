        "text": "Ben Moody predicts that his just-unveiled new band, We Are The Fallen, will enjoy a peaceful co-existence rather than mortal combat with his old group, Evanescence.\n\n“We wish them the best,” Moody, who co-founded Evanescence with singer Amy Lee in 1995 and left the band 2003 after co-writing its multi-platinum debut, “Fallen,” tells Billboard.com. He formed We Are The Fallen earlier this year with original Evanescence members John LeCompt on guitar and Rocky Gray on drums, adding bassist Marty O’Brien and “American Idol” Season 7 finalist Carly Smithson on vocals.\n\n“There’s not really an Evanescence now,” Moody adds. “It’s Amy Lee playing as Evanescence with a bunch of other guys hired to play our parts. And she’s amazing — an incredible front person, a great songwriter, an incredible singer. There’s no reason we can’t both exist in the world. Musically, we’re going in completely different directions; ‘The Open Door’ (Evanescence’s 2006 album) sounds nothing like We Are The Fallen.”\n\nAfter We Are The Fallen was unveiled, Lee issued a statement saying that “there’s some pretty weird stuff flying around right now” and that Evanescence is “working on new material that I’m extremely excited about…Look out for new music next year.” Moody feels the statement “kind of validates my point. I don’t really think she’s at all threatened by us. She said, ‘Don’t worry, you’ll have your music next year.’ But people might want something to listen to before then. That’s what we’re here for.”\n\nWe Are The Fallen has released its first song, “Bury Me Alive,” on its official web site, WeAreTheFallen.com. Rather than bring out an album, Moody says the group plans to release new material sporadically via the Internet; another track is due out in September before the quintet hits the road and then the band will release two songs every eight weeks. Moody says We Are The Fallen is considering a terrestrial CD for 2010 that may contain extended versions of the songs as well as orchestral interludes and perhaps even live recordings and footage from the tour.\n\n“I just think we live in an instant gratification world where bands need to hit quicker,” Moody explains. “The great thing about ‘Bury Me Alive’ is it was mastered on a Friday and released on a Monday. We’re not tired of listening to it in our cars yet. And as far as fans go, you won’t see us disappear for a year and a half or sometimes three years so we can write and record an album. You’re gonna get the absolute heart and soul of our creativity, and you’re going to get that immediately. That way every song matters, and I think the music will be better that way.”\n\nBesides its new material, We Are The Fallen does plan to play songs from “Fallen” on tour; the group even played that album’s “Going Under” at a press conference on Monday in Los Angeles."
