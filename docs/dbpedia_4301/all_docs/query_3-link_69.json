        "text": "Evanescence frontwoman Amy Lee has filed a lawsuit against her longtime record company Wind-Up Records, claiming that the label tried to sabotage the band by hiring shitty promoters and not paying the band their rightful royalties.\n\nAccording to TMZ.com , \"the singer claims Wind-Up Records hatched a plot to sabotage Evanescence by replacing its promoters with a bunch of idiots who ended up torpedoing the group with lame ideas.\"\n\nShe is reportedly seeking $1.5 million in unpaid royalties from the record label as part of her lawsuit.\n\nEvanescence have had their fair share of legal troubles, having previously filed suit against former manager Dennis Rider back in 2005 for professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and sexual harassment, among other things. Meanwhile, ex-guitarist Ben Moody, who left the band due to creative differences, has himself been the target of a suit by his management due to unpaid royalties. Ironically, that management company is ran by Rider.\n\nI guess this is what you do when your band is no longer relevant, and you still need your money from all those shitty Adult Contemporary stations who still play My Immortal."
