        "text": "Where did Evanescence go? At the height of their fame in the early 2000s, they had a chart-topping album (Fallen), a hit single (\"Bring Me to Life\"), and, with two Grammy Award wins, recognition from industry peers. Then, the band seemed to go quiet, leaving many fans wondering what happened to Evanescence and where they are today.\n\nLike most bands, Evanescence has evolved and changed direction over the years. Headed by frontwoman/singer/songwriter Amy Lee, the group started out in the Christian rock genre before taking a detour into the more mainstream sound that would eventually bring them stardom. And just because they are no longer the music darlings of the early '00s doesn't mean they've stopped writing and recording. Fans can rest easy knowing that Evanescence has not disappeared; they're still here, they're still making music, and they've got surprises in store for listeners.\n\nRead on for some stories about Evanescence, where they've been, and what the future holds for this one-of-a-kind band."
