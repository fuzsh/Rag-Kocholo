Moody states, \"We didnʼt set out to do anything serious. We were really just going to get together and play some covers for fun, but it was evident very quick that there was something special going on. After a few songs, it was obvious that we had something different than weʼve ever done before.”\n\nOn September 19, 2012, the first interview with the band was published on Revolver Magazine website. The page also featured the band's debut song, \"Beauty Is The Beast\".[1]\n\nOn November 27 through December 1, 2012, the band debuted live on ShipRocked 2012 alongside such bands as Godsmack, Korn, Five Finger Death Punch, P.O.D., Sevendust, Filter, 10 Years, Fuel, Pop Evil, In This Moment and others.[2] Newell joined the band as bassist before the show and it became permanent.\n\nOn May 28, 2013, The Halo Method released their debut EP Reset which features four songs: \"Toxic\", \"Beauty Is The Beast\", \"Porcelain\" and \"Crutch\". It was made available for free download on ESP Guitars website.\n\nOn June 3, 2013, Revolver Magazine website released the band's first video for \"Toxic\".[3]\n\nOn January 10, 2014, Dave Buckner stepped down from his position as drummer of the band citing location and logistics as his reasons for doing so.
