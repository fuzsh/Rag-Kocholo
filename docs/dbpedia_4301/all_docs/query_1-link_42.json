        "text": "Aequitas: Book 2 of the Monstrum Chronicles\n\nI think the soundtrack for Aequitas is one of my favorites. Machine Gun by Portishead is what kicks off the soundtrack, accompanying that stark reality that the prologue brings. \"Nisi Dominus\" (which was inspiration for the first chapter) was also a perfect ominous piece that I listened to for many different scenes over the course of the book. I'd had a chance over the two years of writing the book to be introduced to some little known artists like Atra Aeterna, O+S, and Little People whose music was integral to the creative process. One of the other most notable songs on this soundtrack is Red's Take It All Away, which was listened to while writing a flashback scene featuring Reid, Cardea, and Vilko. It's a powerful scene and the emotion that comes from the singer's voice absolutely blew me away and gave me the oomph to write it.\n\nNight Time, Dotted Line\n\nThis is pretty straight-forward: I loved writing Night Time, Dotted Line and loved the songs that inspired it. It's a warmer book and by that extension, a warmer soundtrack. Night Time by the xx is one of the driving songs (pun unintented) behind this story. I really couldn't get enough of it. The Wolves by Ben Howard, Dear Fellow Traveller by Sea Wolf, Have You Got It In You? by Imogen Heap, and Drive All Night by NEEDTOBREATHE are the others I'd say were integral to this book being written.\n\nThe Collection\n\nThe Collection was birthed essentially by listening to lots and lots of eerie instrumental music and soundtracks from period dramas. Some of the main inspirations behind this novel are actually pieces from soundtracks by Dario Marianelli, Max Richter, James Newton Howard, and Abel Korzeniowski. There are other pieces that are zany, weird, one-of-a-kind ones that worked for certain scenes. One such piece was a composition recorded from tree rings taken from an ash tree that someone then played on a record player. It's this chaotic beauty that spoke to me while writing this terrifying piano scene and I don't think it would have worked with anything else.\n\nThe Wild Dark\n\nThe Wild Dark soundtrack is moody and dark, inspired by southern gothic artists and eerie instrumentals. Among the more frequent artists on this playlist are Neil Young, Hozier, Feist, and Chelsea Wolfe. Out of the Darkness by Matthew and the Atlas, Angelene by Thomas Azier, and Poison Tree by Beth Orton are three of the original songs that helped inspire the story from the beginning back in 2013. Like the story, the soundtrack evolved over the years, became more romantic, more haunting, and more multi-faceted. I chose a larger array of female artists being that this story features a strong female protagonist.\n\nHallowed Oblivion\n\nThis was a short, fun Halloweeny playlist that I felt, really got Hank’s mood as well as the situation he encounters on the mountain with Gerard. I had watched Lou on Netflix while working on this and fell in love with the soundtrack. It was a consistent listen for me while I worked on the story along with the infamous “Kids” theme from Stranger Things.\n\nThe Wild Fall\n\nThis playlist is chock full of sad, eerie covers of classic rock songs. Some of the more prominent pieces I listened to while writing the book were of Alt J’s “House of the Rising Sun”, Lord Huron’s “Harvest Moon”, and Wye Oak’s cover of “Mother”. THE WILD FALL has more a more surrealist, dreamy feel to it than its predecessor, though still just as dark. I had fun composing the story while listening to things as nostalgic as The Eagle’s “Desperado” to Philip Glass’s remix of Blondie’s “Heart of Glass”."
