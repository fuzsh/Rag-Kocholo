        "text": "20. Laurel Halo – Atlas [Awe]\n\nAtlas might be Laurel Halo’s most mystifying album so far. It exudes an eerie, yet vaguely calm feeling — as if we are being kept safe from some unknown yet all-encompassing presence. Halo has always dealt in moody atmospherics, though Atlas’s foggy, reverb-smeared sonics impart a mystical aura, one which she has described as an “alchemical mess.” Compared to her last studio album, Raw Silk Uncut Wood, there appears to be a light at the end of Atlas’s tunnel, no matter how dim it may seemingly appear.\n\nJoined by a handful of collaborators, notably Lucy Railton on cello and vocalist Coby Sey, who provides beautiful stacked vocal harmonies on “Belleville,” Atlas has been described as something along the lines of ambient jazz. At points, it does feel like Halo is directing an abstract take on a jazz ensemble, though that is perhaps a bit too minimizing for what she is trying to accomplish through working in elements of modern classical, electroacoustic and drone. However, Atlas does thrive in the ambiance it produces, and those faint shimmerings of clarity amongst the miasma of sound — James Underwood’s violin, for just a brief moment, puncturing the solemn atmosphere of “Sick Eros” or Halo’s short and bittersweet solo piano piece, “You Burn Me” — give Atlas warmth and weightiness to contrast its otherworldly mystique. – Edward Dunbar\n\n19. ANOHNI and the Johnsons – My Back Was a Bridge for You to Cross [Secretly Canadian]\n\n“You be free for me,” ANOHNI begs tired at the close of her first record with her band The Johnsons in 13 years. Though titled My Back Was a Bridge for You to Cross, the album refrains from painting ANOHNI as a glorified martyr. Rather, she insists that she’s just one in a long line of mothers, sisters and daughters trapped in these frightening times of mountainsides swallowed by smoke (“Why Am I Alive Now?”) and queer lives traded for guns (“Scapegoat”). ANOHNI doesn’t ask to be regarded alongside Marsha P. Johnson, the profoundly influential gay rights activist whose face adorns My Back’s cover. She just suggests that her spirit lives on in herself and The Johnsons, and soon it must live on in those who follow.\n\nThat idea rings true as opener “It Must Change” arrives at its defeated conclusion: “We’re not getting out of here/ That’s why this is so sad.” The electrifying calls to action from ANOHNI’s last record HOPELESSNESS feel like a distant memory. She has no answers. All that’s left is grief, and all she can do now is look inwards and reach out for someone. Oneohtrix Point Never’s glitchy production is replaced with Jimmy Hogarth’s (Amy Winehouse, Sia, Tina Turner) buttery guitars and Rob Moose’s (Sufjan Stevens, Bon Iver, Phoebe Bridgers) exquisite string arrangements. ANOHNI sheds meticulous craft for raw impulse in her vocals, some of which appear as first takes. Little things become monumental: “The cold ice on my tongue/ Makes its way towards oblivion,” a memory of Lou Reed’s appreciation in his final months over mournful arpeggios. It all works to close the distance between artist and listener, an astounding record that pushes soul music to its most empathetic extremes. – Aaron Paskin\n\n18. Mitski – The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We [Dead Oceans]\n\nOn The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We, everything sounds more wide-open and sweeping, more relaxed, more free. Last year’s Laurel Hell conjured apocalyptic images of claustrophobic countrysides, tangled and gnarled with thickets and bones as a metaphor for Mitski’s complicated relationship with fame and the music industry. These thorny issues were enough for Mitski to consider retiring from music altogether. Renegotiating her contract caused Mitski to change her mind and continue making music, luckily.\n\nSomething seems to have settled in Mitski. Where Laurel Hell felt closed in, with thick walls of synthesizers and drum machines, The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We sounds expansive and organic. It trades in the synthetic sheen of Laurel Hell for ornate country strings and grand, sweeping orchestral arrangements courtesy of Drew Erickson, best known for scoring Father John Misty’s Chloë and the Next 20th Century and Weyes Blood’s And in the Darkness, Hearts Aglow. Where Erickson’s work with Father John Misty could at times feel arch and overly posed, however, The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We sounds as natural and free as a lilac-scented spring breeze softly creeping through your living room.\n\nThis relaxed, open state lets you bask in Mitski’s gorgeous lyricism, which balances the naturalism with slice-of-life miniatures, confessionals and, of course, plenty of self-loathing and heartache. It’s both classic Mitski and a bold step forward. Both sonically and lyrically, The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We is a reminder that grand doesn’t have to mean overproduced or pretentious. The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We is as ambitious as any prog or art rock record, yet Mitski makes it look effortless. It’s an incredible, poetic, moving record from an artist at the peak of her powers. – J Simpson\n\n17. Romy – Mid Air [Young]\n\nHow can such a sexy record double as one of the most emotionally pure releases of the year? Sure, Romy might close Mid Air out with such sultry lines like, “She’s on my mind/ But I wish she was under me,” but the thumping club beats turn her words into something too evocative for strictly the physical. When Romy sings, “Dance with me, shoulder to shoulder/ Never in the world have two others been closer than us,” it’s almost easier to intuit that she means closer spiritually. Mid Air doesn’t just love shamelessly, it yearns—a feeling infinitely more potent in the moment. Just as her voice, hushed but powerful, longs for what her heart desires, the pristine production tastefully restrains itself. As fun as a song like “Did I” may be, the music holds back before going completely overboard.\n\nIn the few minutes a Mid Air track might play, the dance floor is more than just a perimeter. Between the sweat and strobing lights, no words are exchanged, but Romy’s own tales of love, loss and everything in between speak for you. She doesn’t let you dance the pain away, because she knows that channeling your feelings into something as visceral as dance music makes it all the more powerful. – Thomas Stremfel\n\n16. Bill Orcutt – Jump on It [Palilalia]\n\nJump on It is the most approachable that guitarist Bill Orcutt has ever been, and there may be a few that would hold that against him. Make no mistake, though: while Jump on It may be an easier listen than any Harry Pussy album, it’s no easygoing instrumental album by any stretch. Instead, Orcutt takes the acoustic guitar and finds the thorny, dissonant tones that one can create with it, crafting something akin to a noise record with no amplifier or feedback. It can be a winding, mysterious album, one that brings obvious comparisons to any number of the celebrated acoustic guitarists of years past, but Orcutt’s technique is more immediate. He seeks to deconstruct what his instrument can do; meandering compositions like “In a Column of Air” and “New Germs” begin peacefully only to fall into a cacophony of aggressively strummed strings and dissonance. Other pieces, such as “Some Hidden Purpose” and the title track, weave these bursts of noise in a bit more seamlessly, but their power remains intact. Yet, there’s still a sense of comfort to be gleaned from Jump on It despite Orcutt’s deliberate messiness. When one is able to hear a master of their craft perform at this level, one can’t help but feel both wonder and satisfaction. – Kevin Korber\n\n15. billy woods & Kenny Segal – Maps [Backwoodz Studioz]\n\nbilly woods has never opened up more than he does on Maps. That’s not saying much, all things considered, but there’s still a sense that as outsiders, we’re receiving some long-hidden lore confirming that he is a normal-ass dude. He doesn’t like being around people, he’s nostalgic for old businesses, and he sounds like he’s going through relationship troubles. The now-established kicker with woods’ writing, however, is his writing’s pound-for-pound impact which reaches some career highs on Maps: “Something felt off before I even left/ So when I saw the missed calls, I knew what was next/ Didn’t have to open the texts.”\n\nReturning to the fan-favorite team-up with producer Kenny Segal piqued just about every Backwoodz aficionado’s interest when they announced Maps. But the record isn’t Hiding Places 2, and in fact offers an entirely new palette of production that plays like a yin to their first project’s yang. Perhaps fitting into woods’ relative openness, there’s an emphasis on songs that just go hard. Every billy woods fan will remember where they were the first time they heard “Year Zero” and promptly thought to themselves, “Oh shit,” when they realized Danny Brown was about to deliver one of the most quotable verses of the year. By woods’ standards, it’s pretty straightforward, but sometimes the straightest edges cut the deepest. – Thomas Stremfel\n\n14. Lana Del Rey – Did you know that there’s a tunnel under Ocean Blvd [Polydor]\n\nAs indicated by the long and poetic title, Lana Del Rey’s Did you know that there’s a tunnel under Ocean Blvd is a sprawling and dense body of work. Opening with a gospel choir in “The Grants” and closing with “Taco Truck x VB,” which features a remix of her own song “Venice Bitch,” the best way to appreciate Ocean Blvd is just to keep listening. Largely inspired by her family and greatly influenced by faith (though not religious), the album is complicated, long and layered.\n\n“A&W,” which captured critics’ and pop culture’s attention when it dropped as a single, is a seven-minute endeavor that features essentially two songs. It’s folksy until a trap beat comes in and changes the vibe completely. It’s among her best songs ever released. Then there are tracks like “Grandfather please stand on the shoulders of my father while he’s deep-sea fishing” or lyrics like “My boyfriend tested positive for COVID, it don’t matter/ We’ve been kissing, so whatever he has, I have, I can’t cry” in “Peppers” both which feel like things only Del Rey could come up and still thrill her listeners.\n\nMany of the collaborations – more than on any other of her records – are among the best tracks. There’s “Paris, Texas” with SYML that features Del Rey’s noteworthy and beautiful fluttering vocals, “Candy Necklace” and an interlude that both feature John Batiste, “Let the Light In” with her now semi-frequent collaborator Father John Misty, and “Margaret” with the record’s main collaborator Jack Antonoff. Though perhaps not as accessible or as groundbreaking as previous albums like Born to Die (2012) or Norman Fucking Rockwell (2019), Ocean Blvd provides ample material that proves why Del Rey’s music has had such an enduring hold on society over the past decade. – Domenic Strazzabosco\n\n13. Beverly Glenn-Copeland – The Ones Ahead [Transgressive Records]\n\nMuch of the media coverage of Beverly Glenn-Copeland’s fourth studio album focused on its unusually abundant subtext, from the universal (environmental issues, questions of human identity, spirituality and faith) to the personal (Glenn-Copeland’s own identity as a trans man of African heritage). Musically though, it’s just as rich – a synthesis of folk, soul, jazz, classical, gospel, musical theater and traditional West African elements that is hard to pin down stylistically but which sounds wholly natural, even familiar, and grows in stature with each listening. Many artists of Copeland’s age – he marks his 80th birthday in February – write music that is reflective and philosophical – but few remain at the top of their game as singers as he has done. The almost operatic, querulous high voice of Beverly Copeland (1970) is still intact, but his voice has become complemented by a far richer and more expressive lower register over time. The nine beautifully composed, memorable songs of The Ones Ahead provide that voice with material that is worthy of it; songs of experience that are musically inventive, but where every element serves and enriches the meaning – songs that are often full of sorrow but never devoid of hope. With its unclassifiable melange of styles, The Ones Ahead feels timeless, but with its concern – and love – for humanity and its empathic preoccupation with the eternal trials and tribulations that humanity so often creates for itself, the album feels utterly timely. – Will Pinfold\n\n12. Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit – Weathervanes [Southeastern]\n\nIs there a better storyteller than Jason Isbell in music today? The list of rivals for that title has been a short one for years now, and with Weathervanes, Isbell makes a near-bulletproof case for the crown. The 13 songs on Weathervanes are about regrets that will never be set right, cravings that can never be satisfied, the gnawing undercurrent of fear that everything is slipping away and there’s nothing that can be done to get it back, to just return things to how they were. On “Death Wish,” the narrator describes the helpless, hopeless desperation of loving someone who seems bent on self-destruction: “Did you ever catch her climbing on a rooftop/ Higher than a kite, dead of winter in a tank top/ I don’t wanna fight with you, baby, but I won’t leave you alone.” “King of Oklahoma” chronicles a man’s descent from blue-collar work to planning a heist from his old job site so he can feed both his family and his metastasizing opioid addiction (“Doctor took a quick look/ And I got out my checkbook/ And left with a pocket full of pills/ Now my back’s still hurting/ And I’m too weak for working/ And I can’t keep up with all the bills”). On “Save the World,” a parent reaches a breaking point at the routine news of yet another school shooting, transforming into a paranoid, clinging person he doesn’t recognize.\n\nThere’s nothing daring about the arrangements here. But these songs don’t need daring. The performances from the 400 Unit never overreach, always delivering exactly what’s needed to elevate Isbell’s stories without overshadowing them. The world Isbell’s characters inhabit is a hard one, but it’s hard in ways many of us will recognize. On “Death Wish,” Isbell asks “what’s the difference in a breakdown and a breakthrough?” The answer is that you’ll know it when you hear it. – Spencer Fleury\n\n11. Kara Jackson – Why Does the Earth Give Us People to Love? [September]\n\nMusic and words go hand in hand. So it’s no surprise that the 2019-2020 U.S. National Youth Poet Laureate Kara Jackson is also interested in making music. Why Does the Earth Give Us People to Love? is her second release and a wonderful hodgepodge of genres—mainly folk, blues, jazz and R&B. The album explores the world we live in, the turmoil but also the love and relationships we make.\n\nJackson’s voice isn’t the prettiest on the planet. It’s husky and slightly abrasive. But it fits well with her instrumentals and other effects that jump in and out like kids playing Double Dutch. The songs here have a shocking but interesting rawness. Not in any sort of lazy composing or immature lyrics. Jackson gives her whole self over (without gifting wrapping it or performing cosmetic surgery), being confessional without sounding whiny.\n\nMany singers from Madison Cunningham to Kacey Musgraves are interested in mixing country sounds (like pedal steel guitar) with other genres like pop or alt-rock. Jackson also plays with the idea of what down-home, front-porch music is and where it can collide with external sounds. The reverb and cosmic sounds that linger in the tracks create a disturbing atmosphere. Not scary or creepy, but slightly unsettling. And we should be unsettled in today’s society. Jackson brings her literature background along with her love of music and makes a unique experience that is alluring in a gritty yet beautiful way. – Konstantin Rega\n\n10. Natalie Merchant – Keep Your Courage [Nonesuch]\n\nHas the world finally caught up with Natalie Merchant’s melancholy? Keep Your Courage, her first collection of new material in nearly a decade, is a stunning album. But many publications (including this one) ignored the record when it was released back in April. It’s our loss, because this beautiful collection is one of the best records of the year.\n\nUnfairly dismissed as music for the middle aged, Merchant’s songs serve as guiding lights of consideration, understanding and insight for these dark times. But she also understands pain. After the pair of bright, almost upbeat duets with Abena Koomson-Davis that begin the record (“Big Girls” and “Come On, Aphrodite”), Keep Your Courage settles into a more melancholy tone. But within those darker textures, the warmth of Merchant’s voice is soothing and understanding.\n\nThere aren’t many bangers here. “Tower of Babel” with its New Orleans bounce is the closest to a danceable track, but that’s not what a Natalie Merchant album circa 2023 promises. Instead, we get tales of wounded saints, misunderstood martyrs and courageous nomads. Merchant finishes the album with “The Feast of Saint Valentine,” perhaps the most wrenching song she’s ever written. In a year of emotional powerhouse albums, especially those by Beverly Glenn-Copeland and ANOHNI and the Johnsons, Keep Your Courage emotes with the best of them. Now 60 years old, Merchant is no longer the fiery voice of youth that propelled the 10,000 Maniacs. She sees a world that has always been on fire, and Keep Your Courage may be her grandest statement yet. – David Harris\n\n9. Blonde Redhead – Sit Down for Dinner [section1]\n\nOn Sit Down for Dinner, the band’s triumphant return after nine years in the wilderness, Blonde Redhead demonstrate many things. For one, they show that, 30 years into their existence, they can still give a masterclass in rhythm and subtle, entrancing groove (“Snowman”), deliver one of the dreamiest, most romantic songs of the year (“Kiss Her Kiss Her”) or both at the same time (“Melody Experiment”). The pleasure of listening to their impressive songcraft is a reward in itself, but what makes Sit Down for Dinner a truly transcendent experience is not only in its immersive atmosphere, but also in its powers of communion.\n\nListening to great music is like eating a delicious meal: it demands undivided attention, earns it and is meant to be shared with loved ones. It took a decade for Blonde Redhead to reunite following two halfhearted records, and it shows: their time away from each other has not only sharpened their melodic focus, it also strengthened their on-record chemistry with each other, giving some real emotional weight to their communion songs. Each track is delicately composed and intimately performed, sometimes without words (“Via Savona”), but always with love and purpose.\n\nMore than anything, the album is a reminder to stop wasting time on things that are dull and meaningless, and to spend that time sharing meals and music with our loved ones, because one night of love and joy is worth infinitely more than a week of pointless work. As Kazu Makino makes clear on “Sit Down for Dinner (Part 2)”, “the life as you know it ends, no pity” when you get together for a meal, making it important to savor the moment ‒ and the music – while it lasts. – Shayan Ismaiel\n\n8. Caroline Polachek – Desire, I Want to Turn Into You [Sony Music]\n\nSophomore slump? Couldn’t be Caroline Polachek. Desire, I Want to Turn Into You is perhaps her most ambitious album yet, seamlessly shapeshifting from modern pop bangers (“Bunny Is a Rider”) to flamenco (“Sunset”), drum ‘n’ bass (“Fly to You”), slow burn art pop (“Crude Drawing of an Angel” and “Butterfly Net”) and more. Polachek’s ability to morph into various pop guises, while retaining a uniform and timely feel, is thanks to her sharp production sense, celestial vocals and consistent songwriting. Desire, I Want to Turn Into You treads the line between experimental and modern pop tropes without falling into inaccessibility or cliché.\n\nActing as executive producer, PC Music mainstay Danny L Harle’s inspired touch is apparent. While several similarly big names contribute (Dido, A.G. Cook, Ariel Rechtshaid, and Grimes to name a few), Polachek’s unyielding vision defines this album. One only needs to hear her reverb-heavy backing vocals with a propensity for prominent “Yeah”s, “Hey”s and various whoops, a familiar sound in her music dating back to the Chairlift days, to remember that this is still the same Polachek that’s been around since the late-aught indie heydays — one of the few survivors currently thriving. With that in mind, Desire, I Want to Turn Into You simultaneously feels like both Polachek’s opus and yet another step deeper into her idiomatic pop universe. – Edward Dunbar\n\n7. boygenius – the record [Interscope]\n\nBoygenius’ climb from a one-off EP to promote a tour by a trio of indie singers to a major-label band that could sell out Madison Square Garden makes a lot of sense when you realize that the record, even on its alt-rock anthems that can make a stadium of fans shout “Always an angel, never a god” in unison, rarely loses the intimate detail and memorable wit that brought Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus to fame in the first place. It can swell with layers upon layers of Baker’s exciting guitar playing on “$20” or “Anti-Curse,” float over rich orchestration and synths on “Letter to an Old Poet,” fall into a moody haze that would swallow any song less catchy than “Emily I’m Sorry,” or skip it all for bare acoustic folk on “Cool About It.” Stories about love, friendship and Dacus not interrupting a song that her friend loves ‒ even as that friend enters the interstate going the wrong direction ‒ are collaged in such a way to highlight each songwriter’s style without losing cohesion. Not to mention the fact that from the a cappella opening “Without You Without Them,” Baker, Bridgers, and Dacus simply sound incredible singing together. – Anna Solomon\n\n6. PJ Harvey – I Inside the Old Year Dying [Partisan]\n\nFor her first album in seven years, Polly Jean Harvey adapted poems from last year’s book/epic poem Orlam. The poems and resulting songs utilize an obscure dialect of English called Dorset. Working with longtime collaborators John Parish and Flood, Harvey utilizes field recordings and unusual folk instruments in addition to more standard guitar, bass and synths, creating an ambient neofolk soundtrack for her voice to mysteriously weave in and out of. On this album, she took great pains not to sing in her “PJ Harvey voice,” but instead she uses a higher register, giving her vocalizations a fragile, ethereal quality. Vocal contributions from actors Colin Morgan and Ben Whishaw are also featured, as this project was originally intended to become a stage adaptation of Orlam.\n\nIt’s nearly impossible to sum up what the album is about, not just because of the Dorset vernacular (a glossary is provided), but also the disjointedness of the story. The protagonist is nine-year-old Ira-Abel Rawles, and there are “chalky children and baskets full of shadows” and a messiah character called Wyman-Elvis who eats peanut butter and banana sandwiches. “Are you Elvis? Are you God?/ Jesus sent to win my trust?/ ‘Love me tender’ are his words,” Harvey sings on “Lwonesome Tonight.” The music is experimental and mysterious, many of the words are in an ancient language, and yet there is something compelling about it all that draws in the listener. Harvey insists on continually challenging her fans on every album. I Inside the Old Year Dying is no exception – while it’s quietly cryptic rather than confrontational, it is just as rewarding as Harvey’s other work. – Rachel Alm\n\n5. Feist – Multitudes [Polydor]\n\nIt’s been a long, strange trip from “1234” to Multitudes for Leslie Feist. The opening notes of “In Lightning” reveal a woman dealing with multiple emotions simultaneously. Heavy drums, synthesized bass and that voice reintroduce the singer after six years in the wilderness dealing with the death of her father and the competing, almost surreal sensibilities of becoming a mother in her forties.\n\nAmid that emotional roller coaster, musical forces compete, from gentle reveries resolving into furious splashes of drums exposing raw nerves. The yin and yang of “Borrow Trouble” leading into “Martyr Moves” illustrate Feist dealing with the multitude of competing forces consuming her. Walking the high wire with the skill of an old hand, she admits to her own sense of insecurity during these moments. Determined, Feist takes moments and reveals both the emotions and the insecurities hidden behind the personas she projects. When the music is soft and subtle, you get a window into her soul. Yet, one begins to feel that behind the flash of other tracks, things fluctuate, revealing the personal worlds others tend to keep hidden. Looking behind the curtains, we see Feist as a woman dealing with the insecurities that haunt us as we try to come to grips with who we are. – Bob Fish\n\n4. Yo La Tengo – This Stupid World [Matador]\n\nEven in their 1990s heyday, Yo La Tengo were a middle-aged band, singing songs about marriage, time and compromise that drew from 1950s garage, doo-wop and surf as much as they did from younger, hipper scenes like punk, kosmische and art-rock. More than three decades later, Georgia Hubley, her spouse, Ira Kaplan and James McNew don’t sound appreciably older than they did on their 1993 breakthrough album Painful. Kaplan still tunefully throttles his guitar while murmuring muted dissatisfactions in a voice that resembles Neil Young mixed with Lou Reed; Hubley continues to craft cool ripples on the drums while singing as if she’s just awakened from a really crackerjack daydream; bassist/occasional vocalist McNew manages to find gargantuan, unexpected grooves amid Kaplan’s cascading feedback and Hubley’s transcendental thunder.\n\nBut age and experience do manifest themselves ‒ as the album title indicates, the songs on This Stupid World are full of optimistic resignation, bristling, buoyant despair and simmering, pessimistic wonder. Kaplan, pushing 70, particularly sounds like a man who’s seen his share, with very few illusions left to disabuse or dreams left to puncture. But despite the remorseless corrosion of the ever-passing years, the band has kept at it, discovering lingering pockets of enchantment in their tempestuous ballads and serenely melodic jams. Even at this late date, Yo La Tengo can still conjure something special and unexpected, and if the vigor and freshness of This Stupid World feel like a miracle, it’s because, with very little left to lose and not a whole lot else to gain, the band can discover something new, surprising themselves and us. – Reed Jackson\n\n3. Lankum – False Lankum [Rough Trade]\n\nLankum’s fifth album, False Lankum, was always destined for critical cult status at the very least, purely on the basis of being so unique. An Irish folk record that sounds like a midpoint between the Pogues and Current 93 could very easily have found an audience among those with an affection for folksy performance art, and it certainly did, but False Lankum’s reach went much further than that, and it is all owed to the record’s authenticity. Juxtaposing tranquility and terror can be a tough needle to thread for most musicians, especially those who make folk music, but Lankum achieved it with muscular songwriting and intense performances that made them into indie music’s stars nearly overnight.\n\nAlbum opener and lead single “Go Dig My Grave” is rooted in folk traditionalism, but it’s the droning metal and Radie Peat’s keening vocals that turn this tale of unrequited love from “sorrowful” to “funereal.” On the flip side is “Newcastle,” a song whose sound falls closer to the “soothing” end of Lankum’s sound than the “terrifying” end, as a true and genuine lullaby that doesn’t lose its metallic edge. False Lankum gracefully and powerfully moves along the comforting-to-horrifying scale through its 70-minute runtime, and does not waste a moment of it, staying engaging throughout and never losing sight of the humanity behind their horrors. – Shayan Ismaiel\n\n2. Sufjan Stevens – Javelin [Asthmatic Kitty]\n\nSufjan Stevens’ writing has rarely been tighter than on Javelin even while his scope has rarely been broader. He pulls in every stylistic adventure from his past for an album that coheres perfectly because of (not in spite of) its flexibility. Stevens needs that musical reach, because he takes on the biggest topics. He’s never been shy about his sincerity or his emotions, and that earnestness drives Javelin‘s big questions. How do we deal with loss? How do we treat each other while we’re hurting? What can we find that transcends the terrible mess our lives so often are?\n\nWhat transcends it all is often a terrible kindness. Stevens bears the weight of suffering without shrugging. As he does so, he looks to his best self for his responses. There’s an unnamed strength at the center of all this tender music that keeps it from turning fragile. On one of the best songs of his career – “Will Anybody Ever Love Me?” – he stands utterly bare, and somehow it’s neither shameful nor discomfiting. In a less mature or less graceful artist, Javelin would crumble under the weight of its emotional starkness, but Stevens consistently finds the right phrases and the right expression to guide us.\n\nHe covers most of the kinds of love available to us, especially religious and romantic, and he knows the accompanying pain. He also knows that the peace he longs for doesn’t come easily; there’s hard fighting behind this softness. One Flannery O’Connor-referencing conclusion remains: everything rises. We may not always believe that, but Stevens insists on its truth in myriad ways. When everything looks broken, we learn it isn’t brittle. From pop to folk to electronic music, Sufjan inscribes something that lifts off the page and out of the speakers, irresistibly drawing us up. – Justin Cober-Lake\n\n1. Slowdive – everything is alive [Dead Oceans]\n\nSix years ago, reunited shoegaze giants Slowdive released their self-titled return to form, respecting their legacy while beautifully re-crafting it in a way that felt like it contained some ineffable magic that only comes from growing old. Somehow, they managed to do exactly all of the above again with everything is alive, a collection of just eight songs that’ll make you want to get lost in them forever. Here, the band confronts everything terrible that has happened since Slowdive — death, divorce, sobriety, global catastrophe — but does so in a way that feels like the most blissful relief one might ask for.\n\nEverything is a record of soft shapes and even softer enunciations, but little of it could be described as “sleepy.” When they sing, their words feel like they’re being beamed to you through a thick fog, impossible to feel confident in grabbing onto, but still feeling like a warm blanket — on closer “the slab,” it’s hard to feel confident that they’re singing words at all. On rare occasions, their words are vivid; when Neil Halstead sings “I know you dream of snowfields/ Floating high above the trees,” you can see yourself there. When he tenderly ushers you into his memories on “andalucia plays,” you can hear John Cale softly in your head. He and Rachel Goswell’s voices have aged gracefully — even if you can’t make out what they’re singing most of the time, the mere presence of their voices feels like a relief in the bleakest times."
