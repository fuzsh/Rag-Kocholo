        "text": "Cape Town – Remember Evanescence? They're planning a comeback soon!\n\nFrontwoman Amy Lee spoke to SiriusXM's Grant Random about the band's forthcoming album and when fans can expect it as well where the group has been for so long.\n\nThe new album will be a follow up to the band's 2011 self-titled record, as their 2017 release, titled Synthesis was a collection of reworking of old material with only two original songs.\n\nSEE A SNIPPET OF THAT INTERVIEW HERE:\n\nThe band has previously released four studio albums and two live albums.\n\nIn the interview, the singer said: \"This is sort of a creation year for us… We're playing a few festivals and some headlining shows — a little bit, but not too heavy. And in the time in between, getting together and starting the writing process for a new album.\"\n\nBUT WHERE HAVE THEY BEEN?\n\nOther than the compilation albums in 2016 and 2017, the members of the band have kept busy with their own solo music. In 2016, Amy Lee wrote and recorded a children's album titled Dream Too Much inspired by her young child, Jack, according to Rolling Stone.\n\nOther than Amy, the band has a forever changing roster.\n\nHERE'S A CATCH-UP OF TWO OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO LEAVE:\n\nBen Moody - who co-founded the band with Amy in 1995 and left Evanescence in October 2003 - has since joined two other groups, The Halo Method and We Are the Fallen with American Idols cast-off Carly Smithson, according to E! Online.\n\nDavid Hodges joined Evanescence in late 1999 and helped make their debut album, Fallen, with bandmates Amy and Ben. He left the band in 2002 and now writes hit music for artists like Christina Aguilera, Tim McGraw and Carrie Underwood, according to BMI.\n\nTHE CURRENT MEMBERS OF THE GROUP ARE:\n\nAmy Lee – lead vocals, keyboards, harp, piano (1995–present)\n\nTroy McLawhorn – lead guitar (2015–present; live member 2007–2011), rhythm guitar (2007-2015)\n\nJen Majura – rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2015–present)\n\nTim McCord – bass (2006–present)Will Hunt – drums, percussion (2010–present; live member 2007–2010)"
