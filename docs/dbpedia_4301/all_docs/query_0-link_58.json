They are rapidly gaining recognition and I am so glad to see it all happen. I first heard them a couple months back and put them on my list of bands to keep a close eye on. Well of course, things have been so busy that I haven’t taken the time to look at that list. Then, I heard their name again in an interview with Jonny Hetherington of Art of Dying and was so glad I did.\n\nEven in those short months, they have accomplished a lot. They have been busy working on their debut EP that will take the music world by storm.The Halo Method is Lukas Rossi (Rockstar Supernova), Ben Moody (Evanescence, We Are the Fallen), Dave Buckner (Papa Roach), and Josh Newell. Their music not only delivers a blend of hard rock, alternative, metal, goth and more, but their lyrics also tell incredible stories and take you on a journey through their words. Beauty is the Beast is a phenomenal song and you can listen to it on their Facebook page here.\n\nGet ready for their Hollywood takeover! This bad ass rock band will be playing at the infamous Whisky A Go Go in Hollywood on November 7th, 2013. This will be a concert you don’t want to miss. They are also planning on giving away a signed limited edition CD to the first 250 people through the door. You should definitely make sure to get their early because you have to get one of those CDs in your hand! So head over and pick up your tickets to the show here.\n\nThat is going to be an amazing show! We are really looking forward to their new EP and can’t wait to hear more from The Halo Method. I will leave you with their lyric video for another one of their KILLER songs, “Toxic”:\n\nWe will see if we can bring you an interview with this rising band and make sure to head over to their Facebook page and say “Hi” and stay up to date on their latest news.\n\n~ Marisol\n\nInformation & Links:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thehalomethod\n\nThe Halo Method is a rock band from Hollywood & Nashville and is definitely one you have to be on the look out for.
