        "text": "Eric Moe is captivated by nature and the scientific world. One can see this orientation transparently in his sources of inspiration for three of the works in this collection. But looking more closely at the music itself, Moe revels in creating systems of behavior that allow musical materials to interact with each other in a kind of free dialogue (inasmuch as music that is pre-written by a composer is “free”). Throughout these works, we hear Moe establish musical relationships, and then liberate them, allowing the molecules of sound to collide with each other. His music strives also for a kind of organic balance, tempering visceral impulses with gentle ones, but never allowing the music to become static. The composite result is music that can feel like it flows like water, shaped but not interfered with by its creator, despite the meticulous manner in which it was conceived.\n\nStrenuous Pleasures for flute, clarinet, violin, cello, piano, and percussion opens with a percolating fanfare of sorts, a multi-layered texture of intertwined contrapuntal lines, primary sustained notes that form a composite melody, and an off-kilter, martial snare drum part. The instruments weave through fields of harmony as if they are splashes of color on a vibrant canvas. Moe contrasts this energetic opening with flowing, lyrical material, though even in the expressive moments, the piece never loses kinetic energy, perhaps emblematic of the inclusion of the word “strenuous” in the title. The closing section reprises the vigor of the opening, though here Moe features individual instruments more than in the opening, giving each a moment to step out over a funky drum set part.\n\nRead More\n\nDeep Ecology, for cello and fixed electronic media, references an environmental philosophy that emphasizes interdependence between humans and the natural world. For the electronic materials, Moe assembled sounds from various creatures in the natural world and combined them with instrumental sounds that imitate the animal world. The cello plays the role of interloper, perhaps initially analogous to the manner in which humans interfere with the natural ecosystem. As the piece evolves, the electronic sounds assert themselves on the environment in which the cellist must play and adjust, and through this push and pull, the relationship becomes steadily more symbiotic and the cellist subsumes its individuality into the overall texture.\n\nSpirit Mountain, one of two works on the program performed by the Da Capo Chamber Players, is based around a Nepalese court song sung by Tashi Tsering that Moe discovered from a recording made by composer Andrea Clearfield and anthropologist Katey Blumenthal. In the original song, the solo vocalist is accompanied by a hand drum, a texture Moe introduces after an introductory presentation of fragments of the melody with choked cymbals and crotales. The double reeds (oboe/English horn and bassoon) lend a tart focus to the ensemble sound. As in Strenuous Pleasures, Moe extends complex harmonic areas by moving instruments around to different chord tones and registers and using non-repetitive syncopated rhythmic materials that drive the direction forward.\n\nWhat Instruments Have We Agree for clarinet, violin, viola, and piano and performed by counter)induction, is written in memoriam to composer Lee Hyla, a good friend of Moe’s and a pivotal figure in American contemporary music of recent decades. The work opens with sinewy, mournful lines in violin and bass clarinet before a rumbling, angular piano solo asserts itself with truncated utterances. The ensemble absorbs the halting phrase patterns but the piano continues to lead the way into more snarled passagework. A disjointed ensemble section follows, as unbridled emotion is projecting in the irregular patterning in the music. The piece closes with insistent repeated notes in the strings and hollow melodic figures in the bass clarinet and piano, the inescapable imperative that we must continue to move forward after a painful loss.\n\nDemon Theory, for saxophone and piano and performed here by Elliot Riley and Moe, is framed by a thought experiment from physicist James Maxwell that speculates on the behavior of an entity on two connected systems. As with Deep Ecology, Moe has a penchant for using musical parameters to explore and illuminate a set of ideas. Here the two connected systems are the saxophone and piano themselves; the piano opens the piece with a taut ostinato punctuated by a percussive strike before the sax joins with a jaunty figure of intervallic leaps and a central sustained pitch. A contrasting section features a flowing saxophone melody over watery, closely spaced piano voicings. Each instrument gets a soloistic turn, first with the piano playing a literal solo of crystalline high register chords before the sax joins for a rhapsodic, accompanied passage. The sharp corners of the opening merged with the linear fluidity of the middle section combine for a rousing, energetic close that pulses with synergistic energy between the instruments.\n\nAlso inspired by the world of physics, Welcome to Phase Space, written for and performed by the Horszowski Trio, refers to astrophysicist Shrinivas Kulkarni’s study of luminosity in novae and supernovae. Moe’s introduction glows with illuminated harmonies in the piano and trills that bristle with compressed energy. An emerging cauldron of accented, virtuosic figuration grows in all three instruments, articulating the sparkling dynamism of the cosmos. As in the title piece, Moe tempers the vigorous music with tender lyricism, assigning the strings a long-limbed line over portentous trill figures in the piano. Moe zooms in on subsections of the ensemble with a poignant piano solo followed by a jaunty passage for violin and cello, before bringing the instruments together again for joyfully interlocking independent lines and a tender closing section. Welcome to Phase Space strikes an entrancing balance between the unfathomable power of space and our deep wonderment in its presence.\n\n– Dan Lippel\n\nEric Moe\n\nEric Moe (b. 1954), composer of what the NY Times has called “music of winning exuberance,” has received numerous grants and awards for his work, including the Lakond Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a Guggenheim Fellowship; commissions from the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Fromm Foundation, the Koussevitzky Foundation, the Barlow Endowment, Meet-the-Composer USA, and New Music USA; fellowships from the Wellesley Composer's Conference and the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts; and residencies at the MacDowell Colony, Yaddo, Bellagio, the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, the UCross Foundation, the Camargo Foundation, the Aaron Copland House, the Millay Colony, the Ragdale Foundation, the Montana Artists Refuge, the Carson McCullers Center for Writers and Musicians, the Hambidge Center, and the American Dance Festival, among others.\n\nTri-Stan, his sit-trag/one-woman opera on a text by David Foster Wallace, premiered by Sequitur in 2005, was hailed by the New York Times as “a blockbuster” and “a tour de force,” a work of “inspired weight” that “subversively inscribes classical music into pop culture.” In its review of the piece, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette concluded, “it is one of those rare works that transcends the cultural divide while still being rooted in both sides.” The work is available on a Koch International Classics compact disc. Strange Exclaiming Music, a CD featuring Moe’s recent chamber music, was released by Naxos in July 2009 as part of their American Classics series; Fanfare magazine described it as “wonderfully inventive, often joyful, occasionally melancholy, highly rhythmic, frequently irreverent, absolutely eclectic, and always high-octane music.” Kick & Ride, on the bmop/sound label, was picked by WQXR for album of the week: “…it’s completely easy to succumb to the beats and rhythms that come out of Moe’s fantastical imaginarium, a headspace that ties together the free-flowing atonality of Alban Berg with the guttural rumblings of Samuel Barber’s Medea, adding in a healthy dose of superhuman strength.” Other all-Moe CDs are available on New World Records (Meanwhile Back At The Ranch), Albany Records (Kicking and Screaming, Up & At ‘Em, Siren Songs), and Centaur (On the Tip of My Tongue). The Sienese Shredder, a fine arts journal, includes an all-Moe CD as part of its third issue.\n\nAs a pianist and keyboardist, Moe has premiered and performed works by a wide variety of composers. His playing can be heard on the Koch, CRI, Mode, Albany, New World Records and Innova labels in the music of John Cage, Roger Zahab, Marc-Antonio Consoli, Mathew Rosenblum, Jay Reise, Ezra Sims, David Keberle, Felix Draeseke, and many others in addition to his own. His solo recording The Waltz Project Revisited - New Waltzes for Piano, a CD of waltzes for piano by two generations of American composers, was released in 2004 on Albany. Gramophone magazine said of the CD, “Moe’s command of the varied styles is nothing short of remarkable.” A founding member of the San Francisco-based EARPLAY ensemble, he currently co-directs the Music on the Edge new music concert series in Pittsburgh. Moe studied composition at Princeton University (A.B.) and at the University of California at Berkeley (M.A., Ph.D.). He is currently the Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Composition and Theory at the University of Pittsburgh and has held visiting professorships at Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania. More information is available at his website, ericmoe.net.\n\nhttps://www.ericmoe.net/\n\nDa Capo Chamber Players\n\nWinners of the 1973 Naumburg Award, the internationally acclaimed Da Capo Chamber Players has worked closely with countless distinguished composers—bringing the group exciting insights from composers representing an enormous spectrum of compositional styles. Da Capo’s virtuoso artists bring years of creative involvement and artistic leadership to performances of today’s repertoire, including over 150 works written especially for the group from composers such as Joan Tower, John Harbison, Shulamit Ran, Valerie Coleman, Philip Glass, George Perle, Stephen Jaffe, Shirish Korde, Tania León, and Milton Babbitt, among many others. Leadership in diversity programming over the years has included major works by Wendell Logan, David Sanford, George Walker and many others.\n\nIn tour concerts and mini-residencies across the country, Da Capo works with young composers everywhere, giving them opportunities to try out things with highly experienced virtuoso performers as well as recordings (often award-winning!) of their works. The ensemble has been in residence at Bard College for almost four decades, and since 2006 has been Ensemble in Residence with the Composition Program of the Bard College Conservatory of Music. In May 2012, the Naumburg Foundation invited Da Capo to premiere works by their first ever composition winners. National Public Radio named Da Capo’s CD, Chamber Music of Chinary Ung on Bridge Records, as one of the 5 Best Contemporary Classical CDs of the year in 2010.\n\nDa Capo currently plans a 50th Anniversary season! With an all-encompassing theme of DA CAPO BRIDGES, the series will feature new music bridging Eras, bridging Cultures, and bridging Styles. Each “bridge” represents a long- standing programming theme during our half-century!\n\nCarol McGonnell\n\nDublin-born clarinetist Carol McGonnell is a founding member of the Argento Chamber Ensemble.

In 2019, they made their sold-out London debut presented by Wigmore Hall followed by a successful 21-concert tour of Germany. In 2023, the “Horszowski Trio Prize” was created by the prestigious Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition, to encourage the next generation. The trio is based in NYC and named after the legendary pianist, Mieczyslaw Horszowski, with whom their pianist studied as his last pupil at the Curtis Institute of Music.\n\nJesse Mills\n\nSince his solo debut at the prestigious Ravinia Festival in 2004, Jesse Mills has established a unique career, performing music from classical to contemporary, as well as composed and improvised music of his own invention. The Washington Post claimed, “Mills played [Messiaen] as if he'd just received it from some distant, vast and magnificent reach of the cosmos.\" A co-founder of Duo Prism, with pianist Rieko Aizawa, they earned 1st Prize at the 2006 Zinetti International Competition. He is also a founding member of the Horszowski Trio, which since its formation in 2011 has concertized all over the US as well as internationally, including concert tours of Japan, Hong Kong, India, Germany, and a sold-out debut at Wigmore Hall in London. Mills is a graduate of the Juilliard School.\n\nhttp://www.jesse-mills.com\n\nMatters of music and its meanings are also paramount in some of the works on a (+++) New Focus Recordings release featuring chamber pieces by Eric Moe (born 1954). Unlike Weston’s work, those by Moe fall into the now-standard approach of many contemporary composers: often highly dissonant, stylistically combinatorial, and tied tightly to non-musical matters as well as some musical ones. Spirit Mountain (2010) and What Instruments We Have Agree (2015) are both memorial pieces, the former for conductor J. Karla Lemon and the latter for composer Lee Hyla. Both incorporate and expand upon specific music that listeners are unlikely to know, even if they are familiar with the people whom Moe memorializes. Both works use chamber groups mainly as collections of individual instruments rather than ensembles, with Moe mostly proffering short bursts of melody and rhythmic activity that are colored by the specific instruments playing them. The tie-in of these pieces to works directly associated with Lemon and Hyla means the music will have considerably more meaning for those who know the referents than for more-casual audiences. The other pieces on this disc refer to various non-musical matters that it is also helpful to know about for better comprehension and enjoyment of what Moe has created. Strenuous Pleasures (2010) contrasts brighter and faster multi-instrument elements with quieter ones, placing solo and duet sections against full-chamber-ensemble ones. Welcome to Phase Space (2014) is a trio (violin/cello/piano) with a somewhat Ligeti-ish evocation of interstellar vastness, based on a concept from physics. Also here are a duet and a solo work. The two-instrument work is Demon Theory (2013) for alto saxophone and piano: Moe himself is the pianist, and Elliot Riley, who commissioned the piece, is the saxophonist. This work also draws on physics in a way, referring to a thought experiment involving connected energy systems that Moe considers to be akin to the connectedness of the two instruments – a rather abstruse formulation that, like so many elements associated with Moe’s music, is best understood prior to hearing the work so as to be better able to absorb it. The solo piece here is Deep Ecology (2020) for cello (David Russell), although it is not quite a solo, since it incorporates electroacoustic material that in fact tends to dominate the instrument: the usual sounds of nature (birds, frogs, insects) intersect with those of the cello, which comments on and interweaves with them, suggesting ways in which humans interact with the rest of the world. The sonic environment of all these pieces is forthrightly contemporary, the performances committed and engaged with the material – but everything here is an illustration of or exploration of something that is not here, that is external to the music itself, that needs to be studied and understood for Moe’s works to have anything approaching the effect he wishes them to have.\n\n— Mark Estren, 11.16.2023\n\nComing across a composer for the first time who emanates an aura of prestige can be at once daunting and off-putting. Eric Moe (b. 1954) was educated at Princeton and Berkeley; he now holds a Mellon professorship at the University of Pittsburgh. His commissions have come from the Pittsburgh Symphony and elite sources like the Fromm and Koussevitzky Foundations, sprinkled along the way with a Guggenheim Fellowship and creative retreats at the MacDowell Colony, Yaddo, and the Copland House. This sketch—and it is only a sketch—testifies to wide acceptance as a contemporary composer.\n\nAt the same time, it arouses a “Show me” reaction that I’ll confess to. Moe’s readiness to put a scientific halo around these six chamber works, which span the decade from 2010 to 2020, risks pretentiousness. One learns that Welcome to Phase Space “refers to astrophysicist Shrinivas Kulkarni’s study of luminosity in novae and supernovae.” That’s too much intellectual freight for a piano trio to bear when its chief feature is a string of trills in the piano part. Deep Ecology, for cello and electronics, asks for approval from the environmentally worried. In other ways the detailed program notes exude the feeling that Moe is safely ensconced in the cozy self-approving world of New Music.\n\nSo much for the off-putting part. I mention it not to create a negative image around Moe’s diverse compositions, but something like the opposite. Looking past the scientific chic and the academic cuteness of titles like Demon Theory and Strenuous Pleasures, Moe’s creative imagination is impressive and at times inspired. The most conventional work here, Welcome to Phase Space, is a major addition to the repertoire of contemporary piano trios. Commissioned and beautifully performed by the Horszowski Trio, the piece is constantly moving into novel gestures, and the use of trills that I mentioned isn’t trite but a strong suit, creating very enticing atmospheric effects.\n\nLikewise, Deep Ecology is intriguing in the way it interweaves a fairly conventional solo cello line with taped sounds from the natural world—birds chirping or hooting, insects clicking, mysterious taps and night sounds. The result is hauntingly nocturnal, a direct descendant of Bartók’s signature night music in contemporary guise. Moe’s ear lends itself to a musical pictorialism in the way the electronics blend completely natural and manipulated sounds. The notes speak of the cello being like an intruder in Nature, the usual bashing one expects from environmentalism in its finger-pointing mode. I took the liberty of ignoring the implied lecture in favor of appreciating such an appealing and evocative work.\n\nI won’t entirely retract my opinion that Moe is safely ensconced where he is. Too much of the time he resorts to tightly knit instrumental lines that feel as abstract, cool, and dry as Stravinsky’s more mechanical exhibits in Neoclassicism. More gratifyingly, there are rarely any pointless dissonances, never an attempt to shock, and only here and there a feeling of repetitive note-spinning. Moe’s craft is self-evident. In another highlight of the collection, Demon Theory, the exhilarating effect of the music is dampened if you read that this duo for saxophone and piano references “physicist James Maxwell’s thought experiment that conjectures an entity that would meddle with the energy states of two connected systems.”\n\nWhat the jargon disguises is the conventional setup, as in many duos, where the two instruments sometimes go their own way, clash, come back together, and find harmonious accord. The key is that Demon Theory does all those things so well, in a riveting performance by saxophonist Elliott Riley and the composer as pianist (Moe has a considerable reputation as a contemporary pianist and champion of wide-ranging composers). Separately and together, the two parts are, I’ll admit, very much like “two connected systems.” They are strong and expressive individually, displaying virtuosity, energy, and imagination at every turn.\n\nThere are pieces that strike me as too tightly wound and yet meandering, which covers my response to the title work, Strenuous Pleasures, a sextet for strings, woodwinds, percussion, and piano. It is upbeat and adroit, with plenty of variety, but the noodling of interwoven lines somehow isn’t memorable enough. New Music composers often fail to communicate a specific mood or emotion, which caused me to lose my interest in Strenuous Pleasures. I got more involved in What Instruments We Have Agree, a mixed quartet for violin, viola, bass clarinet, and piano, because the emotion at its heart is elegiac—the work was written in memoriam to a departed contemporary composer and friend. Sadness and lyricism anchor the piece, although Moe finds impressive ways to express other, harsher emotions surrounding death and memory.\n\nA reviewer never expects every reader to share the same response to music, especially contemporary music, but I hope I’ve convincingly conveyed the rewards of this release, which never displays the divisive or controversial side of New Music. Moe is as gifted as his prestigious career arc implies, and several works on the program deeply impressed me. All the performances, recorded in various venues between 2009 and 2023, are first-rate.\n\n— Huntley Dent, 4.16.2024"
