Her mother raises three other siblings, and her father is a DJ. Ben Moody stated that he met Amy at a youth camp when she was playing a song by famous hard rocker Meatloaf on the piano. Ben Moody went over to Amy to meet her. She began singing for him and Ben was astonished so he suckered her into creating a band.

Her favorite holiday is Halloween. She loves the Victorian Era because they had such cool clothes. Her favorite movie is, “Nightmare before Christmas.” Amy’s favorite hobbies are drawing, and writing in her journal. Amy admits to being overweight and having poofy hair in middle school. She says that three words that best describe her are unique, sympathetic, and misunderstood.
