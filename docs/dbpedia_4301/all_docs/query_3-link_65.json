        "text": "Amy Lynn Hartzler (known professionally as Amy Lee) was born on December 13, 1981 to John Lee, a disc jockey and voiceover artist, and Sara Cargill. She trained in classical piano since childhood, originally inspired by Mozart and Danny Elfman's film scores. The death of her little sister at six years old significantly affected her emotional state and outlook on life. In her preteen years, her family moved around the country, including Florida, Illinois, and finally settling in Little Rock, Arkansas. 13-year old Amy met 14-year old guitarist Ben Moody in 1994 at a summer camp, where she played piano and he acoustic guitar. They began writing and playing music together, and performed at local shops and cafes. They decided on the name Evanescence, released independent EPs, a demo CD, and were signed by Wind-Up Records in 2001. In 2003, their debut album \"Fallen\" was released, becoming a major commercial success driven by hit singles such as \"Bring Me To Life\" and \"My Immortal\". \"Fallen\" was followed by the release of \"The Open Door\" in 2006, the self-titled album \"Evanescence\" in 2011, the orchestral-electronica album Synthesis in 2017, and their latest album, The Bitter Truth in 2021.\n\nAs a solo artist, Amy has composed soundtracks for films (including the indie film War Story (2014) with friend and cellist Dave Eggar), and contributed to the Underworld (2003) soundtrack and musical projects such as 2008's Nightmare Revisited, Muppets:The Green Album (2011) and We Walk The Line: A Celebration of the Music of Johnny Cash (2012). She has released a covers EP, a film soundtrack, and a children's album. She has also collaborated with various artists, such as Korn, Bring Me the Horizon, Seether, Lindsey Stirling, and Dave Stewart."
