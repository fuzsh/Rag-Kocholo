        "text": "The one copy of Origin I have has a different backup singer which sounds to be Ben Moody rather than David Hodges. Be interesting if someone else has this copy to confirm this. But, you can clearly hear when comparing that there is two different singers from the two albums.\n\nI would have thought someone would have said something about this discovery?\n\nIt surprised me when I noticed it. I never really listened to the this song much until lately, also am more familiar with how their voices sound these days to, with having their own solo albums.\n\nThe only copy I have is an unofficial copy that I got years back at a Kiss convention in NJ. I always liked that song (and most of that album). How many releases are there? I thought there was only the original independent CD.\n\nThere is lots of unofficial copies. From what I understand the new vinyl release is the only official version available of the demo. Perhaps if I can figure it out I can get a short sample of the song difference on You Tube, to see what everyone else hears."
