        "text": "Today we're celebrating Evanescence guitarist and co-founder Ben Moody's birthday as he turns 40-years-old. We're honoring his footprint in the goth metal world by flashing back to a gig that took place on his birthday during the height of Evanescence's career back in 2004.\n\nMoody was just turning 23 when the band was on their massive World Domination Tour in support of their debut album Fallen. They had just begun their Asia leg, performing their second night in Japan at Zepp Sendai, a long way from their hometown of Little Rock, Arkansas but no doubt a magical place to celebrate a birthday.\n\nThe setlist featured 14 songs, with 11 coming off of Fallen. They opened up with \"Haunted\" and played all the staples off the LP like \"Going Under,\" \"Everybody's Fool\" and their record-shattering banger \"Bring Me to Life,\" which stands as their most performed song to date. The set also included a rare gem off their demo album Origin - \"Even in Death.\" They last performed it in 2017.\n\nOne cover tied the whole set together - a refreshing rendition of Soundgarden's \"4th of July.\" The set ended on \"Whisper,\" their 6th most performed song to date.\n\nCheck out the setlist here:\n\nHappy Birthday, Ben!"
