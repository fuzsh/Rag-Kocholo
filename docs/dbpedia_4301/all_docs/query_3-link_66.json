        "text": "''Everyone knows a lot about me without actually knowing me at all,'' says Lee, now 24.\n\nHer celebrity status as a singer of edgy songs left her surrounded by teenage fans in search of a role model.\n\nIt takes only a few minutes in Lee's presence to see what drew them: Her porcelain skin and shimmering, pale blue eyes are set off by a mane of black hair, and she seems to embody both confident strength and a delicate femininity.\n\nThink Angelina Jolie with extra eyeliner.\n\nBut despite the image of hard-rocking power that Lee projected during her first years in the spotlight, she was struggling with unhealthy relationships and the overwhelming experience of success. And she was still practically a teenager herself.\n\nThen things went from complicated to just plain ugly: within months, Moody abruptly quit the band while on tour. The two have barely spoken since. There were other troubles to deal with as well: Last year, she sued her former manager, accusing him of charges ranging from sexual battery to misusing her money; he has denied the charges.\n\nIt's part of the reason why Lee decided rather than rush out another album to preserve her fledgling stardom to take a break: ''I just cut myself off from the world a little bit. Unplugged all the phones.''\n\nShe declines to talk about Moody or the lawsuit in an interview, worried that it has made her dark image even darker: ''The things that are out there are almost all things I've shared. But I realise by reading interviews that it sounds a lot more negative than it is. So much drama.''\n\nLee eventually began working with a new writing partner, guitarist Terry Balsamo (formerly of Cold and Limp Bizkit), who had joined Evanescence.\n\nBut there were more roadblocks ahead: Before a follow-up album could be finished, Balsamo suffered a stroke in 2005. He's now nearly recovered, but the experience was life-changing for them both.\n\nIt strengthened Lee, she says, making her music even more intimate and confessional: ''It really made the album more meaningful. You totally get a new perspective.''\n\nBalsamo says writing with Lee was a more rewarding experience than his collaborations with his other bands because ''she was willing to try new things and not do the same old (stuff), and that's something I'm really a big fan of''.\n\nThe Open Door debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album charts, selling almost 450,000 copies in its first week. The album offers vulnerability from Lee, and even a healthy dose of hope.\n\n''I'm at the best place I've been,'' she says, smiling. ''Not that I think all the songs from now on are going to be happy and cheery, of course.''\n\nEvanescence fans will be glad to hear that. Although the band's line-up has changed considerably since Fallen (bassist Will Boyd quit earlier this year), the music remains consistent.\n\n''It's still, first and foremost, coming from my heart,'' Lee says.\n\n''But you can definitely say it's feeling different since Ben's leaving. The guitars are a completely new style. Terry rocks. It's innovative, but not so out there that you can't relate.''\n\nMany tracks on The Open Door explore the process of learning not to sacrifice yourself for the sake of love, something Lee says she's learned about in recent years. She doesn't regret sharing that experience with strangers, though it's odd to be looked to for advice at an age when most women are seeking mentors of their own.\n\n''It's really wild. I never went into this thinking, 'I'm gonna set a good example','' she says.\n\n''I started creating art because I was searching for answers, and it was that searching that led to my music. From a lot of my lyrics, I feel like I don't understand how people are really looking up to me. Because it's all questions.\n\n''But I do encourage people to care. There's a lot of apathy in our youth. A lot of people living with situations they're in without doing anything about it. In the new album, I go for, 'What's the solution? How do I get out of this?' I'm hearing myself grow within the music and also personally grow.''\n\nLee says she's always been an adviser of sorts.\n\n''I think part of my job probably is counselling. I don't want to say more than I should. I mean, I don't have a medical degree. But I'm sort of a friend, like an advice columnist,'' she says.\n\n''In high school, I was the person a lot of people would come to, even people who didn't know me that well. They wanted to spend the night at my house and talk.''\n\nDespite that experience, it can be jarring to hear that her music has helped fans through their darkest times, even saving some from considering suicide. But Lee is glad to be there for them.\n\n''It's important to let out what you're feeling, to tell somebody or write a song or write a poem, and read it to your class. Better to do that, rather than pretending it's fine and kicking yourself later,'' Lee says."
