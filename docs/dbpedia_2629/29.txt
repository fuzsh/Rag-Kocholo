South American champion LDU Quito produced a first-half blitz to beat Mexico's Pachuca 2-0 Wednesday and book a place in the Club World Cup final.

Claudio Bieler gave the Ecuadorean side a 4th-minute lead when he profited from a lucky ricochet, before Luis Bolanos doubled the advantage just over 20 minutes later with a brilliant free-kick from the edge of the box.

Pachuca dominated second-half possession in foul conditions at National Stadium, but LDU's lightning-quick breaks had already done the damage to seal Edgardo Bauza's team a place in a final showdown against Gamba Osaka or European champion Manchester United on Sunday.
