Ecuador's LDU beat Mexican side Pachuca 2-0 in pouring rain on Wednesday to reach the Club World Cup final and set up a potential showdown with Manchester United.

Argentine forward Claudio Bieler gave the South American champions the lead in the fourth minute, pouncing on a ricochet to score after his initial effort had been blocked.

Midfielder Luis Bolanos added a second goal for Quito-based LDU with a curling free kick in the 26th minute after a disputed handball decision on the edge of the penalty box.

This year's surprise Libertadores Cup winners face European champions United or Japanese club Gamba Osaka in Sunday's final in Yokohama.

United play Gamba on Thursday.
