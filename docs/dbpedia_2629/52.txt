No longer an open secret, Sporting Kansas City officially announced the signing of forward Claudio Bieler to a Designated Player contract on Tuesday. The deal includes an undisclosed transfer fee.

"He's proven over the years that he's a very consistent goal scorer," Sporting KC Manager Peter Vermes said in a team release. "We think he's got a lot of good qualities that can fit into our team. Everything from his commitment to being a team player, to his work ethic out on the field, to a guy that lives and breathes for club that he plays for. We're excited that we're able to finally secure him and add a player of his caliber to our organization."

The 28-year-old native of Argentina had been one of the top scorers in Ecuador's Serie A, scoring 57 goals in 110 league matches for LDU Quito over the past several years. This past year, he was the league's second-leading scorer with 20 goals in 34 matches. In 2008, he helped lead Quito to the Copa Libertadores title by scoring three goals, including one in the final against Brazil's Fluminense.

"Kansas City has followed me for the last few years and know how important winning is to me," Bieler said. "It was a little hard to leave, as the fans at my old team wanted what I did, championships. Now I am excited to be here in KC and want to earn all of the hearts of the fans or 'hincha' like they call it in Ecuador. I am here and determined to win."
