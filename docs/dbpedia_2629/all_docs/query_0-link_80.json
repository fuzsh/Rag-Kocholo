        "text": "2013 Moments of the Year\n\nWith 2013 coming to a close, here are some moments of the year.\n\nGame of the Year\n\n11/23 vs Houston Dynamo\n\nIt'd be an easy thing for me to pick MLS Cup against Salt Lake. And while that game was exciting and brought KC a trophy this year, I'm going with the win that got KC there. Falling behind 1-0 after just three minutes to the team that had knocked KC out of the playoffs the last two years there was plenty of \"here we go again\" comments from fans. On the field though KC took control of the game against the Dynamo. And without Ricardo Clark in the middle of the field for the Dynamo, Benny Feilhaber had room to run at the Houston back line. Those runs led to both of KC's goals as KC finally overcame the Dynamo and advanced to MLS Cup.\n\nGoal of the Year\n\nBenny Feilhaber 8/31 vs Colorado\n\nThere were a number of good goals this year, from the one touch passing on Claudio Bieler's goal against Toronto, to Graham Zusi's shross against the Chicago Fire, and Dom Dwyer's winner in the Eastern Conference finals. But the goal of the year was Feilhaber's outside of the foot blast against the Colorado Rapids. Dwyer won a ball with a sliding challenge from Hendry Thomas and the ball fell to Feilhaber who took one touch with his right and then let fly with the outside of his right foot. The ball curled around Clint Irwin and into the net giving KC a 1-0 lead in a game they'd end up winning 2-1.\n\nAssist of the year\n\nBenny Feilhaber to Dom Dwyer vs Houston 11/23\n\nA fantastic little chip over a couple Houston defenders right into the path of Dwyer whose finish matched the fantastic set up by Feilhaber. That type of play is why Feilhaber was brought in, to give KC a bit more of that creative spark. And in the playoffs, Feilhaber definitely brought it.\n\nHonorable mention - Soony Saad, Kei Kamara, and Benny Feilhaber, one touch passing sets up Claudio Bieler against Toronto.\n\nBest player that is underrated outside KC.\n\nSeth Sinovic\n\nSporting's left back had another solid season for Kansas City, in fact he was my vote for KC's defender of the year this year. He appeared in 42 of KC's 45 games in all competitions and played more minutes than any other player this year. With Chris Klute having a breakout season for Colorado, Sinovic has again been \"overlooked\" by larger media. But hopefully Sinovic has done enough this year to finally get the call up many KC fans feel he deserves.\n\nLow moment of the year\n\n1-0 loss to Orlando 6/12\n\nKC's last game before the US Open Cup match up with affiliate club, Orlando City was on 6/1. So they had 11 days since their 2-1 loss at home to Montreal. So they were well rested, and they had another 10 days before their next league game against Dallas. Combine that with the fact that Orlando's leading scorer, Dom Dwyer did not play in the game because of the affiliate agreement between KC and Orlando kept him and KC's other loaned players from playing in the game. Orlando though came in with a chip on their shoulder, scored in just the second minute and held on to top Sporting 1-0.\n\nNon-Sporting KC, KC player moment\n\n10/15 Graham Zusi vs Panama\n\nWhat this is, is a moment for a Sporting KC player away from Sporting KC. While it'd be easy to pick Zusi's goal at Sporting Park against Jamaica, I'm choosing his goal a few days later. Mainly because his goal against Panama made him a cult hero in Mexico. San Zusi should probably be enjoying an all expenses paid trip to a Mexican resort at some point for that goal.\n\nComets Goal of the Year\n\n1/19/13 Leo Gibson vs Rochester Lancers\n\nGibson had a heck of a performance against the Lancers in this game, setting an MISL record for points in a game with 16, scoring 6 goals and adding 2 assists. His best goal was his fifth, a bicycle kick off a long ball from Vahid Assadpour. The goal starts at 1:55 in the below video.\n\nFC Kansas City Goal of the Year\n\n6/23/13 Lauren Holiday (Cheney) vs Washington Spirit\n\nIn their first game against the Washington Spirit, Holiday scored both goals, but it was her first goal that was her best. Receiving the ball at the top of the 10 yard arc at the top of the box, Holiday took a centering touch and then let fly with a shot that went into the corner, a great shot.\n\nKC Soccer Player of the Year\n\nLauren Holiday (Cheney)\n\nIn the NWSL's first season, US women's national team player, Lauren Holiday had a fantastic season. She was named the league's MVP while leading the league in both goals (12) and assists (9). On top of winning the MVP award, Holiday also got married this year and played a key role for the US throughout the years.\n\nComets Fall to Syracuse\n\nIn a battle for first place, the Comets and Syracuse Silver Knights had an encounter that deserved to be called such. The refereeing though left plenty to be desired with a number of questionable decisions having an effect on the game.\n\nThe Knights jumped out to an early lead as Machel Millwood received the ball back to goal and ended up turning Coady Andrews and firing a shot past Danny Waltman to give the Knights the lead. The Comets were able to get back into the game on the power play. Vahid Assadpour fed the ball to Leo Gibson who beat Brian O'Quinn to make it 2-2. The rest of the quarter saw the Comets spending time on the penalty kill, first Brian Harris went to the box for tripping, and with just 2 seconds left on the power play, Kenardo Forbes hit a three pointer. Then with time running down in the half, Ramone Palmer went to the box for kicking after making a slide tackle for a ball at midfield. Shortly after he went to the box, Robert Palmer joined him after a tripping penalty. In a 3v5 situation the Comets held out, but not long as Neto scored with under a minute left to make it 7-2.\n\nThe second quarter saw the Comets grab control of the game. Gibson scored his second goal of the game just over four minutes in off an assist from Milan Ivanovic. Less than a minute later, the Comets had tied the game. Off a restart in the corner, Bryan Perez fed the ball back to Assadpour who let rip from 3 point range, the ball curled inside the near post to level the game at 7-7. The Comets grabbed the lead just over nine minutes into the quarter as Harris found Gibson and finished off the opportunity to complete his hattrick. Nelson Santana tied the game back up with under 3 minutes left in the half off an assist from Forbes. The Comets though would hed into the half up 11-9 after Rober Palmer found Assadpour for his second of the game.\n\nJust two minutes into the third quarter, the Comets extended their lead, as Assadpour raced down the field and fed the ball to Stefan St Louis. St Louis' shot though went off the wall, but the rebound fell to Assadpour who finished his opportunity on the second chance to make it 13-9. Just before the half way point, the Knights got a gift to get them within one score. After collecting a shot, Waltman was looking to distribute it short, but the ball slid out of his hand as he tried to pull it back into his body. Neto was the first to react. Waltman tried to slide and save it, but Neto got around him and scored. The Comets had a few opportunities to extend their lead, but didn't finish or couldn't convert. Harris had a goal rule out because the rebound of his initial shot bounced off his arm and into the goal. Gibson raced in 1v1 with O'Quinn, but as he got into the box he got caught from behind. No foul was called though as Gibson was barreled over. With under a minute left, the Knights won a restart, it was played to the top of the 3 point arc by by Millwood. Forbes fired from 3 point range, beating Waltman again to give the Knights the lead again at 14-13.\n\nIn the fourth quarter the Comets grabbed a goal less than five minutes in as Assadpour fed the ball to the back post for Byron Alvarez to tap home to make it 15-14. The Comets defense held as the minutes ticked off the clock. the Comets offense also got opportunities, but O'Quinn did a very good job in goal. Then with under 5 minutes left, the Comets turned the ball over in their own end to Neto. John Sosa tried to chase him down, but ended up fouling him and earning a blue card. A play similar to the one that had been a no call in the previous quarter when Gibson was fouled. Santana stepped up for the shoot out, as he tried to round Waltman, the Comets goalkeeper stuck an arm out and knocked the ball away. Unfortunately, his hand was outside the box. Waltman was given a blue card, that Ramone Palmer served, and Santana got another chance. This time Santana didn't try to go around Waltman and just beat him with power to give the Knights a 16-15 lead. The Comets would pressure and with just under 2 minutes left would go with the sixth attacker. The Knights though would be the ones who would take advantage of the less experienced goalkeeper in goal with Forbes finishing off his hattrick to make it 18-15 with under a minute left. That's how the game would end up as the Comets would drop their second home game of the season.\n\nRumor Time - Man City, Dwyer, Heineman\n\nBeen resigned to just Twitter over the past few days while doing family stuff and during that time, there's been a few rumors that have come out regarding Sporting KC.\n\nFirst the rumor that has gotten the most talk and is probably based on the least information. It comes from what appears to be an off-handed comment from midfielder Oriol Rosell in an interview with a Spanish sports site. When asked if Sporting KC could compete in La Liga, Rosell says that Sporting is better suits to the EPL, then says \"Two years ago Kansas beat Manchester United in a friendly and this year we will play [Manchester] City.\"\n\nThat one sentence has set off tons of speculation about KC playing a friendly in 2014. Both The Daily Wiz and MLSsoccer.com have gotten quotes from Sporting KC regarding the rumor, and both have been fairly non-committal, saying that they are looking at a big name friendly in 2014.\n\nThe MLSsoccer.com quote I find more interesting, because the team's quote says \"after a busy 2013 we're certainly eager to bring a big-named opponent to Sporting Park next year.\"\n\nIt's an interesting/humorous quote considering in 2013, Sporting was guaranteed 39 games at minimum and played 45 (a club record for a season). In 2014 Sporting KC is already scheduled for a minimum of 41 games and that number could expand exponentially if Sporting KC advance in the CCL, the Open Cup, and make the playoffs. So with more games taking place in a shorter time frame thanks to a World Cup break, we're going to be playing a friendly again.\n\nThe game though isn't for a fan like me who is more focused on winning MLS Cup, the Supporters' Shield, the Open Cup, or the CCL, it's for the casual fan who currently isn't a big fan of SKC, or a Euro-snob who won't give MLS the time of day.\n\nAnd while the quote from Sporting in the MLSsoccer.com article specifically references Sporting Park, this tweet from Robb Heineman still rings in my ear:\n\nIf the friendly is indeed against Manchester City it's one that would fit the above description. And while I'm not a fan of friendlies, I'd still attend the game and would prefer the cheaper Arrowhead ticket.\n\nDwyer to Charlton\n\nDom Dwyer has apparently been training at Charlton Athletic, and on Boxing Day he was at The Valley for their 3-2 win over Brighton.\n\nFrom reading through some Charlton forums, fans of the club seem fairly confident that Dwyer will be joining the club on loan in January, although they don't seem sure of the length, whether it would be for the rest of the season, or similar to Kei Kamara's loan where it would end before the season ended.\n\nHeineman Hints at News\n\nWith two Tweets tonight, Robb Heineman has gotten the rumor mill turning again for Sporting KC fans on potential signings. It's brought out a number of unreasonable signings, the likes of Wayne Rooney and others, it's also brought out more logical ones, like the return of Roger Espinoza. My assumption is that the player is one that very few if anyone will guess, and few have heard of and know much about.\n\nNielsen vs Meola\n\nWhile watching Sporting KC lift MLS Cup, a thought went through my head regarding goalkeeper Jimmy Nielsen. It's hard not to judge Nielsen's career with Kansas City compared to that of Sporting Legend, Tony Meola. Up until Nielsen's arrival, Meola appeared to be on an untouchable level among goalkeepers for Kansas City.\n\nAfter four years here though I think Nielsen has equaled or bettered Meola for his time with Kansas City.\n\nStatistically, Nielsen has bettered numbers that I wasn't sure another goalkeeper would reach. Playing a similar number of games as Meola (128 league for Nielsen vs 125 for Meola), Nielsen recorded more wins, 57 to 49, had more shutouts 45 to 37, and a lower goals against average .99 to 1.22.\n\nIn all competitions, Meola made more appearances than Nielsen 156 to 142, but Nielsen topped him in wins 65 to 63, shutouts, 52 to 47, and GAA .95 to 1.24.\n\nNielsen ends his career as the all time leader in MLS for goals against average for a goalkeeper with over 1,000 minutes played at .99. Meola meanwhile retired as the MLS all time leader in basically every category a goalkeeper could hold.\n\nAward wise, Meola leads that category, winning goalkeeper of the year, comeback player of the year, league MVP and MLS Cup MVP all in 2000, where he set a number of a single season records. Nielsen topped many of those records in 2012 on his way to winning goalkeeper of the year in 2012. One he didn't top was Meola's single season shutout record of 16.\n\nThe other thing that both players will likely be judged on is their performance in the league's marquee game, MLS Cup. For me this one isn't an argument, although I've had people go the opposite way. For me, the better performance goes to Meola. Nielsen made some big saves, including two in the PK shootout, but I don't think you can top Meola's 10 save performance. While Nielsen made the two penalty stops, and the mystique of doing it with 2 broken ribs will surely help his argument, the rest of his game was not that good. He got beaten to the near post, which most goalkeepers will tell you is a cardinal sin, on RSL's goal, and was saved by the goalkeepers best friend, the post, on three other chances by Salt Lake. The first by Robbie Findley in a situation very similar to the one Findley scored on when the teams met in the regular season. The second a long range effort by Kyle Beckerman that bounced and hit the post, although Nielsen may have had it covered. The third he was left to watch Javier Morales' curling shot hit the base of the post and some how curl around the opposite post.\n\nNow to be fair, Meola was also saved by his cross bar on an effort by Diego Gutierrez, oddly in a situation the exact opposite of Findley's miss for Salt Lake. Instead of coming off his line to attempt to punch a ball clear, Meola stayed at home, but Gutierrez missed.\n\nIn the end I think Nielsen will likely go down as the better keeper for KC, eventually taking his place as a Sporting Legend. But Meola is not that far behind Nielsen.\n\nComets Top Ambush for Third Time\n\nSo far this year, the Missouri Comets have been in control of the rivalry with their cross state rival, the St. Louis Ambush. The teams had met twice already this season, both in St. Louis with the Comets coming out on top of both of those games. Today at the Independence Events Center the two teams met for the first time on this side of the state. The end result wasn't different though as the Comets pulled off an 11 point win, winning 24-13.\n\nThe Comets jumped out to an early lead as just a minute 24 seconds in John Sosa was played in behind the Ambush defense. His shot was saved by Jeff Richey, but the rebound fell to Bryan Perez who took a touch and fired a shot that hit the post, bounced off Richey and into the net to make it 2-0. Just over the half way point in the first quarter the Comets doubled their lead. Byron Alvarez started a counter by blocking an Ambush shot. Alvarez raced down the field before playing the ball to Ramoe Palmer who beat Richey to make it 4-0. The Comets continued to get chances as they pushed the game and with just under four minutes left in the quarter they added another. After some nice possession, the ball was played to Perez at the back post. Perez played the ball back across goal where Stefan St. Louis beat Richey to the ball and was able to get the ball to loop into the net. Before the quarter was over the Comets added another. After some possession in the Ambush end, the Comets turned the ball over. But before the Ambush crossed the midfield line, Brian Harris won the ball back. Harris played the ball wide to Vahid Assadpour. Assadpour played the ball across the field to Perez who played it to the back post for Alvarez who had a tap in to make it 8-0.\n\nThe second quarter saw St. Louis start to come into the game. Just over three minutes into the half, the Ambush got on the board as Mike Mesle fired from 3 point range. Danny Waltman in Missouri's net was blocked and didn't see the shot until late and the Ambush cut the lead to five. A couple minutes later they cut the lead to three as the Comets turned the ball over in their half of the field. Jeff DiMaria played the ball behind Missouri's defense to Odaine Sinclair. Sinclair cut around the on rushing Waltman and rolled the ball into the empty net. That'd be as close as the Ambush would get though. Less than a minute after the Ambush goal, Milan Ivanovic received the ball on the side of the field and fired a shot to the back post was Alvarez was lurking to turn the ball home and make it 10-5. Then just over nine minutes into the quarter, Perez had his second goal of the game. Perez worked a 1-2 with Leo Gibson before chipping the ball over Richey to make it 12-5. The Ambush cut the lead to five again as Dimaria got a goal off a nice restart, sprinting onto a ball played into the box and hammering it home.e But before the half the Comets restored the lead to seven. A Sosa three pointer was saved by Richey but it went right to Lucas Rodriguez who headed the ball in to make the half time score 14-7.\n\nThe third quarter saw the Comets continue to control the game and get the majority of shots. Just under three minutes in the Comets had another goal. Ramone Palmer stole the ball off the foot of an Ambush attacker and was able to beat Richey to make the score 16-7. A couple minutes later the Comets found themselves on the power play, but it was the Ambush that found the net. After some sloppy play in the back, DiMaria beat Waltman top shelf to make it a seven point game again.\n\nThe fourth quarter again saw the Comets get another goal early. Gibson got in behind St. Louis' defense, but could not his chip over Richey. Gibson collected the rebound though and after digging it out of the corner fired it back into the middle. Richey got a touch but the ball came to Sosa who knocked the ball home to make it 18-9. The Ambush continued to stick around. About two minutes later, Corey Adamson got behind Missouri's defense. Waltman made a good first save, but from the ground Adamson was able to knock his rebound home to make it a 9 point game again. A minute and a half later though the Comets found the net again. Perez got his third assist of the night as he played the ball wide to Assadpour who cut around Richey and from a tight angle slide the ball into the net to make it 20-11. Once again the Ambush cut the lead to seven, with DiMaria getting his hattrick, but it wouldn't be enough. The Comets added two more before the end of the game. Assadpour fired in a shot after Sosa played it to him off a restart. Then Gibson got a goal as Sosa played him in 1v1 with Richey and after the goalkeeper had committed low, Gibson went high and made it 24-13. The win was the Comets fourth straight, they'll be back at it next Saturday night against Syracuse.\n\nNielsen Announces His Retirement\n\nA night of celebration for Sporting Kansas City's MLS Cup championship turned a little somber when Sporting goalkeeper and captain, Jimmy Nielsen announced that he was retiring as a professional soccer player.\n\nThe rumors of Nielsen's retirement had started to really gather steam in the few days ahead of the final. Tonight in front of an overflow crowd at Union Station, he made it official.\n\nNielsen will go down as one of the greatest goalkeepers in team history. He retires as the team leader in almost every single goalkeeper category in team history. He recorded more wins in league play (57) than any other keeper and more wins in all competitions (65). He also set team league (45) and all competition (52) shutout records for KC. He set a team record for league appearances and starts (128) and minutes played by a goalkeeper in league play (11,497). In all competitions he finished behind Tony Meola in most of those stats. He also retires tied for the team lead in consecutive league starts for KC, with 90 straight, tied with Kevin Hartman for the most all time. He also retires as the third oldest player to appear in a game for KC at 36 years, 123 days.\n\nWith Nielsen now retiring there are two on field questions for KC to answer. The first is who will mind net for KC next year. Eric Kronberg, the team's longest tenured player would seem to be a favorite, but in but in eight years with the team he has played just 19 games for KC, mainly in the Open Cup and CCL. He does sound like he is wanting to get more starting time, whether that is here or elsewhere remains to be seen.\n\nAnother internal option would be to have KC hand the reigns over to the team's first home grown player, Jon Kempin, but that doesn't seem as likely.\n\nKC could also look within the league for a goalkeeper. A number of keepers could be available. They could look to go after the recently waived Michael Gspurning from Seattle, or local product, Andy Gruenebaum, whose contract was no renewed by Columbus. Another potential play would be to make a trade with Colorado for Matt Pickens, who appears to be on the way out there. Acquiring Pickens though would require more of a trade.\n\nThe other question is who will take up the captain's arm band now that the team's captain has retired. Over the past two years, Nielsen has been the clubs captain, but with his retirement the question is who will step up and replace him. The last player to wear the armband in a game not named Jimmy Nielsen ,was Besler in the team's last CCL group game. Besler would seem to be the favorite to pick up and become the leader of the team.\n\nCongrats to the White Puma on a fantastic career that spanned 20 years and he goes out where all athletes would love to go out at, on top.\n\nMLS Cup Dreams Come True in Sporting Blue\n\nSporting KC are once again MLS Cup champions after a 10 round penalty kick shoot out against Real Salt Lake at Sporting Park 1-1 (7-6).\n\nA few weeks ago, Sporting Park hosted the coldest game in MLS history (since they started tracking), that record fell yesterday with the temperature at 20 degrees. It fell over the course of the game, especially once the sun went down. With the cold temperatures, the play on the field suffered, especially in the first half as it seemed like both of teams were trying to adjust to the cold while also getting the early nerves out. KC suffered a big blow just the 8th minute when they had to sub out midfielder, Oriol Rosell after he hurt his ankle in a challenge. The games first good opportunity came in the 25th minute for KC. Graham Zusi played a ball into the box where CJ Sapong had gotten between two Salt Lake defenders. Sapong got his header on goal, but Nick Rimando got down well and pushed the shot away for a corner kick. RSL really should have grabbed the lead a few minutes later. Off a long ball into the box, Jimmy Nielsen came out to attempt to punch it clear but did not get enough on it. The ball fell to Robbie Findley at the back post for RSL. Unlike when the teams' first met and Findley put away a similar opportunity. This one he put right into the near post from a tough angle and the ball bounced into the grateful arms of Nielsen. In stoppage time in the first half KC had another good opportunity. A free kick by Zusi was only partially cleared to Matt Besler. Besler played a ball back over the top to Dom Dwyer, who chested the ball down but by the time he turned to shoot, Rimando had closed down and the shot was blocked.\n\nEarly in the second half, Sporting had another great opportunity to take the lead. Another Zusi free kick was lofted into the box, it landed at the feet of Sapong. His first touch carried him past his defender, but with space to shoot he fired his shot over the bar. RSL though started to get more of the play and pressure the ball further up the field. The pressure paid off as they scored in the 52nd. An errant pass by KC fell to Kyle Beckerman who played a no look pass over the top to Alvaro Saborio. Saborio brought it down with his chest/arm, and fired a shot that beat Nielsen to the near post giving RSL the lead. As KC pushed numbers forward trying to find an equalizer, Salt Lake looked to hit on the counter. In the 62nd they almost got a second. after Findley raced forward at KC's defense. He then laid the ball back and it went to Beckerman. The US national teamer fired a shot that took a slit deflection and bounced past Nielsen but ended up hitting the post and bouncing back into play. Luis Gil collected the rebound and squared the ball towards Saborio, but Gil was offside when Beckerman's shot was taken. KC's pressure continued but it was RSL that continued to get the better chances and in the 73rd the post again came to KC's rescue. Again it was findley leading the break. This time he squared the ball into the middle for Javier Morales. Morales turned and tried to curl a shot towards the net. Nielsen acted like it was going wide of the goal but it hit the post. The ball bounced back into play and curled around the opposite post for a goal kick. Just an incredibly odd bounce of the ball. Shortly after KC finally got their pressure to pay off. Off a corner kick, KC equalized. Zusi's corner found Aurelien Collin who out jumped Chris Schuler and headed the ball past Rimando and into the net. KC continued to pressure looking for a winner and almost got caught on the counter again. With numbers pushed forward for a corner, Salt Lake sprung a break with Ned Grabavoy. The midfielder raced into KC's half of the field with only Nielsen in front of him. Seth Sinovic raced back, recovering and knocking the ball away for a corner, a fantastic recovery from KC's left back.\n\nThe first period of extra time started out quickly. Findley thought he'd given RSL an early lead, but was ruled out for being offside. Shortly after at the other end of the field, KC had a penalty shout as Sapong went out after a challenge from Schuler. No foul was called and replays showed that it was a bit of embellishment from Sapong. In the 93rd KC had their best chance of extra time. A long throw from Matt Besler was headed by Schuler into the path of Zusi who one timed a volley on goal but Rimando did very well tipping the ball over the bar. KC continued to get the better of the play in extra time and in the 102nd had another good opportunity. A long ball by Paulo Nagamura was played into the box for Claudio Bieler. Bieler beat Nat Borchers to the ball and headed it into the path of Sapong who shot with Schuler right on his back but his shot went just over the bar. Salt Lake again thought they had the lead in extra time in the 105th minute. Sporting gave the ball away in their end of the field to Ned Grabavoy. He played the ball wide to Findley who crossed the ball to Saborio. The Costa Rican headed the ball in, but was ruled offside. The second period of extra time saw both teams continue to pressure, but neither was able to find a goal and again a cup final with KC was to be decided from the spot.\n\nSporting shot first and Bieler stepped up and sent Rimando the wrong way. Saborio came up for RSL's first attempt. He couldn't level things though, putting his effort over the bar. Up second for KC was Nagamura. He too sent Rimando the wrong way and KC was up again. Grabavoy was Salt Lake's second shooter. He fired a shot to Nielsen's right, but the Dane dove down and made the save. After two rounds, KC was up 2-0 and looked good for the cup. Besler stepped up for KC's third PK. He shot to Rimando's left, but the Salt Lake keeper made the save. Beckerman gave Salt Lake a life line with their third attempt, cutting the lead to 2-1. Benny Feilhaber took KC's fourth attempt, going right up the middle, beating Rimando with pace to make it 3-1. Substitute Joao Plata took Salt Lake's fourth, needing to make it to keep their hopes alive, he put his shot high in to the net to make it 3-2. Zusi stepped up to take KC's fifth PK, a goal would win it. Zusi's effort though hit the top of the cross bar and went over. Morales stepped up as RSL's fifth taker, looking to force sudden death PKs. Morales went with the stutter step, sending Nielsen the wrong way and leveling the PKs at 3-3.\n\nInto sudden death PKS we went. Sinovic stepped up first for KC, sending Rimando the wrong way again making it 4-3. Schuler took RSL's sixth attempt, sending it right down the middle as Nielsen dove left. Sapong stepped up for the seventh round, again getting Rimando to lean the wrong way as he went to Rimando's right making it 5-4. Tony Beltran stepped up for RSL. Nielsen guessed right going to his right, but Beltran put the PK off the post and in to level things at 5-5. Lawrence Olum, who subbed on in place of the injured Rosell went eighth. Olum though put his effort wide of the net. Sebastian Velasquez stepped up as the eighth shooter for RSL with the chance to win it. Velasquez though telegraphed where he was going, looking to Nielsen's right, looking down at the ball and again looking up to Nielsen's right. The Dane made the easy save, keeping the scores level at 5-5. Chance Myers stepped up with the ninth attempt for KC going to Rimando's left as he dove the opposite direction making it 6-5. Borchers went next for RSL again going up the middle, but this time Nielsen almost got his leg on it. With the tenth attempt, Collin stepped up for KC. Rimando guessed right going to his left, but Collin's PK was too well placed, going into the side netting to make it 7-6. The tenth shooter for RSL was Lovel Palmer. Palmer put his effort into the cross bar and it bounced back into play giving the title to Kansas City.\n\nA final that may have lacked a bit when it came to style of play, certainly lived up to a final when it came to drama and fight.\n\nWizards Man of the Match - Aurelien Collin/Jimmy Nielsen - Collin and Nielsen split the award. Collin for the game tying goal and for burying a perfect shot for the winning PK. Nielsen, while he didn't have a great game, came up huge in the PK shootout, saving two, the big one being on Velasquez in sudden death.\n\nHonorable mention - Seth Sinovic\n\nPlayer Ratings - Nielsen 7, Sinovic 7, Collin 8, Besler 6, Myers 6, Rosell NR, Nagamura 6, Feilhaber 5, Zusi 5, Dwyer 5, Sapong 5. Subs Olum 6, Bieler 6.\n\nIt's Game Day\n\nIt's game day at Sporting Park.For the second year in a row, Sporting KC's home will be hosting a final. Last year, Sporting prevailed over the Seattle Sounders on penalty kicks to win their first trophy since 2004.\n\nAnd while that trophy was important to the team and the fans, this afternoon at Sporting Park is a much bigger game. The MLS Cup final, the highest award in the league. People can argue about the Supporters' Shield and it's importance and the championship, but in the records it shows the MLS Cup winner as the league's champion. Today Sporting have a chance to bring home their second, and add another star to their jersey.\n\nIt's a big day for Sporting. In the 18 years that this team has played, the coverage of this team has never been greater. The support from not just soccer fans, but much of the general sports community has never been higher. I've had people that usually couldn't give two licks about soccer come up and ask me about the game and how we'll do. It's amazing to see how the support for the team has grown with this run. It may not be permanent, but it's a nice step in the right direction, when every night on the news stations in KC they are talking about the game, talking about the importance, talking about how cold it's going to be. In 2004, the last time KC played in MLS Cup, the team was an after thought. So seeing the coverage of the team is fantastic.\n\nKeeping all of them around after the cup, even a little bit, will require a win. It was said best in the video's from last year's Open Cup final; \"you know how starving this town is to see somebody actually life some hardware and win something here.\"\n\nThe Open Cup certainly was a step, but as I said earlier, it's not the league title. That's the thing that is the most important. The Open Cup, other sports fans see as some weird soccer thing.\n\nNow don't think I'm trying to bad mouth our Open Cup last year, I'm not. But the Open Cup has a different meaning. Sporting can try to convey it's importance to the greater community in KC, but again it doesn't have the same meaning as winning the championship. Now, today, Sporting has a chance to do that. And they get that chance in front of their home crowd at Sporting Park.\n\nIt's funny, last year for the Open Cup final I was full of \"The Terror.\" Worried about what would happen, and expecting in the end to be disappointed. This year for the Open Cup final is oddly different. That's not to say that \"The Terror\" is not there this year. Anyone that knows me, knows for a fact that it is there, I'll be worried sick and at times today will be the last person in the world that someone will want to talk to.\n\nBut this year, I have a level of confidence that I didn't have last year. And I think last year's Open Cup did that. Despite comments from some people about KC's lack of experience, I think that final was immense when it comes to experience, especially at home.\n\nI've made a point to state my displeasure in the disappointing home form during the regular season for KC. But I feel the team has learned how they need to perform in knock out games at home, and the key is the Open Cup game. This team is ready for it.\n\nI absolutely have doubts about today, but unlike last year, there is more confidence than doubt. Whether that confidence is misplaced or not, we'll find out today around 5:30-6 o'clock.\n\nLast year I took creative licenses with a quote from the movie Troy, and the team won it's first trophy under the OnGoal regime. I'm going to do that again. OnGoal has done a fantastic job of turning this team around from a team on the cusp of being moved or contracted, to one of the envies of Major League Soccer, now in the words of Jake Taylor, there's only one thing left to do.\n\nMLS Cup is Finally Here\n\nAfter two weeks of wait, tomorrow, MLS Cup is finally here. Sporting KC will take the field at Sporting Park against Real Salt Lake with the chance to win their first MLS Cup since 2000.The match up is going to take place freezing temperatures, with a wind chill as low as the single digits during the game.\n\nIt'll be the second time that these two teams have met this season. Sporting KC won the first match up 2-1. Not a lot can be taken from that game though because both teams were playing without a number of their first team players. Salt Lake was without Kyle Beckerman and Nick Rimando, while Matt Besler and Paulo Nagamura. Other changes have taken place as well, with Chris Schuler starting in centerback now for Salt Lake, while Kei Kamara is no longer with Kansas City.\n\nSalt Lake comes into the game with arguably the more impressive run in the playoffs. They first eliminated the defending champions, LA Galaxy 2-1 on aggregate. Then they looked really impressive taking out the West's top seed, Portland 5-2 on aggregate. Salt Lake will have Alvaro Saborio and Chris Wingert back available for them after they've missed time with injury. They could be down Devon Sandoval, the rookie picked up an injury in training that could keep him out of the game. While Saborio being back is a big boost for Salt Lake, Sandoval's absence will hurt as he'd started to develop a good partnership with Robbie Findley up top.\n\nSporting's in the final after finally overcoming the Houston Dynamo in the Eastern Conference finals. It's KC's first trip to the finals as a member of the Eastern Conference, their prior trips coming when they were in the West. After the way the team has performed over the course of the last two home games, I don't see any reason for the lineup to change. Dom Dwyer will be at the top of KC's forward line with CJ Sapong and Graham Zusi on the wings. The midfield is going to have Benny Feilhaber in front of Oriol Rosell and Paulo Nagamura. While the back line and goalkeeper will be the same that has racked up a number of shutouts all year. That lineup has carried KC against New England and Houston and I see no reason for Peter Vermes to change it up.\n\nNielsen\n\nMyers - Collin - Besler - Sinovic\n\nRosell - Nagamura\n\nFeilhaber\n\nZusi - Dwyer - Sapong\n\nNumber to Remember - 3,310 - That's the number of days since Sporting KC last played in the MLS Cup final, back in 2004. KC lost that game to DC 3-2. If you're looking for the last time KC won, it's been 4,801 days since MLS Cup 2000.\n\nKey Match Up - KC's 3 man midfield vs RSL's diamond - This is where the game will be won and loss. Can KC's three man midfield win out against RSL's diamond? Benny Feilhaber has been superb in the playoffs, as has Paulo Nagamura since his return from injury. KC will need another big game out of those two to deal with the likes of Kyle Beckerman, Luis Gil, and Jaiver Morales in the RSL midfield.\n\nPREDICTION - While KC's at home, they're not getting a ton of love from a lot of the media, including MLS's own editors. RSL is a good team, no doubt about that, it's not going to be an easy game. Like their previous meeting this year, I expect this to be another tight, physical game. I expect a lot of fouls and I expect cards. Like Houston has forced KC to change their style against them, KC has done the same to RSL over the last few years. Their match ups have turned into more physical games and tomorrow won't be different. While RSL is going to make it tough, in the end I think KC just pulls it out.\n\nSKC - 2 (Zusi, Dwyer)\n\nRSL - 1 (Findley)\n\nWeather, SKC vs MU, and Other MLS Cup News\n\nWe're less than 48 hours away from MLS Cup. And with the game so close, there's lots of news coming out as soccer journalists around the US have descended on Kansas City for the final. Here's some news from today as MLS Cup gets closer.\n\nWeather\n\nThis has been one of the big talking points for the last few weeks or so. After last weekend and earlier this week, that had temperatures in the 60's, the bottom has fallen out and temperatures for Saturday are now expected to only be in the 20's for Saturday. It gets even better, with the wind chill, it'll feel like it's in the single digits or below zero. Two weeks ago, KC played in the coldest game since MLS started keeping track in 2003. And Saturday it looks like a new record low could be hit. The expected snow this weekend looks like it'll hold off until Saturday night after the game, which is a good thing, but definitely dress in layers on Saturday.\n\nSKC vs Mizzou\n\nThis has been a topic of discussion since last week when Mizzou defeated Texas A&M and clinched a spot in the SEC title game. That game kicks off in Atlanta at the same time that MLS Cup is set to kick off. With the two games starting at the same time, the conversation has turned to the coverage of both teams. So much so that the Wall Street Journal has made mention of it (albeit poorly in my opinion).\n\nBut let's be serious, Sporting KC is extremely unlikely to get top billing ahead of Mizzou, no matter how the SEC title game ends. Despite the MU/KU (and K-State) split in this city, MU is the larger fan base in the city. And while Sporting KC and soccer in general has made great strides in it's coverage in the media (print, TV, radio) over the past few years, football is still king in this city and country.\n\nThere really shouldn't be debate, unless you're a fan of both teams and not planning to attend one or the other. Then it becomes a debate of which one you watch live (or which one gets the big TV). Other than that, there is no debate here (especially in media coverage).\n\nRetirement Questions\n\nThis shouldn't be a surprising conversation given the hunt by journalists around the city to find a story, but questions have been asked about Jimmy Nielsen's future. In the Guardian, as well as in today's press conference, Nielsen talked about potential retirement after Saturday's game.\n\nThe Guardian got the more in depth answer from Sporting's captain, and Nielsen was very diplomatic in his answer. Nielsen though didn't rule out the possibility of retiring, saying he'll make the decision after the game \"If we win, then the first thing I'm going to do is go on a little vacation with my family. Then I will follow my gut feeling after that.\"\n\nGoing out on top would certainly have it's advantages, but plenty of fans would be disappointed if the White Puma chose to hang them up after the season.\n\nHeineman Letter\n\nLast year before the US Open Cup final against Seattle, Robb Heineman penned a letter to fans that was posted on the team's site, thanking the fans for their support and getting people excited for the final against the Sounders. This year he's done it again with another letter to the fans, and like last year, it has the desired effect. It gets more excitement for the fans and while it does have the general \"rah-rah\" you'd expect, it does speak to the great efforts that Sporting KC have made to endear themselves to the city and fans."
