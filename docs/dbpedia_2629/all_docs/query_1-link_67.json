        "text": "Re: Ecuador's DT\n\nI'm sorry but Jefferson Hurtado and Hidalgo do not belong on that list...especially Jefferson Hurtado.\n\nRe: Ecuador's DT\n\nI agree with that, but at the same time there's not many great players in other clubs....I can point out just about every player from our league that is good enough/has potential to put on that NT jersey (Besides the players that normally do).\n\nLDU-Q: Alexander Dominguez, Miller Bolanos, Jairo Campos, Diego Calderon, and Claudio Bieler (if he gets nationalized)\n\nEl Nacional: Michael Quinonez....Fabricio Guevara and Erick de Jesus have potential\n\nD. Cuenca: Holguer Matamoros, Juan Paredes.....Edison Preciado has potential\n\nEspoli: Miguel Ibarra....Deison Mendez has potential\n\nEmelec: besides Joao Rojas who is normally part of the squad...Angel Mena, Bryan Rodriguez, and Marcos Caicedo all have lots of potential (someone tell Perrone b/c obviously he doesn't know what he has)\n\nBarcelona: Wilson Folleco (who now left), Jefferson Hurtado have potential....Mike Rodriguez needs to leave Barcelona and go somewhere else to meet his potential (he's stuck and doesn't show signs of growth year after year)\n\nD.Quito: Micheal Arroyo (most definitely should be part of our NT next qualifiers if he keeps it up), Michel Castro\n\nLiga de Portoviejo: Manuel Mendoza has potential\n\nOlmedo: Cristian Suarez has potential\n\nManta and Tecnico Universitario....no one really impresses me\n\nRe: Ecuador's DT\n\nBieler could be smart and know that even if he gets called up, he will never replace guys like Tevez, Messi, and Aguero, etc... he knows that. If he is smart, he will become Ecuadorian and play for us. But if he decides to play for his country I don't see anything wrong with that.. It's his country for God's sakes, he is not Ecuadorian so why are we on his nut sacks like that... we have to wait and see what happens that's all.\n\np.s. better yet, if the FEF is smart, they should ask him NOW to become an Ecuadorian seeing as he is positive on becoming Ecuadorian and he will not \"think twice about it\". If Bieler gets called up, then its the FEF's fault for not getting to him before Maradona does. This guy wants to become Ecuadorian. IF the FEF ask him NOW then he is under contract.\n\nLa hinchada de Argentina le pide Bieler a Maradona http://www.terra.com.ec/deportes/articulo/html/dep674104.htm\n\nRe: Ecuador's DT\n\ni echoed these same arguments a few days ago\n\ngood post\n\nRe: Ecuador's DT\n\nI think that chiriboga should straighten out and run things more in a Paz style. About the new coach as Bauza is a pretty good idea, Markarian i dont know too much about, leave Fossati with Liga. However i think that Ecuador should stop thinking about coaches who will try to get us to the world cup, and pick coaches who KNOW how to get us to the world cup. Look at Chile with Bielsa, best decision they ever made. Ecuador has a lot of amazing players, but i think its a matter of formations and where the player is most useful. Chile has an okay crop of players, but Bielsa is doing wonders to make them excel in the areas they are good at, I would look to coaches like JOSE PECKERMAN who isn't currently with anyone, or Bianchi, Basile (who in a weird way like Bielsa also, seems to know about our players and league), Batista. Tell Chiriboga to stop finding the easy way out and saying we need a coach that knows our players... let's begin a new process. He is not going to use the Fifa date in November either. Stop waiting and start now. It may be a little expensive but it'll definitely be worth it. I think Paz should really be head of the FEF. Ecuadorians need to wake up and speak now instead of complaining when nothing goes our way because past desicions scrutinized our options. \"Si eres pequeno suena, si ya eres grande siguelo haciendo.\"\n\nRe: Ecuador's DT\n\nI think starting the process in July isn't a bad idea. Getting eliminated from a World Cup and then starting a process 1-2 months later is a bit harsh on our players. The time gap between now and July is good to give our NT a good time to clear their minds of all the negative results from this past qualifier and get ready for a new era. It will also give us time to spot any new players with potential to be apart of our NT. Starting a process right now would be a sudden change for the whole team.\n\nRe: Ecuador's DT\n\nNot true. He could become Ecuadorian and he could even play for Argentina in a friendly. He only becomes comittied to a national team once he plays for that team in one official FIFA match. Otherwise, it doesn't matter. There is no \"contract\".\n\nThe only way to tie him down is for him to play a minute in Copa America, which are competitive matches in the eyes of FIFA.\n\nRe: Ecuador's DT\n\nYou want to know my honest opinion?? I'd take out either Tevez or Aguero and put in Bieler. Why? Because those three you mentioned are very similar - small, technical and opportunist. With Bieler you have what Argentina (and Ecuador) are currently lacking - a true target man. They haven't had any since Crespo. Julio Cruz never worked out. Now Palermo is there but he's a senior citizen. So frankly if I were Maradona, I'd give him a shot because we all know Palermo is cursed and probably something will happen to keep him out of the World Cup.\n\nAnd as far as getting chances, at least with Argentina he has a chance of playing in the World Cup next year - every player's dream. With Ecuador, at best he may be in the squad for 2014, but there's no guarantee we'll make that one either."
