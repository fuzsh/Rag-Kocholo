        "text": "The Sinopharm vaccine was created using techniques that have been around for decades.\n\n“This is an inactivated vaccine. Simply what it means is that the virus is taken, cultured and inactivated,\" said Dr Nawal Al Kaabi, chair of the UAE's National Covid-19 Clinical Management Committee.\n\n\"What is left is a skeleton of the virus so it looks like a virus, but it is not live.\"\n\nThis is then injected into the body.\n\n\"The body will recognise it and form antibodies but because it is inactive, we will need more than one dose. The body will not develop immunity with one dose,\" she said.\n\n\"You have to be exposed more than one time to what we call the antigen.\"\n\nThe vaccine should offer protection for at least months, but no one knows how long beyond that.\n\nDr Al Kaabi said early vaccine volunteers in China were given shots last spring and still have antibodies today.\n\n“Since it is inactivated, it will not last forever,\" she said."
