        "text": "Are you kidding? I know next to nothing about South American soccer, but still manage to recognize LDU Quito.\n\nEven the damn article linked by the OP mentions him scoring when LDU Quito won the freaking Libertadores.\n\nGood grief, man.\n\nJavier Morales \"failed to perform\" in the Argentine Primera, but has been a decent DP-level player for MLS. Depends on the salary.\n\nThink trick was a bad word on my behalf just don't think he's worth the hype and far below Juninho. Although in terms of overall quality he's an upgrade in terms of MLS talent the problem is he might not get a chance to show it like Milton Caraglio in New England (who is in Chile now and one of the best players in that league).\n\nplease bold the part that says LDU Quito which is what you were ranting about.\n\nJust like UEFA and CONCACAF CL not every team in Copa Libertadores is great either, and players have had good tournaments before, moved to bigger leagues and flopped. I was just wondering how he did in Argentina, b/c if he couldnt make it there he is probably not worth DP\n\nHold up, you think New York signing a 38 year old cast member of the walking dead (see picture below) is a better signing than KC picking up a guy who has played well in recent years at Quito and is 28?\n\nI like this move by KC\n\nIt shows they want a talented player, not a name to come bask in retirement (what Juninho feels like)\n\nJuninho still shows he can play the role of an attacking midfielder based on his goals, assists, touches where Bieler is a striker with a history of scoring goals but of also going in streaks of no goals, causing issues with the team and getting red carded.\n\nIn evaluating players you are not only looking a potential of success but also failure - at worse Juninho can play the Beckham role or get injured (which has never happend in his career) where Bieler can play 20 games with KC and not score a goal. In my opinion he's like Eric Hasali - yes he has talent and has shown he can score but if he isn't scoring he's a detriment to the team especially with the pressure of a DP tag.\n\nHe's had 2 red cards in the last 4 years. I'm not sure why you keep bringing that up.\n\nI admit, I do see he had 3 in the year before that, but he seems to have settled down since then. (Maybe he wasn't getting laid enough that year.)\n\nBesides, most strikers are streaky. Just because Bieler may be a bit streaky doesn't mean he's not worth the risk. (And Hassli was terrible in 2012; that seems a bit harsh to already be comparing Bieler to him.)\n\nThe red card or yellow for that matter show's he has a history of being sometimes an out of control player and MLS has a history of signing players like this who have proven an inability to cope with the MLS game.\n\nI think Hassili is a good comparison - his career stats - http://enbsports.blogspot.ca/2012/07/mls-eric-hassli-joins-toronto-fc.html because Hassli and Bieler have shown when they are key player and on form they can produce an offensive output but when they are not they and the team struggle to find a use for him.\n\nI did my top 10 prospect list for the Ecuador Serie A when their season ended and debated if I should have Bieler in the list I decided not to.\n\nThe List\n\n10. Dennys Quinonez\n\n9. Fernando Gaibor\n\n8. Arrinton Mina\n\n7. Jose Madrid\n\n6. Marlon De Jesus\n\n5. Ariel Nahuelpan\n\n4. Frickson Erazo\n\n3. Damian Diaz\n\n2. Enner Valencia\n\n1. Carlos Feraud\n\nGranted most of these players are a lot younger than Bieler so they have a greater market value then him although when you broke down his output last season and his career he doesn't have a huge upside.\n\nI do watch the MLS for talent so I hope I'm wrong.\n\nMy roommate is from Ecuador. He grew up cheering for LDU Quito, and continues to. We've streamed many games. I can assure you he would disagree with your later statement. The Ecuadorian League is no Premier League or Brazilian League, but its definitely good soccer. He would say better than MLS. I am on the fence, however I also only joined him for a handful of games. Judging by what I've watched, and knowing his extensive soccer knowledge (a true South-American fan who follows more leagues than I do) I tend to accept his analysis.\n\nLDU Quito is probably the top team from Ecuador, and has competed frequently at the international level. That being said, they were hardly walking all over other teams. The competition was fierce, from what I saw. Many clubs can compete with LDU Quito, and I would wager that LDU Quito would very likely beat the majority of MLS Teams with little effort.\n\nAs for Bieler, my roommate's line is that he is a \"great striker, great pickup for MLS.\" He claims his drop in quality was largely because LDU Quito having a rough year, particularly in the later half of the season. How he actually ends up performing remains to be seen, but I am optimistic.\n\ni mentioned in another thread how i think Ecuador and Colombia and Chile are places that MLS should look at finding players as there are some NTers who still play domestically.\n\ni noticed that your list doesn't have Deigo Calderon on it? he has some NT caps, there were a couple of stories about potential MLS interest and he plays for LD Quito ... is he not any good? i thought he'd be one of the top 1o players in the ECU league? i also think Michael Arroyo would be a good target, lots of NT experience at only 25, is he not top 10? Juan Carlos Paredes? Luis Saritama?"
