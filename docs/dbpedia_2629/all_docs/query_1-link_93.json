        "text": "KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) â€” Claudio Bieler scored two goals, the second on a penalty kick, and Jimmy Nielsen recorded his club-record 38th career shutout as Sporting Kansas City beat Chivas USA 4-0 on Sunday.\n\nNielsen didn't have to make a save in earning his league-leading sixth shutout this season. He broke a tie for the career club mark he shared with Tony Meola.\n\nBieler's spot kick, which put Sporting up 2-0 in the 57th minute, came after Chivas goalkeeper Dan Kennedy was shown a red card for pulling down Paulo Nagamura in the area. Bieler also scored in the 41st minute.\n\nGraham Zusi, who had an assist on Bieler's first score, had a goal in the 65th minute goal for Sporting (5-3-2), which snapped a two-match losing streak, and C.J. Sapong scored his first goal of the season in the 87th.\n\nChivas (3-4-2) is 0-3-1 over its last four.\n\nZusi's assist was his fourth of the year, moving him into a first-place tie with Real Salt Lake's Joao Plata.\n\nKennedy will be suspended for Chivas' match May 12 at Portland."
