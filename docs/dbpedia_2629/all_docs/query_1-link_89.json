        "text": "Chicago Fire\n\nTraded Dominic Oduro to the Columbus Crew in exchange for Dilly Duka and the rights for Robbie Rogers, who is currently playing in Europe. Apparently Rogers hasn't been watching his twitter feed over the last week and isn't too keen on MLS policy.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Just read my \"rights\" were traded to Chicago... Love how the MLS works, pretty funny.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23rightlessinthemls\">#rightlessinthemls</a></p>&mdash; Robbie Rogers (@robbierogers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robbierogers/status/298480460336607232\">February 4, 2013</a></blockquote>\n\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nChivas USA\n\nSpeculation that Juan Agudelo would be traded to Celtic in the SPL faded as the January transfer window closed however talks have now moved to his possible transfer in the summer window. Oddly enough, Chelis told reporters last week that he had yet to meet the young striker who has been overseas on trial and was then called into national team camp.\n\nD.C. United\n\nAndy Najar transfered to R.S.C. Anderlect in Belgium. He is the first MLS homegrown player to make the move to Europe which means he will have a lot of eyes on him as the first export of the homegrown experiment.\n\nFC Dallas\n\nOh MLS you did that to me on purpose. After the Brek Shea deal to Stoke was declared dead the deal apparently found new life as the winger was signed on the final day of the transfer window. Shea went for a reported $3.9 million transfer fee and a four and a half year contract. His work permit was approved and I have no clue what is going on with his hair.\n\nKenny Cooper returnth. In a move that surprised some people, but had others going it's about time, the forward returns to Dallas where he first started his career. The Red Bulls gave him up for an unknown amount of monopoly money (aka allocation money) as well as a second-round pick in the 2014 Draft.\n\nMontreal Impact\n\nWho is currently glad they aren't members of the Impact? Anyone who doesn't like to eat bugs. Apparently bug eating is part of team building. Bug eating starts at 3:00.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/82wvpV0Ug2o\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nHungry anyone?\n\nNew York Red Bulls\n\nNamed Robin Fraser as the new assistant coach. Fraser was the head coach of the disaster known as Chivas USA for the past two seasons.\n\nThe team has now 86'd 16 players this off season with the departure of Kenny Cooper. Moral of the story? Get along with Thierry Henry.\n\nPortland Timbers\n\nMutually parted ways with Kris Boyd in a move that surprised no one.\n\nReal Salt Lake\n\nHave former Galaxy Goalkeeper Josh Saunders on trial, bringing the total to five keepers in their training camp this off season. Clearly they are looking for a quality back up as one can expect their number one keeper Nick Rimando to be gone some with the national team as he appears to be a Klinsmann favorite to back up Tim Howard.\n\nSporting Kansas City\n\nKei Kamara has gone on loan to Norwich City until May with Norwich having the option to buy him. The team see this as an opportunity to either cash in if the team decides to keep him or get back what is considered one of their strongest players with some EPL experience under his belt. It feels like SKC has spent much of this off season sending their top players to Europe while bringing in...well... Benny Feilhaber.\n\nOkay okay they brought in Claudio Bieler too.\n\nToronto FC\n\nH.C. Ryan Nelsen has finally ended his playing career and is now actually coaching Toronto. This ends the fun speculation of how he would coach the team from England while still playing with QPR."
