Bieler also scored in the 41st minute.\n\nGraham Zusi, who had an assist on Bieler’s first score, had a goal in the 65th minute goal for Sporting (5-3-2), which snapped a two-match losing streak, and C.J. Sapong scored his first goal of the season in the 87th.\n\nChivas (3-4-2) is 0-3-1 in its past four."
