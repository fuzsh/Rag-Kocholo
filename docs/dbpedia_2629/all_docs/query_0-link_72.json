The match took place at the International Stadium of Yokohama, Japan, on 21 December 2008, and pitted LDU Quito of Ecuador, the CONMEBOL club champions, and Manchester United of England, the UEFA club champions. Despite going down to 10 men early in the second half, Manchester United won the match 1–0 thanks to a 73rd-minute goal from Wayne Rooney.[3]\n\nRoad to Yokohama[]\n\nBoth Manchester United and LDU Quito qualified for the competition at the semi-final stage, after winning their respective continental competition, the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League and the 2008 Copa Libertadores.\n\nQuito's opening game was against Mexican side Pachuca, who had defeated Egyptian club Al-Ahly 4–2 in the quarter-finals after extra time.[4] Their semi final match was played at the National Stadium in Tokyo on 17 December 2008.[5] LDU Quito scored two goals in the first 26 minutes, through Bieler and Bolaños, securing a place in the Club World Cup final of 2008.[6]\n\nManchester United's semi-final opponents were Gamba Osaka, who had previously defeated Australian A-League premiers and Asian Champions League runners-up, Adelaide United, 1–0 to move into the second semi-final on 18 December.[7] Vidić and Ronaldo opened the scoring in the first half, putting Manchester United ahead by two goals at half time. Yamazaki was the next to score, in the 74th minute, to bring Gamba back into the competition, but Rooney scored twice and Fletcher once, within the next five minutes to extend United's lead. Endō converted an 85th minute penalty kick and Hashimoto got a third for Gamba just minutes before the final whistle. The end result was 5–3, taking Manchester United forward to the final.[8][9]\n\nMatch[]\n\nDetails[]\n\n21 December 2008\n\n19:30 UTC+9\n\n0–1 International Stadium, Yokohama\n\nAttendance: 68,682[1]\n\nReferee: Ravshan Irmatov (Uzbekistan)[1] Report Rooney Goal 73'\n\nMan of the Match:\n\nFile:Flag of England.svg Wayne Rooney (Manchester United)[2]\n\nAssistant referees:\n\nFile:Flag of Uzbekistan.svg Abdukhamidullo Rasulov (Uzbekistan)[1]\n\nFile:Flag of Kyrgyzstan.svg Bahadyr Kochkorov (Kyrgyzstan)[1]\n\nFourth official:\n\nFile:Flag of Japan.svg Yuichi Nishimura (Japan)[1]\n\nMatch rules\n\n90 minutes.\n\n30 minutes of extra-time if necessary.\n\nPenalty shoot-out if scores still level.\n\nTwelve named substitutes.\n\nMaximum of three substitutions.\n\nStatistics[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nFIFA Club World Cup Japan 2008, FIFA.com\n\nTechnical Report and Statistics (PDF), FIFA.com\n\n{{{header}}} {{{body}}}\n\n{{{header}}} {{{body}}}\n\n{{{header}}} {{{body}}}\n\nes:Final de la Copa Mundial de Clubes de la FIFA 2008 fa:فینال جام باشگاه‌های جهان ۲۰۰۸ pt:Final da Copa do Mundo de Clubes da FIFA de 2008 ru:Финал Клубного чемпионата мира по футболу 2008 sk:Majstrovstvá klubov FIFA 2008 – Finále tr:2008 FIFA Dünya Kulüpler Kupası Finali"
