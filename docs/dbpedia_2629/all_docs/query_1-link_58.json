        "text": "Ecuador's Liga de Quito stormed into the final of the Club World Cup on Wednesday with a 2-0 defeat of Mexico's Pachuca, setting up a potential clash with Manchester United.\n\nIn persistent rain, Claudio Bieler and Luis Bolanos did the damage with first-half goals for the South American champions.\n\nLiga can now look forward to a final against either Manchester United or Japan's Gamba Osaka, who play their semi-final in Yokohama on Thursday.\n\nLiga started at a furious pace and were ahead after just four minutes when striker Bieler capitalised on a defensive blunder.\n\nThe Argentine pounced when a Pachuca clearance bounced off the legs of one of their own defenders and into his path and he slid the ball underneath diving goalkeeper Miguel Calero.\n\nIt took Pachuca 10 minutes to wake up but when they did they were unlucky not to level the game.\n\nA break down the left by Jose Cardenas fed Damian Alvarez who played the ball into the box but after a goalmouth scramble Liga eventually cleared.\n\nPachuca though appeared anxious and Julio Manzur was booked for handball on the edge of the penalty area on 25 minutes.\n\nLiga took a decisive 2-0 lead from the resulting freekick when Bolanos curled the ball round the wall with his right foot from 25 yards, giving no chance to Calero, whose view was blocked.\n\nCONCACAF champions Pachuca nearly pulled one back minutes later when Jose Cardenas appeared to be shoved from behind as he went to head into an empty net, but the referee waved play on.\n\nWith 70 percent possession in the first half, Pachuca should have done better. They went to the break 2-0 down in their quarter-final against Egypt's Al Ahly and won 4-2, but it wasn't to be against Liga.\n\nThey pushed forward in the second half with Liga seemingly content to defend their lead, but Pachuca couldn't find the elusive goal despite a series of chances and the match descended into a scrappy encounter.\n\nHistorically one of the strongest teams in Ecuador, Liga blew a glorious chance to add a third goal in the dying seconds when substitute Reinaldo Navia blasted over the bar with just the keeper to beat."
