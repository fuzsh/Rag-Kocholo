        "text": "Preseason Recap – Indy Eleven 2 : 0 Tourbeau Soccer Academy\n\nForward Pedro Mendes Bags Pair of Goals in Indy Eleven’s Hoosier State Exhibition Opener\n\nWESTFIELD, IN (Saturday, March 15, 2014) – Indy Eleven opened the local portion of its spring exhibition schedule tonight by posting a 2-0 victory over the Tourbeau Soccer Academy at Westfield High School.\n\n“Tonight we saw some good things, some spells where we’re finally seeing the pieces are starting to come together,” said Indy Eleven Head Coach Juergen Sommer. “In the next month, having these types of games will allow us to develop chemistry and push training to another level of intensity as we continue to get fitter and get stronger.”\n\nEleven forward Pedro Mendes continued his impressive preseason form by netting both Indy Eleven goals, the first coming just 11 minutes in courtesy of an assist from fellow striker Mike Ambersley. After beating a defender and finding space on the end line, Ambersley slotted a ball back towards a waiting Mendes, who one-timed the pass into the back of the net from eight yards out.\n\nDespite controlling a majority of possession in the first half, Indy Eleven struggled to find attacking opportunities. It was again Mendes who provided the home team with the most dangerous scoring opportunity of the half when his 25-yard free kick in the 20th minute was ushered wide of the right post by Tourbeau goalkeeper Vignir Johannesson.\n\nThe Indy Eleven backline kept things tidy in front of goalkeeper Kristian Nicht, who went the full 90 minutes – the first 45 minutes during which he was largely untested. That changed coming out of the locker room, as the German made a stop on Tourbeau’s first advance up the field, which was quickly followed by another Mendes effort from the top of the area that whizzed just wide of frame.\n\nMendes would finally bag his brace two minutes from full time. After beating two defenders on a run up the left flank, defender Kyle Hyland played a pinpoint cross to the top of the six-yard box, where Mendes pulled himself behind the defense and finished the low cross with his head.\n\nMatch Notes\n\nIndy Eleven had 14 of its 16 signed players on hand, with only Tuesday’s newly-announced additions – midfielder Corby Moore and forward Ben Spencer – not available for the contest.\n\nWith his brace this evening, Mendes has now scored five of Indy Eleven’s seven goals in exhibition contests this spring.\n\nTonight’s game was help in conjunction with the Westfield Soccer Showcase and served as a fundraiser for both the Westfield Youth Soccer Association and the Indiana Soccer Foundation, the latter of which is working with Indy Eleven to build a futsal field at an Indianapolis park for use by the entire community.\n\nIndy Eleven will take to the road for its next exhibition match, taking place next Saturday, March 22, against the University of Louisville Cardinals. Kickoff from Cardinal Park in Louisville is set for 7:00 p.m. ET.

(Wednesday, February 26, 2014) – Indy Eleven used a pair of goals by forward Pedro Mendes to carry a lead into halftime of its preseason rematch with Sporting Kansas City, but the defending MLS Cup champions pulled away in the second half to record a 4-2 win in a scrimmage contested at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex.\n\nMidfielder Claudio Bieler was a menace once again against Indy Eleven, as the “Designated Player” netted Sporting KC’s first three goals before playing provider on its final tally in the 90-minute affair.\n\n“Giving away a couple of penalty kicks is unfortunate, but we’re learning and moving forward and creating opportunities in front of goal and scoring some goals against quality competition,” said Indy Eleven Head Coach Juergen Sommer. “Even in the second half when we lost the lead there were some good signs, some long spells where we had a number of consecutive touches and were able to move it around the park effectively. I think this game – and the previous games – will really help our guys prepare mentally and physically for our challenge in the league starting in April.”\n\nIn stark contrast to its Arizona camp earlier this month, Indy Eleven brought a limited roster to Florida that, for today’s match, featured only 13 available field players. The Eleven coaching staff’s plans to spread out minutes as widely as possible took a detour after just 15 minutes, when newly-signed center back Andrew Stone was forced from the match with an apparent right hamstring strain and replaced by Baba Omosegbon.\n\nIn the 22nd minute, it was Bieler putting Sporting KC up from the penalty spot, set up after a shot through traffic was handed down by an Indy Eleven defender. The Argentine would finish to the left of Eleven goalkeeper Kristian Nicht to put the MLS outfit up 1-0, but Indy would bounce right back through Mendes just two minutes later. A through ball down the right flank by midfielder Don Smart found another of yesterday’s new signings, defender Chris Estridge, whose service into the area was finished off by Mendes for the quick equalizer.\n\nAfter a couple of big saves by Nicht kept things level over the next 15 minutes – including a 1-v-1 stop on Bieler in the 28th minute – another play down the right channel would push Indy into the lead. It was Mendes finishing off Smart’s low cross with a first-time re-direct from eight yards out, his shot bouncing off the hands of SKC goalkeeper Devala Gorrick and giving the Eleven a 2-1 advantage it would bring into the halftime break.\n\nIndy Eleven nearly increased its lead right after the sounding of the second half whistle when DF Kyle Hyland connected on a snap header that beat Gorrick to the far right post, but his shot bounced off the woodwork and right to the thankful KC ‘keeper.\n\nThree minutes later it was Bieler finishing from 12 yards out to even things up at 2-2, and the Argentine’s second finish from the penalty spot in the 68th minute, set up by another handball in the Indy Eleven area, would give Kansas City the lead once again at 3-2. After finishing off his hat trick, Bieler would provide the assist on KC’s final tally in the 72nd minute, when he slipped Mikey Lopez behind the Eleven backline for a 1-v-1 finish past Nicht from 12 yards out.\n\nIndy Eleven will train at the University of Central Florida for the next two days before getting back to scrimmage action this Saturday, March 1 against the Columbus Crew. Indy Eleven fifth consecutive contest against Major League Soccer competition is set for a 10:00 a.m. ET kickoff back at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex and can be followed via the team’s @IndyElevenLive in-game update Twitter feed.\n\nIndy Eleven Preseason Scrimmage #4 (90 minutes)\n\nIndy Eleven (NASL) 2 : 4 Sporting Kansas City (MLS)\n\nESPN Wide World of Sports Complex – Kissimmee, Fla.\n\nWednesday, February 26, 2014\n\nScoring Summary:\n\nSKC – Claudio Bieler (penalty kick) 22’\n\nIND – Pedro Mendes (Chris Estridge) 24’\n\nIND – Pedro Mendes (Don Smart) 38’\n\nSKC – Claudio Bieler (Adnan Gabeljic) 49’\n\nSKC – Claudio Bieler (penalty kick) 68’\n\nSKC – Mikey Lopez (Claudio Bieler) 72’\n\nDiscipline Summary:\n\nIND – Pedro Mendes (caution; reckless challenge) 15’\n\nIndy Eleven Line-up (4-2-3-1): Kristian Nicht; Chris Estridge, *J.

(Wednesday, February 12, 2014) – Indy Eleven closed out the scrimmage portion of its first training camp against Major League Soccer’s Portland Timbers FC, which used a goal by midfielder Ben Zemanski in the 75 th minute to post a 1-0 victory over the expansion North American Soccer League side. Tonight’s scrimmage was a 90-minute affair contested at the Kino Sports Complex.\n\nDespite its first ever preseason camp going on the record as winless at 0-3-0, Indy Eleven again showed more signs of progress against a game Portland side which, like the Eleven, used the match to get one last look at trialists and younger players hoping to make an impact on their squad.\n\n“We stayed competitive for most of the 90 minutes out there. There were some slumps from time to time, but we were really pleased with what we saw tonight,” said Indy Eleven Head Coach Juergen Sommer. “We set up the group to get a look at a certain amount of guys that we really wanted to give some extra time to and get a good last impression in our mind before we have some final conversations. Tonight’s game really served its purpose, and for most of the game we were there on Portland’s level or pretty close to it.”\n\nIn similar fashion to its scrimmages against Vancouver and Kansas City last week, some nervous moments in the Indy Eleven back half allowed the Timbers some early chances. Unlike previous matches, however, the Eleven backline shored things up quickly and allowed the attack to possess and create with greater frequency.\n\nAs the first 45 minutes went on the Hoosier State squad ratcheted up the pressure, alternating shots from outside the area with multiple dangerous crosses off of set pieces that, despite providing plenty of danger, would fail to find the target. On the other end of the field, Indy Eleven would post its first shutout half of the preseason, frustrating Portland by keeping the score at 0-0 heading into the break.\n\nIndy Eleven would see all but one starter come to the bench by the 62 nd minute, as Sommer continued to put a premium on rotating his squad over chasing a result. The game’s lone goal would come when an Eleven trialist committed a foul 25 yards straight out from goal, setting up a free kick opportunity that the fifth-year MLS veteran Zemanski curled outside the Indy wall and into the right side netting, putting the MLS’ers up 1-0. Indy Eleven would have a few quality chances to equalize down the stretch, but several saves by Timbers ‘keeper Jake Gleason in the final 15 minutes would keep Indy scoreless for the first time in three matches.\n\nWith tonight’s final whistle comes the end of Indy Eleven’s work trip in Arizona, which began back on Feb. 1. The squad will return to Indianapolis Thursday and settle down in the Hoosier State for nearly two weeks before beginning its next spring training camp in the Orlando area on Feb. 25. The club will release full details on its trip to the Sunshine State in the coming days once the scrimmage portion of the training camp has been finalized.\n\n“I think we’re going to come away with at least five signings out of this trip, which will give our squad a real firm foundation to build on as we go down to Florida,” explained Sommer. “We hope to do more of the same down there, and if we can find some new talent to fold into the group in Orlando we should be in pretty good shape as we head deep into March and prepare for April 12 th .”\n\nIndy Eleven Preseason Scrimmage #3 (90 minutes)\n\nIndy Eleven (NASL) 0 : 1 Portland Timbers FC (MLS)\n\nKino Sports Complex – Tucson, AZ\n\nWednesday, February 11, 2014\n\nScoring Summary:\n\nPOR –Ben Zemanski (unassisted) 75’\n\nIndy Eleven Line-up (4-3-3): Kristian Nicht (*D.

(Friday, February 7, 2014) – Indy Eleven took a lead against a Major League Soccer opponent for the second game in a row, but the lead was short-lived as defending MLS Cup champion Sporting Kansas City would rally to post a 3-1 victory over the expansion North American Soccer League side. The scrimmage was a 105-minute affair that was contested at the Kino Sports Complex in Tucson.\n\n“We had a great start, and I thought our group was very composed and stayed in the match even after we went behind,” said Indy Eleven Head Coach Juergen Sommer. “We had one or two defensive breakdowns that did come back to bite us, but we were also able to create some chances of our own on the attacking side. I think the camaraderie of the group is starting to show after being together for the last week, so across the board we are pleased with our progress.”\n\nClick here for more post-game reaction from Coach Sommer, midfielder Don Smart and goalkeeper Kristian Nicht.\n\nA “dream start” might not be fitting enough to describe the first minute for Indy Eleven, as the NASL squad went up just 20 seconds into the match. A pair of trialists hooked up on the play, as center back “R. Tipton” (aliases utilized for trialists) sent a ball over the Sporting KC backline and down the right flank for onrushing forward “B. Elkhart.” Noticing Sporting KC goalkeeper Eric Kronberg was off his line, the striker took a first-time shot that dipped under the crossbar and inside the far left post to put the Hoosier State side up 1-0 before some players could even blink.\n\nThe early tally clearly got Sporting’s attention, and a line-up that featured the bulk of the starters from last December’s MLS Cup began to pile up chance after chance in attack. Argentine striker and Designated Player Claudio Bieler would even things up at 1-1 in the ninth minute, when his first time strike off a cut-back pass from defender Seth Sinovic cut through traffic and beat Indy Eleven goalkeeper Kristian Nicht inside his left post. Two minutes later it was forward C.J. Sapong giving Sporting the lead, as he finished off a pass from U.S. Men’s National Team midfielder Graham Zusi at the doorstep to push the MLS outfit in front.\n\nSporting KC would keep the pressure coming, but Nicht would come up big to keep things at 2-1 heading into the break, his stop on Bieler’s header from 10 yards out in the 41st minute marking the highlight of the half for the German netminder. However, it was Kansas City returning the favor in the quick goal category at the start of the second half, as midfielder Sal Zizzo would finish from six yards out just 15 seconds into the second stanza to push the KC advantage to 3-1 in the 46th minute.\n\nAfter a “line change” for both teams at the hour mark, an Indy Eleven unit consisting mostly of trialists and guest players would keep things even over the last 45 minutes – and were unlucky not to cut into the lead. The right post was kind to the MLS’ers down the stretch, as both trialist forward “S. Monroe” and midfielder Don Smart would strike the woodwork in the final 15 minutes, beating KC ‘keeper Andy Gruenebaum only to see their efforts bounce back into play.\n\nAfter two games in three days, Indy Eleven (0-2-0 in preseason) will get a respite from match action for a handful of days before finishing the scrimmage portion of its Arizona schedule back at the Kino Sports Complex next Wednesday, Feb. 12 against another MLS side, Portland Timbers FC.

(Wednesday, February 5, 2014) – The first scrimmage in Indy Eleven history had its highs and lows, but in the end the North American Soccer League expansion side would be downed 3-2 by Major League Soccer’s Vancouver Whitecaps FC in a 90-minute match contested at the Grande Sports World complex. After taking a late lead through midfielder Don Smart in the 70th minute, a pair of goals from Whitecaps striker Omar Salgado in the final 15 minutes would see the MLS outfit push past the Eleven in both teams' first match this spring.\n\n“For the first run out I think we got a little more than we expected out of the group, certainly in terms of the scoring,” said Indy Eleven Head Coach Juergen Sommer. “I could see there were some nerves to work out, but as we settled in we created some really good chances late in the first half. The second half allowed a chance to get a good look at many of the trialists. In the end it was a very productive first match for us, with a lot of things we can build upon as camp continues.”\n\nAfter a tentative first 10 minutes, Indy Eleven would begin to gain some ground and put its stamp on the match through more controlled possession. However, it was Vancouver striking first in the 26th minute, as Ben Fisk intercepted a ball in midfield and rounded onrushing Indy goalkeeper Kristian Nicht before slotting home from a wide angle to put the Canadian club up 1-0.\n\nThe ‘Caps lead was short-lived though, as Indy Eleven forward Pedro Mendes struck off a free kick from 30 yards out just three minutes later, his curling shot sneaking past the wall and inside the right post to even the match up quickly at 1-1. Indy Eleven would push through the rest of the first half with the bulk of the quality chances, with a Mendes header off a Walter Ramirez cross from the left flank marking the best opportunity from either side during the rest of the first 45 minutes.\n\nIndy Eleven would exchange 10 of its 11 players to start the second half, and another rusty start was in order for a group getting their first action together. Indy would eventually settle into an effective counter-attacking style that would create some havoc in the Vancouver attacking end, culminating in the 70th minute with Smart's go-ahead tally. The play looked much like Fisk’s opener for Vancouver, as the Jamaican winger stole a pass 40 yards from goal and finished off his one-on-one opportunity against Whitecaps ‘keeper Patrick McLain from a tough angle to give Indy a 2-1 lead.\n\nThe advantage would hold for just six minutes, as Salgado first finished low and just off the outstretched hand of Eleven ‘keeper Nathan Sprenkel for the equalizer in the 77th minute before heading home from close range to the far left post just four minutes later to cap the scoring.\n\nIndy Eleven will have little rest before getting back to game action this Friday, Feb. 7, when the Hoosier State squad will head south to Tucson for a 120-minute meeting with defending MLS Cup champion Sporting Kansas City. Fans will be able to follow the action from the Kino Sports Complex as it unfolds via updates on the team’s new in-game @IndyElevenLive twitter feed.\n\nINDY ELEVEN HEAD COACH JUERGEN SOMMER\n\nOn using two different line-ups for each half:\n\n“We wanted to use the entire roster so that we could get a good look at how everyone performs under a little bit of pressure. We’ve seen what they can offer in the training sessions across the first few days, but it’s important to see what they do in game situations, so we wanted to get that look right out of the gate. We need to get a gauge with the trialists on what they can bring to the table and how they can complement the group we are building around.”\n\nOn what Indy Eleven will need to improve upon as camp continues:\n\n“The fitness is going to take awhile to get going. That’s expected, I but couldn’t fault the work rate of the guys out there today. Was a good opportunity for the guys to shake off the rust a little bit and get used to the speed of the game again after some time off.”\n\nOn forward Pedro Mendes’ first half goal:\n\n“[Pedro’s] free kick certainly gave us a lift, which we needed after going down a goal. We used some good possession to set it up and Pedro did well with the opportunity on the dead ball. He could have – maybe should have – gotten another goal there right at the end of the half.”\n\nOn the team’s defensive effort:\n\n“Their first goal resulted from a slip by one of our guys, so I can‘t really pick that one apart too much. There were some communication issues that you might expect to see with a group of guys playing together for the first time, and I’m sure we’ll get those worked out as things move forward.”\n\nIndy Eleven Preseason Scrimmage #1\n\nIndy Eleven vs. Vancouver Whitecaps FC (MLS)\n\nGrande Sports World – Casa Grande, AZ\n\nWednesday, February 5, 2014\n\nScoring Summary:\n\n26' VAN – Ben Fisk (Mamadou Diouf)\n\n29' IND – Pedro Mendes (unassisted)\n\n71' IND – Don Smart (unassisted)\n\n77' VAN – Omar Salgado (Mitch Piraux)\n\n81' VAN – Omar Salgado (Sam Adekugbe)\n\nIndy Eleven Line-ups\n\n1st Half (4-3-3): Kristian Nicht; * E.
