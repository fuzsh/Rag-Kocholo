After returning from his loan to English Premier League side Norwich City, Kamara has scored seven goals for Sporting KC, second on the team to Argentine Designated Player Claudio Bieler. Meanwhile, midfielder Graham Zusi leads the team with six assists. Sporting KC has been one of the top teams on the road in the league this season with a +2 goal differential and a record of 5-3-3.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes\n\nEarthquakes Unbeaten in 13 Home Games vs. Sporting Kansas City\n\nThe Earthquakes are riding a 13-game home-unbeaten streak against Sporting Kansas City, a streak that originated in 2001.
