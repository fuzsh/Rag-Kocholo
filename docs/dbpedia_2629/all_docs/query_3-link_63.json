        "text": "Boniek Garcia's unassuming brilliance could decide the Eastern Conference\n\nThe afternoon after Honduras defeated the United States to open the Concacaf Hexagonal, I was clearing security in the San Pedro Sula airport when one of the guards said hello to someone behind me. I turned around and saw Boniek Garcia putting his bag through the metal detector, unnoticed by all except a single guard. The midfielder had starred the previous night in an impressive victory, but walked virtually anonymously through the airport in this soccer-mad country.\n\nGarcia's play for country and club mirrors his unassuming personality. The 5ft 9in midfielder is a staple for the Houston Dynamo, going 90 minutes in every match he has played since joining midway through last year. He's rarely spectacular, but the Honduran international is always efficient. His assist to Will Bruin to open the scoring in Saturday night's 2-0 win over the San Jose Earthquakes showed Garcia at his best. He found space on the right side, beat Justin Morrow (with, it should be said, a little luck), and made a smart, simple low cross into the middle. Bruin easily put it in the back of the net.\n\nThe Dynamo – who extended their home unbeaten streak to 34 games, passing a Real Salt Lake team that didn't lose for 33 matches between 2009 and 2011 for No 1 all-time – are 3-1, and have to be considered Eastern Conference contenders. It's a tough team built for the rigors of the MLS schedule, and Garcia embodies this understated determination. Dominic Kinnear has done it again.\n\nThe Quakes, on the other hand, look a bit lost. Frank Yallop's squad is missing Steven Lenhart, Steven Beitashour, Mehdi Ballouchy and Marvin Chavez, and only just got Alan Gordon back. Seven points from five games isn't bad given the injury-depleted roster, but you have to wonder if lady luck is turning against the west coast club. Newly minted Designated Player Chris Wondolowski, especially, looks out of sorts, failing to tap in a cross in the 68th minute that would have tightened the match significantly. The 2012 Golden Boot winner has two of San Jose's four goals, but the high-scoring offense remains missing. It's early though; no need to panic yet. ND\n\n.\n\nSporting's high pressure pays off\n\nSporting KC were back to their annoying, industrious, feverish, exhilarating and boisterous best when the 100% record of Montreal rolled into town. And the Impact didn't know what hit them. Claudio Bieler opened the scoring early with a clinical finish from Benny Fielhaber's through ball, and in typical fashion, Sporting toyed with the idea of scoring a second goal for the next 70 minutes, before finally doing so 10 minutes from time. Fielhaber grabbed his second assist as returning USMNT hero Graham Zusi finished Montreal off. But once Sporting got ahead early in the game, Montreal didn't stand a chance. The oppressive shutting down of Montreal's attacking options from Rosell, Nagamura and Fielhaber sparked comparisons to the high pressure midfield displays marshaled by Roger Espinoza in seasons gone by.\n\nSKC were back to their best in this one after stalling against Toronto, Chicago and New England. The direct style of their play, roared on by another huge crowd at Sporting Park, unsettled Montreal's defense, and Argentine DP Bieler should have had a hat-trick in the first half. The ingenuity he showed up top is a real plus for Sporting. The bustling forward isn't scared to have a hit, and the sheer variety of the goals he can score must have Vermes buzzing with expectation. Sporting continually switched up their play, short intricate passes were punctuated by long balls in behind Montreal's stretched defense. Ideas were flowing through the men in light blue jerseys.\n\nAlthough the Impact ran out of ideas, their counter-attacking style was never allowed to develop. Sporting sat back, then pounced at perfect opportunities to try and steal the ball away from Patrice Bernier and his midfield partners. Peter Vermes' side played it perfectly. Sporting are back to their formidable best. The pests.\n\nThe Impact still sit top of the pile in the East and have surprised everyone so far. Can they stay there the whole season? Perhaps judging them after a loss in one of the league's toughest venues isn't fair, but the Impact still have a lot of learning to do after a great start. They need to develop a more direct style to use in plan B situations, as the top teams won't let them have the time on the ball they crave to spring a deadly counter-attack. JPW\n\nThe Los Angeles Galaxy might be too good to make MLS fun\n\nThe 2011 and 2012 MLS Cup winners last lost a regular season match before Landon Donovan went to Cambodia, opening the 2013 campaign with a destruction of the Chicago Fire, a draw against resurgent Chivas USA, and a victory over the Colorado Rapids. Somewhere in there the squad also flew to Costa Rica and back, defeating Herediano 4-1 on aggregate to advance to the semi-finals of the Concacaf Champions League. It's been a solid run of form pretty much since the midway point of the 2012 season. The rich got richer on Saturday afternoon when Donovan returned from his walkabout and to the field, entering in the 61st minute for teenager Jack McBean. Left back Todd Dunivant immediately and emphatically handed the captain's armband to the 30-year-old attacker. Then, the match against Toronto FC continued as if nothing had changed.\n\nBecause really, it hadn't. Donovan may have been gone for the opening month, but he wasn't forgotten. And, as LA proved, they are good enough to win without him. While the game against Toronto ended in a 2-2 draw, it's clear that the Galaxy are once again the class of MLS. But does this narrative get boring? While one of MLS's selling points is parity, LA looks dynastic. David Beckham may be gone, but Robbie Keane (when healthy) was always better anyway, and Omar Gonzalez continues to improve, while Dunivant, AJ DeLaGarza, and Sean Franklin round out the more than solid backline. Juninho continues to do his thing, Mike Magee is out of control, and now Donovan is back. Oh, and there's Jose Villarreal, who possesses a vicious left foot and the imagination to match, and McBean, too, and the never-ending pipeline of SoCal soccer talent. No one likes a bully, and LA's getting close to becoming one. Three-peats are fun, but so is competitive balance.\n\nThere was, of course, another team playing at BMO Field on Saturday. Toronto got Luis Silva for the second part of the second half, and the second-year midfielder earned an assist by doing all the hard work on Jonathan Osorio's goal. Rob Earnshaw scored his fourth of the season, showing that his home opener double wasn't a fluke, and the squad generally looks organized and committed, two adjectives that weren't part of the 2012 vocabulary. \"Collapse-prone,\" however, was, and still is. The team that allowed 16 goals in the last 15 minutes of games a year ago did so again on Saturday, watching in horror as defender Darel Russell – who was subtly and brilliantly nudged by Magee – headed the ball back into the middle of the penalty spot and Villarreal scissor-kicked it home. The more things change … ND\n\nDallas are the real deal\n\nThe Hoops are on a roll. With four wins from five, FC Dallas sits atop the Western conference standings and Schellas Hyndman's side look head and shoulders above the 2012 edition.\n\nThat said, their schedule so far has been somewhat favorable. Facing a depleted Rapids squad, followed by the Houston Dynamo coming off a tough Champions League quarter-final defeat and transitional teams in Real Salt Lake and New England, Dallas's fixtures have been kind.\n\nBrek Shea's transfer to Stoke has also played a huge part. Fabian Castillo, Blas Pérez and Jackson have been forced to step up. They all seem more focused and realize they're the main men now that Shea has left the Lone Star State. Dallas desperately needs the aforementioned trio to continue their impressive early season form if they harbor hopes of reaching the playoffs. Against the Revs on Saturday, Dallas got back to their defensive best. That staunch solidity helped Hyndman's side reach MLS Cup 2010. Grabbing late 1-0 wins at places like New England will certainly increase their chances of going back to the big dance.\n\nIntriguing side note, the Revs must've been feeling an impending sense of doom as the minutes ticked on and it remained scoreless at Gillette Stadium. FC Dallas' last three wins against New England have been 1-0 wins, on goals in the 69th minute or later. Blas Pérez duly read the script and popped up with a crucial goal, before falling to his knees and celebrating Easter with a bizarre rabbit-like celebration.\n\nDallas are heading in the right direction. The addition of veterans Kenny Cooper and Michel can't be overlooked. Hyndman has pulled a masterstroke by bringing those two in. A great mix of youth and experience now exists and with Jackson on fire and David Ferreira pulling the strings in behind Pérez, FCD proved they are savvy enough to stay at the West's summit.\n\nAs for New England, their offensive struggles must be worrying for Jay Heaps. A lack of creativity going forward has been ever-present this term and Saër Sène's injury hasn't helped matters. But at least their defense will keep them close in games for the rest of 2013. JPW\n\nBattle of the rebuilds reveal plenty of problems\n\nIf anyone has a four-leaf clover, Colorado's head coach Oscar Pareja would probably pay a lot of money for it right now. The Rapids have had a relentless run of injuries, suspensions and just good old-fashioned bad luck in recent weeks. That trend continued against the Portland Timbers on Saturday.\n\nLeading 2-0 after 48 minutes, Pareja must've thought his fortunes were about to change. But in an absorbing game, two second-half Will Johnson strikes meant the Rapids eventually hung on for their second point of the season.\n\nThe Rapids rebuilding process has seen youngsters Dillon Powers – who scored a belter from 30-yards for his first-ever MLS goal – Chris Klute, Deshorn Brown, Shane O'Neill and Clint Irwin all play prominent roles. Of course that's been accelerated due to excessive absences. First-team regulars Diego Calderon, Martin Rivero, Matt Pickens, Kevin Harbottle, Jamie Smith and Pablo Mastroeni are missing through injury and captain Drew Moor was suspended in last weeks defeat to LA.\n\nWe learned this weekend that Pareja's youngsters have plenty of talent and will – having played against Powers, Irwin and winger Tony Cascio during my college days I've seen first hand how determined these guys are – however a lack of experience prevailed, especially with the game-tying penalty, as Portland sucked Colorado into the trap to snatch a tie.\n\nCascio, Buddle and Brown add pace, skill and finishing up front. If the Rapids can keep them fit, they have half a chance.\n\nAs for Portland, the jury is still out on whether Caleb Porter's side is moving in the right direction. They've tied three of their first four games and were behind in all three, twice by two goals. That shows the fight and spirit the Timbers possess and Porter is developing a team that's hard to beat. Those are the positives. But having a defense that consistently concedes early and often won't match the lofty ambitions of fans and outspoken owner Merritt Paulson. Paulson was so surprised the Timbers received a penalty on Saturday, he tweeted about it. In 2012 they were just the fourth team in league history to go a whole season without getting a penalty kick. So that's a plus. Maybe their luck's changing and the Timbers will grab their first win of 2013, soon."
