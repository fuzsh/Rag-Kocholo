        "text": "(CNN) -- Manchester United will be without central defender Nemanja Vidic for the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie against Italian champions Inter Milan.\n\nSerbian international Vidic was given a one-match ban after being sent off in the Club World Cup final in Yokohama on December 21.\n\nVidic was shown red for swinging an elbow into the face of LDU Quito's Claudio Bieler and was facing the possibility of a three-game suspension.\n\nBut a FIFA disciplinary panel on Friday confirmed a one-match ban.\n\nUnited have no right of appeal and Vidic has also been fined 5,000 Swiss francs.\n\nVidic, a key member of United's watertight defense, will miss the first leg against Inter at the San Siro on February 24.\n\nInter and former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho claimed Vidic should have been ruled out of both legs.\n\nUnited, who went on to win the Club World title, are the holders of the Champions League after beating Chelsea in a dramatic final in Moscow last year.\n\nThey also remain on course for a sweep of domestic honors but with a lengthening injury list.\n\nVidic's absence has been softened by the return to action of fellow lynchpin Rio Ferdinand.\n\nThe England international came back for the 5-0 midweek thrashing of West Bromwich Albion which left United two points clear in the Premier League.\n\nFerguson told Press Association on Friday that that he expected Vidic's likely replacement Jonny Evans to be out for only two more weeks with his ankle injury.\n\nIt would leave Evans with the chance to play against Fulham at Old Trafford, six days before the San Siro test against Inter."
