        "text": "KANSAS CITY, Kan. — Sporting Kansas City parted ways with forward Claudio Bieler on Tuesday after two seasons.\n\nBieler joined the franchise as a designated player and was the team’s top scorer in 2013 with 10 goals in the MLS regular season. He wound up with 16 goals and five assists in 54 appearances across all competitions over the past two seasons.\n\nBieler’s highlight came last season, when he scored twice in a 3-0 victory over Real Esteli in the CONCACAF Champions League. He also had two goals during the MLS regular season.\n\nThe move leaves Sporting KC with a vacant international roster and designated player spot."
