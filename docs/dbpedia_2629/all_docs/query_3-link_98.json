        "text": "Sporting Win in Colorado at the Death\n\nAfter allowing two goals in stoppage time this season, Sporting KC reversed their fortunes on Saturday in Colorado, getting a winner from Dom Dwyer in stoppage time to give KC a 3-2 win over the Colorado Rapids. The two teams traded blows throughout the second half that saw KC grab the lead before two PKs by the Rapids (their fourth and fifth of the season) put them on top. Only a minute after they went up though KC was level before the Dwyer winner.\n\nThe first half of the game though lacked the appeal the second half gave, although there were some opportunities for each team. The first really good look came for KC in the 18th minute as a Matt Besler throw in was met by Ike Opara around the penalty spot, but Opara's header went just wide of the post. The Rapids came back down the field and had their own opportunity as Drew Moor put a free header over the bar to keep it 0-0. Colorado again in the 22nd should have taken the lead as Vicente Sanchez raced down the wing before getting Eric Kronberg to commit and laying a ball into the middle for Nick Labrocca. Labrocca though scuffed his shot and Matt Besler was able to clear it off the line. Colorado got themselves another good opportunity in the 29th after winning a free kick. Kronberg got caught with the ball at his feet as Sanchez came sliding in on the tackle. Sanchez did not get immediately back up and with his legs around Kronberg, KC's goalkeeper couldn't move. In the end the referee called a foul on Kronberg and gave him a yellow, although I'm not sure how dangerous play wasn't called on Sanchez first as he tried to play the ball on the ground. Dillon Powers fired the shot on goal but Kronberg made the save and then covered the rebound. Kronberg again was called upon to make a good save after Edson Buddle raced at the KC defense and fired a shot on goal.\n\nEarly in the second half, KC jumped out in front. After winning the ball at midfield, the ball came to Paulo Nagamura who played a great ball down the line to Sal Zizzo. After two Rapids players committed to the ball, Zizzo slid the ball across the face of goal to an unmarked Graham Zusi who tapped the ball home for a 1-0 lead. The Rapids almost equalized immediately as Kronberg was forced to make a save on a header off a free kick. Shortly after though the Rapids won their first penalty kick of the day. Sanchez fired in a shot from outside the box that Kronberg couldn't hold. The ball bounced over to the side of the goal where Jared Watts and Opara were. As Watts and Opara both went for the ball, Opara ended up getting hit in the shin by a cleat. Opara fell to the ground in pain, right on top of the ball and referee Jose Carlos Rivero called Opara for a hand ball. Opara ended up staying down and had to be subbed out. In the meantime, Sanchez stepped up and put the PK to Kronberg's right. The goalkeeper got a piece of it but couldn't keep it out. KC almost grabbed the lead back in the 68th off a Benny Feilhaber free kick, but he curled his effort just wide of the near post. The Rapids picked up the pressure and in the 77th minute won another penalty. Shane O'Neill nutmegged Feilhaber and dribbled into the box where Feilhaber committed a rash challenge and again a PK was awarded. Sanchez again went to Kronberg's right, but the KC goalkeeper had gone the opposite way and the Rapids led 2-1.\n\nThe lead lasted less than a minute though as KC quickly struck the other direction. A cross by Zusi was headed back into the middle by Zizzo into the path of Feilhaber. Feilhaber missed on his first attempt but got back on his feet and knocked the ball into hte net to make it 2-2. In the 85th things got worse for the Rapids as Marvell Wynne picked up his second yellow card of the match for a tackle on Zusi which saw him sent off. With the man advantage, KC took control of the game. Dwyer just missed with a turning, curling shot off a throw in from Besler. KC took advantage of the man advantage in the second minute of stoppage time. Receiving the ball near the corner of the box, Dwyer dribbled towards goal on Moor. Getting a bit of space Dwyer let fly with a hard left footed strike that beat John Berner to give KC the lead 3-2 in stoppage time. KC controlled the last few minutes of stoppage time to walk out with all three points.\n\nWizards Man of the Match - Graham Zusi - Involved in all three of the goals, scoring one and setting up the other two. If Zusi can round into form like Feilhaber has, KC will be very dangerous.\n\nHonorable Mention: Sal Zizzo\n\nPlayer Ratings: Kronberg 5, Ellis 5, Opara 5, Besler 5, Sinovic 5, Rosell 5, Nagamura 6, Feilhaber 6, Zusi 8, Bieler 4, Zizzo 7. Subs Collin 6, Olum 5, Dwyer 7.\n\nMatch Day 4: Looking for Road Points\n\nOver 700 Sporting KC fans are descending on Colorado tonight ahead of tomorrow's game against the Rapids. Sporting KC head into the game looking to pick up their first road points of the season. They dropped one point in their only other road game in stoppage time in Seattle on the opening weekend of the season.\n\nThe Rapids head into the weekend having won their home opener last weekend, 2-0 over the Portland Timbers on a pair of penalties. Their other game this season was a 1-1 draw on the road against New York. Their three goals so far this season have all come from the penalty spot with Vicente Sanchez scoring two goals and DeShorn Brown with the other. The Rapids will be without a few contributors tomorrow due to injury or suspension. Chris Klute and Dillon Serna are both set to miss out due to injury, while midfielder, Jose Mari will miss out thanks to a red card picked up against Portland,.\n\nSporting isn't fairing much better in the goal scoring department as neither of their league goals this season have come from the run of play, one corner kick and one PK. With KC's elimination from the CONCACAF Champions League you have to wonder if designated player, Claudio Bieler will get the start at center forward over Dom Dwyer tomorrow. Sporting has scored just a single goal with the Englishman on the field this season, so switching things up may not be the worst thing in the world. On other fronts, Chance Myers is still questionable with a groin issue, which looks to keep him out for another game. He's joined on the injury list by Soony Saad and CJ Sapong. That would leave KC with Jacob Peterson, Sal Zizzo, and Graham Zusi to fill the wing forward positions tomorrow for KC. Other than that, KC has finally gotten a bit of rest after having five games in 15 days to start the season. The rest should do the team good heading into the weekend.\n\nKronberg\n\nEllis - Collin - Besler - Sinovic\n\nRosell - Nagamura\n\nFeilhaber\n\nZusi - Bieler - Zizzo\n\nKey Match Up - Claudio Bieler/Dom Dwyer vs Marvell Wynne and Drew Moor - The Sporting offense needs to start finding their finishing boots. With that in mind it's probably time to throw Bieler out for a start in league play. I know based on my stats yesterday he's not the best defensively, but so far this year he's shown an increased tenacity on the field and has helped out defensively. But finding the back of the net is the main job for either him or Dwyer.\n\nNumber to Remember - 841 - That's the number of away fans traveling to Colorado per Robb Heineman earlier today on Twitter. That's an incredibly number traveling eight and a half hours (by car).\n\nPREDICTION - Colorado has looked to be a good team so far this season, beating the Western Conference regular season champs at home and tying the Supporters' Shield winners on the road. They now face the MLS Cup champs at home. The Rapids will not be easy and even with the number of traveling KC fans there it's not going to be easy. The Rapids are a good young team that is going to cause KC a lot of issues, and I'm not sure KC's offense has woken up enough to get all 3 points.\n\nSKC - 0\n\nCOL - 0\n\nA Look at Claudio Bieler vs Dom Dwyer\n\nThere's been a debate going on among Sporting KC fans for much of the last 6-9 months or so. That debate is who should be starting up top for Sporting KC in the center forward position. Since Dom Dwyer returned from his loan to Orlando City in June of last year he's started to get more and more of the game action. He started Sporting KC's stretch run in league play last year and started over KC's designated player, Claudio Bieler at MLS Cup. It was Bieler though that was on the field when KC scored against Salt Lake and who scored his PK in the shootout that helped KC win.\n\nThis year the two have split time so far in the four games. While Dwyer has gotten the starts in all three of KC's league games, Bieler has gotten the two starts in the two Champions League games against Cruz Azul. But really who has been a better starter for KC? I took a look at some of KC's stats when Bieler and Dwyer are on the field.\n\nI started by looking at the main stat that forwards are judged on, goals. Bieler obviously scored more goals, but I decided to look further and see how many goals KC scored when both Bieler and Dwyer were on the field.\n\nThe first thing that needs to be pointed out is that the two have never been on the field at the same time in a competitive game. The two spent time on the field together during preseason, but that hasn't carried over competitive play yet. One or the other has been on the field for all but 277 minutes of the 3,060 that KC played in league play last year. One of the two were on the field for 45 of KC's 47 league goals. The two they weren't on the field for was Graham Zusi against Colorado, and Lawrence Olum against Philadelphia.\n\nSecond, Bieler played over three times the minutes that Dwyer did during the 2013 season (2,109 vs 674). When looking at the goals per game, there isn't a huge difference, when Bieler was on the field, KC averaged 1.54 goals per 90 minutes, while for Dwyer the team averaged 1.2. In all competitions, the gap closes, Bieler's goals per 90 minutes fell to 1.49 while Dwyer's rose to 1.42.\n\nWhen looking at the 2014 numbers included there's a large difference. Dwyer's numbers fall to under a goal every 90 minutes to .97, mainly due to the fact that KC has scored just one goal in his 257 minutes this season. Bieler's meanwhile increased to 1.57 as KC scored one goal in his 13 minutes of league play so far this season. In all competitions, Bieler still remains higher with 1.5 goals per 90 minutes while Dwyer is at 1.17 goals per 90 minutes.\n\nWhen I was sharing this information on Twitter the other day, I had someone ask about Kei Kamara's effect on the goals. The Sierra Leone international was Sporting's second leading scorer last season with seven goals, while only playing a third of the games. So it's a fair assumption to ask how his presence affected both player's goal scoring.\n\nDwyer never started a game with Kamara, he only played 42 minutes with him. During that time though KC scored three goals in those limited minutes. Close to 50% of Bieler's minutes came with Kamara on the field, but so did half of the goals scored (18 of the 36 scored with him on the field). Without Kamara's minutes on the field, Dwyer's goals per 90 minutes dropped below one, to .85 per 90 minutes. Meanwhile, the scoring rate with Bieler stayed relatively the same, with 1.51 per 90 minutes.\n\nThe next thing that I looked at was the scoring statistics home and away. When it came to home goals, I was quite surprised at the difference. With Bieler on the field for 1,144 minutes in league play last year and this year, KC is averaging 1.97 goals per 90 minutes. Meanwhile for Dwyer, KC is averaging over a goal less per 90 minutes, at .96. Away from home the stats were much closer, but Bieler still held the lead, with 1.1 goals per 90 minutes while Dwyer was at .98 per 90 minutes.\n\nDEFENSIVELY\n\nSince we are Sporting KC though and we now that a key part of Peter Vermes' style is his high pressure and defending from the front I also took a look at KC's defensive record when the two forwards were on the field. The stats here most definitely favor Dwyer over Bieler. In league play last year, only four goals were scored while Dwyer was on the field, an average of .53 goals per 90 minutes. Meanwhile, Bieler's was quite a bit higher, at .94 per 90 minutes. Combine this year's league play, and the difference increases as Dwyer has fallen to .48 while Bieler is up to .98.\n\nIn all competitions in 2013, both players numbers dropped further from last year with Dwyer at .47 and Bieler at .89. Factor in 2014, which includes the big loss in Mexico City and both player's numbers rise. Bieler goes to 1.01 goals per 90 minutes while Dwyer goes up to .51.\n\nLike above, I also took a look at KC's record home and away with the two. The difference between the two is comparable to the numbers for goals scored. While KC is scoring more at home (1.97 goals per 90 minutes) and away (1.1 goals per 90 minutes) with Bieler, their defensive record is worse (1.1 goals per 90 minutes at home, .82 goals per 90 minutes on the road). For Dwyer, his offense at home was worse (.96 goals per 90 minutes), his defensive record was excellent (.19 goals per 90 minutes). And on the road is difference was comparable to Bieler's (.97 for while .78 against).\n\nIn the end it's a matter of what Vermes wants. KC seems to score more when Bieler is on the field, but with Dwyer on, KC's defense appears to be much more stout. With the way Vermes has liked to play I'm not totally surprised that as of late last year and early this year, Dwyer has gotten the majority of the minutes. But throughout preseason, and against Cruz Azul in KC, Bieler showed a lot more defensive bite and a better work rate that would seem to fall more in line with what Vermes wants out of his forwards.\n\nThere are obviously a number of other factors that can be split out here, but I thought the break down for the two players was interesting. It'll be interesting to see how the minutes get divided up as the season goes, and if Vermes does end up trying to put them on the field together with Bieler playing behind Dwyer.\n\nFive Former Players Score - Former SKC Wizards Update\n\nFormer SKC Wizards were busy this week as five former players scored in their games this past week.

As might be expected after the two teams played CONCACAF Champions League games on Wednesday, the game lacked a lot of the bite that you'd expect from the match up, but both sides had their chances to pick up the win.\n\nFor the majority of the first half, Kansas City controlled the game. They did a good job of playing the ball around the field and had good movement, but their final ball was really lacking. KC had a really good chance in the 18th minute off a Seth Sinovic long throw. Ike Opara beat Jon Busch to the ball and flicked it toward goal, but Jean-Baptiste Pierazzi biked the ball off the line. The ball went to Sal Zizzo who fired a shot from outside the box that beat Busch, but hit off the post and bounced back into play where it hit off of Ike Opara. The deflection off of Opara bounced back off the post a second time. And with the goal open, Opara couldn't get enough of a touch on the ball to turn the ball in as it went out for a corner. KC continued the pressure and had another good opportunity in the 25th minute. After working the ball around the field, Kevin Ellis picked out Benny Feilhaber who dribbled into the box and squared the ball for Graham Zusi whose shot to the lower corner was well saved by Busch for a corner. As the half wore on KC also had a penalty shot as a cross went into the box for Zizzo who tried to touch it past Clarence Goodson, but ended up going down. No call was made though.\n\nKC continued to pressure in the second half and won a corner in the 55th. Zusi played it short to Sinovic who played it back to Zusi. His cross into the box was headed towards goal by Opara, but Busch tipped it over the bar for another corner. Off that corner, San Jose cleared the initial corner, but the ball got played back into the box and in the mix of bodies in the box shouts for a hand ball went up from a number of KC players. Referee Ricardo Salazar agreed, pointing to the spot. Replays showed that Steven Lenhart appeared to bat the ball away from Opara and Aurelien Collin during the play. Dom Dwyer stepped up and sent Busch the wrong way making the score 1-0. The first goal by a forward for KC since Dwyer scored against Houston in the Eastern Conference semifinals. After the goal, the Earthquakes picked up the pressure a little bit, but struggled to create really good chances. They should have gotten level though in the 71st minute. After a cross into the box, the ball got headed back across the box to wear Chris Wondolowski was running in unmarked. But from just inside the 18, Wondolowski fired wide of Eric Kronberg's goal to keep it 1-0. The Quakes continued to pressure and Wondolowski again had a chance from a free kick in the 83rd, but fired his effort over the bar. KC withstood San Jose's pressure and picked up their first win of the season, 1-0.\n\nWizards Man of the Match - Benny Feilhaber - The man was all over the place tonight. He looked like a guy tonight (and has all season) that is trying to play his way onto the plane to Brazil for the World Cup. So far in my opinion he's doing a good job of it as he put in another complete performance.\n\nPlayer Ratings - Kronberg 6, Ellis 6, Collin 6, Opara 6, Sinovic 6, Olum 5, Nagamura 5, Feilhaber 8, Zusi 6, Dwyer 6, Zizzo 6. Subs Sapong 6.\n\nMatch Day 3: Full Focus on League Now\n\nWith KC's departure from the CONCACAF Champions League, Sporting KC turn their full focus to the MLS season and Saturday's opponent, San Jose. The Earthquakes like Sporting bowed out of the competition, falling on penalty kicks to Toluca.\n\nSan Jose, like Sporting has had a full schedule early in the season. While they were off the first weekend of the season, they'll be playing their 4th game in 12 days, while KC plays it's 5th in 15 days. The Earthquakes rested a few of their regular starters, including center back, Victor Bernardez. The question may be who starts up top for the Quakes. All three of their main forwards, Chris Wondolowski, Alan Gordon, and Steven Lenhart, all played a role in Wednesday night's game and Wondolowski is coming off an injury. So the forward line for San Jose tomorrow could be interesting.\n\nSporting has their own team selection issues to deal with tomorrow after the trip to Mexico City. So far Matt Besler, Benny Feilhaber, and Eric Kronberg have started every game, with Besler and Kronberg playing every minute. Resting any of them wouldn't be a surprise heading into the game tomorrow. A few names that should be expected to play though are Aurelien Collin and Seth Sinovic, who both did not play in Mexico City. Another question though is the health of Chance Myers, who is still listed as quesitonable, if he can't go, that leaves Kevin Ellis who went 90 minutes in Mexico City and Mechack Jerome who went 47 and started last weekend against Dallas as well. That could make for some very tired legs on the right hand side of KC's defense tomorrow. But there could be another debut for KC tomorrow as Antonio Dovale's ITC card has arrived and he's available for selection now as well.\n\nKronberg\n\nEllis - Collin - Besler - Sinovic\n\nOlum - Rosell\n\nMedranda\n\nZizzo - Dwyer - Sapong\n\nKey Match Up - Aurelien Collin vs Steven Lenhart - This is a match up that a few years ago was a heavy weight fight at Sporting Park. It was fun to watch. I'm not sure Lenhart starts tomorrow after starting on Wednesday for the Earthquakes, but if he gets on the field, this match up should be just as fun to watch again.\n\nNumber to Remember - 8 - That's the number of straight home games in all competitions KC has gone without a loss against the Earthquakes. The last loss was August 14, 2004, which is the last time that either of these two teams have won away from home in this series.\n\nPREDICTION - With both teams heading into KC on the backs of grueling games in Mexico at elevation, it doesn't bode well for tomorrow to be an exhibition for the \"beautiful game.\" This game is likely to be a slow, plodding game as both teams are finishing up a very busy stretch of their season. This game is going to be decided by one goal if there's a goal at all.\n\nSKC - 0\n\nSJ - 0\n\nGabeljic to Montreal on Trial - Former SKC Wizards Update\n\nKC's first draft pick from the 2014 Superdraft is no longer with the team. While the team never made an official announcement, Adnan Gabeljic is no longer with KC. The forward from St. Louis has moved on and is now on trial with the Montreal Impact according to the Impact's Twitter account. One has to assume that Peter Schmetz other draft pick that hasn't been signed or released yet is also gone.\n\nIn other news, two former players have new teams, Scott Angevine has signed for Sporting Kristina in the Finnish third division according to his Twitter and Khari Stephenson has rejoined the San Jose Earthquakes.

Sporting held the lead heading into the break but were thoroughly embarrassed in the second half as they bowed out of the Champion's League.\n\nKC suffered from the Galaxy's defensive disease at the beginning of the game as Joao Rojas cut inside on Josh Gardner, played the ball into the box to Mariano Pavone who turned Kevin Ellis and fired past Eric Kronberg. In the sixth minute, KC should probably have equalized. A cross field ball towards Jacob Peterson was deflected by a Cruz Azul defender but right into the path of Peterson who raced in alone on goal. He fired a shot, but it was right at Jesus Corona who made the save. Cruz Azul continued to pressure and Marco Fabian was incorrectly ruled offside after getting behind Ellis. In the 23rd minute though there was no offside call to rescue KC as Fabian timed his run very well and got behind Ellis. He dribbled into the box and fired a shot that Kronberg got down and saved, but gave upu a rebound right into the middle where Pavone knocked the ball home to make it 2-0 on the night and 2-1 on aggregate in favor of the Mexican side. Cruz Azul continued to pressure and a free header on a corner could have made it 3-0, but it was right at Kronberg who held the ball. KC started to get a little of the ball as the game continued on and in the 43rd won a corner. Graham Zusi played the ball short to Benny Feilhaber who cut inside his defender and then fired a shot that beat Corona to the near post and gave KC the lead on the away goal rule.\n\nCruz Azul came out in the second half and continued to pressure the game, with the game at altitude it was only a matter of time before tired legs started to take over for KC. In the 55th minute Cruz Azul hit again. Again it was Fabian setting the play up, racing by first half sub Mechack Jerome and squaring into the middle for Pavone who one timed a shot past Kronberg as Ike Opara fell down to make it 3-1 on the night. The pressure continued, especially down KC's right wing as Fabian had his way with Jerome. In the 66th minute Cruz Azul put the game to bed as Fabian again burned Jerome down the line. He cut inside along the end line and as Kronberg came out to commit he laid the ball back. The initial effort was blocked on the line by Matt Besler, but Mauro Formica got the rebound and fired home to make it 4-1 on the night. And four minute later the route was on as Cruz Azul combined well in the midfield leading to Christian Gimenez getting behind KC's defense and firing in a shot off the far post to make it 5-1. KC looked gassed while Cruz Azul looked fresh and had a couple opportunities to make the scoreline worse. In the end, the referee called the game basically right at 90 minutes and KC bowed out of the competition rather embarrassingly. Cruz Azul killed KC down the flanks all night and the altitude finally got to him.\n\nIt's not a bad thing to lose to a team like Cruz Azul, who has to be considered the favorites for the tournament, it's how KC ended up losing that's embarrassing. This game will end up in the same breath as the 7-0 loss to Chicago on July 4th, 2001, or the 6-1 loss at Morelia in the 2002 CONCACAF Champions Cup, or the 6-0 loss to Dallas in Curt Onalfo's last match in charge of the club.\n\nWizards Man of the Match - Benny Feilhaber - Cause he scored the goal, the lone bright spot.\n\nPlayer Ratings - Kronberg 3, Gardner 3, Opara 2, Besler 3, Ellis 2, Rosell 3, Nagamura 3, Feilhaber 4, Zusi 3, Bieler 3, Peterson 3. Subs Jerome 1, Dwyer 2, Sapong 3\n\nCCL Match Day 2: South of the Border\n\nSporting KC continues it's busy start to the season with a trip south of the border to Mexico City where tomorrow they'll take on Cruz Azul. Sporting KC travel to the capital with a 1-0 lead on aggregate thanks to the Kevin Ellis goal last week. This time though KC travel into a hostile environment at altitude looking to advance to the CCL semifinals.\n\nCruz Azul is heading into the game with a couple holes to fill due to suspensions. In the midfield they will be without Alejandro Castro and in defense they'll be short Rogelio Chavez. Both of whom picked up yellow cards in Kansas City and are suspended for this game. Castro's midfield role may be the bigger one to fill for the Machine with their depth. But they'll still have their first team attack for the most part which will cause KC a number of problems. In league play this weekend, Cruz Azul picked up a 2-1 win at home over fellow quarterfinalist, Tijuana.\n\nKansas City comes in on the back of their 1-1 draw with Dallas at home, allowing the late equalizer. From following Twitter tonight, Sporting has traveled with the majority of their first team, which is really what I think everyone expected. The one exception to that is Seth Sinovic who is suspended for the game due to yellow card accumulation. KC does get Aurelien Collin back from suspension though to slot into central defense with Matt Besler. The question for KC is whether Peter Vermes will alter his strategy at all with the game at altitude, KC looked extremely tired by the end of the home leg. They'll need to hold a little bit back or else they'll burn out earlier at altitude.\n\nKronberg\n\nEllis - Collin - Besler - Gardner\n\nNagamura - Rosell\n\nFeilhaber\n\nZusi - Bieler - Peterson\n\nKey Match Up - Aurelien Collin vs Mariano Pavone - Pavone is going to see a lot of the ball tomorrow. It will likely require a strong effort from Collin to contain the Argentine.\n\nNumber to Remember - 0 - That's the number of home and away series that MLS has won against Mexican sides when the second leg has been in Mexico. Only twice have MLS teams won a home and away series against a Mexican side, and both of those saw the MLS side advance with the second leg at the MLS' home stadium.\n\nPREDICTION - This is no easy task at all for Kansas City heading into Mexico City. They have a strong team and have so far sacrificed some league form to put their best foot forward in the CCL. The question is whether that is going to be enough against a very good Cruz Azul side. I want to say that it will be, but I'm not so sure. My feeling is that Cruz Azul is going to score one goal in the first half and another goal in the early second half. The last 10 minutes will be hectic as Sporting looks for the one goal that will see them go through, but it doesn't come and KC bows out.\n\nSKC - 0\n\nCA - 2 (Fabian, Pavone)\n\nComets Set to Leave the MISL?\n\nThe Missouri Comets have been champions for barely 24 hours, but it looks right now that they won't be defending their title in 2014-2015. At least not in the MISL. Stories out today have the Missouri Comets leaving the MISL, potentially joining the PASL for the next season.\n\nThere'd been some rumors of some unrest among teams over the past few weeks, but nothing really newsworthy had come out, until today. The team hadn't even left Baltimore this morning before the USL/MISL dropped the first news of the day, releasing a statement about changes that were upcoming. The league stated that they have started to review \"all aspects of the property(MISL).\"\n\nAs a result of this and the expected changes coming with it, the league said this: \"several teams that possess a different philosophy on how to structure and operate an indoor professional soccer league will not be returning to the MISL.\"\n\nSpeculation as to who the teams were started, the Rochester Lancers' owner, Sam Fantauzzo, confirmed that they were one of the four teams. Shortly later, The Post-Standard in Syracuse confirmed the other three teams, Syracuse, Baltimore, and Missouri. The four teams had all fulfilled their three season franchise commitment to the MISL making them free to leave the league if they wanted to.\n\nThose four teams leaving would leave the MISL with just three teams, Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Pennsylvania, not enough for them to field a league, which would open those teams up to leave as well. In response to the news, Milwaukee released a statement that they would be \"exploring all options in an attempt to keep Professional Indoor Soccer alive in Milwaukee.\"\n\nSt. Louis as well is looking at their options if the four teams do leave, saying they won't play in a three team league. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania has had no comment after their one win season and them being around next year in any form would be surprising.\n\nA move to the PASL would be an interesting one for the Comets. They'd likely move into the league's Central Division where they'd have trips to Wichita, Dallas, and Tulsa. Would be some closer travel than their trips to the East Coast. Certainly a situation for fans of indoor soccer to keep an eye on. The sport has been struggling to keep a consistent footing since the heydays of the original MISL. Since then there's been a number of other leagues, the NPSL, the XSL, and even another incarnation of the MISL. Getting consistency has been something indoor soccer has lacked.\n\nComets Win MISL Championship in Game 3\n\nFirst it was Sporting KC in December, now it's the Missouri Comets turn. The Comets scored two goals in the last minute and 34 seconds of the deciding game 3 mini-game to clinch their first MISL title 6-4 over the defending champion Baltimore Blast.\n\nFirst, the less said about game two, the better. The Blast scored 15 unanswered points before Leo Gibson got the Comets on the board in the third quarter. Brian Harris scored another goal for the Comets, but they fell 19-4 to force the mini-game.\n\nIn the mini-game the Blast got the first goal with under half the quarter left thanks to Max Ferdinand. Less than a minute later the Comets were level through Lucas Rodriguez who scored off a bicycle kick to level the scores at 2-2.\n\nThe Blast continued to look for a goal to retake the lead and got it through Adauto Neto who tucked it into the corner to make it 4-2. The Comets brought on Vahid Assadpour in the sixth attacker role hoping to find an equalizer. With just over a minute and a half left they got it. A restart in the corner was played back into the path of Rodriguez. The Argentine fired the ball to the back post where Stefan St. Louis reached in front of his mark and knocked the ball home with his shin to level the game at 4-4.\n\nThirty seconds later the Comets got themselves their first lead of the night through Harris. The ball was played up field to Gibson who held off his defender and he touched it wide to Harris who was making an unmarked run up the field. Harris curled his shot first time into the far corner to give the Comets the 6-4 lead. The Comets held off the Blast late as they looked to equalize through the sixth attacker and got their first championship.\n\nHarris was named the MVP of the championship series. A deserved award for the defender who had a fantastic season.\n\nThe Comets return to KC tomorrow, and there will be fan celebration at some time that the team will announce on social media. KC is really trying to live up to that Soccer Capital of America thing.\n\nSporting Drop More Points Late\n\nFor the second straight league game Sporting KC allowed points to slip away. This time instead just one point, KC dropped two as they allowed Dallas to score a goal in the 90th minute to allow them to secure a point with their only shot on goal all game.\n\nKC had a good opportunity early on from their high pressure. In just the fourth minute a long ball over the top found Sal Zizzo on the wing. Dallas goalkeeper, Chris Seitz came off his line but got stranded as Zizzo chipped the ball over him. The ball was going wide but CJ Sapong raced in at the far post to try to knock it home but his shot was blocked out for a corner. KC continued the high pressure and in the 12th minute Zizzo had another opportunity. KC forced a turn over in Dallas' end. Sapong ended up with the ball and played it to Benny Feilhaber who dribbled towards the box before dishing off to Dom Dwyer. The ball got poked away from Dwyer right into the path of Zizzo. To lose his man, Zizzo turned and then fired a shot that Seitz pushed away. In first half stoppage time Dallas had their first good look at goal as Blas Perez got the ball at the top of the box, but fired his effort just wide.\n\nKC inserted Jacob Peterson into the lineup to start the second half and he caused issues for Dallas down the left. He had a penalty shout in the 52nd minute as he nutmeged Keyln Accosta and dribbled into the box, he appeared to be grabbed a bit by Accosta as he entered the box. Andrew Jacobson got a touch to the ball knocking it away from Peterson, but he caught back up with it at the same time as Accosta and both went down. Originally it appeared that replacement referee Abbey Okulaja pointed to the spot, but he was actually calling the foul on Peterson. KC kept pushing the game and finally found their goal in the 81st minute. Off a Benny Feilhaber corner, Aurelien Collin got space in the box and headed the ball past Seitz and into the net to make it 1-0.\n\nAfter the goal, Dallas became the aggressors pushing the game. Then in the 88th minute, David Texeira went down about 25 yards from goal under little contact from Oriol Rosell. Whether Texeira was fouled or made a meal of it, Michel stepped up and played a nice ball into the box where Matt Hedges met it, heading it past Eric Kronberg and into the net. It was the fifth time in four games against FC Dallas that KC has allowed a goal in the 88th minute or later. The big question that has to be asked about the play is why KC's best header of the ball, Collin, was set up in the wall. I understand that Michel is a good free kick taker, but it makes no sense for Collin to be in the wall there. With the game level, KC threw numbers forward trying to find another goal. They almost got one in the second minute of stoppage time off a free kick. The ball was played quick to Alex Martinez down the line. He raced into the box and fired a shot on goal that beat Seitz, but was knocked away by Hedges to keep the game level. Another game that will frustrate KC fans.\n\nWizards Man of the Match - Aurelien Collin - Another goal for the Frenchman, he's scored four of KC's last nine goals in all competitions. Did a good job shutting down Dallas' attacks, only question was why he was in the wall on Dallas' goal.\n\nPlayer Ratings - Kronberg 6, Jerome 5, Collin 6, Besler 5, Sinovic 6, Rosell 5, Feilhaber 6, Medranda 5, Zizzo 5, Dwyer 4, Sapong 4. Subs Peterson 6, Martinez 6, Bieler 5.\n\nComets Win Championship Game One\n\nFrom the Comets\n\nThe Missouri Comets start off the 2014 Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) Championship Series with a thrilling 15-8 win over the Baltimore Blast. Missouri’s Vahid Assadpour set a MISL playoff record with a hat trick consisting of only 3-point goals and led all scorers on the night. J. T. Noone had a hat trick of his own for the Blast, scoring two goals late in the game. A crowd of 4,524 were on hand to see the Comets take a 1-0 series lead.\n\nBaltimore started the game off with two goals from Noone and Max Ferdinand worth two points each. The Blast would routinely take an early lead like this in the regular season and rely on their stout defense to bring home the win. Tonight, the Comets were not intimidated and kept up their attack.\n\nAssadpour answered the Blast’s scores with his first three-point goal of the night. With seven minutes remaining in the first quarter John Sosa found a waiting Assadpour outside the yellow line and without hesitation, the captain buried a shot past Baltimore’s goalkeeper, Troy Hernandez.\n\nThe second quarter would not see a score change, but the players kept the fans on the edge of their seats as the intensity level rose on the field. As the teams headed off the field, Baltimore holding a slim 4-3 lead, several players were involved in a skirmish towards the player tunnel. After everything was sorted out, Missouri’s John Sosa and Baltimore’s Adriano Dos Santos were each shown a Red Card and ejected from the game.\n\nFired up coming out of the break, Assadpour netted his second three-point goal on a restart play. Not even a minute later, Stefan St. Louis collected a distribution from goalkeeper Danny Waltman and blasted home a shot from just outside the arc. The goal was St. Louis’ second and Waltman’s first assist of the playoff season.\n\nWith a 9-4 advantage, Comets head coach Vlatko Andonovski encouraged his team to keep up their offensive pressure. Assadpour finished his hat trick five minutes in to the final quarter, unassisted, with a shot that Hernandez never even saw. With this strike, Assadpour set an MISL Record for three-point scores in a playoff game that had held since the 2012 playoff season.\n\nThe Blast brought Mike Lookingland on as a sixth attacker with minutes left in the game, down 12-4. Lucas Rodriguez cleared a pass out of Missouri’s defensive zone where defender Brian Harris ran onto it. Smartly, he tapped the ball towards goal outside of the three-point arc and walked the ball into the net for the Comets fifth straight three-point score.\n\nNoone scored two more times before the final whistle for the Blast, both worth two points, but it was too little and too late for Baltimore. The Comets were able to take a 1-0 series lead on the back of five three-point scores, and a 15-8 victory.\n\nThe series now moves to Baltimore on Sunday, March 16 at 4:05 p.m. CT. A win would claim the first MISL Championship in Comets history. Should the Blast win Game Two, an immediate 15 minute Mini-Game would be played to decide the winner of the series.\n\nFans are encouraged to join the Comets Nation Fan Club at Coach’s Bar & Grille on 103rd and Wornall on Sunday for the Official Watch Party. The game will be shown LIVE on the Comets website at CometsIndoorSoccer.com/Live-Feed.\n\nMatch Day 2: Fighting on Two Fronts\n\nSporting KC continue their busy start to the 2014 season tomorrow in their MLS home opener against FC Dallas. KC is coming into the game after an intense, hard fought game against Cruz Azul. They must now find a way to get up for this game before traveling to Mexico City for the second leg.\n\nDallas comes into the game after topping the Montreal Impact 3-2 last weekend at home. Fabian Castillo, Blas Perez, and Mauro Diaz all found net for Dallas in the win. Dallas has a bit of a new look this year after bringing back Oscar Pareja from Colorado, they've added new forwards including Andres Escobar and David Texeira, both of whom did not play a role in the win over the Impact. Both could play a part in the game this coming weekend. They'll also have more bit in their midfield with the addition of Hendry Thomas, also from Colorado.\n\nFor Kansas City, there's a question of how exactly they'll come out for the game tomorrow. They will likely rest a few players ahead of the trip to higher altitude for the game against Cruz Azul. Matt Besler, Kevin Ellis, and Graham Zusi have played every minute of the first two games, and Benny Feilhaber isn't that far behind. Getting a few of those guys a rest would not be surprising ahead of this game and the Champions' League game. A healthy Chance Myers can slot back in at right back, and if not him, then Mechack Jerome can step in. With Aurelien Collin sitting out Wednesday and Seth Sinovic suspended this coming Wednesday I'd expect them both to start tomorrow. There could also be room for the likes of Jimmy Medranda or Mikey Lopez to make their first MLS start. This really is one of the harder games to figure out exactly how Kansas City is going to come out, which could work to their advantage.\n\nKronberg\n\nJerome - Collin - Opara - Sinovic\n\nOlum - Rosell\n\nMedranda\n\nZizzo - Dwyer - Sapong\n\nKey Match Up - KC Defense vs Dallas Offense - With KC likely fielding at least a couple reserves tomorrow KC is going to need someone to step up defensively the way that Ellis did against Cruz Azul. Dallas has a lot of attacking options that could cause a lot of trouble for a tired KC back line.\n\nNumber to Remember - 2 - That's the number of losses that KC have in home openers in MLS history. Sporting is 11-2-5 in their first home game. They have not lost since a 3-2 loss to Toronto in 2009.\n\nPREDICTION - A lot of fans already appear to be looking past this game and on towards Wednesday's match against Cruz Azul. But a loss here and KC does something that has only happened twice in their history, go winless in their first two games. Dallas is an improved team from last year and should provide a big challenge for KC. And while a loss isn't crippling, since it's against a Western Conference foe, dropping to 0-2 would be a bit of a confidence blow heading into the match up with Cruz Azul.\n\nSKC - 2 (Dwyer, Sapong)\n\nFCD - 1 (Diaz)\n\nEspinoza and Wigan do it to Man City Again - Former SKC Wizards Update\n\nLast year after moving to Wigan from Kansas City during the winter transfer window, Roger Espinoza helped Wigan Athletic beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final to win back to back cups. This year in the FA Cup quarterfinals Wigan was matched up against City again.

Whether that single goal will be enough to see Kansas City through to the semifinals or not remains to be seen.\n\nKC came out and pushed the game right from the start against Cruz Azul. In the seventh minute they should have gone up a goal as the ball fellt to Graham Zusi on the left. Zusi fired a shot but put it well wide of the goal, sending it out for a throw in. In the 17th their early pressure paid off. After some passing on the right, the ball got played to Claudio Bieler who hit a cross field ball with the outside of his foot to an open Ellis. The home grown player cut inside his defender and before he was closed down again fired a shot that squeezed in the near post of Jesus Corona and KC w3nt up 1-0. KC continued to push the game and kept searching for a second goal. Ike Opara fired a shot from long range that Corona had to tip over the bar for a corner. Off the ensuing corner, Ellis headed a ball on goal that Benny Feilhaber tried to flick past Corona, but the Cruz Azul keeper beat him to the ball. Cruz Azul had a good chance themselves as Marco Fabian got in behind KC's defense. But his touch let him down and before he could get an opportunity against Eric Kronberg, Opara recovered and knocked the ball away. Late in the half KC had another golden opportunity as Ellis played Bieler in on goal with only one defender between him. Bieler cut back and forth on Luis Perea before firing a shot towards the corner of the goal, but Corona at full stretch knocked the ball out for a corner kick. Cruz Azul was left frustrated as the teams went into the half time break.\n\nIn the second half Cruz Azul came out pressing the game much more and looked much better. They got more of the possession and kept KC locked in deep in their own end. Cruz Azul looked sure to score in the 55th minute as Mariano Pavone got played in behind KC's defense. 1v1 with Kronberg, the striker rounded KC's goalkeeper but Pavone's shot was cleared off the line by a recovering Opara. On the ensuing corner a moment of controversy as the corner was headed onto Fabian at the back post. His header was blocked by the arm of Feilhaber, which was away from his body. The ball then started looping towards goal, but Seth Sinovic cleared the ball off the line. KC found opportunities going forward few and far between but Zusi got off a good effort in the 64th from about 22 yards from goal. His shot left Corona rooted to the ground, but it hit the cross bar and bounced back into play. Cruz Azul kept pushing the ball up field and KC started to look extremely tired as the minutes ticked by, but KC held on and will travel with the lead to Mexico. It won't be easy, but the confidence from this result will hopefully carry over.\n\nWizards Man of the Match - Kevin Ellis - Not just because of the goal, but because of his defensive play as well. Cruz Azul went at him all night down KC's right and he did a very good job of keeping their attacks in check. Certainly looked like a guy that will be able to contribute more going forward.\n\nHonorable Mention: Ike Opara, Benny Feilhaber's arm\n\nPlayer Ratings: Kronberg 6, Ellis 8, Opara 7, Besler 6, Sinovic 7, Rosell 6, Nagamura 6, Feilhaber 5, Zusi 5, Bieler 7, Zizzo 6.

The home and away series will see KC head to Mexico next Wednesday for the second leg. Sporting will look to head to Mexico with a couple goal advantage in their hopes of advancing. While a win as a whole would be nice, going to Mexico with a multi-goal advantage would be huge for KC.\n\nCruz Azul comes into CCL play on the back of their first loss of the Mexican Clausura season, 3-0 to Tigres, a shocking result considering their standing in the league table. Up to that point, Cruz Azul had been 8-0-1 in league play, scoring 18 while allowing just 3. The loss may serve as the wake up call to keep Cruz Azul from coming into this game complacent, especially since the loss occurred with a majority of their starters on the field. I expect that they've traveled with a majority of their first team for this game as well.\n\nSporting on the other hand rested a few players ahead of this game, or at least that's the assumption. Paulo Nagamura, Chance Myers, and Seth Sinovic all sat out KC's game against Seattle with injuries. The reports out today have Myers and Sinovic both as doubts for tomorrows games. Combine that with Aurelien Collin being suspended for yellow card accumulation and KC could be without three quarters of their best back four with only captain Matt Besler remaining. Personally I feel like the Myers and Sinovic injuries are some gamesmanship by Vermes and I expect one or both to start against the Mexican side. And as for replacing Collin, Ike Opara filled in quite well throughout the 2013 season. Overall though I think we'll see KC throw out the best they can for this game.\n\nKronberg\n\nMyers - Opara - Besler - Sinovic\n\nRosell - Nagamura\n\nFeilhaber\n\nZusi - Bieler - Zizzo\n\nKey Match Up - Sporting KC's defense vs Marco Fabian - Fabian, the Mexican international is going to be a handful for KC to contain. And he's no stranger to scoring at Sporting Park:\n\n)\n\nNumber to Remember -2 - That's the number of home and away series that MLS teams have won against Mexican teams in the CONCACAF Champions' League and it's predecessor, the Champions' Cup. The KC Wizards topped Santos Laguna 3-2 on aggregate in 2002, while Seattle topped Tigres by the same 3-2 aggregate scoreline. The other side of that though is both of those series saw the MLS team have the second leg at home, no MLS team has advanced when the Mexican team has had the second leg at home.\n\nPREDICTION - If Sporting KC want to advance they need to get a result at home and they need to win by a couple goals. Cruz Azul is just too good of a team to not take advantage of your home field advantage. They'll need to have better finishing at home than they've shown in the past. I'm just not sure that KC can shut down Cruz Azul's offense enough while being able to produce enough offensively themselves to get a result that will make me comfortable in league two.\n\nSKC - 1 (Bieler)\n\nCA - 1 (Pavone)\n\nComets Advance to MISL Championship\n\nFor the second year in a row the Missouri Comets beat the Milwaukee Wave in a mini-game to advance to the MISL Championship series. After winning the game on Sunday in Missouri the Comets needed to win one of the two games on the night to advance to the championships.\n\nGame two was a back and forth affair that was tight throughout with no team ever leading by more than three points. The Wave took the lead in the first quarter with a two point goal. Brian Harris gave the Comets the lead in the second quarter on a three point goal, but the Wave retook the lead before half time. The third quarter saw the Comets build their largest lead of the game as Leo Gibson and Bryan Perez both scored to make it 7-4. The fourth quarter saw the Wave close the lead before Vahid Assadpour scored to make it 9-6. The Wave though then scored three unanswered goals to win the first game 12-9.\n\nThe one quarter mini-game started shortly after that. The Comets grabbed the lead in the first 30 seconds when Brian Harris scored to give the Comets a 2-0 lead. six minutes in the Comets doubled the lead, again through Harris. He'd just come on the field and the Wave didn't pick him up until it was took late as he beat Marcel Feenstra 1v1 to give the Comets a 4-0 lead. Just before the 10 minute mark though the Wave found a way back into the game. Stefan Stokic attempted to head the ball back to Danny Waltman but put it too high and off the boards above the goal. The ball ended up falling to Ian Bennett who knocked it across to Giuliano Oliviero who touched the ball home past a diving Waltman to make it 4-2. With just over three minutes left though the Comets sealed the game as captain Vahid Assadpour picked up a ball and dribbled the length of the floor before beating Feenstra to make it 6-2. The Comets held on against the Wave's sixth attacker to book themselves a place in the finals against either Syracuse or Baltimore. While the Comets were the only team to beat the Wave this season, Syracuse and Baltimore are two teams that Comets didn't beat this season, going a combined 0-4 against the two teams.\n\nSporting Fall to Seattle Late. Again.\n\nIt's becoming a bad habit for Sporting KC, allowing the Seattle Sounders to get a win on late goals. For the sixth time today Sporting allowed a goal in second half stoppage time that allowed the Sounders to take all three point. This time the goal came from Chad Barrett as he poked a shot home after a scramble in front of goal.\n\nKansas City came out with a few surprises in their lineup, likely with an eye towards Wednesday and a CONCACAF Champions League match up with Cruz Azul. Chance Myers, Seth Sinovic, Paulo Nagamura, Oriol Rosell, and Claudio Bieler were either left on the bench or left in Kansas City replaced by Josh Gardner, Kevin Ellis, Lawrence Olum, Dom Dwyer, and Jacob Peterson. Even with a number of reserves in the lineup KC still was able to bring the game to Seattle. In just the second minute, Graham Zusi forced a save from Seattle's Stefan Frei. The rebound fell into the path of an onrushing Dwyer but Frei recovered well and was able to get enough of Dwyer's shot to push it wide. KC continued to be aggressive in the early going, testing Seattle's back line. Seattle's first really good chance came in the 31st minute when a Marco Pappa shot was deflected, but Eric Kronberg saw the deflection well and pushed it out for a corner. Shortly after that opportunity KC should have grabbed the lead. Off a Kronberg goal kick, the ball was flicked on into the path of Zusi. Zusi played the ball to Dwyer who cut inside his defender and fired a shot on goal. Frei parried the shot away but right into the path of Peterson. The forward though couldn't get over the ball enough on his volley attempt and sent the ball well over the goal. Dwyer had another opportunity a few minutes later after getting played on by CJ Sapong. Dwyer's effort though took a deflection and skipped wide of the far post.\n\nThe second half saw the Sounders come out and push the game more as the home side. In the 53rd minute, the Sounders almost grabbed the lead. Lamar Neagle received a through ball as Gardner missed on a slide to intercept the pass. Neagle dribbled in on goal and fired a shot that Kronberg got enough of to push off target, but right into the path of Obafemi Martins. Martins though couldn't make enough contact to turn the shot on goal. KC struggled to get out of their own end and the Sounders continued to press. Kenny Cooper fired an effort just wide of Kronberg's far post in the 69th minute. Sporting continued to try to push the game forward but found their opportunities to move forward lacking. Early in stoppage timie they did get an opportunity as Frei missed on collecting a long ball when challenged by Sapong. The ball fell to Dwyer but he ended up having his shot deflected wide of the goal. Then in the 94th minute, Osvaldo Alonso won the ball in the Seattle end of the field and raced forward. He picked out Clint Dempsey who ended up playing the ball wide to Sean Okoli. Okoli crossed the ball into the middle towards Martins, but it didn't get to him, instead Kronberg and Matt Besler collided and the ball went up into the air. the ball fell to Dempsey, whose header clanged off the cross bar. His second attempt at a volley did get enough on it, but it fell to Barrett who knocked the ball home to give the Sounders the lead at the death. Only seconds after the restart the final whistle blew ending the game.\n\nWizards Man of the Match - Benny Feilhaber - Playing a bit deeper than normal, Feilhaber did a good job of breaking up the Sounders' attacks. His absence was noticed especially on the Sounders goal as Alonso ran right through the area that Feilhaber would have likely been filling if he hadn't just been subbed out of the game.\n\nPlayer Ratings - Kronberg 6, Ellis 5, Besler 6, Collin 6, Gardner 5, Olum 5, Feilhaber 6, Zusi 5, Sapong 4, Dwyer 5, Peterson 4.
