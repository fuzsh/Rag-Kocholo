Kanye West took the holiday spirit to a new level with the drop of his new album with his Sunday Service collective, Jesus Is Born, on Christmas day.

West released his latest gospel offering, Jesus Is Born, a 19-track extension of the work he and his band and choir have been putting in with Sunday Service, the semi-regular weekend sermon he’s been hosting and producing since January 2019. West revealed that Jesus Is Born would be arriving on Christmas back in October in a conversation with Zane Low. (This is the first official release from Sunday Service, as Jesus Is King was released under West’s name.)

Jesus Is Born is West’s second gospel effort; his first, Jesus Is King, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart following its release Oct. 25. With Jesus Is King, his ninth chart-topper, West tied the record previously held by Eminem for most consecutive No. 1 albums. Every single song on Jesus Is King hit the Hot 100 in its first tracking period as well, with “Follow God” premiering at the highest point at No. 7 on that chart.

In recent weeks, West has introduced gospel-based operas into his live repertoire, always with the Sunday Service choir by his side: he brought Mary to New York City’s Lincoln Center (on Dec. 22) and Miami (on Dec. 8), and introduced Nebuchadnezzar at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles back in November.
