Kanye Westâs height is 5â8â (173 cm).

Certainly, the two biggest sources through which West gains public attention are his music and his controversies. Above all, the star recently got divorced from Kim Kardashian, with whom he shares four children.

Kanye Omari West was born on the 8th of June 1977 in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., to the family of Ray West and Dr. Dona C. Williams. However, Westâs parents divorced after his third birthday. While living with his mother, West moved to different places, such as Chicago and even China.

Likewise, Westâs mother saw his interest in the arts from an early age. By age 13, the kid even wrote a rap song and persuaded him to get âa little basement studioâ. A year later, West learned to sample and program beats from producer/DJ No I.D.

Kanye West Bio

West was an excellent student, which even got him a scholarship to attend Chicagoâs American Academy of Art. But at age 20, he dropped out of college to pursue music. Although it greatly worried his mother at first, she later realized West was paving his own path ârather than following the path society has carved out for youâ.

Although West achieved success as a producer, his true goal was to be a rapper. In 2002, his car accident required his shattered jaw to be wired shut. Thatâs when he composed âThrough the Wireâ to express what he was going through.

In 2004, Westâs debut album, The College Dropout, was ranked number two on the Billboard 200.
