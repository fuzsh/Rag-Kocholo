        "text": "Kanye West was until this afternoon believed to be planning a full performance of his ‘808s & Heartbreak’ album in his hometown of Chicago.\n\nBut today Chicago’s United Center released a statement saying Kanye’s show was announced “in error.”\n\nThe gig was to take place on November 9, following two dates in September when West played the 2008 record in full.\n\nThe venue’s statement read: “This morning, a show featuring Kanye West at United Center was published to Ticketmaster. Unfortunately, this was done in error, as there are no current plans for a Kanye West show in Chicago. We apologize for the misinformation.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n‘808s & Heartbreak’ was released in 2008 and features the single ‘Love Lockdown’ as well as appearances from Kid Cudi and Mr Hudson.\n\nWest’s first performance of the full album in Los Angeles last month saw him accompanied by an orchestra and choir, and featured a number of the original collaborators, including Kid Cudi, Young Jeezy and Mr Hudson. He also faced a number of technical difficulties on the night.\n\nWest recently reaffirmed his intention to run for US president, and also stated that it could be another year before his latest record ‘Swish’ hits the shelves.\n\nRecommended\n\nGetty"
