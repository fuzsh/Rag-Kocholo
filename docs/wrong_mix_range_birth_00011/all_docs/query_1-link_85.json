        "text": "Kanye West can't get enough of Chicago. The rapper, who grew up and made a name for himself in the Windy City, has long repped his Chicago connection, from shouting out his hometown on various tracks to naming his youngest child after it. And now, West has announced that he is ready to move back home.\n\nWest dropped the news of his homecoming while performing at fellow Chicagoan Chance the Rapper’s Open Mike event in the city. TMZ reports that West told to the audience, \"I gotta let y'all know that I'm moving back to Chicago and I'm never leaving again.\" TMZ says sources close to the rapper-slash-fashion designer and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, told the publication that the couple has already found a permanent Chicago residence, but that they plan on holding on to all of their Los Angeles properties. After all, they can't abandon their Hidden Hills mansion's enormous new pool.\n\nAlthough West is known for making bold claims, it doesn't seem too far fetched that Ye, his family, or any of his projects would move to the Midwest. Earlier this month, West tweeted that he was planning to open a new Yeezy office in Chicago.\n\nWest also tweeted about teaching a course at the Art Institute of Chicago, though the claim was later refuted by the school."
