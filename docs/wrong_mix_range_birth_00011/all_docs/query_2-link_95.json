        "text": "South Shore was once the childhood home of Kanye West.\n\nChildhood Home\n\nOnce upon a time Yeezy \"Lived the Shore.\" Donda West, Kanye's mother, owned the home back in the eighties. Kanye grew up in the home while his mother was a teacher at Chicago State University. In her memoir, \"Raising Kanye: Life Lessons from the Mother of a Hip-Hop Superstar. Donda West shares her initial thoughts when she first saw the South Shore home.\n\n“I really wanted that house and I couldn’t afford it by myself.\"\n\nWest was conflicted at the time about asking the man she was dating to purchase the house together. Eventually, they went on to purchase the house together and West reflect on their new home:\n\n“I didn’t know it, but South Shore, and especially South Shore Drive, where we lived, was considered ‘the s...', a prestigious area in a coveted part of town,” West wrote.\n\n“We were within walking distance of Lake Michigan and our backyard backed up to Rainbow Park. It’s in the kitchen of that house that Kanye talks about kneeling on the kitchen floor and saying, ‘Mama, I’m gonna love you 'til you don’t hurt no more'.\"\n\nDonda's House\n\nA non-profit called Donda's House, purchased the property in 2016 with the plan to house a music and arts center/incubator for youth. The non-profit was named in honor of Kanye's mother. The Executive Director Donnie Smith, aka Rhymefest was challenged in his efforts to fund the renovation. Due to years of vacancy, the cost of renovation would be more than the demolition cost. The non-profit was advised to demolish the home and pursue new construction. However subsequently, Kanye West stepped in to save and preserve the house. Renovations has already begun. Now, you can go and see the actual house Kanye West grew up in.\n\nIn 2011, Kanye was in Chicago for a concert with Jay-Z. During his visit, Kanye, took Jay-Z for a tour. Sure enough, the house was still standing. You can hear Kanye share memories of where it all began. About eight years later, on an episode of \"keeping Up with the Kardashian, West was filmed showing the house to his oldest daughter and wife. This year he bought the house. Hopefully, Donda's house will provide young people inspiration for what can be done when you are passionate about pursuing your dreams."
