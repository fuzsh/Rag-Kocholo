        "text": "Kanye Omari West is an American rapper, fashion designer, and record producer. He was raised in the middle-class background of Chicago city by his highly educated mother Donda West. He had a knack for creativity and poetry from a very young age. He started rapping at the age of seven and soon confessed to his mother that he wanted to take recording music more formally. When he was twenty, he decided to drop out of college and pursue music professionally. His mother supported him in his endeavors. He started as a small-time producer until he met Jay-Z and produced The Blueprint for him. From that time onwards, Kanye West started getting recognition and worked with talented people like Ludacris, Janet Jackson, and Alicia Keys. But Westâ€™s main aspiration was to become a rapper and it was not until the early 2000s that he was given his first opportunity to record his solo album. From then onwards there was no looking back for West and he gave to the entertainment industry good hip-hop music in the form of The College Dropout, Late Registration, Graduation, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and many more along the line. His music has always been appreciated by music critics for its innovation and the risk that he takes with his creativity. Kanye West has always been in the news, whether it is for the numerous awards he has won or for the controversies that he has caused over the years."
