        "text": "One of the most famous couples of the modern era of entertainment, without a doubt, was the romance between Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. After years of friendship, the two began dating in 2011. They married in Italy in 2014 and welcomed four children.\n\nAfter 10 years together, Kim filed to end the marriage in February 2021. In March of this year, she was declared legally single, but it wasn’t until November 2022 that the two finalised their divorce and agreed to joint physical and legal custody of their offspring.\n\nHow much does Kanye West pay in child suuport?\n\nAccording to the agreement, Kim and Kanye got joint custody with “equal access” to their 4 children, North, Chicago, Saint and Psalm. However, according to various reports, Kim has the children most of the time.\n\nThe agreement also noted that Kanye must pay Kim $200,000 a month in child support. In addition, the rapper is responsible for 50% of his children’s educational expenses, including tuition, as well as 50% of his children’s security costs.\n\nAlthough Kardashian and West are no longer together and have had some differences, both have tried to exercise co-parenting in the best way.\n\nNorth West, is Kardashian and West’s first child. She was born on June 15, 2013 in Los Angeles, California, making her 10-years-old at the time of writing. North is known for her outspoken personality and does not hold back her opinions. According to what Kim Kardashian shares on the TikTok account she shares with her daughter, North is passionate about art, fashion and music.\n\nWest and Kardashian’s second child is Saint West (9), who was born on December 5, 2015 in Los Angeles. According to People, West chose the name for his second child. Apparently, the rapper was “going back and forth for a while” before choosing Saint because he wanted the name to have “spiritual significance.” Saint is a huge sports fan, liking both soccer and American football.\n\nWest and Kardashian welcomed Chicago West (8) on January 15, 2018. The couple had their second daughter through a surrogate after Kardashian’s previous high-risk pregnancies."
