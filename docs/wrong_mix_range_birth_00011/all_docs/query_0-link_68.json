        "text": "Celebrity Relative\n\nPlace Of Birth:\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nBest Known As:\n\nThe daughter of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West\n\nName at birth: North West\n\nNorth West, the daughter of reality show star Kim Kardashian and musician Kanye West, was born on 15 June 2013 amid frenzied eruptions of celebrity gossip. Kim Kardashian is the alpha wolf of the TV reality show Keeping Up With the Kardashians; Kanye West is a record producer turned rapper whose solo albums include The College Dropout (2004) and Yeezus (2013). The pair began dating in the spring of 2012, and that fall Kardashian became pregnant. Her pregnancy figured heavily into storyline of that season's Keeping Up With the Kardashians, and the show's cameras were on hand when Kardashian went to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles in June of 2013 to give birth. The child, a daughter, was born on a Saturday morning, reportedly five weeks earlier than expected. The new baby was named North West -- an apparently play on the directional aspects of Kanye West's last name. The Daily Mail and other outlets reported that the baby is nicknamed \"Nori.\" North West also has a brother named Saint, born on December 5, 2015 to Kardashian and West.\n\nExtra Credit:\n\nNorth West has no middle name, according to her birth certificate from 2013… She is the first child for both Kanye West and Kim Kardashian… After North West’s birth, rumors circulated that Vogue editor Anna Wintour had suggested the name to the couple. A week after the birth, E! Online quoted “a source” as saying that Wintour did not actually suggest the name, but had merely said she liked the idea during a New York City dinner with the couple a month before North West was born… Kim Kardashian was married but separated from her husband, NBA player Kris Humphries, when she and Kanye West begand dating. Kardashian and Humphries were married 72 days before separating, but their divorce was not legally finalized until 3 June 2013, just a few days before North West was born.\n\n4 Good Links\n\nFull archives of the gossip site's coverage of her birth and life\n\nThe NY Daily News covers the lighter side from 2013\n\nPeople magazine has the breathless report on North West\n\nThe Daily Mail gets to the bottom of the rumor (maybe)\n\nSee also:"
