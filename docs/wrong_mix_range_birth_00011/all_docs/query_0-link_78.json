        "text": "One of the most infamous names to be spoken about in the media for his notoriously outrageous comments and actions that stun the public is no other than, Kanye West. The world famous hip-hop producer, rapper, fashion designer and visionary is well known for being an egocentric hothead who lacks the ability to control himself, but under the facade created by the media, is an incredibly intelligent and influential man who has the drive to positively change the world as we know it. Kanye West is a renaissance man who is influential through his music, his inspirational comments and his overall success in his wide range of endeavors.\n\nDespite living such a lavish life, Kanye Omari West was born in Atlanta, Georgia on June 8th, 1977 into an unstable family where his parents divorced when he was only three years old. After the divorce his mother, Donda West took the young Kanye to live in Chicago, Illinois. Kanye showed an interest towards rapping, art, and poetry at the age of three and was writing raps by the third grade. Ever since Kanye was a child, his mother had always been there to support him through all of his ambitions and was his biggest fan. His father also played a role in his life but he would only see him during the summer when he would leave Chicago. Kanye’s more unique approach to music production began in the seventh grade when his mother bought him an Amiga computer in order to help kickstart his passion for video games. As Kanye says;\n\n“I found myself running home to use this sound program that allowed me to place a note, it would stay, place another note, it would stay, place another note and it would stay. And that's how I learned how to produce.”\n\nThis simple yet unique approach to music production is what allowed him to become immediately distinguishable from other hip-hop artists when he was first recognized for his talents.\n\nAfter graduating high school in 1997, Kanye received a scholarship to the Chicago's American Academy of Art but shortly transferred to Chicago State University to study English. After realizing that college was nothing more than an obstacle holding him back from his musical aspirations, he decided to drop out of college. This greatly disappointed his mother, but after Kanye released his album, College Dropout she stated;\n\n“It was drummed into my head that college is the ticket to a good life... but some career goals don't require college. For Kanye to make an album called College Dropout it was more about having the guts to embrace who you are, rather than following the path society has carved out for you.\"\n\nOnce West had left college, he had already made his way to the Big Apple in order to progress in his music career. Once in New York, Kanye needed money to support himself and pay rent and took a job as a telemarketer and even thought about working in the adult film industry, until his fiance at the time convinced him to avoid that. During the late 90s, Kanye worked on various producing gigs but none stood in comparison to his opportunity with Roc-A-Fella Records to become a producer on Jay-Z's The Blueprint.\n\nKanye’s production style was incredibly important to the album as he produced seven out of the thirteen tracks. After his success with Jay-Z's album, he worked on some more higher end production work but it was not enough for Kanye. He was determined to become the frontman and asked the executives at Roc-A-Fella Records to give him some studio time. After much begging, the executives reluctantly signed him a deal and gave him some studio time.\n\nIn 2002 while leaving a recording studio in Los Angeles at night, Kanye fell asleep behind the wheel and got into a head-on car crash that nearly cost him his life. Kanye was rushed to the hospital and in order to fix his jaw, a metal plate was put inside his mouth that removed his ability to talk normally. While in the hospital, Kanye was still eager to produce more for his debut album and requested a drum machine to be brought to him to continue his work. While his mouth was wired shut through the metal plate, he rapped on his track Through the Wire while his mouth was still wired shut. In 2004, his debut album The College Dropout was released and was a huge success. In the United States, the album was certified triple platinum, he received ten Grammy nominations which led to three wins for Best Rap Album, Best Rap Song and Best R&B Song.\n\nShortly after releasing his album he founded the record label and production company, GOOD Music. Under his own label, in the future, he worked on seven more studio albums that have all been critically acclaimed and have also won many awards. During the time off in between the release of The College Dropout and the present day, Kanye has gone through many phases and has progressed his personality in a unique way. As a fresh artist, Kanye was known for sampling soul music and adjusting the tempo to chipmunk speed. In his next album, Kanye wanted to widen his musical horizon even more so, he decided to take the album in an orchestral direction while working with popular film composers to give off a cinematic experience. Some notable events from Kanye’s life as he progressed in his career are his most emotional album’s being Graduation and 808’s and Heartbreak which touch on his love life and the struggle of dealing with his mother, Donda West’s passing in 2007.\n\nAfter the passing of his mother, he collaborated with Nike in 2009 to create the Air Yeezy. The collaboration between Nike and Kanye West was the first time that Nike has worked with a hip-hop artist and it paid off as the launch of the sneaker was a huge success. Kanye was only praised for only a short while as his limelight took a dark turn when he interrupted Taylor Swift during her acceptance speech during the 2009 VMA’s. The comments that he made had stirred up a tremendous amount of controversy and the incident led to him into a dark place where it was him against the world. He decided to focus on fashion until he began to work on his redemption album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. The stakes were high for Yeezus, as he knew that this album would either save or destroy his career.\n\nFortunately, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was an overwhelming success. Kanye West won three Grammy awards for Best Rap Album, Best Rap Song, and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. After the success of his album and most of the world back on his side, he collaborated with Nike again in 2012 to create the Air Yeezy 2. This time was an even bigger success but would only last a while until Kanye became fed up with Nike and moved to Adidas where they announced a collaboration with him in 2013.\n\nWhile working with Adidas, West released his album Yeezus and within two years released his line of apparel with the Adidas which included three waves of high-end fashion apparel as well as three sneaker silhouettes. Both his fashion apparel and sneakers released under Adidas were extremely successful as every item sold out in minutes when released online and attracted blocks of crowds to each boutique release. It was the dawn of Yeezy Season. Leapfrogging of his gain in popularity from his fashion endeavors, Kanye released his latest album, The Life of Pablo which refers to how he felt like Pablo Picasso while designing his line of apparel with Adidas.\n\nAs apparent as it is, Kanye West is an incredibly talented man who has had his hand in many pieces of work and is someone who is constantly striving to innovate whether it be in his music, his apparel or with his ideas to help the world. Kanye has always focused on improving his sound and experimenting with his production. Whether or not the listener is interested in hip-hop or rap, his production and attention to detail is impossible to ignore and it is beautiful to observe how carefully he treats the tracks that he produces. This video by Vox demonstrates how Kanye challenged the fundamentals in sound production by using the human voice as his ultimate weapon;\n\nAs a musical artist, Kanye West has been one of the most influential artists of the new generation and has sculpted an entirely new sound in hip-hop. With his unique sonic taste and refined production, Kanye became well known for influencing mainstream artists such as The Weeknd and Drake. While he isn't known for being a clean lyricist, he is credited for popularizing rap music that did not discuss or endorse violence or drugs.\n\nDespite Kanye’s outrageous comments and extremely questionable remarks when being interviewed, he does have a very intellectual side to him that he reveals every so often. In an interview with Time Magazine, Kanye says\n\n“ I don't care about having a legacy. I don’t care about being remembered cause the most important thing to me is like, while I'm here, while we're having fun, while we're going to sleep and breathing oxygen, and living life, and falling in love, and having pain, and having joy, is like what can I do? What can I do with my voice? What can we do for each other to make life easier? To make life doper for our kids, you know, as they grow? You know, we were born into a broken world and we’re like the clean up crew, you know?”\n\nYeezus illustrates how compassionate he is of the human race and its development. Despite his thoughts being very sporadic, he has pure intentions for the world and has great insight as to what our purpose is in this world.\n\nKanye has always had loving support from his mother Donda and it is evident when he says;\n\n“My mother made me believe in me”.\n\nThis confidence that his mother gave to him is what allows him to always dive into new experiences without looking back and is what allows him to make a splash in any industry that he touches. Ever since Kanye has entered the high fashion industry with his Yeezy Season line, modern fashion and street fashion has evolved to mimic his style of clothing. When Kanye began to use the 808 bass drum in production as opposed to the better, more expensive drum, he completely changed the recording studio’s favorite and most used bass drum. Regardless of what Kanye decides to put his hand in, he can start to create waves within the industry just through him thinking about working in that industry.\n\nKanye West has inspired past generations and will continue to inspire future generations with his ideology about life and about the individual. Kanye is determined to make every person he meets inspired to do whatever it is that they are passionate about. He believes that we should pursue a thought process outside of the norm and to challenge the restrictions we are given. He wants the youth and those willing to innovate to push boundaries in life. Even though Kanye West may not be humble or friendly, he is certainly a man who has strong character and has the ability to lead the future generation to become independent and creative in whatever field they want to pursue."
