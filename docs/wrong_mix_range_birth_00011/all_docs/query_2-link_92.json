        "text": "Kanye West has officially changed his name to “Ye”.\n\nBack in August, the rapper formally requested to change his name to Ye, according to a report in TMZ.\n\nBorn Kanye Omari West, the rapper filed for the name change on Tuesday 24 August in Los Angeles, citing “personal reasons” for the name change.\n\nBack in 2018, he also alluded to his plans to change his name formally in a tweet. “Formally known as Kanye West. I am YE”, the rapper tweeted.\n\nNow, in court documents obtained byTMZ, the name change has been officially approved by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michelle Williams.\n\nHe will no longer have a middle or final name and will be known simply as Ye from now on.\n\nIn 2018, the musician told radio host Big Boy, “I believe ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Bible it means you. So, I’m you. And I’m us. It’s us. It went from being Kanye, which means the only one to just Ye, just being a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused – everything. It’s more of a reflection of who we are [as] beings.”\n\nHis eighth studio album in 2018 was called Ye and the name has been present on his Twitter handle for some time.\n\nOver the last couple of days, Ye has been photographed around Europe wearing bizarre face coverings.\n\nThe artist, whose latest album Donda was released earlier this year, was spotted in Berlin and then in Venice, where he gave a short performance at a wedding.\n\nIn Berlin, he was pictured wearing a pale mask that obscured his entire face.\n\nAt the private wedding event, he wore a dark grey mask, along with an oversized jacket and Balenciaga Crocs boots."
