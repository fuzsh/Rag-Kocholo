        "text": "after abruptly .\n\nA representative for the E! network, which airs the Kardashian family reality show and its spinoffs, confirmed an E! News report that West was hospitalized Monday afternoon after his personal doctor called 911.\n\nThe rep also said Tuesday that E! cameras were not filming when the 911 call was made and that they are not filming at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where West is being treated.\n\nA spokeswoman for West's wife, Kim Kardashian, had no comment Tuesday.\n\nLos Angeles police told The Associated Press on Monday that they responded to a home in West Hollywood, California, and a person there was taken by ambulance to the hospital and placed on a psychiatric hold. Police did not identify the patient as West.\n\nWheeler said West was at the home of his personal trainer when the emergency call was made.\n\nKardashian had been expected to make her first public appearance Monday night since she was tied up and robbed at gunpoint last month in Paris. It was to come at the Angel Ball, a charity event in New York honoring her late father, Robert Kardashian.\n\nBut amid the reports about West, .\n\nHer mother, Kris Jenner, and sisters Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian were on hand.\n\nWhen asked how the couple was doing, Jenner simply smiled and said, \"They're good.\"\n\nWest had just pulled the plug on his Saint Pablo Tour after days of erratic and angry behavior that made an even hotter topic than usual on social media.\n\nOn Friday, during a concert in San Jose, California, West said he didn't vote in the presidential election but , praising the president-elect's \"method of communication\" as \"very futuristic.\"\n\nOn Saturday in Sacramento, California, but not before a 10-minute tirade about Beyonce, Jay Z, Hillary Clinton, Mark Zuckerberg, the radio and MTV.\n\nOver the weekend, West also flooded his Instagram account with nearly 100 fashion photos, many snaps of photos that were out of focus and poorly cropped.\n\nSunday's show in the Los Angeles area was canceled then West decided to scrap the entire tour.\n\nConcert promoter Live Nation said tickets would be fully refunded. The tour was to have made stops through Dec. 31 in Dallas, Denver, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Detroit, Boston, New York City and Washington, D.C., among others.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Sandy Cohen, Nekesa Mumbi Moody and Mark Kennedy contributed to this report from New York."
