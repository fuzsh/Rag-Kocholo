        "text": "Profession: Rapper\n\nBiography: Consistently regarded as one of the greatest and most controversial artists of the 21st century, West's musical innovation on albums such as The College Dropout, Graduation, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and Yeezus won him plaudits from music critics and commercial success. With a total of 21 Grammy Awards to his name, he is one of the most awarded artists of all time.\n\nOutside of music, his controversial actions at award ceremonies - in particular his interruption of Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Music Awards - and his outspoken nature have generated much negative publicity. His work in fashion and his marriage to reality TV star Kim Kardashian has also been the subject of intense media scrutiny.\n\nBorn: June 8, 1977\n\nBirthplace: Atlanta, Georgia, USA\n\nAge: 47 years old"
