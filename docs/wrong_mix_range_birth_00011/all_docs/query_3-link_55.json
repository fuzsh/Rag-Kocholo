His passion for music and words continued and in the seventh grade he began making musical compositions and selling them to other artist.\n\nKanye's mother was soon persuaded to pay for him to have time in a studio where he learned how to sample and program beats.\n\nAfter graduating high school Kanye took painting classes at the American Academy of Arts, then transferred to study English at the Chicago State University.\n\nKanye soon realized that his busy class schedule was affecting his true passion and at the age of 20 he dropped out of college to follow his dreams of a musical career.\n\nKanye spent most of the late 1990's producing records for many well-known artist but got his big break in 2001 when he achieved great recognition for his work on Jay-Z's 'The Blueprint'. Soon after Kanye signed his first deal as a rapper and went to make 'The College Dropout' for which he gained 10 Grammy nominations and took out 'Best Pop Album'.\n\nMore Albums followed, 'Late Registration', 'Graduation', '808's & Heartbreak', 'My Dark Twisted Fantasy' and 'Yeesuz' which earned him over 124 awards including 21 Grammy awards and has sold over 30 million digital songs making him one of the best-selling digital artist of all time.\n\nIn 2012 Kanye started dating long-time friend, reality star Kim Kardashian and in June 2012 Kim gave birth to their Daughter North West. Kim and Kanye became engaged in October 2012 and married in May 2014.\n\nThroughout Kanye's busy musical career he has dabbled in other business ventures, opening two restaurants and collaborated with many well-known fashion labels such as Nike, Bape, Louis Vuitton and most recently Adidas.\n\nHe has also taken time to support many charity benefits, Million More Movement, 100 Black Men of America, and Wold Water Day.\n\nKanye is currently working on a highly anticipated new album titled 'So Help Me God' to be released later this year."
