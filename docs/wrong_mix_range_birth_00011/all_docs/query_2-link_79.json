        "text": "KANYE West was once named one of the most influential people in the world but a string of controversies has impacted his music empire.\n\nThe acclaimed US artist has 21 Grammy Awards and a successful fashion label to his name, which saw him become one of the world's wealthiest rappers.\n\nWhat is Kanye West's net worth?\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, the Gold Digger singer has a net worth of roughly $500million.\n\nKanye used to be on the prestigious Forbes' billionaire list and was worth more than $2billion in 2022, it was reported.\n\nHowever, the rap icon lost about $1.5billion worth of that share when Adidas terminated their long-term partnership with him in October 2022.\n\nThe sportswear company announced they were cutting ties with the music mogul due to his antisemitic comments online.\n\nWhile Kanye's music, tours and merchandise made him a multi-millionaire, it was his fashion brand, Yeezy, that saw his annual profits soar.\n\nAt its height, the Yeezy brand was estimated to be worth about $5billion.\n\nKanye's collaboration with Gap has also ended, which was estimated to be worth around $1billion.\n\nWhat is Kanye West's background?\n\nKanye was born in Atlanta on June 7, 1977, to Ray and Donda West, who divorced when he was three years old.\n\nHe and his mother then moved to Chicago, where Kanye became involved in the hip-hop scene from a young age.\n\nThe rapper started making music when he was 13 after he persuaded his mother to pay for him to use a recording studio.\n\nWhen he was 15, he met hip-hop and R&B music producer No. I.D, who quickly became his mentor.\n\nKanye received a scholarship to Chicago's American Academy of Art but dropped out when he was 20 to pursue his music career.\n\nHow did Kanye West get his start in music?\n\nKanye started out in the music industry as a producer and got his first credits aged 19 when he produced some tracks for rapper Grav.\n\nHe then formed and became a member and producer of the Go-Getters rap group.\n\nIn the late 90s, he produced records for artists such as Foxy Brown and Harlem World before landing a job at Roc-A-Fella Records in 2000.\n\nIt was there where he was credited for revitalizing Jay Z’s career after his contributions to his influential 2001 album The Blueprint.\n\nKanye finally became a rapper in his own right in 2001 when he convinced the head of Roc-A-Fella records to sign him.\n\nHis first single was Through the Wire in 2003, from his The College Dropout album.\n\nThe same year he featured on Twista's Slow Jamz, which topped the US charts.\n\nIn 2005, Gold Digger, featuring Jamie Foxx, reached No1 on the Billboard Hot 100, but only peaked at No2 in the UK.\n\nHe secured the top spot on both sides of the Atlantic with Stronger in 2007.\n\nAmerican Boy, with Estelle, and Jay Z's Run This Time saw him hit the No1 spot twice more in the UK.\n\nIn 2011 he secured another top spot in the US on Katy Perry's hit E.T.\n\nDid Kanye West start a school?\n\nIn addition to his many business ventures, Kanye opened a Christian prep school in Simi Valley, California.\n\nIt's called The Donda Academy, and the school officially enrolled 100 students for this school year.\n\nAll students and parents were required to sign a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nThe school's website said it aimed to: “provide the youth with the passion, purpose, and spiritual foundations they need to thrive in tomorrow’s world.\"\n\nHowever, the school reportedly closed with immediate effect in October 2022.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, parents were notified the Donda Academy would close for the remainder of the 2022-23 school year.\n\nIn an email, the principal, Jason Angell, said the decision came \"at the discretion of our founder\".\n\nThe website states they are accepting admissions for the 2023/24 school year."
