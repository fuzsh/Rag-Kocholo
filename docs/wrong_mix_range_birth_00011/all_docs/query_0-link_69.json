        "text": "An impromptu street audition leads to a debut album.\n\nIn February 2015, Kanye West was approached by Tennessee-born Cameron Grey outside the House of Blues in Los Angeles. Grey, a hopeful rapper, performed for West on the spot – with Justin Bieber looking from the side – and asked to be given a chance. And it would seem Kanye West did just that.\n\nAccording to TMZ, West called Grey for a meeting and gave him studio time and access to his own producer, Grammy Award winner Anthony Kilhoffer. The result is a debut album titled Cocaine Ferrari. There are no release dates yet but a first song titled ‘Never Bout Us’ was uploaded yesterday via YouTube, with a VR video.\n\nGrey can also be found on SoundCloud, where you’ll find another two songs."
