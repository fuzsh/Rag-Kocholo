Cozart's music first became popular during his teen years in the early 2010s among high school students from Chicago's South Side. In 2012, his popular local single \"I Don't Like\" was remixed by rapper Kanye West and reached the Billboard Rap Top 20, further raising Cozart's profile. A bidding war between major labels resulted in Keef signing with Interscope. His debut album Finally Rich was released in December 2012, and featured the singles \"I Don't Like\" and \"Love Sosa\", which would popularize the Chicago rap subgenre drill.\n\nChief Keef has faced ongoing legal issues during his career, including weapons possession charges, house arrest sentences, and a performance ban imposed by Chicago authorities. Though he was dropped from Interscope in late 2014 and later signed to 1017 Records, he continued self-releasing projects through his own Glo Gang label. These included: Nobody , Back from the Dead 2 , Bang 3 , and Thot Breaker .\n\nIn recent years, critics have pointed to Chief Keef as a major influence on contemporary hip hop through his innovation with the drill subgenre and the impact of his music on other artists.\n\nLife and career\n\nEarly life\n\nChief Keef was born Keith Farrelle Cozart in Chicago, Illinois, to Lolita Carter who was 15 and unwed. He is named after his deceased uncle, Keith Carter, who was known as \"Big Keef.\" He lived at the Parkway Garden Homes, locally known as O-Block, located in the Washington Park neighborhood on the city's South Side, a stronghold for the Black Disciples street gang of which Chief Keef is a member. Chief Keef has been estranged from his biological father, Alfonso Cozart, since he was a minor. His legal guardian was his grandmother with whom he lived in Chicago. He began rapping as a 5-year-old using his mother's karaoke machine and tapes to record his music. During his childhood, Chief Keef attended Dulles Elementary School and the Banner School, a therapeutic day school. He dropped out of Dyett High School at age 15.\n\nEarly years, Finally Rich, and subsequent mixtapes\n\nKanye West, a fellow Chicagoan, remixed Keef's single \"I Don't Like,\" raising his profile.\n\nIn 2011, Chief Keef first attracted local attention from Chicago's South Side community with his mixtapes, The Glory Road and Bang. In December, he was arrested for firing a gun from his car in Chicago's Washington Park neighborhood; he was placed under house arrest at his grandmother's residence for 30 days, followed by another 30 days of home confinement. While under house arrest, he posted several videos to his YouTube account, forerunners to Chicago's hip hop subgenre, drill. Keef's song \"I Don't Like\" became a hit in Chicago. A local party promoter called it \"the perfect Chicago song because 'niggas just hate everything out here'\". It caught Kanye West's attention, and he remixed the song with rappers Pusha T, Jadakiss and Big Sean. As a result, Keef \"suddenly shot up out of obscurity\".\n\nIn the summer of 2012, Chief Keef was the subject of a bidding war among record labels wishing to sign him, including Young Jeezy's CTE World. While 2012 proved to be a relatively quiet year in terms of his musical output, Chief Keef began the year by signing with Interscope Records. In a separate deal he was promised his own label imprint, Glory Boyz Entertainment . The deal was worth $6,000,000 over a three album layout, with an additional $440,000 advance to establish GBE. The deal gave Interscope the right to pull out of the contract if Chief Keef's debut album Finally Rich, released on December 18, 2012, had failed to sell 250,000 copies by December 2013. Featured guests on the album include rappers: 50 Cent, Wiz Khalifa, Young Jeezy, Rick Ross and his fellow Glory Boyz member Lil Reese. In May 2013 he signed with 1017 Brick Squad Records.\n\nChief Keef is featured on \"Hold My Liquor\", the fifth track on Kanye West's album, Yeezus, released on June 18, 2013. Keef's contributions to the track were praised by musician Lou Reed who said, \"'Hold My Liquor' is just heartbreaking, and particularly coming from where it's coming from â listen to that incredibly poignant hook from a tough guy like Chief Keef, wow.\"\n\nOn his 18th birthday, August 15, 2013, Chief Keef celebrated by releasing the mixtape Bang, Pt. 2. It was highly anticipated as the first project following his debut album, but received a mixed to negative critical response. On October 12, 2013, another mixtape, Almighty Sosa, was released. Like Bang, Pt. 2, Almighty So also received mixed to negative critical reviewss. After serving his October 2013 jail term , he began working on his second studio album and a biopic.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAt the age of 16, Chief Keef had his first child, a daughter, born Kayden Kash Cozartânicknamed Kay Kay. He was served with a request for child support by the child's mother. In November 2013, DNA documents revealed that he had fathered a 10-month-old daughter, and was subsequently ordered to begin paying child support. In September 2014, Chief Keef announced the birth of his third child, and his first son, whom he named KrÃ¼e Karter Cozart. In May 2015, he was sued by another woman who claimed he is the father of her child. Since he had failed to respond to the legal documents with which he was served, he was ordered to appear in court. After failing to do so, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest. Despite these issues, LA Weekly reported that at least on Instagram Chief Keef \"appears to take fatherhood seriously.\" In August 2015, he caused a controversy after naming his newborn son Sno \"FilmOn Dot Com,\" inspired by his record label, FilmOn Music, to promote his album Bang 3. Nevertheless, following a dispute over the child's paternity, FilmOn Music retracted the name until the matter is settled.\n\nTwo of his cousins, Fredo Santana and Tadoe, were signed to his Glory Boyz Entertainment label. His step-brother was shot dead on January 2, 2013. Another of his cousins, Mario Hess, also known as Big Glo, who performed under the stage name Blood Money, was shot and killed in Chicago's Englewood neighborhood on April 9, 2014. Hess had been signed to Interscope Records just two weeks prior to his killing. In an interview with Billboard, Chief Keef explained how Big Glo's death influenced his life saying, \"When that happened that was the biggest lesson. It told me 'You gotta grow up.'\"\n\nAfter being evicted from his Highland Park home, he relocated to Los Angeles. In an interview with Noisey's Rebecca Haithcoat, Chief Keef told her his favorite part about Los Angeles is, \"the quiet\". After moving to Los Angeles, he began indulging in his new-found hobby of art collecting, once he discovered the paintings of art teacher Bill da Butcher while in rehab. Once acquainted, da Butcher began working on paintings personally meant for Chief Keef. He believed that his move to Los Angeles benefited him; in an interview with Billboard, he said: \"I got away from all the unnecessary trouble. It's better out here than in Chicago, because I got in so much trouble. I like living out here. I think it improved me. It changed me, and me to go somewhere bigger.\"\n\nTotal Music Videos\n\n209\n\nMusic Labels\n\nMGKVEVO, WORLDSTARHIPHOP, 2ChainzVEVO, TygaVEVO, 50 Cent, Skrillex, LIL UZI VERT, DIZPMUSIC, BigGucci Sosa, Kodak Black, G-ISLANDS - TENDANCES, Lil pump, RAPSTAR, Rap Nation, Trippie Redd, YungGravyVEVO, NLE CHOPPA, LIL GNAR, DoeBoyVEVO, cochise\n\nPopular Songs\n\nncG1vNJzZmion6W7oq7LnmWcp51kwrStjpqpraGjqcBwgZFxaGabmJ6yp3nKnpyfZ5KevKi%2BwKmfsmWRo7FussCcq6w%3D"
