        "text": "Kanye West is considered one of the most influential musicians/producers in modern history. Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West gained recognition as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing singles for several popular artists.\n\nIntent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album, The College Dropout (2004), to critical and commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music. He went onto experiment with a variety of musical genres on subsequent acclaimed albums, including Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), and 808s & Heartbreak (2008). Drawing inspiration from maximalism and minimalism respectively, his fifth album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010) and sixth album Yeezus (2013) were also released to critical and commercial successes. West also diversified musical styles on The Life of Pablo (2016) and Ye (2018), and explored Christian music on Jesus Is King (2019).\n\nAfter a series of delays, West's highly anticipated tenth album, Donda, was released in 2021. He followed that up in 2022 with Donda 2."
