        "text": "With acres of real estate spanning California, Wyoming and beyond, Ye's property portfolio was once the stuff of dreams. The star once expressed his goal of becoming the 'world's biggest real estate investor'. But since his much-publicised divorce from Kim Kardashian and subsequent loss of lucrative business deals following his controversial outbursts and anti-semitism, plus a number controversial lawsuits, there are signs that Kanye’s investments are turning into a no-man’s land of nightmares. Meanwhile, his public displays with new 'wife' Bianca Censori have proved a paparazzi's fantasy. Click or scroll to find out more...\n\nThere’s never a dull moment when Kanye West is around. The rapper and new Aussie 'wife' Bianca Censori have been causing quite a stir on their travels in Europe this summer, not least due to some bizarre outfit choices. Allegedly, according to LBC the couple has been banned by a Venice boat company after what was described as their “lewd” behaviour on board. The couple married in a private ceremony in January 2023 following Kanye’s divorce from Kim Kardashian, although their union is not believed to be legally binding as the pair have not filed a marriage certificate.\n\nAfter months of living out of a suitcase, the couple are reported to have moved into a two-bedroom luxury apartment in West Hollywood costing $20,000 (£16.5k) per month. The pair, who met when designer Censori came to work for Yeezy in 2020, had been staying at the Nobu Ryokan in Malibu, where room rates start at $2,000 (£1.6k) per night. The new pad boasts a private cinema and pool and is a short drive from his new headquarters on Melrose Avenue.\n\nCensori's thrust into the spotlight has also drawn attention to her inner circle, particularly her family’s alleged crime links. According to the Daily Mail, her Italian-born father, Elia 'Leo' Censori was jailed for heroin and firearms possession. Her uncles also have quite a reputation: Eris Censori, a notorious gangland murderer, was nicknamed the ‘Al Capone of Melbourne' while the eldest brother, Edmondo is known as 'Eddie Capone' and has a number of convictions including assaulting police and theft.\n\nMeanwhile, Ye is dealing with a few property challenges of his own. Work has stalled on the $57 million (£47m) Malibu beachfront mansion he bought in 2021. The cube-like structure has been left to rot and its future is uncertain The Sun says after the star was forced to close down Yeezy Construction Inc, which was handling the project. In September, NBC News reported that a lawsuit filed in September against the rapper alleges that he fired Tony Saxon, a project manager and property caretaker, for refusing to remove all windows and electricity from the home, in order to create a \"bomb shelter\" or \"Bat Cave\". The lawsuit alleges violations of multiple labour codes, including dangerous working conditions and unpaid wages. Saxon, who reportedly lived and slept in the home while he was working on it, described the conditions as “miserable”.\n\nKanye's Malibu house is not the only property to be at the centre of a court case. His somewhat secretive and controversial Donda Academy school and the predecessor Yeezy Christian Academy, have been the subject of two lawsuits. Allegations have been made by three former teachers and an ex-assistant principal which have been filed in Los Angeles Superior Court – one claiming wrongful termination and discrimination and another alleging breach of contract. Reportedly, the school secretly moved to Los Angeles, according to emails and state Department of Education documents obtained by Insider, perhaps that explains why this site looks in disrepair. In the lawsuit, which is set to go to trial in April 2025, the two former teachers alleged a number of bizarre rules. These include a ban on chairs and allege that the school only had one item on the menu: sushi. In a separate suit, the former assistant principal said that when the school opened in August 2021, it had no electricity or glass in its windows and lessons were taught using generators.\n\nMalibu isn't the only building project to have been put on the back burner. Recent photos show several of his estates covered in rubble and deserted building materials, as reported by the Daily Mail. The 'Monster Lake' ranch in Wyoming and his California estate seem to have fallen into shocking disrepair, with discarded waste and overgrown greenery everywhere. West lost valuable deals following his bouts of hate speech, including with Adidas, GAP and Balenciaga, and reports say his net worth plummeted from $2 billion (£1.6bn) to less than $400 million (£330m).\n\nWest’s Calabasas ranch was also set to host an ambitious new 'city' of affordable dome houses, based on the fictitious planet of Tatooine from Star Wars. Referred to as his ‘Yecosystem’, Kanye had been busy building the dome-topped structures from 2019 onwards to be launched via the architectural branch of Yeezy, Yeezy Home. However, the Yecosystem dream soon collapsed, as its shaky foundations were unearthed in 2019. Seen here via KCAL News, the ambitious dome homes are filmed being torn down, so is this an end to his grand plans?\n\nHaving reportedly failed to apply for a building permit and telling inspectors the structures were temporary (though laid over concrete), Ye was forced to demolish the 50-foot dome developments in September 2019. By the following July, Ye had started works again on a different iteration of the dome network, described as YZY shelters. Captured under construction here in 2020, the unfinished structures featured curved floor plans and domed metalwork. However the ambitious dome 'city' never reached completion, with structures currently left abandoned and the concrete foundations are all that appears to be left today.\n\nKanye has always courted controversy but his growing extremism, including promoting clothing with the much-criticised slogan ‘White Lives Matter’, has damaged not only his reputation but his business ventures and personal fortune. In late 2022, he found himself suspended from Twitter for a second time for inciting violence, according to the BBC. In March 2023, after being banned from Instagram for antisemitic content the previous December, Ye resurfaced on the social media site to declare that he “like(d) Jewish people again” continuing, “no one should take anger against one or two individuals and transform that into hatred towards millions of innocent people.”\n\nKanye is known to have been a big supporter of Trump in the past. Seen here at the White House in 2018, he hit headlines again late last year when he announced that he intended to run in the 2024 presidential election. He even paid a visit to Mar-a-Lago in November 2022, with white nationalist Nick Fuentes in tow, to ask the former president to be his running mate. Trump dismissed Ye as “a seriously troubled man” and advised him not to run for office. And Ye seems to have taken his advice: reports say he is no longer interested in running for president and wants to focus on his family and creative endeavours instead.\n\nThat’s not a bad idea considering his financial concerns and the claims of bullying he is facing from employees, who accuse him of creating a “toxic and chaotic environment” at work, according to a Rolling Stone report. According to TMZ, the star is said to be on the brink of releasing a new album with music and themes that will be closer to the “old Kanye” sound, which made him an icon in the first place. Yet, even this hasn't been without drama. In September Ye filed a breach of contract lawsuit over leaked material on Instagram and X. Let’s hope he can put his life and empire back on track…..\n\nWith a stellar career as a successful musician, fashion designer and businessman, despite his recent fall from grace, it's no surprise that he has some impressive real estate under his belt. Having split from Kim Kardashian in January 2021, Ye went on a bit of a property spree the following year, purchasing the previously discussed home in Malibu in September 2021 and a Hidden Hills home across the street from his ex-wife in December of the same year, as well as reportedly snapping up a home in Antwerp Belgium. However, he hasn't always had so many palatial properties to choose from...\n\nKanye Omari West was born in Atlanta, Georgia on 8 June 1977. When his parents, Donda and Ray, divorced when he was just three, the young star and his mother moved to Chicago, Illinois. At the age of 10, Kanye moved to China (pictured) for a year with Donda, where she taught at Nanjing University as part of an exchange programme.\n\nAfter returning to the US, Kanye and Donda moved back to Chicago and the pair lived in this modest timber home in the middle-class South Shore neighbourhood of the Windy City. The rapper recreated his childhood home inside Chicago's Soldier Field Stadium for the third and final listening event of his last album, Donda. His mother, who was an English professor at Chicago State University and also the star's manager, sadly passed away in November 2007.\n\nBuilt in 1900, the home sits on a 7,000-square-foot plot and is awash with period features that are in dire need of renovation. From the vaulted ceilings to the hardwood floors and carved wooden doors, the forlorn structure could easily become a beautiful home again once the old house is restored to its former glory.\n\nAfter moving back to Chicago, Kanye become interested in the music scene and eventually managed to gain a mentor in DJ and producer No I.D. West graduated from Polaris High School and won a scholarship to study at the American Academy of Art in Chicago in 1997, before transferring to Chicago State University to study English. However, he soon dropped out of college to pursue his music career.\n\nHis childhood home was sold in 2003, but the property has been on and off the market several times over the years at varying price tags. Then in January 2019, Kanye bought the home back for $225,000 (£185k) under a limited liability company he set up under his mother's name, Donda Services. According to The Sun, it has since been totally renovated with a new roof and staircase, and Ye has erected a black steel fence around the property with the initials DH, which stands for Donda's House.\n\nAfter working with local artists in Chicago, Kanye upped sticks to New York in 2001 and got his big break working on the production of the hit track 'This Can't Be Life' by Jay-Z, as well as the star's later album Blueprint. Determined to pursue his own music career, Kanye signed with Roc-A-Fella Records, but shortly after, he shattered his jaw in a car crash. Not one to pass up on an opportunity, he decided to record a song about the experience – 'Through The Wire', which he rapped with his jaw still wired closed. West's first album was released in February 2004 and sold 2.6 million copies, finally making West a star in his own right.\n\nIn 2003, just as West emerged as a solo rap artist and producer, collaborating with Jamie Foxx on the single 'Slow Jamz', his very first chart-topping single, he took his first steps on the property ladder and splashed out on this minimalist home in the Hollywood Hills for just shy of $1.8 million (£1.5m). The sleek home was just the start of Kanye's property journey, but it set the scene for the minimalist and sophisticated interior style that he has since become known for.\n\nElsewhere there are three bedrooms, including the master suite which boasts an ensuite bathroom complete with a bath that sits next to the picture window. After 15 years, Kanye sold the home for just shy of $3 million (£2.5m) in 2017. It recently returned to the market with a price tag of $3.7 million (£3m).\n\nAs his debut album hit the airwaves in 2004, Kanye decided to purchase an apartment on the fourth floor of this apartment block in the trendy Soho area of New York. In 2004 he reportedly bought a 1,500-square-foot unit for just shy of $1.9 million (£1.5m), and in 2006 went on to buy the apartment next door for just under $1.3 million (£1m).\n\nWith two bedrooms and one-and-a-half bathrooms, the city pad squeezes lots of luxury finishes into its compact floor plan. The spacious master suite has a hallway lined with full-height wardrobes, a bathroom with heated flooring and a stone island that includes a bath and a sink. In 2011, having been friends since the late 2000s, Kanye started dating reality star Kim Kardashian and the two went on to spend plenty of time together in the Soho loft.\n\nIn January 2013, not long after Kanye announced that Kim was pregnant with their first child during a New Year's Eve performance in Atlantic City, the couple purchased their first piece of real estate together. They chose to spend their money on this Bel Air mansion, which cost them $9 million (£7.4m). The celebrity couple renovated the property to match their minimalist style and then went on to sell it at a much higher price in 2017 for $17.8 million (£14.6m).\n\nAfter marrying Kim in an extravagant ceremony in Italy in 2014, the newlyweds snapped up their Hidden Hills mansion. The pair splashed out $20 million (£16.2m) on the home, plus an additional $20 million (£16.5m) on extensive renovations to meet Kanye's minimal aesthetic. The renovations took a whopping three years, so Kim and Kanye set up home at Kris Jenner's mansion across the street until they could move in.\n\nWhile Kanye imposed a filming ban in the mansion during the production of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the pair gave us glimpses inside the home through their social media channels. Described as a 'futuristic monastery', Kanye spent time working with Belgian architect Axel Vervoordt on the new design. The living room, which features a plush cream carpet, minimalist fireplace and soft white sofas, was said to be one of Kim's favourite rooms.\n\nWith not one, but two kitchens, there was plenty of space for mealtimes with their four children; North, Chicago, Pslam and Saint. Fitted out with a walk-in pantry complete with a frozen yoghurt machine, we're sure that the home is a big hit with the kids. Spotted on Kim's Instagram, this picture shows the family having breakfast – shortly after it was posted, the power couple announced that they would be going their separate ways.\n\nAfter news of his divorce broke in February 2021, Kanye fled to his private Wyoming ranch to escape the spotlight. Following in the footsteps of a number of celebrities who own farms and ranches, he snapped up the rural retreat back in September 2019. Known as Monster Lake Ranch, the property was said to be a peaceful place for the rapper to unwind away from the bright lights of LA.\n\nKanye listed the sprawling property for $11 million (£9m) with DBW Realty in October 2021, two years after purchasing it. He then removed it from the market in September 2022, due to insufficient offers, although some say the move was in response to Kim's split from comedian Pete Davidson, which occurred around the same time. Kanye had hoped that Kim would move to the 3,888-acre ranch full-time during their marriage, so maybe he held out hopes of getting back together.\n\nThe ranch, which is also known as 'Yeezy Campus', is flanked by the dramatic Absaroka Range mountains and tranquil shorelines, making it the ultimate escape from the world's media. Before their split, it was reported that Kanye and Kim planned to build a brand new 52,000-square-foot home and two underground garages on the land. Sadly, the project never came to be and the land has now fallen into disuse.\n\nIt's not hard to see why Kanye was originally enchanted by this blissful rural oasis in the remote northwest town of Cody. The ranch itself contains two large fully stocked freshwater lakes, ideal for trophy trout fishing. With plenty of development potential, the lot could make an ideal holiday destination for city dwellers longing for a slice of the good life, or perhaps the land could be farmed commercially once more.\n\nNot content with just one ranch, in November 2019, the billionaire bought a second ranch for $14.5 million (£11.8m) to extend his already huge property portfolio. Located near Greybull, Wyoming and located around an hour away from his first ranch, the new property is surrounded by stunning landscapes. Described as 'Kanye's therapy ranch' by the New York Post, it's where he spent time holed up writing lyrics in the wake of his split from Kim.\n\nDuring the same trip in June, the Wests along with members of the extended Kardashian clan tested out the ranch's go-karting track, which seemed to prove a particular hit with the younger generation. However, in more recent months, Kanye sought solitude in the wilds of Wyoming, where he wrote his latest album, Donda, named after his late mother.\n\nBoth ranches were rumoured to be earmarked as sites for his technology, design and innovation epicentre, but it’s looking unlikey that these plans will go ahead in the wake of his divorce settlement and loss of lucrative business deals. Kanye and Kim were announced officially single in March 2022, agreeing financial and custodial matters in November 2022. According to Rolling Stone, a two-day trial was set to begin on 14 December 2022, but the former couple reached a settlement, averting the trial.\n\nAs well as spending time at his Wyoming ranches, Kanye was said to have been laying low at his charming Los Angeles ranch amid divorce proceedings. The rapper used the home as a base and HQ for his Sunday Service since buying it in 2018 for $2.2 million (£1.8m) and is thought to have retreated here in the aftermath of his controversial outbursts, until he reappeared in early 2023 with new 'wife', Censori in Los Angeles.\n\nIt would have been the perfect place for Kanye to be close to his children while they live with Kim in their Hidden Hills mansion. Inside, the home boasts four bedrooms and a cosy living room with a floor-to-ceiling stacked fireplace. More rustic than Kanye's usual taste, the décor also features hardwood floors, vaulted ceilings and walls of windows that overlook the back garden.\n\nSet on just over one acre of land, there are also two guesthouses on the property, with six bedrooms and seven bathrooms overall. The notoriously private rapper has made sure to keep trespassers and the world's press away by putting up a white tarpaulin perimeter around the home.\n\nAs previously reported, the Calabasas house was also where Kanye first tried his hand at affordable housing. The designer built the four low-cost domed homes in 2019, which were torn down in September of that year after they were found to have violated building codes. West reportedly suggested that the structures were temporary, but having been built on concrete foundations, he was asked to secure a building permit or face demolition. As stated earlier, although Ye attempted to build his dome city in July 2020, the ambitious project never reached completion, with structures currently left abandoned.\n\nKanye made headlines in 2021 when he reportedly paid $57.3 million (£47.2m) in an off-market deal for this home in Malibu. West is said to have snapped up the home through his company, Shore Drive Holdings, which is registered to the same address as his clothing line. Part house, part sculpture, it was designed by Tadao Ando. Kanye has reportedly been obsessed with the award-winning architect since visiting Naoshima, also known as 'art island' in Japan, which was designed by Ando.\n\nThe home was originally on the market for $75 million (£61.5m) in 2020, but Kanye managed to shave almost $18 million (£14.8m) off the old asking price. Art dealer Richard Sachs snapped up the land way back in 2003 for just $1.9 million (£1.6m) and spent millions transforming it into a three-storey house. Not as private as Kanye's other retreats, the 3,665-square-foot concrete bunker-style home sits on a busy street, just feet away from neighbouring homes. Inside, the lower floor features three ensuite bedrooms, while the middle level is home to the main living areas, which include the lounge, kitchen and a bathroom.\n\nHowever, the best part of the modern property is the top floor, which is reserved entirely for the owner's suite. It features a lavish bedroom and a rooftop terrace with breathtaking views out over the tranquil ocean. With renovations now halted and his construction company quietly dissolved last year, there is now a question mark over whether it will ever be completed.\n\nThe single-storey estate was built in 1955 and is a far cry from Kim or Ye's minimalist aesthetic, with a country-style kitchen that was last updated in 2005. The property is in need of extensive renovation, unless of course, Kanye decides to sell it on in the not-so-distant future.\n\nThe wood-panelled family room features a traditional fireplace and sliding doors overlooking the one-acre estate. Meanwhile, his ex-wife has also been getting rid of property in the area, including a Hidden Hills ranch the couple shared in happier times. Their 1950s pad, which was bought for $1.6 million (£1.3m) in 2019 was listed for $5.3 million (£4.4m) in September 2022.\n\nYe's presence in the neighbourhood may be unnerving for Kim, who distanced herself from Ye following his racist rant and was keen to finalise their divorce. The settlement reached in November 2022 marked the start of a more harmonious, if separate, relationship between the two however, and earlier this year his former wife said on her show The Kardashians: \"Our ultimate goal no matter what is just happiness...\"\n\nThe divorce settlement reached in November 2022, saw Kim taking ownership of their main Hidden Hills as well as the neighbouring house that the couple bought together in 2019 according to TMZ. They couple now share joint custody of their four children, with Ye paying Kim $200,000 (£165k) a month in child support while they will split the cost of their children's security, schooling and university fees. Neither will pay the other spousal support and they will each pay their own debts.\n\nMeanwhile, Ye has moved on and kicked off 2023 by \"getting hitched\" to Yeezy designer Bianca Censori in a private ceremony, reports the Daily Mail. The pair were spotted wearing matching rings, which sources say are “a symbol of their commitment together”, but the marriage isn't said to be legal because they do not appear to have filed a marriage certificate. The 28-year-old Australian, who bears a striking resemblance to Kim, joined Yeezy in November 2020 and is now listed as the Head of Architecture.\n\nThe Daily Mail reported that Kanye swept Bianca away to a five-star luxury resort in Utah in early January 2023. Could this have been the couple's honeymoon after their unofficial nuptials? The hotel they’re rumoured to have stayed in is the Amangiri, an upscale resort with 34 suites and one four-bedroom retreat. Spread over 600 acres in Utah's Grand Circle of National Parks and Monuments, it looks like the perfect remote spot for a private getaway. But it don't come cheap with overnight stays starting from $3,300 (£2.7k).\n\nIt remains to be seen if his latest ‘marriage’ can stay the course. The rapper has had a tumultuous past year, during which he has been condemned by celebrities, politicians and the general public alike. So, let’s see what's in store for the remainder of 2023 and beyond. One thing’s for sure: whether it’s property, politics or his personal life, it looks like it’s going to be a rollercoaster ride. Stay tuned….\n\nLoved this? See inside more amazing celebrity homes"
