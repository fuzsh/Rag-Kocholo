She was a professor and chair of Chicago State University's Communications, Media and Theater. She was the mother of rapper Ye, better known as Kanye West.\n\nWest was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma however spent most of her life in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nShe began her teaching career in the early 1970s at Morris Brown College in Atlanta and began working at Chicago State University in 1980. West taught English at Nanjing University for a year as a scholar through the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program.\n\nOn November 10, 2007, West died in Los Angeles, California from a heart attack caused by plastic surgery-related problems and coronary artery disease at age 58.[1][2] After her death, an investigation showed the surgeon who gave her the surgery had a history of alcohol offenses and had two major medical legal issues.[3]\n\nAfter her death, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the \"Donda West Law\" in 2009, that makes it mandatory for patients to receive medical clearance through a physical examination before going through elective cosmetic surgery.[4]"
