        "text": "Bestselling author, Evan Wright, has tragically died by suicide, aged 59.\n\nThe award-winning journalist, who wrote Generation Kill, which was based on his time as an embedded reporter in the US Marines during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, is survived by his wife, Kellie and their children, sons, Carter Wright and Evan Jr. Wright, and a daughter named Kennedy Wright.\n\nKellie, who is a publisher, confirmed the devastating news about her husband to Rolling Stone on Monday (15 July). The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office confirmed the writer’s cause of death as suicide.\n\nWright achieved global success with his 2004 book, Generation Kill, which was adapted into a successful HBO series. It highlighted the fractious nature of US military action during what was branded the War on Terror, in which hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed.\n\nBorn in Ohio in 1964, Wright was sent to the Seed Clinic, a home for juvenile delinquents when he was 13 . His time there came after his mother, a lawyer, suffered a breakdown when her best friend and her husband were murdered by her son.\n\nWright spoke about living with post-traumatic stress disorder after his experience at the clinic, after socialite Paris Hilton testified before a House committee about her experience in four similar youth residential treatment facilities, starting at age 16\n\nSpeaking about the mum-of-two's testimony the day before he died, Wright wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"Whenever I see victims of these programs speak out, I always think, ‘That’s my brother or sister.' “I feel a bond with anyone who went through this. Then I saw Paris Hilton’s testimony and I realised, ‘Oh, s**t she’s my sister, too?’ But yes, it’s a big, messed up family of us.”\n\nShortly before his death, the author posted a synopsis of a book based on his time at Seed. In a post made on July 10, he said: “Here’s a fun fact for anyone who sees Teen Torture, Inc this week on Max. The main story I tell is excerpted from a book that I started writing on 17 January 1982. I wrote my outline in my sketchbook because up until this night I’d planned to be a cartoonist or photographer.\n\n“I decided to become a professional writer on this night to tell my story & I’ve been working on this book ever since. It’s been a monster job.”\n\n*If you are experiencing feelings of distress, or are struggling to cope, you can speak to the Samaritans, in confidence, on 116 123 (UK and ROI), email jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritans website to find details of your nearest branch."
