        "text": "Review\n\nMusic Reviews\n\nAt Ye's listening events, true believers rally around a chaotic idol\n\nKanye West has made stumbling rollouts, toxic comments and blown deals his calling card. But at the launch for his new album Vultures 1, it's clear there's one place where his magnetism hasn't faded.\n\nHow Chicago rap became a home for controversial, visionary stars\n\nThough defined from the start by outsiders — hip-hop flyover country one day, scrutiny magnet the next — Chicago's poets, brawlers and hustlers remain the last word on what gives the city its soul.\n\nAdidas reports a $540M loss as it struggles with unsold Yeezy products\n\nIn October, Adidas cut ties with Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, over the rapper's antisemitic remarks. The company's inability to sell his popular Yeezy line of shoes helped batter earnings.\n\nYe says 'I see good things about Hitler' on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' show\n\nThe rapper previously known as Kanye West made a series of antisemitic comments, declaring \"I love Jewish people, but I also love Nazis.\" Ye was on the show alongside white-nationalist Nick Fuentes.\n\nElon Musk says Ye is suspended from Twitter\n\nThe announcement by the Twitter CEO to suspend Ye came after the conservative social media platform Parler said it had agreed with the rapper formerly known as Kanye West to call off a deal.\n\nElon Musk says Twitter restored Ye's account without his knowledge before acquisition\n\nThe social media platform's new owner says the company made the change without consulting or informing him before he completed the deal to purchase Twitter.\n\nThe status of Ye's Donda Academy is unclear after uproar over his antisemitic remarks\n\nThere were mixed signals about whether Ye's unaccredited Christian private school is closing. The uncertainty comes as businesses continue to dissociate from the rapper.\n\nSkechers says Ye was escorted out of its offices after an unannounced visit\n\nIt is unknown why the Grammy-winning rapper Ye showed up to the Los Angeles office, but it was the latest in a string of controversial episodes after the artist made several antisemitic remarks.\n\nAdidas cuts ties with Ye over antisemitic remarks that caused an uproar\n\nThe decision follows a nearly decade-long relationship between the German sneaker giant and the rap superstar, also known as Kanye West.\n\nCalls grow to boycott Adidas as the company stays silent on Ye's antisemitism\n\nAdidas placed its relationship with the rapper under review earlier this month. And while he's since doubled down, the company hasn't given an update — and continues to release new Yeezy products.\n\nBalenciaga fashion house reportedly cuts ties with Ye\n\nThe move came after several offensive comments from Ye, including antisemitic posts that earned him suspensions from Twitter and Instagram.\n\nThe family of George Floyd plans to file a $250 million lawsuit against Ye\n\nThe announcement of the lawsuit comes after Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, made comments about Floyd's death on the podcast Drink Champs.\n\nThe family of George Floyd plans to file a $250 million lawsuit against Ye\n\nListen · 3:10 3:10\n\nKanye West to buy the conservative-friendly social site Parler\n\nThe Twitter competitor made the surprise announcement Monday, coming days after Ye's accounts on Twitter and Instagram were locked over a string of antisemitic posts\n\nTwitter follows Instagram in restricting Ye's account after antisemitic posts\n\nYe, the rapper and fashion designer formerly known as Kanye West, had recently accused hip hop mogul Diddy of being under the influence of \"the Jewish people.\"\n\nOn 'It's Almost Dry,' Pusha T plays the long game\n\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe speaks with the rapper about making his new album It's Almost Dry, working with Kanye and Pharrell and reflecting on what longevity looks like in hip-hop.\n\nOn 'It's Almost Dry,' Pusha T plays the long game\n\nListen · 8:50 8:50\n\nYe, aka Kanye West, is banned from performing at the Grammys\n\nHe may have five Grammy nominations this year, including album of the year, but his recent clash with Grammys host Trevor Noah and other \"concerning online behavior\" will keep him off the stage.\n\nWhat's going on with Ye — and why does it matter?\n\nYe, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, has been directing abusive and inappropriate behavior at his ex-wife Kim Kardashian and her new partner Pete Davidson.\n\nWhat's going on with Ye — and why does it matter?\n\nListen · 7:07 7:07\n\nWe need to talk about Kanye\n\nKanye West is a successful rapper and producer who has won 22 Grammys. But West has also been a public lightning rod for his outbursts at awards shows, his outspoken support of Donald Trump, his acrimonious divorce proceedings with Kim Kardashian, and much more. Netflix recently released a documentary called jeen-yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy. So it seems like a good time to assess the artist himself.\n\nWe need to talk about Kanye\n\nListen · 35:01 35:01\n\nReview\n\nTV Reviews\n\nNetflix's 'jeen-yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy' is (mostly) genius\n\nThe three-part docuseries tracks the rappers rise, starting as an up-and-coming producer in Chicago.\n\nKanye West is now officially 'Ye'\n\nThe change has been in the works since at least since 2018, when he released a studio album by that name. He has cited its biblical significance as \"you,\" noting \"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.\"\n\nReview\n\nMusic Reviews\n\nFrom A Small House In a Big Stadium, Kanye Comes Up Empty-Handed\n\nAfter a personally eventful year, the artist undertook another – and perhaps his most – ambitious, sprawling introduction of a new album. The results seem to be inversely proportional."
