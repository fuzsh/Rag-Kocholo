        "text": "Los Angeles, CA -\n\nSnoop Dogg has paid tribute to 2Pac with his newly-opened weed dispensary in his hometown of Los Angeles.\n\nCalled S.W.E.D., which is an acronym for Smoke Weed Every Day — a reference to Nate Dogg‘s final line on Dr. Dre‘s “The Next Episode” — the fully licensed dispensary opened its doors with Snoop’s help over the weekend.\n\nThrough a limited edition release, Tha Doggfather is paying tribute to his late friend and collaborator by featuring 2Pac on a number of his Death Row Cannabis products.\n\nThe line features a premium blend of jarred cannabis flower and Alien OG, with customers also receiving an exclusive never-before-seen photo of the “Dear Mama” legend, as well as a matchbook recreated from the photoshoot.\n\nSnoop Dogg previously revealed that 2Pac handed him his first blunt in 1993 at the wrap party for the film Poetic Justice, which starred ‘Pac alongside Janet Jackson.\n\n“2Pac is the one who got Snoop Dogg smoking blunts,” he said, referring to himself in the third person, while inducting the late rapper into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nSnoop also recalled that moment in a statement launching the 2Pac weed products: “That first blunt sparked a friendship that ran deep. We’ll always have his music, but this is another way I can bring what was meaningful to 2Pac to his fans.”\n\nSnoop’s S.W.E.D. shop also offers fans the chance to see a Death Row electric chair, graffiti on the walls and various bits of music memorabilia including a section dedicated to his seminal album Doggystyle.\n\nThe 52-year-old’s business empire has been rapidly expanding of late as he recently celebrated his wife opening a strip club in Los Angeles.\n\nThe grand opening featured special appearances from Wiz Khalifa, DJ Quik, Too $hort, DJ Drama, Tiffany Haddish and more.\n\nIn 2021, Snoop brought his wife Shante Broadus on board as his official manager.\n\nAccording to a press release at the time, she was tapped to bring her vast, multi-dimensional expertise to her husband’s existing ventures in an effort to expand them.\n\nAdditionally, she’d cultivate and fortify all upcoming partnership deals while overseeing the media arm of his empire, diGGital doGG."
