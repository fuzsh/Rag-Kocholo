        "text": "Bio:\n\nKanye West (born Kanye Omari West in Atlanta, Georgia on June 8, 1977) is a rapper, movie director, and fashion designer. In 1998, he began producing tracks for several rappers such as Gravs, Foxy Brown, Jermaine Dupri and later Jay-Z. Kanye began his own career as a rapper in 2004, releasing his debut album, The College Dropout. His following albums include Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), 808s & Heartbreak (2008), My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010, Yeezus (2013), and The Life of Pablo (2016). He developed his own record label, GOOD Music, which features artists such as John Legend and Kid Cudi. He developed his own fashion line, DW Kanye West, as well as a shoe line for Louis Vuitton, in 2009, and has been collaborating with Adidas for Yeezy shoes and clothing lines since 2013. MTV voted Kanye “MTV Man of the Year” in 2010, and Time ranked him as one of the most influential people in the world. In 2015, Kanye received an honorary doctorate from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Throughout his career, Kanye has found himself at the center of controversy, most notably, when he interrupted Taylor Swift’s Video Music Awards acceptance speech in 2009.\n\nBest Known For:\n\nHis catchy lyrics, synthpop songs, and disruptions at music award events.\n\nPersonal Life:\n\nKanye was engaged to designer Alexis Phifer for 18 months. He then dated Amber Rose from 2008-2010, and finally linked up with Kim Kardashian in April 2012, after her split from Kris Humphries. On New Years’ Eve 2012, Kanye announced that Kim was pregnant with their first child. North West was born on June 15, 2013, and Kanye proposed Oct. 2013. They got married in Italy in May 2014. The couple had their second child, Saint West, on December 5, 2015, and their third child, Chicago West, via surrogate on January 15, 2018.\n\nCharitable Causes:\n\nKanye founded the Kanye West foundation, later renamed The Dr. Donda West Foundation after his late mother, in 2003 to decrease dropout and illiteracy rates. He has also done work for Hurricane Katrina relief, the Millions More Movement and 100 Black Men of America.\n\nYES!!! Kanye West’s new album cover is out for ‘The Life Of Pablo’ and he’s making it VERY clear as to what the album’s title is. The art features the title written over and over again in black print against and orange backdrop, with a small photo of a wedding included.\n\nLeave it to Kanye West to make sure his new album’s cover is literally a work of art, as he turned to Belgian artist Peter De Potter to create the visuals for his precious baby. Either Peter is a pretty fast worker or Kanye had the alternate title in mind for The Life Of Pablo as Ye only just released the new name on Feb. 10, a day ahead of its release and his big fashion show during NYFW. Read on for the details about his brand new cover and what it may mean!"
