        "text": "KIM Kardashian and Kanye West's youngest daughter turned five years old in January 2023.\n\nKim honored Chicago West's birthday in a sweet Instagram tribute.\n\nKIM Kardashian and Kanye West's youngest daughter turned five years old in January 2023.\n\nKim honored Chicago West's birthday in a sweet Instagram tribute.\n\nWhen was Chicago West born?\n\nKim and Kanye welcomed the baby girl on January 15, 2018, in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe reality star, 42, announced the news in a sweet post on her website which simply read: \"She's here! We're so in love.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl.\"\n\nKim confirmed she was pregnant on Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nShe shared the first picture with her daughter five weeks after she was born on February 20, 2018.\n\nIt was the first time fans saw Chicago since she made a quick appearance as a tiny newborn in Kylie Jenner’s pregnancy reveal video.\n\nOn January 15, 2023, Kim shared a birthday tribute for Chicago on her Instagram page that included four photos of the mom-and-daughter-duo.\n\nShe captioned the post: \"My twin. Happy 5th Birthday. I really can’t believe you’re 5! I’m so so proud to be your mom, it’s the best feeling in the entire world.\"\n\nThe businesswoman continued: \"You are the cuddliest sweetest silliest most independent caring girl in the whole world and I just love you so much!\"\n\nWhy did Kim and Kanye choose the name Chicago?\n\nThree days after the birth, Kim took to her app to reveal that the former couple had decided to call their newborn daughter Chicago.\n\nThe SKIMS co-founder shared a picture of the name, captioned with the date and time of her birth.\n\nShe also included her weight, which was seven pounds, six ounces.\n\nKim retweeted a post that explains how to pronounce the shortened version of Chicago's name.\n\nIt read: \"And to everyone who thinks it’s literally pronounced as CHI. No. It’s 'Shy'.\"\n\nKanye grew up in Chicago, Illinois, and has referenced the US city heavily in tracks such as \"Homecoming\" from 2007.\n\nThe name is a tribute to the rapper's mother Donda, who raised him there when she split from his father.\n\nKim later revealed she disagreed with Kanye's family when the time came to choosing Chicago's name, with his cousin having proposed the name Miracle West.\n\nWho was Kim and Kanye's surrogate?\n\nWhile her identity was initially kept private, the surrogate was revealed to be a woman named La'Reina Haynes in the season 14 finale of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\nWhile her face was not shown, La'Reina spoke to the Kardashian family about her experience.\n\nShe said, in part: \"I know what my job is in all of it. It makes me feel important because I'm like, 'Wow, I did something so good.' This is beautiful. I would do this again a thousand more times.\"\n\nThe revelation of Kim and Kanye's decision to use a surrogate came after Kim revealed she could \"bleed to death\" if she carried another child.\n\nIn September 2017, TMZ revealed that the surrogate was a \"married African-American college graduate with two children of her own\".\n\nShe was also said to be a Democrat in \"great physical shape\".\n\nReports claimed she was being \"pampered\" by the couple as she carried their bundle of joy.\n\nKim revealed she felt compelled to tell the surrogate that she was carrying her and Kanye's child.\n\nShe said: \"I just felt like I wanted, whoever's carrying my baby, like what if they weren't a fan of me or my husband? And what if they didn't want to be carrying our baby?\"\n\nShe continued: \"I wanted to give them that choice and be proud and on the same page and I wanted a relationship with her.\"\n\nThe socialite added: \"She was really excited! She was someone that had watched the show, not like a super fan or anything that it would have been uncomfortable, but she had seen my struggle and seen how open I was about it.\"\n\nKim raised eyebrows when she admitted that she didn't invite her surrogate to her glamorous baby shower.\n\nShe said: \"I, um, I did not [invite her]. I did introduce her to my family. I introduced her to my family earlier that day.\n\n“And, you know, I just thought, I don’t know, it was like a weird decision to have to make.\n\n“Of course, I would’ve wanted her to be there and be a part of it.\n\n“But I hadn’t really gone that far in explaining it to my kids yet.\"\n\nVogue discussed the funds La'Reina would be receiving for being a surrogate.\n\nThe publication said: \"It’s reported that Haynes will be paid USD$45,000 in 10 monthly installments of USD$4,500, as well as a $68,850 deposit, for her help.\""
