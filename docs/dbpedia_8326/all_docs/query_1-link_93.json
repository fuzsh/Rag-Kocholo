        "text": "‘Modern Family’ actress Sofia Vergara may have just played the most challenging role of her career when she stepped into the shoes of the Colombian drug lord Griselda Blanco. This is for the mini-series on Netflix titled Griselda, which was announced back in 2021 and began streaming on the streaming giant from January 25.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actress was the one to have made the first move, by pitching the idea to “Narcos” showrunner Eric Newman all the way back in 2015. The collaborator of the iconic show AndrÃ©s Baiz said in a statement, “She knew so much about this woman. And she felt strongly that there was a part of her story that hadn’t been explored onscreen before.”\n\nSofia Vergara and her prep for the role\n\nIt’s said she wanted to detach herself from the character she played in Modern Family.Â And the prep may have taken a lot more than just the physical aspects like prosthetic and make-up.\n\nThe creator of the series said about Sofia, “We had a couple tests, some that had been a little too extreme, some that perhaps had not been enough, but we found our way to a really great place.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Any difference that would give SofÃ­a confidence was what became important â in the eyebrows, the nose, hair, she wanted to feel like a different person, but not to the point in which the prosthetics or makeup took over her performance,” Baiz, the show’s director, said.\n\nSofia said, “Getting the look correct was very important to me because I needed to disappear. I wanted no one to think of me or my last role as Gloria Pritchett. I wanted to get inside Griselda’s head and really understand her mentality, where she was coming from.”"
