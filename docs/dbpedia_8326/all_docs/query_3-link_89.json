The star in the category of Television was dedicated at 7013 Hollywood Boulevard in front of Marshalls Department store. “The Hollywood Chamber is proud to add some spice to the Hollywood Walk of Fame by immortalizing Sofia Vergara’s fame onto our iconic Walk of Fame. Vergara adds coveted diversity to our Walk of Fame institution. We also think putting her star next to the star of TV husband Ed O’Neill is an added value for fans of their show to enjoy,” stated Ana Martinez, Producer of the Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremonies.\n\nHelping emcee and Hollywood Chamber President/CEO Leron Gubler to unveil the star were actor Eric Stonestreet and “Modern Family” Co-creator/Executive Producer Steve Levitan.\n\nDiscovered on the beaches of Barranquilla, Colombia, Vergara began her career in a Pepsi-Cola commercial and history was made. World renowned as one of the funniest and sexiest stars today, Sofia Vergara is an Emmy, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) nominated actress. She can currently be seen as ‘Gloria Delgado-Pritchett’ in the five-time Emmy winner for Outstanding Comedy Series “Modern Family,” which airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on ABC.\n\nVergara will soon be seen opposite Reese Witherspoon in New Line Cinema’s and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures’ buddy comedy “Hot Pursuit,” distributed by Warner Bros Pictures. The film is slated for release on May 8th, the day after Vergara’s star induction ceremony. Vergara is also an executive producer on the film.\n\nVergara’s recent film appearances include starring opposite Woody Allen and Sharon Stone in John Turturro’s “Fading Gigolo” as well as co-starring in Open Road Films’ “Chef” with Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jr. and Simon West’s “Wild Card” with Jason Statham. Both “Fading Gigolo” and “Chef” posted one of the year’s best specialty box-office openings.\n\nVergara got her break in Disney’s comedy “Big Trouble” and since then has starred in films such as “Smurfs,” “Happy Feet 2,” “New Year’s Eve,” “Four Brothers” and Tyler Perry’s box office sensations “Meet The Browns” and “Madea Goes To Jail.”\n\nOn stage in 2009, Vergara earned rave reviews when she debuted in the Broadway production of “Chicago” as ‘Mama Morton.’\n\nIn the Hispanic market, some of her past TV credits include “Fuera de Serie” as well as her special guest appearance on 2008’s highest rated Spanish language soap opera, “Fuego en la Sangre” on Univision. Additionally, she executive produced the Spanish version of “Desperate Housewives.” The entertainment trade papers have also named her one of the most talented and powerful women in Hispanic entertainment.\n\nAlong with the recognition she has earned for her acting career, Vergara is also considered a successful entrepreneur with an especially strong celebrity brand. Being able to successfully cross over from her original audience of Hispanic consumers and spread her influence across all demographics, is something Vergara does on a daily basis with her retail lines, which range from furniture to hair care and fragrance and more appeal to virtually every demographic. She has a collection for Kay Jewelers called ‘So Sofia’ and her fragrance, Sofia by Sofia Vergara, launched last May and her second fragrance will be launched globally later this summer.\n\nIn 1994, Vergara founded Latin World Entertainment with business partner Luis Balaguer. Latin World Entertainment has grown from a management agency for top Hispanic talent to a multi-service company offering a 360° approach, and currently is the premier Hispanic talent management and entertainment marketing firm in the United States. The company represents the biggest stars, opinion-makers and trendsetters in the Spanish-speaking entertainment world, and leverages that star power to take brands and products directly into the growing Hispanic market.\n\nIn addition to her success as an actress and entrepreneur, Vergara is also committed to being active through various philanthropic endeavors. Vergara works closely with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. In 2001, Vergara created “Peace and Hope for the Children of Colombia,” a foundation that has helped thousands of children in Colombia. She has also donated a pediatric cancer pavilion in her hometown, and currently dedicates her time giving back to this charity in Colombia.\n\n★★★\n\nABOUT THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME www.WalkOfFame.com\n\nThe Hollywood Walk of Fame is an internationally-recognized Hollywood icon.
