        "text": "It came to blows.\n\n“America’s Got Talent” judge Heidi Klum was miffed with her co-judge Sofía Vergara after she failed to cast Klum in her Netflix miniseries “Griselda.”\n\n“I was upset because I was like, ‘Why couldn’t I have been one of your cousins?’ I could have been a cousin that doesn’t speak, because obviously I don’t speak Spanish,” Klum, 50, told “Entertainment Tonight” on Tuesday.\n\nThe women came together to promote Season 19 of “AGT” on the red carpet.\n\n“But I could have just been, you know, not speaking! I was upset,” she laughed. “I could have also been one of those gorgeous girls! I would have loved to. But she said, ‘Nein.'”\n\nThe Netflix crime drama, which premiered in January, details the rise of real-life Miami drug lord Griselda Blanco (Vergara) — also known as the “Godmother of Cocaine” — and her inevitable fall from power and eventual assassination in 2012 at the age of 69.\n\nDespite the general praise for Vergara’s performance as the late Colombian drug lord, Blanco’s son, Michael Corleone Blanco, slammed the “Modern Family” alum, 51, saying that her portrayal was nothing short of “disrespectful.”\n\n“Sofía Vergara did not consult with any members of the Blanco family as a sign of respect or elicit family details in portraying my mother,” Blanco, 45, raged to Fox News earlier this year. “When I learned of the ‘Griselda’ project, my team reached out to Sofía’s camp and offered my consultation services.”\n\nAccording to Michael, Vergara’s team spurned his offer by telling him there was “no room on the project” to consult with him or any members of Blanco’s lineage.\n\n“Sofia’s camp and the Netflix creators were disrespectful and ultimately produced the ‘Griselda’ project on their own for commercial gain, without key details from the Blanco family,” Michael continued, adding that he and his lawyers sent Netflix and the Golden Globe nominee a cease-and-desist letter.\n\nHe later claimed that neither Netflix nor Vergara’s team had “made any attempt to reconcile.”\n\n“Regardless of public information, basic respect is warranted,” Michael continued. “I am Griselda’s only living son that has life rights agreements signed by Griselda herself in which she intended I carry out her life story. I am a businessman in the entertainment industry and comprehend the importance of motion pictures as I have a book to be released, based on the real story.”\n\nDuring her press tour for the show, Vergara revealed that it took her nearly three hours to fully transform into the crime boss.\n\n“The hardest thing was that I had to wear a wig, fake teeth, fake nose and have a plastic forehead. I also had to wear uncomfortable bras that pushed me down to make me look less Latin,” the actress said on “The Graham Norton Show.”\n\n“It was a complicated character for me, but it was my first film in Spanish, which was so liberating.”\n\nAccording to the “Chef” star, the idea of portraying Griselda happened nearly 15 years ago.\n\n“It is a true story of a woman that no one ever suspected of being one of the biggest drug dealers that ever existed,” she told Norton. “She created an insane cartel, and I went crazy for the story. She was Colombian, an immigrant, and a very tough ruthless woman. She was a monster. It was the role for me!”\n\nThe series was first announced in November 2021."
