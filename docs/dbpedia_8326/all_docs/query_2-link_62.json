For this list, we'll be looking at improvs and off-the-cuff moments that weren't on the page but made it into the final cut. Our countdown includes egg drop fall, \"why the face,\" Lily locked in the car, and more!\n\nUnscripted Modern Family Moments That Were Kept in the Show\n\nWelcome to MsMojo, and today we’re counting down our picks for the Unscripted “Modern Family” Moments That Were Kept in the Show.\n\nFor this list, we’ll be looking at improvs and off-the-cuff moments that weren’t on the page but made it into the final cut.\n\nFeel free to go off script and tell us your favorite “Modern Family” improvisations. Leave us a comment below.\n\n#5: Phil’s Trampoline Basketball Domination\n\n“Pilot”\n\nA great scene from the pilot episode of “Modern Family” is the trampoline basketball game that happens during the end credits. As it turns out, not only was the action unscripted, but so was the game itself. It only happened because the production noticed a basketball court next to a trampoline at the house where they were filming. So, they turned the net around towards the trampoline and, according to co-creator Christopher Lloyd, told actor Ty Burrell to play with Nolan Gould and “don’t let him win no matter what.” Which he did. And for that, we say, “well done.”\n\n#4: Egg Drop Fall\n\n“Egg Drop”\n\nIn Season 3’s “Egg Drop,” Luke’s eggs aren’t the only thing that comes crashing down to the ground. Claire also hits the deck after slipping on the cracked eggs on the floor. And, according to both actor Julie Bowen and co-creator Christopher Lloyd, the fall was unscripted. Claire was supposed to slip on the eggs, but landing on the floor, that was, to quote Bowen, “raw, unadulterated klutziness.” Although Bowen did predict it happening prior to filming the scene. In an interview with TV Guide, Bowen said that she told the producers, “Guys, there’s no way I’m not going to fall. I’m a klutz, I’m wearing heels, there are slippery eggs.” She was right, it was funny, and hey kept it in!\n\n#3: “Why the Face”\n\n“Pilot”\n\nIn the show’s pilot episode, Phil lays out all the reasons he’s such a cool dad. These include his ability to recreate the dances from “High School Musical” and his knowledge of text speech, such as LOL, OMG and WTF. Although, his understanding of what WTF stands for isn’t quite accurate. It’s funny though, and it was initially unscripted. However, Ty Burrell wasn’t the one who came up with it. It was actually “Resident Alien” actor Alan Tudyk, who came up with “Why the face” during his audition for the role of Phil Dunphy. He obviously didn’t get the part, but the show’s creators loved the line and asked his permission to use it while filming the episode.\n\n#2: Lily Locked in the Car\n\n“Run for Your Wife”\n\nRemember that hysterical scene where Cam and Mitchell lock Lily in the car? Well, if the scene had gone as written on the page, it would definitely not have been as memorable. While the script did have the couple locking their baby in the car, everything that happened after was pure, unscripted gold. According to actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson, the scene, as scripted, ended after Mitchell says “Did we just lock our baby in the car?” Which means, Mitchell singing and Cam trying to break the window was all Ferguson and Eric Stonestreet doing the improv thing.\n\n#1: The Broken Step\n\n“The Bicycle Thief”\n\nIt’s one of everyone’s favorite “Modern Family” running gags - the broken step that Phil is constantly tripping on, and is usually followed with the refrain, “gotta fix that step.” The simple gag led to numerous jokes over the show’s eleven seasons, but they’re jokes that almost never were, had it not been for the great Ty Burrell. Because, while all but one of the “broken step” moments were scripted, that “one” was the first one. In the first season, Burrell improvised tripping on the step in a scene and the off-the-cuff moment was such a hit with everyone on set that they didn’t just leave it in - they kept bringing it back."
