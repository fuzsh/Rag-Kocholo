        "text": "Sofia Vergara ABC.jpg\n\nSofia Vergara of \"Modern Family.\"\n\n(ABC photo)\n\nColumbian-born actress Sofia Vergara shot back at critics who say her character on the ABC comedy \"Modern Family\" perpetuates a stereotype.\n\nVergara has won a Screen Actors Guild Award and been nominated for five Golden Globes for her portrayal of Gloria Pritchett, a curvy, hot-tempered Latina with a thick accent.\n\nShe told HOLA! USA this week that it \"upsets me when Latinos complain about Gloria.\"\n\n\"What's wrong with being a stereotype?\" the 44-year-old actress asked the magazine. \"Gloria's character is inspired by my mom and my aunt. They are both Latin women who grew up in Colombia, like me. I'm like that too: A voluptuous, intense, happy woman, who wants to get involved in everything with her partner to help.\"\n\nShe added, \"I am grateful for the opportunity because the gringos have let me in with this strong accent I have. Eight years ago nobody had an accent like this on television.\"\n\nForbes estimated Vergara earned $43 million in 2016. In recent years, she has scored numerous commercial endorsements in addition to her acting work.\n\nIt's not the first time Vergara has defended her portrayal of Gloria Pritchett and her image.\n\nAfter she took part in a 2014 Emmy Award sketch, TIME and some other critics called it sexist, writing \" It does a disservice to Vergara's skills as an actress and comedian to pretend -- even in a self-conscious way -- like she's just a body.\"\n\nVergara defended her image and character to TIME: \"I play her the way I see my mom and aunt behave as Latin women.\"\n\nLast week, Vergara was honored as Favorite Comedic TV Actress at the 43rd annual People's Choice Awards."
