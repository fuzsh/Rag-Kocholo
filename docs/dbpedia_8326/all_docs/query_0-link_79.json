        "text": "Sofia Verga as Gloria\n\nModern Family, can be best described as one of the most celebrated sitcoms in Emmy Award History. And why wouldn’t it be? Its fun to watch and it’s like nothing we have seen before. However, even though this hit series brings something new to the table, it also has something that we have seen countless times in mainstream media. Stereotypes. One of the most prominent being their token character, Gloria. Being a Latin American woman myself, I find the over stereotyped characteristics of Gloria, just downright offensive. In this blog, I would like to provide a critical textual analysis of the stereotypical accent that Vergara gives to her character and highlight how this overt and offensive stereotype can have negative repercussions to the Latin American community as a whole.\n\nThe media has often relied on stereotypes to help drive the narrative. In his book, Charles Ramirez Berg states that “stereotypes are maintained because of their valued narrative economy, which is related to their financial economy as well” (Berg 42). Minorities are often portrayed in stereotypical ways throughout the media. This is mostly due to the fact that it is at an economical advantage and helps tell the story in an easier way. However, even though stereotypes can be essential to the narrative, it also reduces “the othered” group to a more one-side group instead of focusing on the complexities that each Latino possesses.\n\nGIF of Gloria\n\nSofia Vergara, a Colombian born native has become a household name in the Hollywood sphere as the loud and boisterous Gloria in the hit series, Modern Family. Even though she has received countless amount of praise for her role, she has also received numerous amounts of backlash. In a HuffPost article, it points out how the character hits almost every cliché in the book when it comes to being a Latina such as the “nosey Latino family, the controlling and overly sexy Latina.” Her character in the show is reduced to just a few traits. One of the most prominent being her thick accent. Her loud demeanor and broken English has become the punchline of almost every joke. The constant miscommunication between Gloria and the rest of the characters is only reinforced with every episode.\n\nFor example, in the clip featured below we see Gloria trying to pronounce some fairly easy words in English. Her accent is again exaggerated and she is made to look foolish in front her son and the therapist. Her character is reduced to that of a child and she again becomes the butt of the joke.\n\nIt becomes very apparent how much of an asset her thick accent and loud demeanor is to the show. Very clearly we see how the series uses Gloria’s accent for comedic value. This however reduces Gloria into a superficial one-side character and reinforces the long lived stereotype that the majority of Hispanics are loud and have thick accents. Vergara’s portrayal of Gloria then in turn becomes degrading to the Latin American Community.\n\nWhat viewers are not realizing is that Vergara’s character is only reinforcing the negative stereotypes that have been portrayed in the media since the beginning, the most popular being the infamous thick accent. The constant use of the accent for comedy belittles the Latin community and creates a more homogenous culture where little to no diversity exists. In the book titled “Hispanic Characters in TV Entertainment” the authors state how “Television has rarely pointed out the cultural, historical, or economic differences…Latin community” (Litcher & Amundson, 70). Instead, they reduce us Latinos to just a few negative traits and group us all together as one. The negative impact of television portrayals of Latinos is problematic. Americans who lack real life experiences with Latino’s rely on messages delivered to them by mainstream media. This in turn causes them to perceive Latino’s in a negative light. People begin to believe that it is okay to mock a Latino’s accent because that is what is fed to them by mainstream media, when in reality, it is not!\n\nModern Family cast image\n\nInstead, we should debunk these negative Latin stereotypes like the infamous Latino accent and create multifaceted characters that showcase the positive attributes that Latin Americans possess.\n\n– Alexa Dilone\n\nReadings:\n\nBerg, Charles Ramirez. “Stereotypes in Film.” Latinos in Film: Stereotypes, Subversion, and Resistance.
