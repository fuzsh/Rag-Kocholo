Poised to make a mark over the holiday weekend as it launches right before July 4, the film marks the latest installment in the franchise. Not counting Minions: The Rise of Gru (2022), the last Despicable Me film arrived in 2017, and the third feature introduced Gru’s twin brother Dru (also voiced by Steve Carell).\n\nThe fourth film introduces new voices and characters as well — including Will Ferrell’s villain Maxime Le Mal, Sofía Vergara’s Valentina and Joey King’s Poppy Prescott. Several voice actors reprise their previous roles from other films.\n\nMatch the animated characters to their real-life voices below.\n\nRELATED: ‘Despicable Me 4’ Director Chris Renaud Talks Minions Fandom, Why Gru’s Kids Won’t Age & Thoughts On A Mega Minions Spinoff\n\nSubscribe to Deadline\n\nGet our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.\n\nSign Up\n\nSidebar"
