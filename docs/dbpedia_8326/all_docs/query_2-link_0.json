        "text": "List of characters appearing in the TV series Modern Family\n\nModern Family is an American TV comedy series revolving around three families interrelated through Jay Pritchett, his son Mitchell Pritchett, and his daughter Claire Dunphy. The families meet for family functions (usually around their three neighborhoods or while traveling during vacations) and cross-family bonding.\n\nModern Family cast and characters Actor Character Season 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Ed O'Neill Jay Pritchett Main Sofía Vergara Gloria Delgado-Pritchett Main Julie Bowen Claire Dunphy Main Ty Burrell Phil Dunphy Main Jesse Tyler Ferguson Mitchell Pritchett Main Eric Stonestreet Cameron Tucker Main Sarah Hyland Haley Dunphy Main Ariel Winter Alex Dunphy Main Nolan Gould Luke Dunphy Main Rico Rodriguez Manny Delgado Main Aubrey Anderson-Emmons Lily Tucker-Pritchett Recurring[a] Main Jeremy Maguire Joe Pritchett Recurring[b] Main Reid Ewing[1] Dylan Marshall Recurring Guest Recurring Guest Recurring Main\n\nFictional character\n\nPhil DunphyFirst appearance\"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009Last appearance\"Finale\"\n\n11x17 & 11x18, April 8, 2020Portrayed byTy BurrellIn-universe informationFull namePhilip Humphrey DunphyAliases\n\nClive Bixby\n\nJebediah Dunphy\n\nGenderMaleOccupationRealtor and magic store ownerFamilyFrank Dunphy (father; deceased)\n\nGrace Dunphy (mother; deceased)\n\nLorraine Dunphy (stepmother)\n\nRay (stepbrother)Spouse\n\nClaire Dunphy\n\n​\n\n(m. 1993) ​\n\nSignificant others\n\nCarla Concannon (Ex-Girlfriend)\n\nDenise (Ex-Girlfriend)\n\nChildrenHaley Dunphy (daughter)\n\nAlex Dunphy (daughter)\n\nLuke Dunphy (son)RelativesGeorge Marshall (grandson)\n\nPoppy Marshall (granddaughter)\n\nDylan Marshall (son-in-law)\n\nJay Pritchett (father-in-law)\n\nDeDe Williams (mother-in-law; deceased)\n\nGloria Delgado-Pritchett (stepmother-in-law)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (brother-in-law)\n\nJoe Pritchett (half brother-in-law)\n\nManny Delgado (stepbrother-in-law)\n\nCameron Tucker (brother-in-law)\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive niece by marriage)\n\nRexford Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive nephew by marriage)\n\nPhilip Humphrey \"Phil\" Dunphy (Ty Burrell) is Claire's husband of 15 years who sees himself as the \"cool dad\". He dotes on his wife Claire and constantly tries to find ways to bond with his three kids. He is seen as very competitive, one example being his always beating his son at basketball. He has a very juvenile attitude and is referred to by Claire as the \"kid [she's] married to.\" He uses a parenting method that he calls \"peerenting\", which is a combination of talking like a peer but acting like a parent.[2]\n\nPhil is a realtor who is very confident in his work, once saying, \"I could sell a fur coat to an Eskimo.\" Phil has a severe case of coulrophobia, which is first revealed when despite Mitchell's objection, Cameron comes to Luke's party dressed as a clown. This may stem from Phil's having found a dead clown in the woods when he was a child. Phil once dresses up as a clown for a kids' party but has a panic attack when he catches his reflection in multiple mirrors. Phil appears to love home repair yet never seems to get around to any of the jobs requested by Claire. Throughout season 1, his ongoing project is fixing the step. He at times shows a sort of crush-like affection for Gloria. However, he says he \"would never stray from Claire,\" although Gloria did kiss him during a \"kiss cam\" segment at a basketball game in the final episode of season 1, \"Family Portrait\", however he was immediately regretful for not preventing it as he didn't want to do it.[2] In college, he was a cheerleader at Fresno State and his birthday is on April 3.[3]\n\nPhil seems oblivious as to what he says by miscalculating (if at all) the consequences of his expressions, such as \"Phil Dunphy is no straight guy\" (when he is referring to not being a straight man)[4] or \"If you ain't white, you ain't right\" (referring to the t-shirt color of a team that he was playing on).[5] He often seeks approval from Jay, who generally does not openly show approval of anyone. In the Season 3 episode \"Dude Ranch,\" Phil shows considerable skill both on horseback and with a shotgun, notably shooting two clay pigeons on one foot.\n\nIn moments of acute adversity or shock in which most people would curse or swear, Phil utters humorous exclamations: references to food such as, \"Sweet Potato Fries!\" or \"Chicken in a basket!\", etc. or he might make a historical reference such as \"John Philip Sousa!\" It is revealed in \"Tableau Vivant\" that Phil had once tried to break up with Claire but didn't dare to do so.\n\nA running gag in the show has Phil running up the stairs (often when carrying an object) and tripping on a loose step, causing him to say some variation of \"Gotta fix that step!\"\n\nTy Burrell had received many positive reviews for his performance. Hank Stuever from The Washington Post wrote, \"A standout performance from Ty Burrell's new twist on the doofus-dad stereotype.\"[6] Paige Wiser, a reporter for the Chicago Sun Times, wrote, \"Ty Burrell is a genius as a dad who stays hip by keeping up with the numbers from High School Musical.\"[7] Robert Canning of IGN in a review of the season loved Ty Burrell's performance of Phil Dunphy and named him one of two characters that stood out to him saying \"actor Ty Burrell owned this part, and his well-intended faux pas throughout the season were stellar.\"[8]\n\nIn 2010, Ty Burrell received a nomination for the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy, winning in 2011. In 2011 and 2014, Burrell won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, also receiving nominations in 2010, 2012, and 2013. In 2012, Burrell won the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. In 2014, Burrell won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series, receiving nominations in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016. In 2010 and 2011, Burrell was nominated for the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film.\n\nOn May 4, 2016, Phil appeared in the first commercials for the National Association of Realtors telling about his \"Phil's-osophies.\" Arnold Worldwide executive creative director Sean McBride said Phil was written as a Realtor on his show and \"embodies many of the attributes that are important in a Realtor: He's honest, he's helpful, he's sincere.\"[9]\n\nFictional character\n\nClaire DunphyFirst appearance\"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009Last appearance\"Finale\"\n\n11x17 & 11x18, April 8, 2020Portrayed byJulie BowenIn-universe informationFull nameClaire Pritchett DunphyAliasJulianaGenderFemaleOccupationSenior VP of Organize 'Em\n\nPresident of Pritchett Closets and Blinds (formerly)\n\nHousewife (formerly)FamilyJay Pritchett (father)\n\nDeDe Williams (mother; deceased)\n\nGloria Delgado-Pritchett (stepmother)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (brother)\n\nJoe Pritchett (half brother)\n\nManny Delgado (stepbrother)Spouse\n\nPhil Dunphy\n\n​\n\n(m. 1993) ​\n\nSignificant others\n\nRobbie Sullivan (Ex-Boyfriend)\n\nRicky (Ex-Boyfriend)\n\nChildrenHaley Dunphy (daughter)\n\nAlex Dunphy (daughter)\n\nLuke Dunphy (son)RelativesGeorge Marshall (grandson)\n\nPoppy Marshall (granddaughter)\n\nDylan Marshall (son-in-law)\n\nLucas Pritchett (grandfather; deceased)\n\nDonnie Pritchett (uncle)\n\nIrene Pritchett (aunt)\n\nBecky Pritchett (aunt)\n\nMelissa Pritchett (grand-cousin)\n\nBeBe Williams (aunt)\n\nCeCe Williams (aunt)\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive niece)\n\nRexford Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive nephew)\n\nCameron Tucker (brother-in-law)\n\nFrank Dunphy (father-in-law, deceased)\n\nGrace Dunphy (mother-in-law; deceased)\n\nLorraine Dunphy (step-mother-in-law)\n\nRay (step-brother-in-law)\n\nClaire Dunphy (Julie Bowen), née Pritchett, is the wife of Phil Dunphy, the daughter of Jay, Mitchell's older sister, Gloria's stepdaughter, Manny's stepsister, Joe's half sister, and the helicopter soccer mom of the Dunphy family and its three very different kids.[10] She was once a wild child who made a great deal of mistakes over the years, and she is fearful that her children could make the same mistakes, especially her oldest daughter, Haley. She is often exhausted from the stress created by her family but is still a loving mother.[10] When it comes to her kids, she has difficulty controlling Haley's independence and irresponsibility, Alex's sarcasm and perfectionism, and Luke's lack of common sense.[10] She also gets annoyed with her husband, Phil, constantly.\n\nClaire is very competitive, especially in her obsession with being right, and has a brittle personality that causes her to get angry, paranoid, and freak out easily. She is very strict about a clean house. She is seen as an experienced parent by Cameron and Mitchell, so she is called upon for her parenting advice. She enjoys running and reading. She could also come across as uptight or arrogant at times, especially during her scenes with Gloria. She is also very attached to Halloween and describes it as her \"crazy lady holiday.\" In the episode \"Open House of Horrors,\" it is revealed that the neighbors are frightened of Claire's very graphic and realistic decorations around the house. Claire is also the most active family member when organizing family get-togethers. When a former co-worker (Minnie Driver) visits, it is revealed that Claire had a successful job in hospitality management but left her job and married Phil a few months after she became pregnant with Haley. She shows resentment towards the abandonment of her working career due to seeing one of her former peers' success but later realizes her family is more important.[11]\n\nClaire is a perfectionist; according to Phil, \"when everybody else sees something beautiful, all she sees is the teeny-tiny flaw.\" She is also terrible at giving gifts. As her husband Phil once bought her a bracelet for their anniversary, she made him coupons for five free hugs, which she was very proud of.\n\nHer step-brother is Manny Delgado. Claire received another sibling through Jay's second wife, Gloria: Fulgencio \"Joe\". She often despises the attention that Gloria gets for her voluptuous figure and is thrilled to learn that Gloria was pregnant because of all the weight that Gloria would be gaining. However, she generally has a good relationship with Gloria, with them sometimes doing yoga or spa days together.\n\nJulie Bowen's performance was praised by Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly who said, \"Bowen's Claire could have been a blank blonde cipher. Far from it: Bowen's wide array of silent gazes at the camera, her slow-burns at her clan's bad behavior, and her ability to freak out without seeming nutso crazy makes her an essential, stand-out part of TV's best freshman ensemble cast.\"[12]\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, Julie Bowen won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, receiving nominations in 2010 and 2013. In 2012, Bowen won the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She has also been nominated twice for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series in 2012 and 2014. In 2009, Bowen was nominated for the Satellite Award for Best Actress in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy, and then for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries, or Television Film in 2010.\n\nFictional character\n\nHaley DunphyFirst appearance\"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009Last appearance\"Finale\"\n\n11x17 & 11x18, April 8, 2020Portrayed bySarah HylandIn-universe informationFull nameHaley Gwendolyn DunphyGenderFemaleOccupationStudent (formerly)\n\nAssistant fashion designer at Gavin Sinclair (formerly)\n\nStyle editor for Nerp (currently)FamilyPhil Dunphy (father)\n\nClaire Dunphy (mother)\n\nAlex Dunphy (sister)\n\nLuke Dunphy (brother)Spouse\n\nDylan Marshall\n\n​\n\n(m. ) ​\n\nSignificant others\n\nAndy Bailey (Ex-Boyfriend)\n\nRanier Shine (Ex-Boyfriend)\n\nDr. Arvin Fennerman (Ex-Boyfriend)\n\nChildrenGeorge Marshall (son)\n\nPoppy Marshall (daughter)RelativesFrank Dunphy (grandfather; deceased)\n\nGrace Dunphy (grandmother; deceased)\n\nJay Pritchett (grandfather)\n\nDeDe Williams (grandmother; deceased)\n\nGloria Delgado-Pritchett (step-grandmother)\n\nLucas Williams (great-grandfather; deceased)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (uncle)\n\nJoe Pritchett (half uncle)\n\nManny Delgado (step-uncle)\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive cousin)\n\nRexford Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive cousin)\n\nDonnie Pritchett (granduncle)\n\nBecky Pritchett (grandaunt)\n\nBeBe Williams (grandaunt)\n\nCeCe Williams (grandaunt)\n\nCameron Tucker (uncle by marriage)\n\nLorraine Dunphy (step-grandmother)\n\nRay (step-uncle)\n\nFarrah Marshall (mother-in-law)\n\nHaley Gwendolyn Dunphy (Sarah Hyland) (born December 10, 1993[13]) is the elder daughter of Claire and Phil, who is portrayed as the stereotypical teenager.[14] At the start of the series, Haley is a high school sophomore. Haley is depicted as being a flirt, who focuses more on social status than studies. She is a little naive, especially when it comes to arguing with her parents.[14]\n\nShe is concerned about her social standing at school, including her sex life, and is frequently embarrassed by her parents' conduct.[14] Haley contemplates moving in with Dylan before learning that she got into college in the final episode of the third season. After a run-in with the law on campus in Season 4, she is expelled from college and moves back into the Dunphy home. She begins a fashion blog and goes to community college to study business and photography, eventually showing and selling her photos in an exhibit. In Season 6, she gets a job working for fashion designer Gavin Sinclair as his assistant, doing some of her design work. In season 9, episode 13, she starts working at a lifestyle company called Nerp.\n\nThroughout Season 6, Haley develops feelings for Jay and Gloria's hired nanny, Andy, with whom she comes to spend much of her time and with whom she begins a relationship in \"White Christmas.\" At the end of Season 7, Andy is offered a job in his hometown in Utah and initially turns it down, but Haley encourages him to pursue it, insisting that they will figure out a way to be together. As they say goodbye at the airport, she admits that Andy is the first man she has ever really loved. As of \"Weathering Heights,\" she is dating weatherman Rainer Shine, though they break up later in the season after he proposed, and they both realized they weren't ready. In season 9's \"In Your Head,\" she starts dating Dr. Arvin Fennerman, Alex's astrophysics teacher at Caltech. However, a divorced Dylan reappears in the season 10 premiere and confesses that he is still in love with her and wants to be worthy. They sleep together, and Haley finds herself in love with both men. Later that season in \"Torn Between Two Lovers,\" she finally decides Dylan is \"the one\" and breaks up with Arvin. In the episode \"Did the Chicken Cross the Road?\", she finds out she is pregnant. In the episode \"Can't Elope,\" she marries Dylan. In the episode \"A Year of Birthdays,\" she gives birth to twins, Poppy and George. In the series finale, the new family moves into Mitch and Cam's former duplex.\n\nFictional character\n\nAlex DunphyFirst appearance\"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009Last appearance\"Finale\"\n\n11x17 & 11x18, April 8, 2020Portrayed byAriel WinterIn-universe informationFull nameAlexandra Anastasia DunphyGenderFemaleOccupationAcademic ResearcherFamilyPhil Dunphy (father)\n\nClaire Dunphy (mother)\n\nHaley Dunphy (sister)\n\nLuke Dunphy (brother)Significant otherSanjay Patel (ex-boyfriend)\n\nBen (ex-boyfriend)\n\nBill (ex-boyfriend)\n\nDr. Arvin Fennerman (boyfriend)RelativesFrank Dunphy (grandfather; deceased)\n\nGrace Dunphy (grandmother; deceased)\n\nJay Pritchett (grandfather)\n\nDeDe Williams (grandmother; deceased)\n\nGloria Delgado-Pritchett (step-grandmother)\n\nLucas Williams (great-grandfather; deceased)\n\nGeorge Marshall (nephew)\n\nPoppy Marshall (niece)\n\nDylan Marshall (brother-in-law)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (uncle)\n\nJoe Pritchett (half uncle)\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive cousin)\n\nRexford Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive cousin)\n\nDonnie Pritchett (granduncle)\n\nBecky Pritchett (grandaunt)\n\nBeBe Williams (grandaunt)\n\nCeCe Williams (grandaunt)\n\nManny Delgado (step-uncle)\n\nCameron Tucker (uncle by marriage)\n\nLorraine Dunphy (step-grandmother)\n\nRay (step-uncle)\n\nAlexandra \"Alex\" Dunphy (Ariel Winter) is the younger daughter of Claire and Phil. Characteristically nerdy but still cute, Alex is the most intelligent of the three siblings and a polar opposite of Haley. She is very bright academically and cares much more about her studies than her social life.[citation needed] Described in her official ABC bio as \"super smart but in a completely likeable way\", she is the middle child to a shallow older sister and a goofy younger brother, and enjoys \"messing with them\".[15]\n\nAs a stereotypical precocious kid, Alex displays a sense of superiority due to her intelligence, continually putting her accomplishments on display and demanding recognition for them. An overachiever, she plays the cello; she chose to play the cello because she would have a better chance at being in a university orchestra than if she played the violin as cellos are more in demand. While she has sometimes felt isolated from her peers (once sadly telling her parents \"I have no friends\"), she has a group of nerdy fans at school who idolize her. Haley sincerely tells Alex at one point that she is smart and attractive in a successful effort to get her to give a light-hearted graduation speech instead of a harsh one (it worked well enough that her classmates invited her to a post-ceremony party). At the beginning of Season 3, she was in a long-distance relationship with a boy she met in Wyoming. Later in the season, she went to her prom with a classmate who everyone believes is gay.[citation needed]\n\nIt is established in the episode \"Tableau Vivant\" that Alex is a light sleeper, as she was surprisingly energetic when staying awake nearly a whole night thinking about her upcoming art project. The episode \"Heart Broken\" reveals that Alex suffers from hemophobia. In the second episode of Season 5 onwards, she starts wearing new glasses. In Season 6, Alex seeks the best college to enroll in and thinking about getting away from her family for a while. While Alex was not accepted into Harvard, she was accepted into Caltech, where she has been attending since the start of Season 7. She had to take a leave of absence due to getting mono, but eventually graduated. She was dating Sanjay Patel until he broke up with her in \"The Closet Case.\"[citation needed]\n\nIn season 8, she has a relationship with Ben (Joe Mande), who works at Pritchett's Closets & Blinds, but later breaks up with him. In the season 9 episode \"Royal Visit,\" she starts dating Bill (Jimmy Tatro), a firefighter who rescued her when she burned a bagel in her room's microwave. Though he is handsome and muscular, Alex is a bit ashamed because he is not very intellectual, and they later break up.

At times, he can be a troublemaker, once shooting his sister with a toy gun and getting into a fight with Manny at school. Luke is playful, very innocent, and does not always understand the repercussions of his actions; he once announced at a family gathering that his mom thought her dad's new wife was a \"gold digger,\" although he had misheard it as \"coal digger.\"[16] Unlike his sister Alex, Luke never wins any awards at school except once when Claire meddles to get him the Integrity Award by moving the car of the first choice nominee in the disabled parking.\n\nLuke is also thought to be rather vacuous because of many questionable actions, such as getting his head stuck in the railing and jumping on the trampoline wearing only underwear and a box on his head.[16] Both parents agree that they \"dropped the ball\" with raising Luke; this is exemplified when Luke states that he was still wearing diapers when he was five years old.[17] Phil once tells Claire that he considers Luke to be their dumbest child (although he conceded to Claire's assertion that Haley was, in fact, dumber than Luke). A psychologist who evaluated him said his type of behavior was normal for someone with above-average intelligence; afterward, Phil and Claire accidentally left a wandering Luke behind when they left the psychologist's office, but they ended up being impressed by how calmly he made his way back home (in a limo) and decided he would do just fine in life. Subsequent events have borne this out, as he only got into one college he applied to (and did so because Phil gave up some magic secrets to his former rival-turned-Dean of Admissions) but has become a well-paid social fixture at Jay's country club and shows he can use his connections to help his family. In the series finale, he is accepted into and enrolls at the University of Oregon. He is frequently seen playing a Nintendo 3DS. Throughout the series, he is often seen playing with Manny. Often, they do not just play but develop plans, plots, and ploys. Being that Luke's birthday is November 28, it sometimes coincides with Thanksgiving.[19]\n\n\"Dylan Marshall\" redirects here.

He is often put into awkward situations by Phil, who wishes for the two to be friends.[14] He has diverse interests that are often surprising, such as his love of old Western films. He also sometimes reveals a sort-of attraction to Claire when he gives her a rose on Valentine's Day, saying that \"every mom should look as tasty as you when they're old.\" He also had a dream involving a (suggested) sexual encounter involving himself, Haley, and Claire. Claire strongly dislikes him, to the point of trying to introduce other boys to Haley just so that they break up or don't get back together. He loves the confidence Haley gets from being part of such a loving family and does not mind hanging around during family get-togethers.[14] He wrote a song for Haley, \"In the Moonlight (Do Me),\" and performed it for her extended family. The song was about sex, and most of the family were surprised by the suggestive lyrics, but it became stuck in all of their heads the next day. He finds inspiration for his music from Bob Dylan, Sum 41, Blink-182 and New Kids on the Block.\n\nDylan temporarily leaves the cast to work on a ranch after Haley rejects his marriage proposal in the first episode of season three, \"Dude Ranch.\" In the episode \"Virgin Territory\" Alex reveals that Haley had lost her virginity to Dylan before they broke up; she told Claire three months earlier, but not Phil. In the episode \"Disneyland,\" Dylan reveals he lost his job on the ranch and moved back to California, taking a job at Disneyland as a Dapper Dan. He and Haley get back together to Claire's dismay and Phil's delight. In the season finale, \"Baby on Board,\" Haley discovers she was accepted to college. She and Dylan maintain their relationship, and Dylan lives with the Dunphys for a few months. In Season 4, Dylan is invited to move in with Cam and Mitch after his job as a limo driver led him to their Valentine's Day party. He ends up getting fired, and while Cam and Mitch separately tell him he can stick around, Lily angrily tells him he isn't welcome there and shouts at him until he leaves the house. In Season 8, he marries a doctor named Elaine Kolchek and has three step-kids, much to Haley's dismay as she feels she lost her \"romantic safety net.\" By Season 9, Elaine has left him for her ex-husband. In Season 10, Dylan and Haley get back together and she becomes pregnant. They marry and deliver twins, Poppy and George. In the series finale, the new family moves into Mitch and Cam's former duplex.\n\nFictional character\n\nJay PritchettFirst appearance\"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009Last appearance\"Finale\"\n\n11x17 & 11x18, April 8, 2020Portrayed byEd O'NeillIn-universe informationFull nameJason Francis PritchettGenderMaleOccupationRetired business ownerFamilyDonnie Pritchett (brother)\n\nBecky Pritchett (sister)Spouse\n\nDeDe Williams\n\n​\n\n​\n\n(m. 1968; div. 2003) ​\n\n[note 1]\n\nGloria Delgado-Pritchett\n\n​\n\n​\n\n(m. 2009) ​\n\nChildrenClaire Dunphy (daughter)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (son)\n\nJoe Pritchett (son)\n\nManny Delgado (stepson)RelativesHaley Dunphy (granddaughter)\n\nAlex Dunphy (granddaughter)\n\nLuke Dunphy (grandson)\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive granddaughter)\n\nRexford Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive grandson)\n\nPhil Dunphy (son-in-law)\n\nCameron Tucker (son-in-law)\n\nGeorge Marshall (great-grandson)\n\nPoppy Marshall (great-granddaughter)\n\nDylan Marshall (grandson-in-law)\n\nMichael Pritchett (nephew)\n\nBrian (nephew)\n\nMelanie Pritchett (grandniece)\n\nIrene Pritchett (sister-in-law)\n\nFulgencio Ramírez (father-in-law; deceased)\n\nPilar Ramírez (mother-in-law)\n\nSonia Ramírez (sister-in-law)\n\nLucas Williams (ex-father-in-law; deceased)\n\nBeBe Williams (ex-sister-in-law)\n\nCeCe Williams (ex-sister-in-law)\n\nJay Francis Pritchett (Ed O'Neill) is the father of Claire, Mitchell, and Joe; husband of Gloria; maternal grandfather of Haley, Alex, Luke; and paternal grandfather of Lily; father-in-law of Phil and Cam; and step-father of Manny. He is the owner of a closet company and is presumably the wealthiest family member and, occasionally, the family's chieftain in many situations. Jay has a dry and sarcastic sense of humor. As with his son and daughter, Jay is generally more realistic, mild-mannered, and sensible than his partner, Gloria, who is unashamed because Jay is many years her senior. A recurring plot involves Jay's relationship with his son Mitchell, which became more complicated due to Jay's reaction to Mitchell's sexual orientation. Humor and plot points are also derived from Jay's relationship with his son-in-law Phil; Jay often mistreats and antagonizes him despite Phil's constant attempts to gain Jay's approval. Nevertheless, Jay thinks very highly of Phil, despite their differences, and said so in Season 3.\n\nJay has several masculine character attributes, including a fondness for sports and model airplanes. Jay is also shown to be compassionate occasionally, showing affection for members of the extended family, particularly to Manny, his step-son; their relationship seems to become more positive as the series progresses, eventually becoming a typical father-son relationship, and Jay eventually comes to see Manny as his third child. The third season's finale reveals that Gloria is pregnant, but Jay does not know yet. In the first episode of the fourth season, Gloria tells Jay and he tells her that it's the greatest news he has heard. The baby was male, which relieved Jay because it says in the episode \"Snip\" that he was afraid of having a girl. Jay is a dog-lover. He sometimes goes overboard in treating his dog, Stella, as his favorite member of the family, much to Gloria's chagrin, and Jay is thrilled when he realizes that Joe is not allergic to Stella, but to Gloria's face cream, in the episode \"Rash Decisions.\" Jay is farsighted (hyperopia). Jay served in the United States Navy during the Vietnam War. His birthday is April 1, as shown in the episode \"Grill, Interrupted.\"\n\nO'Neill was consecutively nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 2011, 2012, and 2013.

She is from Barranquilla, Colombia (as is Sofía Vergara herself). She is a very loving wife and mother.[21] At first, the family (specifically Claire) does not accept her because of her age difference to Jay. In the episode \"Coal Digger,\" Luke calls her a coal digger, a mishearing of when Claire called her a gold digger. The most frequent running gag involving the character is her mispronunciation of common English words and phrases. Vergara confirmed that many of these mispronunciations are improvised.[22]\n\nGloria often supports Manny when Jay tries to tell him to be less sensitive or hide his cultural background. However, she does occasionally display some odd parenting techniques. For example, when Manny was first born, she had wanted a daughter, and therefore for the first year of his life, she dressed him like one and told all her friends he was a girl. She later told Manny (after he found the pictures of himself like this) that the child in question was his \"twin sister who died at the age of one.\" In the sixth episode of Season One, she chastises Jay for forcing Manny to remove his poncho for school. When they get to the school to return the poncho and realize that Manny has a plan to play folk music to his classmates with his pan flute (which was inside the poncho), Gloria tells Jay to break the flute, saying in her interview that \"the poncho by itself is fine. The poncho, plus the flute, plus the stupid dance? My son will die a virgin.\"\n\nGloria is a terrible driver, though she is oblivious to this. She is also very comfortable with death (on one occasion killing and beheading a rat with a shovel right before she left for church and leaving the head \"as a warning to the other rats\"), on account of a couple of her relatives being butchers.[21] She is an excellent marksman, often just using one hand and never misses a shot, even saying to Manny that she could have unbuttoned his shirt if she wanted to with her gun (formerly Manny's BB gun). She has a very high tolerance for spicy food and has perhaps the strongest religious views of any family member.[citation needed] She loves her family and spends a great deal of time with Lily because she fixates on having a daughter. Mitchell and Cameron asked her and Jay to become guardians of Lily if anything were to happen to them.\n\nGloria has something of a shady past. Doubts have also been raised about her income: her only mentioned employment was as a hairdresser (and later as a taxi driver), and Claire, Jay's daughter, originally labeled Gloria as a \"gold-digger\" for marrying her wealthy father. It seems likely that Jay is her major source of income. However, in the Season 5 episode \"A Hard Jay's Night,\" the hair shop where she used to work is shown, and it is clarified that Jay is indeed her major current source of income. In the final episode of Season 3, it was revealed that she is pregnant. Her newest son, Fulgencio, a.k.a. Joe, is born in the Season 4 episode \"Party Crasher.\" In the episode \"Fifteen Percent,\" she reveals that she comes from a neighborhood of prostitutes after she said her neighborhood had a saying that \"Love is just around the corner.\" The Hispanic American character of Gloria was based on the character of Angela in the Jim Jarmusch film Night on Earth (1991), played by American actress Rosie Perez.[23] In season 6, Gloria officially became an American citizen.\n\nSofía Vergara has been nominated four times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries, or Television Film. In 2011, Vergara was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries, or Television Film and Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.

He is also mature and intuitive for his age and is often shown doing adult-like things, such as writing precocious poetry for his crushes who are mostly older than him, having conversations with Claire about her marriage and kids, and drinking coffee. He even engaged in the stock market business and briefly considered following his biological father's footsteps by becoming a professional gambler.[24]\n\nManny has inherited his mother's passion for life (although he is terrified of butterflies), though Gloria has also said, \"Manny is passionate, just like his father.\"[21] This causes Manny to be very romantic.[24] Manny is not afraid to take chances, leading him to ask out older girls, and develops a crush on his step-niece Haley, to whom he gave flowers on \"Pilot\" and even kissed in \"Three Turkeys.\"[24] He idolizes his absentee father, often speaking about him in a positive light, even after being repeatedly disappointed by his father's broken promises. He plays for a football team, fences, and is a skilled chess player. He is often seen wearing or intending to wear his \"burgundy dinner jacket.\" Manny was in the fifth grade in Season 1, the ninth grade in Season 5, and attends his first year of college Season 9. Manny and his step-nephew Luke are good friends who each admire the strengths of the other, although they spend a great deal of scheming against/fighting with each other as well.\n\nFictional character\n\nJoe PritchettFirst appearance\"Party Crasher\"\n\n4x12, January 16, 2013Last appearance\"Finale\"\n\n11x17 & 11x18, April 8, 2020Portrayed byRebecca and Sierra Mark (uncredited) (season 4)\n\nPierce Wallace (season 5–6)\n\nJeremy Maguire (season 7–11)[25]In-universe informationFull nameFulgencio Joseph Ramirez PritchettGenderMaleFamilyJay Pritchett (father)\n\nGloria Delgado-Pritchett (mother)\n\nClaire Dunphy (half-sister)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (half-brother)\n\nManny Delgado (half-brother)RelativesFulgencio Ramírez (grandfather; deceased)\n\nPilar Ramírez (grandmother)\n\nSophia Ramírez (aunt)\n\nUmberto Morales (great-grandfather; deceased)\n\nAna-Maria Rosa de la Immaculada Jimenez Morales (great-grandmother; deceased)\n\nDonnie Pritchett (uncle)\n\nBecky Pritchett (aunt)\n\nPhil Dunphy (half-brother-in-law)\n\nCameron Tucker (half-brother-in-law)\n\nHaley Dunphy (half-niece)\n\nAlex Dunphy (half-niece)\n\nLuke Dunphy (half-nephew)\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive half-niece)\n\nRexford Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive half-nephew)\n\nGeorge Marshall (half-grandnephew)\n\nPoppy Marshall (half-grandniece)\n\nDylan Marshall (half-nephew-in-law)\n\nFulgencio Joseph \"Joe\" Ramirez Pritchett (Jeremy Maguire) is Jay and Gloria's son. Gloria discovers she is pregnant with him in the final episode of season 3, his existence is revealed to the rest of the cast in the first episode of season 4, and he is born in \"Party Crasher.\" Throughout the series, Joe is shown to be a mature, street-smart child, inheriting his wit from his father. Joe's christening takes place in \"Fulgencio.\" In the Season 5 episode \"Spring-a-Ding-Fling\", he begins walking. In the episode \"Larry's Wife\", Gloria calls over the priest, believing that there is evil in Joe. When his birthday is celebrated in the Season 5 episode \"And One to Grow On,\" it is indicated that his party is the day after Manny's birthday party, indicating the proxmity of their birthdays. In the episode \"Queer Eyes, Full Hearts\", Manny's Spanish teacher teaches Joe to swim.\n\nStella (Brigitte) is the French bulldog of the Pritchett family, introduced in \"Good Cop Bad Dog\" (season 2, episode 22). She was the dog of a man named Guillermo (Lin-Manuel Miranda), an inventor, but when Jay convinced him to abandon his idea and return to school, Guillermo gave Stella to the family. Jay wanted to get rid of her but eventually came around. She is very problematic and often destroys things, mostly Gloria's belongings. However, Jay has a great affection for her (letting her sleep in his bed and feeding her from the dinner table), which infuriates Gloria because Jay seems to pay more love and attention to the dog than to her.\n\nFictional character\n\nMitchell PritchettFirst appearance\"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009Last appearance\"Finale\"\n\n11x17 & 11x18, April 8, 2020Portrayed byJesse Tyler FergusonIn-universe informationFull nameMitchell Vincent PritchettGenderMaleOccupationLawyerFamilyJay Pritchett (father)\n\nDeDe Williams (mother; deceased)\n\nClaire Dunphy (sister)\n\nJoe Pritchett (half brother)\n\nGloria Delgado-Pritchett (stepmother)\n\nManny Delgado (stepbrother)Spouse\n\nCameron Tucker\n\n​\n\n(m. 2014) ​\n\nSignificant others\n\nTracy (Ex-Girlfriend)\n\nTeddy (Ex-Boyfriend)\n\nChildrenLily Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive daughter)\n\nRexford Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive son)RelativesLucas Williams (grandfather; deceased)\n\nDonnie Pritchett (uncle)\n\nMichael Pritchett (cousin)\n\nBecky Pritchett (aunt)\n\nBeBe Williams (aunt)\n\nCeCe Williams (aunt)\n\nPhil Dunphy (brother-in-law)\n\nHaley Dunphy (niece)\n\nAlex Dunphy (niece)\n\nLuke Dunphy (nephew)\n\nDylan Marshall (nephew-in-law)\n\nGeorge Marshall (grandnephew)\n\nPoppy Marshall (grandniece)\n\nMitchell Vincent \"Mitch\" Pritchett (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) is Jay's son, Claire's younger brother, Gloria's stepson, Manny's stepbrother, Joe's half brother, Haley, Alex and Luke's uncle, one of Lily's fathers, and partner of 16 years to Cameron.[26] In the season finale of the fifth season, he and Cam get married. He is a low-key, mild-mannered person but has many sensitive qualities. Most times, he is the exact opposite of Cameron, which usually causes disagreements. Cameron acts as a counterbalance to Mitchell's uptight, worrying ways. Because of his mild-mannered, uptight nature, he is sometimes embarrassed by Cameron's flamboyance, but also takes pride in his many talents. He is uncomfortable with public displays of affection, as well as invasion of his personal space. He is an overprotective and cautious father. He is shown to be a capable lawyer, even representing an entire building full of people one-by-one with no prior notice.[27] A recurring theme on the show is Mitchell's relationship with his father, which was strained by the revelation of Mitchell's homosexuality. Mitchell is a musical theater fan and enjoyed ice skating as a kid, though he later admitted that he liked working with his sister as a team more than the ice skating itself. Although he fancies himself as a handyman, everybody is afraid of him around tools. From his degrees hanging in his office, it is apparent that Mitchell attended undergrad at Cornell University and law school at Columbia University.\n\nTV.com has named Mitchell and Cameron one of the \"Five Best TV Dads,\" saying, \"Cam and Mitchell adopted baby Lily from Vietnam way back in Modern Family's pilot episode, and have been inadvertently Americanizing her ever since.\"[28]\n\nJesse Tyler Ferguson has been nominated five times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nFictional character\n\nCameron TuckerFirst appearance\"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009Last appearance\"Finale\"\n\n11x17 & 11x18, April 8, 2020Portrayed byEric StonestreetIn-universe informationFull nameCameron Scott Tucker-PritchettGenderMaleOccupationClown\n\nChristmas Caroler\n\nMusic teacher\n\nMiddle school music teacher\n\nHistory teacher\n\nHigh School Football Coach & Physical Education Teacher\n\nHigh school vice principal\n\nCollege Football Head CoachFamilyMerle Tucker (father)\n\nBarbara \"Barb\" Jammy Tucker (mother)\n\nPameron \"Pam\" Jessica Tucker (sister)\n\n2 unnamed biological siblingsSpouse\n\nMitchell Pritchett\n\n​\n\n(m. 2014) ​\n\nChildrenLily Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive daughter)\n\nRexford Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive son)RelativesBitsy (grandmother)\n\nBetsy (aunt)\n\nCarl (uncle)\n\nPat (biological aunt)\n\nCalhoun Johnson (nephew)\n\nJay Pritchett (father-in-law)\n\nDeDe Williams (mother-in-law; deceased)\n\nGloria Delgado-Pritchett (stepmother-in-law)\n\nClaire Dunphy (sister-in-law)\n\nJoe Pritchett (half brother-in-law)\n\nManny Delgado (stepbrother-in-law)\n\nHaley Dunphy (niece by marriage)\n\nAlex Dunphy (niece by marriage)\n\nLuke Dunphy (nephew by marriage)\n\nDylan Marshall (nephew-in-law by marriage)\n\nGeorge Marshall (grandnephew by marriage)\n\nPoppy Marshall (grandniece by marriage)NationalityAmerican\n\nCameron Scott \"Cam\" Tucker (Eric Stonestreet),[29] (February 29, 1972) is Mitchell's husband of eight years, and one of Lily's fathers, who has a huge dramatic personality. He frequently behaves like a drama queen. His bubbly, outgoing personality contrasts with Mitchell's uptight manner, which often causes the two to bicker between themselves.[30] Cameron was born on February 29, 1972, and grew up on a farm in Missouri. He was a starting center for the University of Illinois football team (which he and Jay bond over, much to Mitchell's envy) and is a huge sports fan.[30] Although Cam has gained weight since college and is not as muscular as he used to be, he is still physically quite imposing, partly owing to his height of 6'1\", and capable of scaring off anyone who threatens Mitchell. Cameron also fosters many unusual hobbies such as collecting antique fountain pens, being adept in Japanese flower arrangement, and is a classically trained Auguste clown named Fizbo.[30] Cameron prides himself in shooting home films, not movies, and takes that role very seriously. At the beginning of the series, he acts as a stay-at-home dad to Lily, though it is mentioned that he had taught music before this. In the later seasons, Cameron begins working as a football coach. Cameron is also an experienced rock drummer and, as a result, was brought in at the last minute to play in Dylan's band when they needed a replacement percussionist. Cameron is overly emotional about Lily, their adoptive daughter and doesn't approve of Mitchell's more strict parenting methods, such as letting her cry herself to sleep if she wakes up in the middle of the night.\n\nIt is also mentioned that Cameron was considerably thinner and in better shape when he first started dating Mitchell. For the first few episodes, his relationship with Mitchell was somewhat strained (as they disagreed on almost everything and showed very different parenting techniques). But in more recent episodes, the relationship is much happier.[30] Cameron and Mitchell met at one of Pepper Saltzman's \"legendary\" soirees, where during a game of charades, Cameron immediately knew the answer, \"Casablanca,\" based on a subtle gesture Mitchell made with his hands. Common interests, like art, led them to form a relationship. Mitchell is impressed by Cameron's quirks, such as speaking French (to which Cameron replies, \"un peu,\" meaning \"a little\"). Cameron is also said to be a huge fan of the movie The Wizard of Oz in the episode \"Leap Day\" when Mitchell plans him a surprise birthday party.[26]\n\nDuring season 4, Cameron goes back to work as a music teacher at Luke and Manny's school. In season 5, his music teacher job is eliminated, but he becomes the freshman football coach and physical education teacher. In season 6, he is promoted to varsity coach, and his undefeated record and open homosexuality earned him a story on the local television news.\n\nEric Stonestreet has received positive reviews for his characters. In a review of the first season, Robert Canning of IGN named Cameron Tucker the best character of the season, saying, \"Cameron's many talents and passions revealed over the course of this first year became an ever-building running gag. But it will be hard to top the sheer joy that was 'Fizbo.'\" He also called Fizbo, the episode and the clown, the highlight of the season.[8] The reception of Cameron and Mitchell led to the idea of a spin-off of the two titled Mitchell and Cam, although this ultimately never happened.[31]\n\nIn 2010, Eric Stonestreet was nominated for the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy.[32] Stonestreet has won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series twice in 2010 and 2012. He was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries, or Television Film in 2011, 2012, and 2013, along with receiving nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series in 2011, 2012 and 2013. In 2011, along with Ed O'Neill and Ty Burrell, Stonestreet was nominated for the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nFictional character\n\nLily Tucker-PritchettFirst appearance\"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009Last appearance\"Finale\"\n\n11x17 & 11x18, April 8, 2020Portrayed byJaden and Ella Hiller\n\n(seasons 1 & 2)\n\nAubrey Anderson-Emmons\n\n(seasons 3–11)In-universe informationFull nameLiliana Elizabeth Tucker-PritchettGenderFemaleOccupationStudentFamilyMitchell Pritchett (adoptive father)\n\nCameron Tucker (adoptive father)\n\nRexford Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive brother)RelativesJay Pritchett (adoptive grandfather)\n\nDeDe Williams (adoptive grandmother; deceased)\n\nGloria Delgado-Pritchett (adoptive step-grandmother)\n\nMerle Tucker (adoptive grandfather)\n\nBarbara \"Barb\" Jammy Tucker (adoptive grandmother)\n\nJoe Pritchett (adoptive half uncle)\n\nClaire Dunphy (adoptive aunt)\n\nPameron \"Pam\" Jessica Tucker (adoptive aunt)\n\nCalhoun Johnson (adoptive cousin)\n\nHaley Dunphy (adoptive cousin)\n\nAlex Dunphy (adoptive cousin)\n\nLuke Dunphy (adoptive cousin)\n\nDylan Marshall (adoptive cousin-in-law)\n\nGeorge Marshall (adoptive first cousin once removed)\n\nPoppy Marshall (adoptive first cousin once removed)\n\nPhil Dunphy (adoptive uncle by marriage)\n\nManny Delgado (adoptive step-uncle)NationalityVietnamese-American\n\nLily Elizabeth Tucker-Pritchett (Jaden and Ella Hiller seasons 1 and 2; Aubrey Anderson-Emmons seasons 3 to 11) is the adopted daughter of Cameron and Mitchell. They named her after the daughter of Charlotte from the HBO series Sex and the City and Cam's pig \"Aunt Lily.\"[27][30] In the show's early seasons, Cameron often dressed her up as famous people for photoshoots, such as Diana Ross, Olivia Newton-John, Madonna and Stevie Wonder. Cameron and Mitchell practiced the Ferber method on Lily when she was a baby, which prescribes allowing a baby to cry for a predetermined amount of time before intervening, though Cameron had difficulty fulling committing to this, even watching movies with her like Scarface, which he believes she likes because of the bright colors, particularly the club shooting scene. In the first two seasons, she was portrayed by twins Ella Hiller and Jaden Hiller. By season three, the twins \"retired,\" their mother stating they did not enjoy acting.[33] The role was recast with Aubrey Anderson-Emmons, who is older, and who uttered the character's first lines.\n\nAs she grows, Lily develops an extremely sarcastic and aloof personality, often annoyed by and exasperated with the eccentricities of her family. She also tends to be blunt and unafraid to speak her mind, no matter how impolite her thoughts may be. Her extended family consider her to be cold and callous, but she does harbor a deep love and loyalty towards them, though she rarely expresses it.\n\nLily's aloof mood and dry humor is there to balance the dramatic antics of her fathers and she constantly helps them see the light and find some common ground, like helping calm her parents when they adopted her baby brother Rexford. Lily had the alter ego of \"Lizbo\" to her dad Cam's \"Fizbo\" but in the end dropped it as she was tired of it. Lily seems to have inherited Jay's dry humor too being alongside Alex the grandchild that resembles him the most in demeanor.\n\nLarry is the pet cat of Lily, Cameron, and Mitchell. They adopt him in \"Bringing Up Baby\" (season 4, episode 1) after Cameron and Mitchell failed to adopt a second child.\n\nAdditional cast and characters from Modern Family Actor Character Season 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Shelley Long DeDe Pritchett Guest Guest Guest Recurring Guest Fred Willard Frank Dunphy Recurring Recurring Guest Recurring Guest Benjamin Bratt Javier Delgado Guest Recurring Guest Guest Guest Guest Elizabeth Banks Sal Guest Guest Recurring Guest Guest Guest Kevin Daniels Longinus Recurring Guest Recurring Guest Guest Recurring Nathan Lane Pepper Saltzman Recurring Guest Recurring Guest Guest Spenser McNeil Reuben Rand Guest Recurring Recurring Guest Phillip Baker Hall Walt Kleezak Guest Recurring Celia Weston Barb Tucker Guest Recurring Guest David Cross Duane Bailey Recurring Barry Corbin Merle Tucker Guest Recurring Rob Riggle Gil Thorpe Recurring Guest Guest Adam DeVine Andy Bailey Recurring Guest Christian Barillas Ronaldo Recurring Guest Recurring Andrew Daly Principal Brown Recurring Recurring Recurring Dana Powell Pam Tucker Recurring Guest Recurring Guest Arden Belle Rhonda Recurring Laura Ashley Samuels Beth Recurring Brooke Sorenson Tammy LaFontaine Recurring Guest Aubree Young Sydney Barrow Recurring Guest Steve Zahn Ronnie Recurring Andrea Anders Amber LaFontaine Recurring Suraj Partha Sanjay Patel Guest Recurring Jon Polito/Robert Costanzo Earl Chambers Guest Recurring Guest Joe Mande Ben Guest Recurring Nathan Fillion Rainer Shine Recurring Guest Chris Geere Arvin Fennerman Recurring Jimmy Tatro Bill Guest Recurring Guest Marcello Julian Reyes Cal Recurring\n\nFictional character\n\nDeDe PritchettFirst appearance\"The Incident\"\n\n1x04, October 14, 2009Last appearance\"Good Grief\"\n\n10x05, October 24, 2018Portrayed byShelley LongIn-universe informationFull nameDeDe Bruja Williams-PritchettGenderFemaleFamilyLucas Williams (father; deceased)\n\nBeBe Williams (sister)\n\nCeCe Williams (sister)Spouse\n\nJay Pritchett\n\n​\n\n​\n\n(m. 1968; div. 2003) ​\n\nJerry\n\n​\n\n(m. 2016) ​\n\nSignificant otherChaz\n\nRobbie Sullivan\n\nCarlChildrenClaire Dunphy (daughter)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (son)RelativesHaley Dunphy (granddaughter)\n\nAlex Dunphy (granddaughter)\n\nLuke Dunphy (grandson)\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive granddaughter)\n\nRexford Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive grandson)\n\nGeorge Marshall (great-grandson)\n\nPoppy Marshall (great-granddaughter)\n\nPhil Dunphy (son-in-law)\n\nCameron Tucker (son-in-law)\n\nDylan Marshall (grandson-in-law)\n\nDonnie Pritchett (ex-brother-in-law)\n\nBecky Pritchett (ex-sister-in-law)\n\nDeDe Pritchett (Shelley Long) is Claire and Mitchell's mother, Haley, Alex and Luke's maternal grandmother and one of the grandmothers of Lily and Rexford, Phil and Cam's mother-in-law, and Jay's ex-wife. It is implied that she might be mentally ill due to her somewhat manipulative and sometimes aggressive ways. It is implied that she was initially more accepting of Mitchell's sexual orientation than Jay was when he first came out. She often uses her close relationship with Mitchell to get him to do things he does not want to do. Jay wanted to divorce her after a spectacular fight they had while their kids were still in school (he taped over an episode of Dallas to record an NFL game that, ironically, featured the Dallas Cowboys) but was inspired by an animatronic Abraham Lincoln exhibit at Disneyland to stick things out until Claire and Mitchell reached adulthood. She is still bitter over Jay's remarriage to Gloria and even attempted to ruin their wedding, which she convinced Mitchell to talk Jay and Gloria into inviting her to; she got drunk and made rude and inappropriate toasts and eventually had to be dragged out of the reception, in the process ruining the wedding cake. She is very aggressive towards Gloria, often trying to attack her physically. DeDe is also passive-aggressive toward Cameron about his weight and is often critical of Claire, especially her appearance. She also seems to be terrific friends with Manny as they write letters to each other talking about their issues. DeDe is also a famous author and poet. A running gag throughout the series is that DeDe's arrival is always forewarned by bad omens (birds crashing into the window or peaceful scenarios spontaneously turning chaotic).\n\nHer relationship with Gloria becomes more strained in Season 1 when she wants to apologize to her for the wedding fiasco but ends up physically attacking her saying she can't be nice to her. But this relationship improved in the episode \"Arrested.\" of Season 4. When DeDe sees that Gloria is pregnant, she finds it hilarious that Jay's marriage to a much younger trophy wife has forced him to raise a child in his 60s. She found a new sympathy for Gloria, and the two bonded over Jay-bashing when DeDe tells Gloria that she was always the one having to change diapers, clean spit-up, and buy things for the baby. Gloria, in turn, found a new sympathy for DeDe, suggesting that her lack of support from Jay was what caused her to become \"so crazy.\"\n\nIn the season 10 episode, \"Good Grief\", which takes place on Halloween, DeDe dies peacefully in her sleep while on a trip with her women's group.[34]\n\nFictional character\n\nFrank DunphyFirst appearance\"Undeck the Halls\"\n\n1x10, December 9, 2009Last appearance\"Legacy\"\n\n11x11, January 15, 2020Portrayed byFred WillardIn-universe informationFull nameFranklin Bernard DunphyGenderMaleSpouseGrace Dunphy (d. 2013)\n\nLorraine Dunphy\n\n​\n\n(m. 2017) ​\n\nChildrenPhil Dunphy (son)\n\nRay (stepson)RelativesHaley Dunphy (granddaughter)\n\nAlex Dunphy (granddaughter)\n\nLuke Dunphy (grandson)\n\nGeorge Marshall (great-grandson)\n\nPoppy Marshall (great-granddaughter)\n\nClaire Dunphy (daughter-in-law)\n\nDylan Marshall (grandson-in-law)\n\nFrancis Allen \"Frank\" Dunphy (Fred Willard) is Phil's father and Haley, Alex and Luke's paternal grandfather. On Christmas, the family shared a webcam chat with him.\n\nFrank returns in \"Travels with Scout\" when he travels cross country without Phil's mother and shows up with a dog that he says she has allergies to. He ends up taking the dog back with him.[35] Frank is kind of a polar opposite of Jay's (Claire's father) grumpiness and dry manner, as he is seen being laid back, funny and cool most of the time. Claire mentions this in \"Closet, You'll Love it!\" when most family members refer to Jay as 'Grump-pa' while Frank is referred to as 'Fun-pa.' His attitude is a near carbon copy of Phil's personality. At the end of season 4, it is revealed that Frank's wife (Phil's mother) had died. In season 8, Frank starts dating Lorraine, Phil's childhood babysitter and crush. Later, he proposes to her, and in episode 19, they get married.\n\nIn the episode \"Legacy,\" Phil visits Frank in Florida after hearing some concerning news about him, and then at the end of the episode, Frank dies.\n\nIn 2010, Willard was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nFictional character\n\nJavier DelgadoFirst appearance\"Up All Night\"\n\n1x11, January 6, 2010Last appearance\"Dead on a Rival\"\n\n11x12, January 22, 2020Portrayed byBenjamin BrattIn-universe informationFull nameJavier Hectoro DelgadoGenderMaleSpouse\n\nGloria Ramirez\n\n​\n\n​\n\n(m. 1995; div. 2006) ​\n\nSignificant otherTrish (fiancée)ChildrenManny Delgado (son)RelativesFulgencio Ramírez (ex-father-in-law; deceased)\n\nPilar Ramírez (ex-mother-in-law)\n\nSonia Ramírez (ex-sister-in-law)NationalityColombian\n\nJavier Delgado (Benjamin Bratt) is Manny's biological father and Gloria's ex-husband.

In the episode \"Flip Flop,\" he has a girlfriend named Trish (Paget Brewster) and almost marries her.\n\nJavier was formerly a Triple-A baseball player and played alongside such baseball greats as Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire. He has many connections to matadors and baseball players.

Lily is the one who finally tells her. Pam seems extremely happy with the news and shares her news with them; she is engaged to Cameron's first crush, Bo Johnson. Cameron gets upset hearing that, and Pam tells him that no one in the family wanted to tell him because he is too sensitive. They were protecting him, something that contradicts Cameron's earlier assertion and makes Cameron even more upset. When the whole family gathers at Jay and Gloria's house, Cameron wants to prove that he is not that sensitive as Pam accuses him and asks everyone to tell him things they were hiding from him because they were trying to protect him. Everyone says their part, and Cameron, as much as he tries not to break down in tears, after hearing Lily admitting that she pretends to fall asleep when he reads to her so he can leave her alone, breaks down in tears and finishes locking himself in the bathroom.

That was when he came up behind Jay, kissed him on the back of the head, and said \"Goodnight, Becky.\", thinking he was his sister.\n\nBecky has a son named Brian, and it is his wedding which Jay, DeDe, Claire, and Mitchell attend in the episode \"Sarge & Pea.\"\n\nBecky makes her first appearance in \"The Escape,\". It is revealed that Becky is a mean woman and kind of a monster. She and Jay have a troubled relationship and haven't spoken in 9 years. Gloria only met Becky once, at her and Jay's wedding. When Claire and Mitchell were kids, they were terrified of her.\n\nBecky is in a nursing home, recovering from a stroke. Jay, Gloria, Mitchell, Cam, Claire, and Phil all pay Becky a visit. They enter her room to find her sleeping with the \"same mean old puss on her face.\" After she awakes to find them there, a doctor comes in and tells the family that the stroke may have scrambled Becky's memories. She doesn't remember Mitchell coming out as gay and she asks Jay if she can borrow his fishing cabin for the coming summer. But this was her cabin. It had belonged to their father who told Jay he was leaving it to him. But instead, he left it to Becky.\n\nClaire sees that Becky is wearing the necklace she loaned her to wear at Jay and Gloria's wedding and never returned. She told Claire she lost it. Now Becky tells them she got the necklace from a prince in Liechtenstein. Claire brings along Becky's favorite tomato soup and heats it up, hoping the smell will jog her memory.\n\nIn the end, Becky reveals that her memory is fine and the doctor who was tending to her is really just a friend named Fred from next door. He once played a doctor on a soap opera and kept the coat. Claire and Mitchell come back in and Claire attempts to fool Becky into returning the necklace by telling her that she just got off the phone with the prince of Liechtenstein who told her he's in financial trouble and needs the necklace back to feed his people. Then Jay reveals to Claire and Mitchell that there was nothing wrong with Becky's memory and she was messing with them. They are furious and Claire demands Becky return the necklace. But she refuses to give it back until Claire fixes the dent she put in Becky's car back in high school. And when Claire doesn't deny it, she keeps the necklace. In the final scene, Claire is waiting in the car when Phil rushes out with the necklace. He had gone back in, gave Becky a hug goodbye, used his sleight-of-hand, and retrieved the necklace on the third try. This made Claire very happy. As they are leaving, they see Becky coming up behind them on her motorized cart, telling them to give her that necklace.\n\nFictional character\n\nSalFirst appearance\"Great Expectations\"\n\n1x08, November 18, 2009Last appearance\"Finale\"\n\n11x17 & 11x18, April 8, 2020Portrayed byElizabeth BanksIn-universe informationFull nameSally SwanGenderFemaleFamilySammy (son)Spouse\n\nTony\n\n​\n\n(divorced) ​\n\nSignificant otherEddie (boyfriend)\n\nSal (Elizabeth Banks) is Mitch and Cameron's wild, partying, boozy friend from their younger years in the 1990s.

They then go over to his house to interrogate him, and he snaps at them and tells them to keep Luke. The next morning, Luke reprimands Walt for not being nice to his parents and could not hang out.

He makes his second appearance on the show in the episode \"Career Day,\" where he shows up for Career Day in Luke and Manny's class during Phil's presentation. Seeing Claire's visible frustration at being a housewife, he offers her a position on his real estate team. He is known for his energetic, lively, and harassing personality as well as his tendency to use his name in replacement of words in conversation (e.g., \"Thorpedoed,\" \"Gil Pickles\").

He is amiable, cordial, slightly naive at times, but still smart and refuses to use any \"bad language.\" Gloria took an immediate liking to Andy upon meeting him. Still, Jay disapproved of his overly friendly nature, saying, \"He's a weird man. He's like Phil; only I have to pay for him.\" He often butts heads with Haley as she is rude and breaks the rules, and she makes fun of him for his overly amiable nature. He talks about his long-time girlfriend who is in the Coast Guard in Utah, but she breaks up with him in \"The Wedding (Part 1)\". Haley discovers that she has been keeping Andy \"on the hook\" for the last seven years as they have been on-again-off-again, and she does not treat Andy the way he treats her. His father died of cancer when he was 14, as explained in \"The Help.\" Haley begins to appreciate Andy's demeanor and treatment of women in \"Other People's Children\" and tries to perhaps start a relationship with him in the two-part episode \"The Wedding.\" However, Alex convinces Haley that she is not that into him. She stops her pursuit as Andy was ready to jump into it. Afterward, Andy drives away, perhaps to his flight to see his ex-girlfriend. Andy also becomes a quick friend to the Dunphy family.\n\nIn the Season 6 episode \"The Cold,\" Andy and Haley discuss their relationship. They agree that they should stay friends. However, Haley gets upset when Andy claims that if they had kissed, she wouldn't get over him. To try to prove him wrong, Haley kisses him. Andy is unaffected by this, but Haley has a smitten look afterward. In the episode \"Queer Eyes, Full Hearts\" Haley helps Andy get a job as Phil's assistant, and Andy helps her prepare for an interview with a fashion designer. During the episode, they seem completely platonic, and it is also revealed that Andy is back together with Beth. In \"Rash Decisions,\" Luke becomes distant from Phil, and Andy becomes his right-hand man. In the episode \"Connection Lost,\" Claire assumes by mistake that Haley and Andy had gotten married. In \"Closet? You'll Love It!\", Andy ends up at the hospital due to appendicitis which had Haley worried enough to visit him but arrived at him a bit too groggy with the drugs the doctors had given him, leading her to tell his sleeping form that he had a shot with her, unbeknownst to Haley that he had heard everything she said.[38] Andy decides to talk to her about her hospital visit in \"Grill, Interrupted\", but Haley's new boyfriend interrupts them before Andy could bring it up. At the end of the episode, Haley mentions to Andy that she wasn't looking for a serious relationship at the moment, which appeared to disappoint him. In the Season 6 finale \"American Skyper,\" Andy reveals to Phil that he already had the engagement ring that he had been saving up for, but is hesitant to propose to Beth because he's still confused about the feelings he has for someone else. Phil advises him to propose to Beth but later finds out that Andy had feelings for Haley, who was also in love with Andy. The episode ends with Phil attempting to tell Andy and Haley that they loved each other but failing to do so, as Andy leaves the house to propose to Beth at a beach he liked. As of \"White Christmas\" in Season 7, Andy and Haley are in a relationship. In season 8, he and Haley broke up because of a long-distance relationship.[39]\n\nFictional character\n\nRonaldoFirst appearance\"The Help\"\n\n5x06, October 23, 2013Portrayed byChristian BarillasIn-universe informationFull nameRonaldo Muñoz-SaltzmanGenderMaleOccupationWedding Planner, Pepper's AssistantSignificant otherPepper Saltzman (boyfriend)\n\nRonaldo is Pepper Saltzman's assistant and later boyfriend.

Many years before the events of \"Won't You Be Our Neighbor,\" Earl and Jay worked together. They had formed their closet company, Closet-fornia, and the business became successful. One day, Jay came into work, and Earl's desk had been cleared out. He had badmouthed Jay to half their Rolodex, and Jay had to start all over. In the present, it turns out Manny met Earl's granddaughter Sophie in his theater group, and she is now his new girlfriend. This makes Jay mad when he finds out that his rival is her grandfather after showing a new idea of his for work.\n\nGloria organizes a dinner for the two men to work things out, but they soon start disputing again. Earl is also angered to hear that his granddaughter is groping his rival's stepson.\n\nEarl goes to Jay and Gloria's house because he thinks the rivalry between him and Jay is getting way out of control and wants to work it out. Manny then enters and introduces himself; Earl asks if this is \"the stud who's been groping [his] Sophie,\" Manny tries to assure him that there's nothing untoward between Manny and Sophie. Earl laughs and tells Manny he \"believes\" him (maybe, maybe not). Earl sees the box that Jay had shown earlier to Manny, Gloria, and Sophie, and Earl says he thinks he will call it the Sock 'n Roll, takes the box, and leaves. Jay shouts at him, \"The hell you are!\"\n\nEarl reappears in \"The Closet Case\" where Mitchell has been called to work for him in a consultant job. Earl tricks Mitchell into thinking that Earl wants to bury the hatchet with Jay. A van pulls up in front of Jay's house, and Jay sees what has happened. That night, Jay and Mitchell break into Earl's office, and Earl catches them; Mitchell is disgusted at Earl for tricking him. Earl and Jay start fighting again, and later in Jay's car, Mitchell returns his father's old Rolodex to him. This gesture makes Jay very happy; Mitchell snuck it out of Earl's office while he and Jay had their ten-minute fight.\n\nEarl reappears in \"The Cover-Up\" where it turns out that he is leaving horrible comments on Jay's new web show. Jay and Manny track Earl down to his house and, with help from Alex, find out that he's the one doing it. After a brief fight, Earl suggests that he and Jay could make their collective show, to which Jay refuses. Earl decides to make his show instead and deactivates comments – much to Jay's wrath – so Jay won't be able to troll him back.\n\nEarl briefly reappears in \"Halloween 4: The Revenge of Rod Skyhook\" (now played by Robert Costanzo, because Jon Polito died), dressed as the Devil. He fights with Jay, dressed as Jesus, and asks Manny to steal a picture from Earl's mansion. The two start fighting until Jay looks at his reflection in the mirror and gives up on trying to take the picture.\n\nIn \"In Your Head,\" it was revealed that Earl has died and left his ashes, along with a note, for Jay to complete a mind game to locate where he has to spread his ashes.\n\nFictional character\n\nRonnie LaFontaineFirst appearance\"Won't You Be Our Neighbor\"\n\n6x05, October 22, 2014Portrayed bySteve ZahnIn-universe informationFull nameRonnie Luster LaFontaineGenderMaleOccupationMedical Marijuana VendorSpouseAmber LaFontaine (wife)ChildrenRonnie LaFontaine Jr. (son)\n\nTammy LaFontaine (daughter)\n\nRonnie LaFontaine (Steve Zahn) is a man who moves next door to the Dunphys with his wife, Amber, and their children, Ronnie Jr. and Tammy.
