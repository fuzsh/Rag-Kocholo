Each clip features Colombian actress Sofia Vergara as her character Gloria (Delgado) Pritchett. Gloria speaks with a very thick accent and mispronounces a number of English words. This way of speaking is one of Gloria’s signature traits on the show.\n\ndiscussion\n\nIn these clips, does Gloria seem smarter or dumber than other people? Does she seem intelligent in her interactions with other people? Why or why not?\n\nVergara and her character Gloria are both from Colombia. Do you think Vergara speaks like her character in real life? If not, why would the producers of the show want her to emphasize her accent on television?"
