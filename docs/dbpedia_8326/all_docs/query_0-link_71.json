The Emmy-winning comedy, which aired for 11 seasons from 2009 to April 2020, followed the lives of three related families as they dealt with various challenges and adventures.\n\nThe \"Modern Family\" cast during ABC's coverage of the Disney 2019 Upfront Experience on May 14, 2019 in New York City | Source: Getty Images\n\nThe show was praised for its diverse and relatable characters, witty and heartfelt writing, and groundbreaking representation of blended families and same-sex couples. During the years the actors worked together, they developed a close bond, and when they learned that one elusive cast member was in Los Angeles, they spontaneously planned a reunion.\n\nThe \"Modern Family\" cast during ABC's 2020 Winter TCA in May 2020 in Pasadena, California | Source: Getty Images\n\nThe 'Modern Family' Reunion\n\nThe reunion, which took place on November 15, 2023, was attended by almost all of the prominent cast members, including Ed O'Neill (Jay Pritchett), Julie Bowen (Claire Dunphy), Eric Stonestreet (Cameron Tucker), Jesse Tyler Ferguson (Mitchell Pritchett), Sarah Hyland (Haley Dunphy), Ariel Winter (Alex Dunphy), Nolan Gould (Luke Dunphy), Rico Rodriguez (Manny Delgado), and Aubrey Anderson-Emmons (Lily Tucker-Pritchett).\n\nThe only one missing was Ty Burrell, who played Phil Dunphy, the lovable and goofy father of the Dunphy clan. Vergara, who played Jay's second wife, Gloria Delgado, shared several photos and videos of the gathering on her Instagram account, showing the cast members having a great time smiling, laughing, and hugging each other.\n\nShe also posted a video of a framed photo of Burrell on her fireplace mantel, with the caption, \"We miss u Ty!!\" In the video, the cast members are seen shouting, \"We miss you, Ty!\" and \"I love you, Dad!\" to the picture, as if they were talking to Burrell himself.\n\nThe absence of Burrell, who won two Emmys for his portrayal of Phil, sparked concern among the show fans, who wondered if he was unwell or had a falling out with his co-stars.\n\nSome even feared that he had passed away, as they saw Winter holding his photo in the group picture. Burrell, who is 56 years old, has not publicly commented on his health status or the reason for his absence. However, according to his IMDb page, he has been busy with several projects since the end of Modern Family.\n\nFan comments dated November 2023 | Source: The \"Modern Family\" cast | Source: instagram.com/sofiavergara\n\nThe group has kept in touch even after the show. They have been holding mini-reunions from time to time, and in August 2022, they attended Hyland's wedding in Solvang, California. These gatherings underline the unique bond formed during the \"Modern Family\" years.\n\nFan comments dated November 2023 | Source: instagram.com/sofiavergara\n\nWhat Has Ty Burrell Been up To?\n\nAfter a stellar run as Phil, Burrell seamlessly transitioned from the cool TV dad to a multifaceted individual, both on and off the screen. In a 2017 interview, the actor gave fans a peek into his world beyond the Dunphy household.\n\nTy Burrell playing the role of Phil Dunphy on ABC's \"Modern Family\" season 11 | Source: Getty Images\n\nLike his on-screen character, Burrell is more than just a funny face. He inherited a strong sense of philanthropy from his father, Gary Burrell, who dedicated his life to working with the foster care system and child services. When his father passed away, Burrell, then a college student, chose to carry on his father's legacy.\n\nFor several years, he has actively contributed to various philanthropic endeavors. The actor who played one Emmy-Winning episode of \"Family Guy\" is a family man in the truest sense, and he extends his concept of family far beyond the script.\n\nTy Burrell playing the role of Phil Dunphy on ABC's \"Modern Family\" season 11 | Source: Getty Images\n\nIn addition to his wife of over twenty years, Holly, and their adopted daughters, Frances and Greta, Burrell formed close bonds with his \"Modern Family\" co-stars. The bond developed over a decade of working together made them feel like a genuine family. He once said:\n\n\"I absolutely feel like everyone is family at this point.\"\n\nTy Burrell and Julie Bowen as Phil and Claire Dunphy on \"Modern Family\" season 10 | Source: Getty Images\n\nPost-\"Modern Family,\" Burrell didn't rest on his laurels. He ventured into voice acting, lending his voice to the character Jack Harris on \"Duncanville,\" a show from 2020 to 2022. Additionally, he took on a narrator role in the 6th episode of the \"Table Read Podcast\" Season 1 in the current year, showcasing his versatility in the entertainment industry.\n\nBurrell has also voiced Mr. Peabody in the animated series \"The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show,\" starred in the comedy film \"The French Dispatch,\" and produced the documentary series \"Ty Breaker,\" which follows him as he helps families decide whether to renovate their current homes or move to new ones.\n\nTy Burrell playing the role of Phil Dunphy on \"Modern Family\" season 10 | Source: Getty Images\n\nWhere Are the \"Modern Family\" Stars Now?\n\nThe rest of the cast members have also been active in various fields, such as acting, hosting, writing, and directing.

However, she remains resilient. A dedicated mother to three sons â Oliver, Gus, and John â Bowen has shifted gears with upcoming roles in \"Hysteria\" and \"Wild Things.\" Despite life's challenges, she continues to thrive both personally and professionally.\n\nKnown for her role as the vibrant Haley Dunphy, the eldest of the Dunphy brood, Hyland faced significant health challenges. Despite enduring endometriosis and kidney failure, her positive outlook and stability are evident in her social media posts, and in August, she celebrated her first wedding anniversary.\n\nPost-\"Modern Family,\" she's been busy with projects like \"Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin,\" \"Untitled Sara Hyland/Emily V.

While settling into a new home, she continues her acting journey with projects like \"Hungry\" and \"Pools.\"\n\nGould, the lovable baby of the family with a low IQ, Luke Dunphy, showcased his intellectual prowess by graduating high school at 13.
