The Only Murders in the Building star celebrated with a cake, and wrote a message on her Instagram Story July 17.\n\n\"I'm honored and insanely gratefuly for this,\" Selena wrote. \"Thank you @onlymurdershulu for giving me Mabel.\"\n\nUpon recieving his nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance on season 49 of Saturday Night Live, Bowen shared plenty of gratitude for the entire cast and crew behind the production on his Instagram.\n\n\"Every single person who works at @nbcsnl does the impossible every week, on most weeks in nine months out of the year!\" Bowen wrote in a July 17 Instagram post. Cast crew writers departments are all the best of the best. Very honored to work with them and be the laughing bathtub lady of the group.\"\n\n\"It’s a real honour for me and the whole creative team for BECKHAM to be recognised by the TV Academy,\" the soccer star wrote. \"Making this series was such a personal journey, a love letter to football and my family. It has been overwhelming for me and Victoria that we have had such a warm and positive response to the series. I’m so grateful to the incredible team led by Fisher Stevens and also to all those people from my life and career who took part and who have played such an important role in my story.”\n\n\"Wow,\" Sofia wrote in a statement. \"Griselda was my first dramatic role ever, and it took us 15 years to bring her to life. I’m incredibly grateful to everyone who was a part of this series. I could have never done this without my director Andres Baiz, my costar Alberto Guerra, Eric Newman and the full creative team, my partner and producer Luis Balaguer, Ted Sarandos, Bela Bajaria, and their team at Netflix, and all the amazing cast and crew.\"\n\nAnd the America's Got Talent judge also nodded to her Emmy-winning roots.\n\n\"I never dreamed that after Modern Family I would be able to work on something as special as Griselda,\" she added. \"I’m honored to be recognized alongside Jodie, Brie, Juno, and Naomi, incredible women who gave us incredible TV this year. Thank you to the Television Academy for this incredible honor!”\n\n“I am proud to be part of a team that today received 9 Emmy Award nominations, including one for myself. Our entire Slow Horses family try every day to make a quality show, and while we are doing it, we never think of prizes—which makes it so very gratifying to see the work recognized in so many areas. Our cast, director, writer, composer and each department and creative area lavish such careful talent and attentiveness, that is it amazing to see it all come together and to have the response we have had. As for me, I have always loved the quality of things you can see on television, and yes, the cliché’s are true, I am humbled to be added to the impressive list of others nominated today and in past years.”\n\n“I was lucky and delighted to have a very good part on an extremely terrific show,\" Matthew—who was nominated for his guest appearance—said. \"I got to work with some old friends and make some new ones, too. It’s very nice to get home from work with your face hurting from laughing. Thank you to everyone at Only Murders In The Building and especially to John Hoffman and my old dear friend Martin Short, you made me feel so welcome. Thanks to the Television Academy for this. I’m deeply honored and over the moon happy.”\n\n“I am so touched by this nomination,\" Lily—who also recieved her first Oscar nomination in 2024—said. \"I wholeheartedly share the honor with the stellar cast of Under the Bridge, who brought such deep compassion and unmatched talent to telling Reena Virk’s story. Every beating heart on screen gave so much of themselves to honor her legacy.\"\n\nLily finished by thanking her costars Vritika Gupta, Archie Panjabi and Riley Keough.\n\n\"I’d especially like to thank Vritika, Archie and Riley, I am so inspired by you all,\" she added. \"Thank you to Quinn Shephard, Samir Mehta, Liz Tigelaar, Stacey Silverman, Gina Gammell and Riley Keough for bringing this story to light and being champions of radical empathy. I’m forever grateful to have been brought along for the journey.”\n\n“It is always an honour to be noticed by the Television Academy, and it is especially rewarding when a new show is selected,\" Julian—who wrote and created the series—said. \"Six Emmy nominations for The Gilded Age is more than I could have dreamed of, and I am absolutely thrilled. They have provided a public recognition of the wonderful work of our cast and crew, all of them stars in my eyes, and I am so grateful for that.”\n\n\"This means the world,\" Juno wrote. \"I'm so deeply grateful to FX, the whole cast and our amazing crew—working on was the most extraordinary, special experience. Noah Hawley is a goddamn genius.\"\n\nNaturally, Juno nodded to her fellow castmates Lamonre Morris and Jon Hamm.\n\n\"I couldn’t be happier that the show, Jon and Lamorne were recognized as well,\" she added. \"Dot’s journey is one of survival and pure love, and I’m eternally grateful I got to be part of bringing this story to life. Heck yeah!!\"\n\n“I couldn’t have imagined in my wildest dreams when I was writing this show in my tiny flat during Covid that it would go on to have 11 Emmy nominations,\" Richard, who wrote and starred in the series, said in a statement. \"I am so grateful to the academy for recognising this show. You have made a little boy from a tiny Scottish town‘s dreams come true and I am crying, with happiness, even as I write this. I would like to extend my thanks to Netflix, Clerkenwell, and all the wonderful cast and crew who worked on this show, as well as my team who are quite simply the greatest.\"\n\nThe comedian, who based the show somewhat on his own life, finished by thanking the charitable organizations who supported him during a rough time.\n\n\"I would also like to thank We Are Survivors for all their help in the charities space, as well as the Suzy Lamplugh Trust,\" he added. \"Ten years ago I was down and out. I hope this is a reminder for anyone going through a hard time right now to keep going. There is light even in the darkest of rooms. Fight hard and you will find it.”\n\n“Playing Tim Laughlin was the experience of a lifetime, and I will carry him with me always,\" Jonathan said in a statement, also nodding to his costar Matt Bomber. \"For this experience to be recognized in this way, and alongside Matt, my ultimate co-pilot, is truly a dream and an honor (alt: beyond my wildest dreams) It is not lost on me that this sort of recognition is rare. I’ve grown up savouring the minimal queer television and film on offer whilst battling problematic media and societal criticism of queer life. I have loved so many celebrated dramatic performances of gay characters but for Matt and I to be nominated together as gay actors feels like the sort of progress that would have made the world an easier place to grow up in.\"\n\nHe also sent love to the show's creator Ron Nyswaner and the entire cast, which included Matt, Allison Williams, Noah Ricketts, and Jelani Alladin\n\n\"For that I am grateful and so unbelievably proud,\" he continued. \"Thank you to the TV Academy for this opportunity. I share this with Ron, Matt, Noah, Jelani, Allison, the entire Fellow Travelers family. And of course, with Tim and all the other angels who fought before us.”\n\n\"What is happening!\" The show's creators wrote. \"Thank you to the Television Academy! We really weren’t expecting this, but damn did we put in some work—it’s not every day you get to make something with a bunch of your best friends and it’s definitely not every day that it then receives love this way.\"\n\nThe duo did not shy away from giving everyone who brought the show to life their flowers, too—including Donald's costar Maya Erskine.\n\n\"We want to do a quick shout out to the people who deserve some recognition,\" the pair continued. \"Jen, Vernon, Kara, Carina, and the entire Amazon team for your unwavering support in making this our way, Michael Schaefer (the muscle), Yariv and New Regency, Anthony 'I’ll never say no' Katagas (you’re the man), Kaitlin (the glue), Fam (the secret sauce), Hiro (the visionary), Christian (the heart), Carmen Cuba (queen), Doug, Karena, Amy, Christina, Steve, Carla, Adamma, Adanne, Yvonne, Julia, Schuyler, Kyle, Isaac, Kate and especially Greg, Dave, Gerry, Ruth, Madeline, Blair, Cody, Stephen Murphy, Pope and his amazing team, Nathan, Rob, Eric, Glen, Emile, all of our ridiculously talented guest stars, the rest of the tirelessly committed cast and crew, including and especially to all of the PAs and assistants. And most importantly, thank you to Maya for your generosity and incomparable genius in being our Jane. We love you all!\"\n\n\"90 percent sure my pottery studio thinks someone I love just died because I yelled WHAT and then started sobbing when i got the text that GIRLS5EVA WAS NOMINATED FOR 2 EMMY AWARD,\" the star wrote in an emotional Instagram post. \"CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR FEARLESS LEADER @scardinoandsons AND ALL OF OUR WRITERS FOR THEIR NOMINATION FOR WRITING AND @sarabareilles FOR HER NOMINATION FOR BEST SONG FOR HER GENIUS SONG \"MEDIUM TIME.\" A REMINDER THAT ALL 3 SEASONS OF THE BEST COMEDY YOU HAVEN’T WATCHED IS AVAILABLE ON NETFLIX SO GET INTO IT!!!!\"\n\n“I mean, overwhelmed doesn’t really cover it,\" Jennifer—who starred alongside Richard Gadd in the Netflix series—wrote. \"Astonished might be more apt! Thank you so much to the Television Academy for this incredible honour.I am so proud to be part of Baby Reindeer and to see it get 11 Emmy nominations is incredible; to also be nominated, and alongside some of my favourite actresses, truly is a dream come true. I can’t quite believe it.”\n\n“I am so deeply honored to be nominated for an Emmy,\" Aja said. \"It is difficult to put language to the abundance of emotion I feel right now but foremost in my mind is my deep gratitude. Gratitude to the Television Academy, the incredible Lessons in Chemistry cast and crew that I had the privilege to work alongside, and to every person who ever told me to keep going. Thank you.”\n\n“Thank you to the Television Academy for finally recognizing all my hard work on New Girl!\" Lamorne joked in a statement. \"Although I believe it’s a lock, I do see I’m nominated alongside Robert Downey Jr. who stole my role in Tropic Thunder. My fellow nominees and I won’t let this slide.This is a great honor, and I couldn’t be more excited! Truly blessed to work with such a talented cast and crew!\"\n\nThe first time Emmy nominee also added a specific shoutout to writer and director Noah Hawley\n\n\"Special thank you Noah for the opportunity and trusting me to bring Witt Farr to life!\" Lamorne added. \"Go Fargo!”\n\n“I am at a complete loss for words,\" the actress wrote. \"This morning is such an emotional rollercoaster filled with tears of joy over this recognition of my work, and for my humanity as a trans Latina woman.\"\n\nNava, who made history as the first Latina transgender actress to be nominated in her category, also included a note on what it means to her.\n\n\"Today is an affirmation of my existence and my journey as a working actor,\" she continued. \"It is a dream come true and I am so humbled and deeply grateful for this nomination. Most importantly, I am thankful to my peers for not only bestowing me with this nomination, but celebrating this groundbreaking moment for the Trans community at large. I extend my endless gratitude and congratulations to Richard Gadd, Jessica Gunning, and my entire Baby Reindeer family. This has been the ride of a lifetime, and I am so deeply moved to be sharing this with all of you. Mil gracias y mucho amor a mi familia en México y San Antonio!”\n\n“It was such a nice surprise when I heard this morning,\" Matt wrote, noting his husband Simon Halls broke the news to him. \"I didn’t know today was the day of the nominations. I was making coffee when Simon came in to tell me. I am incredibly grateful and thrilled that Jonny and Ron’s beautiful work was recognized as well. The fact that two out actors in a love story were recognized in this way is profoundly moving to me.”\n\n“I am trying to find the words, but this thank you just feels so big,\" Brie said. \"Thank you to the Television Academy for recognizing the talent, drive and passion of our Lessons in Chemistry team. To see so many departments lifted up is the greatest feeling. I am honored to say that I witnessed the most amazing people do the most amazing things. I am humbled by the world Bonnie Garmus and Elizabeth Zott has opened my heart to. And I am thrilled beyond belief that we get this chance to toast and eat together one last time. I’m the happiest woman in the universe.”"
