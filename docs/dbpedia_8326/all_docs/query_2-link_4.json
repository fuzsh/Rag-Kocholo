He is the husband of Claire and father of three children Haley, Alex and Luke.

She was wild and out of control as a teenager. She is the wife of Phil Dunphy and mother of three children Haley, Alex and Luke.\n\nHaley Gwendolyn Dunphy (Sarah Hyland) is the eldest Dunphy child. She is a college student and also a fashion designer. She is known as the Dunphy kid who wants to be with friends and going out to parties rather than study.

She begins at another college and gets a job as a fashion designer. She has an on-off relationship with Dylan and is currently in a relationship with Jay and Gloria's male nanny, Andy Bailey.\n\nAlexandria Anastasia \"Alex\" Dunphy (Ariel Winter) is the middle Dunphy child.
