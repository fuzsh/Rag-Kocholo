        "text": "Gru and The Minions are back, and they have new foes. Brace yourselves for the return of your favorite retired supervillain in the upcoming fourth installment of the Despicable Me series. The animated franchise follows the journey of Gru, a retired supervillain who now navigates the challenges of family life while attempting to spread goodness in the world. Anticipation is high for the fourth chapter, set to grace theaters this summer and promising a thrilling continuation of the beloved classic.\n\nThe familiar voices we all love are returning to the film alongside some fresh additions. To help those excited about the upcoming Despicable Me 4, let's take a look at the star-studded cast.\n\nSteve Carell as Gru\n\nGorls, he's back! Comedy legend Steve Carell returns to reprise his iconic role as the retired supervillain, Gru. Carell infuses Gru with his trademark quirkiness and humor, making him (and the accent) unforgettable. Beyond animation, Carell has left his mark on cinema with roles in films such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Crazy Stupid Love, and Beautiful Boy. We can't forget Carell's acclaimed portrayal of the eccentric boss, Michael Scott, in The Office.\n\nMiranda Cosgrove as Margo\n\nMiranda Cosgrove, the web star of our childhoods, returns to the franchise! The actress and singer started her career very young with roles on some of our favorite childhood shows like Drake and Josh, where she played Drake's evil little sister. Her most famous came soon after as internet icon Carly Shay in iCarly. Around that time she also had a role in the Jack Black and Mike White comedy School of Rock. Cosgrove brings warmth to her portrayal of Margo, Gru's eldest adopted daughter.\n\nWill Ferrell as Maxime Le Mal\n\nWill Ferrell's name should be added to the thesaurus with comedy icon next to it. With memorable performances in classics like Elf, Stepbrothers, and The Other Guys, the former Saturday Night Live alum never fails to make us laugh. In Despicable Me 4, he joins the cast as Maxime Le Mal, one of Gru's former nemeses.\n\nKristen Wiig as Lucy\n\nKristen Wiig revisits her role as Lucy, Gru's supervillain wife. Wiig's comedic prowess, honed through her tenure on Saturday Night Live and roles in films like Bridesmaids, ensures a memorable performance of this beloved character.\n\nSofia Vergara as Valentina\n\nWho better the femme fatale girlfriend of a supervillain, Maxime Le Mal (Will Ferrell), than Sofia Vergara! The Colombian American actress and TV personality injects her signature charm and humor into every character she takes on. Best known for her role as Gloria in the sitcom Modern Family and her current stint as a judge on America's Got Talent, Vergara will leave her mark as Valentina on the Despicable Me universe.\n\nDespicable Me 4 hits theaters on July 3."
