        "text": "If you're wondering how Sofía Vergara can afford living her ~dolce vita lifestyle~ on ~endless summer vacation~ in Italy, the answer is simple: She's rich. Sofía earned the bulk of her income from starring in one of the most successful sitcoms ever, but she's also a financially savvy genius who has the bank account to prove it. Time for a closer look at Sofía's net worth—including how its been impacted by her impending divorce from Joe Manganiello.\n\nSofía's Modern Family Salary Took Some Negotiating...but Eventually Became Ginormous\n\nModern Family aired for 11 seasons, and it's not an exaggeration to say the show made the entire cast millionaires. But Sofía's high salary didn't come easy.\n\nShe and her co-stars—specifically Julie Bowen, Ty Burrell, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, and Eric Stonestreet—got major raises going into the show's fourth season, but their contract negotiations were messy. Like, involved a lawsuit-levels of messy. But eventually, Deadline reported that ABC agreed to pay them between $170,000-180,000 per episode, up from the $65,000 per episode they were making in season 3. (Side note: their seasons 1-2 salaries were lower, with reports ranging from $30,000 to $60,000 per episode).\n\n^ Me to the money I spend.\n\nAnother bonus to come from those season 4 contract negotiations? Sofía and her cast-mates were guaranteed year-to-year increases and back-end deals. They ended up earning a reported $350,000 per episode for season 8, which was raised to $500,000 per episode in season 9—a deal that carried them through season 11.\n\nSo, how much was Sofía making per season at her peak? I mean, season 9 was 22 episodes so...$11 million? I scream.\n\nLet's Not Forget About America's Got Talent\n\nThese days, Sofía is a judge on America's Got Talent, a gig that Forbes reports earned her $10 million (just a fraction of the $43 million she earned in 2020, FYI).\n\nShe Has a Line of Walmart Jeans\n\nAnd it. Is. Profitable. As Forbes put it: \"Her line of jeans at Walmart has sold enough jeans to be four times taller than the Eiffel Tower.\"\n\nOn top of her deal with Walmart, Sofía has collaborated with the likes of Kmart (she got a reported $7 million for that deal) and has done endorsements for brands like Cover Girl, Diet Pepsi, Burger King, Comcast, and State Farm—which has earned her tens of millions. She also earns income from a collection of perfumes, a line of furniture with Furniture Rooms Go, and her beauty line Toty.\n\nLooking for some detail$? Celebrity Net Worth reports Sofía earned $3.5 million from Cover Girl, Diet Pepsi, and State Farm; $2.5 million from Comcast Xfinity; $3 million from Rooms to Go; $6 million from Synthroid; $4 million from Head & Shoulders; and $2.75 million from AT&T.\n\nCEO of Latin World Entertainment (which Sofía co-founded), Luis Balaguer, spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about Sofía's business acumen, saying, “She always knew exactly what she wanted. Early on, Sofía realized the potential beyond her salary as an actress and television host. That led to the calendar she did in 1995—I was able to get a printer to produce 100,000 of them and give them to me on consignment; we ended up selling roughly 2 million.”\n\nA Moment for Her and Joe Manganiello's Prenup\n\nAccording to People, Joe and Sofía did have a prenup, and Sofía has asked for it to be upheld in divorce docs. She also asked to keep assets including jewelry, artwork and “other personal effects.”\n\nMeanwhile, the former couple has listed their shared home for $15.95 million.\n\nSo What Is Sofía Vergara's Net Worth?\n\nA casual $180 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth! As we've already established from these 😭-inducing numbers, Sofía's wealth comes from a combination of TV work, brand deals, and endorsements (the holy trifecta), and she's had some majorly high earning years.\n\nIf you need me, I'll be weeping."
