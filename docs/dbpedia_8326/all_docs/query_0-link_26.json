        "text": "Though she was hugely successful portraying Gloria Delgado-Pritchett in ABC’s laugh-out-loud hit series Modern Family, Sofía Vergara had her heart set on one day taking on the role of the ruthless Colombian drug lord Griselda Blanco Restrepo.\n\nIt would be more than 15 years before Vergara would have the chance to prove she has serious acting chops. She is dynamic in the six-episode Netflix limited series Griselda and it’s hard to believe this is her first-ever dramatic acting role.\n\nGriselda is executive produced and created by Narcos and Narcos: Mexico showrunner Eric Newman. He co-created the series alongside Doug Miro, Ingrid Escajeda, and Carlo Bernard. Andrés Baiz directed all six episodes.\n\nThe streamer describes Griselda as a dramatization inspired by Blanco. The fictionalized story covers her life in Miami’s underworld in the 1970s and ‘80s when she climbed to the top of the male-dominated drug-dealing industry.\n\nIn a recent interview, Vergara talked about first learning about Blanco in 2006 while watching a documentary. She was still in the early days of her Modern Family fame. The show was such a hit that the network continued to renew it, and the comedy aired from 2009 to 2020. Though she was well regarded for her humor, Vergara is tenacious and she was determined to someday take on the dramatic acting challenge.\n\nShe described watching that documentary and connecting to Blanco for personal reasons. “I grew up in the seventies, eighties, and nineties, which was the time in Colombia when the narco traffic was booming. I was there. I was part of it. My brother was part of it. My brother was killed in the nineties,” she said, looking away briefly, reliving that loss. “Then I heard a woman's name and I thought it was an exaggeration. We had never heard of a woman being a part of this.”\n\nAt the time, however, Vergara was pigeonholed into the comedy category, and she was extremely successful with numerous awards nominations and an ensuing pay raise that catapulted her to the top of Hollywood’s elite A-List. Despite her success, she yearned to stretch her acting muscles.\n\nA few years passed, and Blanco’s story again caught Vergara’s attention when she read about her in a magazine article while on a flight. She tore the pages out and held onto that article, reading it several times. At this point, she began researching Blanco by sifting through public records and speaking to people who knew her. She discovered that Blanco was as vicious as she’d heard and was fascinated.\n\nVergara told me she had to find a way to understand Blanco in order to play this part. “I was very curious about how you become like that as a woman.” She also realized she could relate to Blanco in some ways.\n\n“I am Colombian like her. I am a mother like her...an immigrant. I would do anything for my family. So, there were many things that at the beginning I could understand. I started to empathize with her, but I had to stop myself and say, ‘Wait, don’t forget this woman became a monster.’ So, there were things that I admired her for…things she did by herself while raising four kids. She had no education, she ran away from abuse, from a horrible childhood. I mean, you have to give it to her in that era. Today, in 2024, women still have problems and you know, it was impossible then. This business was only for men. So, to know these things made me very interested in her. But I knew that we couldn’t romanticize her or make her a hero because she wasn’t. In the end, Griselda Blanco ended up doing horrible things and hurting her family, her kids, and everything that was around her.”\n\nBlanco was a cunning businesswoman who was accused of doing deplorable things. She was feared until her assassination on Sept. 3, 2012, at the age of 69.\n\nHer enemies didn’t live long after crossing her. She allegedly had hundreds of people killed during her time as a drug lord. She picked up a few nicknames: “The Cocaine Godmother” and “The Black Widow.”\n\nAs for the latter, Blanco married three times, and it’s believed she murdered or ordered the killings of all three husbands. She married for the first time when she was a teenager and split with her last husband in 1983. Reportedly, it was her second husband, Alberto Bravo, who initially brought her into the world of cocaine.\n\nAlso a savvy businesswoman, Vergara knew she had to team up with the right people to tell this story. She thought of Newman. Sitting beside Vergara, he talked about their first meeting nearly a decade ago at her house.\n\nIn 2015, he met with Vergara and her longtime manager and producing partner Luis Balaguer, who had called Newman to say that Vergara wanted to collaborate on Blanco’s story. Both had highly successful television series at the time.\n\n“I left that first meeting believing that not only could she do it, but that she had to do it,” Newman said. “She was driven to do it. That’s always the best place to start when someone is going to take a creative risk like that because, of course, it is a risk. When you’re known for one thing and you dare to do something different, there is always a risk that it’s not going to work.”\n\nIn addition to tackling drama in lieu of comedy, Vergara had to get the look just right. She spent three-plus hours getting ready each day of filming. Makeup department head Angela Nogaro and her team had their work cut out for them. They were tasked with making the gorgeous Vergara look less attractive, which is no easy feat. They used facial prosthetics, wigs, and makeup to get her camera-ready and into character.\n\nFake teeth were a part of the routine, which Vergara said was one of the hardest things to get used to. She decided to embrace the challenge. “I realized this is the way Griselda is going to talk and move her mouth, which is different from me. So, it was a million things: The hair, the nose, the eyebrows. I had to wrap my body so I wouldn’t look exactly like me or Gloria Pritchett, my character from Modern Family that everybody saw for 11 years. I was trying to disappear and become this woman. It was a lot of work. It was uncomfortable, but it was worth it. I would go to the set every day tired but excited.”\n\nNewman listed great comedic actors who have transitioned to drama: Tom Hanks, Robin Williams, Bradley Cooper, Sean Penn, and Emma Stone. “Comedy is so hard and people who are great at it like Sofía make it look easy. I was thrilled that she chose me and I was honored to be a part of this amazing transformation that’s going to blow people away. I never had one split second of doubt that she could do it.”\n\n“I did!” she laughed. When asked about the trajectory of her career moving forward, Vergara says she is open. “I try not to plan too much ahead. I kind of like to play it by ear.”\n\nShe adds that she wasn’t trying to reinvent herself or her career by taking on Blanco and that she picks characters that interest her. “If something funny comes along, I would do it.”"
