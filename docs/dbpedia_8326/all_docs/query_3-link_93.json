        "text": "Modern Family has ceased to air for over a year but has carved a niche in everyone’s heart. This mockumentary sit-com can be watched over and over again, featuring characters with phenomenal story arcs. All characters are well-developed individually with an on-point casting. While it is difficult to choose just one interesting character, the most amusing is probably Gloria Delgado-Pritchett, played by actress and model Sofia Vergara.\n\nGloria the loud, bold, and fierce wife of Jay Pritchett (Ed O’Neill) a pinch of craziness to the show while being a loving wife and mother to Manny Delgado (Rico Rodriguez). To commemorate Sofia Vergara's birthday today, here is a compilation of the most humorous moments this Latin beauty has delivered.\n\nHer reaction before her American citizenship test\n\nGloria pursues her American citizenship at Jay’s insistence, but when she realizes that Jay wants her to get the citizenship only to avoid long lines at customs during their vacations, she starts behaving like a typical American cliché to teach him a lesson. She dons an ‘all American’ dress and mimics being the perfect American wife. She wears shorts bearing stars and stripes, a vest with the bald eagle on it, an artificial Texas twang and even cooks steak for Jay. We love it when Gloria and Jay have this humorous conversation with each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere she teaches Manny to face his fear\n\nGloria and Manny's mother-son bond may cross boundaries sometimes but it is extremely sweet to watch. Although Gloria can be overprotective, she often helps Manny conquer his fears, showing how much she is willing to do for him. In season one, Manny is invited to a birthday party at an adventure park but refuses to go because he is afraid of the roller coasters. To help Manny overcome his fear, Gloria tricks him into thinking they are going fishing, only to take him to the theme park. Despite Manny being afraid of the roller coaster all day, Gloria doesn't give up on him. In the end, she persuades him to get on the ride, proving her dedication and commitment to helping him overcome his fears.\n\nWhen she defends Haley against her boss\n\nHaley Dunphy, portrayed by Sarah Hyland, works for a fashion company, and her painful boss makes her run personal errands and chores. One day, Gloria follows Haley to her office and is shocked at how she is treated. Gloria brings out her Columbian side and threatens Haley's boss to treat her with respect. This scene is, of course, funny, but it also emphasizes how much Gloria loves and protects the children in the house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nALSO READ: The Family Business Season 5 Episode 4: Release Date, Where To Watch, Expected Plot & More\n\nWhen she attempts to find out who stole her cutout\n\nIn season 7, Gloria starts a new job by launching her sauce business based on a family recipe, packaged in jars. To promote her business, she places a cardboard cutout of herself with an inflatable hand that blows kisses to customers in the corner of the store. This advertisement becomes popular, especially among male customers, which makes Jay envious. He removes the cutout, and Gloria assumes her enemy, Auntie Alice, who also has a sause business, stole it. Gloria then plots to get back at Auntie Alice, which concerns Jay greatly. In the end, Jay bolts and comes clean, confessing to having taken the cutout.\n\nWhen she teaches Jay a lesson\n\nGloria was forced to cancel a program due to the death of her grandmother in Season 2. After her grandmother’s burial, she decides to prepare traditional Colombian recipes. Jay initially teases her for adhering to the mourning traditions of her culture, as many do in the United States. He then becomes insensitive to her feelings and later regrets his actions. To make amends, he helps her prepare the meal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWanting to teach Jay a lesson in a playful manner, Gloria initiates him into fake traditions, including a loud slap on the meat. This scene not only adds comedy to their interactions but also showcases how Gloria started to defend herself and her Columbian background."
