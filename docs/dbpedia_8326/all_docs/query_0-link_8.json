        "text": "Ed O'Neill is an American actor best known for playing Al Bundy on Eine schrecklich nette Familie (1987), the most iconic working class character on television since Archie Bunker. Upon his debut on the world stage in Youngstown, Ohio on April 12, 1946, he was christened Edward Philip O'Neill, Jr. Both his father, Ed, Sr., a steelworker and truck driver, and his social worker mother, the former Ruth Ann Quinlan, were Irish-Americans.\n\nA gifted athlete, the 6'1\" O'Neill attended Ohio University on a football scholarship, but transferred after his sophomore year to Youngstown State University, where he played as a defensive lineman. In 1969, he was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers, but was cut in training camp. (Al Bundy was a former high-school football star constantly reminiscing about his glory days on the high school gridiron. Terry Bradshaw, the Hall of Fame Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, twice appeared on \"Married with Children\".)\n\nAfter being cut by the Steelers, O'Neill went back to YSU to join the new theater department. After graduating, he became a social studies teacher at his alma mater, Ursuline High School, before fully committing to acting. He was a member of the company at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts, one of the top regional theaters in America.\n\nAfter numerous supporting parts in movies and television, he was cast as the New York City detective Popeye Doyle in the 1986 television movie that was a pilot for a proposed television series. \"Popeye Doyle\" was based on the classic police drama French Connection - Brennpunkt Brooklyn (1971), with O'Neill playing the role originated by Gene Hackman). The television movie and O'Neill's performance got good reviews, but it was not picked up as a series.\n\nA year later, O'Neill was cast as Al Bundy in the sitcom \"Married with Children\", which debuted on the then-new Fox Network in April 1987. It ran 10 years, until June 1997, and made O'Neill a star.\n\nDuring the production of \"Married with Children\" and after its cancellation, O'Neill appeared in movies, guested on television shows, and made television commercials. The second iconic fictional policeman role that O'Neill took over was Sgt. Joe Friday in his 2003 remake of Jack Webb's classic crime series Polizeibericht Los Angeles (2003), which appeared on ABC. The network canceled the show during its second season. Since 2009, O'Neill has played Jay Pritchett on the ABC's sitcom Modern Family (2009), for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2011.\n\nSince 1986, O'Neill has been married to actress Catherine Rusoff. They have two daughters, Claire and Sophia.\n\nTyler Gerald Burrell was born on August 22, 1967 in Grants Pass, Oregon, where his family owned a business. He is the son of Sheri Rose (Hauck), a teacher, and Gary Gerald Burrell, a family therapist, and is primarily of English and German ancestry. He earned a BA from Southern Oregon University and attended The University of Oregon while working as a bartender; he finished his education at Penn State where he got an MFA.\n\nIn his early career, Burrell appeared in the films Black Hawk Down (2001) and Dawn of the Dead (2004). He also appeared in a Broadway production of \"Macbeth\".\n\nAfter a few appearances on Law & Order (1990) Burrell starred in the comedy sitcoms Out of practice - Doktor, single sucht... (2005) and Back to You (2007), costarring Patricia Heaton and Kelsey Grammer. He also made film appearances in Der unglaubliche Hulk (2008) and Das Verm√§chtnis des geheimen Buches (2007).\n\nIn 2009, Christopher Lloyd gave him the part of Phil Dunphy on the smash hit television series Modern Family (2009), which has gotten rave reviews, Emmys, and the #1 spot on television several times. Burrell has gotten five Emmy nominations and two wins for the popular role.\n\nBurrell's recent films roles include Die Abenteuer von Mr. Peabody & Sherman (2014), Die Muppets 2: Muppets Most Wanted (2014), Findet Dorie (2016), and Girls' Night Out (2017).\n\nSarah Hyland was born in New York City to actors Melissa D. Canaday and Edward James Hyland. She began in the business at the age of 4 with commercial work and voice overs. Her first film was Private Parts (1997). She then moved on to Liebe in jeder Beziehung (1998) and then spent time on Another World (1964) as \"Rain Wolfe\", a child found in the park, and fostered by Josie and Gary.

Aside from all of her film and television work, Sarah studied voice, ballet, jazz, hip-hop, tap, Theatre Dance, and performed with her tap and Theatre dance class at \"Reel to Real\" at Lincoln Center as invited performers.\n\nA New York-born and raised girl, Sarah spent much of her time working in film, television, and voicing many radio ads, as well as traveling with her father, Edward James Hyland, while he worked at many different theaters in the country. She was home schooled by her mother until 2nd grade and then attended Public School. In 6th Grade, she was accepted into PPAS (Professional Performing Arts School) where she stayed until she graduated in 2008. When Sarah turned 18, she moved to Los Angeles, CA and, within two weeks, had landed a pilot named \"My American Family\". Once picked up the name was changed to Modern Family (2009). To date, Sarah portrays \"Haley Dunphy\", the eldest Dunphy child.

Her second turn on Hothouse (2009) gave her a breakthrough role where she portrayed \"Jennifer Banks\", a student at a school for the gifted who kills her roommate in a drug fueled rage.\n\nHer work on Lipstick Jungle (2008) as Brooke Shields's daughter further showcased her talent and, because of LJ's cancellation, drew her to Los Angeles and the role of \"Haley Dunphy\" on Modern Family (2009).\n\nSarah has a maltipoo named Barkley, and is happily living in the Los Angeles Area.
