        "text": "While enjoying family vacations, making career changes, and welcoming the next generation into the family, the characters of Modern Family kept audiences laughing for eleven seasons. From the series premiere in 2009 to the finale in 2020, the cast aged right along with the Pritchett and Dunphy clan. For over a decade, we loved spending time with these hilarious family members.\n\nHow old is the cast of Modern Family? Ed O'Neill was 62 when he first took on the role of Jay Pritchett. He has played the character throughout all eleven seasons. Sarah Hyland was 18 when she first played Claire and Phil's then-teenage daughter, Haley Dunphy, during season one of Modern Family. Haley is a mother herself in the eleventh and final season of the show though she still looks as youthful as ever.\n\nJesse Tyler Ferguson, who plays Mitchell Pritchett, was 33 when Modern Family premiered and Nolan Gould played Luke Dunphy from the time he was 10 until he was 21.\n\nWhich cast members from Modern Family do you think changed the most during the show's eleven-season run? Take a look at these Modern Family cast photos and vote up the actors who changed the most."
