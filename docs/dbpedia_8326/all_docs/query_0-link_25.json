        "text": "The \"Modern Family\" Cast Had A Reunion Last Night, And They Honestly Seem Like A Real Family\n\nI know it's only been three years, but this is making me emotional...\n\nIt's been over three years since Modern Family ended back in April 2020, but the cast is still super close and hang out with each other all the time.\n\nBut apparently, the very large cast hasn't had a full-on Modern Family reunion party together — until now. The whole main cast (with the exception of Dunphy patriarch Ty Burrell and Jeremy Maguire, who played Joe) and show creators Steve Levitan and Chris Lloyd reunited last night at Sofía Vergara's house for their \"first reunion,\" and honestly, the whole thing is making me emotional.\n\nThe stars shared soooo many fun pics from the night, and honestly, it just seemed like it could be a very special and epic episode of the show.\n\nIt really looked like a blast!\n\nEach of the mini families even posed for pics together, and truly, where does the time go?! Here's Gloria, Manny, and Jay on the show in Season 1:\n\nAnd here's Rico Rodriguez, Sofía, and Ed O'Neill now:\n\nJay and Gloria back together again is so sweet:\n\nHere's Phil, Claire, Haley, Alex, and Luke on the show in Season 1:\n\nAnd here's Ariel Winter, Sarah Hyland, Nolan Gould, and Julie Bowen now:\n\nAnd here's Mitch, Cam, and Lily in Season 3 on the show:\n\nAnd here's Eric Stonestreet, Aubrey Anderson-Emmons, and Jesse Tyler Ferguson now:\n\nAnd here's Jay and his kids just for fun:\n\nWhile Ty Burrell wasn't able to make it, he was honored with a framed photo of himself in attendance instead:\n\nThe cast even took a moment to give a shoutout to their costar in a cute video where everyone said they missed him and Sarah even shouted, \"I love you, Dad!\"\n\nHonestly, there really should have been a solution for that:\n\nAnyway, you can catch me watching Modern Family reruns again until the next one!\n\nShare This Article"
