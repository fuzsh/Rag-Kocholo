        "text": "The actress welcomed son Manolo at 19 years old with high school sweetheart Joe Gonzalez, though they split two years later\n\nSofia Vergara played a mom on Modern Family that was not far off from her real-life experience as a mom to son Manolo.\n\nAs guests on The Talk on June 1, the Griselda star, 51, and Manolo, 32, reveal that the Modern Family character “Manny” was inspired by their own mother-son dynamic.\n\n“When I arrived to meet with the creators Chris Lloyd and Steve Levitan they had in mind another, you know, ethnic woman, but they didn’t know who,” Vergara explains. “And when they met me and I started telling them my story how Manolo was a very old soul. He would be, like, even more mature than I was. I mean, he’d do all kind of, like, weird things.”\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nRelated: All About Sofía Vergara's Son Manolo Gonzalez Vergara\n\nManolo interjects, saying, “There are some character traits of Manny that are mine. Like I was the kid drinking espressos or oiling the salad bowl, you know, made of wood.”\n\n“We would be crossing the street and at like 4 years old he’s like, ‘Mom, hold my hand. This is dangerous,' ” Vergara adds.\n\n“I’m responsible!” Manolo jokes.\n\nThe Modern Family star welcomed Manolo Colombia in 1991. At the time, Vergara was 19 years old and married to her high school sweetheart Joe Gonzalez, though they split two years later.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it?

She even knows what she wants to be called.\n\n\"Abuela,\" she told PEOPLE in the May 3 cover story. \"I think I'll be a fun grandmother.\"\n\nAnd she's already getting some practice by dog-sitting for her son.\n\n\"On the weekends, he just drops his dog at my house,\" Vergara explains. \"And I used to drop him at my mom’s house during the weekend so that I could at least go out every once in a while.\"\n\nVergara now appreciates how close they are now. \"It is great that I had him young because now I’m going to be 52 and he’s 32,\" she says. \"I wish I was older sometimes because I would’ve been more mature, more prepared to be a mother, but that was what I got and what happened. But it is fun because I kind of grew up together with my son.\"\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
