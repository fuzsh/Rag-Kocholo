        "text": "Gloria María Ramírez Pritchett (formerly Delgado; née Ramírez Jiménez) is the feisty, fun-loving Colombian daughter of Pilar Jiménez Morales and Fulgencio Ramírez, wife of Jay Pritchett, and the mother of Manny Delgado and Joe Pritchett. She becomes an American citizen in \"Patriot Games\". She was formerly a hairdresser, a taxi driver, a spokesmodel, a mover, a philosophy professor, a stay-at-home mom and a housewife, but is currently a realtor.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nGloria was born in Colombia to Pilar Jiménez Morales and Fulgencio Ramírez. She has many siblings, including a younger sister Sonia and two unnamed brothers. Having lived in a poor village, she is evidently used to doing manual labor and frequently implies violence as a solution to problems. She states that she had her own machete when she was young (\"Fizbo\"), and has considerable comfort in murdering animals due to relatives who are butchers (\"Unplugged\"). Crazily traditional, Gloria firmly believes in superstitions and that her family is cursed because her great-great-grandfather made a deal with the devil, causing many of her relatives to end up in jail (\"Larry's Wife\"). Gloria also frequently mentions that she used to join (and win) beauty pageants where she showcased her ventriloquist dummy Uncle Grumpy, later seen to be strikingly similar to Jay (\"Yard Sale\"). Though frequently complimented for her beauty, Gloria was also very jealous of Sonia, who their father got on better with, and it appears that Gloria resented her sister for this (“A Tale of Three Cities”).\n\nWhen she was younger, she received a letter addressed to her sister Sonia with an opportunity to leave for the US. She used the letter and ends up leaving instead of her sister. This would later cause friction between the two (\"Fulgencio\"). Jay mentions that she had been deported twice (\"Open House of Horrors\").\n\nShe also stayed in Texas and Florida for some time, both of which she became wanted by the police. Until the events in \"Goodnight Gracie\", she was wanted in Florida for subletting an apartment which her roommate turned into a brothel after she left. It is also in Florida where she gave birth to Manny in 1999.\n\nShe used to be a cab driver and a hairdresser at a salon near her apartment in the slums. She was also formerly a spokesmodel, mover and a philosophy professor. (I'm Going To Miss This)\n\nJay said he used to sweat a lot while visiting her apartment, having to climb three flights of stairs. (\"Two Monkeys and a Panda\")\n\nGloria met her husband Jay at a diner while she was with Sonia. Jay (who could only see Sonia as Gloria's back is turned to him) sent a pie over to Sonia but she missed it as she went to the bathroom. Gloria later comes over to thank Jay thinking it was for her (\"Fulgencio\").\n\nPersonality[]\n\nGloria is often characterized by her loud, outspoken attitude noticeable even from a distance that one neighbor once thought that they owned a parrot (\"Unplugged\"); her voice is known for driving the next-door neighbor's dog mad, setting off car alarms and scaring several drivers into pulling over because it reached a pitch akin to a police or ambulance siren.\n\nShe is shown to be very expressive in her speech; often imitating the sounds of things when she does not know what to call it, and shouting loudly when she is upset. Due to her fiery nature, she often clashes with Claire, another strong female. She often feels that her race is a problem with people, such as failing to hail a cab which she immediately blames on her being a Latina only for Haley to point out that its just a yellow car.\n\nShe also has a considerable temper which is comparable to a volcano: sudden, destructive and with many casualties. When two teens egged her house on Halloween, she charged after them screaming \"You put egg on my house, I kill what you love!\". When angered or frustrated, she has a tendency to rant vociferously in Spanish.\n\nShe is shown to enjoy the limelight, as she makes effort to be noticeable especially when it comes to her appearance and tends to get jealous when other women get more attention than her, as seen when she fires attractive female babysitters from her house so they don't outrank her (\"The Help\"). Gloria also states that all friends of Jay have hit on her, except Shorty (\"Fifteen Percent\"). She frequently uses her good looks and sexy features to her advantage, which is why she becomes frustrated when she tries to help Claire's campaign for office using the telephone, as people do not see her and respond as she wants (\"Election Day\").\n\nShe is shown to be very proud of her Colombian roots and insists on carrying on several of her Colombian traditions with her new family, and encourages Manny to learn more Spanish (\"Queer Eyes, Full Hearts\"). A devout Catholic, Gloria is shown to value strong family ties and religion above all else. Jay says that Gloria likes to celebrate even little events he would consider insignificant (\"Two Monkeys and a Panda\"). She has a disturbingly high comfort level when it comes to killing or violence, especially where animals are concerned; she brutally beheaded a rat with a shovel and left its head to \"send a message to the other rats\", and then set off for church (\"Unplugged\").\n\nSeason Summaries[]\n\nSeason 1\n\nSeason 1 Gloria struggles to fit in her new family and prove to them that she isn't a superficial gold-digger Season 2 None Assigned yet (Please write a Season 2 summary here for Gloria).

In one instance, she used her skills to give Phil a haircut at his home.\n\nMover[]\n\nFormerly\n\nGloria has mentioned that she used to be a mover.\n\nPhilosophy Professor[]\n\nFormerly\n\nGloria has mentioned to Mitchell that she used to be a Philosophy Professor.\n\nTaxi Driver[]\n\nFormerly\n\nGloria used to drive a taxi at night, often with Manny sleeping in the seat beside her. One time she had to hit the breaks so hard that Manny fell down on to the floor and found a penny.\n\nStay-at-Home Mom/Housewife[]\n\nFormerly\n\nShe looked after the house and her kids; Manny and Joe.\n\nReal estate agent intern[]\n\nFormerly\n\nShe used to work as an intern for Phil Dunphy before eventually partnering up with him.\n\nRealtor[]\n\nCurrently\n\nShe has a realtor partnership with Phil Dunphy.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nFamily[]\n\nClaire\n\nClaire is Gloria's step-daughter. Gloria started with a strained relationship with Claire. Which got gradually better, after the fight in \"Coal Digger\", They now completely trust each other although Claire can sometimes get jealous of her, in the late Season 3 and the early Season 4 it is shown in \"Bringing Up Baby\", that Claire is jealous of her figure, as when she and Jay find out that Gloria is pregnant with Joe, she is the first to say \"She's gonna get fat\", and when she is pregnant, in her late trimesters, Claire is the first to ask Jay how much weight she has gained, and then starts to state numbers that seem to be too much weight. She also gets to like Claire more when they go to the shooting gallery together.\n\nClaire started with a strained relationship with Gloria which is fully first shown when Luke gets into a fight with Manny. Gloria opens up that from the start she never felt welcomed by Claire into the family and Luke unknowingly states that Claire thinks Gloria is a \"coal digger\" (mishearing \"gold-digger\"). Gloria later states that she won't forgive Claire, about the new information she hears, until she jumps in the backyard swimming pool fully-clothed to prove she is sorry. At first Claire says \"no\" but, then begins to go through with it, as she is standing beside the pool, she asks her stepmother whether she really wants her to do it and moans when she realises that Gloria actually wants her to jump in. Claire wants forgiveness and jumps in fully clothed. Everyone including Claire laughs and everyone else jumps in, in groups, accept for Haley. (\"Coal Digger\")\n\nClaire is shown to have a tendency to feel jealous and insecure towards Gloria. When they serve as co-presidents at a dance at Luke's and Manny's school, Claire says Gloria is stealing her only \"thing\" by always being the center of attention. (\"Dance Dance Revelation\")\n\nIt is revealed that Claire and Mitchell still occasionally laugh behind Gloria's back at her mispronunciations. Claire is annoyed that the two are actually becoming closer. Gloria states that she indeed likes Mitchell more, but is also willing get closer to Claire if given the chance. (\"After the Fire\")\n\nIt is shown that Claire is jealous of her figure, as when she and Jay find out that Gloria is pregnant with Joe, she is the first to say \"She's gonna get fat\", and when she is pregnant, in her late trimesters, Claire is the first to ask Jay how much weight she has gained, and then starts to state numbers that seem to be too much weight. (\"Bringing Up Baby\"). Immediately after Gloria gives birth to Joe, Claire lifts up Gloria's blanket to presumably look at her stomach, and remarked in a rather annoyed and disappointed tone that \"she was already skinny again.\"\n\nManny\n\nManny is Gloria's son with Javier.
