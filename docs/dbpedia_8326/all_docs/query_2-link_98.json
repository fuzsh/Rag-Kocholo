        "text": "Jordan Fisher recently reprised the role of Anthony in the hit Broadway revival of Sweeney Todd opposite Josh Groban and Annaleigh Ashford. Prior to that, he broke ground in the Broadway show Dear Evan Hansen as the first Evan of color to take over the role full-time. Jordan recurred for two seasons on CW’s “The Flash” as Bart Allen/Impulse. He was seen in the Netflix dance film Work It opposite Sabrina Carpenter, and appeared in the sequel to the wildly popular Netflix rom-com franchise To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before as John Ambrose. Jordan starred in and Executive Produced Ace Entertainment’s rom-com film Hello, Goodbye, and Everything in Between based on the YA novel by Jennifer E. Smith. He played Mark Cohen in FOX’s Rent Live and was the breakout star of the Grease Live telecast on FOX, where he sang and played guitar in the role of Doody opposite Carly Rae Jepsen and Julianne Hough. Other past credits include a recurring role on the hit MTV series “Teen Wolf.” He made his Broadway debut to rave reviews in Hamilton as John Laurens/Philip Hamilton. Soon after, Lin-Manuel Miranda asked him to sing the Moana anthem “You're Welcome” as a duet together for the animated feature soundtrack. Jordan was well known to young audiences as Dove Cameron’s love interest on the hit Disney Channel series “Liv and Maddie.” He spent two seasons on the ABC Family hit series “Secret Life of the American Teenager” as Jacob, the pushy surprise step-sibling from South Africa. He appeared in the Disney Channel original movie musical franchise Teen Beach Movie, which was named the second highest rated TV movie in cable history, as Seacat, the lovable, bucket hat-wearing, singing, dancing head of the surfer gang! He is an accomplished dancer and choreographer who won the 2018 mirror ball on “Dancing with the Stars” in their 25th season on ABC, and went on to host “Dancing with the Stars: Juniors” on ABC. He also hosted and performed at the 2017 Radio Disney Music Awards and was nominated for best new artist for his EP on Hollywood Records.\n\nStephanie Mills, the soulful songstress from Brooklyn, New York, has woven her mesmerizing voice into the fabric of American music, enchanting audiences for decades. At 7, she was baptized at Cornerstone Baptist Church, pastored by Dr. Sandy F. Ray. Mills discovered her passion for singing while performing at the Negro Ensemble Company, and at the tender age of 11, she entered the Amateur Night competition at The Apollo Theater—winning six weeks straight, landing a professional booking to open for The Isley Brothers. She later auditioned and procured her first Broadway chorus role in Maggie Flynn—with a nine-month run, segueing into a recording contract with Paramount Records. “I Knew It was Love” was her debut single that caught the ear of DJ Ken Harper on AM radio, who reached out for her to audition for the Broadway production of The Wiz—igniting a flame that would blaze brightly across stages worldwide.\n\nMills’ meteoric rise to prominence began at age 17, when she stepped into the iconic silver slippers of Dorothy. In a run that lasted nearly five years, her spellbinding performances earned her critical acclaim and introduced her extraordinary talent to the world stage. There, under Broadway’s bright lights, Mills’ journey as a professional singer and actress took flight. In 1979 her debut album What Cha Gonna Do with My Lovin’ opened the door to her recording success. In 1980, her second album Sweet Sensation showcased Mills’ unparalleled vocal prowess. The album’s standout tracks, including the Grammy-winning “Never Knew Love Like This Before,” solidified Mills’ status as a powerhouse in the realm of R&B and soul music, along with her American Music Award in 1982 for Favorite Female Artist. With a voice that effortlessly traverses the depths of emotion, Mills captured the hearts of millions with her platinum-selling albums and chart-topping singles. To continue honing her acting chops throughout her singing career, she also took to the road—starring in various touring productions—from Ragtime to David Talbert. In December 2015, airing on NBC, she returned to the cast of “The Wiz Live,” this time around as Aunt Em. In 2023, she starred in Lifetime Networks Pride: A Seven Deadly Sins Story as Birdie Moore.\n\nThroughout her illustrious career, Mills has received numerous accolades and awards. From heartfelt ballads to infectious dance anthems, her discography is a testament to her versatility and enduring appeal. In 2024, she continues to evolve as an artist, with an upcoming return to the Broadway stage, while staying true to her soulful roots—a recording deal with new music on the way, a new book on the horizon and exploring new territories on the touring scene.\n\nBeyond her professional achievements, Mills’ philanthropic efforts and advocacy work have left an indelible mark on society. She has lent her voice to numerous charitable causes, using her platform to amplify marginalized voices and promote social justice.\n\nAs she continues to captivate audiences with her timeless melodies and soul-stirring performances, Stephanie Mills remains a beacon of inspiration in the world of entertainment. Her legacy is not only one of musical excellence but also of resilience, passion, and unwavering dedication to her craft. To this credit, she was selected as the Black Girls Rock Lifetime Achievement Living Legend Award recipient for 2024, upon their triumphant return to TV. With each note she sings, Mills reaffirms her rightful place among the Icons of American music, leaving an indelible imprint on the hearts of all who have the privilege of listening.\n\nMaia Reficco is one to watch, as she continues to build a notable and diverse resume across film, television, music, and the stage.\n\nReficco stars as one of the leads, or “Liars,” in the HBO Max Original Series Pretty Little Liars: Original Sin, which returns for Season 2 this May under the new title Pretty Little Liars: Summer School. Helmed by Riverdale creator Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, the dark, coming-of-age, horror-tinged drama follows a brand-new set of Liars who find themselves tormented by an unknown Assailant. Reficco portrays ‘Noa,’ a striving, sardonic track star who’s working hard to get her life back to normal after a summer spent in juvenile detention.\n\nFollowing, Reficco stars alongside KJ Apa and Eric Dane in One Fast Move, the action-adventure film from writer-director Kelly Blatz for Amazon Prime Video. The story follows a dishonorably discharged soldier (Apa) who seeks out his estranged father (Dane) to help him pursue his dream of becoming a professional motorcycle racer. While training, he meets a small-town, aspiring singer (Reficco) who begins to break down the walls his father’s absence had built up. The film is set to release on August 8th.\n\nReficco most recently starred alongside Camila Mendes and Maya Hawke in the Netflix dark comedy feature Do Revenge, directed by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson. She recently wrapped production on A Cuban Girl's Guide to Tea and Tomorrow—a new film based on the New York Times bestselling novel by Laura Taylor Namey.\n\nReficco rose to fame in Latin America for her role as ‘Kally’ in the hit Nickelodeon series Kally’s Mashup, for which she earned several Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards. Since then, she’s been releasing original music via Sony Music Latin – her latest single is “Rápido y Furioso.” She has also starred in various stage productions including the Broadway Center Stage’s Next to Normal at the Kennedy Center and the Encores! Production of Evita at New York City Center.\n\nReficco resides in Bueno Aires, Argentina.\n\nYola is a six-time Grammy-nominated artist, songwriter, and actor who has achieved critical acclaim, breakout success, and has been proclaimed one of the most exciting and innovative artists in music today. NPR called her latest album, Stand For Myself (2021), the “best soul record of the past 20 years,” while Rolling Stone championed her as “one of contemporary pop’s greatest singers, who just so happens to also be one of its sharpest songwriters.”\n\nYola made her acting debut as the founder of rock and roll, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, in Baz Luhrmann’s musical drama, Elvis, and earned an NAACP Image Award nomination for Outstanding Breakthrough Performance in a Motion Picture. She made her awards show performance debut at the American Music Awards in November 2022, as their featured “Song of the Soul” performer. That same evening the Elvis movie soundtrack won the “Favorite Soundtrack” award. Yola is a member of The Recording Academy’s Black Music Collective, and to celebrate Yola’s impact and influence on music, her guitar was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s “Right Here, Right Now” exhibit.\n\nYola is currently working on a R&B/Soul project that will surely add another gem to her genre-fluid catalog."
