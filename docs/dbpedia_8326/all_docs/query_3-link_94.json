        "text": "As Hollywood enjoys the glitz and excitement of another awards season, one new Netflix series comes to mind as it’s sure to be on all of those best-of-the-best lists this time next year: Griselda.\n\nSofía Vergara, who also serves as executive producer, is so incredibly dynamic, completely morphing into the character, in her first-ever dramatic role as Colombian drug lord Griselda Blanco Restrepo, a cunning woman who created one of the most profitable cartels in history.\n\nNetflix describes the six-episode limited series, which premieres on Thursday, Jan. 25, as a dramatization inspired by Blanco. The fictionalized story covers her life in Miami’s underworld in the 1970s and ‘80s, when she climbed to the top of the male-dominated drug-dealing industry.\n\nBlanco picked up a few nicknames in her time. She was regarded as “The Cocaine Godmother” and “The Black Widow” for her ruthless, cunning dealings as she built her empire. Her enemies didn’t live long after crossing her.\n\nShe was one to take seriously until her assassination on Sept. 3, 2012, at the age of 69. Rumor has it that she was part of the Medellín Cartel.\n\nAs the story goes, Blanco was with her pregnant daughter-in-law the day she was killed. The two made a stop at the Cardiso butcher shop on the corner of 29th Street in Medellín, where they bought $150 worth of meat. When she left the store, a motorcycle-bound assassin shot her twice, immediately killing her.\n\nAs for the “Black Widow” nickname, Blanco married three times and it’s believed she murdered or ordered the killings of all three husbands. She married for the first time when she was a teenager and split with her last husband in 1983. Reportedly, it was her second husband, Alberto Bravo, who initially brought her into the world of cocaine.\n\nVergara gives a powerful performance, making it hard to believe that she has never before acted in a serious role. We know and love her from her hilarious performance as Gloria Delgado-Pritchett in the hit ABC sitcom Modern Family, which ran from 2009 to 2020.\n\nBorn and raised in Barranquilla, Colombia, it wasn’t easy for Vergara to make it in mainstream America. Her classic beauty made her a standout, but it was her raw talent that truly set her apart. Her portrayal of Gloria garnered her four nominations each for the Golden Globes and the Emmys, making her a star, and one of the highest-paid actresses at the time. She routinely made us laugh throughout the comedy series’ 250 episodes, which makes seeing her now in Griselda so astounding. In part, this is due to the three-plus hours she spent each day of filming getting ready.\n\nMake-up department head Angela Nogaro and her team had their work cut out for them. They were tasked with making the gorgeous Vergara look less attractive, which is no easy feat. They used facial prosthetics, wigs, and makeup to get her camera-ready and into character.\n\nThough these tools helped to create the needed look, Vergara’s impeccable performance confirms she was meant to inhabit this role. Vergara has proven she has a range far beyond comedy. She is a dramatic actress and of this, there is no doubt.\n\nThe series is executive produced and created by Narcos and Narcos: Mexico showrunner Eric Newman. He co-created Griselda alongside Doug Miro, Ingrid Escajeda, and Carlo Bernard. Andrés Baiz directed all six episodes.\n\nIn addition to Vergara, the series stars Alberto Guerra, Christian Tappan, Martín Rodríguez, Juliana Aidén Martinez, Vanessa Ferlito, and, making her on-screen debut, Carolina Giraldo (a.k.a Karol G).\n\nGriselda is a must-watch. Will Vergara get awards consideration next year? She certainly deserves it, but as we know, life is neither fair nor predictable. If this TV lover had a say, she’d have to make room on her mantle for a few golden statuettes."
