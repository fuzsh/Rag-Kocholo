        "text": "“America’s Got Talent” judge Sofia Vergara got extra-snippy with a TV interviewer who questioned her accent.\n\nVergara, the former “Modern Family” star who’s headlining the upcoming Netflix series “Griselda,” was on the Spanish-language talk show “El Hormiguero” when host Pablo Motos poked fun at her accent.\n\nMotos interrupted Vergara as she was talking about her 11 seasons on ABC’s “Modern Family.”\n\nHe mocked her accent, and then said, “How do you say modern family?”\n\nVergara, at first, seemed a bit taken aback, but responded in an unflappable retort.\n\n“I say it wrong?” she said. “Oh, because you speak better English than me? Ah.”\n\nMotos tried to change the discussion but, this time, Vergara interrupted him and clapped back.\n\n“How many Emmy nominations do you have in the United States?” she said. “How many times did they nominate you at the Golden Globes?”\n\nFor the record, Vergara garnered four Emmy nominations for “Modern Family” and four Golden Globe nominations.\n\nIn “Griselda,” a six-part series premiering Jan. 25 on Netflix, Vergara plays real-life drug lord Griselda Blanco, who created one of the most powerful cartels in history.\n\nThe Colombian-born Blanco was based in Miami in the 1970s and ’80s and was known as “the Godmother” for her ability to blend savagery and charm.\n\nBlanco’s exploits were highlighted in Billy Corben’s 2006 documentary “Cocaine Cowboys” and “Cocaine Cowboys 2” in 2008.\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones played Blanco in the 2018 Lifetime biopic “Cocaine Godmother.”\n\nVegara told ET that Blanco was “a complex person … There are so many nuances to explore in terms of who she was as a drug lord and, of course, as a woman, as a mother.”\n\n“She was someone who did whatever it took to protect her family.”\n\nVergara also said she changed her look to play Griselda to create some distance from her role as Gloria Delgado-Pritchett on “Modern Family,” which she played for the entirety of its run (2009-2020).\n\n“I wanted no one to think of my last role,” she told ET. “I wanted to get inside her head and really understand her mentality.”\n\n“Griselda” co-stars Alberto Guerra, Christian Tappan, Martin Rodriguez and Vanessa Ferlito — and includes a special appearance from Colombian star Karol G.\n\nVergara has been a judge on NBC’s “America’s Got Talent” for four seasons after joining the show in 2020."
