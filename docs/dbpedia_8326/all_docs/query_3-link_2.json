        "text": "Sofia Vergara has been highly criticized for her portrayal of Gloria on Modern Family, but now she's defending her character to the media.\n\nIn an interview with TIME, the actress denied that the role was a simple stereotype, saying, \"I play her the way I see my mom and aunt behave as Latin women.\"\n\nThe Colombian actress also said that she told the writers that Gloria's character as originally written was too \"Mexican.\" \"I went to the writers and said, 'We wouldn't do this, Colombians don't dress like that,'\" she said. \"I cannot blame the writers. You write what you know, and you cannot tell an American writer to write about some other culture and expect that it will be as natural as writing about an American person.\"\n\nVergara's character gets called out a lot as being another in a long line of Latinas being portrayed as hyper-sexualized, \"fiery sex kittens\" who are loud and yell a lot, and her defense comes on the recent heels of her now-infamous Emmys appearance, where she was heavily criticized for appearing on a rotating daiswhile the chairman of the Television Academy talked about the industry.\n\nIt's easy to say that Vergara does play up the stereotype too often and that it's harmful to Latinas everywhere: A recent study from the University of Southern California shows that Latinas are most likely to be nude on TV or in movies, and a 2012 study done by the National Hispanic Media Coalition and an independent polling firm, Latino Decisions, suggests that about 30 percent of the nation's non-Latino population buys firmly into the stereotypes they see on TV or in the news about the majority of Latinos being undocumented immigrants. According to the same study, half of non-Latinos say they think \"welfare recipient\" and \"less educated\" are \"apt terms to describe the nation's Hispanic population.\" (It's not all bad news though: 81 percent think Hispanics are hardworking.)\n\nBut it's not as simple as blaming Vergara and her character for this. It is not Vergara's job to provide good PR for Latinas worldwide. This is an idea that often plagues people of color: Mindy Kaling is often asked abouther choices not to hire more people of color on The Mindy Project, and Cristela Alonzo recently told Cosmopolitan.comthat she gets asked all the time how she plans on \"representing the Latino community\" in her new show Cristela, to which she says, \"I can't. I can tell you what my family's like, but I can't write every Latino family in the world.\" And she's right. There is no way to be able to accurately tell all Latinos' stories, because there's such a wide variety of experiences that fall under that umbrella term of \"being Latino.\" Complaining that Vergara allows herself to be treated like \"a piece of meat spinning around on a vertical pit\" or that her character is nothing more than a \"caricature\" misses the larger point: that she's an individual, and it's not her job or anyone's job to represent an entire group.\n\nWhat would be more productive? Getting more Latinos (and people of color and women in general) into positions in the film and TV industry where they can tell their different stories, so that we, as viewers, see that diversity, and it becomes more common â€” so that the weight of \"representing\" their communities doesn't fall solely on the shoulders of women like Sofia Vergara, Mindy Kaling, or Cristela Alonzo."
