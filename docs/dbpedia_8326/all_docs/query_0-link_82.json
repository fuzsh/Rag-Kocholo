        "text": "Life Outside of Modern Family\n\nI can imagine that all of the stars of Modern Family are slammed with working on this successful show, but they still find time to be a part of other things going on in the business.\n\nSofia Vergara, who plays Gloria on Modern Family, has recently received a lot of press for lending her voice to the movie Happy Feet 2. Vergara’s character is a a “South American, hot Latina penguin with an accent” which is right up her alley. She claimed in an interview that “she had to do no research to get into that character”. Here is the link to the interview : http://www.movies.ie/Interviews/Sofia_Vergara__Video_Interview_for_Happy_Feet_2\n\nVergara also recently was in the The Smurfs movie, and is going to also be starring in New Years Eve. Below is an interview of Vergara discussing The Smurfs movie.\n\nSofia Vergara also is going to be starring in The Three Stooges movie that is coming out in 2012. She will play a character named Lydia, where she will ” play a devious woman who pretends to be the wife of a dying man and tells the Stooges she’ll pay them a handsome sum if they kill the man in his sleep.”\n\nAnother member of the Modern Family cast that has been finding time to film some movie roles is Sarah Hyland. Hyland plays Haley Dunphy on Modern Family. Her imdb (internet movie database) shows that she will be in three movies set to come out in 2012. One of the movies is Gay Dude, which is described as “two guys who make a pact to lose their virginity before prom and find their friendship tested when one of them comes out of the closet.” Another movie she is set to star in is a movie called Struck By Lightning where she will play a character named Claire Matthews.
