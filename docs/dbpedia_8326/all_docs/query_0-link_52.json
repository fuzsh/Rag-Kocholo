        "text": "As a pop culturist who is interested in representations of race and gender in U.S. television and film, I feel it is my duty to analyze these images in all forms of media, no matter how bad or lacking in nuance the text is. I call this “hate-watching for research” and I’m usually very vocal with my friends and peers about recent awful films or TV shows I’ve forced myself to sit through for research. While I claim to dislike this aspect of my research, I secretly enjoy this guilty pleasure. It can be particularly cringe-worthy, and even painful, to watch images of Latinas in media, but as a Latina scholar, it is important for me to know what images of my ethnic group pervade our cultural narratives. One example of my experience hate-watching for research is my recent viewing of The Big Wedding (2013), a star-studded comedy, and a major misstep for Hollywood and its portrayal of Latinos.\n\nOther scholars have noted Hollywood’s Latino problem. In “The Latino Media Gap,” Frances Negrón-Muntaner discusses the disproportionate rate of participation and inclusion in media to the growing Latino population. Negrón-Muntaner states, “Latinos constitute one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States, comprising 17% of the population and over 20% of the key 18-34 marketing demographic” (1). He continues:\n\n[W]hereas the Latino population grew more than 43% from 2000 to 2010, the rate of media participation—behind and in front of camera, and across all genres and formats—stayed stagnant or grew only slightly, at times proportionally declining. Even further, when Latinos are visible, they tend to be portrayed through decades-old stereotypes as criminals, law enforcers, cheap labor, and hypersexualized beings. (1)\n\nThese negative images have real world effects: “[T]he limited and stereotypical nature of existing stories about Latinos skews the public’s perception of U.S. society. It also sanctions hostility toward the country’s largest minority” (2). While the article discusses several issues facing Latinos in media, this post (and my research in general) is interested in the representation of Latinas in U.S. media. According to Negrón-Muntaner, “69% of iconic media maids in film and television since 1996 are Latina” (2). And while Negrón-Muntaner notes that “overly sensual Latinas are a very small number of roles” (18) one of the most visible images of the “sexy spitfire” is Sofia Vergara’s character in Modern Family who is also “comically accustomed to violence” (17) as portrayed in several episodes.\n\nWhile the image of the hypersexual Latina may be on the decline, it still pops up in major Hollywood productions, as evidenced by the 2013 Lionsgate film, The Big Wedding (a remake of Mon Frère se Marie), which I had the pleasure of hate-watching over the summer. The film, which has a whopping 7% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 5.6 rating on IMDb, stars heavy hitters such as Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro, and Susan Sarandon.\n\nThe film follows a family preparing for their son’s wedding. Keaton and De Niro are the wealthy divorced parents of characters played by Katherine Heigl, Topher Grace, and Ben Barnes. Barnes plays their adopted son Alejandro, a multi-lingual Harvard graduate, who they adopted from Colombia and they found through an adoption video that resembles those pathos-filled late-night third world child sponsorship ads. Alejandro’s biological mother and sister are arriving from Colombia to attend his wedding and this creates the central conflict: According to Alejandro, it would break his biological mother’s heart to find out he was raised in a “heathen” family of divorce, so Keaton and De Niro’s characters agree to pretend they are still married for the duration of her visit. The traditional, Catholic Spanish-speaking mother Madonna (Patricia Rae) and the hypersexual bilingual sister Nuria (Ana Ayora) essentially embody dichotomized Latina stereotypes. Madonna is religious, portrayed as traditional to the point of being backwards, and unwavering in her beliefs because “she’s from another country, a different country, and her values aren’t the same as ours.” In one of Nuria’s first scenes, she strips and skinny dips in a lake in front of the family and wedding crew in an attempt to seduce Grace’s character, asking, “You will show me around […] and then you will make love to me also?” In the end, Madonna turns out to be more understanding than first feared by the family (including her son) and Nuria, after being lectured by Keaton’s character to tone down her sexuality (“American women are more reserved when it comes to their sexuality”), remains hypersexual, but only after her blatant sexuality is sanctioned by Grace’s character.\n\nThere is a lot to unpack in this film and what it tells us about Hollywood formulas and standards. Brian Gibson, film reviewer for Vue Weekly, called it a “blindingly bleached marriage of house-porn and cocky Caucasian privilege.” The film reveals our culture’s troubling perceptions of Latinos. Bilge Ebiri, film reviewer for Vulture.com, notes that the original was about “a Swiss family and their adopted Vietnamese son, and the central conflict there was not about religion but about the fact that the son had been writing to his biological mother for years telling her how perfect his life in the West was, hiding the insane dysfunction in his adopted home.” This means that for the U.S. remake, a conscious decision was made to change the adopted son’s ethnicity to Latino and to rehash outdated stereotypes of Latin Americans, Latinas, and generational and cultural clashes for comedic effect. As though they are aware of this potential critique, in the final spoken line, De Niro’s character (in voiceover) tells his new grandchild, “your grandmothers are all nuts.” In case viewers think the problem is Latinos, it’s not; it’s women.\n\nNeedless to say, there are a lot of problems in the film, and not just with the image of Latinas. The fact that these images were produced so unquestioningly tells us how normalized they still are in contemporary Hollywood and in U.S. culture in general; nevertheless, what this example may also tell us, is that the public is no longer interested in these tired tropes--the film barely recouped two-thirds of its $35 million budget, despite starring such box office draws. Film critics eviscerated it and reading the reviews was almost as fun as hate-watching the film. For research of course.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nWendy Braun received her PhD in 2012 from Louisiana State University in Comparative Literature with a minor in Women’s and Gender Studies.
