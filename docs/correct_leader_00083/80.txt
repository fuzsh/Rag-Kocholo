Tariq al-Hashimi (1942-) was Vice-President of Iraq from 22 April 2006 to 10 September 2012, succeeding Ghazi al-Yawer and Adil Abdul-Mahdi and preceding Nouri al-Maliki. On 15 December 2011, a warrant was issued for his arrest by Nouri al-Maliki after it was alleged that he led a hit squad that targeted Shia government officials, and he was sentenced to death in absentia while he was in exile in Turkey. His arrest warrant was issued the day after the end of the Iraq War, and hundreds of Sunnis like al-Hashimi were arrested without charge and detained for months; it went to show the complacency of al-Maliki's sectarian government after the United States withdrawal from Iraq.
