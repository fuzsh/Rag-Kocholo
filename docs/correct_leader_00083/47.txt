Taha al-Hashimi (Arabic: طه الهاشمى &lrm;) (1888–1961) served briefly as prime minister of Iraq for two months, from February 1, 1941, to April 1, 1941. He was appointed prime minister by the regent, 'Abd al-Ilah, following the first ouster of the pro-Axis government of Rashid Ali al-Kaylani during World War II. When Abdul-Illah fled the country, fearing an assassination attempt, Hashimi resigned, and the government reverted to Kaylani.
