        "text": "‘Abd al-Razzaq al-Hasani, Ta’rikh al-wizarat al-‘iraqiyya (Saida, 1953), part III, pp. 286–93.\n\nE. B. Main, ‘Iraq: a Note’, Journal of the Royal Central Asiatic Society, vol. 20, July 1933, p. 343. The Colonial Office in London, too, felt that in case of unification Faysal would probably transfer his crown completely from Iraq to Syria, as Damascus is ‘an infinitely pleasanter town than Baghdad’ and for other reasons.\n\nSee Khaldun Sati‘ al-Husry, ‘King Faysal I and Arab Unity 1930–33’, Journal of Contemporary History Vol.10, No.2, April 1975, pp. 330–1. See also pp. 323–4.\n\nAnd see Yehoshua Porath, ‘Nuri al-Sa‘id’s Arab Unity Programme’ MES vol. 20, no. 4, October 1984, p. 78.\n\nSee f.n. 3. And for ‘Abd al-Ilah’s designs on Syria in the late 1940s and early to mid-1950s see Reeva S. Simon, ‘The Hashemite “Conspiracy”: Hashemite Unity Attempts, 1921–1958’, IJMES, Vol.1 (1974), p. 318.\n\nFor example, ‘Aziz al-Sayyid Jasim, al-Muthaqqaf al-‘Arabi, July 1970, pp. 8–9; and Th, 10 June 1969;\n\nIlyas Farah, al-Tarbiya wal-siyasa (Beirut, 1975), p. 35, a speech in Mosul in June 1972;\n\nAhmad Hasan al-Bakr, Maslrat al-thawra fi khutab wa tasrihat al-ra’is (Baghdad, 1971), pp. 58–9; also 63, 95, 134–5, 203–8, 242; ‘Abd al-khaliq al-Samarra’i, Jum, 29 August 1970.\n\nSee, for example, an interview with Saddam Husayn, Iraq Today, March 1–15, 1979; Wa‘i al-‘Ummal, February 17, 1979.\n\nBernard Lewis, History Remembered, Recovered, Invented (Princeton, 1975), p. 11.\n\nReports in the Iraqi press reproduced in FBIS-Daily Report, 21 June 1989; The Independent (London), 30 August 1989; The Independent Magazine 14 October 1989. For academic studies see, for example, Su‘ad Ra’uf Shir Muhammad, Nuri al-Sa‘id wa dawruhu fi al-siyasa al-‘iraqiyya 1932–1945 (Baghdad, 1988);\n\n‘Abd al-Razzaq Ahmad al-Nasiri, Nuri al-Sa‘id … hatta ‘am 1932 (Baghdad, 1988).\n\nKhaldun Sati‘ al-Husri, ‘King Faysal I and Arab Unity 1930–33’, Journal of Contemporary History, vol. 10, no. 2, April, 1975, p. 327; based on al-Ikha al-Watani, 14 July 1932.\n\nKhaldun Sati‘ al-Husri (ed.), Mudhakkirat Taha al-Hashimi (Beirut, 1967), pp. 254–9.\n\nFor Leonard Wooley’s complaints and account of a decline in archeological digs see Brian M. Fagan, Return to Babylon (Boston, 1979), pp. 250, 276, 279; and see also pp. 248–9. And Sumer, no. 1, sixth year, 1950, p. 225.\n\nReeva S. Simon, ‘The teaching of History in Iraq Before the Rashid Ali Coup of 1941’, MES, Vol.22, No.1 (January 1986),p. 49\n\nSee for example Reeva Simon, ‘The Hashemite “Conspiracy”: Hashemite Unity Attempts, 1921–1958’, IJMES, vol. 5 (1974), pp. 318–21.\n\nThe Shahname was a mixture of myth and real history, leaving out altogether such major figures like Cyrus, Cambyses and Xerxes (Bernard Lewis, History, pp. 5, 40; Roy Mottahedeh, The Mantle of the Prophet [London, 1986], p. 311). Yet, even the fictitious kings and heroes it introduced, like the noble hero Rustam and the ingenious, inventor-king and tyrant Jamshid, were regarded as true historical figures, and became the subject of great popular interest and admiration. Thus, even though many aspects of this history were described in less than enthusiastic terms, in its entirety Iranian pre-Islamic history gained in Iran an essentially positive connotation. For example, medieval Muslim kings in Iran used to visit sites like Persepolis (commonly believed to have been built by Jamshid), and leave there inscriptions testifying to their respect for their pre-Islamic predecessors (Mottahedeh, pp. 313–14).\n\nSee Ernest Gellner, Thought and Change (London, 1972), pp. 155–64; Nations and Nationalism (Oxford, 1988), especially pp. 35–8, 57ff.\n\nFor the Iraqi letter to the Secretary General of the League see Ha-Aretz, 25 July, 1990. For the ubiquitous claim that Iraq is defending all the Arabs in its war against Iran see, for example, Saddam Husayn to al-Hawadith, 17 April 1981; al-Thawra al-‘Arabiyya, 1980, pp. 7, 18–20, 34; Ilyas Farah, Afaq ‘Arabiyya, November–December 1980, pp. 69–70; Shafiq al-Kamali, a poem, ibid., September 1979, pp. 10–11;\n\nTariq Aziz, The Iran-Iraq Conflict (London, 1981).\n\nIn some cases, like Egypt and Tunisia,this process started a few decades ago. For Egypt during the 1920s and 1930s see Israel Gershoni and James P. Jankowski, Egypt, Islam and the Arabs: The Search for Egyptian Nationhood, 1900–1930 (New York and Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1986), especially p. 164ff. On the level of political practice, too, local interests are being placed higher than before on the national scale of priorities by the various Arab regimes. In the case of Syria the reference is to the emergence of pan-Syrian notions and later to the alignment with Iran.\n\nFor other countries and organizations see Fouad Ajami, ‘The End of Pan-Arabism’ in Tawfic E. Farah (ed.), Pan Arabism and Arab Nationalism (Boulder and London, Westview, 1987), pp. 96–114. See there also a report on a poll carried out in Kuwait University and showing that the pan-Arab ideal no longer enjoys wide support. Another poll reported by Hassan Nafaa (‘Arab Nationalism: a Response’, ibid., p. 145), conducted in ten Arab countries, however, shows opposite results. These polls demonstrate the grave difficulties of conducting field studies that touch upon sensitive political issues in the contemporary Arab world."
