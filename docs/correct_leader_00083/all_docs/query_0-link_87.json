        "text": "U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Monday that he will be meeting this week with political and military leaders in Jordan, Israel and Egypt to help bolster the fragile Iraqi government. Discussions in each of the countries is likely to also focus on their military needs and what weapons and training they want from the United States, said one defense official. Gates also plans to urge countries such as Egypt and Israel to modernize their defense systems and \"transition from the post-Soviet dependency on conventional weaponry to something more ... related toward counterterrorism and the non-state actors that we are all working together against in the region.\"\n\nThe Mahdi Army, the military wing of al-Sadr's political organization, put down its weapons and went underground before the U.S.-Iraqi security crackdown began in Baghdad on Feb. 14 seeking to end sectarian killings and other violence.\n\nAlthough dozens of the militia's commanders were rounded in the clampdown, al-Sadr kept his militia from fighting back, apparently out of loyalty to al-Maliki, who was elected prime minister with al-Sadr's help.\n\nWith the political link severed, there are signs al-Sadr's pledge to control the militia might be broken as well. Forty-two victims of sectarian murders were found in Baghdad the past two days, after a dramatic fall in such killings in recent weeks. U.S. and Iraqi officials have blamed much sectarian bloodshed on Shiite deaths squads associated with the Mahdi Army.\n\nA week ago, on the fourth anniversary of Baghdad's fall to U.S. troops, al-Sadr sent tens of thousands of Iraqis into the streets in a peaceful demonstration in two Shiite holy cities. Protesters burned and ripped U.S. flags and demanded the Americans fix a date for leaving.\n\n\"I ask God to provide the Iraqi people with an independent government, far from (U.S.) occupation, that does all it can to serve the people,\" al-Sadr said in a statement on the Cabinet resignations.\n\nThe departure of al-Sadr's allies from the Cabinet did not affect the 30 seats held by his followers in Iraq's 275-member parliament.\n\n\"The withdrawal will affect the performance of the government, and will weaken it,\" said Abdul-Karim al-Ouneizi, a Shiite legislator allied with a branch of the Dawa Party-Iraq Organization, which is headed by al-Maliki.\n\nSaad Taha al-Hashimi, an al-Sadr ally who quit as Iraq's minister of state for provincial affairs, sought to reassure the cleric's supporters that their movement would remain influential.\n\n\"This does not mean the Sadrist movement will cease contributing to society,\" he told reporters. \"The movement, as it always has, will remain in society and the government to offer what is best and to push forward the political process.\"\n\nIn violence Monday, at least 13 Iraqi soldiers were killed and four were wounded when more than a dozen gunmen hiding in the back of a truck attacked a military checkpoint near Mosul, police said.\n\n\"When the driver approached the checkpoint and reduced speed, preparing to stop for a routine search, all of a sudden more than a dozen gunmen ambushed the checkpoint members and showered them with gunfire,\" said a security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of safety concerns.\n\nElsewhere in the city, gunmen killed Jaafar Hasan Sadiq, a professor at the University of Mosul's college of arts, as he was driving to work around 8:30 a.m. Five hours later, Talal Younis al-Jalili, dean of the university's college of political science, was slain as he drove home. Shortly after nightfall, gunmen killed the 17-year-old son of a Mosul policeman.\n\nThe brazen nature and the targets of the attacks are similar to previous assaults that blamed on al Qaeda in Iraq fighters, who are trying to break Iraqi military resolve and discourage secular activities such as university education.\n\nIn Basra, in the deep south of Iraq, about 3,000 protesters angry over inadequate city services marched peacefully through the streets of Iraq's second largest city to demand that the provincial governor resign.\n\nThe demonstrators gathered near the Basra mosque, then marched a few hundred yards to Gov. Mohammed al-Waili's office, which was surrounded by Iraqi soldiers and police officers. The protest ended a few hours later."
