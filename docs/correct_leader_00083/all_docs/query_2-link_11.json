A Pitj<U 'io\n\nMy Lord, ^ ^ ” Bagdad, May 20, 1940.\n\nTHE Cabinet formed by Rashid Ali at the beginning of April has now\n\nbeen in office for a little over six weeks, and it may be useful to review briefly\n\nits record and its present position.\n\n2. In internal affairs the Prime Minister has sought to bring a measure\n\nof appeasement into the political atmosphere. He quickly dissolved the military\n\ncourt set up in the Rashid (Hinaidi) Cantonment close to Bagdad by his prede\n\ncessor in May 1939, and obtained a Royal reprieve for Sabih Najib, who, in\n\npeculiar circumstances, had been sentenced by this court for a minor misdemeanour\n\nafter having been acquitted of a charge of being an accessory to the murder\n\nof the late Rustam Haidar, Minister of Finance. He is credited with a desire\n\nto release also Hikmat Sulaiman, another prominent Iraqi politician, who was\n\nconvicted and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for conspiracy against the\n\nState by the same court in March 1939. In this desire he is said to be supported\n\nby Naji Shaukat and Naji Suwaidi, but opposed by Nuri Said and Taha-al-\n\nHashimi, and stories are frequently heard of an impending split in the Cabinet\n\nover this dispute. Nevertheless, the Cabinet continues to present an apparently\n\nsolid front to the country, and much more is said by the gossips about the\n\ninternal differences in the Cabinet than by the Ministers themselves.\n\n3. Another story which is freely told by those who pretend to inside know\n\nledge of the Cabinet is that from the beginning there has been an understanding\n\nbetween Rashid Ali, the Suwaidis, and Jamil Madfai gradually to squeeze Nuri\n\nSaid out of the Government and to eliminate him from politics by sending him\n\nas Minister to London. If any attempt has, in fact, been made to give effect\n\nto such a plan. Nuri Said, with the support of Taha-al-Hashimi, has evently\n\nso far been able to resist it.\n\n4. On taking office the Prime Minister declared that the programme of\n\nhis Cabinet did not differ in any essentials from that of Nuri Said’s Cabinet,\n\nand during the short period that remained of the current session of Parliament\n\nhe was content to put through the legislation already prepared by the late Govern\n\nment, and his own Cabinet did not themselves introduce any important measures.\n\nSimilarly, in his personal talks with me, and no doubt on account of what\n\nhe thought might be his reputation as an ardent nationalist, Rashid Ali has\n\nbeen at pains to assure me that he aimed at no change of attitude towards\n\nGreat Britain or the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance, and intended to continue his\n\npredecessor’s endeavours to maintain and strengthen the closest friendly relations\n\nbetween Iraq and Great Britain. At the same time he has intimated that in\n\norder to retain public confidence his Government would have to encourage and\n\nlead the patriotism of the younger generation, and show a readiness to work\n\nwith them for the realisation of their national hopes and aspirations. His\n\nintentions have been, I think, genuine, but he has little sense of reality and\n\nmay fail to see the danger to Iraq of the purely emotional patriotism, born\n\nof chimerical dreams divorced from fact, which is cultivated among the youth\n\nof Iraq to-day.\n\n5 . Since Rashid Ali took office there has been a noticeable and somewhat\n\ndisturbing movement towards more extreme views in public opinion, as I felt\n\nbound to warn him the other day (my te jegram No. 159 of 13th May). The\n\nfanaticism and propaganda of the numerous raiestmian And Syrian political\n\nrefugees have been gaining influence, and anti-British sentiments are everywhere\n\nbeing more and more openly and emphatically expressed. I do not believe that\n\nRashid Ali is himself responsible for this change, which is due more to external\n\nthan internal causes, but a man with greater practical experience of the world"
