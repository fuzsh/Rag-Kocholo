Her doctoral work analyzes the role of Palestinians in Israeli capitalism, focusing on everyday encounters and non-conventional sites of contestation, such as high-tech firms and shopping centers.\n\nMore recently, she is researching nuclear histories and technologies in the Middle East, which has been published in Third World Quarterly, International Affairs, and Global Affairs. She is also an Affiliated Scholar at the Center for International Studies (CERI) at Sciences Po, where she collaborates with the Nuclear Knowledges research collective."
