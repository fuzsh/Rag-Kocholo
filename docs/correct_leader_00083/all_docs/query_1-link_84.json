In post-war Iraq, the Constitution of Iraq, in its \"Transitional Guidelines,\" creates a three-member presidency (or presidential) council, consisting of the president of Iraq and two deputy presidents, who must act in unison. The presidency council had three members to accommodate Iraq's three largest groups: Sunni Muslim Arabs, Shiite Muslim Arabs, and the mostly Sunni Kurds. As a unit, the Presidency Council was meant to symbolize the unity of the nation. This arrangement is required by the constitution to continue until the Council of Representatives, enters its second set of sessions. At this point, the Presidency Council would be replaced by a solitary President of the Republic, who would have only one deputy, the vice-president. In any case, the Presidency is appointed by the Council of Representatives. The three-member arrangement was a hold-over from the Iraqi Interim Government and the Iraqi Transitional Government.\n\nIn September 2014, three new vice presidents were elected: former prime ministers Nouri al-Maliki and Ayad Allawi and former speaker of Parliament Osama al-Nujaifi.\n\nOn August 11, 2015, the Council of Representatives approved the plan proposed by the al Abadi government to eliminate the positions of vice president and deputy prime minister. However, this decision was met with opposition, and Osama al-Nujaifi filed a constitutional complaint. Nuri al-Maliki also expressed his determination to retain his position.\n\nOn October 10, 2016, Federal Supreme Court of Iraq of Iraq ruled that the abolition of the three vice president posts was unconstitutional. Consequently, the positions were reinstated. However, since October 2, 2018, the three vice president offices have remained vacant.\n\nList of officeholders\n\nUnder Iraqi Republic and Ba'athist Iraq\n\nThe Ba'athist regime of Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein also used the office of Vice President. However, the post was not as influential as the Vice Chairmen of the Revolutionary Command Council. Vice Presidents were appointed at the discretion of the President.\n\nPortrait Name\n\n(Birth–Death) Term of office Political party President Notes Took office Left office Time in office → • Iraqi Republic (pre–Ba'ath Party) (1958–1968) • → Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr\n\nأحمد حسن البكر\n\n(1914–1982) 18 November 1963 4 January 1964 47 days Iraqi Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region) Abdul Salam Arif → • Iraqi Republic (under Ba'ath Party) (1968–2003) • → Saddam Hussein\n\nصدام حسين\n\n(1937–2006) July 1968 July 1979 11 years Iraqi Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region) Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr Hardan al-Tikriti\n\nحردان عبدالغفار التكريتي\n\n(1925–1971) 3 April 1970 October 1970 5 months Iraqi Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region) Salih Mahdi Ammash\n\nصالح مهدي عماش\n\n(1924–1985) 3 April 1970 December 1971 1 year, 7 months Iraqi Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region) Taha Muhie-eldin Marouf\n\nطه محيي الدين معروف\n\n(1929–2009) April 1974 April 2003 29 years Iraqi Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region) Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr\n\nSaddam Hussein Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri\n\nعزة إبراهيم الدوري\n\n(1942–2020) July 1979 April 2003 23 years, 274 days Iraqi Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region) Saddam Hussein Taha Yassin Ramadan\n\nطه ياسين رمضان الجزراوي‎\n\n(1938–2007) March 1991 April 2003 12 years, 31 days Iraqi Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region)\n\nRepublic of Iraq since 2004\n\nPortrait Name\n\n(Birth–Death) Term of office Political party President Notes Took office Left office Time in office Ibrahim al-Jaafari\n\nإبراهيم الجعفري\n\n(born 1947) 1 June 2004 7 April 2005 310 days Islamic Dawa Party Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer Rowsch Shaways\n\nروز نورى شاويس\n\n(1947–2021) 1 June 2004 7 April 2005 310 days Kurdistan Democratic Party Adil Abdul-Mahdi\n\nعادل عبد المهدي\n\n(born 1942) 7 April 2005 11 July 2011 6 years, 95 days Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq Jalal Talabani Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer\n\nغازي مشعل عجيل الياور\n\n(born 1958) 7 April 2005 22 April 2006 1 year, 15 days The Iraqis Tariq al-Hashimi\n\nطارق الهاشمي\n\n(born 1942) 22 April 2006 10 September 2012 6 years, 141 days Iraqi Islamic Party Khodair al-Khozaei\n\nخضير الخزاعي\n\n(born 1947) 13 May 2011 9 September 2014 3 years, 119 days Islamic Dawa Party – Iraq Organisation Jalal Talabani\n\nFuad Masum Nouri al-Maliki\n\nنوري المالكي\n\n(born 1950) 9 September 2014 11 August 2015 336 days Islamic Dawa Party Fuad Masum Osama al-Nujaifi\n\nأسامة النجيفي\n\n(born 1956) 9 September 2014 11 August 2015 336 days Muttahidoon Ayad Allawi\n\nأياد علاوي\n\n(born 1944) 9 September 2014 11 August 2015 336 days Iraqi National Accord Post abolished (11 August 2015–10 October 2016) Post restored (10 October 2016–present) Nouri al-Maliki\n\nنوري المالكي\n\n(born 1950) 10 October 2016 2 October 2018 1 year, 357 days Islamic Dawa Party Fuad Masum Osama al-Nujaifi\n\nأسامة النجيفي\n\n(born 1956) 10 October 2016 2 October 2018 1 year, 357 days Muttahidoon Ayad Allawi\n\nأياد علاوي\n\n(born 1944) 10 October 2016 2 October 2018 1 year, 357 days Iraqi National Accord\n\nTimeline\n\nSee also"
