        "text": "You can pre-order \"Everybody, Be Cool!\" on Barnes & Noble now! 📖 I included Barnes & Noble, Inc. in the \"Acknowledgments\" of this book because I wrote much of it there. Being at the bookstore really helped me through this process, which has challenged me in many ways. There's nothing like a book store to inspire, protect, and connect. 🌟 The vibes are always 1000/10. 🏆 📖 That's what I love about reading and readers. You learn, you put yourselves in other people's shoes. 👠 You become open to new ideas and (GASP) maybe even change. 🤔 Personal development is simlar because it challenges people evolve and improve. 🧠 ❤️ I wrote this book with the intention of bringing positivity and elevation into the world. ✨ 🚀 ...And with business results! 📈 🙃 🔎 Figuring out the self-publishing route has been quite the learning journey while navigating all the things. I've learned a lot about getting a book to market. I ultimately went with Ingram Spark as the publisher (thanks to the input from folks here on LinkedIn who generously answered my quesions) and used Atticus to format the ebooks. And I designed everything with Canva. Myself. No gatekeeping here. Shoutout to youtube, which helped me learn a lot quickly and in the flow of werk. Happy to share what I’ve learned if you’re interesting in writing a book too (if I can do it, you can do it). 🎁 Thanks for your encouragement and insight along the way. It's meant the world. 🌎 Reach out if you’d like to discuss Everybody, Be Cool! Or bring the ideas to your organization. https://lnkd.in/gN7W5uQH #everybodybecool #selfpublishing #ingramspark\n\nShe’s here and she’s fabulous (the book proof, that is)! 📖🤩 It’s so nice to see a physical copy of “Everybody, Be Cool!” after several months of researching, writing, editing, and designing this labor of love. 🤓❤️ Much different than reading it on a Google Doc on my computer! After I read through ONE MORE time, I will make any needed changes, and then move to production. Getting closer… 🙏🏽🧿🤯🎨🙃 💌 Reach out if you’d like to talk about the book, are interested in ghostwriting services to write YOUR book, and/or you want to bring the 6 EBC personal development lessons to YOUR workplace. 📝👻👩🏽🏫📈📊 #everybodybecool #books #selfpublishing #bookmarketing #personaldevelopment #ghostwriter\n\nUnder the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai - Dubai Government launched the House of the Future competition for ambitious architects and designers from around the world to design a highly-affordable, expandable, revolutionary, innovative, aesthetically-pleasing house, suited for modern Emirati needs. Taking this project from an idea to launch was an exceptionally challenging yet fun journey. The unwavering support from our partners - Ahmed Bukhash, Charles Walker, Andrew Mason at Santiago Calatrava, and others, has been one of the biggest success factors of this competition launch. Excited to see the winning submissions and their impact on the local architectural landscape. Architects, Register through the link - https://lnkd.in/dJHHa7dv\n\nIt was an honor to have Alamira Reem Al Hashimi, PhD speak recently about her book Planning Abu Dhabi: An Urban History in my NYUAD core class #cinematic #imagination - #modernity #media #music (CCEA-UH1085), which engages with #urbanstudies #mediastudies and #visual #culture to better understand how technological developments and urbanization in histories of #berlin and #abudhabi have shaped various aesthetic, social, and political concerns. Alamira Reem Al Hashimi, PhD is an #abudhabi native and the first #emirati woman to be awarded a Ph.D. in City and Regional Planning from #ucberkeley As an #urbanplanner and #researcher who has studied the emirate’s development for over a decade, she presented the period under the leadership of H.H. #sheikhzayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (1966-2004) to my students. Thank you Alamira Reem Al Hashimi, PhD for sharing your intellectual journey and book with us--and, as you mentioned, it was great meeting you, another UC woman PhD!
