        "text": "So I read Neuromancer a little while back and, while I liked it at first, as I continued to read I completely lost interest in and comprehension of the story.\n\nHowever, on a whim, I just picked up a cheap used copy of Count Zero, and was wondering if it would be worth reading in spite of the fact that I was dissatisfied with Neuromancer?\n\nOne Man's Opinion\n\nMy personal opinion is that the two followups Count Zero and Mona Lisa Overdrive are weak followups to Neuromancer, a book I liked very much.\n\nIt think it's Count Zero that has this regularly tempoed cut from plot to plot like- ABC-ABC -ABC until it becomes like a frigging march. That drove me nuts ; I hate when writers do that. I remember Gibson bragging defensively to criticisms that he was an empty stylist, that he could do plot. Well, telling a story in chapters that are exactly the same in length and pace in a continuous, robotic, unceasing plot rotation, is not a good thing. I mean you could use it as a device, but it didn't seem like that was what was going on there. It's a pretty straight ahead SF story.\n\nMona Lisa Overdrive has a bit more of a relaxed pace. I recall it being more of a mood piece.\n\nHe is a great stylist though, and one smart dude -I'm sure he's an even better writer now and has that all sewn up.\n\nI'm tempted to pick up Pattern Recognition soon. That got pretty good reviews.\n\nSo, no; if you didn't like Neuromancer, Count Zero is definitely not going to make everything better."
