        "text": "1. (NU) - There is a movement afoot that is taking fashion and design to a new level. It’s a retro- futuristic style blending science fiction with a 19th century Vic- torian era aesthetic, and it’s called Steampunk. This eye- catching look is popping up everywhere: in theaters, movies, music and red-carpet fashion. To understand how this un- usual form of expression has steamrolled through the art, fash- ion and literary worlds, one must look back before looking for- ward. Steampunk can trace its roots back to the 19th century works of H.G. Wells and Jules Verne as they imagined the future during the IndustrialAge, with its brass and wood creations, pow- ered only by steam. Although many science fiction stories writ- ten in the 20th century have been set in the Victorian period, the term “steampunk” is believed to be first used in the late 1980s, when author K. W. Jeter used it to describe stories set in the Vic- torian period written during that time when near-future cyberpunk was the prevailing form of sci- ence fiction. Evidence of the con- tinuing popularity of the steam- punk look and feel can be traced in feature films, from 1927’s “Metropolis” to this year’s “Mad Max: Fury Road.” The appeal of steampunk is oft-times a love of the Victori- an period, while others enjoy steampunk’s unique approach to technology: re-imagining mod- ern capabilities with 19th cen- tury machines. Jeannie Mai, host of GSN’s new “Steam- punk’d” reality competition TV series explains, “Steampunk is a culture. It’s not just fashion. It’s a lifestyle, like punk rock. Punk rock is music, but it’s also a look and a style.” GSN is hoping to capitalize on the growing trend with the debut of its new series. “Steam- punk’d” features 10 contestants in a litany of pressure-filled challenges designed to test their abilities to transform ordinary objects and fashion into steam- punk masterpieces. As each pro- ject is completed, the contes- tants (or Makers) will unveil their work for the judges,in- cluding leading authority on Steampunk Thomas Willeford. Other judges include writer/di- rector Matt King and Kate “Kato” Lambert, founder of the world’s first steampunk clothing company, Steampunk Couture. Each week, one of the 10 Makers will be eliminated until only one is left standing to take home the $100,000 grand prize. The series debuts onAug. 19 at 10 p.m. ET/9 pm Central on GSN.
