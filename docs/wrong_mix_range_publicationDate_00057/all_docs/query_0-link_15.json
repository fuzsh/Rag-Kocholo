        "text": "âGenuinely original is always a tough sell.â\n\n- Bruce Bethke\n\nâ\n\n\"Our new heroes wonât be our old heroes.\"\n\n- Dr. Joseph Hurtgen\n\nâCyberpunk is a word Bruce Bethke came up with in 1980 and was the title of the short story he wrote about a group of teenage hackers, which is considered the first cyberpunk story. Note that Jeter's Dr.Â Adder had been written in 1972 but wasn't published until 1984, though certainly many earlier works also influenced cyberpunk from Ballard to Brunner's Shockwave Riders in 1975.\n\nIn 1982, Bladerunner was released, but the genre would not be solidified until the seminal work Neuromancer by William Gibson in 1984. Â Meanwhile, others worked to develop it including K.W. Jeter, Lewis Shiner, Pat Cadigan, Bruce Sterling, Rudy Rucker, TomÂ Maddox, Michael Swanwick, and John Shirley.\n\nI had the honor of speaking with Bruce Bethke recently and he told me when he came up with the word cyberpunk, he never dreamed weâd still be discussing this forty years later. The following is based on, and paraphrased from, the discussion with Bruce and sci-fi author / critic Dr. Joseph Hurtgen. In the configuration of the cyberpunk term, Cyber was the easy part of the word, it was the punk that would truly create something new.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \"IÂ never dreamed we'd be discussing this forty years later.\" - Bruce BethkeMark To Bruce:\n\nCan you give us a brief basis of cyberpunk history first?\n\nBruce (Paraphrased):\n\nRight before cyberpunk started, fantasy was huge. But it was merely a rush to see who could copy Tolkeinâs writing style the quickest. Sci-fi had been degraded into endless Star Trek type novels. The great sci-fi legends werenât at the top of their game anymore and were just rehashing their old ideas. Science fiction had become âself-referential metafiction.â\n\nCyberpunk was originally written in the early 80âs at the height of the Cold War by authors who lived through Vietnam and had grown up reading Vernor Vinge, John Varley, John Brunner, Kurt Vonnegut, and Phillip K. Dick. It explored ideas of social organization in a critical, almost anarchic and nihilistic manner. This went beyond sci-fiâs obsession with aliens and space. The heroes were no longer good guys, they were antiheroes on the fringes of society speaking up against the horrors of their generation. It just needed one thing â commercial appeal.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \"The heroes were no longer good guys.\"\n\nOnce Stars Wars was released in 1977, the world realized that sci-fi could be a major money maker, and publishers were willing to put a lot of money into all sub-genres of sci-fi, including cyberpunk. The glory days lasted until 1986, when the genre died, only to be reawakened for a moment by The Matrix to die again. It died, according to Bruce, because no one was doing anything original; they were expected to fill a niche with a marketing formula.\n\n2021 update - Examining Google Trends' seaches for cyberpunk, Even Cyberpunk 2077, as depicted in the graph below, failed to create long-term interest in the sub-genre. Searches for cyberpunk literature followed the same trend.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Cyberpunk remains underground.â"
