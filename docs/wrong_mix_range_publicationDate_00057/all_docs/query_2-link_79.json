        "text": "Gideon the Ninth\n\nBy Tamsyn Muir,\n\nFrom my list on sci-fi books moral and perspective dilemmas.\n\nBy Morgan Biscup Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nIn writing character-driven space fantasy, heavily influenced by my training as an electromechanical engineer, I’ve realized a love for stories with a heavy emphasis on moral dilemmas and shifts in thinking. How does a character change direction after realizing much of what they always believed was a lie? When well-trained instincts pull them backward instead of propelling them forward? I love these stories, mirroring my own messy self-discovery journey through life. The settings and stakes are more fantastical, but that makes them more appealing. A way to confront my own trials without becoming burdened by them. If the characters can do it, so can I.\n\nMorgan's book list on sci-fi books moral and perspective dilemmas\n\nWhy did Morgan love this book?\n\nI love necromancers in space settings and opinionated characters with a strong voice, and Tamsyn Muir’s book did not disappoint. The book gradually ramps the action, emotion, and secrets until I couldn’t put it down. I was pulled into Gideon’s plight, first as she attempts to yet again escape indentured servitude to the necromancer Harrow, then as she helps Harrow navigate the deadly mysteries of Caanan House in exchange for her freedom.\n\nI loved the fraught relationship between Harrow and Gideon as they navigated their complicated emotions and expectations of each other. The ending was particularly poignant, as their earlier assumptions were shattered in magnificent fashion, thrusting them into a situation neither wanted and revealing the true lengths they’d willingly go to for each other.\n\nBy Tamsyn Muir,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n22 authors picked Gideon the Ninth as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n15+ pages of new, original content, including a glossary of terms, in-universe writings, and more!\n\nA USA Today Best-Selling Novel!\n\n\"Unlike anything I've ever read. \" --V.E. Schwab\n\n\"Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space!\" --Charles Stross\n\n\"Brilliantly original, messy and weird straight through.\" --NPR\n\nThe Emperor needs necromancers.\n\nThe Ninth Necromancer needs a swordswoman.\n\nGideon has a sword, some dirty magazines, and no more time for undead nonsense.\n\nTamsyn Muir's Gideon the Ninth, first in The Locked Tomb Trilogy, unveils a solar system of swordplay, cut-throat politics, and lesbian necromancers. Her characters leap off the page, as…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Lies of Locke Lamora\n\nBy Scott Lynch,\n\nFrom my list on SFF books about brotherhood and male friendships.\n\nBy Jeremy Szal Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs a young man who deals with issues of loneliness, depression, and melancholy, I’ve always been drawn to platonic male friendships in fiction. Seeing acts of brotherly courage and heroism on the page has always resonated with me, especially when my own friendships in the real world have felt lacking. Men aren’t the best at discussing their emotions, especially not with each other, and I’ve desperately sought out stories where even the most grizzled male heroes are, deep down, in need of a friend. In writing Stormblood, I wanted to have a strong sense of brotherhood and unity between the male cast members as they battle enemies and face their personal demons.\n\nJeremy's book list on SFF books about brotherhood and male friendships\n\nWhy did Jeremy love this book?\n\nThe Gentlemen Bastards are not necessarily good people, but I still love them. Why? Because they care for each other.\n\nThis might not immediately be evident. They’re always ready with a cutting quip or a beautifully timed comeback, and they’re not above pulling some nasty tricks on each other just for a laugh. But when all hell breaks loose, you better believe that Locke and Jean have each other’s backs, with an axe or a blade in hand—or both.\n\nTrue, they lie, steal, swindle, and rob the rich, and the poor don’t see a cent of it. But the loyalty that these men have to each other speaks to an unbreakable bond of brotherhood, and I am all here for it.\n\nBy Scott Lynch,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n11 authors picked The Lies of Locke Lamora as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'One of my top ten books ever.

Martin, the phenomenon behind A Game of Thrones\n\nThey say that the Thorn of Camorr can beat anyone in a fight. They say he steals from the rich and gives to the poor.

I have an M.A. in history and have always been interested in old folklore and myth. So I write fantasy novels set in the 19th century. The flair is steampunk-ish, the setting strictly historical – except for the fact that magic and mythical creatures exist. Magic is taught in Arcane Lodges, mythical beings can be pretty much anything: vampire, body-snatcher, werewolf, dryad, nymph, etc. My first novel Obsidian Secrets (Das Obsidianherz) won the Deutscher Phantastik Preis. Wings of Stone of the same series won the SERAPH as the \"Best Fantasy Novel\" at Leipzig Book Fair.\n\nJu's book list on combining fantasy with “the past”\n\nWhy did Ju love this book?\n\nThe heroine is soulless – the book certainly is not.\n\nAn admirably determined and courageous young lady holds her own in a steampunk version of 19th century London where werewolves and vampires play an important part in society – and everyone knows they exist.\n\nThey simply belong to the Victorian upper class and try to fit their species typical lifestyles into a world somewhere between Charles Dickens and Arthur Conan Doyle. I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

From bad to worse apparently, for Alexia accidentally kills the vampire - and then the appalling Lord Maccon (loud, messy, gorgeous, and werewolf) is sent by Queen Victoria to investigate.\n\nWith unexpected vampires appearing and expected vampires disappearing, everyone seems to believe Alexia responsible.

With Patricia C. Wrede, I wrote half of the Kate and Cecy series: Sorcery and Cecelia, The Grand Tour, and The Mislaid Magician.\n\nCaroline's book list on historical fantasy for armchair travel\n\nWhy did Caroline love this book?\n\nAgent of the Ministry of Alchemy, Enchantments, and Supernatural Entities, Fatma el-Sha'arawi is the spectacularly well-dressed protagonist tasked with saving the world (again) in an alternate 1912 Cairo. This award-winning novel awed me with its detail and invention. What I loved most was the way the world building relegated the British Empire to relative unimportance. Come to think of it, I loved the Ministry library almost as much.\n\nBy P.

Jeter,\n\nFrom my list on paranormal steampunk in the gaslit world.\n\nBy Jeff Young Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI find joy in niches and steampunk is not cut from the ordinary cloth. I was originally challenged to produce a story that incorporated magic into steampunk. The resulting character, Kassandra Leyden who can speak to the dead, brought to life an alternate history where a deadly plague made the British Empire emigrate to the Americas and begin anew. The style and fashion of steampunk in modifying the ordinary appeals to the maker in me. I am an avid renfaire attendee and create and sell garb, which now includes steampunk elements. I hope you enjoy these choices and discover what steampunk has to offer as a genre.\n\nJeff's book list on paranormal steampunk in the gaslit world\n\nWhy did Jeff love this book?\n\nThe subtitle to the work, “a Mad Victorian Fantasy” goes a long way to explaining the style of Infernal Devices which follows George Dower inheritor of his father’s clockwork business.

A romp full of purple prose from one of the progenitors of the term “steampunk.”\n\nBy K.W. Jeter,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Infernal Devices as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe classic Steampunk novel from the creator of the term itself - thirty years ago this month.\n\nWhen George Dower's father died, he left George his watchmaker's shop - and more. But George has little talent for watches and other infernal devices. When someone tries to steal an old device from the premises, George finds himself embroiled in a mystery of time travel, music and sexual intrigue.\n\nFile Under: Steampunk\n\nPreview\n\nThe Affinity Bridge\n\nBy George Mann,\n\nWhy did Jeff love this book?\n\nThe first in the Newbury and Hobbs series finds our intrepid pair of investigators trying to tie together an airship crash, a mysterious plague among the less fortunate of London, a spate of murders that leaves Scotland Yard clueless and the reappearing ghost of a police officer.
