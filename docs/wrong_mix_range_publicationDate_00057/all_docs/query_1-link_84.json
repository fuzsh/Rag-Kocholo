        "text": "Softcover. Condition: Good. First Edition. From Library Journal Neuromancer is a fitting commemoration of the tenth anniversary of publication of Gibson&apos;s Nebula, Hugo, and Philip K. Dick Award-winning novel. The text is abridged, read by the author, and enhanced with music, sound effects, and other audio engineering. The plot contains sex, drugs, black market body parts, virtual reality, electronic relationships, pleasure palaces, murder, mayhem, cloned assassins, and intrigue in cyberspace, with nary a virtual nice guy in the mix. Wow! There&apos;s just enough time to take a deep breath between cassettes, as the listener is bombarded with strong language, tumultuous violence, and compelling imagery. Terrific stuff. Gibson&apos;s horrifying vision of our terrible headlong rush to nowhere is a must for science fiction and adult fiction collections.\n\nHardcover. Condition: New. 1st Edition. First Easton Press \"20th Anniversary Edition,\" first printing. New introduction by Gibson, and new afterword by Jack Womack. Blue leather-bound hardback issued without dust jacket. New condition. Signed by Gibson on a special tipped-in page. Includes \"Note About\" card and \"Certificate of Authenticity\" signed by Gibson, an unidentified witness, and Easton publisher Geoffrey O'Neill. Multiple copies available, many (but not all) still in publisher's original unopened shrinkwrap. Provenance: author's promotional copies, purchased directly from William Gibson.

First Ace hardcover edition, lightly ex-lib with two rubber stamps only (one to the front fly leaf, the other to the head of the text block), the book also has a mild skew to the binding, light bumps to the spine ends and cover corners, slight sunning to the spine and head, and a faint offset toning to the front from the jacket. Overall, a solid, tight, Very Good copy in a like, unclipped dust jacket, which has slight sunning to the spine with a yellowed label stain at the tail, light bumps to the spine ends and corners, rubbing with mild smudging to the covers, and some creasing at the tail of the back. The jacket is wrapped in Mylar, and additional images are available by request.\n\n8vo. [8], 278 pp. Half-black over purple boards, gilt lettering on spine, w/ d.j. cover art by Rick Berry & Darrel Anderson, F/F copy. First hardcover edition (released in paperback in 1984) of this groundbreaking title in the Sprawl Trilogy which launched the cyberpunk genre, and only novel to win the Nebula, Philip K. Dick, and Hugo Awards, following Henry Case, a washed-up hacker brought in for one more job. Gibson's trilogy heavily influenced the Wachowski Brothers, with Neo and Trinity clearly similar to Bobby Newmark out of Count Zero and Molly in Johnny Mnemonic as well as Neuromancer.\n\nFirst Printing. Octavo (21.75cm); black and purple paper-covered boards, with titles stamped in gilt on spine; dustjacket; [viii],[2],3-278,[2]pp. Signed by the author on the title page.

An adventure story much enlivened by elaborate technical jargon and sleazy, streetwise characters the pioneering \"cyberpunk\" novel and arguably the most influential SF novel of the 1980s\" (Barron, Anatomy of Wonder II-439). This edition with a new afterword by the author. An important debut, winner of the Hugo, Nebula, and Philip K. Dick awards. First Ace Hardcover Edition (and Tenth Anniversary Edition).\n\nSoftcover. Condition: Near fine. First Edition. 12mo, 271pp., plus Acknowledgements and double-sided ad leaf. First printing. A crisp, clean, unread copy, very near fine, but for a flattened crease on the front wrap, and a very dull vertical crease in the middle of the spine. A touch rubbed at the crown. Contents fresh and clean, but for very gentle toning to the edges. Faint offsetting to the interior of the rear wrap. A particularly sharp, fresh copy of this paperback original, also published in hardcover by Gollancz in the UK the same year. Increasingly uncommon in this condition. Gibson's masterwork is credited with establishing the \"cyberpunk\" genre, and remains one of the most prophetic examples of speculative fiction, exploring the dangerous blurred lines between human and machine consciousness, which seem to beguile our species a full four decades after publication.\n\nHardcover.

Book with some foxing to the outer edge of the closed text block, otherwise appearing unread. Jacket with a sticker indicating that the book was autographed for University Book Store in Seattle/Bellvue. William Gibson's sci-fi classic. Not only would Neuromancer be the first book to win all three of the Nebula, Hugo, and Philip K. Dick awards, but the book is also responsible for helping to popularize the cyberpunk genre. Indeed, when Gibson saw Blade Runnerâ\"in the middle of the novel's compositionâ\"he thought Neuromancer would receive lukewarm reviews and be viewed as a kind of rip-off, instead of the revelation it was. Much of the dialogue and cant that the work is famous for was adapted by Gibson from the street slang of the Toronto underworld, which Gibson became familiar with when he moved to Canada in the late 1960s. Neuromancer is on Time magazine's list of the 100 best English language novels since 1923, and has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide to date. A contemporary review hailed GIbson's first novel as \"[A]n amazing, virtuoso performance. Kaleidoscopic, picaresque, flashy and decadent\" (Washington Post).
