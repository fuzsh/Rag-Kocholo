        "text": "The Talented Mr. Ripley – First Page\n\nPosted by Kevin Donovan on January 3, 2011 · 1 Comment\n\nTom glanced behind him and saw the man coming out of the Green Cage, heading his way. Patricia Highsmith’s The Talented Mr. Ripley‘s opening has shades of the first page of another book I’ve read for this blog, William Gibson’s Neuromancer.

The poll brought in a three-way tie and we are going to go with the book ranked highest in the master list. Neuromancer wins by appearing on six of the twenty-four lists.
