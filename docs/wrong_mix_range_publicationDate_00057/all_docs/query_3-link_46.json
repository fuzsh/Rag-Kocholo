        "text": "Centered on Waltham’s beautiful Common at the corner of Main and Moody Streets, the Watch City Steampunk Festival is the great outdoor festival of the Steampunk genre—a cultural and social movement melding elements of Victorian-era history and fashion with retro-futuristic technology.\n\nWatch City 2015 will featuring a broad array of theatrical and musical performers as well as clothing, jewelry, art, and food vendors. The Festival is will also include kids programming, making this most definitely a family friendly event, as well.\n\nAsk a Steampunk: Where Did the Term \"Steampunk\" Come From?\n\nScience fiction author K.W. Jeter is credited with creating the term “steampunk” in 1987 to describe a style of fantasy fiction that featured Victorian technology, especially technology powered by steam. It was a tongue-in-cheek variant of “cyberpunk” fiction, replacing cyberpunk’s high-tech computers with the Victorian era’s cogs and factories. Jeter named it in a letter published in Locus magazine:\n\nBoth cyberpunk and steampunk deal with the relationship between humans and technology, with the humans providing the “punk” element as they struggle to control, break away from, or enhance the role of technology in their lives.\n\nOnce this pattern was established, more “fill-in-the-blank-punks” were identified. The next most popular is “dieselpunk”, which moves into the technology of the 30’s and 40’s; the move “Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow” is a good example of the style. Other examples are “atompunk”, moving into the atomic age of the 50’s and 60’s; “biopunk”, dealing with the ramifications of biotechnology; and “solarpunk”, which take a more hopeful view of our ability to cope with environmental issues."
