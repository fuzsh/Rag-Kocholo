A paperback original. Signed by William Gibson on the title page. In very good condition with laminate over the original cover.\n\nNeuromancer, the beginning of the Sprawl trilogy, was the first winner of the science-fiction \"triple crown:\" the Nebula Award, the Philip K. Dick Award, and the Hugo Award. Gibson coined the term \"cyberspace,\" in this book, \"described as \"a three dimensional representation of computer data through which users communicate and do business, alongside a whole host of more dubious activities.\""
