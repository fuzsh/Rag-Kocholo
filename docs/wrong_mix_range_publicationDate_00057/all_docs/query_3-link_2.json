        "text": "Kevin Wayne Jeter (born 1950) is an American science fiction and horror author, who wrote The Bounty Hunter Wars trilogy. He is known for his literary writing style, dark themes, and paranoid, unsympathetic characters. He has also written several Star Trek: Deep Space Nine novels and comics set in the Star Trek universe, and three sequels to Blade Runner.\n\nBiography[]\n\nJeter attended college at California State University, Fullerton where he became friends with James P. Blaylock and Tim Powers, and through them, Philip K. Dick. Many of Jeter's books focus on the subjective nature of reality in a way that is reminiscent of the works of Dick.\n\nJeter wrote what was likely the first true Cyberpunk novel (though he probably would protest that description), Dr. Adder, which was enthusiastically recommended by Philip K. Dick. Due to its violent and sexually-provocative content, it took Jeter approximately ten years to find a publisher for it. Jeter is also the first to coin the term, \"Steampunk,\" to describe the retro-technology, alternate-history works that he published along with his friends, Blaylock and Powers. Jeter's Steampunk novels were Morlock Night and Infernal Devices. Current projects include the dark fantasy novel \"The Kingdom of Shadows,\" \"Death's Apprentice: A Grimm City Novel,\" with Gareth Jefferson Jones, and the \"Kim Oh\" thriller series,\n\nAs well as his own original novels, K. W. Jeter has written a number of authorized novel sequels to the critically acclaimed 1982 motion picture Blade Runner, which was adapted from Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.\n\nHe currently lives in Cuenca, Ecuador, with his wife, Geri.\n\nThis article is a stub about an author.
