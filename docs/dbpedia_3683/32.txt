The short-lived spin-off of the immensely popular UK series (Primeval, one of my all-time favorite shows), Primeval: New World had a rocky life. In my opinion, it wasn’t until the end of its life when it finally started taking advantage of its basic premise. The conclusion of the premiere has an incredible hook, but it’s not fulfilled, or really even touched upon, until it’s too late.

I believe it was just after Babe in the Woods (episode 7) aired that I was like… where’d it go?! Then I learned, shortly thereafter, that Syfy would be burning off the rest in a marathon event.

There are some really fun storylines in this show and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Episodes 1 and 9 are really good ones to watch if you’re just wanting to check it out and see what it’s about. They’ve both got that sci-fi thing that makes my skin tingle! The two-part finale might be hard to appreciate in full if you don’t watch the whole thing, but they’re still two of the best episodes overall. It makes me incredibly sad that we don’t get to see what happens after the cliffhanger at the end — and it’s a doozy.
