"What if this world is the only one there is?"

This article is written from the real world point of view (not from the Primeval Universe).

The Primeval title sequence (or opening titles) is the video sequence seen at the beginning of every episode of Primeval. It featured a number of Anomaly shards with pictures of the main cast members in them, accompanied by their names, as well as video clips of the creatures reflected some of the shards.

The Peter Anderson Studio designed the Series 1 to 3 title sequences although it is unknown if they also did the Series 4 and 5 sequence. The Primeval Theme Tune was played over the top of it.

Ben Mansfield was a main character in every episode but was not credited in the intro until Episode 3.6 onwards.

The Wakeling/Theobald shard changed to a creature clip instead of a cast's image.

The creature clips were all updated to Series 2 creatures and two Series 3 creatures.

Series 4 and Series 5

For these series of Primeval, after its it's cancellation, a new type introduction video was made. It was based on the original type but was more three dimensional and the Anomaly shards were changed from black and grey to orange and gold. The cast's names were still shown, but their images were not, only video clips of creatures were shown including the sound produced by the creatures in the clips. The Theme Tune was recomposed to compensate for the shorter title sequence.

Those featured in the title sequence for Series 4 and Series 5 are:
