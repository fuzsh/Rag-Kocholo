        "text": "How does the saying go again? \"Don't be sad it's over, be happy it happened\"? That's how we're all feeling after the end of Justified: City Primeval, FX's limited series (for now) that brought upon the return of Timothy Olyphant's iconic U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, as he finds himself in Detroit taking on a brutal and ruthless killer. And while the ending brought things to a satisfying and thoughtful conclusion (and certainly left open the possibility of another Justified sequel in the future), that doesn't mean we didn't all immediately have a thirst for more.\n\nLuckily, in case you somehow haven't noticed, we live in a fairly golden age of television (and movies have been a good place to go for entertainment of all genres and varieties for damn near 100 years). If you want more of the feeling that Justified: City Primeval gave you, it's out there for the watching.\n\nBelow, we've gathered several shows (and a couple movies), that have something in common with City Primeval; something that will capture that same feeling. Now, not every entry on this list is a gritty lawman adventure; not every entry has a maniacal murder who you love to hate. But they've all got something that you'll just feel. If it's not literally connected, you'll feel it in the vibe."
