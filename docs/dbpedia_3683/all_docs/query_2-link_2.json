        "text": "Primeval is a British science fiction drama television show produced by Impossible Pictures for ITV. It was created by Tim Haines and Adrian Hodges. It was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 10th February, 2007, running for five series finishing, on 28th June, 2011.\n\nPremise\n\nPrimeval follows a secret government research team, which is tasked with investigating doorways through time and space called Anomalies which are opening and allowing deadly creatures from across Earth's distant past and future to cross into and run rampant in the present. While predicting and discovering more about the Anomalies, the team must also contain the creatures and send them back through to their time periods whenever possible.\n\nSeries\n\nSeries 1\n\nThe first series of Primeval focuses on the newly-founded research team's attempts to combat the Anomalies and learn about and predict them. It also initially focuses on team leader Nick Cutter's search for answers on how the Anomalies are linked to the disappearance of his wife Helen eight years ago, and then later on what Helen's agenda is and who's side she's on. It is ultimately discovered that Helen merely wants to know more about the Anomalies for herself and does not care about the damage they are causing. At the end of the series, after returning from a mission into the past, Cutter discovers that team government official Claudia Brown has been erased from the timeline while he was in the past.\n\nThis series aired in 2007 and ran for 6 episodes.\n\nSeries 2\n\nIn the second series of the show, as the team are now part of the Anomaly Research Centre, it focuses on Cutter's struggle to cope with losing Claudia Brown and with the arrival of the team's new PR guru Jenny Lewis, who seems to be Claudia's doppelganger in the new timeline. It also focuses on Helen Cutter's and Oliver Leek's mysterious plans for the Anomalies and the creatures, and on Stephen's relationship with Helen and Connor's with Caroline Steel; and how this affects Connor and Stephen's other relationships with their friends. Leek's and Helen's plans are ultimately stopped and Leek killed, but Stephen is killed in the process.\n\nThis series aired in 2008 and ran for 7 episodes.\n\nSeries 3\n\nIn the aftermath of Stephen Hart's death, the ARC team go through several challenges and up against enemies; including Christine Johnson's plans for the Anomalies and attempts to take over the ARC, and Helen's deadly mission to save the future by attempting to destroy the ARC, killing her husband and later, trying to stop humanity from evolving. Johnson and Helen are both ultimately killed, but Connor, Abby and new team leader Danny Quinn are left marooned in the past.\n\nThis series aired in 2009 and ran for 10 episodes.\n\nSeries 4\n\nSeries 4 focuses on how greatly the ARC has changed in Connor and Abby's absence and on the two's changing relationship; and on new team leader Matt Anderson's mysterious mission and his attempts to protect Victorian time traveller Emily Merchant from the murderous Ethan Dobrowski. Eventually, it is revealed that Matt is secretly from the future and has been sent back to stop the ARC from using the Anomalies to destroy the planet, and that a massive phenomenon with the Anomalies will soon occur.\n\nThis series aired in 2011 and ran for 7 episodes.\n\nSeries 5\n\nShortly after the events of Series 4, Philip Burton fully recruits Connor into his New Dawn project with the Anomalies, while Matt and the newly-recruited Abby secretly work against them to stop New Dawn from destroying the future. The fifth series initially focuses on how Connor and Abby's opposing views and allegiances affects their relationship, and then later on the ARC team's efforts to stop Philip and New Dawn. New Dawn is ultimately destroyed, but Matt then encounters a battered double of himself telling him he must \"go back\".\n\nThis series aired in 2011 and ran for 6 episodes.\n\nProduction\n\nBackground\n\nProducer Tim Haines had the idea for Primeval around the same time he was making the award-winning Walking with Dinosaurs (1999).[1]\n\nPrimeval was initially called \"Cutter's Beastiary\" and was a BBC project, however they weren't interested in the idea, they were at the time, in the process of bringing Doctor Who back and weren't interested in doing two sci fi shows. Tim was introduced to writer Adrian Hodges and together they wrote the initial three script and Tim's company Impossible Pictures took it to ITV who accepted it. Framestore was to provide the visual effects for the creatures as they had worked with Impossible Pictures on the Walking with... series, Chased by Dinosaurs, Sea Monsters and Prehistoric Park. [2]\n\nCo-creator: Tim Haines said:\n\n\"Having introduced the animals to television and documentaries, I always thought, well, if you could bring [the creatures] into drama, make these a part of the story, make them perform a role, then there would be lots of potential for them. So I was very excited about the idea of trying to move this wonderful technology, this dramatic tool, into ordinary tv drama.\" [1]\n\n\"Its hard work. Ninety percent of the drama, despite having all these creatures in it, is about the convincing performance of the actors, the emotions that come across, the telling of the story. All these things have to happen on location\" [1]\n\nCo-creator: Adrian Hodges said:\n\n\"I knew if I could come up with a story that would match those special effects; we'd have something really unique. We didn't want spooky old churches or ghostly houses and things, we wanted something that felt really really modern. The idea we've had from the begining was that we wanted people to feel, having watched this programme, they could go into their kitchen and find a dinosaur in the kitchen. You know, they'd actually feel that close.\" [1]\n\nHaines was keen to take a different approach to the Walking with... creatures, which were as scientifically accurate as possible. Primeval's creatures were, whist mostly based on real animals, aimed at being more character based. They needed something more cinematic. Extra spikes, brow ridges and horns were added of structures changed to make the creatures more scary. [3]\n\nThe first three episodes of Primeval were written by Hodges before any casting had been done. The conclusion to Series 1 was also planned before casting.\n\nOriginal run\n\nPrimeval initially ran for three series, with four episode novelisation books, four new story books, activity books, an interactive game, a line of 5.5\" action figures and other toys being made.\n\nCancellation\n\nDespite rumours near the end of Series 3, ITV denied that they would cancelled Primeval but were waiting for the show to finish airing before recommissioning another series.\n\nOn 15 June, 2009, after the broadcast of Series 3, ITV announced that they had cancelled Primeval and would not be making a forth series. A likely contributing factor to the cancellation was ITV's suffering severe financial troubles during 2009, reporting a £105 million half-year loss. As a result, some of its other popular shows including Heartbeat were axed.\n\nRenewal\n\nOn 29 September 2009, it was announced that a deal had been struck between ITV and fellow television channel Watch to revive the programme, and another 13 episodes of the show were to be filmed and produced in 2010 then aired as two separate series. In an effort to cut costs and use generous Irish Tax incentives for television production, filming moved to Ireland, starting on 22 March 2010. Framestore no longer supplied the visual effects with The Mill taking over. Series 4 and Series 5 were transmitted between January-February and May-June, 2011.\n\nSeries 6/the future of Primeval\n\nFans have hoped following the broadcast of Series 5 of the original Primeval show that it would be renewed for a sixth series. However, the producers claimed that it would not be produced if at all until 2013, and have expressed doubt that there will be a Series 6. With 2013 past, it seems unlikely that Primeval will get another series.\n\nIn 2017, Tim Haines stated there were no current plans to continue Primeval in other media other than television but he and Hodges would be happy to continue the show if a broadcaster came forward.[4]\n\nMain cast members\n\nLatest cast\n\nCiarán McMenamin as Matt Anderson (13 episodes)\n\nAndrew-Lee Potts as Connor Temple (36 episodes)\n\nHannah Spearritt as Abby Maitland (36 episodes)\n\nBen Mansfield as Captain Hilary Becker (21 episodes)\n\nRuth Kearney as Jess Parker (13 episodes)\n\nBen Miller as James Lester (30 episodes)\n\nRuth Bradley as Emily Merchant (9 episodes)\n\nFormer cast\n\nDouglas Henshall as Professor Nick Cutter (16 episodes)\n\nJames Murray as Stephen Hart (13 episodes)\n\nLucy Brown as Claudia Brown (6 episodes) and Jenny Lewis (13 episodes)\n\nJuliet Aubrey as Helen Cutter (16 episodes, 1 episode voice only)\n\nMark Wakeling as Captain Tom Ryan (6 episodes)\n\nJames Bradshaw as Duncan (4 episodes)\n\nJake Curran as Tom (3 episodes)\n\nKarl Theobald as Oliver Leek (7 episodes)\n\nTim Faraday as the Cleaner (4 episodes) and the Cleaner Clones (4 episodes)\n\nNaomi Bentley as Caroline Steel (6 episodes)\n\nJason Flemyng as Danny Quinn (9 episodes)\n\nLaila Rouass as Dr. Sarah Page (10 episodes)\n\nBelinda Stewart-Wilson as Christine Johnson (6 episodes)\n\nRobert Lowe as Jack Maitland (4 episodes)\n\nAlex McSweeney as Captain Joseph Wilder (4 episodes)\n\nAlexander Siddig as Philip Burton (10 episodes)\n\nJonathan Byrne as Patrick Quinn (5 episodes)\n\nAnton Lesser as Gideon (5 episodes)\n\nJanice Byrne as April Leonard (4 episodes)\n\nSpin-offs\n\nCanon\n\nPrimeval novels\n\nA series of new Primeval stories.\n\nPrimeval Evolved\n\nAn interactive web series in which you join the ARC team and must complete one mission each week.
