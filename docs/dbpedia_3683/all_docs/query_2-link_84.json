        "text": "One of the most anticipated shows of summer 2023, FX's Justified: City Primeval, has arrived. That's good news for fans, who have been without their fix of Raylan Givens, the Kentucky-born-and-bred Deputy U.S. Marshal portrayed by Timothy Olyphant since the original Justified series ended eight years. Here's everything you need to know about Justified: City Primeval, including the release date, cast, and trailer.\n\nPremiere date\n\nJustified: City Primeval's two-episode premiere aired on FX on Tuesday, July 18, and was released the next day on . New episodes air on FX Tuesdays at 10 p.m. ET/PT through August 29 and will be available to stream the next day on Hulu. See the full schedule in our episode guide.\n\nCast Guide\n\nShowrunners Dave Andron and Mike Dinner (back left) with cast members (from left) Vondie Curtis-Hall, Timothy Olyphant, Vivian Olyphant, Adelaide Clemens, and Boyd Holbrook\n\nWhen the original Justified series ended, the story arch was fully wrapped up. That means Timothy Olyphant, starring as Raylan Givens, is the only Justified cast member returning for Justified: City Primeval.\n\nThe character of Raylan's daughter, Willa (pictured with Raylan above), also returns. However, since she was only an infant in the final season of the original Justified and a young child in the epilogue, the teen version of her is played by a new actor: Vivian Olyphant, who in real life is the youngest daughter of Olyphant and his wife Alexis Knief.\n\nBoyd Holbrook takes on the role of the villain Clement Mansell. The character is reminiscent of Boyd Crowder in the original Justified in that he is charismatic but utterly unhinged. This is not Holbrook's first rodeo as the bad guy—he plays \"The Corinthian\" in the Netflix series The Sandman and Klaber in the latest Indiana Jones flick. You may also recognize him from Narcos, Wolverine, and the Hatfields & McCoys miniseries, to name a few.\n\nAunjanue Ellis plays defense attorney Carolyn Wilder, who proves she can take Raylan to task in an early courtroom scene. His daughter, Willa, senses that this rare quality makes Carolyn a good match for her dad, but we soon discover a complication on that front: Carolyn is Clement's lawyer.\n\nCarolyn has a ne'er-do-well ex-husband, Jamal (Amin Joseph), who we learn defrauded her and the community. She also has close ties to bar owner Sweety (“I owe you for a lifetime of looking out for me,\" she tells him in an early scene). She and prosecutor Diane (Regina Taylor, who delivers that hilarious Yellowstone reference in episode 1) may be opponents in court, but otherwise they maintain a civil professional relationship.\n\nWhere else you've seen Ellis: King Richard, AMC's 61st Street, Netflix's When They See Us, and HBO's Lovecraft Country, among others.\n\nAdelaide Clemens plays Sandy Stanton, Clement's moll (that's a gangster's girlfriend) and a cocktail waitress with an insufferable boss (Ravi Patel). Together, Clement and Sandy are conning Skender (Alexander Pobutsky), a rich Albanian hot dog magnate who thinks Sandy is his true love. She and Clement are also staying in a penthouse and driving a Range Rover belonging to another of Sandy's affluent marks, Del Weems, who is on a meditation retreat and none the wiser. Sandy willingly participates in these cons, but Clement soon entangles her in an even darker web of crimes.\n\nFans of the Southern gothic series Rectify will recognize Adelaide Clemens from her memorable portrayal of Tawney Talbot. She has also appeared in the FX miniseries Under the Banner of Heaven, the CBS series Tommy, and the 2022 indie film The Swearing Jar. This isn’t her first time working with Timothy Olyphant—they starred together in a theater production of Hold on to Me Darling in 2016.\n\nVondie Curtis-Hall plays Marcus \"Sweety\" Sweeton, a brilliant base player and the proprietor of a local Detroit watering hole. Sweety is a beloved father figure to Carolyn, but he has some skeletons in his closet too, namely past dealings with Clement that have come back to haunt him.\n\nAn actor, director, and screenwriter, Curtis-Hall has appeared in 40 feature films in his extensive career. TV audiences know him from the series For the People, Daredevil, Chicago Hope, and ER. You can also catch him in the Netflix series The Recruit, which premiered in 2022.\n\nNow, for Detroit's finest. Norbert Leo Butz (pictured second from left, above) plays homicide detective Norbert Beryl, who gives us a heavy dose of foreshadowing in episode 1 when he tells Raylan, “Hang around and see how we do things in Detroit.” Butz is a two-time Tony Award winner for best actor. You might also recognize him from his on-screen roles, including The Girl From Plainville on Hulu, Mercy Street on PBS, and Bloodline on Netflix.\n\nVictor Williams is detective Wendell Robinson, who is just trying to keep his head down until he can retire to Florida, specifically Margaritaville — Jimmy Buffett’s retirement community. Years ago, he helped bring in Clement for the Wrecking Crew murders (a crime for which Clement walked). Wendell is quick to put the pieces together when the Range Rover connected to Judge Guy's murder leads to Sandy's doorstep.\n\nBest-known for his role as Deacon Palmer on the CBS sitcom King of Queens, Williams also appeared in the series The Affair, Sneaky Pete, The Sinner, and Showtime's The Good Lord Bird, among others.\n\nPaul Calderón plays retired detective Raymond Cruz. In 2017, Raymond was the arresting officer when Clement was taken in for the Wrecking Crew murders. Though Raymond is a minor character in the series, his presence is an Easter egg for fans of Elmore Leonard's novels. In the 1980 book , on which the series is based, Raymond, not Raylan, is the protagonist. This is not the first time Calderón has played a detective—he portrayed Jimmy Robertson in the TV series Bosch.\n\nMarin Ireland is detective Maureen Downey, who is also balancing her duties as a wife and mother. She cusses like a sailor, but we see her maternal side when she takes Raylan and Willa into her own home after their hotel is compromised.\n\nYou've previously seen Ireland in Taylor Sheridan’s Hell or High Water and Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman. She has also appeared in multiple series, including Prime Video's Sneaky Pete and season 2 Netflix's The Umbrella Academy.\n\nHe's only in one episode, but Judge Alvin Guy (played by Keith David) and the secrets held in his little black book set the whole plot of this series in motion. A three-time Emmy Award-winning actor, David has also portrayed Bishop James Greenleaf in the OWN series Greenleaf. His many film credits include Barbershop, Men at Work, and Disney's The Princess and the Frog.\n\nAnd as for Judge Guy's unfortunate young assistant—she's portrayed by Rae Gray, who you've seen before in the Prime Video series A League of Their Own.\n\nTrailer\n\nFX's action-packed Justified: City Primeval trailer (above) outlines the basic premise. Adapted from Elmore Leonard’s 1980 novel, , this story lands Raylan temporarily in Detroit with his 15-year-old daughter. He gets pulled in to assist local law enforcement, but things get complicated when the sociopathic Clement Mansell, aka The Oklahoma Wildman, rears his head. “Mansell shows up, bad shit is in the air,” warns Sweety's character in the trailer.\n\nIn the past, Raylan has always landed on his feet, but this particular villain might spell very bad news for everyone's favorite U.S. Marshal: Showrunner Michael Dinner told Entertainment Weekly, \"Raylan's made it this far, but will he survive this? He very well might not.\"\n\n.."
