        "text": "\"What if this world is the only one there is?\"\n\nThis article is written from the real world point of view (not from the Primeval Universe).\n\nThe Primeval title sequence (or opening titles) is the video sequence seen at the beginning of every episode of Primeval. It featured a number of Anomaly shards with pictures of the main cast members in them, accompanied by their names, as well as video clips of the creatures reflected some of the shards.\n\nThe Peter Anderson Studio designed the Series 1 to 3 title sequences although it is unknown if they also did the Series 4 and 5 sequence. The Primeval Theme Tune was played over the top of it.\n\nSeries 1\n\nThose featured in the title sequence for Series 1 are:\n\nVideo: Cast:\n\nDouglas Henshall\n\nJames Murray\n\nAndrew-Lee Potts\n\nLucy Brown\n\nHannah Spearritt\n\nWith Juliet Aubrey and Ben Miller\n\nMark Wakeling (image only)\n\nCreatures:\n\nMosasaur (Episode 1.3)\n\nCoelurosauravus (Episode 1.1)\n\nDodo (x-ray) (Episode 1.4)\n\nPteranodon (Episode 1.5)\n\nGorgonopsid (Episode 1.1)\n\nNotes:\n\nThe very start of the title sequence was adjusted differently in each episode to compensate for the \"previously\" segment. The theme tune was adjusted for the same reason.\n\nSeries 2\n\nThose featured in the title sequence for Series 2 are:\n\nVideo: Cast:\n\nDouglas Henshall\n\nJames Murray\n\nAndrew-Lee Potts\n\nLucy Brown\n\nHannah Spearritt\n\nWith Juliet Aubrey and Ben Miller\n\nKarl Theobald (image only)\n\nCreatures:\n\nFuture Predator (Episode 1.6)\n\nCoelurosauravus (Episode 1.1)\n\nDodo (x-ray) (Episode 1.4)\n\nRaptor (Episode 2.1)\n\nSmilodon (Episode 2.3)\n\nNotes:\n\nThis series used the same cast images as the last series, except for Lucy Brown, due to playing a different character.\n\nAll except two of the creature video clips were changed.\n\nThe Anomaly shards had a light blue tinge unlike the grey in Series 1 and 3.\n\nSeries 3\n\nThose featured in the title sequence for Series 3 are:\n\nVideos: Cast:\n\nDouglas Henshall\n\nAndrew-Lee Potts (image of Brown)\n\nLucy Brown (image of Potts)\n\nHannah Spearritt\n\nLaila Rouass\n\nWith Juliet Aubrey and Ben Miller\n\nDouglas Henshall\n\nAndrew-Lee Potts (image of Brown)\n\nLucy Brown (image of Potts)\n\nHannah Spearritt\n\nLaila Rouass\n\nWith Juliet Aubrey, Jason Flemyng (name only) and Ben Miller\n\nJason Flemyng\n\nAndrew-Lee Potts (image of Brown)\n\nLucy Brown (image of Potts)\n\nHannah Spearritt\n\nLaila Rouass\n\nWith Juliet Aubrey and Ben Miller\n\nJason Flemyng\n\nAndrew-Lee Potts (image of Spearritt)\n\nHannah Spearritt (image of Potts)\n\nLaila Rouass\n\nBen Mansfield\n\nWith Juliet Aubrey and Ben Miller\n\nCreatures:\n\nCamouflage Beast (Episode 3.2)\n\nMer Creature (Episode 2.4)\n\nSilurian Scorpion (Episode 2.5)\n\nColumbian Mammoth (Episode 2.6)\n\nPristichampsus (Episode 3.1) (Wakeling/Theobald shard)\n\nFuture Predator (Episode 2.7)\n\nNotes:\n\nThe casts images were changed to promos instead of screenshots.\n\nBen Mansfield was a main character in every episode but was not credited in the intro until Episode 3.6 onwards.\n\nThe Wakeling/Theobald shard changed to a creature clip instead of a cast's image.\n\nThe creature clips were all updated to Series 2 creatures and two Series 3 creatures.\n\nSeries 4 and Series 5\n\nFor these series of Primeval, after its it's cancellation, a new type introduction video was made. It was based on the original type but was more three dimensional and the Anomaly shards were changed from black and grey to orange and gold. The cast's names were still shown, but their images were not, only video clips of creatures were shown including the sound produced by the creatures in the clips. The Theme Tune was recomposed to compensate for the shorter title sequence.\n\nThose featured in the title sequence for Series 4 and Series 5 are:"
