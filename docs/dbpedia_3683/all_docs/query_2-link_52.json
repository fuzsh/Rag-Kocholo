        "meta_description": "Primeval New Zealand - This award-winning documentary from NHNZ reveals new information about the origins of the iconic kiwi. Presenter Peter Elliott travels the country investigating how &amp;quot;evolutionary mutants&amp;quot; — like giant meat-eating snails, kiwi, and tuatara — evolved over 20 million years in the face of massive tectonic upheavals and extreme isolation.  Elliott answers why Aotearoa has the &amp;quot;weirdest creatures&amp;quot;, such as birds that don&#39;t fly and mammals that do. Company Weta Workshop used computer graphics to create images of extinct creatures for this TV One documentary.",
