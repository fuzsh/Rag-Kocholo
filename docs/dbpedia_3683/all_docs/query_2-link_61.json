        "text": "New series of the science fiction drama. After a year in the Cretaceous period, Abby and Connor find a lost anomaly device in a raptor's bower and finally escape back to their own time - only to be followed through by a giant spinosaurus. They soon meet up with a brand new ARC team, but being away for so long has left them out of the loop and they find their jobs in jeopardy.With Ciaran McMenamin, Hannah Spearritt, Andrew Lee-Potts, Ben Mansfield, and Ruth Kearney.\n\nEscaping cancellation by the skin of it's teeth the Science Fiction drama returned, thanks to a unusual agreement between TV stations securing not just one but two seasons of the show. It has always been claimed that ratings were not the reason for cancellation rather the cost of producing such an effects heavy show.\n\nPrimeval always came across as chewing gum drama, good for a little while then throw it away and forget; the last series ending with the only two regulars who have been with the show since the past, Abby and Connor trapped in the distant past along with team mate Danny Quinn, although they were separated, all three apparently trapped.\n\nI'm not sure what has happened, whether it was the confidence in being considered good enough to be rescued (show wise - not character) or just the surety of two UK size seasons to work with, or even the production being moved to Ireland, or maybe just a show growing into itself but it was a lot more than had gone before.\n\nBetter characterisation, more competent storytelling and solid new sets just seemed to come together and make Primeval gel. Time has moved on Connor and Abby have been lost for a year, The ARC base has been rebuilt and become and improved military organisation, ironically one now co-funded by the private sector. They still move in on the anomalies, deal with the time travelling threats that come through, but most of the long term team are damaged by the loss of the core of the original team.\n\nThere's good humour, some great set pieces and the Spinosaurus looks incredible.\n\nWhether or not the show can maintain the quality set by the opening episode remains to be seen, but it looks like it might have deserved to have been rescued after all, a flavour worth trying again.\n\nRe: Primeval Season 4 Episode 2\n\nObviously Primeval does not have the same fan base as other shows watched by us on the Chrons, but it still can be a lot of fun.\n\nUnfortunately episode 2 seems to a bit of a return to the monster of the week of previous seasons. That being said, the character interaction is solid and an improvement on previous years, and as the episode is pretty much the conclusion of establishing the new set up it might be given the benefit of the doubt.\n\nOnce again the prehistoric monster is done very well, and there are some good dramatic and off camera gruesome moments. The humour continues and mostly works well. There are a few hints (and more than hints) or personal agendas, so seeds are being planted.\n\nThe episode wraps up with Abby and Connor back in the fold and the set up re-established meaning that we can hopefully the show can grow.\n\nNext weeks looks like it might be a step in the right direction - lizard men???\n\nRe: Primeval Season 4 Episode 3\n\nSo, if the first two episodes were re-establishing the status quo, this third episode was the chance that the show was given to give us something new, take things in a new direction.\n\nToo my surprise it actually seemed to be trying to do something different, there were familiar tropes used, but an awful lot going on, asking questions, presenting new ideas (for Primeval) and opening a couple of new plot threads that might take it through to the end of the current run.\n\nUnlike some other shows this episode presented us with a series of new questions but answered them at least slightly:\n\nWhen an anomaly opens in an old theatre we are treated to a surprise when a group of humans walk through rather than the monster of the week - that follows, but it is a type of reptile that I've never seen before, some form of dinosaur monkey - whether fictional or not is for someone else to say.\n\nSoon we have the standard run of the mill monster chase, with the running new thread of Matt and his mysterious benefactor being deepened; the mystery of the woman who came through the anomaly who is she and what does she and the others represent; meanwhile Connor working on the ARC's upgraded security system accidently triggers a lock down, which leads to a mad rush to try and release everyone - and the hint that there is something else going on Project New Dawn.\n\nSo overall a lot more than I was expecting, I enjoyed the episode a lot more than I thought I would perhaps showing there could be a future for it. On the other hand the effects/cgi was ropey in places.\n\nHmmm, just because someone has a different agenda doesn't necessarily make him the bad guy (Okay I'm probably going to have trouble justifying that to myself, but Doctor Bashir just can't be a bad guy)\n\nI'm agree with what you say Anthorn to a degree, Primeval is never (unless something miraculous happens) going to be the best show on a Saturday night, but it is what it is, jelly bean entertainment. All that I say is in context to that, and I do think it is better than it has been.\n\n(Still, if Doctor Who was on the other side, or even Merlin, I know which one I would have watched.)\n\nDo you remember series 3 with Helen when they introduced a plot in episode one, and then forgot about it for a few episodes. When it came back it wasn't the same plot as before and made no sense (the whole kill the first humans)\n\nOh definitely, and I'm sure there are other little things too. At the same time it is just rife with possibilities and it's so frustrating that they never take them, when it started it was meant to be a show centred around Nick Cutter and it has deviated so far from that....\n\nRe: Primeval Season 4 Episode 4\n\nThings seemed back to the same old rut in this latest episode, monster springs up, team goes in to investigate and close the rift, hunt monster down, possible complications, conclusion.\n\nThis does not a bad episode make, but certainly not a good one, straight line average across the board.\n\nBut there were some good points, seeing the annoying girl actually get taken by the dino-mammals was a brave choice so often in this type of thing we get a last minute rescue where kids/teenagers are concerned. The fact that there were so many of the creatures made up for some of the standard situations. It almost made the end exciting!\n\nOngoing season - arcs were slim, but were developed slightly.\n\nBut in the end Ben Miller saved the show from being anything less than average, He appears so rarely each episode, but there is something about him/his character that just works for me elevating any scene he is in.\n\n\"That mammoth once saved my life, it only seemed right that I somehow returned the favour!\"\n\nSo the guy played by the guy from Deep space Nine turned out to be the bad guy, well done Primeval you did something no one exp...............I'm sorry I am a terrible liar. It was so obvious he would be the baddy from episode one.\n\nAnd what was with the vanishing extras in the last two episodes? They were at the wedding in one scene then vanished for no reason and left their vans.\n\nBecker trapped with that bomb. Nope they wern't there either.\n\nIntruder alert someone is in the arc.\n\nLets just send one guy after him, it's not like we're that good at keeping secrets anyway. Plus its our lunch break."
