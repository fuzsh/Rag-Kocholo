What’s American Primeval about?

Prepare for violent collisions of cultures, religions, and communities as men and women fight and die for control of this new world — and for a land they truly believe is their destiny. “We are very appreciative that Netflix is trusting us to take a big swing with American Primeval,” director and executive producer Pete Berg (Friday Night Lights, Lone Survivor) told Netflix. “I’m looking forward to taking viewers into the most dynamic, intense, and heart-pounding survival tale humanly possible. We are going into the belly of the beast.”

American Primeval is Berg’s first project under his first-look deal with Netflix and is written by Mark L. Smith (The Midnight Sky, The Revenant, Overlord), with Eric Newman (Griselda, Narcos, The Watcher) serving as showrunner and executive producer. This also marks the second collaboration between Berg, Newman, and Kitsch, who worked together on the limited series Painkiller, which premiered on service in 2023.
