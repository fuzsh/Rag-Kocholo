The Dream Mile 2007’s local beneficiary is Kids Coming Home, a program that provides training and support for foster care and adoptive families.

The event is Sunday, July 8, at Shoreline Park, 3070 N. Shoreline Blvd., Mountain View. Check-in and race-day registration will open at 7:30 a.m. The run and walk start at 8:30 a.m., and family festivities begin at 9 a.m.
