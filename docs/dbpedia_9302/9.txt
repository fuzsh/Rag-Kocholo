A Shoreline Dream. Denver. July 9

Text & photo by Robert Castro

Last night I had the opportunity to witness a transformational night of music, compliments of Denver’s own A Shoreline Dream and German import Ulrich Schnauss. A Shoreline Dream opened their set with an awe-inspiring dream-rock sound that is often compared to Sigur Rós and Vast (lead singer Ryan Policky even going as far as to wearing a Vast t-shirt during their set). The intimate crowd seemed to be riding a tidal wave of musical bliss that was coming from this four-piece outfit. With atmospheric guitar riffs and sonic bass lines, in addition to Policky’s chiseled vocals, it’s no wonder the band has received various accolades from the press, even recording with master producer Schnauss, who took the stage with them for the song “neverChanger” off the EP of the same name.

If I could describe Ulrich Schnauss’ music, I would say it is Herbie Hancock meets Hans Zimmer. At times during his set I, like many others in the crowd, found myself in a euphoric state enjoying the masterpiece of sound he was creating. With complementing visuals, Ulrich conducted his one-man orchestra to the tune of electronic bleeps and beats mixed in with a touch of ambient techno. It was a rare opportunity to catch these two performances in a single night; nonetheless the crowd absorbed every square-inch of musical mastery served to them.
