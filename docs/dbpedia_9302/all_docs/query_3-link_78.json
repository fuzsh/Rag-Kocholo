        "text": "During the summer months, I spend every weekend an hour south of L.A. in my hometown of Laguna Beach. I enjoy being close to the ocean on longer summer days, and it’s such a nice time of year to be near my family (not to mention how much my pups Chloe and Fitz love a good beach run every morning). Since I do spend a lot of time in Orange County, I often get friends, family and even LaurenConrad.com readers asking me for my top recommendations for where to eat, what to do, and where to stay in this beachside town. And while we have done an L.A. city guide here on the blog (and several other cities, here), it recently hit me that I have never shared my Laguna Beach recommendations. So, I sat down and made a list of my favorite spots for all of you who may be making a trip here this summer. I must say, it was a pretty fun process because it inspired me to do a mini staycation in my very own city!\n\nA tad more casual than Rooftop and The Deck, The Cliff is one of those happy hour spots you might even stumble upon without realizing. Hidden within a maze of outdoor shops right off PCH, The Cliff is the perfect destination if you’re looking for cocktails and live music on those evenings when you haven’t even changed out of your bathing suit yet.\n\nOkay, fun fact for you all: My very first summer job was working as an usher at Pageant of the Master’s! The Pageant of the Master’s is an annual arts festival in Laguna that is most famous for its “living pictures” performance, where people are dressed in costume and makeup to literally imitate art. That’s all I will tell you because you’ll have to see it to believe it."
