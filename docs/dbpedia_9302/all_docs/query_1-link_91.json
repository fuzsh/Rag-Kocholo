        "text": "The Bronx Kill is not an event, but a place. All the same, the slender, ankle-high creek does mark a fatality: the South Bronx waterfront, which has been blocked and buried by rail yards, highways, caravans of garbage trucks and warehouses.\n\nAs a result, the tip of the Bronx -- the beginning (or end) of the city's link to the mainland -- is graced not by a majestic sea wall, boulevard or park, but is hidden under a railroad bridge and bordered by tall weeds and rusting fences. There are no gentle zephyrs or rustling reeds, only the knockout stench of garbage and the dull rumble of passing trains.\n\nThe souls who inhabit the two communities packed into the tip of the Bronx -- Port Morris and Mott Haven -- must live with this peculiar albatross, where they have water, water everywhere, yet not a spot to glimpse it. More often than not, the closest they can get is the fenced-off wall of a dead-end street.\n\n''I know there must be waterfront, because we got five bridges,'' said Joe Perez, counting the crossings that head toward Mott Haven, where he has lived for 25 years. ''That's a lot of water. But we can't get to it.''\n\nThis is no small, irksome thing, but a near obsession in a community that is among the city's most densely populated but has little open space to enjoy. It would be a wonder just to be able to focus on a distant shore.\n\n''It is like meditation,'' Mr. Perez said, ''like when you go to the beach and are really uptight. Watch the water. It calms you down. It's part of ourselves. We come from water. It calls us.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
