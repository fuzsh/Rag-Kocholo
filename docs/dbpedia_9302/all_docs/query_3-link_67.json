        "text": "The birthplace of American space exploration and the hub of Florida’s space industry, Brevard County boasts generations of high-tech talent along with the largest share of STEM-related jobs in Florida. Situated in the middle of major space, air, sea, road and rail corridors, Florida’s Space Coast offers an attractive tax and wage climate enticing a variety of industries. Home to several colleges and universities, including the renowned Florida Institute of Technology, the Space Coast encompasses 72 miles of pristine beach and an average temperature of 73 degrees. Florida’s Space Coast is an alluring location to live, work and play.\n\nSpace Coast Association of REALTORS\n\nThe Space Coast Association of REALTORS®, The Voice for Real Estate in Brevard County®, is the largest professional trade organization providing services to the local REALTOR® community since 1959. With a membership base of over 6,000 REALTORS and Business Partner Members, we are committed to upholding a strict Code of Ethics in our interactions with one another and the general public.\n\nWe are proud to be The Voice for Real Estate in Brevard County®, and look forward to serving our members and the Space Coast for many years to come. Vision: Space Coast Association of REALTORS® is the trusted voice of real estate in our community.\n\nMission: Space Coast Association of REALTORS® exists to support our members’ success as real estate professionals while advocating for private property rights and the ethical practice of real estate. Values: Membership // Professionalism // Leadership // Advocacy // Outreach\n\nEastern Florida State College\n\nRecognized as one of Florida’s top state colleges for innovative and cutting-edge programs, we see education as a partnership to help students launch their academic and career goals. That’s why more than 18,000 students choose to take classes at EFSC annually. Our Bachelor and Associate Degrees, and short-term career training certificates prepare students for the workforce quickly. With so many choices, EFSC is the perfect place for recent high school graduates, and a great match for adults who want to change careers or enhance their workforce skills with the help of our advanced degrees and vocational training.\n\nBlue Origin\n\nBlue Origin’s vision is enabling a future where millions of people are living and working in space for the benefit of Earth. Blue Origin is working on this today by developing partially and fully reusable launch vehicles, engines and space systems that are safe, low cost, and serve the needs of all civil, commercial and defense customers. Blue Origin’s footprint on the Space Coast continues to grow with an investment of more than $3 billion in facilities and infrastructure at all sites, including $1 billion invested in the rebuild of historic LC-36, which was completed in October of 2021. For more information about Blue Origin, visit www.blueorigin.com.\n\nNorth American Properties\n\nWhat makes a place great? North American Properties believes that it all comes down to connections – people to each other; to their souls; partners to opportunities; and individuals to experiences that move them. We believe that by fulfilling people’s desire for connectedness, we’re creating happier places and experiences that in turn become more successful environments, more vibrant communities and ultimately, a better world. Since 1954, we’ve balanced a well-capitalized approach and a keen focus on successful execution with a willingness to question conventional wisdom, reimagining and expanding the possibilities for more than $7 billion of assets across the US.
