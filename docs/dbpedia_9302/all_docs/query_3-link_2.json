        "text": "Spoiler warning:\n\nThe following page contains spoilers for the plot of the Dream SMP.\n\nThis page is about the character from the Dream SMP. For the YouTuber who plays this character, see Dream. For the SMP that the Dream Team and their friends play on, see Dream SMP. For the canon protector counterpart, see DreamXD/SMP. For the Mexican counterpart, see Mexican Dream.\n\nDream is the founder of the Dream SMP, the server's owner, and its first member. He joined on April 24, 2020. He was previously the leader of the Dream SMP faction before being deposed during the Disc Confrontation.\n\nHe opposed TommyInnit and Wilbur Soot in the Dream Team SMP vs. L'Manberg War and the Manberg vs Pogtopia War, instigated Tommy's exile, allied with Technoblade and Ph1LzA during the Doomsday War, and instigated some of the key conflicts of the Disc Saga. Dream is arguably known as the server's best duelist, the other top contender being Technoblade.\n\nDream planned his later defeat during the Disc Confrontation by Tommy and the rest of the server, and was imprisoned in Pandora's Vault under the eye of its warden, Awesamdude. Dream, along with Punz, currently possesses the only method of revival, given to him by Schlatt, and was being tortured for the information by Quackity until his eventual escape.\n\nOn November 28, 2021, Dream was broken out of Pandora's Vault by Technoblade and The Syndicate. He later took the abandoned prison as his base, where he planned his revenge and did testing to find out all the knowledge of the world.\n\nPhysiology\n\nAppearance\n\nDream's in-game appearance is a white smiley-face blob on a light green background. However, DreamXD called Dream a human,[2] and Dream confirmed while talking to Tommy in Pandora's Vault that he wears a mask in canon.[10]\n\nPersonality\n\nDream is an excellent strategist, and is incredibly well-composed most of the time. Nonetheless, emotions do play a large role especially when it comes to quick decisions.[11] Dream is a natural leader, seasoned in the art of military combat and is often never seen without fully enchanted armor and several weapons. He is mysterious by nature, taking care to mask his true intentions and hide behind his composed persona.[12]\n\nTowards most server members, Dream is generally reserved, misleading others into believing he has certain goals and characteristics.[12] This was especially apparent during the Disc Confrontation, when he made almost the entire server think that he wanted to use others' attachments to control them, even though this was never true.[13][14][15] After reviving Tommy, he acted surprised that he was able to do so and claimed that he was a god.[16] In reality, Dream and Punz had extensively tested the Revival Book before, and Dream already knew that it worked.[17] Dream only shows his true personality and motives when it suits him, but frequently does so around allies like Punz and Technoblade.\n\nMotivations\n\nAbove all else, Dream used to hope to unite the server as \"one big happy family\", where no nations existed and everyone was part of the Dream SMP.[18][19] He was willing to use violence in the past to achieve this, such as when he denied L'Manberg their independence.[20] Dream still tried to further this goal during the Manberg Rebellion. It was during this time that Dream became more involved in destruction and chaos, aiming to disrupt the status quo.[21][22][23] This was all in the hope that in the end, neither Manberg or Pogtopia would exist and everyone would just be part of the Dream SMP.[24] In a discussion with Punz later on, they both agreed that the goal was always to have one united server.[18] In his heart, Dream wants everyone to be friends again.[25] However, he lost track of this idea as his hatred of nations and infighting grew, and Dream eventually concluded that they just needed to restart.[26][27]\n\nDream's greatest fear is being alone.[25][28] After obtaining the Revival Book, Dream and Punz's main goal became to learn all the mysteries of the world.[29] They wanted to figure out everything that was unknown, what life was and how death worked. Dream sees knowledge as something beautiful, and aims to live forever with Punz to have time to learn everything.[30] Dream intends to know everything so that everyone can be invincible and live together forever.[31] That way, Dream would never be alone.[25] As he and Punz learned more about the world, Dream realized the seperation of knowledge between them and the other server members, and began to see them as simple-minded people who barely knew anything.[32]\n\nHaving power and control is something that Dream enjoys, as he can use this for his plans. He liked the feeling of power and control that he got when he forced Tubbo to exile his friend Tommy.[33] When he gets the opportunity, Dream tries to have other people be in his debt. Through this debt, he can have control and power over them. This was the primary reason that Dream saved Technoblade during the latter's execution. It was also part of his motivation for reviving Wilbur. Wilbur was alive because of Dream and would forever be in his debt, which Dream could use in the future. Dream does not want to lose this feeling of power and would go far to retain it.[11]\n\nMorality\n\nDream has a complicated view on morality, in particular on the notion of good and evil. He believes there is a fine line between good and evil and that it is hard to separate them. Dream is bitter about how most server members never consider whether he has reasons for any of his actions. They think that he has always been \"pure evil\", pushing him into the role of a villain again and again. He started lashing out when everything and everybody he cared about was attacked and taken from him. Now that he has nothing left, he will not stop lashing out until he is killed.[34] Dream does not think of himself as evil, regarding a truly evil person as somebody that does terrible things without reason or just because they enjoy them.[35]\n\nTo accomplish his goal of obtaining knowledge, Dream is pragmatic and utterly ruthless to both others and himself. Dream has an \"ends justify the means\" attitude. He believes that anyone's pain and suffering is only temporary and will not matter in the end. Due to this, he does not care about his own pain or anyone else's pain.[31] This can be seen in how he and Punz experimented on Vikkstar and LazarBeam for months to test the Revival Book.[17][36] Dream was also willing to kill himself to learn about what limbo was like.[37] To make it seem like Punz had betrayed him, Dream let Tommy take two of his canon lives and let himself get locked up in Pandora's Vault.[38][18][14][39] However, Dream is protective of his allies, taking the blame for Ranboo blowing up the Community House and asking Punz to pretend to betray him to keep Punz safe.[40][41][42]\n\nIn the past, Dream considered himself to be a peacekeeper who tried to solve every problem on the server.[43] While he has not taken this role in a while now, he still believes that he has good reasons for even the bad things that he does.[44] Dream sees most bad actions as being a matter of perspective. Somebody can be a good person in some people's perspectives and a bad person in others'. Dream believes that nobody is a good person and that everyone on the server has done bad things. He sees himself as a bad person, because he thinks it is necessary to be one in order to not get killed.[45][46] Dream often tries to make others understand that he did everything for a good reason, with varying degrees of success.[19][47][48]\n\nTrauma\n\nWhile in prison, Dream was tortured every day for months by Quackity to force him to give up the Revival Book,[49] and was starved and isolated by Sam for nearly a year.[50] This had a lasting impact on Dream's health.\n\nDream generally acts like nothing that happened in the prison had any effect on him, brushing his experiences off or using them to achieve specific goals. Dream told Sapnap about the torture to make himself seem reasonable and make Sapnap understand why he had to escape from prison.[51] He told Foolish about it to make it clear that Quackity could not be trusted and that Dream was capable and competent for not breaking from the torture.[52] When telling the other person does not have the desired effect, Dream quickly moves past it and drops the topic.[53] However, Dream told Punz that Quackity had done \"unspeakable things\" to him in the prison,[54] and BadBoyHalo heard him screaming and saw Dream shaking and being unwilling to talk while in prison.[55] When Foolish asked Dream about giving the Revival Book away, Dream immediately backed away from him and went quiet.[56]\n\nEver since he escaped prison, Dream has become terrified for his safety. He let Punz talk to Purpled to secure his help in taking revenge on Quackity, even though this risked Punz's cover.[57] Dream also secretly started living in the prison again because he feels that this is the only place where he can be safe,[58] as he is afraid that people will kill him in his sleep.[59] Despite that, he let the prison decay and deteriorate and kept living in the prison even after multiple other people found out that it is his base.[60][61]\n\nDream uses his old role as \"the villain\" to show everyone that he is still powerful and should not be messed with. He did this when he encountered Tommy in Logstedshire,[62] as well as with Sam when Sam was locked in prison, calling himself the evil that was released from Pandora's Box.[63] While Dream dislikes how others dehumanize him and do not even see him as a person,[64][65] he has partially internalized this. He compares himself to a \"pure evil\" snake that bites without reason,[66] and disagreed with Tommy after Tommy said he realized that Dream was not the villain.[67]\n\nThere are several physical problems that Dream was left with as well. He has memory issues, finding it hard to remember what happened while he was imprisoned.[68][69] He cannot remember some details from before the prison either, such as how he obtained the Axe of Peace during the Disc Confrontation.[70] Tommy and Tubbo noticed that Dream seemed slow and out of practice while fighting him in the prison,[71] and they thought he was not mentally well for choosing to live in his own hell.[72]\n\nCharacters similar/related to Dream\n\nThe characters in this list are not different personalities of Dream, but rather separate characters that are not the same as Dream's character in the SMP.\n\nDreamXD\n\nFor the character named DreamXD, see DreamXD/SMP.\n\nDrista\n\nFor Dream's sister, see Drista.\n\nMexican Dream\n\nFor the character named Mexican Dream played by Quackity, see Mexican Dream.\n\nMamacita\n\nGirl Dream (or her Mexican name, Mamacita) is a separate character from Dream who resembles a female version of Dream. Just like Dream, she is capable of defending herself. In her first appearance, she joined Mexican L'Manberg and met Mexican Dream.[73] In her second appearance, she visited Logstedshire along with Mexican Dream. She used to tag along with Mexican Dream, and had a romantic relationship with him until he died.[74]\n\nTom Simmons (NotDream123)\n\nFor the character named Tom Simmons played by Dream, see NotDream123.\n\nAlter Egos\n\nCop Dream\n\nCop Dream is an alter-ego of Dream that appears when he sees people commit crimes. Cop Dream almost exclusively talks through a megaphone. He is also ruthless, attacking the person immediately when the crime is committed. He has the ability to play police sirens whenever he wants, similar to Dream's speedrun music ability.\n\nIn his first appearance, he appeared when Tommy asked Dream to take care of Quackity after Quackity 'stole' Yeezys from their restaurant. Dream turned into Cop Dream, hunting Quackity down and shooting at him until he killed him inside the restaurant.[75]\n\nIn his second appearance, he appeared after Mexican Dream and his accomplices tried to recruit Dream into Mexican L'Manberg by giving him drugs. He started running after them to arrest them for illegal drugs and activities. After a long chase through the Overworld and the Nether, he managed to kill Mexican Dream. He then took the defeated Mexican Dream to the Courthouse and put him on trial. However, his accomplices broke him out and the group escaped to Mexican L'Manberg, safe from Cop Dream.[76]\n\nHe has also appeared twice on one of George's streams.[77]\n\nMugger Dream\n\nMugger Dream is another alter-ego that has appeared twice so far. His first appearance was on Lani's first visit, robbing Quackity.[78] He then appeared in Logstedshire to threaten Mexican Dream.[79]\n\nHistory\n\nEarly Dream SMP Arc\n\nPre-Disc Saga\n\nDream created the SMP with George on April 24, 2020.[80] He is one of the eight original SMP members, along with George, Sapnap, Callahan, Alyssa, Awesamdude, Ponk & BadBoyHalo. Along with the other original seven members of the server, he built the Community House.[81] In addition, Dream built the wooden path from the Community House, now known as the Prime Path, and a room under the house to live in.[82] He had a pet horse, Spirit, who died to mobs while Sapnap was riding them.[83] During this time, the SMP was in a peaceful and carefree era, as most problems were taken care of in the Courthouse. Dream exiled Tommy from the SMP for repeatedly breaking the rules when he first joined, but later allowed Tommy back onto the server.[84]\n\nThe Disc Saga\n\nMain article: The Disc Saga\n\nThe Disc Saga began with Tommy and Sapnap getting into a conflict with Ponk and Alyssa.[85] Dream tried to defuse the conflict, but was killed (non-canonically) instead.[86] In order to gain leverage, he stole Tommy's music discs, Cat and Mellohi, starting the whole saga.[87] Over a long period of time, lots of items were stolen from Dream and Tommy by each other in order to regain the discs.\n\nSocializing Club Conflict\n\nMain article: The Socializing Club Conflict\n\nDream fell into the trap that Purpled had set outside the Socializing Club during the Socializing Club Conflict, causing his sword to end up in Tommy's hands.[88] However, through an agreement, he got his sword back after the conflict.[89]\n\nL'Manberg Independence Arc\n\nEscalation\n\nSee also: L'Manberg\n\nDream did not do many things before the war to increase tensions between him and members of what would eventually become L'Manberg. From the content-creator vantage, he banned villager breeding and iron golem farms after Tubbo built farms for them because they were too overpowered.[90] Dream was not present when other server members stopped the drug empire that Wilbur Soot and Tommy were attempting to create which led directly to the creation of L'Manberg.[91]\n\nDream Team SMP vs. L'Manberg War\n\nDream was the commander of the Dream SMP side during the Dream Team SMP vs. L'Manberg War. As the creator and figurehead of the lands, Dream refused to allow L'Manberg to declare themselves independent of the Dream SMP. As a result, he, with George, Sapnap and Punz, declared war, bombing their land and using Eret's help to backstab them.[92][93] After the final duel by Dream and Tommy was won by Dream, Tommy surrendered his discs, Cat and Mellohi. Dream accepted them in exchange for technical independence, meaning Dream SMP would not recognize them, but would not attack L'Manberg unless there was very good reason to do so.[94] Despite that, Dream had already planned on granting L'Manberg technical independence even before the start of the war.[95]\n\nPost-war\n\nAfter the war, Dream was involved in many small side stories.\n\nJack Manifold joined the server, and Dream attempted to sway Jack's allegiance towards the Dream SMP through bribery. However, Jack ultimately chose L'Manberg and was given the job as ambassador.[96]\n\nWilbur and Tommy built a park in L'Manberg to attract tourists (mainly drug dealers). The only attractions were a drug pond and a bent stone alleyway (the Pufferfish Alleyway), which they used in an attempt to scam Dream out of diamonds.[97]\n\nWilbur and Dream competed in a pub quiz made by Tubbo to figure out who has a higher IQ (although it was more of a trivia) and Wilbur won.[98]\n\nFundy and Niki pranked Tommy's base (L'Manberg Embassy) by giving it a Nether makeover. Dream fixed this in a later stream.[99]\n\nThrough trade with Skeppy, Dream obtained Spirit's (his dead horse) leather in exchange for one of Tommy's prized music discs.[100]\n\nTommy accidentally ran over Dream with a minecart causing a series of events that led to the Railway Skirmish.[101]\n\nDream, George, and Sapnap added onto Tommy's spawn trap in an effort to trap Ponk.[102]\n\nDream hosted a $5000 Deal or No Deal event on the server.[103]\n\nDream, Tommy, Quackity and Tubbo started a new religion dedicated to Twitch Prime. Church Prime and The Vape Tower are built within a new district of the Dream SMP called \"The Subs/The Holy Land.\" The burnt remains of Tubbo's old house are included within the border of this district and act as a heritage site.[104]\n\nDream got scammed by Tommy. Through the scam, Tommy got his Mellohi disc back, as well as Spirit, the leather of Dream's most favored and dead horse. Dream received Beckerson, one of the oldest pets on the server.[105]\n\nDream remodeled the Community House.[106]\n\nThe 2020 L'Manberg Election\n\nMain article: SWAG2020 vs POG2020 Election\n\nWhen Schlatt joined and announced his own campaign, Dream immediately took a stance by providing Schlatt with his bow. The two began hunting down the two POG2020 candidates.[107]\n\nManberg Rebellion Arc\n\nPogtopian alliance\n\nMain article: Manberg Rebellion Arc\n\nAfter the election, Dream quietly supported Pogtopia after realizing that he disliked Schlatt. He gave them many supplies, including his crossbow, \"Definitely Not Penis.\" His reasoning was that Schlatt was a ruler with ambition, unlike Wilbur, and wanted to keep expanding beyond the walls of L'Manberg.[108] As a result, he had an active fighting role in the War of the Burning Eiffel Tower and also provided Wilbur with TNT for his plan to blow up Manberg.[109][110] However, he switched sides after the Manberg Festival due to an agreement with Schlatt where he received the Revival Book.[111]\n\nManberg vs Pogtopia War\n\nMain article: Manberg vs Pogtopia War\n\nDream met with Eret just before the war started, and told Eret that they were just a figurehead so they must remain neutral in the war. He explained to Eret that all he wished was a land undivided; no Pogtopia, no Manberg, only Dream SMP. He also described how Eret only had power because of the members of the Dream SMP backing them, protecting them and giving them power.[112] After Dream got word of Eret's wish to fight with Pogtopia, Dream dethroned them and crowned George as the new king of the Dream SMP, with Callahan as his squire.[113]\n\nWhen the war started, Dream fought against Pogtopia. He eventually turned against Schlatt and revealed Schlatt's location to Pogtopia. After Schlatt's death, Dream sided with Technoblade to help him destroy Manberg with withers and TNT.[114] Dream revealed that he had an agreement with Wilbur, and that Wilbur would have destroyed Manberg no matter the outcome of the war.[115]\n\nRetribution Arc\n\nExile Conflict\n\nMain article: Exile Conflict\n\nSoon after Tommy and Ranboo burned and robbed George's house, Dream built a four-block high obsidian wall around L'Manberg. Since George was the king and his best friend, he took the burning very seriously and wanted Tommy to be punished. He did not agree with Tubbo's decision to only put Tommy on probation and suggested that either Tommy should be exiled or Tubbo should give him Tommy's disc, Mellohi. He gave Tubbo three days to decide the fate of Tommy, after which they would have a meeting to discuss the issue.[116]\n\nThe meeting took place in the Holy Land, where they all agreed to put Tommy on probation for three weeks. However, Tommy claimed that Dream had no power over him, as Dream did not have any of Tommy's discs. Tommy showed that he still had the leather of Spirit, Dream's dead horse, and threatened to burn it if Dream did not take down the obsidian walls. Dream was conflicted and was forced to comply, if only for a few minutes as the L'Manbergians humiliated him. Snapping and realizing that Tommy could forever hold Spirit over his head, Dream then retorted that he did not care about Spirit anymore. All he cared about was Tommy's discs since they gave him power over Tommy. Dream then provided an ultimatum: exile Tommy within three days or he would \"build [the walls] until they've reached the block limit.\"[117]\n\nThe L'Manberg cabinet later complied, giving in to his demands, and Dream escorted Tommy out.[118] Dream rewarded L'Manberg by officially recognizing them as an independent nation for the first time and even offering them support from his faction.[119]\n\nDethronement of George\n\nMain article: Dethronement Fallout\n\nDream proposed that George step down as king because he was constantly being attacked by members of the SMP. He said that the king must be a neutral figure, and that George had instigated conflicts by destroying L'Mantree and by helping build Mexican L'Manberg. George refused, and was supported by Quackity and Sapnap. Sapnap claimed that Dream did not care about him and George anymore, which Dream denied. Dream went through with crowning Eret as king, stating that he did it to protect George.[120] During an argument with Quackity, Dream debated that he had caused no conflict on the SMP, and that Tommy was the instigator of most of the conflicts. Dream painted himself as a peacekeeping figure of the SMP, but Quackity accused Dream of involving himself in every conflict. Dream said that Quackity was not part of the Dream SMP and should not get involved in the dethronement.[43]\n\nBuilding a prison\n\nMain article: Pandora's Vault\n\nSometime after Dream got into possession of the Revival Book, he became paranoid that there might be other people who also had the means of revival. This meant that it might not be possible to stop a powerful person by killing them, since they could just come back. To counter this, Dream came up with the idea of building a prison so that he could lock this potential person up instead.[121] On December 4, 2020,[122] Dream contacted Sam and paid him 64 diamond blocks to build him an inescapable prison.[123] Sam and Dream spent the rest of the month planning and constructing the prison together.[124][125] They decided to name the prison Pandora's Vault after Pandora's box, as it would be a vault that \"contained evil.\"[126]\n\nMexican L'Manberg Conflict\n\nMain article: Mexican L'Manberg-Dream SMP War\n\nOn December 6, 2020, Dream found out that the members of Mexican L'Manberg had stolen Eret's throne and attacked their castle. Dream helped the Knights of Eret destroy a large part of Mexican L'Manberg with TNT in retaliation.[127] As a result, Quackity, Sapnap, and Karl fled to the Holy Land. Dream joined them there for negotiations and accused them of terrorism for attacking Eret's castle. Quackity denied this and said they just wanted their country to be recognized by Dream. Dream said that he had already recognized it and that there was no need for violence to accomplish this. The conflict was resolved with Quackity promising to change Mexican L'Manberg's name so they could start with a clean slate.[128]\n\nPost-Exile Conflict\n\nMain article: Tommy's exile\n\nDream was the only one to consistently visit Tommy during his exile and isolated him on purpose.[129] He intended to make Tommy believe that Dream was his only friend so that Tommy would help Dream's goals.[33] Dream's treatment of Tommy in exile was abusive, with Dream making Tommy give up his armor and weapons every day, and hitting him when he did not comply.[130] Eventually, after finding out Tommy had been keeping a secret stash of items from him, Dream blew the items and all of Logstedshire up, and then forbade him from entering the Nether and left.[131] As a result, Tommy built a tower and was going to jump off it, but changed his mind at the last moment when he realized that Dream had been manipulating him and had never been his friend. He then left Logstedshire since Dream had said he would not visit him every day anymore, and therefore would not know that Tommy had left.[132]\n\nTechnoblade's execution\n\nMain article: Technoblade's execution\n\nDream played an important role in assisting Technoblade with his escape from his execution.\n\nHaving caught wind of the Butcher Army's plan to execute Technoblade, Dream told Technoblade to meet atop the mountain where they had met for the first time. Although there was initially some tension between the two, this subsided, and Dream warned Technoblade that there were bounty hunters after him. He gave him a map that led Technoblade to a woodland mansion where he managed to collect two Totems of Undying.[133]\n\nThe next day, during Technoblade's execution, Dream and Punz assisted Techno with his escape. Dream led Techno and his horse Carl to the Final Control Room, where he had left some items for Techno to help him escape and fight off enemies. Due to this, Technoblade owed Dream a favor.[134]\n\nMeeting with Punz\n\nOn December 17, 2020, Dream called Punz to go for a walk with him. Punz was the only one loyal to Dream throughout the history of the SMP, often acting as his right-hand man. Although this loyalty was achieved through a mercenary agreement, with Dream paying Punz vast amounts of wealth for his allegiance, both parties admitted that it had grown to more than just a money contract. Punz noted that they had formed a strong friendship and that he would still be loyal to Dream even if not for the money.[135]\n\nDuring the walk, Dream proposed that Punz should appear to turn against him, as Dream feared that Punz would not be safe while on Dream's side. Dream suggested that they could plan a scripted event, where Dream would do something hurtful to Punz, and Punz would pretend to be hurt and leave his side. That way, Punz would not get targeted but could still provide intel for Dream.[136]\n\nThe walk reached its end at Pandora's Vault. Dream explained to Punz that the vault, at the time, was only known by a few trusted members of the SMP, and explained its usage. Dream confirmed that no one in L'Manberg, except for Quackity, knew about the prison, and Quackity did not suspect or know the true intentions and purpose of it. He reminded Punz that the goal was always for \"one united server,\" or \"one giant family\"; everyone followed the same rules, and there were no countries. He said that there was something he would do soon that no one would like him for, then named Punz as leader of the Dream SMP, as he did not want his faction to start crumbling.[137]\n\nSearching for Tommy\n\nDuring the walk with Punz, Dream told him that he had discovered that Tommy had left his exile location. After blowing up Logstedshire, he had realized an hour later that he had made a mistake in leaving Tommy alone. When Dream had returned to Logstedshire, Tommy was nowhere to be seen. There was a forest that Tommy had chopped down but Dream had lost his trail after that. Dream said he would try to find Tommy and asked Punz to keep his eyes peeled as well, which Punz promised he would do.[138]\n\nThe next day on December 18, 2020, Dream messaged Techno that he was on the way to his cabin as he needed to have a chat with him. Since Tommy was staying at Techno's cabin, Techno threw an invisibility potion on him and told him to hide. After arriving at the cabin, Dream explained that Tommy had left his exile and asked whether Techno had seen him. Techno lied that he had not seen Tommy and allowed Dream to look around the cabin. Dream then mentioned how Techno owed him a favor as he had saved him during his execution and asked him to keep an eye out for Tommy.[139]\n\nOn December 19, 2020, Dream encountered Ghostbur near Techno's cabin. Dream had found Ghostbur's sheep, Friend, near L'Manberg and led him back to Ghostbur. When Dream approached Techno's cabin, Tommy drank an invisibility potion and hid from Dream again. Dream searched through the cabin while Ghostbur kept accidentally hinting that Tommy lived there. Dream eventually found Tommy's room below the basement and told Ghostbur that he knew Tommy had been there. He then left the cabin.[140]\n\nDream's Evil Lair\n\nMain article: Dream's Evil Lair\n\nOn December 20, 2020, Dream visited Techno at his cabin once again. He told him how he had been there with Ghostbur the previous day, making Techno request that Dream stop trespassing on his property. Dream conceded and told Techno that he knew Tommy lived with him, but that he did not care as long as Tommy did not go to L'Manberg. Techno then proceeded to question if Dream had a house, asking if he was actually homeless, which Dream denied. Dream got more and more annoyed as Techno kept insisting that he was homeless. Later when Dream had left, Techno took an invisibility potion and followed him. He discovered that Dream was building a house made of a mixture of cobblestone and wood (temporarily changed into diamond blocks), which he would deem \"Dream's evil lair.\" Dream blew up the entire house after Techno kept secretly leading creepers towards it, causing them to damage the house.[141]\n\nNether portal confrontation\n\nA week later on December 27, 2020, Dream awaited Techno and Tommy at the central Nether portal. He told Tommy that he was not supposed to be there and revealed that he had obtained one of Tommy's discs from Skeppy. Tommy tried to confront Dream about what he had done to him during his exile, but Dream said he had been the only person who had visited him and who had been his friend. Tommy had left his exile and had then started causing problems. Dream threatened to burn Tommy's disc if Tommy did not come with him. However, Techno intervened and said he could not let Dream take Tommy away since he and Tommy still had plans together. Despite that, he would back off if Dream chose to call in his favor. Dream refused and let the two go, stating that he had something in mind for the favor later.[142]\n\nGreen Festival\n\nMain article: Green Festival\n\nThe Green Festival was a festival held on January 5, 2021, that was planned by the Butcher Army as a secret plot to kill Dream. They believed that Dream would respect the L'Manberg law and show up at the Green Festival without any armor. However, as the L'Manberg festival was ongoing with festival games, Dream started to build obsidian walls around the country, something that he only did when punishing the country. As the citizens swarmed to question his actions, Dream said that Tommy had messed up, before leading the citizens to the Community House. It was revealed that the Community House was blown up and destroyed, something Dream accused Tommy of doing. Dream demanded that Tommy be punished for his actions and said that he needed the disc that Tubbo had, as otherwise he would still be affiliated with Tommy.[143]\n\nAfter being told to do so by Tommy, Tubbo ended up giving Tommy's Mellohi disc to Dream. Tommy then betrayed Technoblade to be on Tubbo's side. This led to Dream asking Techno to join him in destroying L'Manberg. The duo declared war on L'Manberg, announcing that they would destroy the country the next day. Techno returned to his cabin, where Dream visited him shortly after. Techno showed Dream his vault where he kept his wither skeleton skulls, although he had put most of the skulls in his ender chest. After discussing the plan for the next day, Dream thanked Techno for his help and left.[144]\n\nDoomsday War\n\nMain article: Doomsday War\n\nPrior to the war, Dream set up an obsidian grid above L'Manberg as per his wish to blow up the country with duplicate TNT in a TNT system. However, as he knew the redstone contraption and redstone could be easily removed and destroyed, he decided not to place the needed dispensers, redstone and repeaters just yet. Instead, he asked Technoblade to help him stall for time for around 20 minutes as he set up the TNT above L'Manberg.\n\nAfter Technoblade and Philza had managed to stall the opposing side with the Hound Army, strong armor, weapons and even withers, TNT started to rain from the sky in multiple areas of L'Manberg. Dream had finished his contraption and started his mission to create \"chunk errors\" through explosions. He used repeaters and redstone, along with dispensers, to create a continuous flow of lit TNT raining down into the country. The TNT would continue falling down for around 10 minutes, before they would slow down, with duplicate TNT only falling from one station to another, as Dream would go back and forth refilling dispensers. In the end, L'Manberg was successfully blown up, declaring victory for his side.[145]\n\nMoving far\n\nAs the battle finally started to die down, Tubbo and Tommy climbed up to the obsidian grid to destroy the circuits once again. Dream was still on the grid and activated the dispenser nearest to them, taunting the duo with the constant falling of TNT. He explained that he had blown up L'Manberg so the server would be at peace. To avoid the wave of frustration that he was sure Tommy would have, Dream said he would go far away for a while. Nevertheless, he told Tommy that he was not done with him, and that while L'Manberg's story was over, his story with Tommy was not.[146]\n\nThe Revival Book Tests\n\nAt an unknown point before the Disc Confrontation, Dream met with Punz to discuss the Revival Book. Since they had no way to tell if the book actually worked, Dream proposed that they should test it on Vikkstar and LazarBeam, as they were one of the few people whose deaths would go unnoticed. Dream and Punz forcefully brought Vikk and Lazar to a secret lab where they were both killed multiple times. The Revival Book was able to successfully revive them and bring them back.[17] They performed tests for months, killing Vikk and Lazar in any way they could think of.[36] When they were done with the experiments, Punz and Dream permanently killed Vikk and Lazar to keep anyone from finding out about the Revival Book.[17]\n\nEmpowerment Arc\n\nDisc Confrontation\n\nMain article: Disc Confrontation\n\nThe Disc Confrontation was an event staged by Dream and Punz to get the other server members to lock Dream in Pandora's Vault, making them believe that Punz had betrayed Dream.[14] After the Doomsday War, Dream turned Tommy's house into burning netherrack. He also left signs and a lodestone compass there. The signs indicated that Tommy and Tubbo were to follow the compass and meet Dream alone if Tommy wanted his discs back.[147] Tommy and Tubbo fought Dream and got Mellohi, but Dream threatened to kill Tubbo if Tommy did not return the disc. Tommy did so and Dream told him it was a fake the entire time. Dream then took Tommy and Tubbo down an elevator to a large blackstone vault, which contained Tommy's real discs. In a corridor of the vault, Dream showed them a collection of all the \"attachments\" that the Dream SMP members had.[148]\n\nDream claimed that his ambition was to take possession of everything which the Dream SMP members had attachment towards, so that he could control everyone. Unlike the others, Dream supposedly separated himself from attachments, leaving him without any vulnerabilities. He said that Tommy was necessary so that he could continue bringing attachment to the server, and that this was essential to his future plans. Dream revealed that he had built a prison and that he supposedly planned to lock Tommy up in there.[149]\n\nDream told Tommy that he intended to kill Tubbo since he no longer needed him, and gave Tommy and Tubbo a chance to say their final goodbyes. While they were saying their goodbyes, several Dream SMP members arrived at Dream's vault - with Punz, Sapnap, Eret, Callahan, Awesamdude, Nihachu, BadBoyHalo, CaptainPuffy, Antfrost, Jack Manifold, HBomb, Quackity, Ranboo, and Ponk all present - to assist Tommy and Tubbo. Dream was forced by Tommy to drop his armor, weapons and potions. Tommy then canonically killed Dream twice, and was about to kill him again when Dream revealed the existence of the Revival Book. Instead of death, Dream was thus sent to Pandora's Vault, just like he and Punz had planned.[150]\n\nEarly imprisonment\n\nInside the prison, the only thing Dream had access to was a chest full of book and quills, a lectern, a cauldron, and a clock in an item frame. Tommy was the first to visit, and planned to visit again three days later.[151] However, it was not until a month later when Tommy visited again. Dream's more frequent visitor was Ranboo, who visited Dream almost exclusively while in his enderwalk state.[152] BadBoyHalo later visited Dream, who showed Bad that he only had a clock for entertainment and that Sam sometimes gave him less food when he burned the clock. Bad left the cell feeling that the conditions in Dream's cell were horrible and wanted to improve them by becoming a prison guard.[153] Ranboo tried visiting again later, but was banned from visiting when he could not remember any of his previous visits.[154] Sapnap also visited, during which Dream refused to speak and instead used a book to communicate. Sapnap warned Dream that if he broke out of prison early, it would be him that would take Dream's final life.[155]\n\nTommy's revival\n\nTommy visited the prison again exactly one month later. During the visit, Tommy proclaimed that he would never visit him again. However, there were explosions during Tommy's visit, so the prison was put into lockdown. During the prison lockdown, Tommy consistently attempted to annoy Dream.[156] On the eighth day of lockdown, Tommy killed his cat when Dream said he cared about it, and stated that he did not believe that the Revival Book was real. Dream then insisted that Tommy should ask Schlatt himself about the book, and proceeded to beat Tommy to death in the cell, causing Tommy to lose his final canon life.[157][158] Sam later claimed when talking to Ranboo that Dream laughed after he killed Tommy. Sam told Ranboo that he did not expect Dream to kill Tommy, as Dream said he needed Tommy and kept talking about Tommy all time.[159]\n\nDream resurrected Tommy on March 4, 2021. Dream asked Tommy what the Afterlife was like, which Tommy told Dream in detail about. Tommy went on to beg Dream not to revive Wilbur and to burn the Revival Book. Dream said he could not burn the book since it was just knowledge in his head. Tommy then wanted to kill Dream, but realized he could not do this because Sam would think Dream had escaped. This would leave Tommy stuck in the cell because of the waivers he had signed at the start. Dream told Tommy that he had killed him to prove that the Revival Book was real, which Tommy felt was the most evil thing Dream had ever done. Dream promised he would call for Sam to let Tommy out, but that he would bring back Wilbur at some point to help Dream escape.[160]\n\nUnexpected visitors\n\nAfter Tommy's revival, Quackity intended to obtain the Revival Book. He went to the prison and made a deal with Sam to get the Revival Book from Dream. Sam gave him access to the \"tools\" of the Warden, and allowed Quackity to bring them into the main cell. After Quackity got into the prison, he went to the main cell and insisted to Dream that he needed the knowledge of how to revive people. Dream screamed for Sam when he noticed that Quackity had weapons. Quackity vowed that he would visit Dream every day to torture him until he gave him the knowledge of what was inside the Revival Book. When Dream refused to give him knowledge of the book, Quackity went through with his promise.[161]\n\nOn April 29, 2021, Tommy went invisibly to the prison with Ghostbur with the intention of killing Dream. Sam spotted Tommy with the Axe of Peace at the cell and made Tommy go on the bridge, leaving Ghostbur behind. Dream started threatening Sam and Tommy to either let him out or he was going to revive Wilbur. Since Sam would not let him out and would not let Ghostbur cross the bridge, Dream then used the Revival Book to revive Wilbur.[162]\n\nImprisoned with Technoblade\n\nA while later, Quackity demanded that Dream write a note asking Technoblade to visit him. Dream, reluctant to betray one of his only allies, resisted against it. However, he folded and agreed to write the note following more torture from Quackity. In exchange, Quackity promised not to torture Dream for the following week.[163]\n\nWhen Techno visited Dream on June 6, 2021, Dream shouted for him to turn around, saying that it was a trap and that Sam and Quackity were working together. As Sam trapped Techno in the same cell, Dream was despondent, citing that Techno was his only way out of the prison. Techno, however, asserted that things would be fine. Unlike Dream, Techno had options since he had friends now. Techno asked Dream for all of the information he had on the prison, and Dream started writing his knowledge down for his new roommate.[164]\n\nA few weeks later, Dream and Techno decided to test the Revival Book on a living person. Techno thought that perhaps they could get an army of Technoblades to fight against Sam and Quackity. Dream used the book on Techno, but this summoned DreamXD to the cell. DreamXD gave them one wish, which Techno used to get a bell. Dream was initially angry at Techno for wasting their wish, but accepted that there was nothing they could do after it became clear that DreamXD would not return. Dream and Techno eventually came up with a plan to try to escape the prison by slowly breaking the obsidian blocks below the toilet.[165]\n\nAfter three months in prison, Dream and Technoblade had become closer and got along well. They did not make much progress on punching the obsidian as somebody would enter the cell every few hours. On September 14th, 2021, Quackity visited them. Quackity demanded that Dream hand over the Revival Book, or else he would kill Techno. When Dream did not agree, Quackity tried to kill Techno with a pickaxe. Before he could do so, Techno disappeared.[166] Quackity left the cell in an attempt to search for Techno with Sam. During this time, Dream hid in the tunnel that he dug under the toilet of the cell, tricking Quackity into believing he too had escaped the prison.[167]\n\nWhen Quackity had left the prison, Sam went back to the cell to investigate. He found Dream hiding in the tunnel below the water. Dream begged Sam not to tell Quackity that he was still in the prison, as he was scared that Quackity would kill him. Dream pointed out that Sam's job was to keep him alive in the prison. After Dream kept pleading with him, Sam eventually agreed not to tell Quackity that Dream did not escape. When Dream asked Sam if he could go to the courtyard and get better food, Sam refused and blamed Dream for all of the prison's bad conditions. Sam said that Dream deserved everything and should be thankful. He threatened that next time, it might be him who would torture Dream instead of Quackity doing it.[168]\n\nLegacy Arc\n\nFreedom\n\nMain article: Pandora's Vault jailbreak\n\nAt some point, Awesamdude put in a new alarm system outside Dream's cell, so that if only a block was broken, the alarm would instantly go off and the guards would be summoned immediately. This was to prevent any escape attempts. On November 28, 2021, Technoblade decided to free Ranboo and Dream from prison. He swam through the lava pool with fire resistance, reaching Dream's cell. Dream was surprised, and told Technoblade about the new alarm system. Techno then put down a piece of TNT, and ignited it. This blew up some of the redstone, but set off the alarm anyways. Techno put down an ender chest and gave weapons and armor to Dream, along with some ender pearls and golden apples. They then both swam through the lava pool with fire resistance, trying to find Ranboo.[169]\n\nSoon after, they ran into Sam and BadBoyHalo, who were running towards the cell to see what happened. They ender pearled through the lava tunnel, and put up a short fight that ended with BadBoyHalo being killed several times. Sam then ran back to the guard's prison room to plan out their next move. Meanwhile, Techno used milk and TNT to break in one of the cells, which surprisingly contained Connor. Techno decided to bring Connor with them and also broke Ranboo out. However, Dream did not care about Ranboo, and suggested several times to Techno to just get out of here before any more guards reached them. The group eventually escaped the prison using the tunnel that Techno dug earlier on.[170]\n\nAfter they got out, however, they were instantly attacked by most of the SMP's members. They had heard the alarm sound and Sam had warned them that Dream had escaped, so they had come near the prison to investigate. While Dream was fighting most of the SMP's members, Sam threatened Techno. He told him that if Dream did not return to the prison, he would take Ranboo's last canon life. Techno did not know what to do, and Ranboo ended up being killed by Sam. Meanwhile, Niki spawned some withers in to distract everyone. While fighting Sam, Techno decided to make a run for it with Niki, Philza, Connor, and Dream.[171]\n\nThe group was able to outrun their pursuers and escaped through the Nether. When they arrived at Technoblade's cabin, Dream asked Techno what the hiding plan was. Techno replied that he was not hiding and that he was going after Sam. He demanded that Dream gave him his armor back, pointing out that the favor was to break Dream out, not to give him a full set of armor. Dream was shocked but gave all of his armor back to Techno. Techno did allow him to keep his sword and shield, but Dream would owe him a favor in return. Dream left because he was afraid that without his armor, others would kill him.[172]\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter leaving Technoblade's cabin, Dream ran to the shore to meet up with Punz. It was revealed that Dream had meant to end up in prison and that the Disc Confrontation was staged. Punz had never truly betrayed him, and the two had planned for Dream to get out of prison way earlier. Dream was relieved to see Punz and explained to him that the plan had gone south. Punz apologized for the way things went and asked Dream if he was doing alright. He gave Dream armor and equipment. They parted ways again after agreeing to meet up soon at Punz's tower.[14]\n\nNow with full gear, Dream went to Logstedshire to get the Axe of Peace which was buried below the cross next to Tnret. Tommy also arrived at Logstedshire to prevent Dream from retrieving the Axe of Peace. However, Dream had already taken it from the chest. Dream taunted Tommy, welcoming him back to exile. He claimed that he would kill Tommy again and then revive him and kill him in an endless cycle. Dream said that Tommy had messed him up, making him get tortured in prison by Quackity. He accused Tommy of knowing about this and wanting it to happen. Dream told him he would make every day a living hell for him and started chasing Tommy. Tommy tried to run away from him and said that people would know what Dream had done. As Dream was chasing Tommy, he boasted that he could have easily killed Tommy already and that he was just toying with him now. Tommy ended up taking refuge at Phil's house, after which Dream left for Snowchester.[62]\n\nDream went to Snowchester where Tubbo had kept his armor, Nightmare. Sapnap was waiting for him there and had taken the armor. Dream wanted him to give it back, but Sapnap refused. When Sapnap asked him why he got out of prison, Dream told him that Quackity was torturing him to get the Revival Book. As they were arguing, Technoblade and Tubbo were in the hallway leading to the room. To repay the favor that he owed Techno, Dream returned the Axe of Peace to him.[173]\n\nDream then blocked the entrance so he could talk to Sapnap. He said that if Sapnap gave him his armor and weapons back, his plan was to leave and get away from everyone. However, Sapnap was suspicious that he would actually do that, to which Dream conceded that he would still live in the SMP but that he would be peaceful. Sapnap did not believe that, and still refused to give the armor after Dream said he did not want to fight Sapnap.[174]\n\nAs Dream wondered what Sapnap had been up to for the past year, Sapnap explained that he was working on Kinoko Kingdom with Karl and George. Dream used an enderpearl to get out of the room, telling Sapnap he would figure out Kinoko’s location for himself. As he was running and Sapnap chased him, Dream threatened Sapnap, saying he would get his reserves of TNT. After a short chase, Dream disappeared and Sapnap lost track of him.[175]\n\nObtaining prison control\n\nFollowing his escape, Dream took refuge in the Pandora's Vault, since it was fortified but abandoned. On January 30th, 2022, Dream found Sam in his old cell. Sam had been locked up there by Techno, Eret, and Tubbo as punishment for killing Ranboo. Dream exclaimed that this was the best day of his life, that Sam was an idiot and that it was karma that he ended up in the prison. Dream said that Sam was evil for letting Dream get tortured and that he might as well have held the knife himself. Sam eventually ended up admitting that he looked forward to Quackity coming in every day to torture Dream, because then they would finally get the Revival Book and could kill Dream.[176]\n\nDream asked Sam if he had heard the story of Pandora's box. Sam explained that the box was opened up and then evil was released into the world. Dream replied that Sam locked him up and made him very angry. He was tortured, betrayed, and lied to. Every person that did those things to him was now going to face his wrath. Dream told Sam that he would figure out how the prison worked and how to get into every guard area. He planned to keep Sam in the prison for a year and then kill him. Dream promised Sam that he would come in every day to give him food and ask questions.[177]\n\nThe next day, Dream came to visit Sam. Dream asked Sam if he was a good person. Sam said that he knew he was a good person, and that he did things for the greater good and that made them not bad. Dream requested that Sam list all the bad things that he did, which Sam proceeded to do. However, Sam did not list the fact that he had locked up Dream and had let Quackity torture him, which made Dream angry. Dream said that even he had not done all the bad things that Sam had done. He thought that Sam was similar to him, except Dream was able to admit that he was a bad person, while Sam lacked self-reflection.[178]\n\nChanging his mind from the previous day, Dream told Sam that he might not kill him after a year if he was able to realize his wrongs and rights. Sam then went on to say that the torture was just a means to an end, and that he would have let Dream go if he had just given them the Revival Book. This made Dream very mad because Sam was lying to him. Dream pointed out that Sam had admitted the previous day that he would have Quackity kill Dream once they got the book. Dream gave Sam steak and proceeded to leave the cell.[179]\n\nA few days later, Dream visited Sam once again. Sam immediately begged Dream for food, upon which Dream gave him steak and a cake that he had made himself. Dream asked Sam if he had time to think about himself and his past. Sam said that he had and that Dream was right about some things. Dream then asked what made Sam a good person and himself a bad person. Sam proceeded to list everything Dream had done, but Dream kept explaining that he had good reasons for doing those things. He admitted that the attachments that he had shown to Tommy during the Disc Confrontation were just theater and for show. He also said that he had never planned on actually killing Tubbo.[180]\n\nAfter considering this, Sam said that maybe what Dream had done was not all that bad. Dream explained that he viewed everything as a matter of perspective. Everyone was a good person in some people's stories and a bad person in other people’s stories. Dream said he was not evil but that he believed he was a bad guy, as you had to be one to stay alive. Sam tentatively agreed with this point of view. Dream told Sam that as long as Sam admitted that he was a bad guy and gave Dream the keys to the prison, that he would let him out. Dream just wanted to live in the prison and only keep an actually evil person locked up there. He believed an evil person to be somebody who does bad things without reason. Dream let Sam think about this proposal until the next day.[181]\n\nThe following day, Dream went over to Sam and asked if he thought about the proposal. Sam wondered if Dream would lock anyone else up in the prison. Dream replied that he would only lock a truly evil person in prison, but that he had nobody in mind right now. Dream just wanted a safe place to keep his things so they would not get stolen. The prison would be his base and he did not want Sam to have access to it. Sam said he just wanted to get out of prison and that he accepted Dream's proposal. Sam proceeded to follow Dream out of the cell and showed him how the prison worked.[182]\n\nWhen they were at the entrance room, Sam asked if he could go now. Dream replied that Sam had kept him locked up in prison forever, had fed him potatoes and had him tortured. Dream said he would have mercy on Sam and let him walk out, but only after Dream had killed him. However, Sam threatened to tell people what had happened if he died. Dream laughed and said that he would know that Sam told them and that he would hunt Sam down and take every single one of his lives. Dream decided to kill Sam with a pickaxe to give him a matching scar with Quackity. Sam begged Dream to let him go. Dream said he would let Sam go, but only after he died. He then proceeded to take Sam's first canon life.[183]\n\nConfrontation with Wilbur and Tommy\n\nOn June 6, 2022, Wilbur and Tommy arrived at Pandora's Vault. Wilbur wanted Tommy to start the alarm to lure Dream out to confront him. Tommy started the alarm and both were suprised to see that Dream appeared almost immediately. Dream disabled the exit portal, trapping Wilbur and Tommy inside. Wilbur thanked Dream for reviving him but said that he would no longer be in Dream's debt. He called himself Dream's \"project\", telling Dream that he was going to kill himself with a lava bucket if Dream did not do what he said.[184]\n\nWilbur threw a book at Dream and ordered him to write that L'Manberg was always a sovereign nation. Additionally, he had to write that Wilbur was a legitimate leader and that Dream was and always would be a terrorist to L'Manberg. Dream complied and gave Tommy the signed book. Wilbur then gave Tommy’s discs to Dream and told him to burn them within 20 seconds or he would kill himself. At the last second, Dream burned the discs in lava. Wilbur said that Dream no longer had power over him or Tommy. Following this, Tommy and Wilbur both went through the nether portal and left the prison.[185]\n\nVisiting Foolish\n\nLater on June 6, 2022, Dream visited Foolish's summer house after noticing the upgraded portal in the nether. Dream encountered Foolish there and assured him that he was just a simple tourist looking around. Foolish asked Dream about the Revival Book, wondering what would happen to it if Dream died. Dream said he had some assurances in place if that happened. While Foolish told Dream that he thought Dream was meant to be his enemy, he gave Dream a golden carrot as a token of peace.[186]\n\nSam showed up suddenly while the two were talking. Foolish felt that there was tension between Dream and Sam and kept asking if they were enemies. Dream said they were old friends and that they had resolved their differences. Dream explained that Sam had recently done some home improvements for him. Sam appeared nervous and constantly agreed with whatever Dream said.[187]\n\nDream kept telling Foolish that everyone on the server had done bad things and that Foolish should not simply assume and believe everything he heard. Dream asked Foolish where Quackity was. Foolish and Sam answered they had not seen him and did not know where he was. When Dream inquired about the nature of Foolish's relationship with Quackity, Foolish said that he was just doing some jobs for Quackity. Dream explained to Foolish that he did not understand how somebody as rich and powerful as Foolish would just be working for somebody like Quackity. Dream revealed to Foolish that Quackity had been torturing him every day in prison to get the Revival Book out of him. Foolish was surprised by this, but Sam reluctantly confirmed it was true.[188]\n\nDream told Foolish he would double whatever Quackity paid him for a five-minute warning if Quackity decided to go to Foolish's summer home. Foolish was hesitant and Dream gave him the golden carrot back, calling it the carrot of trust. Dream sent Sam away to get wheat for him so he and Foolish could talk in private.[189]\n\nFoolish said that if he agreed to give Dream a heads-up on Quackity, that he wanted Dream to kill people for him. Dream could choose who to kill and it might even be fine if Dream revived them afterwards. Dream said that all he knew was that he wanted Quackity dead. The second person who he would kill would be Sapnap, since he was hunting Dream and had taken his armor. Foolish said he preferred Sapnap alive since he still had plans with him. Dream assured Foolish that if he told Dream about Quackity, that Dream would give Foolish as much death as he wanted.[190]\n\nAfter Sam came back, Dream told Foolish it was nice to formally meet him. He also asked how close Sam's island was and said he might drop by one day and say hello. Dream then left after complimenting Foolish on his summer house again.[191]\n\nRevenge on Quackity\n\nAt some point, Dream asked Punz to relay a message to Purpled, asking for his assistance to take revenge on Quackity. Purpled had captured Slimecicle, Quackity's best friend, and Dream wanted to have Slimecicle kill Quackity. Purpled agreed to the plan, turning Slimecicle into his project and making him hate Quackity.[57] Following this, Dream, Purpled, and Slimecicle went over to Las Nevadas to confront Quackity. Quackity panicked and ran into a building, upon which Dream explained that they were there to make Quackity pay for everything he had done to Dream and everyone else. Dream showed him the keycard of the prison and claimed that he wanted to torture Quackity in the prison, with Purpled being in charge of Las Nevadas.[192]\n\nQuackity flipped a lever which set off fireworks above Las Nevadas, but Purpled and Dream laughed about this. Quackity said that all his actions had valid reasons which Dream understood, and that Dream was not a good person. Dream told Quackity that he wanted him to die abandoned by everything and everyone that he loved, with his city in ruins and ran by the person who betrayed him. Slimecicle then threatened to kill Quackity for what he did to him. However, Quackity denied that he had done anything to him and pointed out that Purpled had killed Slime.[193]\n\nIn the meantime, Foolish had seen the fireworks and released an army of slimes. The slimes broke into the building they were all in and started to attack Dream and Purpled. Dream drew all the slimes away from Purpled and blew them up with TNT. He blew up parts of Las Nevadas as he let Purpled follow Slime and Quackity. The encounter ended with both Purpled and Quackity losing a canon life.[194]\n\nDeath and Revival\n\nOn November 10th, 2022, Tommy decided that he had to kill Dream because he felt that Dream had taken everything from him. He had seen Dream leave Las Nevadas after Dream confronted Quackity there, and had followed him to Pandora’s Vault. After camping out there for several days, Tommy had concluded that the prison must be Dream's base. Tommy asked Tubbo to help him kill Dream in the prison, and the two geared up to fight Dream the next day.[195]\n\nThe following day, Tommy and Tubbo went over to the prison. They entered through a hole in the floor and noticed that the entire prison was overgrown with vines and moss. They did not understand how anyone could live in a place like that. After making their way through the exposed guard tunnels, they saw Dream in one of the low security cells. Dream had made his base in there and had written down his plans on the wall.[196]\n\nTommy and Tubbo ambushed Dream in the cell and tried to kill him. Dream attempted to run away, but Tommy and Tubbo kept chasing him. They eventually ended up near Dream's old cell, where Dream conceded that Tubbo and Tommy were a lot better prepared this time. However, Tubbo and Tommy got low on health and blocked themselves in the maximum-security cell. Tubbo discovered the harming potions used to let visitors out of the cell, and the two gathered as much as they could. As Dream broke into the cell, Tommy and Tubbo threw their potions, eventually killing Dream and taking his final canon life.[197]\n\nDream did not remain dead for long, as he had entrusted Punz in the past with the Revival Book, so that they could revive each other if one of them ever died.[198][199] After leaving the prison, Tommy and Tubbo went to tell Punz that they had killed Dream. In response, Punz led them down a secret staircase and revealed that he had the Revival Book. Stating that not everything was about money for him, Punz revived Dream and the two chased Tommy and Tubbo up the Power Tower.[200] Dream and Punz got Tubbo and Tommy to half a heart, after which Tubbo and Tommy begged for their lives. They were allowed to live under the condition that they had to follow Dream and Punz to Pandora's Vault.[201]\n\nTrue motives\n\nAfter arriving in Pandora's Vault, Dream and Punz made Tommy and Tubbo drop all their items, including the items from their ender chests. Dream and Punz took them to a secret area of the prison and forced them to drop down on an obsidian platform above lava. Dream told them that it was time for questions and a monologue. He said that he did not understand why Tommy came after him when Dream had not bothered him for months. Dream also questioned why they would so easily kill him, knowing that this meant that death was permanent. Tommy replied that Dream had ruined his life and that the one time they had won against Dream, Punz had interfered.[202]\n\nPunz said that Tommy did not see the bigger picture. Dream agreed and explained that his goal was to understand and know everything. Dream and Punz had been testing the Revival Book and wanted to understand what life was. They wanted to know everything, and therefore had figured out that they needed to be alive forever to have enough time do so. To accomplish this, they needed each other alive. When the server had started to turn against Dream, Dream had been afraid that if he and Punz fought them, they would both die. But if everyone thought that Punz was responsible for locking Dream in prison, then nobody would ever think to kill both Punz and Dream. That was the only way they could live forever.[203]\n\nDream pointed out that Punz and he knew so much more than Tubbo and Tommy. The separation between them might as well mean that he and Punz were gods. Dream said that Tommy and Tubbo went to their base and farmed potatoes, while Punz and Dream were dealing with god, revival, life, and death. Nonetheless, Dream told them that they had made some mistakes. They had locked up Vikkstar and LazarBeam, killing them in every way they could think of to figure out the exact workings of the Revival Book. Dream and Punz had also killed themselves to learn more about limbo.[204]\n\nBy reviving dead people, they had created an imbalance in the world. Dream and Punz had found out that there was another dimension, and they had seen the problems of the imbalance there and the corruption it caused in their own world. If people did not die to restore balance, the world could just end. The problem with killing people was that everyone would then go against Dream and Punz and try to kill them. Because of this, they had decided they had to kill everyone. The world was too messed up now and they had to restart. Everyone that would not join Dream and Punz would die.[205]\n\nThe reason that Dream and Punz had brought Tommy and Tubbo to the prison was because they had found out that everyone's limbo was different, depending on how a person died. But they had not tested yet what would happen if somebody died in a selfless way. Dream told Tubbo and Tommy about a pressure plate in the lava, which would open a way for one of them to escape. Only one person could escape and the other would die. Dream and Punz left to have lunch together, leaving Tubbo and Tommy to decide who was going to die. However, Tommy had secretly kept his two discs in his inventory. He used these to activate the pressure plate so that both he and Tubbo could leave.[206]\n\nFinal confrontation with Tommy\n\nThe next day, Tommy arrived at Pandora's Vault in an attempt to keep Dream and Punz there together so that a nuke could kill them. He went over to the maximum-security cell, where he found Dream and Punz. They were confused why Tommy was there, and Tommy claimed he wanted to kill them both. Dream did not understand why Tommy kept coming back to try and kill him after Tommy got away from him. No matter what, he would always be unsuccessful.[207]\n\nTommy asked if Dream could explain his point of view, because Tommy had never actually listened to Dream before. Dream said that he was fine with sacrificing himself and everything he knew and loved, just so they could have more knowledge. He wanted to know what everything was and he wanted to do that forever. Tommy said that instead of doing that, Dream could have been friends with him. Dream replied that Tommy had ruined that chance long ago. Tommy had broken all the rules of the server and annoyed everyone, and then got mad when people started retaliating. Dream said that he and Punz had done many evil things, but none of that mattered in the grand scheme of things. He did not want life to be temporary.[208]\n\nTommy apologized and said that perhaps Dream was happier before Tommy joined the server. However, he believed that Dream had always craved power and had always been the same. Tommy asked how Dream thought that death was nothing. Dream responded that it was nothing, because one moment Tommy was alive, and one moment he was dead. He then killed Tommy. A few minutes later, Dream revived Tommy again. Dream pointed out that death meant nothing when they had the Revival Book. He explained that things might hurt now, but once they knew everything then everyone could be invincible and live together in harmony. The ends justified the means.[209]\n\nTommy told Dream that while he was in limbo, he had seen a vision of Dream from the first day of the server. He said that Dream had not been evil when it had been just him and his friends. Tommy thought that Dream was still the same in his heart. Dream agreed and said they could go back to that time once they understood how life worked. Tommy realized that Dream was not the villain and just wanted things to be simple again and be back with his friends, which made sense to Tommy.[210]\n\nDream asked if Tommy was on his side. Tommy replied that he understood Dream but did not agree with his methods. Nonetheless, Tommy thought that Dream just wanted friends, which Tommy wanted as well. Dream asked why Tommy was trying to ruin everything all the time, but Tommy said he had no idea how much that had hurt Dream. Tommy told Dream that it was not too late to call off the plan and that they could all grow old together, which was enough. Dream was hesitant and did not know if that was enough, since he did not ever want to be alone.[211]\n\nWhen Tommy asked him to take off his helmet, Dream complied and also gave back Tommy's picture depicting his friends in L'Manberg. Dream asked why it could not be simple again, with everyone living forever and being friends. Tommy told Dream that he was with him. Dream wondered if it was not too late and that they could work together and figure things out. At that moment, the sirens from Tubbo's nuke sounded. Dream panicked and asked Tommy what he had done. He and Punz tried to exit the room, but Tommy said he was sorry and that it was too late. The nuke exploded and everyone in the prison died.[212]\n\nItems\n\nPets\n\nPets Name Status Residence Notes Spirit Deceased Alyssa's house Spirit was Dream's horse. When asked about Spirit's gender, Dream said that Spirit was non-binary.[255]\n\nSpirit was killed by mobs on a journey while Sapnap was riding them during the Storytime Stream, and they dropped a piece of leather.[83] Sapnap went to make a shrine for them, but when making the item frame to put the leather in, he accidentally used the leather from Spirit to make it.[256] Months later, Tommy obtained Spirit's leather and tried to use it as leverage against Dream. However, Dream claimed he no longer cared about Spirit since they had died ages ago and Dream now only cared about Tommy's discs.[257] Spirit's leather remained in Tommy's ender chest until Dream made him give up all the items in his ender chest, returning the leather to Dream.[258] Unnamed parrot Deceased On May 5, 2020, while exploring on Spirit, Dream found a gray parrot in a jungle and tamed it. He tried to take it back home, but the parrot suffocated in an ice spike while on Dream's shoulder. Dream made a grave for the parrot near the site where it had died.[259] Beckerson Alive Sapnap's ender chest Beckerson is the first-named fish in the Dream SMP, named after a donator and shared by the Dream Team.[260] Tommy took Beckerson and Mars from the Community House during the start of the Pet War. Dream got both the fish back in the end and put them in his ender chest.[261] During the Disc Confrontation, Beckerson was among the \"attachments\" that Dream had collected.[262] Beckerson was retrieved by Sapnap and is now kept in his ender chest.[263] J DAWG Alive A fish received as a gift from Seapeekay. Dream said that he liked pets and would add J DAWG to his pet collection.[264] Unnamed dog Deceased Community pet house This unnamed dog was tamed by Dream in the early days of the SMP, along with one other dog. They were both kept in the Community House until the community pet house was built nearby.[265] Dream kept the dogs there for a while, but made them follow him when Skeppy joined the server on August 8, 2020. Dream took the two dogs to Purpled's U.F.O., where Skeppy killed one of them.[266] Dream later said he did not care about the dogs because they did not do anything for him except something negative.[267] Charles Deceased Purpled's U.F.O. Charles was obtained by Dream in the beginning of the server, along with one other dog. They were both kept in the Community House until the community pet house was built nearby.[265] Dream kept the dogs there for a while, leaving them both unnamed. On August 8, 2020, he took them out when he was showing Skeppy around the server. While in Purpled's U.F.O., Skeppy threatened to kill the dogs if Dream did not name them. After Skeppy had already killed one dog, Dream named the remaining dog \"Charles\". He said he would temporarily keep the dog in Purpled's U.F.O. and would give it a nametag soon.[268] Dream killed Charles on August 11, 2020 in front of Fundy and Tubbo.[269] He said he had killed Charles because the dogs did not do anything for him except something negative.[267] Rat Deceased Pandora's Vault A tamed wolf that appeared in the maximum security cell of Pandora's Vault. The owner is unknown.\n\nPrior to Quackity entering the vault, Sam asked for Quackity to kill the dog, and Techno asked Dream to name the dog. However, Quackity refused to kill the dog, and Dream did not provide a name for the dog. Upon arriving in the cell, Quackity was asked to name the dog, and Quackity named it Rat.[270][271]\n\nAfter Techno escaped Pandora's Vault and Quackity left, Sam searched for Dream in the prison and killed Rat shortly after entering the maximum security cell.[272]\n\nRelationships\n\nRelationships with members Name Notes\n\nPositive\n\nAlyssa was Dream's close friend. Dream often helped Alyssa whenever she was online, notably fighting alongside her in The Disc War.[273]\n\nSworn enemy\n\nAwesamdude used to have a positive relationship with Dream, as Sam and Dream's factions were allies and Sam constructed the prison Pandora's Vault after being recruited by Dream.[274][275][276] During the Disc Confrontation, Sam and the others went to fight Dream in his vault, and Sam was the one that escorted Dream to prison.[277]\n\nFollowing Dream's imprisonment, their relationship grew negative. Dream, being lonely in the prison, constantly acted out to get Sam's attention. In contrast, Sam expressed annoyance at Dream's actions, calling him harming himself in the lava as him \"wanting attention\" and giving him less food when Dream burned his clock to get Sam to visit him. He even nearly stopped giving Dream replacement clocks, but was convinced to give him more clocks by BadBoyHalo.[278] At some point, Dream told Sam what he had done to Tommy during exile, which Sam thought was awful.[279]\n\nSam was shocked and in disbelief by Dream's killing of Tommy and did not give him food for several days because of it.[159][280] Sam and Quackity initially planned on killing Dream together, but Sam changed his mind when he realized that Dream still had the Revival Book.[281] Subsequently, Sam was willing to let Quackity go into the prison with weapons to torture Dream for information on the Revival Book, and did not listen when Dream called out for Sam to stop Quackity.[282] After Technoblade's escape, Dream begged Sam to not tell Quackity he was still in the prison, because Quackity would kill him otherwise. Sam eventually agreed not to tell Quackity, but was suspicious that Dream asked for better food and asked to go into the courtyard. He told Dream that next time, it might not be Quackity that goes to torture him but Sam instead.[168]\n\nA while after Dream's escape from prison, Dream found Sam imprisoned in Pandora's Vault. Dream attempted to make Sam understand that he had done many bad things and that Sam should own up to what he had done. Dream promised to let Sam out of the prison if he showed him how the prison worked. Sam agreed and led Dream through the whole prison. When they were at the entrance, Dream said that he would let Sam go, but that he would first have to kill him as revenge for letting Dream get tortured. Dream then killed Sam with a pickaxe.[283] After his death, Sam was released from the prison by Dream.[284]\n\nThe two later encountered each other at Foolish's summer house, where Foolish noticed tension between them. Dream kept saying they were not enemies and that they had resolved their problems. He did not tell Foolish that he had killed Sam or what had happened in the prison between them. Sam seemed scared during their talk and agreed with nearly anything that Dream said. Nevertheless, when Dream told Foolish that Sam had let Dream get tortured, Sam tried to deny this at first. He only admitted that it was true when Dream briefly switched to holding his axe.[285]\n\nSam was relieved when he learned that Tubbo and Tommy had taken Dream's final life. He said he no longer had to live in fear of Dream killing him and could now return to Pandora's Vault.[286]\n\nNeutral\n\nIn the past, BadBoyHalo had a positive relationship with Dream since the Badlands and Dream SMP had teamed up a lot previously, and Bad even helped Dream build Pandora's Vault.[274][124] During the Disc Confrontation, BadBoyHalo and several others went against Dream to rescue Tommy and Tubbo.[287] However, after visiting Dream in prison, Bad could not help but take pity on him and noticed the awful conditions that he was living in. He told Dream that he would try to improve the conditions for him once he officially became a prison guard, though he still adamantly believed that Dream deserved to remain in Pandora's Vault.[288]\n\nWhile he was a prison guard, BadBoyHalo always felt a little bad that Dream was in prison. Bad occasionally brought him sandwiches and a snack or two. At some point, Bad started regularly hearing screams coming from Dream's cell, with Dream looking worse and worse over time. As Bad suspected that Dream was being tortured, he gave the prison blueprints to Ranboo to help Dream escape. When Technoblade was helping Dream escape, Bad ignored Dream and only fought Techno. He did not want to attack Dream because he believed that Dream had gone through so much already. Despite that, Bad felt guilty that he had not done more to stop Dream from escaping.[289]\n\nA few months later, Bad and Skeppy encountered Dream at their destroyed house. Bad was terrified of Dream, fearing that Dream would retaliate for the part that Bad played in keeping Dream locked up. Dream blew up part of the remains of Bad and Skeppy's house, but he also gave Bad a block of netherite and Skeppy a totem of undying. Bad and Skeppy decided to leave the area, since Bad thought that perhaps Dream did not want them to be in their house, which is located close to Pandora's Vault.[290]\n\nA while afterwards, Bad learned that Tubbo and Tommy had taken Dream's final life. Bad was surprised by this development but seemed to be overal neutral about it.[291]\n\nNeutral/positive\n\nSince Dream was the very first human that DreamXD ever saw, DreamXD looks similar to Dream in appearance.[2] In one of George's dreams, DreamXD also claimed to be a part of Dream.[292]\n\nThe first on-screen interaction between Dream and DreamXD was when Dream used the Revival Book in Pandora's Vault on Technoblade while he was still alive. Consequently, DreamXD appeared and offered them a wish once Technoblade asked for one. Technoblade asked for a bell, which made Dream upset and disappointed that he did not wish for a way to get out of prison instead. DreamXD then disappeared and did not return.[293]\n\nLater on, DreamXD talked positively about Dream to Sapnap. He said that he would have preferred if Dream would have found the Book of Death instead of Sapnap. He thought that Dream would have been able to give him a lot of deaths with the powers of the Revival Book and the Book of Death combined. Regardless of that, DreamXD still made a deal with Sapnap where he gave him Dream's location.[294]\n\nWhen Foolish asked whether Dream knew about DreamXD, Dream denied knowing anything about him.[295] In a conversation with Tommy and Tubbo, Dream mentioned he and Punz had been researching and dealing with god, most likely alluding to DreamXD.[296]\n\nNegative\n\nDream does not have much of an opinion on Eret. He made them king of the Dream SMP on two separate occasions. Their relationship grew very tense after Eret supported Pogtopia instead of staying neutral like Dream wanted.[112] Nonetheless, they were on better terms after Eret was re-throned later. Dream seemed to respect Eret's neutrality and individuality to an extent, saying that he would have less power with Eret on the throne than with George. He also thought Eret made a good king for the Dream SMP.[120] In contrast, Eret felt a sense of freedom after Dream was imprisoned since Dream was the one who had given them the throne.[297] Eret considers Dream the villain of the entire server and has stated that he should not be trusted.[298]\n\nNeutral\n\nEryn and Dream only met for the first time after Dream's escape from Pandora's Vault. They had a positive interaction where Eryn traded harming arrows for a totem of undying. Eryn received the totem excitedly, and later commented that Dream seemed cool, and he could not see how anyone could not like Dream.[299] Eryn became more neutral towards Dream after Eret told him what Dream had done to Tommy in exile.[300]\n\nNeutral/negative\n\nDream and Foolish only interacted briefly when Foolish first joined the server, as Dream ended up in prison shortly afterwards.[301] Over a year later, Dream visited Foolish's summer house to ask him if he had any knowledge on Quackity's location. Foolish did not make any promises, but said that he might give Dream a headsup on Quackity if Dream was willing to give Foolish deaths. Dream agreed and promised to give Foolish as many deaths as he wanted, as long as Foolish would tell him about Quackity.[302]\n\nDream and Purpled later confronted Quackity in Las Nevadas, upon which Quackity fired fireworks which summoned Foolish to Las Nevadas. Foolish saw what was going on and decided to side with Quackity, unleashing the army of slimes that he and Quackity had created. The slime army attacked Purpled and Dream, and Foolish went on to help Quackity rebuild Las Nevadas after Dream blew up parts of it.[303]\n\nNegative\n\nDream has consistently been at odds with Fundy, with Fundy being one of the few people loyal to L'Manberg throughout nearly its whole history. They fought on opposite sides in the first war, as well as in the Manberg vs Pogtopia War.[304][305] Additionally, their relationship grew very tense during the Exile Conflict. Dream managed to convince Fundy and Tubbo that he supported L'Manberg after Tommy's exile, yet Dream secretly plotted to destroy it after getting Mellohi from Tubbo.[119]\n\nNeutral\n\nDream and George used to be best friends. They originally started the server together and stuck together for most of their adventures.[80] They fought and stood beside each other during the Early Dream SMP Arc and throughout the L'Manberg Independence War. During the Manberg vs Pogtopia War, Dream made George king of the Dream SMP, which made George very happy.[113] When Tommy burned George's house, Dream jumped to George's defense and made Tubbo exile Tommy as punishment.[306]\n\nShortly after, Dream told George to step down as king because George was no longer neutral and he kept getting attacked, which Dream wanted to stop from happening. This made George sad, as he felt like Dream hated him. George, along with Sapnap and Quackity, tried to regain kingship with a political protest against Dream's wishes.[307] Later, their conflict was resolved with Dream recognizing El Rapids as independent, with George remaining dethroned. This time, George and Dream left on seemingly neutral-negative terms.[308] Dream expressed to Sapnap and BadBoyHalo during their visits to Pandora's Vault that he would like George to come to visit him as well.[309][310]\n\nWhile Dream was in prison, George kept having dreams about him. In one of the dreams, George mistook DreamXD for Dream. He said he wanted things to go back to normal and to fix everything.[311] In another dream, he saw that Dream was out of prison and was very happy about it.[312] Quackity also spotted George outside the entrance to the prison, though George never ended up visiting.[313] After Dream escaped prison, George had another dream where Dream became angry at George for not visiting him in prison. In this dream, Dream asked George to help him destroy Kinoko Kingdom. When George refused, Dream killed him. George was very upset by that and destroyed the entire server in the dream in response.[314]\n\nSometime after Dream took Pandora's Vault as his base, he wrote George's name on a sign in his room in the prison. While he had also written down Sapnap's name below that, George's name was the only name that was fully legible.[315]\n\nNeutral\n\nDream and Ghostbur were supposedly on good terms, but this was mainly because Dream often took advantage of Ghostbur's trusting nature. While escorting Tommy to his exile location, Dream told Ghostbur that Tommy was just going on vacation. Ghostbur accepted this without a second thought.[316] Later on, Ghostbur was on his way to send out Tommy's beach party invites. Halfway through the invites, Dream took the invites from him with the promise that he would deliver them himself. Dream then told Ghostbur to take a walk in the snow, which resulted in Ghostbur getting lost. Ghostbur was not suspicious of this and continued to see Dream in a positive light.[317]\n\nWhen Tommy was planning to sneak into Pandora's Vault to kill Dream, Ghostbur was confused and said that he thought they liked Dream. Tommy assured him that they would take only take one of Dream's canon lives in order to send Dream a message that he should not be bad. Upon visiting Dream in the prison, Ghostbur was initially happy to see him, but became upset when Dream threatened to revive Wilbur. Dream ended up killing Ghostbur to revive Wilbur in the hope that Wilbur would help him escape.[318]\n\nIn the Afterlife, Ghostbur did not think about Dream specifically, only lamenting that he had messed up his task of helping to kill Dream.[319]\n\nNeutral\n\nDream and Schlatt had a business relationship, with both parties only working together for their own interest. When Schlatt announced his candidacy in the L'Manberg election, Dream lent Schlatt his crossbow, which Schlatt used to fire on the other election cadidates.[107] After Schlatt became president of Manberg, Dream supported Pogtopia because he did not like that Schlatt wanted to expand into Dream SMP lands.[108] Schlatt later gave Dream the Revival Book in return for Dream's allegiance.[111] Dream initially fought by his side, but abandoned him at the end of the Manberg vs Pogtopia War when Schlatt hid inside the Camarvan. Prior to Schlatt's death, Dream called him an idiot, and was apathetic to him dying.[320]\n\nVery negative\n\nDream seemed to get along well with Mexican Dream well during Lani's visit, with them teaming up together for a speedrun.[321] Mexican Dream later unsuccessfully tried to get Dream to join Mexican L'Manberg.[322] During Tommy's exile, Dream became more and more hostile towards Mexican Dream. Dream shot an arrow at the image of one of Mexican Dream's friends, but Mexican Dream jumped in front of the arrow, losing a canon life in the process. Shortly afterwards, Dream put up an image of the head of Mexican Dream's friend, causing Mexican Dream to attack him. Mexican Dream lost his final canon life to Dream in the duel that followed.[323]\n\nAs a ghost, Mexican Dream expressed his hatred for Dream to Sapnap and George, asking them for Dream's location. Once they arrived at Pandora's Vault, Mexican Dream became infuriated and started planning to break into the prison to kill Dream. He still wanted to kill Dream even after Sapnap told him it was impossible.[324]\n\nNeutral\n\nNiki never had many interactions with Dream. Niki joined L'Manberg upon joining the server, which was on relatively bad terms with Dream's faction.[325] She was part of Pogtopia during the Manberg vs Pogtopia War, putting her and Dream on opposing sides.[326] During the Doomsday War, Dream wanted Technoblade to burn the L'Mantree, but Techno did not know which tree that was. Niki eventually burned the tree, aligning herself against L'Manberg as well.[327]\n\nAt the end of the Disc Confrontation, Niki and many others protected Tommy and Tubbo from Dream and helped to imprison Dream.[287] However, Niki and Jack Manifold attempted to kill Tommy sometime after this. Niki briefly considered asking Dream for help with this, but dismissed the idea and stated that she did not like Dream.[328] Niki later participated in the Syndicate's effort to break Dream out of prison. She spawned withers to provide a distraction after the breakout.[329] Niki did not have any issues with this, telling Jack Manifold afterwards that she helped Techno because he was her friend. She also clarified that she had nothing to do with the favor between Techno and Dream.[330] Niki and Dream seem to be on neutral terms since then.\n\nNegative\n\nDream and Phil were generally distant, mainly interacting when they had mutual goals. Early on, Dream gave Phil a trident in return for an enchanted golden apple.[331] After Tommy's beach party, Phil found out that Dream had not delivered the invites to anyone, which Phil thought was messed up. However, Phil still worked together with Dream during the Doomsday War, helping Technoblade to blow up L'Manberg. Phil said that he only partnered with Dream because they had a common goal and that their partnership was just business.[332]\n\nLater on, Phil helped Techno break Dream out of Pandora's Vault. During the escape, Dream was surprised to see that Phil was helping him.[333] Phil said to Tommy afterwards that this was just business again, and that he was only helping Techno fulfill his favor. Phil was angry that the first thing that Dream did when he got out of prison was tormenting Tommy, and said that he would kill Dream if he saw him again.[334]\n\nA while after Dream's escape, Tommy saw a sign outside Phil's house. On this sign, Dream falsely claimed to have kidnapped Phil right after Tommy had gone to see him. However, Dream was not on the server during this time, so it is unclear how this sign appeared there.[335] Nonetheless, Phil remains on bad terms with Dream due to Dream's behavior towards Tommy.\n\nNegative\n\nPonk used to be very friendly with Dream, as Dream helped Ponk during the Disc Saga. Their relationship took a turn for the worse when Ponk assisted with the imprisonment of Dream during the Disc Confrontation.[287] Ponk stated he did not directly hate Dream because Dream never stole anything of his. However, he still hated Dream for what he did to others, but not to the extent of Tommy's hatred for Dream.[336] Ponk was angry at Sam when Dream escaped from prison, fearing that Dream would go on to do bad things now that he was out.[337]\n\nNegative\n\nDream seemed to take a liking to Puffy immediately, following her around for no apparent reason, even without armor. Due to this, Puffy called him her \"duckling\", and admitted he pulled on her heartstrings.[338] This made Puffy consider joining Dream's side.[339] After the Doomsday War, Puffy was upset that Dream had destroyed everyone's home in L'Manberg, stating that she could no longer support him.[340]\n\nPuffy was one of Dream's main apprehenders during the Disc Confrontation.[287] She was sad that they had to lock up Dream in Pandora's Vault, but felt it was a necessary sacrifice because she thought that Dream went too far in prioritizing Tommy's discs over people's happiness. She planned to visit Dream in prison and hoped that Dream would eventually understand the loneliness that he had put Tommy through in exile. Puffy also hoped that Dream would see that his actions had consequences.[341]\n\nAfter Tommy's revival, Puffy heard rumors that people were plotting to kill Dream. She did not like this, as she believed that two wrongs did not make a right. She also said that the reason she did not visit Dream in prison was because she did not think he deserved it at that point. Puffy thought that Dream needed to pay for what he did, but realized that being in prison was not enough to stop Dream from affecting people.[342]\n\nVery positive\n\nPunz is Dream's friend and close confidant, and one of his only allies. Dream has Punz's unquestioning and unwavering loyalty, with Punz being on Dream's side no matter what. At first, Punz only fought for Dream because of the payment that he received for his services as a mercenary. He was on Dream's side for many major conflicts, notably the Dream Team SMP vs. L'Manberg War, the Manberg vs Pogtopia War, and Technoblade's execution.[93][343][134]\n\nFollowing this last event, Punz and Dream admitted that their alliance had grown to a strong friendship. Dream noted that everyone was turning against him and that Punz being on his side would be dangerous for Punz. They agreed that Punz would pretend to be not on Dream’s side to prevent Punz from being targeted. Dream left Punz in charge of the Dream SMP, because Dream was going to do something that nobody would like him for and would have to leave soon afterwards.[3]\n\nAt some point, Dream trusted Punz with knowledge of the Revival Book. They came to have the same goal of wanting to understand everything about the world. They secretly tested the Revival Book on Vikkstar and LazarBeam for months.[17] Dream and Punz killed themselves and each other multiple times to understand what limbo was like.[37] They wanted to live forever in order to learn everything, realizing that both of them would need to be alive so that they could revive each other.[344]\n\nA while later, Dream and Punz planned to stage the Disc Confrontation. This would make it seem as if Punz had betrayed Dream by getting him imprisoned in Pandora's Vault, so that nobody would ever suspect they had to kill both Dream and Punz to permanently kill them.[345] The day before the Disc Confrontation, Tommy gave Punz many valuables to obtain his help against Dream.[346] Punz pretended to join Tommy's side and led many server members to Dream's location, eventually achieving the goal of getting Dream locked up.[39] In the time after that, Punz kept claiming to others that he had betrayed Dream because Dream had not paid him enough.[347]\n\nAfter Dream's escape from Pandora's Vault, Punz and Dream secretly met up at a pre-determined rendezvous point. They mentioned that the plan had gone south and that Dream had been in prison for longer than they had planned. Punz provided Dream with a new set of netherite armor and equipment, and the two agreed to meet again later in Punz's tower on Dream's signal.[14]\n\nDream later told Punz that he had been tortured by Quackity every day for six months. Punz was appalled by this and was sympathetic to Dream. Punz went to Purpled on behalf of Dream to get his help to take revenge on Quackity. However, Punz got very upset when Purpled at first did not believe that Quackity had tortured Dream. He told Purpled that Quackity had done unspeakable things to Dream that went beyond anyone's limit, which eventually made Purpled agree to help Dream. Punz did not reveal his alliance with Dream, telling Purpled that Dream had just paid him a lot to relay a message.[57]\n\nOn November 11th, 2022, Tubbo and Tommy took Dream's final life in Pandora's Vault. They went on to tell Punz about this, who was shocked that they had managed to kill Dream by themselves. They asked Punz to join their future nation, and Punz led them to a secret area that he said contained something they could use for their nation. While going down a staircase, Punz became more and more angry and revealed that he had a Revival Book. He said that not everything was about money, immediately adding that he wanted power. Punz went on to revive Dream, and the two chased Tommy and Tubbo up the Power Tower.[200]\n\nDream and Punz captured Tommy and Tubbo and brought them to Pandora's Vault, where they were put on an obsidian platform surrounded by lava. Dream and Punz explained what their motivations and plans were and that Tubbo and Tommy knew nothing compared to Dream and Punz. They said that they wanted to see what would happen if somebody died a hero, making Tubbo and Tommy choose who would die. Despite this, when Punz and Dream went out of the room, both Tubbo and Tommy managed to escape the prison.[348]\n\nThe next day, Tommy came back to the prison to keep Dream and Punz there together. This was so that Tubbo could fire a nuke on them. Punz supported Dream throughout the encounter with Tommy, and did not care when Tommy explained that Dream had almost driven him to kill himself. When Tommy said that Dream just wanted friends, Punz emphasized that he was Dream's friend. Punz was by Dream's side until the nuke ended up killing them all.[349]\n\nPositive\n\nPurpled was Dream's mutual friend, though they did not interact much in the beginning. Dream did fall victim to Purpled's pitfall trap after pushing Purpled into it as well.[88]\n\nA while after Dream escaped from Pandora's Vault, Punz told Purpled that Quackity had tortured Dream every day for months. In the end, this made Purpled agree to kill Quackity together with Dream, with Purpled intending to take control of Las Nevadas. Dream and Purpled confronted Quackity, but they were interrupted by Quackity's army of slimes which attacked them. Dream drew the slimes away from Purpled so that he could chase Quackity. While this led to Purpled losing a canon life, Dream and Purpled did achieve their objective when Quackity lost a canon life as well.[350]\n\nSworn enemy\n\nQuackity previously had a somewhat neutral relationship with Dream, although they were on different sides in the Manberg vs Pogtopia War.[343] Their relationship deteriorated greatly during and after the Exile Conflict, when Dream gave Tubbo an ultimatum to either exile Tommy or face the consequences. After Tubbo chose to exile Tommy, Quackity was very mad and wanted to kill Dream as soon as possible.[351]\n\nTheir relationship became even worse when George was dethroned by Dream in favor of replacing him with Eret. Quackity took George's side and tried to get Dream to reinstate George as king of the Dream SMP.[352] Quackity later destroyed parts of Eret's castle and their throne. This made Dream believe that Quackity's number-one goal was to cause problems on the server, and he declared Quackity to be \"the biggest enemy on the SMP\". However, after negotiations, Dream agreed to officially recognize Quackity's new country as an independent nation.[353]\n\nIn the aftermath of Technoblade's execution, Quackity realized that Dream had assisted Technoblade with his escape. Quackity became convinced that they needed to get rid of Dream since he always interfered with the affairs of L'Manberg. He and the rest of the L'Manberg cabinet planned a festival where they would try to kill Dream.[354] This proved to be unsuccessful and led to Dream destroying L'Manberg in the Doomsday War. During this conflict, Quackity fought on the side of L'Manberg because he said that he was sick of Dream having so much power.[355] A few weeks later, Quackity was among the members of the server who were part of the coalition that rose up against Dream during the Disc Confrontation.[287]\n\nAfter Tommy was killed by Dream in Pandora's Vault, Sam and Quackity decided to kill Dream as revenge. Sam ended up changing his mind because Dream still had the Revival Book. Quackity agreed with Sam, but told him that Dream needed to be punished at some point. If Sam would not do that, then Quackity said he would.[281] A while after this, Quackity convinced Sam to let him into the prison to torture Dream for the Revival Book's knowledge. Since Dream refused to give this to him, Quackity tortured him every day for months.[356] Quackity admitted to Dream that he liked torturing him and that he did it to remind Dream of every bad thing he had done.[357]\n\nQuackity eventually forced Dream to write a note to Technoblade in which Dream asked him to visit.[163] When Techno visited, Sam trapped him inside Dream's cell.[164] Three months later, Quackity visited them both with the goal to finally obtain the Revival Book from Dream. However, Techno disappeared from the cell while Quackity tried to kill him. Quackity left the cell to search for Techno, but said that he would return to kill Dream.[167] Dream hid underneath the toilet of the cell, where Sam found him. Dream begged Sam to not tell Quackity he was still in the prison. Sam relunctantly agreed, and Quackity was left thinking that Dream had escaped the prison.[168]\n\nFollowing his escape from Pandora's Vault, Dream encountered Sam locked up in the prison. Dream expressed his hatred for Quackity to Sam, calling Quackity a sociopath with no feelings. He said that he planned to find Quackity and kill him.[358] A while later, Dream also told Foolish that all he wanted was to kill Quackity.[359]\n\nAt some time, Punz asked Purpled to help Dream take revenge on Quackity. Purpled agreed and the two of them met Quackity in Las Nevadas. Dream sa"
