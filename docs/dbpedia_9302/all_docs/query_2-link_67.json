        "text": "There was no souring on his hometown event. Capan wanted to play it more than ever. His only worry was where else he could be that week. Currently in his first season on the Korn Ferry Tour, Capan has spent much of the last three months on the bubble. While PGA TOUR members are worried about cracking the top 70 for the Playoffs in two weeks, Capan is eyeing a top-30 finish on the Korn Ferry Tour Points List, which would earn the 23-year-old full status on the PGA TOUR for next season. He’s currently 34th and within 60 points of cracking the top 30. Since a T3 finish at the HomeTown Lenders Championship at the end of April rocketed him up to 33rd in the standings, Capan has been straddling the line of potential TOUR membership. A mixed bag of results (two missed cuts and two top-6 finishes) over the last seven weeks has led to Capan’s spot on the Korn Ferry Tour Points List fluctuating anywhere between 30th and 40th.\n\nMissing any week could mean the difference between another year on the KFT or a spot on TOUR. Capan’s well aware of that. But after seeking the advice of family and fellow KFT member Kevin Dougherty, Capan decided the chance to come back home and compete in his third career TOUR event was too enticing to pass up.\n\n“If I were to play the Korn Ferry event this week, I would probably end up playing seven weeks in a row, which can be a lot, a lot of travel, a lot of golf,” he said. “This week is nice because even though I'm playing, I'm also staying at home. Even though I'm putting all my energy into this tournament this week, at least I'm able to spend some time with my family and sleep in my own bed, which I haven't had the opportunity to do that in a while.\n\n“And also with the points I've accumulated throughout this year and with the way I feel like I've been playing, I'm confident that I'll be able to get the sufficient amount of points in the last seven events to close out the year,” he said.\n\nCapan’s confident about his chances at his hometown event, too. The Florida Gulf Coast alum can go low with the best of them. He ranks 12th on the Korn Ferry Tour in birdie average – and plenty will be needed at TPC Twin Cities, which has yielded an average winning score of 18-under in its four-year history. Just to gain his Korn Ferry Tour card, Capan successfully navigated three consecutive Q-School stages – pre-qualifying, First Stage and Second Stage – and was beaten by a total of two people. He finished eighth at Korn Ferry Q-School Finals to earn partial status this season.\n\n“Originally she was supposed to be just a fill-in caddie and the more success we had, the more we realized that she should just keep staying on the bag,” Capan said. “Obviously when we went through Q-School and only lost to nine people, it was pretty evident that she should stay on the bag for a little longer.”\n\nThe duo keeps it serious on the course. As Capan made his way around Wednesday’s pro-am, Charlynn discussed pin locations and potential clubs to take into certain greens. Capan handles most of his yardages during tournament play, but Charlynn is there for support every step of the way. The mom instincts kick in sometimes, too. Capan is “the most hydrated” golfer on the course and has his mom to thank for that.\n\nThey make sure to keep some boundaries, too. When the two leave the course, they stop talking about golf. And when they are on the road, Capan will normally stay with a friend on the Korn Ferry Tour while his mom and dad will stay elsewhere.\n\n“To win a PGA TOUR event in any state would be something special, but to do it here, it would be a little ridiculous,” Capan said. “I mean I'm sure we would be celebrating probably into Tuesday of next week.”"
