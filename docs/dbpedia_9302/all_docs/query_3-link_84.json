        "text": "Ski season is here, and the best ski resorts on the East Coast expect above-normal snowfall forecasts according to On the Snow. Look forward to blockbuster conditions on your favorite mountains, from Maine to Vermont to New York and beyond.\n\nAre you looking for inspiration for your next weekend on the slopes? Here is a sweeping roundup of the region’s best, biggest, and most beloved ski resorts, from exclusive resorts on the East Coast to small local hidden gems.\n\nWhether you’re a weekend warrior chasing fresh powder across New England’s biggest mountains or looking for a relaxing week-long family ski trip, let Volato help you get there without the anxiety of treacherous snowy roads or delays of inevitable Friday afternoon traffic jams heading out of the city. Plan to charter a private jet to save time and eliminate stress for all your ski trips this year.\n\nThe 14 best ski resorts on the east coast.\n\n1. Mont Tremblant\n\nLocation\n\nQuebec, Canada\n\nNearest airports\n\nMont-Tremblant International Airport, Montreal-Trudeau International Airport.\n\nMountain statistics\n\nMont Tremblant is Eastern Canada’s most prestigious ski resort, with terrain reaching up to 2,871 feet and a hill that spans 755 skiable acres, encompassing more than 100 trails across four separate slopes. Tremblant also has 14 lifts, including two gondolas and six high-speed four-passenger chairlifts.\n\nPlus, for those worried about planning around snowfall, the mountain boasts more than 1,200 snow guns and one of the most advanced snowmaking systems in North America.\n\nAccommodations\n\nAs one of Canada’s most renowned resorts, Mont Tremblant’s accommodation is as exquisite as what you’d expect in the Alps. Lodging areas are split between mountainside, village-side, and golf course-side, with plenty of premium options throughout.\n\nTop choices around the resort include the Fairmont Tremblant, Hôtel Quintessence, and the Bel Air Tremblant Resort Hotel. You can expect world-class service with Quebec-inspired ski-lodge design elements.\n\nDining\n\nAfter the slopes, explore French-Canadian-inspired cuisine at Mont Tremblant’s many fine-dining establishments. From lobster risotto at Restaurant La Quintessence to venison tartare at Restaurant La Maître, you’ll find something spectacular to energize your first run the next day.\n\nActivities\n\nImmerse yourself in a truly Canadian experience by snowshoeing, enjoying fondue evenings, heli sightseeing, dogsledding, and more. Of course, there are plenty of high-octane options as well, whether it’s snow-blanketed paintball, tubing, or ice-climbing.\n\nAprès ski\n\nVoted the best après-ski bar in North America for a decade straight, no Mont Tremblant visit is complete without one celebratory drink from P’Tit Caribou. Peel off your gear, grab a Caesar, and experience the real deal of après culture in Canada.\n\n2. Killington Resort\n\nLocation\n\nVermont, USA\n\nNearest airports\n\nRutland Regional Airport, Lebanon Municipal Airport.\n\nMountain statistics\n\nKillington Resort’s motto is “Big. Biggest. Beast,” inspired by its seven distinct peaks, with the highest summit (Killington Peak) reaching 4,241 feet. The resort has a combined skiable area between Pico Mountain and Killington of nearly 2,000 acres and 92 miles of trails. Most of these are black diamonds, so this is an excellent destination for those with more seasons on their skis.\n\nIn terms of snow, this Vermont resort regularly gets 250″ of all-natural powder, which is complemented by 600 acres of snowmaking pumping out 12 inches of snow every day.\n\nAccommodations\n\nIn and around Killington, the most impressive lodgings are via private vacation rentals, where the sky’s the limit in terms of in-house amenities, privacy, and bedrooms. For more authentic but no less comfortable accommodation for a quick ski weekend, try the Killington Mountain Lodge (Tapestry Collection by Hilton) or the Mountain Meadows Lodge.\n\nDining\n\nIt’s slopeside dining at its finest when you slide into the seasonally inspired menus at the Peak Lodge and one-of-a-kind dining experience at Ledgewood Yurt. Off the mountain, you can find casual fine dining at the Foundry at Summit Pond or sip on tasty local brews while you dine at the Long Trail Brewing Company.\n\nActivities\n\nIf you need to give your legs a break, hop on a snowmobile tour or relax at the Grand Spa. Killington Resort also hosts a neverending roster of music events all season long at the base lodge.\n\nAprès ski\n\nSlide into your après at one of two legendary après-ski establishments at Killington: The Wobbly Barn and Preston’s. The former transitions into a steakhouse and nightclub, while the latter caters to a more relaxed après atmosphere.\n\n3. Stowe Mountain Resort\n\nLocation\n\nVermont, USA\n\nNearby airports\n\nBurlington Airport, Plattsburgh Airport, Lebanon Airport.\n\nMountain statistics\n\nStowe Mountain Resort is part of the Vail family of mountains. If the legends are true, it is “the birthplace of alpine skiing in Vermont,” dating back to 1937. Stowe Mountain terrain is split between Mount Mansfield and Spruce Peak, covering 485 acres of skiable terrain. Twelve lifts service 116 different ski trails, most of which are blue runs, making this one of the best beginner ski resorts on the East Coast.\n\nStowe Mountain gets an average annual snowfall of more than 300″, meaning you’ll have a great chance of hitting more natural snow conditions and fresh tracks.\n\nAccommodations\n\nStowe Mountain is one of the top ski resorts on the East Coast, thanks in no small part to its premier accommodation options. Highlights include the Hyatt Lodge at Spruce Peak, the Mountain Top Resort, and Stowe Meadows.\n\nPlus, for anyone seeking more privacy or higher-end amenities, Quintessentially, Volato’s travel concierge partner, can easily accommodate any of Stowe’s private lodge rentals.\n\nDining\n\nTry the Butler’s Pantry or the Stowe Bee Bakery & Cafe for the best breakfasts near Stowe Mountain. Then, for an evening out, try the exceptional Italian menu at Trattoria La Festa and Michaels on the Hill for a seasonal Swiss-European-style plating.\n\nActivities\n\nWhether you book a private mountain guide to show you the powder pockets on Stowe Mountain or spend a romantic Sunday lounging around the slopeside Spa at Spruce Peak, there is a little something for everyone.\n\nAprès ski\n\nStowe Mountain boasts some of the best nightlife at any ski resort on the East Coast. A few standout locations for an après ski beverage (or two) include the Whistle Pig Pavilion, Cork, and The Matterhorn. Or, for something a bit different, try the Backyard, one of the most beloved local dive bars.\n\n4. Jay Peak Resort\n\nLocation\n\nVermont, USA\n\nNearest airports\n\nNortheast Kingdom International Airport, Burlington Airport.\n\nMountain statistics\n\nJay Peak may be one of Vermont’s smaller mountains, but it still claims close to 400 acres of terrain, a sky-high summit of 3,986 feet, and 50 miles of trails. It is loved for its “liberal in-bounds policy,” so you can enjoy the full mountain experience.\n\nAlso, let’s not forget that Jay Peak is undeniably the best ski resort on the East Coast in terms of snow. Every year, this resort gets 347″ of snow, plus an impressive 80 percent terrain coverage for snow production.\n\nAccommodations\n\nPart of the appeal of Jay Peak is that almost all of the resort accommodation is ski-in, ski-out (or at least easily walkable to the base of a lift). The Tram Haus Lodge stands out thanks to its locally-made furnishings, but so do the more private North Village Townhomes, with five bedrooms and plenty of space for your entire party to enjoy.\n\nDining\n\nTry Sessions @ the Box Food Truck, Miso Hungry, or the Aroma Coffee Shop for sneaking in snacks between runs. Then, at the end of the day, head over to the Foundry Pub & Grill or the Derby Line Village Inn once the ski boots are off.\n\nActivities\n\nOutside of downhill at Jay Peak, you can also find more horizontally inclined activities hosted at the Nordic Center. Take a turn around 12 miles of groomed trails by Nordic skiing or skate skiing. Or, explore the New England wilderness with a guided snowshoe tour.\n\nAprès ski\n\nThe Après ski scene at Jay Peak is small but mighty. A few more lively locations to unwind after your morning on the mountain include The Bullwheel Bar, Tower, Bar, The Drink, and The Belfry.\n\n5. Sugarbush Resort\n\nLocation\n\nVermont, USA\n\nNearest airports\n\nBurlington International Airport.\n\nMountain statistics\n\nSugarbush Resort spans two mountains, six peaks, and the 2,000-acre Slide Brook Basin. As one of New England’s largest ski resorts, it has an astounding array of services supporting a weekend on the hill: multiple base lodges, four terrain parks, 16 lifts, and all the retail, rentals, and restaurants you can dream of.\n\nThis Vermont resort is also known for its deep snowfall. According to On the Snow, Sugarbush regularly gets 204″ of snow a year, with 57 annual days of snowfall. If you are chasing powder, chances are you can find it here.\n\nAccommodations\n\nThe most extravagantly outfitted accommodations around Sugarbush are high-end private rentals. But if you’re looking for a more full-service lodging option, check out Stone Hill Inn, which sits just 10 minutes off the mountain. Guests love it for its tranquility and attention to detail.\n\nDining\n\nMost of the more refined dining options in this area of Vermont are located in nearby towns, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find tasty daytime options on the mountain. Sip on craft cocktails at the Black Sheep Bar located at the Lodge on Lincoln Peak, grab a perfectly brewed espresso at Nomad Coffee, or refuel between runs at Miso Toh Kome and The Lunch Box food stalls.\n\nActivities\n\nSugarbush Resort has a few on-mountain activities you won’t find elsewhere. Whether you want to book an exclusive private heated cabin at the base, hire a dog sled tour for you and the family, or reserve an epic Apres Groomer ride, there is enough entertainment to fill your ski boots.\n\nAprès ski\n\nFor an upscale, relaxed après-ski option focused on a more cozy atmosphere and hand-selected wine lists, head to Alpino Vino. But if you’re after a more vibrant and perhaps beer-infused afternoon, find a spot at Lawson’s Finest taproom.\n\n6. Sugarloaf\n\nLocation\n\nMaine, USA\n\nNearest airports\n\nSugarloaf Regional Airport, Boston Logan International Airport.\n\nMountain statistics\n\nIn terms of skiable terrain, Sugarloaf Resort is the second-largest ski resort east of the Mississippi. It encompasses more than 1,360 acres of skiable terrain, reaching a height of 4,237 feet at its peak and then plunging through 176 trails and glades for a 2,820-foot vertical drop. It’s ideal for intermediate and advanced skiers and snowboarders, thanks to nearly 50 percent of its terrain focused on black and double-black diamonds.\n\nWe can’t forget to highlight Sugarloaf’s 10-year average of 200″ of snow annually. Combined with over 1,500 snowmaking hydrant sets spanning 700 acres of coverage, there is no such thing as a poor snow season at Sugarloaf.\n\nAccommodations\n\nLodging options in and around Sugarloaf Resort are split between classic ski-hill hotels and apartments or full-lodge private rentals. If you’re looking to stay as close as possible to the lifts to catch early morning runs, Sugarloaf Mountain Hotel and Sugarloaf Inn are two options.\n\nBut for high-end accommodations or something more suitable for a larger party, check out Sugarloaf’s private family homes, featuring deluxe amenities and a more spacious environment.\n\nDining\n\nStreet food and snacks abound around Sugarloaf’s slopes, perfect for a quick midday refuel. From Eighty 8 Donuts to Alice & Lulu’s to the Shipyard Brewhouse, there are options for every palate. Expect meals infused with the comforts of home and Maine’s hospitality.\n\nActivities\n\nOff-piste Sugarloaf has a relaxed, casual atmosphere. It offers a full schedule of activities ready to keep your entire family active. Some highlights for kids include the snow castle zone, tubing, skating, and snow school.\n\nAprès ski\n\nAfter your last run, it’s time to unwind at one of this resort’s three après-ski destinations. Bullwinkle’s has an all-day breakfast, 45-North features relaxed comfort foods, and the Widowmaker is a destination for the high-energy, après atmosphere influenced by 20 Maine-brewed beers on tap. At Sugarloaf, you get to choose your own après adventure.\n\n7. Whiteface Mountain\n\nLocation\n\nNew York, USA\n\nNearest airports\n\nAdirondack Regional Airport.\n\nMountain statistics\n\nWhiteface Mountain has the highest skiable terrain on the entire East Coast. Its peak is 4,867 feet, and the skiable slopes reach 4,650 feet. The mountain hosts more than 90 trails for a total of 24 miles of nonstop riding.\n\nOn average, Whiteface gets 183″ of snow accumulation annually, supplemented with 99 percent snowgun coverage over its terrain. This means that no matter what the season’s snow looks like, your time on the mountain will not disappoint.\n\nAccommodations\n\nMuch of the accommodations around Whiteface live in the nearby town of Lake Placid. Here, you can find the exquisitely furnished Whiteface Lodge and Mirror Lake Inn. Both of these places promise cozy-mountain aesthetics, making every room unique.\n\nDining\n\nWhiteface and nearby Lake Placid have a surprising number of outstanding dining options. For example, there are the always-sensational meals at Kanu at The Whiteface Lodge, where the atmosphere is just as stunning as the plating, or make a reservation at New Vida Preserve for an entirely local, seasonal, and farm-to-table menu.\n\nActivities\n\nWhiteface Mountain is about traditional upstate activities: ice hockey and skating (rental always available). Plus, you can always hit their punishing Uphill program for those who want to work up a memorable, if challenging, early morning sweat.\n\nAprès ski\n\nWhen it’s time to kick off the ski boots, Cloudspin Lounge is one of the best Whiteface après experiences. This rustic local pub offers drinks, laughter, and friendly faces. When it comes time to head back to your hotel, there is an easy, regular shuttle service to Wilmington and Lake Placid.\n\n8. Bretton Woods\n\nLocation\n\nNew Hampshire, USA\n\nNearest airports\n\nManchester Boston Regional Airport, Portland International Jetport.\n\nMountain statistics\n\nBretton Woods is one of the biggest East Coast ski resorts and certainly the largest in New Hampshire. It’s consistently ranked as the best resort for groomed trails and snow, which is just one part of why New Hampshireites love it here. The resort spans 468 acres of terrain and has a network of over 90 trails and 35 different glades.\n\nAccommodations\n\nAround Bretton Woods, you’ll find plenty of options that perfectly capture New England’s charming character. Omni Mount Washington Resort and Omni Bretton Arms Inn at Mount Washington are just two of many. There are also a host of large, modern, private vacation rentals in the neighborhood for those looking for more private lodgings.\n\nDining\n\nOn the mountain, fuel your runs at the Slopeside Pub and the Switchback Grille. Off the mountain, you can’t miss an experience at one of Bretton Woods’ fine dining restaurants, especially the main dining room: 1902. From the menu to the interior design, this is a stunning modern take on historic New England.\n\nActivities\n\nYou’ll find all the family-friendly classics here: tubing, nordic skiing, snowshoeing, and sleigh rides. Then, for anyone seeking a high-flying, heart-racing activity, hit up the canopy tour to zipline through one of the longest canopy adventures in the US.\n\nAprès ski\n\nYou’ll notice the après scene at Bretton Woods focuses on the local craft brew scene. Every weekend, all season long, the mountain features the brews of a local brewery. From Tuckerman to Fiddlehead to Moat Mountain, they all pair well with the live music ramping up for every weekend après.\n\n9. Mad River Glen Cooperative\n\nLocation\n\nVermont, USA\n\nNearby airports\n\nBurlington International Airport.\n\nMountain statistics\n\nMad River Glen is a mountain for the people. It’s a small co-op mountain beloved among its shareholders because it focuses on intermediate and expert terrain (80 percent of its terrain in total). For this reason, it’s one of the state’s best-kept secrets.\n\nOriginally founded in 1948, this resort was historically restored in 2007, including the now famous Single Chair. Mad River Glen sees 228″ of snowfall annually.\n\nAccommodations\n\nWhile Mad River Glen may not stand out for its high-end mountain lodging options, sleeping is not why people mission here. Most lodging is cozy and warm but basic. If you want something more elevated than a small mountain chalet, check out options farther afield, like the Mad River Barn, a spectacularly decorated boutique lodging just off the mountain.\n\nDining\n\nIf you happen to be staying at the Mad River Barn, their on-site restaurant just happens to have a great lineup of upscale pub fare to keep well fed and more than happy during your stay.\n\nActivities\n\nMad River Glen’s mountain-sponsored activities are intensely planned around mountain skills. Whether that means telemarking clinics, alpine clinics, guided snowshoe tours, or epic local races, make time on your ski trip to check out the activities sponsored by this passionate local community.\n\nAprès ski\n\nAgain, this is a small but vibrant little ski resort. You can expect a genuinely local après experience here, all centered around Stark’s Pub. Think local craft beers on tap, live music on the weekends, and their iconic “Wall of Fame.”\n\n10. Loon Mountain\n\nLocation\n\nNew Hampshire, USA\n\nNearby airports\n\nBoston Logan Airport, Manchester-Boston Regional Airport.\n\nMountain statistics\n\nLoon Mountain sits in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, atop more than 400 skiable acres of terrain. It has 73 trails and 10 treed areas across three separate peaks. You’ll have more than 30 miles of trails to cover, heading up to a peak of 3,050 ft.\n\nAccommodations\n\nAs the only ski-in/ski-out lodging on Loon Mountain, you can’t get any more convenience than a weekend at The Mountain Club Resort and Spa. For those looking for high-end suites, Riverwalk Resort at Loon Mountain has just opened with exceptional dining, an on-site winery, and all the amenities you’d expect at a world-class four-season resort.\n\nDining\n\nLoon Mountain caters to traditional mountain eateries like pubs, sports bars, diners, and, of course, at least one taco spot. For more upscale options, head into the nearby area. Try the Sugar Hill Inn or the 1902 Dining Room at the Omni Mount Washington.\n\nActivities\n\nThis resort caters to the entire family, not just the powder hounds. In addition to all the downhill experiences, check out their Sno-Go rentals, tubing, snowshoe trails, and chill Gondola Skyrides.\n\nAprès ski\n\nAccording to legend, the Paul Bunyan Room, just upstairs in the Octagon Lodge, is “the birthplace of après at Loon.” On Sundays, Babe’s Blue Ox Lounge, with its Bloody Mary Bar, also makes a great after-mountain pitstop.\n\n11. Smugglers’ Notch Resort\n\nLocation\n\nVermont, USA\n\nNearby airports\n\nBurlington International Airport.\n\nMountain statistics\n\nMadonna, Sterling, and Morse are the three mountains at Smugglers’ Notch, interconnected and spread across more than 1,000 acres of terrain — making it the US’s biggest East Coast ski resort. There are 78 trails, several major meadows, and the Fab Five, a set of “the most pulse pounding Black Diamonds in the East.”\n\nAmong East Coast mountains, Smugglers Notch also gets some of the highest amounts of snowfall in the region, on average 280″ a season. Thanks to their snow making capacity, when the snow isn’t there, they can “blanket all 3 mountains from top to bottom.”\n\nAccommodations\n\nThe accommodations in and around Smugglers’ Notch lean into the quaint New England charm, from bed and breakfasts to inns in historic residences. For fully equipped ski chalets with enough space and privacy for your entire party, check out the many high-end private rentals or travel a little further afield to Tälta Lodge, A Bluebird by Lark, or the Stone Hill Inn.\n\nDining\n\nThere are a few nearby or mountain dining options at Smugglers’ Notch, but if you are headed here for more than a weekend, you’ll want to work with your travel concierge to ensure your accommodation is fully stocked.\n\nActivities\n\nExperience all that winter in New England has to offer with dogsledding adventures, ice fishing tours, tubing, bonfires, and an ongoing roster of events at Smugglers’ Notch. If you’re traveling with your family, you’ll find a neverending lineup of extracurriculars to keep everyone busy, from movie nights to the fun zone to an ongoing winter carnival.\n\nAprès ski\n\nThe après-ski events at Smugglers’ Notch are decidedly more focused on family entertainment than the riotous après atmosphere at other mountains. According to Ski Mag, this means cute mascots and “goofy apres reindeer games.” If you are child-free and seeking more adult-oriented après, head to the local legend Lot 1 parking lot.\n\n12. Okemo Mountain Resort\n\nLocation\n\nVermont, USA\n\nNearby airports\n\nRutland Airport, Albany Airport.\n\nMountain statistics\n\nBoasting the highest vertical in Southern Vermont, 121 trails, slopes, and glades, and 20 lifts, Okemo Mountain is one of the best-kept secrets on the East Coast. It’s located on top of 632 acres of accessible terrain.\n\nOkemo also has 98 percent snowmaking coverage across all its terrain. Combined with 200″ of average annual snowfall, rest assured any weekend spent here is going to have snowy conditions.\n\nAccommodations\n\nOkemo Mountain has an excellent selection of ski-in/ski-out accommodations. From private condo rentals right at the base of the mountain to six-bedroom family-friendly homes in the Solitude Village area, you are guaranteed to have everything you need to enjoy a weeklong ski vacation.\n\nDining\n\nOkemo has a handful of standout options hidden away in the nearby mountains. Check out The Fullerton Inn, the Rest Rooster at the Woodstock Inn and Resort, and the Dorset Inn.\n\nActivities\n\nWhen you aren’t chasing fresh tracks, Okemo Mountain supports all the traditional wintertime activities you’d want from a classic Vermont ski trip: ice skating, lessons, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing. But it also has a few unexpected options, including the Timber Ripper Mountain Coaster for kids, fat tire bike rentals, and maple sugaring all season long.\n\nAprès ski\n\nFor a ski-in/ski-out après, head to 43° North, which has a revolving menu and casual fireside drinks.

With 66 percent of its trails and terrain focused on green and blue runs, this is one of the best beginner ski resorts on the East Coast. All of this adds up to make this one of the greatest mountains in Maine.\n\nAccommodations\n\nSunday River’s premier on-mountain accommodation is undeniably the Jordan Hotel.

Seven Springs Resort\n\nLocation\n\nPennsylvania, USA\n\nNearest airports\n\nArnold Palmer Regional Airport, John Murtha Johnstown-Cambria County Airport, Morgantown Municipal Airport.\n\nMountain statistics\n\nAnother mountain in the Vail umbrella, Seven Springs Resort is a small but mighty winter destination, with three-quarters of its terrain ideal for beginners and intermediate riders. The highest peak is 2,994 feet, surrounded by 285 inbound acres and 33 idyllic trails.\n\nThis mountain is known for not one but seven world-class terrain parks, featuring the Super, the only 22-foot halfpipe on the East Coast.\n\nAccommodations\n\nFind the classic slopeside chalet of your dreams around Seven Springs. The Tyrol Chalets maintain the rustic charm of ski chalets of days gone by but with premiere and upgraded modern amenities. For larger groups, reserve the Classic Chalets, which can host up to 18 people and come with fully equipped kitchens, fireplaces, and access to the lodge’s pool facilities.\n\nDining\n\nSeven Springs is all about classic mountain dining experiences. These may not be fancy, but they all capture the magic of a weekend on the mountain. Whether it’s Helen’s Bavarian Lounge or Zambo’s Country Cottage Restaurant, you can always find rich and deeply comforting meals.\n\nActivities\n\nWhen the weather isn’t cooperating, Seven Springs offers more off-mountain winter activities than most resorts — and crucially, many don’t rely on snow conditions. Local favorites include ax throwing, bowling, mini golf, and the Trillium Spa.\n\nAprès ski\n\nAt Seven Springs, the Foggy Goggle is legendary for its après. It serves up all the post-mountain greasy-spoon classics and curates a lineup of live music over the weekends. If you ever wondered where the locals go on the weekends, this is it. It is consistently rated one of the best ski resort bars on the East Coast.\n\nThe biggest east coast ski resorts.\n\nIf you’re after breathtaking terrain and miles-long runs, you’ll want to plan a ski trip to Killington, Vermont. It is the biggest East Coast ski resort, boasting 141 runs across six mountain peaks. Its most significant vertical drop is over 3,000 feet.\n\nAnother impressive East Coast ski resort sits just across the Canadian border in Quebec: Mont Tremblant. This European-style ski resort has 755 inbound skiable acres, including 178 acres of glades. Tremblant has over a hundred trails, served by 14 modern ski lifts.\n\nThe best family ski resort on the east coast.\n\nHeading to the mountains with the family? A few resorts stand out thanks to their easy, beginner-friendly slopes, off-mountain activities, and ski school advantages. A world-class option is, once again, Mont Tremblant in Quebec, Canada. It’s got something for everyone in the family — not just the kids.\n\nAs one reader of Ski Magazine said:\n\nYou’re always feeling welcome at Mont Tremblant, the staff and the vibe is just super cool and European. We love it there. We’ve taken our kids a few times (we live in upstate NY) and it’s always such a fun and different ski vacation, from the food (delicious, SO much better than the US resorts) and lodging to the scenery and the skiing itself. It really is a great family trip.\n\nThe best ski resorts on the east coast.\n\nThe best resorts on the East Coast combine New England hospitality and tradition with award-winning slopes and first-class amenities.\n\nOnce again, Mont Tremblant in Quebec tops the list, but south of the border in the US, Whiteface Mountain in New York is an equal contender.\n\nNestled in the Adirondack High Peaks area of New York, Whiteface Mountain is an imposing mountainous setting. In and around the nearby town of Lake Placid, you’ll find world-class all-season resorts and dining options — with Whiteface Lodge sitting front and center.\n\nWhatever mountain you choose, be sure to get there with Volato. Skip the treacherous mountain highway conditions and get to the lift line faster by booking a private jet-chartered ski trip today.\n\nThe most beautiful ski resorts in the USA.\n\nThey say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, yet when it comes to comparing the beauty between ski resorts, it’s more often than not about comparing the mountains and landscape.\n\nIf breathtaking peaks and sweeping forested ranges are what you’re after, check out Stowe Mountain in Vermont and Whiteface Mountain in upstate New York. Both have stunning natural scenery, especially with a fresh blanket of powder dusting the trees.\n\nThe best ski resorts for nightlife on the east coast.\n\nJetting out of the city for a weekend ski trip may be about chasing powder stashes and getting in a few turns. But, it might also be about the nightlife. Ski towns everywhere are known to get a little rowdy thanks to the entrenched après culture.\n\nAccording to Ski Magazine, if you are chasing an afterparty, you’ll want to plan to hit the Wobbly Barn at Killington Resort in Vermont after your laps. Another energetic option is the party at Stowe Mountain Resort.\n\nThe best beginner ski resorts east coast.\n\nNot everyone looks for steep terrain and challenging black diamond runs. The best beginner ski resorts in the East have more blue and green runs than others and great ski schools for kids and adults alike.\n\nSunday River in Maine is just one example. A full 30 percent of its terrains are certified blue, which means you can casually work on your turns on wide, beautifully groomed trails.\n\nAnother beginner-friendly mountain is Whiteface near Lake Placid, New York, which is stacked with a large beginner area, easy runs, and practice lifts near the base.\n\nWhat to consider when planning a ski trip and choosing a resort.\n\nGetting there\n\nFirst and foremost, with most East Coast ski resorts tucked into the mountains, you’ll want to consider travel time and road conditions. For example, are you planning a weekend away in upstate New York? You’ll have to consider the long hours of driving to get there, and if you happen to be leaving on a Friday, traffic congestion is going to be working against you.\n\nUnless, of course, you plan to fly to a nearby airport. Book a private charter with Volato for your next ski weekend to make sure you are on the mountain for fresh tracks come Saturday. We’ll get you back in time for your Monday morning meeting without the stress of snowy mountain highways.\n\nAmenities and accommodations\n\nA secondary consideration is the on- and off-mountain amenities. Not every resort has the grand ski chalets you might envision for your weekend in the mountains. That’s where your travel concierge comes in handy.\n\nVolato customers who join Quintessentially, the world’s leading lifestyle concierge company, will receive a fast-tracked application, a waived joining fee of $1500, and a travel credit of up to $1000.\n\nWorking with Quintessentially for all your ski trip planning will ensure every detail is planned long before you hit the slopes, from locking in the area’s most exclusive lodgings to lift tickets and VIP rental services to evening reservations at the mountain’s most sought-after establishment.\n\nWith options getting booked up long before the mountain opens for the season, you’ll need to have Volato and Quintessentially working on your behalf to ensure your weekend on the slopes goes off without a hitch.\n\nGet the most out of this ski season with Volato.\n\nFrom the expansive terrain of Killington Resort in Vermont to the family-friendly atmosphere of Mont Tremblant in Quebec, there’s no shortage of options for your East Coast winter getaway."
