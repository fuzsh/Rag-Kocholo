        "text": "Jenn Tran's season of The Bachelorette is well underway, and it's clear that this PA student isn't messing around. She's already sent tons of her suitors packing as the group makes their way ~down under~ around Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSo far, Brendan Barnum, Brett Harris, Dakota Nobles, Kevin McDevitt, Matt Arnold, Caleb “Moze” Smith, Ricky Martinez, Jahaan Ansari, Marvin Goodly, and Brian Autz have gone home. And there are many more eliminations coming, according to Reality Steve's spoilers.\n\nAs you probably remember, Jenn is from Miami, and made it to the final six of Joey’s season. After going home ahead of Hometowns, the 26-year-old is looking for a man who is as reliable and thoughtful as she is, according to her ABC bio.\n\nDespite it being early in the season, Bach Nation already has their favorites. 29-year-old Aaron from Tulsa, Oklahoma, is the brother of Bachelorette season 16 alum Noah Erb. Sam McKinney is getting lots of attention after he caught Jenn’s eye early on.\n\nAnother guy to keep your eye on? Marcus Shoberg, who is a military vet who attends Harvard. And don’t sleep on Devin Strader, the Texan who owns his own freight company (and is already causing lots of drama).\n\nMarcus, who got the season's first one-on-one, has already hinted about his strong start. \"Best first date ever 🫶🏼\" he captioned an accompanying Instagram post.\n\nJenn has been super positive about her season—and even strongly suggested on the Call Her Daddy podcast that she ends up engaged and happy.\n\n“People were like, 'She’s too boring,' or 'She’s too crazy, she wants to take shots,'” Jenn said. “It’s like, God forbid I want to take a shot! I didn’t know that once you get engaged—once you find love, you can't take a shot.”\n\nAnd while Jenn seems happy with the outcome of her season, she has shared that she’s not thrilled that there weren’t a lot of Asian contestants in the mix. “I can’t really speak to the casting process and the decisions that were made, but it is unfortunate that there weren’t a lot of Asian men this season,” she told Glamour in July.\n\nShe did call out one suitor, Thomas N., who comes from a Vietnamese family.\n\n“Asian men haven’t always seen themselves in this position, and I am hoping that me being here and Thomas N. being there, that the both of us can inspire other Asian men to realize that they can do this too if they want,” she said. “They can be in this position as well. I’m hoping that it inspires them.”"
