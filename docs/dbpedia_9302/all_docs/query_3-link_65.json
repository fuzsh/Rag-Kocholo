        "text": "Scholar Spotlight: Stephan, Suitland High School\n\nI was born here in Prince George’s County. When I was three-years-old, my mom and I moved in with my grandmother just a few miles from here, and I’ve been with her ever since. I’m also the oldest of seven kids. And I’ve always felt like I had to set an example for them. I can’t say college was on my mind all the time, but it was definitely on my grandma’s mind!\n\nWhen I joined College Track, I didn’t know a lot of the other students. It felt like the first day of school all over again. Then they took us on a two-day retreat in the middle of nowhere. Over those two days, we didn’t just learn about the program, we learned about each other. We talked about our families, what subjects we like, what we want to be when we grow up. We forged a bond over this shared experience.\n\nNow, there’s this whole group of people I can’t wait to see at school every day who I may never have even met! And while I may only be a freshman in high school, I am ready to take ownership of my life and create a future of my own design. I also want to be a voice and an advocate for my community. If I’ve learned anything from growing up here, it’s that everyone has different ideas, opinions, dreams, and beliefs… but we are all human beings. And we deserve to be heard."
