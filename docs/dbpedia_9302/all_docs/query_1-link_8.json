        "text": "Playing like a vivid dream sequence in which the members of A Shoreline Dream gently lull you to sleep, the act's new video for \"Manhattan Beach\" looks precisely what you'd expect it to look like just based upon hearing the band's dreamy compositions.\n\nExtreme close-ups of the members faces and their instruments are layered upon one another forming a composite image that gradually blurs and then comes into focus. Although there's no still life shots of landscapes or train stations, the stylized clip somehow adeptly manages to capture the distinctive overall aesthetic the group has already established with the artwork and photos that adorns its fliers and recordings."
