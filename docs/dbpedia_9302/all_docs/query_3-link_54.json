        "text": "On “Home Town,” Erin and Ben Napier recently had the privilege of heading back to their old college to not only take a walk down memory lane but also renovate a building on campus.\n\nIn the Season 8 episode “Homecoming,” Erin and Ben meet newlyweds Ginny and Jon Ryan Fennell. Jon Ryan works at Erin and Ben’s alma mater, Jones College, and he has the opportunity to move into a house on the grounds. The property needs some work, which is where Erin and Ben come in.\n\nThe HGTV stars are excited to be back.\n\n“This is where we met,” Erin says. “We had our first date in the student union. Everyone on both sides of our family went to school here.”\n\nThe school owns the 1913 building they’re remodeling, and it’s willing to invest up to $150,000 to make this house feel like a true home for Jon Ryan and Ginny, plus all future tenants.\n\nWhile Erin and Ben are visiting the school, Jones College President Jesse Smith surprises the couple by asking if they can name a school after them: The Erin and Ben School of Design & Building Arts. Of course, the HGTV couple are thrilled.\n\n“This is an unbelievable honor,” Ben says, and Erin expresses hope for their daughters to attend Jones College one day.\n\nRead on to find out how Erin and Ben’s homecoming goes—and how they make this campus housing feel like a real home. Along the way, you’ll learn many lessons you can apply to any abode, even your own.\n\nA big porch makes a house look more welcoming\n\nThis four-bedroom, two-bathroom structure was built in 1913 as the home economics house and was later used as the college president’s house. Still, by the time Erin and Ben tour the place with Ginny and Jon Ryan, the structure feels a little commercial.\n\nErin and Ben note that it’s not clear if this place is a home or office space.\n\n“It feels like it doesn’t belong to anyone,” Erin says.\n\nErin is determined to make the structure feel more homey, and one way she does this is by expanding the entry and creating a screened porch.\n\nThis porch will make the house “friendlier,” she says. It’ll create a great, weather-safe place to greet guests.\n\nWhen the house is finished, Ginny and Jon Ryan are impressed by the new porch. It adds livable space while making the exterior look more like a traditional home and less like an office.\n\nThis kitchen should ‘look the way fresh-baked bread smells’\n\nWhen Erin and Ben tour the kitchen, the space looks dated and plain. It doesn’t match Ginny’s vision for the room: a warm, welcoming place where she can teach students how to make bread.\n\nErin is inspired by Ginny’s baking ambitions and aims to make the kitchen “look the way fresh-baked bread smells.”\n\nErin orders oak cabinets and selects a stain that gives the wood a bread-like color. When Erin’s project manager asks if the chosen stain reminds her of fresh bread, Erin says it does.\n\n“It feels crusty—in a good way,” Erin notes.\n\nTile shape can make a backsplash look special\n\nTo complete this kitchen, Erin selects a backsplash tile that she thinks is truly special.\n\n“I was looking for something that’s a little unusual and not just the normal, like, subway tile shape,” she says. “All these great colors, it has a lot of warmth. I mean, it looks like Calacatta gold marble.”\n\nIndeed, the color and shape of this tile help the kitchen stand out. Plus, Ben thinks it goes well with the kitchen’s baking theme.\n\n“It looks to me like bread loves, stacked,” he says.\n\nUse every inch of a large dining room\n\nJon Ryan and Ginny say that they love to entertain and are hoping to host students in the home. So Erin and Ben want to make sure there’s plenty of seating for large groups.\n\n“The house gave us a great gift in that the dining room is big,” Erin says. “They wanted this to be very central to the student-life community. I think this house will be a very rich place for connection.”\n\nBen builds two rectangular tables out of oak. They’re lovely tables on their own, but they include a latch that allows the two tables to form one square table. These tables will be perfect for hosting small or large groups, and they look perfect in the dining room.\n\nIt shows how those who are blessed with a large dining space should use the square footage to their advantage. Just one six-seat table would look tiny in this room, so Ben’s double tables make this space look like it’s ready for a party!\n\nPeel-and-stick wallpaper is a great way to make a rental feel homey\n\nPartway through the renovation, Jon Ryan and Ginny reveal to Erin and Ben that they’re expecting a baby. Erin is thrilled to design a nursery for them, but she also knows that they won’t live in this house forever since it belongs to the school. So she doesn’t want to make the nursery feel too permanent.\n\nOne way she gives this space a nursery style without making too many adjustments is with peel-and-stick wallpaper.\n\n“This can just be peeled off the wall whenever the next family comes in. It doesn’t damage the wall,” Erin explains to her mom, Karen, and her best friend, Mallorie, who come to help her put it up.\n\nHowever, Mallorie says that she doesn’t think Erin should worry about needing to remove this particular wallpaper.\n\n“I don’t know. I feel like once it’s up there, anybody that is in this house will love this,” she says."
