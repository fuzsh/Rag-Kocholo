        "text": "Meet Julio Gonzalez\n\nJulio Gonzalez is pursuing an associate degree in advanced manufacturing at Shoreline Community College and holds a 4.0 GPA. Upon graduation, he intends to use the skills heâ€™s learned in the program to meet his childhood dream and career goals of opening and running his own machine shop. In addition to working toward a career he enjoys, Gonzalez hopes to make a difference by bringing practical solutions to problems people encounter in their everyday lives.\n\nLegislative Priority: Expand Opportunity for Students and Employers\n\nFully funding our budget requests will have real returns for students like Julio Gonzalez and for the communities and employers in our area. Students will learn from competitively-paid experts who choose to work at Shoreline Community College rather than pursue higher paying positions with private employers or K-12 schools. Our students will train for careers in robust workforce programs, with modern equipment and learning spaces that mirror their future work environments. We will be able to expand technology to bring a college education to more people in more ways, which is especially important for working adults. And, all our students will benefit from an inclusive environment where they are valued, supported and equipped to reach their goals.\n\nShoreline Community College will also receive funding to operate and maintain existing facilities, build its STE(A)M Education Center, and design and build its Comprehensive Student Services Center."
