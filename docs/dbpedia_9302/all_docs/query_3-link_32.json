During my medical school interview, I was impressed by the close-knit community I observed at a pre-interview dinner with current students, namely Sophia Ederaine, Lucky Krog, Johanny Lopez Dominguez, and Josh Spegman. I saw a group of individuals who were passionate about making a positive impact working collaboratively to make an impact. The abundant opportunities for professional growth and support further solidified my decision.
