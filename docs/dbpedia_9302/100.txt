Life's great when friends and family are close by, that's why we love rewarding you for referring your nearest and dearest to Shoreline.

Here's how it works...

When you refer someone to join you at Shoreline, you both receive a $1,000 Visa gift card when they settle on their block of land. It's that simple! Talk to the sales team for more details and a referral form.

“When we decided to build, we knew about Shoreline and thought it would be suitable for our family. The location was a big factor for us. We wanted something accessible to the highway as my husband and I both work a 30–40-minute drive away, yet also accessible by bus to the schools our kids go to.”

“Our fellow residents are lovely and it has been wonderful to be on this journey with them. These are the people that we will be seeing every day for as long as we live in the estate, which we hope is a very long time. create a new life for ourselves. The future of Shoreline and the surrounding area were also a key player in us choosing to build here."

“The location was a big selling point. We loved that Thompsons Beach (Victoria Point) was just up the road, Cleveland and Raby Bay also a short drive. It gave us that coastal lifestyle we were after. In Sydney it was such a hassle to get to the coast. Here, it’s on our doorstep."
