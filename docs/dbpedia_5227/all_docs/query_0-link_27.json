        "text": "Philadelphia's museums are rolling out faith-related treasures to mark Pope Francis' visit to the city — including a few from the pontiff's own backyard at the Vatican and other repositories in Rome.\n\nThe Franklin Institute offers a traveling exhibit of papal art, historical and devotional objects for several months, while the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University and the Philadelphia Museum of Art are calling attention to their collections' wealth of connections to faith in general and the Catholic Church in particular.\n\nSo even if viewers don't get to see the pope himself, they can immerse themselves in his and his predecessors' cultural context, and those of other Christian denominations, by making a pilgrimage to one of Philadelphia's big institutions.\n\nChief among the pope-related exhibits is \"Vatican Splendors: A Journey through Faith and Art\" at the Franklin Institute, which was put together with the help of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, according to Troy Collins, a senior vice president at the institute.\n\nThe Vatican and other Roman museums are not about to lend objects such as a reliquary containing bone fragments of St. Peter, the first pope, and St. Paul, without a good reference. Archbishop Charles Chaput and his staff were happy to oblige when the Franklin Institute began organizing an exhibit to coincide with the World Meeting of Families.\n\n\"We did not know if the pope was going to attend, but we thought that (meeting) was enough of an impetus for us to talk to the Vatican lenders to get something that would complement the pope's visit,\" says Collins.\n\n\"The archdiocese played a very large role in making this happen. There is a very strict protocol in which letters are exchanged, all in Italian, in which all of these objects are approved.\"\n\n\"Vatican Splendors\" takes a historical journey through 2,000 years of church history, displaying art and artifacts from early Christianity, the Byzantine period, the Renaissance and the Reformation and up to today.\n\nAmong the earliest references is a cast of ancient graffiti from the tomb that underlies the altar of the Basilica of Saint Peter in Rome: \"Petros Eni,\" or \"Peter is here.\" Later stages of the monumental work at the Vatican are represented by documents signed by Michelangelo and Bernini, as well as other architects of the basilica.\n\nVisitors will be able to connect with a late, beloved pontiff by touching a bronze cast of the hand of Saint John Paul II, and get acquainted with four of his predecessors whose portraits survived a disastrous fire at Saint Peter's Basilica in 1823.\n\n\"Forty percent of the objects are new to the exhibit. Many of the objects have never been outside Rome. Many have never been exhibited in Rome,\" says Collins.\n\n\"Vatican Splendors\" opens Sept. 19 and runs through Feb. 15, 2016. The museum plans to offer a program in which scientists from the institute discuss the preservation of ancient objects.\n\nThe Franklin Institute is at 222 N. 20th St. Hours are 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., with special exhibits open until 9 p.m. Thursday through Saturday (last admission 7:30 p.m.). Hours on Sept. 25 are 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; the museum is closed Sept. 26 and 27.\n\nAdmission is $19.95 for adults and $15.95 for those ages 3 through 11. Information: www.fi.edu or 215-448-1200.\n\nThe Academy of Natural Sciences draws on centuries of exploration, much of it done by faith leaders, in \"The Clergy and the Academy's Collections.\" The museum also says it's carrying out the mission of St. Francis of Assisi, for whom the pope has a special devotion.\n\nSt. Francis was known for his love of animals and the natural world. \"The Academy advances these same principles through research, education and public engagement in biodiversity and environmental science,\" according to curator Greg Cowper in a press release. (The museum also has scheduled a forum on climate change Sept. 21, with a Vatican science adviser.)\n\nMembers of many other faiths had a similar regard for nature, such as John Bachman, who worked with John James Audubon on \"The Birds of America;\" and Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg, who discovered the box turtle. Bachman and Muhlenberg were Lutheran ministers, as was Frederick Valentine Melsheimer, author of the first catalog of Pennsylvania insects in 1806.\n\nThe exhibit includes specimens of the turtle named for Muhlenberg and a bird named for Bachman, as well as animals collected by the late Brother Nicéforo María Antoine Rouhaire, a 20th-century teacher for whom more than 100 animals and plants have been named.\n\n\"The Clergy and the Academy's Collections\" is on view through Oct. 23 in the museum's Library Gallery. \"Climate change: A New Dialogue\" with Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University,\" is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Sept. 21. Admission is free, but preregistration is required: www.ansp.org/visit/events.\n\nThe Academy of Natural Sciences is at 1900 Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Library Gallery hours during the World Meeting of Families are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sept. 21, 24 and 25; 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sept. 22 and 23. Admission is $17.95 for adults and $13.95 for ages 3 through 12. Information: 215-299-1000 or ansp.org.\n\nThe Philadelphia Museum of Art is rich in works related to the pope's favorite saint, including masterpieces painted in the 15th century by Jan van Eyck and Fra Angelico. To honor the pope's visit and the World Meeting of Families, the museum organized a self-guided walking tour of seven faith-related objects from its vast holdings.\n\nThese include van Eyck's \"Saint Francis of Assisi Receiving the Stigmata,\" painted between 1430 and 1432 with a wealth of religious symbolism, including a winged crucifix. In a nearby gallery hangs Fra Angelico's \"Saint Francis of Assisi\" from around 1427, which likely was painted as a prop for one of the mystery plays popular at the time.\n\nThe museum's \"Art and Faith Tour\" includes a third St. Francis painting, \"Saint Francis Renouncing the World for the Cloister,\" painted in the Netherlands around 1500; an altarpiece by Vittore Crivelli from 1481; two crucifixes and several other paintings of religious scenes.\n\nThe Philadelphia Museum of Art is at 2600 Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday and until 8:45 p.m. Wednesdays and Fridays. Admission is $20 for adults, $18 for seniors and $14 for those 13 through 18. Visitors 12 and under get in free.\n\nInformation: philamuseum.org or 215-763-8100.\n\nGwen Shrift: 215-949-4204; email: gshrift@calkins.com"
