One of the world’s most respected sound designers created some of the D-50’s most recognizable sounds.

For 21 years beginning in 1984, Spectrasonics founder Eric Persing was a consultant and chief sound designer for Roland. One of his most celebrated accomplishments with that company was programming many of the factory patches for the popular D-50 synthesizer, along with fellow sound designer Adrian Scott. In celebration of the D-50’s 30th anniversary in 2017, Eric appeared in these two promotional videos, in which he demonstrates some of the now-familiar sounds that sprang from his imagination.
