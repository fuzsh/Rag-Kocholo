What makes this performance unique is that the Omnisphere 2 patch that Persing plays was sampled directly from the real hang drum that Briem is playing.\n\nAside from the obvious, this jam just sounds cool. Watching these passionate musicians improvise and explore different percussive textures was a treat to watch. If you are unfamiliar with Omnisphere 2, watch a demo of it here."
