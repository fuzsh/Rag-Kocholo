His music software and virtual instruments have provided new sounds that have changed the way musicians and film makers make music. His early work as Chief Sound Designer for Roland Japan included creating the sounds for the company's legendary instruments - from the analog Jupiters and Junos, all the way through the classic D-50, the V-Drums, the V-Synth and many more. In 1994, Eric and his wife established Spectrasonics and helped usher in a new era of computer software instruments with such products as Stylus RMX, Trilian and their flagship synth Omnisphere."
