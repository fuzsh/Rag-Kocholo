And I’ve noticed that how we deal with it in our circles of influence is not …\n\nWorship Team Building // Dealing With ComplacencyRead More\n\nI understand in this day and age (online giving and what not) that not every church has an offering time during the service.

I begin to wonder if we are merely a society that reflects what we’ve seen in …\n\nSunday is DyingRead More\n\nAn “aha moment” as Oprah has so called it…that’s what I had. Months ago I attended Sunday evening chapel at America’s Keswick in Whiting, NJ. This place is something that I have taken for granted.
