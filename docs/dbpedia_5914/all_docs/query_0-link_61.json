        "text": "Spectrasonics has updated Omnisphere to version 2.1, adding a feature for sharing user sounds and a new Library Publishing capability.\n\n“Now third-party developers of patch sets for Omnisphere 2 have a simple way to create and offer custom libraries,” says Spectrasonics’ Founder and Creative Director, Eric Persing. “There’s no need for installers or complicated instructions for moving files around directories deep in the system folders. And because it’s so easy to share sounds and ideas now, we feel this will be a huge boon for social media user groups discussing tips and patch creation. This is a big opportunity for our users everywhere. We look forward to seeing and hearing what develops!”\n\nSharing sounds is simplified in Omnisphere 2.1 – simply shift-click on a few Patches or a few Multi-patches and then save them to be transferred to a friend or musical collaborator who also has Omnisphere 2.\n\nSharing patches automatically includes any user audio, which is especially convenient with custom patches. Sharing multiple types of Patches, Multis and user audio all at once is easier too, with Project sharing; the end-user can just collect a set of sounds in a project, and then share the project.\n\nThe new “Publish Library” feature in v2.1 was created for third-party developers of Omnisphere libraries. It allows developers to easily export, or “publish” a library of Multis and Patches, along with any associated user-created Soundsources, as well as graphic images for the custom library in a single .omnisphere file format. End-users can then easily install this package into their systems with a single step.\n\nHere’s what’s new in Omnisphere v2.1\n\nNew Sound Sharing and Publishing capabilities:\n\nEasily share patches and projects between users, which can include User Audio.\n\nPublish a library of patches and Multis including User Audio, graphics and more.\n\nShare Sounds over social media\n\nFaster Boot Time: Opening the plugin inside any DAW on Macintosh or Windows is much speedier."
