        "text": "Featuring the Spectrasonics Advanced Groove Engine!\n\nStylus RMX is a completely new groove-based virtual instrument plug-in for Macintosh and Windows. Stylus RMX is the first product to offer the combined power of Groove Control™ with Spectrasonics Advanced Groove Engine (S.A.G.E.™) technology giving users dramatic new control over groove production and performance.\n\nSpectrasonics' in-house development team created the new instrument from the ground up, with dozens of new features including the ground-breaking Chaos Designer™, a completely redesigned multi-page user interface, a new core library of sounds, all with a focus on realtime groove creation and performance.\n\nNew Core library\n\nThe massive new 7.4 gigabyte core-library in Stylus RMX has thousands of cutting-edge grooves and sounds that were created by Spectrasonics' international sound design team, and produced by Eric Persing. The new core library contains nearly triple the amount of sounds originally offered in the original Stylus, and contains all the original material as well. The new sounds and grooves in Stylus RMX offer a much wider range of modern musical genres than the original Stylus. Mixes of grooves are broken down into individual tracks called Elements for flexibility and infinite combinations.\n\nAlso new in Stylus RMX are thousands of new Kit modules, 250 Kit patches, as well as user Kit construction....Users can create their own customized multitrack remix grooves and kits, save them into the plug-in, and even share them with other Stylus RMX users on different platforms and hosts. RMX 1.5 even comes with 500 new Multi grooves!\n\n\"Xpandable\"\n\nStylus RMX marks Spectrasonics' first expandable virtual instrument, with a series of five new \"S.A.G.E. Xpanders\" for Stylus RMX. Stylus RMX also can be expanded with existing Groove Control CD-ROM libraries and even REX files - which opens the door for musicians to utilize their own audio loops within the powerful S.A.G.E. Environment.\n\nChaos Designer™\n\nOf the many new capabilities in Stylus RMX, possibly the most innovative feature is the Chaos Designer™. With simple controls, the user can introduce musical Chaos into the groove, which allows it to have constantly evolving variations - giving the impression that the audio grooves are improvising. The results can be subtle or extreme by setting the simple to use controls. A Capture feature allows the spontaneous audio chaos patterns to be made into a MIDI file, dragged and dropped into the host sequencer, and played back again for further editing by the user.\n\nStylus RMX operates as a virtual instrument software plug-in for Macintosh and Windows in all major hosts including Apple Logic™, MOTU Digital Performer™, Digidesign Pro Tools™, Ableton Live™, Steinberg Cubase™ 4 or later, Nuendo™, V-Stack™, Apple Garage Band™, Fruity Loops™, Sony Acid Pro™, Cakewalk Sonar™, Project 5™ and many other VST and Audio Unit host applications.\n\nA total of over 13 Gigabytes of massive sounds and grooves!\n\nDon't forget ILIO's S.A.G.E. Xpanders!"
