        "text": "Spectrasonics has released Omnisphere 2.5, a massive new update that adds hardware synth integration, a new sound library and expanded synthesis…\n\nThe new version marks a big step for not only Spectrasonics, but for soft synths as Omnisphere 2.5 becomes the first of its kind to offer hardware synth integration, which transforms over 30 well-known hardware synthesiser into hands-on controllers.\n\nThere’s plenty more to play with in the new update too! 2.5 includes a hi-resolution interface, support for Windows Multitouch, new Granular Synthesis capabilities and over 1000 brand new sounds, knocking the total to over 14,000 sounds.\n\n“Since the beginning of computer-based music, the biggest limitation of software synthesizers has been the lack of physical interaction. It’s hard to beat the immediacy of a physical synthesizer that you can touch! We are very excited to be able to finally eliminate that problem by utilizing the world’s finest hardware synthesizers to fully control Omnisphere.” said Eric Persing, President of Spectrasonics. “We’ve never felt that the worlds of software and hardware synths should be divided into different ‘camps’. Our virtual instrument users can now experience the joy of the hardware synth workflow and hardware synth users can now fully expand their capabilities into the vast sonic world of Omnisphere!”\n\nOmnisphere 2.5 key features:\n\nHardware Synth Integration!\n\nNew Hardware Library adds over 1,000 new patches for all users:\n\nOver 14,000 Sounds total now included\n\nVastly Expanded Synthesis:\n\nFour Layers per patch\n\nDoubled Mod Matrix\n\nOver 100 New Wavetables\n\nNew State Variable Filters\n\n8 LFOs, 12 Envelopes\n\nNew Hi-res, Resizable Interface\n\nNew Granular Layout\n\nImproved Live Mode Page\n\nNew Shared Signal Path routing\n\nNew System Tuning/Scale functions\n\nWindows Multitouch support\n\nFREE for all Omnisphere 2 users!"
