        "text": "@kobamoto said:\n\nyeah but there's nothing on the iPad like omnisphere in a million years\n\nI'd agree with that and I'd also say there are infinite ways to flip a sample on ios with a single app and especially with apps strung together. Out of hundreds of music apps I've used on ios, I've never installed a granular app so I wasn't sure if there was something anywhere near this one feature, either in an app, or through them strung together.\n\nNot that it's the same, but I almost got borderlands then I heard there was a v2 coming out which and it looks like it's still not out? Off the top of my head grain science, iPulsaret, iDensity, Protein der klang (sp?), stria, ikaosillater, samplr, flux, etc, variations in a chain might offer something similar, but there are a lot of threads/presets here so if anyone wants to be a gent and reveal a secret weapon....\n\nComplete emulation of Omnisphere and its huge library, haha, no way.\n\neven if it doesn't do real granular I'm interested if it sounds just as good mangling samples and is easy to get them into and out of the app with a great workflow in-between. what I love about eric persing is that he trys to make everything as easy to access as possible. he's such a genius but doesn't try to complicate things just for the sake of complicating things.\n\nLike many threads here, this one sent me back to a neglected app, in this case GrainScience, which is one synth that actually granilarizes your waves - from drop box audio copy or iTunes file - for real, not in quotes, as mentioned above Mitosynth doesn't do it. The other app would be iPulsaret, that imports and actually granularizes. Import isn't too technical in either, granular synthesis is deep to ultra deep on these two, GrainScience lets you blend and work with two sources/voices\n\n@kobamoto said:\n\nto achieve like results in that omnisphere demo?\n\ncause if so I might have to check these apps out\n\nMore so with Grainscience because it blends two voices- it's gets very fat and it moves, with tons of fx.\n\nThe modulation and programming gets really deep, and it's universal.\n\nCheckout the demos (Tim Webb)\n\n(Wooji juice, several short ones very illuminating)\n\nthere's a lot to it for $10. This plus Mitosynth gets you quite a ways towards omni...\n\n@Littlewoodg said:\n\nCrystal XT for iPad, a port from the amazing free vst\n\nWait, what? How come this one never gets mentioned? This is the first time I knew of its existence. I played around a little bit with the free VSTi, and found that it didn't have a lot of good out-of-the-box useable presets, but was best for playing around with mixing and matching different sounds to come up with some new, unique ones."
