The vast new library was produced by Spectrasonics’ Founder, Eric Persing, and features a tremendous variety of patches created by the company’s renowned Sound Development team, to showcase the power of combining Keyscape and Omnisphere 2. Keyscape’s richly detailed keyboard sounds can be dramatically transformed using Omnisphere 2’s deep synthesis capabilities.

His first independent release in 2008, ‘Maybe I’m Dreaming,’ received much praise and made Young into a phenomenon, with over 16 million profile views and over 80 million plays on MySpace, all stemming from posting a few songs from the year before.\n\nThat’s led to Owl City’s newest CD – ‘Ocean Eyes’ – released in 2009 by Universal Republic Records. The album has sold over 1 million copies in the U.S. alone, while the first single “Fireflies” hit #1 in 23 countries. During the making of the ‘Ocean Eyes’ album Young discovered Focal Twin6 Be monitors, then got himself a pair. “I absolutely love the Focals. I had mixed with other brands over the years, but it was always a bit deceiving. Other monitors seemed somewhat overly polished, bass heavy and even ‘clubby.’ The Focal Twin 6s are so transparent, but still easy to listen to and work with: they really help my mixes translate to anything I play them back on,” states Young.\n\nRead More »"
