        "text": "The facts are somewhat buried below the opinions (of which you will find plenty).\n\nThere is nothing inherent in a VST that makes it sound better or worse than a hardware digital synth/sampler like the Motif. The final quality of the sound that hits the speakers depends on how the VST was designed, the computer you run it on and the audio interface you use.\n\nBeyond that is the skill of the programmer(s) who created the preset patches and your skill in programming your own patches. Typically the presets that come from mfrs who are headed up by sound designers like Spectrasonics (Eric Persing, long time Roland sound designer) or Rob Papen (sound designer for the Virus, amongst others) are very high quality and usable out of the box. Whether you prefer the supplied sounds over those of the Motif is purely a matter of taste.\n\nHaving used a fair number of VSTs alongside Motif ES and XF, I’ll say that it is possible to get software that sounds as good as or better than a Motif. The stuff that sounds best to my ears is expensive and requires a hefty computer to run it. Sample libraries used by professionals for scoring movies can cost more than an XF!\n\nWhat can get lost when discussing hard vs. soft is the user interface. This will vary from instrument to instrument and user to user. One advantage to an instrument like the Motif is that you access all the functions, from simply playing a voice to editing samples and sequences with the same interface. This is almost never the case with software instruments. Few even attempt to “do it all” like the Motif, so that means you will be working with multiple instruments and multiple interfaces.\n\nMy suggestion is to download demos of a few instruments...many can be run standalone if you don’t currently use a DAW...and listen for yourself.\n\nPeterS - 19 July 2012 12:51 PM\n\nAs I do not use VST’s currently I am looking for opinions on the quality of a VST vs a hardware synth like the XF as far as the quality of sound. What are the facts/opinions. Thanks.\n\nI have switched to VSts a while ago and with my expiriense the modern software is just miles more supperior to modern hardware keyboards ( exept those which allow to load VSts in to the keyboard like Music Comuting or Open Labs)\n\nWith VSTs u have\n\n1) a huge selection\n\n2) a lot of tweakeable parameters and very vast editing possibilities\n\n3) in most cases they sound much more realistic and most of the time the sound quality is much more supperior.\n\n4) many respectful software manufactors have trial versions usually fo 30 days of software with 100% functional so u can see by ur self how it works and see if it will suit u well, but not like Yamaha case They have so shiny commercial adds but when actually u buy something u realize u do not like that or many things that was advirtised by Yamaha was not actually true but u cannot return the product nur thy do not have any trial version so people cannot try anything befor they buy\n\nBut Motif XF is just a rompeler which is basically Motif “classic” with a bigger memory which even was not based on state of the art technologies when it was relised ( 2001 year) and it has a tiny Rom and compressed samples and ok effects, u have to be totally blind not to admit that.\n\nP.s. I am pretty shure there might be other interesting choices but I would suggest u to start with NI complete and see how it works. It is an amazing starting package for just supper low price http://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/producer/komplete-8/?type=99.\n\nFor me it’s a inspiration thing. I have used vst’s for a long time and yes they have come a long way\n\nbut then what , for me after a while your just sitting in front of a computer all-day .\n\nThe same computer that’s made to do music and everything else .\n\nTheses pro boards are not computers that just happens to do music they are real instruments with one goal in mind and that’s to help you to achieve yours musically .\n\nTo be honest i’m glad the masses of people are following the trend working on computer because it gives me that edge over them that they will never know about .\n\nPeople use the word Rompler like an insult but it’s not the Motif Xf is more complex and deep than any daw musically with no load times what so ever .\n\nOne of the main things daw people forget about is the control surface and workflow .\n\nWhen you have a board that was made to make music everything begins to fall into place but the key is to truly learn the instrument .\n\nGood luck on what ever way you go .\n\nPeople tend to forget that there aren’t that may VST romplers out there. Spectratronics Omnisphere may be the best one out there but it’s more for sounddesigners/movie scores. The rest out there is plain bad or just meant for a niche group of users.\n\nMotif XF is just a middle of the road rompler with excellent sampled acoustic instruments that can stand against most sample packs and has it weak points with the electronic sounding patches. For that you can either use the renaissance of the modern analog tabletop synths or the odd VA VST.\n\nBut there are a lot of VST’s who are sub par so you’d be picky about anyone you choose. Most of the times when they are sub par is because they are designed by a tech head boasting tons of specs and whatnot instead of a musician. Most decent or excellent VST’s are designed by persons that want to create an expressive instrument that can be used in any setup. Just pick as little as possible VST’s and avoid drowning in a sea of mediocre VST’s that aren’t inspiring to you.\n\nPeterS - 21 July 2012 03:53 PM\n\nDave, thanks for the info but you didn’t answer the original question. I would love to hear your answer based on your expertise.\n\nWell, Dave does not want to lose his job at Yamaha so most likely he will say something like “no comment” but if u want to know what he might say, just look, Dave uses a lot of VSti and other software in most of his recordings work nowadays and Motif XF might be about 5% or less up to 0% used in recordings . so just have a little brain and just try to think what he would say.....\n\nP.s. Obviously he is not a singles bird like that, honestly I never saw Motif XF used in professional recordings at all, in pro studios they use either software or and analog synthesizers\n\nMy 2 cents\n\nPeterS - 21 July 2012 03:53 PM\n\nDave, thanks for the info but you didn’t answer the original question. I would love to hear your answer based on your expertise.\n\nWell, first, I think this thread should be moved to the Mo Lounge because\n\nit’s really not related to specific issues with the Motif XF.\n\nThat said, I use both the XF and softsynths and software samplers in my\n\nmusic production.I use anything and everything I have at my disposal.\n\nFor live gigs the XF is my primary keyboard (I also use my Korg M3, for\n\nmy second keyboard).\n\nFor the David Foster tours, we have moved to XF’s all the way around for\n\nour two keyboard players, Morris Pleasure and Boh Cooper. Each of them uses an XF8 and an XF7.\n\nI don’t know what studios Chilly has visited, but I’ve seen the XF being used plenty in studios here in L.A.\n\nOne last thing - I am not a Yamaha employee."
