Barlow, P.E., Director Cables: INTRESECON Managers of International Commodity Agreements 6210 Massachusetts Avenue Washington, D. C. 20016 November 30th, 1981 Statement for the U.S. Gold Commission: In 1974 I made a speech to the Men's Republican Club of Montgomery County, Maryland. It expressed the views of the International Institute for Resource Economics at that time. I believe it is still relevant. Here it is: \"Since 1971 the dollar has been convertible only into an unspecified quantity of an unknown commodity. Since that date, only fools have chosen to hold dollars rather than goods. This must continue, until the dollar is again convertible into a specific quantity of a known commodity. Which commodity? This decision can be left to the technicians. High unit value and ease of identification are considerations. The decision to close the gold window, rather than to change the price in accordance with the increased cost of production was dictated by idiots. They were concerned with minor advantages that might accrue to the Soviet Union and South Africa. They predicted a price of $6 as the free market price of gold. Most important of all, they ignored the fact that the convertibility of the dollar into gold, as agreed to at Bretton Woods, had become the cornerstone of civilization on this planet. When the International Monetary Fund met to vote on \"Paper Gold\"; I was there. What was I doing? I was giving away rubber yardsticks. On each yardstick, in ten languages, was the warning; \"Never Trust a Politician\"' INFLATION HAS A SIMPLE SOLUTION I ALL THAT IS NEEDED IS A FIRM DETERMINATION TO RESTORE CONVERTIBILITY. My organization deplores the efforts of the enemies of convertibility to complicate this issue. It is brutally simple. There are two kinds of money; HONEST and DISHONEST. History teaches us that honest money has a batting average of 1000; dishonest money a batting average of ZERO. Very truly yours, Wallace D.

The evidence appears to show that h u m a n groups have prospered to the degree that they have attained high levels of development with respect to each of the six independent variables of the ICL theory, namely, large numbers of people, commitment motivation, electrical technologies scientific and democratic methods of codification, high levels of population density and meaningful and stable writing systems including those of numbers and money. These conditions m a k e it possible for the members of h u m a n groups to communicate information m a x i m u m distances in minimum volumes. Conversely, the evidence appears to show that h u m a n groups have suffered hardship to the degree that they have remained at or regressed to low levels of development with respect to each of the six independent variables of the ICL theory, namely, small numbers of people widespread use of coercion, manual technologies, traditional methods of codification, low levels of population density, and a spoken language unsupported by written symbol systems including those of numbers and money. flje Basic Paradigip Amount of Information Successfully Communicated The Scale of Cooperation (Information Chain Length) The explanation for these correlations is to be found in the Basic Paradigm of the ICL Theory. In general, as information is communicated from person to person to person (forming an information chain), there is a tendency for information to become distorted, to undergo entropy. The six independent variables of the ICL theory vary systematically in their effects upon this rate of entropy. Similarly, these six variables affect the volume of information that it is necessary to process through the social system to bring about effective cooperation. High volumes of information create problems of information overload and congestion, making low volumes of information preferable for efficient cooperation. In brief, the ICL Theory states that h u m a n progress depends upon the accurate and efficient communication of information the longest necessary social distances to support the largest scale of cooperation and thus the greatest potential for h u m a n fulfillment and actualization. The Necessary Characteristics of a Monetary Standard by Robert R. Blain, PhD Professor of Sociology Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville Presented to The Gold Commission Washington D. C. November 24, 1981 The Necessary Characteristics of a Monetary Standard by Robert R. Blain, PhD Professor of Sociology Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville Any standard of weight or measure, including money, must possess certain characteristics. It is relatively easy to identify what these characteristics must be because we already have a large number of such standards including standards of length, weight, temperature, barometric pressure, volume, and time. Each of these standards has now been in use for many years and has proven itself in practice to work very well in providing its users with the means to effectively and efficiently, without government intervention, exchange goods involving their use. The only mechanism of economic cooperation and exchange that now fails to work adequately is money, hence the need to compare money to each of the characteristics that any standard must possess. The characteristics that all successful standards possess are the following: 1. They are real. That is, they have an existence outside the minds of their users. None is purely subjective. All are tangible in some way. Length can be seen, weight can be measured on a scale, temperature can be felt and sensed by a thermometer, speed can be observed and measured with a speedometer, atmospheric pressure can be measured with a barometer. Objective existence is a necessary characteristic of any standard because only an objective standard can serve as an arbiter of a dispute between exchange partners. Were a standard of length, for example, only subjective, two people who 2 disagreed over the dimensions of a plot of land could never resolve their disagreement with mutual certainty. 2. All successful standards are stable. The function of a standard is to facilitate the cooperation and coordination of economic activities that take place among persons dispersed over wide geographic regions and over long periods of time. Any standard that itself changed dimensions from place to place or from time to time could not perform this function. The critical importance of stability is implied by the standard for yard as defined in 1854: \"the distance between two lines crossing two gold studs set in a certain bar of platinum kept in London, the measurement being made when the temperature is 62 degrees Farenheit and the barometric pressure is 30 inches\" (Funk and Wagnalls, 1950: 13,060). 3. All successful standards are system-wide. In order for a standard to facilitate the coordination of all parts of an economic system, all persons in the system must have access to that standard. Early measurement systems, such as the Roman,based on the human foot, the hand, or the distance from the nose to the end of the outstretched arm; involved measurement errors because these varied from person to person. Standardization meant establishing one and only one foot, hand, or arm as the standard to be used by everyone in the system. 4. All successful standards are appropriate. A standard must possess the quality that is being measured. A standard of length must have length, a standard of weight must have weight, a standard of temperature must vary with changes in temperature, etc. It would be inappropriate to use a weight as a standard of length, or a weight as a standard of time, etc. 3 Having identified the four characteristics that are in fact possessed by all known successful standards of weight and measure, we can test the validity of using gold as a monetary standard by seeing if gold possesses each and every of these characteristics. When this test is made, we find that gold meets in full only the first characteristic, that of being real. 1. Is gold real? Yes, gold is real. Gold has an observable, tangible existence. People can see it. Indeed, it is the reality of gold that recommends it as a monetary standard. By tying the value of money to a quantity of gold, it is thought that the money supply will be made objectively determinable. 2. Is gold stable? If we consider a particular piece of gold we must say that gold is stable. A piece of gold will remain exactly what it is over generations of time - assuming that it is not purposely altered by man. Gold, of course, deteriorates at the atomic level but at too slow a rate to be relevant to human economic relations. If we consider the total supply of gold, however, we find that its quantity is not stable. As gold is mined,the supply increases. As gold is used for industrial and cosmetic purposes, the supply decreases. Since gold is relatively rare, the rate of change is much slower than the rate for commodities such as wheat and corn. In this sense, gold is more stable than certain other things and a money system based on gold would be only relatively stable. When we consider the value of gold, we find it to be highly variable. The judgment of value tends to be highly subjective, dependent upon the person and the use made of it. Some persons place a high value on gold jewelry while others regard such a use as wasteful. 4 Therefore, we must conclude that gold does not meet the criterion of stability. 3. Is^ gold system-wide? Gold is system-wide only in the sense that everyone has heard of gold. Gold £s not system-wide in the sense that very few people possess any gold, very few people can identify gold and unfailingly distinguish it from pyrite, virtually noone knows how to measure \"karats11 of gold. People could weigh a piece of gold, but an expert would have to certify the metal as gold and would have to assess its purity. 4» .Is gold appropriate? Gold is measured by weight. The function of a monetary standard is to measure price. Is it appropriate to measure the price of a good or service by its weight? If it were, then the heaviest things would have the highest prices and the lightest things would have the lowest prices. Houses would sell for more than diamonds, iron ore would sell for more than precision surgical instruments, and all services - having no weight at all - would be free. Gold, clearly, fails to meet the test of appropriateness. Therefore, when gold is judged by the characteristics possessed by all successful standards of weight and measure it fails to meet three out of four. Gold is real but it is not stable, it is not system-wide, and it is not appropriate. Given this almost total failure of gold to measure up to the characteristics needed by a monetary standard, we might pause to ask Why has gold been so prominent as a candidate for a monetary standard? The answer lies in the history of the evolution of money. 5 Since the members of the Gold Commission are undoubtedly familiar with the evolution of money, I will not bore you with a lot of detail. In capsule form, the evolution of money progressed through the following stages: 1. Barter - goods and services directly exchanged. 2. Favorite commodity systems - where a third commodity mediated exchange. The commodities that emerged as favorites were mainly copper, silver, and gold. These metals did not rust, hence were goods \"stores of value\", they could be moved from place to place, and they could be added to or subtracted from so that items of unequal value could be exchanged. 3. Paper receipt systems - the commodity money was held in a safe place and paper receipts circulated in their stead. In this way, the paper came to be thought of as standing for the silver or gold \"on reserve.\" 4. Fractional reserve systems - loans were made based on money on deposit so that the total money supply was expanded beyond the amount on deposit. Gradually the reserves ceased to be in gold or silver and we advanced to completely paper money systems, the situation we are in at present. Why, then, is gold popular as a candidate for the monetary standard? Because in the past it served as such a standard and, in the context of primitive money systems, it worked tolerably better than anything else. However, does this mean that we should go back to gold? The question is somewhat like asking Should we go back to favorite commodity systems or back to barter? Should we turn back the clock of monetary evolution? The supply of gold in 6 the world and particularly the distribution of that gold among the countries of the world does not correspond with the supply and distribution of economic activities in the world. Therefore, to tie the money supply to the gold supply would contort, confound, and confuse economic relationships. What we need is not to go back to gold; what we need is to go forward to yet another stage in the evolution of money. What we need is to find something that meets the four conditions that must be met by a monetary standard, something real, stable, universal, and common to all occupations and goods and services worldwide. Such a thing does exist. Unfortunately, the contortions that an unstandardized monetary system has already created will make the adoption of that \"thing\" difficult. Nonetheless, I believe it is the duty of our generation to face the truth as clearly and as squarely as our minds permit. We admire our forefathers for the special courage they manifested in fighting for our political independence; let them serve as models for us as we face the economic challenge of our time - identifying and adopting a monetary standard that logic and the facts impose upon us. The \"thing\" that meets all four necessary characteristics of a monetary standard is time. 1. Is time real? Yes, time is real. Time is based on the rotation of the earth (hours and days) and the orbit of the earth around the sun (days, weeks, and years). The reality of time is not in the same form, for example, as the reality of a weight. The reality of time is more akin to the reality of speed. Time is measured by movement. We sense time by the rising and setting of the sun and by the change of the seasons. The modern understanding of time is relatively new, being at least post-Copernicus• 7 2# ll time stable? Time is as stable as the rotation of the earth on its axis and the orbit of the earth around the sun. As far as human economic activities are concerned, time is probably the most stable thing of all. Indeed, we measure the deterioration of atoms by time - their half-lives. Time is clearly more stable than gold. 3. Ijs time system-wide? Time is worldwide. All peoples all over the world keep time records. And the 24 hour day is universal. Clocks can be found in all but the most primitive cultures and even the latter have some form of clocks. 4» Ijs time appropriate as a monetary standard? There is a great deal of evidence that time is appropriate. The first body of evidence consists of all the ways we presently use time to organize and regulate our economic activities. We define the length of the working day in hours; we define the length of the work week in days; we define the length of the work year in weeks; we define the work career in years. We govern entry into the labor force by age; we govern exit from the work force by age. Apartment rent is charged by the month; interest is charged by the month and year; taxes come due annually. Depreciation allowances are defined by time; education is organized by age and years; economic planning is often done in man-hours. People are paid by the hour, by the week, by the month, and by the year. Seniority is a matter of time. Ironically, we measure inflation with time! If time were not appropriate as a standard for organizing economic activities, it would be difficult to explain its universal use. Another kind of evidence for the appropriateness of time 8 as a monetary standard is people who have proposed its use as such. These include Benjamin Franklin who proposed in 1729 that time-in-production be used to set prices; the residents of New Harmony, Indiana who used time to set prices in their store; Josiah Warren of Ohio who proposed the use of time for prices in the nineteenth century; and the frequent use of man-hours by the government to compare the real cost of commodities over time. Another kind of evidence for the Use of time as a monetary standard is the universal language habit of linking time and money. In their daily conversations, in advertisements, and in public declarations, we constantly hear the phrases \"spending time and spending money,\" \"saving time and saving money,\" \"investing time and investing money.\" The constant association of time and money suggests that the two have a great deal in common. Both time and money have a powerful disciplining effect on human activity. Therefore, we have identified the four characteristics that all successful standards have in common and we have found that, where gold fails to meet these conditions, time meets them all. How might time be instituted as the monetary standard? There is a relatively simple and reasonable method for adopting time as the monetary standard; namely, to divide the Gross National Product by the total number of hours worked by the labor force to produce that GNP. Since the GNP is in dollars and work time is in hours, the division would yield dollars per hour, the ratio for defining dollars in units of time. 9 For 1980, the calculation would have been as follows. The 1980 Gross National Product for the United States was $2,626 billion. The labor force in 1980 numbered 97.3 million persons. I do not know how many hours the labor force worked, so an assumption is introduced here to complete the illustration. Let us assume that everyone in the labor force worked 40\\aweek for 50 weeks, probably an overestimate, but useful for the present purpose. By that assumption the labor force worked 97.3m(40 X 50) . 97.3m(2000) = 194.66 billion hours. Gross National Product $2,626 b „,0 /n Total Hours Worked * 194.66 b \" $13 *49 per hour - This equation defines the ratio of dollars to hours by which the present dollars could be replaced by new Hour Dollars and the entire economy placed on the Time Standard. The conversion equation has the advantage of being applicable to any nation in the world and of being adoptable at any time. Such a conversion could place international monetary relations on a stable and rational basis. International comparisons would reveal cases of price inequities and prevent such price abuses as the price increases of the OPEC cartel as the understanding spread that prices should reflect the time required to produce goods and services. Money on the time standard would greatly simplify economic theory and economic practice. The setting of prices would become a matter of simple adminstrative routine. Inflation would be ended, for price increases would imply that more time is required for production, a dubious assumption in most cases. Perhaps the greatest benefit of money on the time standard would be its effect on the relationship between government and the market. Today we 10 see an unprecedented involvement of government in economic affairs. This involvement has been made necessary by the economic chaos caused by money that has no real, stable, universal, and appropriate standard. In the absence of a monetary standard, the setting of prices has been a matter of trial and error, inflation has continued for generations, and economic planning for all units of the economy has had perverse and unpredictable results. The market cannot work with a money system that leaves everyone to guess what a dollar is worth. The free market can be free and work only where each person in the system has a known and reasonable yardstick for deciding how much to charge and how to pay for particular goods and services. The question that naturally arises when the proposal to go on the time standard is made is Will everyone be paid the same amount of money per hour? Would, for example, everyone be paid the equivalent of $13.49 per hour? Note, first of all, that a wage rate of $13.49 per hour, if received by everyone, would be a good living. At such a rate a large part of our taxes would already be paid. Such a rate provides for the payment of all government employees (they are included in the labor force), all public and private school teachers, police and firemen, etc. - everyone in the labor force would be paid. The only taxes that would be necessary would be transfer payments to support children, the disabled, and the retired. Each worker would need to support him or herself plus 1 and 1/3 other people. We produced enough in the United States in 1980 to provide an income of $11,619 per person in the society. (I am ignoring capital depreciation allowances partly because it is difficult to assess their accuracy - but if included they would not significan reduce the per capita figure.) 11 The second point to be noted with respect to the question Will everyone be paid the same amount of money per hour? is this. The adoption of the time standard does not change anyone's income. It leaves the distribution of money unchanged. The only immediate effect is to give the money numbers a meaning that they presently lack. The people making a million dollars a year would continue to make the same amount of money relative to everyone else. The only change would be that the income would be expressed in hours and years. If $13.49 equals one hour, a year is equal to 2000 times $13.49 or $26,980. One year equals $26,980. A million dollars, then, equals $1.000,000 -7 $26,980 37 years. The millionnaire's income would be expressed as 37 years. The benefits of money on the time standard would begin to occur as people throughout the economy gained a new and real understanding of how much money they were receiving. They could then make their economic decisions accordingly. The millionnaire, for example, might decide to retire after a few years, having earned enough to last more than a lifetime. The adoption of the time standard is meant to make the free market work; it is not meant to replace that market. Today the market is in chaos; the time standard would straighten it out through voluntary and gradual adjustments. What is the alternative? Socialism is on the rise in the world because capitalism appears to be destroying itself. Free market cooperation can be saved only by adopting a rational yardstick of economic price. Gold fails to meet the necessary criteria; time meets all of them. Cur intuition tells us repeatedly that time and money go together. Is it not interesting that the solution to inflation may be just a matter of time? November 24, 1981 THE UNIQUE AMERICAN PATH by Conrad Jules Braun The following testimony was presented to the U.S. Cold Commission which held its public hearings on November 12 and 13, 1981. I am from Kansas. And in Kansas there are some wide open spaces and a favorite sport is sky-diving. It's supposed to be safe, at least that is what one of m y sky-diving friends told m e until that fateful day he' stepped out of an airplane and pulled his ripcord and nothing happened. Nothing happened! Fortunately, he knew what to do next. H e cut away the main chute and pulled the emergency chute. Again, nothing happened! N o w m y friend was becoming a little concerned as he plummeted towards earth, w h e n he spied a gentleman w h o was coming up from the opposite direction! Not knowing what to do in his predicament and nearly completely beside himself my friend asked this gentleman, \" D o you know anything about sky-diving?\" The gentleman replied, \" N o ! D o you know anything about Coleman stoves?\" Gentlemen, Mr. Chairman, M e m b e r s of Congress, Distinguished Commissioners this is the predicament our nation faces today. W e are at a brink of a precipice and don't k n o w which way to jump. As noble laureate F. A. Hayek puts it w e can no longer afford a system that subjects the entire nation to the recurring bouts of acute inflation and deflation that have become accentuated during the past 60 years. To paraphrase Lewis Lehrman, Socialists, Communists, and Monetarists — m e n of all persuasion — have n o w agreed that the end of this predicament is at least an important, if not the preeminent goal that w e all affirm. The Members of this Commission and the nation as a whole agree on the problem. W e disagree only on the solution. S o m e members of this Commission have attributed great importance to the precise amount that the federal government should expand the money supply, others point to the level of the federal deficit, still others refer to a role of gold in the nation's purchasing media and still others point to the importance that gold play no role in m o n e y at all. S o m e have even presented a combination of these ideas and ideas that I have not mentioned here. Clearly it is evident that no two Members of this Commission can agree on what role gold should or should not play in the monetary realm. As Shakespeare put it, \"There seems m u c h ado about nothing.\" The Members of this Commission and the American public perceives that something is fundamentally wrong with our economy, yet no two citizens can agree on just what path this nation should embark. Gentlemen, I submit that y o u — the Members of this Commission — are truly representative of our Republic and I want to take this m o m e n t to c o m m e n d all of you for your diligence and thoroughness in this monumental task. I only pray that our predicament is not so bad as that of our friends w h o met in mid-air or this historical event will wither into an academic footnote. Are you familiar with the \"little crackpot in the basement\" theory of the future? In a nutshell the theory works like this: Forget the \"great m e n \" of our time — the statesmen, the presidents, generals, and kings. Instead watch for \"the little crackpot in the basement\" — the unknown, unheralded, hitherto \"loser\", w h o will suddenly pull a rabbit out of the hat and change the world. A mediocre civil servant n a m e d Einstein altered our concept of the universe. A down-atthe-heels handyman n a m e d Edison changed the w a y w e live our daily lives. A pair of dropout brothers gave up repairing bicycles and gave mankind wings to fly. Then there was Henry Heinz, Clarence Birdseye, Gail Borden, Eli Whitney, Henry Ford — w e could go on and on. It is no mere coincidence that the tremendous advances during the past two hundred years evolved in the Western World instead of India, Africa, or South America. And the environment which m a d e such spontaneous advances possible did not aJways exist. Only two hundred years before Edison, Galileo was considered a heretic and countless thousands of other dissidents were regularly burned at the stake. M y purpose is not to review the great history of American Freedom. Although I love to tell the story I a m sure you equally appreciate our unique heritage. M y point is that while historical evidence suggests that \"the little crackpot in the basement\" theory works, it can do so only in the context of a free society. Throughout our history freedom has been this nation's saving grace. Freedom unleashes America's most powerful and reliable force that has always worked in a tight spot — good old American know-how. The issue is not a gold standard. The issue is freedom. If gold is indeed a better monetary unit then w e must not be afraid to subject it to the test of the marketplace. It must emerge by its o w n merits. The obstacles w e face are two-fold. T h e first obstacle is the superstition that m o n e y is a function of government. This superstition is similar in nature to the concept of the divine right of kings held centuries ago. The second obstacle is a very powerful bank- ing establishment w h o will not willingly relinquish its special privileged monopoly to citizens. ' The First Principle of America is individual rights and freedom of choice. This is the essence of a free market e c o n o m y and a free society. Freedom of h u m a n will is the basic principle of our religion — G o d put m a n on earth to choose G o o d over Evil. Yet in a real sense anyone who wishes to express monetary ideas in a unit other than dollars is a modern-day American dissident. To illustrate m y point I have reprinted an advertisement that appeared in the January 25, 1963 issue of LIFE magazine (see page 3). I am certain m a n y of you on this Commission rem e m b e r this series of advertisements. I was 13 years old at the time and remember vividly how enthralled I was that such a program could exist. In 1963 you could \"relax in Florida without financial worry\" o n $300 per month. But today $300 will not even pay the rent. Please don't misunderstand m e . I a m not faulting the insurance company. I have chosen this advertisement for illustration purposes only. There is no reason to doubt that the insurance company is living up to its fiduciary obligation and is paying a $300 per month benefit. Rather it is our government m o n e y managers that have failed in their fiduciary obligations. The dollar promises m a d e in 1963 are not the same promises received in 1981. N o w let us examine the results had this insurance program been denominated in gold. At that time gold was $35 per ounce making the monthly benefit approximately 8.5 ounces of gold. Today 8.5 ounces of gold is about $3,000 per month — enough to assure the very comfortable retirement promised in 1963. The problem is that this couple did not have the freedom to choose between a dollar based or gold based insurance program. And we still d o not have this freedom of choice today. This lack of choice leads us to ask if it is wise for a nation to allow itself to be at the mercy of monopolistic m o n e y managers? Is it not prudent ,- to have alternatives that could prevent an entire nation from falling victim to such monetary disasters caused by s o m e bureaucratic miscalculation? In no other area is it considered prudent to put all your eggs in one basket, yet this is exactly what w e d o with money. Earlier I suggested that in a real sense anyone w h o wishes to express monetary ideas in a unit other than paper dollars is a modern-day American dissident. The legalization of gold ownership in 1975 corrected this situation to s o m e degree in that a primitive 100 percent gold standard has been free to evolve in competition with the paper dollar model. But while gold bullion storage, gold certificates, and gold coins have blossomed during the past five years, this success can not be attributed to the merit of a 100 percent gold standard but rather is due to an increasing failure of the paper dollar model. Under present conditions the best reform that can be achieved is limited to the better of the two competing models and any improvements are limited to the w h i m s of our m o n e y managers. While such a choice is better than no choice a constellation of gold based money, credit, banking, and financial services must be allowed to emerge in order to facilitate the flood of products to be marketed in a modern industrial society. Gold based insurance, sound commercial gold banking, gold based savings and loans, and other gold based financial arrangements are not allowed to emerge because by law all reserves for such services must be held in dollars. The legalization of gold ownership without the freedom to develop its use in the infinite array of financial matters is m u c h like the Catch-22 predicament of a Russian dissident w h o is granted an emigration pass to exit but then is arrested for not having a pass for domestic travel. Today, w e are the most technologically advanced civilization in the history of mankind, yet our money is based on superstition from the middle ages. W e must begin to ask — what undreamed of discoveries lie ahead in the event of a 20th Century Free M o n e y Movement? Imagine for a m o m e n t a midwestern farmer with the freedom to choose between a gold standard, silver standard, wholesale commodities, or various other m o n e y and credit alternatives that could develop in the years ahead. By prudent diversification it would be possible to spread monetary risks a m o n g several managers. Already multinational corporations and large investors do this with national currencies issued by central banks. But unfortunately, the global monopoly of m o n e y has relieved the need for governments to keep expenditures within revenues and this has precipitated spectacular Wond'i.*! wl»at w o u k l I. <l'|\" '•»\" I •• ' ii I died Hist I w o n m l -.1 — »•*« !<>• '1 - \"How we retired In 15 years with 9300 a month WIM-I.

As a result international diversification is presently limited to the \"lessor\" of the evils and is akin to climbing the b o w of a sinking ship. In addition, actual use of the various national currencies is limited to within the boundaries of the host countries. Eliminating government monopolies would greatly reduce barriers between international boundaries, thereby facilitating trade by reducing m a n y costly middleman operations and foreign exchange risks. The midwestern farmer will have a unit of trade c o m m o n with the consumer in Europe. Heretofore undreamed of avenues of international trade could flourish. I submit that there is a uniquely American path, a path above petty squabbles over the correct monetary/fiscal/gold \"mix\" of government policy. Here is the neglected path of a genuine free market in gold. With freedom of choice w e can begin to transform economics from a priesthood to a science in that m o n e y managers will n o longer be selected by their ability to align themselves with politicians, but will be selected by their perform a n c e in the marketplace. W e are all too familiar with the alternative. The chance of politicians to pass a workable formula is very slim and the possibility bureaucrats could carry it out is nil. This alternative is not only unscientific but contrary to our heritage. President Reagan has let it be k n o w n that the restoration of gold deserves consideration. The Administration is interested in n e w options. At the same time the Administration recognizes that gold is not a panacea and w e have to earn our way back to gold. Freedom of choice provides the avenue for the American people to do just that! For centuries mankind held the belief that the world was flat and if one strayed too far from port he would sail into a vast abyss. This was reinforced w h e n reckless m e n strayed too far and were never seen again. Yet Christopher Columbus secured provisions, used the wisdom of ages for his navigation, and set sail to discover a N e w World. W e must n o w develop the vision, courage, wisdom and strength to again set sail on this unique American path. W h a t undreamed of discoveries lie ahead? I do not claim the wisdom to know. But it is only with freedom that w e are allowed to find out. Conrad J. Braun is president of Gold Standard Corporation and editor of Gold Standard News. Gold Standard Corporation was organized in 1976 shortly after the legalization of gold ownership and originally offered a g bullion storage service. In 1978, GSC, at the request of its depositors, began minting gold coins and introduce concept of a decimilized troy ounce unit of weight The concept was so successful that the South African government dropped its Baby-Rand program and adopted a similar format subsidizing domestic dealers to the tune of over $20 million to launch the idea. The coins produced by GSC include the Harwood Gold, Silver and Platinum Ounce bearing the inscription, SOUND COMMERICAL BANKING, the Hayek Gold and Silver Half Ounce bearing the inscription, DENATIONALIZATION OF MONEY, the Hazlitt Gold and Silver Quarter bearing the inscription FREE CHOICE OF CURRENCIES, the Adam Smith TENPIECE bearing the inscription, WEALTH OF NATIONS and the Deak FIVEPIECE bearing the inscription, INTERNATIONALIZATION OF SOUND MONEY. Today Gold Standard Corporation is the largest private mint in the United States with over 500,000 coins in circulatio RESCUING AMERICA from FALSE MONEY CONCEPTS and FALSE ECONOMIC CONCEPTS which are producing SOCIAL UNREST, VIOLENCE AND CRIME instead of SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC HEALTH by GEORGE L. BROWNING 14329 Chandler Blvd. Van Nuys, CA 91401 October 15, 1981 AMERICA'S SICKNESS IS CURABLE The United States of America is a very sick nation. She is socially sick. She is economically sick. In America almost eight million citizens who are able and willing to work are unemployed and cannot find jobs. This is true even though this nation has neglected and undone work projects which could beneficially use the labors of additional workers double the number of the unemployed. Unemployment, maldistribution of wealth and a lack of youth training are the rewards available for moral conduct — these are dangerously stimulating the growth of social unrest, rebellion against authority, violence and crime. The former security protecting our families and properties is rapidly diminishing. Until two decades ago, the American dollar was the king of all international monies. The dollar's ability to provide a dependable measuring stick for value, a safe storage house for funds or an acceptable worldwide medium of exchange was unquest. oned. Today, in every way, the dollar is becoming more debased. It is losing value hourly. Just a few years ago the United States was the major monetary gold holder of the World. Over half of the monetary gold recently held has been lost to other nations. America, until the last few years, was the most powerful creditor nation in the World. Today this nation is not producing and exporting enough goods and services -2to pay for needed imports. Soon, America may be the largest debtor nation in the World. In recent years the heads of our government have been preaching to the World the need for the protection of human rights. At the same time our government was engaging in practices which were robbing tens of millions of American citizens of \"THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS TO ECONOMIC SECURITY.\" These citizens who have been robbed, believed words coming out of Washington which stated that inflation was being brought under control; that the dollar was sound, and that government and other bonds and savings accounts were safe and profitable investments. Believing these unjustified statements, tens of millions of American citizens placed their earnings and accumulated wealth in fixeddollar-value investments. These investments now amount to over three thousand billion dollars ($3,000,000,000,000.00). These fixed-dollar-value investments exist in the forms of currency, bank and savings deposits, government and other bonds, insurance policy equities, annuities, trusts, mortgages and other evidences of debt. These investments have no value, whatsoever, above whatever purchasing power the dollars received may have when the investments are converted into spending money and the money is spent. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System provides us with statistics which clearly show that if all dollars having claims on the material wealth (goods and services) in the nation immediately exercised those claims, it would be impossible for -3each dollar to have a purchasing power greater than the purchasing power now possessed by one or two dimes. These statistics reveal the facts that in 1933 the United States had in its money supply only $42.0 billion; that at the end of last year, 1980, that money supply had been inflated to $2,377.4 billion. This is a sum of dollars five thousand five hundred percent (5,500%) greater than the total dollars America possessed in 1933. Any quantity of dollars, exercising their claims on wealth, can never purchase more than the total quantity of wealth available for purchase. Since 1933, America's quantity of material wealth has been increased nearly 100 percent, but no more. The population has almost, but not quite, doubled. So has the quantity of consumable wealth. While acreage of land has not been increased, the physical quantity of structures and improvements on the land probably has been increased 100 percent. In sum total, there is no more than a 100% increase in physical quantity of material wealth to give value to a 5,500 percent increase in the quantity of dollars which has claims on that wealth. The question arises: How then, has the dollar, up to this time, been able to retain so much purchasing power? The answer is simple. No money can bring about employment or production of wealth until it circulates. No dollars can cause price inflation until they circulate, until they make demands on material wealth. The Fed reports that at the end of 1980, out of the $2,377.4 billion in the nation's money supply, only $415.6 billion was fully active. These were in the forms of currency and demand deposits. The report -4shows $1,916.8 billion rested in the forms of savings or time deposits. It is shown that demand deposits had an annual average turnover during 1980 of 201.6 times per year, while savings deposits turned over, on the average, only 4.2 times per year. Eighteen percent of the dollars are largely responsible for present price inflation. The history of money quantity inflation in other countries discloses the fact that when the general public becomes aware of the fact that their money is doomed to ultimate death, all money goes into the spending field, circulating rapidly. The money is not consumed, but the spending reduces the relative quantity of material wealth available to give value to money. As a result, price inflation is higher and higher. In 1923 I was in Germany studying the effects of money quantity inflation and price inflation. I was sponsored in my studies by the then Secretary of State, Charles Evan Hughes, Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew W. Mellon, and by Senator Robert L. Owen, the real father of the Federal Reserve System. Their documents, which I carried, opened doors to me which otherwise would have been closed. A personal experience of mine will illustrate what happens to the value of money which has been over-inflated. In Germany I gave a dinner party for five. bottles of good wine. We had three I was liberal with my tips. The overall cost to me was over one hundred thousand German marks (about $20,000.00 had the marks been purchased in pre-inflation days). The people furnishing the dinner evaluated the mark by past -5purchasing power, just as American citizens are now evaluating the dollar. I bought my marks on the morning of the dinner on the international money market. There the mark was being evaluated by its prospects just ahead. For the over one hundred thousand marks, which paid for a dinner for five, I paid only ninety-eight American pennies. The dinner for five, and all the trimmings, cost me less than one American dollar. A few weeks after the dinner, the then German mark was put to death and a new money system was brought into existence. It was my privilege to study with the great German economist, Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, the man who largely designed the new money system which enabled Germany to recover and to gain a position of economic eminence. America's sickness; the destruction of the integrity of the dollar money system; the waste of the nation's manpower and material resources through unemployment; the promotion of social unrest, violence and crime — these things are 'not due to any evil intent or wicked design on the part of any leader in government or in business. The sickness is entirely due to two false concepts. These false concepts invaded, captured and dominated the minds of America's economic managers during the past few decades - especially during the past two decades. The first false concept attributes to money quantity powers which money quantity does not possess. This false money concept fails to recognize the laws which determine what is required to constitute good money. It is blind to the laws which control the proper uses of money in the economies of nations. -6The second false concept dangerously distorts the commands of the United States Constitution regarding what powers and responsibilities are allotted to the Government and what powers and responsibilities are allotted to the private sector of the economy. This false economic concept permits the Government to escape carrying out responsibilities placed on the Government by the Constitution. Free Private Enterprise is expected to perform those duties, even though the terms of the Constitution makes it impossible for private enterprise to do so, legally. Later it will be shown why the Government is responsible for full employment; for maximum production of wealth, and for an equitable distribution of what is produced. It will be demonstrated what the Government must do to induce private enterprise to do its part. It will be detailed how full employment, maximum production, and economic health for all citizens can be achieved without economic cost to the nation. That economic health can be achieved with enormous gains for the government and for all citizens. But first, the money situation must be examined. Money, per se, is not wealth. Money, per se, cannot create wealth. That which is used as money may have, or may not have, a commodity value. Gold and silver coins have a commodity value. Paper currency and bank checks have no commodity value. Money is merely a mental thing. Money is based on faith — faith that the next fellow will accept that which is proffered as money in exchange for his goods or services. In the absence of that faith, not even gold would serve as good money. -7Money's power for good or evil exists in its circulation. Aristotle, thousands of years ago, said \"MONEY HOARDED AND NOT CIRCULATED IS STERILE AND NON-PRODUCTIVE\". One trillion billion dollars locked up in a vault or in a time or savings deposit, without circulation, could not cause employment, wealth production or wealth distribution. When money is circulated in the home economy, (not exported to a foreign economy), that circulation, that spending, consumes no money. No money is wasted and the money supply of the nation is not reduced one iota. This is true whether the purpose of the spending is constructive or destructive. Bad spending may waste precious manpower and material resources; it may impoverish the nation in material wealth, but it does not waste money. When politicians state otherwise, they are evidencing money use ignorance. Money will not circulate without some force to propel it. When the Government fills large reservoirs with money, and then provides no means to force that money to flow into the dry, undernourished parts of the economy they are demonstrating an intelli- gence on par with Farmer Retardo's intelligence. Retardo filled large reservoirs with water but did not provide any irrigation ditches or overhead sprinkling system to carry the water to those spots where the water was needed to give life. During the past few decades the Government and the economic managers of the United States have ignored the fundamental laws of money and money uses. They have resorted to money quantity -8inflation. They have foolishly, unthinkingly, trusted the newly created dollars to find their own way to the undernourished and starved parts of the economy. A brief review of the money quantity history of this nation shows different money concepts among national leaders. Hamilton, Washington, Adams, and others, strongly believed that sound money and good credit were imperative if the nation was to successfully develop. They prevailed over Jefferson, Madison. Gallatin and others who believed that larger and larger quantities of money, freely issued by banks, would best serve to propel the new nation forward. Holding to a sound money program, this commonwealth was quickly elevated from thirteen impoverished colonies to the position of the most powerful and wealthiest nation in the World. In 1913, when Senator Owen and Congressman Carter Glass, with great wisdom and understanding of money's nature^ led the fight which brought the Federal Reserve Banking System into existence — then the total money supply of the nation was only about $19.0 billion. supply. The nation's wealth and commerce had outgrown the money More money was needed. The Federal Reserve Act provided excellent means for the manufacturing of new credit dollars, and each of those dollars was marvelously well protected in value by the discipline of gold reserves. By 1929 America's money quantity had expanded to $55.7 billion. The rapid expansion in credit dollars had consumed that monetary gold in the nation which was available for reserves to back further -9dollar quantity expansion. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve could have acted to stabilize the nation's money quantity at the then level and to stimulate the circulation of money. Instead the Board determined and acted to deflate the nation's money supply. This they did. In four short years the nation's money supply was deflated approximately twenty-five percent - from $55.7 billion in 1929 to $42.0 billion in 1933. This money deflation brought on the panic and stock market crash of 1929. By 1933 the loss of confidence in the economy's future brought about a condition of money hoarding. of the money still existing was cut about half. Circulation This money defla- tion was the direct cause of the Great Depression of the 1930's. In 1933 Franklin Roosevelt became President, promising to rescue America from its punishing depression. economic physicians were called in for advice. The World's greatest The great economist, Lord Keynes of England, and others, pointed out to President Roosevelt that the depression had been caused by money quantity deflation and by the slowing down of the circulation of the remaining money. They advised the use of a strong economic stimu- lant in the forms of new money and forced money circulation. Roosevelt took the advice and did rescue the United States from the depression. One tragic failure was made by President Roosevelt and his advisors. They failed to warn oncoming generations that the money quantity inflation, which they had used to stimulate the depressed economy, was a dangerous, narcotic, addictive drug. That drug, -10if long used, could do more harm than could be done by the sickness. It is astounding to see to what extent present day economic managers have accepted the dangerous drug as a nourishing and beneficial food. After Roosevelt, the money inflation drug was continued in use, but for years not to the extent it has been fed to the American people during the past two decades. Following statistics reveal to what extent the United States increased its addiction during each presidential term, beginning with Roosevelt and ending with Carter. The average annual dollar quantity increase during each presidential term in office was: Roosevelt, $9.7 billion per year; Truman, $11.1 billion per year; Eisenhower, $12.3 billion per year; Kennedy, $23.2 billion per year; Johnson, $34.4 billion per year; Nixon, $95.2 billion per year; Ford, $75.9 billion per year; Carter (HOLD YOUR HAT), $212.5 billion per year. During the past four years, on the average, the United States has increased its money supply, through the use of credit paper, almost as many dollars each month as the total quantity of dollars possessed by America in 1913 when the Federal Reserve System was created. It now takes only a little over two months for this nation, through the use of credit paper, to add to its money supply as many dollars as this nation created and accumulated through the efficient use of manpower and material resources in 137 years. On June 12, 1965, Congress passed a law which cut the last cords which tied the American dollar deposit money to the -11restraining hitching post of gold reserves. Then on March 18, 1968, Congress cut the cords which tied the dollar bank note currency to the gold discipline. These Congressional acts freed the dollar xo-run wild toward that suicidal cliff over which the overinflated German mark went to death in 1923; over which the overinflated French Assignat went to its death in the early years of the last century, and over which so many other overinflated currencies have found death. No money system securely tied to gold through adequate gold reserve requirements has ever lost its virtue or value. value in money systems is purely psychological. Gold's As previously pointed out, money is merely a mental thing, based on faith in its continued purchasing power. While gold is a beautiful and enduring metal, much desired throughout thousands of years, its great monetary strength lies in the fact that the production of gold has never far exceeded the production of material wealth in physical quantity. There is no need for gold to circulate in private hands in the form of money. function. As reserves, gold fully performs its monetary All monetary gold should be retained in the hands of the government or governmental agencies and used for reserve purposes or for international trade purposes. The first great American leader to show hostility to the gold discipline in money affairs was William Jennings Bryan. remembered will be the firey speech in which he said: NOT CRUCIFY MANKIND ON A CROSS OF GOLD\". Long \"THOU SHALL -12Compared to some of today's leaders, Bryan's gold hostility was very mild. He only wanted free coinage of silver on a basis of sixteen ounces of silver to one ounce of gold. Had his plan been adopted, the nation's money supply would not have been increased over ten or fifteen percent; certainly not the five thousand five hundred percent brought on by our present-day gold haters. In money affairs the Board of Governors of the-^ederal Reserve System is as powerful in the United States as the Supreme Court is powerful in the legal field. In my opinion two Chairmen of that Board have done more to destroy the integrity of the American Dollar and to bring chaos to the social and economic life of this nation than has been done by any other two men. The damage is the end product of their gold discipline hostility and hatred. Both of these men have established a reputation for personal integrity and devotion to the nation's good, as they see it. They are rightfully recognized as belonging in the top echelon of national patriots. However, I do assert that their words and actions evidence a serious false concept of gold's power and benefits when that gold is used as a discipline, restraining credit money from engaging in runaway inflation. The first economist and the former Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is the Honorable William MoChesney Martin. Mr. Martin headed the Federal Reserve for many years. -13Chairman Martin's hostility toward the discipline of gold in money matters, and his faith in large quantities of money to provide economic health in a nation, are amply demonstrated in one of his speeches. I shall quote from that speech. Chairman Martin addressed the Financial Council of the National Industrial Conference Board on February 14, 1968 at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City. Two quotes from that address are here given. The first quote: \"I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE CYNICAL AND DESPERATE VIEW THAT MAN MUST TURN BACK TO GREATER DEPENDENCE ON GOLD.\" The second quote: \"I HAVE BEEN QUOTED AS SAYING THAT GOLD IS A BARBAROUS METAL. BUT IT IS NOT GOLD THAT IS BARBAROUS: THAT WASN'T MY POINT. QUITE THE CONTRARY, GOLD IS A BEAUTIFUL AND NOBLE METAL. WHAT IS BARBAROUS, WHEN IT OCCURS, IS MAN'S ENSLAVEMENT TO GOLD FOR MONETARY PURPOSES\". Chairman Martin's power and great influence is revealed by the act of the United States Congress just one month after the date of Mr. Martin's address. On March 18, 1968, the Congress passed a law cutting the final cords which tied the American Dollar to the discipline of gold. The gold discipline no longer can restrain the manufacturing of dollars out of credit papers. The only restraints left are the whims of politicians and money managers in power. The public still believes that dollars represent economic wealth. People constantly seek more dollars. Politicians want to stay in office. More dollars are suj=*plied to voters. -14The Honorable Paul A. Volcker, the present Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, seems to be even more hostile toward the discipline of gold in money matters than the hostility displayed by Chairman Martin. Chairman Volcker today, and since he has been in office, has turned to \"HIGH INTEREST RATES\" as a disciplinary force to combat both money quantity inflation and price inflation. High interest rates have been as effective in putting out the fires of inflation as gasoline poured on a burning fire would be effective in putting out the flames. During last year, 1980, interest rates averaged higher than during any other year in America's history. Last year $227.3 billion new dollars were manufactured out of credit paper and further inflated the nation's already over-inflated prices and money quantity. What did high interest rates accomplish? High interest rates prevented the building of homes which otherwise would have been built. High interest rates prevented the buying of much needed homes. Manufacturing plans were unable to expand. Wealth production was far below normal. Thousands of employees lost their jobs. Unemployment increased welfare costs. Social unrest, violence, crime and money quantity were the only things to be increased. I ask you; which is better, to have our money quantity to be enslaved and kept in bounds by the discipline of gold or to be left free to devour the economic security of all of those who have trusted dollar investments to protect their economic security? -15Three things are required to return the United States of America to a condition of good social and economic health and to the road of ascendancy. First: Second: A new money system of high integrity must be created. Further dollar quantity inflation must be brought to an immediate end. The present dollar must be assured a continued life ranging from twenty to thirty years. This is to provide present fixed-dollar-value investors some opportunities to escape that loss which would be theirs if the dollar's life was brought to an end now. Third: The nation's present economic machinery which was designed for a simple agricultural economy must be restructured and perfected to where it can carry the load of the most complex, congested, rapidly moving industrial economy known to the mind of man. Each of these objectives can be achieved by this nation without any cost to the national economy. It can be done in a manner to gain enormous economic and social benefits. The following pro- posals tell how this can be done. It is proposed that the Congress of the United States, by proper legislation create a new money system along the following lines. The standard unit of money of the new system shall be called \"GOLDER\". One hundred Golders shall have a value equal to one ounce of fine gold. Gold reserves against golder notes and golder deposits shall be the same as that required for dollar notes and dollar deposits prior to the Act of Congress of March 3, 1965. This a«t changed gold reserve requirements against dollars. -16Each Federal Reserve Bank and all banks and financial institutions in the United States handling deposit accounts shall be required to comply with reserve requirements. accounts and dollar accounts. They shall carry both golder For many years this nation has comingled gold coins and silver coins without difficulty. The same can be done with golder money and dollar money. For the Government to attempt to give the dollar a fixed value in gold or in golders would be an exercise in economic futility. The enormous disparity between present dollar quantity and gold quantity and purchasable wealth quantity would doom that attempt to failure. The dollar's value in golders must be established in the international money markets where other nations' currencies find their gold value. If, on the international money market, it takes four hundred dollars to buy one ounce of gold, then it will take four dollars to buy one golder. If it takes eight hundred dollars to buy one ounce of gold, then it will take eight dollars to buy one golder. To establish the new golder money system it will require no new governmental or private institutions. cally nothing. Costs would be practi- While this nation has lost to other nations about half of the monetary gold recently held, America still has ample gold to back all the golders needed for domestic or foreign trade. All America needs is a little more brains and guts. All banks and financial institutions in America handling deposit accounts and creating credit money through the extension -17of loans - they must come under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Otherwise, the nation will drift back into money quantity inflation. The program to give the dollar an extended life of twenty to thirty years should include the following provisions. No bank or financial institution carrying dollar deposit accounts shall make a dollar loan which would increase the total dollar loans existing in that institution on the day the new law becomes effective. This will bring to an immediate end dollar quantity increases. Each bank and financial institution should be required to reduce its dollar loans and dollar securities investments by at least four percent each year. This requirement should fairly well amortize the dollar's life over a period of about one-quarter of a century. With these provisions, golders and dollars should associate on very friendly terms. The name Golder will inspire faith in its enduring value because the name is a reminder of that commodity which, above all others, has retained its value since man reached a mild condition of civilization. The preservation of the life of the Dollar is needed to ease the nation's struggle to meet its commitments and its legal obligations. It would not be within the power of the Federal Government, the State Governments or the local governments to satisfactorily meet their obligations with gold, with golders or with material wealth. The differences in quantity creates an impossibility. Social Security, pensions, retirement pay, military obligations and a multitude of other commitments must be liquidated with dollars. -18To attempt to meet these obligations with the present available real wealth substance would invite a rebellion of a very dangerous nature. The third major change needed to bring health back to America is the restructuring and perfecting of the economic machinery in America. This machinery uses money as blood to carry nourishment to all parts of the economy. Lei me again emphasize that America must look to money circulation, rather than money quantity, if this nation is to survive and prosper. One hundred billion dollars could have achieved each and every national objective, aimed at but not achieved, through the process of producing and storing in reservoirs nearly two thousand five hundred billion dollars. No means for the reservoir money to reach the places where it was most needed was provided. No economic concept is more dangerously false than that one which believes that large quantities of dollars made available to large industrial institutions will induce them to provide satisfactory conditions of employment, of wealth production and of wealth distribution. Unlimited dollar supplies could not gain the desired objectives. The Preamble to the United States Constitution sets forth and establishes six high national goals. The six are: 1) FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION, 2) ESTABLISH JUSTICE, 3) INSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY, 4) PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE, 5) PROMOTE THE GENERAL WELFARE, and 6) SECURE THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY TO OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY. -19It is important to note that among the words naming the goals there are no words referring to Capitalism, Free Private Enterprise, or the Profit Incentive. body of the Constitution. These are economic tools provided in the These tools are intended for use in propelling the nation toward her goals. The Government is made responsible for harnessing, controlling and directing the nation's manpower and material resources so that they will contribute to the nation's progress. Also, the Constitution provides the economic tools to be used by the government in managing the nation's manpower and material resources. Private Industry is motivated by the profit incentive and will not function in any economic region where there is an absence of the profit incentive - (profit opportunity). At this time the United States has no entity which is equipped or competent to assess and to determine the overall economic and social needs of this nation. The Government has no means to inform itself regarding the quantity, quality and best uses of its productive resources. The American Government's economic managers, in recent years, have permitted dollar quantity philosophy to displace the philosophy of earlier economic managers — the philosophy which believed that the full and wise use of manpower and material resources is the only means available to reach the nation's goals. If the American government is going to give up its foolhardy efforts to achieve social and economic health for this nation by printing credit dollars, and if it is going to wisely harness the -20manpower and material resources now being wasted, the following things should be considered. It is proposed that legislation be passed to establish the \"FEDERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE BOARD\". This Board should have about the same number of members as those which constitute the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Assistance Board should function in the economic field much as the Reserve Board functions in the field of finance. The Federal Economic Assistance Board should be empowered and equipped to explore every economic community in the United States, to ascertain the quantity and quality of manpower and material resources in each community; to ascertain the social and economic needs of each community; to ascertain how those resources can best be used to promote the nation's well being, and to ascertain what is required to satisfy the needs of the community. The Federal Economic Assistance Board should be empowered and equipped to explore and ascertain what opportunities for beneficial trade or investment exists in the various nations of the World — especially opportunities for profitable exportation of goods and services produced by America's fully employed labor force. When the Federal Economic Assistance Board is fully informed, it should establish National Economic Objectives, and establish priorities for those objectives. When the objectives and priorities are firmly established, then the Board should provide profit incentives whjch would induce Private Enterprise to do what is -21needed to be done to reach the objectives in all of those regions where, by the nature of things, there are no profit incentives to activate private enterprise. To illustrate this proposition, let us consider the unemployment situation which now wastes the productive power of nearly eight million citizens who are able and willing to work, but who, through unemployment are driven into hostility toward the government. It is proposed that the Federal Economic Assistance Board's economic machinery shall guarantee a job for every American citizen who is able and willing to work, but who, otherwise, would be unemployed. Each person working under the guaranteed job plan would be paid the legal minimum wage regardless of his productive capabilities. The job and pay is to provide decent living conditions for the worker; to keep him off the welfare rolls, and to keep him from becoming a social liability. No worker under the guaranteed job plan would be paid more than the minimum legal wage. This is to keep this labor pool from competing with private enterprise for labor. The moment private enterprise can pay five -:ents an hour above the minimum legal wage, private enterprise gets the man. Should any person who is unemployed and who has no means for self support, and who refuses to accept the guaranteed job employment, and then turns to crime to satisfy his desires — still, that man should be housed, clothed and fed, in jail. The Guaranteed Job Labor Pool will immediately absorb any labor released by private enterprise as a result of business -22decline or for any other reason. When business is expanding, the labor pool releases to private enterprise any needed workers. It is unthinkable that the Federal Economic Assistance Board, or any other governmental agency, should directly handle any work projects providing guaranteed jobs. For this purpose, the govern- ment is incompetent and unequipped. The government uses private enterprise in the production of war material and it must use private enterprise in the activities designed to combat dangerous forces in the homeland. In all of the activities of the Federal Economic Assistance Board and in the activities of the job guarantee plan, there is absolutely nothing that will weaken free private enterprise; that will lessen private enterprise's freedom to explore, to expand and to make a profit. The guaranteed job plan will do much to prevent business recessions and depressions. Since no money is consumed when spent in the home economy, there is no money cost to the national economy. Since the employed would produce many needed things now not produced;America would gain. The Federal Economic Assistance Board, through its international studies, can far better lead this nation in its overall foreign trade and investments. Presently our foreign activities are motivated and regulated by profit opportunities for private enterprise. Frequently profit advantages for private enterprise produces disadvantages for the nation as a whole and leads to activities which impede America's progress toward her high goals. The Economic Assistance Board would have the power to provide -23profit incentives which would induce private enterprise to contribute to, rather than impede, this nation's progress. To recapitulate: America's sickness is curable. To obtain that cure, false money concepts and false economic concepts must be abandoned. Money quantity increases must be recognized as a negative force rather than a positive force. Means must be provided which will carry money to the dry and undernourished parts of the nation's economy. That money must be free from inflation contamination and must have forced circulation. This nation will return to the road of ascendancy; will again assume the role of a World leader, and will progress toward her established goals when wisdom and sound judgment replaces money quantity as a controlling factor in the management of the social and economic affairs of the United States. ^tJ.jsL (Elj0t« in (tiurrtncQ (Enmmtssion 325 llrnnsghiama JWmtc, S.15. ans u BLANCHARD 111 JUasIjington, 5.C 20003 CHAIRMAN JOE COBB ExECJTivE DIRECTOR November 12, 1981 STATEMENT PREPARED FOR THE U.S. GOLD COMMISSION Public Hearings by Joe Cobb Executive Director The mandate of the U.S. Gold Commission, to examine the appropriate role for gold in the U.S. monetary system, has been interpreted by most commentators as \"whether or not to fix the price of gold in terms of dollars.\" We submit, for your consideration, an alternative proposal: Let the American people have freedom of choice in currency; demonopolize the monetary system of the United States and let gold (or silver, or Swiss francs, or anything else chosen by individuals) circulate or be used as a lawful tender. Mr. Costamagna offered a paper at the meeting of the U.S. Gold Commission on October 26, 1981, that would open the door to this idea. Rep. Ron Paul has openly advocated this idea, and we have noticed some measure of support for remonitizing gold in coin form to compete with the $3 billion per year Krugerrand/Gold Peso market in the domestic economy. The Issue is Not a \"Gold Dollar\" Advocates of a \"gold standard\" call for a dollar-as-good-asgold, modeled on the 19th century Bank-of-England system that fixed the price of gold in terms of pounds sterling, and which resembled the defunct Bretton Woods system. Their theory is that \"dollar\" is really a unit of weight of gold, although its absence from the National Bureau of Standards does beg a fundamental question. The larger issue, however, of how to stabilize the val .e of United States currency -- or to re-establish confidence that the monetary unit will have a half-life of more than three years [i.e. to reduce interest rates from the 20% range] -- is one that must address the meaning of the very words we use to write contracts. U.S. Gold tlUWlJliTS^ion Statement of Joe Cobb 2-2-2-2 Monetary Units and the Meaning of Words >rge Orwell, there was a government de B: o: etary system over the past 190 y< In 1792, Congress passed the first Coinage Act (31 USC 371) which created our decimal coinage system. Tin U.S. dollar was defined as 416 grains of silver .89243 fine (1 he amount of pure silver was 24.05C grams). Because the new nation, for political reasons -- Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution -- was supposed to have a common currency, the Congress established a monopoly for the central government's coins. Under Article I, Section 10, however, it is clear that the intent of the Founding Fathers was for the U.S. monetary system to be based on silvei and gold, not paper money. None of the Founding Fathers suspected that just 70 years later, Congress would pass the legal tender law and make the paper dollar our basic unit of money (12 Stat. 345). Because there was a government monopoly for \"dollars,\" the Supreme Court refused to distinguish between paper dollars and silver dollars (79 US 457). The principle had been established that the word \"dollar\" is a governmentally defined word, and whenever Congress wants to do so, it can change its definition. In 1913 and 1933, moreover, Congress created the Federal Reserve System and subsequently prohibited Americans from using anything other than its monopoly money (Federal Reserve Accounting Unit Dollars). Congress simply stripped any and all meaning from the word \"dollar\" in its original sense. Today the word \"dollar\" has a pronunciat on, a spelling, a connotation -- but it has no meaning. Like a\"l crimes of violence, the damiage cannot be undone: it is impossibl* today to \"put Humpty Dumpty back together again.\" This, unfortunately, is what the advocates of \"a Gold Dollar\" seem to want. There is no bill today in Congress to create a \"gold dollar,\" although there is a bill to create a new Silver Dollar (H.R. Monetary Units and Weights of Bullion The Free Market Gold Coinage Act (Senate Bill S.1704 and House Bill H.R.3789) is a new initiative to re-establish the famous principle of honest money, as expressed by philosopher John Locke in 1695. He wrote, the \"unit was i.nd should be a definite weight of bullion, which must not be altered.\" Bullion -- pure \"noble\" metal. Definite weight -- thK monetary system should emerge from the common system of weights and measures; it should not be \"invented\" by government as an artificial denomination of weight. It was an unfortunate historical accident that the common coin in the Thirteen Colonies was tot precisely an ounce of silver, which might have gone by the name \"One Ounce\" [more] without the government's trademark (\"silver dollar\"), but for that matter there was not a standard definition of the ounce in those days either. It was the monetary use of metal that led to the establishment of the standard of weight in 1827. Economist and historian, Murray N. Rothbard, in his book, Man, Economy and State, makes an important argument about preventing government from destroying a nation's monetary system: The transition from gold to fiat money will be greatly smoothed if the State has previously abandoned ounces, grams, grains, and other units of weight in naming its monetary units and substituted unique names, such as dollar, mark, franc, etc. It will then be far easier to eliminate the public's association of monetary units with weight and to teach the public to value the names themselves. Furthermore, if each national government sponsors its own unique name, it will be far easier for each State to control its own fiat issue absolutely. [p.941n] The Issue is Freedom of Choice The principle of freedom of choice in currency, therefore, is founded on the use of gold and silver, by units of weight, in all kinds of transactions where honest men and women come together to trade freely and make contracts. It is impossible today to make an honest long-term contract in terms of \"dollars\" because the word has no meaning. There is no difference between using the word \"dollar\" today in a contract and using the word \"shrug\" (e.g., I promise to pay you 100 shrugs in five years, at 10,000 percent interest); how may Big Mac hamburgers do you think you will be able to buy with the \"dollars\" you get back? If the government could change the definition of the word \"dollar\" in the past, what would prevent them from debasing the meaning of the word in the future? This is where the importance of \"grams\" and \"ounces\" becomes clear, because the Congress can not change the definition of those units. The kilogram is defined by an international treaty, and the ounce is defined by millions of other objects that weigh exactly one ounce. If the government tried to change the definitions of those words in order to inflate a bullion-weight monetary standard, people would just laugh and ignore the statute -- just as engineers and architects ignored the Indiana State Legislature in the 1890s when it tried to change the definition of pi from 3.14159 to 3.00000 to make the measurement of circles easier! Yet, in the U.S. courts and in payment of taxes, the undefined word \"dollar\" ir. the unit of measurement. The Free Market Gold Coinage Act, and its sister legislation, the Free Market Silver Dollar Act, in Section 5, establish the principle that you can use [more] U.S. Gold Commission Statement of Joe Cobb 4-4-4-4 gold bullion (or silver bullion) in courts and for the measurement of tax liabilities. The American Institute of Economic Research in Great Barrington, Mass., has analyzed the Free Market Gold Coinage Act as it was introduced in the House of Representatives and their valuable suggestions were incorporated in the Senate version, and in the Free Market Silver Dollar Act. The A.I.E.R. recommended that the use of the new coinage as money would require exempting transactions in gold and silver from discriminatory taxation, and lifting the legal tender monopoly presently enjoyed by paper dollars. Support for the proposal of freedom of choice in currency has received additional impetus from Dr. Richard Rahn of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, writing in The Wall Street Journal on Oct.22. He had been introduced to the idea behind the Free Market Coinage Acts at the Arden House Conference of the Committee for Monetary Research & Education in March, 1981. Dr. Rahn also made the point that the use of gold as money would require that transactions denominated in gold would have to be exempt from discriminatory capital gains taxation. As long as the IRS were able to enforce a monopoly rule that businessmen had to use \"dollars\" for bookkeeping, there would not be an equal competition and freedom of choice in currency would be nugatory. Section 5 of the Free Market Coinage Acts would repeal the monopoly elements of the U.S. monetary system, so that gold and silver coins could compete on equal terms with paper dollars. The Process of Currency Competition Since the issue is really Freedom of Choice -- not just gold or silver coins versus paper dollars -- the repeal of all monopoly elements in current law is essential. The bills in Congress to achieve this would coincidentally permit Americans to use other national currencies also, if they chose; they could keep checking accounts in Swiss francs, German marks, or any other currency, as well as in ounces and grams of gold and silver. In a free market economy, freedom of choice always makes the system work better. There are many reasons to believe that the new frontier in freedom of choice -- currency competition — will be the only way to save the United States from a devastating inflation that has already caused the highest interest rates in history because nobody with money to invest is willing to secure those investments with pieces of paper promising to pay \"one shrug\" in the future in exchange for real goods and services today. If the principles of John Locke were good enough for Thomas Jefferson and Congress when the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, the principle of \"bullion weight\" must be the principle that will save the monetary system, and the free market economy, of the United States today! -30- JOHN P. DESSAUER FINANCIAL CONSULTANT INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT SERVICES BOX 1718 ORLEANS, MA 02653 (617)255-1651 November, 1981 TO: The Gold Commission Re: Returning the United States to the Gold Standard Ladies and Gentlemen: My name is John P. Dessauer. I am a graduate of the Cornell Law School, formerly practiced law with the firm of Harris, Beach, Keating, Wilcox, Dale and Linowitz in Rochester, NY. Senator and late Ambassador Kenneth B. Keating, and U.S. negotiator Sol„M.' Linowitz were partners of that firm and both knew me and my work. After leaving the practice of law in 1967 I began a career in banking and investments that led to my becoming the senior investment officer in Europe for Citibank's Investment Management Group. Citibank is the nations largest commercial bank and has a large and successful money management operation in Europe. Last year I began a new phase of my career in business for myself. I now publish a twice monthly investment letter devoted to the subject of international diversification and the application of classical investment techniques to private investment. In the course of my work I have made observations and formed opinions on the subject of gold and its' role in John P. Dessauer monetary affairs. It is in that connection that I submit this testimony in hopes that it will be of value in your determinations. GOLD AND THE MONEY SUPPLY Controlling the U.S. money supply has become the number one monetary problem in dealing with inflation, the value of the dollar and assuring a sound basis for productive economic effort. Efforts on the part of the Executive, Congressional and Federal Banking branches of government have focused on the economic proposition that too much money chasing too few goods produces harmful inflation. Continued growth of the broad money aggregates such as M-3 have shed doubt on the ability of government, without a gold standard, to effectively control the growth of money. While I do not disagree with this logic I do wish to point out the difference between DILUTING the value of money and inflation. That difference is important in considering the gold standard. Gold is more than a special, unique commodity. It is more than a convenient tool for use in regulating money supply. It has been and still is money for much of history and for much of the world. Looking at gold as money may seem archaic but it is essential to understanding the current monetray problems and the benefits and risks of returning to the gold standard. John P. Dessauer 3 Once gold is accepted as money it makes sense to examine prices in terms of gold. We have become aware of the differences in view point that come up when things are priced in different currencies. Recently when the price of oil was declining in terms of dollars it was rising in terms of Swiss Francs, Deutschmarks and French Francs. Gold is money that transcends all currencies. Gold is gold in Saudi Arabia, Dusseldorf and Paris as well as Washington. When we look at the world's most important commodity, oil, in terms of gold a startling picture emerges. Back in the great depression the price for an ounce of gold was $35-00 and a barrel of oil cost $1.05. That combination produced a gold price for a barrel of oil of .9^ grams of gold per barrel. In January of 1980 when gold shot to $850 an ounce the official price for a barrel of Saudi crude oil was $25-50. That combination produced a gold price for oil of .93 grams per barrel, very close to the depression level. Currently, as this is written, gold is selling for $400 and oil for $34. The present gold price for oil is: 2.64 grams per barrel or more than 260% greater than the price in 1980. If world monetary experts judged inflation by looking at the price of oil in terms of gold they would conclude that we are in for trouble ahead because the gold price for oil has risen dramatically. John P. Dessauer 4 Instead we look at the U.S. dollar price alone and conclude that the dramatic rise in oil prices is over. That is our point of view as dollar based consumers. The Sheiks and Shahs of the middle east where the dollar is not a valid currency and who have looked at gold as money for centuries would have a decidedly different conclusion. Looking at gold as money and using gold to \"see\" the price of oil is one example of the complexity of the problem called inflation. Getting at the root of the money supply/inflation problem requires digging a bit deeper. DILUTION VERSUS INFLATION The value of money can be reduced by dilution as well as price increases. Dilution is seldom addressed in the discussions of how to preserve the value of the dollar. If the subject were wine, dilution would be easily understood. A glass of wine diluted by a quart of water is definitely less valuable that undiluted wine. Increases in the monetary aggregates, i.e. the printing of more money that the economy requires, is a cause of dilution. But the real problem of dilution is one of quality rather than quantity. Individual members of an economy through productive enterprise give money its value. Government adds to that value through exercise of its' classical powers such as the police power. Government also necessarily dilutes the value of money through social programs. John P. Dessauer 5 There is nothing wrong with sensible and well considered dilution of value through social action. In fact it may well be the neccessary result of any well run government. The problem comes when the dilution proceeds faster than the additions to value from productive effort. For purposes of reviewing the gold standard issue it is not neccessary to resolve that question. It is enough to recognize its' merit. The main point is to admit that dilution is different from inflation and that dilution may be a given in any well run social/economic system. Excessive dilution is harmful to the economy. The present consideration of returning to the gold standard is a thrust toward stooping excessive diltuion by making the connection between a currency, the dollar, that can easily be diluted and a money, gold, that cannot be easily diluted. There is no doubt that the world's supply of gold is limited and that gold, therefore, could be helpful in guarding against excessive dilution of the dollar. There is another part of the problem, price increases, that is not automatically treated through a mechanical connection between gold and the dollar. My example of how a falling gold price INCREASES the oil price in terms of gold is designed to make the point that there are dangers in returning to the gold standard with only dilution in mind. Fluctuations in the gold market, currency markets and commercialjnarkets_can and do affect the prices of world goods. John P. Dessauer 6 When the U.S. post office increases the cost of a first class stamp to 200, when General Motors increases the sticker price for a car, when the grocery store increases the cost of soap or napkins the product is inflation. Raising the price of things or services is inflation. That is quite different from dilution. Understanding the difference is critical to the gold standard issue. Returning the U.S. to the gold standard would be a direct handling of the issue of dilution but would not directly address the issue of inflation. Prices, in terms of dollars, would not be directly affected by the gold standard. Arguements that by controlling the quantity of money we would solve the too much money chasing too few goods problem ignores the difference between inflation and dilution. Inflation has many causes. Black markets during World War II and in Vietnam should drive home the fact that inflation can run wild even when there is too little money around. To embrace the gold standard believing that the problem of inflation would be automatically solved would be a grave mistake. It is important to address the diltion problem and equally important to deal with inflation. But they are, to a large degree, separate problems and require separate solutions. Some proponents of the gold standard point to 1971» the year when the past gold link was sevred, and claim that it is more than cooincidence that prices began their upward John P. Dessauer 7 climb shortly thereafter. That case is compelling but not proof that the gold standard would solve present inflationary problems. It could be that the pre 1971 gold price was set too low. It may have acted like price controls and once released from gold prices rose to reflect the dilution that had been masked by the gold standard. Perhaps the rapid increases in prices in the few years immeadiately following 1971 were much more the result of dilution than inflation. This aspect of dilution can be seen through the example of a stock split. When a company is doing well and the price per share rises, management may decide to increase the number of shares. This is a stock split. What happens in the wake of that form of dilution is a fall in the price per share. When the dollar is \"split\" or diluted we get the same result in that the price of a dollar falls. We \"see\" that in terms of rising prices rather than the falling price of a dollar but the process is the same. Refusing to admit the fact of a \"split\" by hanging on to a gold connection too long was the problem of the 1960s. The dilution of the value of the dollar went on but was masked by the dollar-gold connection. Oncethe connection was severed the fact of the dilution became all too evident. The severing of the link was forced by an outflow of U.S. gold that, in turn, is compelling evidence of this point and evidence of the risks in returning to the gold standard without recognition of the difference between diltution John P. Dessauer 8 Returning to the gold standard is not a simple solution to the problem called diltution. In fact the gold standard could be dangerous if it masked future diltution. Understating the extent of dollar diltution through the gold standard would set the stage for an outflow of U.S. gold, unstable financial markets and a re-run of past rampant inflation.
