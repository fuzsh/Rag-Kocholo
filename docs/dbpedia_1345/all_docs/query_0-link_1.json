        "text": "Normal Trigger\n\nBlack Trigger\n\nMother Trigger\n\nCrown Trigger\n\nA Trigger (トリガー, Torigā ?) is a product of Neighbor technology[1] that manipulates and is powered by Trion.[2] Despite being often used for combat purposes, Trigger technology also has other functions,[2] and in fact it is regarded as the cornerstone of the entire Neighbor civilization.[3] Combat-oriented Triggers have massive firepower, and are the only weapons capable of damaging and even destroying Trion Bodies.\n\nTriggers can differ greatly among nations. Unlike the more powerful Black Triggers, which are created through the self-sacrifice of a person with high trion, normal Triggers are produced through technology.[2] Earth developed its own Triggers after its contacts with the countries of the Neighborhood.[1] The organization responsible for manufacturing Triggers and fighting off trespassing Neighbors is called Border.[4]\n\nActivation\n\nTo activate a Trigger, it is necessary to touch the Trigger Holder and give a clear signal of one's intentions to switch into a trion body.[5] Border agents and trainees often use the vocal command \"Trigger on\" (トリガー 起動(オン), Torigā On, Lit. Trigger start-up ?),[6] whereas Aftokrator users declare the name of the Trigger.[7] Black Triggers have been activated both verbally[8] and non-verbally.[9][10] Border's Triggers can be switched off at any given time, usually with the command \"Trigger off,\"[11] but none is strictly necessary.[12] Aftokrator soldiers do not use any vocal commands to do so.[13]\n\nNormal Triggers can be activated by anyone, provided they have enough trion as even Operators can use trion bodies. Most, if not all, Triggers substitute the user's body for one made out of trion, storing the original body within the Trigger Holder.[14] Trigger Holders are sent to the same dimension as the flesh and blood body upon activation, which is located somewhere in the Neighborhood.[15] Trion bodies grant a Trigger user an increase in strength, speed and durability.[16] Any wound inflicted to the trion body will cause a more or less severe leak of trion, but no physical damage to the user's flesh and blood body. When too much trion is lost, or when certain parts are destroyed, the trion body disappears.\n\nIn Border\n\nBorder's Triggers are manufactured with the aim of being used by a large number of agents.[17] For this reason, their trion consumption, and therefore their power output, are lower than those of Aftokrator Triggers. Exceptions to this rule are the special, more powerful Triggers possessed by the A-rank agents of Tamakoma Branch.[18] Border's Trigger technology is generally considered crude by the standards of an advanced country like Aftokrator. However, soldiers from both Aftokrator and its vassal nation Galopoula have expressed admiration for their versatility, which is due to the great number and variety of Triggers in existence and the possibility of equipping and combining several of them.[19] The engineers of Border are constantly working to improve their Triggers and create new ones,[20] and indeed, the speed of Border's technological progress is extolled as outstanding.[21] One of the objectives of expeditions a.k.a Away Missions to the Neighborhood is to secure Neighbor Trigger technology,[22] which is chiefly done through negotiations and bargaining, but should the away agents be attacked in war zones, they will retaliate and take possessions of the Triggers of the enemy.[23] Border is currently in possession of three Black Triggers.\n\nCertain Triggers become available to a Border agent only when they has achieved a specific rank. C-rank groups together the trainees, who are not considered official agents.[24] They are allowed to carry only one Trigger out of the ten[25][26][27] available to them, which goes by the name of Training Trigger (訓(くん)練(れん)用(よう) トリガー, Kunren-yō Torigā, Lit. Trigger for training ?). Since they are meant for training, these Triggers may not as powerful as a regular ones[28], however this is unclear. B-rank and A-rank agents can equip up to eight Triggers.[29] lastly, S-rank agents are Black Trigger users, but are also allowed to carry their previous Trigger Holder.[30] However, to be classified as S-rank the user must have their Black Trigger as their main trigger which is why Yūma Kuga and Yūichi Jin don't classify as S-rank as they only use it for emergencies or on an as-needed basis.\n\nTriggers in Border are classified according to their functions, and define the role of an agent in their team or on the battlefield. The main three categories are Attacker, Gunner and Sniper.[31] They encompass the vast majority of Triggers capable of causing damage on their own. Triggers from other categories become available after reaching B-rank. Examples are Optional Triggers, Defense Triggers and Trap Triggers. Border personnel in general are given an uncategorized Trigger for self-defense (護(ご)身(しん)用(よう) トリガー, Goshin-yō Torigā, Lit. Trigger for self-defense ?) with very low trion consumption whose sole function is to create a trion body, in the event of an encounter with Neighbors or Trion Soldiers. It does not come with any sort of additional equipment.[32]\n\nMechanics\n\nIn Border, the actual Trigger is installed in a chip located inside a device called Trigger Holder (トリガー ホルダー, Torigā Horudā ?), which contains eight slots that can allocate one chip, and thus one Trigger, each.[33] Reiji Kizaki's Trigger Holder is custom-made and can allocate up to 14 chips.[34]\n\nEach Trigger occupies one slot in one of two columns, the Main and the Sub, each composed of four slots[29] (seven in Reiji's case).[34] Main Triggers (主(メイン) トリガー, Mein Torigā, Lit. Primary Triggers ?) are automatically set to the user's dominant hand, whichever hand that is.[29] Sub Triggers (副(サブ) トリガー, Sabu Torigā, Lit. Auxiliary Triggers ?) are automatically set to the user's non-dominant hand.[35] Typically, the user can only activate two Triggers at a time, one from the Main and one from the Sub, with few exceptions.[36] [37][38]\n\nEach Trigger consumes a certain amount of the user's trion, even just by being equipped.[39] As a result, each person can equip a different amount of Triggers, depending on their trion capacity. Trion capacity also influences the overall power of a Trigger, although the user's skill is a major factor in determining how effective it will actually be.[40] Once a person runs out of trion, they will be unable to produce their Triggers and thus be defenseless.[6] It is however possible for an agent in a trion body to pass their own trion to someone else through physical contact by establishing a \"Temporary Trigger link\" (トリガー 臨(りん)時(じ) 接(せつ)続(ぞく), Torigā Rinji Setsuzoku ?) with a specific Trigger.[41] The Trigger remains under the control of the owner,[42] but is augmented with the trion of the donor. However, using this feature multiple times can lead to said Trigger malfunctioning.[43] With the Temporary Trigger link it is also possible to temporarily use another agent's trigger that is already manifested as if it were their own, without physical contact with the user or their consent.[44]\n\nBorder Triggers that shoot bullets have built-in safety measures to handle strays. If someone in their flesh and blood body is hit, instead of being wounded, they will be knocked unconscious from the pain and the impact.[45] A further safety measure makes it so that if a Trigger is deactivated in an unsafe environment, the flesh and blood body will be summoned in a location away from immediate harm.[46]\n\nCustomization\n\nA-rank agents have the perk of asking Engineers to customize their Triggers.[47] In general, modified Triggers work the same as the standard model, but have added functions. Examples are:\n\nAi Kitora's Scorpion.[48] The default shape of her version has two blades instead of one[49] and can be made to rotate around the grip much like a pinwheel.[50]\n\nAi Kitora's Spider.[48] It is fired through her custom-made gun,[51] which is also equipped with a reel-in function.[52] Although Spider is an Optional Trigger, in her case it is classified as a Gunner Trigger.[48]\n\nYōsuke Yoneya's spear-shaped Kogetsu.[53] Since the handle of Kogetsu requires less trion than the blade to be constructed, he requested one of the chief engineers to create a variation of that Trigger with a longer handle and shorter blade in order to allow agents with low trion capacity to have a long reach. [54] Subsequent modifications made it possible to shorten the handle to fight in narrow spaces.[55] It is possible it is only these latter modifications that make it count as a customized Trigger.\n\nShūji Miwa's Lead Bullet.[56] It assigns a burden of 100kg per shot, and can be equipped in the same set of slots as the handgun,[56] making it possible to use other Triggers while firing.[57] Its downside is that Miwa must conjure a separate magazine which he must then slide into his firearm. The magazine is very heavy in terms of trion consumption, and the number of bullets that can be fired before reloading limited.[58]\n\nNozomi Kako's Hound.[59] The nature of its modification is unknown. It does not manifest as a cube, but as a sphere from which smaller spheres are then emitted.[60]\n\nYukimaru Ichijō's Thruster.[61] Its perks are unknown. He has two of them.[61]\n\nThe customization privileges of A-rank agents extend to requesting the creation of whole new Triggers. At least some of these Triggers become accessible to B and even C-rank agents, as was the case for Scorpion.[62] There are however Triggers, like Sōgetsu, which are at the very least not available to trainees.[63] What rules govern the accessibility of Triggers developed by A-rank agents is currently unknown.\n\nB-rank agents are allowed to perform minor tweaks on their Triggers with the help of engineers. Some of them are cosmetic, others alter the functions of a Trigger slightly. Temporary cosmetic modifications can play a significant role in a fight: an example is Azuma Squad changing the color of their Bagworms to white in order to camouflage themselves in the snow setting they had selected.[64] Permanent alterations can be used by B-rank agents and above to make a Trigger more suited to their fighting style without modifying its basic functions, which might be why they are not considered customizations. Examples of such tweaks are:\n\nthe Scorpion model wielded by Kazama Squad.[65] Unlike the normal Scorpion, its default shape is double-edged, with a hollowed out, slightly longer blade. The modification allows it to stretch and contract more quickly, thus making it even more attack-oriented than the regular Scorpion.[50]\n\nReiji Kizaki's Raygust.[66] Its handle is shorter and more streamlined than that of the normal model,[67][68] possibly in order to complement his unorthodox fighting style.[69]\n\nYūko Kumagai's Kogetsu.[70] Due to her often utilizing it to defend, she has requested that a tsuba} be added in order to protect her hands.[71]\n\nFurthermore, users of Gunner Triggers tend to have different models of one same type of firearm. For example, the assault rifles of Arashiyama Squad[72] are different from the one employed by Tatsuya Kuruma,[73] although neither model is counted as a customization.[74][75][76]\n\nStandard Equipment Triggers\n\nAfter activating a Trigger, the user will receive a trion body. B-rank agents and above are also endowed with additional Standard Equipment Triggers (基(き)本(ほん) 装(そう)備(び) トリガー, Kihon Sōbi Torigā, Lit. Basic Equipment Triggers ?)[77] and accessories. Although they consume trion as a result of being equipped,[39] and some also during use,[77] they do not take up a Trigger slot.\n\nStandard Equipment Triggers\n\nType Normal Bail Out This Standard Trigger destroys the trion body and engulfs the original in an inviolable trion barrier[78] before transporting it back to the safety of HQ or another previously selected location.[79] It activates either on command or automatically when the trion body is destroyed.[80] C-rank agents and non-combat personnel do not have this function because it is too costly to equip all Trigger Holders with it.[81]\n\nType Normal Radar A Standard Trigger that detects the position of trion bodies within a certain area, unless they are cloaked with Bagworm.[82] By expending trion, it is possible to raise its precision.[77]\n\nType Normal Trion Body Trion bodies are the most basic implement granted by Triggers. They are virtually invulnerable to damage that is not caused by trion (and thus by Triggers or Trion Soldiers), and also grant the user several physical enhancements,[16] as well as an internal communication system.\n\nAttacker Triggers\n\nMain article: Attacker\n\nAttacker Triggers (攻撃手(アタッカー)用(よう) トリガー, Atakkā-yō Torigā, Lit. Triggers for Attackers ?) are modeled after edged weapons. They require close quarters combat and are extraordinarily impressive in terms of balance between trion consumption and offensive power.[83] That is because only a small percentage of trion is required to manifest them, making it possible to devote the rest to sheer power.[84] In fact, Attacker Triggers are the most suitable type of Trigger for users with a low amount of trion. There are primarily, but not exclusively, three types of Attacker Triggers in Border.[85][25]\n\nAttacker Triggers\n\nBasic\n\nType Normal Kogetsu The first Attacker Trigger to be created[86] and the most popular.[87] It is a moderately heavy weapon with no gimmicks but very high attack power and durability.[87] Out of of the three main Attacker Triggers, it is regarded as the most balanced and generally the best made.[87] It has two Optional Triggers which can alter its shape and length.[83]\n\nType Normal Raygust A defense-oriented Attacker Trigger that can morph in a shield,[88] it was the last of the main three to be invented.[89] It has low offensive power and it is very heavy, characteristics that make it unpopular among Attackers.[90] Nonetheless, it is very sturdy, and its durability is further increased in Shield Mode.[88] The blade can be shrunk up to the size of a knife,[66] becoming lighter, and its shape can also be changed slightly.[88] It has one Optional Trigger.[91]\n\nType Normal Scorpion A blade that can be drawn from any part of the body and whose shape can be altered freely,[92] Scorpion was the second Attacker Trigger to be created.[93] By adjusting trion, it is also possible to change its size, but the longer it is, the more fragile it becomes.[94] It is powerful in offense and almost weightless, but its durability is low.[92] It is favored by speedy and crafty Attackers.[95]\n\nCustom\n\nType Normal Kogetsu: Spear A modified version of Kogetsu that takes the form of a spear, it seems to be classified as both an independent Trigger and a customization.[53] The long handle makes it a viable option for Attackers whose low trion amount would prevent them from fighting at longer ranges.[54] The length of the grip can be reduced at will.[55] It can use the same Optional Triggers as Kogetsu.[96][97] Its only known user is Yōsuke Yoneya.\n\nType Normal Sōgetsu A curved knife that vaguely resembles a hatchet. Since Kogetsu was the only Attacker Trigger until Scorpion was invented,[98] it must have been developed some time after the latter. It has its own Optional Trigger.[99] It was created for Kirie Konami, who is its sole user and fights by wielding two.[100]\n\nGunner Triggers\n\nThe Triggers used by Gunners and Shooters revolve around the use of bullets. Compared to Attacker Triggers, they have a lower firepower and a greater consumption of trion, but boast superior range.[101] There are four types of normal bullets,[102] which can combine to turn into composite bullets.[103] Bullets are composed of three main parts: a \"body\" that determines their power, a \"cover\" that protects it from wind resistance and extends its range, and a \"propellant\" that sends it forward.[104] Trion is divided among these three components, determining the power, range and speed of the bullets.[84] Their tripartition explains their inferiority in terms of damage to Attacker Triggers.[84] Overall, Gunner Triggers (銃手(ガンナー)用(よう) トリガー, Gannā-yō Torigā, Lit. Triggers for Gunners ?) are the ones that are affected the most by the amount of trion the user has. Regardless of the position of the user, all bullets are classified as Gunner Triggers, despite the Shooter position having been created first.[105]\n\nGunners and Shooters fight at mid-range, most commonly as support due to their relatively low firepower.[104] They use their Triggers tactically to control the position of the target.[106] Each position has its own characteristics, but the fundamental difference between the two is that Gunners channel their bullets through specific firearms,[107] whereas Shooters create trion cubes from their hands which they can successively split in smaller polygons or fire directly.[108]\n\nGunner Triggers\n\nType Normal Asteroid These bullets have no special properties, thanks to this, it is the most powerful Gunner Trigger .[109] It is particularly effective for concentrated fire.[109]\n\nType Normal Hound A Trigger that shoots bullets which pursue the target automatically, even if they are invisible.[110] It is possible to select between a trion-seeker mode, which causes the bullets to home in on trion bodies, and a guided homing mode, which is directed by eyesight and more precise.[109] These functions are disabled at high muzzle velocity.\n\nType Normal Meteor A Trigger that fires bullets that explode upon impact, it is used to cause widespread damage.[109] Shooters can set its speed to zero so as to employ it in traps. The size of the explosions scales with the amount of trion expended.\n\nType Normal Viper A Trigger that shoots bullets whose trajectory can be set before firing. Although most agents stick to a small number of patterns they have practiced with, particularly skilled users can create new trajectories before each shot, greatly improving the efficacy of this Trigger.\n\nTrion Cubes\n\nMain article: Shooter\n\nShooters create a floating cube whose size and trion content depend on their trion reserves,[111] and whose three basic parameters can be manipulated on the fly. This cube can be fired whole for a concentrated blast or split into smaller, identical polygons for a more varied offense.[112] The power of the original cube is distributed equally among the fragments, whose number appears to determine their shape: the vast majority of agents splits their cube in eight, 27 or 64 parts, resulting in more cube-shaped bullets, but pyramids[113][114] and Tetrahedra[115][116] are also possible, however it is an advanced technique for people who want to control the number and power of the bullets in detail.[117] can control the position of each fragment at will before opening fire, increasing the spread of the volley and striking from different angles at the same time. They can further diversify their attacks by delaying some of their shots so that fragments of one same cube are fired at different intervals.[118]\n\nCube fragments can remain in existence and retain their hovering abilities even if the user switches Triggers before firing them. Shooters can thus scatter bullets in specific locations,[119][120] switch to another Trigger,[121] and then switch back to the Gunner Trigger to fire the bullets they previously planted.[122][123] However, they must remain within a certain distance from the planted bullets to retain the ability to control them.[124]\n\nFirearms\n\nMain article: Gunner\n\nGunners have access to an arsenal of firearms, also known as Gun Triggers (銃(じゅう)型(ガタ) トリガー, Jūgata Torigā, Lit. gun-type Triggers ?),[125] made out of trion. Although they are classified as Triggers,[108] only the bullets they are used in conjunction with occupy Trigger slots.[126] At least two out of the five known types of firearm (specifically handguns and assault rifles) can be loaded with any two Gunner Triggers. When compared to the fighting style of a Shooter, these weapons are easier to operate[107] and more accurate over longer distances,[118] since each shot is the same as the one that preceded it. They also have an auxiliary function that increases range by an additional 20%. In addition to the three parameters of the bullets used by Shooters (power, range and muzzle velocity),[107] firearms have three more main parameters that set them apart from one another: rate of fire, weight, and number of bullets, which determines how many rounds can be fried before a reload is necessary, as well as how much trion is allocated to each bullet.[127] Unlike Shooters, Gunners cannot modify any of these parameters on the fly. For all these reasons, Gunners are considered more balanced but less versatile than Shooters.[107]\n\nHandguns and assault rifles are the most common types of firearms, but shotguns, grenade launchers and miniguns are also known to exist. Some of these weapons possess special features, such as shotguns's ability to fire multiple slugs at the same time and to adjust their spread,[128] and possibly grenade launchers granting their discharge a parabolic trajectory.[129][130] Each type of firearm presents different characteristics, but even weapons of one same type can be set with different parameters which do not count as customizations: for example, Takuma Yuba's handguns have lower range than average and can fire fewer bullets before needing to be reloaded, in return for which the power and speed of the bullets is increased;[127] Sumiharu Inukai's firearm, which is classified as an assault rifle[131] despite being modeled after the FN P-90 PDW (Personal Defense Weapon) submachine gun, is more compact and seemingly wieldier[132] than other assault rifles;[133] Hiro Kitazoe's assault rifle[134] is also worthy of note, as it appears bulkier than the other models,[135] but as a trade-off it might boast a higher rate of fire compared to other assault rifles.[136] The fact that Jun Arashiyama's assault rifle fires small Asteroid rounds with a high rate of fire[137] but only a single, large chunk of Meteor[138] suggests that even different types of bullets fired with the same weapon can have different parameters. It is currently unknown to what extent the appearance and type of a firearm is a direct reflection of its parameters, as well as how much freedom the user has in modifying their parameters. Similarly, the exact mechanics of reloading have yet to be revealed.\n\nFirearms can be made to appear immediately before use[139] and then dispelled,[140] although trion is expended to conjure a new one.[141] If the user so elects, however, they can be manifested as soon as the trion body is formed[142] and remain in existence indefinitely, even if other Triggers are in use.[143] All-Rounders who choose the latter option can use their turned off firearms in feints at close range.[144] Although the exact durability of a firearm is unknown, each of Yuba's bullets packs enough power to destroy one.[145]\n\nFirearms\n\nType Normal Assault Rifle Heavier than handguns and not suitable for close combat,[101] Assault Rifles (突撃銃(アサルトライフル)型(ガタ), Asaruto Raifuru Gata, Lit. Assault Rifle-type ?) have an excellent rate of fire,[107] and aiming with them is easier.[101] Assault rifles are generally wielded with both hands, the exceptions being when the user is injured[146][147] or in a state of Full Attack,[148] but can still be used proficiently with only one.[146][147][148] There are several different variants, all modeled after real-life assault rifles. There are 20 known users of this Trigger.[149]\n\nType Normal Grenade Launcher Grenade launchers (擲弾銃(グレネードガン)型(ガタ), Gurenēdo Gan Gata, Lit. Grenade Gun-type ?) appear to boast an exceptionally long range among Gun Triggers,[150] although it is unclear to what extent this depends exclusively on the parameters of the bullet itself. They are only known to be set to fire Meteor.[151][152] It is possible, albeit unconfirmed, that it is the weapon that grants its bullets their parabolic trajectory.[129][130] The only known users of this weapon are Seiji Marui[152] and Hiro Kitazoe,[151] whose model is derived from the real-life Milkor MGL-140 Grenade Launcher.\n\nType Normal Handgun A Handgun (拳銃(ハンドガン)型(ガタ), Handogan Gata, Lit. Handgun-type ?) is a small, light Gun Trigger with a lower rate of fire than assault rifles that is most effective at close range.[107] Due to being easy to fire with one hand, handguns are a popular choice among All-Rounders as a Trigger to equip in the Sub.[101] There are several different variants, which are modeled after real-life handguns. There are 10 known users of this Trigger.[149]\n\nType Normal Minigun A massive firearm with an extremely high rate of fire,[153] the Minigun (機関砲(ガトリング)型(ガタ), Gatoringu Gata, Lit. Autocannon/Gatling-type ?) is used only by Reiji Kizaki,[34] who holds it with both hands[154][155] except for when Full Arms is active.[156] It is modeled after the M-134 Minigun.\n\nType Normal Shotgun A Shotgun (散弾銃(ショットガン)型(ガタ), Shottogan Gata, Lit. Shotgun-type ?) is a Gun Trigger with high firepower but low rate of fire that blasts relatively large bullets.[128] It is most devastating at close-to-mid range.[150] The angle of the bullets can be adjusted to some extent.[128] Like assault rifles, shotguns are generally wielded with both hands,[157][158] but they can be comfortably operated with only one.[159][160] Its only users are Kōtarō Suwa[161] and Daichi Tsutsumi.[151] It is modeled after the real life Remington Model 870 shotgun.\n\nComposite Bullets\n\nAny two Gunner Triggers can be combined to obtain highly destructive Composite Bullets (合(ごう)成(せい)弾(だん), Gōseidan, Lit. synthetic bullets ?), whose properties depend on those of their components. Shooters can create them on the fly by merging two trion cubes. The process requires a certain amount of time and focus,[162] so few Shooters actually use them,[103] but the more skilled ones can pull it off even in the heat of combat.[163] Masterful Shooters can form a composite bullet in a mere two seconds, whereas inexperienced ones will require up to one minute.[164] The only way for Gunners to use composite bullets is to program their weapon to shoot them; however, that weapon will only be able to shoot the set composite bullet[165], additionally it is unknown if it takes up one slot or two. Currently, there are no known Gunners using composite bullets as ammunition. Composite bullets were invented by Kōhei Izumi which means they couldn't of been existed three years prior to Chika's and Yūma's enlistment.[166]\n\nComposite Bullets\n\nType Normal Cobra Cobra (コブラ, Kobura ?) is the combination of Asteroid and Viper.[167] Its properties are currently unknown.\n\nType Normal Gimlet The combination of two Asteroid cubes.[168] Its cover is twice as durable as that of a normal Asteroid bullet, making it a high-penetration ammunition.[169] It is used to pierce through the target's defenses while also inflicting damage.[170] When fired by powerful Shooters, it has enough power to stun and damage a Rabbit[168] or destroy the combined shields of several Idras.[163]\n\nType Normal Hornet The combination of two Hound cubes.[167] Hornet looks identical to Hound mid-flight, but can be distinguished from it thanks to its superior homing ability, which, depending on the target's movements, can lead to a more varied flight path.[171].\n\nType Normal Salamander The combination of Hound and Meteor.[167] It can pursue the target like Hound and, like Meteor, explodes upon impact.[172] Its blast radius is considerably vast.[172]\n\nType Normal Tomahawk The combination of Meteor and Viper.[173] It has the explosive properties of the former and the ability to travel along predetermined trajectories of the latter.[174] On top of flying complicated routes, its area of attack is wide, so avoiding it completely is next to impossible.[170] However, controlling it is known to be extraordinarily difficult.[170]\n\nSniper Triggers\n\nMain article: Sniper\n\nSniper Triggers (狙撃手(スナイパー)用(よう) トリガー, Sunaipā-yō Torigā, Lit. Triggers for Snipers ?) have the longest range and very high power. Unlike Gunner Triggers, Sniper Triggers are the weapons themselves, not just the bullets.[175] A large amount of trion is used up in one shot, so they are not suitable for rapid fire.[175] They are used almost exclusively for surprise attacks.[175] The distance at which Snipers fight makes it next to impossible for an opponent to counterattack.[176] However, this also means they are vulnerable at close range and require cover.[176] Since they can eliminate the target in a single shot, Sniper Triggers are said to be capable of turning the tides of battle.[176] Each of the three types of Sniper Triggers focuses on one of the three bullet parameters (range, speed and power).[177] Capable Snipers change them depending on the conditions and the target.[175] Trion is expended whenever a rifle is created.[178]\n\nSniper Triggers\n\nType Normal Egret It is an all-purpose rifle focusing on range.[179] The higher the the trion of the user, the more the range extends.[180] Aside from range, this Trigger is remarkable for its high muzzle velocity and firepower.[181] Since it has no flaws to speak of and is the most balanced out of the three Sniper rifles, Egret is the most popular in Rank Wars.[181]\n\nType Normal Ibis It is the Sniper Trigger with the most firepower, but its low muzzle velocity makes it difficult to score a hit.[182] Being the heaviest and the bulkiest of the three rifles, it is difficult to aim while carrying it, and thus users generally rest it on its bipod.[183] For all these reasons, it is rarely employed in rank wars.[183] The higher the trion of the user, the more powerful the bullet shot.[180] It was originally developed to combat larger Trion Soldiers.[182]\n\nType Normal Lightning It possesses low power, but it has the highest muzzle velocity of the three Sniper Triggers and a high degree of accuracy.[182] Furthermore, it is fairly lightweight,[182] which makes it very easy to handle,[183] and in fact it can be shot while on the move.[183] Although not on the level of Gunner Triggers, it is also capable of rapid fire, which makes it ideal for peppering the target with low-power bullets.[183] The higher the the trion of the user, the higher the bullet speed.[180]\n\nTrap Triggers\n\nMain article: Trapper\n\nTrap Triggers (トラップ トリガー, Torappu Torigā ?) are used to create favorable conditions for the allies of the user and unfavorable ones for the enemy by positioning hidden devices on the map and setting them off remotely.[176]\n\nTrap Triggers\n\nType Normal Switchbox A Trigger that allows the user to place marks corresponding to different traps on any point of the map, as well as to set them off at will.[184] Some traps are intended to damage the opponent, others to support allies.[184] The only two known ones are a blade that springs out of the ground when a target walks over it,[185] and a short warp that allows an ally to teleport to another location within a certain radius.[186] It is possible to change the effects of a trap even after placing a mark.[187] It appears the marks require a surface to be placed on, thus they cannot be placed in mid-air.[188]\n\nDefense Triggers\n\nDefense Triggers (防(ぼう)御(ぎょ)用(よう) トリガー, Bōgyo-yō Torigā, Lit. Triggers for defense ?) erect barriers to protect the user and/or their allies. They are considered one of the most indispensable Triggers for agents regardless of their position.[189]\n\nDefense Triggers\n\nType Normal Escudo It erects an extraordinarily resistent barrier from the ground or other surface through physical contact with it.[189] A single Trigger can generate multiple barriers.[190] Since Escudo is trion converted into matter, it can stop Lead Bullet.[191] However, its position and shape are fixed, and, since it is not transparent like the normal Shield, it blocks the user's vision as much as the enemy's.[189] Due to these and the other drawbacks of: the necessity of a surface where it can emerge from,[192] and the high trion cost[193] - it is considered obsolete.[193]\n\nType Normal Shield An extremely flexible Defense Trigger that erects a barrier anywhere the user wishes within a radius of about 25 meters.[194] It can be set to hover in one place or move along with a target; in either case, it leaves the user's hands free.[189] Its shape and size can be adjusted at will, but the wider the surface, the lower the durability.[189] A stationary Shield will be able to endure more damage before breaking.[195] The act of activating two Shields and overlapping them takes the name of Full Guard.[196] The durability of a Shield is greatly influenced by the trion capacity of the user.[197]\n\nOptional Triggers\n\nOptional Triggers (オプション トリガー, Opushon Torigā ?) lack any offensive or defensive capabilities, but they add to the user's flexibility in combat. Their effects are extremely varied, encompassing stealth, movement, support and obstruction. Certain Optional Triggers can be used only in conjunction with a specific position or a single type of Triggers, granting them additional properties.\n\nOptional Triggers\n\nType Normal Bagworm A cloak that prevents the user from being detected by Radar and other Triggers that detect trion signatures, consuming trion for as long as it is active.[198] It is a particularly fundamental piece of equipment for Snipers.[199] On the other hand, it may obstruct Attackers while they fight, so usage for ambushes is especially valued.[200]\n\nType Normal Chameleon This stealth Trigger renders the user invisible, but disables use of other Triggers while active.[201] Its trion consumption is quite taxing. It should be noted that Radar and automatic Hound bullets can still detect a Chameleon user.[110]\n\nType Normal Dummy Beacon The user can conjure small, floating orbs[202] that mimic their trion signature or, with the assistance of an Operator, a teammate's. Their function is to create disturbances on Radar. They can be activated one by one or all at once.[203] The movements of the decoys are mechanical,[204] and they remain active for only a few minutes before running out of trion.[205]\n\nType Normal Grasshopper It creates single-use[206] platforms which propel the user and allow them to change direction in mid-air, enabling hyper-spacial mobility.[207] The more platforms created at once, the lower their individual power output.[206] Ingenious users can also use Grasshopper to help allies,[208] lay traps,[209] and use the environment to their advantage.[210][211]\n\nType Normal Idaten A prototype[212] Optional Trigger that propels the user along a predetermined pattern.[213] The speed is so high it cannot be processed consciously, even by a person in a trion body.[213] It is especially powerful when combined with an Attacker Trigger.[60] However, since the trajectory cannot be changed once set, an enemy may exploit it to counter.[214] The only user of this Trigger is Futaba Kuroe.[212]\n\nType Normal Spider A Trigger that creates wires from a trion cube.[215] These wires can be attached to buildings to impede the advance of the opponent,[216] or, on the contrary, to increase the agility of an already mobile ally.[217] In some cases, it is possible to attach one end of the wire directly to the opponent.[218][219] The color of the wires can be adjusted, making it harder for opponents to spot them.[216] It can also be combined with Meteor to create tripwires.[216]\n\nType Normal Teleporter This prototype[74] Trigger allows the user to teleport a few meters in the direction they were facing upon activation.[220] Expert opponents will however be able to predict the destination.[220] The longer the distance covered, the more trion is consumed; thus longer the cooldown.[221]\n\nExclusive Optional Triggers\n\nAlthough the general rule is that no more than two Triggers – one in the Main and one in the Sub – can be in use at any given time, Exclusive Optional Triggers (専(せん)用(よう) オプション トリガー, Senyō Opushon Torigā ?) can be activated only when a specific Trigger from their same column is active.[36] All known Triggers of this type are used in conjunction with Attacker Triggers (with the exception of Miwa's Custom Lead Bullet).[58]\n\nOptional Triggers for Attackers\n\nType Normal Gen'yō An Optional Trigger exclusive to Kogetsu.[222] After it is activated, Kogetsu's blade or tip can be freely transformed, which can be used to strike enemies who have avoided the swing but are still in range,[223] or to slip through their defenses.[96]\n\nType Normal Senkū An Optional Trigger exclusive to Kogetsu.[222] By consuming trion, it dramatically extends the length of the blade for one or more attacks,[224] depending on the user's skill and speed. The swinging blade is most deadly at the tip.[225] Effective time and range are inversely proportional.[226] The average activation time is about 1 second, which corresponds to a range of 15 meters.[227]\n\nType Normal Thruster An Optional Trigger exclusive to Raygust.[228] It is used to propel Raygust[229] and, if necessary, the user as well.[230] It consumes and emits Trion to accelerate the blade and increase the power of its slashes.[229]\n\nAll-Purpose Optional Triggers\n\nAll-Purpose Optional Triggers (汎(はん)用(よう) オプション トリガー, Hanyō Opushon Torigā ?) are similar to Exclusive Optional Triggers in that they cannot be used on their own, manifesting their effects only through another Trigger. However, unlike Exclusive Optional Triggers, they must be equipped in the opposite set of slots as the Triggers the user wants to combine them with, preventing any other Trigger from the same column from being activated while they are in use.[231][232][233] All known triggers of this type can be used in conjunction with Gunner Triggers, and at least one of them can also be used by Snipers.[234]\n\nOptional Triggers for Gunners\n\nType Normal Lead Bullet A Trigger that replaces the destructive power of the bullet with a \"weight\" effect, but due to the high cost, it decreases the range and speed of the bullet.[180][235] These bullets bypass constructs made of pure Trion, including triggers like Shield[236][237][238], and Alektor's Bullets.[239] However, it can be blocked by Escudo and other Triggers that convert trion into matter[191], such as Kogetsu.[240] Lead Bullet mimics the properties of the trigger used, for example when used with Hound, it keeps it's homing property[241], or when used with Meteor, it will blanket the area, but will fall off easily[242], however it will decrease the parameters even more.[243] When used with a Sniper Trigger however, it will guarantee range through the structure of the rifle itself[180], on top of keeping the property, but the speed is still reduced making it unusable in a real combat situation.[244]\n\nType Normal Starmaker On top of inflicting regular damage, bullets equipped with this Trigger generate a marker in the areas they have hit.[245] These markers cause the target to show up on Radar even if they activate Bagworm or Chameleon.[246] The only way to remove it, is to cut off the marked section.[231]\n\nTamakoma Optional Triggers\n\nThe members of Tamakoma First have each their own exclusive Optional Trigger called Tamakoma Branch Exclusive Triggers (玉(たま)狛(こま) 支(し)部(ぶ) 特(とく)製(せい) トリガー, Tamakoma-shibu Tokusei Torigā, Lit. Tamakoma Branch Specially Made Triggers ?), developed from Triggers Takumi Rindō brought back from the Neighborhood.[18] They are completely focused on power output, disregarding flexibility and trion performance altogether.[99] These Triggers are prototypes that do not abide by HQ regulations.[18] As a consequence, they cannot be used in rank wars.[18]\n\nTamakoma Optional Triggers\n\nType Normal Connector An exclusive Optional Trigger for Sōgetsu that combines two of them in a huge Axe.[247] The trion consumption is high,[18] but its power is immense, to the point it is possible to bisect a Rabbit with a single swing.[248] Like other Optional Triggers dedicated to Attacker Triggers, it can - and must - be activated while two other Triggers are in use. It can be deactivated at any time.[249] It is Kirie Konami personal Trigger.\n\nType Normal Full Arms This Trigger seemingly enables the user to use all their Gunner Triggers at once, allowing them to wield one in each hand while also endowing them with two additional firearms mounted on their shoulders.[250] Two mechanical arms secured to the user's sides hold one Attacker Trigger each.[250] Thanks to the number of Triggers they are able to activate simultaneously, the user becomes a veritable one-man army with crushing firepower.[251] However, for the same reason, the trion expenditure is very high.[252] It is Reiji Kizaki personal Trigger.\n\nType Normal Geist A Trigger that, by deliberately disrupting the balance of the trion body, allows the user to vastly enhance certain Triggers or physical abilities.[253] However, activating it inevitably leads to the destruction of the trion body after all the user's trion is depleted.[253] There are five modalities or \"shifts\":[254] Blade Shift increases the user's speed and the power of an edged weapon,[255] Gunner Shift mutates the user's firearm in a cannon that shoots devastating beams,[256] and Speed Shift boosts the user's speed to even higher levels than Blade Shift;[257] the characteristics of Armor Shift and Special Shift are currently unknown. It is Kyōsuke Karasuma personal Trigger.\n\nUnknown Optional Triggers\n\nOptional Triggers whose functions have yet to be revealed.\n\nUnknown Optional Triggers\n\nType Normal Bagworm Tag Bagworm Tag (バッグワームタグ, Bagguwāmu Tagu ?) is a Trigger that consumes little trion but prevents Triggers from being allocated to the slots in the column it is equipped to.[258] All known users have it equipped in their Sub.[259][260][261][262]\n\nType Normal Enhanced Radar Enhanced Radar (強(きょう)化(か)レーダー, Kyōka Rēdā ?) is a trigger whose functions are currently unknown, however it seemingly can see people who are using bagworm.[263] Its only user is Border's sole Spotter, Asumi Amakura, who equips it in her Main.[261]\n\nType Normal Makō Makō (魔(ま)光(こう), Makō, Lit. Demonic Flash ?) is a prototype Trigger whose functions are currently unknown. Its only user is Futaba Kuroe, who equips it in her Main.[260]\n\nType Normal Silencer Its functions are currently unknown. In spite of its name, it may not be related to firearms, since it is also used by two Attackers with no Gunner or Sniper Triggers.[264] It is generally equipped in the Sub.[265][266][264]\n\nIt was first used in the Battle Simulation Exercise in Chapter 218\n\nType Normal Timer Timer (タイマー, Taimā ?) is a prototype Trigger whose functions are currently unknown. Its only user is Nozomi Kako, who equips it in her Main.[267]\n\nIn Calvaria\n\nCalvaria is known to have few Trigger users, at least compared to Spinthir.[268] In fact, it seems the vast majority of its military forces do not utilize Triggers,[269] so the planet-nation relies on Trion Soldiers (Marmods in particular) for defense.[270] Aside from their firearms,[271] soldiers from Calvaria also wield spears, curved daggers, and swords[270], although these weapons may not be Triggers or, if they are, they do not generate trion bodies.[269]\n\nCalvaria's Triggers\n\nType Normal Trion Ammunition Fighters from Calvaria can shoot bullets made out of trion through weapons similar to hunting rifles.[271] Since they mentioned running low on ammo during one of the battles against Spinthir,[271] it is possible only the bullets are made out of trion, and that the guns are regular firearms, leaving it ambiguous if they create a trion body or if they are Triggers in the first place.\n\nIn Spinthir\n\nSpinthir's Trigger users are easily distinguishable due to their black armor.[272] Like the warriors from Leoforio,[273] soldiers from Spinthir occasionally ride Trion Soldiers (specifically Bamsters) in battle,[272] although they are more frequently seen fighting on their own after breaching the enemy's defenses.[270][268] This planet-nation seems to have more Trigger users than Calvaria.[268] All of those introduced thus far dual-wielded their weapons.[270]\n\nSpinthir's Triggers\n\nType Normal Arm Blades This Trigger allows the user to summon two long, curved blades around their arms, or possibly to turn their forearms into blades.[270] They are durable enough to withstand the attacks of a Marmod without a scratch.[270][274] The only known user of this Trigger sported five short, parallel vertical lines on his helmet.[275]\n\nType Normal Bracers This Trigger allows the user to summon a flat, shield-like bracer on each of their forearms which are durable enough to withstand the attacks of a Marmod without a scratch.[270][274] An orb similar to the eye of Trion Soldiers also appears on the user's palm, with two smaller ones a few inches from the user's hand.[275] The only known user of this Trigger sported nine dots grouped in three parallel lines of three on his helmet.[275]\n\nType Normal Swords This Trigger allows the user to conjure two[270] double-edged swords without a handguard.[276] The only known user of this Trigger sported three parallel horizontal lines on his helmet.[276]\n\nType Normal Trion Body Trion bodies are the most basic implement granted by Triggers. They are virtually invulnerable to damage that is not caused by trion (and thus by Triggers or Trion Soldiers), and also grant the user several physical enhancements,[16] as well as an internal communication system. Those from Spinthir are covered in black armor with distinguishing motifs on the front of the helmet.[270]\n\nIn Menoeides\n\nExtremely little is known about Triggers from Menoeides, except that their Trigger Users are shaped like hexagonal prisms or parallepipeds, with dots and lines arranged in different motifs on at least one of the broader faces.[22]\n\nIn Aftokrator\n\nAftokrator is a powerful military nation,[277] and its Trigger technology is extremely advanced. Aftokrator engineers have developed Trion Receptors that become a part of the body of the person they are embedded in, increasing their amount of trion to create soldiers with enhanced abilities.[278] Another impressive accomplishment is the creation of Trion Soldiers with abilities mimicking those of specific Horn[279] and even Black Triggers.[280] Furthermore, some (though not all) of the nation's Black Triggers come with an armored cape,[281] although it is currently unknown whether Aftokrator possesses the technology to alter Black Triggers or the Black Triggers included them from the start. Seven years prior to the invasion of Earth, Aftokrator was in possession of 13 Black Triggers.[282]\n\nMechanics\n\nIn Aftokrator, each Trigger Holder seems to contain only one Trigger, aside from the equipment that comes with the trion body. The guiding concept at the heart of Aftokrator Triggers is the treatment of such weapons as an extension of one's body, which is transformed as a result.[253] Trion Receptors prevent the trion body from being destabilized by this process.[253] At least some of the Aftokrator Trigger Holders are worn around the wrist like bracelets.[7]\n\nStandard Triggers and Equipment\n\nTrion bodies formed by Aftokrator Triggers come with different equipment from their counterparts on Earth. They are more suited for battle, but can be said to be lacking in terms of logistics, since at the time of the invasion, Aftokrator's fighters could leave the battlefield only through the wormholes created by Speiraskia and did not seem to possess Radar. Since soldiers from Galopoula, one of Aftokrator's vassal nations, were recently[283] endowed with an emergency escape Trigger identical in principle to Bail Out,[284] it is possible Aftokrator has developed the same technology. This is further supported by Yūma Kuga implying it is not a technology found in the Neighborhood,[80] and by Border's Development Chief Motokichi Kinuta suggesting that it was copied from Border.[285]\n\nAftokrator's Standard Triggers and Equipment\n\nType Normal Cape Aftokrator Trigger users, including some Black Trigger users, are endowed with a cape that acts as armor, allowing them to shrug off certain attacks. It can resist Gunner bullets,[286] but not Attacker blades.[287] It can also block the effects of specific Triggers, such as Lead Bullet, and shed the affected parts.[281] If damaged, the cape will regenerate in seconds.[281]\n\nType Normal Trion Body Trion bodies are the most basic implement granted by Triggers. They are virtually invulnerable to damage that is not caused by trion (and thus by Triggers or Trion Soldiers), and also grant the user several physical enhancements,[16] as well as an internal communication system.\n\nType Normal Trion Receptor A jealously guarded military secret, Trion Receptors[288] are Trigger-equipped horns that are permanently implanted in the heads of young children[289] to dramatically improve their trion capacity and quality as they grow. Researches have also been done to use horns to increase compatibility with Black Triggers. The capabilities of a horned fighter far exceed those of a normal Trigger user. In the case of a Black Trigger user their horn(s) turn black.[290]\n\nHorn Triggers\n\nAftokrator's primary combat Triggers are known as Horn Triggers (角(ホーン) トリガー, Hōn Torigā ?),[290] or Enhanced[291] or High-Powered[292] Triggers (強(きょう)化(か) トリガー, Kyōka Torigā, Lit. Reinforcement Triggers ?). Although only one of them can be wielded by each fighter, they more than make up for it with their versatility and power output. The two revealed thus far have high offensive and defensive capabilities, as well as remarkable supplementary abilities. Their raw power is so overwhelming that normal Triggers from Galopoula[291] and Border[293] cannot compare.\n\nHorn Triggers\n\nType Normal Chelidon A Trigger endowed with massive firepower that has multiple configurations. It allows the user to fire powerful beams either by summoning explosive orbs around their person[294] or in their hands,[295] or, after shapeshifting, from an arm cannon with a high rate of fire.[296] Chelidon is also capable of shooting destructive rays with the ability to bend from the user’s back,[297] as well as of bombarding an area with a barrage of bullets,[298] of generating both focused[299] and large shields[300] and of enabling flight[301] for a limited amount of time.[302]\n\nType Normal Lampyris It permits the user to manipulate countless magnetic “shards” through a gauntlet.[303] By reacting with each other, the shards can create a wide range of constructs, such as shields,[304] sharp projectiles,[305]} railguns,[306] spikes[307] and giant shuriken.[308] The magnetism can also be exploited to restrain[309] or attract[310] a target after shooting shards into their body. Furthermore, this Trigger has vast supplementary capabilities, which include levitation,[311] the generation of magnetic tracks for high-speed displacement,[312] controlled reflection of trion bullets,[304] and camouflage in dark environments.[313]\n\nUnknown Classification Triggers/Devices\n\nParaphernalia created by Neighbors which do not seem to be part of standard equipment.\n\nUnclassified Aftokrator Triggers/Devices\n\nType Normal Holographic Projector This earring-shaped[314] device can project three-dimensional holograms for a variety of purposes. It can display the position of Neighbor planets in relation to their orbits,[314] and possesses a Radar function with a very wide range.[315]\n\nType Normal Tracking Beacon This bracelet is connected to Speiraskia. It sends a signal once the trion body of the owner is destroyed, alerting Speiraskia's user they need to be retrieved and allowing for precise warping.[316][317][318] It can also be attached to an enemy in order to track them down.[319]\n\nIn Galopoula\n\nDespite Galopoula being a small nation, its Trigger users are extolled as exceptional warriors.[320] Their Triggers are said to be suitable for fights against multiple opponents, so it is not uncommon to see them on the battlefield even if they are outnumbered.[320] Aside from combat, some of their Triggers are also ideal for infiltration.\n\nMechanics\n\nMuch like Border Triggers, Galopoula Triggers have a wide array of effects, and a single user can equip several of them. A major difference is the employment of pellets or tokens that are used up to activate certain Triggers, after which they disappear. Galopoula Triggers generally require one such token,[321] but some may expend more[322] or none at all.[323] Once a token is consumed, it cannot be replaced. Each soldier can carry up to 14,[324][321] stored in a holster on their lower back where they can be reached easily. However, if a larger supply is available, nothing prevents its usage.[325] Galopoula Triggers can be divided in two main types: Triggers that consume a token and Triggers that don’t. The latter can be turned on and off at will,[326] but that does not appear to be the case with the former.\n\nAlthough there does not seem to be an upper limit to the number of Triggers requiring a token that can be used simultaneously,[325] or, rather, that number corresponds to the quantity of tokens available, it is possible that Triggers of the other type follow a distinction vaguely similar to the Main-Sub binary of Border Triggers.[327] However, it remains unclear if there is a maximum amount of them, or if they are equipped to specific body parts. The exact operating principle of tokens is also unknown. It is unconfirmed whether each of them is dedicated to a specific Trigger (Wen Sō's fear of running out of Dogs lends itself to different readings),[327] or there is no substantial difference among them and which Trigger they activate depends on the will of the user or the circumstances.\n\nStandard Triggers and Equipment\n\nThe basic equipment of trion bodies created by Galopoula Triggers is not much different from Border's. \"Operators\" from Galopoula can assist frontline soldiers with a radar-like Trigger extremely similar to the monitor of Border's Operators,[328] but it is currently unknown if every agent is equipped with a radar Trigger per se and/or if the one used by Reghindetz[324] is an enhanced version exclusive to him.\n\nGalopoula's Standard Triggers and Equipment\n\nType Normal Bail Out Galopoula's version of Bail Out opens a Gate around the user, which has the benefit of not revealing the position of the base. It will activate when the trion body is destroyed.[329] It was developed by observing Border's technology in action.[285] So far, Galopoula soldiers have referred to this Trigger only as \"the new Triggers\"[330] or \"the new type\".[283]\n\nType Normal Token These devices are used by Galopoula soldiers to activate select Triggers before being destroyed in the process. Normally, a Galopoula Trigger user carries 14 of them.[324][321] Their exact mechanics are currently unknown.\n\nType Normal Trion Body Trion bodies are the most basic implement granted by Triggers. They are virtually invulnerable to damage that is not caused by trion (and thus by Triggers or Trion Soldiers), while also granting the user several physical enhancements[16] on top of an internal communication system.\n\nNamed Triggers\n\nThese Triggers may be the most powerful in the arsenal of a Galopoula soldier, since each of the members of the infiltration in Border had one. At least some of them require the expenditure of one or more tokens.[322]\n\nNamed Galopoula Triggers\n\nType Normal Despinis It allows the user to generate 16[331] spheres with rings that serve as blades. The orbs can be controlled telepathically to fight.[332] They can be moved in complex patterns and are effective primarily in mid-range combat. Multiple orbs can be joined into a larger, faster one.[333] It consumes at least one token.[331] Its only know user is Ratarykov.\n\nType Normal Nikokyra It allows the user to generate viscous slime, which has the ability to dull blades[334] while reducing attrition, limiting the opponent's grip strength and mobility if it coats their limbs.[335] It has at least two modes: in the first, a small amount of slime is worn by the user around their forearm much like a shield, coating the weapons that come in contact with it;[336] in the second, the quantity of slime is increased and can be manipulated in the form of tendrils,[337] even remotely.[338] It is unknown if it consumes any tokens. Its only known user is Koskero.\n\nType Normal Servitora This Trigger reflects the user's image, creating three-dimensional holograms.[339] These duplicates are optical illusions, and as such possess no offensive power,[340] but are useful in disorienting the opponent, since they will be unable to identify the enemy or where the next attack will come from. The copies possess a trion signature, which prevents Operators from finding the real one.[341] Since the duplicates are reflections, left and right will be inverted;[342] however, if a copy is reflected, left and right will be inverted again, thus matching the user's image perfectly.[343] It is unknown if it consumes any tokens or if it is the same Trigger that generates the smoke screen.[344] Its only known user is Wen Sō.\n\nType Normal Thugater A Trigger used by Reghindetz that looks like a long whip covered in spikes.[7] Since he was defeated by Hyuse without a chance to fight back, its abilities are unknown. It consumes at least one token.[13]\n\nType Normal Vasilissa This Trigger creates four mechanical arms ending in sharp blades on the back of the user. Each arm has great power, enough to pierce, lift, and throw a large amount of rubble[345] and pin a trion body user against a wall.[346] They can also be moved quickly and have a relatively long reach.[347] The arms are also very durable.[348] Should a blade be cut off, it can be replaced by a flat shield.[349] Vasilissa consumes two tokens.[322] Its only known user is Gatlin.\n\nUnnamed Triggers\n\nThe names of these Triggers were not revealed. Some consume tokens, others don’t. It is unknown how many, if any, of the Triggers falling in the latter category are common to all Galopoula soldiers or should be classified as standard equipment.\n\nUnnamed Galopoula Triggers\n\nType Normal Cane A cane that Koskero used to support himself after he lost a leg.[350] In the anime, the material is formed from Nikokyra residue. It is unknown if it has any other functions or if it consumes any tokens.\n\nType Normal Cannon A Trigger that creates a weapon encasing the user's arm. Its power has been compared to that of a Black Trigger.[187] In return for its destructive force, the cannon takes a few minutes to recharge after the first shot,[351] and has a strong recoil.[352] A cannon shot can be stopped by the combination of a Raygust in Shield Mode and a highly concentrated Shield, both at an angle to disperse some of its power.[353] It consumes one token.[321]\n\nType Normal Decagonal Blade A decagonal blade that appears on the back of the user's hand.[354] It can be hurled at the opponent and then retracted, granting the user superior range in melee combat.[355] It does not consume any tokens.[356]\n\nType Normal Disguise A Trigger that enables the user to mimic the appearance of another person[357] or of a Trion soldier,[358] or simply to flip their own image around its vertical axis to further confuse the enemy in conjunction with Servitora.[343] It is possible to acquire new disguises in the midst of combat by scanning the opponent, a nearly undetectable process that causes a small screen to appear in th euser's hand.[359] The user's body flickers when this Trigger is activated[327] or deactivated.[360]\n\nType Normal Mortar This mortar can fire several dozens of tokens at once, which, once embedded into the ground, act like summoning Triggers and open Gates from which Dogs emerge.[361] Thanks to the mortar's range and the vast amount of tokens it can shoot at once, it is possible to create confusion behind the enemy lines and have the Trion Soldiers dispatch distant targets.[361] It is unknown if it consumes any tokens.\n\nType Normal Octagonal Blade A weapon composed of a pointed blade and an octagonal shield that can be used for both offense and defense.[362] The blade can also be lengthened a few meters for a remote slash.[362] It is unknown if it consumes any tokens.\n\nType Normal Radar A more advanced version of Border's Radar, this Trigger highlights humans and the various types of Trion Soldiers with different markers; furthermore, it indicates the direction enemies are moving in, even displaying the trajectory of Gunner Triggers.[363] It is also able to detect agents cloaked with Bagworm.[363] It is unknown if it consumes any tokens.\n\nType Normal Shield Similar in appearance to Border's Shield, this Trigger allows the user to create a floating barrier (possibly more) in any position within a certain radius from themselves. It was only seen projected in pentagonal form and in no more than two different sizes. It is durable enough to resist even the slashes of Fūjin, a Black Trigger.[323] It does not consume any tokens.\n\nType Normal Smoke Screen A Trigger that, when activated, generates a smoke screen for the user to blend into.[364] It is possible this Trigger is a subunit of Servitora, the smoke screen being only an additional function to hide the placement of the mirrors.[344] It consumes one token, which is thrown in the air.[364]\n\nType Normal Summon This Trigger opens a small portal through which a Dog, or perhaps another pre-programmed Trion Soldier, comes out.[356] When available, a Galopoula soldier carries several of them.[356][365] Each Gate consumes one token, which must be embedded into a solid surface.[356]\n\nType Normal Tunnel A small device that when attached to a flat surface creates a hole large enough for a person to pass through.[323] When the effect terminates, the surface is restored to its pristine state.[366] This Trigger works on walls that are several meters thick.[367] However, it was implied to be capable of opening tunnels only perpendicularly to the surface the device is used on, and it may be ineffective if the wall is too thick.[368] It does not consume any tokens.\n\nUnknown Classification Triggers/Devices\n\nParaphernalia created by Neighbors which do not seem to be part of standard equipment.\n\nUnclassified Galopoula Triggers/Devices\n\nType Normal Controller A hand-held controller that can be connected to a number of devices, from appliances inside an expedition ship such as computers and holographic projectors[369] to Trion Soldiers.[370] The latter function is called Manual Mode and, depending on the type of Trion Soldier directed, it can be used for different purposes, two of which are reconnaissance[370] and combat.[371] Even if the controlled Trion Soldier is destroyed, it is possible to immediately switch to a new one.[372] It can direct up to two Trion Soldiers at the same time.[373] When the user is skilled, Manual Mode permits to increase the power of Trion Soldiers dramatically[374] with the user fighting in total safety. The user sees through the \"eye\" of the Trion Soldier via a helmet.[375]\n\nIn Ergates\n\nMain article: Ergates' Trigger\n\nThe Ergates Triggers revealed thus far revolve around the generation and control of Trion Soldiers. The nation is in possession of at least one Black Trigger.\n\nErgates Triggers\n\nType Normal Ergates' Trigger An unnamed, anime-exclusive trigger used by the residents of the errant nation of Ergates. This trigger was designed mainly to release and control specially designed trion soldiers for combat. However it has shown the ability to turn the user invisible similarly to Chameleon[376] as well as summoning a blade similar to Scorpion[377].\n\nTriggers of Unknown Origin\n\nTriggers whose country of origin is not known.\n\nTriggers from Unknown Nations\n\nType Normal Wire and Dagger An unknown Trigger Yūma Kuga used during his time in the Neighborhood. It summons two daggers connected to Yūma's wrists (to each other in the anime) by a string. Their small size allows the user to hide them under their clothes, a tactic Yūma used to disguise himself as a civilian and then swiftly eliminate the enemy.[276] The string can be lengthened to throw the corresponding weapon[276] and then retracted to quickly retrieve it.[275]\n\nType Normal Sword Trigger During his time in the Neighborhood, Yūgo Kuga dual-wielded Tachi-like Triggers, which he kept sheathed on the same side.[378] Due to his past involvement with Border,[379] the shape of the swords,[378] and the similarity of his Trigger Holder to Border's,[380] it is possible those are, in fact, early models of Kogetsu.\n\nTrivia\n\nThe names of Border's Triggers can be roughly grouped in five categories: meteorology, animals, foreign language words, kanji and astronomy.\n\nIn addition, Gunner Triggers are very often named after existing missiles, rockets or firearms.\n\nAlthough this has never been openly stated to be a rule, the Trigger Sets of nearly all known Border agents include two Shields equipped in their Trigger Holder.[149] Kyōsuke Karasuma and Osamu Mikumo, who have only one, are however in possession of another defense-oriented Triggers.[381][382]\n\nAnother possibly compulsory Trigger is Bagworm, as the only four agents to lack it are the three Trappers and Asumi Amakura, whose Bagworm Tag occupies the entirety of their Sub.[383][384][61][385]\n\nAll three known Tamakoma Triggers have been activated with the command \"On\" (起動(きどう), Kidō, Lit. Start-up ?) at least once, which, among Border's normal Triggers, is unique to this class.\n\nDespite the vast majority of Border fighters being male, most Triggers with only one user are part of the Trigger Set of a female agent, with a ratio of 4 used by males (Full Arms, Geist, Kogetsu: Spear and the minigun) to 6 used by females (Connector, Enhanced Radar, Idaten, Makō, Sōgetsu and Timer).\n\nThus far, all trion cubes summoned by Shooters have been divided according to the principles of rotational symmetry and have produced exclusively convex bullets.\n\nAll of Border's prototype Triggers are Optional Triggers.\n\nMuch like the nations themselves, Triggers from the Neighborhood have Greek names. Additionally, such normal Triggers seem to follow specific patterns:\n\nAftokrator Triggers are named after animals.\n\nGalopoula Triggers are named after titles, occupations and other terms related to women.\n\nThe author listed Vorvoros, Viper, Lead Bullet and Escudo as the Triggers he would like to try out, although he stated he would enjoy doing stunts in a trion body even more.[386]\n\nReferences"
