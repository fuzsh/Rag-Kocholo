Positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography studies have suggested patterns of abnormal cerebral perfusion in Parkinson's disease as potential functional biomarkers. This study aimed to identify an arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance-derived perfusion network as an accessible, non-invasive alternative. We used pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling to measure cerebral grey matter perfusion in 61 subjects with Parkinson's disease with a range of motor and cognitive impairment, including patients with dementia and 29 age- and sex-matched controls. Principal component analysis was used to derive a Parkinson's disease-related perfusion network via logistic regression. Region of interest analysis of absolute perfusion values revealed that the Parkinson's disease pattern was characterized by decreased perfusion in posterior parieto-occipital cortex, precuneus and cuneus, and middle frontal gyri compared with healthy controls. Perfusion was preserved in globus pallidus, putamen, anterior cingulate and post- and pre-central gyri. Both motor and cognitive statuses were significant factors related to network score. A network approach, supported by arterial spin labelling-derived absolute perfusion values may provide a readily accessible neuroimaging method to characterize and track progression of both motor and cognitive status in Parkinson's disease.\n\nSelective cerebral perfusion prevents abnormalities in glutamate cycling and neuronal apoptosis in a model of infant deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and reperfusion.\n\nPubMed\n\nKajimoto, Masaki; Ledee, Dolena R; Olson, Aaron K; Isern, Nancy G; Robillard-Frayne, Isabelle; Des Rosiers, Christine; Portman, Michael A\n\n2016-11-01\n\nDeep hypothermic circulatory arrest is often required for the repair of complex congenital cardiac defects in infants. However, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest induces neuroapoptosis associated with later development of neurocognitive abnormalities. Selective cerebral perfusion theoretically provides superior neural protection possibly through modifications in cerebral substrate oxidation and closely integrated glutamate cycling. We tested the hypothesis that selective cerebral perfusion modulates glucose utilization, and ameliorates abnormalities in glutamate flux, which occur in association with neuroapoptosis during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Eighteen infant male Yorkshire piglets were assigned randomly to two groups of seven (deep hypothermic circulatory arrest or deep hypothermic circulatory arrest with selective cerebral perfusion for 60 minutes at 18â) and four control pigs without cardiopulmonary bypass support. Carbon-13-labeled glucose as a metabolic tracer was infused, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance were used for metabolic analysis in the frontal cortex. Following 2.5âh of cerebral reperfusion, we observed similar cerebral adenosine triphosphate levels, absolute levels of lactate and citric acid cycle intermediates, and carbon-13 enrichment among three groups. However, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest induced significant abnormalities in glutamate cycling resulting in reduced glutamate/glutamine and elevated Î³-aminobutyric acid/glutamate along with neuroapoptosis, which were all prevented by selective cerebral perfusion. The data suggest that selective cerebral perfusion prevents these modifications in glutamate/glutamine/Î³-aminobutyric acid cycling and protects the cerebral cortex from apoptosis.

This study was undertaken to demonstrate structural and perfusion brain abnormalities. Fifty-six children diagnosed clinically as having cerebral palsy were studied between 1 to 14 years of age and were subjected to 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Brain and Technetium-99m-ECD brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan. Male to female ratio was 1.8:1 with a mean age of 4.16 Â± 2.274 years. Spastic cerebral palsy was the most common type, observed in 91%. Birth asphyxia was the most common etiology (69.6%). White matter changes (73.2%) such as periventricular leukomalacia and corpus callosal thinning were the most common findings on MRI. On SPECT all cases except one revealed perfusion impairments in different regions of brain. MRI is more sensitive in detecting white matter changes, whereas SPECT is better in detecting cortical and subcortical gray matter abnormalities of perfusion.

These findings are not, however, specific or consistent enough to build up a coherent theory of the origin and nature of the brain abnormality in autistic patients. Twenty-three children with infantile autism and 26 non-autistic controls matched for IQ and age were examined using brain-perfusion single photon emission computed tomography with technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer. In autistic subjects, we assessed the relationship between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and symptom profiles. Images were anatomically normalized, and voxel-by-voxel analyses were performed. Decreases in rCBF in autistic patients compared with the control group were identified in the bilateral insula, superior temporal gyri and left prefrontal cortices. Analysis of the correlations between syndrome scores and rCBF revealed that each syndrome was associated with a specific pattern of perfusion in the limbic system and the medial prefrontal cortex. The results confirmed the associations of (i) impairments in communication and social interaction that are thought to be related to deficits in the theory of mind (ToM) with altered perfusion in the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus, and (ii) the obsessive desire for sameness with altered perfusion in the right medial temporal lobe. The perfusion abnormalities seem to be related to the cognitive dysfunction observed in autism, such as deficits in ToM, abnormal responses to sensory stimuli, and the obsessive desire for sameness. The perfusion patterns suggest possible locations of abnormalities of brain function underlying abnormal behaviour patterns in autistic individuals.\n\nHyperventilation, cerebral perfusion, and syncope.\n\nPubMed\n\nImmink, R V; Pott, F C; Secher, N H; van Lieshout, J J\n\n2014-04-01\n\nThis review summarizes evidence in humans for an association between hyperventilation (HV)-induced hypocapnia and a reduction in cerebral perfusion leading to syncope defined as transient loss of consciousness (TLOC). The cerebral vasculature is sensitive to changes in both the arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and oxygen (PaO2) partial pressures so that hypercapnia/hypoxia increases and hypocapnia/hyperoxia reduces global cerebral blood flow. Cerebral hypoperfusion and TLOC have been associated with hypocapnia related to HV. Notwithstanding pronounced cerebrovascular effects of PaCO2 the contribution of a low PaCO2 to the early postural reduction in middle cerebral artery blood velocity is transient. HV together with postural stress does not reduce cerebral perfusion to such an extent that TLOC develops. However when HV is combined with cardiovascular stressors like cold immersion or reduced cardiac output brain perfusion becomes jeopardized. Whether, in patients with cardiovascular disease and/or defect, cerebral blood flow cerebral control HV-induced hypocapnia elicits cerebral hypoperfusion, leading to TLOC, remains to be established.\n\nSelective cerebral perfusion prevents abnormalities in glutamate cycling and neuronal apoptosis in a model of infant deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and reperfusion\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKajimoto, Masaki; Ledee, Dolena R.; Olson, Aaron K.\n\nRationale: Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) is often required for the repair of complex congenital cardiac defects in infants. However, DHCA induces neuroapoptosis associated with later development of neurocognitive abnormalities. Selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) theoretically provides superior neural protection possibly through modifications in cerebral substrate oxidation and closely integrated glutamate cycling. Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that SCP modulates glucose entry into the citric acid cycle, and ameliorates abnormalities in glutamate flux which occur in association neuroapoptosis during DHCA. Methods and Results: Eighteen male Yorkshire piglets (age 34-44 days) were assigned randomly to 2 groups of 7 (DHCA or DHCAmoreÂ Â» with SCP for 60 minutes at 18 Â°C) and 4 control pigs without cardiopulmonary bypass support. After the completion of rewarming from DHCA, 13-Carbon-labeled (13C) glucose as a metabolic tracer was infused. We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance for metabolic analysis in the frontal cortex. Following 2.5 hours of cerebral reperfusion, we observed similar cerebral ATP levels, absolute levels of lactate and citric acid cycle intermediates, and 13C-enrichment. However, DHCA induced significant abnormalities in glutamate cycling resulting in reduced glutamate/glutamine and elevated Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/glutamate along with neuroapoptosis (TUNEL), which were all prevented by SCP. Conclusions: DHCA alone induces abnormalities in cycling of the major neurotransmitters in association with neuroapoptosis, but does not alter cerebral glucose utilization during reperfusion. The data suggest that SCP prevents these modifications in glutamate/glutamine/GABA cycling and protects the cerebral cortex from neuroapoptosis.Â«Â less\n\nA reappraisal of retrograde cerebral perfusion.\n\nPubMed\n\nUeda, Yuichi\n\n2013-05-01\n\nBrain protection during aortic arch surgery by perfusing cold oxygenated blood into the superior vena cava was first reported by Lemole et al. In 1990 Ueda and associates first described the routine use of continuous retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) in thoracic aortic surgery for the purpose of cerebral protection during the interval of obligatory interruption of anterograde cerebral flow. The beneficial effects of RCP may be its ability to sustain brain hypothermia during hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) and removal of embolic material from the arterial circulation of the brain. RCP can offer effective brain protection during HCA for about 40 to 60 minutes.

Thus, cerebral protection strategy plays the key role to obtain respectable results in aortic arch repair. Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was introduced in 1970s to decrease the ischemic insults to the brain. However, safe duration of circulatory arrest time was limited to 30 minutes.

These two cerebral perfusion techniques significantly decreased incidence of postoperative neurological dysfunction and mortality after aortic arch surgery.

To date, many surgeons favor ACP over RCP during a complex aortic arch repair, such as total arch replacement and hybrid arch replacement. However, the question is whether the use of ACP is necessary during a short, limited circulatory arrest time, such as hemiarch replacement? There is a paucity of data that proves the advantages of a complex ACP over a simple RCP for a short circulatory arrest time.

We analyzed retrospectively arterial spin-labeled cerebral blood flow (CBF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in 21 patients with medulloblastoma (MB), 18 patients with pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), and 64 neurologically normal children. We generated ANCOVA models to evaluate treatment effects on the cerebral cortex, thalamus, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and cerebral white matter at time points an average of 5.7 years after original diagnosis. A retrospective review of patient charts identified 12 patients with neurocognitive data and in whom the relationship between IQ and magnetic resonance imaging variables was assessed for each brain structure. Patients with MB (all treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation) had significantly lower global CBF relative to controls (10%-23% lower, varying by anatomic region, all adjusted P?.05), whereas patients with PA (all treated with surgery alone) had normal CBF. ADC was decreased specifically in the hippocampus and amygdala of patients with MB and within the amygdala of patients with PA but otherwise remained normal after therapy. In the patients with tumor previously evaluated for IQ, regional ADC, but not CBF, correlated with IQ (R 2 ?=?0.33-0.75). The treatment for MB, but not PA, was associated with globally reduced CBF. Treatment in both tumor types was associated with diffusion abnormalities of the mesial temporal lobe structures. Despite significant perfusion abnormalities in patients with MB, diffusion, but not perfusion, correlated with cognitive outcomes. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to investigate whether selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP) or retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) can provide perfusion equally to various anatomical positions in the brain using metabolic evidence obtained from microdialysis. Eighteen piglets were randomly assigned to 40 min of circulatory arrest (CA) at 18Â°C without cerebral perfusion (DHCA group, n = 6) or with SACP (SACP group, n = 6) or RCP (RCP group, n = 6). Microdialysis parameters (glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and glutamate) were measured every 30 min in cortex and striatum. After 3 h of reperfusion, brain tissue was harvested for Western blot measurement of Î±-spectrin. After 40 min of CA, the DHCA group showed marked elevations of lactate and glycerol and a reduction in glucose in the microdialysis perfusate (all P < 0.05). The changes in glucose, lactate, and glycerol in the perfusate and Î±-spectrin expression in brain tissue were similar between cortex and striatum in the SACP group (all P > 0.05). In the RCP group, the cortex exhibited lower glucose, higher lactate, and higher glycerol in the perfusate and higher Î±-spectrin expression in brain tissue compared with the striatum (all P < 0.05). Glutamate showed no difference between cortex and striatum in all groups (all P > 0.05). In summary, SACP provided uniform and continuous cerebral perfusion to most anatomical sites in the brain, whereas RCP resulted in less sufficient perfusion to the cortex but better perfusion to the striatum.

Zolpidem belongs to the imidazopyridine chemical class and it illicits its pharmacological action via the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor system through stimulation of particularly the omega 1 receptors and to a lesser extent omega 2 receptors. Previously it was reported that no cerebral blood flow effects were observed in normal baboons after treatment with zolpidem, whereas an asymmetric regional increase in cerebral blood flow was observed in a neurologically abnormal baboon. In this study, the effect of a combination of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (CAS 78755-81-4) and zolpidem on brain perfusion was examined by the 99mTc-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) split dose brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Four normal baboons and the neurologically abnormal baboon from the previous zolpidem study were examined. In the current study the asymmetric changes observed after zolpidem--only treatment in the abnormal baboon was attenuated by flumazenil intervention. A decreased brain blood flow was observed after combination treatment of zolpidem and flumazenil in the normal baboons. The involvement of the omega receptors is suggested by these results. Up- or down-regulation of omega receptors may also contribute to the observed responses in the abnormal baboon and a brain injured patient.\n\nCerebral misery perfusion due to carotid occlusive disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMaddula, Mohana; Sprigg, Nikola; Bath, Philip M; Munshi, Sunil\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPurpose Cerebral misery perfusion (CMP) is a condition where cerebral autoregulatory capacity is exhausted, and cerebral blood supply in insufficient to meet metabolic demand. We present an educational review of this important condition, which has a range of clinical manifestations. Method A non-systematic review of published literature was undertaken on CMP and major cerebral artery occlusive disease, using Pubmed and Sciencedirect. Findings Patients with CMP may present with strokes in watershed territories, collapses and transient ischaemic attacks or episodic movements associated with an orthostatic component. While positron emission tomography is the gold standard investigation for misery perfusion, advanced MRI is being increasingly used as an alternative investigation modality. The presence of CMP increases the risk of strokes. In addition to the devastating effect of stroke, there is accumulating evidence of impaired cognition and quality of life with carotid occlusive disease (COD) and misery perfusion. The evidence for revascularisation in the setting of complete carotid occlusion is weak. Medical management constitutes careful blood pressure management while addressing other vascular risk factors. Discussion The evidence for the management of patients with COD and CMP is discussed, together with recommendations based on our local experience. In this review, we focus on misery perfusion due to COD. Conclusion Patients with CMP and COD may present with a wide-ranging clinical phenotype and therefore to many specialties. Early identification of patients with misery perfusion may allow appropriate management and focus on strategies to maintain or improve cerebral blood flow, while avoiding potentially harmful treatment.

It is still unclear however whether RCP provides adequate microcirculatory blood flow at a capillary level. We used intravital microscopy to directly visualize the cerebral capillary blood flow in a piglet model of RCP. Twelve pigs (weight 9.7 +/- 0.9 kg) were divided into two groups (n = 6 each): deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) and RCP. After the creation of a window over the parietal cerebral cortex, pigs underwent 10 minutes of normothermic bypass and 40 minutes of cooling to 15 degrees C on cardiopulmonary bypass ([CPB] pH-stat, hemocrit 30%, pump flow 100 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1)). This was followed by 45 minutes of DHCA and rewarming on CPB to 37 degrees C. In the RCP group the brain was retrogradely perfused (pump flow 30 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1)) during DHCA through the superior vena cava after inferior vena cava occlusion. Plasma was labeled with fluorescein-isothiocyanate-dextran for assessing microvascular diameter and functional capillary density (FCD), defined as total length of erythrocyte-perfused capillaries per observation area. Cerebral tissue oxygenation was determined by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen (NADH) autofluorescence, which increases during tissue ischemia. During normothermic and hypothermic antegrade cerebral perfusion the FCD did not significantly change from base line (97% +/- 14% and 96% +/- 12%, respectively). During retrograde cerebral perfusion the FCD decreased highly significantly to 2% +/- 2% of base line values (p < 0.001). Thus there was no evidence of significant capillary blood flow during retrograde cerebral perfusion. The microvascular diameter of cerebral arterioles that were slowly perfused significantly decreased to 27% +/- 6% of base line levels during RCP. NADH fluorescence progressively and significantly increased during RCP, indicating poorer tissue\n\nPerfusion Neuroimaging Abnormalities Alone Distinguish National Football League Players from a Healthy Population.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmen, Daniel G; Willeumier, Kristen; Omalu, Bennet; Newberg, Andrew; Raghavendra, Cauligi; Raji, Cyrus A\n\n2016-04-25\n\nNational Football League (NFL) players are exposed to multiple head collisions during their careers. Increasing awareness of the adverse long-term effects of repetitive head trauma has raised substantial concern among players, medical professionals, and the general public. To determine whether low perfusion in specific brain regions on neuroimaging can accurately separate professional football players from healthy controls. A cohort of retired and current NFL players (nâ=â161) were recruited in a longitudinal study starting in 2009 with ongoing interval follow up. A healthy control group (nâ=â124) was separately recruited for comparison. Assessments included medical examinations, neuropsychological tests, and perfusion neuroimaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Perfusion estimates of each scan were quantified using a standard atlas. We hypothesized that hypoperfusion particularly in the orbital frontal, anterior cingulate, anterior temporal, hippocampal, amygdala, insular, caudate, superior/mid occipital, and cerebellar sub-regions alone would reliably separate controls from NFL players. Cerebral perfusion differences were calculated using a one-way ANOVA and diagnostic separation was determined with discriminant and automatic linear regression predictive models. NFL players showed lower cerebral perfusion on average (pâ<â0.01) in 36 brain regions. The discriminant analysis subsequently distinguished NFL players from controls with 90% sensitivity, 86% specificity, and 94% accuracy (95% CI 95-99). Automatic linear modeling achieved similar results. Inclusion of age and clinical co-morbidities did not improve diagnostic classification. Specific brain regions commonly damaged in traumatic brain injury show abnormally low perfusion on SPECT in professional NFL players. These same regions alone can distinguish this group from healthy subjects with high diagnostic accuracy. This study carries implications for the neurological safety\n\nHow to Perfuse: Concepts of Cerebral Protection during Arch Replacement\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHabertheuer, Andreas; Wiedemann, Dominik; Kocher, Alfred; Laufer, Guenther; Vallabhajosyula, Prashanth\n\n2015-01-01\n\nArch surgery remains undoubtedly among the most technically and strategically challenging endeavors in cardiovascular surgery. Surgical interventions of thoracic aneurysms involving the aortic arch require complete circulatory arrest in deep hypothermia (DHCA) or elaborate cerebral perfusion strategies with varying degrees of hypothermia to achieve satisfactory protection of the brain from ischemic insults, that is, unilateral/bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) and retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP). Despite sophisticated and increasingly individualized surgical approaches for complex aortic pathologies, there remains a lack of consensus regarding the optimal method of cerebral protection and circulatory management during the time of arch exclusion. Many recent studies argue in favor of ACP with various degrees of hypothermic arrest during arch reconstruction and its advantages have been widely demonstrated. In fact ACP with more moderate degrees of hypothermia represents a paradigm shift in the cardiac surgery community and is widely adopted as an emergent strategy; however, many centers continue to report good results using other perfusion strategies. Amidst this important discussion we review currently available surgical strategies of cerebral protection management and compare the results of recent European multicenter and single-center data.

It is important that cerebral perfusion pressure be maintained above this level to ensure adequate cerebral blood flow, especially in patients with high intracranial pressure. However, the critical cerebral perfusion pressure of 50 mm Hg, obtained by decreasing mean arterial pressure, differs from the value of 30 mm Hg, obtained by increasing intracranial pressure, which we previously showed was due to microvascular shunt flow maintenance of a falsely high cerebral blood flow. The present study shows that the critical cerebral perfusion pressure, measured by increasing intracranial pressure to decrease cerebral perfusion pressure, is inaccurate but accurately determined by dopamine-induced dynamic intracranial pressure reactivity and cerebrovascular reactivity. Cerebral perfusion pressure was decreased either by increasing intracranial pressure or decreasing mean arterial pressure and the critical cerebral perfusion pressure by both methods compared. Cortical Doppler flux, intracranial pressure, and mean arterial pressure were monitored throughout the study. At each cerebral perfusion pressure, we measured microvascular RBC flow velocity, blood-brain barrier integrity (transcapillary dye extravasation), and tissue oxygenation (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) in the cerebral cortex of rats using in vivo two-photon laser scanning microscopy. University laboratory. Male Sprague-Dawley rats. At each cerebral perfusion pressure, dopamine-induced arterial pressure transients (~10 mm Hg, ~45 s duration) were used to measure induced intracranial pressure reactivity (Î intracranial pressure/Î mean arterial pressure) and induced cerebrovascular reactivity (Î cerebral blood flow/Î mean arterial pressure). At a normal cerebral perfusion pressure of 70 mm Hg, 10 mm Hg mean arterial pressure pulses had no effect on\n\nRepeatability of Bolus Kinetics Ultrasound Perfusion Imaging for the Quantification of Cerebral Blood Flow.\n\nPubMed\n\nVinke, Elisabeth J; Eyding, Jens; de Korte, Chris L; Slump, Cornelis H; van der Hoeven, Johannes G; Hoedemaekers, Cornelia W E\n\n2017-12-01\n\nUltrasound perfusion imaging (UPI) can be used for the quantification of cerebral perfusion. In a neuro-intensive care setting, repeated measurements are required to evaluate changes in cerebral perfusion and monitor therapy. The aim of this study was to determine the repeatability of UPI in quantification of cerebral perfusion. UPI measurement of cerebral perfusion was performed three times in healthy patients. The coefficients of variation of the three bolus injections were calculated for both time- and volume-derived perfusion parameters in the macro- and microcirculation. The UPI time-dependent parameters had overall the lowest CVs in both the macro- and microcirculation. The volume-related parameters had poorer repeatability, especially in the microcirculation. Both intra-observer variability and inter-observer variability were low. Although UPI is a promising tool for the bedside measurement of cerebral perfusion, improvement of the technique is required before implementation in routine clinical practice.

Increasing awareness of the adverse long-term effects of repetitive head trauma has raised substantial concern among players, medical professionals, and the general public. Objective: To determine whether low perfusion in specific brain regions on neuroimaging can accurately separate professional football players from healthy controls. Method: A cohort of retired and current NFL players (nâ=â161) were recruited in a longitudinal study starting in 2009 with ongoing interval follow up. A healthy control group (nâ=â124) was separately recruited for comparison. Assessments included medical examinations, neuropsychological tests, and perfusion neuroimaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Perfusion estimates of each scan were quantified using a standard atlas. We hypothesized that hypoperfusion particularly in the orbital frontal, anterior cingulate, anterior temporal, hippocampal, amygdala, insular, caudate, superior/mid occipital, and cerebellar sub-regions alone would reliably separate controls from NFL players. Cerebral perfusion differences were calculated using a one-way ANOVA and diagnostic separation was determined with discriminant and automatic linear regression predictive models. Results: NFL players showed lower cerebral perfusion on average (pâ<â0.01) in 36 brain regions. The discriminant analysis subsequently distinguished NFL players from controls with 90% sensitivity, 86% specificity, and 94% accuracy (95% CI 95-99). Automatic linear modeling achieved similar results. Inclusion of age and clinical co-morbidities did not improve diagnostic classification. Conclusion: Specific brain regions commonly damaged in traumatic brain injury show abnormally low perfusion on SPECT in professional NFL players. These same regions alone can distinguish this group from healthy subjects with high diagnostic accuracy.

Neurologic condition, degree of the brain injury on the basis of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), protein level and pleocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and regional cerebral blood flow on dynamic computed tomography (CT) were assessed. The brain blood flow was measured in the white matter of the frontal and occipital horns of lateral ventricles, symmetrically in both hemispheres. Statistically significant reduction of the brain perfusion in acute phase of illness was improved. In reconvalescent phase normalisation of the brain blood supply was observed. 56% of patients had changes of consciousness. There was no significant correlation between these symptoms and parameters describing blood supply. The rest of patients had neurologic abnormalities: seizure, pyramidal syndrome, injury of the central nerves due to the reduction of blood flow in selected regions of the brain. Patients who aggregated low GCS score had high inflow of the blood. In patients who were in better condition, inflow was smaller. High pleocytosis in CSF was associated with small blood inflow and perfusion in investigated regions of the brain. Whereas high protein concentration correlated with higher inflow and increase in regional perfusion. We consider, that the brain blood supply correlate with intensification of inflammatory response in CSF.\n\nLesional perfusion abnormalities in Leigh disease demonstrated by arterial spin labeling correlate with disease activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nWhitehead, Matthew T; Lee, Bonmyong; Gropman, Andrea\n\n2016-08-01\n\nLeigh disease is a metabolic disorder of the mitochondrial respiratory chain culminating in symmetrical necrotizing lesions in the deep gray nuclei or brainstem. Apart from classic gliotic/necrotic lesions, small-vessel proliferation is also characteristic on histopathology. We have observed lesional hyperperfusion on arterial spin-labeling (ASL) sequence in children with Leigh disease. In this cross-sectional analysis, we evaluated lesional ASL perfusion characteristics in children with Leigh syndrome. We searched the imaging database from an academic children's hospital for \"arterial spin labeling, perfusion, necrosis, lactate, and Leigh\" to build a cohort of children for retrospective analysis. We reviewed each child's medical record to confirm a diagnosis of Leigh disease, excluding exams with artifact, technical limitations, and without ASL images. We evaluated the degree and extent of cerebral blood flow and relationship to brain lesions. Images were compared to normal exams from an aged-matche cohort. The database search yielded 45 exams; 30 were excluded. We evaluated 15 exams from 8 children with Leigh disease and 15 age-matched normal exams. In general, Leigh brain perfusion ranged from hyperintense (n=10) to hypointense (n=5). Necrotic lesions appeared hypointense/hypoperfused. Active lesions with associated restricted diffusion demonstrated hyperperfusion. ASL perfusion patterns differed significantly from those on age-matched normal studies (P=<.0001). Disease activity positively correlated with cerebral deep gray nuclei hyperperfusion (P=0.0037) and lesion grade (P=0.0256). Children with Leigh disease have abnormal perfusion of brain lesions. Hyperperfusion can be found in active brain lesions, possibly associated with small-vessel proliferation characteristic of the disease.\n\nRetrograde and antegrade cerebral perfusion: results in short elective arch reconstructive times.\n\nPubMed\n\nMilewski, Rita Karianna; Pacini, Davide; Moser, G William; Moeller, Patrick; Cowie, Doreen; Szeto, Wilson Y; Woo, Y Joseph; Desai, Nimesh; Di Marco, Luca; Pochettino, Alberto; Di Bartolomeo, Roberto; Bavaria, Joseph E\n\n2010-05-01\n\nDebate remains regarding optimal cerebral circulatory management during relatively noncomplex, short arch reconstructive times. Both retrograde cerebral perfusion with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (RCP/DHCA) and antegrade cerebral perfusion with moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (ACP/MHCA) have emerged as established techniques. The aim of the study was to evaluate perioperative outcomes between antegrade and retrograde cerebral perfusion techniques for elective arch reconstruction times less than 45 minutes. Between 1997 and September 2008, 776 cases from two institutions were reviewed to compare RCP/DHCA and ACP/MHCA perfusion techniques. At the University of Pennsylvania, 682 were treated utilizing RCP/DHCA cerebral protection. At the University of Bologna, 94 were treated with ACP/MHCA and bilateral cerebral perfusion. Mean cerebral ischemic time and visceral ischemic time differed between RCP/DHCA and ACP/MHCA (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed age more than 65 years, atherosclerotic aneurysm, and cross-clamp time as predictors of the composite endpoint of mortality, neurologic event, and acute myocardial infarction. There was no significant difference in permanent neurologic deficit, temporary neurologic dysfunction, or renal failure, between RCP/DHCA and ACP/MHCA. Mortality was comparable across both techniques. Both RCP/DHCA and ACP/MHCA have emerged as effective techniques for selected aortic arch operations with low morbidity and mortality. Univariate analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in primary or secondary outcomes between techniques for aortic reconstruction times less than 45 minutes. Data from this study demonstrate that selective use of either RCP/DHCA or ACP/MHCA provides excellent cerebral and visceral outcomes for elective open aortic surgery with short arch reconstructive times.

The primary challenge unique to aortic arch operations involves interruption of direct perfusion of the brachiocephalic vessels during arch reconstruction. For this reason, neuroprotection is paramount. The 2 main modes of protection are (1) reducing metabolic demand through hypothermia and (2) limiting, or even eliminating, the ischemic period. Preoperative selection of the cerebral perfusion plan for each operation is imperative to maintain maximal diffuse cerebral protection and prevent focal neurologic events.

The accuracy of dynamic scintigraphy in stroke detection during the first week of clinical symptoms was 94% while CT scanning was 60% accurate and static scintigraphy 11% accurate. During the second week the accuracy of CT scanning increased to 100%, but static scintigraphy improved to only 50%. Fifty percent of scintiangiograms performed during the first week showed either luxuriant perfusion or flip-flop patterns. In some patients these two flow patterns changed to that of cerebral hemispheric ischemia after goingmoreÂ Â» through a phase during which perfusion appeared to be equal in the two hemispheres. Dynamic scintigraphy is believed to be the test of choice for stroke detection in children during the first week.Â«Â less\n\nIntravascular perfusion of carbon black ink allows reliable visualization of cerebral vessels.\n\nPubMed\n\nHasan, Mohammad R; Herz, Josephine; Hermann, Dirk M; Doeppner, Thorsten R\n\n2013-01-04\n\nThe anatomical structure of cerebral vessels is a key determinant for brain hemodynamics as well as the severity of injury following ischemic insults. The cerebral vasculature dynamically responds to various pathophysiological states and it exhibits considerable differences between strains and under conditions of genetic manipulations. Essentially, a reliable technique for intracranial vessel staining is essential in order to study the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Until recently, a set of different techniques has been employed to visualize the cerebral vasculature including injection of low viscosity resin, araldite F, gelatin mixed with various dyes (i.e. carmine red, India ink) or latex with or without carbon black. Perfusion of white latex compound through the ascending aorta has been first reported by Coyle and Jokelainen. Maeda et al. have modified the protocol by adding carbon black ink to the latex compound for improved contrast visualization of the vessels after saline perfusion of the brain. However, inefficient perfusion and inadequate filling of the vessels are frequently experienced due to high viscosity of the latex compound. Therefore, we have described a simple and cost-effective technique using a mixture of two commercially available carbon black inks (CB1 and CB2) to visualize the cerebral vasculature in a reproducible manner. We have shown that perfusion with CB1+CB2 in mice results in staining of significantly smaller cerebral vessels at a higher density in comparison to latex perfusion. Here, we describe our protocol to identify the anastomotic points between the anterior (ACA) and middle cerebral arteries (MCA) to study vessel variations in mice with different genetic backgrounds. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our technique in a transient focal cerebral ischemia model in mice by combining CB1+CB2-mediated vessel staining with TTC staining in various degrees of ischemic injuries.\n\nThe impact of age on cerebral perfusion, oxygenation and metabolism during exercise in humans\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBraz, Igor D.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAbstract Age is one of the most important risk factors for dementia and stroke. Examination of the cerebral circulatory responses to acute exercise in the elderly may help to pinpoint the mechanisms by which exercise training can reduce the risk of brain diseases, inform the optimization of exercise training programmes and assist with the identification of ageârelated alterations in cerebral vascular function. During lowâtoâmoderate intensity dynamic exercise, enhanced neuronal activity is accompanied by cerebral perfusion increases of â¼10â30%. Beyond â¼60â70% maximal oxygen uptake, cerebral metabolism remains elevated but perfusion in the anterior portion of the circulation returns towards baseline, substantively because of a hyperventilationâmediated reduction in the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (P aC O2) and cerebral vasoconstriction. Cerebral perfusion is lower in older individuals, both at rest and during incremental dynamic exercise. Nevertheless, the increase in the estimated cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen and the arterialâinternal jugular venous differences for glucose and lactate are similar in young and older individuals exercising at the same relative exercise intensities. Correction for the ageârelated reduction in P aC O2 during exercise by the provision of supplementary CO2 is suggested to remove â¼50% of the difference in cerebral perfusion between young and older individuals. A multitude of candidates could account for the remaining difference, including cerebral atrophy, and enhanced vasoconstrictor and blunted vasodilatory pathways. In summary, ageârelated reductions in cerebral perfusion during exercise are partly associated with a lower P aC O2 in exercising older individuals; nevertheless the cerebral extraction of glucose, lactate and oxygen appear to be preserved.

The perfusion parameters (negative integral (NI), time of arrival (T0), time to peak (TTP), mean transit time, and the difference TTP-T0 were analysed. Three different groups of patients were identified preoperatively: In group 1 seven patients showed an increase in the cerebral perfusion and a clinical improvement after STT. The second group (9 patients) also revealed an increase of the cerebral perfusion, but no significant alteration of the clinical assessment could be found. In the third group neither the cerebral perfusion nor the clinical assessment changed. 14 of the 16 patients (group 1 and 2) were examined three months after shunt placement. 11 patients showed a good or excellent result, 2 patients revealed a fair assessment, and only 1 patient had transiently improved. No patient was downgraded after shunting. In the patient group 1 and 2 the NI increased significantly (effect size: 34%), whereas in group 3 no significant alteration of NI was observed. PWI-MRI improves the prediction of outcome after shunt placement in patients with NPH and can offer new insights into the pathophysiology.\n\nPatterns of postictal cerebral perfusion in idiopathic generalized epilepsy: a multi-delay multi-parametric arterial spin labelling perfusion MRI study.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Guangxiang; Lei, Du; Ren, Jiechuan; Zuo, Panli; Suo, Xueling; Wang, Danny J J; Wang, Meiyun; Zhou, Dong; Gong, Qiyong\n\n2016-07-04\n\nThe cerebral haemodynamic status of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) is a very complicated process. Little attention has been paid to cerebral blood flow (CBF) alterations in IGE detected by arterial spin labelling (ASL) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the selection of an optimal delay time is difficult for single-delay ASL. Multi-delay multi-parametric ASL perfusion MRI overcomes the limitations of single-delay ASL. We applied multi-delay multi-parametric ASL perfusion MRI to investigate the patterns of postictal cerebral perfusion in IGE patients with absence seizures. A total of 21 IGE patients with absence seizures and 24 healthy control subjects were enrolled. IGE patients exhibited prolonged arterial transit time (ATT) in the left superior temporal gyrus. The mean CBF of IGE patients was significantly increased in the left middle temporal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus and left fusiform gyrus. Prolonged ATT in the left superior temporal gyrus was negatively correlated with the age at onset in IGE patients. This study demonstrated that cortical dysfunction in the temporal lobe and fusiform gyrus may be related to epileptic activity in IGE patients with absence seizures. This information can play an important role in elucidating the pathophysiological mechanism of IGE from a cerebral haemodynamic perspective.\n\nComparison of retrograde cerebral perfusion to antegrade cerebral perfusion and hypothermic circulatory arrest in a chronic porcine model.\n\nPubMed\n\nMidulla, P S; Gandsas, A; Sadeghi, A M; Mezrow, C K; Yerlioglu, M E; Wang, W; Wolfe, D; Ergin, M A; Griepp, R B\n\n1994-09-01\n\nRetrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) is a new method of cerebral protection that has been touted as an improvement over hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA). However, RCP has been used clinically for durations and at temperatures that are \"safe\" for HCA alone. This study was designed to compare RCP to HCA and antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) deliberately exceeding \"safe\" limits, in order to determine unequivocally whether RCP provides better cerebral protection than HCA. Four groups of six Yorkshire pigs (20 to 30 kg) were randomly assigned to undergo 90 minutes of RCP, ACP, HCA, or HCA with heads packed in ice (HCA-HP) at an esophageal temperature of 20 degrees C. Arterial, mixed venous and cerebral venous oxygen, glucose and lactate contents; quantitative EEG; were monitored at baseline (37 degrees C); at the end of cooling cardiopulmonary bypass (20 degrees C); during rewarming (30 degrees C); and at two and four hours post intervention. Animals were recovered and were evaluated daily using a quantitative behavioral score (0 to 9). Mean behavioral score was lower in the HCA group than in the other three groups at seven days (HCA 5.8 +/- 1.1; RCP 8.5 +/- 0.2; ACP 9.0 +/- 0.0; HCA-HP 8.5 +/- 0.2, p < 0.05). Recovery of QEEG was better in the ACP group than in all others, but the RCP group had faster EEG recovery than HCA alone, although not better than HCA-HP (HCA 15 +/- 4; RCP 27 +/- 3; ACP 78 +/- 5; HCA-HP 19 +/- 3, p < 0.001). However, histopathological evidence of ischemic injury was present in 5 of 6 HCA animals and also in 4 of 6 of the HCP-HP group, but only in 1 of 6 RCP animals and in none of the ACP group. This study demonstrates that ACP affords the best cerebral protection by all outcome measures, but RCP provides clear improvement compared to HCA.\n\nComparable Cerebral Blood Flow in Both Hemispheres During Regional Cerebral Perfusion in Infant Aortic Arch Surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nRÃ¼ffer, AndrÃ©; Tischer, Philip; MÃ¼nch, Frank; Purbojo, Ariawan; Toka, Okan; Rascher, Wolfgang; Cesnjevar, Robert Anton; JÃ¼ngert, JÃ¶rg\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCerebral protection during aortic arch repair can be provided by regional cerebral perfusion (RCP) through the innominate artery. This study addresses the question of an adequate bilateral blood flow in both hemispheres during RCP. Fourteen infants (median age 11 days [range, 3 to 108]; median weight, 3.6 kg [range, 2.8 to 6.0 kg]) undergoing RCP (flow rate 54 to 60 mL Â· kg -1 Â· min -1 ) were prospectively included. Using combined transfontanellar/transtemporal two- and three-dimensional power/color Doppler sonography, cerebral blood flow intensity in the main cerebral vessels was displayed. Mean time average velocities were measured with combined pulse-wave Doppler in the basilar artery, and both sides of the internal carotid, anterior, and medial cerebral arteries. In addition, bifrontal regional cerebral oximetry (rSO 2 ) was assessed. Comparing both hemispheres, measurements were performed at target temperature (28Â°C) during full-flow total body perfusion (TBP) and RCP. A regular circle of Willis with near-symmetric blood flow intensity to both hemispheres was visualized in all infants during both RCP and TBP. In the left internal carotid artery, blood flow direction was mixed (retrograde, nÂ = 5; antegrade, nÂ = 8) during TBP and retrograde during RCP. Comparison between sides showed comparable cerebral time average velocities and rSO 2 , except for higher time average velocities in the right internal carotid artery (TBP pÂ = 0.019, RCP pÂ = 0.09). Unilateral comparison between perfusion methods revealed significantly higher rSO 2 in the right hemisphere during TBP (82% Â± 9%) compared with RCP (74%Â Â± 11%, pÂ = 0.036). Bilateral assessment of cerebral rSO 2 and time average velocity in the main great cerebral vessels suggests that RCP is associated with near-symmetric blood flow intensity to both hemispheres. Further neurodevelopmental studies are necessary to verify RCP for neuroprotection during aortic arch repair.

Voxel-based morphometry to quantify gray matter concentration and volume. Arterial spin labeling perfusion imaging to quantify cerebral perfusion. Lying supine in a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner in the early afternoon. 19 people with OSA (6 females, 13 males; mean age 56.7 y, range 41-70; mean AHI 18.5, range 5.2-52.8) and 19 controls (13 females, 6 males; mean age: 50.0 y, range 41-81). N/A. There were no differences in regional gray matter concentration or volume between participants with OSA and controls. Neither was there any difference in regional perfusion between controls and people with mild OSA (n = 11). However, compared to controls, participants with moderate-severe OSA (n = 8) had decreased perfusion (while awake) in three clusters. The largest cluster incorporated, bilaterally, the paracingulate gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, and subcallosal cortex, and the left putamen and left frontal orbital cortex. The second cluster was right-lateralized, incorporating the posterior temporal fusiform cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and hippocampus. The third cluster was located in the right thalamus. There is decreased regional perfusion during wakefulness in participants with moderate-severe obstructive sleep apnea, and these are in brain regions which have shown decreased regional gray matter volume in previous studies in people with severe OSA. Thus, we hypothesize that cerebral perfusion changes are evident before (and possibly underlie) future structural changes.

Twenty-two patients with moyamoya disease (9 men and 13 women) with a mean age of 9.3 years (range: 4-22 years) were enrolled in this study. Perfusion MRI was performed by scanning the patients7.5 cm upward from the base of the cerebellum before their being process for post-treatment. The scan led to the acquisition of the following four map images: the cerebral blood volume (CBV), the cerebral blood flow (CBF), the mean transit time (MTT) for the contrast medium, and the time to peak (TTP) for the contrast medium. The lesions were assessed using the CBV, the CBF, the MTT and the TTP maps of perfusion MRI; the MTT and the TTP were measured in the lesion areas, as well as in the normal and the symmetric areas. Perfusion defects were recognizable in all four perfusion MRI maps, and the MTT and the TTP showed a conspicuous delay in the parts where perfusion defects were recognized. The MTT and the TTP images of perfusion MRI reflected a significant correlation between the degrees of stenosis and occlusion in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), as well as the development of collateral vessels. The four perfusion MRI maps could be used to predict the degrees of stenosis and occlusion in the posterior circulation, as well as the development of the collateral vessels, which enabled a hemodynamic evaluation of the parts with perfusion defects. Overall, perfusion MRI is useful for the diagnosis and the treatment of moyamoya disease and can be applied to clinical practice.\n\nCrossed cerebellar diaschisis in patients with acute middle cerebral artery infarction: Occurrence and perfusion characteristics\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSommer, Wieland H; Bollwein, Christine; Thierfelder, Kolja M; Baumann, Alena; Janssen, Hendrik; Ertl-Wagner, Birgit; Reiser, Maximilian F; Plate, Annika; Straube, Andreas\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe aimed to investigate the overall prevalence and possible factors influencing the occurrence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis after acute middle cerebral artery infarction using whole-brain CT perfusion. A total of 156 patients with unilateral hypoperfusion of the middle cerebral artery territory formed the study cohort; 352 patients without hypoperfusion served as controls. We performed blinded reading of different perfusion maps for the presence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis and determined the relative supratentorial and cerebellar perfusion reduction. Moreover, imaging patterns (location and volume of hypoperfusion) and clinical factors (age, sex, time from symptom onset) resulting in crossed cerebellar diaschisis were analysed. Crossed cerebellar diaschisis was detected in 35.3% of the patients with middle cerebral artery infarction. Crossed cerebellar diaschisis was significantly associated with hypoperfusion involving the left hemisphere, the frontal lobe and the thalamus. The degree of the relative supratentorial perfusion reduction was significantly more pronounced in crossed cerebellar diaschisis-positive patients but did not correlate with the relative cerebellar perfusion reduction. Our data suggest that (i) crossed cerebellar diaschisis is a common feature after middle cerebral artery infarction which can robustly be detected using whole-brain CT perfusion, (ii) its occurrence is influenced by location and degree of the supratentorial perfusion reduction rather than infarct volume (iii) other clinical factors (age, sex and time from symptom onset) did not affect the occurrence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis.

However, the commonly used CT/MRI-based methods are time consuming, costly and not applicable to every patient. The bolus perfusion harmonic imaging (BHI) method is an ultrasound imaging technique which makes use of the fact, that ultrasound contrast agents unlike biological tissues resonate at harmonic frequencies. Exploiting this effect, the contrast between perfused and non-perfused areas can be improved. Thus, BHI overcomes the low signal-to-noise ratio of transcranial ultrasound and the high impedance of the skull. By analysing image sequences, visualising the qualitative characteristics of an US contrast agent bolus injection becomes possible. The analysis consists of calculating four perfusion-related parameters, Local Peak Intensity, Time To Peak, Area Under Curve, and Average Rising, from the time/intensity curve and providing them as colour-coded images. For calculating these parameters the fundamental assumption is that image intensity corresponds to contrast agent concentration which in turn shows the perfusion of the corresponding brain region. In a clinical study on patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke it is shown that some of the parameters correlate significantly to the infarction area. Thus, BHI becomes a less time-consuming and inexpensive bedside method for diagnosis of cerebral perfusion deficits.\n\nHyperintense Vessels on T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR in Patients with Acute MCA Stroke: Prediction of Arterial Stenosis and Perfusion Abnormality.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhn, S J; Suh, S H; Lee, K-Y; Kim, J H; Seo, K-D; Lee, S\n\n2015-11-01\n\nFluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense vessels in stroke represent leptomeningeal collateral flow. We presumed that FLAIR hyperintense vessels would be more closely associated with arterial stenosis and perfusion abnormality in ischemic stroke on T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR than on T2-FLAIR. We retrospectively reviewed 35 patients with middle cerebral territorial infarction who underwent MR imaging. FLAIR hyperintense vessel scores were graded according to the number of segments with FLAIR hyperintense vessels in the MCA ASPECTS areas. We compared the predictability of FLAIR hyperintense vessels between T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR and T2-FLAIR for large-artery stenosis. The interagreement between perfusion abnormality and FLAIR hyperintense vessels was assessed. In subgroup analysis (9 patients with MCA horizontal segment occlusion), the association of FLAIR hyperintense vessels with ischemic lesion volume and perfusion abnormality volume was evaluated. FLAIR hyperintense vessel scores were significantly higher on T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR than on T2-FLAIR (3.50 Â± 2.79 versus 1.21 Â± 1.47, P < .01), and the sensitivity for large-artery stenosis was significantly improved on T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR (93% versus 68%, P = .03). FLAIR hyperintense vessels on T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR were more closely associated with perfusion abnormalities than they were on T2-FLAIR (Îº = 0.64 and Îº = 0.27, respectively). In subgroup analysis, FLAIR hyperintense vessels were positively correlated with ischemic lesion volume on T2-FLAIR, while the mismatch of FLAIR hyperintense vessels between the 2 sequences was negatively correlated with ischemic lesion volume (P = .01). In MCA stroke, FLAIR hyperintense vessels were more prominent on T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR compared with T2-FLAIR. In addition, FLAIR hyperintense vessels on T2-PROPELLER-FLAIR have a significantly higher sensitivity for predicting large-artery stenosis than they do on T2-FLAIR. Moreover, the areas showing FLAIR hyperintense vessels on T2-PROPELLER\n\nBrain perfusion abnormalities in Rett syndrome: a qualitative and quantitative SPET study with 99Tc(m)-ECD.\n\nPubMed\n\nBurroni, L; Aucone, A M; Volterrani, D; Hayek, Y; Bertelli, P; Vella, A; Zappella, M; Vattimo, A\n\n1997-06-01\n\nRett syndrome is a progressive neurological paediatric disorder associated with severe mental deficiency, which affects only girls. The aim of this study was to determine if brain blood flow abnormalities detected with 99Tc(m)-ethyl-cysteinate-dimer (99Tc[m]-ECD) single photon emission tomography (SPET) can explain the clinical manifestation and progression of the disease. Qualitative and quantitative global and regional brain blood flow was evaluated in 12 girls with Rett syndrome and compared with an aged-matched reference group of children. In comparison with the reference group, SPET revealed a considerable global reduction in cerebral perfusion in the groups of girls with Rett syndrome. A large statistical difference was noted, which was more evident when comparing the control group with girls with stage IV Rett syndrome than girls with stage III Rett syndrome. The reduction in cerebral perfusion reflects functional disturbance in the brain of children with Rett syndrome. These data confirm that 99Tc(m)-ECD brain SPET is sensitive in detecting hypoperfused areas in girls with Rett syndrome that may be associated with brain atrophy, even when magnetic resonance imaging appears normal.\n\nEvaluation of cerebral oxygenation and perfusion with conversion from an arterial-to-systemic shunt circulation to the bidirectional Glenn circulation in patients with univentricular cardiac abnormalities.\n\nPubMed\n\nBertolizio, Gianluca; DiNardo, James A; Laussen, Peter C; Polito, Angelo; Pigula, Frank A; Zurakowski, David; Kussman, Barry D\n\n2015-02-01\n\nSuperior vena cava pressure after the bidirectional Glenn operation usually is higher than that associated with the preceding shunt-dependent circulation. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the acute elevation in central venous pressure was associated with changes in cerebral oxygenation and perfusion. Single-center prospective, observational cohort study. Academic children's hospital. Infants with single-ventricle lesions and surgically placed systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunts undergoing the bidirectional Glenn operation. Near-infrared spectroscopy and transcranial Doppler sonography were used to measure regional cerebral oxygen saturation and cerebral blood flow velocity. Mean differences in regional cerebral oxygen saturation and cerebral blood flow velocity before anesthetic induction and shortly before hospital discharge were compared using the F-test in repeated measures analysis of variance. In the 24 infants studied, mean cerebral oxygen saturation increased from 49%Â±2% to 57%Â±2% (p = 0.007), mean cerebral blood flow velocity decreased from 57Â±4 cm/s to 47Â±4 cm/s (p = 0.026), and peak systolic cerebral blood flow velocity decreased from 111Â±6 cm/s to 99Â±6 cm/s (p = 0.046) after the bidirectional Glenn operation. Mean central venous pressure was 8Â±2 mmHg postinduction of anesthesia and 14Â±4 mmHg on the first postoperative day and was not associated with a change in cerebral perfusion pressure (p = 0.35). The bidirectional Glenn operation in infants with a shunt-dependent circulation is associated with an improvement in cerebral oxygenation, and the lower cerebral blood flow velocity is likely a response of intact cerebral autoregulation.

A total of 156 patients with unilateral hypoperfusion of the middle cerebral artery territory formed the study cohort; 352 patients without hypoperfusion served as controls. We performed blinded reading of different perfusion maps for the presence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis and determined the relative supratentorial and cerebellar perfusion reduction. Moreover, imaging patterns (location and volume of hypoperfusion) and clinical factors (age, sex, time from symptom onset) resulting in crossed cerebellar diaschisis were analysed. Crossed cerebellar diaschisis was detected in 35.3% of the patients with middle cerebral artery infarction. Crossed cerebellar diaschisis was significantly associated with hypoperfusion involving the left hemisphere, the frontal lobe and the thalamus. The degree of the relative supratentorial perfusion reduction was significantly more pronounced in crossed cerebellar diaschisis-positive patients but did not correlate with the relative cerebellar perfusion reduction. Our data suggest that (i) crossed cerebellar diaschisis is a common feature after middle cerebral artery infarction which can robustly be detected using whole-brain CT perfusion, (ii) its occurrence is influenced by location and degree of the supratentorial perfusion reduction rather than infarct volume (iii) other clinical factors (age, sex and time from symptom onset) did not affect the occurrence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis.

Hypertonic lactate is neuroprotective after experimental brain injury; however, human data are limited. Prospective study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01573507). Academic ICU. Twenty-three brain-injured subjects (13 traumatic brain injury/10 subarachnoid hemorrhage; median age, 59 yr [41-65 yr]; median Glasgow Coma Scale, 6 [3-7]). Three-hour IV infusion of hypertonic lactate (sodium lactate, 1,000 mmol/L; concentration, 30 Âµmol/kg/min) administered 39 hours (26-49âhr) from injury. We examined the effect of hypertonic lactate on cerebral perfusion (using transcranial Doppler) and brain energy metabolism (using cerebral microdialysis). The majority of subjects (13/23 = 57%) had reduced brain glucose availability (baseline pretreatment cerebral microdialysis glucose, < 1 mmol/L) despite normal baseline intracranial pressure (10 [7-15] mm Hg). Hypertonic lactate was associated with increased cerebral microdialysis lactate (+55% [31-80%]) that was paralleled by an increase in middle cerebral artery mean cerebral blood flow velocities (+36% [21-66%]) and a decrease in pulsatility index (-21% [13-26%]; all p < 0.001). Cerebral microdialysis glucose increased above normal range during hypertonic lactate (+42% [30-78%]; p < 0.05); reduced brain glucose availability correlated with a greater improvement of cerebral microdialysis glucose (Spearman r = -0.53; p = 0.009). No significant changes in cerebral perfusion pressure, mean arterial pressure, systemic carbon dioxide, and blood glucose were observed during hypertonic lactate (all p > 0.1). This is the first clinical demonstration that hypertonic lactate resuscitation improves both cerebral perfusion and brain glucose availability after brain injury. These cerebral vascular and metabolic effects appeared related to brain lactate supplementation rather than to systemic effects.\n\nAltered cerebral perfusion in executive, affective, and motor networks during adolescent depression.\n\nPubMed\n\nHo, Tiffany C; Wu, Jing; Shin, David D; Liu, Thomas T; Tapert, Susan F; Yang, Guang; Connolly, Colm G; Frank, Guido K W; Max, Jeffrey E; Wolkowitz, Owen; Eisendrath, Stuart; Hoeft, Fumiko; Banerjee, Dipavo; Hood, Korey; Hendren, Robert L; Paulus, Martin P; Simmons, Alan N; Yang, Tony T\n\n2013-10-01\n\nAlthough substantial literature has reported regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) abnormalities in adults with depression, these studies commonly necessitated the injection of radioisotopes into subjects. The recent development of arterial spin labeling (ASL), however, allows noninvasive measurements of rCBF. Currently, no published ASL studies have examined cerebral perfusion in adolescents with depression. Thus, the aim of the present study wasÂ to examine baseline cerebral perfusion in adolescent depression using a newly developedÂ ASL technique: pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL). A total of 25 medication-naive adolescents (13-17 years of age) diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 26 well-matched control subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Baseline rCBF was measured via a novel PCASL method that optimizes tagging efficiency. Voxel-based whole brain analyses revealed significant frontal, limbic, paralimbic, and cingulate hypoperfusion in the group with depression (pÂ < .05, corrected). Hyperperfusion was also observed within the subcallosal cingulate, putamen, and fusiform gyrus (pÂ < .05, corrected). Similarly, region-of-interest analyses revealed amygdalar and insular hypoperfusion in the group with depression, as well as hyperperfusion in the putamen and superior insula (pÂ < .05, corrected). Adolescents with depression and healthy adolescents appear to differ on rCBF in executive, affective, and motor networks. Dysfunction in these regions may contribute to the cognitive, emotional, and psychomotor symptoms commonly present in adolescent depression. These findings point to possible biomarkers forÂ adolescent depression thatÂ could inform early interventions and treatments, and establishes aÂ methodology forÂ using PCASL to noninvasively measure rCBF in clinical and healthyÂ adolescent populations.

In 30 subjects (18m/12f; ageââ=ââ52ââÂ±ââ1 years), blood flow velocity (BFV) and cerebrovascular conductance (CVC) were measured with transcranial color-coded Doppler (TCCD) at the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was assessed with arterial spin labeled perfusion MRI. BFV and CVC were associated with hippocampus (rââ=ââ0.58 and rââ=ââ0.61, both pââ<ââ0.01) and occipitoparietal (rââ=ââ0.50 and rââ=ââ0.58, both pââ<ââ0.01) CBF. CVC was further associated with posterior cingulate CBF (rââ=ââ0.58 pââ<ââ0.01). Independent of age and sex, BFV and CVC were associated with hippocampus (rââ=ââ0.59 and rââ=ââ0.55, both pââ<ââ0.003) and occipitoparietal (rââ=ââ0.50 and rââ=ââ0.57, both pââ<ââ0.01) CBF. CVC was independently associated with posterior cingulate CBF (rââ=ââ0.38, pââ=ââ0.049). TCCD-measured BFV and CVC of the MCA are indicators of cerebral perfusion to clinically valuable brain regions in healthy middle-aged adults. TCCD may not be a good indicator of blood flow to cerebral white matter.\n\nTissue-Negative Transient Ischemic Attack: Is There a Role for Perfusion MRI?\n\nPubMed\n\nGrams, Raymond W; Kidwell, Chelsea S; Doshi, Amish H; Drake, Kendra; Becker, Jennifer; Coull, Bruce M; Nael, Kambiz\n\n2016-07-01\n\nApproximately 60% of patients with a clinical transient ischemic attack (TIA) do not have DWI evidence of cerebral ischemia. The purpose of this study was to assess the added diagnostic value of perfusion MRI in the evaluation of patients with TIA who have normal DWI findings. The inclusion criteria for this retrospective study were clinical presentation of TIA at admission with a discharge diagnosis of TIA confirmed by a stroke neurologist, MRI including both DWI and perfusion-weighted imaging within 48 hours of symptom onset, and no DWI lesion. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and time to maximum of the residue function (Tmax) maps were evaluated independently by two observers. Multivariate analysis was used to assess perfusion findings; clinical variables; age, blood pressure, clinical symptoms, diabetes (ABCD2) score; duration of TIA; and time between MRI and onset and resolution of symptoms. Fifty-two patients (33 women, 19 men; age range, 20-95 years) met the inclusion criteria. A regional perfusion abnormality was identified on either Tmax or CBF maps of 12 of 52 (23%) patients. Seven (58%) of the patients with perfusion abnormalities had hypoperfused lesions best detected on Tmax maps; the other five had hyperperfusion best detected on CBF maps. In 11 of 12 (92%) patients with abnormal perfusion MRI findings, the regional perfusion deficit correlated with the initial neurologic deficits. Multivariable analysis revealed no significant difference in demographics, ABCD2 scores, or presentation characteristics between patients with and those without perfusion abnormalities. Perfusion MRI that includes Tmax and CBF parametric maps adds diagnostic value by depicting regions with delayed perfusion or postischemic hyperperfusion in approximately one-fourth of TIA patients who have normal DWI findings.\n\nWhole brain CT perfusion deficits using 320-detector-row CT scanner in TIA patients are associated with ABCD2 score.\n\nPubMed\n\nMehta, Bijal K; Mustafa, Ghulam; McMurtray, Aaron; Masud, Mohammed W; Gunukula, Sameer K; Kamal, Haris; Kandel, Amit; Beltagy, Abdelrahman; Li, Ping\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTransient ischemic attacks (TIA) are cerebral ischemic events without infarction. The uses of CT perfusion (CTP) techniques such as cerebral blood volume (CBV), time to peak (TTP), mean transit time (MTT) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) provide real time data about ischemia. It has been shown that CTP changes occur in less sensitive CTP scanners in patients with TIA. Larger detector row CTP (whole brain perfusion studies) may show that CTP abnormalities are more prevalent than previously noted. It is also unclear if these changes are associated with TIA severity. To demonstrate that TIA patients are associated with perfusion deficits using whole brain 320-detector-row CT perfusion, and to determine an association between ABCD2 score and perfusion deficit using whole brain perfusion. We retrospectively reviewed all TIA patients for CTP deficits from 2008-2010. Perfusion imaging was reviewed at admission; and it was determined if a perfusion deficit was present along with vascular territory involved. Of 364 TIA patients, 62 patients had CTP deficits. The largest group of patients had MCA territory involved with 48 of 62 patients (77.42%). The most common perfusion abnormality was increased TTP with 46 patients (74.19%). The ABCD2 score was reviewed in association with perfusion deficit. Increased age >60, severe hypertension (>180/100 mmHg), patients with speech abnormalities, and duration of symptoms >10 min were associated with a perfusion deficit but history of diabetes or minimal/moderate hypertension (140/90-179/99 mmHg) was not. There was no association between motor deficit and perfusion abnormality. Perfusion deficits are found in TIA patients using whole brain CTP and associated with components of the ABCD2 score.\n\n99mTc-ECD brain perfusion SPECT imaging for the assessment of brain perfusion in cerebral palsy (CP) patients with evaluation of the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nAsl, Mina Taghizadeh; Yousefi, Farzaneh; Nemati, Reza; Assadi, Majid\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe present study was carried out to evaluate cerebral perfusion in different types of cerebral palsy (CP) patients. For those patients who underwent hyperbaric oxygen therapy, brain perfusion before and after the therapy was compared. A total of 11 CP patients were enrolled in this study, of which 4 patients underwent oxygen therapy. Before oxygen therapy and at the end of 40 sessions of oxygen treatment, 99mTc-ECD brain perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed , and the results were compared. A total of 11 CP patients, 7 females and 4 males with an age range of 5-27 years participated in the study. In brain SPECT studies, all the patients showed perfusion impairments. The region most significantly involved was the frontal lobe (54.54%), followed by the temporal lobe (27.27%), the occipital lobe (18.18%), the visual cortex (18.18%), the basal ganglia (9.09%), the parietal lobe (9.09%), and the cerebellum (9.09%). Frontal-lobe hypoperfusion was seen in all types of cerebral palsy. Two out of 4 patients (2 males and 2 females) who underwent oxygen therapy revealed certain degree of brain perfusion improvement. This study demonstrated decreased cerebral perfusion in different types of CP patients. The study also showed that hyperbaric oxygen therapy improved cerebral perfusion in a few CP patients. However, it could keep the physiological discussion open and strenghten a link with other areas of neurology in which this approach may have some value.\n\nMRI of plaque characteristics and relationship with downstream perfusion and cerebral infarction in patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery stenosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nLu, Shan-Shan; Ge, Song; Su, Chun-Qiu; Xie, Jun; Mao, Jian; Shi, Hai-Bin; Hong, Xun-Ning\n\n2017-10-30\n\nIntracranial plaque characteristics are associated with stroke events. Differences in plaque features may explain the disconnect between stenosis severity and the presence of ischemic stroke. To investigate the relationship between plaque characteristics and downstream perfusion changes, and their contribution to the occurrence of cerebral infarction beyond luminal stenosis. Case control. Forty-six patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis (with acute cerebral infarction, nâ=â30; without acute cerebral infarction, nâ=â16). 3.0T with 3D turbo spin echo sequence (3D-SPACE). Luminal stenosis grade, plaque features including lesion T 2 and T 1 hyperintense components, plaque enhancement grade, and plaque distribution were assessed. Brain perfusion was evaluated on mean transient time maps based on the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (MTT-ASPECTS). Plaque features, grade of luminal stenosis, and MTT-ASPECTS were compared between two groups. The association between plaque features and MTT-ASPECTS were assessed using Spearman's correlation analysis. Multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to assess the effect of significant variables alone and their combination in determining the occurrence of cerebral infarction. Stronger enhanced plaques were associated with downstream lower MTT-ASPECTS (Pâ=â0.010). Plaque enhancement grade (Pâ=â0.039, odds ratio [OR] 5.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-32) and MTT-ASPECTS (Pâ=â0.003, OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.4-4.7) were associated with a recent cerebral infarction, whereas luminal stenosis grade was not (Pâ=â0.128). The combination of MTT-ASPECTS and plaque enhancement grade provided incremental information beyond luminal stenosis grade alone. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) improved from 0.535 to 0.921 (P < 0.05). Strongly enhanced plaques are associated with a higher likelihood of downstream\n\nOptimized retrograde cerebral perfusion reduces ischemic energy depletion.\n\nPubMed\n\nOda, Teiji; Kimura, Tetsuhiro; Ogata, Yoshitaka; Fujise, Yutaka\n\n2004-01-01\n\nIt has been reported that retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) provides minimal capillary flow; however, the extent to which RCP can provide aerobic metabolic support is unknown. We evaluated whether perfusate composition optimization for RCP would preserve brain energy metabolism during hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) at 20 degrees C in rats. Three types of perfusates were prepared: hemoglobin-free saline, rat red blood cells, and artificial blood substitute (liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin); perfusates were made hypertonic, cooled to 20 degrees C, and oxygenated and CO(2) was administered (pH-stat management). Circulatory arrest was induced in 24 pH-stat-ventilated Wistar rats that had been surface cooled to 20 degrees C; 18 were assigned to the RCP group in which one of the three ( n = 6 each) perfusates was administered via the maxillary vein, and 6 received no perfusion. In two similarly surface-cooled rats (controls), brains were excised when the temperature reached 20 degrees C. After 20 min of RCP or HCA, brains were excised and immediately frozen; brain high-energy phosphates, adenosine, and water content were measured. The liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin perfusate preserved levels of brain tissue adenosine triphosphates and energy charge, but not significantly better than rat red blood cells. Both maintained significantly higher levels than perfusion with oxygenated saline or hypothermic circulatory arrest alone ( P = 0.0419-0.0001), under which regimes high-energy phosphates and energy charge declined to similar low values. RCP with hypertonic solution prevented brain edema. RCP with optimized composition perfusate (pH-stat, hypertonic rat red blood cells or liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin) reduced ischemic energy depletion during 20 min of HCA at 20 degrees C in rats.\n\nA pattern of cerebral perfusion anomalies between Major Depressive Disorder and Hashimoto Thyroiditis\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground This study aims to evaluate relationship between three different clinical conditions: Major Depressive Disorders (MDD), Hashimoto Thyroiditis (HT) and reduction in regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF) in order to explore the possibility that patients with HT and MDD have specific pattern(s) of cerebral perfusion. Methods Design: Analysis of data derived from two separate data banks. Sample: 54 subjects, 32 with HT (29 women, mean age 38.8 Â± 13.9); 22 without HT (19 women, mean age 36.5 Â± 12.25). Assessment: Psychiatric diagnosis was carried out by Simplified Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDIS) using DSM-IV categories; cerebral perfusion was measured by 99 mTc-ECD SPECT. Statistical analysis was done through logistic regression. Results MDD appears to be associated with left frontal hypoperfusion, left temporal hypoperfusion, diffuse hypoperfusion and parietal perfusion asymmetry. A statistically significant association between parietal perfusion asymmetry and MDD was found only in the HT group. Conclusion In HT, MDD is characterized by a parietal flow asymmetry. However, the specificity of rCBF in MDD with HT should be confirmed in a control sample with consideration for other health conditions. Moreover, this should be investigated with a longitudinally designed study in order to determine a possible pathogenic cause. Future studies with a much larger sample size should clarify whether a particular perfusion pattern is associated with a specific course or symptom cluster of MDD.

Clinically useful information?\n\nPubMed\n\nGreisen, Gorm\n\n2014-10-01\n\nThe term 'luxury perfusion' was coined nearly 50 years ago after observation of bright-red blood in the cerebral veins of adults with various brain pathologies. The bright-red blood represents decreased oxygen extraction and hence the perfusion is 'luxurious' compared to oxygen needs. Gradual loss of cellular energy charge during the hours following severe birth asphyxia was observed twenty years later by sequential cranial magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This led to the concept of delayed energy failure that is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptotic cell death. Abnormally increased perfusion and lack of normal cerebral blood flow regulation are also typically present, but whether the perfusion abnormalities at this secondary stage are detrimental, beneficial, or a mere epiphenomenon remains elusive. In contrast, incomplete reoxygenation of the brain during and following resuscitation is likely to compromise outcome. The clinical value of cerebral oximetry in this context can only be examined in a randomised clinical trial. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind proof-of-concept study assessed effects of omega-3 fatty acids on cerebral perfusion in patients with mild cognitive impairment. In thirteen patients (omega:n=5; placebo:n=8) cerebral perfusion was measured before and after 26-weeks intervention within posterior cortical regions using magnetic resonance imaging. There was a medium effect of intervention on cerebral blood flow (Î·2=0.122) and blood volume (Î·2=0.098). The omega group showed an increase in blood flow (mean difference: 0.02 [corresponds to 26.1%], 95% confidence interval:0.00-0.05) and blood volume (mean difference: 0.08 [corresponds to 18.5%], 95% confidence interval:0.01-0.15), which was not observed in the placebo group. These preliminary findings suggest that omega-3 fatty acids supplementation may improve perfusion in cerebral regions typically affected in mild cognitive impairment.Regulation of perfusion may help to maintain brain structure and function and potentially delay conversion to dementia.\n\nMyocardial perfusion abnormalities in asymptomatic patients with systemic lupus erythematosus\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHosenpud, J.D.; Montanaro, A.; Hart, M.V.\n\n1984-08-01\n\nAccelerated coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction in young patients with systemic lupus erythematosus is well documented; however, the prevalence of coronary involvement is unknown. Accordingly, 26 patients with systemic lupus were selected irrespective of previous cardiac history to undergo exercise thallium-201 cardiac scintigraphy. Segmental perfusion abnormalities were present in 10 of the 26 studies (38.5 percent). Five patients had reversible defects suggesting ischemia, four patients had persistent defects consistent with scar, and one patient had both reversible and persistent defects in two areas. There was no correlation between positive thallium results and duration of disease, amount of corticosteroid treatment,moreÂ Â» major organ system involvement or age. Only a history of pericarditis appeared to be associated with positive thallium-201 results (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that segmental myocardial perfusion abnormalities are common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Whether this reflects large-vessel coronary disease or small-vessel abnormalities remains to be determined.Â«Â less\n\nScaling of cerebral blood perfusion in primates and marsupials.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeymour, Roger S; Angove, Sophie E; Snelling, Edward P; Cassey, Phillip\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThe evolution of primates involved increasing body size, brain size and presumably cognitive ability. Cognition is related to neural activity, metabolic rate and rate of blood flow to the cerebral cortex. These parameters are difficult to quantify in living animals. This study shows that it is possible to determine the rate of cortical brain perfusion from the size of the internal carotid artery foramina in skulls of certain mammals, including haplorrhine primates and diprotodont marsupials. We quantify combined blood flow rate in both internal carotid arteries as a proxy of brain metabolism in 34 species of haplorrhine primates (0.116-145â kg body mass) and compare it to the same analysis for 19 species of diprotodont marsupials (0.014-46â kg). Brain volume is related to body mass by essentially the same exponent of 0.70 in both groups. Flow rate increases with haplorrhine brain volume to the 0.95 power, which is significantly higher than the exponent (0.75) expected for most organs according to 'Kleiber's Law'. By comparison, the exponent is 0.73 in marsupials. Thus, the brain perfusion rate increases with body size and brain size much faster in primates than in marsupials. The trajectory of cerebral perfusion in primates is set by the phylogenetically older groups (New and Old World monkeys, lesser apes) and the phylogenetically younger groups (great apes, including humans) fall near the line, with the highest perfusion. This may be associated with disproportionate increases in cortical surface area and mental capacity in the highly social, larger primates. Â© 2015.

Zolpidem is clinically used for the treatment of insomnia. It belongs to the imidazopyridine chemical class and is a non benzodiazepine drug. It illicits its pharmacological action via the GABA receptor system through stimulation of particularly the omega 1 receptors. In this study, the effect of zolpidem on brain perfusion was examined by 99mTc hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime (HMPAO) split dose brain SPECT on four normal baboons and in one baboon with abnormal neurological behaviour. The global and regional brain perfusion was not significantly affected in the normal brains. In some regions of the abnormal baboon brain, however, there was a disproportionate increase in perfusion after zolpidem.\n\nEffects of hyperglycemia and effects of ketosis on cerebral perfusion, cerebral water distribution, and cerebral metabolism.\n\nPubMed\n\nGlaser, Nicole; Ngo, Catherine; Anderson, Steven; Yuen, Natalie; Trifu, Alexandra; O'Donnell, Martha\n\n2012-07-01\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) may cause brain injuries in children. The mechanisms responsible are difficult to elucidate because DKA involves multiple metabolic derangements. We aimed to determine the independent effects of hyperglycemia and ketosis on cerebral metabolism, blood flow, and water distribution. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure ratios of cerebral metabolites (ATP to inorganic phosphate [Pi], phosphocreatine [PCr] to Pi, N-acetyl aspartate [NAA] to creatine [Cr], and lactate to Cr) and diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging to assess cerebral water distribution (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] values) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in three groups of juvenile rats (hyperglycemic, ketotic, and normal control). ATP-to-Pi ratio was reduced in both hyperglycemic and ketotic rats in comparison with controls. PCr-to-Pi ratio was reduced in the ketotic group, and there was a trend toward reduction in the hyperglycemic group. No significant differences were observed in NAA-to-Cr or lactate-to-Cr ratio. Cortical ADC was reduced in both groups (indicating brain cell swelling). Cortical CBF was also reduced in both groups. We conclude that both hyperglycemia and ketosis independently cause reductions in cerebral high-energy phosphates, CBF, and cortical ADC values. These effects may play a role in the pathophysiology of DKA-related brain injury.\n\nThe Transcranial Doppler Sonography for Optimal Monitoring and Optimization of Cerebral Perfusion in Aortic Arch Surgery: A Case Series.\n\nPubMed\n\nGhazy, Tamer; Darwisch, Ayham; Schmidt, Torsten; Nguyen, Phong; Elmihy, Sohaila; Fajfrova, Zuzana; ZickmÃ¼ller, Claudia; Matschke, Klaus; Kappert, Utz\n\n2017-06-16\n\nTo analyze the feasibility and advantages of transcranial doppler sonography (TCD) for monitoring and optimization of selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) in aortic arch surgery. From April 2013 to April 2014, nine patients with extensive aortic pathology underwent surgery under moderate hypothermic cardiac arrest with unilateral antegrade SCP under TCD monitoring in our institution. Adequate sonographic window and visualization of circle of Willis were to be confirmed. Intraoperatively, a cerebral cross-filling of the contralateral cerebral arteries on the unilateral SCP was to be confirmed with TCD. If no cross-filling was confirmed, an optimization of the SCP was performed via increasing cerebral flow and increasing PCO2. If not successful, the SCP was to be switched to bilateral perfusion. Air bubble hits were recorded at the termination of SCP. A sonographic window was confirmed in all patients. Procedural success was 100%. The mean operative time was 298 Â± 89 minutes. Ade"
