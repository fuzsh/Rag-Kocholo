        "text": "This series, dating from 1951 to 2018 and the largest in the collection, alphabetically compiles Dickstein's expansive intellectual output through drafts of books, essays, articles, critical reviews, social commentary, conference papers, and lectures, as well as research notes and clippings. Additionally, these files highlight Dickstein's administrative duties, both at academic institutions and for conferences, seminars, publications, and awards. There is some overlap between materials held in this series and the CUNY Graduate Center files in series IV, as well as in the printed matter in series VII. Files in series I are listed by title, with reviews of other authors' work (and writings about other authors) listed by author last name. Notes and notebooks, reviews of Dickstein's books, and a set of assorted writings and lectures are ordered after the alphabetical listing.\n\nEssays, articles, and critical reviews make up the bulk of the series. These writings, which are frequently annotated and contain accompanying notes, primarily cover literature, film, society, and Judaism. There are also files on six of Dickstein's books: Dancing in the Dark: A Cultural History of the Great Depression; Double Agent: The Critic and Society; Gates of Eden: American Culture in the Sixties; Keats and His Poetry: A Study in Development; Leopards in the Temple: The Transformation of American Fiction, 1945â€“1970; and A Mirror in the Roadway: Literature and the Real World. Galley proofs of Dickstein's books are held in series V, while print copies are held in series VII.\n\nFiles frequently contain letters relating to editing and publication issues, as well as letters from authors in response to Dickstein's criticism or analysis of their work. Of note are letters from Russell Banks, Saul Bellow, Harold Bloom, Malcolm Bradbury, Allen Ginsberg, Lillian Hellman, Cynthia Ozick, Henry Roth, Edward Said, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Diane Trilling, Lionel Trilling, and John Updike, among others. Also notable is more sustained correspondence with fellow academics and literary editors, such as Michael Aeschliman, Daniel Bell, Stanley Burnshaw, Basic Books Inc. editor Erwin Glikes, Jeffrey Peter Hart, Geoffrey H. Hartman, Ken Johnston, Herb Liebowitz of Parnassus: Poetry in Review, Jerome J. McGann, and Paul Zweig. This correspondence concerns their intellectual pursuits as well as their professional and personal activities. Further correspondence is held in series III, while recommendation letters written by Dickstein are found in series IV.\n\nAdditionally, this series contains some material from Dickstein's time at Columbia University and Yale University in the 1960s, including his dissertation proposal with comments by his advisor, Lionel Trilling.\n\nCorrespondence from throughout Dickstein's career comprises this series, which is ordered chronologically from 1960 to 2018. Much of the correspondence is between Dickstein and fellow humanities scholars, including professors in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy; this correspondence concerns various academic endeavors (writing, conference planning, teaching) and discussions of literature and culture. Other correspondents include magazine, journal, and university press editors; grant and fellowship coordinators; and university administrators, particularly from Queens College. There are many drafts of letters and emails Dickstein wrote from the 1990s to the 2000s.\n\nDickstein maintained extended correspondence with Allen N. Fitchen at the University of Chicago Press over the publication of his first book, Keats and his Poetry: A Study in Development, as well as with Barbara Speyer, William Phillips, and Edith Kurzweil at Partisan Review. Other correspondents of note include Gene H. Bell of Williams College, philosopher Marshall Berman, Italian translator Francesco Binni, Jim Bloom of Muhlenberg College, literary agent Georges Borchardt, Daniel Born of Marietta College, Bob Boyers at Bennington College and Skidmore College, Malcolm Bradbury, Ray Carney of Boston University, George Core of the Sewanee Review, Bernard Dick, Philip French of the BBC, Lawyer Martin Margulies, Mike Novak of Saint Mary College in Kansas, Carol Orr at Princeton University Press, Janice Price of Methuen and Company, and Abby Zito of Middlebury College.\n\nAdditional letters, particularly those from prominent authors and critics from outside of Dickstein's immediate intellectual circle, can be found in series I. Letters of recommendation written by Dickstein are held in series IV.\n\nThis series, dating from the 1970s to 2016, collects files relating to Dickstein's tenure at the CUNY Graduate Center. It is arranged into two groups: Course and Teaching Materials; and General Administrative Files. Materials in each group are ordered alphabetically. These files also include some course material for classes taught at Queens College. There may be some overlap between materials held here and those in the Alphabetical Files in series I.\n\nThe Course and Teaching Materials grouping primarily holds syllabi and assignments for classes that Dickstein taught at the Graduate Center. Some course examinations and notes are also contained here, ordered after the alphabetical listing. Also present is a file of assorted syllabi.\n\nGeneral Administrative Files chronicle Dickstein's work to establish the American Studies program, and efforts to locate a new location for the University; and includes materials related to programs and special events hosted by the Graduate Center. This grouping holds a large amount of recommendations written by Dickstein, mostly for students that he taught or mentored. Additionally, there are budget notes, calendars, agendas, and invitations.\n\nThe printed matter in series VII dates from the 1960s to 2018 and contains Dickstein's articles, reviews, and scholarly works; signed articles by other authors; books by Dickstein and other authors; two posters; and programs. This series is arranged alphabetically by file type.\n\nMany of the articles, reviews, and scholarly works mirror those represented in series I. Authors whose articles and books feature in this series include Peter Manning, Irving Howe, Joyce Carol Oates, Stuart Sperry, Norman Mailer, and John Updike. Dickstein's books held here include Dancing in the Dark: A Cultural History of the Great Depression, Gates of Eden: American Culture in the Sixties, and A Mirror in the Roadway: Literature and the Real World, as well as a few books which Dickstein edited. Series I contains drafts of Dickstein's books, and galley proofs for his books are held in series V.\n\nThere are two posters: one for an anniversary celebration of the American Studies department at the CUNY Graduate Center, and the other for an event relating to Dancing in the Dark. The programs are mostly for events Dickstein attended or spoke at; and for events at the CUNY Graduate Center."
