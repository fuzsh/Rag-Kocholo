        "text": "Music\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII had not one but two OSTs released: the main OST and an OST PLUS with extra tracks. There's also a piano collections album and even two vinyl releases. You can find out everything here.\n\nOST\n\nOST PLUS\n\nPiano Collections\n\nVinyl\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII OST\n\nComposer: Masashi Hamauzu\n\nArrangers: Masashi Hamauzu, Mitsuto Suzuki, Ryo Yamazaki, Junya Nakano\n\nCatalog #: SQEX-10183~6\n\nLength: 4:03:26\n\nTracks: 85, on 4 discs\n\nRelease Date: 27 January 2010\n\nIn a Final Fantasy first, the English release of the game had a different theme song: Leona Lewis's \"My Hands\" rather than Sayuri Sugawara's \"Kimi ga Iru Kara.\" Lewis's song does not appear on any official soundtrack, but is on her second album.\n\nPersonally, I really enjoy FFXIII's music — I think it has a really unique sound in the FF series, largely due to Hamauzu's position as composer. While Hamauzu had worked on previous soundtracks in the series (FFX, in particular), I think the FFXIII series is where Hamauzu's work really came to the forefront. Cocoon and Pulse each have a very distinct sound, and though both the game and soundtrack are long, the music is never dull.\n\nDisc One Disc Two\n\nPrelude to FINAL FANTASY XIII\n\nFINAL FANTASY XIII -The Promise-\n\nThe Thirteenth Day\n\nDefiers of Fate\n\nSaber's Edge\n\nThe Hanging Edge\n\nThose For The Purge\n\nThe Warpath Home\n\nThe Pulse Fal'Cie\n\nFace It Later\n\nSnow's Theme\n\nThe Vestige\n\nRagnarok\n\nIn the Sky That Night\n\nPromised Eternity\n\nEternal Love (Short Version)\n\nLake Bresha\n\nThe Pulse L'Cie\n\nEidolons\n\nBlinded by Light\n\nGlory's Fanfare\n\nBattle Results\n\nA Brief Respite\n\nCavalry Theme\n\nEscape\n\nCrash Landing\n\nDaddy's Got The Blues\n\nThe Vile Peaks\n\nLightning's Theme\n\nSazh's Theme\n\nMarch of the Dreadnoughts\n\nThe Gapra Whitewood\n\nTension in the Air\n\nForever Fugitives\n\nThe Sunleth Waterscape\n\nLost Hope\n\nTo Hunt L'Cie\n\nNo Way to Live\n\nSustained by Hate\n\nThe Pulse L'Cie\n\nSerah's Theme\n\nDisc Three Disc Four\n\nCan't Catch a Break\n\nPSICOM\n\nHope's Theme\n\nThis Is Your Home\n\nAtonement\n\nVanille's Theme\n\nThe Final Stage\n\nThe Pompa Sancta\n\nNautilus\n\nChocobos of Cocoon -Chasing Dreams-\n\nFeast of Betrayal\n\nEidolons on Parade\n\nTest of the l'Cie\n\nAll the World Against Us\n\nGame Over\n\nPrimarch Dysley\n\nFighting Fate\n\nSeparate Paths\n\nSetting You Free\n\nDesparate Struggle\n\nMysteries Abound\n\nWill to Fight\n\nFang's Theme\n\nTerra Incognita\n\nThe Archlyte Steppe\n\nChocobos of Pulse\n\nThe Yaschas Massif\n\nMemories of Happier Days\n\nSulyya Springs\n\nTaejin's Tower\n\nDust to Dust\n\nThe Road Home\n\nStart Your Engines\n\nEden Under Siege\n\nThe Cradle Will Fall\n\nBorn Anew\n\nSinful Hope\n\nFabula Nova Crystallis\n\nFINAL FANTASY XIII -Miracles-\n\nFocus\n\nNascent Requiem\n\nDetermination\n\nKimi ga Iru Kara (Long Version)\n\nEnding Credits\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII OST PLUS\n\nComposer: Masashi Hamauzu\n\nArrangers: Masashi Hamauzu, Mitsuto Suzuki, Ryo Yamazaki, Junya Nakano\n\nCatalog #: SQEX-10192\n\nLength: 50:08\n\nTracks: 16, on 1 disc\n\nRelease Date: 26 May 2010\n\nIn recent years, Square Enix has taken to releasing PLUS soundtracks containing tracks that didn't make the cut for the actual soundtrack, were used as bonus tracks in the game or part of DLC, or were part of promotional material. Either they're trying to milk us for money or they realize that I have an undying need to fill my iTunes library with as much FF music as I possibly can. You decide.\n\nPersonally I find this album okay, but not stellar. I really like the instrumental version of \"The Gapra Whitewood,\" and this version of \"Defiers of Fate,\" but aside from those I don't find these versions remarkable enough to stand out from the originals. If you're not wild about FFXIII's music, give it a pass. The FF Wiki has a translation of Hamauzu's liner notes on the tracks.\n\nOST PLUS\n\nPV \"FINAL FANTASY XIII 2007 JFS\"\n\nPV \"FINAL FANTASY XIII 2006 E3\"\n\nM1 No.2 title α Version\n\nM3 No.4 BossA α Version\n\nM306 OPN2 \"Defiers of Fate\" Palamecia Assault Version\n\nHope_PfNer3\n\nM42E \"The Sunleth Waterscape\" Overseas Version\n\nM36A \"The Gapra Whitewood\" Instrumental\n\nM74_2 PRO \"Fighting Fate\" No Chorus Version\n\nM64E \"Chocobos of Cocoon\" English Version\n\nM33 Lightning NW Version\n\nM181 Shugeki2 Prototype\n\nM44B Sazh B+ Prototype\n\nM106 Last Battle Prototype+\n\nM5_2 \"Blinded By Light\" Long Version\n\nM42 \"The Sunleth Waterscape\" Instrumental\n\nPiano Collections: Final Fantasy XIII\n\nComposer: Masashi Hamauzu\n\nArrangers: Masashi Hamauzu\n\nCatalog #: SQEX-10196\n\nLength: 45:09\n\nTracks: 10, on 1 disc\n\nRelease Date: 21 July 2010\n\nJust about every FF game has had a piano album; FFXIII is no different. This particular album was performed by Aki Kuroda, who also performed the FFX Piano Collections album. A sheet music book for this album has been released.\n\nIf you like piano music and FFXIII music, you'll probably enjoy this album. All of the piano collections are great; this one is no different.\n\nPiano Collections\n\nLightning's Theme ~ Blinded By Light\n\nFINAL FANTASY XIII -The Promise- ~ The Sunleth Waterscape\n\nMarch of the Dreadnoughts\n\nThe Gapra Whitewood\n\nNautilus\n\nVanille's Theme ~ Memories of Happier Days ~ The Road Home\n\nNascent Requiem\n\nFang's Theme\n\nReminiscence - Sulyya Springs Motif\n\nPrelude to FINAL FANTASY XIII Full Version\n\nW/F: Music from Final Fantasy XIII\n\nComposer: Masashi Hamauzu\n\nArrangers: Masashi Hamauzu, Mitsuto Suzuki, Ryo Yamazaki, Yoshihisa Hirano\n\nCatalog #: SE-M0001\n\nLength: 32:06\n\nTracks: 8, on 1 vinyl\n\nRelease Date: 26 February 2010\n\nNow here's a unique release. Vinyls are a bygone thing in this day and age, and the idea of a game like FFXIII having its music released on vinyl is almost alien — and yet here it is. It's clearly an experiment, and I don't know how well it sold, but I think it's neat that they gave it a shot.\n\nSide A Side B\n\nNautilus\n\nFang's Theme\n\nThe Sunleth Waterscape\n\nCan't Catch A Break\n\nChocobos of Pulse\n\nDust to Dust\n\nBlinded by Light\n\nRagnarok -Sans Pipe Organ-\n\nW/F:Music from FINAL FANTASY XIII -Gentle Reveries-\n\nComposer: Masashi Hamauzu\n\nArrangers: Masashi Hamauzu, Toshiyuki Oomori, Yoshihisa Hirano, Toru Tabei\n\nCatalog #: SE-M0002\n\nLength: 22:34\n\nTracks: 8, on 1 vinyl\n\nRelease Date: 30 June 2010\n\nSo, months after I put this page together, I discovered that there was actually a second vinyl album released some six months after the first. Interestingly, Square is continuing to put out various albums in their catalog in vinyl. It seems that this brief experiment with FFXIII has paid off for them.\n\nSide A Side B\n\nPrelude to FINAL FANTASY XIII\n\nSaber's Edge\n\nSerah's Theme / Overseas Version\n\nFighting Fate\n\nMarch of the Dreadnoughts\n\nSulyya Springs\n\nThe Yaschas Massif\n\nWill to Fight"
