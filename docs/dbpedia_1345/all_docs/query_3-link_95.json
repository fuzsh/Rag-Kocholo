        "text": "Bridging the gap between MTI's Broadway Junior musicals and a full two-act show, MTI's One-Act Edition makes producing a musical easy and fun!\n\nSimilar to our Broadway Junior model, accredited schools K-9 pay a flat fee of $695.00 and the license lets you perform the show as many times as you like for up to one year.\n\nNon-accredited schools may also license the show by paying standard materials and royalty fees, but there is no age limit for your performers.\n\nThe materials (which are yours to keep regardless of your organization type), consist of 30 Libretto/Vocal Books (script and songs for the actors), a Piano/Vocal Score, an Accompaniment Recording that features the back-up tracks to use in performance, and a Reference Recording that contains the full score performed by an ensemble of actors to help your cast prepare for the show.\n\nDisney's Descendants: The Musical comes with an optional intermission and Entr'acte and can be performed as a two-act musical. The show runs approximately 95-105 minutes without an intermission.\n\nAn 11 piece Orchestration is also available. (See the tab \"Note from the Authors on the Orchestrations\" above)"
