If your game starts freezing: Get that sucker out of your PS3 pronto!\n\nIt's probally too graphically demanding on the ps3's meager 7800GTX 256mb gpu. It overheats, that's why you get freezing. Then when you shut it off from the back of the console, you fry your blue ray lazer. Happens to alot of ppl before as i've remembered, everything from call of duty 4 to gta4. Then you might ask, why doesn't ps3 exclusives freeze? Well it's simply not completely using the gpu. Only for polygons, all those effects are from the cpu, that's why. I mean I was surprised how graphically nice FFXIII looked on the ps3, I thought I was playing a pc game for a second. Also another thing about these games freezing is ppl spend alot of time on it. Call of duty 4's multiplayer, gta4's story campainge, FFXIII grinding. Not good for the gpu, it's best to take breaks and it affects mostly the 60 gig sku for most of these ppl belive it or not. I seen alot of ps3's break from various forums, it's always 90% the 60 gig ps3 sku. Guess what, that happened to me before.\n\nWow, black people play Square games?? Aaaawww I'm just kidding. Anyways, I haven't had any problems and I have a launch PS3. I've played every single major game and some minor games on this system and haven't had any problems. Even with after that update that made the PS3 freeze after playing Uncharted. So, I'm going to take one for the team. I still have my launch PS3. It has been awhile since I played FF XIII because I've already beaten it. I'm gonna pop it in and see what happens. Wish me luck everyone."
