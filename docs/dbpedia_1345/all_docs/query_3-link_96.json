        "text": "Is it possible for a number that was only the second tune in Bond history to win the best song Oscar to be the worst entry in the series? Why, yes, since you ask, it is. It’s not even that it’s a terrible piece of songcraft or production; in the context of a Sam Smith album, it might even be a starkly melodramatic highlight. But it’s a falsetto-dawdling tune that’s deeply and self-consciously in love with its own moroseness, to a level unbecoming of a Bond movie — even a Bond movie as elegiac as the Daniel Craig entries can be. Yes, Adele and Eilish also went with somber ballads for the films that bookend this one, but they didn’t start draining all the sex and danger out of those movies right at the beginning. The 007 franchise needed a sad song or two, but somebody did it better.\n\nYou may intuit in these rankings a preference for the early stuff, but we’ll make an exception for this seminal entry, whose modest attributes tend to be overrated for reasons that have to come down mostly to nostalgia. As the first true pop song written for a Bond film, it merits credit for loosely establishing a tone that would follow in many of the tunes, setting out the spy as more of an inner romantic than his cavalier ways on screen might suggest. But really, it’s pretty colorless, pro forma pop — just the kind of tune that you’d expect to find favor a secret agent who mocked the Beatles in the following film. Monro’s vocal version was embedded within the film, while the opening credits featured an instrumental version made into a medley with two other themes. That was just as well — if this entire recording had introduced the film at the start, we might have a harder time remembering the movie as the classic it is.\n\nThe late Soundgarden singer came up with one of the more polarizing Bond themes of the modern era. The fans of the franchise who hate it really hate it; they think it sullies what by acclamation is thought of as the best Bond film of this century. But it has its champions, and deserves them. Cornell clearly put more thought into connecting the song lyrically with the film than a majority of Bond songwriters have, as line after line makes use of gambling metaphors, all the while painting the spy as God’s lonely man in sacrificing most of what makes us human to carve out his heroic and violent path. Melodically, it’s strong, it rocks, and you know Cornell is going to sing the hell out of it. So what’s not to love? Personally, though it’s hard to argue against a Bond song that picks up the pace amid a historic sea of ballads, “You Know My Name” feels unduly rushed. It’s as if Cornell wrote the song to fit a certain length and then was told the credits sequence was a minute shorter than he thought it was. His tune might have gotten more respect than it has if it’d been produced at a more reasoned. ultimately more resonant pace.\n\nWith Shirley Bassey retired from the series — not necessarily of her own volition, as the franchise continued its focus on big names and chart catnip — the problem remained that the public still wanted to hear Bassey-esque themes. Was there anyone who could similarly deliver those goods who also had a major public profile? The only surprise was that Turner hadn’t turned up in the franchise even sooner. She almost seems to be sneering her way through this suspense ballad, projecting a tough attitude that fit well with the rejiggered direction of the movies. A bigger question was whether Bono and the Edge could effectively write in the tradition of John Barry. The jury remains split on that, all these years later, but I believe they pulled it off. Maybe the only thing keeping the song from being a classic in the canon is how the chorus feels like a brilliant bridge that never quite gets to resolve and explode the way you’d hope.\n\nBassey’s third and last contribution to the series (not counting her legendarily unused recording of “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” for “Thunderball”) didn’t reach the heights of the first two, “Goldfinger” and “Diamonds Are Forever.” Yet it’s still one of the best, most undervalued songs the Bond franchise ever had. It’s a no-brainer that Bassey rhymes with “brassy,” but this isn’t a diva explosion like the previous efforts, which bowled you over with unremitting cynicism as well as world-class lungpower. It’s a song about dreaming of an imagined, desperately sought love that seems less likely by the day to ever arrive, and there’s no more honestly haunting song in the Bond library. Now, what it has to do with a hijacked space shuttle, neither I nor anyone else could tell you, so it is just a little hilarious when Barry and Hal David do manage to work the title word into a random verse. But not so amusing that you should stop crying.\n\nFile this one in the Dept. of Controversial Choices made good… very good. The peasants were revolting when Eilish was first announced as the woman to send Daniel Craig off: Was a then-18-year-old really the delivery system to put us in mind of a Bond who’s sailing, or bleeding, off into the sunset? Yet she and brother Finneas came up with the subtlest Bond theme in its five-decade history, but one not so subtle that Hans Zimmer didn’t have good reason to incorporate into his instrumental music again and again, so much more so than usual that the O’Connell siblings nearly deserve score co-credit. The elements of betrayal — written specifically to emotionally wrap up the 25-minute (!) pre-credits sequence — feel wisened enough in Eilish’s hushed deliver that you want to check her publicity still after the film to make sure she didn’t develop wrinkles writing the song. It’s to their credit that she and Finneas finally gave in to including echoes of the “James Bond Theme” along the way and didn’t think adding that final “spy chord” was as corny as they feared it was, because the song was gloomily strong enough not to be undercut by a bare hint of fun.\n\nNot just one of the great Bond themes, but one of the most finely crafted pop songs ever. Shirley Bassey and the writing team of John Barry and Don Black take the basic joke of “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” and accentuate the material cynicism to a level that suggests the singer has transcended the need for human contact and become a goddess, at one with the mineral. But it’s still one of the sexiest songs ever written, even if she’s seemingly swearing off the need for touch altogether. Maybe that’s because Barry gave this instruction to Black: “Write it as if she’s thinking about a penis.” The Bond producers worried that it was too outrightly “dirty,” even if she was singing about something available at Tiffany’s. Cooler heads prevailed, and the team was able to actually outdo “Goldfinger,” even if it wasn’t the same kind of pop phenomenon. Black’s lyric is pure callous poetry that belies the river of underlying heartbreak that would cause a woman to give up on love and eroticize baubles. And the music — with Barry relying on an eight-note repeating theme to subliminally suggest the eight sides of a diamond — will haunt you in your dreams, even if you haven’t foresworn the touch of another. There’s always still time to join Bassey among the ascended masters of avaricious celibacy.\n\n***\n\nDoes 26 seem like it’s coming up short, given the even greater number of songs some consider part of the realm of Bond music? How about the songs that were only used for end credits sequences, like the contributions by the Pretenders, k.d. lang and Patti LaBelle in the ‘80s and ‘90s? Should we count the Oscar-nominated “The Look of Love” from the Eon-unauthorized 1967 comedy spoof “Casino Royale” — something that would surely be in the top five, if we did? Or Lani Hall crossing the Eon picket line to sing on “Never Say Never Again”? Wouldn’t it be fun to assess how famous rejected songs — Radiohead’s unused “Spectre” theme, Johnny Cash’s “Thunderball,” Alice Cooper’s “Man With the Golden Gun,” Blondie’s “For Your Eyes Only” — stack up against the official canon? And say, does Monty Norman’s “Kingston Calypso,” which oddly made up half the title sequence of “Dr. No” after the introduction of his Bond theme, count?\n\nAlthough it’s fun to pursue all these tributaries, in the end, we went with the 26 songs that appear on the new 2-CD set “The Best Of Bond…James Bond,” which can be considered fairly canonical. Those other songs can all vie another day."
