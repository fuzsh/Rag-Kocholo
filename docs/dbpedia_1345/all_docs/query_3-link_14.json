        "text": "Mesmerising. Exciting. Out of this world.\n\nWho’s on stage?\n\nOur very own orchestra Royal Northern Sinfonia with special guests conductor Eckehard Stier and pianist Mischa Cheung. They blew us away last year with the first Final Symphony concert, we’re thrilled they’re back.\n\nWhat they’re playing\n\nThe atmospheric, hypnotising soundtracks from Final Fantasy V, VIII, IX and XIII. It doesn’t matter if you’ve played all the games or not, it’s beautiful music and it’ll sound lush in our ace acoustics.\n\nHave you ever watched a film or played a video game without the music? It just feels wrong. Soundtracks are timed to perfection, second by second, to match the action, up the drama, bring out the emotions. It’s an incredible skill. The composers for Final Fantasy are the best in the business and their creations sound even better in the concert hall then they do on the game.\n\nYou’ll hear your favourite character themes, epic battle scenes and iconic moments from Final Fantasy games V, VIII, IX and XIII all woven together in new arrangements for orchestra and piano exclusively for this concert."
