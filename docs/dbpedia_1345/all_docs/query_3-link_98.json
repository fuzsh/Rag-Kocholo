        "text": "The music in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate includes a wide variety of tracks. It consists of pieces taken directly from other Nintendo games and games with third-party representation, nearly all of the remixes from previous Super Smash Bros. titles, and brand new arrangements. In total (including DLC), there are 1,068 tracks available to listen to in the Sounds menu, making Ultimate's music library the largest in the series, larger than all the other games' libraries combined.\n\nMusic can be listened to in the game using the Sounds feature. Much like in Brawl and SSB4, the Sounds menu is accessible by default and does not need to be unlocked. However, several tracks must be unlocked themselves via various methods. Others only appear in the list after specific DLC purchases are made, and one song (Dearly Beloved -Swing Version-) requires the player to own a Challenger Pack (11) and have save data from a separate game (Kingdom Hearts Melody of Memory). Note that it can also be added to playlists in the Vault section. Max number of tracks are unlimited.\n\nSuper Smash Bros.[edit]\n\nThe first 5 tracks (from Lifelight (JP) to Final Destination) are listed on top of the Sound Test list, then followed by the Super Mario Bros. series. All the other tracks (Mob Smash onwards) are listed on the bottom, right after the Other category.\n\nTotal Songs: 113\n\nMario[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 91\n\nMario Kart[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 15\n\nDonkey Kong[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 28\n\nThe Legend of Zelda[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 45\n\nMetroid[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 25\n\nYoshi[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 14\n\nKirby[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 38\n\nStar Fox[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 18\n\nPokémon[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 33\n\nF-Zero[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 26\n\nEarthBound[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 14\n\nFire Emblem[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 52\n\nGame & Watch[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 2\n\nKid Icarus[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 13\n\nWario[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 11\n\nPikmin[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 14\n\nAnimal Crossing[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 21\n\nWii Fit[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 10\n\nPunch-Out!![edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 5\n\nXenoblade Chronicles[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 27\n\nSplatoon[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 26\n\nMetal Gear[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 11\n\nSonic[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 20\n\nMega Man[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 31\n\nPAC-MAN[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 11\n\nStreet Fighter[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 38\n\nFINAL FANTASY VII[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 11\n\nBayonetta[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 11\n\nCastlevania[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 34\n\nPersona[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 11\n\nDRAGON QUEST[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 8\n\nBanjo-Kazooie[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 10\n\nFATAL FURY[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 50\n\nARMS[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 18\n\nMinecraft[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 7\n\nTekken[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 39\n\nKINGDOM HEARTS[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 10\n\nOther[edit]\n\nTotal Songs: 107\n\nTracks not listed in Sounds[edit]\n\nThe following tracks are present in the game, but are not listed in the Sounds menu.

This is especially noticeable with the Challenger Packs, which include uncut vocal tracks such as The Edge of Dawn (Seasons of Warfare) (four minutes and 55 seconds) and Advent: One-Winged Angel (just over six minutes, the longest track in the series).\n\nAccording to Masahiro Sakurai, this was because the game's improved compression technology allows for tracks to take only a quarter as much space as they did previously while keeping their original quality.[1] Despite this, the abridged tracks from SSB4 were not reverted to their full-length versions.\n\nHad this compression technique not been invented before release, the music tracks would have not fit onto a Nintendo Switch cartridge and Sakurai considered releasing all the music as free downloadable content.[2]\n\nThe Mario Kart, Wario, Star Fox, Ice Climber, Game & Watch, Kid Icarus, Punch-Out!!, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Bayonetta franchises are the only series from previous games to have not received any new remixes. The Pac-Man series could also be counted if the other new Namco remixes are excluded.\n\nHowever, the Sonic the Hedgehog series' own music style influenced two new remixes made in Ultimate by Sonic's two main composers, Jun Senoue and Tomoya Ohtani, as stated by them on Sonic's official Japanese website.\n\nFinal Fantasy and Xenoblade Chronicles previously lacked new remixes until the release of Sephiroth and Pyra/Mythra, respectively.\n\nOf the aforementioned franchises, Wario, Ice Climber, Game & Watch, Kid Icarus, Punch-Out!!, and Bayonetta are the only series to have received no new music tracks altogether. The Pac-Man series could also be counted if the other new Namco tracks are excluded.\n\nExcluding victory themes, Dragon Quest and Kingdom Hearts are the only series represented by a fighter without any Smash-original remixes in Ultimate.\n\nARMS is the only series to take all of its music from a single source, while it, Final Fantasy, and Kingdom Hearts, are the only series to take all of their music compositions from a single game of origin, as all other single-game universes belong to the \"Other\" category. Prior to Challenger Pack 8, Final Fantasy also held the distinction of all music originating from the same source.\n\nThe Fatal Fury franchise has the most new remixes out of the universes introduced as DLC, with there being 17 total.\n\nAdditionally, Fatal Fury has by far the most music tracks of any third-party series in both Ultimate and the entire series in general, with 50 total.\n\nMEGALOVANIA, Floral Fury, and Burning Town are the only DLC music tracks to be included with a Mii outfit (Sans, Cuphead, and Shantae, respectively).\n\nIncidentally, these are all songs from indie games.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog, with music originating from 16 different games, has the most titles of its own series represented by music of any third-party series in both Ultimate and the series in general.\n\nUltimate is the first Smash game since the original in which none of the new remixes are unlockable.\n\nWith 10 vocal songs, Sonic the Hedgehog has more vocal tracks than any other series in both Ultimate and the series in general.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog, Final Fantasy, and UNDERTALE are the only series in Ultimate and in Smash as a whole to have all of their remixes not owned by Nintendo. Instead, they are owned by Sega, Square Enix, and Toby Fox, respectively.\n\nMetal Gear and Street Fighter also have certain remixes owned by their owners, Konami and Capcom U.S.A., respectively. However, all other remixes from those series are owned by Nintendo."
