        "text": "I was watching some videos of Final Fantasy XII today and one of them mentioned the soundtrack and it hit me i dont remember any of the tracks off the top of my head and ive finished it twice (ps2 and zodiac)\n\nI remember it just being...there? its pretty forgettable imo which is so disappointing-even though X wasnt my favorite, i still remember quite a few tracks.\n\nWhat about you? If you like it, please post your favorite tracks.\n\nI absolutely love FFXII. It's in my top 5 favorite FF's but memorable soundtrack isn't one of them lol. It's too... Star Wars like for my taste. I was hoping it was more like FFT at its original release but... Obviously it wasn't.\n\nHitoshi Sakimoto tends to do OST's that are more like soundscapes than melodies you might hum along to. IMO it has a superb OST but it's not necessarily the sort of thing you'd put on just to sit and listen to.\n\nI would put it somewhere in the middle alongside 9 and 13, I think 6,7,8,10 and 16 are all better.\n\nI have many favorites but these are a couple of lesser mentioned ones I really like\n\nView: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UJtekyK2bKw&t=58s&pp=ygUWZmZ4aWkgbmFsYmluYSBkdW5nZW9ucw%3D%3D\n\nView: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5lvYo4JgyKk&pp=ygUXZmZ4aWkgcGFyYW1pbmEgcmlmdCBvc3Q%3D\n\nI always felt this soundtrack was very good. Very competent work throughout with great use of various instruments and meshes very well with the style of the game. I think it's gotten a bad rap because it is a different style from the more melodic nature of Uematsu, this is more like an extended epic fantasy movie score, also the compressed sound on the PS2 release somewhat damped what the composer was going for but thankfully that has been remedied in the remaster.\n\nIt's a good OST, it's just not in the bombastic Uematsu style that people want or expect from an FF. It made sense for the tone of the story and the setting of Ivalice, and there are a few standouts for me that have already been posted above.\n\nThe hype:\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4XBqsXVNY\n\nProbably not top 5 for me, but it was a great OST. Sakimoto never fails.\n\nThis track made me smile hearing it the first time. It really envokes adventure for me.\n\nLowkey hoping for Sakimoto to compose Dragon Quest XII.\n\nFF12's story is largely uninterested in the kind of emotional peaks and valleys the series is known for, and that attitude extends to the OST. It's more functional and expressive than anything, more like ambiance than a centerpiece.\n\nI quite like it but as noted, if your competition is Uematsu at the height of his powers... good luck.\n\nI put other - a number of memorable tracks, but I don't like it. I've never liked Sakimoto's stuff. Somehow I find every tune grating, like the treble is tuned too high in the mix and the hooks are AI generated to be ear worms but without any emotional resonance. That sounds mean, but it's my genuine unfiltered response to all his stuff ever since I first played tactics on a friend's borrowed PS and had no idea who Sakimoto was.\n\nI think it's pretty great, but it's also made by one of the most consistent composers in terms of their \"sound\", so I think it becomes more \"forgettable\" to folks on some level.\n\nI shamelessly love the FFT, Vagrant Story, etc. OSTs, and XII is just more of that wonderfulness.\n\nI think it's the worst in the series, but like still pretty decent in its own right. That's more a statement of just how ridiculously strong FF soundtracks consistently are. The series just doesn't miss when it comes to OSTs.\n\nOne of my favorite topics! Love XII's soundtrack.\n\nOne of the original trailers for Final Fantasy XII (below) opens with perhaps my favorite little musical phrase from the soundtrack - this beautiful ascending piano bit that plays in a few places, including when Vaan is dreaming of becoming a Sky Pirate and then in the background piece for the Salikawood.\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_9nVzkSONg\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btpvEk4Epi0\n\nAdditionally, that's the Salikawood from the original OST - because as great as the Zodiac Version's OST update is, for some reason it completely messed up the piano accompaniment in Salikawood. While some parts are there, in other parts it's either ridiculously muted or removed entirely.\n\nIt's solid, works in the game, and there are a few standout tracks but overall it's just a little too samey and uninteresting for a Final Fantasy game. But I think it works inside the game just fine. I'll be honest in some ways I don't feel too dissimilar about FF16's soundtrack lol.\n\nIvalice Alliance and all that but it just sounds like a pastiche of Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story. Maybe Hitoshi Sakimoto wasn't right for a Final Fantasy game. Or maybe 7R has the right idea and these massive games should be handled by an equally massive team of composers to keep up the variety and quality. Not everybody can be an Uematsu that could single-handedly crank dozens of absolute classics for every game.\n\nI love the Symphonic Poem tracks that unfortunately have little or nothing to do with the actual game's soundtrack.\n\nView: https://youtu.be/fOoyawxVDJM\n\nIt's... fine? Sort of forgettable compared to a whole bunch of the other soundtracks, but not necessarily bad. There's nothing in there I actively don't like. I think Rabanastre, Clash of Swords, and Flash of Steel are the only 3 songs I'd immediately recognise as being from XII without context though.\n\nPlaying Zodiac age rn and really like the remix soundtrack.\n\nIt's not got the super memorable melodies of Uematsu (nobody has), but it works really well in the game, and the fake star wars music could legit be swapped out for actual star wars tracks and I might not notice.\n\nAlso the title screen theme with Judge Gabranth doing his amano art gigachad pose is such a fucking vibe. I think it's my favorite amano cover illustration by far. It is entirely made by the big brush stroke down the side. It just exudes confidence.\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9HKcgzMWr4\n\nI voted \"decent but forgettable\" but there is no option that matches my thoughts. I think, playing the game, the soundtrack is perfect. It matches the world and mood better than most—games, movies, or otherwise. It's designed to be cinematic. I'd recognize any track as belonging to Ivalice right away.\n\n… but I am not humming these tunes decades afterward like I am with bombing run, battle at the big bridge, etc. There are certain motifs that stick in your head but the rest of it becomes soupy in memory.\n\nI think many of the tracks work in game, and I don't think they're composed bad or anything. They just aren't something I'd remember that much or listen to outside of the game. I feel like it went for the cinematic approach to a soundtrack which is different to most other final fantasys.\n\nFinal Fantasy XII is one of the only games in the mainline series I haven't played but the tracks in Theatrythm have always been a complete bore. I think it's well composed but utterly forgettable. I feel it's a big part of why people think XII feels like Star Wars, XII just has more of a movie soundtrack than a videogame one, with the instrumentalization and complete lack of catchy tunes."
