        "text": "The limited edition comes in a glossy cardboard box measuring about 7.75 inches square and a little less than 2 inches deep. The liner notes are called a \"Visual Book\" and are just a bit smaller than the box and fit inside it. The so-called visual book contains the same messages from composer Masashi Hamauzu, director Motomu Toriyama, and producer Yoshinori Kitase as the ones found in the regular edition. It also most, but not all, of the same game screenshots as the regular edition, in addition to other CGI artwork and color illustrations by Yoshitaka Amano that are not found in the regular edition.\n\nThe music CDs come in a fold-out cardboard case. The tracklist is the same as the regular edition and is printed on the inside flaps. The CD trays are clear plastic with more CGI game scenes underneath them. The lyrics to all the same songs as the regular edition are also printed underneath the CD trays. The lyrics to Sugawara's songs, along with the same profile of her found in the regular edition, are printed on the back inside flap. The CDs slide into a clear plastic slipcase that has the soundtrack name and catalog number printed on it. Also comes with the same merchandise flyer found with the regular edition, and a Square Enix point card. Does NOT come with an obi.\n\nThe bonus CD is an audio drama called \"Episode Zero -Promise-: Story01 -ENCOUNTER-\" in a separate jewel case. It originally comes packaged in a silver foil wrapper, and the actual CD has clear plastic shrinkwrap. The liner notes are called a \"Scenario Book\" that has the audio drama's script in Japanese. The CD tray is clear plastic and the staff and cast credits are printed underneath."
