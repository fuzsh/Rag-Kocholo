        "text": "Final Fantasy Legends: Hikari to Yami no Senshi (Warriors of Light and Darkness) is a relatively unknown entry in the long-running RPG franchise. The game was released episodically for the Japanese i-mode and EZweb distribution platforms in 2010, with iOS and Android ports planned for release in 2012. Upon localization, the game was titled “Final Fantasy Dimensions.” This tale of conflict between good and evil may have taken place on the (really) small screen, but Square Enix saw fit to create a full soundtrack for it. A few tracks were composed by Nobuo Uematsu, but most of the work was handled by Naoshi Mizuta of Final Fantasy XI fame. The result is a surprisingly robust selection of music for a game made with limited hardware, but the compositions aren’t without their shortcomings.\n\nMizuta seems to have found inspiration in Uematsu’s earlier works. “A Cave Fraught with Peril” and “Remote Village” are evocative of Final Fantasy IX with their ponderous melodies that use the flute in various ways. “Face Your Fears” bears a remarkable similarity to Final Fantasy VIII’s “Don’t be Afraid” in its opening moments. I almost expected to hear Quistis snapping her whip as the drums and horns set the mood for battle. The pride and oafishness of dwarves are clearly felt in the deep tuba driving “Dwarf Valley,” which hearkens back to Final Fantasy IV’s underground world. “The Divine Generals” has sinister undertones and shares the same role as FFIV’s “Battle With the Four Fiends,” though it admittedly lacks the same dramatic punch.\n\nThe remaining songs run the gamut from good to bad, with most squarely in the middle. “Shimmering Steel” is a very standard battle theme that has decent energy, but never really picks up; “Nightcutter Blade” is better, but both tracks suffer from repetitive melodies. The latest rendition of the Chocobo theme, “Funk de Chocobo,” is one of the most uninspired tracks on the album. It sounds more like a fan-made MIDI than a professional composition. More memorable songs include “Though You May Be Far Away,” a gentle piano-synth piece that evokes images of raindrop-spotted windows, and “Soaring the Skies,” the signature airship song with an adventurous feeling.\n\nThis soundtrack isn’t essential listening by any means, but it is pleasant enough. Fans of Mizuta’s previous works will notice his style here and appreciate the opportunity to hear more of his compositions. I can recommend this album only to fans of old-school JRPGs and Final Fantasy aficionados. Everyone else will probably move on after a single listen."
