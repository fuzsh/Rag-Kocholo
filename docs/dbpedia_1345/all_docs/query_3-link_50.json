        "text": "The Final Fantasy series has become iconic thanks to the imaginative soundtracks featured in every game in the series. From the iconic victory fanfare at the end of every battle to the Chocobo Mambo, there’s something for everyone in this treasured discography.\n\nFollowing the departure of legendary composer Nobuo Uematsu, many other exceptional composers have gone on to provide amazing soundtracks for each mainline Final Fantasy entry.\n\nSo without further ado, let’s rank the top 10 best soundtracks in the mainline Final Fantasy franchise.\n\n10. Final Fantasy XV\n\nThe latest entry in the franchise, Final Fantasy XV’s ethos of being a ‘fantasy based on reality’ extends to its soundtrack as well, with Yoko Shimomura providing a ton of bossa nova and blues rock-inspired tracks into the mix.\n\nThe tracks work well since most of the journey in FFXI is a massive road trip. And the music certainly cranks up in epicness when it comes to the more poignant points of the story. Overall, it's solid though it pales in comparison to Shimomura’s work on the Kingdom Hearts franchise.\n\n9. Final Fantasy IV\n\nIf anything, Final Fantasy IV’s soundtrack provided a sort of blueprint for the rest of the franchise as it contained an appropriate amount of character themes, villain themes, and iconic battle tracks that kept the player engaged to the story and action.\n\nSince it was the first entry of the franchise on the SNES, it is a little rougher around the edges in its composition, but charming nonetheless. Uematsu was still getting acquainted with SNES’s sound capabilities and did great despite its limitations.\n\n8. Final Fantasy V\n\nComing right after FFIV, Final Fantasy V has a jauntier and livelier soundtrack, befitting the more adventurous heroes in this entry. As such, Uematsu managed to fit in more upbeat tracks on top of his usual, fantasy epics.\n\nThere’s a heavier emphasis on bass in this soundtrack, which can be heard in the main battle theme, as well as the iconic Battle on the Big Bridge. Overall, the soundtrack of Final Fantasy V is underrated, just like the game it's backing.\n\n7. Final Fantasy XIII\n\nSay what you want about Final Fantasy XIII, but no one can deny that its soundtrack is amazing. The battle theme alone should convince anyone that it's a stark departure from the rest of the series, yet a welcome addition to the franchise’s pantheon of battle themes.\n\nMasashi Hamauzu provided a breath of fresh air when it came to the composition of Final Fantasy tracks. His songs are definitely a lot more spacey and influenced by world music, but it is just a solid soundtrack all around.\n\n6. Final Fantasy XII\n\nFinal Fantasy XII is notable for being an almost one-to-one copy of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, with the six main characters having clear similarities with Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and more. This comparison can be extended to the soundtrack as well.\n\nHitoshi Sakamoto’s compositions are clearly inspired by the work of John Williams, featuring massive orchestral sweeps and placing a heavy emphasis on strings and horns for each track. FFXII’s theme song, Kiss Me Good-Bye, also served as the perfect ending track to the adventure.\n\n5. Final Fantasy VII\n\nNow, Final Fantasy VII has some stellar compositions, with the epic One Winged Angel and Aertith’s Theme being fan favourites. But there is a lot to be desired when it comes to the soundtrack’s original form on the PS1. Thankfully, the Remake has reinvigorated these songs.\n\nSimilar to FFIV, this was Uematsu’s first foray into the PS1’s sound capabilities, so it is a mixed bag when it comes to the tracks at hand. That’s not to say it isn’t great: it is probably one of the most iconic soundtracks in the franchise of all time.\n\n4. Final Fantasy VI\n\nAfter two games on the SNES, Uematsu found his groove with Final Fantasy VI. It is a major step up from IV and V, and manages to juggle so many tracks in its repertoire. Not many games can boast a signature track for each of its 14 main characters and the main villain to boot.\n\nThis was also the first Final Fantasy that was not purely stuck in a fantastical world, with more steampunk elements being introduced in this entry. It is also incredible how they managed to create an operatic aria in a 16-bit video game.\n\n3. Final Fantasy IX\n\nKnown throughout the fandom as the ‘definitive’ Final Fantasy experience, Final Fantasy IX’s soundtrack definitely is the most fantastical out of the rest of the series. It features all the hallmarks of the series, with a fun mix of classical, jaunty, and heroic compositions.\n\nThis heavy emphasis on medieval fantasy sounds makes the game stand out even more in the grand scheme of things. The introduction song when you boot up the game, ‘A Place to Call Home’ and the main theme ‘Melodies of Life’, are great samplers to this medieval fantasy sound palette that Uematsu was going for.\n\n2. Final Fantasy X\n\nThere was a moment in time where no gamer could go anywhere on the internet without hearing a song from Final Fantasy X. You’d be hard-pressed to find any JRPG fan who doesn’t recognise the game’s battle theme, opening track Overdrive, and main theme Zanarkand.\n\nFinal Fantasy X was presented as a major leap forward for the franchise, and the same can be said for the soundtrack that was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, Masashi Hamauzu, and Junya Nakano. This coalition of composers created an instant classic.\n\n1. Final Fantasy VIII\n\nThe story of Squall and his friends may not have been the successor that fans were hoping for after FFVII, but the Final Fantasy VIII soundtrack is leagues above the rest of the franchise. With a good mix of genres, this was Nobuo Uematsu at his best.\n\nFrom the bombastic operatic opening of Liberi Fatali, to high energy tracks like The Man with the Machine Gun, there’s not a single boring song in this soundtrack. Final Fantasy VIII was perhaps the most action-packed game in the series when it was released, and the soundtrack similarly had a film-like quality overall."
