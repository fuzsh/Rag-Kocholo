        "text": "Final Fantasy 13âs arrival on Steam brought back many memories of watching my friend, Shane, play the game upon its initial release. I always found Final Fantasy 13 unapproachable, so I had no intention of purchasing it when the PC version showed up either. As an avid Final Fantasy fan of previous installments, however, I couldnât cull the brewing curiosity still lingering four years later. Was thirteen really so bad, or did it just appear so from an outside perspective? I also questioned if $15 and forty or more hours were worth an answer. I ultimately decided no, they were not. Rationality and reason emerged victorious.\n\nThen Final Fantasy 13 arrived in my Steam library as a gift. Shane, who I assume somehow feeds off my pain, saw fit to send it my way and challenge my ennui. I felt I owed it to him, myself, and the entire franchise to give Final Fantasy 13 a fair shake.\n\nI didnât count on Final Fantasy 13 shaking back.\n\nI couldnât anticipate how taxing a game about running down hallways could be on my psyche. Within seconds of the opening, I started jotting down questions I had about the universe, character motivations, geography â anything I couldnât wrap my head around went into this document. As the game went on, these questions kept me alive. I was often asked, by friends and strangers alike, why I continued to play a game Iâd already confessed I got no enjoyment out of playing. Here are my frequent rationalizations:\n\nI have played every core game in the series up until 13. If I complete this, I can maintain my claim Iâve played every main entry.\n\nIf Final Fantasy 13 is truly terrible, I must play it to be able to articulate exactly why, with informed opinions.\n\nThereâs a chance it could improve as it approaches the end, or surprise me with a single powerful scene that makes the entire agonizing experience worth it... (I gave up on number 3 very early.)\n\nThere must be a reason people like this game. Look around the internet, and you will find people who defend this thing, vehemently. With zeal. This makes #2 extremely important.\n\nAs Nietzsche said,\n\nâBut what if pleasure and pain should be so closely connected that he who wants the greatest possible amount of the one must also have the greatest possible amount of the other, that he who wants to experience the \"heavenly high jubilation\" must also be ready to be \"sorrowful unto death\"?\n\nIn other words, Final Fantasy 13 will be my âsorrowful unto deathâ experience, and other games will feel so much sweeter after I endure it.\n\nI spent a long time trying to decide how to approach this article, and decided the best method would be to simply show you my thoughts during playtime.\n\nBelow are all the questions I jotted down during the game. The final document itself exceeded forty agonizing pages. Iâve done my best to eliminate the few questions that were eventually answered, or any repeats of previous thoughts. Iâve also done my best to rephrase any questions to make them understandable to someone who hasnât waded waist-deep into Final Fantasy 13âs briar patch of a story, but I eventually realized it was a foolâs task. Making sense of Final Fantasy 13âs insane lore isâ¦ you know what? Nevermind. I trust the problem will become clear soon.\n\nDoes Square Enix know most PC games usually have a resolution option? Someone should tell them there are more video options than subtitles and what kind of on-screen button prompts to use.\n\nDoes the fact I need to manually change from PC button prompts to controller button prompts mean the game canât tell when Iâve unplugged a controller?\n\nWhat are these people talking about? Lâcie, FalâCieâ¦ are these some kind of berry? A fruit snack?\n\nWhy make a combat system where positioning on the battlefield is important, and then give the player no agency over their movement? Everyone just shuffles around the battlefield like they just got off the teacup ride at Disneyland.\n\nWill I eventually learn how to do things other then press A?\n\nWhy do these people who clearly know everything about what happens to Lâcie and Falâcie keep repeating to each other what they already know? Are they afraid theyâll forget? Are people in this world prone to late onset amnesia, and need constant reminders to stave it off?\n\nWhy is Lightningâs only response to any question to walk away and brood toward the camera?\n\nWho is Vanille? Why is she convincing this grieving boy to steal a cyber-bike? Is Vanille an alien?\n\nDid these characters forget how to have a conversation?\n\nWhy does Serah call Snow a âheroâ? He just got a ton of people killed. She knows heâs about to fail at saving her from a crystallized fate too, so is she just trying to give him a crippling inferiority complex? Did she mean it ironically? Like, âOh good, my hero is here. Great.â\n\nWhy does anybody trust Lightning enough to follow her into this room? She tried to abandon Sazh only minutes ago, sheâs a huge jerk to Snow, and everyone else has just met her.\n\nWhy is Snow bowing down to the Falâcie? I donât understand anything about this universe yet, and even I know itâs a very poor plan.\n\nI understand why Snow and Lightning are taking up arms against the evil armored God berry, but why is everyone else? Sazh mutters a name under his breath. Maybe heâs harboring some secret vendetta I donât know about yet. But didnât Hope just come here just to... accuse Snow of killing his Mom? And Vanille isâ¦ well, being Vanille.\n\nAmâ¦ am I fighting the final boss at the start of the game?\n\nAfter proposing to Serah, Snow says he canât wait to see Lightningâs face. Why? Does he think this proposal will finally thaw her icy heart? Or cause it grow three sizes?\n\n...has Snow confused Lightning for the Grinch?\n\nWhy is Snow driving his flying motorbike into fireworks with his unsecured fiancÃ© in his lap?\n\nAfter a firework hits the motorbike in one of the most predictable accidents ever, Serahâs response is to share a laugh with Snow. Shouldnât she be simultaneously screaming and slapping him for endangering her life in the dumbest possible way?\n\nOr are the characters aware theyâre protagonists, and therefore need not feel any sense of danger until the plot calls for it?\n\nWhy is Snow three times taller than everyone else? Actually, how was Serah able to kiss him without a step ladder strapped to her side at all times?\n\nThis game will explain how the death of a Falâcie can turn an entire ocean to crystal, right? I mean, it looks beautiful, but Iâm very confused about how water and fire become instantaneously crystallized while stone, debris, save points, and people do not. (The game does not ever explain this.)\n\nWhy is there an option to switch my party members, but if I select it Iâm told âYou cannot switch party members at this timeâ? Why even have the option appear if itâs just going to taunt the player for the next twenty hours?\n\nWill I ever get to switch party members?\n\nOn that note, will I have an objective other than âwalk straight ahead until next cutsceneâ?\n\nWe just saw how Serah completed her focus and turned into a crystal. Why would we all immediately try to figure out and complete our focus? Why would anyone, in the history of this universe, seek out their focus when the reward is to become a new Edward Scissorhands ice sculpture?\n\nThe Falâcie communicate through hazy visions? Why? Do they want their instructions to be misinterpreted? It seems like a recklessly unnecessary risk, sending instructions in the form of a Ring-style hallucination. Maybe they canât talk. (As I discovered later, they can and do.)\n\nDoâ¦ do Lâcie marks scrub out? Like Henna? Maybe this isnât so serious, guys.\n\nDidnât the Falâcie just die? Doesnât that mean weâre free of any risk? Or does the Falâcie not need to be alive to enforce punishment? Is it more like a rattlesnake bite?\n\nWhy does Snow insist everyone should stay together, but then immediately abandon the party to try and dig a crystallized Serah out of the snow?\n\nThe previous question smacks a little of victim blaming. Sorry, Snow. The real question is, why does Lightning encourage everyone to abandon a desperate Snow?\n\nWhile I agree with Lightning that Snowâs priorities are out of whack, punching him twice in the face was maybe an extreme of a way to express it. Snow made no aggressive movements towards Lightning. When the next punch came, he just let it happen. He accepted it. This scene is textbook abuse. In the next cutscene Snow needs to call a hotline.\n\nIsâ¦ is everyone really just going to leave Snow here? Alone? Knowing an army is on the way?\n\nNow Snow is back to trying to dig Serah out with a gun. Snow is an idiot. This isnât a question, it just bothers me.\n\nHow did everyone know who to split up with? Did they discuss it off-screen?\n\nDoes this âhover motorcycleâ need wheels on it? Is that necessary?\n\nWhy canât Hope say the word âmomâ? Instead he always trails off with a ââ¦â in the subtitles.\n\nWhy is it âgame overâ if Lightningâs health is reduced to 0? Do the others not know how to continue fighting without her leadership? In what way has Lightning demonstrated sheâs leadership material? If anything, they might be better off without her.\n\nThe game is eventually going to explain why two ice women suddenly attacked Snow, right? And how he was able to absorb them into his body?\n\nSo Sazhâs initial reaction to seeing Lâcie Serah was to offer his gun to Lightning, and suggest putting her out of her misery. Hereâs a million soldiers who see Snow is a Lâcie, but they wonât shoot him. Why? Doâ¦ do they see the camera behind him? Did they see it and say to themselves, âDamn, heâs a player character! Canât kill this one.â\n\nDoes Lightning actually know how to drive one of these ships, or is she just being a terrible backseat driver to Sazh?\n\nIâve been playing this game for eight hours. How are we still introducing exposition about the world? Who is this Space Pope?\n\nShouldnât the fact five people just killed a God and crystallized the ocean be making the news too?\n\nThank god there was a lull in the gunfire during this dogfight so we could check the local news.\n\nWhy is Lightning abandoning the party after a near-death plane crash? Actually, better question: how is no one injured?\n\nLightning ran a âcouple missionsâ here and thatâs why she knows the way. Thatâs fine, I guess, but what kind of missions took place in a Junkyard? Were there dangerous Junkyard monsters that needed to be put down?\n\nActually, Lightning was in the Guardian Corps, soâ¦ did the Junkyard Monsters need guarding? Was there a Junkyard monster diplomat who needed protection during a peace meeting?\n\nLightning explains the difference between PSICOM and the Guardian Corps by clarifying there are, in fact, two branches of the military. This fails to explain why theyâre split and what their relative goals are. This would be like answering a question about the difference between the Marines and the Army by saying, âWell see, thereâs the Army and then thereâs the Marines.â\n\nThe ambient crowd chatter at the start of this train cutscene is highly inappropriate.\n\nIf the PSICOM soldiers shot a group of civilians right outside the Botan death train, would anyone actually get on it? Wouldnât they just panic and run?\n\nCan you âquitâ being a soldier the same way you can âquitâ an at-will job? I feel like no one in the military would go AWOL if this was the case.\n\nHow did Lightning know she wouldnât be arrested for insubordination and detained in the town, thus ruining her entire plan? Seems to me dressing as one of the robed figures wouldâve been a better plan, or trying to sneak onto the train from a different platform.\n\nHope is surprised when Lightning abandons him. By now shouldnât everyone be expecting it? Aside from punching Snow, itâs kind of the only thing sheâs done all game.\n\nOn that note, Lightning is the worst soldier ever. At the first sign of any trouble, she leaves everyone behind. Unless she apologizes later in the game for how many times sheâs almost gotten everyone killed, Iâm convinced sheâs a sociopath.\n\nWaitâ¦ where are we even going!? Cocoon? The Bahamas? Iâve no idea what goal these people are trying to reach.\n\nSo everybody attended the same fireworks display on the same night in the same town? And no one else saw Snow almost kill Serah by flying straight into a firework? If Lightning saw that display of stupidity, Iâd understand her hatred toward Snow.\n\nHope is a jerk to his mother.\n\nWhy does auto-battle exist if itâs just going to pick 3 random, non-optimal abilities?\n\nIâve now collected almost 100 crafting items. When do I use these? How do I use them? (No sooner did I jot down this note when crafting became available.)\n\nCrafting unlocked, but why are there uniquely named crafting materials when they can all be applied for the same XP amount to any item? Why does a âquality boneâ work just as well for a pair of guns as it does for a bangle?\n\nLightning talks about fighting the other Falâcie, because apparently thereâs more of them. Thatâs great! This is the first time Iâve liked Lightning the whole game! Then Szah says, âjust like that, youâre going to take on a Falâcie?â I donât know why this is a surprise to him; we just killed one earlier today. In their universe, Iâd estimate it was about six hours ago they all felled a god in jolly cooperation.\n\nWhy do we keep splitting the party further and further?\n\nWhy did a giant floating man, clad in armor, just pop out of Lightning and assault Hope?\n\nIs Lightning made of anything other than legs and torso? Itâs been bothering me all game.\n\nNo obligations, rules, or authority? That is a great name for a punk band, and an awful one for a resistance group. ACRONYMS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY, NORA.\n\nIâve had this problem with video game plots for a long time, but lets take a minute and unpack the concept of a bio-organic weapon. How does a bio-engineered dog work better than a gun in any combat situation? In a world with missiles, magic, and machine guns, how does experimenting on living organisms give the military any feasible edge? Even if your bio-organic super weapon is capable of amazing feats, it does no good if itâs made out of organic tissue susceptible to bullets.\n\nUnder no circumstances should Hope dying be Game Over. If anything, someone should throw a party.\n\nâIs it the Lâcie thing? Is it Snow?â Fuck you, Lightning. How would you know Hope hates Snow? He hasnât even told you about how Snow dropped his mom off a bridge. Did you read the script?\n\nâYou and I are partners.â Fuck you again, Lightning! No matter how stupid Hope is, he doesnât deserve to be manipulated by you. We both know youâll abandon him two cutscenes from now.\n\nYouâre right, Lightning. Donât discourage this boy from killing a man. In fact, encourage it and further implicate yourself by handing him the murder weapon.\n\nA cutscene just played where Lightning tells her Sister sheâll kill her because sheâs a Lâcie. I get it. Finally get it. Lightning is the antagonist. The Lâcie are the heroes.\n\nOh my God. Iâm experiencing a revelatory sensation of clarity. The entirety of Final Fantasy 13 suddenly makes perfect sense. Lightning is actually a tragic hero, driven to killing gods out of a misplaced anger towards her sister, and her inability to change her fate. (Ends up my revelation didnât last, but I still think it wouldâve made a stronger story.)\n\nWhy would Hope adopt âoperation NORAâ as a code name? Isnât Snowâs ridiculous NORA resistance group the very thing that got his mother killed? Wouldnât he name it literally anything else? How about âOperation Kill Snowâ?\n\nHope just explained this by saying his motherâs name was Nora. The improbability of this fact and the mere idea the game is asking me to accept it without doubt wounds me somewhere deep in the core of my being.\n\nThe Guardian Corps is hunting the Lâcie, so they recruit a Lâcie? This only makes sense if the Guardian Corps have a fundamental misunderstanding of how being a Lâcie works, an understanding that is borderline racist. âAll Lâcie know each other!â\n\nVanille and Sazh head in the opposite direction of warships flying overhead. This is the first decision Iâve agreed with all game. At first I contemplated complaining about how this doesnât advance their goals, but I have no idea what their goals are, so why worry?\n\nThe Sunleth Waterscape has amazing music. Itâs refreshing.\n\nSazh keeps calling himself âold manâ. How old is he, 35? I get it, actually; in a Final Fantasy game, thatâs ancient. (Iâve since looked up his age; itâs actually 40.)\n\nSazh was at the horrid fireworks display too?\n\nDoes Final Fantasy 13 take place in a universe powered by unlikely coincidences? Is this plot powered by the improbability drive?\n\nDajh is the most horrifying attempt at a child ever programmed.\n\nWhy can nobody walk into a clearing without falling asleep?\n\nA Godâs only method of defense was to brand an eight year old boy to fight for it? Why does anyone worship these gods again?\n\nWhy is everyone on the run heading to major cities? Arenât those places where theyâre guaranteed to be caught?\n\nHere we sneak into the tunnel system Hope used all the time as a kid, but when asked where it empties out he replies âI donât really know for sureâ. How is that possible? How often did you use these again?\n\nHereâs a crazy thought: when youâre a fugitive, maybe donât hide in your own home. (This plan might work, actually. PSICOM wonât even bother to stake it out, because nobody would be so stupid as to hide out in their own home.)\n\nâI wonât abandon youâ is the most unbelievable thing Lightning has ever said.\n\nLightning acts like itâs a big revelation the Falâcie think of them as pets. How exactly is that any different than what she thought before? Earlier she talked about people being nothing but tools to them. If anything, âpetâ is an improvement.\n\nHow do the Falâcie feed an entire population? Do they wish it into existence? Is it magic? Technology?\n\nI think Iâve finally reached the point in the game where Lightning realizes sheâs an awful and boring person. A shame she canât ever fix the second one.\n\nWhat exactly was Lightning trying to accomplish when she ran away from Snow and Hope here? Did she just see a chance to abandon everyone and took it? Then she ran into Fang and had to pretend to care again? I know she didnât have an agenda of her own, because after running into Fang she immediately calls Snow and sets up a rendezvous point at Hopeâs totally safe house.\n\nWow, Iâve come a long way. Earlier, I wouldâve wondered how the game expects me to accept all the characters escaped this impossible situation. Now I realize these cutscenes only exist to split my party and screw with my paradigms.\n\nDo it Hope. Do it. Stab him in the back. Stab him right in his stupid magic trenchcoat.\n\nFangâs phone line is âhyper-encryptedâ. Is that better than super encryption?\n\nLightning has an entire phone conversation with Snow about where to go, but waits until the line starts to fade out to warn him Hope plans on stabbing him.\n\nWhatâs causing interference to a hyper-encrypted line? I hear those things are super secure.\n\nWhy are the jetpack enemies hovering at punching height to attack us? Why donât they just hover 30 feet over our heads and shoot us?\n\nâWeâll walk from here,â says Snow, because thatâs so different from what weâve done so far.\n\nHope is terrible at killing people.\n\nPotential for interesting character development is ruined by missiles.\n\nFang explains that a Falâcie brand actually changes to reflect how much time a person has to complete a focus. Lightning hunted Lâcie for a living. Shouldnât she know this?\n\nAfter twenty hours of gameplay, shouldnât I know this? From someone? Anyone?\n\nDid a language algorithm bot write this gameâs script?\n\nFang says âitâs all in the wristâ while attacking with her spear. I have very limited knowledge of proper spear and polearm handling, and even I know thatâs a good way to fracture your wrist.\n\nThe paradigm system is one of the few ways I actually get to make choices; why am I not allowed to customize my options before most boss fights with reassigned party members? Why are the predesignated, randomly assigned paradigms useless?\n\nI spend every boss fight hoping my allies wonât wander aimlessly into one another and all get hit by the same attack. Then I keep re-trying the boss fight until they donât do that, and then I win. Thatâ¦ canât be by design, right?\n\nI feel like the characters Iâm not controlling should know to use lightning (the spell, not the person) over and over on the thing weak against lightning, right? When they throw in the occasional water and air attack to amuse themselves, I just want to die.\n\nFirst, Lightning hugging Hope looks like a robot trying to simulate a hug based on a synopsis it once read of a Full House episode. Second, is this supposed to be character development? Am I supposed to be happy because Lightning realized abandoning a child in a junkyard is wrong?\n\nIn V.O., Vanille tries to make heading to Hopeâs home sound like a smart idea. Yes, Vanille, home is a nice thing to have, but only when half the world isnât trying to shoot you on sight.\n\nWhy does going to Hopeâs house actually work? How are these homes not under constant surveillance?\n\nThis entire game is starting to feel like a âwhoâs on firstâ routine.\n\nHopeâs Dad is Harry Mason from Silent Hill: Shattered Memories.\n\nReally? No one is going to sit in the room with Hope while he tells his dad about how momâs dead? Theyâre just gonna go right up to his bedroom, not even say hello?\n\nWhy have this door open at all if I canât walk through it? I canât even make the characters be polite about this.\n\nSnow should be at least a little upset Lightning gave Hope a weapon just to see if heâd kill him. At least a little bit, right? Are we really not going to discuss that at all?\n\nFang turns on the TV in Hopeâs house, like she lives there or something.\n\nThe TV man talks about an âall out assaultâ to find the Lâcie. Hunting Lâcie is the only thing they do. It wasnât an all out assault before?\n\nLightning finally apologizes at the eighteen hour mark, but only to Snow.\n\nHopeâs dad is embarrassed by Snow when he apologizes for killing his wife. Snowâs flop-on-the-ground-and-yell approach to apologies is so awful I can feel the embarrassment in the room.\n\nEveryone sits around Hopeâs house making wildly unsubstantiated assumptions about what the populace will do. (It ends up all these guesses mean nothing too, since the party will soon end up on a different planet entirely.)\n\nHope says âcoming here was a bad ideaâ right as the shock troopers cut the power. Oh, sure. NOW itâs a bad idea.\n\nWhy did it take them all day to find us? Because we needed time to have that talk? They read the script, and saw they werenât allowed to show up until Snowâs emotional moment was over?\n\nThis game is going to kill me. The plot holes are compounding upon one another.\n\nNothing says âIâm a bad guyâ quite like background music with latin vocals.\n\nWait, so a smoke grenade caused all the soldiers to start firing on their own people?\n\nNo wonder no oneâs afraid of being caught; the military is run by the three stooges.\n\nNautilus is the first town Iâve been to that, while still a hallway, is cleverly disguised to not resemble one.\n\nIâm now watching a parade about the war between Cocoon and Pulse. Shouldnât this be a thing I know about by now?\n\nIn fact, I feel like we couldâve started the story right here, at this parade, via flashback with a Vanille voice over. Iâd know a lot more about the history of this world, and I might actually understand all the Falâcie/Lâcie nonsense.\n\nThis is getting absurd. Prior to Nautilus, the game at least pretended we were doing more than faffing about.\n\nThe plot of this chapter is âtwo fugitives wander around aimlessly.â That isnât me making fun of the chapter; that is a direct quote from the loading screen.\n\nFor an amusement park, thereâs not an awful lot of amusement. Chasing a baby chocobo doesnât count.\n\nWhy make me play hide and seek with a Chocobo, but show a cutscene where I can see exactly where he hides?\n\nFrom the same franchise that brought you the Golden Saucer comes the thrilling game, âfind the baby chocobo who floats three feet in front of youâ.\n\nSazh is the best character in this game. Yes, Iâve been down on this whole thing, but I mean this one with sincerity. Sazh confesses heâs going to turn himself in, just so he can see his son one last time before Lâcie bullshit happens. This is the only choice anyoneâs made I completely understand. Itâs too bad the moment is immediately ruined when PSICOM shows up and starts shooting at us.\n\nVanille picked this stupid thing up at the start of the game and swung it around like sheâd never seen it before. Soâ¦ she actually had one in the past too? Did she plant it there? Didâ¦ did she âpretendâ to find it to try and impress Hope?\n\nSo the militaryâs plan is to make Sazh hate Vanille so much theyâ¦ kill each other? Why not just shoot them both right now? Who runs this operation? Not everything needs to be a scheme, you know.\n\nSo Eidolonâs just show up whenever a Lâcie feels down? That has to be inconvenient. What if my coffee maker broke and I got disappointed about it? Would an Eidolon suddenly crash through my roof and wreck the house?\n\nSo after beating the Eidolon that turns into a car, we promptly... donât use it? for anything? Thereâs only one way into the room. They could pile in the car and speed right out of this amusement park. At least Snow got his Shiva sisters acknowledged outside of a cutscene.\n\nSo Sazh is being transported in this coffin thing, either because they thought he died from not shooting himself in the head, or because they had it lying around and wanted to get some use out of it. Either way this makes no sense. This scene only exists to trick the player into thinking Sazh killed himself, but makes no sense in the actual context of the game.\n\nSo the Guardian Corps are rebelling against PSICOM? Arenât they two branches of the same military? Wouldnât that be like the Marines and the Navy going to war?\n\nWhy exactly is everyone mounting a rescue for Sazh and Vanille? I can see Fang rescuing Vanille, but no one knows a thing about Sazh. (Lightning might, if she hadnât abandoned him twice in an hour.)\n\nWhy is Lightning being addressed as âSergeant Farronâ? She âquitâ days ago. Also you mean to tell me the lifeless robot known as Lightning managed to reach the rank of Sergeant?\n\nSnow is here with us, but I canât put him in the party. I guess heâs just along for the ride?\n\nOne of FF13âs favorite games is to throw you into battle after a cutscene with a new party and entirely new Paradigms it randomized into existence. This is marginally less annoying than a child playing the âwhy?â game.\n\nI feel like we should be facing much more opposition than 6 guards in the hangar bay during our initial assault.\n\nâSomething badâs waiting for usâ, says Lightning as we assault the entire enemy fleet. When you fight the entire enemy fleet, itâs a very predictable kind of bad, Lightning.\n\nTwo guards and a drone enter the room. Sazh takes out one, Vanille shoots the droneâ¦ and the other just disappears? Or am I supposed to think the baby chocobo took one out on itâs own? Wh... what did it do? Peck him to death? Through armor and a face shield?\n\nIs this color code thing supposed to be making fun of the terror alert? Or is it a thing thatâs, like, umâ¦. stupid?\n\nThis game isnât going to beat itself; someone has to press A every once in a while.\n\nI donât know a lot about planes, but Iâm pretty sure you canât just stand in a place like this:\n\nVanilleâs âgrab a flying creature out of the airâ technique couldâve come in handy a few times before now.\n\nDid Fang just stab this thing sheâs trying to tame through the head? I donât think horse trainers impale their mounts to make them behave.\n\nAt 27 hours in, I can finally change my party.\n\nI reject the notion this game opens up now. The truth is youâre so starved for any freedom, the slightest amount of agency feels empowering. (I wrote this because Iâd been told frequently the game would âopen upâ after 20 hours. At this point, Iâd not actually reached Gran Pulse, the area where people actually think the game opens up. As youâll discover, the sentiment remains the same once we get there, too.)\n\nThis âmillion-staircases-powered-by-individual-panelsâ room is absurd. It must take any soldiers stationed in this area three hours to reach the mess hall.\n\nWhy is the Space Pope killing all his own people?\n\nSpace Pope turned into Space Pope dog.\n\nUmâ¦ what is happening in this game again?\n\nYouâve forgotten your focus? Shouldnât a Falâcie know receiving a focus is as clear as receiving a description of the movie Primer from someone whoâs only seen it once?\n\nWhy would a Falâcie explain, in detail, how to kill him?\n\nWhat is Orphan? Why are we introducing new crap Iâve never heard of thirty hours into the game?\n\nWhere did we get this ship? Why can it fly itself? How did we dodge a million missiles that blew up every cubic foot of air around us?\n\nâMaybe itâs a Falâcie thing.â #falciethings.\n\nWhy is Hope recanting the entire plot at the end of this tunnel? Also, his recap really goes a long way to illustrate just how absurd this entire story has become.\n\nLightning tells Snow his trust in Serah âmade her want to believeâ. When exactly? When she abandoned the party the first time, or when she abandoned Hope the second? Lightning hasnât believed in anything, ever.\n\nWhy did the game change my party between now and the Space Pope fight? No one went anywhere, the party didnât get splitâ¦ is the game so used to changing up the party every chapter it couldnât handle a transition without it?\n\nFang remarks that itâs strange an ark is hidden on Cocoon. Isnât Cocoon the only other planet around? Isnât this the only place it would end up?\n\nIf Dysey can teleport us at will, like he did to save us from crashing to a building, why didnât he just teleport us to the ark earlier? Why make us kill tons of soldiers on his ark to get to him, then teleport us away?\n\nWhatâs this giant gun? Can we use it? Couldnât we just clear out the whole room with it?\n\nNow Iâm being introduced toâ¦ the Maker? No no. Please god, no. I canât handle any more crazy deities in this fiction.\n\nRaines just blocked Lightningâs sword with his hands. Isâ¦ is he wearing special gloves? Or is Lightning just that bad at maintaining the edge of her sword?\n\nSo the Falâcieâs plan to get the maker to come back is toâ¦ kill everyone? How do they know this will work? Raines describes it as âa sacrifice.â Is it like a Lovecraftian ritual or something?\n\nAlso how long was Raines justâ¦ standing there, alone, in this giant room, waiting for us to show up?\n\nRainesâ plan actually seems pretty good. Space Pope made it clear he needs them alive. If they all die, then weâre good, right?\n\nItâs hard to care about Raines death when Iâve only spent five minutes of this sixty hour game with him.\n\nI hate the ark. I actively hate it. The same room gets reused over and over and over again.\n\nSo now that the entire party is together, everyone can now be every paradigm. While I appreciate the uncharacteristically generous customization, doesnât that invalidate the other party membersâ roles?\n\nI get this is an Ark and all, but where are we going in it? Why is it this big?\n\nWhy do all my abilities have to be centered on a single target? Why canât I use one cure on a character, one cure on another, and then an esuna on everyone? would that.... make the game too easy somehow?\n\nSnow wants to protect Cocoon, whatever it takes! Except letting Raines kill us all, of course. Thatâs just crazy.\n\nFang makes the very wise decision to turn on the group. Iâd leave this lot behind too. (She doesnât actually do this; her momentary crisis of conscience just exists to justify a new Eidolon fight.)\n\nEidolonâs only show up to kill someone whoâs failing at their task? How would someone branded ever turn into a Câeith then? Shouldnât an Eidolon show up to kill them before that ever happens?\n\nForget applying any real world rules; this game canât even keep its own whacky worldâs rules in order. Itâs like a reading a Dr. Seuss, only each page is from a different book.\n\nHeâs a Cieâth, a Cieâth I say,\n\nA Falâcie made him that way!\n\nBest follow your Focus too,\n\nor a the next Falâcie might make you a Grue!\n\nDid any of these characters actually decide, at any point in this game, that they were going to to kill all of Cocoon? It didnât seem like anyone was actually following that goal before. Snow even interpreted their focus as the exact opposite of that. So why does this moment, where everyone agrees not to blow up Cocoon, even exist?\n\nKnow whatâs great? Having your party changed on you before a fight, and finding out all your paradigms have been erased. Itâs fun.\n\nWhy does Lightning suddenly care about Hopeâs Dad?\n\nHow many times is this game going to tell me the characters are rejecting their focuses? We literally just watched a cutscene saying the same thing two minutes ago.\n\nDid they think I forgot between the Eidolon fight?\n\nArenât Fang and Vanille from Pulse? Shouldnât they take offense to everyone calling their home, âhellâ?\n\nVanille has a flashback scene talking about the fireworks display (of course) and how everyone knew then they could âchange their fateâ. How could they possibly think that? They werenât Lâcie, and Lightning didnât even know Serah was branded yet. Everyone was happy at the fireworks display except Lightning, who doesnât count because sheâs an emotionless robot who wasnât programmed for âhappyâ.\n\nMaybe everyone should consider using their Eidolons in cutscenes to get out of tricky situations.\n\nI have physically yelled âI donât careâ three times during Vanilleâs voice overs.\n\nFor the love of God, please stop changing my party and erasing my paradigms between every cutscene.\n\nShouldnât my team be able to figure out that if one flan is healed from casting lightning, all the others are too? Shouldnât they stop healing the enemies after the first go?\n\nWhat exactly is Hope dying from here? Being Hope?\n\nLightning shouldnât smile. It looks unnatural. Her synthetic robot exoskin wasnât made for it.\n\nSo an Eidolon is attacking Hope because he wanted to... not burden everyone?\n\nCanâ¦ can we not stand next to each other as the giant robot uses âexplosive fistâ? This fight is only hard because Hope is drawn to the robotâs massive knuckles.\n\nThe Sentinel Paradigmâs purpose is defeated when Hope wanders aimlessly into punches meant for Fang.\n\nHope says âI always thought Eidolonâs were meant to kill usâ and then thinks maybe they show up to âshow you the wayâ. Thatâs nice and all, except Fang said theyâll straight murder a Lâcie fool one hour ago.\n\nStop. Changing. My. Fucking. Party. After. Every. Cutscene.\n\nOh my god, game. When someone turns into a Câeith, do they turn into a monster, or a stone that gives you quests first? how do you become a Câeith without being killed by an Eidolon? What are your rules!? Are they always this flexible!?\n\nChanging party members is incredibly inconvenient, because it requires selecting entirely new paradigms every time. Why isnât there a way to âsaveâ a set of paradigms?\n\nIâm not appreciating an open map filled with things that can kill me in a single hit. I even less appreciate being unable to tell how powerful something is without losing a fight first.\n\nItâs dawning on me this game is major step back in the in-battle logic of Final Fantasy games. In ten, we acquired the ability to swap party members in mid-battle, but the fight still ended when only three were KOâed, as if the rest of the party looked at their fallen comrades and went, âWelp, nothing more we can do. Tidusâ corpse is blocking the way.â In twelve, game overs only occurred when all six party members were dead, and the game kindly assumed any conscious members would take the place of the fallen. Now not only is it game over if all the current members go down, but itâs also game over if only one specific member goes down.\n\nThat âopening upâ didnât last for very long, it seems, because Iâm right back to cavernous hallways.\n\nTheyâre called Cryohydronâs! Cryo. Please stop using ice on them during the first volley, idiots.\n\nLightning refers to the Gran Pulse as âbigâ. Iâm not so sure about that. Iâve seen one grassy plain and a rusty hallway.\n\nSnow wants to hitch a ride on the hedgehog Falâcie. The thing with giant red spikes all over it? The one thatâs cutting through solid rock as we speak?\n\nâNow youâre thinking gran pulse styleâ? You mean people in Gran Pulse frequently tried to ride on the sawblade FalâCie? No wonder you people lost a war.\n\nI can remove Lightning from the party? Oh Happy Day!\n\nSo the rest of the party is just going to hang back and watch Vanille and Fang fight the eight-armed freak?\n\nThis moment between Fang and Vanille is real sweet and all, but, umâ¦ where did everyone else go?\n\nWe almost gave the player a nice, lush environment. Quick, back to the caves! We have art assets to reuse, damnit!\n\nDid this story need a narrator? And if it did, why did it need to be Vanille? If anything, it seems Fang did all the killing as Ragnarok while Vanille just watched. Is that why she gets to be a narrator? Is she the Watson to her Holmes?\n\nComparing those two to Watson and Holmes actually made me throw up a little in my mouth. I apologize to the world, and to Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\nThe eternal FF13 question is, âJust how long is this hallway?â\n\nYou guys are actually going along with Snowâs âride Falâcie the Hedgehogâ plan?\n\nDo I ever get a âslap Snowâ button?\n\nSo Vanille knew Serah? Before becoming branded? They were friends and on a first name basis? And weâre finding this out right now?\n\nYet somehow Serahâs fiancÃ© and sister donât recognize her friend?\n\nDid anyone think about how all this ties together? Or was it all just written as they went, and no one ever looked back?\n\nThe staging of this scene is incredibly awkward.\n\nSo we learned nothing from that scene except that Vanille knew Serah in the past, and for reasons the picture above might explain, Serah kept their friendship from Snow. So what was the point of this scene? To... surprise the player? To make it seem like Vanille was actually more involved in this story?\n\nThis moment where Lightning encourages Snow and approves of his proposal to Serah is so out of character for her that I assume it must be an imposter. Way to be bold Lightning, being accepting of the marriage after the brideâs been turned into a crystal.\n\nI donât hate the idea of Snow carrying around a crystal tear, but is it really necessary to have him stare through it in every cutscene on Gran Pulse?\n\nThereâs been so many FalâCieâs even the games characters are becoming dismissive about all the gods flying around. âWhatâs another FalâCie at this point?â says Lightning. Says a lot about the power of the gods in your universe when even the main characters donât care when they show up.\n\nWhat does gaining a role level actually do? All the stat increases appear to be dispersed throughout each tier.\n\nIâm now tasked with completing three missions to advance the game. The missions are all âkill this thing on this floorâ. I am in no way advancing the plot. My time is being deliberately wasted.\n\nThis mission requires me to pay attention the the absurd enemy names. As if I know what a girgamuchalamadingdong is.\n\nWhatâs the point of the Sentinel stance if challenge and provoke donât challenge or provoke the enemy?\n\nI take back all the negative words I used about THE HALLWAY. I would rather have one long hallway then eight vertical hallways that require an elevator trip every five minutes.\n\nThis is the first Final Fantasy game where leveling up is a chore.\n\nThis is the worst section of the game yet. Iâve spent two hours talking to statues, which send me to kill things down THE HALLWAY, so I can earn the privilege of having the path forward unlocked, so I can talk to more statues.\n\nAfter killing the Falâcie at the top of the statue tower, a bunch of wildlife suddenly surrounds us after a cutscene. How exactly did they get up here? How didnât we notice them? Thereâs only one moving platform that leads up here. Did these dog/wolf hybrids spawn figure out how to operate it?\n\nTwo bosses later and Iâm still in chapter 11. How much longer is this game?\n\nHow do we suddenly know we can remove the brands? Has it ever been done before?\n\nSazh encourages us to âtake our time now that weâre homeâ. That would be easier to do if all of us werenât ticking Câeith time bombs.\n\nThe game has replaced long hallways and a convoluted plot with long hallways and fetch quests. Itâs starting to feel more like a Final Fantasy game, I suppose.\n\nShane has informed me everyoneâs weapon has the same name at its final upgrade stage, yet retains stats relative to whatever weapon it started as. This means Lightning can have four Omega Weapons, all with different stats. Not all that âOmegaâ, is it? More like Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta weapons, I guess.\n\nOrphan isâ¦ actually kind of neat. Itâs the first town Iâve seen that looks like people actually lived in it once.\n\nIf we actually find a way to remove the Lâcie brands, a thing thatâs never been done in the history of this world and never been hinted at, I will start finding a way to eat. My own. Face.\n\nWhy isnât this Ragnarok idea teased at the start of the game? Actually, why doesnât Vanille start this story with V.O.? She is the narrator, right?\n\nWhy does the group believe this is actually Serah for any amount of time? Last we saw, she was a crystal. And even if she somehow decrystalized, is anyone going to ask how she got to a different planet? Or about how she materialized out of thin air?\n\nLightningâs real name is Claire. Thatâsâ¦ actually not terrible, I guess.\n\nSo the Falâcie can bring people back from the dead? Raines is alive again?\n\nWhat. The fuck. Is this old manâs plan? Incite a war by making shit up? Imagine if I told you to kill somebody and then said âbecause heâs actually from the city of Atlantis, and they hate usâ. Who the hell would take that at face value?\n\nThis plan is so stupid I find myself angry the game expects me to be worried about Cocoon. Iâve been to Cocoon. I did a thorough tour. Itâs all hallways and monsters. Good riddance.\n\nOh good, another Space Pope robot dog fight.\n\nLeveling up is such a fucking chore in this game I actually stopped doing it. I only enter the Chrystarium now when the numbers exceed 100,000.\n\nSo the bad guysâ plan is the shoot us with lasers for a while, then invite us to come do his bidding? Someone send Barthalaneus to business school so he can learn negotiation tactics. A âhostile takeoverâ doesnât mean one company storms the other with shock troopers and tanks.\n\nSo we find a Cieâth stone, which weâve established is a phase between turning from human to monster. A Cieâth cocoon, if you will, where the poor soul inside can still tell his focus to others. After the boss fight, we come across this Cieâth stone:\n\nVanille looks at this one and says, âItâs a record of what happened. After we turned to crystal.â How does she know this? because this one is what, purple? Is purple the universal color for ârecordsâ?\n\nLindzei? What the hell is Lindzei? Stop introducing more made up words thirty hours in!\n\nThis motorcycle sequence where we teleport into Cocoon and interrupt a race is really cool. You know what would be cooler? If we got to play it. Almost like another game I can think of that had a motorcycle scene in itâ¦\n\nâThe armies of Pulse are using transgates.â âArmies of Pulseâ? Who? Can a bunch of wildlife really be considered an army? Thereâs no one on Pulse anymore. And whatâs a transgate?\n\nAgain, direct quote: âAn army of creatures is attacking the city. Itâs a pulse invasion force.â If a bunch of tigers escaped from the zoo, would it be reported as Malaysia declaring war on the United States?\n\nWhat was the fucking point of bringing Raines back from the dead if he just gets shot in the head and dies two seconds later? To get more use out of his character model?\n\nI see my party has changed again. Thanks. Thanks for that. Iâd expect no less by now.\n\nWhat the fuck is going on? Why does everyone suddenly have magic jumping devices? Why would you hand one to Vanille and not explain what it does? Sheâs clearly confused! Someone help her!\n\nEveryone is doing so many cool things they canât actually do during a fight in this game.\n\nCharacters wonât use their ultimate attacks unless I play as them. This makes acquiring them much more annoying.\n\nBathanalamadingdong is surprised when we do the most predictable possible thing and fly the plane he gave us right into his fucking face. Thanks for the ship, idiot!\n\nLeveling up in any RPG should not feel like a chore, right? I shouldnât be like, âDamn, Iâm sick of leveling up. Iâm just not going to do it for a while.â\n\nLightning utters the line, âletâs show them how human we still areâ. I found this an odd choice, since they chose their only robot cast member to say it.\n\nThe âinvasionâ of Eden is a perfect example as to why you donât want a city made of a bunch of suspended walkways. Every single platoon of soldiers has nowhere to run from the giant beasts, because their only options are forward or back.\n\nThe Space Popeâs âInvasionâ of Eden also seems a little too effective. What happened to that whole âstart a war and the people will kill themselvesâ plan? Did he realize it would be easier to just have these dinosaur creatures kill everyone and circumvent the whole war thing?\n\nItâs been so long since Iâve seen Snowâs lame brigade that I forgot they existed.\n\nâFalâcie are no match for NORAâ is still a terrible motto.\n\nSo much of these final chapters are just padding. Instead of a section of THE HALLWAY followed by a cutscene, itâs eight hallways followed by a cutscene.\n\nIâve never felt such regret over only having two middle fingers before.\n\nBalthalamalamadingdong keeps growing in size and teleporting around. He never attacks though. Whatâs the point of all the spatial manipulation? Just to look imposing?\n\nEven Sazh addresses how ridiculous the antagonists name is by dismissing it as âwhatever it isâ.\n\nHope says this throne is where they âcontrol all the other Falâcieâ. Wait, control!? They control gods? No one said anything about control until just now. If they control the gods, how did they fuck up so bad and let them run around branding people? And how do they control them exactly? Is it like a doggie shock collar? Do they hit the Falâcie with a 300 story newspaper? âBad Falâcie! No! No branding!â\n\nOk, gameâ¦ you canât just break your own established rules. So now the Falâcie can just turn anybody into Câeith whenever they want? And thereâs no stone incubation period, that thing you made a big fuss about on Pulse? Iâm trying to understand your bullshit mythology game, but you keep changing the rules.\n\nIs this it? the end of THE HALLWAY? Please say yes.\n\nHey, game. You know whatâs pretty fucked up? Giving enemies any insta-death ability in a game where if one specific character dies, I lose.\n\nAm I supposed to care about Rosch dying? I literally met the guy once, and he tried to kill us even after we approached him reasonably. Then he tried to kill us again, right now.I actually had to remind myself who he was when he appeared again.\n\nâI do not issue this order as an absoluteâ should never be uttered by someone in any military service, fictional or real. If it isnât absolute, it isnât an order; itâs a suggestion.\n\nAlso doesnât it kind of diminish the spirit of the gesture? If what Rosh desired was to help us and commands his troops stop shooting us, but then adds âyou can still shoot them if you want, I guessâ, doesnât it kind of invalidate the whole premise of his action?\n\nâStay alive, weâll see you when itâs overâ, says Snow. Two seconds later Behemoths come marching right into Roshâs face, and he blows himself up to kill them. Stay alive, indeed.\n\nFinally reached what resembles the end of Chapter 12. Please, please let chapter 13 be just a boss fight.\n\nAs I approach the end of the game, Iâm suddenly acutely aware of the inherent irony in this story. As Final Fantasy 13 tells me about a group of branded people who decide to throw off their god-given shackles and rebel against fate, it also simultaneously shoves me into a 40-hour-long corridor where I can only travel in one direction.\n\nOh god. Iâm here. Itâs the place where the Falâcie make THE HALLWAY. The hallways stretch into oblivion. All I hear are footsteps, echoing through time, growing in pitch and volume with every. Single. Step. GAZE UPON THE HALLWAY, AND DESPAIR.\n\nThis sight has filled me with an infinite despair. Barthamalamadingdong has won.\n\nâHeâll wait until we give up and slip on the leashâ? How does that work? Can Barthamalamarama do mind control now too? Butâ¦ but it only works when people feel despair?\n\nVanille, why are you casting Esuna on me when I have one health? Are the NPCâs working against me? Do they wish for death in the same way I do? Do they realize my death, for no observable reason, also equates to theirs?\n\nThis is the 1,867th hallway weâve designed. Weâre becoming exceedingly efficient at it.\n\nHow do we know itâs just Falâcie smoke and mirrors? Weâve seen this Falâcie teleport across the universe and deliver us a spaceship. I think its fair to assume he can also teleport and blow up your crystallized loved ones.\n\nThis final boss is designed to feel hard without actually being hard. An instant death attack means the player will need to try the fight over again and again, but the player has no control over this ability and no means to prevent it, save attaining a few items to lessen its chance earlier in the game. Its only real purpose is to cover up sloppy design decisions and feel difficult, without actually being so...\n\nIâm actually offended by this final boss fight. Imagine if you were someone who really enjoyed this game and leveled up everyoneâs crystariums completely. No matter how much grinding you did, youâd still have to deal with a boss that can just kill you in a single lucky blow. And if he happens to cast it on the character youâre controllingâ¦ tough! Game over. Your other party members arenât smart enough to cast raise or Phoenix Down on their own.\n\nOne other piece of advice I see online often is to either intentionally lose a fight or select restart from the menu to change Paradigms. This piece of advice isnât just for the final boss fight, itâs also for every boss that takes place right after a forced change in party members. âIntentionally loseâ should not be advice fans need to give one another.\n\nâHave you ever stopped to ponder why we make Lâcie of men?â Only the entire. Fucking. Game.\n\nSo the scooby gang doesnât have to go through the rock cocoon period either? What was the point of ever introducing that concept? As a weak tool for side quests?\n\nThe game is trying to make me feel emotional by flashing back to all the moments I hated. Itâs working, alright, but probably not as intended.\n\nCocoon almost collided with Pulse. Good thing Fang and Vanille transformed into demon Voltron and harnessed the power of crystals to stop it.\n\nSo many assumptions are made in this moment from the final cutscene it hurts.\n\nEven if we choose to ignore all the massive planetary shifts that would occur from these two celestial bodies being this close together, here are the problems I still have with this moment:\n\nHow does Serah know Dahj? Did they happen to de-crystallize next to each other, get to talking? How would they even know they have mutual friends? âHey, I bet my fiancÃ© knows your dad! It says so right here, in the script!â\n\nHow did they know where to find the gang after a near planetary collision?\n\nHow did they get from the wreckage of Cocoon to the ground of Pulse so fast? Thereâs no vehicles behind them, no sign of any military presence guiding them hereâ¦ so what? They just climbed down a 9,000 foot crystal spire?\n\nSo killing the Falâcie that branded you doesnât remove the brand, but killing an unrelated Space Dog Falâcie does?\n\nFang and Vanille turn into Ragnarok and save the planet. Great. Ok. Isnât everyone on the southern hemisphere of Cocoon dead now, though?\n\nI offer a few words in kindness as we approach the end:\n\nThe Sunleth Waterscape has catchy music.\n\nThe enemy designs are creative, colorful, and clever.\n\nThe game looks nice, even when running at a lower resolutions.\n\nBoss battles, especially against Barth-ama-lama-dingdong, have remarkably unique dialogue.\n\nI can now understand and sympathize with the many people who quit at Square Enix during production of this game.\n\nThe unique full ATB techniques for each character look really cool, which makes it a shame the computer-controlled characters refuse to use them.\n\nThe idea of switching roles in combat is cleverâ¦ itâs just executed in a way that immediately invalidates its creativity.\n\nAnd finally, finally, we come to...\n\nFrom an outside perspective, I always thought Final Fantasy 13 looked like a step backwards in the franchise. I no longer believe this. Saying itâs a step backwards in the series is insulting, because it implies it belongs in the series at all.\n\nI think it shouldâve killed the franchise.\n\nFinal Fantasy 13 is the heat-death of the Final Fantasy universe, a slow sputtering into non-existence fueled by flat characters who march down hallways for all eternity. As the universe spreads apart, the last sound to fade from existence is the pitter-pattering of feet echoing down a million lifeless corridors.\n\nFuck this game.\n\nWith that, my odyssey through Final Fantasy 13âs twisted, bungling narrative came to a close. As the credits rolled I felt no desire to play other entries in this dreadfully unnecessary trilogy. I was free.\n\nThen, around Thanksgiving, I received a gift-wrapped package from amazon in the mail. Its contents, and the attached note, are pictured below:\n\nGod. Dammit.\n\nIt canât possibly be worse. I literally cannot conceive of a reality where the second chapter in this narrative is more confusing then what I've just experienced.\n\nAddendum: A month later, Shane purchased the PC version of 13-2 for me. Now I can even choose how to continue the journey of these lifeless automatons!\n\nAnd you know what? It's still more choice then Final Fantasy 13 ever gave me.\n\n2"
