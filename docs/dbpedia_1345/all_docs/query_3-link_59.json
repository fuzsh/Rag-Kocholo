        "text": "Revealed a couple days ago, Square Enix has uploaded an official first look at the initial batch of Lightning Returns costume DLC - a set of three costumes and weapons now available for purchase and download in Japan. The costumes in question include the Lovely Moogle Style, Holy Asgard and Ultimate Liberator - each of which can be had for ¥400 each or ¥1,000 for the entire set. More DLC will be available come December 17th and February 16th, although their contents and pricing remain to be announced.\n\nSquare Enix has made a second video digest available online, chronicling even more of the music found in Lightning Returns. This specific video has been mixed by Mitsuto Suzuki. One again, the video is quite lengthy and provides a good look at the various tracks players can expect when they visit the different areas in the game. You can order a copy of the soundtrack for yourself by clicking here.\n\nFirst week sales figures for Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII are in - and they're not pretty. The game - which became available on November 21st - managed to pull in 277,082 sales on the PlayStation 3 and a place at the top of Japan's Media Create sales chart which tracked from November 18th to 24th. These results, however, are not favorable when looking at the rest of the XIII series as Lightning Returns has displayed another 50% drop off from the already low launch sales of the previous entry (XIII-2). For comparison Final Fantasy XIII launched in Japan with 1,501,964 units sold, while XIII-2 did 524,217 units on PS3 two years later at a lower price. Whether Square Enix is happy with these numbers or not remains to be seen, but speculation following launch day was that LR only sold through around 50-60% of its lower initial shipment as well. Note that these figures do not include digital sales from the PlayStation Network nor the Xbox 360 version as the latter failed to sell enough to make the chart.\n\nFans looking to try out Lightning Returns for free now can - as long as they have a Japanese PlayStation Network account. Square Enix has published a new demo to the storefront, giving players a chance to try out the game's various mechanics and style changes starting off from the beginning of the game as Lightning must chase after Snow through Yusnaan's palace. The demo clocks in at 1.7GB in size and is only available with Japanese voice and text. Additionally, a set of \"premium costumes\" is available for purchase including one styled with moogles. Owners of the Japanese version of the game can purchase this set for ¥1,000 (approximately $10) or each one individually at ¥400. According to the official Lightning Returns Twitter account, the next rounds of costume DLC will drop on December 17th and February 16th with details forthcoming. Via: FF-Reunion.\n\nLightning Returns will feature the original Japanese Voice-Overs available as free downloadable content (DLC) during the first two weeks of the game being on-sale, Square Enix revealed today. After this limited period, the Japanese Voice-Over Pack will be available as paid DLC - although pricing on that specific item has yet to be announced. The Japanese Voice-Over Pack also includes lip-synching that differs from the English-language voice track already included with the game, to ensure a more natural and localized game experience. The game is set to hit western shelves on February 11, 2014 in North America and February 14th for Europe.\n\nIn celebration of the release of Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII in Japan, Square Enix has revealed a launch trailer of sorts that captures the games characters and various locations in the world of Nova Chrysalia. The game’s developers used the in-game engine and assets to construct a brand new sequence that doesn't actually exist in the game proper. The game will be ready for North American and European fans on February 11 and February 14, 2014 respectively."
