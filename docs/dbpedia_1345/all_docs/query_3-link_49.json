I know some about the game though, and I've played almost every other game in the series but this one so I thought maybe it'd be like 7/8 or 6 in tone. But oh no.\n\n5 minutes in...growling buttmetal and dudebro chugga chugga guitar, but I guess with a Japanese twist. Wtf? Was this cool in 2001? Really turns me off. Is the rest of the game this tone? And the faces in this remaster are terrible even at 4k.\n\nBut yeah, only playing about an hour I know immediately that FF12 and the PS1 titles are going to be better. Should I drop it or does it get more like those older games?\n\nYeah, this is just for the intro. I also liked it but the rest of the music in the game is not like that at all and is excellent, I especially love the music in Besaid which you'll get to very soon if you keep playing. I don't know if you consider game music spoilers but just listen to some of the soundtrack to get a better feel of if you'll like it or not.\n\nI've never played FFX, so I wanted to try given that it has a very cheap remaster now.

Should I drop it or does it get more like those older games?\n\nyeah it was cool in 2001. But that's not a big issue.\n\nThe rest of the game is different but still a mess of designs that is unlike any FF before it\n\nWhy don't you play the game for 30 minutes at least and find out?\n\nOne metal song is going to turn you off that much for just 5 minutes?\n\nMaybe play the game more than 5 minutes to see if it's all like that?\n\nWay to read an OP. Been playing for about 2 hours now.\n\nI wonder is his band - was it called The Black Mages? - did this track. Anyways it's a 1 off the rest of the soundtrack is traditional FF music and is great. He likes metal kind of stuff I bet that's how/why this one track made it into the game.\n\nThey did on the second album, however the vocals were made kinda poppy, with a female singer.\n\nI'll never forget Spoony's old review mentioning the original\n\nwhen it comes back in the Jecht fight.\n\n\"Sounds like a dog trying to sing Slayer.\"\n\nIt doesnt sound like Nu metal, at all\n\nI totally agree, but my guess is that they wanted to catch the attention of that audience, kinda.\n\nYou gotta put yourself into the context of a Japanese developer trying to find something 'cool' for a worldwide crowd in an era where even though internet existed, communication and worldwide feedback wasn't what it is today.\n\nI feel you OP. It's probably the most misplaced track i've seen in a videogame. The music is not even necessarily bad, just doesn't have anything to do with FFX at all.\n\nBut it also plays only 2 times in the entire game. It wasn't a problem for me.\n\nUematsu is a fan of heavy metal/progressive rock\n\nAlso, Other world is an amazing track.\n\nOtherworld doesn't even remotely look like prog rock or classic heavy metal tho. There's a lot of Uematsu stuff that could be treated as direct influence but it's not the case with this track.\n\nThey did on the second album, however the vocals were made kinda poppy, with a female singer.\n\nI'll never forget Spoony's old review mentioning the original\n\nwhen it comes back in the Jecht fight.\n\n\"Sounds like a dog trying to sing Slayer.\"\n\nLol that quote is great. It sure was/is unique. I always liked it :)"
