        "text": "“As far as I'm concerned, the essentials of jazz are: melodic improvisation, melodic invention, swing, and instrumental personality.”[1] (bold not in original)\n\n++++Mose Allison (1927–2016)\n\n“An item in Talking Machine World for July 15, 1920 says, \"Art Hickman (1886 – 1930) . . . insists that his orchestra, now playing on the Ziegfeld roof, is not a jazz band. 'Jazz,' says Mr. Hickman, 'is merely noise, a product of the honky-tonks, and has no place in a refined atmosphere. I have tried to develop an orchestra that charges every pulse with energy without stooping to the skillet beating, sleigh bell ringing contraptions and physical gyrations of a padded cell.” (p. 6)\n\n++++Art Hickman (1886-1930)\n\n“In this book, The Story of Jazz, I, [Marshall W. Stearns (1908–1966)], have tried not to treat jazz, or any other music, as holy. The reason for this book is quite simple: people in the United States listen to and enjoy jazz or near-jazz more than any other music. Jazz is of tremendous importance for its quantity alone. Because of its all-pervasiveness it has a great influence on most of us. Jazz has played a part, for better or worse, in forming the American character. Jazz is a fact that should be faced and studied. Like other musics, however, jazz has its aesthetics and there are crucial qualitative differences. There is good and bad jazz, and all shades between. Further, jazz is a separate and distinct art, to be judged by separate and distinct standards, and comparisons are useful when they help to establish this point. Jazz also has an ancient and honorable history, and this book is designed to deal with these varied questions. Perhaps I should add that in Part Four, \"The Jazz Age,\" rather than list a series of locations and personnels—work that has already been done—I tried to explore the fascinating but complex process by which jazz spreads. I see no reason to maintain the melancholy pretense of absolute objectivity. I like jazz very much, and I am no doubt biased in its favor—at least to the extent of trying to find out what it is all about.”[2] (bold not in original)\n\nGuitarist John McLaughlin (b. 1942) was asked by JazzTimes Jim Farber: “. . . you’ve worked with so many other great bands, from Shakti to your most recent group, 4th Dimension. Do you have a core principle that has guided you through all of it?\n\nJohn Mclaughlin replied:\n\n“I was talking about this recently with [drummer and wife of Carlos Santana] Cindy Blackman. She was telling me that she asked Wayne (Shorter), “What is the meaning of jazz?” And Wayne said, “I dare you.” [Laughs] I thought that was really cool. That means you’ve got to stand up and be yourself. It’s like when your trousers are down by your ankles. You’re naked in front of the world and you’re free. Now go and be inspired!”[3] (bold not in original)\n\nJon Batiste (b. 1986): “I see jazz as a superpower,” he says. “It has never depended on popularity to maintain relevance because its value is undeniable; it represents all the nuances of the human soul. It is an honor to play this music because it is my heritage—it is the Blackest, deepest American classical music that has grown to become a universal art form. Jazz shows you that something can be from a specific experience and it can be adapted in a way that’s not appropriated.”[4]\n\n“Jazz is a strange thing. I think you really have to have played it a long time and been really involved in it to understand it. There’s something about the rhythm feel that’s not easy to learn. You have to really play it and have a history of working with it to have a jazz feeling somehow.”[5] (bold not in original)\n\n++++Ralph Towner (b. 1940)\n\nDiscussion[edit]\n\nIf you are an approved editor, then please enter any comments, questions, or arguments on the Discussion page by clicking on the word Discussion.\n\nIn the introduction to his first book, The Sound of Surprise, (1959) late author Whitney Balliett (1926-2007) wrote:\n\n“It’s a compliment to jazz that nine-tenths of the voluminous writing about it is bad, for the best forms often attract the most unbalanced admiration. At the same time, it is remarkable that so fragile a music has withstood such truckloads of enthusiasm.”\n\n“Jazz, after all, is a highly personal, lightweight form—like poetry, it is an art of surprise—that, shaken down, amounts to the blues, some unique vocal and instrumental sounds, and the limited, elusive genius of improvisation.”[6]\n\nControversy over Defining Jazz[edit]\n\nIntroduction[edit]\n\nNumerous scholars, theorists, critics, music reviewers, and many famous jazz musicians have all disdained or pooh-poohed, or even outright rejected, the possibility of producing a successful, satisfying, and correct definition of jazz.\n\nIn 1957, Leonard Feather (1914–1994) opens his book on jazz with a belief that a definition of jazz is a \"near-impossibility.\"\n\n“With the belated emergence of jazz from its long-suffered role as the Cinderella of esthetics, and with its gradual acceptance in many previously closed areas, the definition of its nature, always disputed among critics and to some extent among musicians and the public, has become a near-impossibility.”[7] (bold not in original)\n\n(For a critique of some of Feather's views see below.)\n\nPeter Townsend states, in his Jazz in American Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh UP, 2000) p. 162, that Louis Armstrong, Fats Waller, and Duke Ellington each in effect has responded to the question \"What is jazz?\" by replying that \"If you have to ask, then you'll never know.\"[8] (For an assessment of some of Townsend's views go here.)\n\nLet us reflect upon the Armstrong quotation of \"If you have to ask, you will never know.\" Armstrong's claim does not make any sense at all. Suppose Thelonious already innately knows jazz. A mark of knowing is correctly answering questions about what it is that is known. If someone who did not know what jazz is were now to ask Thelonious what is jazz, should not a knower such as Thelonious be able to educate and inform this questioner with the correct answer? Of course, he should be able to answer the question if he already knows the answer. If Thelonious cannot answer the question, then this is strong evidence that Thelonious does not know.\n\nFurthermore, in this scenario, the ignorant questioner after learning what Thelonious knows to be a correct conception of jazz has now learned the answer by asking the question thereby proving the blatant falsity of anyone claiming \"if you have to ask, then you will never know.\" The very opposite is true, as all scientists agree. If you do not ask, then you will never know.\n\n➢ Assuming for now that the above reasoning is correct, why would Armstrong/Ellington/Fats Waller make such a curious remark?[9]\n\nClearly, the point of this remark is to get the questioner to stop asking the question. This is most certainly an anti-intellectual response and is rejecting any possible merit to any investigation into the nature of music that qualifies as jazz. Anti-intellectual knee jerk reactions are always wrong precisely because intellectual investigations always have merit even when they are mistaken. How could anyone ever find out something is a mistake if they don't first articulate the position and viewpoint? PoJ.fm's philosophy is always to ask.[10]\n\nIn 1973 Duke Ellington (1899–1974) comments on the apparent overinclusion of too many different types of music under the jazz label.\n\n“I don't know how such great extremes as now exist can be contained under the one heading.”[11]\n\nEllington asserts that jazz may have had a defined character in the past, but that by now the category of jazz is too diffuse to have a uniform definition other than it's being an American creation based on an African foundation. Ellington makes the point with these words:\n\n“If ‘jazz’ means anything at all, which is questionable, it means the same thing it meant to musicians ﬁfty years ago—freedom of expression. I used to have a deﬁnition, but I don’t think I have one anymore unless it is that it is a music with an African foundation which came out of an American environment.’”[12] (bold not in original)\n\nClosely following in the footsteps of one of the first books on jazz—Winthrop Sargent's (1906–1986) 1938 publication of Jazz: Hot and Hybrid)[13]—noted jazz commentator Wilder Hobson (1906–1964) argues in his \"Chapter 1: Introduction\" of American Jazz Music (1939) that jazz cannot be defined because it is a language.\n\n“It would be convenient to give a succinct definition of its form, but attempts to do so have lead only to such statements as “a band swings when its collective improvisation is rhythmically integrated.” The reason why jazz cannot be defined is the fact that it is a language. It is not a collection of rhythmic tricks or tonal gags, but a distinctive rhythmic-melodic-tonal idiom—as is, say, Japanese gaga-ku or Balinese gong music. And a language of course cannot be defined. A rude sense of it may be had by hearing it. Beyond that, what it communicates will be involved with what the hearer knows of its form.”[14] (italics authors; bold and bold italics not in original)\n\n(For objections to Hobson's reasons that jazz cannot be defined because it is a language, see Ontdef3. What is the definition of jazz?: Objections to Wilder Hobson's view that jazz cannot be defined because it is a language)\n\nIn 2006, the authors of Jazz: The First 100 Years, Henry Martin (b. 1950) and Keith Waters (b. 1958) believe it is futile and a dead end to try to define jazz:\n\n“What is jazz? It seems proper to begin our historical discussion of jazz by defining it, but this is a famous dead end: entire articles have been written on the futility of pinning down the precise meaning of jazz. Proposed definitions have failed either because they are too restrictive—overlooking a lot of music we think of as jazz—or too inclusive—calling virtually any kind of music \"jazz.\"”[15] (bold and italic not in original)\n\nBenjamin Bierman[16] in his Listening to Jazz[17] (2nd ed. 2019) claims that any definition of jazz is \"doomed to failure.\" Let's think about this for a moment. Is it even theoretically possible that there exists anything that cannot be defined? Is it not more likely that if it cannot be defined, then there just is no 'it' to begin with? This is a complex metaphysical question that needs to be explored elsewhere and so it is covered at PoJ.fm's Ontmeta8. On the impossibility of definition.\n\n“Unlike many earlier texts, Listening to Jazz wisely refrains from attempting to define the word “jazz,” an exercise that is doomed to failure. Bierman explains why some of the more commonly cited, and ostensibly essential, elements of jazz (e.g. swing and improvisation) cannot serve as universally accepted criteria in formulating even a broad definition. Instead, he presents a cogent summary of the music’s origins and influences as well as the musical characteristics of its various styles and eras.[18] (bold not in original)\n\nNotice that if one can provide a summary of jazz's origins, influences, and musical characteristics shouldn't one then be well on their way to a definition?\n\nAnd it may well be that we don't even want a definition of jazz if they end up being like that provided by Funk and Wagnall in 1920:\n\n“Jazz spent a lot of its childhood being ignored, derided or denounced as decadent. For example, the supposedly objective Funk & Wagnall Desk Standard Dictionary (1920) defines `jazzband' as: 'A company of musicians who play rag-time music in discordant tones on various instruments, as the banjo, saxophone, trombone, flageolet, drum and piano.'”[19]\n\nSaxophonist and music educator Gary Bartz (b. 1940) in his \"Why He Can't Teach You Jazz, But He Can Teach You Music\" teaching video at JazzAcademy where he expresses disdain for jazz because he finds it too limiting. Bartz lectures that “I would like to talk to you today about the word \"jazz,\" which I just hate, and I think everybody knows that. Because it misleads so many people down the wrong path, let me say.”\n\nOpposed to this pessimism about the possibility of defining jazz, Peter Townsend, (senior lecturer in the School of Music and Humanities at the University of Huddersfield in England), some of whose views are examined below, writes as if it may be as easy to define jazz as it is to define anything else.\n\n“Jazz is often thought of as being mysterious, elusive, and hard to define. But since the meaning of a word is its use, jazz is no harder to define than anything else (try defining 'popular music', for example), provided one has decided how to use the word.[20] (bold and bold italic not in original)\n\nNot afraid to investigate whether or not jazz has an essence and can be defined is French composer, historian, and professor of music and musicology at Sorbonne University, Laurent Cugny, in his recently translated into English and published book, Analysis of Jazz: A Comprehensive Approach (2019).\n\nIn his book, Cugny “examines and connects the theoretical and methodological processes that underlie all of jazz” and aims to define what is a jazz work based on its features and structure, including its harmony, rhythm, form, sound, or melody. Laurent Cugny tries to show how to identify jazz. He states his positions and explains his thinking with these words\n\n“For at least a couple of decades, the concept of essentialism has fueled a strong current of disapproval in musicology in general and in the musicology of jazz in particular. It sets out that each thing—physical object or concept—would have an alleged nature (or essence) that dictates where things stand to each other without any scope for variation or change. When understood in this sense, the concept of essentialism becomes a dreadful weapon brandished as soon as the verb to be is used and in whatever context. Not only does this attitude elude the philosophical history of the concept (which is endowed with more meanings than this particular one) but it also often tends to confuse essentialism with naturalism. The latter is a different concept that has been used in history to justify many indefensible things. Once we ensure that the differences between the two currents are made clear, I see no reason why the nature(s) of jazz in our case should be a taboo. It is thus possible to envisage that, through the many-faceted process of analyzing jazz, we may touch on the question of its essence and feel free to contribute to the debate about it. For it is certain that jazz exists.”[21] (bold and bold italic not in original)\n\nAmerican poet, music and cultural critic, syndicated columnist, novelist, and biographer known for his jazz criticism Stanley Crouch (1945–2020) does not shy away from the controversy over whether jazz can be defined. He at least thinks that it has central elements that virtually all reactions to jazz tend to incorporate into their music.\n\n“I did not buy the idea that there was no definition whatsoever of jazz and that any attempt to define jazz was an attempt to \"put it in a box,\" an idea that had come into jazz from two directions.\n\nOne direction comes from musicians of the 1960s, who considered themselves avant-garde and had rejected the word \"jazz\" in favor of \"black music\" or \"creative music.\" When they found no takers for their wares, they angrily returned to the world of jazz—which most of them couldn't play!—and were eventually embraced by jazz critics who are, for various reasons, obsessed with exclusion and have grafted ideas about cultural relativism into the world of criticism. They love to assert, over and over, that everything is relative and jazz is whatever you choose to call it. Otherwise, they argue, you speak for an establishment trying to keep a variety of jazz musicians from receiving respect. The other direction for this thinking comes from the period in which Miles Davis and a number of first-class jazz musicians sold out to rock and produced what was eventually called \"fusion,\" jazz-tinged improvisation over stiff, rock beats that did not swing. The result today is the instrumental pop music known as \"smooth jazz.\"\n\nI bought none of that. Jazz has a very solid base of Afro-American fundamentals that exclude no one of talent, regardless of color, anymore than the Italian and German fundamentals of opera do. These fundamentals remained in place from the music's beginnings in New Orleans to, literally, yesterday. Those fundamentals are 4/4 swing (or swing in any meter), blues, the romantic or meditative ballad, and what Jelly Roll Morton called \"the Spanish tinge,\" meaning Latin rhythms. All major directions in jazz have resulted from reimagining those fundamentals, not avoiding them.”[22] (bold and bold italic not in original)\n\nAn optimistic approach towards defining jazz[edit]\n\nSuppose we start by presuming that it is possible to define jazz, contrary to the opinion of many experts.[23]\n\nOne approach is that adapted by Marshall W. Stearns (1908–1966) in his systematic methodology of describing the history of jazz, and tracing its evolution, structure, forms and techniques from the music of Africa through the heyday of New Orleans to the present day of 1956. In his book, The Story of Jazz (see the three book covers in graphic below), Stearns touches on the main points in the development of jazz—the influence of the blues, minstrels, spirituals and ragtime, jazz of the 1920s and 1930s, the swing and bop era, Afro-Cuban music and rock and roll. He examines the styles that originated in New Orleans, Chicago, New York, St. Louis, and Kansas City, along with individual sketches of the great jazz personalities. The book also strives to provide a direct analysis of the technical elements, form and structure of jazz.\n\n➢ How might one go about finding an effective definition for jazz?\n\nOne way would be to examine previously proposed definitions and see how they hold up under scrutiny. PoJ.fm does a critique of the many failed attempts at providing a sufficient condition for jazz that picks out all and only jazz. Many of the proposals are shown to fail at PoJ.fm's \"What are not sufficient conditions for playing jazz.\"\n\nAssessment of the views of Gunther Schuller and Hughes Panassié[edit]\n\nThe Encyclopedia Brittanica entry (all Schuller quotations are from the \"Jazz\" article in Brittanica) written by American musicologist, composer, conductor, horn player, author, historian, and jazz musician Gunther Schuller (1925–2015), as we see below, first defines jazz, or at least attempts a detailed delineation and characterization of jazz and its origins and its musical influences, while then immediately claiming the futility of trying to define it.\n\n“Jazz, [is a] musical form, often improvisational, developed by African Americans and influenced by both European harmonic structure and African rhythms. It was developed partially from ragtime and blues and is often characterized by syncopated rhythms, polyphonic ensemble playing, varying degrees of improvisation, often deliberate deviations of pitch, and the use of original timbres.[24]\n\n“Any attempt to arrive at a precise, all-encompassing definition of jazz is probably futile. Jazz has been, from its very beginnings at the turn of the 20th century, a constantly evolving, expanding, changing music, passing through several distinctive phases of development; a definition that might apply to one phase—for instance, to New Orleans style or swing—becomes inappropriate when applied to another segment of its history, say, to free jazz. Early attempts to define jazz as a music whose chief characteristic was improvisation, for example, turned out to be too restrictive and largely untrue, since composition, arrangement, and ensemble have also been essential components of jazz for most of its history. Similarly, syncopation and swing, often considered essential and unique to jazz, are lacking in much authentic jazz, whether [in] the 1920s or [in] later decades. Again, the long-held notion that swing could not occur without syncopation was roundly disproved when trumpeters Louis Armstrong and Bunny Berigan (among others) frequently generated enormous swing while playing repeated, unsyncopated quarter notes.”[25] (bold not in original)\n\n➢ What are the reasons why Gunther Schuller maintains that jazz cannot be defined?\n\nSchuller first claims that if anything is \"constantly evolving and changing,\" it is futile trying to define it. Initially, this might seem like a legitimate reason to reject defining something because if what we are defining keeps changing its properties, then it appears that there is nothing stable enough to identify since definitions are fixed and don't change.\n\nHowever, this turns out to be a weak reason against defining something. Just because things change, by itself, does not make a definition of something impossible. Consider a simple example at first. Can the word \"everything\" be defined and be defined accurately and well? Why, yes, it can. The definition of everything means to include all things of any kind. Dictionary.com reports the meaning of the pronoun \"everything\" as saying “every single thing or every particular of an aggregate or total; all.” Notice that this, on the face of it, would seem to be a perfectly acceptable and correct definition of \"everything.\" If Schuller's constantly evolving objection were legitimate, then the pronoun \"everything\" could not be defined because \"everything is constantly changing and evolving,\" although correct is irrelevant to the possibility (and actuality) of being able to determine what \"everything\" as a pronoun means. For two more similar counter-arguments, see Ontdef3. Arguments for the impossibility of defining jazz where it is argued automobile can be defined even though the car industry evolves and incorporates new unforeseen styles of cars, same things with motorcycles, and also Ontdef8. What is a bicycle?. Since the word \"bicycle\" can be defined even though new styles of bikes come into existence, the production of new unforeseen forms will not make it impossible to have a satisfactory definition.\n\n➢ Why does he think that jazz definitions must be doomed to failure?\n\nSchuller claims that any definition of jazz at an earlier phase can be \"inappropriate\" when applied to a later jazz period.\n\n“[a] definition [of jazz] that might apply to one phase—for instance, to New Orleans style or swing—becomes inappropriate when applied to another segment of its history, say, to free jazz. (bold not in original)\n\n➢ What would make a jazz definition unsuitable, according to Schuller?\n\nPresumably, Schuller believes that were one to use swing as a necessary component of jazz, and if free jazz doesn't swing, then free jazz couldn't qualify as jazz. Yet, it is clear from his assertions that Schuller accepts that free jazz qualifies as jazz; therefore, one should not use swing to pick out all and only jazz and, this is, indeed, what Schuller then claims!\n\nBut who says swing is the correct definition for all of jazz? Swing is a non-starter as an intrinsic property for all jazz, if not all jazz swings, which Schuller already concedes.\n\nSo, on this recommendation, don't use swing as the vital component for a definition of jazz. Nothing follows from failed attempts at a definition that would establish that defining jazz is impossible. (For more discussion on the impossibility of defining jazz see PoJ.fm's Ontdef2. Arguments for the impossibility of defining jazz and Ontmeta8. On the impossibility of definition).\n\nFurthermore, if Schuller accepts this reasoning that jazz is always an unstable musical genre, would it not follow that jazz should present quite a challenge to recognize. Yet Schuller, just as he had first defined jazz while denying that it was possible to do so, again appears to contradict himself when he claims jazz is \"instantly recognizable\" and distinguishable from \"all other musical forms.\" How could this be possible if the subject was always \"changing phases\"?\n\n“Jazz, in fact, is not—and never has been—an entirely composed, predetermined music, nor is it an entirely extemporized one. For almost all of its history, it has employed both creative approaches in varying degrees and endless permutations. And yet, despite these diverse terminological confusions, jazz seems to be instantly recognized and distinguished as something separate from all other forms of musical expression. To repeat Armstrong's famous reply when asked what swing meant: \"If you have to ask, you'll never know.\" To add to the confusion, there often have been seemingly unbridgeable perceptual differences between the producers of jazz (performers, composers, and arrangers) and its audiences. For example, with the arrival of free jazz and other latter-day, avant-garde manifestations, many senior musicians maintained that music that didn't swing was not jazz.[26] (bold not in original)\n\nSchuller may have had a different sort of argument in mind when he said that a “definition [of jazz] that might apply to one phase—for instance, to New Orleans style or swing—becomes inappropriate when applied to another segment of its history, say, to free jazz.” The background assumption required by his claim is that jazz develops different forms over time. The type of example he could have in mind would be if a chair existed for a time, and then a carpenter turned it into a small boat that you couldn't reasonably sit upon any longer as a chair 🪑. The previous criteria for being a chair would be inappropriate for evaluating a boat because using a chair criteria would not be an appropriate evaluative means for assessing the qualities and definition of a boat 🚣 . So, one can see that if this, namely, an earlier style of jazz's definition will not include unforeseen future radical differences in a later phase of jazz, then an initial definition for chair would be a flawed and inappropriate criterion for evaluating a future-developed boat for either the boat's chair worthiness or its boathood.\n\nStill, jazz is hybrid music consisting of a merging of the European diatonic musical scale with an African pentatonic one. Throughout its history, jazz has incorporated and absorbed multiple musical influences from numerous, even incompatible, musical genres, including gospel, folk, blues, ring shouts, call and response, marches, and many more. Thus, perhaps jazz is like a chair boat, which helps explain some of the challenges involved in pinning jazz down.\n\nThings can change over time more slowly so that it is easier to imagine the two falling under the same category.\n\n➢ What things maintain their identity because of slow changes resulting in opposing properties?\n\nA top choice has got to be humans, their bodies and their personhood, with slow changes to an individual maintaining its identity over time, resulting in having opposing properties at different times. For example, start with the human body. Except for unusual alternative philosophical perspectives, the generally accepted view is that it is the same human body from fetal formation up through death 💀. Evaluators who are biologically knowledgeable about human reproduction and human anatomy count the early formation of a unit structure from both parents remaining the same physical body because of its causal connections throughout its organically functioning (you're alive) existence. Yet, this same human body over time can have at different times contradictory properties. At birth, a head could be mostly bald, later in life completely hairy on the top of the head, then when old, one could go back to being bald. How can the same object be both hairless and non-bald? The answer is that this object has these oppositional properties at different times. The same sailing ship could first be unpainted, then painted. The paint of the ship could first be all-white 🛳 , later the same ship can be painted black . Similarly, this same type of phenomena can occur for personal identity. At one time, the very same person could first be an introvert, then later in life be an extrovert. A person could have a charming, bubbly personality, but later in life, be all gloom and doom.\n\nCould the musical genre of jazz be like this? At one time, jazz doesn't swing, then later it does, and even later after that, it doesn't swing again? It may be possible given that Dixieland doesn't swing, then big bands do, then free jazz doesn't, if each of them still counts as being the same musical genre over time, namely each is jazz.\n\nWhile it is partially true that some musicians rejected free jazz because it didn't swing, we cannot use this to rule out free jazz as a jazz sub-genre because plenty of jazz besides free jazz doesn't swing, as Gunther Schuller concedes when he states that swing and syncopation can be missing from \"authentic jazz,\" as said in the quotation above opening this section. Much earlier jazz before swing big band music didn't swing, and some contemporary straight-ahead jazz has no swing rhythm. Swing is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for performing jazz. See \"What are not sufficient conditions for jazz,\" and because jazz can exist that doesn't swing, it cannot be a necessary condition either.\n\nNot all theorists agree with this. French music critic Hughes Panassié (1912–1974) held that swing was a requirement for jazz.\n\nHughes Panassié+++++++++ (1912–1974)\n\n(Details of photographs by William P. Gottlieb)\n\nThat this is so for Panassié, confirmed by quotations found in Jeffrey H. Jackson's Jazz French: Music and Modern Life in Interwar Paris (2008) whenever we broach the issue. For Panassié, any music that doesn't swing cannot qualify as jazz, as he makes crystal clear below:\n\n“According to Panassié, jazz music represented a fundamental rupture in the stream of European musical style, and it demanded both a new kind of listener and a different critical audience to appreciate it. The question that the new, modern audience must ask itself is whether the music \"swings.\" \"Where there is no swing,\" Panassié explained, \"there can be no authentic jazz.\" Panassié attempted, largely in vain, to describe this quality of the music. Swing \"is a sort of 'swinging' of the rhythm and melody which makes for great dynamic power,\" he said. It is syncopation and dance, he suggested, and therefore not necessarily inherent in the melody or in how it is played. Quoting an article by Mougin, Panassié agreed that \"swing is the swinging between the strong beat and the weak beat—or beats—in a measure.\" Such definitions were clearly tautological, but Panassié insisted that anyone acquainted with swing could recognize it objectively. Nevertheless, he quickly pointed out its subjective nature and the fact that \"such a way of playing cannot be acquired by conscientious study.\" \"Swing is a gift,\"—he remarked, \"either you have it deep within yourself, or you don't have it at all.\" On this basis, Panassié dismissed bands such as Hylton's—a recurring foil in his book—that lacked the fundamental component of swing. \"An orchestra like Hylton's,\" he quipped, \"does not, please notice, make bad jazz; it is not jazz at all.\" And he excluded the \"symphonic style\" of Gershwin and others from \"real jazz\" as only \"distantly related to hot music.\"[27] (bold and bold italic not in original)\n\nAccording to Panassié, swing could not be \"acquired by conscientious study.\" Panassié's claim should come as quite a surprise to music faculty who have been teaching their jazz students how to swing for the past fifty years, at least. Enough said. So, swing is teachable, and it does not require an innate ability. When Panassié claims that \"either you have it [swing] deep within yourself, or you don't have it at all,\" this can be proven false. Start with a beginning jazz student who does not yet know how to swing, then teach him or her how to swing, and then the proof is that before being shown, he or she could not swing, but after instruction and training, the student now can swing musically. Our thought experiment proves that swing is not innate and can be acquired through education and training, as has now been known by jazz students and jazz faculty for at least the last fifty years.\n\n“No music could be real jazz if it did not swing, but there was more than one way for a band to do so. Real jazz could be played straight or hot. To play \"straight\" meant \"playing the piece just as it is written, without modifying it.\" Straight performances were tied to the notes on the page, yet they could be done in a swinging style. To play hot \"means to play with warmth, with heat.' and was based on variations of melody and intonation that were improvised anew with each performance.\" Although both hot and straight were still real jazz because both were based on swing, Panassié elevated hot music as the ultimate form. It came from the personalized interpretation of a composition given to it by each musician rather than merely playing the notes as they appeared on the page. Hot jazz, he said, came from the musician's soul.[27] (bold and bold italic not in original)\n\nNat Hentoff (1925–2017)\n\n(Nat Hentoff in 2004. Photograph: K.G. Schneider/Flickr)\n\nEven in 1958, jazz writer and music critic Nat Hentoff finds Panassié's parochial tastes too limiting if they end up eliminating from the jazz pantheon the musical works and jazz musicians from the later and more modern jazz sounds of Bebop and beyond, including the improvisational mastery of Charlie \"Yardbird\" Parker, or the fiery trumpet work of Dizzy Gillespie, or the many modern styles of jazz represented by the music of Miles Davis.\n\n“In view of Panassié's religious belief that most modern jazz isn't jazz at all, do not expect to find any records by [Charlie] Parker, [Dizzy] Gillespie, [Miles] Davis, etc.[28] (bold and bold italic not in original)\n\n➢ Who counts as legitimate jazz musicians, according to Panassié's discography of jazz?\n\nNat Hentoff tells us some of the musicians Panassié includes in his jazz discography:\n\n“There are large sections for [Duke] Ellington, Coleman Hawkins, ​[Fletcher] Henderson, [Jimmy] Lunceford, [Count] Basie, Big Bill (Bissonnette), [Earl \"Fatha\"] Hines, [Fats] Waller, and [Chick] Webb, among others. The often eerie imbalance caused by Panassié's pontifical taste leads not only to the omission of the moderns but to the inclusion of only four Billie Holiday titles contrasted with over ninety for [Mezz] Mezzrow who is, Panassié assures us, the only white man capable of playing the blues like a Negro.”[28]\n\nIn the \"Preface\" to the 1960's revised and expanded edition of The Real Jazz (initially written in 1942), Panassié emphasizes that he has changed his mind regarding his prior assessments of real jazz players, having been based too much on only hearing white jazz musicians. He now realizes his previous estimates of players resulted from his inexperience in hearing excellent African-American musicians. He now claims INSERT QUOTATION \"jazz is black music\" and what counts as good (he says \"real\") jazz, and he is not so humble as not to contradict his prior estimates of the best jazz players. INSERT QUOTATIONS.\n\nIronically, he is still wrong in his assessments and probably somewhat for the reasons he gives for his previous misjudgments, namely lack of exposure to the music and how it gets produced. He leaves out the modern players of Bebop that were available for hearing from 1946–47 onwards. Indeed, when he wrote the original 1942 volume, we can forgive him since Bebop had not yet been formed. In a revised 1960 edition, Panassié no longer has any excuse for excluding the most modern jazz musicians of this period.\n\nPanassié recognized an essential point about (good) jazz performers. They must themselves be excellent composers because they are improvising concurrently with their playing. (See Ontimpr1. What is improvisation?).\n\n“Panassié emphasized the importance of improvisation to hot jazz precisely because it shifted the traditional balance between composer and performer, thus producing another distinction between jazz and art music.[27] (bold not in original)\n\nHaving made this observation that helps distinguish jazz from non-improvised music, it should be a surprise for Panassié to exclude Beboppers from his jazz universe. The Beboppers were superior improvising composers, plus a fascinating thing about this whole debacle of Panassié's is that much of Bebop did swing! For an outstanding example of a swinging song, listen to \"Star Eyes\" on Amazon or Youtube's original album version of \"Star Eyes\" by the Charlie Parker quartet recorded in 1951 with Miles Davis on trumpet, Walter Bishop, Jr. on piano, Teddy Kotick on double bass, and Max Roach on the drums, or the even hotter live version of \"Star Eyes\" at Youtube.\n\nAnyone who recognizes swing will undoubtedly hear it in this tune. At this point, Panassié could go one of two ways, both disastrous for his exclusion of more modern jazz performers. Either he could agree that \"Star Eyes\" is swinging so counts as jazz, proving Bebop should not automatically be excluded from jazz or all of the modern players who have performed the song, or Panassié could deny that \"Star Eyes\" was a Bebop song, which it is when Bird plays it, so that he would be wrong again.\n\nAssessment of the views of Peter Townsend[edit]\n\nIn his book, Jazz in American Culture (pictured here)\n\nPeter Townsend writes about the question of defining jazz. He seems initially to state that there is no problem defining jazz, then proceeds to cast doubt on that suggestion.\n\n“Statements about jazz beg questions of definition. Jazz is often thought of as being mysterious, elusive, and hard to define. But since the meaning of a word is its use, jazz is no harder to define than anything else (try defining 'popular music,' for example), provided one has decided how to use the word. The preferred definition of jazz in this book stays close to the musical basis for the reasons already stated. But jazz can be defined relatively narrowly or relatively broadly. Some writers have restricted its usage to the musical styles they prefer, like the 1940's revivalists who denied the word 'jazz' to any of the post-New Orleans styles. On the other hand, some recent exponents of Jazz Studies have expanded the term to include the entire phenomenon of jazz, including all its representations, derivatives and social implications. These shifts in the meanings of the word could be made transparent by other signals, such as marking them 'jazz (1),' 'jazz (2)', 'jazz (3),' and so on. It is probably wiser to accept Krin Gabbard's conclusion that jazz is 'the music that large groups of people have called jazz at particular moments in history,' and then to use the word in the sense that emphasizes the qualities that one considers important.”[20] (bold not in original)\n\nWhen Townsend remarks above in his opening sentence that \"statements about jazz beg questions of definition,\" he is not referring to the well-known fallacy by the same name wherein a premise presupposes the truth of its conclusion. Instead, he merely means that someone should ask the question of what is jazz. His second sentence stating that jazz is no harder to define than anything else is implausible. If jazz were so easy to identify, why doesn't Townsend go ahead and define it?\n\nMerely deciding how one will use the word \"jazz\" brings us little closer to defining it successfully. (See Ontmeta8. Stipulative definitions explaining the issues with such definitions). But suppose we follow Townsend's advice and say we decide how we want to use the word \"jazz\" for a style of music that we distinguish from other genres of music that are non-jazz. Now we know how we want to use the word, but there remain unanswered questions as to the features of jazz that can distinguish it from other non-jazz music. Townsend remains mute on this hard question even though he claims not to when he states that his (or anyone's) 'preferred' method for defining jazz \"stays close to the musical basis.\"[20] But what is that musical basis, and how can we use it to distinguish jazz from non-jazz?\n\nAs can be seen, many, many possible musical bases fail sufficiently to distinguish jazz from non-jazz regardless of how jazz gets defined more broadly or more narrowly. (See Ontdef3. What are not sufficient conditions for playing jazz?). Townsend's suggestions do not work whether one tries a narrower or a broader approach. First, consider his narrow proposal of limiting jazz to \"the 1940's revivalists who denied the word 'jazz' to any of the post-New Orleans styles.\"[20] This doesn't work if one believes jazz includes music other than just a New Orleans Dixieland style. If we stuck to this definition, then almost all other music that has been called jazz would be excluded from being jazz, and this is just unacceptable. It would eliminate virtually all jazz music developed since the 1940s, which is the vast majority of music that has been (correctly) thought to be jazz, including Bebop, big band swing, modal, cool, soul, or even the more suspect jazz-rock fusion, smooth jazz, free jazz, and so on. Hence, drawing too narrow a boundary around jazz excludes music that most theorists wish to include at least some other types other than just New Orleans styles of jazz.\n\nTownsend next notes, second, a broader definition of jazz that “expand(s) the term to include the entire phenomenon of jazz including all its representations, derivatives and social implications.”[20] Does this help better to define jazz? Not really. First, music's representations and derivatives are far from being clear. What are these? Is a jazz event a derivative or not? Are Matisse's jazz series of paintings a representation of jazz, and to what extent?[29] Likely Townsend believes that the most significant of these three (representations, derivatives, and social implications) is the social implications. Consider, however, that a genre of music's social implications might mirror and be the same as a different genre of music. Two different types of music could have the same social connections, as may, for example, possibly be true of the equally African-American inspired music labeled the blues. If blues and jazz had comparable social effects, then bringing in social implications may well not permit distinguishing jazz from non-jazz. Furthermore, suppose that both of the following claims were true: (T1) Free jazz is a form of jazz, but (T2) Free jazz has some different social implications (as well as various representations and derivatives) than other types of straight-ahead jazz. If true, and it is incredibly likely that it is, social implication differences are irrelevant for defining jazz were (T1) to be accurate, which it probably is since free jazz has less overall social acceptability than has straight-ahead jazz. On this basis, free jazz could not be considered jazz were these social implications of free jazz different than those for straight-ahead jazz, thereby contradicting (T1).\n\nTownsend then finally settles on accepting a suggestion by Krin Gabbard's that “jazz is \"the music that large groups of people have called jazz at particular moments in history\" and then to use the word in the sense that emphasizes the qualities that one considers important.”[20] Neither of these suggestions is useful or acceptable for defining jazz. We cannot just accept as an intellectually satisfying definition of jazz that it is a music determined by what people have called jazz since some music that has used the nom de plume of jazz, such as acid jazz, turned out not to be jazz. (See Ontdef3. Why 'so-called' acid jazz is not a sub-genre of jazz). Emphasizing the conditions that you think are important is just as much another failed suggestion if the qualities you find essential are found in other music genres besides jazz. If you believe that swing were essential to jazz, it turns out that this feature is unhelpful for defining jazz since some non-jazz music has swing, such as rockabilly music or western swing, and some jazz fails to swing as does much modern mainstream jazz, not to mention free jazz or Latin jazz.\n\n“A related premise of this book is that what is called jazz is, in any case, a certain segment or area selected out of a continuous terrain of American musical styles. It has no precise boundaries, and at its fringes it shades off into a range of other musics. The territory of jazz touches 'pop' music, 'country' music, the blues, 'classical' music, rock and roll, and so on, and at times can hardly be distinguished from them. There are styles and artists that pose questions about boundaries and classifications: was Frank Sinatra a jazz singer? Was Louis Jordan a jazz musician? Was 'Western Swing' part of jazz or of country music? The idea of the limits of a music like jazz, of its boundaries, should be reassessed in the way that Gregory Nobles proposes for the idea of the 'frontier': as an area characterized by a 'complex pattern of human contact,' not simply as a cut-off point between well-defined separate entities!”[30] (bold not in original)\n\nRegarding the boundaries of jazz as a style of music, Townsend may well be correct that when we get into more fringe types of musical areas that jazz can be more undetermined as jazz. Paul Rinzler supports the idea that jazz boundaries can be ragged in his masterwork, The Contradictions of Jazz, where Rinzler defends that one should understand jazz as having a fuzzy logic whereby jazz can be along a continuum with varying strengths and degrees of jazz. Still, Townsend appears to go too far if he believes that there are times when jazz “can hardly be distinguished from” pop music, or country, the blues, classical music, or rock and roll. While it is true that Third Stream is a combination of classical music and jazz and jazz/rock fusion synthesizes jazz with rock, it still is hyperbolic to proclaim that jazz and these other forms at the fringes cannot be distinguished from each other.\n\nTownsend continues his development of these lines of thought by marking jazz out as a region of music.\n\n“Jazz is more like a region than a nation. Nevertheless, it is still possible to state some positive characteristics that mark out the region. For positive definitions, one can refer to a useful brief version by Lewis Porter: \"Jazz is a form of art music developed by black Americans around 1900 that draws upon a variety of sources from Africa, Europe, and America.\" Jazz as a segment of American music is, by a consensus of most writers, identifiable by reference to its rhythms, its repertoire, its use of improvisation and its approach to instrumental sound and technique, and these features are reflected in the description of jazz as a music in Chapter 1.”[30] (bold and bold italic not in original)\n\nStaying with his fundamental approach of defining jazz in musical terms, Townsend proposes to accept what he finds to be a \"useful version\" for determining jazz put forth by Lewis Porter. If we evaluate Porter's suggestion as a way to define jazz, it is easy to see that Porter's description remains unsuccessful for the primary reason that it applies equally to blues music that was also primarily developed by African-Americans around the turn of the century with musical sources deriving from Africa (using a pentatonic scale), Europe (using a diatonic musical scale), and (North) American influences (work songs, call and response, gospel, and so forth).\n\nLastly, the idea that jazz can be identified by its rhythms, repertoire, improvisational sonic techniques, and approaches is welcomed, but also cannot be by themselves either necessary or sufficient conditions for jazz. (See Ontdef3. What are necessary conditions for playing jazz? and Ontdef3. What are not sufficient conditions for playing jazz?). Is there such a thing as a distinctive jazz rhythm only used in jazz music? This doesn't sound correct. Certainly, repertoire cannot distinguish jazz from non-jazz because many jazz standards came from non-jazz songs, such as Sonny Rollins's \"I'm an Old Cowhand\" from Rollin's album \"Way Out West,\" or his jazz version of \"Surrey with the Fringe on Top,\" or all of the jazzers who covered it, or John Coltrane's \"My Favorite Things\" from the non-jazz musical \"The Sound of Music\" that no one considered this song to be jazz until performed by Coltrane.[31] Many non-jazz kinds of music incorporate improvisation into their respective non-jazz musical genres, including Indian ragas from Indian classical music, country, blues, rock, rap, and on and on. Hence, while certainly relevant to jazz, Porter's list does not yet constitute a definition that would pick out all and only jazz.\n\nAssessment of the views of Joel Dinerstein[edit]\n\nJoel Dinerstein, author of numerous tomes on coolness, when reviewing John Gennari's book, Blowing Hot and Cold, holds that jazz critics managed a \"unique intellectual achievement\" by developing, shaping, and codifying the 'formal categories' by which jazz is to be analyzed and understood. Here is how he puts these claims:\n\n“Blowin’ Hot and Cool [by John Gennari] simultaneously functions as a history of jazz, an intellectual history of jazz, and a survey of jazz discourses—no small feat—all as rendered through the guru of the jazz critic. As opposed to jazz musicians, who have often refused to categorize jazz, “emphasiz[ing] the social messages embodied in the music,” the achievement of a personal sound, and “jazz . . . as a form of communal bonding, [and] ritual,” jazz critics have inhabited a range of modernist stances predicated on cross-racial exchange. [John] Gennari casts the music’s white proselytizers, columnists, and impresarios along a continuum of paternalism, patronage, friendship, primitivism, and vernacular patriotism, and its black writers and impresarios (Amiri Baraka, Stanley Crouch) as tightrope walkers of integrationist and separatist ideologies, cultural affirmation and diasporic identity, neoclassicism and avant-gardism. From the moment John Hammond and Leonard Feather stepped into the Savoy Ballroom in 1935 with the explicit intention not to dance but to listen—“the Ur-stance of the jazz critic”—they positioned themselves as discursive gatekeepers “distinct from the dancing mass body, caught up in an imagined sense of privileged intellectual and emotional communion with the music.” Gennari seeks neither to redeem nor delegitimize their cultural work but to highlight their unique intellectual achievement: they shaped an undervalued popular music into a vernacular art music by successfully creating the formal categories through which the music is understood.[32] (bold and bold italic not in original)\n\n➢ Is it true that jazz writers and critics are fully responsible for the categories used to analyze and appreciate jazz?\n\nDoesn't this emphasis on jazz writers and critics (presumably for both Gennari and Dinerstein) production of formal jazz categories and concepts used to 'understand' jazz ignore another important causal source for jazz category analytical constructions, namely the jazz musicians and their compositions themselves? Don't we want to give some credit to the performers of the music themselves, and not just to the people who write about jazz phenomena? Should not Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, Stan Kenton, Ornette Coleman, etc. be given credit and responsibility for the, as Dinerstein writes it, development of the \"formal categories through which the music is to be understood\"?\n\nIf the above musicians had not developed their compositions that helped produce bebop, or big band compositions representing themes, such as Ellington's \"Black and Tan Fantasy,\" or Mary Lou Williams's 'sacred music,' or the harmolodic style of music developed by Ornette Coleman and his players, or George Russell's, \"Jazz in the Space Age,\" third stream style, there would not exist the music that jazz writers and critics end up analyzing with their 'formal categories.' If the music itself did not exist, there would be nothing for the writers to discuss, or anything for that matter to analyze. Doesn't the source for the formal categories, the musicians and musical compositions, themselves shape what those categories are to become? It would seem so.\n\nAssessment of the views of Scott Deveaux and Bill Kirchner[edit]\n\nSome people believe that jazz and its concept may conform to Morris Weitz's (1916–1981) theory[33] of open concepts[34] where the things falling under that concept are unstable because no set of necessary and sufficient conditions can be found that captures all current and future objects that are and will fall under such a concept. (For arguments disputing these claims and showing how games can be defined, see Ontmeta8. Wittgenstein's family resemblance problem and defining jazz). The content of an open concept is continually changing and cannot be pinned down. As soon as anyone can define jazz (or art), a performer will accomplish something in the spirit of jazz outside the current definition, and then it is unclear what to say about this new music, or so it is often claimed.\n\nThis point of view is represented by Scott Deveaux, Professor of Critical & Comparative Studies at the University of Virginia in the McIntyre School of Music, holding that one should avoid defining jazz “in musical terms.”\n\nDeveaux explains:\n\n“Defining jazz is a notoriously difficult proposition, but the task is easier if one bypasses the usual inventory of musical qualities or techniques, like improvisation or swing (since the more specific or comprehensive such a list attempts to be, the more likely it is that exceptions will overwhelm the rule).”[35] (bold not in original)\n\nBut herein lies madness. How else could one come up with a definition of jazz as music if one ignores its \"musical qualities,\" as recommended by Deveaux? Of course, for anyone who thinks that there is nothing in common between different jazz genres and that they have just been lumped together under the jazz umbrella due to historical accidents, this would be a way to ignore jazz's musical qualities. For more discussion on these points, see Ontdef3. Why jazz is not just an institutionally practice-mandated musical genre.\n\nUndaunted, Deveaux continues by providing various reasons for rejecting jazz/rock fusion or free jazz/the new thing/avante-garde as qualifying as jazz. You should be especially sensitive when reading the below quotation for what would appear to be a blatant contradiction in his theory. First, he denies that jazz can be defined, yet below argues that there is nevertheless an \"essential nature to jazz\" and then second, adds insult to injury by claiming the essential nature of jazz \"is the process of change itself\" while incredibly denying that jazz fusion and free jazz qualify as jazz even though these are the very changes to which he refers.\n\n“Much as the concept of purity is made more concrete by the threat of contamination, what is not is far more vivid rhetorically than what it is. Thus fusion is \"not Jazz\" because, in its pursuit of commercial success, it has embraced certain musical traits—the use of electric instruments, modern production techniques, and a rock- or funk-oriented rhythmic feeling—that violate the essential nature of jazz. The avant-garde, whatever its genetic connection to the modernism of 1940's bebop, is not jazz—or no longer Jazz—because, in its pursuit of novelty, it has recklessly abandoned the basics of form and structure, even African-American principles like \"swing.\" And the neoclassicist stance is irrelevant, and potentially harmful, to the growth of Jazz because it makes a fetish of the past, failing to recognize that the essence of Jazz is the process of change itself.”[36] (bold not in original)\n\nHow can there be \"contamination\" on Deveaux's jazz views if the nature of jazz is to change? The only way to change is to incorporate 'contaminations' into jazz, so he contradicts himself again.\n\nDeveaux is far far from being alone in rejecting the possibility of defining jazz. For example, this belief that it is fruitless to try to define the nature of jazz music appears to be the view of Bill Kirchner, in his “Introduction” to The Oxford Companion to Jazz, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), 5):\n\n“Throughout the—roughly speaking—century-old history of jazz, there have been numerous attempts to ‘define’ what the music is or isn’t. None of these has ever proven successful or widely accepted, and invariably they tell us much more about the tastes, prejudices, and limitations of the formulators than they do about the music. You’ll find no such attempts here.”[38] (bold and bold italic not in original)\n\nPresentation, analysis, and critique of Alan Lawrence's views on defining jazz[edit]\n\nAt All About Jazz, author Alan Lawrence gives his views on problems with defining jazz in his article What is jazz?. To make it easier to assess the merits of Lawrence's assertions (in green font), critique of his remarks are interspersed in blue font.\n\nWhat is jazz? Those three words form one of the toughest questions in music. Ask a hundred people and you are likely to get as many different answers.\n\nThat there might be diversity in people's answers on how to define jazz is not relevant for whether or not there can be an adequate or useful definition of it. If you asked 100 people to define gall bladder, you would get a lot of blank stares and different answers, but this would in no way show that gall bladder cannot be identified. The gall bladder is the small sac-shaped organ underneath the liver where bile is stored upon secretion by the liver and before its release into the intestine.\n\nIn fact, we don't want to ask random people for their opinions about jazz. Instead, we want to address music experts and especially those knowledgeable about jazz. Here it seems apparent that many many responses from the experts would be in accord with each other. There would be less diversity. Additionally, the fact that some genres of jazz are found suspicious by some experts would not show that of the music that virtually all experts agree is incontestably jazz that there may be something in common with the incontestable jazz that one could use to define it.\n\nFew things have given me more pleasure in life than listening to the music we call jazz. Even after hearing several thousand recordings in over 15 years and seeing countless live shows, I cannot offer a definitive definition of the word \"jazz.\"\n\nThe fact that Alan Lawrence cannot define jazz says nothing about whether or not jazz can be defined. Perhaps Lawrence cannot delineate what is a gall bladder either. Suppose he worked at a butcher shop and had seen thousands of cow gall bladders. It still wouldn't follow from Lawrence's ignorance about the function of a gall bladder that this organ cannot be defined.\n\nThe challenge may lie in the term \"jazz\" itself. Can a living music, one that may well be the most colorful and varied art form in the world, be defined by a single word?\n\nIs this a believable claim? Absolutely not! Art itself in the wide-open art world is much more \"colorful and varied\" than jazz. Art in the art world includes many styles and types of art, from conceptual art to Impressionism and from Pop art to earthwork installations to Christo's wrapped island to Chris Burden having himself shot with a .22 caliber gun in the arm. Now there's some real variety in action with a living art world continually challenging itself, and all of it is under the same one word \"art.\"\n\nSure there are a lot of types of jazz, and for a list, see Ep16. Jazz Sub-Genres and for characterizations of each genre see Ontology: Types of Jazz & Related Musics, but it still doesn't follow that because there are many types of something that the unifying element could not be defined. There are a really vast number of automobile types, but the meaning of \"automobile\" can still be determined. For proof of this and its relevance for delineating jazz see Vehicle Counter-example to the Multiple Styles argument that shows that (S1) Anything with many styles cannot be successfully defined is false.\n\nAfter pondering that question for this feature, I'd have to say no. The music that falls into the jazz idiom takes on infinite faces and influences, including swing, bebop, cool, fusion, smooth, and avant-garde. As jazz spread across the globe, the music took on more and more sounds.\n\nSurely Lawrence is being hyperbolic here when he mentions \"infinity.\" It is certainly false that jazz has had an infinite number of anything related to it. There has not been an infinite number of causal factors creating jazz because there have only been a finite number of events or causes since the beginning of time after the start of the Big Bang in our universe. He then mentions not an infinite number of jazz styles, but a total of six measly jazz types. Jazz as music did spread across the globe and has taken on new sounds and influences from other kinds of music, but not an infinite number of them, which is not even theoretically possible.\n\nLet's go back to our fictional survey of 100 people. What kind of responses would we get? Some may call anything with saxophone or trumpet jazz. Others may base their definition on the feel of the music. Does it swing? Still, others base their views of what defines jazz on the reputation of the musicians. Some say there must be improvisation for it to be jazz.\n\nAs argued above, the mere fact of disagreement amongst people surveyed for their definition of jazz proves nothing other than there is a lack of agreement; it doesn't make it impossible to define something because many things have definitions over which people still disagree, like whether injecting bleach would be effective against Covid-19. We can still define both bleach and Covid-19.\n\nLet's consider these fictional people's responses.\n\nIs any music played with a saxophone or trumpet jazz? This is an absurd answer because musicians use them in many kinds of music other than jazz, such as in classical music or rock and roll.\n\nCan one base a definition for jazz on the \"feel\" of the music? What kind of feel is this? Presumably, Lawrence may have in mind something like, \"If it feels like jazz, then it is jazz (to me).\" This feeling argument has been refuted here at Ontdef4. Unhelpful definitions of jazz - Jazz is a Feeling. Furthermore, this is somewhat ridiculous since many people might think a saxophone solo in a rock song is jazz when it is not jazz. No one should want arbitrary, subjective responses to inform correct answers to any questions, period.\n\nCan swing be the definition for jazz? Absolutely not. Some jazz exists that doesn't swing, such as plenty of modern jazz performances, and some music swings that isn't jazz, such as rockabilly.\n\nJazz can be defined based on the reputation of the musicians doesn't even make any sense because the same musicians might play music in more than one genre. Maybe what Lawrence had in mind is that jazz is the music played by musicians who have a jazz reputation. This won't work any better as a determiner of jazz because these very same musicians sometimes play music that is not jazz, as when sitting in with a rock band, for example.\n\nMusicians achieve improvisations while playing any music styles, so improvisation cannot be sufficient for jazz. See Ontimpr1. What is improvisation? and Does Jazz Have Essential Properties?\n\nThere is little argument that two critical elements of jazz are improvisation and swing. Let's briefly look at each:\n\nUnquestionably, most jazz involves a degree of improvisation. In most jazz settings, someone is usually improvising. But, not all improvised music can be called jazz. The Grateful Dead rarely played what was written, but they certainly are usually not considered a jazz band. Conversely, not all music found in the jazz bins is improvised. Consider some of Duke Ellington's tightly arranged suites. While improvisation is, without a doubt, an integral part of jazz music, it is not an absolute. (For more discussion of improvisation's status in jazz see Ontdef3. Proposed necessary conditions for performing jazz).\n\nLawrence certainly is correct here about improvisation being neither sufficient nor necessary for music to qualify as jazz and for the reasons he supplies. Non-improvised jazz exists (Duke Ellington compositions performed without improvisation), and improvised classical music or blues music is not automatically jazz. For further discussion on necessary and sufficient conditions for jazz, see Are There Any Necessary Conditions For Playing Jazz? and Are There Any Sufficient Conditions For Playing Jazz?\n\nSwing is even harder to define. What is swing? It is a feeling more than a concrete concept. Swing is that element that makes you move your body or want to dance. It is a buoyancy that lives in much of what we call jazz . . . the propulsive beat and forward momentum.\n\nSwing is not just a feeling, and it has a well-defined concept, contrary to Lawrence's assertions. His remarks are better suited to \"being in the groove,\" when the rhythm section players (often piano, bass, and drums) are locked in together and playing an insistent rhythm. The reason swing is not just a feeling is because it is a way to play music by having a particular rhythmic pulse, and rhythmic pulses are not feelings but ways to play music. The concept of swing refers to “a particular rhythmic technique (most commonly associated with jazz but also used in other genres) that involves alternately lengthening and shortening pulse-divisions.” [39] What Lawrence seems to have in mind is the more colloquial use of the word \"swing\" that is better associated with the concept of a \"groove,\" as explained at Wikipedia:\n\n“The term swing has two main uses. Colloquially, it is used to describe the sense of propulsive rhythmic \"feel\" or \"groove\" created by the musical interaction between the performers, especially when the music creates a \"visceral response\" such as feet-tapping or head-nodding (see pulse).”\n\nBut, does jazz always swing? Absolutely not. Anyone familiar with the works of Cecil Taylor or Anthony Braxton knows that their music is the antithesis of swing, yet most would define their music as jazz.\n\nAll true.\n\nSo, that brings us back to the main topic, \"What is jazz?\" In his book \"Jazz Styles,\" Mark Gridley offers that music need only be associated with the jazz tradition to be called jazz. Instead of a strict definition, we use the word \"jazz\" to describe a character of the music. The lines have been blurred. Is Bitches Brew jazz or rock? I'd file it under jazz. My father would call it rock.\n\nCan there be such a thing as a jazz tradition if we don't know which music counts as jazz? It doesn't seem possible. Should we count any music associated with the jazz tradition as jazz? Absolutely not since blues music is associated with the jazz tradition, but it is not jazz. Is Miles Davis's album \"Bitches Brew\" jazz? Well, it is jazz-rock fusion, so both Lawrence and his father are correct to that extent at least.\n\nWhat you call jazz, I might not consider jazz at all. I can't tell you how many times I mention my love of jazz, only to hear, \"Oh, I love Kenny G.\" To me, Kenny G and the rest of his so-called smooth jazz cronies do not play jazz. It certainly neither swings nor contains much, if any, improvisation. To them, Cecil Taylor or Sun Ra is the furthest thing from jazz. They might think it is noise.\n\nKenny G. probably improvises more than Lawrence believes. Is smooth jazz jazz? It is most likely true that smooth jazz is just a watered down version of jazz.\n\nBottom line: If it feels like jazz to you ---- It is jazz. That's the beauty of this music! (bold and bold italic not in original)\n\nCould there be any worse conclusion? The assertion is baldfacedly false. People cannot just call any kind of music jazz because they \"feel like it\" and always be correct. There is plenty of music that is not jazz, period! Lawrence was trying to put a positive spin about jazz as his concluding sentence, and for this, he can be forgiven, but not his reasons, which are bogus.\n\nCritique of Donal Fox's definition of jazz at AllAboutJazz.com[edit]\n\nTo make it easier to assess the merits of Donal Fox's assertions (printed in green font), PoJ.fm intersperses critique of his remarks in blue font.\n\n\"Thinking Outside The Musical Box\" by Donal Fox 🦊\n\nDonal Fox's essay is a spirited defense supporting creativity in music production for which we can all agree. Nevertheless, he makes claims about jazz that PoJ.fm takes to task.\n\n“What is jazz? It is a state of mind, a spiritual quest for true unfettered artistic expression, a human expression of individual freedom, social freedom, and love. Jazz is also about diversity. Diversity is important, isn't it? We expect it in our social lives. We demand respect and honor in our society as artists and as human beings because we need to help maintain equality and social justice among all the people of the world. In our music and in the jazz community, we must strive to honor and respect our musical diversity as well. (bold not in original)\n\nLet's go through Fox's list one at a time. Is jazz a \"state of mind\"? A state of mind can include many different types of mental states, including attitudes, perspectives, outlooks, approaches, moods, dispositions, frames of mind, mindsets, or way of looking at things. These are not all the same because some are intellectual cognitions, while others are emotional.\n\nMust one be in any particular state of mind to play jazz? There is little reason to believe so because one can be playing music and have opposing mindsets at different times. One could play a jazz tune while happy, then later while sad or morose. It might affect one's playing and sound, but it could be jazz both times, even with opposing mindsets.\n\nCONCLUSION: There are no states of mind one must be in to play jazz, other than those required for effective music-making.\n\nMany excellent improvisers such as Kenny Werner or Kenny Barron claim to clear their minds as much as possible, i.e., no mindsets at all, before they improvise so that their thoughts and states of consciousness are not blocking, getting in the way, or interfering with the flow of musical ideas during performances.\n\nSpiritual quests for artistic expression are virtuous. Can they only be achieved while playing jazz? Hardly. Does jazz achieve individual freedom? Many jazz musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker felt constrained playing jazz in big bands while feeling freer when playing in smaller combos.\n\nDiversity is another good thing. Does jazz aid in promoting equality and social justice? Perhaps to some extent, it does, yet institutional racism exists in the 21st century throughout the world, even with jazz now a global phenomenon.\n\nEach of these categories, \"states of mind,\" \"spiritual quest for artistic freedom,\" \"social freedom,\" \"love,\" and \"diversity\" can be associated with many other things besides jazz. Do these qualities help to define or describe jazz as a musical form? No, they do not. At best, these items are ethical values to support. Many of the arts besides jazz, such as painting, dance, or rock and roll, can support love (in the lyrics of a song), and be promoters of artistic expression, social diversity, and equality. Hence, these factors do not delineate jazz from other arts or of different types of music.\n\nWhat is jazz? Improvisation is definitely an essential element. Remove creative improvisation and we don't have jazz. Jazz has a strong improvisational quality that has developed into a very sophisticated art form. The skill that a musician needs to play their instrument in order to successfully render and navigate the music's rhythmical structures and melodic designs with the utmost of virtuosity is nearly unparalleled in other music. (bold not in original)\n\nTechnically, being an 'essential element' typically means the specification of a necessary ingredient for identity. Improvisation, by itself, is neither sufficient nor necessary for playing jazz. (See Ontdef3. Are there Any Necessary Conditions for Playing Jazz?) Neither is improvisation sufficient for jazz (since many musical genres besides jazz improvise, as in country music, the blues, or Indian ragas, nor a necessary condition since some jazz tunes are sometimes played straight to the musical score. (See Ontdef3. What are not Sufficient Conditions for Playing Jazz).\n\nCONCLUSION: Some jazz is not improvised, proving improvisation is not a necessary condition for jazz. On the other hand, some non-jazz music—blues, rock, Indian ragas, country—is improvised, proving that improvisation fails to be sufficient for playing jazz.\n\nFox commits himself to improvisation as a necessary condition for jazz when he claims that its removal eliminates jazz. Interestingly, Fox's argument supporting the claim switches from focusing on music to a jazz musician needing to be a capable improviser, which is an entirely different claim. PoJ.fm has already pointed out that improvisation is not necessary for jazz (see the discussion about (N6) and (N7) at Ontdef3. Proposed necessary conditions for playing jazz) while agreeing that all capable jazz musicians must be improvisers.\n\nSwing is another important element of the music, but if it doesn't 'swing,' does that mean it is not jazz? Sometimes focusing on swing and the periodic rhythms of swing can interfere with the poetic expression and flow of the sound and structure of the music. Some of the greatest jazz ballads have been most soulful when not swung. (bold not in original)\n\nHere Fox concedes that not all jazz must swing or have a swing rhythm, so swing is not essential to jazz.\n\nWhat about dynamics, musical narrative, textual variety, harmonic colorings, rhythmical counterpoint, etc.? Jazz is an art form, and clearly distinct from today's popular musical forms in its emotional and harmonic complexity, instrumental virtuosity, structure, and architectural exploration. We know this. The petty arguments and in-fighting among various factions among colleagues and in the jazz music industry must stop. United we stand and divided we fall! The proverbial pie is too small to be split up any more than it already is. We must all learn truly to think \"outside the box.\" We need diversity. Free jazz, straight-ahead jazz, Latin jazz, experimental jazz, hip hop jazz, jazz electronica, soul-jazz, post-bop jazz, European jazz, etc. the list goes on. As Duke Ellington said, there are only two types of music: good music and bad. Or, as my friend and colleague Oliver Lake likes to say, \"Put all my food on one plate! What kinda music you play? The good kind!\" (bold not in original)\n\nWe can find this list of musical features in all sorts of genres of music besides jazz. Classical music performed by a full orchestra might perform a non-jazz piece of music containing everything in Fox's list: dynamics, narrative, variety of textures, harmonic colorations using rhythmical counterpoint.\n\nIs jazz \"clearly distinct from today's popular musical forms\"? Is hip hop jazz actually 'clearly distinct' from jazz?\n\nFox proposes that contemporary jazz has more \"emotional and harmonic complexity, instrumental virtuosity, structure, and architectural exploration\" than pop music. Some pop music still without being jazz has emotional complexity for sure. In fact, in a 2012 publication \"Emotional Cues in American Popular Music: Five Decades of the Top 40,\"[40] by University of Toronto psychologist of music, Dr. Glenn Schellenberg, and sociologist of emotions at the Institute for Sociology at Freie Universität Berlin Prof. Dr. Christian von Scheve found that over the past few decades emotional complexity in pop music has drastically increased by switching from major keys to minor ones, as reported by psychologist Dr. Christian Jarrett.\n\n“The researchers analyzed the tempo (fast or slow) and mode (major or minor) of the most popular 1,010 pop songs identified using year-end lists published by Billboard magazine in the USA from 1965 to 2009. Tempo was determined using the beats per minute of a song, and where this was ambiguous, the researchers used the rate at which you’d clap along. The mode of the song was identified from its tonic chord – the three notes played together at the outset, in either minor or major. Happy sounding songs are typical of fast tempo in a major mode, whilst sad songs are slow and in a minor. Songs can also be emotionally ambiguous, having a tempo that’s fast in minor, or vice versa.\n\nSchellenberg and von Scheve found that the proportion of songs recorded in minor-mode has increased, doubling over the last fifty years. The proportion of slow tempo hits has also increased linearly, reaching a peak in the 90s. There’s also been a decrease in unambiguously happy-sounding songs and an increase in emotionally ambiguous songs.”[41] (bold and bold italic not in original)\n\nAnd NPR's correspondent Alix Spiegel explains how this has increased the emotional complexity of pop music.\n\n“But through the 1980s and '90s, the dominance of the major key in the Top 40 began to shift, slowly at first and then quite radically: \"By 2009,\" Schellenberg says, \"only 18 out of [the Top] 40 [songs] were a major key.\" That means that the majority of the Top 40 songs, 22 of 40, were in a minor key—the official sound of complexity and sadness. Consider \"Dead and Gone\" by the rapper T.I., which hit No. 12 on the charts in 2009. In a way, the message of the song is pretty positive; it's a song about leaving behind self-destructive behavior. But the minor key makes the song sound foreboding.[42] (bold and bold italic not in original)\n\nStill, Fox is right to believe that contemporary jazz usually has higher instrumental virtuosity, more complex structures, and more 'architectural' explorations than most pop music. However, classical music with a large orchestra can have all of these features as well, so they are not unique to jazz and cannot be used to delineate all and only jazz.\n\nI've heard great pop, and I have heard completely uninspired, bad jazz. Jazz is not immune from mediocrity and the mundane. Playing jazz technically well doesn't exempt you from faltering into the world of mediocrity. Beware. Music needs unfettered imagination. Don't let the genre police and the jazz police influence or dictate your expressive desires. As musicians and artists, we must maintain our quest for spiritual and dialectical truth. I call on all artists and musicians to reach deep into your creative souls and imagination and find and nurture your individual voices. We need to share these inner voices with the world. The world needs our voices! If a musician has searched and developed a concept and sound that you don't particularly agree with or like, make sure that you show respect for his sincere and skillful need for expression and diversity of thought. (bold not in original)\n\nJazz musicians do strive to \"find and nurture their own individual musical instrumental 'voices'.\" Fox rightly asks everyone to keep more of an open mind when hearing expressively skillful new music. An example might be Shabaka Hutching's Sons of Kemet, who use the unusual lineup of two drummers, a tuba and a saxophone.\n\nThey have been nominated and won several prestigious awards, such as Best Jazz Act at the United Kingdom's 2013 MOBO Awards.\n\nWe are all one musical family: Wynton Marsalis and Henry Threadgill, Jason Moran and Marian McPartland, Cecil Taylor and Brad Mehldau, Bob Belden and Butch Morris, Joe Lovano and John Zorn. Support and cherish our musical diversity and honor our differences and be joyous in the abundance of creative imagination that jazz brings to the cultural, artistic, musical and social landscape. We need it in our art, and we need it in our lives. (bold not in original)\n\nOf the musicians just listed, only Wynton Marsalis, Henry Threadgill, Jason Moran, Brad Mehldau, Joe Lovano, and John Zorn are still alive in 2020.\n\n“Swing is a relative thing. Remember, most music critics didn't think John Coltrane was swinging when they first heard him. \"Sheets of sound,\" they would say, or Elvin Jones’s polyrhythms were incomprehensible to the straight-ahead cats. To them, it wasn't swinging. What do they know? Most critics tend to be behind the eight ball anyway. We create. They follow. A follower cannot lead. Think outside the box. Express your musical thoughts with sincere conviction. Don't worry about critics and the status quo constantly imposing a type of conformity upon our creative impulses. All artists, young and old, search for the unknown. Strive to find the artistic truth that lies within you, and once determined, create without fear.\n\nDonal Fox is a composer, pianist, conductor, arranger, and educator.

To make it easier to assess the merits of Pingouin's assertions (printed in green font), PoJ.fm intersperses critique of his remarks in blue font.\n\n“[\"Jazz\"] It's a loaded word. The word \"jazz\" for at least some people may well satisfy the definition of an item of loaded language, defined as \"words, set phrases or idioms that have strong positive or negative connotations beyond their ordinary definitions.\" Uncomfortably for the term \"jazz,\" there may not be any ordinary definitions for this word, so it would not technically satisfy this definition for being loaded language. Nevertheless, Pingouin wishes to emphasize that the word \"jazz\" can have some negative connotations for some people who find jazz to be disreputable in sundry ways. It means something, but the meaning has gotten twisted over the decades, for the profit of some and to the irritation of others. If it means something, then tell us what it means; otherwise, this is not a helpful remark. You might see a \"jazz musician\" in a television commercial, maybe a twentysomething black man, well-groomed, in nice clothes, invariably playing a saxophone; whatever the product is, this is some attempt to imbue it with \"sophistication\" or some sort of \"mature,\" no-green-hair hipness. You might see, in some other commercial, an older jazzman, black, of course, in nice clothes that invoke an earlier era of hip. A fedora or pork-pie hat speaks a thousand Madison Avenue words. So that's jazz. Jazz is hip and sophisticated. You need read no further. OK, jazz is hip and sophisticated, but so can other genres of music, so this does not delineate or better help define the nature of jazz per se.\n\nActually, that's just a lie used to sell you stuff (including CDs). Jazz is neither hip nor sophisticated; it's just music. Now, this is odd. Is the argument that we should rule out any music that is hip and sophisticated from being considered jazz? That seems like a lousy reason since some people see jazz as a hip and sophisticated music. It is undoubtedly sophisticated when that term gets defined under any of these definitions from dictionary.com as either:\n\n(1) of a person, ideas, tastes, manners, altered by education or experience, so as to be worldly-wise and not naive,\n\n(2) pleasing or satisfactory to the tastes of sophisticates, or people who are educated, cultured, and worldly-wise, as in sophisticated music,\n\n(3) complex or intricate, as a system, process, piece of machinery, or the like, or\n\n(4) of, for, or reflecting educated taste, knowledgeable use.\n\nJazz musicians are not naive musically because it takes a lot of training and worldly musical experience to play good jazz. Many sophisticates admire jazz, satisfying definition (2). Jazz is a complex musical form with many intricate techniques, thereby meeting definition (3). Jazz's music language requires knowledgeable use by educated musicians satisfying definition (4). There are traits that vary from era to era, but there is a commonality to those traits that transcends the epochs. If there are such common traits, why not inform us as to what they consist? What are these common traits that 'transcend' any epoch?\n\nThere's improvisation at the center of it all. Pingouin is correct that jazz improvisations are central for any competent jazz musician. Any jazz musician who cannot improvise is considered a poor player of jazz. This makes improvisation essential and therefore 'central' to jazz as musical practice. First and foremost, improvisation refers to the spontaneous creation of melody and of its rhythm. Traditionally, that creation was buttressed by a framework - a song, with its preset melody and chords. An improviser solos, i.e., creates a new melody based on those chords; singers became part of the mix, thanks a great deal to Louis Armstrong, who evolved a vocal translation of his trumpet style, influencing singers like Billie Holiday and Bing Crosby, and just about any other jazz singer since. Pingouin makes an excellent point that improvisation can be the spontaneous creation of melody or rhythm, often based on a song's chord structure. However, as he is aware, not every improvisation uses chord structures, as free improvisations in free jazz do not. Louis Armstrong's scatting did not influence Billie Holiday per se since she did not herself scat, although Pingouin is correct that Armstrong's singing style influenced many vocalists.\n\nBut even the background was improvised. The remaining musicians often had only the melody and chords to fall back on, just the basics one would find on a minimally-scored piece of sheet music, so there was no indication of, say, how exactly the drummer should keep the 4/4 time, or what exact notes the pianist should play to voice the E Major chord. These are excellent observations showing the need for jazz musicians to be prepared and flexible to create music with other musicians by bringing their talents to make music to the fore where it was not all pre-scripted beforehand. In early jazz, you also had horns improvising melodies in support of the lead (or soloist) horn, a concept of collective improvisation brought back over the decades in various forms, like the contrapuntal duets of Gerry Mulligan and Chet Baker, and, in its most enduring form, the all-out each-in-one's-own-musical-plane simultaneity of free jazz, often far removed from the song form and blues roots of earlier forms, but still containing the ineffable essence of jazz. Here we see that Pingouin agrees that free jazz qualifies as jazz because it contains the “ineffable essence of jazz.” What, though, is this? He does not justify the claim that there is something ineffable here, meaning \"incapable of being expressed or described in words; inexpressible.\" There is always something paradoxical about such a usage because \"ineffable\" is itself a word therefore the ineffable can be described in word(s), contrary to its own definition. Furthermore, since essence means \"basic, real, and invariable nature of a thing or its significant individual feature or features\" if there are no features or nature, then there cannot be an essence. If something is ineffable then it cannot have features since if it had features they could be described using words making the object under consideration fail to be ineffable. But if it's just about improvisation, that means Merle Haggard (from the tradition of \"country jazz\", i.e. the Western Swing of Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys) and Eric Clapton (improvisational roots in the blues, without which there would be no jazz) are jazz musicians too, right? Maybe so. That's part of the problem: if there is no \"jazz police\", patrolling the streets with eternal vigilance, then everything can ultimately call itself jazz. There need not be any police involved. It is not whether something can be 'called' by the name of jazz, but whether calling it jazz is correct. The so-called jazz police will end up being everybody interested in truth. Can rock and roll as performed by Eric Clapton be correctly called jazz? No, it cannot. If improvisation was a sufficient condition for jazz (which it isn't--see What are not sufficient conditions for playing jazz) then as Pingouin points out, it would be jazz. Just because improvisation is central to jazz fails to make it a sufficient condition for performing jazz since many non-jazz musical genres also use improvisation, as Pingouin has pointed out. Therefore, not just \"maybe not,\" but just not for whether Bob Wills or Eric Clapton are playing jazz while improvising in non-jazz musical genres like Western Swing or Rock and Roll.\n\nJazz harmony, for most of the 20th Century, has been based on seventh chords: a root note, with three other notes, successively a third higher than the previous one. The \"seventh\" comes from the fact that that last note is a seventh away from the root. The flavor of the chord comes mainly from the quality of the underlying triad - major, minor, diminished, or augmented. Jazz harmony is more complex than just being based on 7th chords. So Steely Dan is a jazz band, and so are The Beatles, since such chords occur in many of their songs. And both bands featured a little improvisation as well. Pingouin appears here to commit himself to claiming that if you can find 7th chords being used in a song then this is sufficient for a musician to be playing jazz, but this is just not true. One can use such chords outside of playing jazz while playing a genre of music other than jazz. Steely Dan have jazz elements for sure in some of their music and they often incorporated actual jazz musicians into their performances or recordings, such as jazz saxophonist Phil Woods, saxophonist/bass-guitarist Wilton Felder(founding member of the Jazz Crusaders), jazz percussionist/vibraphonist/keyboardist Victor Feldman, and (smooth) jazz guitarists Larry Carlton and Lee Ritenour, jazz saxophonists Wayne Shorter, Pete Christlieb, and Tom Scott, knowledgeable jazz drummers Steve Gadd, Rick Marotta and Bernard Purdie, jazz pianist Joe Sample and ex-Miles Davis jazz pianist/vibraphonist Victor Feldman. Hence, it is no surprise that jazz elements show up in Steely Dan's music, but generally speaking, virtually none of Steely Dan's songs are thought of as simply jazz tunes, rather they incorporate elements found in jazz.\n\nBut none of these aforementioned examples (from Merle [Haggard] to Lennon & McCartney) are jazz. This reveals that Pingouin agrees that his former examples where music incorporated swing or improvisation, by itself, is insufficient to establish that a musician is playing jazz. Something is missing, and it's not melanin. But what is it? The melanin remark refers to the pigmentation in skin that makes it darker or lighter in appearance. His rejection of this aspect shows that Pingouin finds race irrelevant for whether or not a musician is playing jazz. He then asks and answers what is needed to make the music be jazz. Jazz might be best described as the set of jealously-guarded canons that have endured over the decades, even musics that divided one set of jazz police from another, once upon a time. The answer provided is the set of \"canons enduring over decades.\" This answer does not include anything from the future since the unknown future cannot be 'jealously guarded' nor is it included in a past set of jazz canons. Big band jazz, the orchestras of the likes of Fletcher Henderson, Paul Whiteman, Duke Ellington, and many others, introduced detailed, written-out arrangements of instrumental parts, but it still included improvisation, and was, musically, thoroughly in the then-young jazz tradition. The big rift came in the 1940's, with the advent of bebop, a loose, small-group form of the music, not really all that far-removed, in retrospect, from swing-era jazz. But the added harmonic and melodic complexity, plus the change from making-music-to-dance-to to an art for art's sake aesthetic, alienated much of the jazz audience of the day.\n\nIt is very significant that Pinguion accepts that Bebop was “not really all that far-removed, in retrospect, from swing-era jazz ” because not everyone believes this, although upon reflection how could it fail to be true since these were swing era jazz musicians striving to make the music they were already familiar with and using it as a base for introducing more harmonic complexity into the music.\n\nBop would become the mainstream, i.e., the center of gravity of the collection of canons, and would evolve over the decades into its own little subgenres, like cool jazz, hard bop, and such. The mainstream of today would include swing-era stuff, and bebop in all its forms - the NPR version of \"what jazz is\". The more adventurous would include the 80s/90s mainstream: music derived from Miles Davis's pre-fusion groups, music championed by the likes of the latter-day alumni of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, such as Wynton Marsalis. And, yes, they all wear nice clothes, something especially important for the marketing of \"Young Lions\" like Joshua Redman.\n\nBebop did impact all future jazz because musicians in the jazz genre were expected from now on to be capable of playing jazz at this level of difficulty. Bebop did not last that long as a sub-genre of jazz because that was 75 years ago. Anything that old in the 21st century will have undergone massive development due primarily to increases in technology and the sophistication of modern schools of jazz instruction. However, it is not true that cool jazz evolved from Bebop because it was a reaction to the style of Bebop. Architects of cool jazz such as Miles Davis, Gerry Mulligan, Gil Evans, and Lee Konitz when these gentleman were all in New York City had a softer and less frenetic vision for jazz than embodied in a usual Bebop number. Gil Evans, in particular, wished to expand the harmonic and color palette of jazz with French horns and tubas.[43] Later on, out on the west coast of the United States, primarily in California, players like Stan Getz, Chet Baker and others continued with a cooler jazz sound and tempo to produce West Coast cool jazz. These were new approaches for jazz and not just an extension of Bebop into an evolved anything.\n\nSince the 1950's, jazz musicians have been extending the tradition in ways that alienated critics and audiences, akin to the days of the boppers; pianist Lennie Tristano had even tried free improvisation as early as the 1940's. Cecil Taylor began to find a way to fuse his love of Ellington and Thelonious Monk with the Prokofiev and Stravinsky and Henry Cowell of his conservatory training, and to improvise from structures completely removed from the preset chords and melodies of jazz tunes. This came to be known as free jazz, which, in turn, developed its own amorphous, overlapping set of subgenres over the decades, like free improvisation, \"energy music\", or freebop, for instance. Via the aforementioned Miles influence, some of this music has made its way, in somewhat manicured (and often subtle) form, into the mainstream, while the wilder or more non-conformist aspects remain as underground as they were in 1961. Those who sit in hope of the canonization of the avant-to-the-max Frank Wright or Sunny Murray will wait in vain, but many musicians, over the years, have become elder statesmen of the avant-garde, like the members of the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Taylor, Peter Kowald, and Peter Brotzmann, among many others. Some have received subsidies, such as MacArthur Foundation Grants, or have found careers in the academic world. But you will probably never hear them on NPR, nor see their latest CD hyped by retailers and portals.\n\nThe most commercially popular form of jazz over the years is Not Jazz, that is, watered-down jazz-like musics that are user-friendly enough to be hyped by the retailers and portals of the day. Often the music is made by real jazz musicians, which gives it even more of a veneer of validity, from the saccharine balladry of Harry James, to soul jazz, to the trendy R&B instrumentals of Ramsey Lewis, to the smooth jazz and the it's-jazz-by-virtue-of-sampling-old-jazz records of today. While indie labels have pretty much always been the media midwife of real jazz, large labels, aggressively marketing a combination of Not Jazz and conservative jazz vocalists, have usually been able to define, by sheer brute force, \"what jazz is\", much as Intel and Microsoft define all that is \"computing\" for a large number of people. Not Jazz is a varied tradition in its own right, and is often the centerpiece of \"jazz\" festivals worldwide.\n\nWhich is why the word tends to be a bit off-putting. If someone intones the word \"jazz\" (especially if it's preceded by an adjective like \"cool\"), I get the same sort of queasy feeling in the pit of my stomach that I would if a telemarketer were calling. Someone is trying to sell me something that I, a casual/hardcore jazz fan since childhood, wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole, or it's a product, musical or not, being sold by invoking the idea of \"jazz\". Miles Davis, once the embodiment of the hip, well-dressed jazzman, abandoned the word sometime around 1965, for various reasons, including not wanting to be lumped in with the swirling commercial ghetto of musics called, rightly or wrongly, \"jazz\", especially in the face of the commercial ascendence of Beatles-era rock.\n\nOther terms have sprung up since then. The musics Miles made after abandoning the word came to be known as fusion, and \"smooth jazz\" has its roots both in soul jazz and the more dumbed-down aspects of fusion; someone coined the word \"fuzak\" back in the 70's, in the wake of major labels like Warner (now part of AOL Time Warner) and CBS Records (now owned by Sony) flooding the market with slickly-recorded Not Jazz (also known, very briefly, as \"Triple Z\" jazz). Those two record labels, either for fear of alienating jazz fans, or fear of scaring away pop buyers, even had ads that extolled the new products of their jazz divisions, but deliberately failed to mention the word \"jazz\".\n\nOthers, irreparably divorced from the marketers' definition of jazz, would come up with new names: \"creative music\", \"creative improvised music\", \"music in the (jazz) tradition\", or the AACM's notion of \"Great Black Music\", part of the Art Ensemble of Chicago's motto, tying together the Dogon, the field holler, Charlie Parker, and James Brown, et al. These terms were mainly meant to invoke the connection between free jazz and the jazz musics that came before; fancier than the term \"free jazz\" - a relevant quote from saxophonist Chico Freeman: \"Free jazz\" means I don't get paid, a quip with multiple truths to it, from an era when loft jazz musicians were not yet welcome in large numbers. (The same applies to the \"free music\" of Germany's FMP). Dr. Billy Taylor, a mainstream pianist and educator whose career goes back to the late swing era, promoted jazz as \"America's Classical Music\", a uniquely home-grown musical artform that had grown as high-falutin' as anything in Carnegie Hall, and, now, the advent of such latter-day institut"
