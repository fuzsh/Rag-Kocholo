Although eco- labels should be seen as a complement to, rather than a substitute for, traditional regulatory instruments (Harrison 1999: 110), it can be assumed that these environmental policy instruments will become more important for environmental policy in the near future.\"\n\nKern et.al\n\nState forest services\n\nSORRY\n\nDear Visitor, a text will be available shortly\n\nIn excuse for this inconvenient have a look here\n\nForests and the Kyoto protocol\n\nSORRY\n\nDear Visitor, a text will be available shortly, but there is a German text.\n\nIn excuse for this inconvenient we want to show\n\nyou an example of really bad safety management:\n\nForest Owner Associations\n\nGeneral Information and initial situation\n\nWeilhart as a contiguous forest area with a total area of about 10.000 ha comprises about 5.000 ha of large scale forests owners (Castell and co-onwers) and about 5.000 ha of small holder private forests. The 5.000 ha of core area make up the core of the Weilhart forest area, whilst the small holder private forest make up the fringe zone congregated around the core.\n\nPlantation management\n\nTimber plantations are of high importance for the future wood supply\n\n\"European global players on the pulp & paper market - most of them are the product of mega-mergers - have used their heft to go global. For starters, they have invested billions in new pulp mills in South America that are three times bigger than any in Canada. The ability to spread fixed costs over so much capacity is an unbeatable advantage.\n\nThe eucalyptus trees that feed these mills grow to maturity in less than a decade in the Brazilian and Uruguayan sun, compared to the 70 or 80 years it takes for Northern tree species in the US, Canada and Europe. The South American pulp is shipped back to Europe and turned into dozens of different grades of paper on the most modern and fastest machines in existence. The equipment is designed by Austrian ones at Andritz, Finnish ones at Metso or German ones at Voith.\"\n\n10th Aniversary\n\n25th of October 2008\n\nThe forest association Weilhart (WWGW) has been founded in 1998 by a couple of enthusiastic forest owners in the region of county Braunau, Flachgau, Altötting, Traunstein.\n\nIn the meantime more than 100 members have joined the association.\n\nMain objects of the association are:\n\nManaging Plantation Operations\n\nFrom Establishment through Maintenance to Harvesting\n\nFirst FSC Certificate\n\nFSC News+Notes, ISSUE 11, AUGUST 11, 2003\n\nCrossing Boundaries through FSC Group\n\nCertificate: GFA-FM/COC-2084\n\nGFA-FM/COC-001771\n\nTimberland Valuation and the global economic crises\n\nThe issue in today’s post concerns why the transaction price of timberland has shown little or no decline in value but the stock price of the publicly traded companies that own timberland has declined dramatically. I will also look at what I think is happening in the timberland market today and how I see the market for timberland investment. But first, let’s set the stage.\n\nHorse logging/Pferderückung\n\nPrince Edward's Provinzregierung (Kanada) erlaubt jedermann die Holznutzung mit Pferden...\n\nMontag, 20.4.2009: Totholz und minderwertige Holzsortimente gehören demjenigen, der das Holz mit Pferden aus dem Wald bringt. Er muss weder für das Holz noch für eine Holznutzungslizenz bezahlen. Ein interessanter Ansatz um Pferderückung in das Blickfeld der Öffentlichkeit zu rücken...\n\nGovernment offer leads to horse logging comeback\n\nMonday, 20th of April 2009: More forests on P.E.I. are being logged with the help of horses this year following an offer of free firewood.\n\nForestry returns outperform the rest over three years\n\nLondon, 24th June 2009: Investment in forestry outperformed domestic commercial property and equities last year, producing a positive annual total return of 7.0%, eclipsed only by bonds, according to the IPD UK Forestry Index.By comparison, UK commercial property delivered -22.11%; UK equities returned -29.92%, while listed property companies and trusts were the most vulnerable to the global market downturn, returning -46.63% over 2008. Bonds, however, gained 154%.\n\nIndia: Punjab forest dept to distribute one million seedings\n\nPunjab forest dept to distribute 10 lakh seedings\n\nWednesday, 24 June 2009: CHANDIGARH: The Punjab Forest Department has decided to give a big push to agro-forestry in the State and would distribute 10 lac seedlings of fast-growing and economically important tree species such as Eucalyptus, Shisham and Drek.\n\nNew Zealand Eucalyptus for the U.S.\n\n28 June 2009: A Quarter Million NZ Raised GE Eucalyptus Trees Intended for Planting in U.S; Soil &Health Association of New Zealand, (Est. 1941), Publishers of ORGANIC NZ\n\nMore than a quarter of a million genetically engineered (GE) eucalyptus trees exported from New Zealand stand to shred New Zealand’s clean, green brand and risk large-scale health and environmental damage, according to the Soil & Health Association of New Zealand.\n\nClimate change happens: beetles to destroy American forests\n\nMarkus Sommerauer - Mon, 13/07/2009 - 06:59\n\n4.7.2009: America's 4 July bonfires served a dual purpose yesterday. They burned the wood of trees destroyed by a trio of bugs that are devastating parts of the nation's forests.\n\nWith 750 million acres of forests in the United States, the scale of the problem is massive. Since 1999, the country has lost, on average, 1 per cent of its tree cover per year. This means these small insects have killed about 10 per cent of all US forests in 10 years.\n\nA profitable rainforest!(?)\n\nA MOST unusual document landed on your correspondent’s desk recently: a financial report from a rainforest. Iwokrama, a 370,000-hectare rainforest in central Guyana, announced that it was in profit. It added, more intriguingly, that rainforests had entered the “global economy”.\n\nIndonesian Government: Production forests will reach 10m hectares by 2014\n\nThe government is optimistic its production forests (HTI) will span over 5 million hectares by the year-end, and over 10 million hectares by 2014 as targeted, because the forestry industry can now resort to financing supported by government, an official says.\n\nHigher Carbon Dioxide May Give Pine Trees A Competitive Edge\n\nScienceDaily (Aug. 4, 2009) — Pine trees grown for 12 years in air one-and-a-half times richer in carbon dioxide than today's levels produced twice as many seeds of at least as good a quality as those growing under normal conditions, a Duke University-led research team reported Aug. 3 at a national ecology conference.\n\nKenya to Plant 7.6 Billion Trees to Check Deforestation\n\nNAIROBI - Kenya said on Wednesday it would plant 7.6 billion trees over the next 20 years to redress decades of chopping down forest cover, the effect of which is now being felt in acute water and power shortages.\n\nGermany and US to finance a Reforestation Project in India\n\nThe United States and Germany have agreed to donate $19 million for the reforestation of a Bangladesh wildlife sanctuary under a global climate change mitigation project, the U.S. embassy said on Wednesday.\n\nA New Direction And Vision For America’s Forests\n\nSEATTLE, August 14, 2009 - US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has outlined his vision for the future of America’s forests. In his first major speech regarding the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service, Vilsack set forth a new direction for conservation, management, and restoration of these natural treasures.\n\nFarmers protect climate by doing Forestry\n\nMarkus Sommerauer - Wed, 26/08/2009 - 16:34\n\nAustrian Farmers have taken care of both - Farmland and Forests - since centuries because of the close interconnection of agriculture and forestry. Holistic land use management is obligatory for every Austrian farmer. Therefore it's not quite new for Austrian Farmers what the World Agroforestry Centre is concluding:\n\nInternational Paper Treads Monsanto’s Path to ‘Frankenforests’\n\nAug. 28 (Bloomberg) -- International Paper Co., the world’s largest pulp and paper maker, plans to remake commercial forests in the same way Monsanto Co. revolutionized farms with genetically modified crops.\n\nOver 10,000 jobs already lost in Finnish forestry sector\n\nFinnish forestry’s contribution to the national economy has dropped by half since the start of the new millennium.\n\nCertified Forestry Is In Trouble, U.N. Report Says\n\nThe certified-forestry movement is running out of steam, a United Nations report suggests.\n\n\"The pace of expansion of global certified forest area has slowed dramatically in the last three years,\" says the international agency's recently released Forest Products Annual Market Review, 2008-2009. The proportion of \"industrial roundwood\" coming from forests certified by such environmental organizations as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) has actually decreased recently, to 25.9%, it says.\n\n\"Certified forest area increased by around 50 million hectares a year between 2001 and 2005 – mainly due to a rapid increase in certified forest area in North America – then the rate slowed by half to 25 million hectares a year in 2006 and 2007. More recently the rate has stagnated even further, not exceeding 4 million hectares between May 2008 and May 2009.\" Certified forestry has actually lost some ground in North America and Europe, the U.N. report adds.\n\nOne culprit is that the sustainable-forestry movement is running out of low-hanging fruit: \"Now that many of the largest state- and industry-owned lands in the developed world are already\n\ncertified, the certification movement faces the significant challenge of expanding in more difficult\n\nareas\" such as small forestry operations and developing countries.\n\nPlease continue reading this article here...\n\nForest certification in war - some interesting insights...\n\nNow that the forest-certification movement is running out of steam, two groups involved in promoting sustainable forestry have responded by declaring war on each other.\n\nForestEthics fired the first shots a few days ago, filing complaints of both tax fraud and greenwashing against the Sustainable Forestry Initiative. It sent letters last week asking the IRS to revoke SFI's tax-exempt status and requesting that the Federal Trade Commission investigate SFI's \"unfair and deceptive\" marketing practices. ForestEthics claims that SFI's forestry-certification program is inferior to Forest Stewardship Council certification.\n\nSFI responded today by calling the ForestEthics complaints \"an affront to the tremendous efforts by foresters, businesses, governments, consumers, SFI and other standards groups to preserve and protect our forests for future generations.\"\n\n“We should all be focusing our resources and efforts on supporting responsible forest management and fighting deforestation and illegal logging, not wasting energy on bickering among ourselves,\" SFI added. A United Nations report recently concluded that the once-rapid growth of forest-certification efforts has stagnated during the past three years, Dead Tree Edition reported last month.\n\nI'm skeptical whether FSC, which has had its own credibility issues in places like Indonesia, is significantly superior to SFI, but I welcome comment on the subject. I think the most useful service Dead Tree Edition can offer at this point is extensive excerpts from the complaints and SFI's response. Note: The rest of this article consists entirely of statements from ForestEthics and SFI that do not necessarily represent the views of Dead Tree Edition:\n\nWoodplantations will help developing countries to establish Sustainable Forest Management\n\n“The world needs more effective and focused international action on tropical forests. That will help\n\nreduce poverty, protect biodiversity and also mitigate the effects of climate change.”\n\nRoads and Rainforests - of course they matter...\n\nChainsaws, bulldozers, and fires are tools of rainforest destruction, but roads are enablers.\n\nForests do not naturally grow in straight lines\n\nForest negotiations recently have been featuring a lot of talk about something called “sustainable forest management,” or in climate policy parlance, SFM.\n\nSFM - do people know what they are talking about?\n\nMarkus Sommerauer - Thu, 08/10/2009 - 07:48\n\nIn matters of: Bangkok, Day 5: Breaking News: Forests do not naturally grow in straight lines:\n\nStudy shows trees have impact on Georgia’s economy\n\nAs Americans mark National Forest Products Week from Oct. 18-24, a new report shows Georgia’s forest products industry has a significant impact on the state’s economy.\n\n2009 Nobel prize for economics and forest property\n\nThe 2009 Nobel prize for economics recently was awarded to two Americans – Elinor Ostrom and Oliver E. Williamson – for complementary ideas on economic governance.\n\nAfter Typhoon, Illegal Logging Back in Spotlight in Vietnam\n\nWhen rains slowed enough for people living in the central coast of Vietnam to venture outside and assess the damage, they were stunned at what they saw.\n\nEU Position for the Copenhage Climate Conference\n\nThe European Union has published it's Position for the Copenhave Climate Conference.\n\nHere are the Forests related parts.\n\nThe planet never needed more than now world forestry management\n\nWorld Forestry Congress produces a message to be presented at COP 15\n\nin Copenhagen\n\nXIII World Forestry Congress 2009: Forest Development: A Vital Balance\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nWe, the 7,075 participants from 160 countries gathered at the Thirteenth World Forestry Congress to consider the theme of the Congress, “Forest Development: A Vital Balance” and through it explore the numerous existing and emerging environmental, social and economic challenges facing us . For the first time the Congress incorporated discussion fora, business meetings and a session on communication.\n\nTimberland transactions in the US 2009\n\nMajor timberland transactions have slowed considerably but some continue to close. I wrote an article for Forest Landowners Magazine (THE TREND IN TIMBERLAND PRICES) that was supposed to be published in October but the publishing date was postponed until late November so I thought I would do a little update on transactions to date for this year. From the list below, you can see that there are quite a few transactions but relatively few large ones.\n\nLogged forests support biodiversity after 15 years of rehabilitation\n\nWith the world facing global warming and a biodiversity crisis, a new study in Conservation Biology shows that within 15 years logged forests—considered by many to be 'degraded'—can be managed in order to successfully fight both climate change and extinction.\n\nIs mixing of PEFC and FSC material allowed?\n\nA recent FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) study set out to assess whether the requirements set for FSC Controlled Wood are met by PEFC (Program for Endorsement of Forest Certification) schemes.\n\nIs Timber an Overhyped Investment?\n\nU.S. TIMBERLAND MAY BE ONE OF THE WORLD'S most overvalued asset classes.\n\nDisney Invests in Forestry\n\nThe Walt Disney Company intends to invest US$7 million in forest conservation projects in the U.S.A, the Amazon and the Congo Basin in an effort to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSpecial Session of the United Nations Forum on Forests\n\nNovember 6, 2009: The United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) met in Special Session at UN Headquarters in New York on Friday, 30 October 2009.

Food and Agriculture Organization. Roughly half this loss occurred in Brazil, which is home to the largest extent of tropical forest in the world: the Amazon.\n\n2009: a year in review of rainforest protection\n\n2009 may prove to be an important turning point for tropical forests.\n\nLead by Brazil, which had the lowest extent of deforestation since at least the 1980s, global forest loss likely declined to its lowest level in more than a decade. Critical to the fall in deforestation was the global financial crisis, which dried up credit for forest-destroying activities and contributed to a crash in commodity prices, an underlying driver of deforestation.\n\nFirst-Ever Study Quantifies the Economic Impact of Private, Working Forests in the U.S.\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C.
