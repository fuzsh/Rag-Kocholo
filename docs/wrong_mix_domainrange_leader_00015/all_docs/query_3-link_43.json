        "text": "Abstract This talk is based on the results of my doctoral thesis, finished in 2014. The latter is a study that deals with immigrant integration “soft” policies developed within the trans-scalar context of the “EU framework for the Integration of Third Country Nationals”. The research is based on (i) 37 semi-directed interviews, given mainly in Brussels (but also in other locations) by the most important actors of this political field (European Commission, European Economic and Social Committee, Committee of the Regions, think tanks, foundations, national representatives, regional and local administration networks, civil society organizations at European and state-level, etc.), as well as on (ii) direct observation of various events and spaces and (iii) the reading of numerous sources related to the aforementioned issues. Particularly, it rests on theoretical contributions made by the “anthropology of policy” and the “governmentality studies”, borrowing from the latter certain useful notions like those of “government”, “governmentality”, “political rationality” and “technologies of government”. This critical/deconstructive approach analyzes several issues related to the EU political framework for the integration of non-EU immigrants, especially, those dealing with the construction process of this political field, its main actors, the participative process within the frame of the so called multilevel governance through which decision and policies are made, the main tools set for implementation of the latter, the social/cultural assumptions lying beneath the practices and problematisations driven by the aforementioned policies, and the specific forms of knowledge promoted. It is important to note that the European Union has no direct competence over integration policies (according to article 79.4 of the Lisbon Treaty), being the latter a primary responsibility of national government. In spite of that, during the last 15 years (at least starting from the conclusions of the Tampere European Council in 1999), a EU common framework on integration has been progressively established. The process has been based on a “voluntary” alignment of policies, which happened mainly through the exchange of information and best practices among the various actors implied. In addition to that, not only institutional but also “non-governmental” actors (such as important migration NGOs) have played a mayor role within this process. In conclusion, different scales and levels have been implied in the construction of a “non-mandatory” political framework which, in spite of its voluntary character, has been able to foster and spread across the European Union an increasingly common understanding of integration, a “way of knowing” and constructing integration in a particular way. In order to develop this research, it has been useful to conceive the “field” not as simple “place”, but rather as a set of (relational) locations connected by similar meanings and problematisations. That's why it has been useful to use the concept of “apparatus” (Foucault, 1985: 128) in order to describe and limit my field. According to Feldman, the interpretative scheme offered by this notion is crucial in order to understand “amorphous and de-centralised policy regimes that work regulating big populations” by transforming them into quantifiable and governable objects (Feldman, 2011: 32). Also Shore and Wright propose to study this “assemblages of agents, institutions, technologies and discourses” (2011:11) that function as mechanisms of alignment between governmental aims and the conduct of implied actors. In a similar way, the different soft policy tools established by the “EU Framework on Integration” -discourses, knowledges, participative practices, modules, ways of benchmarking and indicators, systems of funding, etc.- may be considered as part of an apparatus. In fact, notwithstanding their diversity, they are all traversed by a common problematization of integration -although undoubtedly contradictory and sometimes questioned- and by a governmental will to align the agency of the social-political actors present in this field. In this piece of research the concept of integration has been used as a tool, which sheds light on the existence of broader processes in the background of this policy area that refer to the social dynamics originated in the last decades ‒in particular, such processes are associated with changes in the mode of production (Post-Fordism) and with the increasing dismantling of the welfare state under hegemonic neoliberalism. As these processes have generated brand new vocabulary, practices, and regimes of truth, the category of integration has been addressed as a social construction. It is not analyzed as a pre-existing object, but rather in terms of its historical and social conditions of production. In this sense, the importance of the “governmentality studies” theoretical framework has been really relevant for this study, since certain notions like that of government, governmentality (Foucault, 1991); political rationalities; technologies of government (Rose, 1999; Dean, 2010); technologies of visibility, technologies of agency (Walters and Haahr, 2005), have been particularly useful in order to understand the mechanisms through which this political field works. Definitively, in this talk I would like to deal with some methodological aspects, as well as certain contents and conclusions to which I have arrived, that may be useful not only in relation to their specific context, but also in more general terms, in order to debate important aspects of reflexive government (Dean, 2010) in contemporary neoliberalism, such as the relationship between the representation of the “active (migrant) citizen” implied in his/her own integration and the existence of processes of inclusion/exclusion and construction of otherness (that are particularly visible in the case of non-EU migrants); the supposed need to manage the presence of certain populations from an increasingly “rationalistic-technocratic” (and seemingly depoliticized) perspective, the subordination of civil society participation in policy-making to the requirements of legitimacy and effectiveness of the policies -definitively conceiving participation as a limited and “channelled” process- ...
