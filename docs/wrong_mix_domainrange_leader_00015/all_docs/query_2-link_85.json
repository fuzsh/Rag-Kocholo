        "text": "I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 99 together.\n\nI met the Secretary General of Amnesty International, Ms. Irene Khan, in London on Wednesday 8 November. The meeting was a useful opportunity to exchange views and discuss common ground with one of the leading global human rights organisations. Our discussions centred on the situation in Darfur and the role of the new United Nations Human Rights Council.\n\nOn Darfur, I briefed Ms. Khan on my visit to the region last July and on my discussions with the Sudanese Foreign Minister then and in September. I also recalled that I had highlighted the situation in Darfur in my address to the UN General Assembly. I expressed my serious concern at the ongoing human rights violations in the region and assured Ms. Khan that Ireland would continue to do all it can at an international level to bring these gross human rights violations to an end, above all through achieving agreement on a robust peace-keeping force. Ms. Khan gave me an account of Amnesty's important work in relation to Darfur. She emphasised the important role of the Egyptian Government and it was partly in response to her suggestion that, as indicated in my earlier reply, I recently wrote to my Egyptian colleague.\n\nOn the UN Human Rights Council, which was established earlier this year, we exchanged views on the early stages of its operation. Ms. Khan outlined Amnesty's view of the challenges facing the Council. I reiterated Ireland's support for an active presence for civil society at the Council and we discussed practical ways in which this might be facilitated.\n\nWe also discussed briefly the situation in the Middle East and the recent deployment of Irish troops to Lebanon as part of the UNIFIL mission.\n\nI also availed of the meeting to underline Ireland's strong and forceful opposition to the practice of extraordinary rendition, which Ms. Khan acknowledged.\n\nI understand that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has indicated that he intends to begin a debate on the possible revision of the Japanese constitution. In his Policy Speech to the 165th Session of the Diet, Prime Minister Abe noted that the current Constitution was formulated nearly 60 years ago when Japan was under military occupation, and that discussions were ongoing within and among the government and opposition parties regarding \"the formulation of a constitution that befits a new era\". The Prime Minister has not set an exact timeframe for the possible revision of the Constitution, though he has indicated in a recent press interview that he envisages addressing this issue within the next six years, the maximum period he may serve as Prime Minister.\n\nJapan is an important partner for Ireland and the EU, with whom we share fundamental values such as democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and with whom we cooperate for peace, security and the prosperity of the international community. Japan is an active member of many international organisations. It is a major contributor financially and in peace-keeping to the UN, and a very significant aid donor. In 2007 we will be marking the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two countries.\n\nPrime Minister Abe has made clear in various fora that Japan seeks to engage in active diplomacy not only in Japan's national interest but in the interest of the region's peace and prosperity. To that end he has already sought to strengthen Japan's partnerships with other countries, including its bilateral relations with the countries of the region, notably China and the Republic of Korea, and I welcome these moves. Japan is also active in Six Party Talks on the DPRK, the recent missile and nuclear weapons tests which are rightly of grave concern to it, as they are to the rest of the international community. Overall, and indeed against the above background, I take the view that the content of the Japanese Constitution is primarily a matter for the Japanese people alone.\n\nThe 2007 Estimates for my Department include a total provision of €208.8 million for Vote 28 and €728.7 million for Vote 29 dealing with development assistance.\n\nThe Vote 29 Estimate represents a further substantial increase in our assistance to developing countries, from just over €600m this year to €728m in 2007. In addition, the Estimates provide €85 million for development aid through other Government Departments, bringing Ireland's Official Development Assistance (ODA) in 2007 to €813m. This increased allocation amounts to 0.5% of Ireland's GNP, fully meeting the Government's interim target for 2007.\n\nIn terms of our size, Ireland continues to be one of the most generous donors in the world. The 2007 Estimates demonstrate the commitment of the Government to meet, by 2012, the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP in development aid. The increase in aid from this year to next will amount to €130 million, which was the total amount of development aid Ireland provided ten years ago. Increased funds for Irish Aid will allow us to expand key areas of our programme, including Ireland's response to natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies in developing countries.\n\nI am delighted that Vote 28 includes an allocation of €15.2 million for services to our emigrants abroad. This represents a 25% increase in funding compared to this year and a fifteen-fold increase in such provision since 1997. These figures clearly reflect the Government's strong commitment to the welfare of the Irish abroad.\n\nIreland's contributions to international organisations will increase from almost €26.4m this year to €31.9m next year. This is in keeping with the Government's continuing commitment to the role and work of the United Nations. I am also pleased that funds for North-South and Anglo-Irish cooperation projects, supported by the Department's Reconciliation Fund, will amount to €3m in 2007.\n\nUnder the capital allocations, the Estimates provide €20m for the Department's programme of purchasing premises for its Missions abroad and refurbishing Embassy buildings owned by the State. The Department favours a decision to buy rather than rent property abroad where this is supported by a sound business case.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 93 together.\n\nThe Government strongly supports the right of the people of the territory of Western Sahara to determine their own future. This has been the position of successive Irish Governments. The Government has no view on what that future should be — independence, integration with Morocco or some degree of autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. The essential point is that it be decided in a genuine act of self-determination.\n\nThe Government has supported successive efforts by the United Nations to broker a solution to the issue of Western Sahara based on this principle. Following the ceasefire between Morocco and the Polisario Front in 1991, the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) was deployed in September 1991 to monitor the ceasefire and organise a referendum on the territory's future status. That referendum has yet to be held. In 1997, the former US Secretary of State James Baker, acting as the Personal Envoy of UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, brokered the Settlement Plan between the two sides, but again this was not implemented. In 2003 he brought forward what is known as the Baker II Plan, which was endorsed by the Security Council in a number of Resolutions. Both these plans involved a referendum to determine the future of the Territory.\n\nOne of the chief obstacles to the implementation of these plans has been the refusal of Morocco to accept a referendum in which independence is an option. I regret very much that Morocco has taken this view, and I look forward to the proposals which Morocco has stated it intends to present in the near future. The Government remains convinced that the full exercise of self-determination is the essential principle on which this dispute must be resolved. The Moroccan authorities are fully aware of this view.\n\nThe position in relation to the EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement was set out in detail in my reply to Question No 278 on 20 June 2006. The Agreement was negotiated by the Commission, discussed by Member States in the Fisheries Working Group, and adopted by the Agriculture and Fisheries Council under Qualified Majority Voting. In relation to territorial application, the Agreement used the same language as in previous EU Fisheries Agreements with Morocco, going back over many years.\n\nIn relation to the Western Sahara issue, the Government's concerns were that the Agreement should imply no recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the territory, and that the benefits of any economic exploitation of Western Saharan resources under the Agreement should flow to the people of the territory.\n\nIn voting in Council to approve the Agreement, which is of major importance to the fishing industries of a number of partners, Ireland made a National Declaration that it supported the Agreement on the basis that these two principles were respected. In particular, Ireland noted the duty of the EU-Morocco Joint Committee, envisaged under the Agreement, to ensure \"that the Agreement is implemented to the benefit of all the people concerned and in accordance with the principles of international law\".\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 82 and 117 together.\n\nThree Principal Development Specialists serve in Irish Aid headquarters in Dublin. None of the three has applied to decentralise to Limerick.\n\nThere are twelve Senior Development Specialists at Irish Aid headquarters. None of the twelve is applying to decentralise to Limerick, though two originally did so, but subsequently withdrew their applications.\n\nFinally, there are nine Development Specialist posts at headquarters. Five Development Specialists originally applied to decentralise to Limerick and subsequently withdrew their applications. At present, four specialists who commenced employment since the announcement of the decentralisation programme in December 2003 are scheduled to decentralise.\n\nThere is an ongoing Labour Court case regarding the terms and conditions under which technical grades are employed in various areas of the public service, including the specialists employed by Irish Aid. Technical staff employed by Government Departments and Offices, including specialists and other fixed-term workers employed in Irish Aid, brought cases to the Rights Commissioner under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act, 2003. The case, which involves complex legal issues, has been referred to the European Court of First Instance.\n\nSome of the issues involved in the decentralisation of Irish Aid to Limerick have, therefore, a wider Civil Service dimension and must be resolved at the central level. Discussions are on-going with representatives of the specialists, with their union IMPACT, and with the Department of Finance about the issues involved.\n\nDecentralisation is a Government decision and the Government is committed to moving ahead with its implementation. At present, 48 posts in the Directorate are filled by officers who have signalled their intention to decentralise to Limerick. A further 17 officers who are serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad, are also expected to decentralise to Limerick and will be taking up duty in Irish Aid in advance of the move. In addition, 21 officers from other Departments who have applied to decentralise to Limerick, most of whom are currently based in provincial locations, will transfer to the Department closer to the date of the move. Once these officers take up duty in Irish Aid, 86 posts (69% of the Directorate's staff complement) will be in place.\n\nA small number of staff, approximately 15 at entry grades, will be recruited for direct assignment to Limerick in the months preceding the move.\n\nAlmost all of the senior management team for Limerick will be in place by the end of this year. The Director General of Irish Aid has already indicated that he will decentralise to Limerick. There are now six Counsellors in place in the Directorate, who have volunteered to go to Limerick and a further two Counsellors will take up duty over the coming months. The changeover of the senior management team, just as in other grades, has been implemented in a planned and careful way so as to minimise disruption to the business of the Directorate.\n\nWhile there are challenges ahead, management and staff are working effectively together to maintain the quality and integrity of the programme. It would be my hope that a greater number of specialists will, in time, volunteer to decentralise to Limerick.\n\nHIV/AIDS is one of the foremost challenges in development, especially in Africa. The recently- launched White Paper on Irish Aid reaffirms the priority attached by the Government to addressing the global HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative provides assistance to countries to implement care, treatment and prevention programmes that can reverse the course of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n\nThree years ago, the Government signed an agreement with President Clinton committing the Government to allocating US$50 million to HIV/AIDS treatment programmes in developing countries. Mozambique was selected as the initial country of focus for the partnership.\n\nMozambique is greatly affected by HIV with more than 16% of adults between the ages of 15-49 infected. These additional resources have enabled the Government of Mozambique to successfully introduce HIV treatment into its public health response to HIV/AIDS. At the end of June this year, over 27,000 people were on HIV treatment. While excellent progress is being made, this is only 10% of those needing treatment and there are still big challenges ahead.\n\nBased on the significant progress made to date, the many challenges still to be overcome and a positive interim review of the Irish-Clinton Foundation partnership, the Government decided to extend the partnership in Mozambique for a further five years from 2006-2010.\n\nThe partnership is also being expanded to Lesotho this year. Lesotho is one of Irish Aid's partner countries and has one of the worst rates of HIV in the world. This is both a human tragedy and a tremendous barrier to development.\n\nOn 29th September last, the Taoiseach signed a new agreement with President Clinton. This new agreement builds on the existing partnership and commits the Government to continue working with the Foundation up to 2010. The agreement commits Irish Aid to work jointly with the Foundation in Mozambique and Lesotho towards the achievement of three goals: to provide financial and technical support towards the implementation of national plans for the prevention, treatment, care and support of people affected by HIV/AIDS; to contribute towards the strengthening of the health system; and to respond to the crisis of human resources for health.\n\nThis new agreement supersedes the previous agreement and provides for €70 million over the period 2006-2010. Of this amount, €60 million will go to Mozambique and €10 million to Lesotho. This support will be channelled through Ireland's missions in each country to the respective Ministries of Health. Irish Aid will meet with representatives from the Clinton Foundation in these countries on a regular basis to review cooperation and ensure the continued success of the partnership.\n\nThis is an important partnership and represents a major contribution by the Government to fighting HIV/AIDS and achieving the Millennium Development Goals.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 72 and 198 together.\n\nThe conflict in Lebanon and the ongoing crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territories have underlined the urgent need for a renewed international effort towards a comprehensive settlement of the inter-related problems of the Middle East. At the heart of such a settlement must be a negotiated two-State solution to the Israeli — Palestinian conflict. This is the only way forward for the Israeli and the Palestinian people. It is in the interests of Israel and of its neighbours, and it would remove a major source of the instability and tension across the Middle East which remains probably the greatest single threat to international peace and security.\n\nThere is a strong view among EU Member States, which the Government shares, that any effort to reach a comprehensive settlement must take into account, and where possible accommodate, the concerns of all the key regional actors, which include Syria and Iran. Engagement with Syria and Iran by all concerned could be a very positive step, but it would nonetheless need to be carefully prepared. The possibilities and basis for such engagement are currently the subject of consideration and discussion within the EU, in Israel and across the Middle East, and in the United States. I welcome Prime Minister Blair's recent contribution to this debate. Clearly, Syria and Iran can also play a politically valuable role in the stabilisation of Iraq.\n\nThe importance of Syria to an overall Middle East settlement is evident. Syria is the only one of Israel's neighbours with which a state of war technically still exists. A comprehensive peace must by definition involve Syria, which continues to seek the return of land occupied by Israel in 1967. It is encouraging that Syria has in recent years defined its goal as the achievement of a peace with Israel which will return the Golan Heights to Syria. Less encouraging, however, has been Syria's continued support for armed groups, the use of its territory to supply weapons to Hezbollah, and its long standing interference in the political affairs of Lebanon.\n\nIran for its part, while not bordering Israel or Palestine, has significant concerns as a regional power with wide interests. It could potentially play a positive role in the promotion of a two-State solution, but regrettably has chosen so far not to do so. It continues to reject the Oslo process and to support violent groups. It has provided weapons to Hezbollah and others. Repeated extreme statements by President Ahmadinejad on the Holocaust and the existence of Israel have increased regional tensions. It plays an increasingly influential role in neighbouring Iraq. Aspects of Iran's nuclear programme have also seriously alarmed its neighbours and considerably added to fears of instability in the region.\n\nIn a major effort to resolve the nuclear issue diplomatically, the EU proposed in June a very significant package of measures which could bring about a new and improved relationship between Iran and the wider international community, including in regard to Iran's security. Unfortunately Iran has not so far responded positively to this offer. The offer remains on the table and the door to a more positive dialogue remains open, even as the situation receives consideration in the UN Security Council.\n\nIran's relative international isolation has, of course, been heightened by the serious difficulties in its relations with the United States over several decades. The Government has warmly welcomed the support of the United States for the EU's efforts to engage constructively with Iran. I believe that it would be helpful if Iran and the US were in due course to agree to engage in direct contacts on regional and international issues.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos 16, 26, 63, 65, 197 and 206 together.\n\nThe Government's general position on the situation in Darfur is outlined in Priority Question No. 2 of today.\n\nIn his September 2006 monthly report on Darfur, the UN Secretary General expressed particular concern at the Government of Sudan's attempt to find a military solution to the crisis and its use of aerial bombardment that fails to distinguish between civilians and combatants. He also highlighted increased restrictions on humanitarian efforts, recurrent attacks on women and girls in IDP camps and a rise in the number of militia attacks on civilians. During October and November attacks on civilians have further increased. These terrible developments underline the urgency of putting in place an effective international peace keeping force in Darfur.\n\nAs regards contacts with the Ethiopian Government, I met Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in Addis Ababa in July 2006 and I wrote to him on 15 September to urge him to encourage the President of Sudan to accept the deployment of the UN operation in Darfur, with a strong mandate for the protection of civilians and provision of security for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. I also argued forcefully for the transition to a UN force with the Foreign Minister of Ethiopia while I was in Addis Ababa in July, and found his approach to this issue to be positive and constructive.\n\nWhile China's approach to international relations is strongly conditioned by its attachment to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, it has in recent times sought to play a relatively constructive role in relation to Darfur. During the China/Africa Summit in Beijing on 4-5 November 2006, the Chinese President and Foreign Minister are believed to have stressed to President Bashir the need to engage with others to deal with Sudan's problems, particularly in Darfur. At the meeting in Addis Ababa on Darfur on 16 November, co-chaired by the UN and African Union, the Chinese representative made a strong appeal to Sudan to accept the UN Secretary-General's proposals for the deployment of a hybrid UN/African Union peacekeeping force.\n\nI regret that China has abstained on the various UN Security Council Resolutions dealing with Sudan/Darfur. However, it has provided US$4 million in budgetary support and humanitarian aid to AMIS, the African Union's ceasefire monitoring mission there. China also welcomed the signature of the January 2005 North/South Sudan Comprehensive Peace Agreement and committed 200 troops to UNMIS, the UN's peacekeeping operation in Southern Sudan. I welcome these positive contributions, but would urge China to now bring all its influence to bear on the Sudanese President to deliver on the agreement reached at the meeting in Addis Ababa on 16 November.\n\nThe economic relationship between China and Sudan is very important. According to the Sudanese Foreign Trade Ministry, China is Sudan's main commercial partner and largest investor. The state-owned China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) owns 40% of Sudan's largest oil venture, the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company.\n\nIt should be recalled that under the provisions of the January 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, 50% of oil proceeds in southern Sudan are for the use of the Government of Southern Sudan, an area which has suffered extensively from the conflict waged there over twenty years and which is much in need of development and investment. Southern Sudan obtained US$865 million from this source in September 2006.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, arms deliveries to Sudan from China since the 1990s have included ammunition, tanks, helicopters and fighter aircraft. In March 2005 the UN imposed an embargo on arms supplies to all parties to the conflict in Darfur. The UN's Sudan Sanctions Monitoring Experts have stated that much of the ammunition used by parties to the conflict in Darfur was manufactured in China. They also discovered that in October 2005 Chinese-manufactured military trucks procured by the Sudanese Ministry of Defence had been transferred to Darfur. The Experts have recommended that the UN's arms embargo should be extended throughout Sudan, like the current EU embargo, and that countries which supply military goods and services to Sudan should require end-use destination certification. However, these recommendations have not yet been implemented by the UN Security Council.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 37 together.\n\nThe murder on 7 October of the most widely known investigative journalist and defender of freedom of expression in Russia, Anna Politkovskaya, was a heinous crime which shocked the entire international community. Her death is a tragic loss to all who work for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Russia, most of all in Chechnya. I regret to say also that justice has not been clearly seen to be done in a number of previous cases of killings of journalists in Russia. In order to demonstrate that there is no impunity for such crimes, it is imperative that the Russian authorities investigate thoroughly the murder of Anna Politkovskaya and bring its perpetrators to justice. This action is incumbent on any member in good standing of the Council of Europe and party to the European Convention on Human Rights. The Russian authorities have condemned the murder and repeatedly assured the EU that the investigation, which has been placed under the personal control of the respected Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, is a priority.\n\nMandated by Ireland and other Member States, the EU Presidency has raised the case of Anna Politskovskaya with Russia on at least three occasions to date, including at the highest level. A Presidency statement issued on the day after the killing called for a thorough investigation. Prime Minister Vanhanen, as President of the European Council, raised the matter with President Putin at the dinner which followed the informal European Council in Lahti, Finland on 20 October. The case of Anna Politskovskaya and the wider question of the role of free media as an element of a functioning democracy were among the issues discussed at the fourth round of human rights consultations between the EU and Russia in Brussels on 8 November. The Presidency is expected to refer to the case again at tomorrow's EU-Russia Summit in Helsinki.\n\nIn recent years, in an overall context in which the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms is not advancing and the space for genuine political pluralism is narrowing, freedom of the media has deteriorated in Russia. News coverage by State-owned and most privately-owned electronic media lacks independence. The print media, which has a narrower reach, has a more critical approach to the actions of the authorities; however changes in the ownership of some prominent dailies suggest that they too may become subject to increased pressures. There are fears that recent changes to the law on countering extremist activity, which is very vaguely defined, may make it easier to use against opposition politicians, human rights defenders and free media. The EU is monitoring closely the implementation of changes to the law governing the funding of foreign NGOs in Russia, which came into effect on 1 April last, because they give rise to similar concerns.\n\nThere are disturbing reports this week suggesting that Alexander Litvineko, a former Russian security agent living in Britain, might have been poisoned because he is an enemy of President Putin. The Russian authorities have dismissed the charge which, if proven, would be very grave.\n\nThe EU has an intense engagement with Russia. Ireland participates fully in the development of common positions for EU contact with Russia at all levels. In particular we work with others to ensure that values issues, such as those raised by the Deputies, receive due attention.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 44 together.\n\nThe Government shares the widespread concern at the extremely difficult situation in Iraq. Developments have been dominated by the continuing deterioration in the security situation, and in particular the terrible consequences of the spiralling cycle of sectarian violence. There is at present no sign that the insurgency and the inter-communal violence across the country are being brought under control. It is clear that they are effectively blocking the political and reconstruction efforts of Iraq's first fully sovereign and democratic Government and Parliament. The worst violence has been between Shia and Sunni groups in Baghdad and central Iraq, but there has also been an increase in violence in the south of the country. The Kurdish area in the north has largely been unaffected by the violence, although there are dangerous signs of ethnic tensions in the disputed city of Kirkuk.\n\nAlthough there is no agreed estimate of the casualties from the insurgency, the inter-communal violence and the widespread resultant criminal activity, it is clear that the suffering of the Iraqi people has reached an appalling level. Credible media reports put the more recent monthly death toll in the region of 1,300. In response to the chaos, there has been substantial population movement, with many of those who can afford it moving to neighbouring countries and to Europe, and widespread internal relocation, as formerly mixed areas become polarised along communal lines. Estimates of the extent of this movement suggest perhaps a million people internally displaced.\n\nAgainst this background, it is difficult to remain optimistic about the impact of the democratic process, which was embraced in such a remarkable manner by the Iraqi people last year. A series of initiatives by the national unity Government to combat the violence, with the assistance of US and other international forces, have had little success. The apparent involvement of some units of the new Iraqi security forces, in some cases linked to Shia militias, has greatly strained relations between the parties in Government. There has been no progress in the review of the new democratic Constitution, which might have addressed some of the concerns of the Sunni community.\n\nThe Government and our partners in the EU remain firmly committed to supporting the Iraq i people as they work to restore security and prosperity. Since 2003, the EU has provided over €700 million in assistance for reconstruction. Work is continuing under the auspices of the United Nations on the development of an International Compact for Iraq, which will coordinate assistance in partnership with the Iraqi Government, on the basis of its priorities. The EU will continue to offer all possible political, economic and technical support, including training for officials of the Iraqi criminal justice system.\n\nIn considering the situation in Iraq, the primary concern of the international community must be the welfare of the people of the country. We believe that a secure and peaceful Iraq can only be assured through the maintenance of its territorial integrity, the development of shared political and other institutions and strong political and economic links with all the countries of the neighbouring region.\n\nI am aware of the criticisms of the conduct of the trial of former President Saddam Hussein and his co-defendants by organisations including Human Rights Watch. The accused were charged with specific and very serious crimes. I believe that the people of Iraq deserve to see those crimes accounted for. We welcomed the determination of the Iraqi authorities to pursue the legal process in extremely difficult circumstances. It would not be appropriate for me to comment now on the conduct of the legal process, other than to note that the trial was held in open court under Iraqi law, and was fully televised. The guilty verdicts are clearly a matter for the Iraqi courts. An appeals process is now underway.\n\nIn relation to the death sentences imposed on Saddam Hussein and his co-defendants, I would emphasise that the Government, and our EU partners, have a clear policy against the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. The EU has conveyed its strong views on the use of the death penalty directly to the Iraqi Government.\n\nVacancies in the Department are, in general, filled through the Public Appointments Service (PAS), which is the central recruiting body for the whole of the Civil Service. Competitions for positions within the Civil Service are advertised by the PAS in the recruitment pages of the national newspapers.\n\nThe Department's graduate recruitment programme for posts at the diplomatic grade of Third Secretary is also operated by the PAS. Candidates must have a first or second class honours degree in any discipline or have qualified as a Solicitor or Barrister. A new Third Secretary recruitment competition will be advertised by the PAS in early 2007. Third Secretaries will be appointed from this competition to fill vacancies arising and it is expected that the first of them will take up duty in the Department next summer.\n\nThe Department also recruits development specialists to work at headquarters and in missions overseas to provide specialist input to its overseas aid programme. As soon as ongoing discussions around the specialists' terms and conditions of employment are successfully completed, the Department, through the PAS, intends to recruit additional specialist staff.\n\nThis year, the Department initiated a pilot scheme which offers six internships for recent graduates who hope to make a career in international development aid. The internships, which are for eight months, are designed to complement academic and professional knowledge by providing practical experience and an understanding of the realities of international development cooperation. Recruitment has just ended for the coming year. The scheme will be assessed at the end of the internships before a decision is taken on whether to recruit interns next year.\n\nIn addition, the Department annually recruits four Stagiaires to work for up to twelve months in its Legal and Political Divisions. The posts are normally advertised in the national newspapers in April or May of each year respectively. In each case, successful candidates are placed on a panel following a competitive interview process.\n\nFinally, the Department from time to time advertises for Services Officer, Nightwatchperson and Cleaner positions through the FAS website. Panels are formed from which vacancies in these grades are filled. A competition for Services Officer and Nightwatchperson is underway at present. The panel, which will be formed arising from this competition, will run until 2008. A competition for Cleaner positions will be advertised through FAS in the early months of next year.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 205 together.\n\nThe IMF and World Bank have made increasing efforts to tackle the problem of debt in developing countries, since the launch of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in 1996. The HIPC Initiative, which was strengthened and enhanced in 1999, sought to reduce the debt burden of qualifying countries to sustainable levels but did not entail cancellation. Ireland contributed some €30m towards the costs of implementation of the Initiative.\n\nThe Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) agreed by the G8 Countries at Gleneagles in July 2005 and which came into effect on 1 July this year, goes further. It is a commitment to the cancellation of the multilateral debt owed to the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund of many of the poorest and most indebted countries in the world. Most of these countries are in Africa. For the first time, the most powerful countries have recognised that many poor countries need 100% debt relief if they are to address the development needs of their people seriously. This is an important basis from which we can continue to work for a complete and sustainable solution to the debt problem facing poor countries.\n\nThe Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative is separate from the earlier HIPC Initiative, but linked to it operationally. Under this new Initiative, cancellation of eligible debts is granted to countries which have completed the HIPC Initiative process, i.e. have already been judged as qualified to receive debt relief.\n\nFrom the information available to me, I am satisfied that these new commitments to debt write-off are being honoured. As of mid-August 2006, 29 countries of the 40 defined heavily indebted poor countries had received debt relief under the HIPC Initiative, amounting to US$28.8 billion. So far, 19 of these countries have also received MDRI debt relief from the IMF and World Bank, amounting to a further US$15.8 billion (US$12.8 billion from the World Bank and US$3.0 billion from the IMF). The total cost of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative is estimated at US$48.9 billion in nominal terms.\n\nThe IMF share of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative's costs will largely be met by own resources, as authorised by IMF Members including Ireland. Ireland's additional share of the costs of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative amounts to €58.6m, out of the approximately US$37 billion total cost of debt relief to be provided by the World Bank. As a gesture of support and to underline our strong commitment to 100% debt relief for the poorest countries, this amount has already been paid over in full.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 66, 69, 71, 110 and 118 together.\n\nThe Government is deeply concerned by the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The terrible violence of recent months serves to underline that there can be no military or unilateral solutions to the Israeli — Palestinian conflict. The Government and our EU partners are determined to continue to work directly with the parties, and internationally, to revive a credible peace process in the Middle East. We have argued strongly that the only way forward for the Israeli and the Palestinian people is the negotiation of a viable two-State solution.\n\nThe EU has consistently stated that all parties must demonstrate their commitment to the implementation of their obligations under the Quartet Roadmap, and under international law. The Government and our EU partners have consistently called on the Israeli Government to end all activities in the Occupied Territories which threaten to undermine the viability of a two-State solution and which are against international law. These include the expansion of settlements, the demolition of Palestinian homes and the construction of the separation barrier on occupied land. We have raised these issues directly with the Israeli Government, in conjunction with our EU partners, and at the United Nations. We will continue actively to do so.\n\nAs I stated in my reply to a Question on house demolitions on 2 November, the Government continues to follow the situation in East Jerusalem very closely, through the Representative Office in Ramallah and the Embassy in Tel Aviv, and in consultation with Palestinan, Israeli and Irish human rights groups and NGOs. The practice of house demolitions in East Jerusalem is closely linked to the issues of residency status and the expansion of settlements. The Israeli authorities have placed very severe restrictions on the building of houses by Palestinians in East Jerusalem and, in practice, have issued fewer than 100 building permits to Palestinians in the area annually. Many Palestinians have built homes without the permits required by the Israeli authorities because they believe they have no alternative. Both directly and in conjunction with our EU partners, the Government has made it clear to the Israeli Government that it must end the practice of demolition of these homes, which is contrary to international law.\n\nThe Deputies will be aware of the Government's strong views on the illegality of the construction of the separation barrier on occupied land. While we recognise the responsibility on the Israeli Government to provide for the security of its citizens, I have regularly expressed my serious concern about the negative consequences of the continuing construction of the barrier, both for the daily lives of the Palestinian people and for the viability of a just and lasting settlement. The Government has raised the issues involved directly with Israel, within the EU and at the United Nations. We have been to the fore in ensuring that the European Union continues to affirm that it will recognise no changes to the pre-1967 borders other than those negotiated between the parties in the context of a final status agreement.\n\nWe will continue to monitor developments in relation to the barrier and the construction of settlements, and to make our views known on their illegality. I am not aware of any Irish company which is involved in the construction by Israel of the separation barrier, or of new roads in the Occupied Territories.\n\nIn our bilateral contacts with Israel, the Government has regularly conveyed its concerns about the human rights implications of Israeli security policies and the importance of full compliance with international humanitarian law. The EU has serious concerns about the practice of administrative detention in Israel and the Occupied Territories. We have ensured that they are addressed in the EU's continuing political dialogue with Israel. Most recently, the Union's specific concerns about administrative detention were raised at the meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council in Luxembourg on 13 June and at the EU-Israel Sub-Committee on Political Dialogue in Brussels on 9 November.\n\nAs Deputies will be aware from my replies to a series of Questions earlier this year, I remain concerned about the specific case mentioned, which has been raised with the Israeli authorities on a number of occasions by our Embassy in Tel Aviv. The person concerned was arrested on 23 May 2005, and on 16 June 2005 the Israeli authorities ordered his administrative detention for six months. Despite a number of appeals and reviews, the detention order has been extended continuously since then. Most recently, on 14 November, it was extended for a further four months. The Department and the Embassy in Tel Aviv are continuing to monitor the situation in cooperation with Embassies of other EU Member States and in consultation with Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 40 and 101 together.\n\nIreland has been calling for action on cluster munitions within the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) since July 2002. We have consistently expressed our view that it is in the tradition of the CCW to address issues concerning weapons that have been shown to have indiscriminate effects.\n\nAccordingly, Ireland was one of six CCW States Parties (the others were Austria, the Holy See, Mexico, New Zealand and Sweden) which made a proposal last August for the Conventional Weapons Review Conference to draft a mandate for the negotiation of a legally binding instrument on cluster munitions. We welcomed, and were encouraged by, the appeal made by the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, on the opening day of the Conference, to take urgent action to address the issue of cluster munitions. By the close of the Conference last Friday, a total of 25 States had supported our call for such a mandate.\n\nThe Conference operates by consensus, however, and the mandate agreed on Friday provides only for the urgent convening of a meeting of governmental experts \"to consider further the application and implementation of existing international law to specific munitions that may cause explosive remnants of war, with particular focus on cluster munitions, including the factors affecting their reliability and their technical and design characteristics, with a view to minimising the humanitarian impact of these munitions.\"\n\nIn a national statement on the closing day, we regretted that the Conference was unable to agree a more comprehensive mandate to deal with this grave humanitarian issue but signalled that we will continue to work within the CCW process, and elsewhere, to seek agreement on a legally binding instrument on the use of cluster munitions.\n\nIreland also joined 24 other countries in a declaration recognising that cluster munitions are of serious humanitarian concern during and after armed conflict. The declaration called for an international agreement that would include a prohibition on the use of cluster munitions within concentrations of civilians and a prohibition on the development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of cluster munitions that pose serious humanitarian hazards due to their unreliability and inaccuracy.\n\nIreland was also successful in introducing language into the Conference Final Declaration \"noting the foreseeable effects of explosive remnants of war on civilian populations as a factor to be considered in applying the international humanitarian law rules on proportionality in attack and precautions in attack.\" This will increase the onus on military commanders in the field to give due weight to the foreseeable after-effects on civilian populations of whatever weapons and munitions are used on a given occasion. This is, however, no substitute for the international instrument on cluster munitions, which we believe to be necessary and which the Government will continue to pursue.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 91 together.\n\nThe question of Iran's nuclear programme is kept under constant review within the European Union at official level and is also the subject of regular discussions at Ministerial level. The most recent such discussion was at the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting of 13-14 November in Brussels, where Ministers received an update on latest developments.\n\nThere are currently no negotiations underway between the EU3 and Iran. Following Iran's failure to comply with the UN Security Council's 31 August deadline on suspension of enrichment-related activities, High Representative Solana, on behalf of the EU3, met with lead Iranian negotiator Ali Larijani on a number of occasions in September. However, these discussions failed to agree an acceptable formula for commencing negotiations. The EU side has been obliged, reluctantly, to conclude that Iran is not at this stage seriously interested in responding to the package of incentives presented to Teheran in June.\n\nAs a result of Iran's failure to comply with the Security Council's 31 August deadline, as set in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1696 of 31 July, the Security Council is currently discussing a second resolution that would impose additional restrictive measures on Iran, designed to increase pressure to comply with the Security Council's suspension demand. I would like to stress that the door to negotiations on the June package of incentives remains open should Iran choose to do what is necessary so that negotiations can commence. Meanwhile, the latest report from the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Dr El Baradei, continues to confirm Iran's lack of cooperation with the Agency's efforts to resolve the outstanding questions related to its nuclear programme. The matter will again be discussed by the IAEA's Board of Governors which is currently in session.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 46 together.\n\nAs I have previously informed the House, Ireland indicated to its EU partners in 2004 a positive disposition towards taking part in EU Battlegroups. I met the Foreign Ministers of Sweden and Finland in January 2005 and the Foreign Minister of Austria in April 2005 to discuss a range of issues, including possible Irish participation in EU Battlegroups. I also had the opportunity to discuss Ireland's expected participation in the Nordic Battlegroup with the Norwegian Foreign Minister, Jonas Gahr Store, during the visit of the Norwegian Royal couple in September of this year.\n\nEuropean Security and Defence Policy issues, including developments with regard to Battlegroups, are also discussed regularly at meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. The most recent of these discussions was at the joint meeting of Foreign and Defence Ministers in Brussels earlier this month.\n\nAt its meeting on 14 November 2006, the Government decided that Ireland would provide a contingent of the Defence Forces to participate in the Nordic Battlegroup. This Battlegroup will be on standby in the first half of 2008.\n\nOur partners in the Battlegroup will be Sweden, Finland, Norway and Estonia. These countries have agreed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining the principles for the establishment and operation of the Battlegroup. The Memorandum recalls that the \"fundamental framework for international relations is the United Nations\". It stresses that \"international law will govern the Battlegroup, taking into account the principles of the United Nations Charter\", and \"having regard to relevant UN Security Council Resolutions\". The Memorandum further specifies that the \"commitment of forces to the Battlegroup will be without prejudice to each Participant's sovereign right to make an autonomous decision on whether to deploy its forces to a specific crisis management operation\". In Ireland's case, the arrangements of the \"triple-lock\" of Government decision, Dáil approval and UN authorisation will apply in respect of any possible deployment of Irish troops. Sweden, as framework nation, has confirmed that it fully accepts Ireland's position in this regard, as do the other participants in the Nordic Battlegroup.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 41, 78, 84, 85, 96, 102 and 204 together.\n\nThe Government is deeply concerned by the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and especially by the rising toll of death and destruction in Gaza. We have conveyed our position clearly and consistently in direct contacts with the parties, including the Israeli Ambassador in Dublin and the Israeli Government in Jerusalem, in cooperation with our partners in the EU, and at the United Nations.\n\nI have unreservedly condemned the killing of 18 civilians, including women and children, in the shelling of Beit Hanoun by the Israeli Defence Forces on 8 November. I also condemn the killing of an Israeli woman in rocket attacks on Sderot on 15 November. The Government has called very clearly for an immediate end to all violence. This includes the Israeli military operation in Gaza and the firing of rockets on Israel from Palestinian Territory.\n\nThe meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels on 13 November strongly deplored the Israeli military action in Gaza and the unacceptable military operation in Beit Hanoun. The Council underlined that any military action should not be disproportionate or in contravention of international humanitarian law. The Government and our EU partners have reminded all parties of their duty to protect civilian lives. Israel has a legitimate right to defend itself against attack, but not at the expense of the lives and welfare of innocent civilians. I believe it was particularly important that Ministers agreed on such a strong message at the meeting of the Council and responded to the situation in this way, not least in view of the perception of possible differences of approach as a result of the votes cast on the draft Resolution in the UN Security Council on 11 November, which has been raised in a number of questions.\n\nAs Deputies will be aware also, an Emergency Special Session of the UN General Assembly on 17 November adopted a Resolution, which was introduced by the Palestinian delegation, which calls on Israel to cease immediately military operations which endanger the Palestinian civilian population in the Occupied Territories and withdraw its forces from within the Gaza Strip to their positions prior to 28 June 2006. The Resolution also calls on the Palestinian Authority to take immediate and sustained action to bring an end to violence, including the firing of rockets on Israeli territory. Following intensive coordination within the EU, in which our Permanent Mission to the United Nations was very actively involved, Ireland and all other EU Member States voted in favour of the Resolution.\n\nThe terrible violence of recent months underlines the urgent need to revive a credible peace process in the Middle East. There can be no military or unilateral solutions to the Israeli — Palestinian conflict. We have argued consistently that the only way forward for the Israeli and the Palestinian people is the negotiation of a viable two-State solution. The Government and our EU partners strongly support the continuing efforts of President Mahmoud Abbas to agree with Hamas and other Palestinian groupings on the formation of a national unity government. Given the context, it is not surprising that the negotiations have proved difficult, and that agreement has not yet been reached. There has been some evidence of differences of emphasis and approach in recent statements by spokesmen for Hamas.\n\nI have stated on many occasions that if agreement can be reached on a government committed to the negotiation of a two-State solution and based clearly on an end to violence, Ireland will argue strongly for a generous and creative political response from the EU and the wider international community. The Council on 13 November stated that a government with a platform reflecting the Quartet principles and allowing for early engagement would be a partner for the international community in re-launching the peace process.\n\nThe Government is convinced that the efforts of the EU in the Middle East must focus on actions which will improve the prospects for the achievement of a two-State solution. The operation of the EU — Israel Association Agreement promotes the dialogue which is essential if progress is to be made in rebuilding the peace process. Meetings of the Association Council with Israel also provide the opportunity for the EU to highlight its concerns on the human rights implications of Israeli security policies. I do not believe that the suspension of the Agreement, which would require consensus within the European Union, or other measures to restrict contacts, would serve the interests of any of the parties.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 42, 47, 76 and 97 together.\n\nThe Government attaches the highest priority to the issue of the undocumented Irish in the United States. This issue is actively on the agenda of the Embassy and the Consulates in the United States in their on-going discussions with the Administration and on Capitol Hill. I myself raise it in all my discussions with the US Authorities including, most recently, in a wide ranging discussion with the new United States Ambassador, on 1 November. I also had detailed discussions in New York on 10 November with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, an organisation that has been highly effective on Capitol Hill and beyond and which the Government has been supporting financially. I now look forward to further discussing and reviewing the prospects for immigration reform, in particular with key Members of the incoming Congress in the New Year. In this regard, my initial assessment is that the recent elections have given a boost to prospects for reform, though the issue remains a difficult and divisive issue both in Congress and in the United States generally.\n\nI should emphasise also that I very much welcome the continuing commitment of Senators Kennedy and McCain to the advancement of the comprehensive approach to immigration that they have long promoted and which the Government strongly supports. I also greatly appreciate the recent reiteration by President Bush of his on-going commitment to comprehensive reform in this area.\n\nThe Government's overriding objective continues to be to ensure that our undocumented citizens in the United States can regularise their status, travel freely to and from Ireland and ultimately secure a path to permanent residency. Despite all the difficulties and challenges, I look forward to further progress on this priority issue for the Government in the coming period.\n\nThe Government very much welcomes the firm commitment in the St. Andrews Agreement that the British Government is to establish a Forum on a Bill of Rights and convene its inaugural meeting in December 2006. The Joint Declaration published by the two Governments on 1 May 2003, in the context of their ongoing work to achieve full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, explicitly committed the British Government to \"work with the parties to facilitate the response to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission's proposal for a round table forum on the Bill of Rights, involving the parties and civic society.\" It envisaged that the round table forum \"will have an independent chair and its own secretariat, will be as inclusive as possible of Assembly parties and civic society, will appropriately involve the Human Rights Commission, mindful of its statutory role, and will be adequately supported and resourced.\"\n\nSince then, the Government has consistently raised the need for delivery on this commitment with the British Government, within the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. I discussed the issue with the Secretary of State at successive meetings of the BIIGC this year, where we also reviewed the useful discussions on a Bill of Rights between the political parties in the Assembly Preparation for Government Committee.\n\nThe discussions at St. Andrews resulted in an explicit commitment by the British Government in Annex B of the St. Andrews Agreement to the establishment of a Forum on a Bill of Rights and to the convening of its inaugural meeting next month. In order to facilitate delivery on that commitment, a public consultation process was launched by the British Government on 14 November. The consultation invites views, inter alia, on the draft terms of reference for the proposed Forum, the timescale for the Forum to produce agreed recommendations and the Forum’s proposed size, membership and structure. The consultation is ongoing, but will be conducted within a tight timeframe. Responses have been requested by no later than 28 November next.\n\nOn the question of Forum membership, the Government has always supported the involvement of political parties and civic society, as envisaged in the Joint Declaration. I made clear our support for such an inclusive Forum as the best means of facilitating debate on a Bill of Rights when I met with representatives of the Human Rights Consortium and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in Belfast in March of this year.\n\nThe role of Chair will obviously be critical to the success of the Forum's deliberations. It is the Government's view that the Chair should be clearly independent, have relevant human rights expertise, and possess the skills necessary to facilitate effective discussions among Forum Members. I made these views known to the Secretary of State earlier this year. We firmly believe that, in line with the Joint Declaration commitment, the work of the Forum should be adequately supported and resourced. I welcome the clear statement of intent in that regard in the British Government's Consultation Document of 14 November.\n\nWe will continue to engage with the British Government at political and official level in the coming weeks as preparations for the first meeting of the Forum proceed.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 98 and 112 together.\n\nA number of humanitarian crises in recent years have highlighted some shortcomings in the response mechanisms currently in use by the international community. This applies to both the response mechanisms of the European Union and of the United Nations. Efforts are underway to improve emergency responses internationally, which I fully support. Our Rapid Response Initiative complements these efforts.\n\nThe Rapid Response Initiative is designed to substantially enhance Ireland's response to humanitarian emergencies. Considerable progress has been made to date under its three elements:\n\n1. Pre-positioning and transportation of humanitarian supplies to disaster areas:\n\nOn Friday 13 October, I signed a Letter of Understanding with Mr James Morris, Executive Director of the UN World Food Programme (WFP) on the pre-positioning of humanitarian supplies. Under this two-year pilot programme, Irish Aid will fund the purchase and pre-positioning of humanitarian supplies at the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD) — the UN's main rapid response base, managed by the WFP — in Brindisi, Italy. The Brindisi supplies will comprise shelter and other non-perishable housing items such as kitchen sets, blankets, plastic sheeting, tents and mosquito nets, and water supply and sanitation equipment to benefit approximately 20,000 people. Irish Aid has consulted widely with several UN agencies, other donor countries and NGO partners to ensure that the composition and design specifications of the supplies comply with international norms and standards. Work is ongoing in respect of the development of a similar facility at the Curragh which will handle supplies in respect of approximately 10,000 people.\n\n2. Establishment of a register of highly-skilled and experienced individuals for deployment at short notice to emergency situations:\n\nThe idea behind the establishment of the register is to provide an opportunity for a Rapid Response Corps of skilled and experienced Irish personnel to serve at short notice in emergency situations. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) have been identified as appropriate partner agencies, which can provide the appropriate on-the-ground support for such personnel. Irish NGOs may also wish to use the register.\n\n3. Enhancing the emergency capacities of international humanitarian response agencies and mechanisms:\n\nFunding is being provided for the development of 4 regional humanitarian supply depots for UNHRD. Irish Aid will provide funding for the running costs of the regional humanitarian supply depot for Africa, which will be based in Accra, Ghana. Funding in the amount of €3.4 million will be disbursed in 2006 to strengthen the capacity of a number of key response mechanisms of the international humanitarian system — notably the key UN agencies and the Red Cross family.\n\nIrish Aid is working to improve humanitarian response capacities on a broad front through a number of activities complementary to the Rapid Response Initiative. I have provided €10 million in 2006 for the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) of the UN. This Fund is designed to provide rapid funding to agencies to enable them to respond much more quickly to emergency situations. I have pledged an additional €20 million for 2007. Funding is also being provided to the International Federation of the Red Cross to build local capacity to meet emergency needs. We are also in discussions with NGOs with the aim of assisting them to build more capacity in emergency response.\n\nAs announced during the recent debate on the White Paper on Irish Aid in the Dáil on 2 November 2006, the Department of Foreign Affairs will distribute a booklet on the aid programme to each household in the country in January 2007. The contents of the booklet will include a short overview of the White Paper on Irish Aid, information on the priority areas of work for Irish Aid and details of volunteering opportunities for Irish people. This mail-out is taking place in the context of the need to strengthen public awareness of the aid programme as outlined in the White Paper and in the debates in the Dáil and Seanad. Throughout the extensive consultation process preceding publication of the White Paper, this emerged as a key concern for Irish people. Ensuring public awareness of the aims and activities of the aid programme will be all the more important as the level of resources committed to overseas development increases.\n\nThe Government Supplies Agency in the OPW are currently tendering for the printing of the booklet as per public procurement guidelines. Following completion of the tender process, the booklet will be printed and distributed to approximately 1.6 million addresses by An Post over a two-week period beginning in the last week of January 2007.\n\nThe booklet will be funded from the Information and Communication budget within Irish Aid and the total cost of design, printing and distribution is estimated to be €310,000. The Information and Communication budget for 2006 represented 0.2% of the total ODA budget and it will remain the same for 2007.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 207 together.\n\nThe Independent Electoral Commission of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) announced on 15 November that President Joseph Kabila had won the presidential election run-off contest held on 29 October, securing 58% of the votes against 42% for his opponent, Vice-President Jean-Pierre Bemba. The results are provisional until endorsed by the country's Supreme Court, a decision which is expected within a matter of days. Mr. Bemba has rejected the outcome while at the same time making clear that he will use all legal channels to contest it.\n\nThe generally peaceful and orderly conduct of the elections in the DRC has been a tribute to the strong desire of the Congolese people for an end to conflict and the installation of democratic government. While some limited unrest has occurred, particularly following the announcement of the first-round results on 21-22 August, the presence of the EU's EUFOR mission, acting in support of the UN's MONUC peace-keeping mission and the Congolese security forces, has had a positive deterrent effect and has contributed to ensuring that such violent incidents were isolated. The priority now is for all parties in the DRC to respect the democratic verdict of the electorate, act within the law in dealing with any differences and work together to build a strong and inclusive government for the DRC and its people.\n\nThe European Union has played a key role in ensuring the successful completion of the transition process in the DRC. The General Affairs and External Relations Council on 13 November welcomed the conduct of the second round of the presidential election on 29 October and reiterated the EU's support for the new government and its efforts to develop the DRC. In addition to deployment of the EUFOR mission, whose mandate will end on 30 November, the EU and its Member States also contributed most of the financial support required for the holding of the elections. Nationally, Ireland contributed €1.3 million in support to the DRC electoral process and also provided seven members of the Permanent Defence Forces to serve with EUFOR.\n\nContinued international engagement will be crucial if the DRC is to have any prospect of overcoming the very many political and developmental challenges in the period ahead. The EU is already extensively engaged in support of security sector reform in the DRC, through deployment of two ESDP missions, EUPOL and EUSEC. Consideration is currently being given to the EU assuming a lead role in the coordination of future international efforts in support of this vital sector. It is also desirable that the mandate of MONUC should be extended by the UN Security Council for a reasonable period, to allow it to deal with the continuing threat, posed not only to the DRC but to the Great Lakes region as a whole, by the remaining armed militias in eastern DRC.\n\nThe Government has contributed almost €12 million for emergency and recovery activities in the DRC since 2003, with €6.1 million provided to date in 2006. Ireland is committed to continuing to support the DRC, including through provision of emergency and recovery assistance as well as any other forms of assistance deemed appropriate, as that country moves into a new era of democracy and development.\n\nAgreement on the draft UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was reached on Friday 25 August 2006 by the Ad-Hoc Committee, established by the UN General Assembly in December 2001 to carry out this task. The draft Convention outlines the general obligations of States in relation to the rights of persons with disabilities. It aims to ensure that persons with disabilities are given an equal opportunity to enjoy their human rights and specifies that discrimination on the grounds of disability is impermissible.\n\nThe text of the draft Convention is now being finalised by a Drafting Committee and the process of translating it into the official languages of the United Nations is under way. The Ad-Hoc Committee will reconvene on 5 December to give formal approval to the work of the Drafting Committee and the draft Convention will then be referred to the General Assembly. It is hoped to have the Convention adopted by the General Assembly during its current session.\n\nI welcome this significant progress towards the adoption of the Convention. Ireland will be supporting the adoption of the draft Convention when it comes before the General Assembly. Ireland, along with our EU partners, was an active participant in the meetings of the Ad-Hoc Committee. Ireland was represented at these meetings by officials from a number of Government Departments, including my own Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.\n\nIreland also actively supported the participation of civil society in the drafting process. Ireland has funded participation at the Ad-Hoc Committee by Irish NGOs representing persons with disabilities and has emphasised the importance of maintaining the unprecedented level of NGO participation in the drafting process. Ireland has welcomed the progress made to date and looks forward to the early adoption by the General Assembly of what will be the first human rights convention of the 21st century.\n\nThe European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) is an integral part of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), the principles and objectives of which are set out in the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice Treaties, approved by the people at successive referenda. The Union is continuing to develop its capabilities for crisis management operations, both military and civilian. The objectives which it has set itself are set out in the Headline Goal 2010 and the Civilian Headline Goal 2008. These include having the capability to undertake humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking, along with conflict prevention and civilian crisis management.\n\nThere are eleven ESDP crisis management missions currently underway, both civilian and military. The civilian missions include police and rule of law missions, security sector reform assistance, and border monitoring missions. The principal military mission has been the ongoing peace stabilisation mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina (EUFOR Althea).\n\nAn EU Planning Team has been deployed to Kosovo this year to prepare for an expected rule of law mission in Kosovo next Spring, in succession to the current UN mission operating there. Current and future ESDP missions were reviewed by Foreign and Defence Ministers at the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council earlier this month. Work has also been proceeding on the development of EU Battlegroups. Twenty-six nations — including Turkey and Norway — have committed to forming or joining these rapid response teams, which will reach full operational capability from 1 January next year. At its meeting on 14 November 2006, the Government decided that Ireland would provide a contingent of the Defence Forces to participate in the Nordic Battlegroup. This Battlegroup will be on standby in the first half of 2008. Deployment of the Irish contingent of the Battlegroup will of course remain subject to the requirements of the \"triple lock\" of Government decision, Dáil approval and UN authorisation.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 55, 107 and 108 together.\n\nIreland will not open diplomatic relations with Burma until Aung San Suu Kyi is released from house arrest. The Government consistently takes a strong position on Burma on all possible occasions, including in the European Union framework and at the United Nations. Together with our EU partners, we avail of all opportunities to call for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi, to condemn the abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms and deplore the lack of progress towards democracy in Burma. Ireland and our EU partners apply a range of sanctions and restrictive measures against Burma, referred to as the EU Common Position, which was renewed in April for a further year. In the absence of any significant progress in Burma, Ireland strongly supported the renewal.\n\nThe exchange of non-resident Ambassadors was put on hold by Ireland in 2004. Significant and positive moves by the Government of Burma, including and in particular — as I have indicated above — the release of Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest, will be required before any decision to proceed with an exchange of Ambassadors can be made. There has not been any recent direct bilateral contact with the Government of Burma. However, at the ASEM (Asia-Europe Meeting) Summit held in Helsinki in September, the Taoiseach raised the situation in Burma in the presence of the Burmese Foreign Minister and called for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. Burma attended as a member of ASEAN (the Association of South East Asian Nations) and was the only participant at the Summit not invited at Head of State or Government level. The EU Troika met with the Foreign Minister in the margins of the Summit to reinforce the EU's strong concerns about the lack of progress in Burma. We raise the issue of Burma with our ASEAN partners at every appropriate opportunity and I welcome their increased efforts to put pressure on the Burmese régime.\n\nIn my statement on behalf of Ireland to the 61st Session of the UN General Assembly on 26 September, I referred to the particularly grave human rights situation in Burma. I called, once again, on the Burmese régime to move towards democracy and to release all political prisoners, in particular Aung San Suu Kyi. These statements by the Taoiseach and myself are consistent with the strong position on Burma which Ireland takes on all possible occasions, including in the European Union framework and at the United Nations.\n\nThe situation in Burma was most recently discussed at the EU General Affairs and External Council Meeting in Luxembourg on 12 June. Subsequently, the UN Security Council included Burma on its agenda on 29 September when it was briefed by UN Under-Secretary-General (UNUSG) Gambari, who had visited Burma in May. In a welcome development UNUSG Gambari paid a second visit to the country earlier this month. These visits were the first high-level visits to that country by a UN representative in more than two years. I welcome the fact that during his visits he was able to meet with the most senior Burmese leaders, as well as with Aung San Suu Kyi and representatives of her party, the National League for Democracy. I strongly welcome the inclusion of Burma on the Security Council agenda. It is vitally important that the Burmese government allow the UN to play a role in promoting common ground between the government and the National League for Democracy so that the resumed National Convention can proceed in a more inclusive way.\n\nI remain deeply concerned that Aung San Suu Kyi has been detained continuously for over three years without charge and, once more, urge the Burmese government to restore fully her freedom and civil liberties. On 27 May, the EU issued a statement which deeply regretted the decision of the Burmese government to extend the house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi and deplored the fact that international appeals, including that of the EU, had once again gone unheard.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 74 and 86 together.\n\nI know that the Deputies will join with me in condemning in the strongest possible terms the assassination on 21 November of the Lebanese Minister of Industry, Pierre Gemayel. As I stated at the time, the killing is an appalling tragedy for Mr. Gemayel's family, to whom we convey our deepest sympathy. It also appears to be a further challenge to the legitimate, democratically-elected Government of Lebanon. All parties in Lebanon and in the region now have a clear responsibility to act to stabilise the situation in the country and to focus on the work of reconstruction following the terrible conflict this summer. The Government and our EU partners are determined to maintain our support for the Lebanese people and their Government.\n\nBefore the assassination of Pierre Gemayel, the Government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora was already under sustained pressure from Hezbollah, resulting in the resignation of a number of Ministers. Last week's meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels strongly encouraged all Lebanese parties to resume the process of national dialogue aimed at resolving the political crisis. It emphasised the EU's continuing support for the legitimate and democratically-elected Lebanese Government and its efforts to reconstruct and stabilise the country following the conflict. The Council called on all parties to comply with Security Council Resolution 1701, notably the arms embargo. It called on Israel to stop violations of Lebanese airspace by the Israeli Air Force, and on all countries in the region to refrain from any interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.\n\nOverall, the ceasefire in Lebanon has continued to hold well. The immediate cause of the conflict in July and August was the unprovoked attack by Hezbollah on Israeli territory, and the killing and capture of a number of Israeli soldiers. From the beginning, the Government called unambiguously for an immediate cessation of violence and the protection of civilian lives. We were particularly critical of the harsh and disproportionate military response by Israel, the very high level of civilian casualties and the widespread destruction of vital civilian infrastructure.\n\nAt the root of the conflict and the continuing political tensions in Lebanon is the absence of a credible process for a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. The unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 1701 on 11 August provided the basis for the ceasefire, and it continues to offers a path to a stable peace, based on the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon. The Government and our partners in the EU will remain actively engaged in support of its full implementation. The EU has taken the lead in ensuring that the deployment of the strengthened UNIFIIL force in Southern Lebanon, alongside units of the Lebanese Army, has proceeded smoothly and on schedule, and that the ceasefire has held. Building on the contribution of the Defence Forces to peacekeeping in Lebanon since 1978, Ireland is playing its part through the deployment since 31 October of a UNIFIL contingent, as part of a joint Finnish-Irish unit.\n\nI am aware of media reports that the Monitoring Group on Somalia which was established by the UN Security Council to monitor violations of the embargo on the provision of arms to Somalia is expected to transmit its latest regular report to the Council shortly. Among the reported findings are that Hezbollah has provided military training to the opposition Islamic Courts Union in Somalia, and that a Somali force of 720 militia members fought with Hezbollah in Lebanon during the recent conflict. The Government will examine the report when it is published. I understand that its findings will be considered by the Security Council in the coming weeks.\n\nThe announcement by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on 9 October that it had tested a nuclear explosive device was met with swift condemnation by members of the international community, including Ireland. I strongly condemned this provocative act by the DPRK as a threat to regional security and as running counter to the objectives of the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime.\n\nOn 14 October, in clear recognition of the gravity of the DPRK's decision, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1718. This resolution obliged the international community to enforce specific sanctions, including an arms embargo, as well as a ban on any items which could contribute to the DPRK's nuclear, ballistic missile or Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) programmes.\n\nAt a meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 16 October, the EU committed itself to the full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1718, as well as Resolution 1695, adopted in July in response to the DPRK's earlier controversial ballistic missile tests. A Common Position imposing restrictive measures against DPRK in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1718 was adopted by the Council on 20 November.\n\nSpecifically, the Common Position provides for a ban on exports of sensitive goods and technology which could contribute to the DPRK's nuclear-related, ballistic missile-related or other weapons of mass destruction-related programmes, and on the provision of related services; a ban on procurement of sensitive goods and technology from the DPRK; as well as a ban on exports of luxury goods and the freezing of funds and economic resources of persons, entities and bodies engaged in or providing support for the said DPRK programmes.\n\nThis regulation will enable EU partners to implement sanctions through their domestic law in a coherent manner. Preparatory inter-Departmental and inter-agency consultations are currently underway here, with a view to the early implementation of the necessary national measures.\n\nRecent reports that the DPRK has pledged to return to the Six Party Talks shortly without preconditions are a welcome development and I would particularly congratulate China for its efforts in this regard. This does not, however, mean that efforts to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 should weaken.\n\nAs set out in previous PQ replies, most recently on 24 May, I am aware of allegations regarding the harvesting of live organs from Falun Gong practitioners, including as set out in a recent Canadian report by Mr David Matas and Mr David Kilgour on behalf of the Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of the Falun Gong in China (CIPFG). I view these allegations seriously and enquiries on this issue have been made by the Department within the EU and UN frameworks, as well as through our Embassy in Beijing. Although our enquiries are continuing, no evidence has been found to date to support the allegations contained in the report. However, I understand that one of the authors of the report, Mr David Kilgour, is in Ireland this week, and I have arranged for a senior official from my Department to meet with him to discuss the findings of the report. Without prejudice to the outcome of the above enquiries, Ireland and the EU remain concerned about the situation of Falun Gong practitioners in China and have raised our concerns with the Chinese Government on many occasions.\n\nI am also aware of reports of a trade in human organs in China generally. The sale of organs for transplant is illegal in China. The Chinese Government introduced a regulation in July to govern the clinical use of body parts as well as the transplantation of body parts. Reports suggest, however, that an illegal trade in the organs of executed prisoners does exist. Wherever this practice occurs, and whatever the circumstances, the illegal harvesting of, and trafficking in, human organs is a deplorable act. This issue has been raised as part of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, most recently in October 2006. The Chinese authorities state that they are firmly opposed to the illegal trade in human organs for transplant.\n\nHuman rights issues are a constant and important point of dialogue with the Chinese authorities at both bilateral and European Union levels. The EU-China Human Rights Dialogue is the agreed formal framework through which the EU raises human rights issues and concerns with China. The latest round of the Dialogue was held in Beijing on 19 October.\n\nSenior officials from both sides discussed a wide range of human rights issues. Special attention was given to questions related to combating racism, freedom of expression and reform of the criminal justice system in China. The EU took note of the commitment of China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as soon as possible and, in that context, to reform its criminal justice system. The EU urged China to continue cooperation with, and implementation of the recommendations of, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, including the rapid abolition of the \"re-education through labour\" system. The EU expressed its deep concern over the continuing restrictions on freedom of expression in China, including on the use of the internet. The EU further expressed concern at the high number of human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists in prison and urged China not to harass or punish individuals exercising their right to freedom of expression in a peaceful manner.\n\nOn a bilateral level, I met with Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing on 12 May during a visit to Beijing. During the meeting, I had the opportunity to raise human rights issues and concerns, including the importance we attach to freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Chinese Foreign Minister Li referred in particular to China's commitment to the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue and was hopeful that a decision would be taken to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as soon as possible. Most recently, the Tánaiste held official talks on 25 September with visiting Chinese Vice-Premier Zeng Peiyan in the course of which he also raised human rights issues and concerns.\n\nAs I advised the House in reply to a similar question on the 25th October, fifteen Member States have so far ratified the Constitutional Treaty. Luxembourg and Spain have done so by referendum while thirteen Member States have ratified by parliamentary means. Finland is expected to complete its ratification procedures in the coming months. As the House is aware, the Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums held in France and the Netherlands last year.\n\nFollowing the referendum results in France and the Netherlands, the European Council initiated a period of reflection in order to allow time for further consideration of how to proceed with the Constitutional Treaty. In June 2006, the European Council agreed to extend the reflection period for another year and to focus also on the Union's delivery of tangible results to EU citizens.\n\nThe European Council also mandated the Presidency to consult extensively with Member States and to present a report to the European Council in June 2007. That report is to contain an assessment of the state of discussions with regard to the Constitutional Treaty and to explore possible future developments. The report is intended to allow the European Council to point the way forward towards decisions on the Constitutional Treaty, which are expected to be taken during the second half of 2008 at the latest.\n\nAs I stated earlier, Ireland's view remains that the Constitutional Treaty is a carefully constructed package and remains the best available option for equipping the Union with the means to meet the challenges facing us now and into the future. For this reason, we believe that any attempt to alter the essential balance and substance of the draft Treaty would be unlikely to succeed.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 60, 92, 113 and 116 together.\n\nThe St. Andrews Agreement published by the two Governments on 13 October underpins the Good Friday Agreement and sets out a clear way forward for all parties to commit to the full operation of stable power-sharing government in Northern Ireland and to full support for policing and the criminal justice institutions, including the Policing Board. It also sets out in some detail the practical changes proposed to the operation of the institutions, the arrangements for a financial package and the timetable for implementation of the agreement.\n\nAt St. Andrews, the Governments asked the parties, having consulted their members, to confirm acceptance of the agreement by 10 November. Further to these consultations and their contacts with the parties, the Governments announced on 10 November that they were satisfied that the St. Andrews Agreement, implemented in good faith, represents the basis for a political settlement.\n\nLast week therefore, the British Government published draft legislation to give effect to the St. Andrews Agreement. This legislation yesterday completed its passage through the Westminster parliament.\n\nThe legislation makes the necessary provisions to allow devolved government to be restored in Northern Ireland on the basis of the timetable set out at St. Andrews, which envisages restoration of the devolved institutions on 26 March 2007. It provides for a Transitional Assembly to meet from 24 November to prepare for restoration of the devolved institutions. It includes amendments to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to implement, on restoration, the practical changes to the operation of the institutions agreed at St. Andrews. It also includes provision for the Northern Ireland Assembly to be dissolved at any time before 25 March 2007 if it is considered there is no reasonable prospect of establishing a power-sharing government. In these circumstances, the Governments would move immediately to implement new British Irish partnership arrangements.\n\nIt was clear from our discussions with the parties at St. Andrews that some form of electoral endorsement of the agreement as a whole would be required before the formation of an Executive next March. The British legislation makes provision for this to be by way of elections to the Assembly in Northern Ireland on 7 March 2007. The Secretary of State Peter Hain has made clear however that an election would only take place in these circumstances, that is if it is clear that the parties are working constructively towards participation in a power-sharing Executive by 26 March of next year.\n\nAs to whether a referendum is required here, the Attorney General will advise the Government on any implications that may arise in this jurisdiction, once he has completed his examination of the final content of the British legislation.\n\nIn the course of our ongoing efforts to restore devolved Government to Northern Ireland, all parties have raised with us issues of particular concern to their membership. In our contacts with the parties we have consistently sought to address these issues as constructively as possible, and in line with our overall aim of achieving full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. The Governments believe the St. Andrews Agreement addresses the concerns expressed by the parties, including the DUP, in a balanced and fair way. We are satisfied that if it is implemented in good faith by the parties, it will clear the way for the restoration of the devolved institutions on 26 March 2007.\n\nI was encouraged that the Programme for Government Committee met for the first time this week and that it has now begun to address some of the practical issues that will face the restored Executive. We expect these preparations to intensify from tomorrow, once the Transitional Assembly gets down to work.\n\nThe St. Andrews process will continue to require careful management over the coming weeks and months to bring it to a successful completion. In that regard, there is a responsibility on all to play their part in making it work. The Government will continue to work in close partnership with the British Government, as well as with the parties to complete this task and clear the way for a new era for the people of Northern Ireland.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 200 together.\n\nThe humanitarian situation across West Africa remains a matter of the deepest concern. A number of countries, such as Sierra Leone and Liberia, are only now emerging from a bitter and destructive civil war, while conflict persists in some other states in the region such as the Ivory Coast. At the same time, the countries of the Sahel, specifically Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Niger, continue to exhibit extreme vulnerability due to climactic changes and desertification. The situation of the most vulnerable in these societies is of the utmost concern — a concern voiced forcefully by the United Nations earlier this year, which highlighted the fact that it is those most vulnerable sections of the community, notably women and children, which have borne the brunt of both the natural and man-made disasters which have afflicted the region in recent years.\n\nIreland provides emergency and recovery funding in response to humanitarian needs across the region:\n\nSince 2005, Ireland has had a development cooperation office in Freetown which oversees programmes in Sierra Leone and in neighbouring Liberia. This year, funding of over €6.8 million has been provided to assist in the recovery process in both countries;\n\nIn the Sahel region, funding assistance of €7 million has been allocated for humanitarian assistance in 2006;\n\nIreland's funding partnership programme with the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) provided funding of €1.5 million in 2006 and 2007, which is being partly utilised to help National Red Cross Societies in West Africa build local capacity to respond to humanitarian emergencies.\n\nLast year, the food crisis in Niger and surrounding countries highlighted a weakness in the system of international humanitarian response. Once the food security situation emerged, Ireland responded in a prompt and timely manner with support of €3 million to Niger and Burkina Faso as the most seriously-affected countries. Fortunately, the situation was quickly addressed and alleviated. In addition, a subsequent healthy harvest eased the most immediate needs.\n\nThe situation in Niger in 2005 helped to highlight the case for an enhanced international capacity to respond better to such crises. One result of this was the strengthening of the United Nation's Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). This fund now enables the UN to have immediate access to grant-based stand-by funding, thereby speeding response to rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situations. Ireland has contributed €10 million to the CERF in 2006 and we will double our funding in 2007, with a pledge of a further €20 million for 2007 at the forthcoming pledging conference in New York. I will travel to New York on that occasion for discussions with the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. Jan Egeland, to review global responses to situations like that in the Sahel region.\n\nI can assure the Deputy that this region remains of concern for Ireland and we are committed to ensuring that the vulnerable populations there receive the humanitarian assistance which they require, in a timely and effective manner.\n\nI am aware of the strong historical and cultural links between Ireland and the island of Montserrat.\n\nIn 1997, a major volcanic eruption affected the British Territory of Montserrat causing the evacuation of the population to neighbouring islands, or to the safer northern part of the island. Due to the existing damage and the ongoing threat of further eruptions, the southern part of the island has been declared unfit for habitation, which has forced more than half of the population to leave the island owing to a lack of housing.\n\nThe British Government has funded a substantial development effort in Montserrat. Apart from the basic needs of housing and sanitation, advances have been made in restoring health and educational services. Efforts to rehabilitate the island are aimed primarily at the restoration of the country's economic infrastructure. Redevelopment has focused on the northern third of the island, which is at negligible risk from the volcano.\n\nAs Montserrat is a British territory, the UK Department of International Development has taken a lead role in the provision of assistance to Montserrat and has provided funding of some £220 million for both development assistance and budgetary support since 1997. The population of the island now stands at approximately 5,000.\n\nIn 2001, a Montserrat delegation including the Chief Minister of Montserrat, Mr. David S. Brandt, visited Ireland and met with officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the National Software Directorate and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland. The focus of the Montserrat authorities was on rebuilding the tourism sector to reinvigorate the economy and to create greater employment opportunities.\n\nIn 2001, over €190,000 was allocated from Irish Aid to the authorities in Montserrat for assistance in the development of a National Tourism Strategy Document for the island. This support is an expression of the strong historical links that Ireland has with Montserrat. Since then, confidence has been restored in this sector. A particularly notable development has been the opening of a new airport in 2005 at Montserrat's new capital, Little Bay. This marks an important milestone in the economic regeneration of the island.\n\nImproving access to medicine is one of the critical challenges to improving health in the developing world. Many poor people do not have access to essential medicines due to a range of factors, including lack of drugs at health facilities, lack of trained staff to provide treatment and the high cost of medicine to poor people. Lack of access to medicine causes the deaths of many people each year in developing countries, particularly from HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria and infectious diseases in children. Access to medicine needs to be improved along with complementary measures for prevention and care.\n\nThe Government's commitment to health and tackling HIV/AIDS and communicable diseases is set out in the White Paper on Irish Aid. We are committed to developing programmes that address the key causes of illness and poor health among the poorest and most vulnerable people and to strengthening health systems in the poorest countries. Providing access to essential medicines is a key part of this response. The area of greatest need for medicine is for treatment of communicable diseases and the Government has committed €100 million annually to tackling HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases.\n\nIn Irish Aid priority countries, the approach taken is to strengthen health systems so that everyone can have access to essential services, including treatment of diseases. Measures supported by Irish Aid funding include the development of better drug purchase and supply systems, and increased availability of skilled health workers to treat sick people.\n\nA specific objective of the Government's partnership with the Clinton Foundation is to improve access to treatment for HIV/AIDS. The Government has committed €70 million from 2006-2010 to improving HIV services. Irish Aid is working with the Governments in Mozambique and Lesotho to make anti-retroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS available to all who need it. Success has been demonstrated in Mozambique where the Government of Mozambique has successfully introduced HIV treatment and at the end of June, over 27,000 people were on treatment.\n\nOne of the challenges in access to medicine is that drugs widely used in developing countries have become less effective. TB causes two million deaths a year, mainly in poor countries, yet there has been no major new TB drug developed for over 30 years. In 2006, the Government made a substantial investment in research and development for new drugs for TB and malaria. Irish Aid committed €9 million over three years both to the Global Alliance f"
