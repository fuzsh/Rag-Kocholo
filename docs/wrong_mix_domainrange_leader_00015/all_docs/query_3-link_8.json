        "text": "The main purpose of this proposal is to discuss the idea of ethics in editing. The answer is very difficult, otherwise there would have already been a policy or guideline. As such, do not attack the one who proposes this but discuss the idea of conflicts of interest and how to reduce them. One way is as follows:\n\nAll pages will have another tab at the top (like edit this page and history) which will say \"Disclaimers\".\n\nThere, all editors will have a space to list any potential conflict of interest. Now, too often we attack companies if an employee, even on their own time and initiative, write about a company. Yet other editors fail to disclose a conflict of interest. Such conflicts could include a Canadian NDP supporter writing about a NDP politician or an engineer writing about a patented chemical made by his company. The political supporter or engineer may, if questioned, say they are objective, but undisclosed conflicts of interest remain.\n\nAn example for the Matti Vanhanen article would be a new tab at the top saying \"Disclaimers\". When you click, it may say:\n\nDisclaimers\n\nThe following editors note their conflict of interest or lack thereof.\n\nSuomi Finland 2009 (talk) I am an employee of the Finnish government and a member of the Suomen Sosialidemokraattinen Puolue (SDP).\n\nor\n\nSuomi Finland 2009 (talk) I have lived in Espoo, the same city as Matti, and personally know him.\n\nThe reason for this suggestion is that a person saying they are a company vice president wrote to the help desk to request a factual correction and he was told he has a conflict of interest. Yet he was honest. Many of us have some conflict of interests that we almost routinely fail to disclose. This is bad. We are being dishonest. We can fix this easily with a disclaimer tab at the top.Suomi Finland 2009 (talk)\n\nRespectfully, Oppose. Unenforceable, so really unworkable. Editors are free to post such disclaimers in their userspace, and many do, but a prompt for editors to take this extra step when editing articles will either be ignored, or discourage editing altogether. bd2412 T\n\nWhat this means is that Wikipedia says it is ok to have a hidden conflict of interest. True, it is extra work but bare URL are much easier than non-bare URL references, yet bare URLs seem to be not allowed for DYK. Suomi Finland 2009 (talk)\n\nWhat bd2412 said. → ROUX ₪\n\nOppose. WP:NODISCLAIMERS. OrangeDog (τ • ε)\n\nComplete misunderstanding of the proposal. Nobody is asking for disclaimers. The proposal is to have disclosures. There is no such thing as WP:NODISCLOSURES. Suomi Finland 2009 (talk)\n\nIf this proposal isn't about disclaimers, why does it use the word \"disclaimers\" four times, including once in the section heading, to describe what it's about? Uncle G (talk)\n\nOppose. WP:NODISCLAIMERS. --Cameron Scott (talk)\n\nFrom WP:NODISCLAIMERS, \"For the purpose of this guideline, disclaimers are templates or text inserted into an article that duplicate the information at one of the five standard disclaimer pages\". So the application is a bit of a stretch, note that we do use disclaimers in several cases. Taemyr (talk)\n\nOppose even within talk pages, for most of the above reasons. If somebody feels compelled to disclose potential conflicts of interest, it would be useful to put them on user pages. It is also completely unenforceable in terms of policy unless self-disclosure has already happened. --Robert Horning (talk)\n\nComment I dont \"oppose\" the proposal but I agree that it is unworkable. Perhaps it should however be greatly encouraged to do so; as in a policy or guideline somewhere (WP:NPOV perhaps?) that editors are expected to disclose any COI they may have either on the talk page of an article or if it is a whole category then on their user/user talk page. I think using the word expected to do something may be taken by some that you MUST do it and by others that you don't and let the arguments unfold as they will, but I think this is in fact needed to be put in policy that COI's are expected to be disclosed. When I wrote Warinus de la Strode I believe I put out on the talk page that I am a direct descendant and thereby disclosed my COI in case my pride in my family at any way influenced any fluffy language to inflate the article, I didnt have to and no expectation was there that I should, but I did because I wanted to be honest and open. There are more pressing matters of COI in Wikipedia than that though, but this is probably the most common; not everything is about POV pushers and warriors. I'd like a caveat to be put in though restricting the expectation of disclosure to protect editors from having to ever release information on gender, sexual orrientation, race, or religion. It doesnt matter if you are Hindu writing about Hindu topics no one should ever be expected for a second to disclose their religion or ethnicity, or race.Camelbinky (talk)\n\nReally? A paid, professional advocate for a religion (e.g., any rabbi or priest) should not have to disclose his or her association to the topic, but a person who worked for a non-religious organization, even briefly or in a low-level job, should? And how would you avoid disclosing some of these things? For example, how do you disclose that you are descended from a notable person, without simultaneously disclosing that you have the same race as this notable person? WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nWhen we start making people have to declare that they are of African descent when editing an article related to Africa or people descended from there or we make Jews declare they are Jewish that opens them to harrassment and other problems. In my particular example I was able to disclose I am descended from Warin, an Norman-English noble and yet I am Jewish and that did not need to be disclosed (I have openly declared I am Jewish, I feel no need to hide it, but some may. It can be a sore subject for some of the older ones to be open about that, depending on where they grew up).Camelbinky (talk)\n\nOppose: Even if it were possible, it would be impossible (?!). No one even knows all of their own conflict-of-interests, nor can we determine what effects our opinions on matters, nor is any one neutral on any subject. For example, I've recently been editing the Dog meat article. Do I need to disclose that I'm allergic to dogs, and thus not a big fan of them? What about on politics articles--do I need to list my entire voting history and political affiliations, which have changed significantly over my life? What about someone editing, say, rape--do they need to disclose his/her history on the subject? Or, if I do some work to edit some obscure poet that I've never actually heard of, but I just found through Recent Changes, what do I disclose then? Again, I repeat my above assertion--everybody has a point of view. We cannot even know how our various point of views effect our own actions. Even if people wanted to \"disclose\" their point of view (and people above correctly point out that most won't), they can't. And, finally, what would you even do with this information, anyway? When you read a newspaper article, do you think \"I wish I knew what the POVs of the reporter and editor were, so I could better evaluate this information?\" Qwyrxian (talk)\n\nScientific article have disclosures all the time. A disclosure might be \"Jose Fernandez receives financial support from Dow Chemical and the American Chemical Society\" even if the article is on a chemical that Dow does not make. To say that onebody knows all their conflicts of interest so they should mention none is complete denial. Suomi Finland 2009 (talk)\n\nThose are disclosure of financial interest. And those are already covered by WP:COI. The OP is suggesting other types of disclosures, like residence, political affiliation, etc. I have no idea how far proposer was recommending we extend COI (i.e., in the original example, do I have to declare that, while I don't vote in Finland, my brother does? Or that one of my grad school professors was a Finnish nationalist? Or that I have the same last first name as the article subject, so I like him?), but no matter how far it is, it will never be far enough and always too far. We all serve many masters; in general, we don't even know who/what they are. Declaring any COI other than financial is both unreasonable and ultimately untenable. Personally, I'd argue that even financial COI doesn't have to be exposed, because I couldn't care less if someone's getting paid to edit, so long as the end product meets our standards; however, I'm well aware that consensus doesn't support such a position. Qwyrxian (talk)\n\nEven financial interests are not disclosed in Wikipedia. Too often, people will write about work related topics. That is a financial conflict. If I work for a bank, then this should be disclosed in a banking article. As one editor told me, he didn't think this proposal would pass but that getting people to think about an ethical issue is good. Suomi Finland 2009 (talk)\n\nOuting is now ethical? Should we also list home addresses, blood types and shoe sizes? (disclaimer: my grand-grand-gradmother was Greek, this makes me highly involved in Greco-Turkish affairs, and Zeus save me from editing Sophocles...) Should we all hire psychoanalysts to dig up those irrational creepy influences from the past that force us to write about dinosaurs and dandelions? Should we continue writing in public, at all, after this? Rant over. Editors declare their interests by writing the encyclopedia. You want disclaimers? Look no further than \"contributions\" button. East of Borschov\n\nOppose User talk page COI statements are more than enough, that way if an issue arises the user can point to the issue.Sadads (talk)\n\nOppose. This is like asking children to tell you before they steal some of your apples. Dmcq (talk)\n\nNot all COI edits are bad faith. An editor with a potential COI can have a genuine desire for an encyclopedic article, furthermore he is often in position of valuable insight. There is a reason that WP:COI is written the way it is. Taemyr (talk)\n\nOppose. The current policy is already calling for disclosure of potential COI. Editors with a potential COI needs to seek broader scrutiny for non-trivial edits, and if such scrutiny is in place a disclaimer should be superflous. If the scrutiny is not present then disclaimers will not remove the problem. Also editos who currently fails to seek such scrutiny does so for one of three reasons, because they are unaware of the current policy, because they are unaware of their potential COI, or because they are editing in bad faith. No stronger requirements for disclaimers will fix these problems. Taemyr (talk)\n\nI'm looking some general guidance on which policy or guideline prohibits the removal of source content, as I have been recently warned for doing so in good faith. In researching this topic I've found that this is something that people are regularly warned for, but I haven't been able to identify what the policy basis for those warnings is. Of course I understand that in many cases people will be removing content in bad faith, or to advance a particular POV, and of course that should be unacceptable, but in this case I was attempting to improve the readability of the article by removing some content that added no extra information at all. This is something I've done quite often in many articles, trimming sections down to increase the signal-to-noise ratio by removing redundant text. After all, I'm an editor, and this is something that real-world editors do.\n\nIs it really the case that no content can be removed from an article if it is sourced, no matter how redundant or trivial or outdated or just-plain-boring it is? I hope that is not the case because it would be a great disservice to the readers of our encyclopedia.\n\nThparkth (talk)\n\nI don't think there's any policy about whether you can or cannot remove text that is sourced. We do have WP:V that allows removal of unsourced text, but the contrary position is not affirmed. It is courtesy that if you are removing an inline source that is used elsewhere in the article to move the sourcing info there, but that's not a requirement and we have at least one bot that patrols those types of changes and fixes them.\n\nI would, however, engage a bit more to explain carefully why you are removing something that is sourced, since this does often look like vandalism. If you are running into pages where editors revert such changes, explain what you are doing on the talk page, and why you think the text is bad for the s/n ratio. You may better convince those that are reverting you now that your changes are beneficial. --MASEM (t)\n\nIs this a good time to re-visit One shot (music_video) then Masem? In that case you looked for citable references to support the removal to be listed in the Talk Page. The problem I have with that is that the text may fail WP:Burden if the cited source is later revealed to be unreliable or it may fail WP:NTEMP if the notability of the information in relation to the subject of the article has waned over time. The Burden should then fall on whomsoever wishes to replace the information to provide up to date citations which consensus declares to be reliable and not temporary. Recently I have been on the receiving of a Good Faith Edit akin to those being carried out by Thparkth and found myself agreeing with it because my sourced edit from years previous had turned from notable into trivial and did not deserve to remain in the article. Stuart.Jamieson (talk)\n\nThe policy is a bit fuzzy here because writing encyclopedia articles isn't an exact science. The closest you get is WP:PRESERVE, which asks editors to preserve appropriate content. However, what is \"appropriate\", and what is WP:NOT, is open to interpretation where reasonable minds may differ. I agree with Masem above that in some cases the issue is clear, e.g. unverifiable content, and that you should explain carefully in the cases which are not so clear. In general, I would say that any edit to an article should not remove relevant and basic information on the topic unless you are moving the coverage to another more appropriate article. On the other hand, no particular aspect of the article's subject should take up more than its fair share (I know, \"fair share\" is fuzzy) of the article. Sjakkalle (Check!)\n\nThe \"trivial\" and \"just-plain-boring\" remarks should probably be clarified here. In a lot of technical topics, sometimes details may not interest the general public, but may be important for comprehensiveness (for FA). For example, I write about lemurs, some of which are extinct and known only from their remains. I would not want someone coming through and deleting details such as \"skull length\" or fine details about craniodental features because they were \"trivial\" or \"just-plain-boring\". But otherwise, I know what you mean and I know where you're coming from. – VisionHolder « talk »\n\nI completely agree with you. I would personally never remove the kind of information you're discussing from an article. \"Trivial\" and \"boring\" can only be judged in context. All the same, if any of those articles note that Trachypithecus is an anagram of \"pussy architect\" then I'm probably heading for the edit button, no matter how well-sourced that fact is :) Thparkth (talk)\n\nUnflattering or inconvenient information about conservatives is always removed, no matter how many sources are attached to it. Nobody has done anything to stop it. See e.g. Talk:Conservatism in the United States/Archive 4#Edit war and Talk:Adolf Hitler#Hitler's DNA. Wnt (talk)\n\nNow I'm confused .. does Godwin apply or not? TB (talk) :)\n\nOf course. No matter how well sourced, the obvious fact is that Trachypithecus is actually an anagram of \"pushy architect\", not \"pussy architect\". ;) Anomie⚔\n\nWikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information; the bare fact that something appears in a source doesn't mean we have to mention it too. Ucucha\n\nIndeed. Information should be sourced to be maintained, but not all sourced information should be kept. Non neutral point of view WP:NPOV, undue detail WP:UNDUE and other reasons are perfectly sound reasons to remove sourced information. Arnoutf (talk)\n\nBear in mind that a non-neutral point of view typically means \"my opponents proved something, and my side can't disprove it, so it is non-NPOV to print only their version of events\". WP:UNDUE works much the same way. Wnt (talk)\n\nBut at the same time is it appropriate to remove factual, verifiable, and sourced information about a topic merely because it doesn't fit the current narrative of the article as espoused by the latest editor? To me, move the sources, the article text, and other related content to the talk page with a plea for somebody, anybody, to try and work the information in some form back into the article in that kind of situation. It is just plain wrong to indiscriminately remove information and a host of other Wikipedia policies apply when it is removed, including WP:NPOV, WP:OWN and a great many others. Generally when factual and sourced information is being removed the article is a much weaker article as a result.\n\nIncluding information put forward by another user is to me a sign that an editor is realistically trying to maintain a neutral point of view and is willing to admit from time to time that they don't know everything about a topic. You can debate the notability of the information or its applicability to the topic at hand, or perhaps that the content added should be moved to another project (like Wikisource if it is a substantial inclusion of original source material), but you should generally assume good faith when content is added to an article to work with that content. Such discussions about the quality of a source can and should be done on the article talk page instead of forcing it to an edit war.\n\nIf something appears in a source, is relevant to the topic at hand, and perhaps even more significant if it contradicts something mentioned in another source.... it not only can be added to an article I would suggest that it must be added in terms of being a responsible editor on Wikipedia. Question the quality of the source or something else related to the source, but if you can agree that the source is reliable then removing that tidbit of information is wrong and corrupting to the process of writing an encyclopedic article. There is some wiggle room here to argue about what can be removed (a poor quality source, mis-interpreting what the source said, etc.) but the basic principle is one that I think should be maintained. --Robert Horning (talk)\n\nWP:PRESERVE and WP:HANDLE used to be two separate sections at the editing policy. HANDLE was the explicit permission to remove bad information (e.g., contentious claims that could only be sourced to someone's personal blog), rambling details, etc., if the problem couldn't be fixed. It may be less clear now. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nAll said NPOV and UNDUE can be abused (for reasons of WP:OWN and the opposite POV), but sometimes they are clearly of relevance. For example insisting on a (well sourced) children saving plan of a local bank in Little Rock Arkansas in the main banking article would place undue attention to such a minor issue and should be removed even if well sourced. Ok, the example is a bit over the top, but not as much as you might thinks as we see people adding their local favorite regularly to all kinds of articles. Arnoutf (talk)\n\nI've noticed the infobox has a place for coordinates, and I got a map from following advice here, but don't know where to place the marker to get the coordinates. Unfortunately, there is some sort of glitch with using the physical address, which puts the marker several miles away.Vchimpanzee · talk · contributions ·\n\nThis page is for discussing Wikipedia policies, not a general forum for any random question you may have about editing. I suggest you use {{helpme}} on your talk page instead. Beeblebrox (talk)\n\nI disagree. Vchimp is trying to determine what should be used as the latitude and longitude for a location (presumably using a specific example that has brought the problem to light because the location isn't automatically found by the address). This seems like a valid policy question because one can conceivable list the coordinates for anywhere on campus. For instance, should the school's main office be used, some place in the center of campus, or some other location? Does it even matter and are their guidelines in place that dictate use of coordinates. Perhaps a more specific group like WP:COORDS could be consulted, but I don't think it's unreasonable to consult policy folks who may know exactly where to find rules on using latitude and longitude. —Ost (talk)\n\nExactly. I found an archived discussion on this very topic here, though it wasn't as specific as a college campus and it didn't quite resolve the question. There is a link I forgot to try; maybe I can post this there.Vchimpanzee · talk · contributions ·\n\nWe can discuss it here if you want. While I havent worked on college campuses I have worked on other large scale places of similar size (such as W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus and Port of Albany-Rensselaer). I would say to try and center it on the main campus (as many colleges have multiple campuses, University at Albany, SUNY for example has an uptown, downtown, and a suburban biotech campus several miles apart. For cities, towns, villages and such (which is what I normally work on) I always try to center it on the municipality as the city hall usually has a place for its coordinates in the infobox and therefore to put the same coords for the town itself is redundant. I hope this bit of experience helps, though it isnt any official policy, it works for me.Camelbinky (talk)\n\nSomeone else put the coordinates in the article after seeing my request here. I don't know whether it's kosher to put them in the text (now that IS a policy question), but the person gave the locations of the three campuses.Vchimpanzee · talk · contributions ·\n\nI think the rules of the English language state that a common name is a proper name, and thus should be capitalized.\n\nConventions for capitalization of species' common names seem to differ.\n\nThere are massive inconsistencies between article names, between the article name compared to its content, as well as mention of the common name within a given article.\n\nSome examples:\n\nBlack Rhinoceros: All upper case article name, and all upper case occurences within article\n\nBrown Bear: All upper case article name, and almost all lower case occurences within article\n\nKangaroo rat: Second word lower case in article name, and all lower case within article\n\n(Most articles are a mixed bag.)\n\nI think this problem has arisen because the policy is likey wrong. Editors don't know which to pick, and the outcome is split. There are constant page moves from one convention to another, and back again. If this gets sorted out either way, MOST animalia articles will be flawed or inconsistent. This is a serious problem, and a very visible blight upon Wikipedia. Anna Frodesiak (talk)\n\nWikipedia talk:WikiProject Animals is probably a better place to raise this issue. LadyofShalott\n\nThis has been brought up multiple times: Talk:Platypus#Capitalization, Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mammals/Archive_6#Common_names, Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mammals/Archive_7#Capitalization_debate (one I brought up), Talk:Platypus#Edit-protected.3F (the first part of the previous). There doesn't seem to be any stong consensus on the capitalization of vernacular names, however I strongly feel they should remain lower case. —Mikemoral♪♫\n\nFlora\n\nA worse problem is the naming of plants, where the project seems to have flown in the face of Wikipedia convention by adopting (mainly) Latin names, whereas all the books I have ever seen sources use the common name as the primary title, unless there is none, when the Latin name must be used. --Bermicourt (talk)\n\nI see what you mean. I don't have too much of an issue with naming articles by species or common name. I have done both. But the capitalization issue is nuts. If one article name is different from another, it's not the end of the world. But when the name is different from the content, that's a problem. Even worse is when the case keeps changing several times within the article. That should be resolved at once. Anna Frodesiak (talk)\n\nI have posted at WikiProject Animals. (Thank you LadyofShalott for that suggestion). Anna Frodesiak (talk)\n\nOne of the lead Did You Know's on August 29th (30th UTC, I suppose) is based on a highly speculative statement (Did you know that that Lou Gehrig (pictured) may not have died of Lou Gehrig's disease after all, but may instead have succumbed to chronic traumatic encephalopathy?). Even the source concedes the possibility is wholly synthesized (Although the paper does not discuss Gehrig specifically, its authors in interviews acknowledged the clear implication).\n\nI'm not advocating removal of the material from the article, I mean, it is sourced, but it's one claim flying in the face of 75 years of accepted medical conclusion and it seems we may be jumping the gun in giving the possibility so much weight. Lou Gehrig's Disease is a very well understood condition whose presentation is well documented (even in Gehrig's case). While CTE may be similar with regard to a couple symptoms, lending credence to such specious claims on the main page seems intellectually irresponsible.\n\n--K10wnsta (talk)\n\nI don't know. I think the hook does exactly what it's meant to do: hook the reader into reading the article. It's an interesting \"what if\"? that's relevant to the DYK article. — Coren (talk)\n\nI agree that it works as a hook, but analogously, so would something like Did you know the World Trade Center may not have been destroyed by planes alone, but may also have been blown up by controlled demolition? Sure, it's going to grab a readers attention, but do the ends justify the means?\n\n--K10wnsta (talk)\n\nIt is not just the NY Times that has reported this very interesting speculation, which I would say is more than speculation; I do believe it was either Scientific American or Discover (or both) that recently had quite an article on the new findings. Verifiable, not truth I do believe is the motto? If doctors/scientists/professionals who are published in reliable third-party peer-reviewed journals and newspapers say something who are we to say it isnt good enough for us? As far as the WTC hypothetical hook- find a professional with some sort of relevant background giving him/her an authority on the subject and who is published in a reliable third party peer-reviewed journal who has that hypothesis and then sure it could be a hook. Good luck. And that is the difference.Camelbinky (talk)\n\nThe point is the NYT piece is known to have gotten it wrong. See also the discussion at wt:WikiProject Medicine#ALS and NYT and Talk:Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis#Misdiagnosis_of_some_traumatic_brain_injury_as_ALS. LeadSongDog come howl!\n\nVerifiable not truth. Dont care to read Wikipedian's views and discussions regarding NYT or any of the multitude of other magazines, newspapers, etc that have covered this (including I believe National Geographic) because Wikipedian's views arent relevant. Give me medical peer reviewed journals that state for a fact that this is not legitimate research and speculation and then it is fine. Otherwise we have a conflict of sources and we present both. This thread isnt about the facts, it is about whether it was appropriate to put the \"fact\" as a DYK hook. The answer to that question is unquestionably YES, it was in fact appropriate. This is NOT the place to discuss whether NYT got it wrong.Camelbinky (talk)\n\nWell, that's the rub, there's no medical, peer-reviewed article (or journal) stating that Lou Gehrig died of anything other than Lou Gehrig's Disease. We have medical researchers who have impressed upon the similarities between a disease they researched and Lou Gehrig's Disease, which is certainly verifiable and, as I stated before, worthy of mention in the article. I just wonder if we should be trumpeting specious possibilities in an effort to call attention to an article.\n\n--K10wnsta (talk)\n\nImportantly, \"no peer-reviewed article\" includes the article that the NYT is supposedly basing this claim on. The actual article doesn't mention Lou Gehrig or baseball anywhere in it. It talks about the potential for misdiagnosis only in the context of players of American football and hockey (both sports with dramatically higher rates of head injuries than baseball). WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nI objected at TDYK but it moved on... Anyway, Gehrig doesn't care. ALS is a kind of shit that forces people to seek any possible clues - why? why me? Look at it from the other side - no one can help them. But simply reproducing a hypothesis wouldn't hurt either. False hopes? Yes. But maybe ten minutes of hope, even if false, mean a lot to a dying human. East of Borschov\n\nTo go back to the original question—I would say yes, this hook would have been better stated, \"that some journalists have speculated that. . .\" Chick Bowen\n\nMy new proposal is this (credits to Golbez (talk)): to put all featured content as Pending Revisions.Us441(talk) (contribs)\n\nSupport\n\nYes, but only while it is on the front page. Once it is replaced the next day it should go back to normal. -kslays (talk • contribs)\n\nIn practice, a lot of featured articles are closely monitored. Anonymous editors are especially reverted. We would save a lot of time and may even increase the chances of productive revisions if we forced users to log in to edit a FA. Shooterwalker (talk)\n\nFeatured Articles are community-chosen examples of our very best work. They have also attained a good level of completeness and polish, per the FA standards at the time of promotion and the level of participation in the FAC process. Thus 1) there is less of a need to edit the articles in the first place, 2) any random edit has a greater chance of bringing down the quality of the article than a random edit to an average or below average quality article and 3) we should avoid showing our best work to readers while it is vandalized. Therefore, edits to FAs by un-established editors should go through some level of review before going live to readers. There will still be many hundreds of thousands of average to below average articles that will be wide open. --mav (reviews needed)\n\nIf pending revs have any meaning behind them (apart from being a PR campaign), then their scope must expand. East of Borschov\n\nAll those people who say \"FAs are usually heavily watchlisted\" need to realize this is far from the case. On most of mine (and not just random video games, but things like Bone Wars), I'm the only major contributor still active or on Wikipedia enough to watch for vandalism. If pending revs is accepted by the community, I'm applying it to the FAs I've worked on regardless of whatever people say here. Its utility has far outweighed any \"but poor anon who wants to add poop jokes can't\" complaints. Der Wohltemperierte Fuchs(talk)\n\nYes, the trial run is showing clearly that this feature brings desirable stability to articles. The time delay factor is actually minimal: just enough to make scribbling unrewarding.--Wetman (talk)\n\nOppose\n\nBecause a. I don't like pending changes in general, and neither does a large portion of the community, so adding more pages for no real reason isn't effective, and b. why does it matter? if there's heavy vandalism, it'll need semi protection anyway. Otherwise, it can be easily reverted. Oh, and c. Protection is not a preventative measure, so just protecting all the FAs isn't helping, just slowing things down, especially as pending changes is really slow. —fetch·comms\n\nThe point is that since featured articles are reviewed anyway, the FA review process, that has caused so much comment in the pending changes trial, can incorporate pending changes review. Uncle G (talk)\n\nBut there's no need to have an extra slow layer of relatively ineffective \"protection\" for articles that are already monitored. Half of our FAs are rather obscure topics that are not vandalism targets; the other ones can be semi'd when needed. I'm not opposed to using PC for a TfA (today's featured article) when needed over semi-protection for that day, but not for all FAs without need. —fetch·comms\n\nSeconded. SchuminWeb (Talk)\n\nPer Fetchcomms. — Tanvir\n\nOppose because it violates the basic spirit of Wikipedia, and is unnecessary because FAs are typically heavily watchlisted. Thparkth (talk)\n\nPer Fetchcomms; the idea of pending changes seems antagonistic to a founding principal of wikis in general. We should especially encourage editing of FAs, since they're our most prominent works (of course we ensure that they're not vandalised, but that can be done with careful use of watchlists), and telling those whose edits aren't automatically accepted that their edits aren't yet visible really doesn't seem a way to encourage the understanding that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that anyone can edit. Nyttend (talk)\n\nper above (esp. Nyttend). Hobit (talk)\n\nDreadful idea. Almost all of the people doing the reviewing will have no idea about the subject, and many of those who do will have to have their edits accepted, and perhaps lost in the confused muddle that is pending changes. Malleus Fatuorum\n\nOppose. Pending changes only hides things from people not logged in; it makes no difference to the tens of thousands (hundreds of thousands?) who are, so it introduces complexity for little benefit. And reviewers are anyway supposed to accept anything that isn't obvious vandalism or similar, but those edits can be kept out without this additional layer of bureaucracy. SlimVirgin talk|contribs\n\nOppose. We should use our best content to encourage editing, not discourage it. Powers T\n\nOppose. Pending changes protection works best for articles with a low edit frequency on a small number of watchlists. This proposal could easily tie things in knots. That said, some articles may end up not being watched by many people before or after their time in the limelight, so maybe it could be used selectively for featured content not on the main page. Yaris678 (talk)\n\nThis is a very bad idea. For FAs that don't get a lot of edits anyway, this just fixes what isn't broken. For FAs that get a lot of anon IP vandalism, this confuses anons and new editors. It gives them some sense that poorly worded and uncited changes are somehow legitimate, it makes editors who watch these FAs work harder to overturn poorly written passages cited to unreliable sources, and worst of all, pending changes on main page day FAs makes it very difficult to revert vandalism. Not all FAs should be partially protected, but some very certainly should be. Assuming all FAs automatically deserve pending changes does not help anon IPs and it does not help the articles. --Moni3 (talk)\n\nOppose We deal with featured content vandalism just fine, and in doing so, we demonstrate a) how open Wikipedia is, b) how 'on the ball' we are. PC adds complexity; also, it is not yet ready, and likely to be removed in the near future. Chzz ►\n\nOppose that this be blanket-applied to all FAs. Many of the ones I maintain don't get a lot of edits; those that receive a lot of vandalism are already semi-protected. A lot of people know a little bit about many of my article subjects (the Texas Revolution, particularly), but what they \"know\" usually doesn't reflect recent research - I have seen people revert changes because they think its vandalism when it's really factual information. I'd rather keep these articles off the pending changes list and let editors who know the subject take a look. Karanacs (talk)\n\nThat doesn't quite make sense. Anyone registered can still made edits to semi-protected articles no matter how knowledgeable they are. Having FCs won't change a thing in that respect. Saying \"keep it off the list so only experts will see it\" smacks of anti-Wikiism or something. ♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫ (talk)\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that most FA-class articles deal with fairly specialized material, and it's likely there are only a handful of editors here who know the sources well enough to identify whether some changes are vandalism or good-faith misinformation or valid information. Adding pending changes to these articles means we'll be duplicating effort - a PC reviewer may be the first one to look at a change and make a decision, then a content expert will need to look at the same change and figure out whether it's valid or not. Why add the extra step, burdening another reviewer? I'm not speaking for all FAs, but there are a large number that are adequately watchlisted and/or experience little or no problem with vandalism, so why add complexity? Karanacs (talk)\n\nNeutral\n\nHello, and thank you for your patience with me. I hope I am posting to the correct place; my apologies if I am not.\n\nMy question deals with an entry that has already been made by someone else, and the subject is about an old car made in 1953. My father was the one who designed the car, and quite frankly, there is NO ONE more qualified to write about the history of this car than I am. I tried writing something about the Venus Car a year or so ago, however, was booted off as being opportunistic, or someone who had something to gain by writing about this car, which I guess falls within the \"conflict of interest\" policy.\n\nBut I assure you, my only goal is to have the history of this interesting car available on Wiki, even if I have to hire a 2nd person write it for me.\n\nYou I guess my question is why can't I write this story? The current entry about the Venus Car is totally wrong and inaccurate.\n\nThank you Patrick McLoad —Preceding unsigned comment added by Mcload (talk • contribs)\n\nCould you expand on this a little more? The article Venus Automobile seems to be pretty much in the same shape as you left it. There is some stuff about WP:COI to worry about, but I don't see why you can't make this a much better article.\n\nAnd please, start by uploading some pictures! Wnt (talk)\n\nAs this seems to be a recurring phenomenon, I believe we need to create a separate, distinguished criteria for passing notability for restaurants. I would like this to go before a large audience and eventually have a proper vote on it. I stand on a more conservative side of this issue, leaning towards excluding restaurants that may meet general notability guidelines. I think that this is what has caused such a large divergence in opinion, simply because no specific set of rules exist for restaurants. It is my opinion that by following current rules for notability, we are allowing the insertion of unencyclopedic restaurants to pass through, and adherents to the general rules have something to lean on during a debate for deletion.\n\nA large supporting source is the New York Times, an obviously reputable source, which constantly reviews restaurants in its dining section. What this gives writers is a safe source for maintaining notability; one could potentially write an article for a restaurant on a weekly basis citing this source. There are certainly other highly used sources which weekly feature restaurants which can be used. It is my opinion that even though these are used countless times (by myself in many articles I've written), they do not give notability. Every restaurant has a history, and some may be certainly very interesting, but that does not make it remarkable. To quote myself from a related discussion:\n\n\"I worked at a restaurant as a cook for 8 years that was featured every year by the local news (nj news12) and the owner has gotten a ton of good reviews for it simply because he has connections and wanted the exposure. It is utterly unremarkable and does not belong in an encyclopedia, but if this is a trend, maybe I will someday write a fluffy article about the hardships he faced climbing up the ladder, sacrificing whatever it was he did.\"\n\nThat is an empty threat, but my point is that if the owner had any interest in Wikipedia (yet he luckily doesn't even have an interest in the internet), he could probably meet general notability guidelines and have a very well referenced article. I do not wish for this to happen.\n\nI have a general set of rules which I would like to propose to determine eligibility for notability for restaurants which I will list.\n\n\"A restaurant may be notable if it is independently sourced for something other than the fact that it's a restaurant that got good reviews, and has some sort of history.\"\n\nThe owner is notable.\n\nThe workers are notable, like a notable chef.\n\nNotable regulars, like if a celebrity frequents and supports the restaurant.\n\nHistorical significance, like an old restaurant or site which has been or is currently a restaurant (a fictional example being... George Washington's house has been converted into a diner).\n\nIf something notable happened there, maybe even one time event as the host article.\n\nExtraordinarily remarkable cuisine, like serving extremely exotic or unique food which no other, at least regionally, restaurants serve which is well sourced and noted just for that.\n\nSocial significance for the community.\n\nI would like to start a discussion, cause I grow tired of the back and forth regarding restaurants and notability, and I want any supporting contributors to revise or add rules. Thank you very much - Theornamentalist (talk)\n\nAs someone who isn't familiar with restaurant reviews as a journalistic practice, could you explain why reviews of a restaurant in multiple reliable sources shouldn't satisfy general notability requirements? Not every restaurant that exists will get reviewed, so how is it different from a film or a book getting reviewed? If it's purely just a matter of how localized the coverage is, I'm sure there are ways to distinguish between a review in The Cowtown Enquirer and The New York Times without resorting to an insistence on the restaurant's significance. postdlf (talk)\n\nI don't think this is necessary. What makes such restaurants \"unencyclopedic\"? If there are multiple independent sources, then there should be enough to write a neutral, verifiable article on the subject. Note that per Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies), purely local coverage is generally not enough to meet notability standards. Many of the proposed guidelines are also looser than the normal notability rules, in particular, several run afoul of \"notability is not inherited\". Mr.Z-man\n\nTheornamentalist, can you explain why you think that the usual rules for businesses (which are slightly stricter than WP:GNG's \"presumed notable\" level) aren't normally good enough?\n\nAlso, I agree with Mr. Z-man that many of your suggested criteria are actually banned under current rules, for being far too loose. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nto Postdlf - The New York Times writes reviews all the time because they have to, not because it's news or notable. Therefore, it seems that a restaurant in the tri-state area will likely get a review simply because that's typically the extant of the NYT's coverage.\n\nto Z-man - My main concern is that businesses can pay for this type of coverage, the fact that a restaurant serves food and it's cited to a reliable source, should not make it notable. I know some of these conflict with inheritance issues right now, but I would like to revise them (with the help of those who agree and even those who do not fully); I am trying to come up with a way to orderly separate an unremarkable restaurant from one with some actual encyclopedic value. - Theornamentalist (talk)\n\nto WhatamIdoing - Simply put, they allow for articles like this to exist, which I oppose. - Theornamentalist (talk)\n\nMy goal is to avoid lengthy discussions like this, it seems like there are definitely issues with a given restaurants' notability, and instead of going through the motions every time, I think it would be good if both sides could agree on a set of rules. - Theornamentalist (talk)\n\nThis subsection of WP:N seems relevant: \"The evidence must show the topic has gained significant independent coverage or recognition, and that this was not a mere \"flash in the pan\", nor a result of promotional activity or indiscriminate publicity, nor is the topic unsuitable for any other reason. Sources of evidence include recognized peer reviewed publications, credible and authoritative books, reputable media sources, and other reliable sources generally.\" I don't think that a single restaurant review, even in The New York Times, is generally going to be enough to meet the bar. I don't think the problem is that we don't have a guideline, it's that it's not being followed in all cases. Beeblebrox (talk)\n\nto Beeblebrox - Then maybe instead of rewriting policy, an official guideline regarding Restaurants needs to be created (pending further input for support..); something like WP:HAMMER, to name one regularly in use and subject specific. - Theornamentalist (talk)\n\nIn Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Teaneck Kebab House, I've argued for keep on the grounds that, while only one restaurant review in a major newspaper's dining section isn't enough to establish a restaurant's notability, this particular restaurant has had two such reviews in two different major newspapers. In an area like New York City where restaurants exist by the tens of thousands, this is no small feat, even when one of the reviews is bad. The reason why WP:GNG calls for multiple reliable sources is that we don't want a subject to be considered notable on the basis of just one lucky break with the media. If there are at least two, from mutually independent sources, that would indicate that the subject is at least interesting enough to get these two sources involved.\n\nHowever, I have just one caveat with regarding multiple restaurant reviews as being enough to establish notability: the Montreal Gazette has stated time and again in its dining section that its restaurant reviewing team does not accept invitations from a restaurant's owner. That should be the case for every review used to establish a restaurant's notability. -- Blanchardb -Me•MyEars•MyMouth- timed\n\nWhy just restaurants? Why do reviews count for notability for any product, service or company at all? Reviews are routine coverage of routine things. Everything gets reviewed. Magazine racks are full of dedicated product review magazines with hundreds of reviews and then even more reviews in every special interest magazine too. I mean, get real, out of 121,000 Google hits I am sure I could extract two reliable source reviews for the muffler on my car, but that doesn't mean it is notable! Reviews prove existence but not notability. We want to document the notable things, not the ordinary things. A review can demonstrate notability by documenting claims of out-of-the-ordinary things but the existence of a review merely proves the existence of the product. SchmuckyTheCat (talk)\n\nGood point, but for some reason there tends to be disputes about restaurants, I support your opinion, but I was hoping to crack this egg first, not the whole basket.. - Theornamentalist (talk)\n\nI also have to concur that reviews should not constitute reliable sources for anything other than verifying a restaurant's (or other product's) existence, which is not enough to establish notability. One counter-intuitive problem with allowing reviews to establish notability is that it necessarily means that restaurants in smaller cities will be more likely to be notable, on the grounds that a local newspaper has fewer restaurants to cover, and thus any given restaurant is more likely to be reviewed, compared to a restaurant of similar size, stature, income, etc., in a larger city.\n\nAnother way to tackle this is to deal with the issue in WP:COMPANY, which requires that \"Evidence of attention by international or national, or at least regional, media is a strong indication of notability. On the other hand, attention solely from local media, or media of limited interest and circulation, is not an indication of notability; at least one regional, national, or international source is necessary.\" The key here that needs to be resolved, of course, is papers like the New York Times, which serve a dual national/local purpose. One of the big issues at a recent high profile AfD was that some editors (including myself) believed that while the NYT is a national paper, the restaurant reviews are a part of their local coverage (found in what I believe is called the Metro Section), and thus don't qualify. If a restaurant were featured in the Business section, that would be notable coverage, but the reviews by themselves are not. Others, however, argue that such an analysis is a type of POV/OR on our part, and there's no way to clearly state that the reviews are only intended for a local audience. Qwyrxian (talk)\n\n*sigh* Yes, it's obvious the Metro section of the NYT is regional coverage, sometimes people take policy a little too literally. whose AFD\n\nPersonally, I am less interested in whether the coverage is regional or national versus whether the review documents an extraordinary claim. For example, Sunset (magazine) has articles every month reviewing \"5 Crab Shacks on the Maryland Coast\" which are great food porn, but say nothing indicating the five crab shacks are extraordinary other than the travel writer decided to stop in that town. For the broader product category, national coverage is a given, again, in national magazines on every magazine rack. Again, the review needs to document an extraordinary claim beyond mere existence. SchmuckyTheCat (talk)\n\nBut such a write up could indicate (but not necessarily guarantee) notability. It does not need to say it is notable. Local (which is typically regional for large cities) should not be disregarded.Cptnono (talk)\n\nI think one option is to expand WP:ORG to introduce a \"new\" criteria: Notable businesses have normally received noticeably more media attention than similar businesses.\n\nMy primary concern is that while I think some editors are thinking this at AfDs, nobody seems to actually come right out and say it, and ORG has a general goal of reflecting the actual practice as seen at WP:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Organizations. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nOppose Please see Mzoli's - an article of this sort whose AFD was well-attended by the community and which was kept. The proposition is that restaurants, as a general class, are not notable, even though it is agreed that they commonly attract independent detailed coverage in reliable sources. Because this class of topics passes our general notability guide, this proposition rests upon the personal opinion of the nay-sayers. It is their POV or judgement that such topics should not be covered here. By objecting to such coverage, they wish to censor the project contrary to core policy. The nay-sayers do not seem to have any special status which would set them above other editors, the founder of this project nor the independent professional editors and publishers who decide that such topics do merit notice. Having worked themself in a restaurant does not qualify an editor for a special, expert opinion as such work is commonly menial labour and familiarity breeds contempt. Colonel Warden (talk)\n\nI wish you'd stop Mzoling us: that article is of little help for a number of reasons, namely:\n\n1 - Mzoli is not a restaurant, but a sort of wholesale butchery, around which a number of restaurants opened; in other words, if anything, it is a restaurant cluster\n\n2 - The concept described in point 1 is rather unique; most restaurants that would be affected by this proposal are something like, uh, a run-of-the-mill kebab house in Albany.\n\n3 - The majority for keeping Mzoli was not clear-cut, and the article was written by Jimbo Wales; many of those who voted to keep the article explicitly did so out of respect for such a venerable editor.\n\n4 - The whole AfD discussion for Mzoli, which is far too personal and acrimonious to be a template for how things ought to be discussed on wikipedia, was obscured. Editors with a certain expertise can still dig it out, but the fact that it is, at least in the intention, hidden from view is, in my opinion, a clear sign that wikipedia doesn't wish for it to be a precedent.\n\nAnd, incidentally, deletionism (which I do not myself support, until ridicolously irrelevant things like prize dogs' sleeping habits start popping up on DYK) is a legitimate and widespread point of view on wikipedia. Calling its supporters menial, censoring nay-sayers is not particularly mature, and doesn't really help the mood of the discussion. Complainer (talk)\n\nJust as a comment, what tends to happen with restaurants, local businesses, local bands, local sports teams, etc. is that while there are multiple secondary sources to cover these, they tend to be from local sources that question their independence to some degree. No, this is not to say that a newspaper has a vested interest in the well-being of a restaurant, but instead they do have one to the local community. The smaller the community the source servers, the less independent that work becomes, and thus begs the question of notability of anything strictly sourced to these types of works. Note that a source normally considered to be a work on a large scale (like the NYTimes) often will still have a local section, and while all the rest of the newspaper will generally be independent, this part will not be.\n\nIn other words, it is not that we need a new guideline for restaurants - they should already be covered by WP:CORP if not the GNG. Instead, it is recognizing that local sources cannot be considered independent of the restaurant, and while usable as general sources, do not do a good job to establish the restaurant notability. --MASEM (t)\n\n@Colonel Warden--I just want to say that it's not me being POV, at least not in the sense that you mean. It's my POV that interpreting either WP:GNG or WP:COMPANY to imply that reviews establish notability is an improper interpretation that is counter to the goal of the encyclopedia. I'm also not saying that restaurants are, as a class, non-notable--that would be unacceptable POV. I'm saying very specifically that specific restaurants to not meet WP:GNG, which states that there must be \"significant coverage,\" and that a review does not meet the definition of significant; and also that it must be \"independent of the subject\", and not all reviews meet that criteria, either. I don't mind you disagreeing with my/our position, but you are wrong to claim that we're POV pushing in a way counter to core policy. Rather, we simply have differing interpretations of what core policy means. Yes, interpretation of policy is a point of view (just like being an eventualist or an immediatist is a point of view), but neither of them is a POV in the sense of WP:NPOV.Qwyrxian (talk)\n\nWP:N helpfully defines what is meant by significant coverage: \"Significant coverage\" means that sources address the subject directly in detail, so no original research is needed to extract the content. Detailed reviews therefore satisfy this requirement. Furthermore, reviews in journals such as the NYT are commonly thought to be satisfactory for other topics such as plays or other attractions which may be of interest to their readership. Your ideas about significance seem constructed in an ad hoc or ex post facto way to produce the result that you desire - the elimination of articles about restaurants. There seems to be no objective reason to discriminate against restaurants and so doing so would be an overt bias or prejudice which would be contrary to core policy and other policies such as WP:CENSOR. Colonel Warden (talk)\n\nShouldn't we be more interested in building an encyclopedia with articles of encyclopedic value, not blindly obeying core policy? We make the rules... - Theornamentalist (talk)\n\nAn encyclopedia, by definition, includes everything worthy of note. Different people have different ideas as to what is worthy of note. We have no special status which entitles us to use our own POV for this purpose, as if we were the snooty maitre d' of an exclusive establishment. Instead, we rely upon the independent judgement of the professionals who write upon such things. For example, consider your first contribution to Wikipedia - Dance for the Sun. This seems to be a collection of children's music which some might think trivial and unworthy. In evaluating this, we look to see what independent authors have said about it. This doesn't seem to be much but I shan't be leading the charge to delete your work as it seems to have some possible value and good sources may yet be found. It is our explicit policy to be tolerant of such weak contributions in the expectation that they will mature and improve over the years. This is our essential method as we are not paid for our work and so cannot be held to deadlines or specific demands. Our volunteer nature requires tolerance and patience and it is our explicit policy that we are not here to make rules which do not assist us. Colonel Warden (talk)\n\nI am not questioning whether or not we are in a position to decide what is noteworthy and encyclopedic, I am questioning our ability to discern advertisements under the guise of news articles. Common sense tells me that the Kebab House does not belong in an encyclopedia, just as it generally does so in keeping Schmuckythecat's muffler from having its own article.\n\nAnd for the record, I am slightly embarrassed by that being my first article.. :) - Theornamentalist (talk)\n\nYour more recent work seems more embarrassing. :) Colonel Warden (talk)\n\nHa, I reverted to a version that still had vandalism by the same IP, I need rollback. - Theornamentalist (talk)\n\nI think for purposes of AGF, unless the article specifically says \"paid advertisement\" we cannot presume a restaurant review was made purposely as a commercial advertisement. I still argue that one can apply the concept of local coverage of local events losing independence as a reason to avoid such reviews however. --MASEM (t)\n\nWe also need to put Wikipedia:SPAM into the mix. I'm just putting out a hypothetical situation, but one could \"bribe\" local reviewers and whatnot into giving a restaurant rave reviews, and via this, \"create\" a legitimate article according to the rule and regulations of Wikipedia.--293.xx.xxx.xx (talk)\n\nThis is definitely a possibility. Although, as noted above, there are newspapers that boast that they won't do that, we can't be sure that it is the case. Ironically, should that happen to be the case, the restaurant that bribed the newspaper reviewer into being reviewed (regardless of whether the review itself says) and the deception is uncovered, the restaurant becomes notable for another reason when the newspaper's competition jump all over the bribed reviewer. -- Blanchardb -Me•MyEars•MyMouth- timed\n\nThere are some strange claims above, such as that we can unilaterally decide to disclaim restaurant reviews based on our own unsupported notion that they may not be truly independent of the subject, or that a critical review of a product or service should somehow not count as a reliable source in determining its notability. There's obviously a difference between a review that describes the history of an establishment, its founder, etc., and one that just tersely says \"Good decor. Short wait. Pizza is a must.\" A review does not necessarily have significant coverage of a subject, so the question always remains as to whether it can actually be helpful in writing an article. Re: the hyperbolic muffler review claim above, a review that lists members of a category of products in a table with numerical scores of efficiency, cost, whatever, would not count as significant coverage in anyone's view. If someone actually bothered to write a few paragraphs about a particular model of muffler, however, then there may be something to the topic. At least based on the discussion so far, I'm just not seeing any workable general principles here that would exclude any or all reviews from consideration towards WP:GNG. postdlf (talk)\n\nOppose, WP:GNG and WP:ORG should be sufficient. --SarekOfVulcan (talk)\n\nSupport, at least something along these lines, or some amendment to GNG and CORP to tighten them up. At the moment it's simply too easy for people to say \"cited in NYT, must be notable, per guidelines.\" However, restaurants - and hotels and shops among other things - surely need some substantive notability above and beyond being featured once or twice in the lifestyle, travel or regional supplements, even of major newspapers. There is a massive difference between those sections and the main news section. It's not about reliability as such, but about the nature and the purpose of the coverage. There are hundreds of thousands of papers around the world, and among them, hundreds of what might be termed top flight, national or semi-national ones. Most have at least one restaurant critic, who is invited to or sent to at least one restaurant on a weekly basis, usually in the city where that newspaper has its offices, to tell their readers what the food is like there. Similarly, travel journalists will be packed off to hotels and resorts (often as part of a PR jolly, which I don't think is quite such a problem when it comes to local restaurant reviewing), to provide readers with guidance/ideas as to which holiday they might wish to buy. Those visits will usually result in quite a detailed review or even fuller feature. Are we saying that every restaurant featured here, here or here gets a WP page, at least if we can find a corroborating cite in a second publication? What function would that serve other than to provide a directory that tells the reader \"you can get a meal in this place, and here's what a couple of reviewers thought of it, to help you along\"? N-HH talk/edits\n\nVote\n\nAt this point, with a fair amount of variety in opinions and suggestions, a formal vote is in order. Please note that this is intentionally non-definitive in either support or opposition of the inclusion or exclusion of specific ideas, just a chance to define what we will accept in the future to avoid lengthy arguments which involve referring to contrasting rules, essays, guidelines, policies, laws, or examples.\n\nI would like to see a clarification in the rules or a new guideline regarding the legitimacy of any restaurants' notability.\n\nSupport\n\n- Theornamentalist (talk)\n\n- N-HH talk/edits Definitely need at least clarification of existing general guidelines - \"trivial\" coverage should be explicitly taken to include simply featuring in regular review spots or columns, even in major newspapers. The problem is, as noted, that there is enough wiggle room there currently to allow articles on every two-bit local restaurant - whether created as spam or in good faith - to survive AfD, just because a couple of papers did their weekly review spot on the place. Two editors cite that interpretation of policy, and suddenly there's no consensus to delete.\n\nHerostratus (talk) Some comments: 1) There is a restaurant wiki here, and that is where most of these articles belong. We have transwikied vast numbers of articles to wikia.com sites and we could do it again. 2) While it might be OK if we had neutral articles on every restaurant (although see point 1), it's practically impossible to have balanced coverage because 2A) it's a crapshoot which restaurants will be in and which not, and 2B) most of these articles are basically puff pieces. If there was a Wikiproject:Restaurant Neutrality dedicated to ensuring that restaurant articles gave fair place to negative information and removing puffery, then maybe that would be OK instead.\n\nI support this, in the context that all products, services, and companies should disregard routine reviews as evidence of notability. I note that most, or at least many of those that have commented so far, in the oppose camp seem to agree with this broader scope and seem to be opposing a specific guideline for restaurants and the WP:GNG should be enough. To them I say, well, the GNG isn't working, so let's modify the GNG. Maybe the next discussion needs to be on the WP:N talk page. SchmuckyTheCat (talk)\n\nLargely for the reasons the above two users have given, but partially because restaurants are something of a unique category unto themselves that don't really fit anywhere else. Each one is unique, and most newspapers have sections reviewing them. It's not the same as something like law firms, because there are daily reviews of different ones; with law firms, only the notable ones get any attention, and the non-notable ones struggle in obscurity. Quite frankly, I think this same issue exists with books, but I don't want to go there now. With the exception of huge chains and places like Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana, which are undeniably notable on multiple levels, it's difficult to determine what constitutes enough variety in sources to establish notability, leading to discussions about obscure, ordinary kebab houses in the boondocks out in Albany. The Blade of the Northern Lights (話して下さい)\n\nSupport. I am late to the discussion, but what is missing is any consideration of published restaurant guides. Many of these - for example the Zagat guides in the United States - deal with regions or cities but are national, indeed international publications: they are for tourists. And many of them are published by reputable publishers. It is a slam dunk that they pass WP criteria as reliable sources offering national coverage. But, whatever the editorial content, many of these guides are basically directories, listing as many restaurants as they practically can, the good, the bad, the fly-by-night. Inclusion even in a national guide from a respectable publish does not mean that a restaurant is notable; it means that the guide is trying to be a fairly comprehensive directory of restaurants which simply exist. Now look back at the newspaper reviews on which these discussions are always focused. As Theornamentalist cogently argues, these mandatory weekly and bi-weekly reviews have similar status; their function is to sell papers and ad space. WP:RS is simply too blunt a tool to deal with absolutely every type of content we have to evaluate. The point is not to exclude some restaurants or to include more or less all restaurants, but to make up our minds which it is. That restaurant guides and newspaper reviews can be left to do the job is out-of-touch with reality, because by their very nature - they don't care about notability - they try to cover just about everything. My perspective is that of a restaurant critic and author of a dining guide (and no of course that doesn't make me an authority here).KD Tries Again (talk) KD Tries Again\n\nNeutral\n\nThe arguments have some merit, in that restaurants are a hotbed of irrelevant articles--the source of this very proposal is some incredibly irrelevant kebab house in Albany that I proposed for deletion. However, Wikipedia has already so many policies that nobody can remember them all and all too often the one that's forgotten first is the one about common sense. As a matter of fact, I was a fierce opponent of special policies for BLP, and derided the ones for notable pets; supporting special ones for restaurants would be inconsistent. I just wish WP:MILL were made into an official policy, which might make this proposal redundant. Complainer (talk)\n\nI don't see any reason to treat restaurants in a different fashion from other organizations that are commonly written about. The problems that exist with restaurants apply with equal or greater force to schools, television stations, radio stations, small newspapers, and so forth. There are ways to make WP:ORG better, but a special, restaurants-only rule probably isn't it. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nI say, let each article be judged on it's own merits on a case by case basis, but with a caveat. It's pretty hard as it is to control Wikipedia's rapid growth as of late, where anyone or anything with a few verifiable blurbs can automatically have an article. I can also point to several specific subjects (certain TV shows for example and there myriad of articles about each of their episodes) where it seems that no matter what policies you can point out, people will vehemently support the articles in a Afd queue from being deleted. Yes, we do need some reining in of redundant and nonsense articles, but when do we implement a/or start to actively tackle them? We can't even agree with the current policies!! There is a problem, but it's not at the point where we need a massive overhaul of the rules. --293.xx.xxx.xx (talk)\n\nOppose\n\nUnnecessary, likely requires refinement of selection of sources at WP:N than a new highly-specalized guideline. --MASEM (t)\n\nWP:CREEP: I don't think that there is any problem here serious enough to require a new guideline. --Arxiloxos (talk)\n\nWe already require that coverage must be nontrivial. Routine reviews, local paper blurbs, etc., are trivial coverage. We don't need more subguidelines, we just need to follow the rules we've already got. Seraphimblade Talk to me\n\nA systemic bias against restaurants would be contrary to core policy. Colonel Warden (talk)\n\nWP:ORG is good enough. No need for a new one. Alzarian16 (talk)\n\nWP:GNG and WP:ORG should be sufficient. --SarekOfVulcan (talk)\n\nGeneral notability guideline is fine. Davewild (talk)\n\nThe existing rules seem to cover the main issues here. If they aren't being enforced fully, new rules won't help. Mr.Z-man\n\nThere is enough in the existing guidelines laid out at WP:CORP that can be applied to restaurants just as well as to any other business or product. Reviews in major publications is certainly not something exclusive to restaurants. -- Blanchardb -Me•MyEars•MyMouth- timed\n\nOppose this entire process as nothing specific is even being proposed. We're having a vote to decide whether we should even try to write a policy? No thanks. Beeblebrox (talk)\n\nAnother stillborn attempt to regulate ... one of the least contentious area on wikipedia. No firm proposal indeed (the first criterion, that of being owned by a notable person is a deal-breaker: no inherited notability). Use general guideline. East of Borschov\n\nAlthough I do somewhat sympathize with the proposal, this is instruction creep aimed at a specific type of commercial establishment, and does nothing to address similar dubiously notable subjects as local music bands, buildings, local businesses and charities, and other factors. Maintaining the current policies, and in time perhaps merging some of the smaller, less developed articles into another article, is an idea which can still be used. John Carter (talk)\n\nOppose I echo the sympathy, but we've got far too many specific guidelines already. GNG is the cover-all; 'keep it simple'. Chzz ►\n\nNasty comment if special guidelines e.g. WP:ORG are used to prohibit things allowed by WP:GNG, then we should stuff like WP:Notability (Pokemon characters) to squeeze out even lower-importance categories of articles. But I think that deleting one another's types of articles as unimportant rapidly turns into a library-shredding competition. Any article about any subject should always be notable if it meets the basic WP:GNG criterion. And I don't see anything obvious in WP:ORG to contradict that. Wnt (talk)\n\nUnnecessary instruction creep; existing rules sufficient. --Cybercobra (talk)\n\nIf the establishment meets general notability with in depth coverage in multiple reliable sources I think its inclusion in wikipedia is appropriate. Solid State Survivor (talk)\n\nPer above, I don't see a need for this. Ajraddatz (Talk)\n\nQuestion: Is a listing in a restaurant guide \"in depth coverage\"?KD Tries Again (talk) KD Tries Again\n\nI seem to recall some policy or guideline or essay or something in the Wikipedia: namespace about not including in a biographical article the things that a person is thinking about doing or would like to do, because those are just unrealized ideas. However, I can't find that now. Does anyone know what page this might be? Thanks. --Metropolitan90 (talk)\n\nWP:CRYSTAL? OrangeDog (τ • ε)\n\nI'm pretty sure this is not the way it's supposed to be done.\n\nFor those who accuse me of asking about one article, I'm saying this may be an example of what Wikipedia is not.Vchimpanzee · talk · contributions ·\n\nIt definitely fails notability, but ignoring that, its plot fails WP:WAF and WP:NOT#PLOT and overuses NFC images. --MASEM (t)\n\nThis is something of a recurring problem. We have over 3,000 articles in Category:Wikipedia articles with plot summary needing attention, with the oldest dating back to January 2007 as I write this. Perhaps we should target them next when we've finally sorted the unreferenced BLPs! Alzarian16 (talk)\n\nEeeehhh, unreferenced BLP actually have a potential legal hazard to Wikipedia; bad plot summaries (or articles on fiction without sources) aren't an issue that needs expediency. That said, I certainly see a possible task force to help get appropriate WProjects involved to understand what articles are tagged, suggest other articles for merger (possibly deletion) due to lack of notability, and so forth, but without the gusto of the BLP one. --MASEM (t)\n\nI don't think we should be deleting plot summaries because that is all there is, instead it needs expanding to add the context, refs etc. We could expand the notability criteria to say that an episode of a notable series is also notable. Wikipedia typically has great coverage on TV shows. Graeme Bartlett (talk)\n\nDo we really want every episode of a notable series being declared notable and therefore have every single episode of Bonanza or Law & Order or the Simpsons? Those three series alone would cause for so many episodes that it becomes ridiculously unmanageable to make sure all episode articles are taken care of in a decent amount of time. We should limit articles to tv episodes to actually notable tv episodes that were reported about in third-party sources. Just because it exists and people are fans doesnt mean we need every single episode as a stand-alone article. The episode where the Fonz jumps a shark waterskiing would be a notable episode since it led to the phrase Jumping the shark. Unless an episode is relevant such as that, then why keep it? Because we are an indiscriminate collection of knowledge? Oh wait, we arent...Camelbinky (talk)\n\nI been trying to wrangle WP:FICT long enough to know that there is no precedent or consensus to assert every TV episode notable; each episode needs to meet the GNG like any other topic. Which is why I suggest that if we wanted to make a task force to handle these plots, we would be informing projects about it, giving them time to work it out and expand if possible, and at worst merging as a redirect to a list-of-episodes articles. Do also note that not every entry on the list noted above is a TV episode. --MASEM (t)\n\nI'd echo what Graeme Bartlett said: this is an area in which Wikipedia generally has excellent coverage, and this should be appreciated and enhanced, not diminished.--Arxiloxos (talk)\n\nWhile that may be, a lot of that enhancement has been in consolidation. We don't, generally speaking, need a full article for one more episode of any given show. Now, of course, some episodes (the jumping the shark episode was mentioned above) are notable on their own merits, and most certainly should have a separate article. But most are not, and are notable only in context of the show they're part of. Given that, the proper presentation is also to keep them with the show they're part of (or as a list of episodes emphasizing the whole), not as a standalone article that largely consists of an over-detailed plot summary and perhaps some trivia. Seraphimblade Talk to me\n\nIt's been well established that tv episode articles that lack any coverage outside of being a TV episode are generally merged and not kept. This is consistent with established policy (specifically WP:V regarding lack of 3rd party sources, and WP:NOT#PLOT on articles comprised mostly about plot, in addition to WP:WAF and WP:N. That said, I would certainly not want to delete/merge existing articles on TV episodes without editors being given the reasonable chance to expand plot-only articles to include things like reception. If they can't be expanded, they can always be merged into a larger episode list with a shortened summary. --MASEM (t)\n\nPlot summaries and \"reception\" (viewership? or do you mean something more?) is not enough! You need actual third-party (not TV guide!) coverage that shows the EPISODE was in fact somehow notable in its own right for some reason. Just because you can write an article about something does not make it notable. Please, if an episode exists with nothing more than a plot summary and some numbers on viewership and nothing substantial that shows it is notable for some sort of cultural reason then DELETE DELETE DELETE and let it be part of a list of episodes on the tv show's article page or some sort of spin off page but it does not deserve its own article. It makes a mockery of Wikipedia and makes us something we are not. I am sorry there are lots of editors who love to make these types of articles because they love the show and are a fan. We are not a fan site. There are other places for your hard work, just not here. Yes, you are large in numbers, but this isnt a democracy, those articles simply factually do not meet our standards at all.Camelbinky (talk)\n\nI haven't found anything yet, but with the show's 50th anniversary there will surely be mention of the show's most popular episodes, and I have heard or read that this is one of those.

Can you make Wikipedia rationalist (inclusively atheist) ? —Preceding unsigned comment added by Iohana4 (talk • contribs)\n\nNo, Wikipedia tends to respect all viewpoints, religious orientations and personal beliefs. Ajraddatz (Talk)\n\nIf anything Wikipedia is agnostic. The very fact that we are not chauvenistic (the real meaning, not to be mistaken with male chauvinism) and we are not overtly religious is why Conservapedia hates Wikipedia so much. We dont put the US first, we dont put the Christian religion first, we dont put ANYTHING first other than our collective belief on creating an accurate encyclopedia of knowledge.Camelbinky (talk)\n\nI would also challenge the idea that being \"rationalist\" and or \"scientific\" is somehow better than our current point of view--essentially (in my opinion), that we attempt to match up our writing to the properly weighted and attributed points of view of people writing on the topic in the \"real world. What do we gain by moving to a point of view that favors a certain group of voices over others? Wouldn't this also push our systemic bias even farther towards the western, privileged classes? Qwyrxian (talk)\n\nWikipedia is entirely rational. It speaks facts on all matters; in religion, a figure is X; Religion Y is the belief of Z; etc. etc... I know no instance on Wikipedia where a purely religious aspect is described as objective fact. So your request comes across as odd, without making any statement on where Wikipedia lacks rationalism. --Golbez (talk)\n\nIt's not just religion, Wikipedia does not side with anyone's beliefs about what is good or bad, but only describes objectively confirmed events neutrally. 61.7.120.132 (talk)\n\nMoved from VPT Is it appropriate to indicate if a source is in public domain with a in the reference such as in the references section at Ringed_Seal#References?

I can't think of any reason there would be a need for us to indicate in the references that a source is PD. As opposed to what is done for example at Apollo#References, but even there IMO the icon is superfluous and seems to have been added quite recently, and I can't find the discussion that led to it.

(Btw, this discussion is really more suited for Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)). — Blue-Haired Lawyer t\n\nI've looked at MOS:ICON but it doesn't explicitly mention the use of icons in references/citations.

Is this practice even standard among any of the citation styles? —Farix (t | c)\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation reported that a prominent user-content-generated website was planning on implementing a method of paying its contributors a share of its advertising revenues. Weber, \"YouTubers to get ad money share.\" (BBC). I posit that Wikipedia, also a prominent user-content-generated website, should explore implementing the same policy. Of course, some revenue stream has to be tapped to make it worthwhile. More importantly however, if wikipedia users could share in the revenue generated by the website, more individuals would contribute higher-quality content, as opposed to now where editing wikipedia is akin to giving to charity. What's stopping us from implementing this? Donald Schroeder JWH018 (talk)\n\nA complete ban on advertising on Wikipedia. See Wikipedia:PERENNIAL#Advertising. postdlf (talk)\n\nThe point is, once users look at advertising not in the abstract, but as a way the users themselves can directly monetarily benefit, perhaps advertising will be seen as more beneficial. Anyway, I didn't know there was a \"complete ban\" on advertising. Where is that written? Furthermore, I'm not proposing anything old-hat, what I'd like to discuss is the revenue-sharing idea that other websites are advocating. Donald Schroeder JWH018 (talk)\n\nAmong the many other problems with this... how do you determine who gets the money? The people with the most edits? The people with the best edits? Only people credited with creating a featured work? --Golbez (talk)\n\nI say the people with the most edits. ;-) Seriously, though, Wikipedia has no \"revenue\" to share. bd2412 T\n\nIndeed. Plus, would such a move potentially jeopardize the Foundation's 501(c)(3) status? SchuminWeb (Talk)\n\nThere'd be no way to filter out vandals and non-constructive edits. Bots would be among the highest paid if it were just by number of edits, and if it were by kb added, then people who contribute by pruning crap out of articles would get nothing, and people who revert blanking vandalism would get a lot. postdlf (talk)\n\nWell, I dont know if there would be \"no way\" to organize this in order to be fair to all editors. That's why I brought it up here . . . so that we can hash out the guidelines for paying editors dividends like other user-content websites. Perhaps we should allow advertising for the purposes of having revenue to share. Just a thought huh. Donald Schroeder JWH018 (talk)\n\nJust a thought, but I think in order to make revenue-sharing fair we'd actually have to have a real-life human being (or a panel) actually reviewing user's edit histories. I dont think payment would be automatic -- a user probably would have to apply for remuneration and be evaluated for such. Donald Schroeder JWH018 (talk)\n\nAnd then there would be disputes - why did the panel only award me x? And then an appeals process. And then litigation. And increasing greed for more advertising to earn more money. And then some becoming professional Wikipedians... And then we will have lost the original spirit behind Wikipedia. --Bermicourt (talk)\n\nFollowed by \"And after I spent six weeks' insisting that I deserve 16% of revenue from this obscure article rather than 14%, I discovered that the total revenue from the entire article was only twenty cents, and they never pay less than US $10 at a time, because of the cost of bookkeeping involved.\"\n\nIn short, it's not worth it. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nNOOOOOOOO Wikipedia is not supposed to be based on financial gain, this proposal runs against the very core ideas of what it is we are doing here.

Beeblebrox (talk)\n\nI don't think the core ideas have anything against making money per se. Jimbo's a fan of Ayn Rand, who was always in favor of making an honest dollar. But not when it compromises the integrity of the project. And it's hard to think of any way of keeping that from happening (even if there were any revenue to share, which of course there's not). --Trovatore (talk)\n\n\"Why not?\" Because there's no money; there's no process for allocating the money; there's no system for dispensing the money; and a lot of people would object to the philosophy.

Donald Schroeder JWH018 (talk)\n\nOn a more serious note, I would really appreciate if the Wikimedia Foundation would provide me with a tablet computer of some kind. My edit history will show that I am a constant editor when free to edit, but I have hour+ commutes in the morning and afternoon that I would be using to edit madly if I had the tool for it. If any sort of \"revenue sharing\" was to go on, that's the kind that should. Cheers! bd2412 T\n\nFlattr? MER-C\n\nWikipedia is not based on financial gain. It is a free encyclopaedia in every sense of the word - speech as well as beer.\n\nAdvertising is something that has been repeatedly discussed and repeatedly thrown out due to the inherent problems of having advertising.\n\nSuggesting that people would look at the debate differently once they know they could benefit from ads is tantamount to bribery. It implies that Wikipedia users are easily-swayed imbeciles who will change their stance on a principle because they have some gain out of it.\n\nLinked to the above point, nobody here got in it for cash.\n\nIt would be impossible to determine who gets money for what; do we say that only content writers get money? what about anti-vandalism? should it be by raw editcount? what about people making bad edits? So on, so forth.\n\nNone of us got in it for cash, and the principles behind refusing to allow ads are not likely to change because there's money in it for us. Wikipedia does not need advertising or to pay its users to stay afloat.\n\nWe currently have a complete ban on paid editing; I'd love to see how this idea would interplay with that. Ironholds (talk)\n\nWe do not have a complete ban on paid editing. See WP:PAID for links to the two (currently unapproved) proposals, both of which would permit some kinds of paid editing. See WP:WikiProject Medicine/Google Project for one example of paid editors that the community is—far from \"completely banning them\"—grateful to have helping us. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nI think that the issue of ad revenue for Wikipedia should be distinct from the question of rewarding editors, since this could come from outside grants or donations, and advertising might be done simply to cover server and employee costs.\n\nI think that rewarding editors can be done, but it must be done cautiously. An example of an incautious reward would be that a certain computer game manufacturer looks over the edits about its articles, picks out some key fans, and sends them generous care packages of games and computer equipment (or at least, tickets to claim them sent via Wikipedia e-mail). Note that the lack of transparency and clear strain on WP:NPOV are what make this objectionable.\n\nBut a different philanthropist might set up another way to reward Wikipedia editors. All editors are put through a primary screen for number of edits and byte count. Text that is new versus old is marked, and an effort is made to create easy links to contemporaneous discussion pages. A statistically guided \"random\" set of 50 edits is chosen from these and sent to a group of volunteers. Each volunteer runs through 50-100 edits from 50 different people, rating the quality on a few characteristics. (Volunteering might also be required for people to have a chance to win? A handful of standard edits, especially those meant to sense certain biases in judgment, might also be used to discount some ratings) By summing up the quality ratings, and multiplying by the number of edits per each person, a group of winners can be generated in nearly neutral fashion. The winners would then receive a modest sum - not really enough to be worth the time on an occupational level, at least not at first - and the recognition of having been selected as a quality editor. Wnt (talk)\n\nGiven the vast success of Wikipedia as a purely volunteer project, it doesn't look like financial incentives are necessary or even desirable. If you don't want to edit without getting paid, don't edit. SDY (talk)\n\nI gladly volunteer time for this project because it is a beneficial, worthwhile project. It is also a non-profit project—no one makes money from running Wikipedia, not even WMF or Jimbo Wales. I'd much rather see money go toward paying for servers, hosting, and the few paid staff we do need in terms of WMF and developers. If we should ever have a surplus of cash, I would really like to see that going toward purchasing the rights to different types of media and releasing them under a free license.\n\nIf this were a for-profit product, you bet I'd demand a share of the profits (or, more likely, I would never have worked on it at all). But it's not, so there is no profit to share. For WMF to attempt to retain profits for personal enrichment would be a gross violation of federal law. That's what 501(c)(3) means.

I feel that I have already been overpaid. pietopper (talk)\n\nWith all the cultural pull to be dishonest already coming from outside Wikipedia, adding financial temptations for skewing text and spewing credible scribble, for minute pay, seems to miss the Zen of Wikipedia, which is that you do get no credit, do receive no reward. --Wetman (talk)\n\nWhile Wikipedia and the other sister projects may not have advertising, there is money being made by people who are selling books and using material gleaned from Wikimedia projects. Some of this is overt and being used to support the Wikimedia Foundation, and some of it is for blatant commercial projects that are enriching... well some very \"well connected\" individuals who are associated to some degree or another with the WMF. I've considered in the past setting up some sort of publishing organization that might be able to help bring some of these profits back to the authors and contributors of Wikimedia projects, but such efforts have gone in vain in the past when I've brought it up on some of the various mailing lists.\n\nThere is a market for dead tree (and other) content derived from the contributions made to these websites. Profit is being made, but not by those who have written and contributed to these projects. Yes, I know that is also the nature of a copy-left license just as people who have contributed to Linux over the years aren't necessarily making money from the sales by Red Hat and other companies who make commercial distributions. More significantly, the use of Wikimedia trademarks in secondary and tertiary products that are derived from the wikis and the editing going on here is not really well defined and is not something which anybody can necessarily use. This is something that hasn't really been dealt with very well by the WMF. Yes.... I've brought this up in the past too, usually with very unsatisfying results that have gone very sour when I've tried to formally offer stuff for sale for a very modest profit (usually loss for myself or at best barely enough profit to buy a single pizza). --Robert Horning (talk)\n\nI am intending to propose a small but significant change to the wording at WP:RFA. In the \"About RfA\" section, in the \"Decision process\" subsection, the current wording of the first paragraph is\n\nAny user may nominate another user with an account. Nominations remain posted for seven days from the time the nomination is posted on this page, during which time users give their opinions, ask questions, and make comments. This discussion process is not a vote (it is sometimes referred to as a !vote, using the computer science negation symbol). At the end of that period, a bureaucrat will review the discussion to see whether there is a consensus for promotion. This is sometimes difficult to ascertain and is not a numerical measurement, but as a general descriptive rule of thumb most of those above ~80% approval pass; most of those below ~70% fail, and the area between is subject to bureaucratic discretion.\n\nI am proposing to change it to read (my changes are shown in bold, but won't be bold in the actual text):\n\nAny user may nominate another user with an account. Nominations remain posted for seven days from the time the nomination is posted on this page, during which time users give their opinions, ask questions, and make comments. This discussion process is not a vote (it is sometimes referred to as a !vote, using the computer science negation symbol). At the end of that period, a bureaucrat will review the discussion to see whether there is a consensus for promotion. This is sometimes difficult to ascertain and is not a numerical measurement, but as a general descriptive rule of thumb most of those above ~70% approval should pass; most of those below ~60% should fail, and the area between is subject to bureaucratic discretion. (Historically, the likely-pass level was ~80% and the likely-fail level was ~70%, but these were lowered in the fall of 2010.)\n\nThat is it. The only real change is the lowering of the likely-pass percentage from 80% to 70% and the likely-fail percentage from 70% to 60%. That is, the instruction to the closing bureaucrats is changed. (The addition of the word \"should\" is only to prevent the sentence from being descriptive (and therefore technically false) rather than prescriptive; it is not important. The last sentence (\"Historically...\" is also not important.\n\nI see this as the simplest way to address the problem that not enough admins are being created, partly because too many are failing, and presumably others thus despair of trying. I think this is because of some commentors applying too-high standards (\"Oppose, would make a great admin, but does not meet my criteria of 25 GAs and 25 DYKs\") or are too niggly (\"Oppose, would make a great admin, but his userpage shows awful design skills\"). We could go round-and-round with other solutions but just changing the percentage is far simpler and should do the job of reducing the weight of these kinds of comments.\n\nI'm not asking so much for discussion on the merits of this proposal here, as a large forum is needed for this (see question 3), although maybe I'm missing something. But I have three questions:\n\nHas this been discussed recently anywhere?\n\nAny suggestions on changes to the wording? In my opinion, simpler is better, and less change is better.\n\nWould it be OK to offer this as a stand-alone proposal, that is, as a stand-alone article with the \"Proposed Policy\" template at the top? I know its not usual to do this when just proposing to change the text of a page (and WP:RfA is not even labeled as a policy), but this is a pretty radical change, I guess, and an RfC won't do, I don't think. Or would there be a better way? Thanks, Herostratus (talk)\n\nThe classical argument against that is that people will just increase their personal standards when the pass percentage is lowered. I doubt that is true; I think people in general simply ask \"Can I trust this person to be a good admin?\", and will continue to do so with a lowered percentage. Ucucha\n\nIf the reason really is people opposing for stupid reasons, why not just remind everyone that RfA is not a vote and the percentages are a rough guideline for onlookers? This is already stated in WP:RFA#Decision process, but could be made somewhat clearer by removing \"and the area between is subject to bureaucratic discretion\" to remove the implication that the area not between is not subject to discretion. Anomie⚔\n\nYes, that could be done instead. It would give more discretion to bureacrats, and to a certain extent take it away from the regular editors. This could be controversial, and RfA has been considered closer to being a vote than anything else here. Note that the support/oppose/neutral numbers are given when the result it posted, and \"votes\" are not mixed in with general discussion as happens in other venues. I think this would be difficult to get adopted. Herostratus (talk)\n\nHere's an experimental AFD style RFA from 2007. Interesting concept but considering how long RFAs become, closing something like this would be one hell of a headache for the crats. --Ron Ritzman (talk)\n\nInteresting. It would be a lot of work unless the 'crat basically ignored the numbers and focused on the cogency of arguments. Which means someone could pass with minority support (or fail if there was one truly damning argument against). You could do this if you replaced the reference to \"consensus\" with something like \"best judgment of the bureaucrat\". I don't have an opinion on that, but it might be a good thing. But I don't want to propose it because I don't want to go that far, and it would probably never fly anyway. Herostratus (talk)\n\nOK, thank you all. I have gone live with this, here: Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Proposal of August 31 2010 Herostratus (talk)\n\nAs someone who recently failed an RfA but would have passed under this proposed amendment, I oppose the change. I cannot see myself working as an admin without the community's confidence. -- Blanchardb -Me•MyEars•MyMouth- timed\n\nI agree with what was said above; it is important that all admins are t"
