        "text": "In October 2012 the Danish Socialist People's Party chose Annette Vilhelmsen as its leader. With her ascension to power, women simultaneously headed all three of Denmark's governing parties for the first time. Though an exclusively female-led coalition government remains exceptional, in developed democracies the number of female prime ministers and party leaders has grown in recent years. Since 2000, women have governed in Denmark, Germany, Finland, Iceland, New Zealand, and Australia and have commanded coalition partner parties in Austria, Ireland, and Sweden. Just as there are now more female leaders, governments are also nominating more women to cabinets than ever before. Women recently held half of all ministerial posts in Finland, Iceland, Sweden, and Spain. Female ministers are also serving in high-prestige portfolios from which they were traditionally excluded, including finance and foreign affairs.\n\nAs women's presence in executive office grows, interest in both women's ascension to leadership positions (Jalalzai Reference Jalalzai2013; Murray Reference Murray2010; O'Neill and Stewart Reference O'Neill and Stewart2009; Wiliarty Reference Wiliarty2008) and nomination to cabinets (Bego Reference Bego2014; Claveria Reference Claveria2014; Davis Reference Davis1997; Escobar-Lemmon and Taylor-Robinson Reference Escobar-Lemmon and Taylor-Robinson2005; Reynolds Reference Reynolds1999) has also increased. At the same time, female leaders and ministers have largely been studied in isolation from one another, and little is known about the relationship between the two. This is a surprising oversight because party leaders play a central role in cabinet appointments and because of the conflicting expectations generated by prior research. While some scholars posit that female leaders increase women's access to top political posts (Davis Reference Davis1997; Jacob, Scherpereel, and Adams Reference Jacob, Scherpereel and Adams2014), others find no support for this claim (Krook and O'Brien Reference Krook and O'Brien2012) or show that it is wholly attributable to self-appointments (Barnes and O'Brien Reference Barnes and O'Brien2015).\n\nWe provide the first empirical analysis of female leaders’ effects on both the proportion of ministerial posts held by women and women's nomination to high-prestige portfolios. After examining the literature on women's cabinet appointments, we develop two competing sets of hypotheses linking female leaders and ministers in advanced parliamentary and semipresidential democracies. Our letting-down-the-ladder hypotheses posit that female prime ministers and coalition party leaders—particularly in left governments—are associated with women's increased appointment to cabinets and their ascension to high-prestige ministerial posts. In contrast, our shutting-the-door hypotheses suggest that the presence of female leaders—especially in nonleft governments—will result in the nomination of fewer women to (high-prestige) portfolios.\n\nWe test our competing hypotheses using data on female prime ministers, party leaders, and cabinet members in 15 countries beginning in 1980. Our multilevel models with country-level random effects demonstrate that the presence of either a female prime minister or a female-led coalition party is associated with fewer female-held portfolios, particularly as compared to exclusively male-led left governments. Female leaders are also no more likely than their male counterparts to appoint women to high-prestige posts. In our discussion of these results, we posit that this is likely a consequence of the opportunities and constraints facing male and female leaders in parliamentary and semipresidential regimes. These findings thus offer an important contribution to the growing literature on women in executive politics and lay the groundwork for future research exploring the knock-on effects of women's ascension to leadership posts. Indeed, they highlight the need for additional qualitative and quantitative work assessing the motivations and incentives of male and female leaders across different political systems."
