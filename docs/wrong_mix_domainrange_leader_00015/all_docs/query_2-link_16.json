        "text": "International Holocaust Remembrance Day is commemorated worldwide on 27 January in memory of the victims of the Holocaust.\n\nOn 27 January 1945, the advancing Red Army entered the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp complex, liberating more than 7,000 remaining prisoners, who were for the most part ill or dying.\n\nDays earlier, the SS had forced nearly 60,000 prisoners to evacuate the camp and embark on the infamous 'Death Marches,' in which many thousands lost their lives.\n\n2015 marks the 70th anniversary since this liberation and the 15th anniversary since the Stockholm Declaration was signed. To commemorate this important year, IHRA has issued a statement to reaffirm commitment to Holocaust education, research and remembrance.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 60/7 on 1 November 2005 to designate 27 January as the International Day of Commemoration in memory of the victims of the Holocaust, the day upon which every year the world would mark and remember the Holocaust and its victims. 70 years on from the liberation of Auschwitz, it is more important than ever to remind ourselves of the universal lessons of the Holocaust and to foster a shared culture of remembrance.\n\nIn 2015, the International Day of Commemoration will be marked by a number of national and international events. The following overview of commemoration events is based on information and links provided by IHRA member countries, observer countries, and permanent internationa partner organisations, as well as information compiled by the Permanent Office.\n\nMember Countries: Argentina - Austria - Belgium - Canada - Croatia - Czech Republic - Denmark - Estonia - Finland - France - Germany - Greece - Hungary -Ireland - Israel - Italy - Latvia - Lithuania - Luxembourg - Netherlands - Norway - Poland - Romania - Serbia - Slovakia - Slovenia - Spain - Sweden - Switzerland - United Kingdom - United States; Observer Countries: Albania- Bulgaria – El Salvador- the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – Moldova- Portugal - Turkey - Uruguay; Permanent International Partners: Claims Conference – CoE – FRA – ITS- OSCE/ODIHR – UNESCO - United Nations\n\nMember Countries\n\nArgentina\n\nThe Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires have produced the following video to mark the event:\n\nThe Museum is also holding a commemorative event on 27 January entitled “Voices from Auschwitz”. The programme is available here.\n\nAustria\n\nThe main Holocaust commemoration day in Austria is the 5th of May. On 5th of May 1945 the Mauthausen concentration camp was liberated. Another important day of remembrance in Austria is the 9th of November “Reichskristallnacht” when a number of events are held.\n\n27 January International Holocaust Remembrance Day Events in Vienna:\n\nThe President of the National Council, Doris Bures, opened the remembrance ceremony marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day 2015 at the Austrian Parliament with contemporary eyewitness Ari Rath. This is now the fourth occasion on which the Austrian Parliament has commemorated the liberation of the National Socialist concentration and extermination camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau in this way . During the ceremony, Ari Rath spoke to Michael Kerbler and the young audience about his experiences and the conclusions he has drawn from them. In her speech opening the ceremony marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day, National Council President Doris Bures stressed the importance of remembering the Holocaust in modern Austria.\n\n“The images captured by the liberators have been branded into our European memory”, said Bures. “The crimes, which were brought to an end with the liberation, remain unforgotten in the history of Europe”. Auschwitz was the symbol for the Nazi genocide, the murder of millions within a few years; it has become a place whose liberation seventy years ago today was selected to signify the United Nations’ International Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\n“The road towards finding a responsible way of dealing with Austria’s recent history was a long one,” Bures reflected. The remembrance ceremony was intended to be an expression of respect towards the victims and survivors, and their descendants. For a very long time, those who had been able to save themselves by emigrating had not been afforded the respect they were due. Thankfully, this has now changed, said Bures, and expressed her special delight at being able to welcome to the Parliament Ari Rath, the Vienna-born former Editor-in-Chief of the Jerusalem Post.\n\nAri Rath was born in Vienna on 6 January 1925. Being Jewish, he had had no future in Austria and in 1938 he managed to reach Palestine on a Kindertransport. In 1948, he visited Vienna for the first time since the Nazi era.\n\nFrom 1957, Ari Rath was a reporter at the Jerusalem Post, in 1975 he became an editor and in 1979 he was appointed as the newspaper’s Editor-In-Chief. Since the season 2013/2014, Ari Rath has also been involved in the contemporary eyewitness theatre production “The Last Witnesses” at Vienna’s Burgtheater.\n\nOn 27th of January 2015, a large commemorative event was held on Heldenplatz in Vienna, organized by the platform “Jetzt Zeichen Setzen!” A large number of different organizations took part in this huge event-among others the Jewish Community of Vienna. The event was attended by around 2000 people, including leading politicians. Speakers included a number of Holocaust survivors and the Mayor of Vienna.

On this day there are local memorials as well as the national memorial in Amsterdam which is broadcasted on television. The Holocaust Memorial Day focuses even more on education and the remembrance of other genocides. The activities relating to Holocaust Memorial day fall into two categories: Educational and commemorative events.\n\nThe educational activities are under the auspices of the Netherlands Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies (NIOD) and their committee Holocaust Memorial Day (HMD). Examples of activities are workshops, lectures, film screenings and excursions for students of the age of 15 to 25. In addition to the activities of HMD, students are encouraged to organize activities related to the Holocaust Memorial Day. The HMD offers promotion materials, tools and tips to support these events.\n\nBesides activities and events HMD also provides education materials on the Holocaust and other genocides. This year, we focus on the Holocaust, as well as the Armenian and Srebrenica genocides.\n\nNIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies (supported by the Dutch Auschwitz Committee, Anne Frank House, Amsterdam Resistance Museum, Hollandsche Schouwburg, Universities, Humanity in Action, Herinneringscentrum kamp Westerbork and Herinneringscentrum Vught) hold events throughout January 2015.\n\nOn 24 January NIOD also organises a training course for teachers, teacher trainers and teachers-in-training free of charge.\n\nOn and around 27 January 27 there are several remembrance activities organised by (local) authorities and the Dutch Auschwitz Committee. Annually there is the Auschwitz never again lecture and the memorial at the Auschwitz monument in Amsterdam.\n\nEach year 27 January is commemorated in Amsterdam, on the last Sunday in January (January 25, 2015). This commemoration will take place at the ‘Auschwitz Never Again-monument’ in the Wertheimpark in Amsterdam. Participants are kindly requested to assemble in the Amsterdam Town Hall (entrance Amstel River) between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m. A Silent March will depart from the Town Hall to the Wertheimpark for the main commemoration ceremony at 11:10. The ceremony itself will start at 11:30 and last for approximately 45 minutes. Following the ceremony, there will be an opportunity to lay flowers on the Monument.\n\n22-27 January 2015: The reading of the 102.000 names, Memorial Centre Camp Westerbork.\n\nThe Centre Camp Westerbork is organising the reading of the 102.000 names for the third time. It will take 112 hours, day and night. Starting in the evening of January 22 up to and including January 27 2015 the names of those who do not have their own graves, are read. The reading of their names signifies 102.000 is not merely a number, but it means 102.000 times a father, a mother, a grandmother, a brother, a niece, a friend.\n\nBackground information on the Reading of the 102.000 names\n\nThere is a map of the Netherlands on the former roll-call site of Judendurchgangslager Westerbork (Transit Camp Westerbork for Jews), with 102.000 stones with stars of David on them (and flames as symbol for the Roma and Sinti). By this we indicate that the murder of more than 100.000 Dutch Jews in the Holocaust, must not be reduced to a number, but it is a reminder for us, that the murder of one single human being was committed 102.000 times over.\n\nPersonification is the essence of educational work of Herinneringscentrum Kamp Westerbork: every star and every flame symbolises a human being who really existed. These personal stories are told in combination with the setting, because the 102.000 victims and 5.000 survivors used to live in the same cities and villages as the visitors of today.\n\nTheir names were read for the first time in 2005 on the former site of camp Westerbork. Once more, in 2015, on the occasion of Holocaust Memorial Day and commemorating the liberation of the camp\n\nAuschwitz-Birkenau, the names of all the men, women and children will be readfor whom transit camp Westerbork was their last residence in the Netherlands, until the moment they were deported to their extermination. As long as their names are mentioned, they will be remembered. And mentioning their names in camp Westerbork has a special meaning and gives an emotional edge to this reading.\n\nWhen pronouncing their names, more than a memory is kept alive. It feels, as one of the survivors expressed: ‘like a big sense of solidarity with the people who were present while reading the names. It felt like a big relief when I said the names of my parents and the name of my father’s sister. As if you were allowed to pronounce something, that was not allowed before’.\n\nNorway\n\nSince 2002 the Holocaust Center has taken the responsibility - upon request from the Government - for organising the official Norwegian Memorial Day every year on 27 January.\n\nThe Memorial event always takes place at the Memorial to the deported Norwegian Jews. The programme consists of a speech by one of the members of the Parliament, representatives of the Norwegian Jews and other groups who were killed or suffered during the Holocaust. Norwegian Jewish school children light torches in commemoration of all the children who perished, and there are usually one or two artistic performances - either a song, a musical piece or a poem. The memorial event usually ends with the Jewish cantor at the synagogue singing the Kaddish.The ceremony is concluded with a gathering at Akershus Fortress. This year's ceremony will be attended by Minister of Local Government and Modernisation Jan Tore Sanner and Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Mette-Marit.\n\nPresent at this ceremony and at the event which follows, are survivors, members of the Jewish community and the other participating groups, politicians, many ambassadors, representatives from many organizations, the general public and media - television, radio and newspapers. The coverage has been extraordinary broad and informative - before, during and after the Holocaust Day.\n\nYear by year the importance of the International Day has grown. A few years ago it was noted that most Norwegian calendars now mention this day – which really proves to which extent this Memorial Day has become an important part of the Norwegian culture - honoring the Norwegian Jews and the other groups who suffered during the Second World War\n\nFor many years there have been memorial events in several other towns in Norway as well. Likewise many schools around the country have organised speeches or other ways of informing the children about this day. Recently the new Norwegian government suggested incorporating the International Holocaust Day into all Norwegian schools' curriculum - which will mean that it then will become an even more important national event.\n\nOslo Center for Studies of Holocaust and Religious Minorities: Schoolchildren are invited to aconversation with Samuel Steinmann, the only remaining survivor of the Jews who were deported from Norway during the Holocaust.

In conjunction with the 70th WW II Anniversary, the HMD 2015 will focus mainly on memory and the cultural afterlife of the Holocaust. We have invited 200 students from the region to take part in lectures, workshops and a memorial march to the Falstad Forest, the site of execution for SS Camp Falstad.
