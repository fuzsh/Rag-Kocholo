        "text": "A Conversation With John Graham on CPP Investments Fiscal 2023 Results\n\nBarbara Shecter of the National Post reports Canada Pension Plan investing board posts 1.3% return for year: The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board posted a net return of 1.3 per cent for the fiscal year ended March 31, ending the year with net fund assets of $570 billion compared to $539 billion a year earlier. The CPP fund has a 10-year net return of 10 per cent. The $31 billion increase in net assets this year consisted of $8 billion in net income and $23 billion in net transfers from the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). Net CPP cash flows in fiscal 2023 were higher than usual due to higher employment rates , an increased limit to the year’s maximum pensionable earnings, an increase to additional CPP contribution inflows and a lump-sum inflow in the fourth quarter due to forecasting adjustments made by the CPP. Since its inception in 1999, CPPIB has contributed $386 billion in cumulative net income to the fund. “Our strong long-term return of 10 per cent over 10 years\n\nCPP Investments' CEO Discusses Fiscal Year 2024 Results\n\nIan Bickis of The Canadian Press reports CPP Investments earned 8 per cent in latest fiscal year, net assets rose to $632 billion: Canada's biggest pension fund earned an eight per cent return last year, but significantly underperformed the 19.9 per cent return of its reference portfolio. The lower return for the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in its fiscal year ending March 31 can be explained in part by higher volatility in the stock-focused benchmark portfolio compared with the diversified, long-term return focus for the pension fund, chief executive John Graham said on Wednesday. The reference portfolio, made of 85 per cent global equity and 15 per cent Canadian bonds, benefited last year from stock price surges in the seven largest U.S. tech stocks (known as the Magnificent Seven), while the pension fund has a much broader portfolio that is also invested in infrastructure, real estate, private equities and credit. \"Against a very simple, naive co\n\nPriti Singh Named CPP Investments' New CRO and Heather Tobin Replaces Her\n\nBNN Bloomberg reports Canada Pension names its second chief risk officer in 18 months: Canada Pension Plan Investment Board moved Priti Singh to chief risk officer, replacing a former BlackRock Inc. executive who had been in the role for only a year and a half. Singh is taking over immediately from Kristen Walters, who was appointed in January of last year. CPPIB, Canada’s largest pension manager, made the decision two years ago to split the risk role from the chief financial officer’s job. “After more than 30 years in risk management, Kristen Walters will be leaving CPP Investments to be closer to home,” the Toronto-based fund said in a statement Wednesday. “Walters has made a significant contribution in establishing the CRO role as a standalone function and setting the enterprise risk strategy and we thank her for her service to CPP Investments.” A spokesperson for the $632 billion (US$462 billion) fund declined to comment further. In addition to BlackRock, Walters previ\n\nAndrew Coyne Is Dead Wrong on CPP Investments' Active Management\n\nAndrew Coyne laments in his latest opinion piece that eighteen years and $46-billion later, the CPP admits it could have earned more just by buying index funds: The Canada Pension Plan Fund had a bad year last year. You’d never know it to read the latest annual report from the fund’s managers, the CPP Investment Board, which spends much of its nearly 80,000 words boasting how, thanks to the herculean efforts of its employees and the sophisticated investment stratagems of its managers, it eked out an 8-per-cent return on investment for the CPP’s beneficiaries. But of course it did: asset markets generally were up wildly last year. As an investment manager, you’d have to have gone pretty far out of your way not to have earned a sizable return. Indeed, the fund’s benchmark “reference portfolio,” a composite of global equity and bond indexes, gained 19.9 per cent on the year. What does that mean? It means that if the fund’s managers had stopped trying to pick stocks and just\n\nThis Week in Pensions & Investments: 10-11-2023\n\nThese are the top stories covering pensions & investments this week: 1) CPP Investments ended its second quarter of fiscal 2024 on September 30, 2023, with net assets of $576 billion, compared to $575 billion at the end of the previous quarter: The $1 billion increase in net assets for the quarter consisted of $488 million in net income and $700 million in net transfers from the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). The Fund, which includes the combination of the base CPP and additional CPP accounts, achieved a 10-year annualized net return of 9.6% . For the quarter, the Fund’s net return was 0.1%. In the 10-year period up to and including the second quarter of fiscal 2024, CPP Investments has contributed $311 billion in cumulative net income to the Fund. For the six-month fiscal year-to-date period, the Fund increased by $6 billion consisting of a net loss of $4 billion, plus $10 billion in net CPP contributions. For the period, the Fund’s net return was negative 0.7%. “Our\n\nReal Estate Bets Roil Canadian Pension Funds?\n\nAri Altstedter and Layan Odeh of Bloomberg report on how real estate bets wrong roil $1.24 trillion Canadian funds: Almost no major Canadian pension manager has been spared. The largest fund, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, lost five per cent on its property portfolio in its last fiscal year as the commercial real estate slump deepened. For the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, the pain amounted to a staggering 16 per cent loss on those bets, the worst fiscal year performance for those investments since the global financial crisis. With the property market upended by higher borrowing costs, Canadian pensions — known for their massive real estate businesses that were the envy of the investing world for years — are feeling the sting. And it’s leading at least four major funds to now drastically retool their operations. “What’s worked famously well for the last 35 years may not work so well for the next five to 10,” Jo Taylor, chief executive officer of the $\n\nCDPQ's Head of PE on Vintage Year Diversification and Managing Liquidity\n\nHannah Zhang of Private Equity International reports on why CDPQ's head of Private Equity thinks the worst thing for a pension is to miss vintage: When Martin Longchamps took over as head of private equity at Canadian pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec in late 2022, he faced an unprecedented challenge: the institution’s allocation to private equity had reached 20 percent for the first time in its investment history, raising concerns over potential overallocation issues. The country’s second-largest pension has been a seasoned private equity investor for almost half a century. However, it wasn’t until the last decade that the asset class began to account for a significant part of its investment portfolio: CDPQ’s private equity assets nearly doubled from 10.1 percent of its portfolio in 2013 to 20.1 percent in 2022 . The upper limit for CDPQ’s allocation to PE was raised from 14.1 percent to 21.4 percent over the same period. From the start of his tenur\n\nBCI Gains 7.5% in Fiscal 2024\n\nThe Canadian Press reports B.C. Investment Management earned 7.5% annual combined pension plan return: VICTORIA – British Columbia Investment Management Corp. says it earned an annual combined pension plan return of 7.5 per cent for its latest year. However, the result fell short of BCI’s benchmark which was boosted by the strength of the largest tech stocks and posted an annual return of 11.6 per cent. BCI chief executive Gordon Fyfe said the fund delivered “solid absolute results even through challenged markets this year.” The fund said all of its asset classes generated positive returns except its real estate equity investments which faced sustained market headwinds. The combined pension plan return represents the performance of BCI’s six largest pension clients by assets under management. BCI had $250.4 billion in gross assets under management as of March 31. Earlier today, BCI released its annual results, earning a 7.5% return and surpassing $250 billion in gross assets\n\nAIMCo's CIO Talks Total Portfolio Approach, Private Credit and Risk\n\nSarah Rundell of Top1000funds reports AIMCo talks total portfolio approach, private credit, and risk: Alberta Investment Management Corporation, AIMCo, the $160 billion asset manager for pensions, endowments and insurance groups in Canada’s western province, is developing a total portfolio approach in private assets. Unlike other Maple Eight investors, AIMCo’s client funds decide their own asset allocation and most of them have reached their target in private markets. Rather than continuing to plough in capital, the investment team are now thinking more about comparing opportunities across assets and anticipating future trends. “The investment horizon for these assets is long and the ability to rebalance in the future is hampered,” warns Marlene Puffer, who joined AIMCo as CIO in 2023 from Canada’s railway pension fund CN Investment Division. This approach ensures AIMCo taps sufficient risk but also protects against embedding too much connected risk. Puffer says cross-fu"
