        "text": "ATHENS, Greece — Socialist opposition leader George Papandreou, who is widely expected to win Greece’s national election next weekend, says fighting endemic corruption and creating a stimulus package are essential if Greece is to emerge from a deep financial crisis.\n\nPrime Minister Costas Karamanlis called an early election for Oct. 4, just halfway through his second term, ignoring protests from senior cabinet members. Karamanlis said he needed a new mandate to tackle the financial crisis.\n\nGreece, which has seen a sharp rise in unemployment and rapidly slowing growth, is teetering on the brink of recession. Public debt is expected to exceed 100 percent of GDP in 2009.\n\nKaramanlis, 52, whose conservatives have a slim one-seat majority in the 300-member Parliament, had been scheduled to face an election in 2011.\n\nBut a series of high-profile financial scandals have battered his governing conservatives, who have been in power since 2004. They now head into the vote trailing Papandreou’s PASOK party by about 6 percentage points.\n\n“The question is whether you are part of the problem of corruption or whether you are part of the solution. And the problem with this government is that it became part of the problem,” Papandreou told The Associated Press in an interview Saturday. “The high-profile corruption created a very deep sense of mistrust and frustration.”\n\nThe scandals have dominated headlines for months. They ranged from a state land-swap deal in which high-value state property was traded for cheaper land owned by a monastery at a cost to the state of about euro100 million, to the revelation that a minister had built an illegal villa and employed migrant workers without paying their social security taxes.\n\nBut it is also the widespread and decades-old public sector corruption of paying for favors in everything from public hospitals to building planning offices that has angered many, and which Papandreou says he is determined to wipe out.\n\n“It is so pervasive. And yet, even though it was so pervasive, this government did nothing,” said Papandreou, the 57-year-old son and grandson of two of Greece’s most influential postwar prime ministers.\n\n“So the question is, do we have the strength and the will to make the strong decisions, the difficult decisions to break away from this tradition? And I think that we’ve been able to convince a large proportion of Greek people that we do have the will,” he said.\n\nAccusations of corruption had also been leveled at PASOK, the party founded by Papandreou’s father, Andreas, which stormed to power in 1981 and remained there for much of the next 20 years. Polls in recent years have shown Greeks disillusioned by both major parties.\n\n“Even though there were corruption issues in the previous government, it was not a corrupt government – it’s a very different thing,” Papandreou said, noting that he had suggested Parliament investigate accusations against his party.\n\nIn May, the conservatives blocked a PASOK motion for a parliamentary probe into whether politicians were involved in two bribery scandals over a telecommunications deal and a security system for the Olympic Games.\n\n“It’s a question of fighting with old concepts and practices, and cronyism and clientelism and all this which is deeply rooted in Greek politics,” he said.\n\nGreece’s struggling economy has also been a cornerstone of electoral campaigning, and Papandreou has pledged a stimulus package of up to euro3 billion ($4.4 billion).\n\n“If we don’t have a vibrant economy, we will never deal with the debt. We need to first jump-start the economy for a short period, to give us the breathing-space to make the changes and then move on to a different type of economy within the next few years.”\n\nHe said measures would include helping small- and medium-sized companies, strengthening employment and temporarily freezing small businesses’ debts.\n\nKaramanlis has dismissed the PASOK program as “facile promises,” advocating a public sector wage freeze, structural reforms and a stricter line on tax evasion instead.\n\n“The idea that you’re going to solve the euro260 billion debt problem by taxing or freezing pensions, which may bring about euro500 million for this year, is ludicrous,” Papandreou said. “That’s why we absolutely need a stimulus package.”\n\nA PASOK win Sunday would mark a comeback for a party that made its worst electoral showing in 30 years in the 2007 vote. Papandreou survived a leadership challenge after that vote and says he is confident of winning enough votes to form a majority government.\n\n“We’re doing well,” he said. “We’re fighting for a strong majority, but we still have another week to go.”"
