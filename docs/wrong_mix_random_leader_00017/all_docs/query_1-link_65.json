        "text": "George Papandreou Becomes Prime Minister\n\nFor those of you in the USA who missed it Greece has a new government. Maybe you read about it? With the American football season in full gear it did not really get the coverage one might expect when a European country elects an American as its prime minister. George Papandreou, son of former PM Andreas Papandreou and Margaret Papandreou, formerly (Margaret Chant) was elected PM on October 4th in a landslide (by Greek standards) over Constantine Karamanlis who had called special elections in the hope that the opposition would not have enough of a majority to form a government or that he might somehow win. So after 6 years of conservative rule the socialists are taking over again and while the American press writes about how Europe is turning to the right Greece has just elected their Barak Obama. It is not a moment too soon either. Or maybe it is too late. Only time will tell.\n\nBefore I tell you a little about our new PM a few words about the government that is leaving power which I covered in this blog on March 24 2009: Greek Politicks for Dummies, an article I was quite proud of but is now obsolete except for historical purposes. Many people in Greece feel the same way about the departing Karamanlis and his crew, the way liberal Democrats feel about George Bush, which is: Good ridance and hopefully one day we will see you in court or prison. For a standing government to be so soundly defeated they must have done something wrong and with ND the list is long and includes major scandals (like the Vatopedi Monastery land exchange which cost the country millions), incompetance (like the inability to bring order during the December riots and the forest fires of 2007 and 2009), lack of interest in Greek culture (the archaeological site of Akrotiri, Santorini is still closed 4 years after the roof collapsed) and for me the biggest crime of all, the gutting of the Greek baseball project which the previous PASOK government had spend a lot of time and money to create.\n\nI have to accept that I still do have friends that did vote for ND again this past election but most of them are the kind of people who see politics the way sports fans do when they continue to support their team after it has traded or sold their best players, are losing all their games, have a lousy manager and are now shaking down the hot-dog venders for spending money.\n\nFor me the election of Papandreou gives me hope that things will change for the better in Greece and some of the problems I have been complaining about in this blog will finally be dealt with. It also is very useful when I get the occasional complaint from travelers who are worried about 'anti-American sentiment' in Greece. Instead of going through my usual explanation about every Greek having a relative in America and their passion for politics does not infringe upon their filoxenia (hospitality and friendship for foreigners) all I have to say is that they just elected an American PM so how anti-American can they be?\n\nMore importantly it gives me hope for my own personal ambitions because just like George Papandreou, I too am of a Greek academic father and an independent minded American mother. I think it is a good balance. I mean it works for me to have my mother's rationality, sensitivity, and humanity to balance out my father's ummmmmmmm..... Greekness? OK. I won't go into this here. But for those of you who have sent comments that Greece should make me minister of tourism or head of EOT (The ineffective Greek National Tourist Organization) this could be my chance and I have doubled my efforts with the Rosetta Stone and stand ready to serve my country."
