We apply the exponentiation of the heavy-quark form factor to derive new improved three-loop expansions in the high-energy limit. We also discuss the implications for predictions of massive n-parton amplitudes based on massless results in the limit, where the quark mass is small compared to all kinematical invariants.\n\nNucleon form factors in generalized parton distributions at high momentum transfers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSattary Nikkhoo, Negin; Shojaei, Mohammad Reza\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThis paper aims at calculating the elastic form factors for a nucleon by considering the extended Regge and modified Gaussian ansatzes based on the generalized parton distributions. To reach this goal, we have considered three different parton distribution functions (PDFs) and have compared the obtained results among them for high momentum transfer ranges. Minimum free parameters have been applied in our parametrization. After achieving the form factors, we calculate the electric radius and the transversely unpolarized and polarized densities for the nucleon. Furthermore, we obtain the impact-parameter-dependent PDFs. Finally, we compare our obtained data with the results of previous studies.\n\nSoil Forming Factors\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nIt!

This simple framework produces results that are practically indistinguishable from the best otherwise available, an outcome which highlights that the key to describing many features of baryons and unifying them with the properties of mesons is a veracious expression of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the hadron bound-state problem. The following specific results are of particular interest.moreÂ Â» The Î elastic form factors are very sensitive to m Î. Hence, given that the parameters which define extant simulations of lattice-regularised QCD produce Î-resonance masses that are very large, the form factors obtained therewith are a poor guide to properties of the Î(1232). Considering the Î-baryonâs quadrupole moment, whilst all computations produce a negative value, the conflict between theoretical predictions entails that it is currently impossible to reach a sound conclusion on the nature of the Î-baryonâs deformation in the infinite momentum frame. Furthermore, results for analogous properties of the Î© baryon are less contentious. In connection with the N â Î transition, the Ash-convention magnetic transition form factor falls faster than the neutronâs magnetic form factor and nonzero values for the associated quadrupole ratios reveal the impact of quark orbital angular momentum within the nucleon and Î; and, furthermore, these quadrupole ratios do slowly approach their anticipated asymptotic limits.Â«Â less\n\nForm factors and generalized parton distributions in basis light-front quantization\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAdhikari, Lekha; Li, Yang; Zhao, Xingbo; Maris, Pieter; Vary, James P.; El-Hady, Alaa Abd\n\n2016-05-01\n\nWe calculate the elastic form factors and the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for four low-lying bound states of a demonstration fermion-antifermion system, strong-coupling positronium (e e Â¯ ), using basis light-front quantization (BLFQ). By using this approach, we also calculate the impact-parameter-dependent GPDs q (x ,bââ¥) to visualize the fermion density in the transverse plane (bââ¥). We compare selected results with corresponding quantities in the nonrelativistic limit to reveal relativistic effects. Our results establish the foundation within BLFQ for investigating the form factors and the GPDs for hadronic systems.\n\nTRASYS form factor matrix normalization\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTsuyuki, Glenn T.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nA method has been developed for adjusting a TRASYS enclosure form factor matrix to unity. This approach is not limited to closed geometries, and in fact, it is primarily intended for use with open geometries. The purpose of this approach is to prevent optimistic form factors to space. In this method, nodal form factor sums are calculated within 0.05 of unity using TRASYS, although deviations as large as 0.10 may be acceptable, and then, a process is employed to distribute the difference amongst the nodes. A specific example has been analyzed with this method, and a comparison was performed with a standard approach for calculating radiation conductors. In this comparison, hot and cold case temperatures were determined. Exterior nodes exhibited temperature differences as large as 7 C and 3 C for the hot and cold cases, respectively when compared with the standard approach, while interior nodes demonstrated temperature differences from 0 C to 5 C. These results indicate that temperature predictions can be artificially biased if the form factor computation error is lumped into the individual form factors to space.\n\nHQET form factors for Bs â Klv decays beyond leading order\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBanerjee, Debasish; Koren, Mateusz; Simma, Hubert; Sommer, Rainer\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe compute semi-leptonic Bs decay form factors using Heavy Quark Effective Theory on the lattice. To obtain good control of the 1 /mb expansion, one has to take into account not only the leading static order but also the terms arising at O (1/mb): kinetic, spin and current insertions. We show results for these terms calculated through the ratio method, using our prior results for the static order. After combining them with non-perturbative HQET parameters they can be continuum-extrapolated to give the QCD form factor correct up to O (1/mb2) corrections and without O (Î±s(mb)n) corrections.\n\nDetermining Experimental Parameters for Thermal-Mechanical Forming Simulation considering Martensite Formation in Austenitic Stainless Steel\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchmid, Philipp; Liewald, Mathias\n\n2011-08-01\n\nThe forming behavior of metastable austenitic stainless steel is mainly dominated by the temperature-dependent TRIP effect (transformation induced plasticity). Of course, the high dependency of material properties on the temperature level during forming means the temperature must be considered during the FE analysis. The strain-induced formation of Î±'-martensite from austenite can be represented by using finite element programs utilizing suitable models such as the Haensel-model. This paper discusses the determination of parameters for a completely thermal-mechanical forming simulation in LS-DYNA based on the material model of Haensel. The measurement of the martensite evolution in non-isothermal tensile tests was performed with metastable austenitic stainless steel EN 1.4301 at different rolling directions between 0Â° and 90 Â°. This allows an estimation of the influence of the rolling direction to the martensite formation. Of specific importance is the accuracy of the martensite content measured by magnetic induction methods (Feritscope). The observation of different factors, such as stress dependence of the magnetisation, blank thickness and numerous calibration curves discloses a substantial important influence on the parameter determination for the material models. The parameters obtained for use of Haensel model and temperature-dependent friction coefficients are used to simulate forming process of a real component and to validate its implementation in the commercial code LS-DYNA.\n\nReal-Gas Correction Factors for Hypersonic Flow Parameters in Helium\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nErickson, Wayne D.\n\n1960-01-01\n\nThe real-gas hypersonic flow parameters for helium have been calculated for stagnation temperatures from 0 F to 600 F and stagnation pressures up to 6,000 pounds per square inch absolute. The results of these calculations are presented in the form of simple correction factors which must be applied to the tabulated ideal-gas parameters. It has been shown that the deviations from the ideal-gas law which exist at high pressures may cause a corresponding significant error in the hypersonic flow parameters when calculated as an ideal gas. For example the ratio of the free-stream static to stagnation pressure as calculated from the thermodynamic properties of helium for a stagnation temperature of 80 F and pressure of 4,000 pounds per square inch absolute was found to be approximately 13 percent greater than that determined from the ideal-gas tabulation with a specific heat ratio of 5/3.\n\nEffects of Processing Parameters on the Forming Quality of C-Shaped Thermosetting Composite Laminates in Hot Diaphragm Forming Process\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBian, X. X.; Gu, Y. Z.; Sun, J.; Li, M.; Liu, W. P.; Zhang, Z. G.\n\n2013-10-01\n\nIn this study, the effects of processing temperature and vacuum applying rate on the forming quality of C-shaped carbon fiber reinforced epoxy resin matrix composite laminates during hot diaphragm forming process were investigated. C-shaped prepreg preforms were produced using a home-made hot diaphragm forming equipment. The thickness variations of the preforms and the manufacturing defects after diaphragm forming process, including fiber wrinkling and voids, were evaluated to understand the forming mechanism. Furthermore, both interlaminar slipping friction and compaction behavior of the prepreg stacks were experimentally analyzed for showing the importance of the processing parameters. In addition, autoclave processing was used to cure the C-shaped preforms to investigate the changes of the defects before and after cure process. The results show that the C-shaped prepreg preforms with good forming quality can be achieved through increasing processing temperature and reducing vacuum applying rate, which obviously promote prepreg interlaminar slipping process. The process temperature and forming rate in hot diaphragm forming process strongly influence prepreg interply frictional force, and the maximum interlaminar frictional force can be taken as a key parameter for processing parameter optimization. Autoclave process is effective in eliminating voids in the preforms and can alleviate fiber wrinkles to a certain extent.\n\nK Ï vector form factor, dispersive constraints and Ïâ Î½ Ï K Ï decays\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBoito, Diogo R.; Escribano, Rafel; Jamin, Matthias\n\n2009-02-01\n\nRecent experimental data for the differential decay distribution of the decay Ï -â Î½ Ï K S Ï - by the Belle collaboration are described by a theoretical model which is composed of the contributing vector and scalar form factors F {+/ K Ï }( s) and F {0/ K Ï }( s). Both form factors are constructed such that they fulfil constraints posed by analyticity and unitarity. A good description of the experimental measurement is achieved by incorporating two vector resonances and working with a three-times-subtracted dispersion relation in order to suppress higher-energy contributions. The resonance parameters of the charged K *(892) meson, defined as the pole of F {+/ K Ï }( s) in the complex s-plane, can be extracted, with the result M_{K^{*}}=892.0Â± 0.9 MeV and \\\\varGamma_{K^{*}}=46.2Â± 0.4 MeV . Finally, employing a three-times-subtracted dispersion relation allows one to determine the slope and curvature parameters Î»'+=(24.7Â±0.8)Ã10-3 and Î»â³+=(12.0Â±0.2)Ã10-4 of the vector form factor F {+/ K Ï }( s) directly from the data.\n\nProcess Parameters Optimization in Single Point Incremental Forming\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGulati, Vishal; Aryal, Ashmin; Katyal, Puneet; Goswami, Amitesh\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThis work aims to optimize the formability and surface roughness of parts formed by the single-point incremental forming process for an Aluminium-6063 alloy. The tests are based on Taguchi's L18 orthogonal array selected on the basis of DOF. The tests have been carried out on vertical machining center (DMC70V); using CAD/CAM software (SolidWorks V5/MasterCAM). Two levels of tool radius, three levels of sheet thickness, step size, tool rotational speed, feed rate and lubrication have been considered as the input process parameters. Wall angle and surface roughness have been considered process responses. The influential process parameters for the formability and surface roughness have been identified with the help of statistical tool (response table, main effect plot and ANOVA). The parameter that has the utmost influence on formability and surface roughness is lubrication. In the case of formability, lubrication followed by the tool rotational speed, feed rate, sheet thickness, step size and tool radius have the influence in descending order. Whereas in surface roughness, lubrication followed by feed rate, step size, tool radius, sheet thickness and tool rotational speed have the influence in descending order. The predicted optimal values for the wall angle and surface roughness are found to be 88.29Â° and 1.03225 Âµm. The confirmation experiments were conducted thrice and the value of wall angle and surface roughness were found to be 85.76Â° and 1.15 Âµm respectively.\n\nThe pion form factor from first principles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nvan der Heide, J.\n\n2004-08-01\n\nWe calculate the electromagnetic form factor of the pion in quenched lattice QCD. The non-perturbatively improved Sheikoleslami-Wohlert lattice action is used together with the O(a) improved current. We calculate form factor for pion masses down to mÏ = 380 MeV. We compare the mean square radius for the pion extracted from our form factors to the value obtained from the `Bethe Salpeter amplitude'. Using (quenched) chiral perturbation theory, we extrapolate our results towards the physical pion mass.\n\nProton Form Factor Puzzle and the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) Two-Photon Exchange Experiment\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRimal, Dipak\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe electromagnetic form factors are the most fundamental observables that encode information about the internal structure of the nucleon. This dissertation explored dependence of R on kinematic variables such as squared four-momentum transfer (Q 2) and the virtual photon polarization parameter (Îµ).\n\nResearch on design method of the full form ship with minimum thrust deduction factor\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Bao-ji; Miao, Ai-qin; Zhang, Zhu-xin\n\n2015-04-01\n\nIn the preliminary design stage of the full form ships, in order to obtain a hull form with low resistance and maximum propulsion efficiency, an optimization design program for a full form ship with the minimum thrust deduction factor has been developed, which combined the potential flow theory and boundary layer theory with the optimization technique. In the optimization process, the Sequential Unconstrained Minimization Technique (SUMT) interior point method of Nonlinear Programming (NLP) was proposed with the minimum thrust deduction factor as the objective function. An appropriate displacement is a basic constraint condition, and the boundary layer separation is an additional one. The parameters of the hull form modification function are used as design variables. At last, the numerical optimization example for lines of after-body of 50000 DWT product oil tanker was provided, which indicated that the propulsion efficiency was improved distinctly by this optimal design method.\n\nn-Iterative Exponential Forgetting Factor for EEG Signals Parameter Estimation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPalma Orozco, Rosaura\n\n2018-01-01\n\nElectroencephalograms (EEG) signals are of interest because of their relationship with physiological activities, allowing a description of motion, speaking, or thinking. Important research has been developed to take advantage of EEG using classification or predictor algorithms based on parameters that help to describe the signal behavior. Thus, great importance should be taken to feature extraction which is complicated for the Parameter Estimation (PE)âSystem Identification (SI) process. When based on an average approximation, nonstationary characteristics are presented. For PE the comparison of three forms of iterative-recursive uses of the Exponential Forgetting Factor (EFF) combined with a linear function to identify a synthetic stochastic signal is presented. The one with best results seen through the functional error is applied to approximate an EEG signal for a simple classification example, showing the effectiveness of our proposal.

We derive the dispersive formalism necessary for the extension of these results to the doubly-virtual case, as required for the pion-pole contribution to hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.\n\nDispersive analysis of the scalar form factor of the nucleon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoferichter, M.; Ditsche, C.; Kubis, B.; MeiÃner, U.-G.\n\n2012-06-01\n\nBased on the recently proposed Roy-Steiner equations for pion-nucleon ( ÏN) scattering [1], we derive a system of coupled integral equations for the Ï Ï to overline N N and overline K K to overline N N S-waves. These equations take the form of a two-channel Muskhelishvili-OmnÃ¨s problem, whose solution in the presence of a finite matching point is discussed. We use these results to update the dispersive analysis of the scalar form factor of the nucleon fully including overline K K intermediate states. In particular, we determine the correction {Î_{Ï }} = Ï ( {2M_{Ï }^2} ) - {Ï_{{Ï N}}} , which is needed for the extraction of the pion-nucleon Ï term from ÏN scattering, as a function of pion-nucleon subthreshold parameters and the ÏN coupling constant.\n\nNucleon and Elastic and Transition Form Factors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSegovia, Jorge; CloÃ«t, Ian C.; Roberts, Craig D.; Schmidt, Sebastian M.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nWe present a unified study of nucleon and elastic and transition form factors, and compare predictions made using a framework built upon a Faddeev equation kernel and interaction vertices that possess QCD-like momentum dependence with results obtained using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector vector contact-interaction. The comparison emphasises that experiments are sensitive to the momentum dependence of the running couplings and masses in the strong interaction sector of the Standard Model and highlights that the key to describing hadron properties is a veracious expression of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the bound-state problem. Amongst the results we describe, the following are of particular interest: possesses a zero at Q 2 = 9.5 GeV2; any change in the interaction which shifts a zero in the proton ratio to larger Q 2 relocates a zero in to smaller Q 2; there is likely a value of momentum transfer above which ; and the presence of strong diquark correlations within the nucleon is sufficient to understand empirical extractions of the flavour-separated form factors. Regarding the -baryon, we find that, inter alia: the electric monopole form factor exhibits a zero; the electric quadrupole form factor is negative, large in magnitude, and sensitive to the nature and strength of correlations in the Faddeev amplitude; and the magnetic octupole form factor is negative so long as rest-frame P- and D-wave correlations are included. In connection with the transition, the momentum-dependence of the magnetic transition form factor, , matches that of once the momentum transfer is high enough to pierce the meson-cloud; and the electric quadrupole ratio is a keen measure of diquark and orbital angular momentum correlations, the zero in which is obscured by meson-cloud effects on the domain currently accessible to experiment. Importantly, within each framework, identical propagators and vertices are sufficient to describe all properties discussed herein. Our\n\nUniversal analytical scattering form factor for shell-, core-shell, or homogeneous particles with continuously variable density profile shape.\n\nPubMed\n\nFoster, Tobias\n\n2011-09-01\n\nA novel analytical and continuous density distribution function with a widely variable shape is reported and used to derive an analytical scattering form factor that allows us to universally describe the scattering from particles with the radial density profile of homogeneous spheres, shells, or core-shell particles. Composed by the sum of two Fermi-Dirac distribution functions, the shape of the density profile can be altered continuously from step-like via Gaussian-like or parabolic to asymptotically hyperbolic by varying a single \"shape parameter\", d. Using this density profile, the scattering form factor can be calculated numerically. An analytical form factor can be derived using an approximate expression for the original Fermi-Dirac distribution function. This approximation is accurate for sufficiently small rescaled shape parameters, d/R (R being the particle radius), up to values of d/R â 0.1, and thus captures step-like, Gaussian-like, and parabolic as well as asymptotically hyperbolic profile shapes. It is expected that this form factor is particularly useful in a model-dependent analysis of small-angle scattering data since the applied continuous and analytical function for the particle density profile can be compared directly with the density profile extracted from the data by model-free approaches like the generalized inverse Fourier transform method.

J.; Treiman, S. B.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nThe breakdown of Bjorken scaling in asymptotically free gauge theories of the strong interactions is explored for its implications on the large q{sup 2} behavior of nucleon form factors. Duality arguments of Bloom and Gilman suggest a connection between the form factors and the threshold properties of the deep inelastic structure functions. The latter are addressed directly in an analysis of asymptotically free theories; and through the duality connection we are then led to statements about the form factors. For very large q{sup 2} the form factors are predicted to fall faster than any inverse power of q{sup 2}. For the more modest range of q{sup 2} reached in existing experiments the agreement with data is fairly good, though this may well be fortuitous. Extrapolations beyond this range are presented.\n\nBasic Parameters of Metal Behavior under High Rate Forming\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1962-03-01\n\n1ii PHOTOGRAPH THIS SHEET II LEVELrâ¢ At-kÃ½ W â¢I)-_) -N INVENTORY z DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION may. 6â¢t S]/ tp i - 0~o- o’â¢5,,? 3 ’ \\\\NAL- TR-/I. -a I .. ~1...TR 111.2/20- 3 BASIC PARAMETERS OF METAL BEHAVIOUR \"> UNDER HIGH RATE FORMING L L j Fourth Interim Report to ell- L’,I I U.

Extraction of GMp from e-p cross section data is complicated by two-photon exchange (TPE) effects, where available calculations still have large theoretical uncertainties. Studies of TPE contributions to e-p scattering have observed no nonlinear effects in Rosenbluth separations. Recent theoretical investigations show that the TPE correction goes to 0 when É approaches 1, where É is the virtual photon polarization parameter. In this talk, existing e-p elastic cross section data are reanalyzed by extrapolating the reduced cross section for É approaching 1. Existing polarization transfer data, which is supposed to be relatively immune to TPE effects, are used to produce a ratio of electric and magnetic form factors. The extrapolated reduced cross section and polarization transfer ratio are then used to calculate GEp and GMp at different Q2 values.\n\nVariance Reduction Factor of Nuclear Data for Integral Neutronics Parameters\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChiba, G., E-mail: go_chiba@eng.hokudai.ac.jp; Tsuji, M.; Narabayashi, T.\n\nWe propose a new quantity, a variance reduction factor, to identify nuclear data for which further improvements are required to reduce uncertainties of target integral neutronics parameters.

The parameter is defined as Îµâ=â(ÎT{sub m}â+âÎT{sub x}â+âT{sub x})/T{sub m}{sup mix} without directly adding T{sub g} while considering the whole temperature range for glass formation up to T{sub m}{sup mix}, which reflects the relative position of crystallization curve in continuous cooling transformation diagram. The relationship between the ÎµmoreÂ Â» parameter and critical cooling rate (R{sub c}) or maximum section thickness for glass formation (Z{sub max}) clearly confirms that the Îµ parameter exhibits a better correlation with GFA than other commonly used GFA parameters, such as ÎT{sub x} (=T{sub x} â T{sub g}), K (=[T{sub x} â T{sub g}]/[T{sub l} â T{sub x}]), ÎT*(=(T{sub m}{sup mix} â T{sub l})/T{sub m}{sup mix}), T{sub rg} (=T{sub g}/T{sub l}), and Î³ (=[T{sub x}]/[T{sub l}â+âT{sub g}]). The relationship between the Îµ parameter and R{sub c} or Z{sub max} is also formulated and evaluated in the study. The results suggest that the Îµ parameter can effectively predict R{sub c} and Z{sub max} for various glass-forming alloys, which would permit more widespread uses of these paradigm-shifting materials in a variety of industries.Â«Â less\n\nStrange nucleon electromagnetic form factors from lattice QCD\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlexandrou, C.; Constantinou, M.; Hadjiyiannakou, K.; Jansen, K.; Kallidonis, C.; Koutsou, G.; AvilÃ©s-Casco, A. Vaquero\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe evaluate the strange nucleon electromagnetic form factors using an ensemble of gauge configurations generated with two degenerate maximally twisted mass clover-improved fermions with mass tuned to approximately reproduce the physical pion mass. In addition, we present results for the disconnected light quark contributions to the nucleon electromagnetic form factors. Improved stochastic methods are employed leading to high-precision results. The momentum dependence of the disconnected contributions is fitted using the model-independent z-expansion. We extract the magnetic moment and the electric and magnetic radii of the proton and neutron by including both connected and disconnected contributions. We find that the disconnected light quark contributions to both electric and magnetic form factors are nonzero and at the few percent level as compared to the connected. The strange form factors are also at the percent level but more noisy yielding statistical errors that are typically within one standard deviation from a zero value.\n\nThe ionisation parameter of star-forming galaxies evolves with the specific star formation rate\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKaasinen, Melanie; Kewley, Lisa; Bian, Fuyan; Groves, Brent; Kashino, Daichi; Silverman, John; Kartaltepe, Jeyhan\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe investigate the evolution of the ionisation parameter of star-forming galaxies using a high-redshift (z Ë 1.5) sample from the FMOS-COSMOS survey and matched low-redshift samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. By constructing samples of low-redshift galaxies for which the stellar mass (M*), star formation rate (SFR) and specific star formation rate (sSFR) are matched to the high-redshift sample we remove the effects of an evolution in these properties. We also account for the effect of metallicity by jointly constraining the metallicity and ionisation parameter of each sample. We find an evolution in the ionisation parameter for main-sequence, star-forming galaxies and show that this evolution is driven by the evolution of sSFR. By analysing the matched samples as well as a larger sample of z < 0.3, star-forming galaxies we show that high ionisation parameters are directly linked to high sSFRs and are not simply the byproduct of an evolution in metallicity.

A.; Hill, K. D.; Pak, C. Y.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nStudy Objective: To compare urinary biochemical risk factors among stone-forming patients in the Southeast (SE) or \"stone belt\" versus four other regions of the United States. Design: Prospective biochemical survey for regional comparisons. Setting: Referral-based nephrolithiasis clinics, urologists, nephrologists, and family practitioners. Patients: Consecutive sample of 3473 stone-forming patients who submitted 24-hour urine collections for biochemical analyses of stone-forming risk factors. Interventions: None. Subjects taking medication known to interfere with stone-forming risk factors were deleted from the final data compilation. Measurements and Main Results: Overall, the mean values for each urinary parameter spanned a narrow range without significant difference between the five regions. Among \"metabolic\" factors, 40% in the SE had hypercalciuria (> 6.25 mmol/d), compared to 35%-43% in other regions, and hyperuricosuria (> 4.2 mmol/d) was found in 16% in the SE versus 17%-19% elsewhere. Among \"environmental\" factors, low urine volume ( < 2 L/d) was found in 77% patients in the SE compared to 69%-78% elsewhere, and high sodium was encountered in 27% in the SE versus 24%-29% elsewhere. No differences were noted in occurrence of other abnormal risk factors: hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, low pH, high sulfate, high phosphorus, or low magnesium. Conclusions: Despite expected regional differences in nutritional and environmental influences, the results of this study showed a striking similarity in urinary biochemical risk factor profiles of stone-formers in all five regions of the United States.\n\nThe ionization parameter of star-forming galaxies evolves with the specific star formation rate\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKaasinen, Melanie; Kewley, Lisa; Bian, Fuyan; Groves, Brent; Kashino, Daichi; Silverman, John; Kartaltepe, Jeyhan\n\n2018-07-01\n\nWe investigate the evolution of the ionization parameter of star-forming galaxies using a high-redshift (zË 1.5) sample from the FMOS-COSMOS (Fibre Multi-Object Spectrograph-COSMic evOlution Survey) and matched low-redshift samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

II. Electromagnetic form factors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlarcÃ³n, J. M.; Weiss, C.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe study the nucleon electromagnetic form factors (EM FFs) using a recently developed method combining chiral effective field theory (Ï EFT ) and dispersion analysis. The spectral functions on the two-pion cut at t >4 MÏ2 are constructed using the elastic unitarity relation and an N /D representation. Ï EFT is used to calculate the real functions JÂ±1(t ) =fÂ±1(t ) /FÏ(t ) (ratios of the complex Ï Ï âN N Â¯ partial-wave amplitudes and the timelike pion FF), which are free of Ï Ï rescattering. Rescattering effects are included through the empirical timelike pion FF | FÏ(t) | 2 . The method allows us to compute the isovector EM spectral functions up to t Ë1 GeV2 with controlled accuracy (leading order, next-to-leading order, and partial next-to-next-to-leading order). With the spectral functions we calculate the isovector nucleon EM FFs and their derivatives at t =0 (EM radii, moments) using subtracted dispersion relations. We predict the values of higher FF derivatives, which are not affected by higher-order chiral corrections and are obtained almost parameter-free in our approach, and explain their collective behavior. We estimate the individual proton and neutron FFs by adding an empirical parametrization of the isoscalar sector. Excellent agreement with the present low-Q2 FF data is achieved up to Ë0.5 GeV2 for GE, and up to Ë0.2 GeV2 for GM. Our results can be used to guide the analysis of low-Q2 elastic scattering data and the extraction of the proton charge radius.\n\nElectric Form Factor of the Neutron\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFeuerbach, Robert\n\n2007-10-01\n\nRecent polarization-based precision measurements of the nucleons' elastic electric form factors have led to surprising results. The measurement of the ratio of the proton's electromagnetic form factors, Î¼pGE^p/GM^p, was found to drop nearly linearly with Q^2 out to at least 5 GeV^2, inconsistent with the older Rosenbluth-type experiments. A recent measurement of GE^n, the neutron's electric form-factor saw GE^n does not fall off as quickly as commonly expected up to Q^2 1.5 GeV^2. Extending this study, a precision measurement of GE^n up to Q^2=3.5 GeV^2 was completed in Hall A at Jefferson Lab. The ratio GE^n/GM^n was measured through the beam-target asymmetry A of electrons quasi-elastically scattered off polarized neutrons in the reaction ^3He(e,e' n). The experiment took full advantage of the electron beam, recent target developments, as well as two detectors new to Jefferson Lab. The measurement used the accelerator's 100% duty-cycle high-polarization (typically 84%) electron beam and a new, hybrid optically-pumped polarized ^3He target which achieved in-beam polarizations in excess of 50%. A medium acceptance (80msr) open-geometry magnetic spectrometer (BigBite) detected the scattered electron, while a geometrically matched neutron detector observed the struck neutron. Preliminary results from this measurement will be discussed and compared to modern calculations of GE^n.\n\nFuture Perspectives on Baryon Form Factor Measurements with BES III\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchÃ¶nning, Karin; Li, Cui\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe electromagnetic structure of hadrons, parameterised in terms of electromagnetic form factors, EMFF's, provide a key to the strong interaction. Nucleon EMFF's have been studied rigorously for more than 60 years but the new techniques and larger data samples available at modern facilities have given rise to a renewed interest for the field. Recently, the access to hyperon structure by hyperon time-like EMFF provides an additional dimension. The BEijing Spectrometer (BES III) at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC-II) in China is the only running experiment where time-like baryon EMFF's can be studied in the e+e- â BBÌ reaction. The BES III detector is an excellent tool for baryon form factor measurements thanks to its near 4Ï coverage, precise tracking, PID and calorimetry. All hyperons in the SU(3) spin 1/2 octet and spin 3/2 decuplet are energetically accessible within the BEPC-II energy range. Recent data on proton and Î hyperon form factors will be presented. Furthermore, a world-leading data sample was collected in 2014-2015 for precision measurements of baryon form factors. In particular, the data will enable a measurement of the relative phase between the electric and the magnetic form factors for Î and Îc+ and hyperons. The modulus of the phase can be extracted from the hyperon polarisation, which in turn is experimentally accessible via the weak, parity violating decay. Furthermore, from the spin correlation between the outgoing hyperon and antihyperon, the sign of the phase can be extracted. This means that the time-like form factors can be completely determined for the first time. The methods will be outlined and the prospects of the BES III form factor measurements will be given. We will also present a planned upgrade of the BES III detector which is expected to improve future form factor measurements.\n\nElectric and magnetic form factors of strange baryons\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVan Cauteren, T.; Merten, D.; Corthals, T.; Janssen, S.; Metsch, B.; Petry, H.-R.; Ryckebusch, J.\n\n.

The analysis of the ultraviolet (UV) limit reveals a generalized \"running\" form of the Polyakov action for a nonminimal scalar field and the usual Polyakov action in the conformally invariant cases. In the infrared (IR) we establish the gravitational decoupling theorem, which can be seen directly from the form factors or from the physical beta function for fields of any spin.\n\nThe structure of the nucleon: Elastic electromagnetic form factors\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nPunjabi, V.; Perdrisat, C.

This is known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) (or molecular-gas FMR), and it has a profound implication on models of galaxy evolution. However, there still remains a significant residual scatter around the FMR. We show here that a fourth parameter, the surface density of stellar mass, reduces the dispersion around the molecular-gas FMR. In a principal component analysis of 29 physical parameters of 41 338 star-forming galaxies, the surface density of stellar mass is found to be the fourth most important parameter. The new 4D fundamental relation forms a tighter hypersurface that reduces the metallicity dispersion to 50 per cent of that of the molecular-gas FMR. We suggest that future analyses and models of galaxy evolution should consider the FMR in a 4D space that includes surface density. The dilution time-scale of gas inflow and the star-formation efficiency could explain the observational dependence on surface density of stellar mass.\n\nThe Impact of Three Factors on the Recovery of Item Parameters for the Three-Parameter Logistic Model\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKim, Kyung Yong; Lee, Won-Chan\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis article provides a detailed description of three factors (specification of the ability distribution, numerical integration, and frame of reference for the item parameter estimates) that might affect the item parameter estimation of the three-parameter logistic model, and compares five item calibration methods, which are combinations of theâ¦\n\nCalculation of the Nucleon Axial Form Factor Using Staggered Lattice QCD\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMeyer, Aaron S.; Hill, Richard J.; Kronfeld, Andreas S.\n\nThe nucleon axial form factor is a dominant contribution to errors in neutrino oscillation studies.

The form factor is compared to a previously derived expression where the lowest order electron velocity, beta[over], corrections are included [J. Sheffield, (Academic Press, New York, 1975)]. The beta[over ] expansion approach is sufficient for electrostatic waves with small phase velocities such as ion-acoustic waves, but for electron-plasma waves the phase velocities can be near luminal. At high phase velocities, the electron motion acquires relativistic corrections including effective electron mass, relative motion of the electrons and electromagnetic wave, and polarization rotation. These relativistic corrections alter the scattered emission of thermal plasma waves, which manifest as changes in both the peak power and width of the observed Thomson-scattered spectra.\n\nThe Nucleon Axial Form Factor and Staggered Lattice QCD\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMeyer, Aaron Scott\n\nThe study of neutrino oscillation physics is a major research goal of the worldwide particle physics program over the upcoming decade. Many new experiments are being built to study the properties of neutrinos and to answer questions about the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation. These experiments need precise theoretical cross sections in order to access fundamental neutrino properties. Neutrino oscillation experiments often use large atomic nuclei as scattering targets, which are challenging for theorists to model. Nuclear models rely on free-nucleon amplitudes as inputs. These amplitudes are constrained by scattering experiments with large nuclear targets that rely on the very samemoreÂ Â» nuclear models. The work in this dissertation is the rst step of a new initiative to isolate and compute elementary amplitudes with theoretical calculations to support the neutrino oscillation experimental program. Here, the eort focuses on computing the axial form factor, which is the largest contributor of systematic error in the primary signal measurement process for neutrino oscillation studies, quasielastic scattering. Two approaches are taken. First, neutrino scattering data on a deuterium target are reanalyzed with a model-independent parametrization of the axial form factor to quantify the present uncertainty in the free-nucleon amplitudes. The uncertainties on the free-nucleon cross section are found to be underestimated by about an order of magnitude compared to the ubiquitous dipole model parametrization. The second approach uses lattice QCD to perform a rst-principles computation of the nucleon axial form factor. The Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action is employed for both valence and sea quarks. The results presented in this dissertation are computed at physical pion mass for one lattice spacing. This work presents a computation of the axial form factor at zero momentum transfer, and forms the basis for a computation of the axial form factor momentum\n\nNucleon electromagnetic form factors using lattice simulations at the physical point\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlexandrou, C.; Constantinou, M.; Hadjiyiannakou, K.; Jansen, K.; Kallidonis, Ch.; Koutsou, G.; Vaquero Aviles-Casco, A.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nWe present results for the nucleon electromagnetic form factors using an ensemble of maximally twisted mass clover-improved fermions with pion mass of about 130 MeV. We use multiple sink-source separations and three analysis methods to probe ground-state dominance. We evaluate both the connected and disconnected contributions to the nucleon matrix elements. We find that the disconnected quark loop contributions to the isoscalar matrix elements are small, giving an upper bound of up to 2% of the connected and smaller than its statistical error. We present results for the isovector and isoscalar electric and magnetic Sachs form factors and the corresponding proton and neutron form factors. By fitting the momentum dependence of the form factors to a dipole form or to the z expansion, we extract the nucleon electric and magnetic radii, as well as the magnetic moment.

The power of sensitivity analysis on grouped factors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNossent, Jiri; Pereira, Fernando; Bauwens, Willy\n\n2017-04-01\n\nHydrological models are typically used to study and represent (a part of) the hydrological cycle. In general, the output of these models mostly depends on their input rainfall and parameter values. Both model parameters and input precipitation however, are characterized by uncertainties and, therefore, lead to uncertainty on the model output. Sensitivity analysis (SA) allows to assess and compare the importance of the different factors for this output uncertainty. Hereto, the rainfall uncertainty can be incorporated in the SA by representing it as a probabilistic multiplier. Such multiplier can be defined for the entire time series, or several of these factors can be determined for every recorded rainfall pulse or for hydrological independent storm events. As a consequence, the number of parameters included in the SA related to the rainfall uncertainty can be (much) lower or (much) higher than the number of model parameters. Although such analyses can yield interesting results, it remains challenging to determine which type of uncertainty will affect the model output most due to the different weight both types will have within the SA. In this study, we apply the variance based Sobol' sensitivity analysis method to two different hydrological simulators (NAM and HyMod) for four diverse watersheds. Besides the different number of model parameters (NAM: 11 parameters; HyMod: 5 parameters), the setup of our sensitivity and uncertainty analysis-combination is also varied by defining a variety of scenarios including diverse numbers of rainfall multipliers. To overcome the issue of the different number of factors and, thus, the different weights of the two types of uncertainty, we build on one of the advantageous properties of the Sobol' SA, i.e. treating grouped parameters as a single parameter. The latter results in a setup with a single factor for each uncertainty type and allows for a straightforward comparison of their importance. In general, the results show a clear\n\nThe Kroll-Lee-Zumino Model and Pion Form Factors\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDominguez, C.

Our simulations are performed on three different lattice sizes L3ÃT=243Ã32, 163Ã32, and 123Ã32 with a lattice cutoff of a-1â1.3GeV and light quark masses down to about 1/4 the strange quark mass (mÏâ390MeV) using a combination of the DBW2 gauge action and domain wall fermions. The physical volume of our largest lattice is about (3.6fm)3, where the finite volume effects on form factors become negligible and the lower momentum transfers (q2â0.1GeV2) are accessible. The q2 dependences of form factors in the low q2 region are examined. It is found that the vector, induced tensor, and axial-vector form factors are well described by the dipole form, while the induced pseudoscalar form factor is consistent with pion-pole dominance. We obtain the ratio of axial to vector coupling gA/gV=FA(0)/FV(0)=1.219(38) and the pseudoscalar coupling gP=mÎ¼FP(0.88mÎ¼2)=8.15(54), where the errors are statistical errors only. These values agree with experimental values from neutron Î² decay and muon capture on the proton. However, the root mean-squared radii of the vector, induced tensor, and axial vector underestimate the known experimental values by about 20%. We also calculate the pseudoscalar nucleon matrix element in order to verify the axial Ward-Takahashi identity in terms of the nucleon matrix elements, which may be called as the generalized Goldberger-Treiman relation.\n\n$$B\\\\to Kl^+l^-$$ decay form factors from three-flavor lattice QCD\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nBailey, Jon A.\n\n2016-01-27\n\nWe compute the form factors for the B â Kl +l - semileptonic decay process in lattice QCD using gauge-field ensembles with 2+1 flavors of sea quark, generated by the MILC Collaboration.

QCD factorization for the vacuum-to- B-meson correlation function with an interpolating current for the D-meson is demonstrated explicitly at one loop with the power counting scheme {m}_cË O(â{Î {m}_b}) . The jet functions encoding information of the hard-collinear dynamics in the above-mentioned correlation function are complicated by the appearance of an additional hard-collinear scale m c , compared to the counterparts entering the factorization formula of the vacuum-to- B-meson correction function for the construction of B â Ï from factors. Inspecting the next-to-leading-logarithmic sum rules for the form factors of B â DâÎ½ indicates that perturbative corrections to the hard-collinear functions are more profound than that for the hard functions, with the default theory inputs, in the physical kinematic region. We further compute the subleading power correction induced by the three-particle quark-gluon distribution amplitudes of the B-meson at tree level employing the background gluon field approach. The LCSR predictions for the semileptonic B â DâÎ½ form factors are then extrapolated to the entire kinematic region with the z-series parametrization. Phenomenological implications of our determinations for the form factors f BD +,0 ( q 2) are explored by investigating the (differential) branching fractions and the R( D) ratio of B â DâÎ½ and by determining the CKM matrix element |V cb | from the total decay rate of B â DÎ¼Î½ Î¼ .\n\nNucleon form factors with 2+1 flavor dynamical domain-wall fermions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYamazaki, Takeshi; Aoki, Yasumichi; Blum, Tom; Lin, Huey-Wen; Ohta, Shigemi; Sasaki, Shoichi; Tweedie, Robert; Zanotti, James\n\n2009-06-01\n\nWe report our numerical lattice QCD calculations of the isovector nucleon form factors for the vector and axial-vector currents: the vector, induced tensor, axial-vector, and induced pseudoscalar form factors. The calculation is carried out with the gauge configurations generated with Nf=2+1 dynamical domain-wall fermions and Iwasaki gauge actions at Î²=2.13, corresponding to a cutoff a-1=1.73GeV, and a spatial volume of (2.7fm)3. The up and down-quark masses are varied so the pion mass lies between 0.33 and 0.67 GeV while the strange quark mass is about 12% heavier than the physical one. We calculate the form factors in the range of momentum transfers, 0.2form factors are well described by the conventional dipole forms and result in significant underestimation of the Dirac and Pauli mean-squared radii and the anomalous magnetic moment compared to the respective experimental values. We show that the axial-vector form factor is significantly affected by the finite spatial volume of the lattice. In particular in the axial charge, gA/gV, the finite-volume effect scales with a single dimensionless quantity, mÏL, the product of the calculated pion mass and the spatial lattice extent. Our results indicate that for this quantity, mÏL>6 is required to ensure that finite-volume effects are below 1%.\n\nConstraints on the ÏÏ Form Factor from Analyticity and Unitarity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAnanthanarayan, B.; Caprini, Irinel; Kubis, Bastian\n\nForm factors are important low-energy quantities and an accurate knowledge of these sheds light on the strong interactions.

Its electromagnetic structure is then parametrized by a single, dimensionless quantity known as the form factor, the two-dimensional Fourier transform of which yields the quantity of transverse charge density. Transverse charge density, in turn, provides a needed framework for the interpretation of form factors in terms of physical charge and magnetization, both with respect to the propagation of a fast-moving nucleon. To this is added the value of strange quarks in ultimately presenting a universal, process-independent description of nucleons, further augmenting the importance of studying the kaon's internal structure. The pressing character of such research questions directs the present paper, describing the first extraction of transverse charge density from electromagnetic kaon form factor data. The extraction is notably extended to form factor data at recently acquired higher energy levels, whose evaluation could permit more complete phenomenological models for kaon behavior to be proposed.

This is accomplished by using a pressurized neck cuff which constricts and distends the carotid artery and subsequently stimulates the baroreceptors. Nine physiological responses to this type of stimulation are quantified and used as indicators of the baroreflex. Thirty male humans between the ages 27 and 46 underwent the carotid-cardiac baroreflex test. The data for the nine response parameters were analyzed by principle component factor analysis. The results of this analysis indicated that 93 percent of the total variance across all nine parameters could be explained in four dimensions. Examination of the factor loadings following an orthogonal rotation of the principle components indicated four well defined dimensions. The first two dimensions reflected location points for R-R interval and carotid distending pressure respectively. The third dimension was composed of measures reflecting the gain of the reflex. The fourth dimension was the ratio of the resting R-R interval to R-R interval during simulated hypertension. The data suggests that the analysis of all nine baroreflex parameters is redundant.\n\nIso-vector form factors of the delta and nucleon in QCD sum rules\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nOzpineci, A.\n\nForm factors are important non-perturbative properties of hadrons.

Peter; Lytle, Andrew\n\n2018-03-01\n\nMeasurements and theoretical calculations of meson form factors are essential for our understanding of internal hadron structure and QCD, the dynamics that bind the quarks in hadrons. The pion electromagnetic form factor has been measured at small space-like momentum transfer |q2| < 0.3 GeV2 by pion scattering from atomic electrons and at values up to 2.5 GeV2 by scattering electrons from the pion cloud around a proton. On the other hand, in the limit of very large (or infinite) Q2 = -q2, perturbation theory is applicable. This leaves a gap in the intermediate Q2 where the form factors are not known. As a part of their 12 GeV upgrade Jefferson Lab will measure pion and kaon form factors in this intermediate region, up to Q2 of 6 GeV2. This is then an ideal opportunity for lattice QCD to make an accurate prediction ahead of the experimental results. Lattice QCD provides a from-first-principles approach to calculate form factors, and the challenge here is to control the statistical and systematic uncertainties as errors grow when going to higher Q2 values. Here we report on a calculation that tests the method using an Î·s meson, a 'heavy pion' made of strange quarks, and also present preliminary results for kaon and pion form factors. We use the nf = 2 + 1 + 1 ensembles made by the MILC collaboration and Highly Improved Staggered Quarks, which allows us to obtain high statistics. The HISQ action is also designed to have small dicretisation errors. Using several light quark masses and lattice spacings allows us to control the chiral and continuum extrapolation and keep systematic errors in check.

The calculations were done using eight ensembles of gauge configurations generated by the MILC collaboration using the HISQ action with 2 + 1 + 1 dynamical flavors. These ensembles span three lattice spacings a â 0.06 , 0.09, and 0.12 fm and light-quark masses corresponding to the pion masses M Ï â 135, 225, and 310 MeV. High-statistics estimates allow us to quantify systematic uncertainties in the extraction of G A (Q 2)moreÂ Â» and the induced pseudoscalar form factor G P(Q 2) . We perform a simultaneous extrapolation in the lattice spacing, lattice volume and light-quark masses of the axial charge radius r A data to obtain physical estimates. Using the dipole ansatz to fit the Q 2 behavior we obtain r A | dipole = 0.49(3) fm , which corresponds to M A = 1.39(9) GeV , and is consistent with M A = 1.35(17) GeV obtained by the miniBooNE collaboration. The estimate obtained using the z -expansion is r A | z - expansion = 0.46(6) fm, and the combined result is r A | combined = 0.48(4) fm. Analysis of the induced pseudoscalar form factor G P (Q 2) yields low estimates for g* P and g ÏNN compared to their phenomenological values. To understand these, we analyze the partially conserved axial current (PCAC) relation by also calculating the pseudoscalar form factor. Lastly, we find that these low values are due to large deviations in the PCAC relation between the three form factors, and in the pion-pole dominance hypothesis.Â«Â less\n\nAxial-vector form factors of the nucleon from lattice QCD\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nGupta, Rajan; Jang, Yong-Chull; Lin, Huey-Wen; ...\n\n2017-12-04\n\nIn this paper, we present results for the form factors of the isovector axial vector current in the nucleon state using large scale simulations of lattice QCD. The calculations were done using eight ensembles of gauge configurations generated by the MILC collaboration using the HISQ action with 2 + 1 + 1 dynamical flavors. These ensembles span three lattice spacings a â 0.06 , 0.09, and 0.12 fm and light-quark masses corresponding to the pion masses M Ï â 135, 225, and 310 MeV. High-statistics estimates allow us to quantify systematic uncertainties in the extraction of G A (Q 2)moreÂ Â» and the induced pseudoscalar form factor G P(Q 2) . We perform a simultaneous extrapolation in the lattice spacing, lattice volume and light-quark masses of the axial charge radius r A data to obtain physical estimates. Using the dipole ansatz to fit the Q 2 behavior we obtain r A | dipole = 0.49(3) fm , which corresponds to M A = 1.39(9) GeV , and is consistent with M A = 1.35(17) GeV obtained by the miniBooNE collaboration. The estimate obtained using the z -expansion is r A | z - expansion = 0.46(6) fm, and the combined result is r A | combined = 0.48(4) fm.

The electric (GE) and the magnetic ( GM) form factors contain information about the spatial distribution of the charge and magnetization inside the nucleon. A significant discrepancy exists between the Rosenbluth and the polarization transfer measurements of the electromagnetic form factors of the proton. One possible explanation for the discrepancy is the contributions of two-photon exchange (TPE) effects. Theoretical calculations estimating the magnitude of the TPE effect are highly model dependent, and limited experimental evidence for such effects exists. Experimentally, the TPE effect can be measured by comparing the ratio of positron-proton elastic scattering cross section to that of the electron-proton [R = sigma(e +p)/sigma(e+p)]. The ratio R was measured over a wide range of kinematics, utilizing a 5.6 GeV primary electron beam produced by the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Jefferson Lab. This dissertation explored dependence of R on kinematic variables such as squared four-momentum transfer (Q2) and the virtual photon polarization parameter (epsilon). A mixed electron-positron beam was produced from the primary electron beam in experimental Hall B. The mixed beam was scattered from a liquid hydrogen (LH2) target. Both the scattered lepton and the recoil proton were detected by the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS). The elastic events were then identified by using elastic scattering kinematics. This work extracted the Q2 dependence of R at high epsilon(epsilon > 0.8) and the $epsilon dependence of R at approx 0.85 GeV2. In these kinematics, our data confirm the validity of the hadronic calculations of the TPE effect by Blunden, Melnitchouk, and Tjon. This hadronic TPE effect, with additional corrections contributed by higher excitations of the intermediate state nucleon, largely\n\nThe meaning of the \"universal\" WLF parameters of glass-forming polymer liquids\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDudowicz, Jacek; Douglas, Jack F.; Freed, Karl F.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAlthough the Williams-Landell-Ferry (WLF) equation for the segmental relaxation time Ï(T) of glass-forming materials is one of the most commonly encountered relations in polymer physics, its molecular basis is not well understood. The WLF equation is often claimed to be equivalent to the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) equation, even though the WLF expression for Ï(T) contains no explicit dependence on the fragility parameter D of the VFT equation, while the VFT equation lacks any explicit reference to the glass transition temperature Tg, the traditionally chosen reference temperature in the WLF equation. The observed approximate universality of the WLF parameters C1 ( g ) and C2 ( g ) implies that Ï(T) depends only on T-Tg, a conclusion that seems difficult to reconcile with the VFT equation where the fragility parameter D largely governs the magnitude of Ï(T). The current paper addresses these apparent inconsistencies by first evaluating the macroscopic WLF parameters C1 ( g ) and C2 ( g ) from the generalized entropy theory of glass-formation and then by determining the dependence of C1 ( g ) and C2 ( g ) on the microscopic molecular parameters (including the strength of the cohesive molecular interactions and the degree of chain stiffness) and on the molar mass of the polymer. Attention in these calculations is restricted to the temperature range (Tg < T < Tg + 100 K), where both the WLF and VFT equations apply.\n\nSensitivity analysis of respiratory parameter uncertainties: impact of criterion function form and constraints.\n\nPubMed\n\nLutchen, K R\n\n1990-08-01\n\nA sensitivity analysis based on weighted least-squares regression is presented to evaluate alternative methods for fitting lumped-parameter models to respiratory impedance data. The goal is to maintain parameter accuracy simultaneously with practical experiment design. The analysis focuses on predicting parameter uncertainties using a linearized approximation for joint confidence regions. Applications are with four-element parallel and viscoelastic models for 0.125- to 4-Hz data and a six-element model with separate tissue and airway properties for input and transfer impedance data from 2-64 Hz. The criterion function form was evaluated by comparing parameter uncertainties when data are fit as magnitude and phase, dynamic resistance and compliance, or real and imaginary parts of input impedance. The proper choice of weighting can make a"
