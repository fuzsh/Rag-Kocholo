        "text": "Title: We\n\nAuthor: Yevgeny Zamyatin\n\nGenre: Science Fiction / Classics / Dystopia\n\nDate: 1993 (1924)\n\nPublisher: Penguin\n\nPages: 225\n\nStarted: 25th October 2017\n\nCompleted: 28th October 2017\n\nRating: 4.5/5\n\nSummary: We tells the story of the minutely organised United State, where all citizens are not individuals but only he-Numbers and she-Numbers existing in identical glass apartments with every action regulated by the “Table of Hours.” It is a community dedicated to the proposition that freedom and happiness are incompatible; that most men believe their freedom to be more than a fair exchange for a high level of materialistic happiness.\n\nWe, written in about 1919, is often considered to be the grandfather of the futuristic dystopia genre. It was the first work banned by Goskomizdat, the Soviet Union’s censorship bureau, in 1921 but it was published in English in 1924. However, it wasn’t published in the Soviet Union until 1988, over 50 years after Zamyatin died.\n\nI loved this novel. I’ve been wanted to read it ever since I found out that it was part of the inspiration for George Orwell’s 1984 which I love. It’s taken me such a long time to get around to reading it but it was worth the wait since it’s now one of my favourite books.\n\nI really like how the novel is framed. Each chapter is called a ‘record’ and it’s a diary entry from the main character which means that the whole novel is in the first person. This allows you an insight into the mind of the protagonist, D-503, and you experience everything that he thinks and feels. It works spectacularly well in a book like this because you feel as though you’re part of the revolution against the totalitarian government which is exhilarating.\n\nThe plot was fantastic and I can see why other writers used this novel when exploring their own dystopian worlds. It plays on a lot of our insecurities around humanity and individuality. Normal things like raising children have been handed over to the government and the family system is nonexistent (like in Brave New World) and there’s mass surveillance (as in Nineteen Eighty-Four) as everyone’s houses are made completely out of glass and they can only draw the blinds at specific times of the day.\n\nEveryone in this world is literally a Number, it’s the only way that they can be identified, and everyone works for the Benefactor and the One State. When you consider the fact that a lot of workers in our world have an employee number so that their company can identify them it makes this novel rather scary because you lose your individuality when you go to work as you just become a number to them rather than an actual person.\n\nThe characters in this book were intense but you only ever see them through D-503’s eyes. I-330 is described by her lips rather often, he calls them bloody and sharp, and it was interesting to see how she was sexualised in a way that D-503’s other main lover, O-90, wasn’t. It feels like I-330 seduces D-503 into both her bed and the revolution against the One State. I loved O-90. She’s considered too short to have children since she wouldn’t produce perfect children, and she’s willing to risk her life to have a child of her own. She’s very passionate and very strong.\n\nThe writing was incredible. It was frenzied and feverish as D-503 thought that he was going mad and that gave a sense of urgency to the novel as you’re immersed in D-503’s splintering mind while he’s an active part of the revolution against everything he’s ever known. I’m not sure if this was a product of the translation but I imagine it was the intention of Zamyatin too. If you’ve read the original Russian version then please tell me what it’s like. The story was very fragmented and I felt like that reflected D-503’s mind as he struggled with his infatuation towards I-330 and his new found ability to think independently, although he is heavily influenced by I-330 so I’m sure he was independent after all.\n\nThe ending was perfect. It was wonderfully ambiguous as the future of the One State is uncertain. I love ambiguous endings for revolutionary or dystopian novels because it gives you hope. I’ll always have that hope that the One State was defeated but I’ll never know if it was.\n\nThe book had some awful racial stereotypes towards a black character, R-13, who is the protagonist’s best friend but it was written in c.1919 so I wasn’t surprised by the metaphors being used. However, there was no need for it since R-13 was meant to be D-503’s best friend and I don’t know anyone who would think of their best friend in such a way. I’m accepting it as a product of its time but I’ll never understand why there’s so much focus on R-13’s physical appearance.\n\nOverall, I loved this book and I’d definitely recommend it.\n\nOther notes: I had a dodgy edition of this book. The whole of ‘record 2’ was missing and in its place was ‘record 1’ again. So, I have no idea what happened in ‘record 2’. I will read it one day but for now, I’ll just live in wonder. Also, the cover that I’ve featured isn’t the edition that I read but it is the edition that I’ve linked to. It’s by the same publisher and the same translator so I don’t think there’ll be too many differences."
