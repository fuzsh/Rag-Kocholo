Russian novelist Yevgeny Zamyatin's masterpiece: \"a remarkable Utopian fantasy, a landmark in world literature, the precursor of and almost certainly the model for 'Brave New World' and '1984'. We is an icily etched portrait of a dehumanized society of the future with its ubiquitous timetables, days set aside for sexual activities, glass-box living accommodation and ever-alert watch-dog police, presided over by 'The Benefactor'\" (from the blurb). The novel was banned by the new Soviet censorship bureau in 1921 and was first published, in English, in New York in 1924. A Czech language edition followed, where it was condemned by a state-sponsored literary group. Zamyatin was seen as a dissident, his subsequent literary output suppressed, and eventually he personally wrote to Stalin to request exile rather than starve at home. This translation preceded the first Russian edition, which did not appear until 1988."
