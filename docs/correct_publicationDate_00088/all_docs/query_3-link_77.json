        "text": "MARM 2023\n\nAlthough an anarchist, I am by and large, a fan of Communism and of Revolutions, though it is a sad fact that the “dictatorship of the proletariat” almost always becomes just plain old “dictatorship” under the unrelenting pressure from oligarchs everywhere and the USA in particular who cannot afford to allow a Revolution to appear to succeed.\n\nYevgeny Zamyatin (1884-1937) was a Russian naval engineer, a writer and a Bolshevik who participated in the abortive 1905 Revolution, after which he was imprisoned and exiled, and then the Russian Revolutions of 1917 which led first to parliamentary government and then to Communism.\n\nThe anarchists who had supported the Bolsheviks through 1905 and 1917 were soon disillusioned, and in 1921 Lenin and Trotsky were forced to put down serious anarchist rebellions demanding:\n\n“reduction in Bolshevik power; newly elected soviets (councils) to include socialist and anarchist groups; economic freedom for peasants and workers; dissolution of the bureaucratic governmental organs created during the civil war; and the restoration of civil rights for the working class.” (wiki).\n\nWhile I won’t claim Zamyatin as an anarchist it seems clear that he too was quickly disillusioned with Leninism. We, a satire on regimented society, was probably written in 1920-21. Wikipedia currently says that in 1921 it was “the first work banned by the Soviet censorship board” (here), though George Orwell, writing in 1946, says that “WE was written about 1923, and […] was refused publication on the ground that it was ideologically undesirable” before being smuggled out of the country.\n\nA Czech translation was soon circulating in Soviet Russia, leading to Zamyatin coming under pressure from the authorities, including at one stage imprisonment. In 1930 Zamyatin resigned from the Union of Soviet Writers, and in 1931 he petitioned Stalin, who had replaced Lenin on the latter’s death in 1924, for permission to emigrate. He died in Paris in 1937.\n\nOrwell’s review of We (Tribune, 4 January 1946) is best known for stating, “the fact – never pointed out, I believe-that Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World must be partly derived from it. Both books deal with the rebellion of the primitive human spirit against a rationalised, mechanised, painless world, and both stories are supposed to take place about six hundred years hence”, going on, “Huxley’s book shows less political awareness and is more influenced by recent biological and psychological theories.” He admired We – for which at the time he could only find a French version, under the title Nous Autres – and it had some influence on 1984, which came out in 1949.\n\nMarcie got me to read We for MARM because the latest translation has an Introduction by Margaret Atwwood which begins:\n\n“I didn’t read Zamyatin’s remarkable novel, WE, until the 1990s, many years after I’d written The Handmaid’s Tale. How could I have missed one of the most important dystopias of the twentieth century, and one that was a direct influence on George Orwell’s 1984 – which was a direct influence on me?”\n\nI must say I prefer Ursula K Le Guin’s description in ‘The Stalin in the Soul’, in the Supplementary Materials in the same edition: “a science fiction novel, a negative Utopia”. Her essay is mostly about censorship and puts Zamyatin in the company of Pasternak and Solzhenitsyn, writers promoted by the CIA for their anti-Soviet value.\n\nAtwood, and apparently Le Guin, believe We is a satire on Stalinism, written some years before Stalin took power but foreshadowed by Lenin’s own authoritarianism. Orwell, is not so sure. Even given that pure revolutionists were soon disillusioned by the direction the Revolution was taking, 1921 or even 1923, is very early for such a mature satire. And he points back to Zamyatin’s experience of modern government on a working visit to Britain in 1916 (supervising the construction of icebreakers for the Russian Navy) which is interesting as much as for what it says about Orwell as it does about Zamyatin.\n\nThe basis of the story is that some centuries into the future, society, protected from the outside world by the Wall, has settled on a form of government in which all individuality is subsumed for the good of the state – the United State, ruled over by the Well-Doer. The most arresting image is of every citizen walking in lock step during exercise periods.\n\n[the ancients] preferred to believe that they saw heaven, even though it was a toy made of clay, rather than confess to themselves that it was only a blue nothing. We on the other hand (Glory to the Well-Doer!), we are adults and we have no need of toys. Now if we put a drop of acid on the idea of “right”…. Even the ancients (the most mature of them) knew that the source of right was—might! Right is a function of might. Here we have our scale: on the one side an ounce, on the other a ton. On one side “I,” on the other “we,” the United State. Is it not clear? To assume that I may have any “right” as far as the State is concerned, is like assuming that an ounce may equilibrate a ton in a scale! Hence the natural distribution: tons—rights, grams—duties. And the natural road from nothingness to greatness, is to forget that one is a gram and to feel that one is one-millionth of a ton!\n\nRecord 20\n\nThe narrator, D-503 (everyone has numbers, not names) is the engineer in charge of building a giant spaceship to explore Mars. We is his journal, broken into 40 ‘records’. D503 has been assigned a lover, O-90. “Dear O—! She always seems to me to look like her name, O—. She is approximately ten centimeters shorter than the required Maternal Norm. Therefore she appears all round; the rose-colored O of her lips is open to meet every word of mine. She has a round soft dimple on her wrist. Children have such dimples.”\n\nSlowly, D-503 becomes attracted to another woman, I-330, who meets him in strange places and encourages him to break rules and then not report himself to the Guardians. The reader becomes aware, more quickly than does D-503, that I-330 is a member of an underground movement and is more interested in the spaceship than its builder.\n\nThe regular vote for the Well-Doer comes around and not every citizen raises their hand. The next Revolution has begun.\n\nAtwood writes: “Zamyatin holds out the possibility of escape: beyond the Wall is a natural world where there are free ‘barbarian’ human beings, covered with – could it be fur?”\n\nShe sees We being written at a time when the Russian Revolution’s promise of utopia was fading into dystopia, though in fact the years since October 1917 had been filled with civil war, which the Bolsheviks had only just won. Still, Zamyatin was alarmed enough by the authoritarianism inherent in Bolshevism, or perhaps just by the authoritarianism inherent in most systems of government, to write this protest, so perhaps the anarchists should claim him after all.\n\n.\n\nYevgeny Zamyatin, We, first pub. in English, EP Dutton, New York, 1924.
