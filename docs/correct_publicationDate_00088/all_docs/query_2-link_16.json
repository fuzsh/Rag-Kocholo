        "text": "As is the case with most books from the first half of the twentieth century that influenced others, Yevgeny Zamyatin’s We begins with an introduction. Written by the book’s translator, Mirra Ginsburg, this introduction tells us about Zamyatin’s life, his influences, and includes an overview of We‘s impact along with a critique.\n\nSince We was considered too dangerous to be printed in Soviet Russia and it’s given sparkling acclaim, my expectations for it are pretty high. Not to mention the influence that We had on George Orwell’s 1984, the one novel from my high school English classes that’s really stuck with me.\n\nSo, what’s there to say after reading We‘s first twenty pages?\n\nWell, Zamyatin does something unheard of in most modern fiction: he writes in the first person.\n\nThe conceit of the book is that it is an account of life in the One State written by the engineer who built a space colonization capsule called The Integral. The Integral is to be filled with the works of scientists, mathematicians, poets, and writers so that any foreign entities with which it comes into contact will be able to learn about the One State and how it is, by far, the best sort of society.\n\nTo this point in the book, this One State sounds like any standard utopia that appears dystopic when put under scrutiny. Because he’s doing just that, such will likely be the conclusion of our protagonist, D-503.\n\nYes, D-503.\n\nUsed to great effect, the book’s characters don’t have names. Instead, they’re designated by a single letter followed by three numbers. I’m not sure if the letter or the size of the number have any meaning outside of designation, and I’m not sure if I’ll find out between now and the book’s ending.\n\nAnyway, the One State sounds like it is a grand human machine, in which all of its citizens work in tandem to achieve perfect productive harmony. Though, aside from building a space ship, being one of the state Guardians, or acting as the mysterious Benefactor, I’m not sure what most of the people do in the One State. Twice a day (from 4pm to 5pm and from 9pm to 10pm) everyone has personal time. When we first start following D-503, he spends his personal time out on an obligatory walk with his registered partner O-90.\n\nD-503 thinks about sex, he thinks about emotions, he thinks about inspiration and desires.\n\nBut no thought police grab him. No sentinel swoops down to suppress his wandering mind. And this strikes me as strange.\n\nD-503’s clearly not the only one feeling these things, since O-90 professes her desire to engage in sexual time with D-503 a day before the state-allotted time, and, when I last left them during this time, she had just broken down about some unknown issue. D-503 guesses it’s her desire for a child (unfulfillable, since she’s 10cm too short for the Maternal standard?), but then considers something else only to dismiss it from his account as too absurd.\n\nSince such emotions are free to roam around, I’m not too sure about how dystopian We will be compared to 1984 and A Brave New World, but I am willing to let D-503 show me around his One State some more.\n\nAs he describes the unison of all the people walking in time with the music playing during personal time, of all the people working at whatever it is that makes the State, of the grand Time Table, he captures so well the feeling that I’d get when I’d see everyone in my kung fu classes working through the stretches in unison.\n\nThis One State is indeed a strange new world, and oddly, instead of the frightened automata of 1984 or drugged up denizens of Brave New World, we’re seeing actual people in it. Serial-code style names notwithstanding.\n\nHow do you like your dystopian fiction? Do you think it’s best when it’s clearly dystopic from the very beginning, or when it gradually becomes so?"
