Robert Gant (born Robert González on July 13, 1968, in Tampa, Florida, U.S.) is an American actor. He is sometimes credited as Robert J. Gant.

Biography

Gant began acting in television commercials and joined the Screen Actors Guild at the age of ten in his home state of Florida. He attended undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania and law school at Georgetown University. While studying law, he never gave up on his true passion, acting, and performed in numerous theatrical productions. It was his career as a lawyer that brought him to Los Angeles when he accepted a position with the world's largest law firm; the firm's Los Angeles office was closed soon after, so he decided to focus all of his time on acting.

Since 2001, Gant has appeared on television in Showtime's "Queer as Folk" as Ben Bruckner, his best-known role to date. Prior to "Queer as Folk", he appeared on the WB's "Popular" and on NBC's "Caroline in the City". Gant has made guest appearances on TV programs such as "Friends", "Veronica's Closet", "Becker", "Melrose Place", "Ellen", "Providence", and "Nip/Tuck". He also appeared in the independent films "The Contract", "Fits and Starts" and "Marie and Bruce", starring Julianne Moore and Matthew Broderick.

In June 2004, Gant, along with actress Cady Huffman (star of Broadway play "The Producers"), filmed "Billy's Dad is a Fudgepacker". The short film is an homage to 1950s educational films.

Activism

In 2003, Robert received a special civil rights award presented to him in New York's City Hall. Other recipients were Sharon Gless, and Gale Harold, also of "Queer as Folk", along with "Chicago" director Rob Marshall, Shirley MacLaine, and Steven Daldry. In 2004, Robert, along with other members of the "Queer as Folk" cast, were honored by The National Stonewall Democrats for creating, and presenting, positive and loving gay families in all their variations. In May of that same year (2003), The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF) honored Robert at their annual NGLTF Leadership Awards in Washington, D.C; and in 2006, The Human Rights Campaign presented Robert with the National Equality Award at the 11th Annual Nashville Rights Campaign Equality Dinner.

His time in Hollywood is not limited to acting, however. Along with producing partners Chad Allen, and Christopher Racster, Robert has started the film and television production company, "Mythgarden". They have optioned a slate of initial projects, each with varying degrees of gay-focused content, and are developing a number of other films and television shows.

While he gives time to a number of philanthropic and political causes, Gant's “torch issue” is that of aging in the gay community. He supports such organizations as SAGE (Senior Advocacy for GLBT Elders) and GLEH (Gay and Lesbian Elder Housing). He is also developing a website devoted entirely to gay elders and matters that affect them.

He supported Hillary Rodham Clinton in her bid for the Democratic Party's Presidential nomination.

As of 2007, Gant resides in Los Angeles.

He is set to co-star with Lisa Edelstein & Brenda Song in Special Delivery, a Lifetime Movie Network Original Movie airing in late 2008.
