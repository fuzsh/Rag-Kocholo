        "text": "It wasn’t until his father died from liver disease that Grant found out the truth about Kingdon’s disappearance.\n\nRather than a seaside resort, she had been placed in a mental asylum to be treated for mania.\n\nGrant was able to reunite with his mother as he arranged her release and looked after her financially for the rest of her life.\n\nDuring his adolescent years without his mum, Grant became a troubled teen and got himself expelled from school at the age of 14.\n\nWithout the commitments of schooling, Grant ventured into circus arts and joined Loomis Troupe, a collective of acrobats.\n\nThe film was a box office success, and the shifting criteria of Hollywood soon flipped in Grant’s favour as he became the epitome of a handsome leading man.\n\nThe Thirties proved fruitful for Grant as he quickly became the leading lad of choice in Hollywood.\n\nFrom comedies, to drama and everything in between, Grant was a household name when he took an unprecedented step for someone of such fame.\n\nIn 1935 his contract with Paramount expired and not only did the actor avoid renewing it, he didn’t sign with any other studios.\n\nThis made him one of the first to leave the studio system and while it was certainly a risky move it allowed him to earn far more as a freelance artist.\n\nGrant simultaneously became one of the most successful freelance actors and one of the wealthiest actors of the time."
