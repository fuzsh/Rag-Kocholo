        "text": "Reverend Jeptha Van Valkenburg (founder of Erie) born in Schoharie County, New York in 1823.\n\nReverend Richard J. Van Valkenburg of Erie, Weld County, is known far and wide and is deservedly esteemed in religious, fraternal, and civic circles. Van Valkenburg made his way to Colorado from Erie, Pennsylvania. Not only was he the founder of the Erie Methodist Church, but he helped organize the establishment of the Town, which was named for his place of birth, Erie, PA. He served Erie as Mayor, postmaster, police judge, president of the school board, and justice of the peace\n\nThe Town of Erie was officially established on November 16, 1874.\n\nR.J. Van Valkenburg and family settle in Erie and name the Town in honor of his former home of Erie, Pennsylvania.\n\nUnion Pacific decides to cross the Rocky Mountains through Wyoming, bypassing the rough mountain terrain of Berthoud Pass in Colorado to lay the 'most track in the least amount of time'. In November 2019, Denver Pacific Railway incorporated under the laws of Colorado by the 'Board Trade' as established for this undertaking. Former Governor Dr. John Evans and David H. Moffat propose to build the 106-mile link between Denver and Cheyenne. Denverites subscribe to $300,000 in bonds, Arapahoe County votes for the $500,000 bond issue.\n\nIn 1869, Oliver Wise, his wife Adaline (Ada) and their three children came across the plains from Wisconsin to settle in Colorado. Oliver built a small log cabin and began to farm the land. In 1870, he was granted a U.S. Homestead Patent on the property and began building a permanent farmhouse.\n\nThe first coal mining patent, bearing President U.S. Grant's signature is granted to John B. McCool. Briggs Mine is also established, the first commercial coal mine in the Erie area. Coal miners strike in Erie; 12 miners jailed.\n\nMining was the most significant industry in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Colorado. What spurred the advance of coal mining was the revitalization of metal mining in the late 1860s, coupled with the first railroad construction in Colorado. The impact of the railroads came first in the Northern Coalfield. In 1871, the Boulder Valley Railroad, building off the Denver Pacific line, laid track to the new town of Erie, some 20 miles north of Denver, and stimulated renewed development of the Northern Coalfield. Production of the Boulder Valley Mine surged as it became Colorado's largest producer for a time, and overall the statewide coal industry grew strongly, based primarily on the renewed output from the field. Erie became the most important coal town in Colorado.\n\nPictured: The Garfield Mine #2, south of Erie closed in 1905 from the Lois Regnier Waneka collection.\n\nThe Town of Erie was laid out and incorporated on November 16, 1874 (officers appointed in accordance to Territory of Colorado provisions for Town government). The first Mayor, then called the president of the Trustees, was George Meloor. Streets began to be named after prominent residents; Kattel, Briggs, Holbrook, Pierce, Moffat, and Cheesman.\n\nAt the time of incorporation in 1874, five temporary trustees governed the Town until a Mayor and city council were elected. Within a short time, Town business was being conducted in a new Town Hall, which doubled as a public meeting place and a classroom until the schoolhouse was built.\n\nThe old city hall building was renovated in 2005 and maintains continued visibility of use to the Town for occupation by the Erie Chamber of Commerce.\n\nErie's first school is established in 1874; 33 students enrolled. School was first held in the first Town Hall building (237 Wells Street) and in the 'Coffin' house at 525 Pierce Street.\n\nIn 1881, Erie's first Lincoln School building, and second official school, is built at Holbrook and Wells Streets. The four-room frame accommodated more than 100 enrolled students. The four rooms consisted of a large room in the center with other rooms on the south, west, and east. When the number of students outgrew this building, some of the children again attended school in the “coffin” house. This frame building was moved from the Holbrook Street site so that a new larger school could be built.\n\nA new Lincoln School building, made of bricks was constructed in 1906 and attendance started in January 1907. This building soon became inadequate, so in 1920 four additional rooms were built on the north end of the building. Up to the time the new 7-12 grade high school was built in 1929, this building was used by all twelve grades. In 1966, after 54 years of service, this Lincoln School building was abandoned for the new Erie Elementary School on County Line Road. In 1998, the Lincoln School building was given to the Town by RE-IJ School District to be used by the community. The Town Hall was moved into the building for the purpose it is now serving.\n\nIn 1883, Erie's first church, Welsh Presbyterian Church, was built. Services were conducted in Welsh. Erie's first cemetery was near the old Presbyterian church; this cemetery was eventually relocated and there is debate regarding its actual location and whether all of the graves had been moved. Some thought it was on the site of the current Methodist Parsonage, however, the site was in the adjacent block to the south. Some thought it was relocated because of a local flood while others discount the flooding.\n\nErie's first newspaper, the Erie-Canfield Independent wa s founded in 1884 and published until 1896.\n\nThe Knights of Labor Agency calls the first strike in the Northern fields and miners vote to strike.\n\nIn 1885, Erie has four doctors in Town.\n\nIn 1888, the United Methodist Church is built and dedicated. The total cost was $1,475. The vacated Presbyterian Church has moved from across the street to become the Methodist Church's activity center. It later became the Town community center.\n\nThe coal industry was 'sick', and in an effort to meet financial obligations, coal owners cut wages. By 1927 miners were ready to strike again. The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) organized a strike and soon had all mines in the state closed except the big Columbine Mine near Erie that was owned by the Rocky Mountain Fuel Company.\n\nBy mid-November 1927, it was cold and no coal was being mined for use by Valmont Power Plant, the University of Colorado, hospitals, railroads, businesses, and homes. The need for coal was critical. Miners were demonstrating at the Columbine Mine (with permission of the owners) and miners from Marshall joined the strike lines that marched through mine property every day.\n\nEarly on the morning of November 21, 1927, state police opened fire on the striking miners, killing six men, wounding thirteen miners, and injuring scores of individuals, including several women who were badly hurt. Martial law was declared in Colorado's northern coalfields. Miners gradually went back to work after losing this strike also.\n\nIn 1933 the National Industrial Recovery Act was passed, which automatically recognized unions in all United States coal mines. From that time on miners were allowed to join the United Mine Workers of America.\n\nIn 1927, the Washington mine opens."
