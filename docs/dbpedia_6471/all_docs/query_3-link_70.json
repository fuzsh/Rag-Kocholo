        "text": "Hugh Grant (born September 9, 1960, Hammersmith, London, England) is a British actor best known for his leading roles as the endearing and funny love interest in romantic comedies.\n\nIt was not until Grant’s senior year at the University of Oxford, where he was studying English literature, that he became involved in acting. He appeared in a student film, Privileged (1982), and joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society. Following graduation (1982), Grant wrote and occasionally performed in radio commercials and attempted to write a novel before turning once again to acting. His stage debut came at the Nottingham (England) Playhouse in 1985. Moving to London, he formed the Jockeys of Norfolk comedy troupe, for which he wrote, directed, and performed in revues.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nGrant began his professional film career with the James Ivory–Ismail Merchant film Maurice (1987), for which he won a best actor award at the Venice Film Festival. It was his charming performance as a British bachelor in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), however, that brought him to the attention of the general public; he won a Golden Globe Award for best actor and was named best actor by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Grant quickly followed up with Nine Months and a film adaptation of Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility, both of which were released in 1995. He took on a more serious role in Extreme Measures (1996), portraying an emergency room doctor, but he returned to romantic comedy with Notting Hill (1999), in which he starred as a bookstore owner who falls in love with a movie star (played by Julia Roberts).\n\nStepping out of his trademark role as the boyishly appealing leading man who ultimately gets the girl, Grant portrayed the womanizing boss and scheming sometime lover of the title character (Renée Zellweger) in Bridget Jones’s Diary (2001). His later films included About a Boy (2002), an adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel; Love Actually (2003); and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (2004). In 2007 Grant starred opposite Drew Barrymore as an aging pop star in Music and Lyrics. He next appeared in Did You Hear About the Morgans? (2009), a comedy about a married couple who enter a witness-protection program. In 2012 Grant provided the voice of a pirate captain in The Pirates! Band of Misfits, a stop-motion animation film, and he disappeared into multiple roles in the epic Cloud Atlas, which wove together six stories that spanned centuries."
