As magnificent as today's Strip may seem, it's but a shadow of the neon paradise that was Las Vegas. I grew up not far from here, and though I traveled the old world extensively, I never found another place like it.\"\n\n(Robert House's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Courier: \"What, my Pip-Boy?\"\n\nDoctor 0: \"*How dare you bring RobCo tech in here! What, are you showing off? How great Robert House and his biiiig company are?*\"\n\n(Dr. 0's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Courier: \"Attack me and you risk destroying the Chip.\"\n\nRobert House: \"By the time I was 30 years old, I was a billionaire 30 times over. I founded and ran a vast economic empire. Do you really think I'm going to let an upstart come into my home and ransom my property to me? I spent two centuries searching for the Platinum Chip. It's my invention, my property - mine. Now be a good courier and deliver it!\"\n\n(Robert House's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Courier: \"REPCONN's history. \"\n\nTour guide: \"REPCONN's illustrious history began way back in 2054, shortly after the famous Delta XI rocket was completed and launched. REPCONN's initial focus was on the development of fuel to be used in orbital propulsion in response to the energy crisis of 2052. Sad times, indeed. The company really took off when RobCo purchased REPCONN in late 2076 to develop unmanned rockets to explore the solar system.\"\n\n(Tour guide's dialogue)\n\n↑ Lucky 38 VIP keycard\n\n↑ 10.0 10.1 10.2 The Courier: \"Maybe there's a connection. Can you remember anything else about Robert House?\"\n\nRaul Tejada: \"I remember there were some weird stories about him, especially near the end. There was a tell-all in El Periodico de las Aburridas by a starlet House dated. She said they never, um... don't make me spell it out, boss. Anyway, she said all he wanted to do was scan her brain and make her dress up in different outfits.\"\n\nThe Courier: \"That's sickening.\"\n\nRaul Tejada: \"It was quite the scandal, at least in the Latin-American tabloid journalism market.\"\n\n(Raul Tejada's dialogue)\n\n↑ 11.0 11.1 The Courier: \"You say that you saved Las Vegas. How?\"\n\nRobert House: \"By 2065 I deemed it a mathematical certainty that an atomic war would devastate the Earth within 15 years. Every projection I ran confirmed it. I knew I couldn't \"save the world,\" nor did I care to. But I could save Vegas, and in the process, perhaps, save mankind. I set to work immediately. I thought I had plenty of time to prepare. As it turned out, I was 20 hours short.\"\n\n(Robert House's dialogue)\n\n↑ Fallout (TV series) Episode 8: The Beginning\n\n↑ 13.0 13.1 The Courier: \"What preparations did you make to save Las Vegas?\"\n\nRobert House: \"On the day of the Great War, 77 atomic warheads targeted Las Vegas, Hoover Dam, and its surrounding areas. My networked mainframes were able to predict and force-transmit disarm code subsets to 59 warheads, neutralizing them before impact. Laser cannons mounted on the roof of the Lucky 38 destroyed another 9 warheads. The rest got through, though none hit the city itself. A sub-optimal performance, admittedly. If only the Platinum Chip had arrived a day sooner...\"\n\n(Robert House's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Courier: \"I've never heard of the place you're talking about.\"\n\nElijah: \"Big Empty's a treasure box, a scientific graveyard of Old World misery. Like the Sierra Madre... there's treasures there, sleeping. Some, awake. The Holorifle, the Saturnite alloy... the hologram technology, hibernation chambers, Securitrons, the collars... ...even the suits attached to those things stalking the Villa... that's only the surface of what's there. Right now, the Sierra Madre is what I want.\"\n\n(Elijah's dialogue)\n\n↑ 15.0 15.1 The Courier: \"You appear to be a computer, not a man.\"\n\nRobert House: \"Don't let the video screens and computer terminals fool you. I'm flesh and blood, not silicon.\"\n\nThe Courier: \"The lifespan you're claiming is impossible, except for ghouls and super mutants.\"\n\nRobert House: \"[SUCCEEDED] I see you've made a study of the topic. My knowledge of the science of longevity would fill several text books... Perhaps, after a decade or two of economic reconstruction, I can commercialize these technologies and offer to others, such as yourself.\"\n\nThe Courier: \"How have you stayed alive all this time?\"\n\nRobert House: \"Let's just say it was very... costly. But I was willing to make the sacrifices longevity entailed, financial and otherwise.\"\n\n(Robert House's dialogue)\n\n↑ Lucky 38 terminal entries; control room terminal, Disable Cerebral Interface\n\n↑ The Courier: \"Why didn't the Platinum Chip arrive on time?\"\n\nRobert House: \"The Platinum Chip was printed in Sunnyvale, California on October 22nd, 2077 - the day before the Great War. It was to have been delivered by courier the following afternoon... but by then, the world had ended. The Chip contained vital software upgrades, but not just for my Securitrons. Every aspect of the missile defense grid would have been upgraded, too. Given that I had to make do with buggy software, the outcome could have been worse. I nearly died as it was.\"\n\n(Robert House's dialogue)\n\n↑ 18.0 18.1 The Courier: \"How did you nearly die, defending Vegas?\"\n\nRobert House: \"Software glitches set off a cascade of system crashes. I had to take the Lucky 38's reactor offline, lest it melt down. For nearly five years I battled power outages and more system crashes until I finally managed to reboot my data core with an older version of the OS. I spent the next few decades in a veritable coma. But I survived, obviously - and eventually thrived.\"\n\n(Robert House's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Courier: \"Can you tell me anything about Mr. House?\"\n\nRaul Tejada: \"Just how old do you think I am, boss? Because I can pretty much guarantee I'm older than that. Let me tell you a story from before the Great War: Everybody knew Robert House. He was a genius. A superstar. Founded RobCo at 22, dated Hollywood starlets, the works. They say he saved Las Vegas. I was in Mexico City when the bombs dropped. Even from there, we could see House's defensive rockets shooting down the incoming missiles. Everybody assumed he died in the War. Maybe he did. But his robots are still out there, roaming the Wastes. And now, a Mr. House rules New Vegas.\"\n\n(Raul Tejada's dialogue)\n\n↑ Courier: \"How have the Khans been kicked around?\"\n\nYes Man: \"They were one of the tribes the Three Families pushed out of Vegas! A whole bunch got killed! So they settled at Bitter Springs, but they kept being so obnoxious, the NCR had to kill a whole bunch more of them! So then they settle at Red Rock Canyon! There's just no getting rid of them!\"\n\n(Yes Man's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Courier: \"How did the Three Families defeat you?\"\n\nPapa Khan: \"They allied with Mr. House, the self-proclaimed master of New Vegas. He supported them with the resources of New Vegas: weapons, technology, caps. They were better equipped, and we could not stand against them.\"\n\n(Papa Khan's dialogue)\n\n↑ Courier: \"What can you tell me about Freeside?\"\n\nThe King: \"To understand Freeside, you have to look back a few years. Originally, we were all just tribes making a living in this area. That all changed when Mr. House came around. He made an offer to the three biggest tribes that were willing to listen to him. Today, everyone calls those tribes the Three Families, and they live in luxury and run their own casinos in the Strip. The rest of us were left to fight over the crumbs, living in the shadow of those more fortunate. Things got pretty nasty for a while. But we wanted more. A place of our own. A place where no one could tell us what to do. And we didn't want to go elsewhere to find it. So we took control of this place, and made it our own. And that's really all Freeside is, the best of a bad situation.\"\n\n(The King's dialogue)\n\n↑ Sarah Weintraub: \"All right! Please, follow me. We'll head into the vault right away. This bunker protects the entrance to the vault - solid stone outside and thick steel on the inside! Above us there's the control center for this level of the vault's life-support systems, electric grid, radioactive shields and all that jazz. Don't get lost! My vault has many corridors and rooms - although it is no longer symmetrical, after Mr. House threw us out. This is the main game-hall. Here we settled the big disputes among the vault's levels. Chosen representatives gambled against each other here. The winner earned the right to settle the dispute as wished by the collective. We used to have such parties in this diner! A bitch to clean later... but well worth it! This hall leads to our guest rooms. You can use the first room on our left. But no snooping next door! That's my room, always was. Down there is the game room! Each side of the vault had one... but the other is filled with concrete now. Okay, that wraps it up. I'll see you soon!\"\n\n(Sarah Weintraub's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Courier: \"What does Mr. House have to do with Vault 21?\"\n\nSarah Weintraub: \"Mr. House has everything to do with Vault 21. He tried to get us out before he filled it with concrete. I almost went ape! So, we convinced him - okay, Sheldon and I, right? We convinced him to leave the top level mostly intact!\"\n\n(Sarah Weintraub's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Courier: \"What do you know about the courier Benny shot?\"\n\nYes Man: \"I knew he/she was carrying the Platinum Chip! And I knew right where Benny should wait for him/her! That's why Benny put me here! To monitor Mr. House's data transmissions. They're all encrypted, of course - but I'm quite a decrypter! Did you know that Mr. House spent 812,545 caps hiring salvage teams to find the Platinum Chip- just in the last year alone? Of course you didn't! Or that there were seven couriers, but six of them were carrying junk? How about their exact routes, and the mercenary teams that screened them? I knew all that. Pretty smart, huh?\"\n\n(Yes Man's dialogue)\n\n↑ Mojave Express delivery order (6 of 6) and Mojave Express delivery order (4 of 6)\n\n↑ 27.0 27.1 The Courier: \"If the Chip's so valuable, why use a single courier to transport it?\"\n\nRobert House: \"You realize you were just one of many couriers, the rest of them dummies, so to speak? Add to that many thousands of caps worth of mercenary protection to screen your avenue of approach. Had I used an armed caravan to transport the Chip, I might as well have been announcing to the world \"this is important. Attack this!\" I didn't want to attract the attention of groups like the Great Khans or the Brotherhood of Steel. Alas, the real threat was closer to home.\"\n\n(Robert House's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Courier: \"Why didn't you intervene sooner when Benny ambushed me?\"\n\nRobert House: \"Why didn't Victor intervene sooner, you mean? Goodsprings is a bit too far away for me to reliably control a Securitron agent by remote. I can send and receive packets of data, at best. Victor's combat algorithms determined the proper course of action. Benny and his thugs were more than a match for a lone Securitron. When he alerted me, I instructed him to approach the site after Benny and the others had departed.\"\n\n(Robert House's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Courier: \"Tell me about Benny.\"\n\nRobert House: \"Benny has led the Chairmen ever since I recruited his tribe seven years ago. Until his recent misbehavior, I'd planned to make him my protege. Maybe if I'd begun grooming him sooner, none of this would've happened...\"\n\nThe Courier: \"What use would you have for a protege?\"\n\nRobert House: \"To achieve my aims, I require a capable human agent to perform certain... tasks. I knew Benny was ambitious, even ruthless. But I believed he would do the job, so long as he was incentivized appropriately. Obviously, I miscalculated his drive for supremacy. But in any case, you've come along - a more-than-suitable replacement.\"\n\n(Robert House's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Courier: \"What terms are you offering?\"\n\nRobert House: \"My only concern is the recovery of the Platinum Chip. What happens to Benny, I leave to your discretion. When you bring the Chip to me, I will pay you four times the delivery bonus stipulated in your contract. How's that?\"\n\n(Robert House's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Courier: \"I have a right to know more.\"\n\nRobert House: \"That's simply not true. I am the only person to hold any rights pertaining to the Chip. I designed it, and I paid for it - dearly. To develop that Chip, I spent a sum of U.S. dollars - not the bottle caps that pass as currency these days - but a sum beyond counting. For decades, I paid salvagers to comb the ruins for it. And when it was finally discovered, tens of thousands of caps spent to have it brought here. We know how that turned out. Complete your contract and it will be the last time I pay for the Chip. Save your questions for then.\"\n\n(Robert House's dialogue)\n\n↑ The House Always Wins\n\n↑ The Courier: \"In the meantime, you'd rule Vegas as some kind of dictator?\"\n\nRobert House: \"I prefer the term \"autocrat.\" I would rule as a chief executive. I would not answer to a board of directors or any other entity. Nothing to impede progress. If you want to see the fate of democracies, look out the windows.\"\n\n(Robert House's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Courier: \"Say you keep control of New Vegas. What happens next?\"\n\nRobert House: \"New Vegas is more than a city - it's the remedy to mankind's derailment. The city's economy is a blast furnace in which can be forged the steel of a new rail line, running straight to a new horizon. What is the NCR? A society of people desperate to experience comfort, ease, luxury... A society of customers. With all that money pouring in? Give me 20 years, and I'll reignite the high technology development sectors. 50 years, and I'll have people in orbit. 100 years, and my colony ships will be heading for the stars, to search for planets unpolluted by the wrath and folly of a bygone generation.\"\n\n(Robert House's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Courier: \"What's the deal with the snowglobe collection?\"\n\nRobert House: \"What of it? I enjoy them. There's something about a little diorama set inside a glass dome that I... find pleasing. If you run across any out in the wastes, turn them in to Jane. She'll compensate you.\"\n\n(Robert House's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Courier: \"I think I'm going to keep this for a little while.\"\n\nCachino: \"All right, all right. I can't stop you, but I think we can help each other out. I know Not-At-Home and the NCR would be happy to get some dirt on the Family. I can help you get that dirt, and you got me by the short hairs.\"\n\n(Cachino's dialogue)\n\n↑ Deacon: \"Let me try something. Override code. Gamma 3 Delta Tango Cinnamon.\"\n\nDeezer: \"Psst. Hey, mister. Do you want a cold delicious... lemonade?\"\n\nDeacon: \"Command override. Vocal audio House, Robert. 'Access core programming.'\"\n\nDeezer: \"You're really missing out. Enjoy a longer, healthier life with: Deezer's Lemonade.\"\n\nDeacon: \"Ah, too bad. I won those codes in a poker game once. Hasn't worked yet.\"\n\n(Deacon's and Deezer's dialogue)\n\n↑ RobCo Auto-Cache #001 terminal entries; System registration terminal\n\n↑ Brother Scarberry: \"An Elder once implied that the one behind RobCo was lacking in the soul.\"\n\n(Scarberry's dialogue)"
