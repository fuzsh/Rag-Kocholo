        "text": "Francis Angel Gonzales, 86, of Monongahela, a devoted family man and cherished friend, peacefully passed away Wednesday, April 24, 2024, at his home in Carroll Township, Pa. Francis, or “Sonny” as most knew him, was born on March 18, 1938, to the late Frank Gonzales and the late Helen Ziemba Gonzales. He was a proud member of the Donora High School graduating Class of 1955 where, according to his yearbook, he was, “as handsome as they come.” After graduating, he married his high school sweetheart, Marilyn, and began his 47-year career with Continental Airlines, first as an airplane mechanic and then a manager with maintenance control. Known at work as “Speedy,” he took pride in his work and held high expectations. His career took him across the country where he made many lifelong friends he came to consider family. Upon retiring, he returned home to the Mon Valley area, where he generously volunteered with St. Vincent DePaul Society, embodying his compassionate spirit and love for helping others. He was proud of his Spanish and Polish heritage and never missed an opportunity to indulge in its cuisine, often traveling to West Virginia for Spanish sausage that tasted just like his grandmother’s and dad’s or asking his daughter to make trays of empanadas he could share with his friends. He was generous in his giving and expected nothing in return. He was a devoted family man who loved spending time with his family and hanging out with the guys. He enjoyed the simple pleasures in life, including feeling the warmth of the sun on his face, sharing laughter with a good joke, scenic drives, live music and watching old westerns. He was a beloved husband, father, pappy, uncle and friend. In addition to his parents, Sonny was reunited with his wife, Marilyn Uram Gonzales; and granddaughter, Katy Chaney. Surviving to cherish his memory are his wife of 19 years, Sheila Gonzales; children, Michele Jones (Chris) of Tenn., Melissa Foust (Robert) of Texas, Nancy Gant (Jim) of Texas, and Col. John Gonzales (Nicole) of Germany; stepchildren, Eddie, Jimmy and Nikki; grandchildren, Mindi Duncan (Dave), Amy Mitchell (Adam), Kristina Jones, James Chaney, Emily Chaney, Gavin Caufman, Gabriella Gant, Madeleine Gonzales, Michael Gonzales, Anna Gonzales, Danielle Gonzales and Frances Gonzales; nine great-grandchildren; many step-grandchildren; two sisters, Alice Jester (Harry) and Diane Devine (Bill); along with many nieces, nephews, cousins and friends. Arrangements have been entrusted to ANTHONY L. MASSAFRA FUNERAL HOME AND CREMATION SERVICE INC., 40 Second St. Ext., Donora, PA 15033, 724-379-6900, where the family will receive friends from 2 to 5 p.m. Sunday, April 28, 2024. A funeral service will be conducted in the funeral home at 11 a.m. Monday, April 29, 2024, with Deacon Al Poroda officiating. Interment will follow at Mon Valley Memorial Park, Donora. In lieu of flowers, Sonny’s family suggests that memorial contributions in his name may be made to the St. Vincent de Paul Society Monessen, the American Cancer Society, St. Jude Children’s Hospital or a veterans’ organization of your choice.
