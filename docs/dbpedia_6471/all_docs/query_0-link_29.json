At the age of 11, he performed a soft-shoe routine with Bob Hope as part of Hope's USO tour.\n\nHe majored in English literature at the University of Pennsylvania and then studied law at Georgetown University Law Center. It was his career as a lawyer that brought him to Los Angeles when he accepted a position with the LA office of Chicago-based Baker & McKenzie. The international firm's Los Angeles office was closed soon after.

The movie about the ex-gay movement was distributed by Mythgarden, the production company formed by Gant, Allen, and Christopher Racster in 2004.\n\nIn 2009, Gant appeared in Personal Affairs, a BBC Three-produced drama set in London's financial sector.\n\nHe also appeared in the independent films Special Delivery, The Contract, Fits and Starts and Marie and Bruce.\n\nHe plays the role of the Famous Director in the 2012 feature film Joshua Tree, 1951: A Portrait of James Dean. In 2011, Gant made a cameo appearance in season 1, episode 8 of TV Land's Happily Divorced.\n\nIn 2015, Gant played Zor-El, the titular character's father in Supergirl.\n\nActivism\n\nGant supports such organizations as Services & Advocacy for GLBT Elders (SAGE) and Gay & Lesbian Elder Housing (GLEH).\n\nHe supported Hillary Clinton in her bid for the Democratic Party's Presidential nomination in 2008.\n\nTheatre\n\nWorking – The Iron Worker\n\nTaming of the Shrew (Uta Hagen's Acting Class DVD) – Petruchio\n\nLittle Shop of Horrors – The Dentist (et al.)\n\nGrease – Danny Zuko; Kenicke\n\nWhose Life is it Anyway? – John\n\nThe Mystery of Edwin Drood – Neville Landless / Victor Grinstead"
