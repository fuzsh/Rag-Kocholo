        "text": "Robert Gant(born Robert John Gonzalez) is an American actor best known for portraying Professor Ben Bruckner in Showtime's Queer as Folk.\n\nBiography[]\n\nGant was born in Tampa, Florida, where at an early age, he began acting in commercials in Florida and joined the Screen Actors Guild. He later attended both the University of Pennsylvania, where he majored in English literature, and at Georgetown, where he attended law school. During his time at Georgetown, he also explored his artistic passions, taking part in many theater productions and a Capella groups. After he graduated, he worked at the Los Angeles office of Baker & McKenzie. In a twist of fate, that office closed down, prompting Gant to switch careers and pursue acting full time. Since his transition to acting, he has appeared in numerous television series and movies, including My So-Called Life, Caroline in the City, Friends, Hawaii 5-0, The Young and the Restless, Queer as Folk, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, CSI: Miami, 13 Reasons Why, and Criminal Minds.\n\nOn Criminal Minds[]\n\nGant portrayed Warden Miles Tate, the head of Reagan Correctional Facility in Liberty, Texas, in the Season Ten episode Lockdown.\n\nFilmography[]\n\n13 Reasons Why - 6 episodes (2017-2020) - Todd Crimsen\n\nGood Trouble (2019) - Jim Hunter\n\nAll Rise (2019) - Daniel Fox\n\nWhy Women Kill - 2 episodes (2019) - Dale Clark / Dale\n\nWedding of Dreams (2018) - Noah Burns\n\nThe Fosters (2018) - Jim Hunter\n\nMilada (2017) - Bohuslav Hor√°k\n\nHawaii 5-0 (2017) - Thomas Straham\n\nA Million Happy Nows (2017) - Dr. Hansen\n\nThe Young and the Restless - 16 episodes (2013-17) - David Sherman\n\nAmerican Housewife (2016) - Tim Donahue\n\nSupergirl - 4 episodes (2015-16) - Zor-El\n\nThe Thinning (2016) - Vince Davi\n\nSummer of Burns (2016) - Noah Burns\n\nK.C.
