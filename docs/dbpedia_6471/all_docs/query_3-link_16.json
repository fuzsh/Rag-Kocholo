        "text": "For more than 35 years, Debbie Gibson has been a true pioneer and force in the entertainment industry. A singer, songwriter, producer, musician, actor, and entrepreneur, she embodies what it truly means to be an icon.\n\nA music prodigy, Gibson burst on the Billboard Pop Charts at the tender age of 16 with the self-penned “Only In My Dreams.” The “Original Pop Princess” quickly became the youngest artist ever to write, produce and perform a No. 1 hit song, “Foolish Beat,” on the Billboard Hot 100 and entered the Guinness Book of World Records. To date, she is still the youngest female to hold that record. Less than a year later, she did it again with her self-penned and produced hit “Lost in Your Eyes” making her to date the sole female artist to have written, produced and performed two No. 1 songs on the Billboard Hot 100. She also holds the title of the youngest artist to be awarded ASCAP Songwriter of the Year. Gibson has sold more than 16 million albums worldwide and released 11 studio albums and five compilations.\n\nOn January 10, 2020, “Girls Night Out” was digitally released. DJ Tracy Young’s #VegasVibe remix was the most added record and No. 1 breakout hit, soaring to No. 4 on the U.S. Billboard and U.K. Music Week charts. In fall of 2020, Gibson’s debut album Out of the Blue was reissued on blue vinyl as an exclusive to Barnes & Noble and skyrocketed to No. 1 in sales during its pre-order run.\n\n2021 was a busy year for Gibson. Her guest starring role in the musical episode of “Lucifer” debuted on Netflix. She took Vegas by storm with her pop soulmate in “Debbie Gibson & Joey McIntyre: Live from Las Vegas” mini residency at The Venetian® Resort Las Vegas. Gibson released a new duet of “Lost in Your Eyes,” featuring Joey McIntyre, as well as the DJ Tracy Young co-penned “One Step Closer,” with an exclusive remix by DJ John Michael debuting on the Debbie Gibson Peloton Ride, 45 minutes devoted to Debbie’s iconic music catalog. Her first pop album of original material in 20 years, The Body Remembers, came out on her own label Stargirl Records to rave reviews. The new album promptly shot up to No. 2 on the Apple Pop Sales Charts and achieved one million streams in its first month.\n\nIn 2022, Stargirl Records released “One Step Closer Remixes” reaching No. 3 on the Swiss dance charts and landed at No. 8 on the Commercial Pop MusicWeek chart in the UK. Gibson appeared on numerous national television shows, including CBS “Secret Celebrity Renovation,” and she showed off her musical chops while sitting in with The Roots on “The Tonight Show” starring Jimmy Fallon. She embarked on a U.S. solo tour of “The Body Remembers” and celebrated the 35th anniversary of her debut album “Out of the Blue” with three sold out shows in NYC followed by the release of her first-ever holiday album “Winterlicious” and tour of the same name.\n\nGibson’s 2023 found her frequently on national TV whether it was competing against Donny Osmond on Criss Angel’s “Magic With The Stars,” as the “Night Owl” on Fox’s hit show “The Masked Singer,” or raising money for charity, nearly 200k combined, on “Celebrity Name That Tune” and “Celebrity Wheel of Fortune.” She executive produced the highly acclaimed LGBTQ TV movie for Hallmark “Notes of Autumn.” The Body Remembers Encore Tour, rolled across the US while she dropped her new single and music video for “Love Don’t Care,” appeared on HSN’s Christmas in July special, and released “Love Don’t Care – The Remixes.” Gibson also announced a book deal with Gallery for her upcoming memoir.\n\nGibson shows no signs of slowing down. 2024 kicked off with an appearance on Fox’s “We Are Family.” She was honored with the Trailblazer Award from The Women’s International Music Network at the 12th Annual She Rocks Awards. She is celebrating the 35th Anniversary of her No. 1 hit “Lost In Your Eyes” and No. 1 album “Electric Youth” with a brand new “Electric Youth” Newstalgia Remix by Tracy Young and embarks on special anniversary shows. The celebration continues this fall across the country with “Acoustic Youth: Songs and Stories from the Electric Youth Era.”\n\nFrom No. 1 hits and platinum albums to starring roles on stage and screen, Gibson is a true force in the entertainment industry with timeless talent and charisma.\n\nGuinness Book of World Records for youngest artist ever to write, produce, and perform a number one single (“Foolish Beat”)\n\nYoungest female artist to solely write, produce and perform a Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit (“Foolish Beat,” June 1988) in the chart’s history\n\nOnly female artist to have solely written, produced and performed two No. 1 hits on Billboard Hot 100\n\nOne of four women to have solely-written multiple Hot 100 No. 1s (Diane Warren, 8; Gibson, Gloria Estefan and Dolly Parton, 2 each)\n\nMore than 16 million albums sold worldwide\n\nStarred in more than 15 national theater tours and regional productions\n\nPerformed for UK royalty and US Presidents\n\n“Foolish Beat” – #1 on Billboard Chart – 1988\n\nHeadlined San Remo Music Festival – 1988\n\nHeadlined Atlantic Record’s 40th Anniversary at Madison Square Gardens with Led Zeppelin and The Who – 1988\n\nASCAP Songwriter of the Year (youngest artist ever at 18) – 1989\n\nDebut Album of the Year – “Out of the Blue” – New York Music Awards – 1989\n\nDebut Artist of the Year – New York Music Awards – 1989\n\nHeadlined Prince’s Trust – 1989\n\n“Lost In Your Eyes” #1 on Billboard Chart – 1989\n\n“Electric Youth” album #1 on Billboard Chart – 1989\n\nCo-host of the American Music Awards – 1989\n\nRock Producer of the Year – American Songwriter Awards – 1990\n\nArtist of the Year – New York Music Awards – 1990\n\nSong of the Year – “Lost In Your Eyes” – New York Music Awards – 1990\n\nBest Pop Female Vocalist – New York Music Awards – 1990\n\nNominated Favorite Female Music Performer – People’s Choice Awards – 1990\n\nNominated Best Pop Female Vocalist – American Music Awards – 1990\n\nStarred on Broadway in “Les Miserables” as Eponine – 1992\n\nLondon’s West End Production of “Grease” as Sandy (9 months Sold Out/SRO) – 1993\n\nMacy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade – 1997\n\nStarred on Broadway in Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” as Belle -1997/98\n\nStarred in National Production of Cinderella – 2001\n\nJudge on American Juniors – 2003\n\nBroadway revival of “Cabaret” as Sally Bowles (dir:Rob MArshall/Sam Mendes co-starring Neil Patrick Harris) – 2003\n\nPartnered with Kurt Browning on Skating with Celebrities – 2006\n\n“Pop Goes Broadway” at The Concert Venue at Harrah’s – 2008\n\nFounded “Debbie Gibson’s Electric Youth” – 2008\n\nFounded “Gibson Girl Foundation” – 2009\n\nStarred in “Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus” – 2009\n\n“I Love You” #1 on Billboard Japan Chart – 2010\n\nChildren International spokesperson – 2010\n\nGuest Starred in “Cirque Dreams Jungle Fantasy” at MGM/Foxwoods – 2010\n\nCo-Starred in “Mega Python vs. Gatoroid” – 2011\n\nGood Morning America’s Summer Concert Series – 2011\n\nAppeared in Katy Perry’s music video for “Last Friday Night (TGIF)” – 2011\n\nCameo in film “Rock of Ages” – 2012\n\nCompeted in season 5 of “Celebrity Apprentice” (raised more than $50,000 for Children International) – 2012\n\nCelebrity Ambassador for Hooplaha.com – 2012\n\nNational Cherry Blossom Parade – 2012\n\nNBA New York Knicks Half Time Show – 2013\n\nThe 94th Annual 6ABC Dunkin’ Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade – 2013\n\nCo-Headlined “Hit Parade” in Santiago, Chile – 2014\n\n“Mega Shark vs. Mecha Shark” – 2014\n\nCelebrity Judge on ABC’s “Sing Your Face Off” – 2014\n\nLong Island Music Hall of Fame Induction – 2014\n\nThe Spirit of Christmas Concert – 2014\n\nStarred in “The Music In Me” on UPtv – 2015\n\n“I Want My 80s Concert” at The Theatre at Madison Square Garden – 2015\n\nLifetime Achievement Award, Rockers on Broadway – 2015\n\nCelebrity Name Game – 2016\n\nFox & Friends All-American Concert Series – 2016\n\nStarred in Hallmark Channel’s “Summer of Dreams” – 2016\n\nHeadlined Here and Now The Very Best of the 80s – 2016\n\nHeadlined Absolute 80’s Weekender – 2016\n\nOprah: Where Are They Now?
