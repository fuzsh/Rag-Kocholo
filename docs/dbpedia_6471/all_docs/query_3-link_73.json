        "text": "1 O worship the King all-glorious above,\n\nO gratefully sing his power and his love:\n\nour shield and defender, the Ancient of Days,\n\npavilioned in splendor and girded with praise.\n\n2 O tell of his might and sing of his grace,\n\nwhose robe is the light, whose canopy space.\n\nHis chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,\n\nand dark is his path on the wings of the storm.\n\n3 Your bountiful care, what tongue can recite?\n\nIt breathes in the air, it shines in the light;\n\nit streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,\n\nand sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.\n\n4 Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,\n\nin you do we trust, nor find you to fail.\n\nYour mercies, how tender, how firm to the end,\n\nour Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!\n\n5 O measureless Might, unchangeable Love,\n\nwhom angels delight to worship above!\n\nYour ransomed creation, with glory ablaze,\n\nin true adoration shall sing to your praise!\n\nPsalter Hymnal, (Gray)\n\n“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” These may be some of the best-known words in the Bible, but in 1835, Robert Grant wrote a text that helps us see the creation story in a new light. His meditation on the creation theme of Psalm 104 consists of six verses that parallel the six days of creation. But rather than simply paraphrase the psalm or the first two books of the Bible, Grant focuses on how creation is a testimony to God’s “measureless might.” And Grant’s beautiful text doesn’t stop at Genesis Two. Rather, in the fourth and fifth verse we celebrate God’s saving grace to his creation. When God took that seventh day of rest, he was not signaling an end. He continued to bless His creation, even those as feeble and frail as us. In the last verse, Grant points to Christ as the ultimate reconciler of a broken, but still beautiful creation. An original last stanza that we no longer sing reads, “The humbler creation, though feeble their lays, with true adoration shall lisp to Thy praise.”\n\nText:\n\nGrant’s text is a resetting of William Kethe’s rendering of Psalm 104 first published in 1561. Albert Bailey wrote of this text: “It is no small accomplishment to combine, as this hymn does, the majestic, the tender, and a smooth-flowing poetical rendering” (Gospel in Hymns, 182). The text has not been changed much from Grant’s original. Some verses are not included in all hymnals – unlike most hymnals, the Psalter Hymnal leaves out the original third stanza, which reads, “The earth with its store of wonders untold, Almighty, thy power hath founded of old; hath ‘stablished it fast by a changeless decree, and round it hath cast, like a mantle, the sea.” The Psalter Hymnal does, however, include a verse many hymnals leave out, beginning “O measureless Might.”\n\nTune:\n\nThe most common tune for Grant’s text is LYONS. For most of the tune’s existence, its composition was attributed to either of the Haydn brothers. In 2000, Margaret K. Dismore discovered that the tune was actually composed by Joseph Martin Kraus, a German composer who was probably in London, along with Haydn, when Kraus’ sonata was premiered, the first line of which became the theme of this hymn tune. Hymn tune analyst Paul Westermeyer describes this tune as an example of a popular instrumental melody broken into a “congregational idiom,” and done quite well (Let the People Sing, 204).\n\nA second tune that is often put to Grant’s text is HANOVER. This tune also had a mix-up over who actually composed it. For many years it was attributed to Handel, but is now generally ascribed to William Croft. Both of these tunes are excellent. HANOVER is spritely, but does jump around a bit melodically, while LYONS tends to have steadier climbs and natural progressions, and might be more comfortable for congregations, unless you’ve been singing HANOVER for a long time already. If you’re looking for an arrangement for worship band, Chris Tomlin has a version with an easily adaptable riff for violin or electric guitar, and a great original chorus.\n\nAlternative Harmonizations:\n\n1.

The Creative Use of the Piano in Worship.\n\nWhen/Why/How:\n\n“O Worship the King” is most often used as a hymn of gathering and a call to worship. It can be used any time during the liturgical calendar, but it would be especially fitting on Christ the King Sunday, the last Sunday before Advent. It could be paired well with the contemporary song “He Reigns” and the great hymn, “All Creatures of Our God and King.”\n\nSuggested Choral arrangements:\n\nShackley, Larry. Lord Most High with O Worship The King\n\nPowell, Robert J. Oh, Worship the King, setting of HANOVER for choir, congregation , organ and timpani\n\nLaura de Jong, Hymnary.org"
