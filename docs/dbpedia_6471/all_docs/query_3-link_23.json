        "text": "Hugh Bonneville stars in the second episode of Douglas is Cancelled tonight (July 4) – just months after confirming his break-up from his wife of 25 years.\n\nThe actor has since moved on to a new girlfriend – and has reportedly already introduced her to Queen Camilla.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Douglas is Cancelled star Hugh‘s career, love life and weight loss.\n\nWho is Hugh Bonneville?\n\nHugh Bonneville is an English actor, best known for portraying the Earl of Grantham Robert Crawley in ITV hit Downton Abbey.\n\nBorn in Paddington, London, on November 10 1963, Hugh is currently 60 years old. Although his birth name is Hugh Williams, he chose the stage name Bonneville to avoid confusion with the playwright.\n\nHugh studied at Dulwich College Preparatory School and Sherborne School, before reading theology at Cambridge University.\n\nHis acting education includes the National Youth Theatre and London’s Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art.\n\nWho did he play in Notting Hill?\n\nDownton Abbey was far from the start of Hugh’s long acting career. In 1999, aged 35, Hugh starred in the romantic comedy Notting Hill.\n\nThe film famously starred Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant as a popular actress and a London bookstore owner who fall in love.\n\nHugh portrayed the bumbling Bernie, the best friend of Hugh Grant’s leading man William.\n\nWhat other movies and TV shows has Hugh Bonneville been in?\n\nAs well as Downton Abbey and Notting Hill, Hugh has quite the resumé!\n\nHugh’s film debut came in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1994), where he starred alongside Robert De Niro and Kenneth Branagh. He later had roles in the aforementioned Notting Hill and Jane Austen adaptation Mansfield Park (1999).\n\nIn 2001, Hugh received a BAFTA nomination for his role in Iris (2001), a biopic about Iris Murdoch. He portrayed the young John Bayley, the husband of the titular novelist. The film was a big hit with critics, and star Jim Broadbent (who played the older Bayley) picked up an Oscar for his role.\n\nAfter Iris, Hugh moved into television with roles in BBC One drama Daniel Deronda (2002) and ITV’s The Commander (2003).\n\nAlong came Downton Abbey, and the role of Robert Crawley, in 2010. Hugh starred in all six series of the drama, and its two sequel films. In May 2024, he revealed he’d started filming a third.\n\nSince 2010, Hugh’s career has gone from strength to strength. Notably, he played Henry Brown in the Paddington franchise. Henry is the initially-disapproving father of the family who take in the titular Peruvian bear. The latest film in the series, Paddington in Peru, will premiere later this year.\n\nHe also played Head of the Olympic Deliverance Commission Ian Fletcher in BBC mockumentary Twenty Twelve from 2011-2012. A spin-off titled W1A arrived after the Olympics ended, which ran for three seasons from 2014.\n\nRecently, Hugh starred in BBC One crime drama The Gold (2023), and AppleTV+ comedy The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin (2024).\n\nAnd, of course, he plays Douglas in new ITV drama Douglas is Cancelled.\n\nIs Hugh Bonneville married?\n\nHugh married Lucinda “Lulu” Williams in 1998. The pair, who first met as teenagers, reunited in their thirties with the help of Hugh’s mother Patricia. They share a son, Felix, together.\n\nHugh previously told the Radio Times that Lulu was “a bedrock for Felix and me and I’m completely indebted to her”.\n\nIn 2018, they renewed their vows in Las Vegas after 20 years together. However, Hugh’s spokesperson confirmed he had split from Lulu in September 2023.\n\nA source later told the Sun that the split was not amicable: “It’s clear that Lulu feels as if 20-odd years of marriage counts for nothing.”\n\nWho is Hugh Bonneville’s new girlfriend?\n\nHugh was pictured earlier this year with new girlfriend Claire Rankin, 53.\n\nClaire is a Canadian actress who currently stars in the Canadian comedy series Son of a Critch.\n\nShe also played the recurring role of Kate Heightmeyer in sci-fi Stargate Atlantis (2005-2007).\n\nClaire married American actor Josh Randall in 2000 before divorcing in 2013. Josh is a series regular on Grey’s Anatomy spin-off Station 19.\n\nHugh and Claire have been spotted on various dates in London and seem to be smitten with one another. The Sun reported that Hugh even took Claire to Buckingham Palace for an event hosted by Queen Camilla in February 2024.\n\nAre Hugh Bonneville and John Bishop friends?\n\nHugh is indeed friends with the comedian John Bishop. The pair shared a chance encounter at a Covid vaccine centre and became firm friends during lockdown.\n\nThey cemented their friendship with a shocking discovery on ITV genealogy show DNA Journey in 2023. Despite their seemingly very different backgrounds – Hugh a privately educated London-born actor and John a working class comic from Liverpool – the pair shared an unlikely connection.\n\nIt turned out their ancestors lived just four doors from each other in Dublin, Ireland. Both were trade unionists, and so probably marched the streets of Dublin together in support of workers’ rights.\n\nHow did Hugh Bonneville lose weight?\n\nOver his decades in the spotlight, Hugh has undergone some impressive weight loss transformations.\n\nWhile he’s never given a detailed account of his diet and fitness regime, Hugh did tell the Telegraph in 2009 that he exercises “little and often”. He also said he cuts carbs in the evenings.\n\nHugh sometimes posts pics of his work outs on his Instagram, where he’s revealed he enjoys running and regular dog walks.\n\nHow tall is Hugh Bonneville in feet?\n\nIt’s difficult to miss the fact that Hugh is quite tall. In fact, he’s 6ft 2in, or 1.87m.\n\nHis Douglas is Cancelled co-star Karen Gillan won’t be dwarfed by him, however. As a former model, Karen is only 3in shorter at 5ft 11in (1.8m).\n\nWhat is his net worth?\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Hugh is worth a whopping £6.3 million.\n\nThis figure only looks set to rise, with new Downton Abbey and Paddington films in the works.\n\nDouglas is Cancelled on ITV1\n\nHugh stars as a beloved newsreader Douglas Bellowes in the new comedy-drama. When Douglas is overheard making a sexist joke at a wedding, he becomes the victim of an internet mob.\n\nWith his employers and loved ones asking uncomfortable questions, will Douglas’ career survive? And how will his family cope with the scrutiny?\n\nRead more: Douglas is Cancelled: ITV1 cancel culture comedy-drama starring Hugh Bonneville confirms start date\n\nDouglas is Cancelled airs on ITV1 and ITV tonight (July 4) at 9pm."
