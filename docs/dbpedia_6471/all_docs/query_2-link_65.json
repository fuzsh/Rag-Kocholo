        "text": "A Rich Tradition\n\nBaruch College is part of a tradition that dates to the founding, in 1847, of the Free Academy, the first free public institution of higher education in the nation. Baruch’s landmark building at 23rd Street and Lexington Avenue occupies the site of the Free Academy. Established in 1919 as City College’s School of Business and Civic Administration, the school was renamed in 1953 in honor of Bernard M. Baruch—statesman, financier, and devoted alumnus. In 1968 the school became an independent senior college in The City University of New York (CUNY) system.\n\nThe College sustains the Free Academy and the City University’s original mission by providing access to educational opportunities for a diverse student body. Today, as a thriving, urban, multicultural institution, Baruch attracts motivated, accomplished students committed to achieving their dreams. Baruch has established a national and international reputation for academic excellence, and its graduates are recognized for their ability and drive. It succeeds in developing talented professionals that keep New York City vibrant and thriving in a constantly changing global economy.\n\nBaruch offers undergraduate and graduate programs of study through its three schools: the Zicklin School of Business, the largest and one of the most respected business schools in the nation; the Mildred and George Weissman School of Arts and Sciences; and the Austin W. Marxe School of Public and International Affairs. The College also offers non-degree and certificate programs through its Division of Continuing and Professional Studies.\n\nLocation\n\nSituated on Lexington Avenue near the Flatiron and Gramercy Park districts of Manhattan, Baruch College is in the heart of one of the world’s most dynamic financial and cultural centers. The College is within easy reach of Wall Street, Midtown, the United Nations, and the global headquarters of major companies and organizations. This “real-world classroom” adds immeasurably to the value of a Baruch education and offers unparalleled internship, career, and networking opportunities. Some of the nation’s top executives are Baruch alumni, and many of them regularly come to campus to share their expertise with current students.\n\nStudents\n\nBaruch students come from 155 nations, reflecting the diversity of New York City. This mixture of people and life experiences creates a rich social and academic environment that enhances our students’ learning and prepares them for a global marketplace. Total enrollment is over 19,700, including nearly 4,000 graduate students.\n\nFaculty and Staff\n\nBaruch faculty are among the most distinguished and most widely known in their fields. They combine outstanding academic credentials with significant real-world experience. Full-time faculty teach both entry-level and advanced courses and serve as advisors to student organizations and pre-professional programs. Adjunct faculty are typically drawn from New York City’s business and professional ranks. Baruch employs another 700 administrative and support personnel. Faculty members are regularly recognized with fellowships, grants, and awards from many notable foundations and public agencies.\n\nMembers of the faculty throughout the college are recognized for significant scholarly achievements at Baruch’s annual faculty convocation, which celebrates scholarly and creative achievements, including books, edited collections, and articles in top-tier journals, as well as major grants received, exhibitions, and performances.\n\nAcademic Programs\n\nBaruch College offers 29 undergraduate majors, 60 undergraduate minors, and 56 graduate-level specializations/programs through its three schools. The College confers the BBA, BA, BS, and BSPA degrees at the undergraduate level, and the MBA, MS, MPA, MIA, MSEd, MA, Executive MBA and MS, and Executive MPA at the graduate level. The College also houses the City University’s PhD in business and in industrial/organizational psychology and offers joint programs leading to the JD/MBA in conjunction with Brooklyn Law School.\n\nSchools\n\nThe Zicklin School of Business is the largest collegiate school of business in the nation and the only CUNY school that offers business programs accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, representing the highest worldwide standard of achievement for business schools.\n\nThe George and Mildred Weissman School of Arts and Sciences provides a broad-based arts and sciences education to all Baruch undergraduates, who are required to complete an arts and sciences minor to earn a bachelor’s degree. Weissman also offers undergraduate degree programs in more than 50 areas of study that blend rigorous theory with practical experience.\n\nThe Austin W. Marxe School of Public and International Affairs is widely recognized for its teaching, research, and service in the areas of municipal government, nonprofit administration, policy analysis, and evaluation, health care policy, and educational administration.\n\nNewman Vertical Campus\n\nBaruch’s 17-floor Newman Vertical Campus serves as the hub of the College. Covering nearly an entire square block between Lexington and Third Avenues, and 24th and 25th Streets, the 800,000 square-foot structure houses high-technology classrooms and research facilities; faculty and administrative offices; executive conference facilities; a three-level athletics and recreation complex; an expanded student activities center; the Baruch Performing Arts Complex, which comprises the Rose Nagelberg Theatre and Engelman Recital Hall; a 500-seat auditorium; a television studio; and a campus bookstore with a coffee shop. The Newman Vertical Campus has been honored by the American Institute of Architects with the highest award it offers to an individual building.\n\nInformation and Technology Building\n\nThe 1,450-seat, 330,000 square-foot William and Anita Newman Library, housed in the Information and Technology Building, directly opposite the new Newman Vertical Campus, provides the Baruch community with access to several hundred online databases and information resources in print and electronic formats. Users have access seven days a week to the library’s on-site computing facilities, as well as remote access to thousands of full-text journals, newspapers, and books. Librarians are available to answer questions 24/7 via a text chat. In 2003, the library won the prestigious Excellence in Academic Libraries Award for best college library in the nation from the Association of College and Research Libraries. The Baruch Computing and Technology Center, also located in the Information and Technology Building, is the largest student computing center in New York City. It provides computer access to 250 students at a time.\n\nCenters and Institutes\n\nBaruch is home to numerous centers and institutes that support our students’ educational and professional goals, faculty scholarship, and research in such key areas as business, finance, the global economy, public policy, social equity, and real estate and metropolitan development. Included among them are:\n\nBaruch College Survey Research\n\nBaruch Performing Arts Center (BPAC)\n\nBernard L. Schwartz Communication Institute\n\nCenter for Educational Leadership\n\nCenter for Nonprofit Strategy and Management\n\nCenter for Teaching and Learning\n\nCUNY Institute for Demographic Research\n\nGraduate Career Management Center\n\nInternational Student Service Center\n\nLawrence N.

The center reaches out to the arts community, serving as a venue for new projects and classic works and as a partner in their creation and development. Plays, concerts, dance, readings, and other events are scheduled throughout the year. Within BPAC is the Rose Nagelberg Theatre, an innovative, modern black-box theatre with flexible seating; the Engelman Recital Hall, a 175-seat, world-class classical recital hall; rehearsal spaces; and a full theatrical workshop.\n\nThe Sidney Harman Writer-in-Residence Program\n\nThe Sidney Harman Writer-in-Residence Program brings notable literary figures to campus who teach master classes and offer special readings. Recent participants have included Tony Kushner, Jane Kramer, Lorrie Moore, Edward Albee, Agha Shahid Ali, John Edgar Wideman, Paul Auster, Philip Gourevitch, Anita Desai, Colum McCann, Ben Katchor, William Finnegan, Francisco Goldman, and Carol Muske-Dukes.\n\nThe Sidney Mishkin Gallery\n\nThe Sidney Mishkin Gallery mounts regular, critically acclaimed art exhibitions.\n\nThe Alexander String Quartet\n\nThe Alexander String Quartet, the first American quartet to win the London International String Quartet Competition, is in residence each semester, giving performances and visiting classes.\n\nThe Milt Hinton Jazz Perspectives Concert Series\n\nNamed for the late Milt Hinton, renowned jazz bassist, and Baruch faculty member, this concert series brings world-class jazz artists to Baruch for free performances each year. Past performers have included Ruth Brown, Billy Taylor, Slide Hampton, Jerry Gonzalez, and The Fort Apache Band, and the Mingus Big Band.\n\nAlumni\n\nTo a degree unusual among public academic institutions, Baruch College is strongly supported by its active alumni who are helping to transform the future of the College. Their commitment helps the College’s mission as a catalyst for social mobility, providing an outstanding education at an excellent value to many students who have historically been under-represented in higher education. Many Baruch alumni are modern-day captains of industry, leading major national and international firms. Some have returned to their alma mater to teach courses; others provide internships and employment opportunities for Baruch students.\n\nBeginning with Bernard M. Baruch’s gift of $9 million in 1965, the College has flourished through the generosity of its many friends. In addition to strong support from the Field, Newman, Weissman, Marxe, and Zicklin families, gifts from a score of other alumni have allowed Baruch to create and enhance such programs and facilities as the Bert W. and Sandra Wasserman Trading Floor/Subotnick Financial Services Center, the Stan Ross Department of Accountancy, the Bernard L. Schwartz Communication Institute, and the Max Berger Pre-Law Program. Other alumni-financed enhancements to the education Baruch provides include the Sidney Mishkin Gallery, Rosalyn and Irwin Engelman Recital Hall, Arline Nagelberg Theatre, Joel Cohen Career Services Initiative, and Sidney Harman Writer-in-Residence Program.\n\nAlumni have also been extraordinarily generous to The Baruch College Fund, which supplements Baruch’s annual operating budget that is derived from tuition and state revenues. The fund is used to recruit extraordinary faculty and support research, and offer services and financial aid to talented students of limited means."
