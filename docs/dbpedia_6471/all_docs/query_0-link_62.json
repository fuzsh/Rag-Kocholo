        "text": "From 2002 to 2005, Gant portrayed Professor Ben Bruckner in Showtime's television series Queer as Folk. His character was married in the first legal gay marriage portrayed on American television.\n\nIn 2004, Gant starred in the short film Billy's Dad is a Fudgepacker, an homage to 1950s educational films, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2005, Gant was a series regular in the BBC 3-produced drama Personal Affairs, set in London's financial sector and filmed on location in both London and Scotland. Gant was the sole American in an otherwise all-British cast.\n\nGant was a producing partner in the production company Mythgarden. Its 2007 feature film Save Me, a drama set against the backdrop of an ex-gay ministry, stars Gant along with Judith Light and Chad Allen and premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. He also co-produced, co-wrote, and starred in the Netflix-distributed period drama Milada, the true story of Czech politician Milada Horáková, who was executed by the Communist government in 1950.\n\nGant portrayed television's first gay spy in the film, Kiss Me Deadly, which was shot on location in New Zealand. Gant has portrayed Melissa Benoist's Kryptonian father Zor-El on Supergirl, Todd Crimsen on the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why, and Jim Hunter on The Fosters and its spin-off series Good Trouble. Prior to Queer as Folk, Gant recurred as Principal Calvin Krupps in Ryan Murphy's first television series, Popular, and a recurring role as Caroline's boyfriend Trevor in Caroline in the City."
