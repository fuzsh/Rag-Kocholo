Her dissertation documented and evaluated the effectiveness of a culture-neutral instructional design model used by the World Health Organization to design materials for blood safety training across multiple countries.\n\nShe has published a textbook on Therapeutic Exercise Prescription, with multiple international and national presentations and peer-reviewed publications related to management of musculoskeletal diagnoses. She currently teaches musculoskeletal and health promotion courses and coordinates the interprofessional and community engagement activities for the University of Florida Department of Physical Therapy.\n\nEmily Fox, PT, DPT, MHS, PhD is an Associate Professor in the Department of Physical Therapy and Director of Neuromuscular Research at Brooks Rehabilitation. She also directs the Brooks Motion Analysis Center, a clinical and research assessment facility. She is the Director of the Brooks-PHHP Research Collaboration, an established collaboration between Brooks Rehabilitation and the UF College of Public Health and Health Professions. In this role, she brings strategic leadership to to grow rehabilitation research and enhance the missions of Brooks and PHHP.\n\nDr. Fox’s research is focused on control and recovery following neurologic injury and disease. Her objective is to apply intrinsic neural and biomechanical control principles to enhance rehabilitation and promote recovery. As a physical therapist and researcher, she has extensive experience working with individuals with stroke, spinal cord injury, and older adults. Her research represents an interdisciplinary, translational approach to investigate mechanisms underlying motor control and the use of activity-based interventions to restore function.\n\nThe specific objectives of her research are to: 1) identify mechanisms associated with motor function and recovery, 2) develop innovative approaches to enhance walking control and recovery, including community ambulation, 3) investigate novel approaches to enhance the delivery and effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions and 4) advance strategies to enhance respiratory recovery after spinal cord injury. Dr. Fox’s current funded projects investigate therapeutic approaches such as transcutaneous electrical stimulation and acute intermittent hypoxia to enhance neuromuscular plasticity and recovery.\n\nDr. Gonzalez-Rothi is a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Physical Therapy and an investigator in the Breathing Research and Therapeutics Center and the McKnight Brain Institute at the University of Florida. She directs the Neuroscience course in the Doctor of Physical Therapy curriculum. The fundamental objective of Dr. Gonzalez-Rothi’s research program is the development of effective therapies to treat respiratory and motor deficits following incomplete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). Her work aims to advance our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying plasticity within neural networks, particularly as it applies to breathing and upper extremity motor function. Her current research portfolio focuses on therapies designed to harness endogenous neuroplasticity, including traditional rehabilitation approaches and mild intermittent hypoxia. She is also investigating the impact of high-dose, chronic intermittent hypoxia, similar to that experienced by individuals with sleep disordered breathing, on expression of respiratory motor plasticity and recovery of breathing after chronic cervical spinal cord injury. Dr. Gonzalez-Rothi has expertise in characterizing anatomical substrates of defined neural circuits including identification and characterization of interneurons contributing to both respiratory and upper limb motor function. In addition, she has extensive experience with experimental models of spinal cord injury, characterizing the extent and time course of anatomical, physiological, and functional plasticity that occurs both spontaneously and induced via therapeutic intervention. She is uniquely suited to conduct basic science research in the field of spinal cord injury, as her clinical background as a physical therapist working with individuals with acute SCI in a neurologic ICU setting has shaped her research portfolio and enabled her to bring a unique perspective to her pre-clinical work.\n\nDr. Sarah Judge has 17 years of research experience investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive skeletal muscle wasting and impaired regeneration in the context of inactivity and disease. She has published more than 35 original research articles in this area, 10 as first-author, and 5 as corresponding/co-corresponding author. Over the past 10 years, Dr. Judge’s research has largely centered on better understanding mechanisms of cancer-induced muscle wasting/catabolism, which is a defining feature of the wasting syndrome known as cachexia. Cachexia is a complex metabolic disorder thought to be driven by both central and peripheral impacts of systemic inflammation induced by the presence of cancerous cells, but is common to other conditions and chronic diseases associated with systemic inflammation, including sepsis and chronic kidney disease. In patients with cancer, the loss of lean muscle mass associated with cachexia decreases patient quality of life, reduces tolerance to cancer treatments and is predictive of poor survival. Despite this, there is no US FDA-approved pharmacological agent to treat cachexia, highlighting a critical need to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving cachexia. Dr. Judge is Principal Investigator on an active R01 award from the NIH/National Cancer Institute looking at mechanisms of cachexia induced by pancreatic cancer, and also serves as co-PI on an NIH Small Business Grant investigating novel therapeutic targets to treat cachexia induced by multiple cancer types.\n\nDr. Mitchell joined the University of Florida in 2015 as a Preeminence Professor of Neuroscience in the Department of Physical Therapy and McKnight Brain Institute. He founded and directs the UF Center for Breathing Research and Therapeutics (BREATHE) and the NIH-funded graduate and postdoctoral training program of the same name. A major focus of BREATHE is to understand and treat impaired breathing and airway defense (swallowing/cough) caused by neuromuscular injury or disease. Dr. Mitchell also serves as Deputy Director of the UF McKnight Brain Institute. For the past three decades, Dr. Mitchell pioneered studies of neuroplasticity in the neural system controlling breathing. Areas of active investigation include: intracellular and intercellular mechanisms of long-lasting respiratory motor plasticity triggered by repeated exposure to brief episodes of low oxygen (intermittent hypoxia), the ability to harness that intermittent hypoxia-induced spinal plasticity to treat respiratory and non-respiratory paralysis following spinal injury and during motor neuron disease (ALS), cell-based strategies to treat breathing deficits, and the impact of systemic inflammation on breathing and its control. Investigations span intracellular, intercellular and physiological systems level mechanisms, and translation to humans with acquired or neurodegenerative neurological disorders (SCI and ALS). Dr. Mitchell grew up in California where he received his B.S. (Biological Sciences) and PhD (Developmental and Cell Biology) degrees from the University of California at Irvine. After two years of post-doctoral training at the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine in Goettingen, Germany, he moved to the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After one year as a postdoc, Dr. Mitchell became an Assistant Professor in 1981, and then the ranks to become Professor and Chair of the Department of Comparative Biosciences (17 years) and director of the NIH funded Respiratory Neurobiology Training Program (14 years). He chose to leave the University of Wisconsin for the opportunity to join the University of Florida and create the BREATHE Center. Dr. Mitchell has been recognized for his research and teaching accomplishments, including a National Institutes of Health MERIT Award, the Norden Distinguished Teacher Award, the Pfizer Research Award on multiple occasions, the Steenbock Professorship for Behavioral and Neural Science, and distinguished lectureships from the Society for Neuroscience (SFN), American Physiological Society (APS), Association of Chairs of Departments of Physiology (ACDP), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA), and the Oxford Conference for Modeling and the Control of Breathing.\n\nRachelle Studer-Byrnes, PT, DPT,NCS received her Doctor of Physical Therapy from the University of St. Augustine in 2007. In 2012 she became an ABPTS Neurological Certified Specialist and achieved re-certification in 2022. She also served as the coordinator and mentor for three years for a neurological residency program. In 2020 she received the Clinical Excellence in Neurology, awarded by the Academy of Neurologic Physical Therapy, APTA. Her practice started in the inpatient rehabilitation setting with a focus of practice on the treatment of patients following stroke along with complex neurological, cardiac, and traumatic orthopedic injuries for seven years prior to transitioning to the acute care setting. She practiced in the acute care setting for six years in both the ICU and step-down units with a focus of practice on the acute management of patients post-stroke and those with neurodegenerative diseases and disorders while also practicing in the areas of cardiac, neurosurgical and post-traumatic injuries. She currently dedicates her services to the community outreach and pro-bono efforts of the Department of Physical Therapy. Her primary teaching role is within the neurological coursework and contributes to the acute care and therapeutic exercise content for the University of Florida Physical Therapy entry level doctoral curriculum. In her role on the clinical education team she enjoys providing mentorship and assistance to students as they navigate their transition into their clinical experiences, clinical curriculum and throughout the four curricular clinical experiences. Her current research interests are in the area of community wellness for those with neurologic diagnoses and clinical reasoning in entry-level physical therapy students."
