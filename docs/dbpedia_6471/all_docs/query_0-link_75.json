        "text": "William Clark Gable was born on February 1, 1901 in Cadiz, Ohio, to Adeline (Hershelman) and William Henry Gable, an oil-well driller. He was of German, Irish, and Swiss-German descent. When he was seven months old, his mother died, and his father sent him to live with his maternal aunt and uncle in Pennsylvania, where he stayed until he was two. His father then returned to take him back to Cadiz. At 16, he quit high school, went to work in an Akron, Ohio, tire factory, and decided to become an actor after seeing the play \"The Bird of Paradise\". He toured in stock companies, worked oil fields and sold ties. On December 13, 1924, he married Josephine Dillon, his acting coach and 15 years his senior. Around that time, they moved to Hollywood, so that Clark could concentrate on his acting career. In April 1930, they divorced and a year later, he married Maria Langham (a.k.a. Maria Franklin Gable), also about 17 years older than him.\n\nWhile Gable acted on stage, he became a lifelong friend of Lionel Barrymore. After several failed screen tests (for Barrymore and Darryl F. Zanuck), Gable was signed in 1930 by MGM's Irving Thalberg. He had a small part in Feindschaft (1931) which starred William Boyd. Joan Crawford asked for him as co-star in Irrwege des Lebens (1931) and the public loved him manhandling Norma Shearer in Der Mut zum Glück (1931) the same year. His unshaven lovemaking with bra-less Jean Harlow in Dschungel im Sturm (1932) made him MGM's most important star.\n\nHis acting career then flourished. At one point, he refused an assignment, and the studio punished him by loaning him out to (at the time) low-rent Columbia Pictures, which put him in Frank Capra's Es geschah in einer Nacht (1934), which won him an Academy Award for his performance. The next year saw a starring role in Goldfieber (1935) with Loretta Young, with whom he had an affair (resulting in the birth of a daughter, Judy Lewis). He returned to far more substantial roles at MGM, such as Fletcher Christian in Meuterei auf der Bounty (1935) and Rhett Butler in Vom Winde verweht (1939).\n\nAfter divorcing Maria Langham, in March 1939 Clark married Carole Lombard, but tragedy struck in January 1942 when the plane in which Carole and her mother were flying crashed into Table Rock Mountain, Nevada, killing them both. A grief-stricken Gable joined the US Army Air Force and was off the screen for three years, flying combat missions in Europe. When he returned the studio regarded his salary as excessive and did not renew his contract. He freelanced, but his films didn't do well at the box office. He married Sylvia Ashley, the widow of Douglas Fairbanks, in 1949. Unfortunately this marriage was short-lived and they divorced in 1952. In July 1955 he married a former sweetheart, Kathleen Williams Spreckles (a.k.a. Kay Williams) and became stepfather to her two children, Joan and Adolph (\"Bunker\") Spreckels III.\n\nOn November 16, 1959, Gable became a grandfather when Judy Lewis, his daughter with Loretta Young, gave birth to a daughter, Maria. In 1960, Gable's wife Kay discovered that she was expecting their first child. In early November 1960, he had just completed filming Misfits - Nicht gesellschaftsfähig (1961), when he suffered a heart attack, and died later that month, on November 16, 1960. Gable was buried shortly afterwards in the shrine that he had built for Carole Lombard and her mother when they died, at Forest Lawn Cemetery.\n\nIn March 1961, Kay Gable gave birth to a boy, whom she named John Clark Gable after his father.\n\nJim Gaffigan is a six-time Grammy nominated comedian, actor, writer, producer, two-time New York Times best-selling author, three-time Emmy winning top touring performer, and multi-platinum-selling recording artist. He is known around the world for his unique brand of humor, which largely revolves around his observations on life. A top ten earning comedian according to Forbes' 2019 comedy list, Jim recently released his 9th stand-up special, Comedy Monster, on Netflix. He was also recently awarded for being the first comedian to reach one billion streams on Pandora.\n\nUp next, Gaffigan will be seen as the lead in the Sci-Fi drama Linoleum, which will premiere at SXSW in 2022, and will star as Mr. Smee in Disney's Peter Pan and Wendy, opposite Jude Law's Captain Hook He was also recently heard in Disney/Pixar's highly anticipated film, Luca, opposite Jacob Tremblay and Maya Rudolph.\n\nOn the silver screen, his many credits include Three Kings, Super Troopers 1 & 2, and Chappaquiddick. 2019 was Gaffigan's biggest year to date with an astonishing eight films releasing, three which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival including Troop Zero with Viola Davis and Alison Janney, Them That Follow and Light From Light - with many festival goers and press calling Gaffigan the \"King of Sundance.\" Gaffigan also had two films recently in which he debuted as the lead. The comedic film Being Frank, and American Dreamer, a dark thriller which was the grand finale of 2019 for Jim and features him as a ride share driver who moonlights as a private driver for a drug dealer. Both films are now available for download. Gaffigan can also be seen opposite Ethan Hawke in IFC Films Tesla, as well as opposite Josh Hartnett in Saban Films Most Wanted.\n\nIn addition to two seasons of the critically acclaimed semi-autobiographical The Jim Gaffigan Show, which he wrote and produced with his wife Jeannie, and his widely popular stand-up comedy specials, Gaffigan has guest starred on many television comedies and dramas, ranging from Portlandia and Bob's Burgers to the HBO cult hits Flight of the Concords to dramatic roles in Law & Order. Gaffigan regularly does humorous commentaries on CBS Sunday Morning for which he has won 3 Emmys. In 2018 Jim served as master of ceremony at The Al Smith Memorial dinner. In 2015, Gaffigan had the great honor of performing for Pope Francis and over 1 million festival attendees at the Festival of Families in Philadelphia. Gaffigan starred on Broadway with Brian Cox, Kieffer Sutherland, Chris Noth and Jason Patric in That Championship Season.\n\nGaffigan and his wife currently live in Manhattan with their five loud and expensive children.\n\nKevin Franklin Gaede, who later changed his name to Kevin Gage, was born and raised in northern Wisconsin. He was physically active, working on his grandparents' dairy farm and excelling in school sports, including basketball, baseball, football, hockey, and track. He also enjoyed fishing and other outdoor activities.\n\nAfter graduating high school, Kevin headed to Florida to see the ocean. After a few months he turned his sights on California, planning to find work in construction, and landed in Hollywood. There Kevin worked for a security company, drove delivery trucks, and (still only 18 years old) went to bartending school and became a bartender. The job paid well. Life was good.\n\nWhen Kevin was 21, tending bar at a local steakhouse, he was approached by a theatrical agent, who had him read for a part and then recommended that he take an acting class. He became a regular in local plays and within a few years he was picking up small roles in films and television, including Highway to Heaven, Steele Justice, and High Mountain Rangers.\n\nIt was in acting class that he started seeing Kelly Preston. After a couple of years of dating, they were married in Hawaii in 1985. Kevin's first movie part was in Space Camp, where Preston had a leading role. Unfortunately his lines ended up on the cutting room floor. Two years later, the marriage fell apart and they went their separate ways. Kevin continued to find small acting roles, and in 1989 he appeared opposite Tom Hanks, Bruce Dern and Brother Theodore in The 'Burbs.\n\nKevin's first big role, and still one of his most memorable, was as \"Waingro\" in Heat, released in 1995. Competition for the role was tough, requiring twelve meetings over two months with casting director Bonnie Timmerman and director Michael Mann. Kevin was elated to be chosen, saying that he had dreamed for 13 years of being able to work with talent of Robert DeNiro's caliber.\n\nHis performance in Heat resulted in many offers, and Kevin continued to work in more A-list films, TV episodes, and lower budget films. He played opposite leading actors including Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen in G.I. Jane, Nicholas Cage in Con Air and Johnny Depp in Blow.\n\nKevin's career was temporarily derailed in 2002 after he and two partners set up a licensed business to grow and distribute medicinal marijuana. Though legal in California and encouraged by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors (who declared SF to be a medicinal marijuana-friendly city), the Federal government disagreed and arrested them. After serving two years of his 41-month sentence in a minimal security facility, Kevin was released early for good behavior in September 2005.\n\nKevin married Perris Knight on a Santa Barbara beach in the spring of 2006, and their son Ryder Jay Gage was born in January 2007. Sadly, Perris was diagnosed in late 2008 with inoperable brain cancer. Kevin's focus became caring for her and Ryder, with help from her parents. Perris passed away in July 2014.\n\nAs of 2020, Kevin lives with his teenage son in southern California and continues to complete several acting projects each year.\n\nJohn Mark Galecki was born in Bree, Belgium, to American parents; his father was stationed there while serving in the U.S. Air Force. When he was three years old, his family moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he grew up with his parents, Mary Lou and Richard Galecki, and siblings, sister Allison (1980) and brother Nick (1982). His father was of Polish descent, and his mother's ancestry is Irish and Italian. His mother was a mortgage consultant and his father became a teacher for blind veterans in a VA hospital outside of Chicago. When Galecki was sixteen, his father died in an accident.\n\nHis mother recalled in an interview with People magazine that Galecki was a very artistic kid; at only 4 years old, he told her: \"Mom, I'm gonna be on T.V., and I don't mean when I grow up.\" Two years later, when their attempts to distract him with sports failed, Galecki's parents took him to open auditions at local theaters in Chicago. He landed his first role in \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" and more parts in other productions followed. By age 11, he was already known as an excellent actor in Chicago's theater scene evidenced by him receiving a Joseph Jefferson Citation nomination for portraying John Henry in \"The Member of the Wedding.\"\n\nIn 1989 he was cast in his first movie, a holiday film called Jessica und das Rentier (1989), but his big break was in another Christmas movie as Chevy Chase's son Rusty Griswold, in Schöne Bescherung (1989). On the set, Chase took a liking to him, and Galecki recalled in a later interview that Chevy Chase showed him some tricks for comedic timing.\n\nBy that time, his whole family had moved from Chicago to L.A. to support his career. But within 10 months they realized they missed Chicago too much, and moved back home. Galecki, still just 14, was under contract on a show with Robert Urich called \"Mann der Träume (1990)\", so he stayed in L.A. Although he was living alone in a studio apartment, he never got into trouble and was a good kid. He recalled living alone in L.A. without adult supervision as \"not fun\" and \"quite intimidating and lonely, to be honest. But I've always been happiest when I'm working, so...\" He bought a motorcycle with a mirrored helmet so he could get to work and back, at Paramount studios.\n\nIn 1991 Galecki was picked by Roseanne Barr to play her son in the made for T.V. movie Die Mütter-Mannschaft (1991). She liked him so much she asked him to come on her sitcom for what started as a one-off appearance, but soon turned into the important recurring role of David Healy. His family was religious viewers of the show and he was somewhat intimidated at first to be working with his television heroes. However, before long, it was his heroes that praised him: Roseanne said he showed \"great vulnerability.\" John Goodman said: \"If he was one of those little stuffed bears at a carny, he'd have a Wuv me t-shirt on. People just want to take care of him.\" Galecki also became very close friends with co-star Sara Gilbert and the show's executive producer Eric Gilliland.\n\nAfter Roseanne (1988) he worked on a number of diverse roles, from funny Ira alongside Christopher Walken in the 1997 dark-comedy Suicide Kings (1997) to a drug-addicted student in 2003's Bookies (2003), and he played gay characters in Don Roos's Bounce - Eine Chance für die Liebe (2000) and The Opposite of Sex - Das Gegenteil von Sex (1998). He never stayed far from the television industry as he made guest appearances such as Laurie Freeman's younger lover in Norm (1999) (where he once again worked with Laurie Metcalf, his former Roseanne cast mate), as a golfer in My Name Is Earl (2005), as Hope & Faith (2003)'s younger brother in the sitcom of the same name, and as hilarious party-boy Trouty on My Boys (2006). In 2006 he returned to his theater roots as he took on the role of conflicted but sweet male escort Alex in Douglas Carter Beane's play \"The Little Dog Laughed,\" for which he received a 2007 Theatre World Award for Outstanding Browdway Debut.\n\nIn 2007 he was back on the small screens, starring as Leonard Hofstadter in the sitcom The Big Bang Theory (2007). Not only was Chuck Lorre, a former producer for Roseanne, a producer of the new show, but Sara Gilbert and Laurie Metcalf both made guest appearances.\n\nGalecki is a self-admitted motorcycle \"nerd,\" and rides a Harley Davidson Softail Deluxe. Although he never went to college, he has said: \"I'm not dead! We should never stop learning. We should never stop absorbing,\" and so he learned how to play the cello in his early twenties. He likes traveling around the world, painting, music (he also plays bass), and hiking with his dog Vera.\n\nHe always has been very private about his personal life and little is known about past relationships. It has only been confirmed that he dated actresses Laura Harris and Kaley Cuoco. He isn't on twitter, and Galecki once said, \"I don't understand the current frame of mind in our society that seems to say that any action is not of value until it's broadcast somehow.\"\n\nHe still lives in Los Angeles but is often spotted in Chicago, where his siblings still live.\n\nKyle Gallner was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania. He started his career by following his sister along to one of her auditions.\n\nPerhaps best know for his role as Cassidy \"Beaver\" Casablancas on the CW's lone hit series, Veronica Mars (2004), actor Kyle Gallner had been appearing in films and on television since his early adolescence. Born on Oct. 22, 1986 and originally from Philadelphia, PA, Gallner made his first screen appearance on an episode of Third Watch: Einsatz am Limit (1999). After making his feature debut with a small role in Michael Showalter's bizarre comedy Wet Hot American Summer (2001) (2001), he returned to television with episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999) and Ein Hauch von Himmel (1994). He next appeared in the series finale of The District - Einsatz in Washington (2000) before playing his first recognizable role - that of Bart Allen (a.k.a. \"The Flash\") on Smallville (2001) during the 2004-05 season.\n\nIn 2005, Gallner joined the cast of Veronica Mars (2004) for the last three episodes of the first season, giving him the opportunity to carry over his role of Beaver into the next season. During his run on \"Veronica Mars,\" Gallner continued making guest spots, appearing in episodes of Jack & Bobby (2004), Cold Case - Kein Opfer ist je vergessen (2003), CSI: New York (2004) and Bones: Die Knochenjägerin (2005). Gallner began a recurring role as a devout Mormon in the controversial HBO series Big Love (2006). Meanwhile, Gallner revived his \"Smallville\" role in early 2007, returning as Impulse rather than The Flash - due to a feature film with the same character being developed by Warner Bros.\n\nMade acting debut in an episode of NBC's Third Watch: Einsatz am Limit (1999).\n\nMade his film debut in the comedy cult film Wet Hot American Summer (2001).\n\nHad a recurring role as superhero Bart Allen in Smallville (2001) (The WB, 2001-2006; The CW, 2006-2009).\n\nAppeared in two episodes of The WB's Jack & Bobby (2004).\n\nJoined the cast of UPN s Veronica Mars as Cassidy Casablancas; became a regular during the show s second season.\n\nHad a recurring role as Reed Garrett, the son of Detective Taylor's (Gary Sinise) late wife on CSI: NY (CBS)\n\nPlayed Jason Embry, best friend of Ben Henrickson, on the critically-acclaimed HBO drama Big Love.\n\nFeatured in the independent film Sublime.\n\nAppeared in three episodes of The Shield (FX).\n\nHad a supporting role in the Diablo Cody penned dark comedy Jennifer's Body.\n\nPlayed the lead role in the horror film The Haunting in Connecticut.\n\nCast as the lead male, Quentin, in the remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street.\n\nGallner has in his filmography acclaimed Independents films as Gardens of the Night (2008), Beautiful Boy (2010), Red State (2011), Little Birds (2011), Magic Valley (2011) and Smashed (2011).\n\nIn 2013, Gallner appeared in the film Beautiful Creatures (2013)_, directed by Richard LaGravenese.\n\nVincent Gallo. American-born, Buffalo, New York, 1961. Left home, moved to New York City in 1978, and began playing in the experimental musical group, Gray, with artist Jean Michel Basquiat. After leaving Gray, he formed the band, Bohack, and recorded the highly regarded avant-garde industrial noise album, \"It Took Several Wives\".\n\nDuring the same period, Gallo also became known in New York City for his very unusual street performances, which were spontaneously executed in public and also witnessed by invited guests in the know. The One-Armed Man, The Man with No Face, Sandman, Boy Hit by a Car, and Boy Cries in Restaurant Window, to name a few. These radical public performances were upsetting and disturbing and were meant to provoke thought, self-reflection and consciousness. Gallo's invited guests could witness his performance's impact in this larger public context.\n\nOne invited guest, New York Underground filmmaker, Eric Mitchell, cast Gallo as the lead in his film, So wie es ist/Eurydice in den Avenuen (1985), alongside newcomer Steve Buscemi. So wie es ist/Eurydice in den Avenuen (1985) was Gallo's first appearance in a feature-length film, though previously he had directed himself in several short films, including If You Feel Froggy, Jump (1980), The Gunlover (1986) and Rocky 10, as well as the collaborations with filmmaker Michael Holman, Vincent Gallo as \"Jesus Christ\" (used in Julian Schnabel's Basquiat (1996)) and Vampire LeStat.\n\nSince his early performance art days, Gallo has continued to create very conceptual performance pieces. Examples are a series of protesting of protests. Gallo has also created his own website, which upon closer examination, is actually a highly conceptual artwork resonating with his early performance work.\n\nOn his website www.vincentgallo.com in the merchandise section, Gallo is selling his sperm and sexual fantasies as conceptual works. Gallo's Internet art questions celebrity, procreation, ego, social agenda, and views of religion, race and sexuality. These public offerings are motivated by extreme sensitivity, concept and thoughtfulness, however their presentation appears crude and offensive. Misinterpretation of this work is common and Gallo is often incorrectly categorized as a racist, sexist, homophobe.
