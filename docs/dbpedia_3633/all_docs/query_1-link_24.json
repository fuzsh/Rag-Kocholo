Check out our other articles for an in-depth guide on planning your trip.\n\nWeather in Mexico in January\n\nWeather in Mexico in February\n\nWeather in Mexico in March\n\nWeather in Mexico in April\n\nWeather in Mexico in May\n\nWeather in Mexico in June\n\nWeather in Mexico in July\n\nWeather in Mexico in August\n\nWeather in Mexico in October\n\nWeather in Mexico in November\n\nWeather in Mexico in December\n\nWeather in Mexico in September\n\nIn a nutshell, September is the wettest month for Mexico and after October, it has the biggest chance of hurricanes.\n\nSeptember is generally considered to be the peak of the hurricane season in Mexico, with the greatest risk for tropical storm and hurricane activity. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June- November, with the majority of storms occurring in September and October.\n\nMexico’s Pacific coast also has a separate hurricane season that runs from May-November 30th, with the majority of storms occurring during September and October.\n\nHowever, this does not mean there are not good places to visit that you can still enjoy. Los Cabos enjoys maximum temperatures of 86°F and you will enjoy up to 93°F in Merida, but you should expect some showers too.\n\nIn Mexico City, the average high temperature is around 77-82 °F (25-28 °C) and the average low temperature is around 55-64 °F (13-18 °C), with relatively low chance of rain.\n\nOn the Yucatan Peninsula, the weather is generally warm and humid, with high temperatures around 91-97 °F (33-36 °C) and low temperatures around 75-77 °F (24-25 °C) with a relatively low chance of rain as well.\n\nOn the Pacific coast, September is considered the start of the rainy season, with warm and humid weather, high temperatures around 91-97 °F (33-36 °C) and low temperatures around 75-77 °F (24-25 °C) and relatively high chance of rain.\n\nAs usual, it is always wise to check the local forecast and follow the advice of local authorities while planning your trip.\n\nWhen is Rainy season in Mexico?\n\nMexico’s rainy season runs from May to October so you’re very likely to see rain during your visit in September. Some places will have heavier downpours than others, but they will ease towards the end of the month.\n\nIn October, the rainy season is typically winding down in many parts of the country, but it can still be active in some regions.\n\nMexico City generally sees the end of the rainy season in October, with average rainfall of around 1 inch (25 mm) per month. On the Yucatan Peninsula, the rainy / hurricane season usually ends in October, with average rainfall around 2 inches (50 mm) per month.\n\nOn the Pacific coast, the rainy season usually continues into October, with the heaviest rainfall typically occurring in the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, and Oaxaca.\n\nThe average rainfall can be around 4-8 inches (100-200 mm) per month in these areas during October.\n\nIn Puerto Vallarta, there is still a chance of rain and thunderstorms, however the frequency and intensity usually decrease as the month goes by. Average rainfall in Puerto Vallarta for the month of October is around 4-5 inches (100-125 mm) per month\n\nAverage Temperatures for Mexico in September\n\nThe average temperature for Mexico in September is 82°F, but this doesn’t provide an accurate picture for all regions as it varies.\n\nThe cities will be cooler on average but the beaches can still reach up to 95°C in September. You will likely get an afternoon shower on the coast which will help cool you down!\n\nOverall, Mexico weather in September varies greatly depending on where you go.\n\nWhy Visit Mexico in September\n\nMexico is a year-round travel destination, and September is no exception to that.
