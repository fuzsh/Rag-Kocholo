        "meta_description": "Abstract. Projections of changes in extreme droughts under future\nclimate conditions are associated with large uncertainties, owing to the\ncomplex genesis of droughts and large model uncertainty in the atmospheric\ndynamics. In this study we investigate the impact of global warming on soil\nmoisture drought severity in west-central Europe by employing pseudo global\nwarming (PGW) experiments, which project the 1980â2020 period in a globally\nwarmer world. The future analogues of present-day drought episodes allow for\ninvestigation of changes in drought severity conditional on the historic\nday-to-day evolution of the atmospheric circulation. The 2018 west-central European drought is the most severe drought in the\n1980â2020 reference period in this region. Under 1.5,\n2 and 3ââC global warming, this drought episode\nexperiences strongly enhanced summer temperatures but a fairly modest soil\nmoisture drying response compared to the change in climatology. This is\nprimarily because evaporation is already strongly moisture-constrained\nduring present-day conditions, limiting the increase in evaporation and thus\nthe modulation of the temperature response under PGW. Increasing\nprecipitation in winter, spring and autumn limits or prevents an earlier\ndrought onset and duration. Nevertheless, the drought severity, defined as\nthe cumulative soil moisture deficit volume, increases considerably, with\n20â% to 39â% under 2ââC warming. The extreme drought frequency in the 1980â2020 period strongly increases\nunder 2ââC warming. Several years without noticeable droughts\nunder present-day conditions show very strong drying and warming. This\nresults in an increase in 2003-like drought occurrences, compounding with\nlocal summer temperature increases considerably aboveÂ 2ââC. Even without taking into account a (potentially large) dynamical response to\nclimate change, drought risk in west-central Europe is strongly enhanced\nunder global warming. Owing to increases in drought frequency, severity and\ncompounding heat, a reduction in recovery times between drought episodes is\nexpected to occur. Our physical climate storyline provides evidence\ncomplementing conventional large-ensemble approaches and is intended to\ncontribute to the formulation of effective adaptation strategies.",

        "text": "The impact of recent west-central European droughts and heat waves on society and nature (Vogel et al., 2019; RÃ¶sner et al., 2019; Kramer et al., 2019; Schuldt et al., 2020; Beillouin et al., 2020; Bastos et al., 2021; Krikken et al., 2021) once again triggered questions regarding the role of climate change in the occurrence and extremity of drought events (Kornhuber et al., 2019; Yiou et al., 2020; Philip et al., 2020; Zscheischler and Fischer, 2020) and on what to expect under continuing global warming (Toreti et al., 2019; Kornhuber et al., 2019; Hari et al.,Â 2020).\n\nThe 2018 growing season was the compound hottest and driest ever recorded in west-central Europe (Toreti et al., 2019; Zscheischler and Fischer, 2020), owing to a sequence of anomalously persistent high-pressure systems over eastern, northern and central Europe between April and October (Bissolli, 2019; Sluijter et al., 2018), associated with large-scale atmospheric subsidence, clear-sky conditions, and generally low relative humidity and moisture advection (Sousa et al., 2017, 2018), against the background of globally increasing temperatures (Philip et al., 2020; Vogel et al., 2019). Temperatures were anomalously high over almost the entire European continent (Vogel et al., 2019; Kornhuber et al., 2019), but the precipitation deficit was particularly intense and long lasting in west-central Europe. In this region the deficit built up from AprilâMay until November, only intermittently interrupted by intense but small-scale short-duration rainfall events (Bissolli, 2019; Sluijter et al., 2018). This led to soil desiccation and extremely low groundwater tables (Brakkee et al., 2022) and river discharge (Brunner et al., 2019; Kramer et al., 2019) in the west-central European river basins. The consecutive years 2019 and 2020 were characterized by record-braking heat waves (Vautard et al., 2020; Sousa et al., 2020) and anomalously dry conditions as well (Hari et al., 2020; Bastos et al., 2021; Bissolli, 2020, 2021; Rakovec et al., 2022; Van der Wiel et al., 2023). And again, in 2022, heat waves and severe and particularly widespread drought conditions affected Europe (Toreti et al., 2022). At the time of writing, soil moisture deficits, river water levels and river discharge approached or exceeded 2018 levels in several west-central European river basins, with reported impacts on ecology, agriculture and shipping (Toreti et al., 2022; WMCN-LCW, 2022; BfG,Â 2022).\n\nAlthough the probability of heat waves in this region is demonstrated to have increased in response to anthropogenic climate change (Stott et al., 2004; Vogel et al., 2019; Vautard et al., 2020), the attribution of extreme drought events is more complex (Trenberth et al., 2014). Independent drought events are scarce, owing to their long timescale and large spatial scale, which hampers the derivation of robust statistics. Moreover, the processes contributing to widespread drought conditions are not easily disentangled. Intense drought conditions are governed by persistent patterns of atmospheric circulation with low moisture advection into the region of interest. Trends over recent years suggest increases in the frequency and/or persistence of such circulation conditions (Coumou et al., 2014; Kornhuber et al., 2019), but observed circulation-related changes are generally dominated by natural variability (Shepherd, 2014), and there are no significant long-term trends in meteorological (precipitation) drought events in this region (Gudmundsson and Seneviratne, 2016; Hanel et al., 2018; Manning et al., 2019; Spinoni et al., 2019; Philip et al., 2020; GutiÃ©rrez et al., 2021). Nevertheless, observation- and model-based studies find decreasing trends in summer water availability (precipitation minus evaporation) (Spinoni et al., 2019; PadrÃ³n et al., 2020) and increases in the frequency and/or severity of soil moisture droughts (Hanel et al., 2018; Philip et al., 2020) as well as in long-duration compound hot and dry events (Manning et al., 2019). This is owing to increasing trends in atmospheric evaporative demand with global warming in the predominantly energy-constrained evaporation regime in west-central Europe.\n\nUnder further increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, climate projections agree on a general pattern of year-round decreasing precipitation in the Mediterranean and increasing precipitation in northern Europe, with the dryingâwetting transition zone shifting north in summer under higher levels of global warming (Jacob et al., 2014; Aalbers et al., 2018; Coppola et al., 2021; GutiÃ©rrez et al., 2021). For west-central Europe precipitation increases are projected for winter and autumn, while smaller increases or small decreases are projected for spring and summer. Soil moisture is projected to further decrease, with the strongest responses in summer and autumn (Ruosteenoja et al., 2018; Van der Linden et al., 2019), and studies based on large model ensembles show increases in the frequency and severity of (multi-year) drought episodes (Samaniego et al., 2018; Toreti et al., 2019; Hari et al., 2020). The magnitude and direction of the precipitation changes and the magnitude and timing of the soil moisture drying response are uncertain and depend on, e.g.,Â the climate model resolution and generation (Jacob et al., 2014; Coppola et al., 2021; Van der Linden et al., 2019), biases in the mean climate state in the reference period, and the ability of climate models to realistically represent land surfaceâatmosphere coupling (Orth et al., 2016; Van der Linden et al., 2019; Vogel et al., 2018; Selten et al., 2020) and atmospheric dynamics (Shepherd, 2014; Woollings et al.,Â 2018).\n\nIn this study the contribution of global warming to the increase in drought severity and frequency is being addressed by projecting the 2018 drought, as well as the entire 1980â2020 historical period, in a globally warmer world. This is an implementation of the so-called storyline approach (Hazeleger et al., 2015; Shepherd et al., 2018; Shepherd, 2019; Sillmann et al., 2021), a storyline being defined as a âphysically self-consistent unfolding of a past events, or of plausible future events or pathwaysâ (Shepherd et al., 2018). Instead of analyzing large-ensemble simulations to derive changes in the probability of extreme drought events, we construct plausible future drought events as analogues of extreme climate events that have actually occurred in the current climate (Hazeleger et al., 2015). As such, changes in droughts in response to global warming can be directly related to real-world events and their societal impact, which make the results very tangible and therewith useful for climate change communication.\n\nStorylines in the form of future analogues of heat waves and droughts have previously been constructed with, e.g.,Â spectral nudging of global climate models (GCMs) (Rasmijn et al., 2018; Wehrli et al., 2020; Van Garderen and Mindlin, 2022) and by selecting events from different warming periods in a very large GCM ensemble (Van der Wiel et al., 2021). Here, we follow a pseudo global warming (PGW) approach (SchÃ¤r et al., 1996), in which the atmospheric and ocean forcing data of regional climate model (RCM) simulations are perturbed to represent changes in the mean climate state. The PGW method has previously been used â from very simple uniform warming experiments to more advanced perturbations â to examine changes in heavy precipitation (e.g.,Â Attema et al., 2014; Prein et al., 2017; Lenderink et al., 2019), disentangle the contribution of different drivers to amplified Mediterranean warming and drying (KrÃ¶ner et al., 2017; Brogli et al., 2019), and provide future weather scenarios of extreme precipitation events (Klein Tank et al., 2015; Lenderink and Attema, 2015). In this study, we perform simulations with an RCM forced with reanalysis data to reconstruct the historical period and, specifically, the 2018 drought. For the PGW simulations we essentially rerun the simulations but perturb the atmospheric and oceanic forcing data with climate change information from global climate model (GCM) projections. It has been shown that by perturbing all state variables with the mean climate change signal in GCM projections, a large part of that mean climate change signal is captured (Brogli et al., 2019). At the same time, the day-to-day evolution of the synoptic-scale circulation in the PGW simulations, i.e.,Â the sequence of weather systems entering the model domain, remains essentially determined by the reanalysis forcing and is therefore very similar to the sequence seen in the present-day simulation. Responses from large-scale atmospheric circulation variability are thus suppressed, optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio (De Vries et al., 2022; Lenderink et al., 2023). Another advantage is that the reference climate state, which can have a large impact on drought evolution, is not affected by biases in a GCM since it is based on reanalysis data, thus avoiding one source of uncertainty in future projections.\n\nWe focus our analysis on the 2018 drought episode for its recent occurrence and severe impact. Based on the present-day simulations we first explore the atmospheric drivers and soil moisture evolution of the 2018 event under present-day conditions. We repeat this analysis with the PGW simulations, with perturbations derived from three different GCM projections and for several levels of global warming, to diagnose the response in atmospheric drivers, the soil moisture evolution and the severity of the 2018 drought event. Additionally we evaluate the position of this 2018 event in the 1980â2020 period, both for present-day and for future conditions under a single warming level.\n\nThe purpose of this work is to provide robust, physically consistent scenarios of what global warming entails for extreme droughts and for the full range of years from wet to moderately dry that occurred in the historical record. It is intended to complement projections of changes in drought risk derived with the conventional large-ensemble approaches, giving an explicit reference to collectively experienced real-world events.\n\nWe first present the main characteristics of the simulated 2018 drought episode and briefly discuss the evaluation of temperature and precipitation against observations. In Fig.Â 1a maps of the simulated 2018 seasonal anomaly in 500âhPa geopotential height (contours), temperature, precipitation, evaporation and soil moisture are shown for AprilâJune (AMJ), JulyâSeptember (JAS) and OctoberâDecember (OND). Anomalies are calculated from 2018 in the 2018REF simulation relative to the 1980â2017 period (climREF). Time series of these variables averaged over the west-central European river basins are shown in Fig.Â 1b, with observed temperature and precipitation delineated in red. The climatological mean and 5th and 95th percentile thresholds in observed and simulated temperature and precipitation are shown in Fig.Â C1a.\n\nThe 500âhPa geopotential height anomalies in (late) spring (AMJ) and summer (JAS) clearly co-occur with the large positive temperature anomalies and high precipitation deficits (contours and shading in the top two rows of Fig.Â 1a). Averaged over the west-central European river basins the simulated (observed) temperature anomaly is +3.1ââC (+2.5ââC) over the growing season (April to September), and temperatures exceed the 95th percentile during several episodes. Most noteworthy are 8â22Â April, with a 15âd mean temperature anomaly of +6.5ââC (+6.0ââC), and 22Â Julyâ8Â August, with an 18âd mean anomaly of +5.9ââC (+5.1ââC). The latter period was indeed classified as a heat wave in the individual countries (Yiou et al., 2020; Sluijter et al., 2018; Vogel et al., 2019; Bissolli, 2019). Apart from a cold bias in winter, the basin-mean simulated absolute temperatures are fairly accurate, with a small underestimation with respect to the observed 1980â2017 mean temperature in the growing season (â0.3ââC) and overestimation of the extreme conditions of 2018 temperatures (+0.3ââC) in most members of the 2018REF ensemble.\n\nBasin-mean precipitation is anomalously low in each month from February to November. Averaged over the growing season, the simulated (observed) basin-mean precipitation anomaly is â1.1âmmâdâ1 or â41â% (â37â%), with the largest, basin-wide deficits in June (â56â% (â43â%)) and in July (â64â% (â64â%)). Mean precipitation is overestimated compared to the observations with on average 0.2âmmâdâ1, both for the climatology andÂ 2018.\n\nUnder prevailing conditions of clear skies, high solar radiation, high temperatures and increasingly dry air, the response in the atmospheric evaporative demand is substantial (+1âmmâdâ1 or +35â% over the growing season). Also the actual evaporation is anomalously high from April up until the beginning of June, modulating the near-surface temperatures. However, it cannot keep up with the rise in atmospheric evaporative demand, owing to quickly increasing soil and canopy resistance against evaporation in response to decreasing relative humidity and soil moisture availability and has below-normal values from mid-June to October. As a consequence, the sensible heat flux strongly increases (not shown), which corresponds to an amplified rise in summer and autumn near-surface temperatures. Averaged over the growing season, the actual evaporation is slightly smaller than normal (â0.1âmmâdâ1 or â6â%).\n\nThe resulting extremity of the 2018 soil moisture drought is clearly reflected (bottom row of Fig.Â 1). Anomalously low soil moisture levels occur in large parts of central and northern Europe, but, consistent with the persistent precipitation deficits, conditions are most severe and persistent in west-central Europe. Averaged over the west-central European river basins the soil moisture conditions are around normal at the start of the growing season, owing to low temperatures and evaporation in March. Soils steadily deplete from April onwards, reach severely dry conditions (exceeding the 5th percentile) in the second half of May and are lowest in early August. Soil moisture levels remain very low throughout the growing season up to the end of October. This is when precipitation starts to exceed the evaporation and soil moisture replenishes, reaching the 5th percentile threshold in the beginning of JanuaryÂ 2019, after nearly 8Â months of severely dry conditions. By then, the soil moisture deficit volume has accumulated to 8240âmmâd, with a mean drought intensity of 36âmm. In Sect.Â 5.1 and Fig.Â 6 we will show the extremity of this number compared to other drought episodes in the 1980â2020 period. Normal soil moisture levels in the top 1âm of the soil are reached by early FebruaryÂ 2019. For deeper soil layers the winter precipitation is insufficient to fully replenish the soils to normal levels, and the anomalously dry conditions persist throughout 2019 (see Fig.Â C1b).\n\nThe overestimation of precipitation could imply an overestimation of the soil moisture levels. On the other hand, the overestimation of the 2018 summer temperature likely leads to a dry bias in soil moisture. The amount of inter-member spread in the 2018REF ensemble (natural variability generated within the RCM model domain) is found to be considerable in some periods, as seen in Fig.Â 1b (dark shading). The spread is largest in the period from the end of May to early June when variability in the location and intensity of precipitation-bearing systems induces relatively strong variability in wetness and temperature. While the ensemble spread in temperature is relatively short lived, the ensemble spread in soil moisture reduces more slowly over summer. One ensemble member receives much higher precipitation amounts in Mayâearly June, as well as in July and August. Evaporation in this member is consequently relatively high throughout summer, and the temperature is 1.1ââC (June) to 0.3ââC (September) lower than the ensemble mean, closer to the observations. Apart from model biases and natural variability, differences between actual and simulated atmospheric and soil conditions are possibly related to interactions between soil moisture and groundwater in especially the low-lying coastal areas, which are not taken into account inÂ HTESSEL.\n\n4.1âClimatological-mean response to 2ââC warming\n\nWe next present the climatological-mean response to a 2ââC warming to provide context to the 2018 response. FigureÂ 2 shows the seasonal response patterns in geopotential height, near-surface temperature, precipitation, (potential) evaporation and soil moisture over Europe for the EC-perturbed simulations. The annual cycle in the basin-mean response in these and additional variables is shown in Fig.Â 3. Results for the HAD- and MPI-perturbed simulations can be found in AppendixÂ D.\n\nThe spatial response patterns exhibit the well-known seasonally varying warming and drying gradients over Europe (e.g.,Â in the EURO-CORDEX ensemble (Coppola et al., 2021) and the RACMOâEC-EARTH initial-condition ensemble (Aalbers et al., 2018), showing that the PGW simulations indeed capture the main characteristics of the full climate response (Brogli et al., 2019; De Vries et al., 2022). In spring, autumn and winter the warming gradient is oriented roughly northwestâsoutheast, with the weakest warming over the British Isles and coastal regions adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea (blue colors represent warming below 2ââC). In summer, warming ranges between around 2.0ââC over Scandinavia to around 3.0ââC, locally 3.5ââC in southern Europe. Averaged over the river basins the near-surface temperature response varies between +1.4ââC in May and +2.6ââC in August (black line in Fig.Â 3a). Note that the inter-annual spread around the 1980â2017 mean response (grey box and whiskers) is rather large, especially in JAS, which will be discussed in Sect.Â 5.2.\n\nDownload\n\nThe transition zone of increasing precipitation in the north and decreasing precipitation in the south is positioned just southwest of the west-central European river basins in spring and autumn and over the northeast of the basins in summer, yielding increasing precipitation in winter, autumn and early spring and small decreases in summer for the basin mean (Figs.Â 2b, 3e). This co-occurs with nearly constant relative humidity in late autumn, winter and early spring and decreases in relative humidity in JJASO (JuneâOctober; Fig.Â 3d). Net surface solar radiation increases in JJASO (Fig.Â 3b), when cloud cover and relative humidity decrease. Under conditions of higher temperatures and enhanced by the increase in solar radiation and decrease in relative humidity from late spring to late autumn, the atmospheric evaporative demand increases over land throughout the year (Figs.Â 2c, 3f). The present-day soil moisture regime in west-central Europe allows for year-round increases in actual evaporation in almost all years, with around the potential rate in winter and early spring but smaller than the potential rate in JJASO (Figs.Â 2d, 3g), resulting in increases in the sensible heat flux in the latter period (Fig.Â 3c).\n\nFor the combined river basin area, the increased evaporation and reduced summer precipitation lead to enhanced soil moisture depletion in late spring and summer, while in autumn and winter increases in precipitation result in a faster soil moisture replenishment. This feature of the response is amplified by a larger fraction of precipitation falling as rain in autumn (due to higher temperatures) and reduced snowmelt in spring (due to a smaller snowpack). The resulting soil moisture levels in the top 1âm of the soil are around present-day or even wetter conditions in winter and early spring but drier from mid-June to December, with a maximum drying response in September (Figs.Â 2e, 3h). In summer and autumn, the soil moisture availability in deeper layers and runoff decrease as well (see Fig.Â D3). However, the response in annual precipitation equals the response in annual evaporation, meaning that each winter soil moisture levels in all layers are restored to present-day levels and decreases in summer runoff are compensated by increases in winter.\n\nWith the amplitude of the response and the position of the dryingâwetting transition zone being dependent on the GCM, the MPI- and HAD-perturbed simulations give slightly different results (see maps in Figs.Â D1 and D2 and time series in Figs.Â D4 and D5). The dryingâwetting transition zone is located further northeast in all seasons for both clim+2K|MPI and clim+2K|HAD. clim+2K|MPI shows a weaker temperature response in spring but much stronger warming and drying in JAS (Fig.Â D1a,Â b), consistent with a strong response in the geopotential height anomaly (contours in Fig.Â D1a). The soil moisture depletion over the growing season in the west-central European river basins is consequently stronger but so is the soil moisture replenishment in autumn and winter (Figs.Â D1e, D4i). clim+2K|HAD shows a stronger temperature and evaporation response in spring than the EC- and MPI-perturbed simulations, increases in precipitation are overall smaller, and soil moisture levels are found to decrease earlier in spring (Figs.Â D2,Â D5).\n\n4.2â2018 response to 2ââC warming\n\nThe response of the hot and exceptionally dry growing season of 2018 that unfolded under persistent conditions of atmospheric blocking is shown for the basin mean in Fig.Â 3 (red boxes). Maps of the 2018 response anomaly with respect to the climatological-mean response are shown in Fig.Â 4 for 2018+2K|EC. Results for 2018+2K|HAD and MPI can be found in AppendixÂ D.\n\nThe 2018 response in winter and early spring preceding the blocking conditions is very similar to the climatological-mean response in most variables and results in slightly wetter soil moisture conditions at the start of the growing season in April in 2018+2K|EC than in 2018REF. Also in spring, the 2018 soil moisture and circulation anomalies do not have a strong effect on the response. Consistent with the climatological-mean response, precipitation is found to increase in April and May, with relatively strong increases in April. Apparently, the precipitation events originate from sources with sufficient moisture supply to sustain these increases. Note that the precipitation response is rather patchy (Fig.Â 4b), despite the application of the 11-member ensembles. Evaporation rises by more than the potential rate in these months but only partially compensates the precipitation increase. Despite a small decrease in snowmelt and increase in runoff (see Fig.Â 5b; discussed in Sect.Â 4.3), the top 1âm of the soil is slightly wetter until mid-June in 2018+2K|EC than inÂ 2018REF.\n\nDownload\n\nFrom mid-June onwards strong deviations from the climatological-mean response occur for the temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric evaporative demand and evaporation responses, exceeding the 25thâ75th percentile range of 1980â2017 (Figs.Â 3a,Â d,Â f,Â g and 4a,Â c,Â d). Decreases in precipitation (JuneâSeptember) and the weak evaporation response (JulyâSeptember) show that sources of moisture are even more limited in a 2ââC warming scenario. Precipitation in this period originates from predominantly continental sources (Benedict et al., 2021), and the evaporation response is moisture constrained throughout Europe (Fig.Â 4c,Â d).\n\nFrom July to September the temperature response over the basin area and surroundings is amplified compared to the climatological-mean response (+3.0ââC over the 2018 JAS period compared to +2.4ââC for the climatology in the basin area). This response anomaly correlates with the anomalously low response pattern of actual evaporation. Within the basin, evaporation barely increases or even decreases in the period JulyâOctober and co-occurs with a further decrease in relative humidity, a modest increase in the sensible heat flux (Fig.Â 3c) and an increase in near-surface temperature. Note that the increase in solar radiation is relatively small in June and July (Fig.Â 3b), given the predominantly clear-sky conditions in 2018REF, and that the increase in the sensible heat flux is only slightly larger than the climatological response. Increases in heat advection due to stronger warming in upwind regions or enhanced warming through subsidence may play a role in the amplified warming asÂ well.\n\nSince the response in summer evaporation in the west-central European river basins is close to zero, the JAS soil moisture response is small compared to most other years in the 1980â2020 period (Fig.Â 3h) and is almost completely determined by the decrease in precipitation. The pattern of the soil moisture response anomaly strongly correlates with the precipitation response anomaly in this period (Fig.Â 4e). Percolation to deeper soil layers and runoff decrease in this period as well (see Figs.Â D3 andÂ 5b; discussed in Sect.Â 4.3). In autumn and winter, moderate precipitation increases replenish the soils to 2018REF levels in DecemberâJanuary in the top 1âm of the soil and in deeper layers.\n\n4.3âSensitivity of the 2018 response to the level of global warming and GCM perturbations\n\nIn Fig.Â 5 we show the 2018 basin-mean time series of the anomaly in near-surface temperature, the top 1âm SWI (Fig.Â 5a) and the hydrological-budget changes over AMJ and JAS (Fig.Â 5b) for all warming levels and PGW simulations (EC, MPI andÂ HAD).\n\nIn the EC-perturbed simulations, the temperature response is fairly linear with global warming under the increasingly moisture-constrained conditions, with 2.2, 3.0 and 4.3ââC warming during the JulyâAugust heat wave under respectively 1.5, 2 and 3ââC global warming and 1.7, 2.3 and 3.4ââC warming for the growing-season mean. This yields temperature anomalies during the JulyâAugust heat wave (i.e.,Â deviations with respect to climREF) of +8.1, +8.9 and +10.2ââC, compared to +5.9ââC under present-day conditions. The soil moisture depletion over the growing season increases with higher levels of global warming but only from mid-June onwards. In AMJ, precipitation increases are stronger under 3ââC warming than under 1.5ââC but so are the evaporation increase, snowmelt decrease and runoff increase, resulting in the almost zero change in soil moisture depletion in the top 1âm of the soil over AMJ for higher levels of global warming. The increase in soil moisture depletion over JAS for higher levels of global warming is mainly driven by stronger decreases in JAS precipitation. Although the JAS evaporative demand increases with higher levels of global warming, actual evaporation does not increase or only does so very weakly. Note that the soil moisture depletion in deeper soil layers is more pronounced and occurs throughout the growing season (redÂ bar in Fig.Â 5b).\n\nIn the MPI-perturbed simulations for 2018, the soil moisture response is fairly similar to the EC-perturbed simulations in spring, despite a weaker increase in AMJ precipitation, which is compensated by a weaker increase in evaporation. Also in summer and autumn the soil moisture drying is fairly similar under 1.5 and 2ââC warming, as is the response in hydrological-budget terms. Under 3ââC warming the soil moisture drying is more pronounced owing to a stronger decrease in precipitation. JAS evaporation decreases, and the JAS temperature response is amplified compared to 1.5 and 2ââC warming.\n\nThe HAD-perturbed simulations under 1.5 and 2ââC warming give a stronger near-surface heating and show soil moisture drying from the start of the growing season onwards. This is a feature of the climatological-mean response under 2ââC warming (solid red line in Fig.Â 5a; see Sect.Â 4.1), but it is more pronounced under the circulation of 2018. In contrast to the EC- and MPI-perturbed simulations and the HAD-perturbed simulations under 3ââC warming, precipitation decreases in AMJ. Under 3ââC warming, the response in the hydrological-budget terms is fairly similar to the EC-perturbed simulations, yet the response in the near-surface temperature is stronger.\n\nAalbers, E.
