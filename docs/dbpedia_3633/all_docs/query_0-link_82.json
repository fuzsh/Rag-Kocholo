        "text": "A natural greenhouse effect has been warming the Earth for some 3.7 billion years, keeping it habitable for life. Energy radiated by the sun passes through the atmosphere and reaches the Earth’s surface relatively unimpeded. Some energy is absorbed by oceans, soils and vegetation, and is mostly re-emitted as infrared radiation (i.e. heat). This radiation is less able to pass through the atmosphere and is partly trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide, methane, water vapour, nitrous oxide and ozone.\n\nThe temperature of the Earth has not been constant over time. Global temperatures and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations have fluctuated naturally over millions of years -- climate change is therefore not a new phenomenon. However, a seemingly small change in mean global temperature can have significant impacts on the Earth’s climate. The difference between a planetary ice age and a warm interglacial period is a variation in global mean temperature of 6–7°C (IPCC 2007). Temperature changes of this scale can lead to substantial disturbances of the world’s climate and ecosystems, and have triggered mass extinctions in the past.\n\nHistorically, these natural cycles of change have taken place gradually over millennial timeframes. Since the start of the industrial age in about 1750, the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) with land-use changes, agriculture and other human activities, have resulted in growing emissions of greenhouse gases and an accumulation of these in the atmosphere. From the middle of the twentieth century these emissions have increased markedly. The rates of increase now being observed in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and consequently in temperature are unprecedented in the past 800,000 years (Lüthi et al. 2008).\n\nThese increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations have in turn led to unprecedented changes in the rate of global warming. Nineteen of the highest global mean surface temperature years have occurred since 2000 (NASA 2020). The global mean surface temperature in 2020 matched that of 2016 and was the highest on record since pre-industrial times (1850).\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a United Nations body that assesses the latest scientific research on climate change and its effects from around the world. The IPCC has published five comprehensive assessment reports to date, releasing the Fifth Assessment Report in 2014 (IPCC 2014). In August 2021, the IPCC released a preliminary report to the Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC 2021). Some key findings from this report include:\n\nglobally, warming has now reached around a 1.1°C increase in surface air temperature since industrialisation from 1850–1900\n\nthe human influence is clear and is the dominant cause of global warming since 1950\n\nbased on current trajectories (if nothing changes) the mean global temperature will likely increase to about 1.5°C by 2030\n\nfor Australia, heat extremes and heatwaves are likely to increase and cold hazards will likely decrease over the 21st century\n\na decrease in cool season mean rainfall is projected for eastern Australia.\n\nGlobal sea level rise is accelerating due to increased rates of ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica and thermal expansion of seawater (IPCC 2019b). Sea level rise is expected to lead to increased erosion of coastlines and more frequent and extensive coastal flooding. In the longer term, permanent inundation of low-lying coastal areas and increased tropical cyclone winds and extreme waves are likely, which will exacerbate coastal hazards.\n\nIn the last 50 years, global oceans have warmed and taken up more than 90% of excess heat (IPCC 2019b). Ocean warming and acidification due to increased levels of carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater will lead to changes in the composition of marine ecosystems. Intensifying global warming will increase the exposure of small islands, low-lying coastal areas and deltas to the risks associated with sea level rise, including increased saltwater intrusion, flooding and damage to infrastructure (IPCC 2021).\n\nClimate conditions are likely to become less favourable for many species and ecosystems, which will be forced to migrate or adapt physiologically to survive. Changes in climate will also lead to reduced productivity in some agricultural systems, requiring a transition to alternative crops or shifting the location of some industries. Detrimental effects are also expected on human health and wellbeing.\n\nThe observed changes to climate and the projected future changes described in previous sections are already having widespread effects on the natural and urban environments of NSW. In many areas the impacts are already apparent and will become more extensive and pronounced over time.\n\nExtreme weather and climate events\n\nOne consequence of increases in mean temperature is changes in temperature-related extremes. The IPCC AR6 report (2021) shows that over Australia heat-related extremes have increased and cold-related extremes have decreased. The report also concludes that these trends in hot and cold extremes are projected to continue in future.\n\nAnother consequence of increases in mean temperature is an increase in the moisture-holding capacity of the atmosphere (Collins et al. 2013). This increase is due to the Clausius-Clapeyron relation (Pall, Allen & Stone 2007), i.e. the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere increases by around 7% for every 1 increase in temperature, which by itself would be expected to cause an intensification of extreme precipitation events. However, changes in atmospheric dynamics (which encompass all physical processes within the atmosphere, e.g. circulation, convection) are expected to complicate this response and lead to diverse regional changes in precipitation extremes (Pfahl, O’Gorman & Fischer 2017).\n\nOver NSW, climate extremes like heatwaves, bushfires, flooding, hail and storms have historically had the costliest impacts. This section explains how atmospheric warming impacts a range of climate extremes experienced in NSW.\n\nHeatwaves\n\nHeatwaves are broadly defined as prolonged periods of excessive heat (Perkins and Alexander 2013) and can have disastrous impacts on human health (Gasparrini et al. 2017), agriculture, workplace productivity, wildfire frequency and intensity, and public infrastructure (Perkins-Kirkpatrick & Lewis 2020). In Australia, heatwaves are one of the deadliest natural hazards, causing 55% of all natural disaster related deaths (Coates et al. 2014) and costing the economy about US$6.2 billion every year (Zander et al. 2015).\n\nHeatwaves have increased in intensity, duration, and frequency in parts of NSW and the ACT since 1911 (OEH 2015). The most significant increases in heatwave intensity have occurred along the Great Dividing Range, in parts of the far west and eastern seaboard (Argüeso et al. 2015b). In NSW, statistically significant increases in heatwave frequency and length of the longest heatwave each year are projected for 2030 under all emission scenarios. By 2070, statistically significant increases in peak heatwave temperatures, heatwave frequency and length of the longest heatwave each year are projected.\n\nCold extremes\n\nThe frequency of extremely cold days and nights has declined across Australia. An exception to this is for extremely cold nights is in parts of south east and south west Australia which have seen significant cool season drying, and hence more clear winter nights (Commonwealth of Australia 2020). The number of frost days per year in Australia has, on average, declined at a rate of 0.15 days per decade in the past century, except in some regions of southern Australia (Alexander & Arblaster 2017).\n\nThe latest global climate models from the World Climate Research Programme’s (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) project decreases in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes over south-eastern Australia, as measured by the monthly minimum value of daily minimum temperatures (Li et al. 2021).\n\nUrban heat\n\nUrban centres and cities are warmer and typically less humid than surrounding rural areas, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect, noting though that the UHI temperature difference is usually larger at night than during the day, and also larger during winter than summer. Urbanisation exacerbates effects of global warming in cities. Cities create their own microclimates by influencing the surrounding atmosphere and interacting with climate processes.\n\nHuman activity, heat-absorbing concrete, glazing, black roof tiles and other building materials, combined with limited vegetation and tree canopy, contribute to the UHI effect. One-kilometre simulations over Sydney greater metropolitan area show that future changes to land-use could enhance temperature increases caused by climate change (OEH 2015). These simulations show that the largest temperature increases are projected to occur in areas converted from forest and grasslands to new urban developments (Argüeso et al. 2015a), for example, in north west and south west Sydney. The largest temperature increases are likely to occur on summer afternoons and during the night.\n\nNote that the UHI temperature difference is usually greater at night than during the day, and during winter than in summer.\n\nTeachers: explore this resource on urban heat Stage 3 students\n\nDrought\n\nAustralia’s climate is dominated by high seasonal and inter-annual rainfall variability and a complex combination of large-scale climate drivers such as El Niño Southern Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and Southern Annular Mode (Nicholls, Drosdowsky & Lavery 1997; Risbey et al. 2009). As a result, drought is a recurring feature of the Australian environment.\n\nAll droughts are unique, and range greatly in duration and intensity. The NSW Department of Primary Industries monitors drought across NSW through the Enhanced Drought Information System (EDIS) (Clark et al. 2016). Figure 21.10 tracks drought over a 20-year period from 2000 to 2021. The ‘Millennium Drought’ was characterised by a sequence of lower intensity drought events separated by short recovery periods. In contrast, the most recent drought in 2017–19 was shorter but considerably higher intensity and covered a much larger area. This period was also characterised by the relatively weak state of major climate drivers (King et al. 2020).\n\nStatewide, the evidence for future droughts is subject to considerable scientific uncertainty. Under climate change, drought is expected to increase in severity and frequency in some areas due to decreasing regional precipitation, and potentially increasing evaporation (Sheffield, Wood & Roderick 2012; Dai 2011;Sheffield & Wood 2008; Field et al. 2012). Droughts may begin quickly, last longer and be more intense (Trenberth et al. 2014). The strength of these overall expectations is the subject of ongoing scientific work, for example at regional level there is the prospect that feedback through evapotranspiration could dampen these effects (Ukkola et al. 2016).\n\nDue to the many definitions of drought and the complex interactions involved between the atmosphere and land surface, robust regional projections are difficult to formulate. However, global and regional climate models tend to agree that meteorological drought, which is concerned only with long term decreases in rainfall, will intensify, last longer and become more frequent in southern NSW (Feng et al. 2018; Herold et al. 2018; Kirono et al. 2020; Ukkola et al. 2020).\n\nStorms and cyclones\n\nIn NSW, climate change is expected to affect the behaviour of storms and associated phenomena such as cyclones, high winds, hail and lightning. Future projections of hailstorms over NSW based on recent climate modelling remain highly uncertain (Raupach et al. 2021).\n\nResearch indicates that in some parts of eastern Australia climate change may be associated with future increases in the frequency of thunderstorms (Allen & Karoly 2014). Storms with the greatest impact on NSW are East Coast Lows, which are low-pressure systems that develop off the south east coast of Australia. Decreases in the frequency of these are projected during winter months, but there is considerable uncertainty in projection of East Coast Lows in warmer months (Ji et al. 2015; Pepler et al. 2016; Walsh et al. 2016; Dowdy et al. 2019).\n\nFlood\n\nFloods and extreme storms damage property and infrastructure and affect the health and wellbeing of communities. Changes in flood frequency and intensity and their impacts on the environment are difficult to project because changes in flood levels and associated annual exceedance of rain can be attributed to a range of factors. These include changes in atmospheric forcings, catchment management, and land use changes including urbanisation and deforestation which can affect the translation of rainfall to runoff (Ishak & Rahman 2019).\n\nDespite the many factors contributing to flood hazard, climate models only simulate rainfall and generally at a coarser resolution than ideally required to characterise flood hazard. Nonetheless, some predictions of flood under climate change have been made. For example, increases in the magnitude and frequency of flood events in Parramatta, Hawkesbury-Nepean and Queanbeyan rivers are projected (Schreider, Smith & Jakeman 2000). The frequency of a one in a 100-year flood may be reduced to:\n\none in 44 years in Upper Parramatta River\n\none in 35 years in Hawkesbury-Nepean River\n\none in 10 years in Queanbeyan River.\n\nDifferent trends may occur in other parts of the state with contrasting rainfall projections or in non-urbanised catchments.\n\nThe frequency of extreme rainfall events – which can be associated with flash flooding – is also projected to increase in many areas under global warming (Herold et al. 2018). East Coast Lows have been identified as the leading cause of major floods along the south east coast of Australia (Callaghan & Power 2014). Further, without considering changes in rainfall, increases in coastal flooding are expected due to higher sea levels interacting with higher flood levels.\n\nBushfires\n\nBushfires can be extremely destructive and may result in substantial social costs, including the loss of human lives, buildings, infrastructure, native plants and animals, and livestock. Over the last decade, NSW has experienced an increase in the number of dangerous weather conditions for bushfires (CSIRO 2021). The 'Black Summer' bushfires of late 2019 to early 2020 were exceptionally ferocious, noting that 2019 was Australia’s warmest and driest year on record (BOM 2020c). These bushfires caused frequent spikes in air pollution across Sydney (Di Virgilio et al. 2021), and across the country caused 429 smoke-related deaths (Johnston et al. 2021), burnt over 18 million hectares, destroyed 3113 homes (Filkov et al. 2020), and killed 3 billion animals (van Eeden et al. 2020).\n\nThe Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) is a commonly used indicator in Australia for fire weather (McArthur 1967). The NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) issues fire weather warnings when the FFDI is forecast to be more than 50. In December 2019, large areas of Australia experienced their highest accumulated FFDI since records began in 1950 (BOM 2020a).\n\nAll bushfires require an ignition source, and risk factors related to bushfire occurrence include (Bradstock 2010):\n\nweather conditions, including high wind speed and temperature, and low relative humidity\n\nthe dryness of the fuel, the type of fuel and the fuel load\n\nthe physical structure of vegetation and the terrain in which the fire is burning\n\nthe effectiveness of fire suppression actions.\n\nThe relationship between fire and climate is complex. It involves multiple interacting processes, including both climatic and non-climatic conditions. On average, climate change is making southeast Australia more conducive to bushfires, with:\n\nan increase in the risk of heatwaves\n\nlonger fire seasons\n\ntrends towards reduced cool season rainfall in the south east and drought indicators\n\nvariations in key climate forces such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole and Southern Annular Mode\n\nconditions that encourage fire-generated thunderstorms\n\nin coastal NSW since 1979, an increased number of incidences of dry lightning, which is one of the leading natural causes of bushfire ignition (Abram et al. 2021).\n\nAlready, the fire season arrives more than three months earlier than in the mid-twentieth century (Royal Commission 2020, p. 63).\n\nClimate projections for NSW suggest future increases in the frequency of severe fire weather, especially in the state’s west (OEH 2014). Map 21.2 shows the projected change in the average number of severe fire weather days per year between 1990–2009 and 2060–2079. More recent research suggests that fuel loads will also increase in the future (Clarke et al. 2016). The bushfire season will extend earlier into spring but severe fire weather in autumn is projected to decrease in eastern NSW due to a projected increase in rainfall.\n\nSome of the most intense and damaging bushfires in Australia, or ‘extreme wildfires’ (e.g. the 2003 Canberra fires, the 2009 Black Saturday fires, and some 2019/20 Black Summer) were characterised by widespread flaming areas that generated violent pyroconvection due to favourable atmospheric conditions. This occurs when a fire releases heat and moisture into the lower atmosphere, causing conditions similar to those that drive thunderstorms. This can contribute to the rapid spread and unpredictability of such extreme wildfires (Sharples et al. 2016).\n\nDi Virgilio et al. (2019) have shown that the conditions conducive to these extreme wildfires will increase in frequency in south-eastern Australia by the end of the 21st century. These projections indicate that the biggest increases in fire weather conditions will be in late spring, effectively resulting in longer fire seasons that extend earlier into the year. The extension of the season conducive to extreme wildfires into spring is important because extreme wildfires in south-eastern Australia are typically summer phenomena. A change in seasonality therefore has implications for resource allocations by fire agencies such as the NSW RFS.\n\nLand and marine ecosystems and processes\n\nClimate change is projected to alter land and marine ecosystem function. These changes will create feedbacks on regional climates (IPCC 2019a). For example, as noted above, the cooler months in NSW are expected to be warmer with less precipitation. In the NSW Alpine region, this translates to less snow accumulation (DPIE 2021). The resulting decrease in snow cover and albedo will enhance winter warming further. The following sections describe how climate change exacerbates existing risks to biodiversity, ecosystem health, and food systems. The following sections describe ways climate change exacerbates existing risks to biodiversity, ecosystem health and food systems.\n\nSoil health\n\nSoils support the growth of most plant life and are a crucial element of all terrestrial ecosystems. By 2070, changes are predicted in the condition and character of soils due in part to the impacts of climate change. These will need to be considered in the future management of soils and associated agriculture, and the maintenance of native ecosystems in NSW.\n\nSoil erosion affects soil condition, agricultural productivity and water quality. Over the next 20–50 years the erosion rate of soil is predicted to be 7–19% higher due to the effects of climate change. The areas most affected will be mountainous regions of the Great Dividing Range, especially along the Central Coast, North Coast and Hunter Valley (Yang et al. 2016).\n\nSoil organic carbon is a widely used indicator of soil health. This is expected to decline throughout the state due to climate change, resulting in average losses of 10 t/ha (to 1 m depth). In the southern alpine region, losses greater than 20 t/ha are likely (Gray & Bishop 2018, 2019). The associated substantial loss of carbon into the atmosphere increases greenhouse gas emissions and makes it harder to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and reduce the impacts of climate change (DPIE 2020b).\n\nThe pH of soil represents its degree of acidity or alkalinity. Higher pH or more alkaline soils are projected over most the state due to climate change, generally becoming more alkaline from east to west. The largest increases of up to 0.5 pH are expected in the southern alpine areas (Gray & Bishop 2018, 2019).\n\nTerrestrial species and ecosystems\n\nAs many Australian species are adapted to highly variable climates, they have capacity to cope with limited changes in climate. However, the resilience of many species may have been reduced by pressures on biodiversity which have already resulted in documented declines (see the Native Fauna and Threatened Species topics).\n\nClimate change is expected to exacerbate threats to ecosystems and introduce additional pressures (Steffen et al. 2009; Hughes 2011). Scientific studies suggest that over the next few decades, climate change could surpass habitat destruction as the greatest threat to biodiversity (Leadley et al. 2010). This impact could be as great as the historical losses of biodiversity that have already occurred in NSW and Australia (Drielsma et al. 2017). Biodiversity decline due to climate change is already approaching the magnitude of loss experienced in NSW from more than 200 years of non-climate related impacts such as natural resource exploitation, land clearing and introduction of invasive species. These other impacts are likely to continue and will be exacerbated by continued impacts of climate change (OEH 2016).\n\nAs the climate changes, the capacity of landscapes to support ecosystems will decline. Many of the most vulnerable ecosystems in Australia are found in NSW and are sensitive to changes in climate. These include:\n\necosystems that only exist at certain elevations, such as alpine systems\n\ncoastal floodplains and wetlands\n\nthe wetlands and floodplains of the Murray–Darling Basin\n\ntemperate eucalypt forests\n\nsaltmarshes and mangroves.\n\nThe main threats to these ecosystems are extreme weather events, changes to fire regimes and water balance and hydrology (Laurence et al. 2011). Although its true impacts can only be gauged in the coming years, it is likely that NSW has experienced irreversible biodiversity losses from recent drought, extreme temperatures and their culmination in driving the Black Summer (2019–20) bushfires which were extraordinary in terms of scale and severity (DPIE 2020).\n\nBy 2070, many areas of NSW are projected to become 30–60% less suitable for their present ecosystems, requiring species to either migrate or adapt. Some of the greatest changes are expected to occur across the highly modified landscapes of the wheat–sheep belt, where the capacity to absorb climate change impacts has been diminished.\n\nMany plant and animal species are sensitive to changes in climatic variables, such as temperature, rainfall and humidity. Species identified as the most at risk from climate change include those with:\n\na narrow range of physiological tolerances\n\nlow genetic variability and long generation times\n\nspecialised relationships with other species or narrow geographic ranges\n\nlimited physical capacity to disperse or move to new habitats (Steffen et al. 2009).\n\nSome species and ecosystems may adapt to the effects of climatic change through a range of strategies, such as:\n\nevolving or changing their behaviour in their current location\n\ntaking refuge in local areas that are buffered from the changes\n\nmigrating or dispersing to areas where the climate is more suitable.\n\nHowever, these responses may be constrained by both the increasing rate of climate change and pre-existing threats to biodiversity, such as habitat fragmentation (Drielsma et al. 2017; OEH 2016).\n\nListen to a podcast on one of the ways we can protect plants from climate change (19 minutes)\n\nOcean acidification\n\nThe increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations is increasing ocean acidity. There has been an observed increase in acidity of ocean waters off NSW since the late 1800s. Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide and resulting ocean acidification may affect marine organisms through changes to their metabolic physiology and the calcification rates of hard structures such as shells and external skeletons. Acidification will cause losses to species diversity and abundance, with shifts to unusual communities of non-calcifying organisms.\n\nEvidence for the impacts of acidification comes mostly from experimental work on calcifying, stationary animals, which are most vulnerable to ocean acidification (Parker et al. 2013; Ross et al. 2011). Marine molluscs such as oysters, abalone and whelks are thought to be particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification, especially in their juvenile reproductive stages (Parker, Ross & O’Connor 2010; Scanes et al. 2014). Acidification acts with temperature to reduce fertilisation in Sydney rock oysters, resulting in smaller size, longer development times and increased abnormality of larval stages (Parker, Ross & O’Connor 2010). Acidification also acts with other pressures to threaten their survival (Scanes et al. 2017).\n\nRegular measurements of aragonite saturation state and pH of ocean waters were limited until sampling commenced at National Reference Stations as part of the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) in 2009. Using a combination of recent data and models, a time-series analysis indicated a decline in both aragonite saturation state and pH for Australian temperate waters during 1870–1890 to 2009–2018 (Tilbrook et al. 2020). Ocean acidity is projected to increase, with a further fall in pH by 0.04-0.05 units by 2040 (IPCC) in eastern Australia.\n\nCoastal erosion and inundation\n\nSea level rise is likely to be one of the most difficult impacts of climate change to manage. The rate of sea level rise is projected to increase, resulting in greater exposure of communities, properties and infrastructure in the coastal zone to inundation and erosion. Low lying properties and infrastructure around the foreshore of rivers and estuaries are particularly vulnerable. The potential implications include:\n\nhigher and more frequent inundation by tides and storm surge events, eventually leading to permanent inundation of low-lying areas\n\nthe landward recession of sandy shorelines\n\nsaltwater intrusion into groundwater aquifers\n\nthe landward advance of tidal limits in estuaries\n\nchanges to the frequency of entrance opening and flooding behaviour of intermittently closed and open lakes and lagoons\n\nthe failure of stormwater infrastructure and sewerage systems.\n\nMany sites in NSW are subject to tidal inundation which floods streets and paths during higher tides. This is sometimes referred to as ‘sunny day’ or ‘nuisance’ flooding. The frequency of these events, while variable from year to year, has increased over the last few decades (Hague et al. 2020; Hanslow et al. 2019) as sea levels rise.\n\nConsiderable development along the NSW coast is exposed to inundation and erosion hazards, and this will increase with climate change. A recent erosion assessment for NSW found approximately 250 property lots where more than half the allotment was subject to coastal erosion. The number of property lots affected by coastal erosion is expected to increase to around 1,860 by 2050, and to around 3,300 by 2100 (Kinsela et al. 2017; OEH 2017).\n\nUsing the same measure (more than half the property lot), exposure to tidal inundation during king tides currently affects around 600 properties near estuaries in NSW. This is predicted to increase to:\n\n4,300 with 0.5 m of sea level rise\n\n22,100 with 1m of sea level rise\n\n43,300 with 1.5 m of sea level rise (Hanslow et al. 2018; OEH 2018).\n\nNutrients and ocean productivity\n\nDeclines in the nutrients available in the water column has implications for the reproduction and growth of the organisms at the base of the food chain including microbes and the phytoplankton. Planktonic microbes are the ocean food chain nutrient recyclers and are, by number, the most common organism on earth. They make up 90% of the mass of organisms in the world’s oceans followed by other types of plankton. A decline in nutrient availability associated with these organisms has implications throughout the food web from the smaller zooplankton, larvae and baitfish up to those at the top of the food chain including sharks, seals, dolphins and whales. In the period 2003 to 2018, ocean waters off NSW experienced a 12.9% decline in mean daily production by microscopic plants (phytoplankton) (Butler, Skuza & Lønborg C 2020). Declines in nutrient concentrations of nitrate, phosphate and silicate over the NSW shelf and Tasman Sea are probably associated with intensification of the East Australian Current (Hobday et al. 2006; Hobday & Lough 2011; Wernberg et al. 2011). The current brings clear warm water south from the Coral Sea into NSW that is low in nutrients. Large spinning ‘eddies’ of ocean water form south of Byron Bay and as they move south, they push or pull water and nutrients to and away from the coast.\n\nNorth easterly winds that blow onshore during the summer create wind-driven currents that drive warm surface water offshore. The surface water is replaced by water from deeper areas off the continental shelf. This deep water is cold and relatively nutrient rich, and can spike phytoplankton blooms that can be seen from space. In the past 20 years, there has been a decline in volume and abundance of phytoplankton off the coast of Sydney (Ajani et al. 2014, 2016; Everett et al. 2020) but not in zooplankton (organisms that depend on phytoplankton to survive).\n\nMarine species and ecosystems\n\nThe long-term impacts of climate change on ocean warming and acidification are expected to have significant effects on marine species and ecosystems across south east Australia (Hobday et al. 2006; Wernberg et al. 2011; Vergés et al. 2014).\n\nIn general, climate change impacts include changes to:\n\nthe composition of foreshore communities\n\nthe distribution and abundance of marine species, including phytoplankton (Ajani et al. 2016) and copepods (small or microscopic crustaceans that are a food source for many other species) (Richardson, Davies & Eriksen 2020)\n\nthe timing of life cycle events\n\nthe physiology, morphology and behaviour of individual species, for example, rates of metabolism, reproduction or development\n\nthe composition of biological communities\n\nconnectivity among populations, species and habitats (Coleman et al. 2013; Coleman et al. 2017).\n\nSpecific studies have identified that increases in temperature are likely to result in:\n\nthe establishment, spread and virulence of pathogens and exotic species (Wernberg et al. 2011; Campbell et al. 2011; Harvell et al. 2002)\n\nchanges in the range and distribution of harvested species (Pecl et al. 2011; Cetina-Heredia et al. 2015)\n\nchanges in the composition, structure and dynamics of communities (Vergés et al. 2014; Provost et al. 2017)\n\ndisease in seaweeds (Campbell et al. 2011; Qui et al. (in review))\n\nthe poleward contraction of kelp and other macroalgal habitats (Smale & Wernberg 2013)\n\na reduction in kelp habitat and associated changes in community composition and ecosystem function, particularly in northern NSW (Vergés et al. 2016).\n\nPredictive studies show that changes in the movement of water masses, rather than temperature, will have the greatest potential impact on future distributions of species in NSW waters (Cetina-Heredia et al. 2015), though this is an area that needs further research. Whereas species from tropical and subtropical areas will be able to survive further south in NSW, existing species in those areas will migrate south into Victoria, Tasmania and even further. Some marine organisms will run out of available habitat (Richardson & Pattiaratchi 2020).\n\nSocio-economic effects\n\nClimate change poses risks to the socio-economic wellbeing of the people and industries of NSW. At their extremes, climate-driven events like natural disasters can have very significant economic, fiscal and social impacts (NSW Treasury 2021) – with the 2019–20 bushfire season a high-profile recent example. For communities, livelihoods can be disrupted through damage to homes and other property, services and businesses, impacts on physical and mental health, and in some instances, fatalities (United Nations 2020). Costs can be significant, with some impacts still felt months and years after the disaster.\n\nAgriculture, fisheries and forestry\n\nThe $15.4 billion (2016–17) NSW primary industries sector operates in one of the most variable climates in the world. Primary industries are already experiencing the effects of climate change, mainly due to rising temperatures, but also due to lower than average winter and spring rainfall in some areas (see Changes in climate section).\n\nDespite operating in an environment of substantial climate variability, the agricultural sector has maintained relatively high rates of productivity. There is still considerable uncertainty about future regional rainfall patterns and the impacts of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations on plant growth, so there will be challenges and opportunities for existing and emerging industries.\n\nThe trend towards decreased winter and spring rainfall will generally threaten dryland broadacre crop yields. However, higher carbon dioxide concentrations under climate change may benefit crop growth and could offset some decline in rainfall. The interaction between higher carbon dioxide and lower rainfall levels and increased evapotranspiration (a process transferring water from the ground to the atmosphere) needs to be better understood. Due to lower rainfall and inflows into major water storages, irrigated crops are likely to face reduced water supplies. However, a reduction in the number of cooler days under climate change may benefit major irrigated crops such as rice and cotton, which are sensitive to cool temperatures at key times in their production cycle.\n\nRising temperatures are likely to pose challenges for horticulture and viticulture. Higher minimum temperatures, for example, are likely to reduce essential winter chill and reduce yields for some fruit and nut crops, such as cherries. Some wineries are reporting that harvesting is now occurring several weeks earlier than in the past and that the climate is becoming too warm to produce good quality crops of some premium grape varieties. Earlier harvesting is also affecting labour and infrastructure capacity as multiple grape varieties need to be picked at the same time.\n\nClimate change is likely to have mixed effects on livestock. While higher carbon dioxide levels may promote pasture growth, higher temperatures and less rainfall at key times will affect the quantity and quality of pasture production and more than offset these gains.\n\nImpacts of climate change will vary with production in higher rainfall/cooler areas of the state more resilient to climate change than lower rainfall/warmer areas. Higher minimum temperatures in winter may reduce stock losses from cold snaps. Conversely, increases in maximum temperatures will increase heat stress and result in decreased animal health and productivity. Warmer temperatures will also influence the geographic distribution and intensity of diseases caused by parasites, potentially increasing pests and diseases.\n\nIn the forestry sector, higher concentrations of carbon dioxide are likely to result in increased woody growth rates, but these effects may be counteracted by reduced soil nutrient and moisture levels. There is also more risk of bushfires and damage from pests. Climate change may result in the development of new bioclimatic niches for weeds, pests and diseases, which may lead to increased biosecurity issues for some regions or primary industry sectors.\n\nIncreasing temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns will also affect the migration and breeding patterns of freshwater fish, as well as altering their habitat and food sources (DPI 2018). Increasing temperatures will see marine fish species moving to new areas and changing their ranges along the coast. These issues will provide challenges but also opportunities if commercial and recreational fish industries can focus on different species.\n\nHuman health\n\nClimate change affects human health and wellbeing. Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security and economic growth are projected to increase as climate change continues (IPCC 2018).\n\nThe impacts of climate change make the symptoms of many health conditions worse, with vulnerable groups across the community particularly at risk (Hime et al. 2018). More frequent and intense weather affects health delivery service, with potential increases in visits to emergency departments, hospitalisations and death (Borchers-Arriagada et al. 2020, Vardoulakis et al. 2020). These events also affect electricity supply, transport and communication systems, which in turn affect the ability to meet an increased health services demand (Rychetnik, Sainsbury & Stewart 2019).\n\nStudies have identified that increasing temperatures and more frequent and intense heatwaves result in more heat-related symptoms and deaths (see Hime et al. 2018 and references). Examples include exacerbation of the symptoms of heart and lung disease (Rychetnik, Sainsbury & Stewart 2019). Increased temperatures also lead to specific effects, for example the urban heat island effect (see Urban heat section).\n\nClimate change has been linked to bushfire weather becoming increasingly frequent and of greater intensity in south eastern Australia (van Oldenborgh et al. 2021, Dowdy et al. 2019), resulting in more days of reduced air quality due to bushfire smoke (Di Virgilio et al. 2021). People with asthma and other respiratory conditions, diabetes and cardiovascular illness are most at risk from poor air quality, particularly fine particulate matter (Vardoulakis et al. 2020). Climate change can also affect pollen production, leading to worsened respiratory conditions and allergic conditions such as hay fever (Beggs 2018).\n\nClimate change and its corresponding events such as floods, heavy downpours and droughts negatively affect mental health, particularly among young people and populations in regional areas. In NSW’s northern rivers region, many residents reported mental health impacts from the 2017 floods (Longman et al. 2019). Farmers and regional communities experiencing decreased productivity and incomes due to drought are at increased risk of depression and suicide (Yazd et al. 2019).\n\nEconomic and fiscal impacts\n\nIn 2019–20, the NSW government spent a record amount on natural disaster relief following the weakest economic output from the agricultural sector in a decade due to prolonged drought and a dramatic and damaging bushfire season (NSW Treasury 2021).\n\nDepending on the climate in the future, NSW can expect an increase in the economic impacts of climate change by 2061. Dollar values below are based on modelling conducted by NSW Treasury for the 2021–22 NSW Intergenerational Report which assessed four key physical climate risks (NSW Treasury 2021).\n\nEconomic impacts could include, by 2061:\n\nthe annual total economic costs of natural disasters to increase to $15.8–$17.2 billion, up from $5.1 billion in 2020–21\n\ndirect economic costs to increase to $2.7–$2.9 billion, up from $870 million in 2020–21\n\ndirect fiscal costs (as measured through annual NSW Government Disaster Recovery Arrangements) to increase to $630–$700 million, up from $200 million in 2020–21\n\ntotal economic costs from bushfires to increase to $830 million–$1.01 billion, up from $270 million in 2020–21\n\ntotal economic costs from flooding to increase to $7.8–$8.7 billion, up from $2.5 billion in 2020–21\n\ntotal economic costs from storms to increase to $5.5–$5.7 billion, up from $1.8 billion in 2020–21.\n\nWith regards to the impacts of natural hazards, the NSW Treasury estimates the following by 2061:\n\nbetween 39,000 and 46,000 coastal properties will be exposed to coastal erosion and tidal inundation as a result of sea level rise, at a cost of $850 million– $1.3 billion a year\n\nbetween 700,000 and 2.7 million additional days of work will be lost due to more and hotter heatwaves\n\nproductivity loss in agriculture will cost $750 million–$1.5 billion from changes in rainfall patterns, runoff and temperatures.\n\nClimate change will also increase the indirect and intangible costs of natural disasters, which already include:\n\nincreased mortality, and decreased physical and mental health – the estimated health costs associated with air quality and smoke from the 2019–20 NSW bushfires were $1.1 billion, including premature death and hospitalisation (Johnston et al. 2021)\n\ndestroyed Aboriginal cultural heritage – the 2019–20 bushfires damaged thousands of significant cultural sites representing tens of thousands of years of history (Pickrell 2020)\n\nbiodiversity and wilderness loss – since 2013, bushfires have resulted in a 39% reduction in the ecological carrying capacity of NSW (DPIE 2020a)\n\nloss of business and tourism – there has been a loss of tourism and longer lasting reputational damage, particularly in the south coast region of NSW which was hard-hit by the 2019–20 bushfires.\n\nNSW Climate Change Policy Framework\n\nIn November 2016, the government released its NSW Climate Change Policy Framework with the objectives to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and make NSW more resilient to a changing climate. The framework articulates the state’s endorsement of the Paris Agreement and sets key policy directions for mitigation and adaptation. For adaptation, directions include:\n\ntaking advantage of opportunities to develop new industries in NSW\n\nreducing risks and damage to public and private assets in NSW arising from climate change\n\nreducing climate change impacts on health and wellbeing\n\nmanaging impacts on natural resources, ecosystems and communities.\n\nIn line with the policy framework, several long-term planning strategies set goals for the government to build the state's resilience to climate impacts and to prepare for changes in the climate.\n\nNSW climate change adaptation strategy and statements\n\nOn 29 September 2021 in the Net Zero Plan Stage 1: 2020–2030 Implementation Update the NSW Government committed to develop an adaptation strategy for NSW that sets out the Government’s strategic approach to preparing the State to manage the impacts of climate change. This strategy is currently under development.\n\nIn the same announcement the NSW Government also committed to develop and publish biennial climate change impact, risk and adaptation statements which set out the economic, financial and physical impacts, risks and opportunities of climate change on the State across various climate scenarios. The statements will be consistent with the framework established by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and other relevant international guidance or standards, which will be peer reviewed by an appropriately qualified person, such as an auditor. The statements will be prepared on a whole of Government basis to address the impacts, risks and opportunities of climate change on the NSW Government and the State as a whole. The NSW Government has also committed to pilot entity-specific TCFD statements for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Environment Protection Authority and Essential Energy.\n\nThese two initiatives will help achieve the objective of making NSW more resilient to a changing climate set under the NSW Climate Change Policy Framework.\n\n2021–22 NSW Intergenerational Report\n\nThe 2021–22 NSW Intergenerational Report is a snapshot of the future to inform future policies. The report projects 40 years ahead to 2061 to understand ways the State’s population, economy and finances may change based on global and local trends, and current policies.\n\nThe report examines key long-term challenges associated with an ageing population, growing expenditure and rapid transformation in the economy, as well as climate change. The aim is to better understand ways that NSW can maintain a modern, diversified economy to ensure continued prosperity. A strong economy, supported by productivity-raising reform, high-quality services and responsible fiscal management will enable the NSW Government to help build the collective wealth of the people of NSW, and create resilience to challenges, shocks and uncertainty.\n\nNSW 2040 Economic Blueprint\n\nThe NSW 2040 Economic Blueprint sets the direction for the state’s continued success in a changing world and expanding global economy. Launched by the Treasurer on 20 November 2019, it identifies challenges and risks and highlights major opportunities for the NSW Government to develop industries, innovate and improve the economy.\n\nThe report outlines a range of key aspirations for NSW to reach by 2040:\n\nthe nation’s first trillion-dollar economy\n\nhealthy, productive people\n\nliveable and connected cities\n\nproductive, vibrant regions\n\ninnovative and world class businesses\n\na sustainable environment with reliable and affordable energy\n\nenhanced performance of government.\n\nThe report highlights opportunities to build resilience and adapt to climate change across an array of different NSW Government activities.\n\nDesign and Place State Environmental Planning Policy\n\nThe new Design and Place State Environmental Planning Policy (SEPP) aims to put place shared responsibility to sustain healthy, thriving communities at the forefront of development. The SEPP spans places of all scales, from precincts, large developments, and buildings to infrastructure and public space.\n\nThe SEPP includes design requirements around climate change, with an emphasis on design for resilience and sustainability. These new design requirements will help make the built environment more resilient as the climate changes.\n\nThe SEPP is planned for final release at the end of 2021.\n\nFuture Ready Regions\n\nFuture Ready Regions is the NSW Government’s commitment to build strong communities and diversified regional economies that are built to survive drought and thrive as the climate changes.\n\nThe strategy identifies 14 commitments to:\n\nachieve sustainable, secure and healthy water resources\n\nbuild stronger primary industries prepared for drought\n\nsupport stronger communities and diverse regional economies.\n\nThese commitments draw on the lessons learnt from the worst drought on record to help future-proof regional NSW.\n\nThis strategy will evolve and adapt over time, with an update planned for 2022 to ensure the NSW Government remains focused on the changing conditions, priorities and needs of regional NSW.\n\n20-Year Economic Vision for Regional NSW\n\nThe 20-Year Economic Vision for Regional NSW, released in 2018, sets out the government’s priorities and plans to achieve long-term social and economic success for regional communities across the state. The 2018 vision has been changed in response to the changed economic landscape and opportunities that have emerged in regional NSW following the drought, bushfires, flood and COVID-19 pandemic. The vision covers initiatives that will help build the resilience of regional NSW to climate change.\n\nStrategic planning for natural hazards\n\nClimate change will escalate and intensify certain natural hazards. The NSW Government is committed to building sustainable and hazard-resilient communities through smart land use planning. The Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) has developed a draft statewide natural hazards package that encourages councils to consider natural hazard risk in strategic land use planning. With building regulation and emergency management, smart planning can increase community wellbeing and build resilience to natural hazards.\n\nThe natural hazards package is currently under development is planned for release in the near future.\n\nNSW Water Strategy and regional and metropolitan water strategies\n\nThe NSW Government released its 20-year statewide NSW Water Strategy and 12 regional and two metropolitan water strategies in August 2021. These set out the approach to maintain and build the resilience of the state’s water resources over the coming decades, including in response to climate change.\n\nThe strategies address key challenges and opportunities for water management and service delivery across the state and, set the long-term strategic direction for the NSW water sector as the climate changes.\n\nState Infrastructure Strategy 2018–2038\n\nThe State Infrastructure Strategy 2018–2038 prioritises making the state’s $300 billion asset base resilient to shocks and stresses such as floods, bushfires and storms. Strategies include:\n\nimproving the collection and sharing of data on natural hazards\n\nundertaking regular assessments of the vulnerability of assets\n\nconsidering natural hazards in land-use planning\n\nundertaking investment assessments for new and upgraded infrastructure.\n\nFuture Transport 2056 Strategy\n\nThe Future Transport 2056 Strategy commits to making the transport network more resilient to greater extremes of weather and more frequent extreme weather events.\n\nGreater Sydney Region Plan and Regional Plans\n\nThe Greater Sydney Region Plan and Regional Plans for 10 state planning regions across NSW include strategies to minimise the impacts of climate change on local communities. For example, the Greater Sydney Region Plan and accompanying District Plans proposes to strengthen Sydney’s resilience to climate change by increasing the urban tree canopy to reduce the impact of extreme heat and to use energy and water resources more efficiently.\n\nCoastal Management Framework\n\nThe NSW Government’s new Coastal Management Framework, which started in 2018, establishes a new strategic land-use planning framework for coastal management. This requires local councils to prepare management programs that consider the effects of climate change on coastal processes. It also includes a Coastal Management SEPP and local planning direction, which requires councils and other planning authorities to consider current and future hazards in strategic planning when assessing coastal development proposals.\n\nState Level Emergency Risk Assessment\n\nThe government’s 2017 State Level Emergency Risk Assessment made recommendations to integrate climate change impacts and adaptation mechanisms into emergency management arrangements.\n\nNational Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy\n\nIn October 2021 the Australian Government released the new National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy 2021–2025. This Strategy builds on the first national adaptation strategy released in 2015. The Strategy positions Australia to better anticipate, manage and adapt to climate change.\n\nThe strategy sets out what the Australian Government will do to support efforts across all levels of government, businesses and the community, to better anticipate, manage and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The strategy recognises that adaptation is a shared responsibility that requires sustained and ongoing action. It operates across four domains – natural, built, social and economic.\n\nThe strategy details three objectives to enable more effective adaptation across Australia:\n\nObjective 1 - Drive investment and action through collaboration\n\nObjective 2 - Improve climate information and services\n\nObjective 3 - Assess progress and improve over time.\n\nThe Strategy is expected to support the extensive adaptation efforts already underway in NSW. The NSW Government is currently working with the Australian Government to implement the Strategy\n\nNational Drought Agreement\n\nNSW policy on drought is linked to the National Drought Agreement. The agreement builds on drought policy reform and prioritises objectives and outcomes that enhance long-term preparedness, sustainability, resilience and risk management for farms and farming communities in Australia. The agreement describes the way Commonwealth, state and territory governments will cooperate and collaborate on drought-related issues.\n\nNational approach to Agriculture and Climate Change\n\nAgricultural ministers committed to a coordinated national approach to addressing climate change in 2019. A work program has been developed to support the agricultural sector in adapting to climate change and managing emissions. The work program will support a collaborative approach between jurisdictions, focused on four priorities:\n\ndelivering information and tools for better decisions and risk management\n\ndriving research and innovation to support adaptation and mitigation\n\nstrengthening market opportunities and business models to build resilience\n\npreparing for increasing biosecurity risks as the risk of pest, disease and weed incursions change.\n\nA Climate Change Task Group will oversee delivery of the work program and report to AGSOC and Ministers on progress.\n\nElectric Vehicle (EV) Strategy\n\nThe NSW Government recently released an EV strategy to make NSW the easiest place to buy and drive an EV in Australia. Under the strategy, the government aims to increase EV sales to more than 50% of new cars sold in NSW by 2030 and for EVs to be the main new cars sold in NSW by 2035. The government is introducing new measures to reduce the upfront cost of purchasing an EV by:\n\nwaiving stamp duty for EVs under $78,000\n\nproviding $3,000 rebates for the first 25,000 EVs sold under $68,750\n\noffering incentives for medium-sized to large fleet buyers, such as local councils, car hire and car share companies, to purchase EVs.\n\nThe NSW Government is also:\n\ninvesting $171 million to build a widespread, world-class EV charging network\n\nincentivising the private sector to build ultra-fast charging stations every 100km along all major NSW highways, every 5km along metropolitan commuter corridors and in areas with limited off-street parking\n\ninstalling chargers at public transport sites such as commuter car parks\n\nproviding grants to regional businesses to provide chargers at regional tourist locations.\n\nThe government is also deferring the introduction of a road user charge (RUC) for EVs to July 2027 or when EVs make up at least 30% of new car sales. The new RUC will replace stamp duty on EVs and help replace declining revenue from fuel excise, ensuring that the government has the sustainable funding to undertake critical roadwork over the coming decades.\n\nThe NSW Government supports a range of programs that develop, support and provide information and data to inform communities, businesses, State government agencies and local governments about climate change.\n\nNSW Climate Change Fund\n\nThe Climate Change Fund was established to address the impacts of climate change, encourage energy and water saving activities and increase public awareness and acceptance of climate change.\n\nIt was established in 2007 under Part 6A of the Energy and Utilities Administration Act 1987 and is administered by DPIE. The key programs under the Fund include:\n\ndelivering energy savings and reducing emissions\n\ndelivering reliable, clean and affordable energy\n\nincreasing resilience to a changing climate.\n\nUnder the Fund the NSW Government is investing over $900 million between 2017 and 2022 on adaptation and resilience programs. These extensive programs include supporting local communities, protecting our national parks, preparing for bushfires and planting more trees. The Fund supports many of the initiatives outlined in this chapter.\n\nNSW and ACT Regional Climate Modelling project\n\nThe NSW and ACT Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) project is a world-leading climate modelling program developed in partnership with the ACT Government with contributions from the University of NSW. The first generation of climate data, NARCliM1.0, was released in 2014 and produced climate projections at 10 km resolution for south-east Australia and 50 km resolution over all Australia in 20-year intervals (1990–2009, 2020–2039 and 2060–2079) (Evans et al. 2014).\n\nIn 2020, the updated NARCliM1.5 added to the efficiency of the earlier NARCliM1.0 with newer global climate models, expanded continuous projections (1950–2100), and two future scenarios with different levels of greenhouse gas emissions. (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Together, NARCliM1.0 and 1.5 provide an improved, more comprehensive data set to measure potential climate change impacts, research adaptation strategies, and develop local policies to mitigate climate change effects Nishant et al. 2021).\n\nDPIE is developing NARCliM2.0, which uses the latest global climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment report (AR6), and will generate climate projections at finer spatial resolution than previous versions of NARCliM.\n\nNARCliM data has been used in this chapter to inform Spotlight figure 21, Figure 21.5, Figures 21.6–7 and Map 21.2.\n\nTo find out how to use NARCliM climate data, email [email protected].\n\nNSW Climate Data Portal\n\nThe NSW Climate Data Portal provides NARCliM climate data and data products in various formats, suitable for users ranging from curious citizens and academics to professional and government decision-makers. Data sets cover a broad range of climate variables and are available by greenhouse gas concentration scenario and user-selected extents and time periods. The portal includes tools so users can search, explore and download specific subsets of the data they are interested in. The portal provides data from all available NARCliM scenarios and will include all associated products produced by DPIE including high-resolution downscaled temperature and precipitation data sets and projections of natural hazards under climate change.\n\nAdaptNSW website\n\nThe AdaptNSW website provides comprehensive climate change information, analysis and data to support action to address climate change risks and capture opportunities. It includes:\n\nclimate projections\n\ninformation on the causes of climate change\n\nlikely impacts on biodiversity, bushfires, east coast lows, heat, sea level, coasts, rivers, soil, water resources, human health, cultural values, built environment and the economy\n\ninformation on regional climate change vulnerabilities\n\nguidance and case studies on implementing adaptive responses to climate change for households, community groups, business and government.\n\nThis video is an example of the kinds of projects ADAPT NSW supports (5.30 minutes)\n\nClimate Change Information and Knowledge Delivery Program\n\nThe Climate Information and Knowledge Delivery program is helping NSW build resilience to climate change by equipping governments and communities with information, knowledge and the capacity to respond to impacts. In 2020–21, the program continued to increase NSW’s resilience to climate change impacts and natural hazards, by ensuring that:\n\ndecision makers can assess and address the risks of climate change using consistent, integrated and accurate information\n\nstakeholders better understand sectoral, regional and local risks and opportunities to respond to identified impacts.\n\nEcosystem Adaptation Program\n\nThe Ecosystem Adaptation Program supports NSW land managers to build climate change adaptation into the protection of biodiversity and culture, including:\n\nworking across both publicly- and privately-owned land\n\nassessing strategic plans for climate change impacts\n\nproviding technical management solutions for threatened species and cultural values.\n\nThis program also delivers World Heritage Adaptation Action plans, the Climate Ready Revegetation program and, as lead program, the Marine Estate Management Strategy Initiative 3: Climate change actions.\n\nNSW Aboriginal Culture Adaptation Program\n\nThis program is a priority action in the Our Place on Country Aboriginal Outcomes Strategy 2020–23. This strategy includes supporting pilot Aboriginal landholders and their communities in strategic planning for climate adaptation.\n\nClimate Risk Ready NSW Program\n\nThe Climate Risk Ready NSW Program aims to increase the capability and capacity of NSW state and local government agencies to respond to increasing climate change impacts. In 2021, through the program, the Climate Risk Ready NSW Guide was delivered and a nationally accredited course with Western Sydney University was launched to build skills in climate change risk assessment and management.\n\nThe program continues to deliver policy integration, collaborative governance initiatives and capability building.\n\nXDI (Cross Dependency Initiative) NSW Project\n\nThe XDI NSW Project commenced in 2020, following an internationally award-winning pilot project delivered with five asset owners in the Sydney Basin. The scaled up XDI NSW Project provides owners and operators of critical infrastructure in NSW with a tool that:\n\nsupports them in understanding how their assets may be affected by natural hazards and climate change now and in the future\n\nenables them to make more informed decisions about how to plan and manage their assets\n\nprovides a risk assessment that estimates potential damage, costs, disruption and interdependency with other infrastructure, noting that climate risk assessments will always involve some uncertainty.\n\nIdentification interdependencies encourages asset owners to work together on asset management and share costs of adaptation, potentially making considerable savings compared with adapting their own assets and improving the resilience of community service delivery.\n\nIntegrated Regional Vulnerability Assessments\n\nIntegrated Regional Vulnerability Assessments have been completed for 11 regions across NSW, involving over 1,500 state and local government representatives. These assessments identify ways that climate change can create vulnerabilities in key regional systems through socio-economic and demographic change, and provide strategies to respond through planning and delivering government services. In 2020 the Hunter Central Coast was the last region to complete an assessment.\n\nAn adaptation strategy is now being developed to identify priority actions and measures of success that can be monitored and guided by cross-agency regional leadership.\n\nIncreasing Resilience to Climate Change\n\nThe NSW Government is helping local councils and communities adapt to climate change by investing in programs that help reduce exposure to natural hazards and other climate risks. The Increasing Resilience to Climate Change (IRCC) grants program has:\n\nprovided nearly $1.3 million for 62 councils to implement 21 climate change adaptation projects across the state\n\nawarded grants across multiple rounds, totalling $3.4 million, to support 54 council and community-led projects to respond locally to the impacts of climate change\n\nin grant round 1, awarded $615,659 to 23 community groups – between $10,000–$30,000 per project was awarded to help NSW communities increase their resilience and reduce the impacts from climate change.\n\nIn 2020–2021, the third and final round of IRCC councils grants awarded $611,700 to eight councils, bringing the total number of projects funded since June 2019 to 31, with a total value of $2,867,230.\n\nThese projects are helping local councils and community groups to adapt, foster partnerships and manage climate change impacts by being able to better plan, prepare for, and respond to heatwaves, storms, floods, drought and bushfires.\n\nThe grantees will deliver their projects by March 2022.\n\nNSW Climate Change Adaptation Research Hub\n\nEstablished in 2012, the NSW Climate Change Adaptation Research Hub is a collaboration between leading NSW universities and DPIE. All research was concluded in 2020.\n\nThe hub has delivered over 70 research projects that are supporting climate change adaptation across four priority areas:\n\nbiodiversity\n\nadaptive communities\n\ncoastal processes and responses\n\nhuman health and social impacts.\n\nFive Million Trees Program\n\nDPIE is helping to increase the urban tree canopy in Sydney from 16% to 40% by 2036, through the Five Million Trees (5MT) program. The trees will provide more shade, enhanced biodiversity, cooler suburbs and improved thermal comfort for communities to adapt to increasing temperatures and more frequent heatwaves. The 5MT program includes case study sites, pilot projects, community engagement initiatives, a behaviour change project, and grants to enable organisations and communities to plant trees in their local area.\n\nOther programs\n\nMany other natural resource management programs incorporate a consideration of climate change and the development of resilience in their objectives and delivery. These include:\n\nEnhanced Bushfire Management Program, which is designed to improve hazard reduction and bushfire response capabilities to protect against increasing fire risks due to the impacts of climate change\n\nprivate land conservation – the NSW Government has provided $240 million in funding through the Biodiversity Conservation Trust to support willing landholders to manage their land for conservation and increase their resilience to climate change\n\nprotected area management, which supports the delivery of infrastructure and works in NSW National Parks to build resilience to climate change and other pressures and increase awareness of the importance of adaptation\n\nNSW Forest Monitoring and Improvement Program, which aims to assess the health and stability of soil in forests, and their predicted trajectory into the future, by focusing on actions on to improve soil health and stability – climate change is a major consideration\n\nThe Primary Industries Climate Change Research Strategy, which focuses on the areas of energy, carbon opportunities and climate resilience – research, pilots and trials are providing information on investment opportunities in renewable energy and efficiency, the feasibility of different carbon farming opportunities, and ways climate change will impact on primary industries and digital technology can support adaptation\n\nMarine Estate Management Strategy – this strategy includes over 100 projects covering planning, programs and research to address key threats to coastal, estuarine and marine ecosystems."
