        "text": "Monthly Precipitation Summary Water Year 2024\n\n(Oct 1, 2023 to Sep 30, 2024)\n\nUpdated: Tue Aug 13 2024 at 03:00:02 AM\n\nThe following is data from National Weather Service cooperative observers as of the end of last month. The water year starts on October 1 of the previous reference year and ends on September 30 of the reference year. Precipitation data is provided for each month of the most recent water year, total precipitation for the water year, the percent of normal for the water year to date, and the percent of the entire water year we have received to date.\n\nM stands for Missing Data. WY means Water Year. NA means that 30-year averages do not exist for this station. The unit of precipitation is INCHES.\n\nIf a station has any missing data, its WY-to-Date total will also be missing. In addition, the percent of normal will not be calculated.\n\nNote, monthly data is collected during the first week of the following month and will be posted to this webpage when received from the National Weather Service cooperative observers. As an example, December data will typically be posted sometime during the first week of January.\n\nAny questions about this product should be directed to the CNRFC."
