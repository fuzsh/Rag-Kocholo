        "text": "Pesticide Exposure: Another Growing Hazard for Farmworkers in a Changing Climate\n\nClimate change is altering many pest populations in the U.S., including via northern expansion of blacklegged tick populations, accelerated geographic spread and population growth of the spotted lanternfly, and increased duration of active periods of the codling moth, peach twig borer, and oriental fruit moth in California. This spread of agricultural pests, along with increased susceptibility of plants to invasive pests due to elevated CO2 and reductions in pesticide efficacy predicted with climate change, is increasing the use of pesticides—chemicals that are commonly used to manage pest populations.\n\nFarmworkers, due to approximately 75% of pesticide use in the U.S. occurring in agricultural settings, and on the front lines of this increasing hazard. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 pesticide poisonings among farmworkers are diagnosed in the U.S. annually. Workers applying pesticides face the highest exposure with their greatest exposure occurring during the mixing and loading processes (i.e., when the pesticides are in a concentrated state and there is a higher chance of spilling). Farmworkers working in sprayed fields are also at risk of high pesticide exposure and are less likely to use personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect themselves compared to those directly involved in the application process.\n\nAcute health effects vary by pesticide type but can range from headache and dizziness to tremor and seizure. Acute occupational illnesses are tracked by the CDC-NIOSH Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risk (SENSOR), a state-based surveillance program. In 2007–2011, 2,606 cases of acute occupational pesticide-related illness and injury were reported across 12 states. Of these cases, the rate of illness and injury among agricultural workers was 37 times greater than the rate for nonagricultural workers.\n\nIncreasing Vibrio Threat with Warming Waters: Be Careful with Open Wounds\n\nVibrio vulnificus (V. vulnificus) are bacteria that live in coastal waters. They can get into an open wound of any size through salt water or brackish water (i.e., a mixture of fresh and salt water often found where rivers meet the ocean), or through drippings from raw seafood. Vibrio vulnificus wound infections are rare but serious. Treating these infections can require intensive care or limb amputations. About 1 in 5 people die from the infection.\n\nV. vulnificus bacteria thrive in warmer waters—especially during the summer months (May to October) and in moderately salty environments like estuaries. Increasing water temperatures and extreme weather events (such as heat waves, flooding, and severe storms) associated with climate change create more favorable conditions for V. vulnificus. People at increased risk for V. vulnificus infection should takesteps to prevent an infection when enjoying coastal activities. CDC's Vibrio website provides additional information about Vibrio bacteria and the infections they cause.\n\nTickborne Diseases and Conditions\n\nTickborne diseases—when a person has been bitten by a tick and gets sick—are increasingly threatening the health of people in the U.S. Tickborne diseases include Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, spotted fever rickettsioses (including Rocky Mountain spotted fever), and tularemia, as shown on the map below. Lyme disease is the most common tickborne illness in the U.S., with an estimated 476,000 Americans diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease and an economic burden between $345 million and $968 million each year (in 2016 U.S. dollars). Early localized symptoms can include a rash at the site of tick bite (occurring in 70–80% of infected persons), fever, chills, malaise, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, joint stiffness, and swelling of lymph nodes. Patients who have Lyme disease are often not even aware of a tick bite before getting sick. Untreated Lyme disease can progress to disseminated disease and produce a wide range of symptoms including additional rashes, facial paralysis, an irregular heartbeat, and arthritis.\n\nFigure: Geographic distribution of select tickborne diseases. For more information, visit the interactive map at https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/data-research/facts-stats/geographic-distribution-of-tickborne-disease-cases.html\n\nTick bites can also lead to conditions such as alpha-gal syndrome (AGS), a potentially life-threatening allergy to red meat and consumer products made from mammals. Evidence suggests that AGS is primarily associated with the bite of a lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) in the U.S., but other kinds of ticks have not been ruled out. People with AGS have delayed allergic reactions to a sugar molecule called alpha-gal, which can be found in pork, beef, rabbit, lamb, venison, gelatin, and dairy. Patients with AGS have varying tolerance and sensitivity to products containing alpha-gal, and AGS reactions can vary, ranging from mild to life-threatening. A 2023 CDC report investigating testing data showed that there were more than 110,000 suspected cases of AGS between 2010 and 2022. Additionally, suspected cases are on the rise—from 2017 to 2021, there were approximately 15,000 new positive test results for AGS in the U.S. per year. Another CDC report identified gaps in healthcare provider awareness of AGS, finding 42% of participating healthcare providers had never heard of AGS. Therefore, the number of identified suspect cases of AGS from 2010–2021 is likely an underestimate of the true burden of disease because the diagnosis of AGS requires a clinical exam and a positive diagnostic test.\n\nMalaria\n\nFor the first time since 2003, the U.S. has had locally acquired cases of malaria in Florida, Texas, and Maryland. Malaria is a serious mosquito-borne disease caused by different species of Plasmodium parasites that infect Anopheles species mosquitoes. People typically become infected with malaria following the bite of a mosquito carrying the parasite.\n\nThere are about 2,000 reported cases of malaria in the U.S. each year, mostly in travelers returning from other countries. Continuous spread of malaria was eliminated in the U.S. in the early 1950s through mosquito surveillance and control measures; however, as we’ve seen this summer, locally acquired malaria cases do still occur in the U.S.\n\nAnopheles species mosquitoes can be found in much of the continental U.S., making local spread possible if people infected in a malaria-endemic country travel to the U.S. and are bitten by local Anopheles mosquitoes, which can then become infected and spread the parasite to people who have not traveled. The risk for local transmission is higher in areas where local climatic conditions allow Anopheles mosquitoes to survive during all or most of the year. Temperatures also need to be warm enough for the malaria parasite to develop in the mosquito. This summer, the U.S. has had plenty of the hot and humid conditions in which mosquitoes thrive, as well as increased international travel, potentially contributing to local spread.\n\nWhile local malaria transmission in the U.S. is rare, it is possible that increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns and humidity due to climate change may lead to increased mosquito populations, increased range of Anopheles mosquitoes, a greater number of mosquito biting days, and faster development of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes, all of which could impact local transmission in the U.S. in the future."
