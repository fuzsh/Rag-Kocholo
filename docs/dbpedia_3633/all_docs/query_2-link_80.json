        "text": "31st Annual Ride Exploring Greater Los Padres National Forest Area\n\n17 – 22 June 2024\n\nHello all,\n\nAs I stated in the last Siren, In October of 2023, President Wayne and I escorted a group of disabled military veteran bicyclists thru back roads of the central coastal valleys. The routes were scenic, well-paved, challenging, and most of all fun. This year’s MMOC 31st annual ride will have a strong resemblance to the route President Wayne and I rode last October. For those in the Eastbay, my thoughts are to meet in Pleasanton (17 June) and then ride to Santa Maria CA. (via Hwy 17 and Santa Cruz) to the Santa Maria Inn. After the ride and check-in, a great dinner at Shaw’s Steakhouse just across the street will be just what we need. Santa Maria Inn will be our headquarters for the trip and there are numerous good rides and restaurants in the area.\n\nFrom the Santa Maria Inn, we will venture out to ride on a mix of backcountry roads and some time on highways (not much time on those). We can ride and stop at several cities and places of interest. Some of those cities are Pismo Beach (Old West Cinnamon rolls a must in Pismo Beach) Orcutt, Santa Ynez Valley, Neverland front gate, Solvang which has a motorcycle museum, Hearst Castle, and several other stops on our ride.\n\nThe weather during this ride will be brisk at times, so plan to wear warm riding gear, and don’t forget rain gear. Room rates at Santa Maria Inn will be very reasonable at $109 + tax & fees per night for a 2 queen bedroom. We have reserved only four rooms based on the membership’s level of interest to date. If you intend to join us please contact me ASAP so I can plan for more rooms, if needed. If you want to go for a ride but don’t want to stay away for the full week, you can stop by for a day or two and then head back home. This will be a good ride; I hope to see as many of our MMOC members who can make it on the ride.\n\nHotel info:\n\nSanta Maria Inn\n\n801 S. Broadway\n\nSanta Maria, CA 93454\n\n(805) 928-7777 (mention “MMOC” when making reservations)\n\nEd Pressnell\n\nMMOC Ride Director\n\nDeweys76@aol.com\n\n510 301-1804"
