That spike in global temperatures is fueling climate disasters that will only get worse unless we take action. Experts warn that we are running out of time to dramatically cut pollution to avoid climate catastrophe.\n\nRead on to learn more, find out what Earthjustice is doing to help the planet change course, and how you can help.\n\n1. Wildfires burn longer and wider\n\nLarger fires in hot, dry years\n\nWildfires have always been a natural part of life in the western United States and Canada. However, as this region grows hotter and drier, wildfires are growing in size, ferocity, and speed.\n\nThe hazardous air pollution that wildfire smoke creates can spread far beyond the region burned. In summer 2023, smoke wafting down from nearly 900 wildfires tearing through Canada triggered air quality alerts that affected as many as 70 million people across the eastern United States.\n\nAnd then there’s the destruction on the ground.\n\nIn recent years, California has been particulary prone to devastating blazes. With record dry, hot conditions across the state, seasonal high winds (known as Diablo in Northern California and Santa Ana in the southern part of the state) caused wildfires to grow and spread at an unprecedented rate.\n\nCalifornia wildfires burned more than 4 million acres in 2020 — an area larger than Connecticut — making 2020 the biggest fire season in state history. The Camp Fire in 2018 — California’s single most destructive, and deadliest, wildfire in history — destroyed an average of one football field worth of land every three seconds and killed 68 people, according to CAL FIRE.\n\nAnd it’s not just California. Oregon, Washington, and Colorado have also seen explosive fires that have forced thousands to evacuate, claimed lives, and destroyed homes and businesses.\n\nClose Section\n\n2. Extreme heat gets hotter\n\nHeat waves pose health risks and strain our energy system\n\nAs global temperatures rise, the hottest temperatures — and the number of areas impacted by extreme heat — are also rising. That means more scorching hot days in more places.\n\nIn California’s Death Valley this July, thermometers neared the hottest temperature ever recorded, hovering around 130 degrees. That same month, the average global temperature hit an all-time high.\n\nIt’s not just that individual hot days are breaking records — there’s an overall warming trend. Take the Texas cities of Austin and Houston, for example. Over the past 50 years, Austin has seen the number of days with temperatures above 100°F increase by one month, while Houston has recorded an additional month with temperatures above 95°F. In California, temperatures are estimated to have increased 3°F in the past century.\n\nThrough 2100, scientists predict hotter temperatures and more frequent and intense heat waves in every region of the U.S., according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. And the trend transcends borders.\n\nExtreme heat increases demand for air conditioning, fueling carbon pollution and putting a strain our energy system that can lead to blackouts. It also poses a serious health threat, especially for the most vulnerable.\n\nClose Section\n\n3. Hurricanes are becoming more intense\n\nStorm systems draw their energy from warm ocean water\n\nHurricanes are growing more powerful as global temperatures rise because these storm systems draw their energy from warm ocean water.\n\nIn September 2022, major hurricanes struck Florida and Puerto Rico.\n\nHurricane Fiona dumped unprecedented levels of rain and caused catastrophic damage, leaving Puerto Rico residents without electricity or drinking water.\n\nDays later, Hurricane Ian rapidly intensified as it headed towards the Florida coast, giving residents little time to prepare. Scientists warn that this will become more common as our climate warms: storms will not only become stronger, but they will intensify faster.\n\nClose Section\n\n4. Drought conditions persist\n\nMoisture evaporates from waterbodies and soil\n\nHigher temperatures also lead to drier conditions. When global temperatures rise, moisture evaporates from waterbodies and soil.\n\nDroughts in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world have become more severe and long-lasting thanks to climate change.\n\nIn fact, the American West is currently in the midst of a mega drought that ranks among the worst in the past 1,200 years, even after heavy rainfall in 2023. Much of the region is currently facing \"extreme\" or \"exceptional\" drought conditions.\n\n5. Warmer temperatures drive increases in precipitation\n\nAreas that have historically trended toward heavy precipitation will get wetter\n\nWarmer air increases evaporation, which means that our atmosphere contains an increasing amount of water vapor for storms to sweep up and turn into rain or snow.\n\nJust as drier areas are likely to get drier with rising global temperatures, those areas of the world that have historically trended toward heavy precipitation will only get wetter.\n\nHeavy rainfall and flash flooding in the Northeast during July 2023 caused tens of millions of dollars, inundated Vermont's state capital with knee-high waters, and killed at least one person. New rain estimates issued in 2023 indicate that 12.6 million properties across the U.S. that were not previously thought to be at flood risk now are due to the increased likelihood of extreme precipitation events.\n\n6. Sea level rise causes flooding\n\nOceans are warming; land ice is melting\n\nAs the planet warms, ocean waters are also warming — and expanding. At the same time, warmer temperatures are causing land ice — think glaciers and ice caps — to melt, which is adding water to the world’s oceans.\n\nAs a result, average global sea level has increased eight inches in the last 150 years.\n\nThe Atlantic coast of the United States and the Gulf of Mexico are experiencing some of the highest sea level rise in the world, which, combined with record rainfall, has led to catastrophic flooding.\n\n7. Winter storms hit harder\n\nTrapped water vapor leads to heavier snowfall\n\nEven as climate change raises average global temperatures, that doesn’t spell the end of winters. Overall, winters are getting milder and shorter; but recent winters have brought intense snowstorms and record-breaking frost.\n\nAs a result, average global sea level has increased eight inches in the last 150 years.\n\nWhile it may seem contradictory, climate change may be contributing to more extreme winter weather. As the warming atmosphere traps water vapor later and later into the year, that precipitation leads to heavier snowfall when the temperatures do drop.\n\nAnother factor is the rapidly warming Arctic, which some scientists believe is weakening the jet stream and causing disruptions of the polar vortex. The polar vortex refers to bands of wind and low air pressure near the North Pole, which normally lock cold air over Arctic. When those bands break down, icy air can escape south in the form of freezing winters.\n\nIn 2021, record-breaking snowstorms knocked out power for nearly 4.5 million homes in Texas as icy conditions and heating demands overwhelmed much of the region’s power supply. More than a hundred people died, and the storms caused an estimated $295 billion in damage.\n\nClose Section\n\nWhat can we do?\n\nThere is a solution: Break free from fossil fuels\n\nAmericans across the political spectrum are feeling the urgency of our climate deadline and calling for action on a scale that matches the threat. We need bold and equitable climate solutions to move towards a pollution-free, 100% clean energy future.\n\nOur attorneys use the law and partner with communities on the frontlines to tackle the climate crisis. Here are a few examples of the goals we’re working on and the progress we’ve achieved:\n\nMove beyond fossil fuels. Earthjustice has secured the retirement of coal plants generating more than 65,000 megawatts a year and stopped the buildout of more than 8,500 megawatts of methane gas. This work has prevented $16.9 billion a year in climate-related costs.\n\nClear the way for clean energy. We level the playing field and ensure that utilities, regulators, and grid operators don’t discriminate against clean energy. Most recently, we won a legal victory against monopoly utilities in the South who had set up an energy market that effectively propped up gas and coal and excluded independent clean energy generators.\n\nElectrify our economy. Transportation generates more greenhouse gas emissions than any other economic sector in the U.S. Advocacy by Earthjustice and our partners has pushed 10 states home to 100 million people to adopt a zero-emission trucks rule. California, which has the power to shape national industry standards, has also committed to electrifying locomotives and public buses. And at the federal level, we've helped secure billions in funding to electrify ports, school buses, and USPS mail trucks.\n\nMake sure everyone benefits by centering environmental justice and expanding access to clean energy in every community. We supported Puerto Rican advocates in securing $1 billion in federal funding to bring rooftop solar power to low- and moderate-income communities across the territory. This investment will help households keep the power on when hurricanes strike – and we’re fighting for additional funding so that everyone in Puerto Rico can have reliable, safe, and affordable energy.\n\nTake on the next frontiers. To name just a few efforts, we’re protecting climate forests, promoting climate-smart agriculture, stopping the petrochemical buildout, and challenging dirty hydrogen and carbon capture projects that prolong the use of fossil fuels.\n\nThis fight to preserve a livable planet touches everyone. Together, we can drive transformative change in service of the earth and justice for its people.\n\nTake action today\n\nCoal and gas-fired power plants are responsible for more than 30% of U.S. carbon pollution, and they also emit other pollutants that harm our air, water, and health. And yet, there are almost no limits on the amount of climate-warming pollution these plants emit. You can help change that."
