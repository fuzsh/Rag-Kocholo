        "text": "Average temperatures throughout the year\n\nWeather in Florence and Tuscany is generally pretty mild but Florence's location in a valley makes temperatures vary from other areas in Tuscany.\n\nThe warmest months are generally July and August, while June and September are both nice with warm weather without it being too hot. Keep in mind that in August many Italians escape the heat of the city: outside of the historical center, a large number of businesses including shops and restaurants close down for at least two weeks if not the entire month as local shop owners take some vacation off. This tradition is changing and most shops in the center will be open in August.\n\nThe coolest months are December and January, with January being a bit cooler.\n\nNovember is the month with the most precipitation on average but October, December, March and April also generally have a good amount of rain. Make sure to dress in layers!\n\nMONTH AVG HIGHS AVG LOWS January 50 °F (10 °C) 34 °F (1 °C) February 53 °F (12 °C) 37 °F (3 °C) March 59 °F (15 °C) 40 °F (4 °C) April 65 °F (18 °C) 45 °F (7 °C) May 74 °F (23 °C) 52 °F (11 °C) June 81 °F (27 °C) 58 °F (14 °C) July 88 °F (31 °C) 63 °F (17 °C) August 87 °F (31 °C) 62 °F (17 °C) September 79 °F (26 °C) 57 °F (14 °C) October 70 °F (21 °C) 50 °F (10 °C) November 58 °F (14 °C) 41 °F (5 °C) December 50 °F (10 °C) 36 °F (2 °C)\n\nWhat are the best months to visit Florence?\n\nConsidering the weather, we would say Florence's (and Tuscany's) best travel months (also its busiest and most expensive) are April, May, June, September, and October. These months combine the convenience of peak season with pleasant weather.\n\nThe most grueling thing about travel in Florence is the summer heat in July and August, when temperatures hit the high 80s and 90s."
