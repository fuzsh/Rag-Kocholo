In Santa Maria, the chance of a wet day over the course of September is gradually increasing, starting the month at 1% and ending it at 3%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 24% on February 20, and its lowest chance is 0% on July 30.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during September in Santa Maria is essentially constant, remaining about 0.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 0.8 inches or falling below -0.0 inches.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of September in Santa Maria, the length of the day is rapidly decreasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day decreases by 1 hour, 3 minutes, implying an average daily decrease of 2 minutes, 9 seconds, and weekly decrease of 15 minutes, 6 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is September 30, with 11 hours, 50 minutes of daylight and the longest day is September 1, with 12 hours, 52 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe earliest sunrise of the month in Santa Maria is 6:34 AM on September 1 and the latest sunrise is 21 minutes later at 6:56 AM on September 30.\n\nThe latest sunset is 7:27 PM on September 1 and the earliest sunset is 41 minutes earlier at 6:46 PM on September 30.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Santa Maria during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during September, so the entire month is in standard time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:48 AM and sets 14 hours, 31 minutes later, at 8:18 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 7:06 AM and sets 9 hours, 48 minutes later, at 4:54 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment.

The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in September in Santa Maria\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in September in Santa MariaSep11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303012 AM12 AM4 AM4 AM8 AM8 AM12 PM12 PM4 PM4 PM8 PM8 PM12 AM12 AMAugOctAug 44:14 AMAug 44:14 AMAug 1911:26 AMAug 1911:26 AMSep 26:56 PMSep 26:56 PMSep 177:35 PMSep 177:35 PMOct 211:50 AMOct 211:50 AMOct 174:27 AMOct 174:27 AM6:15 AM6:15 AM8:36 PM8:36 PM7:31 PM7:31 PM6:09 AM6:09 AM6:07 AM6:07 AM7:32 PM7:32 PM7:04 PM7:04 PM7:24 AM7:24 AM6:51 AM6:51 AM6:44 PM6:44 PM5:59 PM5:59 PM7:24 AM7:24 AM\n\nSep 2024IlluminationMoonriseMoonsetMoonriseMeridian PassingDistance 1 2%5:08 AMENE7:07 PMWNW-12:11 PMS249,327 mi 2 0%6:07 AMENE7:32 PMWNW-12:52 PMS250,689 mi 3 1%7:05 AME7:55 PMW-1:32 PMS251,687 mi 4 3%8:01 AME8:17 PMW-2:10 PMS252,274 mi 5 7%8:57 AME8:39 PMW-2:49 PMS252,386 mi 6 13%9:53 AMESE9:03 PMWSW-3:28 PMS251,945 mi 7 20%10:50 AMESE9:30 PMWSW-4:10 PMS250,881 mi 8 29%11:50 AMESE10:00 PMWSW-4:55 PMS249,138 mi 9 38%12:51 PMESE10:37 PMWSW-5:44 PMS246,699 mi 10 50%1:53 PMSE11:22 PMSW-6:37 PMS243,603 mi 11 59%2:54 PMSE--7:35 PMS239,965 mi 12 69%-12:16 AMSW3:50 PMSE8:34 PMS235,984 mi 13 79%-1:18 AMSW4:40 PMESE9:34 PMS231,943 mi 14 88%-2:28 AMWSW5:23 PMESE10:32 PMS228,189 mi 15 95%-3:42 AMWSW6:00 PMESE11:28 PMS225,085 mi 16 97%-4:56 AMWSW6:33 PMESE-- 17 100%-6:10 AMW7:04 PME12:21 AMS222,958 mi 18 100%-7:24 AMW7:34 PME1:12 AMS222,036 mi 19 98%-8:38 AMW8:04 PMENE2:03 AMS222,410 mi 20 92%-9:52 AMWNW8:38 PMENE2:55 AMS224,011 mi 21 84%-11:07 AMWNW9:17 PMENE3:49 AMS226,632 mi 22 74%-12:21 PMWNW10:03 PMENE4:45 AMS229,971 mi 23 64%-1:30 PMNW10:55 PMNE5:44 AMS233,687 mi 24 50%-2:31 PMNW11:54 PMNE6:43 AMS237,456 mi 25 41%-3:23 PMNW-7:40 AMS241,017 mi 26 31%12:56 AMENE4:06 PMWNW-8:34 AMS244,187 mi 27 22%2:00 AMENE4:41 PMWNW-9:24 AMS246,863 mi 28 14%3:01 AMENE5:11 PMWNW-10:10 AMS249,006 mi 29 8%4:01 AMENE5:36 PMWNW-10:52 AMS250,620 mi 30 4%4:59 AME6:00 PMW-11:32 AMS251,735 mi\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Santa Maria is essentially constant during September, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 7, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in September in Santa Maria\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Santa Maria is essentially constant during September, remaining within 0.2 miles per hour of 7.4 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on April 25, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 9.7 miles per hour, while on August 9, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.2 miles per hour.\n\nThe wind direction in Santa Maria during September is predominantly out of the west from September 1 to September 16 and the north from September 16 to September 30.\n\nWind Direction in September in Santa Maria\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nWater Temperature\n\nSanta Maria is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake). This section reports on the wide-area average surface temperature of that water.\n\nThe average surface water temperature in Santa Maria is essentially constant during September, remaining around 60Â°F throughout.\n\nThe highest average surface water temperature during September is 61Â°F on September 25.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Santa Maria typically lasts for 11 months (320 days), from around January 27 to around December 12, rarely starting after March 9, or ending before November 17.\n\nThe month of September in Santa Maria is reliably fully within the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in September in Santa Maria\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in September in Santa Mariagrowing seasongrowing seasonSep1122334455667788991010111112121313141415151616171718181919202021212222232324242525262627272828292930300%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%AugOct100%Sep 16100%Sep 16Aug 5100%Aug 5100%NowNowcoldcoolcomfortablewarmvery cold\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Santa Maria are increasing during September, increasing by 367Â°F, from 2,061Â°F to 2,428Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Santa Maria is decreasing during September, falling by 1.4 kWh, from 7.1 kWh to 5.7 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in September in Santa Maria\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Santa Maria are 34.953 deg latitude, -120.436 deg longitude, and 217 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Santa Maria is essentially flat, with a maximum elevation change of 75 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 216 feet. Within 10 miles is essentially flat (2,631 feet). Within 50 miles contains large variations in elevation (6,814 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Santa Maria is covered by artificial surfaces (78%) and cropland (20%), within 10 miles by cropland (39%) and grassland (38%), and within 50 miles by water (38%) and grassland (31%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Santa Maria, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Santa Maria.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Santa Maria according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Santa Maria is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Santa Maria and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nSanta Maria Airport (KSMX, 93%, 4 mi, south, 23 ft elevation change)\n\nSan Luis Obispo County Airport (KSBP, 6%, 23 mi, northwest, -16 ft elevation change)\n\nMeadows Field (KBFL, 0.9%, 85 mi, northeast, 272 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Santa Maria and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
