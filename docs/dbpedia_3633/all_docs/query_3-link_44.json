In the indirect assimilation of radar reflectivity, hydrometeors and water vapor retrieved from reflectivity are assimilated to avoid the nonlinearity issues associated with the observation operator. In a widely applied water vapor retrieval scheme, the cloud is assumed saturated when radar reflectivity is greater than a certain threshold. This study replaces the traditional retrieval scheme with the “Z-RH” (radar reflectivity and relative humidity) linear statistical relationship for estimating the water vapor, which is to reduce the uncertainty caused by empirical relationships. The “Z-RH” relationship is statistically obtained from the humidity and the rainfall rate observations for different temperature intervals with the use of the Z-R (radar reflectivity-rain rate) relationship. The impacts of these two retrieval approaches are investigated on the analyses and forecasts based on the radar reflectivity. The results suggest that both water vapor retrieval schemes yield similar reflectivity analyses, with “Z-RH” showing slightly stronger reflectivity intensity. Utilizing “Z-RH” scheme significantly contributes to the improved analyses and forecasts of humidity and wind fields, resulting in more reasonable thermodynamic and dynamic structures. As the “Z-RH” relationship obtained by real-time statistics in a specific area provides a scientific basis for the retrieval of water vapor, “Z-RH” scheme is beneficial to obtain more accurate reflectivity forecasts. Besides, the overall scores for the predicted precipitation of “Z-RH” are roughly 10%-20% higher compared to those of the traditional scheme.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 26 August 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4114-x\n\nAbstract:\n\nUrbanization’s impact on pre-monsoon extreme rainfall in the Greater Bay Area (GBA), coastal South China (SC), and its relation to different synoptic systems remains understudied. This research investigates urbanization effects on pre-monsoon rainfall using hourly station observations and the Weather Research and Forecasting model with the Single Layer Urban Canopy Model (WRF-SLUCM) simulations. Observations show stronger pre-monsoon extreme rainfall in GBA cities than surrounding rural areas, with the urban heat island (UHI) intensifying urban rainfall intensity and probability. Extreme cases were classified into frontal and shear-line warm-sector types. Enhanced urban rainfall due to UHI was more pronounced under shear-line and warm-sector systems. Four frontal and four shear-line cases were dynamically downscaled using WRF-SLUCM, and four parallel experiments were conducted: \"Nourban\" (urban areas replaced by cropland), \"AH0,\" \"AH100,\" and \"AH300\" (normal land use, with diurnal maximum anthropogenic heat (AH) set to 0, 100, and 300 W/m² in SLUCM, respectively). In frontal cases, significantly reduced urban rainfall in AH0 is due to decreased (enhanced) surface evaporation (wind divergence) in cities compared to cropland. Strong northerly winds and cold air intrusion suppress UHI in AH0 and AH100 during the rainfall process; enhanced urban rainfall occurs only in AH300. In contrast, for shear-line cases, urban friction and UHI promote local convection and wind convergence, increasing urban rainfall significantly in all urban experiments compared to Nourban. Overall, urbanization’s influence on SC’s pre-monsoon extreme rainfall is highly sensitive to the type of synoptic systems, necessitating further investigation of urban rainfall in this season.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 20 August 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4191-x\n\nAbstract:\n\nSeasonal precipitation has always been the focus of climate prediction. As a dynamic-statistical combined method, the existing observational constraint correction establishes a regression relationship between the numerical model outputs and historical observations, which can partly predict seasonal precipitation. However, solving the nonlinear problem through linear regression leads to a significant bias. This study implemented a nonlinear optimization of the existing observational constrained correction model using a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) machine learning algorithm based on the Beijing National Climate Center Climate System Model (BCC-CSM) outputs and stational observations to improve the prediction of summer precipitation in China. The model was trained using a rolling approach, and LightGBM outperformed Linear Regression (LR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost). Using parameter tuning to optimize the machine learning model and predict future summer precipitation using eight different predictors in BCC-CSM, the mean Anomaly Correlation Coefficient (ACC) score in the 2019–2022 summer precipitation predictions was 0.17, and the mean Prediction Score (PS) reached 74. The PS score was improved by 7.87% and 6.63% compared with BCC-CSM and the linear observational constraint approach, respectively. The observational constraint correction prediction strategy with LightGBM significantly and stably improved the prediction of summer precipitation in China compared to the previous linear observational constraint solution, providing a reference for flood control and drought relief during the flood season (summer) in China.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 13 August 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4154-2\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe synoptic process of a super Arctic cyclone in August 2016 (AC16) is investigated based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, and the key factors affecting the rapid intensification (RI) of AC16 and their relative contributions are analyzed by diagnosing a new surface pressure tendency equation (SPTE). The major physical mechanisms behind the two RI stages of AC16 are revealed. The trajectory, intensity change and structure characteristics of AC16 are well simulated by the WRF model. A diagnosis based on the SPTE can promisingly reproduce the two RI stages of AC16. The leading factor influencing the AC16 intensity is identified to be the air-column potential temperature tendency, while the pressure change at the upper boundary has less impact. Further analysis reveals that the horizontal potential temperature advection is a decisive factor in the air-column warming. Specifically, the upper-level warm advection generated by the strong wind speed of the upper-level jet plays a dominant role in warming the air-column, which causes the initial RI of AC16. The AC16 movement and the strong potential temperature gradient generated by tropopause polar vortices increase the upper-level warm advection, which warms the air-column and thereby induces the second RI of AC16. However, the net effect of vertical potential temperature advection and latent heat, as well as the radiation process, can cause the air-column cooling and thereby have negative contributions to the RI of AC16.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 09 August 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4206-7\n\nAbstract:\n\nABSTRACT Cloud detection is critical for satellite remote sensing algorithms and downstream applications. This study evaluates the official cloud mask (CLM) product of the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) on the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite using two years of data from the Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) over China. The evaluation reveals moderate performance, with accuracy (ACC) of 79% for daytime and 80% for nighttime. However, the FY-4A CLM struggles with high false positive rates (FPRs of 35% during the day and 23% at night), often misclassifying clear skies as clouds. To address this issue, a random forest (RF)-based cloud detection algorithm is developed, using collocated CALIOP observations as reference labels for model development and validation. The models are divided into daytime and nighttime categories based on the solar zenith angle. Feature engineering demonstrates that adding temporal information, spatial texture information, and dynamic surface features reduces FPR values significantly. The ACC of the daytime/nighttime model improved by up to 13.6%/10.2%. The proposed RF models achieve exceptional cloud detection, with ACC and true positive rates (TPR) exceeding 90% and FPR below 10% for both day and night, outperforming the FY-4A CLM. Compared to MODIS and FY-4A CLM, the RF-based models demonstrate superior accuracy in identifying clouds under challenging conditions such as dust, snow, and high pollution. This study offers a promising alternative to enhance cloud detection for the FY-4A imager.

Recent evidences indicated that secondary aerosols play an important role in the haze formation, and that heterogeneous processes are among the main forces driving their explosive growth. In this regard, this paper reviews recent advances in the understanding of the impact of heterogeneous processes on haze chemistry, including the impact on NO2 chemistry, marine aerosols, and the hygroscopicity and optical properties of atmospheric aerosols. It is distinguished from past reviews on this topic by focusing mainly on the new insights from the recent five years. We summarise the main findings of the impacts of heterogeneous processes on NO2 chemistry, marine aerosols, and the physicochemical properties of atmospheric aerosols, and propose several future research directions.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 08 August 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4176-9.\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis study investigates the disparities in the deployment of photovoltaic technology for carbon emissions reduction across different nations, highlighting the mismatch between countries with high economic capacity and those where PV installation would maximize global decarbonization benefits. We discuss this mismatch based on three key factors influencing decarbonization via photovoltaic technology: per capita gross domestic product, carbon intensity of the energy system, and solar resource availability. Current photovoltaic deployment is predominantly concentrated in economically advanced countries, and does not coincide with regions where the environmental and economic impact of such installations would be most significant. Through a series of thought experiments, we demonstrate how alternative prioritization strategies could significantly reduce global carbon emissions. We argue for a globally coordinated approach to photovoltaic deployment, particularly targeting high-impact regions in the Sunbelt, to enhance the efficacy of decarbonization efforts and promote equitable energy access. The study underscores the need for international policies that support sustainable energy transitions in economically less developed regions through workforce development and assistance with the activation of capital.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 06 August 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4082-1\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this study, the Betts-Miller-Janjić (BMJ) convective adjustment scheme in Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model version 4.0 was used to investigate the effect of parameter α, which influences the first-guess potential temperature reference profile, on the Madden‒Julian oscillation (MJO) propagation and structure. This study diagnosed the MJO active phase composites of the MJO-filtered outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) during the December to January (DJF) period of 2006–2016 over Indian Ocean (IO), Maritime Continent (MC) and western Pacific (WP). The results show that the MJO-filtered OLR intensity, propagation pattern and MJO classification (standing, jumping and propagating clusters) are sensitive to the α value but the phase speeds of propagating MJOs are not. With increasing α value, overall, the simulated MJO-filtered OLR intensity increases and the simulated propagation pattern is improved. Results also show that the intensity and propagation pattern of eastward-propagating MJO are associated with MJO circulation structures and thermodynamic structures. As α increases, the front Walker cell and the low-level easterly anomaly are enhanced, which premoistens the lower troposphere and triggers more active shallow and congestus clouds. The enhanced shallow and congestus convection preconditions the lower to middle troposphere, accelerating the transition from congestus to deep convection, thereby facilitating the MJO eastward propagation. Therefore, the simulated MJO tends to transfer from stand to propagate eastward as α increases. In summary, increasing the value of α is a possible way to improve the simulation of MJO propagation and MJO structure.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 06 August 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4072-3\n\nAbstract:\n\nA subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecast system (FS) has recently been released based on the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences – Climate System Model (CAMS-CSM) fully coupled model. This study evaluated the subseasonal prediction skill of this system via a 21-year hindcast experiment for the period 2000–2020 with eight ensemble members. Results showed moderate-to-high skill for the primary atmospheric variables. The most accurate predictions emerged in the cold season but were largely confined in tropical bands as the forecast lead time was increased. Compared with the NCEP S2S FS, the CAMS-CSM S2S FS showed comparable subseasonal skill for 500-hPa geopotential height, but slightly higher (lower) skill for precipitation (2-m temperature). The skillful lead time in the CAMS-CSM S2S FS for the Madden–Julian Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation reached 20 and 10 days, respectively, consistent with the NCEP S2S FS. Consequently, these findings guide future research on subseasonal predictability based on the CAMS-CSM S2S FS, and where efforts should be focused to improve the prediction system.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 05 August 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4068-z\n\nAbstract:\n\nAccurate descriptions of cloud droplet spectra from aerosol activation to vapor condensation using microphysical parameterization schemes are crucial for numerical simulations of precipitation and climate change in weather forecasting and climate prediction models. Hence, the latest activation and triple-moment condensation schemes were combined to simulate and analyze the evolution characteristics of a cloud droplet spectrum from activation to condensation and compared with a high-resolution Lagrangian bin model and the current double-moment condensation schemes, in which the spectral shape parameter is fixed or diagnosed by an empirical formula. The results demonstrate that the latest schemes effectively capture the evolution characteristics of the cloud droplet spectrum during activation and condensation, which is in line with the performance of the bin model. The simulation of the latest activation and condensation schemes shows that the cloud droplet spectrum gradually widens and exhibits a multimodal distribution during the activation process, accompanied by a decrease in the spectral shape and slope parameters over time. Conversely, during the condensation process, the cloud droplet spectrum gradually narrows, resulting in increases in the spectral shape and slope parameters. However, these double-moment schemes fail to accurately replicate the evolution of the cloud droplet spectrum and its multimodal distribution characteristics. Furthermore, the latest schemes were coupled into a 1.5D cumulus model, and observation case was simulated. The simulations confirm that the cloud droplet spectrum appears wider at the supersaturated cloud base and cloud top due to activation, while it becomes narrower at the middle altitudes of the cloud due to condensation growth.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 05 August 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4162-2\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn recent years, polarization remote sensing has garnered an increasing attention, particularly within the realm of meteorology. In order to accurately simulate polarization information, the vector discrete-ordinate radiative transfer (VDISORT) model developed earlier by the community is further enhanced to an advanced version (referred to as A-VDISORT) through an improved ocean surface reflection. The Fresnel reflection matrix including wind-generated roughness and shading effect is served as the ocean bidirectional reflection distribution function (BRDF). The simulation from A-VDISORT is compared with SCIATRAN for the Rayleigh scattering atmosphere, and the influence of water-leaving radiance is analyzed by PSTAR (Polarized System for Transfer of Atmospheric Radiation) model. For GaoFen-5 Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) observations with polarization and multi-angle information, clear sky pixel recognition over ocean is first carried out. The DPC reflectance at the clear conditions is normalized and compared with the observations. It is shown that A-VDISORT has a high simulation accuracy with a bias of -0.0053. The difference between simulation and observation exhibits a standard normal probability distribution function.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 05 August 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3358-9\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Sichuan Basin (SCB), China has a high incidence of extremely persistent heavy rainfall (EPHR) events. The EPHR from 2009 to 2019 in SCB was mainly concentrated in the northern and northwestern windward slopes and the central basin. It occurred from June to September, especially in July, and peaked at 03 local standard time. ERA-5 reanalysis data and the objective classification were used to investigate the synoptic patterns and their effect. There were three synoptic patterns during EPHR and they were all accompanied by the southwest vortex. The location and intensity of the southwest vortex, thermal forcing of Tibetan Plateau (TP), and low-level winds can greatly affect the intensity and spatial distribution of EPHR. When the southwest vortex was located in the western SCB and there were southerly low-level jets (LLJs), convergence and upslope wind would lead to EPHR on the northwestern or northern windward slopes. If there was no LLJ and the whole SCB was in the center of the southwest vortex, the nocturnal EPHR was controlled by the internal circulation of the southwest vortex and the updraft generated by the thermal forcing of TP, and the rainfall was weaker. The southeastern entrance of SCB was a key area where the low-level wind dominated the nocturnal peak of EPHR. The nocturnal strengthened southeasterly wind in the key area is attributed to inertial oscillation, and the topographic friction plays an essential role in transporting momentum and moisture into the basin by generating easterly and northeasterly ageostrophic winds.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 05 August 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3246-3\n\nAbstract:\n\nExisting traditional ocean vertical mixing schemes are empirically developed without a thorough understanding of the physical processes, resulting in a discrepancy between the parameterization results and forecast results. The uncertainty in the ocean mixing parameterization is primarily responsible for the bias in ocean climate models. Benefiting from deep learning technology, we design the Adaptive Fully Connected Module (AFCM) with Inception module as baseline to minimize bias. It adaptively extracts the best features through fully connected layers with different widths, and better learns the nonlinear relationship between input variables and parameterization fields. Moreover, to obtain more accurate results, we impose KPP and PP schemes as physical constraints to make the network parameterization process follow the basic physical laws more closely. Since model data are calculated with human experience, lacking some unknown physical processes, which may differ from the actual data, we use a decade-long time record of hydrological and turbulence observations in the tropical Pacific Ocean as training data. Combining physical constraint and nonlinear activation function, our method catches its non-linear change and better adapts to the ocean mixing parameterization process. The use of physical constraints can improve the final results.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 05 August 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4137-3\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe riming process significantly impacts the microphysical characteristics of clouds. This study uses aircraft and radar observation data in stratiform clouds with convection embedded that occurred in the central and southern regions of North China on 22 May 2017. The microphysical structural characteristics and processes near the embedded convection core and in the stratiform cloud are analyzed in comparison. Particular attention is given to the effect of riming on the microphysical properties near the upper boundary of the melting layer and to the factors influencing riming efficiency. The collaborative observations reveal that the particle size distributions observed near the convection core and in the stratiform region are close while the particle properties like habits and riming degrees are quite different. Above the melting layer, larger plate-like ice particles and supercooled water droplets (D > 50 μm) are more abundant near the convective core, leading to higher collision efficiencies between ice particles and supercooled water droplets. Larger fluctuation amplitudes of vertical airflow near the convective core also contribute to the increased riming activity and the formation of more heavily rimed particles, such as graupel. Furthermore, in-situ measurements from airborne probes also revealed that above the melting layer, the riming process involves two stages: the mass of snow crystals grows as supercooled droplets merge internally without changing size, followed by external freezing that significantly enlarges the crystals.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 02 August 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3306-8\n\nAbstract:\n\nTimely and accurate forecasting of storm surges can effectively prevent typhoon storm surges from causing large economic losses and casualties in coastal areas. At present, numerical model forecasting consumes too many resources and takes too long to compute, while neural network forecasting lacks regional data to train regional forecasting models. In this study, we used the DUAL wind model to construct typhoon wind fields and constructed a typhoon database of 75 processes in the northern South China Sea using coupled advanced circulation–simulating waves nearshore (ADCIRC-SWAN) model. In this study, a neural network with a Res-U-Net structure was trained using typhoon database to forecast the typhoon processes in the validation dataset, and an excellent storm surge forecasting effect was achieved in the Pearl River Estuary region. The storm surge forecasting effect of stronger typhoons was improved by adding branch structure and transfer learning.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 02 August 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3336-2\n\nAbstract:\n\nClimate downscaling is used to transform large-scale meteorological data into small-scale data with enhanced detail, which finds wide applications in climate modeling, numerical weather forecasting, and renewable energy. Although deep-learning-based downscaling methods effectively capture the complex nonlinear mapping between meteorological data of varying scales, the supervised deep-learning-based downscaling methods suffer from insufficient high-resolution data in practice, and unsupervised methods struggle with accurately inferring small-scale specifics from limited large-scale inputs due to small-scale uncertainty. This article presents DualDS, a dual-learning framework utilizing a GAN-based neural network and subgrid-scale auxiliary information for climate downscaling. Such a learning method is unified in a two-stream framework through up- and down- samplers, where the downsampler is used to simulate the information loss process during the upscaling, and the upsampler is used to reconstruct lost details and correct errors incurred during the upscaling. This dual learning strategy can eliminate the dependence on high-resolution ground truth in the training process and refine the downscaling results by constraining the mapping process. Experimental findings demonstrate that DualDS is comparable to several state-of-the-art deep learning downscaling approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. Specifically, for a single surface temperature data downscaling task, our method is on par with other unsupervised algorithms with the same dataset, we can achieve 0.469 dB higher PSNR, 0.017 higher SSIM, 0.08 lower RMSE, and the best correlation coefficient. In summary, this finding presents a novel approach to address small-scale uncertainty issues in unsupervised downscaling processes.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 02 August 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3338-0\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn Earth system modeling, the land surface is coupled with the atmosphere through surface turbulent fluxes. These fluxes are computed using mean meteorological variables between the surface and a reference height in the atmosphere. However, the dependence of flux computation on the reference height, which is usually set as the lowest level in the atmosphere in Earth system models, has not received much attention. Based on high-resolution large-eddy simulation (LES) data under unstable conditions, we find the setting of reference height is not trivial within the framework of current surface layer theory. With a reasonable prescription of aerodynamic roughness length (following the setting in LESs), reference heights near the top of the surface layer tend to provide the best estimate of surface fluxes, especially for the momentum flux. Furthermore, this conclusion for the sensible heat flux is insensitive to the ratio of roughness length for momentum versus heat. These results are robust, whether using the classical or revised surface layer theory. They provide a potential guide for setting the proper reference heights for Earth system modeling and can be further tested in the near-future using observational data from land-atmosphere feedback observatories.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 30 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4051-8\n\nAbstract:\n\nMeasurements from a hyperspectral infrared (HIR) sounder onboard a satellite in geostationary orbit not only provide atmospheric thermodynamic information, but also can be used to infer dynamic information with high temporal resolution. Radiance measurements from the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS), obtained with 15-min temporal resolution during Typhoon Maria (2018) and 30-min temporal resolution during Typhoon Lekima (2019), were used to derive three-dimensional (3D) horizontal winds by tracking the motion of atmospheric moisture. This work focused on the impact of assimilation of 3D winds on typhoon analyses and forecasts using the operational CMA-MESO, and improved understanding of the potential benefits of assimilating dynamic information from geostationary sounder data with higher temporal resolution. The standard deviation of the observations minus simulations revealed that the accuracy of the derived 3D winds with 15-min resolution was higher than that of derived winds with 30-min resolution. Experiments showed that the assimilation system can effectively absorb the information of the derived 3D winds, and that dynamic information from clear-sky areas can be transferred to typhoon areas. In typhoon prediction, assimilation of the derived 3D winds had greatest influence on the typhoon track, and less influence on the maximum wind speed. Assimilation of the derived 3D winds reduced the average track error by 17.4% for Typhoon Maria and by 3.5% for Typhoon Lekima during their entire 36-h forecasts initiated at different times. Assimilation of GIIRS dynamic information can substantially improve forecasts of heavy precipitation by CMA-MESO. Results indicate that assimilation of dynamic information from high-temporal-resolution geostationary HIR sounder data adds value for improved numerical weather prediction.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 30 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4177-8\n\nAbstract:\n\nSolar radiation modification (SRM), a scheme aimed at mitigating rapid global warming triggered by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, has been explored through the G1ext experiment under the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) framework, utilizing the Chinese Academy of Sciences Earth System Model version 2 (CAS-ESM2.0). This paper briefly describes the basic configuration and experimental design of the CAS-ESM2.0 for G1ext, which involves a sudden reduction in solar irradiance to counterbalance the radiative forcing of an abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, running for 100 years. Preliminary results show that this model can well reproduce the compensatory effect of a uniform decrease in global solar radiation on the radiative forcing resulting from abrupt quadrupling of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Like other Earth system models, CAS-ESM2.0 reasonably captures variations in both globally and locally radiative adjustments, surface air temperature and precipitation patterns under G1ext scenario. The generated datasets have been released on the Earth System Grid Federation data server, providing insight into the potential efficacy and impact of solar geoengineering strategies.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 30 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3313-9\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this paper, we introduce TianXing, a transformer-based data-driven model designed with physic augmentation for skillful and efficient global weather forecasting. Previous data-driven transformer models such as Pangu-Weather, FengWu, and FuXi have emerged as a promising alternative of Numerical Weather Prediction for weather forecasting. However, these models have been characterized by their substantial computational resource consumption during training and limited incorporation of explicit physical guidance in their modeling frameworks. In contrast, TianXing applies a linear complexity mechanism, ensuring proportional scalability with input data size and significantly diminishing GPU resource demands, with only a marginal compromise in accuracy. Furthermore, TianXing proposes an explicit attention decay mechanism in the linear attention derived from physics insights to enhance its forecasting skill. The mechanism can re-weight attention based on Earth's spherical distances and learned sparse multivariate coupling relationships, prompting the TianXing to prioritize dynamically relevant neighboring features. Finally, to enhance its performance in medium-range forecasting, TianXing employs a stacked autoregressive forecast algorithm. Validation of the model's architecture is conducted using ERA5 reanalysis data at a 5.625° latitude-longitude resolution, while a high-resolution dataset at 0.25° is utilized for training the actual forecasting model. Notably, the TianXing exhibits great performance metrics, particularly in Z500 (geopotential height) and T850 (temperature), surpassing previous data-driven models and operational full-resolution models such as NCEP GFS and ECMWF IFS, as evidenced by latitude-weighted RMSE and ACC metrics. Moreover, the TianXing has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in predicting extreme weather events, such as typhoon.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 26 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3144-8\n\nAbstract:\n\n31 May through 2 June 2023 marked the 18th Workshop on Antarctic Meteorology and Climate. The Antarctic Meteorological Research and Data Center hosted this hybrid workshop at the Pyle Center at University of Wisconsin-Madison in Madison, WI, USA. Global members of the Antarctic meteorological community gathered to present and discuss topics from scientific research to operational support within Antarctic meteorology and climate. Students and early career professionals chaired various presentations and discussions while all attendees engaged to share results, build collaborative plans, and discuss further developments. The main workshop topics included updates on the current automatic weather station (AWS) networks, challenges and planning concerning Antarctic forecasting and operational services, Antarctic numerical modeling systems, observational applications and research, and Antarctic community and data sources. Across six sessions, over 25 different presenters elaborated on their work in areas such as field season updates, atmospheric rivers, remote sensing, the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System, and forecasting challenges due to data scarcity. Workshop discussions resulted in several key outcomes and action items regarding field work impacts, exploration of field techniques, observation coverage, and communication between operations and research scientists. Future workshops will provide opportunities for continued discussion on the evolution of the AWS network and operational needs while providing a venue to promote collaboration and cooperation for Antarctic meteorology and climate activities.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 25 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3112-3\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Scandinavian (SCA) pattern is an important climate signal in regulating the variability of summer extreme precipitation (SEP) over the eastern slope of the Tibetan Plateau (ESTP). There is a strong negative correlation between the SCA pattern and SEP over the ESTP, with a correlation coefficient of −0.57. Moisture budget analysis showed that the dynamic component anomalies of both the zonal and vertical moisture advection induced by the SCA pattern play the dominant roles in extreme precipitation variability over the ESTP. These anomalies are solely linked to variations in zonal wind and vertical velocity. The anomalies of the SCA pattern propagate downstream through Rossby waves, leading to the formation of cyclonic circulations over northern East Asia and the Iranian Plateau. The westerlies on the southern side of these cyclonic circulations play a crucial role in influencing the development of significant anomalous westerlies over the ESTP. The anomalous westerlies bring climatologically moist air from the Tibetan Plateau (TP) to the ESTP, resulting in positive zonal moisture advection anomalies over the area. Furthermore, these anomalous westerlies transport climatologically warm air from the TP to the ESTP, leading to significant warm advection anomalies and vertical upward motion anomalies over the ESTP. The upward motion carries lower tropospheric moisture upward, resulting in positive vertical moisture advection anomalies over the ESTP. The combination of these positive zonal and vertical moisture advection anomalies eventually leads to excessive SEP.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 25 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4107-9\n\nAbstract:\n\nBased on the hindcasts from five sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) models participating in the S2S Prediction Project, this study evaluates the performance of the multi-model ensemble (MME) approach in predicting the subseasonal precipitation anomalies during summer in China and reveals the contributions of possible driving factors. The results suggest that while single-model ensembles (SMEs) exhibit constrained predictive skills within a limited forecast lead time of 3 pentads, the MME illustrates an enhanced predictive skill at a lead time of up to 4 pentads, even 6 pentads in southern China. Based on both deterministic and probabilistic verification metrics, the MME consistently outperforms SMEs with a more evident advantage observed in probabilistic forecasting. The superior performance of MME is primarily attributed to the increase in ensemble size, and the enhanced model diversity is also a contributing factor. The reliability of probabilistic skill has been largely improved due to the increase in ensemble members, while the resolution term does not exhibit consistent improvement. Furthermore, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) has been revealed as the primary driving factor for the successful prediction of summer precipitation in China using the MME. The improvement by the MME is not solely attributed to the enhancement in the inherent predictive capacity of MJO itself, but derived from its capability in capturing the more realistic relationship between the MJO and sub-seasonal precipitation anomalies in China. This study establishes a scientific foundation for acknowledging the advantageous predictive capability of MME in sub-seasonal predictions of summer precipitation in China, and sheds light on further improving the S2S predictions.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 24 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3347-z\n\nAbstract:\n\nTraditional meteorological downscaling methods face limitations due to the complex distribution of meteorological variables, which can lead to unstable forecasting results, especially in extreme scenarios. To overcome this issue, we propose a convolutional graph neural network (CGNN) model, which we enhance with multilayer feature fusion and a squeeze-and-excitation block. Additionally, we introduce a spatially balanced mean squared error (SBMSE) loss function to address the imbalanced distribution and spatial variability of meteorological variables. The CGNN is capable of extracting essential spatial features and aggregating them from a global perspective, thereby improving the accuracy of prediction and enhancing the model's generalization ability. Based on the experimental results, CGNN has certain advantages in terms of bias distribution, exhibiting a smaller variance. When it comes to precipitation, both UNet and AE also demonstrate relatively small biases. As for temperature, AE and CNNdense show outstanding performance during the winter. The time correlation coefficients show an improvement of at least 10% at daily and monthly scales for both temperature and precipitation. Furthermore, the SBMSE loss function displays advantage over existing loss functions in predicting the 98th percentile and identifying areas where extreme events occur. However, SBMSE tends to overestimate the distribution of extreme precipitation, which may be due to the theoretical assumptions about the posterior distribution of data that partially limit the effectiveness of the loss function. In future work, we will further optimize SBMSE to improve prediction accuracy.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 24 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4057-2\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this study, we investigate the complex relationship between western disturbances (WDs), the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and extreme precipitation events (EPEs) in the Western Himalayas (WH) during the extended winter season (November-March). WDs west of WH coincide with 97% of recorded EPEs, contributing substantially (32% in winter, 11% annually) to total precipitation within WH. WDs are 6% less frequent and 4% more intense during El Niño than La Niña to the west of WH. During El Niño (compared to La Niña) years, WDs co-occurring with EPEs are significantly more intense and associated with 17% higher moisture transport over WH box. This results in doubling of EPEs frequency during El Niño periods than La Niña periods. A substantial southward shift (~180 km) of the subtropical jet (STJ) axis during El Niño brings WD tracks further south towards their primary moisture sources, especially the Arabian Sea. We have shown that WDs that are both more intense and pass to the south of their typical latitudes have higher levels of vertical integrated moisture flux (VIMF) within them. VIMF convergence in the most intense pentile of WDs is 5.7 times higher than in the weakest, and is 3.4 times higher in the second lowest latitude pentile than in the highest. Overall, this study demonstrates a direct link between changes in the latitudinal position and intensity of WDs associated with winter STJ, and moisture convergence, which leads to the occurrence of EPEs over the WH during ENSO phases.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 24 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3243-6\n\nAbstract:\n\nTropical cyclones (TCs) are complex and powerful weather systems, and accurately forecasting their path, structure, and intensity remains a critical focus and challenge in meteorological research. In this paper, we propose an Attention Spatio-Temporal predictive Generative Adversarial Network (AST-GAN) model for predicting the temporal and spatial distribution of TCs. The model forecasts the spatial distribution of TC wind speeds for the next 15 hours at 3-hour intervals, emphasizing the cyclone's center, high wind-speed areas, and its asymmetric structure. To effectively capture spatiotemporal feature transfer at different time steps, we employ a channel attention mechanism for feature selection, enhancing model performance and reducing parameter redundancy. We utilized High-Resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) data to train our model, allowing it to assimilate a wide range of TC motion patterns. The model is versatile and can be applied to various complex scenarios, such as multiple TCs moving simultaneously or TCs approaching landfall. Our proposed model demonstrates superior forecasting performance, achieving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.71 m s−1 for overall wind speed and 2.74 m s−1 for maximum wind speed when benchmarked against ground truth data from HWRF. Furthermore, the model underwent optimization and independent testing using ERA5 reanalysis data, showcasing its stability and scalability. After fine-tuning on the ERA5 dataset, the model achieved an RMSE of 1.33 m s−1 for wind speed and 1.75 m s−1 for maximum wind speed. The AST-GAN model outperforms other state-of-the-art models in RMSE on both the HWRF and ERA5 datasets, maintaining its superior performance and demonstrating its effectiveness for spatiotemporal prediction of TCs.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 17 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4027-8\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe increasing and intensifying extreme high temperature events (EHEs) over the central-eastern China (CEC) in recent decades have caused severe impacts on the social development and people’s livelihood. Using the observed and reanalysis datasets, this study explores the effect of the East Asian subtropical westerly jet stream (EAJ) on the CEC EHEs in summer during 1979-2020. Generally, being located on the right side of the upper layer jet stream exit region, the CEC would suffer more EHEs when the EAJ is relatively stronger and northward shifted in summer. This is owing to the abnormal subsidence induced by the EAJ. However, such an EAJ-EHE connection is unstable for the past four decades, but has an evident inter-decadal change. Before the late-1990s, the inter-annual variation of the EAJ is mainly featured by its meridional displacement in the east of Asia. The atmospheric responses thus are basically located to the east of the CEC, exerting less influence on the CEC EHEs. Since the late-1990s, the EAJ variation is featured with an intensity change in the jet stream center over the northwest side of the CEC, indicating a westward shift in atmospheric responses to cover the CEC region. Therefore, the EAJ would evidently affect the summer CEC EHEs during 2000-2021. Our findings could favor an in-depth understanding on the formation mechanisms of extreme weather/climate events, and thus provide a scientific reference for seasonal climate predictions.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 12 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4104-z\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe North Pacific Storm Track (NPST) is a high-frequency area of extratropical cyclones and an important channel for water vapor and energy transfer between low and mid-high latitudes. Previous weather and dynamic studies in this region have made significant progress, but due to the lack of ocean surface rainfall observation data, there is a lack of statistical research on precipitation in this area. In this study, statistical research on the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of rainfall in NPST was conducted based on GPM DPR observation data and ERA5 atmospheric parameters, and analysis and explanations were provided based on the atmospheric parameters. The study found that, compared to low-pressure systems, pressure gradients have a greater impact on cyclone activity and rainfall distribution. This feature, along with the meridional distribution of high atmospheric water vapor in the north Pacific Ocean and low in the north, collectively leads to the offset of high-frequency rainfall areas relative to storm tracks. The distribution of sea surface temperatures in the North Pacific Ocean affects the zonal distribution of storm tracks, causing weather disturbances and precipitation along the storm tracks to exhibit a northward extension from west to east. This study deepens the understanding of the role of NPST in global water vapor and energy balance, and it is of great significance for improving the prediction accuracy of rainfall in extratropical cyclones in climate models.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 08 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4045-6\n\nAbstract:\n\nAtmospheric de-aliasing is one of the most important background models for recovering Earth’s temporal gravity field from gravity satellite missions. To meet Chinese gravimetric satellite platform, an independent atmospheric de-aliasing model that relies on Chinese meteorological data needs to be developed. The release of CRA-40, as the first generation of Chinese atmospheric reanalysis, provides the opportunity. This study proposes a revised modelling method to calibrate CRA-40 and develops a new atmospheric de-aliasing model (HUST-CRA, 2002-2020). Intensive assessments are made between HUST-CRA and the latest official de-aliasing product of the international gravity satellite mission. The tidal components of the two products demonstrate a high consistency, e.g., the spatial correlation for the major tide S1 is 0.96. The non-tidal components of the two products are also equivalent: (1) the temporal correlation of low-degree terms is higher than 0.97, except for the term of S22 (0.93); (2) the spectral correlation of degree geoid height up to degree/order 100 is as high as 0.99; (3) the confidence interval of the spatial correlation (2002-2020) is [0.971, 0.995] at a confidence level of 95%; (4) the difference of KBRR-residuals is less than 0.08 um/s, the difference of derived temporal gravity field is less than 0.32 mm in terms of geoid height, and both are apparently beyond the ability of current gravity satellite mission. This confirms that CRA-40 is of high quality and that the derived de-aliasing product HUST-CRA is accurate enough to be used in both Chinese and international gravity satellite missions.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 08 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4069-y\n\nAbstract:\n\nOrthogonal conditional nonlinear optimal perturbations (O-CNOPs) are typically used to generate ensemble forecasting members for achieving high forecasting skill of high-impact weather and climate events. However, highly efficient calculations for O-CNOPs are still challenging in the field of ensemble forecasting. In this study, we combine a gradient-based iterative idea with the Gram‒Schmidt orthogonalization, and propose an iterative optimization method to compute O-CNOPs. This method is different from the original sequential optimization method and allows parallel computations of O-CNOPs, thus saving a large amount of computational time. We evaluate this method by using the Lorenz-96 model on the basis of the ensemble forecasting ability achieved and on the time consumed for computing O-CNOPs. The results demonstrate that the parallel iterative method causes O-CNOPs to yield reliable ensemble members and to achieve ensemble forecasting skills similar to or even slightly higher than those produced by the sequential method. Moreover, the parallel method significantly reduces the computational time for O-CNOPs. Therefore, the parallel iterative method provides a highly effective and efficient approach for calculating O-CNOPs for ensemble forecasts. Expectedly, it can play a great role in the application of the O-CNOPs to realistic ensemble forecasts for high-impact weather and climate events.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 05 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4029-6\n\nAbstract:\n\nThree extreme cold events have occurred in January 2016 and 2021, and December 2023 in Eastern Asia. As important factors in atmospheric circulation anomalies, the Blocking High and East Asian Trough (BH-ET) structure play key roles during the three extreme cold waves events. Among them, the BH affects the development of cold waves in two different ways: (1) Before the cold waves in 2016 and 2023, BH pushed the cold air southward, resulting in a slow and gradual cooling, with a cooling rate (CR) of 1.34℃/day and 1.2℃/day in Eastern Asia, respectively. (2) In January 2021, the sudden collapse of BH caused the cold air to rapidly attack the mid-latitude region, with a CR of 1.87℃/day. By calculating the CR of the space, the temperature drop in 2021 is 38.8 % and 55% faster than those in 2016 and 2023, respectively. At the same time, the ET affects the wind direction of cold waves through the pressure. Before the cold waves occur, the meridional wind field near ET shows a negative value, forming a northwest or northeast wind, which continues to affect the southern part of East Asia. The meridional wind in January 2021 is stronger than those in 2016 and 2023, which is also the reason for the strong cold wave in 2021. Finally, the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis results of 1980-2023 show obvious BH-ET structure in three cold wave events. This climatological state provides a climatic background for the occurrence of cold waves.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 03 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4064-3\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis study investigates extreme rainfall episodes along the eastern foothills of Taihang Mountains in North China from July 30 to August 1, 2023. It focuses on two types of extreme hourly rainfall rates (HRRs), i.e., the maximum regional-average HRR and site-observed HRR, which exhibited sequential development over southern, middle, and northern key regions. These rainfall extremes occurred in an environment where a high-pressure barrier over North China prevented cold air masses from the north, while a northward-moving typhoon remnant vortex and its associated low-level jet (LLJ) transported warm and moist airflow from the south. Two distinct echo evolution modes and convection initiation mechanisms are identified for the two types of extreme HRRs. The maximum regional-average HRR occurred when the LLJ arrived to the east of the key regions, while the maximum site-observed HRR occurred when the regions were influenced by the warmer vortex center. Taking the northern key region as a representation, at the time of the maximum regional-average HRR, slantwise ascent of the airflow along a warm-front-like boundary released symmetrical instability energy, resulting in stratiform rainfall with weak convective cores. The transport of locally initiated convection over the eastern plain region, where the atmospheric stratification was more potentially unstable, also contributed significantly. When the maximum site-observed HRR occurred, terrain lifting of warm and moist southeast airflow led to intense convection over the mountain foothills. Overall, the warm-core typhoon remnant vortex's passage and interaction with Taihang Mountains determined the timing and location of extreme HRRs across the key regions.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 02 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3191-1\n\nAbstract:\n\nTC intensity estimation is an essential task in TC observation and forecasting. Deep learning models have recently been applied to estimate TC intensity from satellite images and produce accurate results. This work proposes the ViT-TC model based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture built by the attention mechanism. Satellite images of TCs, including infrared (IR), water vapor (WV), and passive microwave (PMW), are used as inputs for TC intensity estimation. Experiments show that inputting a combination of IR, WV, and PMW can give a more accurate estimation than other combinations of input channels. The ensemble mean technique is applied and improves the model’s estimations to a root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.65 and 6.98 knots, which outperforms traditional methods and is comparable to existing deep learning models. The model assigns high attention weights to areas with high PMW, indicating that PMW magnitude is essential information for the model’s estimation. The model also gives high attention weights to non-cloud areas with high IR and WV, suggesting that the model detects the positive correlation between TC size and intensity and derives this feature from the non-cloud area over the edge of the sample.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 02 July 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3264-1\n\nAbstract:\n\nIt is fundamental and useful to investigate how the Deep Learning forecasting Model (DLM) performs, compared to the Operational oceanography Forecast System (OFS). However, few studies have intercompared their performances using an identical reference. In this study, three physically reasonable DLMs have been implemented for the forecasting of Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) and sea surface velocity in the South China Sea. The DLMs have been validated against the testing dataset and the “OceanPredict” Class 4 dataset, respectively. The results show that the DLM’s RMSEs against the latter will increase by 44%, 245%, 302% and 109% for SST, SLA, current speed and direction, respectively, compared to those against the former. Therefore, different references have significant influences on the validation, and it is necessary to use identical and independent reference to intercompare the DLM and the OFS. Against the Class 4 dataset, the DLMs present significantly better performance for SLA than the OFSs, and slight better performances for other variables. The error patterns of the DLMs and the OFSs show high similarity, which is reasonable from the view of predictability, facilitating further applications of the DLMs. For extreme events of the SLA and speed, the DLMs and the OFSs both present large but similar forecast errors, while for extreme events of SST and direction, the DLMs likely give larger errors. This study provides an evaluation of forecast skills of commonly used DLMs, also provides an example to objectively intercompare different DLMs.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 24 June 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4102-1\n\nAbstract:\n\nNusantara, the new capital city of Indonesia, and its surrounding areas experienced intense heavy rainfall on 15−16 March 2022, leading to devastating and widespread flooding. However, the factors triggering such intense heavy rainfall and the underlying physical mechanisms are still not fully understood. Using high-resolution GSMaP (Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation) data, we show that a mesoscale convective system (MCS) was the primary cause of the heavy rainfall event. The rainfall peak occurred during the MCS’s mature stage at 1800 UTC 15 March 2022, and diminished as it entered the dissipation stage. To understand the large-scale environmental factors affecting the MCS event, we analyzed contributions from the MJO, equatorial waves, and low-frequency variability to column water vapor and moisture flux convergence. Results indicate a substantial influence of the MJO and equatorial waves on lower-level (boundary layer) meridional moisture flux convergence during the pre-MCS stage and initiation, with their contributions accounting for up to 80% during the growth phase. Moreover, while La Niña and the Asian monsoon had negligible impacts on MCS moisture supply, we find a large contribution from the residual term of the water vapour budget during the maturation and decay phases of the MCS. This suggests that local forcing (such as small-scale convection, local evaporation, land-surface feedback, and topography) also contributed to modulation of the intensity and duration of the MCS. The results of this study can help in our understanding of the potential causes of extreme rainfall in Nusantara and could be leveraged to improve rainstorm forecasting and risk management across the region in the future.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 24 June 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4070-5\n\nAbstract:\n\nAccurate skin temperature is one of the critical factors in successfully assimilating satellite radiance data over land. However, the model simulated skin temperature may not be accurate enough. To address this issue, an extended skin temperature control variable (TSCV) approach was proposed in a variational assimilation framework which also considered the background error correlation between skin temperature and atmospheric variables. A series of single observation tests and a 10-day cycling assimilation experiment were conducted to evaluate the impact of the TSCV approach on the assimilation of AMSU-A and ATMS microwave temperature-sounding channels over land. The results of the single observation tests show that by applying the TSCV approach, not only the direct analysis of the skin temperature is realized, but also the interaction between the skin temperature and atmospheric variables can be achieved during the assimilation process. The results of the cycling experiment demonstrate that the TSCV approach improves the skin temperature analysis, which in turn reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of the surface variables and low-level air temperature forecasts. The TSCV approach also reduces the difference between the observed and simulated brightness temperatures of both microwave and infrared window channels over land, suggesting that the approach can facilitate the radiance simulation of these channels, thus contributing to the assimilation of window channels.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 21 June 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4112-z\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Beijing 325 m meteorological tower stands as a pivotal research platform for exploring atmospheric boundary layer physics and atmospheric chemistry. With a legacy spanning 45 years, the tower has played a crucial role in unraveling the complexities of urban air pollution, atmospheric processes, and climate change in Beijing, China. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the measurements on the tower over the past two decades. Through long-term comprehensive observations, researchers have elucidated the intricate relationships between anthropogenic emissions, meteorological dynamics, and atmospheric composition, shedding light on the drivers of air pollution and its impacts on public health. The vertical measurements on the tower also enable detailed investigations into boundary layer dynamics, turbulent mixing, and pollutant dispersion, providing invaluable data for validating chemical transport models. Key findings from the tower's research include the identification of positive feedback mechanisms between aerosols and the boundary layer, the characterization of pollutant sources and transport pathways, the determination of fluxes of gaseous and particulate species, and the assessment of the effectiveness of pollution control measures. Additionally, isotopic measurements have provided new insights into the sources and formation processes of particulate matter and reactive nitrogen species. Finally, the paper outlines future directions for tower-based research, emphasizing the need for long-term comprehensive measurements, the development of innovative tower platforms, and integration of emerging technologies.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 19 June 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3324-6\n\nAbstract:\n\nClimate change is an essential topic in climate science, and the accessibility of accurate,high-resolution datasets in recent years has facilitated the extraction of more insights from big-data resources. Nonetheless, current research predominantly focuses on mean-value changes and largely overlooks changes in the probability distribution. In this study, a novel method called Wasserstein Stability Analysis (WSA) is developed to identify probability density function (PDF) changes, especially the extreme event shift and nonlinear physical value constraint variation in climate change. WSA is applied to the early 21st century and compared with traditional mean-value trend analysis. The results indicate that despite no significant trend, the equatorial eastern Pacific experienced a decline in hot extremes and an increase in cold extremes, indicating a La Niña-like temperature shift. Further analysis at two Arctic locations suggests sea ice severely restricts the hot extremes of surface air temperature. This impact is diminishing as the sea ice melts. By revealing PDF shifts, WSA emerges as a powerful tool to re-examine climate change dynamics, providing enhanced data-driven insights for understanding climate evolution.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 19 June 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4073-2\n\nAbstract:\n\nLand–atmosphere coupling and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies both have essential impacts on weather and climate extremes. Based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset and the CESM1.2.2 model, this study investigated the influence of land–atmosphere coupling on summer extreme hot-humid events (EHHE) over southern Eurasia under different SST backgrounds. The results suggested that coupling causes the near-surface air temperature increases exceeding 0.5 ℃. From 1961 to 2020, the frequency of EHHE has continuously increased and is closely related to soil moisture anomalies in the northern Indian Peninsula (IDP) and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (YRB). Numerical simulations further demonstrate that land–atmosphere coupling raises the risk of EHHE by 25.4%. In the typical El Niño SST background, intensified land–atmosphere coupling tends to produce notable increases in the frequency of EHHE. The dominant processes that land–atmosphere coupling affects the EHHE variations are evidently different between these two regions. Land surface thermal anomalies predominate in the IDP, while moisture conditions are more critical in the YRB. When warm SST anomalies exist, dry soil anomalies in the IDP are prominent, and evaporation is constrained, increasing sensible heat flux. Positive geopotential height anomalies are significant, combined with adiabatic warming induced by descending motion and a noticeable warm center in the near-surface atmosphere. The southward shift of the westerly jet enhances divergence over YRB. The anticyclonic circulation anomalies over the western Pacific are conducive to guiding moisture transport to the YRB, providing a favorable circulation background for the development of summer EHHE.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 07 June 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4046-5\n\nAbstract:\n\nScientific knowledge on the chemical compositions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is essential for properly assessing its health and climate effects, and for decisionmakers to develop efficient mitigation strategies. A high-resolution PM2.5 chemical composition dataset (CAQRA-aerosol) is developed in this study, which provides hourly maps of organic carbon, black carbon, ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate in China from 2013 to 2020 with a horizontal resolution of 15 km. This paper describes the method, access, and validation results of this dataset. It shows that CAQRA-aerosol has good consistency with observations and achieves higher or comparable accuracy with previous PM2.5 composition datasets. Based on CAQRA-aerosol, spatiotemporal changes of different PM2.5 compositions were investigated from a national viewpoint, which emphasizes different changes of nitrate from other compositions. The estimated annual rate of population-weighted concentrations of nitrate is 0.23 µg m−3 yr−1 from 2015 to 2020, compared with −0.19 to −1.1 µg m−3 yr−1 for other compositions. The whole dataset is freely available from the China Air Pollution Data Center (https://doi.org/10.12423/capdb_PKU.2023.DA).\n\n, Manuscript accepted 06 June 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3214-y\n\nAbstract:\n\nUnderstanding characteristics of heat exchange and evaporation variation of lakes is important for regional water resource management and sustainable development. Based on eddy covariance measurement over Lake Vanajavesi in southern Finland, characteristics of energy fluxes and cold fronts effects on energy exchange were investigated. The lake acted as a heat sink in spring and summer and a heat source in winter. The latent heat flux reached minimum value in the morning, and peaked in the afternoon. The diurnal variation of sensible heat flux was opposite to that of latent heat flux. Impact factors for the sensible heat flux were mainly the lake-air temperature difference, and lake-air temperature difference multiply by wind speed. The latent heat flux was mainly affected by vapor pressure deficit, and vapor pressure deficit multiply by wind speed. The annual mean values of bulk transfer coefficients for momentum, heat, and water vapor were 1.98×10-3, 1.62×10-3, and 1.31×10-3 respectively. Bulk transfer coefficients for heat and water vapor were not equal, indicating parameterization of energy exchange in numerical models, where assume heat coefficient equals to water vapor coefficient, need to be improved. During ice-free season, cold fronts resulted in 28 sensible heat pulse and 17 latent heat pulse, contributing to 50.59% and 34.89% of sensible and latent heat exchange in Lake Vanajavesi. The results indicated cold fronts have significant impacts on the surface energy budget and evaporation over lakes.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 05 June 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4060-7\n\nAbstract:\n\nPersistent (5-day or longer) extreme cold events (ECEs) over northeastern China during the boreal winter of 1979-2020 are investigated using daily minimum temperature (Tmin) from the China Meteorological Data Network. The extreme cooling area and intensity indices associated with the ECEs exhibit a dominant 10-40-day periodicity. The link of the ECEs to atmospheric intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) is further examined. The ECEs may be categorized into W- and N- type. In the former, the low-frequency cooling associated with the ISO mode first penetrates into the western boundary of the northeastern China region and gradually occupies over the entire domain at its peak phase. The upper-tropospheric circulation associated with this type is characterized by a northwest-southeast oriented Rossby wave train, expanding from the Ural Mountains to the western Pacific Ocean. In the latter, the cooling invades over the northern boundary first and then penetrates into the entire region. The precursory signal in the upper troposphere associated with this type is a zonally oriented negative geopotential height anomaly, which moves southward. A downward-propagating signal was observed in the stratospheric potential vorticity field prior to the peak cooling, implying a possible stratospheric impact. In addition to the aforementioned W- and N- types, ECEs may occur in a local region over either northern or southern northeastern China.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 04 June 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3256-1\n\nAbstract:\n\nNorthern China is a prominent \"hotspot\" for land−atmosphere interactions, with substantial gradients in both moisture and thermal conditions. Previous studies identified a link between land−atmosphere coupling and the individual roles of each factor, but the synergistic effect of the two factors remains unclear. This study considered the co-variation of evapotranspiration and precipitation to assess evapotranspiration−precipitation (ET−P) coupling across northern China, exploring its spatial variations and their linkage to water and heat factors. Our findings reveal a transition from strongly positive coupling in the northwest to weakly negative coupling in the southeast, peaking in spring. These spatial variations were attributed to water (soil moisture) and heat (air temperature), which explained 39% and 25% of the variability, respectively. The aridity index (AI), a water−heat synergy factor, was the dominant factor, explaining 66% of the spatial variation in ET−P coupling. As the AI increased, ET−P coupling shifted from strongly positive to weakly negative, with an AI around 0.7. This shift was determined by a shift in the evapotranspiration−lifting condensation level (LCL) coupling under an AI change. Regions with an AI below 0.7 experienced water-limited evapotranspiration, where increased soil moisture enhanced evapotranspiration, reduced sensible heat (H), and lowered LCL, resulting in a negative ET-LCL coupling. Conversely, regions with an AI above 0.7 experienced energy-limited evapotranspiration, where the positive ET−LCL coupling reflected a positive H−LCL coupling or a positive impact of LCL on evapotranspiration. This analysis advanced our understanding of the intricate influences of multi-factor surface interactions on the spatial variations of land−atmosphere coupling.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 03 June 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3209-8\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis study examines low-level jets (LLJs) across Northeastern China during both warm (June to September) and cold seasons (December to March) from 1957 to 2021, using fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis data with 25-km resolution. LLJs manifest in two prominent regions: one along the leeward flank of the Greater Khingan Mountains in the cold season and another at the center of Northeastern China in the warm season. The intricate interplay between ambient circulation and terrain shapes LLJ distribution, altitudes, wind directions, diurnal cycles, and seasonal diversities. During the warm season, prevailing southwesterly LLJs are found at 925 hPa, while the cold season features stronger and more frequent northwesterly LLJs at 875 hPa. Analysis of the diurnal patterns reveals distinctive behaviors of LLJs between the cold and warm seasons. During the warm season, the single peak in LLJ occurrence emerges around midnight, conversely, in the cold season, LLJs are most frequent shortly before midnight with an additional sub-peak in the morning. A momentum budget analysis establishes mechanisms underlying these two distinct diurnal variations. In both seasons, the diurnal variation of LLJs is predominately driven by inertial oscillation and mountain-valley circulation. However, the sub-peak observed in the cold-season morning arises from the (thermo-)dynamic interaction between the low-level atmosphere and complex terrain.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 03 June 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3377-6\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this study, we examined the dynamics and microphysical structures of a deep compact thunderstorm event driving cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning over the Nanjing area located within the Yangtze-Huai River Basin (YHRB) during the monsoon break period. The microphysical structures combined with the dynamics in the glaciated, mixed-phase, and warm phase layers during the formative, intensifying, and mature stages of the thunderstorm were first investigated using C-band polarimetric radar and CG lightning observations. The results showed thunderstorm during the mature stage produced a local cold pool, which collided with southerly warm wind, resulting in strong updraft. The strong updraft favored the lifting of raindrops to the mixed-phase region to form abundant supercooled liquid water and graupel. From the formative stage to the developing stage and further to the mature stage, increased ZH and reduced ZDR within the mixed-phase region has been found, especially within the strong updraft region (> 5 m s-1). This phenomenon suggested the evolution process of supercooled raindrops to large hydrometeors (graupel and hail), indicating strong riming process. These signatures showed a favorable environment for thunderstorm electrification, and resulting in most frequent lightning during the thunderstorm life cycle.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 03 June 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3319-3\n\nAbstract:\n\nGrid forecasting can be used to effectively enhance the spatial and temporal density of forecast products, thereby improving the capability of short-term marine disaster forecasting and warnings in terms of proximity. The traditional method that relies on forecasters' subjective correction of station observation data for forecasting has been unable to meet the practical needs of refined forecasting. To address this problem, this paper proposes a transformer-enhanced UNet (TransUNet) model for wave forecast artificial intelligence (AI) correction, which fuses wind and wave information. The Transformer structure is integrated into the encoder of the UNet model, and instead of using the traditional upsampling method, the dual-sampling module is employed in the decoder to enhance feature extraction capability. This paper compares the TransUNet model with the traditional UNet model using wind speed forecast data, wave height forecast data, and significant wave height reanalysis data provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The experimental results indicate that the TransUNet model yields smaller root-mean-square errors, mean errors, and standard deviations of the corrected results for the next 24-hour forecasts than does the UNet model. Specifically, the root-mean-square error decreased by more than 21.55% compared to its precorrection value. According to the statistical analysis, 87.81% of the corrected wave height errors for the next 24-hour forecast were within ±0.2 m, with only 4.56% falling beyond ±0.3 m. This model effectively limits the error range and enhances the ability to forecast wave heights.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 27 May 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3344-2\n\nAbstract:\n\nIdealized numerical simulations have been carried out to reveal the complexity in the development of asymmetric convection in a tropical cyclone (TC) under the influence of an environment with either uniform flow, vertical wind shear (VWS), or both. Results show that rainwater is enhanced to the right of the motion in the outer rainband but upshear-left in the inner-core region. Further, due to the asymmetries introduced by the environment flow, wavenumber-1 temperature and height anomalies develop at a radius of ~1000 km at the upper levels. A sub-vortex aside from the TC center encompassing the wavenumber-1 warm center appears, and asymmetric horizontal winds emerge, which in turn changes the storm-scale (within 400 km) VWS. Deep convection in the inner core follows closely the changing storm-scale VWS when its magnitude is larger than 2 m s-1 and is located downshear of storm-scale VWS in all the experiments with environmental flow. In the outer rainbands, the maximum boundary layer convergence is mostly controlled by the motion direction and located in the rear-right quadrant. These results extend the previous studies on three aspects: (1) The discovery of the roughly linear combination effect from uniform flow and large-scale VWS. (2) The development of upper-level asymmetric winds on a thousand-kilometer scale through the interaction between the TC vortex and environmental flow, resulting in changes in the storm-scale VWS pattern within the TC area. (3) The revelation that TC asymmetric convection closely aligns with the direction-varying storm-scale VWS instead of the initially designated VWS.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 27 May 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3221-z\n\nAbstract:\n\nCloud vertical structure (CVS) strongly affects atmospheric circulation and cloud radiative transfer, yet long term ground-based observations are scarce over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) despite its vital role in global climate. This study utilizes ground-based lidar and Ka-band cloud profiling radar (KaCR) measurements at Yangbajing (YBJ), TP, from October 2021 to September 2022, to characterize cloud properties. A novel anomaly detection algorithm (LevelShiftAD) is proposed for lidar and KaCR profiles to identify cloud boundaries, demonstrating satisfactory performance. Cloud base heights (CBH) retrieved from KaCR and lidar observations show good consistency, with a correlation coefficient of 0.78 and a mean difference of -0.06 km. Cloud top heights (CTH) derived from KaCR match well with FengYun-4A and Himawari-8 products. Thus, KaCR measurements serve as the primary dataset for investigating CVSs over the TP. Different diurnal cycles occur in summer and winter. Diurnal cycle exhibits pronounced increase of cloud occurrence frequency in the afternoon and decrease in early morning in winter, while cloud amount remains high all the day, with scattered increases at night in summer. Summer features more frequent clouds with larger geometrical thickness, higher multi-layer ratio, and greater inter-cloud spacing. Around 26% of cloud bases occur below 0.5 km. Winter exhibits bimodal distribution of cloud base heights at 0-0.5 km and 2-2.5 km. Single-layer and geometrically thin clouds prevail at YBJ. This study enriches long-term measurements of CVS over the TP, and the robust anomaly detection method helps quantify cloud macro-physical properties via synergistic lidar and radar observations.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 21 May 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3312-x\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe three-dimensional ocean subsurface temperature and salinity structures (OST/OSS) in the South China Sea (SCS) play crucial roles in oceanic climate research and disaster mitigation. Traditionally, the real-time OST and OSS are mainly obtained through in-situ ocean observations and simulation by ocean circulation models, which are usu-ally challenging and costly. Recently dynamical, statistical or machine learning models are proposed to invert the OST/OSS from sea surface information, however, these models mainly focused on the inversion of monthly OST and OSS. To address this issue, we apply clustering algorithms and employ a stacking strategy to ensemble three models (XGBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM), to invert the real-time OST/OSS based on satellite-derived data and Argo dataset. Subsequently, a fusion of temperature and sa-linity is employed to reconstruct the OST and OSS. In the validation dataset, the depth-averaged Correlation (Corr) of estimated OST (OSS) is 0.919 (0.83) and an av-erage Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is 0.639℃ (0.087 psu), with a depth-averaged coefficient of determination (R^2) of 0.84 (0.68). Notably, at the thermocline where the base models exhibit maximum error, stacking-based fusion model exhibited significant performance enhancement, with a maximum enhancement in OST and OSS inversion exceeding 10%. We further found that the estimated OST and OSS exhibits good agreement with the HYCOM data and BOA_Argo dataset during the passage of a mesoscale eddy. This study shows that the model we proposed can effectively invert the real-time OST and OSS, thereby potentially en-hancing the understanding of multi-scale oceanic processes in the SCS.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 21 May 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3367-8\n\nAbstract:\n\nControl of desertification can not only ameliorate the natural environment of arid regions but also convert desertified land into significant terrestrial carbon sinks, thereby bolstering the carbon sequestration capacity of arid ecosystems. However, longstanding neglect of the potential carbon sink benefits of desertification management, and its relationship with environmental factors has limited the exploration of carbon sequestration potential. Based on CO2 flux and environmental factors of artificial protective forest in Taklamakan Desert (TD) from 2018 to 2019, we found that the carbon storage capacity of the desert ecosystem increased approximately 140-fold after the establishment of an artificial shelter forest in the desert, due to plant photosynthesis. Precipitation levels < 2 mm had no impact on carbon exchange in the artificial shelter forest, whereas a precipitation level of approximately 4 mm stimulated a decrease in the vapour pressure deficit over a short period of about three days, promoting photosynthesis and enhancing the carbon absorption of the artificial shelter forest. Precipitation events > 8 mm stimulated soil respiration to release CO2 and promoted plant photosynthesis. In the dynamic equilibrium where precipitation stimulates both soil respiration and photosynthesis, there is a significant threshold value of soil moisture at 5 cm (0.12 m3 m-3), which can serve as a good indicator of the strength of the stimulatory effect of precipitation on both. These results provide important data support for quantifying the contribution of artificial afforestation to carbon sequestration in arid areas, and provide guidance for the development and implementation of artificial forest management measures.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 21 May 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3301-0\n\nAbstract:\n\nTropical cyclone (TC) is one of the greatest natural disasters. Accurate TC activity predictions are key to disaster prevention and mitigation. Recently, TC track prediction has made significant progress, but the improvement in intensity prediction is obviously lagging behind. At present, research on TC intensity prediction takes atmospheric reanalysis data as the research object and mines the relationship between TC-related environmental factors and intensity through deep learning. However, the reanalysis data are non-real-time in nature, which does not meet the requirements for operational forecasting applications. Therefore, a TC intensity prediction model named Inten-Pre is proposed, which can simultaneously extract the symmetry degree of strong TC convective cloud and convection intensity, and fuse the deviation-angle variance with satellite images to construct the correlation between TC convection structure and intensity. For TCs’ complex dynamic processes, a convolution neural network (CNN) is used to learn their temporal and spatial features. For real-time intensity estimation, multi-task learning acts as an implicit time-series enhancement. The model is designed with a rolling strategy that aims to moderate the long-term dependent decay problem and improve accuracy for short-term intensity predictions. Since multiple tasks are correlated, the loss function of 12 h and 24 h are corrected. After testing on a sample of TCs in the Northwest Pacific, with a 4.48 kts root mean square error (RMSE) of 6 h intensity prediction, 5.78 kts for 12 h and 13.94 kts for 24 h. TC records from official agencies are used to assess the validity of the Inten-Pre.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 21 May 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3222-y\n\nAbstract:\n\nAerosol optical depth (AOD) and fine particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5μm (PM2.5) play crucial roles in air quality, human health, and climate change. However, the complex correlation of AOD–PM2.5 and the limitations of existing algorithms pose a significant challenge in realizing the accurate joint retrieval of these two parameters at the same location. On this point, a multi-task learning (MTL) model, which enables the joint retrieval of PM2.5 concentration and AOD, is proposed and applied on the top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance (TOAR) data gathered by the Fengyun-4A Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (FY-4A AGRI), and compared to that of two single-task learning (STL) models, namely, random forest (RF) and deep neural network (DNN). Specifically, The MTL model achieved a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.88 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.10 in AOD retrieval. In comparison to the RF model, the R2 increased by 0.04, the RMSE decreased by 0.02, and the percentage of retrieval results falling within the expected error range (Within-EE) rose by 5.55%. The R2 and RMSE of PM2.5 retrieval by MTL model are 0.84 and 13.76 μg·m–3, respectively. Compared with the RF model, the R2 increased by 0.06, the RMSE decreased by 4.55 μg·m–3, and the Within-EE increased by 7.28%. Additionally, compared to the DNN model, the MTL model showed an increase of 0.01 in R2 and a decrease of 0.02 in RMSE in AOD retrieval, with a corresponding increase of 2.89% in Within-EE. ......\n\n, Manuscript accepted 21 May 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4032-y\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Medium-Resolution Spectral Imager-II (MERSI-II) instrument aboard China's Fengyun-3D satellite shares similarities with NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, enabling the retrieval of global aerosol optical depth (AOD). However, there are currently no officially released operational MERSI-II aerosol products over the ocean. This study focuses on adapting the MODIS dark target (DT) ocean algorithm to the MERSI-II sensor. A retrieval test is conducted on the 2019 MERSI data over the global ocean, and the retrieved AODs are validated against ground-based measurements from the automatic Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and the shipborne Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN). The operational MODIS DT aerosol products are also used for comparison purposes. The results show that MERSI-II AOD granule retrievals are in good agreement with MODIS products, boasting high correlation coefficients (R) of up to 0.96 and consistent spatial distribution trends. Furthermore, the MERSI-II retrievals perform well when compared to AERONET and MAN measurements, with high R values (>0.86). However, the low-value retrievals from MERSI-II tend to be slightly overestimated compared to MODIS, despite both AODs displaying a positive bias. Notably, the monthly gridded AODs over the high latitudes of the northern and southern hemispheres suggest that MERSI-II exhibits greater stability in space and time, effectively reducing unrealistically high-value noise in the MODIS products. These results illustrate that the MERSI-II retrievals meet specific accuracy requirements by maintaining the algorithmic framework and most of the algorithmic assumptions, providing a crucial data supplement for aerosol studies and climate change.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 09 May 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3217-8\n\nAbstract:\n\nDroughts that occurred in selected areas located in homogeneous regions of South America during the austral springs (SON) and summers (DJF) of the period 1982‒2019 are identified using SPI. Four areas were analyzed for droughts in SON and three areas in DJF. The areas in the Amazon suffered the majority of droughts in El Niño years while most of the droughts that occurred in the area of south Brazil, Uruguay, and north Argentina occurred during La Niña years. In the areas that comprise southeast and central west Brazil, the droughts occurred during both phases of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and in neutral years. Thus, other processes besides ENSO can be related to the observed droughts. The droughts were looked for in each area and month, and composites of atmospheric and oceanic variables during both seasons were analyzed for the selected cases. Regional and large-scale field composites were examined to identify the main processes associated with dry conditions in the different areas. Regional features were related to the influence of high pressure over south and southeast areas and divergence of humidity flux in all areas. Meridional circulations contributed to subsidence over the dry regions. The large-scale characteristics include SST anomalies, wavetrains over the South Pacific Ocean with centers of action over South America that produced subsidence in the study areas, and convection anomalies in the Maritime continent and surroundings. Therefore, the droughts were associated with a combination of regional and large-scale features that produced subsidence over the analyzed regions.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 09 May 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3339-z\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this study, a latent heat nudging lightning data assimilation (LDA) method independent of the flash rate was developed and tested with data from the Lightning Mapping Imager (LMI) onboard the Feng-Yun-4A (FY-4A) satellite based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. In this LDA method, the positive temperature perturbations at the lightning location are first calculated by the difference between the moist adiabatic temperature of a lifted air parcel and the model temperature. Then the positive temperature perturbations in the mixed-phase region are assimilated by a nudging method to adjust the latent heat within the convective system. Meanwhile, the water vapor mixing ratio is adapted to the temperature perturbations accordingly to maintain the relative humidity unchanged. This method considers the physical nature of the convective system, in contrast with other LDA methods that establish the empirical or statistical relationship between the lightning flash rates and model variables. The impact of this LDA method on short-term (≤6 h) forecasts was evaluated using two severe convective events in eastern China: a multi-region heavy rainfall event and a thunderstorm high wind event. The results showed that LDA could add thermodynamic information associated with the convective system to the WRF model during the nudging period, leading to a more reasonable storm environment. In the forecast fields, the simulations with LDA produced more realistic convective structures, resulting in an improvement in forecasts of precipitation and high winds.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 08 May 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4034-9\n\nAbstract:\n\nWood density (WD) is an important quality and functional trait of wood. However, despite the relationships between WD and abiotic factors being important to model or predict spatial distributions of functional traits, as well as responses of vegetation to climate changes, in current Earth system models or dynamic global vegetation models (ESMs/DGVMs), WD is often oversimplified, being defined as a globally uniform constant either for all plant functional types (PFTs) or for each individual PFT. Such oversimplifications may lead to simulation biases in the morphology of woody PFTs, as well as ecosystem transition and vegetation–atmosphere interactions. Moreover, existing conclusions about the relationships between WD and abiotic factors drawn from field observations remain mixed, making model parameterization improvements difficult. This study systematically investigated the influences of climate and soil factors on WD across various PFTs. Optimal fitting models for predicting WD within each PFT were then constructed by utilizing our collated global database of 138 604 observations. For WDs of tree PFTs, climate emerges as a more influential factor than soil characteristics, whereas for shrub PFTs the effects of climate and soil are of equivalent significance. Across all six PFTs, correlation coefficients between predictions by fitting models and observed WD range from 0.49 to 0.93. The predicted and observed WD exhibit good agreement across climate space. It is expected that the incorporation of our research findings into DGVMs will improve the simulation of tree height and forest fractional coverage, particularly in the central forest areas and forest transition zones.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 08 May 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4034-9.\n\nAbstract:\n\nWood density (WD) is an important wood quality and functional trait.

Based on the data analyses spanning 1979–2022, our results show that the increased rainfall amounts are associated with a more pronounced Mongolian cyclone (MC) in July-August, a manifestation of a portion of the Eurasian barotropic Rossby wave train. Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the North Atlantic (NA) regulate this wave train, with SST increases leading to its amplification. Somewhat independently, a delayed end to the rainy season in September is related to an enhanced anticyclone over the Kuril Islands (ACKI) in the Russian Far East. This anticyclone originates in the Arctic region, possibly induced by the loss of sea ice in the East Siberian Sea, a condition that can be detected two months in advance. The stronger MC and ACKI jointly contribute to the observed enhancement in the East Asian summer monsoon in NEA since 2000 by facilitating ascending motion and moisture transport. Therefore, the SST anomaly in the NA, which is responsible for the intensified rainfall in the rainy season in NEA, coupled with the sea ice conditions in the East Siberian Sea, provides a potential prediction source for the retreat of the rainy season.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 08 May 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4004-2\n\nAbstract:\n\nRecently, extreme meteorological droughts have affected China, causing terrible socioeconomic impacts. Despite previous research on the spatiotemporal characteristics and mechanisms of drought, two crucial issues remain seldom explored. First, an event-oriented drought chronology with detailed spatiotemporal evolutions is urgently required. Second, the complex migration patterns and diversity of synchronous temperature extremes need to be quantitatively investigated. Accordingly, the main achievements of our investigation are as follows. We produced an event-oriented set of extreme meteorological droughts over China through the application of a newly developed 3D DBSCAN-based detection method (deposited on https://doi.org/10.25452/figshare.plus.25512334), which was verified with a historical atlas and monographs on a case-by-case basis. In addition, distinctive migration patterns (i.e., stationary/propagation types) are identified and ranked, considering the differences in latitudinal zones and coastal/inland locations. We also analyze the diversity of synchronous temperature extremes (e.g., hotness and coldness). Notably, an increasing trend in hot droughts occurred over China since the late 1990s, predominantly appearing to the south of 30°N and north of 40°N. All drought events and synchronous temperature extremes are ranked using a comprehensive magnitude index, with the 2022 summer-autumn Yangtze River hot drought being the hottest. Furthermore, Liang-Kleeman information flow-based causality analysis emphasizes key areas where the PDO and AMO influenced decadal variations in coverages of droughts and temperature extremes. We believe that the achievements in this study may offer new insights into sequential mechanism exploration and prediction-related issues.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 07 May 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-4062-5\n\nAbstract:\n\nTides represent a crucial dynamic process in the ocean and play a vital role in both marine and atmospheric studies; thus, accurate simulation of tidal processes is of the utmost importance in tidal circulation models. Based on the sequential data assimilation method and the concept of the Kalman gain matrix, this paper proposes a new nudging method with spatially dependent coefficients for tidal assimilation. The spatial-dependent nudging method not only retains the advantages of the traditional nudging method but also facilitates the direct determination of a more reasonable spatial distribution of nudging coefficients. Utilizing the \\begin{document}$ {M}_{2} $\\end{document} tidal constituent (the main lunar semidiurnal tide) as an illustration, we conducted assimilation experiments of sea-level data to the barotropic circulation and tide model to assess the global harmonic constants of the \\begin{document}$ {M}_{2} $\\end{document} constituent. The results demonstrate that the spatial-dependent nudging method successfully mitigates deviations of tidal phase lag. Following assimilation using the new method, the deviations of the \\begin{document}$ {M}_{2} $\\end{document} tidal amplitude and phase lag can be reduced by 47% and 18% compared to the traditional nudging method, respectively, while the respective values for the non-assimilated case are as much as 9% and 11%. We also applied the S-nudging method to realistic tidal simulations and noted a significantly enhanced effectiveness relative to traditional methods, making it highly valuable for modeling oceanic tidal circulations.\n\n, Manuscript accepted 07 May 2024, doi: 10.1007/s00376-024-3346-0\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe diurnal temperature range (DTR) serves as a vital indicator reflecting both natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change. This study investigates the historical and projected multitemporal DTR variations over the Tibetan Plateau. It assesses 23 climate models from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) using CN05.1 observational data as validation, evaluating their ability to simulate DTR over the Tibetan Plateau. Then, the evolution of DTR over the Tibetan Plateau under different shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios for the near, middle, and long term of future projection are analyzed using 11 selected robustly performing models. Key findings reveal: (1) Among the models examined, BCC-CSM2-MR, EC-Earth3, EC-Earth3-CC, EC-Earth3-Veg, EC-Earth3-Veg-LR, FGOALS-g3, FIO-ESM-2-0, GFDL-ESM4, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MPI- ESM1-2-LR, and INM-CM5-0 exhibit superior integrated simulation capability for capturing the spatiotemporal variability of DTR over the Tibetan Plateau. (2) Projection indicates a slightly increasing trend in DTR on the Tibetan Plateau in the SSP1-2.6 scenario, and decreasing trends in the SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SPP5-8.5 scenarios. In certain areas, such as the southeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, western hinterland of the Tibetan Plateau, southern Kunlun, and the Qaidam basins, the changes in DTR are relatively large. (3) Notably, the warming rate of maximum temperature under SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SPP5-8.5 is slower compared to that of minimum temperature, and it emerges as"
