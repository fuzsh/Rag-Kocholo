        "text": "Distances:\n\nFrom the Limantour Beach parking lot: 5.4 miles (8.6 km) roundtrip, easy\n\nFrom the Laguna Trailhead: 6.6 miles (10.6 km) roundtrip, easy/moderate\n\nFrom the Coast Trailhead: 8.6 miles (13.8 km) roundtrip, easy\n\nAn easy to moderate walk through coastal scrub and grassland offers some breath-taking ocean views and leads to the rocky shoreline of Sculptured Beach, where one can look for intertidal organisms when the tide is very low. Visit our tidepooling for more information and please follow Leave No Trace's Tips for Tide Pooling. Consult a tide chart and local weather forecasts before setting out on your trip; venturing on to Sculptured Beach during hazardous surf conditions or a high tide can result in becoming trapped against the coastal bluffs. Visit the park's Beach Safety page for more information.\n\nSome of this area was burned in 2020, when lightning strikes in the Woodward Valley started what became the 2020 Woodward Fire. There are vault toilets and potable water available at Coast Campground.\n\nSculptured Beach and the Laguna Trail, the Fire Lane Trail, and the Coast Trail southeast of Coast Campground are within the Phillip Burton Wilderness. Please practice Leave No Trace principles.\n\nThe routes described below pass through or by Coast Campground, where you can refill your water bottle at one of the campgrounds water faucets, or use the vault toilets.\n\nClosest Trailheads to Sculptured Beach\n\nLimantour Beach. There are two parking lots at Limantour Beach:\n\nThe main parking lot is located on the right as one descends Limantour Road toward the beach. It has a gravel surface and has space for a couple hundred vehicles.\n\nA small paved parking lot is located at the end of a spur road that leads east from Limantour Road just before one reaches the main lot. This parking lot only has 16 parking spaces. If you arrive early enough to park in one of these spaces (or are lucky to find a space later in the day), the hike to and from Sculptured Beach will be ~0.8 km (1.3 km) shorter roundtrip.\n\nLaguna Trailhead\n\nCoast Trailhead\n\nDirections to Sculptured Beach\n\nThere are dozens of hiking routes that lead to Sculptured Beach. Even from the three closest trailheads (routes from which are described below), there are six or more different combinations of hiking on trails or walking on the beach that will get one to and from Sculptured Beach. This is due to how the Coast Trail runs parallel to the beach with three locations at which one can descend from the trail to the beach.\n\nPlease note: Storms in early 2023 caused significant damage to the Sculptured Beach Trail and the route is no longer a trail that the park will recognize or maintain. Please refrain from using it.\n\nBeach Access Trails that connect with the Coast Trail\n\nCoast Trail's Limantour Beach Access Trail: This short connector trail is ~0.6 miles (0.9 km) from the small paved lot or ~1 mile (1.6 km) from the main parking lot at Limantour Beach. Or, if hiking from the Coast Trailhead, follow the Coast Trail for 1.9 miles (3 km). Or, if coming from Coast Campground, follow the Coast Trail west for 1.1 miles (1.8 km) or walk west on the beach for 0.8 miles (1.3 km). Look for a lone large pine tree growing on the edge of a low bluff. Just west of the tree is a 100-foot-long (30-meter-long) sandy path leading from the beach to Coast Trail.\n\nCoast Campground's Santa Maria Beach Access Trail: The second location to connect between the beach and the Coast Trail is at the Coast Campground. From the Coast Trail, a 600-foot-long (180-meter-long) dirt path branches off of the Coast Trail to the north of site 8, passing to the left of some hitching rails and, further along the path, to the right of a lone eucalyptus tree. This path descend along the east side of a creek that flows down to Santa Maria Beach. From the beach, this path isn't as obvious, especially if one is walking along the water's edge. Pay attention to the height of the bluffs. To the west of this beach access, the bluffs are significantly lower than to the east. The creek can also serve as a landmark. During drier periods, the creek's water may not stay above the surface of the beach all the way to the bay, but during the winter and spring, water from the creek will frequently flow over the sand to the bay, forcing one to get at least the soles of their shoes wet as they cross the creek. Coming from the west, it will be the first significant creek that flows onto the beach east of Limantour Beach's parking lots. Coming from the west, the Santa Maria Beach Access Trail is ~1.4 miles (2.2 km) from Limantour Beach's small parking lot and ~1.8 miles (2.9 km) from the main lot, and 0.8 miles (1.3 km) from the Coast Trail's Limantour Beach Access Trail. Coming from the east (e.g., from Sculptured Beach), it will be the second creek one crosses after leaving Sculptured Beach, which is 0.8 miles (1.3 km) away.\n\nDirections from the Limantour Beach parking lots\n\nFollow the path from either parking lot at Limantour Beach to the beach and head southeast on the beach for 2.1 miles (3.4 km) if you started from the smaller paved parking lot or 2.4 miles (3.8 km) if you started from the main parking lot. So long as the tide is low enough, you should be able to walk along the water's edge all the way to Sculptured Beach.\n\nDirections from the Laguna Trailhead\n\nThis route steadily ascends the 0.8-mile-long (1.3-kilometer-long) southern leg of the Laguna Trail to a 400-foot-high (120-meter-high) ridge crest from which Drakes Bay is visible. The route then descends via the 1-mile-long (1.6-kilometer-long) southern leg of the Fire Lane Trail to the Coast Trail just north of the Coast Campground. Turn left on the Coast Trail for 0.1 miles (160 m) to reach the Coast Campground and it's Santa Maria Beach Access Trail. Descend to the beach and walk along the water's edge for 0.8 miles (1.3 km) to get to Sculptured Beach. (This route is dependent upon the tide being low enough for safe passage along the base of the bluffs.) Return along the beach to the Coast Campground, where you can either return to the Laguna Trailhead via the Fire Lane and Laguna trails. Or follow the Coast Trail to the Coast Trailhead, which is located across the Laguna Road from Limantour Lodge. Turn right on to Laguna Road and walk a short distance along the road to return to your vehicle.\n\nDirections from the Coast Trailhead\n\nFollow the Coast Trail for 2.8 miles (4.5 km) alongside a stream and then through bluff-top coastal grasslands to the Coast Campground. (As described above, one may descend to the beach after hiking 1.9 miles [3.1 km], if one so desires.) To return to the Coast Trailhead, retrace your steps. Alternatively, as described above, there are a number of other options, including returning via the Fire Lane and Laguna Trails to make your hike more of a loop hike. To do so, turn right onto the Fire Lane Trail 0.1 mile (0.2 km) west of the Coast Campground and follow the Fire Lane Trail and then the Laguna Trail 1.8 miles (2.9 km) back to the Laguna Trailhead. Walk through the Laguna Trailhead parking area to Laguna Road, turn left, and follow the road back to your vehicle at the Coast Trailhead.\n\nThe Coast Trail is a family-friendly, multi-use trail on which bicycles are allowed as far as Coast Campground. There is a bike rack bollard to which one may lock their bicycles near the Santa Maria Beach Access Trail junction. Visit the park's Bicycle Riding page for more information.\n\nBe Prepared\n\nThis route description alone is not a substitute for a trail map. Print out the Point Reyes National Seashore's South District trail map (3,422 KB PDF) before your visit, or pick one up at the Bear Valley Visitor Center on your way.\n\nAlways check current conditions before heading out into the park and familiarize yourself with park regulations. Please practice Leave No Trace principles.\n\nVisit the park's Hiking at Point Reyes National Seashore page for hiking tips and information about trail etiquette and safety."
