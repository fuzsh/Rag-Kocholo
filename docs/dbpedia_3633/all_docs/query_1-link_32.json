The graph is for the current day.\n\nWe use Xtides program to generate our tidal graphs.\n\nA very good summary of how Tides are calculated and a great general FAQ can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.flaterco.com/xtide/faq.html#50\n\nOur historical wind archives include a wealth of wind graphs & data, going back as far as 30 years in the case of some popular stations. Click the arrows to go backward or forward in time. You can also use the calendar button to select a specific date, or click View Month to see an entire month's worth of archived wind graphs all at once.\n\nRaw, numerical data:\n\nIf you're looking for raw numerical data, click here to inquire about our data download packages.\n\nThe left side shows the number of days per month a specific weather station reported average winds greater than 15, 20, and 25 miles per hour. The Right side shows the percentage of time that the weather station reported a specific wind direction for the highlighted month. The data has not been error checked.\n\nOptions:\n\nAll Time (default) - This data is the average over the years available in our database.\n\nSpecific Years - These are specific statistics for a given year. Hovering your mouse over a month will tell you how many days and how many days that station reported.\n\nGust vs. Average - WeatherFlow stations are positioned in very good spots to capture ambient wind conditions and averages often reflect actual winds experienced on the water. However, we also include stations from many other sources that may not be ideally placed and gusts can often be a better indicator of conditions.\n\nFor more detailed premium wind statistics click here"
