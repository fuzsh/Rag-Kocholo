We believe that an under- standing of the degree to which intelligence agencies at- tempt to manipulate religion and organized churches is even more essential today than it was in 1975, when Sena- tor Church's Committee examined the CIA's use of mis- siori ries as spies. Central America threatens to become another Vietnam for U.S. involvement, and in many countries repression against the poor has become brutal beyond comprehen- sion. The people of Central America are very religious, a factor on which the CIA has always relied, as noted in Sources and Methods, and elsewhere in this issue. Using religious beliefs against the people and controlling and manipulating religious-sponsored relief agencies is nothing new :or the CIA, as is shown in our articles on Thailand and Guatemala, and on the Miskitu Indians of Nicaragua. The reason for the critical role of religion in Central America is clearly the development of what is known as liberation theology. For hundreds of years, until the late 1950s and early 1960s, the church in Latin America primarily the Catholic Church- was essentially conserva- tive and therefore supportive of the repressive national security states. But in recent decades there has been a decisive shift in the emphasis of religious workers to an identification with the poor and underprivileged. Grass roots work flourished; the Second Vatican Council (1962-5) encouraged this work; and in 1968 the Medellin, Colombia conference of Latin American Bishops recognized the pri- macy of struggles against social injustice and the legiti- macy of those struggles even when violence was the only means left to achieve those goals.

And the Reagan administration was quick to recognize the overwhelming significance of this spiritual conflict. The Santa Fe document, prepared for President-elect Reagan, noted: \"The war is for the minds of mankind. Ideo-politics will prevail.... U.S. foreign policy must begin to counter (not react against) liberation theology as it is utilized in Latin America by the `liberation theology' clergy. The role of the church in Latin America is vital to the concept of political freedom . . . [found in] private property and productive capitalism.\" As we demonstrate throughout this issue, the New Right has attacked liberation theology both within the Catholic Church, among the Jesuits (see the article on Opus Dei), and within the Protestant denominations. The liberal Na- tional Council of Churches has been attacked and spied upon relentlessly, as have several of its denominational members which have actively supported social progress in Latin America. The attacks have come from sources as diverse as the Pope, evangelists, and Reagan administra- tion officials like Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, who has taken to telephoning bishops to ask if they know \"what's happening in Nicaragua.\" His cynicism and hypocrisy are apparently boundless, as he defends the regimes in El Salvador and Guatemala whose death squads systematically torture, mutilate, and murder thousands of poor people. Number 18 (Winter 1983) The significance of the evangelical groups-of which there are now hundreds in Central America- -is described in our articles on General Rios Montt of Guatemala, and on the Summer Institute of Linguistics. The Destabilization of Nicaragua The return to an era of rabid anti-communism and of a CIA unleashed is epitomized by the massive program to destabilize and overthrow the government of Nicaragua. In three articles in this issue we analyze various facets of that program, manipulation of the Church, manipulation of the Miskitu Indians, and the use of paramilitary bands. Paramilitary mercenary gangs have found great favor with the new administraiton, and meet, train, practice, and recruit in this country with impunity. Perspectives have become so warped that in Miami, for example, the city government voted a $ 10,000 grant for a \"homeless refugee center\" to Alpha 66, a terrorist group dedicated to the overthrow of the government of Cuba. Alpha 66 admitted that its concern for refugees extended only to training them to \"send them back as fighters.\" This Issue Once again, we must apologize to our readers for the lateness of this issue.

In July 1982, the third anniversary of the triumph of the revolution was celebrated in Masaya, with the slogan, \"Monimbo is Nicaragua,\" honoring the legendary bravery of the people of that poor district in the struggle against the bloody Somoza regime. Thus, to the enemies of that revolution there would be enormous propaganda value to an anti-Sandinista riot in Monimbo. And in August there was a concerted effort to create just such an illusion. All the elements of a compli- cated script were present: preliminary skirmishes, rumors, wild tales in the media, outside agitators, and more. The events themselves are well worth studying. The Father Carballo Incident O ie might have guessed that the right-wing press especially those professing to be Catholic-would have a field day. According to William Buckley's venemous Na- tional Review (September 17, 1982): \"Sandinista thugs jumped the archbishop's spokesman, Father Bismarck Carballo, at lunch, forced him to strip, and drove him through the streets.\" Reactionary columnist Patrick J. Buchanan was equally strident ( Washington Inquirer, Sep- tember 3, 1982): \"In the most recent and outrageous inci- dent, Rev. Bismarck Carballo, spokesman for the arch- dioc,-se, was set upon while lunching with a woman friend; both were stripped naked and paraded through the streets to jail where he was held six hours.\" But even some of the wire services, which purport to give both sides in a dispute, presented the above version as fact. The September 3 Associated Press article entitled, \"Church, Sandinistas On Collision Course,\" gave this ren- dition: \"In mid-August, the Rev. Bismarck Carballo was at the home of a woman parishioner when a gunman entered the house, forced the couple to undress and then pushed there into the street where a crowd of photographers and television crews from pro-government media were waiting.\" What none of these \"objective\"journalists reported was that the couple was caught in flagrante delicto, and the \"gunman\" was the woman's lover. Media people were nearby covering an embassy demonstration into which the terrified, naked priest practically collided. The journalists also failed to note that the government ordered the media not to publish reports or photos of the incident out of respect for the Church. However, when Father Carballo broke the silence by calling a press conference and pre- senting his incredible version, the censorship order was lifted and the incident-as well as Carballo--was fully revealed. Moreover, El Nuevo Diario subsequently learned that the priest and his \"parishioner\" had been having an affair for years, and it published an interview with the woman in which she admitted their relationship and pro- duced photos of the couple in bathing suits, trysting at the seaside. These additional facts appeared well before the pious denunciations by Buckley and Buchanan, including a re- port on the August 19 Reuters wire; they were not, of course, alluded to by the right-wing press. The same day as the Reuters report, the State Department denounced the \"treatment meted out to Carballo\" as a sign of a \"systemat- ic campaign against religion in Nicaragua.\" As recently as mid-December, a CBS-TV network news report made passing reference to the priest who had been stripped and beaten. Big lies, even outrageous and in- herently unbelievable big lies, die slowly. The Reporting On Masaya On certain events, everyone agreed. Monday, August 16, nearly 100 people barricaded themselves inside the Catho- lic Salesian School in Monimbo. Late in the day, when a large group of protesters assembled in the streets in front of the school, shots rang out three people were killed and six wounded. Patrick Buchanan wrote that \"outraged Catholic stu- dents seized high schools around the country, and in Mo- nimbo ... barricades were thrown up against Sandinista mobs and troops, and three people were killed and six wounded.\" Elliott Abrams, whose title is Assistant Secre- tary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, wrote a column for the August 22 Washington Post in which he claimed, \"violent clashes in Masaya between Sandinista mobs and Catholic school students and their supporters have resulted in three deaths....\" Even some progressive reporting was fuzzy; the September 1 Guardian said that \"shooting between pro- and anti-Sandinista dem- onstrators left at least two dead and seven wounded in Masaya August 16.\"(One of the wounded later died.) Most of these accounts give the impression, stated in some media reports, that \"Sandinistas killed students.\" What none of the explanations clarifies, however, is that the shooting came exclusively from inside the school, where the only armed people were gathered. The dead and wounded were government supporters, outside protesting the closing. Moreover, there were students on both sides, and virtually everyone was Catholic. When the dust settled it turned out that of the 18 people arrested inside the school-in rooms littered with spent rifle shells-only nine were local residents. The major role of outsiders as agents provocateurs and the rapid dissemi- nation of false and misleading propaganda suggest a well- planned scenario. Several days after the incident, CAIB editors visited Monimbo and interviewed residents. What Really Happened at Masaya? The Father Carballo incident led, indirectly, to the events which caused the greatest distortions in the media, as part of what appears to have been a carefully staged plan. A few days after the Carballo affair, there was a significant confrontation in Monimbo. On August 14, Mi- guel Obando y Bravo, the conservative Archbishop of 4 CovertAction Number 18 (Winter 1983) Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 Managua (see sidebar) came to Masaya to participate in a religious ceremony. During the procession, a large group of townspeople gathered and confronted the Archbishop, angry that he had not publicly denounced the recent mas- sacre at San Francisco del Norte. Other priests had spoken out against the brutal raid in which counterrevolutionary exiles from Honduras had killed 15 villagers and kid- napped eight others, but Obando y Bravo, the senior reli- gious figure in the country, had been strangely silent. The petitioning townspeople were rebuffed by followers of Obando y Bravo, a right-wing mob who took the oppor- tunity to throw rocks at them. Then, on the morning of Monday, August 16, the direc- tor of the Silesian School in Monimbo ordered it closed in protest against \"aggressions suffered by the Church.\" A number of youths who supported the closing occupied the school, barricading it against a large number of students, supporters of the government, who did not want it closed. Students and townspeople began gathering in the streets in front of the school, some in favor of the closing, most against. In one incident, a pedestrian was hit by a passing government car. The victim later stated that he had been pushed into the car by some strangers who were not from Monimbo. But this incident led to a near rampage by armed bands who appeared from the hills behind Masaya and attacked a police substation. It was these same armed bands who brought their weapons inside the school, al- though the people outside did not realize this at the time. Ultimately, after attempts to negotiate an opening of the school failed, townspeople and students began to march along the street in front of the school. As they neared the building shots rang out from inside. The marchers, who had no guns, dove for cover; three people were killed in the street and six others wounded. Shortly thereafter, security forces cleared the school, arresting 81 people. Five priests -a Spaniard who had evidently instigated the boy- cott and four Costa Ricans-were taken by the police to their respective embassies for protective custody. Within the next few days most of those arrested were released. Only those determined to be connected with the shootings were held. The residency permit of the Spanish director of the school was revoked and he was in effect deported; the other four priests returned to work at the school. Most revealing about the whole incident was the imme- diate, totally inaccurate reportage which swept around the world. Items noted above were mild compared to some. An Associated Press report which went out over their New York wire early the morning of August 17 stated that students \"took over at least 17 Roman Catholic schools around the country and protesters in Masaya barricaded their slum neighborhood against security forces.\" There were, in fact, three or four other student protests that day, though nothing as dramatic as in Monimbo. Moreover, protesters did not barricade the neighborhood from securi- ty forces; they demanded that security forces come in and arrest the persons inside the school who were shooting. At no time were the townspeople armed, which renders ques- tionable the following paragraph from the AP wire: \"`At this moment, as you can see, we're building barricades with paving stones to keep out police and groups of government supporters. They will surely come and we'll be obliged to confront them,' one armed resident of Monimbo, a slum on the edge of Masaya, told reporters.\" The article went on to report that \"some 2000 residents built barricades.\" This is incredible, since the only people barricaded anywhere were the 81 people inside the school-and only nine of them were local residents. More- over, the AP story \"from the scene\" doesn't even mention that people were killed! It is possible the story was outlined even before the events occurred. But even the AP reportage paled by comparison with some of the blatant Latin American disinformation pieces. The local reporter for Excelsior, the prestigious Mexico City daily, sent, he later said, two separate stories to his paper. One dealt with the subject of 81 people being arrest- ed. The other covered the fact that five foreign priests were in their embassies. The front page headline in Excelsior: \"Eighty-one Priests Arrested in Nicaragua.\" The following day Excelsior ran a correction confirming that there were no priests in jail in Nicaragua, but their original story was picked up all over the world. This anti-Sandinista media blitz indicates considerable coordination, exacerbated by the apparent willingness of the foreign press corps to believe anything anti- government. It is a sad indictment of the \"investigative\" journalists of Latin American coverage. Only now that the covert plot against Nicaragua has become so obvious are these same journalists jumping on the bandwagon. How many deaths might have been averted if they had done their homework earlier? Other Media Manipulation Some of the blatant distortions which have appeared in the Nicaraguan opposition press, and in papers in neigh- boring Honduras and Costa Rica and elsewhere, strongly suggest a coordinated campaign which can only be seen as an integrated part of the destabilization plot aimed at Nicaragua. The photograph on the cover of this issue shows townspeople in Masaya who were protesting the right-wing takeover of the Salesian School diving for cover as they were shot at from inside the school. The photo was sent by AP wire to Honduras and elsewhere, with, AP later insisted, the correct caption. Nevertheless, the following day it appeared in a major Tegucigalpa newspaper with a caption which said that it showed \"Catholics\" dodging \"Sandinista bullets.\" At the height of the tensions over events in Masaya, Bishop Salvador Schlaefer from the Atlantic coast was asked by the government to come to Managua to help in the various negotiations and meetings that were taking place. He was provided with government transportation. La Prensa editor Horacio Ruiz reported to the Brazilian paper Correo Brasileno, for which he was a correspondent, that Schlaefer had been arrested by the Sandinistas. He also gave this \"information\" to other reporters in Mana- gua, and the story, which was a complete lie, was reprinted everywhere. The situation became so confused that Bishop Schlaefer found it necessary to call a press conference to inform the media that he had not been arrested and was not in jail! Ruiz also writes for the conservative Costa Rican paper, La Nacion. His articles, denouncing press censorship in Nicaragua, have been reprinted in U.S. newspapers, in- cluding the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, without mentioning that he was La Prensa editor, a fact he finds convenient to omit.

And the Nicaraguans are a religious people. But the struggle is not between those who are for religion and those who are not; it is a struggle between progressive religious people and reactionary religious people. In such a struggle, when it is known that the largest propaganda agency in the world, the CIA, is actively involved, it is important for all observers to study events carefully, to be sure of what is really happening. Just as in the case of the Miskitus, discussed in detail elsewhere in this issue, the big lie is being used constantly. Total fabrications appear on the front pages of major newspapers around the world. Such covert operations are pernicious; the corrections never have the impact of the original lies. Nicaragua's friends must be extremely vigilant and must expose these lies immediately and consistently. Archbishop Obando y Bravo and the Institute on Religion and Democracy During the 1970s, the Catholic Church in Nicaragua became progressively more anti-Somoza, with the rank and file always leading the hierarchy. By 1974 the bishops would not attend Somoza's inauguration, and by 1977 they openly condemned the human rights viola- tions of the regime. But throughout this period church leaders, headed by the Archbishop of Managua, Msgr. Miguel Obando y Bravo, continued to stress the differ- ences between the tactics and politics of the rank and file opposition and that of themselves. The division was over the conflicting views of the revolution held by the two groups clearly a class di vision-though often couched by the hierarchy in reli- gious terminology. They represented the upper class opposition to Somoza which, after the triumph of the revolution, became more concerned with threats to its own class privileges. Obando y Bravo has become the focal point of oppo- sition to the Sandinista leadership. He plays a deeply political role, aligning himself often with U.S. interests, while pretending to speak \"only\" in his religious capaci- ty. He makes political statements with impunity, and at the same time criticizes the progressive priests for being \"political.\" In 1980, in fact, Obando y Bravo and his bishops ordered four priests serving in the government and in the party to resign their posts. The popular oppo- sit ion was so widespread that the order was rescinded. Msgr. Obando y Bravo (second from right) receives right- : IRD's Religion and Democracy Award. The hierarchy has also generated considerable con- flict within the Church and its parishioners by transfer- ring popular priests from their parishes whenever they think the local church is too supportive of the revolu- tion. Emotions have run so high that one congregation occupied a church to prevent the bishop from removing the sacraments after their priest was transferred, and a scuffle ensued. The Archbishop excommunicated all those involved, though there is considerable question whether he has the authority to do so. Obando y Bravo's role is highlighted by the fact that he has become the darling of the Institute on Religion and Democracy (IRD), a shady New Right outfit with deep ties to the CIA. IRD appears to be something of a cross between an intelligence proprietary and a front for Reagan administration policies. In January 1982, the IRD honored the Archbishop in Washington and de- voted considerable space in its newsletter to him. They also published a propaganda pamphlet entitled, \"Nica- ragua: A Revolution Against the Church?\" The IRD was founded in April 1981 as an autono- mous project of the Coalition for a Democratic Majori- ty (CDM). The CDM is a leading neo-conservative group, whose board includes Jeane Kirkpatrick. IRI) shared offices with another CDM special project, the defunct Citizen's Committee for Freedom in the Ameri- cas, whose board included Constantine Menges, now a high CIA official (see CA 1B Number 16), and William C. Doherty, Jr. of the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD), a CIA front. IRD itself is the brainchild of David Jessup, a right- wing Methodist layman, who has been attacking the progressive churches in the U.S. for several years. I R D's board members cover the neo-conservative spectrum, with notables from the American Enterprise Institute, Social Democrats U.S.A., the Ethics and Public Policy Center (of Nestle hack Ernest Lefever), Commentary magazine, and assorted evangelical and fundamentalist religious groups. IRD's affairs are worthy of further study. A recom- mended starting point is IDOC International Bulletin Number 8-9 (1982), \"An American Dream: Neo- Conservatism and New Religious Right in the USA: The Institute on Religion and Democracy.\"(Write to IDOC at 30 via S. Maria dell'Anima, Rome 00186, Italy.)

Throughout late 1981 and early 1982 there were per- sistent reports of a rapidly escalating paramilitary cam- paign against the government of Nicaragua. Counter- revolutionary forces were being assembled and trained in camps in Florida, California, and elsewhere in the U.S., and a network of bases were being established in Hon- duras, along the border with Nicaragua. Sprinkled throughout the reports were the names of wealthy Nicara- guan exiles, former members of Somoza's bloody National Guard, renegade Miskitu Indian leaders, and many vicious Cuban exiles-with long histories of working for the CIA. From the outset it was clear to the Nicaraguans, and to many outside observers, that the operations bore all the hallmarks of another CIA-sponsored plan. What distin- guished this plan from earlier escapades, however, was the rapidity with which confirmation was forthcoming in the establishment media. In the past it had taken years before U.S. officials, even anonymous ones, admitted the extent of covert U.S. operations in Southeast Asia, in Angola, in Iran, and elsewhere. Reports in foreign and progressive domestic media were discounted as paranoid fantasy or rhetoric. But in the case of Nicaragua, revelations are following hard on the heels of the incidents themselves. Covert actions have become almost overt actions. What the orgy of leaks and deep background admissions really means is a hotly debated point. Some observers believe that the revelations are designed to prepare the public for more and deeper involvement, to inure the pub- lic to further embroilment. But others believe that there is a sharp split within the intelligence complex and within the administration itself over the efficacy of paramilitary oper- ations in the Nicaraguan context, with some strong voices urging a more sophisticated plan. To develop some under- standing of what the future-the near future-will bring, it is helpful to review both the plan and the revelations. The National Security Council Plan The Reagan administration clearly inherited from its predecessor the germ of a program to destabilize the San- dinistas, but by and large that program was relatively non-violent. Economic and political pressures were al- ready in place and there were hints of paramilitary activity, but no widespread movement in that area. Under the Rea- gan team a new emphasis and a new urgency came into play. Some activity on the part of the exiles and their supporters was anticipatory. They knew that the Reagan administration would be very supportive, both ideological- ly and financially, and they began to create some of the infrastructure which would ultimately fit into the govern- ment's plan. \"At last we have a man in the White House Number 18 (Winter 1983) CovertAction 7 Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 with pants on,\" one exile leader was quoted as saying. But although paramilitary attacks against Nicaragua began to escalate during 1981, it was not until the end of that year that matters reached dramatic proportions. Why this came about was made clear in revelations which sur- faced in the media only a few months later, in February, March, and April of 1982. We now know that in November 1981 the administration asked the CIA to prepare an op- tion plan for increased covert paramilitary operations against Nicaragua; we also now know that in December the National Security Council approved various options in- cluding, most significantly, a plan to devote at least $19 million to the recruitment and training of a 500-man para- military force. This force, assembled directly by the CIA, would supplement the various anti-Sandinista groups which were also to be bolstered with financial and logistical support. All of them were to be coordinated along the Florida-Honduras-Costa Rica axis. The Role of Honduras As the operation was geared up, the CIA complement in Honduras more than tripled. The November 8, 1982 Newsweek magazine article put the figure at 50, the De- cember 4 New York Times at 150, the December 6 Time magazine at \"about 200,\" some of whom are said to be operatives under cover as AID officers, Peace Corps vo- lunteers, and Delta Force anti-terrorist troops. Honduras became the focus for operation coordination under the direct supervision of U.S. Ambassador John D. Negro- ponte. Additional work was performed by Assistant Secre- tary of Defense Nestor Sanchez, a veteran CIA officer (see CAIB Numbers 4 and 16) who was taken on by the Wein- berger Pentagon. Sanchez was seen in Honduras frequent- J.D. 1egroponte, the NSC's destabilizer in Tegucigalpa. ly in recent months. CIA Director William Casey personal- ly inspected the operation in a secret trip to Honduras. The direct cooperation of the Honduran military was essential, and was willingly provided by the commander in chief, strongman General Gustavo Adolfo Alvarez. Al- varez was, if anything, overanxious, and had to be re- strained from prematurely instigating an invasion of Nica- ragua in mid-1982. Fortunately, there are nationalistic elements within the Honduran military who fear, with considerable justification, that there would be no winner in such a confrontation, and that a lot of Hondurans would be killed needlessly. (See the Statement of John Buchanan, in this issue.) Nevertheless, Alvarez works closely with Negroponte and the commanders of the U.S. military ad- visers, and sees that his forces provide needed logistical support to the counterrevolutionary camps spread along the border with Nicaragua. The Argentina Connection Although the role of Honduras is clear and well- documented, a key part was assigned to Argentina, details of which have recently come to light. It was known for some time that a contingent of Argentinean military train- ers was in Honduras, helping to train the contras. The size of this force was reduced, though not eliminated, during the Malvinas crisis, when the U.S. did not support Argen- tina; but Argentinean participation has now, once again, expanded. In November, a defector from Argentina's military intel- ligence organization appeared on a long videotape first shown to journalists in Mexico City. The defector, Hector Frances, explained that Argentina was assisting the coun- terrevolutionaries in Honduras, in Costa Rica, and in Ar- gentina itself, where more than 50 Nicaraguan exiles were being trained. Argentina has served as a conduit for much of the CIA money being pumped into this plan, with Argentinean military officers meeting with and making payments to exile groups in Buenos Aires and in San Jose. What's Going On in Costa Rica? It was becoming clear to many journalists, and was confirmed by the Frances interview, that Costa Rica has been playing an ever expanding role in the campaign against Nicaragua. The administration of President Luis Alberto Monge has become more pro-U.S. as it has faced greater economic pressures. The situation was evidently so bad that President Monge was overheard to remark, on the way to the U.S. that he felt like a puts, but he did not want to be remembered as the president under whose adminis- tration Costa Rica went bankrupt. Frances confirmed that much of his work with the CIA, and with rightwing Costa Ricans, was to devise ways to pressure Monge, work which has been exceedingly successful. Monge has aided with Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, and against Mex- ico and Venezuela in the diplomatic battles over Nicara- gua, and even more importantly has begun to allow Costa Rica to be used for contra bases and attacks against Nica- raguan territory. In fact, splits in the counterrevolutionary forces have led to the establishment of two key forces in Costa Rica. One involves the renegade Miskitu Indians. The principal group, led by Steadman Fagoth, works closely with the hated former National Guardsmen, and is based in Hondu- 8 CovertAction Number 18 (Winter 1983) Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 ras, on the Atlantic Coast. A rival, Brooklyn Rivera, ap- parently fed up with playing second fiddle to Fagoth, moved to Costa Rica with some of his men, who are now staging minor, but annoying raids into Nicaragua con- stantly. Rivera states publicly that his men are not engaging in armed struggle, because \"the time is not right,\" but his men belie this, offering to take journalists with them on their incursions. The other force building up its base in Costa Rica is that of former Sandinistas Eden Pastora and Alfonso Robelo. Although Pastora was kicked out of Costa Rica some months ago, Monge has now allowed him back in, and he and Robelo continue to offer themselves as the \"alterna- tive\" to the Somocistas in Honduras. Pastora assumes an anti-U.S. stance publicly, but CA 1B has learned that this is a sham. Journalists have discovered that although Pastora maintains that he has no contact with the U.S. Embassy, there is, in fact, regular contact through Robelo. An Embassy official admitted that it would \"look bad for Pastora\" if he were seen meeting with them, so they meet with Robelo and give messages for Pastora; Pastora responds in the same fashion, through Robelo. Pastora too claims that he is not encouraging armed attacks against Nicaragua at this time, but a recent large attack from Costa Cica appears to have been coordi- nated by his supporters. Who Pulls The Strings? It is obvious that Honduras and Argentina and Costa Rica are not in any manner serving their own interests, but are participants in an operation conceived and run by the U.S. It is also obvious that the aim of this operation is the overthrow of the Nicaraguan government, though recent revelations have led to some incredible weaseling on the part of the Reagan administration and its apologists in Congress. When the details of the NSC plan first leaked out early in the year, the executive branch refused to comment, al- though some Members of Congress in the know, particu- larly Senator Barry Goldwater, the Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, confirmed the essentials of the plan. It was stated unequivocally at the time that the ad- ministration's chief concern was Nicaragua's alleged as- sistance in supplying arms to the FMLN in El Salvador. That this became, and has remained, the administration line shows a lot of gall, considering the facts. The U.S. government has been working hand in glove with exile fanatics dedicated to the overthrow of the Nicaraguan government; much of the paramilitary activity has been on the east coast, hundreds of miles from any potential route from Nicaragua to El Salvador, which in any event must pass through Honduras. Moreover, the contras themselves put the lie to the Salvador rationale. As recently as early December, Enrique Bermudez, a former colonel in Somo- za's National Guard and one of the leaders of the so-called Nicaraguan Democratic Front, stated, \"It is not acceptable to us to carry out missions to interdict Cuban and Russian supply lines to El Salvador. We are Nicaraguans and our objective is to overthrow the communists....\" Bermudez's comments were significant, because they were made the same day that the House of Representatives voted unanimously that no CIA funds should be used for any operation which was intended to overthrow the go- vernment of Nicaragua or which was intended to instigate a The Vatican Connection: Vernon Walters and the Pope In the world of the secret services, coincidences are much rarer than it would seem. That is why we can be forgiven for wondering whether there is any connec- tion between the October 18 visit of Ambassador at Large Vernon Walters to the Vatican and the papal demand, a few days later, that Roman Catholic priests resign from any posts they hold in the Nicara- guan government. Vernon A. Walters, CIA shuttler. The disclosures were separated by several weeks. The November 9, 1982 New York Times reported that retired General Walters had seen Pope Paul 11 several weeks earlier, and that right-wing columnists Evans and Novak suggested he was interceding against the impending move by the U.S. bishops to come out against nuclear weapons. But, the Times also noted, they \"discussed a range of issues, such as the situation ... in Central America.....\" Then, on December 8, 1982, the Times reported that \"in late October\" the Papal Nuncio in Managua had delivered to Daniel Ortega, the coordinator of the Nicaraguan junta, an ultimatum from the Pope that five priests with high positions in the government resign. Unnamed church officials gave the story to the media although neither the Nuncio nor the Vati- can would confirm it. The timing is highly suspect, to say the least. Wal- ters, a devout, conservative Catholic, and former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, would be the right man for the job, if the Reagan administra- tion did decide to put pressure on the Vatican. Wal- ters is something of an expert on Central America, with friends in high places in El Salvador and Gua- temala. He also has been intimately involved in some of the bloodiest CIA-sponsored coups, including Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Brazil in 1964, and Chile in 1973. It seems he is trying to add a Nicara- guan feather to his cap. He may not be successful, though. In mid- December there were reports that the Pope had agreed to a Central American visit including Nicara- gua whether or not the five priests resign. The Pope was no longer dealing with Ambassador Walters though, but with his boss, Secretary of State George Schultz, who paid a highly publicized visit to the Pontiff, replete with photo sessions.

This language, whicl. was supported by the Reagan administration, re- placed infinitely stronger language proposed by Represen- tative Harkin, which did not present the gaping semantic loophole found in this measure. The administration can continue to say that its intention is to interdict supplies, and if the groups they choose to do that work also happen to overthrow the government of Nicaragua, well, that was not their primary intention. Allies like Bermudez do not help put this flimflam across,. Nor do exposes from defectors like Frances. Nor, it is hoped, will the information which can come out during the course of a recently filed lawsuit. Sanchez et al. v. Reagan et al. On November 30, seven Nicaraguans, two Florida resi- dents and one Member of Congress filed suit against Presi- dent Reagan, Secretary of State Schultz, Secretary of De- fense Weinberger, Director of Central Intelligence Casey, Negroponte, Sanchez, and an assortment of Cuban and Nicaraguan exiles and organizations. The Nicaraguans are all victims of cross-border raids. One, Brenda Rocha, is a 16-year-old girl who was one of eight people tending a power plant in Bonanza, a mining town near the east coast. They were attacked by contras and the other seven were killed. She survived by pretending that she was dead; because of the wounds she received, she lost her right arm. Another plaintiff, Dr. Myrna Cun- ningham, is a medical doctor from the Miskitu Indian border area, where she practiced for seven years before the revolution. After the revolution she became health admin- istrator for northern Zelaya province, and, on a hospital visit in December 1981, she was kidnapped by contras, both Somocistas and Miskitus, along with the hospital administrator, a nurse, and their driver. She and the nurse were beaten and repeatedly raped, taken to Honduras for several hours, taken back across the river to Nicaragua, and finally released when the nearby villagers interceded. At the time of their release they were in the custody of Miskitus, who had been taking orders from the former Guardsmen who ran their camps in Honduras. Dr. Cun- ninghain, touring the United States in connection with the filing o Fthe case by the Center for Constitutional Rights in New Y Drk, remarked that she was sure she escaped only because the Somocistas were late in returning to the camp where she was being held. Dr. Cunningham described the bizarre rape scene during which the Miskitus were singing religious hymns and chanting religious slogans. She noted that the manipulation of many of the Miskitus by a handful of renegade pastors has been so deeply felt that they can indulge in the self-delusion that it is permissible to torture, murder, and rape so long as you believe that your victims are communists. The other Nicaraguans are all residents of the village of San Francisco del Norte, on the western border with Hon- duras. On July 24, 1982, at 6:00 a.m., a band of 80 to 100 contras swept into the defenseless village, massacred 15 people, wounded dozens more, and kidnapped eight others. The victims were hacked with knives and machetes, and some actually had their hearts cut out. These raiders, too, shouted religious and anti-communist slogans. The plaintiffs from this village include a 15-year-old boy who was one of those kidnapped. He was subsequently forced to act as a servant to the leader of the camp in Honduras to which he was taken and from which, two weeks later, he escaped. This boy, Javier Sanchez, reported seeing Hondu- ran soldiers at the contra camp every day, and said that in their march back to the camp on the first day, the band was protected by Honduran forces. Two other plaintiffs were wounded in the raid, and two lost family members. The Nicaraguan plaintiffs are suing under the Alien Tort Claims Act which allows foreigners to sue in U.S. courts for injuries received in violation of international law. They are arguing that the paramilitary attacks, which are often brutal beyond description, clearly violate international law including the Nuremberg Principles. They argue that the government defendants, as well as the Florida-based contras, are all part of a conspiracy to commit these viola- tions which stretches from the National Security Council right to the bandits in the camps on the border. The two Florida residents are alleging that the camps in Dade County violate many federal and local laws, but that the appropriate officials refuse to commence any prosecu- tions. They have, they assert, a separate right, under Flori- da nuisance laws, to complain of the illegal activities and ask the court to order them shut, even if the administration will not prosecute. Finally, a Member of Congress, Ronald V. Dellums of California, asserts that the secret war against Nicaragua violates the provision of the Constitution which states that only the Congress and not the President has the power to declare war. He also alleges that the action in Nicaragua violates the Neutrality Act, which prohibits hostile action against a nation with which the country is at peace, and the War Powers Resolution, which prohibits the introduction of U.S. personnel into hostile action without Congression- al approval. Recent Actions The attacks which are described in the lawsuit represent incidents through July 1982; later assaults have escalated both in number and in intensity, with substantial evidence of the introduction of more sophisticated weaponry. The greatest tragedy to date occurred on December 9, when a Nicaraguan helicopter evacuating Miskitu children from the Rio Coco area crashed, causing the death of 75 children and nine women. The downed aircraft was one of two participating in rescue missions, evacuating the remaining Indians from a border area which had been subject to the most intensive contra invasions. At presstime the precise cause of the crash was not known, although other partici- pating helicopters had been fired on by the contras during the day. These recent evacuations have been taking place in north- eastern Jinotega province, more than 100 miles from the Atlantic coast. The Miskitu in this area have been generally very supportive of the government, and have been subject to attacks from contras for more than a year. Conclusion The secret war against Nicaragua is being examined in the press and in the courts. But victory will come only in the minds and opinions of the American people. The exposes may show people what horrors are being committed in their name and with their tax millions. For once the clan- destine operations are being exposed while they are still in progress, and not, as had been so often the case, after all the damage and destruction and death is done. one 10 CoveirtAction Number 18 (Winter 1983) Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 Opus Del': Secret Order Vies For Power By Fred Landis Forgive Me Father I Have Killed A Man I Have Loved A Woman I Have Stolen For The Church I Am Opus Dei The support for a nuclear freeze recently given by the Conference of U.S. Catholic Bishops has fueled the international counterreformation within the Church. This backlash is being encouraged by the CIA with charges of \"Soviet influence,\" and is spearheaded by a secret Catholic lay order known as Opus Dei, who blame the liberal anti- nuclear position on their historic enemies, the Jesuits. In addition, the CIA views liberal Catholic support for liberation struggles in Central America as one of the principal obstacles in carrying out Reagan's directive to pacify El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. While using various fronts and agents in the field, the principal effort is at the Vatican: to neutralize Jesuits, support Opus Dei, and artificially create a panic by spreading disinformation concerning assassination plots against the Pope. During the space of one month (October-November 1982), Pope John Paul II elevated Opus Dei to the status of \"Personal Prelature\" and later to that of a Religious Order. This is a status that Opus Dei had sought since 1928 but which previous Popes had denied because 98% of the order are lay. Granting the status of religious order to a conspiratorial society of young, male, Latin, Fascists was a payoff for their considerable role in furthering the candidacy of Polish Cardinal Wojtyla as Pope. Origins Opus Dei was founded in Spain in 1928, but played no public role until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Then it was assigned by Franco the role of intellectual pacification; Opus Dei took over several universities and launched an inquisition against Masons, Marxists, liberals, and heretics. By 1965, Opus Dei controlled half of Franco's Cabinet and about a third of his Legislature. The founder of Opus Dei, Jose Maria Escriva de Balaguer, was ascetic, mystical, and crusading-closer in spirit to the Inquisition than to Don Quixote. For 20 years published articles have reported world membership at around 70,000. This is probably more a reflection on the compulsive secrecy of Opus Dei than an accurate measure of membership. Only two percent are priests and members of a kind of third order, the Societas Sacerdotalis Sanctae Crucis. This \"Sacerdotal Society of the Holy Cross\" runs Opus Del. The rest are lay members who raise the money and do the dirty work. The term Opus Dei is used loosely by the press to refer to both the priestly leadership and lay support, an ambiguity deliberately encouraged. As a strict legal matter, the recognition of the order accorded by the Vatican applies only to the priests, and not Opus Dei as a whole. A strict heirarchy was established in the Constitution, a self-proclaimed elite order of, in descending order: \"numeraries,\" \"oblates,\" and \"supernumeraries.\" In practice, there is a fourth category of \"collaborators.\" A \"numerary\" is described as \"single, of irreproachable physical appearance, high social status, higher education or its equivalent in wealth.\" Character traits viewed with favor in recruits are: intransigence, audacity, and loyalty. Females are not eligible for membership in the inner council as they cannot be priests. Married individuals or those of lower social status are \"supernumeraries.\" Prostrate before a wooden cross, the initiate swears an oath of fealty and secrecy. Escriva de Balaguer insisted that instead of a crucifix, an empty cross should be used for the initiation rite so that the inductee be made aware that the cross he sees before him is his cross. Every March 19, Opus Del members renew their vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience. Mortification of the flesh, ranging from cold showers to self-flagellation is common. The Constitution of Opus Dei is set forth in full as an Appendix to Jesus Ynfante's \"La Prodigiosa Aventura del Opus Dei,\" published in Madrid in 1973. Among the peculiar provisions one finds: \"98.1. \"After initiation, members may not leave of their own accord.\" \"191. \"Members must never reveal the names of other members and must never admit that they themselves are members.\" In recent years criticism of the internal workings of Opus Dei have focused on the practice of recruiting teenagers, Number 18 (Winter 1983) CovertAction 11 Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 not allowing members to quit or contact parents, and the practice of mortification of the flesh. Opus Dei moved its headquarters from Spain to Rome in 1947 but remains primarily a Spanish sect. Its current head's General Alvaro de Portillo, who first suggested to Pope John Paul II that Jesuit leader Pedro Arrupe be replaced. In an unprecedented move, the Pope appointed an outsider, the Reverend Paolo Dezza, as Superior General of the Jesuit order. This marked the first time in its history that the Jesuits were not allowed to select their own leader. Dezza is regarded as an Opus Dei ally and was formerly father confessor to John Paul I. The Influence on John Paul II The courting of John Paul II by Opus Dei began when he was still Archbishop of Krakow. First he was invited to give speeches at various Opus Dei colleges and later at their headquarters in Rome. These speeches were then collected in book form and printed by Opus Dei. During subsequent visits to Rome, Cardinal Wojtyla furthered his image as \"Papa bile\" by distributing copies of this Opus Dei book to all me tubers of the Vatican Secretariat of State. During his visit in August 1978, for the burial of Pope John Paul I, John Paul II prayed at the tomb of Opus Dei founder, Escriva de Balaguer. After his ascension to office, John Paul II received a succession of Opus Dei delegations and threw his support behind them in their struggle against the Jesuits. In fact, the Jesuits' current predicament is ironic in view of the fact that historically they were the right arm of the Pope and before Vietnam, closely collaborated with U.S. foreign policy interests. The sudden death of John Paul I was only one in a series of mysterious deaths of liberal Catholic officials. Only weeks before, the Bishop of Moscow died of a supposed heart attack at the age of 40 while in a Vatican ante- chamber waiting to see John Paul I. The relationship between the CIA and the Vatican is an old and natural one. The Catholic Church could be described as the oldest continually operated intelligence agency in the world. Joseph B. Smith, former head of the Worldwide Propaganda Guidance desk at the CIA, stated that he never felt like he fitted into the clandestine service because everyone else was Catholic. In an age in which Readers interested in pursuing the topic might want to begin with the urgent flight to Rome the night before the death of Pope John Paul I by Michael Ledeen. It is predictable that it would be Ledeen who would be in the forefront of those pushing the \"KGB plot to kill the Pope\" line. The story of an international Israeli-CIA Terror Net- work begins with James Jesus Angleton, former head of counterintelligence at CIA and Catholic zealot. While stationed in Rome he set up a network of 60 media agents and controlled CIA-Israeli MOSSAD collabora- tion. Over a period of 20 years, many of Angleton's media agents were recruited from the staff of Newsweek or The Washington Post in Rome. Claire Sterling was one of these; Michael Ledeen is her protege; Robert Moss is a fellow traveller. After the firing of Angleton in 1975, these Rome- based media agents lost their main contact in the CIA and came to rely more on the Israelis. Having lost An- gleton, the Israelis came to place greater importance on his network of agents. That is why Claire Sterling's post-1975 disinformation comes to rely more on Israeli sources. \"The KGB Plot To Kill the Pope\" makes its first appearance in the CIA-controlled Il Giornale Nuovo of Milan, Italy in May 1981. Before his incarnation as an assistant to General Vernon Walters, Ledeen had been a repcrter for this newspaper. The story gained interna- tional attention when the British Thames TV made a special on the plot citing as its source Il Giornale Nuovo. The Denton Senate Subcommittee on Security and Claire sterling, et al., and Terrorism next offered itself as a platform for Claire Sterling, Michael Ledeen, and Robert Moss. They all agreed that Agca could not have acted alone, and that his passage through Bulgaria was proof of Communist Soviet-KGB complicity. Robert Moss first came to public attention in 1973 as an Australian journalist writing about Allende's Chile. Claire Sterling worked in the 1950's for the CIA- controlled magazine The Reporter and later appeared at various conferences with CIA Director William Colby as an expert on Italian politics. Michael Ledeen is a Schlockmeister with an uncanny ability to turn serious and complex social issues into National Enquirer-type categories. He made his public appearance in the 1970s as a scholar uncovering the overlooked wisdom of Beni- to Mussolini. Ledeen once told his class at Washington University (St. Louis), \"Fascism can be fun.\" Whatever their background or claimed area of exper- tise, what immeditely made them stand out was their skill and compulsion at disinformation. Since 1976 the author has been following their every utterance with the reverence certain French intellectuals reserve for Jerry Lewis films. What we are expected to accept is that after a career of spreading disinformation, boasting of it and specializing in it, Ledeen, Sterling, and Moss have sud- denly reformed, are in touch with The Truth, and that Truth is that the KGB shot the Pope. Robert Moss went on ABC's Nightline and proceeded to connect one of the missing plotters in the\"Plot to Kill The Pope\" (an Arab terrorist) to the elusive \"hit team\" sent by Qaddafi in the \"Plot To Kill Reagan.\" The 12 CovertAction Number 18 (Winter 1983) Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 every intelligence outfit has huge sums to spend, loyalty is most reliably based on belief, and the best true believers in the CIA are Eastern European or Latin Catholics. Today the vanguard of this crusade is the Holy Mafia, the Opus Dei. Opus Dei Today There are no weekend activists in Opus Dei. It is a vocation, an all-absorbing passion. Opus Dei is today what the Jesuits were at the time of Ignatius de Loyola, and the Vatican was at the time of the Borgias. As an organization, Opus Dei, like the CIA, are kingmakers. They take obscure individuals and put them in key positions of power. Today Opus Dei controls 52 radio and TV stations, 38 news agencies, and 12 film companies. Opus Dei- controlled media in Spain include the newspaper ABC, the magazines Que Pasa and Arriba, and the news agency EFE. In addition to the major media outlets in Chile noted below, Opus Dei has some influence at Zig-Zag, the Gabriela Mistral Publishing Co., and Eva. This refers to clandestine control rather than such overt Opus Dei organs as the magazine Camino. At the Vatican, Opus Dei has replaced the Jesuits as the Pope's intellectual and diplomatic arm. They will probably soon take over the Vatican radio station. The Jesuits had an army of 26,600 and a history of Papal intrigue over a 442-year span, but lost out to a 54-year-old sect of whom not more than 1,000 are actual priests. The ideal Opus Dei recruit is a male, young, upper middle class, Latin (Spanish or Latin American), university educated, technocrat. Inductees are let in on the secret that they are being trained as a technocratic elite which will inherit the earth from ideologues. Possibly by coincidence this line becomes prominent in Opus Del theology at the same time that the CIA organized a Congress for Cultural Freedom in Milan, Italy, with papers presented that Daniel Bell compiled under the title: \"End of Ideology\". Now that they have finally achieved the official status of a religious order, this virus has probably passed the incubation stage and will spread openly. In Spain and Chile their penetration was covert, by establishing cells in the Departments of Law, Sociology, Economics, and Communications at the Catholic University in Santiago. \"The Plot to Kill the Pope \"Qaddafi Plot To Kill Reagan\" makes its first appear- ance in Robert Moss's fictional non-seller Death Beam. Qaddafi sends a Palestinian hit team headed by Carlos to Washington to assassinate Reagan. They set them- selves up across from the White House with a Soviet- made SAM-5 ground-to-air, heat-seeking missile. The plot is to hit Reagan's helicopter as it is coming in for a landing. Three months later all these details ap- pear, as news, in David Martin's articles in Newsweek. It is evident that the same Israeli intelligence agents who sought to create artificially a total break in U.S.-Libyan relations, planted the same disinformation on both Moss and Martin. The alleged evidence offered up by Moss to an incred- ulous Ted Koppel of a single hit team, or overlapping membership, involved arguing for a similarity in physi- cal appearance between a face in the crowd in St. Peter's Square (it is a big square) with one of the police compo- site drawings of the hit team allegedly sent against Reagan. This same technique of calculated ambiguity was used by Marvin Kalb in the September 21 NBC special, \"The Man Who Shot The Pope: A Study in Terror.\" But now a different face is plucked from the crowd and made to resemble an employee of the Bulgarian airline. An Ital- ian anti-terrorist officer of the CIA-controlled SID now comes to the U.S. to interview instant experts Kalb, Sterling, etc., returns to Italy and proceeds to seek the arrest of various hapless Bulgarians. The Bulgarian dummies being safely behind bars and deprived of the luxury of holding press conferences, Marvin Kalb flies to Rome and confesses all in their names. It is this same ventriloquist Kalb who managed to write an entire book on Kissinger without a single mention of his role vis-a- vis Chile, Allende, or the CIA. Kalb's September 21, 1982 TV special relied heavily on Claire Sterling's September Reader's Digest article, \"The Plot To Murder The Pope.\"This article is a practi- cal application of the principles for discovering KGB plots as first revealed in Claire Sterling's disinformation- ist Bible, The Terror Network. Herewith the Sterling rules for the correct interpretation of plots: 1. If the terrorist is overtly red, he is controlled by Moscow. 2. If the terrorist is overtly black (right wing), he is covertly red and controlled by Moscow. 3. If the weapon used is Soviet, prima. facie evidence exists of his control by Moscow. 4. If the weapon used is NATO issue, Sterling can trace it by serial number to an assault by Red Brigades on some NATO base. They are controlled by Moscow. 5. If all available evidence points to the opposite conclusion: that the blowing up of the train station in Bologna was right-wing or that Agca is a simple right- wing criminal, we must remember that red and black terrorists work together. The case for the KGB plot to kill the Pope is thus based on speculation by Claire Sterling, or on Moss and Ledeen quoting Sterling, just like Sterling, in The Terror Network, always cites Moss and Ledeen. Independent, concrete evidence is never forthcoming.

The prototype of an Opus Dei cell was the Consejo Superior de Investigacion Cientifica (CSIC), a think-tank which appeared in post Civil War Spain. CSIC had as its overt role the scientific study of and propaganda in favor of a Spanish State which was: Nationalistic, Syndicalist, Totalitarian, Unitary, Catholic. During the Spanish Civil War, the Opus Dei planning of CSIC was done while in refuge at the Chilean Embassy in Madrid. Possibly this may explain their early expansion in Chile. Opus Dei and Chile In Chile the locus of CIA/ Vatican collaboration shifted during the period 1963-1970 from the Christian Democratic Party to Opus Dei. Opus Dei had a think tank of free market economists and technocrats called the Institute of General Studies (IGS) which was taken over in 1971 by the CIA. This Opus Dei cell provided most of the civilian Cabinet and advisers to the Junta in the fields of law, economics, and media. In 1970, Nixon ordered a coup in Chile but didn't get it until 1)73 largely because the CIA couldn't find anyone to run th,- government in the event of success. Unlike other Latin American countries, the Chilean military had no recent history or experience in government. They, and the CIA, needed a team of professional economists, lawyers, business executives, and media experts who were willing and able to work with the military in administering a complex modern economy. Eventually a think tank of Opus Dei technocrats was pressed into service. Thus, having identified this IGS think tank as the appropriate counter-elite to replace the Socialists in late 1971, the U.S. Embassy sat on all 20 of its eggheads until they were ready to hatch in 1973. Once in power in Chile, the Opus Dei acted very much as they had in Spain-as the brains behind the throne. The IGS was first publicly identified in an article by this author in the February 19, 1979 Inquiry magazine. The members were shown to be former media executives at prominent Chilean publications such as El Mercurio, Que Pasa, and Portada. By happy coincidence these publica- tions had sent a large staff to Washington to cover the trial of Orlando Letelier's and Ronni Moffitt's assassins. Copies of the Inquiry article were provided to these journalists who rushed to phone their employers with the news they had just been identified as CIA agents in the American press. At this time, a power struggle had emerged in Chile between the civilian and military groups in the government-specifically between the secret police, the DINA, and the IGS technocrats. Under Carter, the CIA had been ordered to facilitate the return of civilian rule in Chile. In practice this did not mean a move toward democracy but rather an attempt to consolidate a group of CIA agents, the IGS, in power. Political observers were puzzled when a photo of Letelier's and Moffitt's killers first appeared in the IGS newspaper El Mercurio and in an article by Jeremiah O'Leary in the Washington Star. (O'Leary was identified in Carl Bernstein's October 20, 1977 Rolling Stone article as a long-time source of operational assistance to the CIA.) The Letelier-Moffitt assassination investigation was used by the IGS as a means of discrediting DINA and, indirectly, Pinochet. Various branches of the U.S. government under Carter, such as the Justice Department and FBI, also collaborated in this effort. The Opus Dei- and CIA- influenced media in Chile ran daily revelations of DINA complicity in the Letelier-Moffitt case. In this context, the political effect of the Inquiry article in Chile was to serve as ammunition to the military who claimed a plot was afoot to isolate and discredit them. The story surfaced as an Opus Dei plot \"to diminish the character of President Pinochet.\" The capo of the Holy Mafia, Hernan Cubillos, was fired as Foreign Minister. The editor of El Mercurio's afternoon tabloid received a letter bomb, while the president of El Mercurio was found dead. The plot surfaced in a banner headline in the May 13, 1980 Ercilla: \"El Opus Dei en Chile.\" All the individuals, organizations, and functions mentioned in the Inquiry article were listed, but as an Opus Dei plot. At this same time the Justice Department filed suit against several individuals at National Review for having acted as unregistered agents of the Pinochet regime in the United States. Court documents showed that at least six authors of \"Letter from Chile\" articles in National Review had received junkets courtesy of the Junta. What is really curious about these articles is they are not so much pro- Junta as \"puff pieces\" for the members of the IGS. Of a population of 10 million, the only Chilean civilians mentioned in National Review from 1974-1979 are the 20 members of IGS. Jeffrey Hart in \"A Chilean Spring?,\" March 1978, tells us what great guys Arturo Fontaine, Jaime Guzman, Claudio Orrego, Francisco Orrego and other IGS members are, finally focusing on IGS founder Pablo Baraona: \"Chile is an important sector of the front line in a colossal global military-political-ideological struggle that makes World War I look like an Indian raid. . . Probably the most interesting man in Chile today is Pablo Baraona, Minister of the Economy... Pinochet and the military intend to keep public order while Baraona pursues his economic policies with virtually a free hand. . . What the military regime is doing is providing a shield-critics say `machine guns in the street' behind which this process can go forward... In a sense, Baraona is what the argument over Chile is all about.\" The reaction of William Buckley to the exposure of his reporters as paid agents of the Junta, and of his Chilean contacts as CIA/ Opus Dei was histrionic even for Buckley. An entire issue (June 8, 1979) was devoted to an attack on Inquiry magazine and an attempt made to read the magazine's parent organization, the Libertarian Cato Institute, out of the Libertarian movement. The National Review cover was done up in the style of an old-fashioned handbill advertising a play, while each article inside is an act in which the character of succeeding Inquiry writers is assassinated by the inmates of National Review. Those interested in researching further the topic of CIA- media collaboration might look at the names of \"reporters\" who arrived in Chile the day before the 1973 coup. It was these same CIA media assets who were given advance warning and a ring-side seat to view the coup who later wrote that Allende killed himself. The Catholic Right and U.S. Foreign Policy The Catholic Right's influence on Reagan foreign policy 14 CovertAction Number 18 (Winter 1983) Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 is most evident in Latin America. William F. Buckley, Michael Novak, and Roger Fontaine's attacks on the priests in the Nicaraguan government sound more like a religious crusade than a political conflict. Other prominent members of the Catholic Right who have served important policy positions in the Reagan Administration are: James Buckley, Richard Allen, William Clark, General Vernon Walters, Alexander Haig, Claire Boothe Luce, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and William Casey. While these Catholics had independent, long-standing connections with the U.S. intelligence community, their collaboration was furthered by the Georgetown Center for Strategic and International Studies. This Center is the last outpost of Jesuit-CIA col- laboration and has led the demand for covert action against Nicaragua and Cuba. The religious tone which Reagan's crusade against communism has taken was expressed in a recent interview by Los Angeles Times correspondent Robert Scheer with U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle. Perle attributed the European anti-war feelings to a liberal Pro- testant angst and liberal Catholic loss of faith, which was contrasted to the more healthy and traditional \"Catholic South.\" Regardless of who is President, U.S. foreign policy is conducted more by the CIA than by the Department of State. The Covert Action branch of CIA is predominantly Catholic. The formal and informal foreign policy network in Washington which has the ear of the President happens currently to have a strong Catholic Right tinge. U.S. policy in Latin America traditionally is a collaborative effort with the Vatican due to the overwhelmingly Catholic composi- tion of the population. The current Pope is more conserva- tive than most and collaborates closely with Opus Dei, far right in its beliefs and tactics. The hostility focused on Nicaragua, especially its religious overtones, is a result of the overlapping or reinforcing influence of all of these 3 factions, a rightwing shift in all three centers of power: White House, CIA, and Vatican. How different U.S. policy toward Latin America can be under different circumstances is illustrated by taking the year 1962. With the populist Pope John XXIII and liberal President Kennedy, the CIA and the Vatican set out to co-opt rather than repress social unrest in Latin America. The principal instrument of this collaboration was Chris- tian Democratic parties. In order to build a popular base of support the Christian Democrats got involved in land re- form, voter registration, labor union organizing, etc. To accomplish the broadening of this base, it was necessary for the Catholic Christian Democrats to build bridges to Ma- sons, Radicals, and Marxists. The leaders in this ecumenical movement were the Jesuits, who were often the brains behind the Christian Democrats. Nowhere was this liberal spirit more evident than in Chile, which Kennedy explicitly chose to be his showcase of peaceful revolution, and as a contrast with Castro's Cuba. The Vatican and the CIA regarded Chile as a model for possible changes in Italy, an area of greater concern. In 1963 Kennedy gave Jesuit Roger Vekemans $10 million to establish an infrastructure for the Christian Dem- ocrats and facilitate the election of Eduardo Frei. Frei was a former Falangist redone in progressive garb in order to defeat the Marxist Allende in the 1964 elections. Not too surprisingly, Vekemans spread most of this $10 million, funneled through CIA and AID, to fellow Jesuits. The failure of this Christian Democratic coalition to prevent the election of Allende in 1970 is cited by the Catholic Right the world over as proof of the bankruptcy of the Kennedy soft line. In Chile Opus Dei has lost the Ministries of Foreign Relations and Economy, but still has enormous influence in the universities, media, and economic planning. In post-Franco Spain, Opus Dei has shifted to advising King Juan Carlos and filling the Chamber of Deputies, where it is credited with 71 of the 350 Deputies. In Socialist Spain, Opus Del can be expected to keep a low profile and confidently wait for the government to discredit itself by: making promises it cannot keep, being unable to control terrorism and/or separatist movements, and withdrawing from NATO. In the event of any future military or Right Wing solution, Opus Dei would be the logical choice for key administrative posts. The \"Plot to Kill the Pope\" The purpose of spreading the \"KGB plot to kill the Pope\" is to encourage the conservative and anti-Russian feelings of the Polish Pontiff and further his sense of vulnerability. Under these circumstances his only recourse is further dependency for security protection on the CIA- controlled Italian anti-terrorist squad (See CAIB Number 4.) During Pope John Paul II's recent visit to Spain, the Opus Dei-controlled EFE news agency put out the story of a Terrorist Plot To Assassinate The Pope upon his arrival at the town of Loyola, birthplace of the founder of the Jesuit order. There is a logical relationship between Opus Dei leaders in Rome whispering to the Pope that the Jesuits are secretly backing international terrorism and one of their media outlets stating as news that the Pope would be the victim of such a terrorist plot precisely in Loyola. (See sidebar for further details.) Divine Help? The author's Inquiry article identified among the leaders of the Opus Dei/ CIA institute in Chile as Alvaro Puga and Enrique Campos Menendez. Among the CIA-financed books that appear about the Allende period are Alvaro Puga's Diario De Vida de Ud., a collection of columns he wrote under a pseudonym from 1970-73. In the prologue, Enrique Campos Menendez points out that several columns appeared in print predicting key political assassinations, Allende's murder, and the date of the military coup, con- cluding: \"Nobody could have known of these future events, except through magic, parapsychology or divine premoni- tion.\" I think we can be forgiven for suspecting something more mundane than divine inspiration behind this Opus Dei agent's seemingly prophetic powers. I think it was something other than divine inspiration that led Robert Moss to have in his latest fictional book all the details of the \"Plot To Kill Reagan\" three months ahead of the news media. Claire Sterling has a vision of an International Terror Network run by the KGB, that may use Turkish terrorists, and 1o and behold; the Word Is Made Flesh in the Plot to Kill The Pope. Michael Ledeen may have had a divine inspiration to rush off to Rome the day before Pope John Paul I died, and the agency helping Opus Dei in its fight against the Jesuits may be divine, or maybe, just the Number 18 (Winter 1983) Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 CLA Uses Religion: The Ideological Sfruggle Within the Catholic Church in Nicaragua By Patricia Hynds* ToJay the efforts to destabilize Nicaragua are being carried out in many arenas: the economic, the political, the militz.ry--and in a very real and important way in the religious arena. In fact, many believe that at this time the ideological struggle is being waged most strenuously in the religious camp. With the measures enacted under the State of Emergency and with the control over money coming into the country, the room for maneuverability has been reduced in the political and economic spheres. But in Nica- ragua, where the people have a profound and active faith, religious sentiments and sensitivities make the churches easy prey for those who would manipulate them for the purpose of destabilization. The struggle, which is being presented as religious the Sandinistas against the Church---is more a struggle be- tween the Sandinistas and the opposition, the economic and political sectors that have lost power and are trying desperately to regain it. Politically, they have no large social base and so they must convert religion into a political base by convincing the people that their religious beliefs and traditions are being threatened. In presenting the picture of a religious conflict, a change in the attitude of the Nicaraguan hierarchy is often men- tioned. While it is true that during the final days of the insurrection and immediately after, the bishops did oppose Somoza, so did most of the private sector. As the private sector began to move away from the revolution, so did the hierarchy, encouraged to feel that the Government was moving against the Church. Thus the alignment of the Nicaraguan institutional church is where it has always been, with the private sector. The international human rights group, Pax Christi, in the conclusions of their report on Nicaragua published in October 1981, made this statement: \"The church of the political opposition seems to us to be almost exclusively linked to the party politics of the Christian Social party and to the Confederation of entrepreneurs (COS EP) headed by Alfonso Robelo. It also plays an important role in the American strategy aimed at destabilizing and overthrow- ing the revolution.\" In terms of the American strategy, since the Republican National Convention in 1980, the Reaganites and the \"new right\" have made their intentions very clear with regard to Nicaragua. The party platform spoke of the need to. reverse the Sandinista victory and immediately after Reagan as- sumed office, aid was cut off, wheat sales credits were terminated and the destabilization process was underway. As part of that process, the U.S. began to court conserva- tive sectors of the Catholic Church here and statements by the U.S. Embassy and official pronouncements by the hierarchy began to have a striking similarity. The Santa Fe Document, which was prepared for U.S. President Reagan by a team of ultra-conservative advisers before he took office, says, \"The United States must seize the ideological initiative . . . The war is for the minds of mankind. Ideo-politics will prevail ...\" And also, \"U.S. foreign policy must begin to counter (not react against) liberation theology as it is utilized in Latin America by the `liberation' clergy. The role of the church in Latin America is vital to the concept of political freedom.\" However, the committee's assessment of political freedom is only found in \"private property and productive capitalism.\"Any other concept is \"less Christian than Communist.\" In April of 1981, the Institute on Religion and Democ- racy was formed for the express purpose of combating the infiltration of communism in the church and combating the evils of liberation theology. The right-wing Heritage Foundation consistently presents a picture of the Sandinis- tas repressing religious freedom and attacking the church, especially in the person of the Archbishop of Managua, Miguel Obando y Bravo. The IRD invited the Archbishop to the U.S. to present him with a special award in early 1982. According to an article in the Panamanian magazine, Dialogo Social, of August 1982, \"The Reaganites' strategy tries to stop the advance of the religious groups most committed to the marginalized sectors of Latin America and to the anti-imperialists. For their plan, they have had to create another Jesus Christ. They cannot manipulate the historical Jesus for their own interests, but they have been able to distort his image . . . Thus we see that simple Christian people who have great social limitations, find the Number 18 (Winter 1983) Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 escape that had been planned by the divisionist missions and churches and pushed by the North American government.\" A Brief History Political manipulation of religion by the U.S. has a long history. A look at the past 20 years gives a clear picture of the use that the CIA has made of religion, its infiltration in the Latin American churches and its strategy for fostering dissent within the churches. After his visit to Latin America in 1969, Nelson Rocke- feller warned of the danger of the Medellin documents, which called for a preferential option for the poor, and he cautioned that the Latin American Church was vulnerable to \"subversive penetration.\" At that time, many U.S. mis- sionaries, both Protestant and Catholic, were willing CIA informants in the belief that they were doing their patriotic duty. In her well-documented book, Cry of the People, Penny Lernoux says, \"There is conclusive proof that the CIA used religious groups in Latin America for its own secret ends. At the same time it contributed to the persecu- tion and division of the Latin American Catholic Church by supporting right wing Catholic groups and financed and trained police agencies responsible for the imprisonment, torture and murder of priests, nuns and bishops, some of them U.S. citizens.\" There is convincing evidence of CIA penetration of both Protestant and Catholic missionary societies. CIA money, much of it funneled through church-related groups, amounted to $2.6 million for the successful presidential campaign of Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei in Chile in 1964. Jesuit Roger Vekemans, who operated the Centro Bellarmino in Santiago, received huge sums of money from the West German bishops in the early 60's as well as money from both AID and the CIA. The U.S. De Rance Founda- tion, which in 1976 was called \"the largest religiously oriented foundation\" in the U.S. by the Milwaukee Jour- nal, gave Vekemans $200,000 for his book against libera- tion theology. Vekemans is on the board of directors of the International Institute of the Heart of Jesus, which is the major recipient of De Rance funds. Vekemans currently lives in Bogota where he wields considerable influence within CELAM, the Latin American Episcopal Confer- ence. CELAM is outspokenly critical of the Nicaraguan government and exerts much influence over the Nicara- guan hierarchy. The CIA also financed Catholic organizations such as Fatherland and Liberty, a Chilean paramilitary organiza- tion which operated before and after the election of Al- lende. In Chile and other Latin American countries, the CIA helped finance the right-wing Tradition, Family and Property which played a role in the overthrow of both Allende in Chile and Goulart in Brazil. In many instances it pitted one sector of the church against another. In 1975 the CIA financed the Banzer Plan in Bolivia which had as its objectives: to sharpen internal divisions within the Church; to smear and harass progressive Bolivi- an Church leaders; and to arrest or expel foreign nuns and priests. Knowing this history, the Sandinista government looks with suspicion at incidents which could fit into the type of CIA schemes used in other countries. This suspicion com- bines with other factors to further complicate an already difficult situation. One of those factors is the admitted errors on the part of the government in the handling of some church-related incidents. In recent months, charges of Sandinista religious repres- sion have accelerated. The U.S. State Department accused the Sandinistas of trying to divide the Catholic Church and to foment the creation of a \"popular church\" (charges almost identical to those made by the Nicaraguan hier- archy). State Department official Elliot Abrams, in an article in the Washington Post on August 22, treats at great length what he calls examples of the Sandinistas' decision to tremendously increase the pressure against organized religion in Nicaragua. And church sources in the U.S. have confirmed that State Department officials have been call- ing U.S. bishops to urge them to speak out against the \"terrible repression of religion in Nicaragua.\" Recent Incidents It is important to look at some of the recent happenings involving the church in Nicaragua to understand the con- cern here about manipulation. Tensions within the Catho- lic Church and between the Catholic Church and the gov- ernment, which is more specifically between the govern- ment and the archdiocese of Managua, have resulted in a certain polarization of position on both sides. Nicaragua's revolution was the first to be fought with the active participation of large numbers of committed Chris- tians. The Catholic Church has, for the first time in history, the opportunity to participate in a positive way in the ongoing revolutionary and reconstruction process. How- ever, the history of the Catholic Church in Latin America, doubts and fears of the unknown, and individual mistakes on all sides have caused serious fissures in what could be a cooperative effort within Nicaragua. The problem of Santa Rosa. Monsignor Arias, pastor in the poor barrio of Santa Rosa for the past eight years, was removed as pastor of that parish and a newly ordained priest was named in his place. Although the Chancery Office terms the change \"routine,\" it was the latest in a series of transfers or removals of priests and nuns for what are considered by many to be political reasons. The people protested very strongly, but without success, to have the decision reversed. One evening during a prayer vigil in protest of the removal, Managua's Auxiliary Bish- op, Bosco Vivas, arrived to remove the tabernacle. This caused a strong reaction from the people and a scuffle ensued. During the scuffle, the locked tabernacle fell to the floor. The following day, the Archbishop placed the church under interdict, signifiying that no religious services could be held there, and issued a blanket excommunication of all who had participated in the incident, citing as reasons blasphemy of the Blessed Sacrament and attacking a bish- op, based on testimony from Bosco Vivas. People who were in the church have testified that at no time did anyone intentionally attack the bishop, although it was quite pos- sible that he was pushed around in the scuffle. People from the parish went to see the Papal Nuncio over the excom- munication but were told that he could not interfere in a diocesan matter. One Catholic priest with whom we spoke termed Bosco Vivas' actions \"imprudent.\" The priest said that if Bosco Vivas had not come to remove the tabernacle there would have been no problem, and no disrespect to the Blessed Sacrament, and that his refusal to discuss the situa- tion with the people gathered in the church had contributed to the incident.

A letter dated June 29 was sent to the bishops of Nicaragua from the Holy Father. On August 3, priests of the diocese were shown the letter and told that the government had prohibited its publication. The letter was published in the archdiocesan bulletin, distributed in many churches and read from the pulpit on August 8. On August 11, the Office of Communications Media published a communique giving as the reasons for the prior non-publi- cation the timing (at the time of the San Francisco del Norte massacre) and the possibility of manipulation. The communique called for all newspapers to publish the text of the Papal Letter in its entirety one time. The papal letter called for Church unity, spoke of the dangers of a \"popular church,\" and also spoke of the merits of service to one's country and to others. One priest said that pastorally, the letter had many merits, but that from a political context, it was another link in the chain of isolation and aggression toward Nicaragua. He attributed this negative aspect, the timing of the letter, both to the influence of CELAM and to the direct input that some of the Nicaraguan bishops made to the Pope recently, and which had no alternate voice. The Bismarck Carballo incident. On August 12, the morning papers published a short communique from the Office of Communications Media which prohibited publi- cation of anything related to the \"incident involving Fr. Carballo in Las Colinas.\" That day, Fr. Carballo, press secretary for the Archbishop and director of Radio Catoli- ca, gave a press conference to La Prensa and foreign jour- nalists in which he gave his version of the incident, and which then began to go out over the wire services. Accord- ing to Fr. Carballo, he was having lunch with one of his \"faithful\" when an armed man entered the house, forced him ar.d the woman to undress and then began to beat him, forcing him toward the open front door. The police entered the ho use, and dragged him outside, past a passing demon- stration, to a police jeep. He claimed he was taken to a police station, held for several hours and treated very disrespectfully. After that press conference, the government lifted the ban or coverage. TV news that night and the papers the following morning carried pictures of Fr. Carballo naked, and gave extensive coverage to the incident. According to the police version, the demonstration asking for more po- lice protection at various embassies to prevent criminals from seeking asylum was, by chance, passing near the house of the woman. Many embassies as well as the head- quarters of the Embassy Protection Unit of the police are located in the wealthy suburb. Shots were heard and upon approaching the house, the crowd saw a man later identi- fied as Fr. Carballo running out of the house, pursued by a man who was hitting him. The police, who were there with the demonstration, took them all away without realizing at the monent who the priest was, according to their reports. Continuing coverage by the pro-government paper pre- sented interviews with the woman indicating a lengthy romantic involvement with the priest. The priest and the Chancery Office have maintained that the incident was a government set-up to discredit the priest and destroy the church. La Prensa ran a picture of Fr. Carballo, supposedly taken \"minutes\" after the unfortunate incident with his shirt torn by his assailant when he was forced to undress. (This is in spite of Carballo's statement that he was held for a lengthy time without clothes.) However, pictures of Car- ballo being turned over to the Papal Nuncio by the police several hours after the incident show a shirt without tears. In an interview on August 14 in La Prensa, Fr. Carballo said, \"One must remember that there are concrete docu- ments that the police know about, in which the destruction of the Church has been programmed in the person of its priests who are faithful to the Catholic hierarchy.\" In the Pax Christi report on Nicaragua, an identical charge, made by Archbishop Obando y Bravo is cited. \"When asked for his objections against the FSLN rule, the Archbishop could mention little or no facts. But he did talk about the approaching Cubanization, about the plan to make Nicaragua a Marxist-Leninist state. He cited a cer- tain document as the most important argument for this plan. Opponents of the FSLN had mentioned this docu- ment several times to us, but nobody was able to procure this document for us.\" In an interview with a foreign journalist, Fr. Carballo was asked about the mysterious document. He referred to two, one written in China and another written by members of the Frente, but said that he did not have either document nor could he say where they might be found. Public reaction to the Fr. Carballo incident was very strong and united on at least one aspect of the incident and resulting coverage. Most people were scandalized at the publication of the pictures of a naked priest and outraged at what was often referred to as a \"mortal sin\" committed by the newspapers. The incident sparked a series of protests and actions in support of the priest in various Catholic schools. These demonstrations often led to confrontations between differ- ent groups. On August 14, Monsignor Obando y Bravo went to Monimbo, a barrio of Masaya, to celebrate Mass and participate in a procession celebrating the Assumption of Mary. According to witnesses in Masaya, an incident oc- curred when the MDN youth prevented a group from the Comunidades de Base from presenting a letter to the Bishop. It was not a serious incident nor an aggressive action toward the Bishop, although it was portrayed as such in coverage outside Nicaragua. On August 15, some students and some of the priests who staff the Salesian Catholic School decided to close the school in a 24-hour strike in support of Fr. Carballo. A day long series of incidents, rumors, etc., culminated in a pro- test demonstration against the closing of the school. Dur- ing that demonstration, shots were fired from the area of the school and two demonstrators were killed. As a result of all of that, the Salesian high school was temporarily closed and several of the priests, all foreigners, were taken to their respective embassies for their own protection, while the events were being investigated. One priest, the director of the school, was deported. He is said to have been outspoken in his oppositon to the Sandinista government and apparently on one occasion burned the FSLN flag at a parents meeting. After several days of meetings between the Minister of Education and representatives of the Salesians, as well as between government officials and the people of Monimbo, an agreement was reached. A new director was named, government intervention ended, and classes resumed. On Sunday, August 15, a confrontation broke out be- tween those attending a charismatic conference in a Catho- 18 CovertAction Number 18 (Winter 1983) Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 Approved For Release 2010/06/09: CIA-RDP90-00845R000100180004-4 lic school in Managua and a group of Sandinista youth. No one was hurt. Las Brisas. On August 19, after flyers were circulated around Managua advertising a Mass in support of Fr. Carballo at his parish in Las Brisas, flyers which accused the government of anti-religious actions, people objecting to that position, as well as students on their way home from neighboring schools, gathered in front of the church where Fr. Carballo was co-celebrating Mass with Archbishop Obando y Bravo. According to some of the people who were in front of the church, which is still under construc- tion, when the Mass was over, an exchange of slogans began between people inside the church and those outside. At one point, according to one observer, a rock was thrown by someone inside the church, cutting one spectator on the forehead. This intensified the feelings on both sides and a melee began. The police had formed a cordon through which Fr. Carballo and the Archbishop left without prob- lems. However as they were leaving more rocks were flying from both directions and one hit the rear window of the Archbishop's car, breaking it. The Security Police, led by Lenin Cerna, restored order. Several people from both groups were arrested. On August 24, after the incidents in Masaya, which again were primarily of a political nature, rather than a conflict between the government and the church, the Epis- copal Conference published an unsigned letter in which they denounced \"public defamation and insults toward some Catholic educational personnel and organisms;\" at least the passive complicity of some \"authorities of public order and of the Ministry of Education;\" the closing, \"which for us is a camouflaged confiscation.\" The entire contents of the letter clearly indicate a position that Catho- lic schools and Catholic education are under attack. This is after government officials and personnel from the Ministry of Education had made repeated public statements to the contrary and during the negotiations which ended with the school being returned to the Salesians. The Problems These incidents have sharpened the divisions within the Church, which have nothing to do with doctrine but much to do with the way in which the carrying out of the gospel message is perceived. This difference in perception has further separated the Managuan Archbishop from the gov- ernment and from significant sectors of the people. There are strong criticisms because the [Church] hier- archy has made no statements regarding the increasing border attacks nor have they decried the deaths of Nicara- guans such as occurred in San Francisco del Norte. This is particularly irritating in light of the strong, and never substantiated, denouncement of human rights violations toward the Miskitu Indians which the bishops published last spring. Fr. Carballo was asked on July 27 if the Chancery were going to make a statement regarding the San Francisco massacre and he replied, \"The Church can't be putting out a document every time that something happens.\" Daniel Ortega said in an interview, \"They (the bishops) go to Mass for Salazar, but when do they ever go to Mass for the militia who have been killed?\" (Salazar refers to Jorge Salazar, a private businessman killed in 1980 when appar- ently involved in gun-running.) A great increase in the charismatic movement in some ways parallels the pentecostal experience among non- Catholics. There is much emphasis on a spiritual approach to life, the importance of prayer and the exclusion of involvement in \"political activities\" which include any gov- ernment programs. This is seen as very negative by those sectors of the church that feel community activity is a necessary manifestation of faith. One priest said to us, \"To only praise God, to only ask that God save the country from communism and that he convert the comandantes, without acting in a way that will benefit the community is, to me, not only counterrevolutionary but also anti- Christian.\" Again citing the Pax Christi report, \"... the interwoven relations between the hierarchy and the political opposi- tion have been growing considerably. As a result, Archbi- shop Obando was given a more and more political role. In the opposition newspaper, La Prensa, he is almost daily played off against the FSLN. Although the bishops accuse the FSLN of `politically instrumentalizing' the christians, they themselves are, in no modest way, instrumentalized by the opposition. We even witnessed how the political oppo- sition hailed the Archbishop as a `prophet' and a'martyr.' Conservative church milieus and the political opposition constantly mentioned to us a `religious persecution.' . . . It seemed ridiculous to us to talk about `religious persecution.\"' The newly consecrated bishop of Matagalpa, Mons. Santi, said in his homily on the day of his consecration, \"Anyone who says there is no religious freedom in this country is a liar.\" It is worth asking, \"Why are the problems that exist between government and church only found to such a great extent in Managua'? According to Pax Christi, \"The whole issue of polarization is centered around this one question: being a Christian, should one support the revolution led by the FSLN or should one adopt a counter-revolutionary attitude'? This is however not an internal church discussion but a political one....\" The clergy certainly are drawn into the political arena. One of the reasons given for the strongly politicized clergy is: \"The traditional totalitarian thinking, leaving little room for pluralism (especially within the clerical hier- archy) and resulting in the fact that every criticism of a person or an aspect of clerical life is experienced as a criticism of the church or of christianity itself.\" In a recent interview "
