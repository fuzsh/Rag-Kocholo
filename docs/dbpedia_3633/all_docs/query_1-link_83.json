        "text": "Donald Sverchek Obituary\n\nPublished by Legacy Remembers on Aug. 4, 2024\n\n– Donald James Sverchek, of San Luis Obispo, passed away Friday, June 7, 2024. Don passed away peacefully in his sleep. He was a hardworking, longtime small business owner with a reputation for getting things done. Don loved a good joke and was quick with a pun. He was skilled at the BBQ and was always known to cook too much good food.\n\nDon was born in Santa Maria on August 30, 1946, to James Eustace Sverchek and Mary Munding Sverchek. He and his six siblings were all raised in a charming home on Buchon Street in San Luis Obispo. Don was the oldest boy in the family and was often considered a leader. He attended Old Mission School from elementary school through high school and was a proud Boy Scout with Troop 6, ultimately achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. Don’s sense of duty led him to join the Cal Poly Army ROTC program, where he excelled. Don also was a member of the Mustang football team, where he played tight end and defensive end. His exceptional performance on the field earned him a free-agent tryout with the 49ers. He would later pass this love of football on to his sons. He graduated from Cal Poly in 1969 with a degree in business and an officer’s commission in the Army.\n\nWhile at Cal Poly, Don met Susan Teter and they married on September 5, 1970. Don served in the Army for two years at Fort Lewis, Washington. He and Sue moved back to San Luis Obispo after his military service was complete. Together, they had three sons, Michael, Andrew, and Thomas. Don began selling and repairing windows at Contractors Glass Company, a business he would eventually buy and run with his youngest brother, Paul, and his oldest son, Michael, who continue to own and operate the company today.\n\nDespite his demanding job, Don always prioritized his three boys, supporting their interests and instilling a solid work ethic. His love for exercise kept him fit for travel, and his trips to Vietnam were not just vacations but opportunities to support the Montagnard people through a charity called Friends of the Central Highlands in Vietnam. He actively participated in fundraising events and advocated for their cause, traits that endeared him to many.\n\nIn 2017, Don began to face the challenges of dementia, a battle often referred to as the ‘long goodbye ‘. Yet, despite these difficulties, Don’s spirit remained unyielding. His memory may have faded, but his quick wit and sense of humor persisted, bringing joy to those around him. He moved to Ingleside Care Home in Atascadero, where his fun-loving attitude and jokes endeared him to the staff, a testament to his resilience and unwavering spirit that will forever be cherished.\n\nDon is survived by his three sons, Mike of San Luis Obispo, Andy (Colleen) of San Luis Obispo, and Tom (Kristin) of San Francisco; three sisters, Judy (Bill) of Tacoma, Lynn (Rick) of Seattle, and Gloria of Mill Valley; four brothers James (Michele) of Bakersfield, Bill of Santa Maria, and Paul (Eileen) of Arroyo Grande; and five grandchildren, Daphne, Jake, Dayton, Jacquelyn, and Beau. His ex-wife, Sue Sverchek, passed away on June 2, 2024, five days before Don’s passing.\n\nServices for Don will be held at 12 p.m. at Nativity of Our Lady in San Luis Obispo on Friday, Aug. 23. Instead of flowers, please donate to Nativity of Our Lady Catholic Church.\n\nThe Paso Robles Daily News accepts and publishes local obituaries and death notices free of charge from individuals and local funeral homes.
