        "text": "Number of Sunny Days\n\nIn the table below, the average number of Sunny Days for a city in California is the total days in a year when the sky is mostly clear. This includes the days when cloud covers up to 30% of the sky during daylight hours.\n\nPartly Sunny Days have cloud covering from 40% to 70% of the sky during the daytime.\n\nTotal Days With Sun is a sum of the Sunny plus Partly Sunny days. The rest of the days are mainly overcast, with at least 80% cloud cover. All the numbers are annual averages, made from years of weather watching.\n\nAnnual days of sunshine City Sunny\n\nDays Partly Sunny\n\nDays Total Days\n\nWith Sun Bakersfield 191 81 272 Bishop 201 89 290 Blue Canyon 174 64 238 Eureka 77 102 179 Fresno 194 73 267 Long Beach 159 119 278 Los Angeles Airport 147 116 263 Los Angeles Downtown 186 106 292 Mount Shasta 164 83 247 Redding 172 77 249 Sacramento 188 77 265 San Diego 146 117 263 San Francisco Airport 160 100 260 Santa Maria 176 110 286 Stockton 184 77 261\n\nAmount of Sun\n\nHere's another way to look at how much sunshine a city gets. The % Sun number measures the percentage of time between sunrise and sunset that sunshine reaches the ground. Again, these amounts are yearly averages based on many years of weather observations."
