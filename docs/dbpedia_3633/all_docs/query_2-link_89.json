        "text": "The wet period that resulted in multiple potent atmospheric river events that brought dangerous flooding, landslides and damaging winds to California in mid-late February is coming to an end. A break from the rain is expected in most areas late this week, before the next system approaches the region this weekend.\n\nEven though the heavy rain and mountain snow are tapering off in California, impacts will linger. Flooding may still occur as runoff brings water downstream. Some rivers may continue to swell.\n\nMud- and rockslides may still occur in areas with wet soil.\n\n(MORE: Atmospheric Rivers: A Blessing and a Curse)\n\nSan Francisco International Airport has received 16.38 inches of rain since Jan. 1, the fourth-highest combined January-February precipitation total on record there, according to Dr. Phil Klotzbach.\n\nThe average yearly rainfall in Oakland is 20.81 inches, and this city has now picked up 22.82 inches of rain since the rainy season began on Oct. 1.\n\nStorm Reports\n\nBelow is a recap of the recent storms to hit the region since late last week.\n\nFor more details on impacts from this storm, see the link below.\n\n(MORE: Latest California Storm News)\n\nFebruary 16\n\nThe first round of this latest Pacific storm parade soaked portions of California on Thursday as a band of moisture moved southward through the Golden State.\n\nUp to one-half inch of rain fell in much of the Bay Area. Parts of Marin and Napa Counties had picked up one-half to one inch of rain, while the wettest locations in Sonoma County had already exceeded one inch of rain. As of 4 p.m. PST Thursday, 0.37 inches of rain had fallen at San Francisco International Airport.\n\nThis first teaser rainfall event also brought rain to southern California. Much of the Santa Lucia Range received 0.20 to 0.40 inches of rain on Thursday. Lower elevations including Santa Barbara, Oxnard and Los Angeles received less than 0.05 inches.\n\nFebruary 17-18\n\nA strong atmospheric river event set up in southern California, dumping heavy rainfall on Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties.\n\nMultiple roads were closed in Santa Maria late Friday morning, due to flooding. Several reports of flash flooding, mudslides, urban flooding, and debris flows came in from Southern California. Nearly 9 inches of rain was dropped onto the mountains just north of Santa Barbara, while in downtown Los Angeles rainfall totals came up just short of their daily rainfall record.\n\nThe low may have also clinched the record for lowest pressure in the month of February at San Francisco Airport, a record that was last set in 1998.\n\nThese record low pressures caused winds to ramp up during the afternoon hours.\n\nWinds gusted across to over 50 mph across much of central and southern California, knocking over many trees and power lines. Some gusts exceeded 80 mph.\n\nSelected Wind Gusts as on Friday, all in California:\n\n108 mph was measured near Grapevine\n\n84 mph was recorded in Burns Canyon\n\n75 mph at Palomar Mountain Lookout\n\n72 mph in Hesperia and San Clemente\n\n67 mph in Laguna Beach\n\n65-75 mph in San Bernardino and San Diego counties (widespread)\n\nIn San Diego and Orange Counties, a squall line developed on Friday afternoon. Strong winds pushed over numerous trees. A wind gust was reported on the Long Beach Pier.\n\nRecord daily rainfall was reported across southern California. Long Beach, Santa Barbara, Sandberg, Santa Maria and Lancaster all received more rainfall than any other February 17th. Most sites doubled or tripled their old records. Death Valley recorded record rainfall on February 18th.\n\nSelected two-day rainfall totals in California:\n\nBolded values are locations where daily record rainfall occurred.\n\n10.45 inches in El Deseo\n\n9.95 inches at Old Man Mountain\n\n9.91 inches at San Marcos Pass\n\n9.87 inches at Upper Matilija Canyon\n\n9.30 inches in Montecito Hills\n\n7.68 inches at Red Mountain\n\n7.02 inches in Los Prietos\n\n6.57 inches in Westlake Village\n\n6.22 inches in Opids Camp\n\n5.50 inches at Crestline Ridge\n\n4.84 inches at Malibu Canyon\n\n4.84 inches in Canoga Park\n\n4.52 inches in Oxnard\n\n4.16 inches at Santa Barbara\n\n3.98 inches in Rocky Butte\n\n3.92 inches in Black Mountain\n\n3.86 inches in Sandberg\n\n2.94 inches in Laguna Hills\n\n2.91 inches in Cambria\n\n2.77 inches in Long Beach\n\n2.74 inches in Pasadena\n\n2.05 inches in Downtown Los Angeles\n\n1.98 inches at Santa Maria Airport\n\n1.12 inches at San Diego International Airport\n\n1.05 inches in Downtown San Francisco\n\n1.16 inches in Oakland\n\n0.73 inches in Fresno\n\n0.65 inches in Death Valley\n\nAll this rainfall in a relatively short period of time, allowed rivers and washed to fill up rapidly. The Ventura River has reported some local flooding and the Conejo Creek in Camarillo was seen water spill over into farmland.\n\nThe Pacific Coast Highway east of Santa Barbara was closed at times on Friday afternoon due to mudslides and flooding. Interstate 110 was also closed near Slauson, California on Friday evening.\n\nThe Santa Barbara Airport also closed due to flooding on runways Friday evening into Saturday morning.\n\nNumerous swift water rescues were performed across Southern California.\n\nIn the Sierras, Ponderosa received 24 inches and Mt Baldy Ski Resort saw 20-24 inches of new snow in 48 hours ending Saturday morning and Squaw Valley received 12 inches in 24 hours ending Saturday morning. New snow at Alpine Meadows put them over 500\" for the winter.\n\nFebruary 20-21\n\nA 77-mph wind gust was measured early Monday evening in Los Gatos, California, a suburb of San Jose. A gust of 81 mph was also observed south-southwest of Dos Palos.\n\nAlpine Meadows ski resort measured a wind gust of an incredible 199 mph Monday night. Due to the high winds, a power outage and avalanche danger, Alpine Meadows was closed Tuesday.\n\nAdditionally, up to 42 inches of new snow have been measured at Heavenly ski resort in the Sierra Nevada in the 24 hours ending Tuesday morning.\n\nMore than 5 inches of rain have fallen in the 48 hours ending at 9 a.m. PST Tuesday in portions of Plumas, Shasta and Yuba counties in northern California. Bucks Lake in Plumas County picked up more than 6 inches of rain in that time period. Some western-slope areas of the northern Sierra have seen 3 to 5 inches of rain, so far.\n\nOver two dozen debris flows have been reported, so far, in parts of Sonoma, Santa Clara, Monterey, Santa Cruz, Marin, San Mateo, Alameda, Fresno and San Benito counties. Road flooding has also been observed on over three dozen roads in this general region, and there was possible damage to a bridge just north of Hollister.\n\nA Record Wet Season?\n\nA persistently wet pattern earlier this season was hailed as one that could finally put a sizable dent in California's multi-year drought, though deep groundwater supply still needs to be replenished.\n\nNow, it has gone too far and may shatter all-time records in the state.\n\nSince Oct. 1, it's been by far the wettest \"water year-to-date\" in California's northern Sierra, according to data from the California Department of Water Resources.\n\nThe same can be said in the central Sierra, and the southern Sierra is also close to its record pace. California's \"water year\" runs from October through September, in order to encompass one entire wet season, peaking from November through March.\n\nNorthern Sierra precipitation has been more than double the average in the 2016-17 wet season, and, more impressively, it's at least 20 inches ahead of the pace of the two previous record wet seasons, 1997-98 and 1982-83.\n\nBoth of those standing record wet seasons were during strong El Niños, but 2016-17 featured a weak La Niña, which just recently dissipated.\n\nDuring the record-tying strong El Niño in 2015-16, the northern Sierra picked up 10 fewer inches of precipitation through the entire water year than they've picked up just through Sunday this water year.\n\n(MORE: El Niño Myths)\n\nThe six-month period ending Feb. 12 was the wettest such period on record in Sacramento (24.49 inches) and Pocatello, Idaho (12.81 inches), according to the Southeast Regional Climate Center.\n\nExamining statewide data, it has been the second-wettest October-through-February period on record dating to the late 19th century, according to Paul Iñiguez, science and operations officer at the National Weather Service in Phoenix.\n\nReservoir Impact\n\nShasta Lake, San Luis Reservoir, Don Pedro Reservoir, Lake McClure and Castaic Lake are all at least 90 percent of capacity, as of Saturday – well above the historical average for this time of year.\n\nOn Feb. 16, Lake Oroville fell below 90 percent capacity for the first time since the Oroville Emergency Spillway became endangered.\n\nSome of these reservoirs will surely rise again early this week with incoming rainfall.\n\n(MORE: California Reservoir Status)\n\nIn the Sierra, this is in large part due to a pair of atmospheric river events – one in early February, and a wetter event in early January – that produced rain over higher elevations, rather than snow.\n\nThis rain-on-snow in early February lead to marked inflows of water both from precipitation and melting of the impressive snowpack from feet of heavy snow since January. If that wasn't enough, the water content left in the Sierra snowpack also remains well above the mid-February average.\n\n(IMAGES: How Northern California Went From Parched to Flooded in a Few Months)\n\nTherefore, it's not just a heavy rain and snow event that is of concern. Any rapid warmup over the next month or so could unleash rapid snowmelt, putting stress on nearly full reservoirs.\n\nIt seems almost inconceivable the state had its driest year on record just four years ago."
