        "text": "The St. Marys Quarry is opening for the 2024 season from Friday, June 28 to Monday, September 2.\n\nTime: Open daily from 11:00 am to 7:30 pm\n\nPlease note: The Quarry will not open until 1:00 pm on Friday, August 2 and Saturday, August 3 to accommodate the Ontario Summer Games Triathlon.\n\nPlease note: The Super Splash Waterpark is not included with general Quarry admission, nor is general admission included with a Super Splash Waterpark pass. Please visit the Super Splash Waterpark website for pricing and details about how to pay for a Super Splash pass in person or online.\n\nPerfect for a group or family outing, this floating playground features obstacles like the 14ft tall Ice Tower, which will challenge you with free climbing, and the Action Tower, which is 12ft tall, and acts like a giant slide.\n\nFor more details and to purchase passes to the Super Splash Waterpark, please visit supersplashstmarys.ca.\n\nChild is a non-swimmer or cannot complete swim test:\n\nChildren must be accompanied by a parent or guardian who is at least 12 years of age and responsible for their direct supervision, with a maximum of 4 children per parent/guardian with lifejackets on.\n\nParent/guardian must be in bathing attire and within arm's reach of the child(ren) at all times in and out of the water.\n\nChildren aged 8-11 that do not pass the swim test will be given a blue band for access to the trampoline. Parent/guardian must be close by the trampoline watching their children.\n\nChild can complete swim test:\n\nAdmitted unaccompanied.\n\nInformation courtesy of Upper Thames River Conservation Authority (UTRCA):\n\nThe water in the quarry originates from groundwater discharging from fractures or cracks in the bedrock, and from precipitation. Groundwater is always cold, staying within a few degrees of 10˚ Celsius, year round. As a result, the water in the quarry is cool during the swimming season and relatively warmer in the winter.\n\nGroundwater levels are also fairly constant, varying only about 1 metre over the course of a year. Groundwater is at its highest in the winter/early spring, and relatively stable throughout the summer. During hot summers, water levels in the quarry may drop slightly due to increased evaporation and surface water temperatures may be warmer.\n\nInformation courtesy of Upper Thames River Conservation Authority (UTRCA):\n\nThe main fish species found in the quarry are Common Carp, Pumpkinseed and Rock Bass. The fish are able to migrate between the west quarry fishing hole across the street and the quarry through the underwater tunnel connecting the two. In an open watercourse, species like Common Carp and Pumpkinseed would move to warmer portions of that waterbody. However, they are still able to survive in the colder water temperatures found in the Quarry.\n\nCommon Carp\n\nThe Common Carp is a large, deep-bodied fish, varying in colour from silver to olive-green, brass or grey on the back and sides. It has whisker-like appendages called barbels near the corners of its mouth. Native to Asia, carp were introduced to North America from non-native populations in Europe. Common Carp adapt to a variety of conditions, tolerating all types of bottoms and water clarity ranging from clear to murky.\n\nPumpkinseed\n\nThe Pumpkinseed is a very deep-bodied, laterally compressed, almost disk-like fish. The fish’s breast and belly are orange to red-orange, and its back and sides are brown to olive. Its sides and back are speckled with orange, yellow, blue, and emerald spots. Pumpkinseeds can be found in large schools and often make up the largest portion of the fish population in small, warm bodies of water. Part of the sunfish family, the Pumpkinseed is native to eastern North America.\n\nRock Bass\n\nThe Rock Bass is a small and very deep-bodied fish. Its back and upper sides are brown to olive with golden tints, and often with dark saddles. It has a large red eye and its mouth is large and extends backwards to below the middle of the eye. The Rock Bass is part of the sunfish family and can be found swimming with other sunfish and bass. It is a cool-water fish native to Ontario."
