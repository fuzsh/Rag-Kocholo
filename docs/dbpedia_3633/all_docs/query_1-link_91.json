        "text": "Severe weather near Busby, Alta, caused a structural collapse at the Westlock Meditation Center Wednesday evening, causing several injuries and at least one death, according to a series of social media posts by [RCMP Alberta](https://x.com/RCMPAlberta/status/1818887509079712117).\n\nPeople had started gathering in the area ahead of an 11-day meditation session that draws crowds from around the world, according to local media. The event was supposed to start on August 1.\n\n\"There were many, many people injured,\" Cpl. Troy Savinkoff Public Information Officer for Alberta RCMP Media Group told reporters.\n\n\"Many with just minor bruises, more than 50 had minor injuries, but there were several that received serious injuries. I don't have the exact numbers yet. People were taken to hospitals with EMS and some in personal vehicles. Several people have serious injuries.\"\n\nAn estimated 200 people were in the tent at the time of the collapse.\n\nDangerous storms in the area\n\nWhile the exact cause of the collapse remains under investigation, there were strong winds in the area at the time of the incident.\n\n\"Storms developed along a cold front Wednesday afternoon northwest of Edmonton,\" says Weather Network meteorologist Matt Grinter.\n\n\"As the storms tracked east, they became stronger, causing severe thunderstorm warnings to be issued by Environment Canada. At 4:59 p.m., a severe thunderstorm warning was issued for Westlock County, including Busby. The storms were moving at 90-100 kilometres per hour, which caused strong wind gusts as the storm hit just before 5:30 p.m.\"\n\nSatellite image captures storm over the region on July 31 (The Weather Network)."
