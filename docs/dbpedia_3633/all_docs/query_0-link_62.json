        "text": "2.0 Where are the meets?\n\nMost of our meets are in a variety of coastal locations including: Simi Valley, Ventura, Oxnard, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Long Beach and here in Santa Clarita.\n\n2.1 What are the parent’s responsibilities at a meet?\n\nEach team is assigned a certain number of timing chairs based upon the number of swimmers their team has entered in the meet. It is expected that every family provide a timer for at least one hour of the meet. A sign-up sheet is always posted on-line week prior to the meet. Please sign up for at least one-hour stint. Timing is actually rather fun and gives you a front row view of the pool. Depending on the pool, your responsibilities will range from pressing a button, to using a stopwatch, to writing the swimmer’s time on a sheet. It’s easy and possibly the most helpful thing you can do for your team on race day and provide a great meet experience for all athletes.\n\n2.2 What should my child wear?\n\nVisible Canyons team clothing needs to be worn at all meets. The team has periodic sales of clothing. In addition, team suits, backpacks and parkas can be ordered from Conejo Swimworks all year long. For order information please see someone in the office. Remember to bring several towels to every meet.\n\n2.3 How do I check in at a meet?\n\nFirst, be sure to arrive early. Your child needs to locate his/her coach and begin warm-ups on time. Coaches will email out arrival time prior to the meet and/or post it on the website. Usually the coach budgets some time for check-in. A check-in table will be somewhere near the pool. Your child (not you) MUST check in. They will be told their event numbers and marked as present and accounted for. It’s not a bad idea for your child to write his/her event numbers on their arm. Not checking in can mean not swimming events.\n\nOnce a swimmer has checked-in they are committed to swim. If your child does not show up at an event, he/she or the team can be penalized. If you must leave or your child gets ill after you've checked in, return to the administration desk and “scratch” your child. If the event is about to happen, have your child speak to their coach immediately and receive direction from the meet officials as far as how to proceed.\n\n2.4 How do I find out my heat and lane assignment?\n\nWhen you arrive at a meet there will be a wall of information usually broken down by boy and girls. Here you will see a sheet (psych sheets) for each event. Locate your child’s events and make sure they are listed. If they are not or they are listed wrong, go to your coach. If they are listed correct, do nothing.\n\nA few events before your child is to swim, a new sheet will go up on top of the psyche sheet. This sheet will have heat and lane assignments and will tell you what heat and lane your child will swim.\n\nAt this time he/she should report to the coaching staff and inform them of the heat and lane. The coaches will give them some last minute advice and send them off.\n\n2.5 How does my child get to his/her event?\n\nThe coaches are very busy timing and prepping swimmers for their events and therefore cannot get your child to the starting blocks. We do promote that parents keep an eye on the pool and watch what events are in the water as well as the current heat. But we also promote parents sending your swimmers to the blocks alone and teach them to learn this process at a very early age. Swimmers usually need to be around the blocks or in the warm up pool at least one event (not heat) prior to theirs. It is best to have them check in with the timers of their lane to be sure they’re in the right place at the right time. Teaching your swimmer how to get to his/her event on their own is an important part of the process of developing our athletes. Swimmers may miss an event as part of this process. We see that as a learning experience and something all swimmers do at some point. It's learning from that experience that the coach will encourage at our early levels.\n\n2.6 What do we do after a race?\n\nImmediately after your child’s race, after you hug him or her and tell them something positive, send them off to the coaches who will review their time and discuss the race. Warm down will happen as well following the race either before or after talking to the coach. If that was their last race of the day and there are no relays planned, they are free to go unless otherwise instructed by your coach.\n\n2.7 When does my child get his/her awards?\n\nRibbons and medals are usually placed in your child’s in the week after the meet.\n\n2.8 The meet is outdoors and it looks like rain\n\nRain does not stop a swim meet since it does not impede the swimmer’s performance. The only exception to that would be an electrical storm. Any meet cancelation would be announced on our website as well as email as soon as a decision was made. If no message on our website or email from a coach, head to the meet.\n\n2.9 Where do we sit at a swim meet? You are allowed to sit anywhere you like that is not roped off. Bring a canopy to stay out of the sun and folding chairs are a must. Tarps, heaters, blankets, sleeping bags are all advisable in cold weather. Some meets we have official team areas for swimmers only but not always."
