        "meta_description": "Abstract Changes to mean and extreme wet season precipitation over California on interannual time scales are analyzed using twenty-first-century precipitation data from 34 global climate models. Models disagree on the sign of projected changes in mean precipitation, although in most models the change is very small compared to historical and simulated levels of interannual variability. For the 2020/21–2059/60 period, there is no projected increase in the frequency of extremely dry wet seasons in the ensemble mean. Wet extremes are found to increase to around 2 times the historical frequency, which is statistically significant at the 95% level. Stronger signals emerge in the 2060/61–2099/2100 period. Across all models, extremely dry wet seasons are roughly 1.5 to 2 times more common, and wet extremes generally triple in their historical frequency (statistically significant). Large increases in precipitation variability in most models account for the modest increases to dry extremes. Increases in the frequency of wet extremes can be ascribed to equal contributions from increased variability and increases to the mean. These increases in the frequency of interannual precipitation extremes will create severe water management problems in a region where coping with large interannual variability in precipitation is already a challenge. Evidence from models and observations is examined to understand the causes of the low precipitation associated with the 2013/14 drought in California. These lines of evidence all strongly indicate that the low 2013/14 wet season precipitation total can be very likely attributed to natural variability, in spite of the projected future changes in extremes.",

        "text": "a. GCM precipitation trends under climate change\n\nHere we examine twentieth- and twenty-first-century GCM simulations of California precipitation using the historical (1900/01–2004/05) and RCP8.5 (2005/06–2099/2100) experiments. RCP8.5 is the most extreme forcing scenario in the CMIP5 framework and therefore the one most likely to be associated with statistically significant anthropogenic trends. This may also represent the most realistic scenario since current emissions already exceed those represented in RCP8.5 (Peters et al. 2013). A total of 34 GCMs are included in the analysis, allowing us to robustly characterize intermodel spread and compute the ensemble-mean outcome. Shown in Fig. 2 are each GCM’s wet season accumulations from 1900/01–2099/2100 in thin gray lines, along with the ensemble mean in a thick black line. Also shown is the observed time series from 1900/01–2013/14 in green. As seen in the figure, California’s observed precipitation is extremely variable on interannual time scales (Dettinger 2011). In fact, the observed distribution is notably non-Gaussian with a heavy wet tail, and less than half of the wet seasons are within 25% of the median. From 1900/01 to 2013/14, the average wet season accumulation is 62.2 cm, with a standard deviation of 20.6 cm. Generally speaking, simulated California precipitation is also highly variable. The average of each model’s 1900/01–2013/14 standard deviation is 18.1 cm. As a group, the models appear to have a slightly low bias (12%) in precipitation variability. Langford et al. (2014) also found that CMIP5 GCMs simulate the average and standard deviation of historical precipitation over California fairly accurately.\n\nLooking at the 2005/06–2099/2100 trends (blue and red lines in Fig. 2), we see that GCMs disagree on the sign of projected changes in precipitation, as 21 models show positive trends and 13 show negative trends. This disagreement was found in other recent studies (e.g., Das et al. 2013; Neelin et al. 2013; Berg et al. 2015) and can be interpreted within the framework of the “rich get richer” or “wet regions get wetter and dry regions drier” effect (Chou and Neelin 2004; Held and Soden 2006; Trenberth 2011; Durack et al. 2012). Specifically, California is located at the node of oppositely signed large scale precipitation changes (van Oldenborgh et al. 2014), whereby northern mid- and high-latitude regions are projected to become wetter, whereas southern subtropical areas are projected to become drier. GCM projections of precipitation over California tend to disagree on the sign of change, depending on whether they place the region more in the northern or southern regime of large-scale change.\n\nRegardless of sign, the projected precipitation trends throughout the twenty-first century are generally insignificant. The average positive and negative trend is +1.04 and −0.75 cm decade−1, respectively, while the ensemble-mean is +0.35 cm decade−1. These trends are very small compared to both simulated and observed interannual standard deviations of 18.1 and 20.6 cm per wet season, respectively. Only the most extreme cases (+2.68 and −1.84 cm decade−1) could lead to a significant shift in hydroclimate when the variability is taken into account. Taken as a whole, Fig. 2 provides little evidence from the GCMs that wet season totals will greatly change throughout the twenty-first century, even under a very aggressive warming scenario. The most likely case is that the region’s very large variability will continue to dominate any long-term trends due to anthropogenic forcing.\n\nb. Extreme precipitation changes in the twenty-first century\n\nDespite the small projected mean precipitation trends in Fig. 2, large changes in extremes may still occur (e.g., Das et al. 2013; Polade et al. 2014). To quantify how the frequency of wet seasons with extreme wetness and dryness may change throughout the twenty-first century, we examine extreme wet season totals within each GCM. The thresholds for extreme events are defined according to detrended simulated historical (1900/01–2004/05) precipitation distributions. An extreme wet event is one where the wet season total exceeds the 95th percentile in the model’s own historical period climatology, while an extreme dry event is one where the wet season total is less than the 5th percentile. The results of this exercise are nearly identical if one instead estimates natural variability levels using preindustrial simulations within the subset of GCMs that show minimal model drift (not shown). Results are also nearly identical if one instead examines extreme changes using water year totals (October through September), rather than wet season totals (not surprising since most precipitation falls during the wet season months). Based on our definition of extremes, we expect one wet season to be extremely dry and one to be extremely wet by chance about every two decades. Bearing this level of natural variability in mind, we examine changes to extremes in the twenty-first century in Fig. 3 and Table 2.\n\nFigures 3a and 3b show the number of wet seasons that are extremely dry and wet, respectively, within a given two-decade interval in the twenty-first century for 34 GCMs. (The color scheme of Fig. 3 is chosen so that any box with shading in it represents a number of extreme events greater than the one event expected by chance.) Models are roughly ordered wettest to driest from top to bottom based on their twenty-first-century climatology of extremes. Specifically, we calculate the difference between each model’s total number of twenty-first-century wet and dry extremes shown in Fig. 3. The model with the largest difference, GISS-E2-H, is ranked the wettest model, while MIROC-ESM-CHEM has the smallest difference and is ranked as the driest model. For discussion purposes, it is useful to divide the latter eight decades of the twenty-first century into two periods, 2020/21–2059/60 (mid-twenty-first century) and 2060/61–2099/2100 (end of twenty-first century). Testing of statistical significance on the number of extremes in each of these periods is performed with a Monte Carlo resampling technique. For each GCM, 40 wet seasons (matching the length of each future period) are randomly selected from its detrended historical (1900/01–2004/05) time series and the numbers of dry and wet extremes within that synthetic time series are recorded. This is repeated 1000 times to produce two distributions showing the expected number of dry and wet extremes within a 40-yr historical slice. We then extract the percentiles of these distributions corresponding to the numbers of mid- and end-of-twenty-first-century dry and wet extremes (i.e., boxes in Fig. 3). If a percentile is greater than the 95th historical percentile, a significant (p < 0.05) increase in extremes is said to occur. The results of this exercise for all 34 GCMs are shown in Table 2.\n\nFocusing on the mid-twenty-first century in Table 2, only 2 out of 34 models project statistically significant increases in wet seasons that are extremely dry (average of 10 during these 40 years). Across the model ensemble, the average and median occurrence of extremely dry wet seasons is found to be 2.2 and 2.0, respectively. Since the region would experience around two extremely dry wet seasons during four decades by chance, this information indicates that the frequency of extremely dry wet seasons is unlikely to change between 2020/21 and 2059/60. On the other hand, 16 out of 34 models have statistically significant projections of more than two wet seasons that are extremely wet during this time period (Fig. 3b; Table 2), with an average of 6.8 per 40 years. The ensemble-mean average and median occurrence is 4.2 and 4.0, respectively. Thus nearly 50% of models significantly project a tripling of the frequency of wet extremes by the mid-twenty-first century. However, the ensemble mean suggests an increase of only two additional wet extremes, which is statistically significant at the 95% level.\n\nExtreme changes become more pronounced and better model agreement is found when analyzing the 2060/61–2099/2100 period. For instance, 10 out of 34 models have statistically significant projections of more than two extremely dry wet seasons during this 40-yr period (Fig. 3a; Table 2). When averaged across these models, a mean occurrence of dry extremes during these four decades is found to be 8.4. Across all models in the ensemble, the average and median occurrence are found to be 3.6 and 3.0, respectively (see also middle column of Table 3). While over one-quarter of the models project a significant increase in the frequency of dry extremes 4 times greater than the historical levels, the ensemble mean projects an additional one or two more extremely dry wet seasons per two decades by the end of the twenty-first century (not statistically significant at the 95% level). This effect is also visually apparent in the increasing redness of the boxes in Fig. 3a. A majority of the models (19 out of 34) project statistically significant increased occurrences of wet seasons that are extremely wet during 2060/61–2099/2100. The average occurrence of extremely wet years across models with significant increases for this period is 9.5 or roughly 4–5 times the expected frequency. The ensemble-mean average and median occurrence is 6.4 and 5.5, respectively (middle column of Table 3), indicating a statistically significant tripling of the frequency of wet extremes compared to the historical frequency by the end of the twenty-first century.\n\nInterestingly, only three models overlap [CESM1(CAM5), CMCC-CESM, and EC-EARTH] within the 10 out of 34 and 19 out of 34 model subsets that project significant increases in dry and wet extremes, respectively, by the end of the century (Table 2). While models generally project increases in either wet or dry extremes, some models appear to project increases in both. Multiple scenarios could help explain this model behavior. Of course, changes in mean precipitation without any change in variability would by itself produce an increase in extremes by simply shifting the distribution in one direction and fattening that direction’s tail. This may explain the increases in either wet or dry extremes in a particular model. However, the increases in both wet and dry extremes in some models indicate changes in variability that amplify extremes in one tail may also be at work.\n\nTo unravel the influences of mean and standard deviation changes to extreme changes, we first show each GCM’s twenty-first- minus twentieth-century mean and standard deviation change in Fig. 4. The mean change is fairly skewed toward moistening (19 positive and 15 negative), an expected result given the information shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, a great majority of models (28 out of 34) show positive changes in the variability of wet season totals during the twenty-first century. Some models that project statistically significant increases in wet extremes [e.g., GISS-E2-H, MRI-CGCM3, and BCC_CSM1.1(m)] are accompanied by large positive changes in both the mean and standard deviation. On the other hand, there are several other models that also project significantly increased wet extremes [e.g., CanESM2, and CESM1(BGC)] but are associated with negative mean changes and positive standard deviation changes. Similar nonuniform behavior is seen in the subset of models that project significant increases to dry extremes by the end of the century. One model associated with significant increases in dry extremes during this period (MIROC5) is accompanied by large decreases to the mean and standard deviation. Other models that project increased dry extremes, such as GFDL-ESM2G, show decreases in the mean but increased variability. So both changes in the mean and changes in variability may conspire to produce an increase in extremes in many models.\n\nTable 3 separates out these two effects by comparing how extremes change during 2060/61–2099/2100 with and without an accompanying mean change in that time period. In the center column of Table 3, numbers of extreme wet seasons for the 2060/61–2099/2100 period are shown including the mean precipitation change. In the right column, each GCM’s end-of-twenty-first-century (2060/61–2099/2100) mean is reset to equal the corresponding mean for the historical period (1900/01–2004/05). This is accomplished by adding the difference between historical and end-of-twenty-first-century means to each wet season total during 2060/61–2099/2100. In essence, this compares how many extreme wet seasons occur when both the simulated mean and variability are allowed to change (center column) and when only variability changes (right column). Table 3 shows that the increase in precipitation extremes occurs even when the mean change is removed. Wet seasons with extreme wetness only decrease from around 6 to 4 per 40 years, while the frequency of extremely dry wet seasons is approximately unchanged. A decrease in wet extremes when removing the mean change is consistent with the moderate moistening tendency in the majority of the GCMs (Fig. 2). Removing the mean change effectively “dries” the 2060/61–2099/2100 precipitation time series for most models, and reduces the number of extremes in the wet tail. In sum, Fig. 4 and Table 3 reveal that, as a group, 1) half of the simulated increase in wet extremes can be attributed to increased variability, while the other half is due to increases in the mean, and 2) increased dry extremes are almost entirely due to increased variability."
