The skies become clearer in the spring, but prepare for overcast skies around 20% of the time. Humidity is also low during the spring. Expect high temperatures in the 60s and 70s with lows in the 40s to 50s. Spring is a great time to get outdoors and explore hiking in the region.\n\nSummer\n\nSummer is one of the most popular times to visit the Central Coast.

October offers highs in the 60s and lows in the 50s, and November is a bit cooler with highs in the 60s and lows in the 40s.
