        "text": "The 30th Tokyo International Film Festival (TIFF) runs from October 25th – November 03rd in Roppongi and it’s the best event to see films with English subtitles in Japan at this time of the year since nearly all will have them and there will also be English interpretation at Q&A sessions with filmmakers. Another great thing about the festival is that it nearly all takes place in one location which means that getting to venues is easy.\n\nThere are a heck of a lot of films programmed and just as many events and it looks as if there are over 300 things for people to attend. Tickets are sold-out or selling-out fast but I wanted to cover this because it has an exciting line-up and Japanese indie cinema and the shorts looks strong. Heck, Japanese cinema in general looks to be in rude health.\n\nThere is a lot to get through and it will be difficult for anyone not using a computer with a decent internet connection to view this (apologies) but I wanted to do this in one post because it is impressive. Accuse me of maximalism if you want but I hope people find something to enjoy thanks to reading this. Click on a title to be taken to the festival page. Here’s what’s on offer.\n\nThe opening film is Fumihiko Sori’s Fullmetal Alchemist, which anime and manga fans have been eagerly awaiting for quite some time.\n\nFullmetal Alchemist\n\n鋼の錬金術師 「Hagane no Renkinjutsushi」\n\nRunning Time: 133 mins.\n\nRelease Date: December 01st, 2017\n\nDirector: Fumihiko Sori\n\nWriter:Fumihiko Sori, Takeshi Miyamoto (Screenplay), Hiromu Arakawa (Original Manga)\n\nStarring:Ryosuke Yamada, Tsubasa Honda, Dean Fujioka, Yasuko Matsuyuki, Misako Renbutsu, Ryuta Sato, Jun Kunimura, Natsuna Watanabe, Natsuki Harada, Yo Oizumi, Kanata Hongo, Fumiyo Kohinata,\n\nIMDB Website\n\nThis fantasy/action film has the potential to be huge since Warner Bros. Japan are backing it and the original manga by the super-talented Hiromu Arakawa is quite possibly one of the most popular franchises around. Bringing it to the screen is Fumihiko Sori, director of the live-action Ping Pong (2002) movie, a visual effects man who has done lots of CG films and he will be conducting a masterclass at the festival.\n\nSynopsis: Edward Elric (Ryosuke Yamada) and younger brother Alphonse’s mother passed away from the plague when they were little children. The two attempted to bring her back from the dead by performing a human transmutation which is taboo in alchemy. Their attempt fails disastrously. Edward loses part of his body and Alphonse loses his whole body. Edward sacrifices another part of his body to bind Alphonse’s soul to a suit of armour and then goes on to become an Alchemist. He sets out on a journey to find the “Philosopher’s stone,” which has the power to get back what they lost.\n\nThere are a lot of other films in the Special Screenings section such as a rock documentary, vibration: THE YELLOW MONKEY which tracks the popular group after they reformed and toured in 2016. Stephen Nomura Schible’s documentary, Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda traces the singular musician’s journey from his start in the 1980s pop world through to the major composer and performer today and his current battle against cancer and nuclear energy and his return to creating a major new work. It is fresh from being lauded at festivals in Europe and Canada and audiences in Tokyo will also get the chance to take part in one of the many special events at TIFF is a special talk called Visuals and Music: A Special Talk Event with 4th SAMURAI Award Recipient Ryuichi Sakamoto.\n\nSpeaking of samurai, there is a screening of the Shigemichi Sugita samurai movie, A Duel Tale. It is based on a story by writer Shuhei Fujisawa, writer of period tales such as The Hidden Blade, The Twilight Samurai, andLove and Honor, this one sees Tatsuya Nakadai plays Shoji an old samurai who merely lives with his brother’s family, but when his niece Yoshinari (Nanami Sakuraba) turns down a marriage proposal the guy doing the proposing is furious and calls on a male to fight in a duel. The old samurai in Shoji comes back to life to defend Yoshinari and as he begins dusting off his old skills he relives old memories.\n\nThe French-Japanese co-production Mutafukaz will be shown off at this year’s TIFF. the animation, which is based on a comic-book series, has been brought to life by Studio4°C (Batman Gotham Knight, Tekkonkinkreet, the three Berserk CG movies) and Ankama (WAKFU series). Mutafukaz is full of pop-culture references to things such as John Carpenter’s They Live and Batman as it brings a story of weird characters living in alternative LA seeing monsters.\n\nAlso fresh from foreign acclaim is director SABU’s Mr. Long, which premiered at Berlin earlier this year. It stars Taiwanese star Chang Chen as a gangster who hides out in Japan and rediscovers his heart as he becomes a cook in a working class neighbourhood. The GARO franchise picks up from its last live-action entry with Keita Amemiya’s GARO – KAMINOKIBA – which should ensure those looking for fantasy fighting fans can sate their appetites. Far more realistic and down-to-earth is Shashin Koshien Summer in 0.5 Seconds, which is based on the true tale of school kids in Hokkaido taking part in a photography contest.

How quaint. However, I can’t ready the synopsis for this and not think about the Junji Ito manga Uzumaki.\n\nSynopsis: Yoshika (Mayu Matsuoka) is 24-years-old with a fairly unique hobby: she likes researching ammonite fossils and collects them. Perhaps this explains why she doesn’t have a boyfriend in her life. Or maybe the lack of a man is down to the fact that she pines for her first love, a guy from school named Ichi. One day, Ni, a guy who works at the same company, confesses his feelings for her.\n\nThere is one Japanese film in the Asian Future section:\n\nPassage of Life\n\n僕の帰る場所 「Boku no kaerubasho」\n\nRunning Time: 100 mins.\n\nRelease Date: November 25th, 2017\n\nDirector: Akio Fujimoto\n\nWriter:Akio Fujimoto (Screenplay)\n\nStarring: Kaung Myat Thu, Khin Myat Thu, Issace, Htet Myat Naing, Yuki Kitagawa, Kanji Tsuda,\n\nIMDB Website\n\nSynopsis from IMDB: Passage of Life is based on a true story in the beginning of the 2010s.

I watched three of his early feature films but only reviewed one, Sunk Into the Womb, a brutal story of a woman who abandons her children.

A sex video is leaked and a rumour starts that Hitomi is the girl in the video. It’s all a lie, but it spreads like wildfire and Hitomi kills herself.

From that short came this feature about two friends who deal in drugs. This has been picked up by Third Window Films for world sales.

I guess that means there’s a talk involved.\n\nSynopsis from JFDB: Ken (Kato Shinsuke) and Kazu (Maiguma Katsuya) are partners in crime who use a car repair shop as their front for dealing stimulants. Ken tries to make a clean break after his girlfriend Saki (Iijima Shuna) gets pregnant, but Kazu has a secret…\n\nThe indie films from different organisations are also given a platform at the festival with the winners of this year’s Pia Film Festival and Skip City International D-Cinema Festival.\n\nThe Pia Film Festival Award Winning Film is:\n\nOur House\n\nわたしたちの家 「Watashitachi no ie」\n\nRunning Time:80 mins.\n\nRelease Date: January 13th, 2018\n\nDirector: Yui Kiyohara\n\nWriter:Yui Kiyohara, Noriko Kato (Screenplay),\n\nStarring:Kazuki Kasai, Yukiko Anno, Mari Ozawa,\n\nWebsite\n\nYui Kiyohara is a graduate student at the Tokyo National University of the Arts and has studied with Kiyoshi Kurosawa.

He was inspired to become a movie-maker after watching Family Game (1983).\n\nSynopsis: A group of four people gather together to commit suicide with a giant firework. However, after the explosion, the four are returned to just before their meeting. And it keeps happening. Three start to get the idea that the school girl in their group is actually from the future and try to persuade her not to join in…\n\nJapan Now has a distinctly female focus since amongst the large range of films on offer there has been the inclusion stand-out titles in the filmographies of four celebrated and internationally famous female actors, the Muses of Japanese Cinema, which sees Sakura Ando, Aoi Miyazaki, Yu Aoi, and Hikari Mitsushima get some of their most important and latest works screened. The inclusion of some smaller but excellent titles like 0.5mm and Dear Etranger from female directors shows that Japanese cinema has fostered female talent. All that remains is for audiences to support it so these talents can keep producing great films.\n\nRadiance\n\n光「Hikari」\n\nRunning Time: 129 mins.\n\nRelease Date: May 27th , 2017\n\nDirector: Naomi Kawase\n\nWriter: Naomi Kawase (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Masatoshi Nagase, Ayame Misaki, Tatsuya Fuji, Chihiro Ohtsuka, Kazuko Shirakawa, Saori Koide, Nobumitsu Onishi, Mantaro Koichi,\n\nWebsite IMDB\n\nNaomi Kawase is a native of the city of Nara and shot this film there. It won a lot of praise at the Cannes film festival earlier this year and has been picked up for distribution in many countries. See it at TIFF and then attend a master class with Kawase during which she will host a special screening of The Wolves of the East, for which Kawase served as executive producer, and a talk session with star Tatsuya Fuji.\n\nSynopsis: Masaya Nakamori (Masatoshi Nagase) is a genius photographer.

Sawako Decides (2010), Mitsuko Delivers (2012), and The Great Passage (2013). He has gone from indie kid to award-winning adaptations and kept a certain level of quality in his incisive look at human nature, regardless of genre and who the stars are. Here, he works with newbie actor Shizuka Ishibashi (daughter of Ryo Ishibashi) and pairs her up with the more experienced Sosuke Ikematsu (How Selfish I Am!) and Ryuhei Matsuda (Nightmare Detective, My Little Sweet Pea) who was the lead in The Great Passage. The actors all portray characters caught up in the whirlwind world of Tokyo, alienated, stressed, and looking for relief from the everyday grind. It is sleekly shot with visually inventive moments and beauty and captures life in Tokyo.\n\nSynopsis from the Berlin International Film Festival Site: Mika (Shizuka Ishibashi) works as a nurse by day; by night she entertains covetous men at a girls’ bar. Shinji (Sosuke Ikematsu) is blind in one eye and ekes out a living as a construction worker. Young and grown-up at the same time, they both lead a lonely existence, but somehow their paths keep miraculously crossing under the Tokyo sky. Can loneliness be experienced together?\n\nThe Night is Short, Walk on Girl\n\n夜は短し歩けよ乙女「Yoru wa Mijikashi Arukeyo Otome」\n\nRelease Date: April 17th, 2017\n\nRunning Time: 93 mins.\n\nDirector: Masaaki Yuasa\n\nWriter: Masaaki Yuasa, Reiko Yoshida (Screenplay) Tomihiko Morimi (Original Novel),\n\nAnimation Production: Science SARU\n\nStarring: Kana Hanazawa (Kurokami no Otome), Gen Hoshino (Senpai), Kazuya Nakai (Seitarou Higuchi), Yuuko Kaida (Ryouko Hanuki), Nobuyuki Hiyama (Johnny), Aoi Yuuki (Princess Daruma), Junichi Suwabe (Nise Jougasaki),\n\nMAL IMDB Website\n\nThe Night is Short, Walk On Girl is based on a best-selling novel by Tomihiko Morimi, author of other books adapted into anime such as The Eccentric Family and The Tatami Galaxy. The staff who created The Tatami Galaxy reunited for this film which was released in Japan in April. I saw posters of it plastered all over Kyoto while I wandered around the city and it’s no wonder since the novel is set there much like the rest of Tomihiko Morimi’s works.\n\nThe director is Masaaki Yuasa, the visionary director behind Mind Game, Ping Pong: The Animation, and The Tatami Galaxy who is finally being recognised by the international film festival circuit. He’s winning awards for his movies Lu Over the Wall and this one around the world. His direction is God-tier. How do I know?\n\nI saw this at a film festival I work for and I was surrounded by an audience who, like me, enjoyed every minute of the film. It’s a fantastic party film with lots of magical touches. We all laughed and whooped and cried throughout the film. I felt high energy throughout it all. Here’s my review.\n\nSynopsis: A black haired girl is walking around the streets of Kyoto as she goes bar-hopping, searches for a book from her childhood, and makes friends and enemies. She is being followed by a guy from her class, her senpai, who tries to arrange “coincidental meetings” in order to declare his love but as the night drags on, the city presents weird sights for the two from Tengu to a scooter-riding monkey…\n\nDear Etranger\n\n幼な子われらに生まれ 「Osanago Warera ni Umare」\n\nRunning Time: 127 mins.\n\nRelease Date: August 26th, 2017\n\nDirector: Yukiko Mishima\n\nWriter: Haruhiko Arai (Screenplay), Kiyoshi Shigematsu (Original Novel)\n\nStarring: Tadanobu Asano, Rena Tanaka, Kankuro Kudo, Shinobu Terajima, Sara Minami, Miu Arai, Raiju Kamata, Shingo Mizusawa, Narushi Ikeda,\n\nWebsite IMDB\n\nThis is a good drama that captures the difficulties in raising a family. It’s powered by great acting from Asano and Terajima as well as Tanaka and Kudo. It’s the sixth film from Yukiko Mishima (A Drop of the Grapevine), a female director I hope we hear more from based on this work.\n\nSynopsis: Dear Etranger is an intimate drama about one man trying to balance two families and be an ideal father at a time when others give him or are going through crises. Free from melodrama and idealism, it paints a believable picture of the stresses and strains of maintaining a loving family unit built from the scraps of past relationships.\n\nThe film is based on a novel by Kiyoshi Shigematsu and tells the tale of 40-year-old Makoto Tanaka (Tadanobu Asano), an assistant manager at a company.\n\nWhen we first meet him, he’s meeting his daughter from his first marriage. He and Saori (Raiju Kamata) are having a dream day out in a theme park but it’s soon to end because this is one of four visits he gets to see her in a year. She has to return home to Makoto’s ex-wife Yuka (Shinobu Terajima) and he has to return to his second family. This new clan consists of a younger wife named Nanae (Rena Tanaka) who went through a messy divorce herself because her ex, Sawada (Kankuro Kudo), was a brute who beat her and their daughter Kaoru (Sara Minami) and threatened their baby Eriko (Miu Arai).\n\nYU AOI\n\nYu Aoi gave two stand-out dramatic performances in films released and shown at/around last year’s TIFF (Japanese Girls Never Die and Over the Fence) so the programmers went and picked two light-hearted films. She has physical grace and these films should show that well.\n\nHana and Alice\n\n花とアリス 「Hana to Arisu」\n\nRunning Time: 135 mins.\n\nRelease Date: March 13th, 2004\n\nDirector: Shunji Iwai\n\nWriter:Shunji Iwai (Screenplay),\n\nStarring:Yu Aoi, Anne Suzuki, Tomohiro Kaku, Sei Hiraizumi, Tae Kimura, Shoko Aida,\n\nIMDB\n\nThis film is utterly charming and a lot lighter than Shunji Iwai’s other works. This is arguably Yu Aoi’s breakout work despite her appearance in Harmful Insect and Iwai’s All About Lily Chou-Chou (both from 2001 and both about bullying) and she would go on to appear in more of Iwai’s dramas. I had the pleasure of being at a screening of one of his titles at last year’s festival and sitting in on a Q&A and he was fascinating to listen to.\n\nSynopsis from IMDB: When two best friends develop a crush on the same boy, they develop a plan to trick him into dating them.\n\nWhat a Wonderful Family! 2\n\n家族はつらいよ 2「Kazoku wa tsuraiyo 2」\n\nRunning Time: 113 mins.\n\nRelease Date: May 27th, 2017\n\nDirector: Yoji Yamada\n\nWriter: Yoji Yamada, Emiko Hiramatsu (Screenplay), Yoji Yamada (Original Work)\n\nStarring: Isao Hashizume, Kazuko Yoshiyuki, Masahiko Nishimura, Yui Natsukawa, Shozo Hayashiya, Tomoko Nakajima, Satoshi Tsumabuki, Yu Aoi, Jun Fubuki,\n\nWebsite IMDB\n\nIt’s a comedy based on the characters from Tokyo Story. Yoji Yamada is making a third one of these films due out next year.\n\nSynopsis from the festival site: Several years have passed since Shuzo Hirata and his wife Tomiko came within inches of getting divorced. Shuzo loves driving and going out even if this causes accidents, but his family are against him roaming about…\n\nSAKURA ANDO\n\nSakura Ando does those edgy outsider roles that appear in dark films which draw on her ability to project heavy emotional weight. TIFF has picked two of her best films including one directed by her sister.\n\nOur Homeland\n\nかぞくのくに 「Kazoku no Kuni」\n\nReleaseDate: August 04th 2012 (Japan)\n\nRunningTime: 100 mins.\n\nDirector: Yang Yong-Hi\n\nWriter: Yang Yong-Hi\n\nStarring: Sakura Ando, Arata, Yang Ik-June, Kotomi Kyono, Jun Murakami, Taro Suwa,\n\nIMDB\n\nThis movie was at the 2012 Berlin Film Festival where it won the CICAE prize. It is a partly autobiographical tale that draws on the director’s life and also tells the story of the emigration of over 90,000 Koreans from Japan to North Korea after being promised a better life. Review shows that it is a strong dramatic film. It stars Sakura Ando (Love Exposure, Crime or Punishment?!?), Arata (After Life), Kotomi Kyono (Takeshi’), Jun Murakami (Himizu, The Land of Hope, Blazing Famiglia), Taro Suwa (Ju-On: The Curse, Reincarnation), Yoshiko Miyazaki (Villain).\n\nSynopsis: From 1959 to 1979 the North Korean government implemented a policy to attract Korean living in Japan to the idea of immigrating to North Korea. One of those who went was Son-Ho (Arata) who left his younger sister Rie (Ando) behind in Japan. 25 years later the two meets again when Son-Ho returns to Japan for three months for an operation. The film looks at the clash of feelings and cultures.\n\n0.5mm\n\n0.5ミリ 「0.5 miri」\n\nRelease Date: November 08th, 2014\n\nRunning Time: 196 mins\n\nDirector: Momoko Ando\n\nWriter: Momoko Ando (Screenplay)\n\nStarring: Sakura Ando, Junkichi Orimoto, Toshio Sakata, Masahiko Tsugawa, Akira Emoto.\n\nWebsite IMDB\n\nIn 0.5mm, Sakura Ando’s sister writes and directs a darkly funny take on Japanese society, confronting ageing, class and patriarchy.\n\nSynopsis:Sawa, a home helper for a middle class family with an elderly infirm grandfather, is forced to stretch her morals to keep her job. As a result, she finds herself broke and out on the street. She survives her first night by striking up an ambiguous friendship with a kindly old man, gaining access to a portion of the immense wealth held by Japan’s aging population. She continues with similar encounters, and while these begin as scams or revenge on rampant sexism, they ultimately become vulnerable intergenerational exchanges.\n\nAoi Miyazaki\n\nAoi Miyazaki has been reviewed here in a number of films from The Great Passage to Su-ki-da and Petal Dance. She can be cool and distant, an elusive and sensual presence but in Rage she plays manic and in Eureka devastatingly damaged.\n\nEureka\n\nユリイカ 「Yuriika」\n\nRunning Time: 218 mins.\n\nRelease Date: January 20th, 2000\n\nDirector: Shinji Aoyama\n\nWriter: Shinji Aoyama (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Koji Yakusho, Aoi Miyazaki, Masaru Miyazaki, Yoichiro Saito, Sayuri Kokusho, Ken Mitsuishi, Go Riju, Yutaka Matsushige,\n\nIMDB\n\nAoi Miyazaki and her brother made a big impact playing siblings in this film which is considered a modern classic and it’s Shinji Aoyama’s best work by far. Shot in a sepia tone and with little dialogue, it’s a deeply moving tale of overcoming a traumatic incident with great performances from Koji Yakusho and Aoi Miyazaki in the leads.\n\nSynopsis: Two years after a gruesome bus hijacking, the three remaining survivors come together to try and cope with the traumatizing memories. Among them is bus driver Makoto, who faces suspicions over his role in the tragedy. He tries to track down the brother and sister who also survived. A deeply moving, slow-burning drama set in the countryside of Kyushu, where time moves significantly slower than in other parts of Japan.\n\nRAGE\n\n怒り 「Ikari」\n\nRunning Time: 142 mins\n\nDirector: Sang-il Lee\n\nWriter: Sang-il Lee (Screenplay), Shuichi Yoshida (Novel),\n\nStarring: Ken Watanabe, Hikari Mitsushima, Mirai Moriyama, Aoi Miyazaki, Satoshi Tsumabuki, Gou Ayano, Suzu Hirose, Hideko Hara, Pierre Taki, Takahiro Miura, Mitsuki Takahata, Chizuru Ikewaki, Akira Emoto, Eri Fukatsu, Kirin Kiki, Kenichi Matsuyama,\n\nWebsite IMDB\n\nWhen I first arrived in Tokyo just over a year ago, posters for this film were everywhere:\n\nI watched it after returning to the UK and found it to be a powerful drama (review over on VCinema) fascinated with the idea of evil and people hiding their true identities. It is based on a novel by Shuichi Yoshida and he has had many of his books turned into films and they are almost all available in the UK thanks to Third Window Films: A Story of Yonosuke (2013), Villain (2010), Parade (2010) The Ravine of Goodbye (2013) isn’t one of them but it was at the London Film Festival. Sang-il Lee handled the big-screen adaptation of Villain (2010) and crafted a good drama. Rage looks to be on a par. It contains a stellar cast who have been in many films including Aoi Miyazaki.\n\nSynopsis: A a married couple is brutally murdered by someone. The only clues are that the murderer is a man and he wrote the word “Ikari” (“Anger”) with the blood of the couple. The killer undergoes plastic surgery and flees and Japan is gripped by the crime and whenever a male stranger appears in a community, the people there suspect that the stranger might be the murderer.\n\nPeople such as Yohei Maki (Ken Watanabe) who works at a harbour in Chiba. He is concerned that the man his daughter Aiko (Aoi Miyazaki) is dating, Tetsuya Tashiro (Kenichi Matsuyama), might be the killer, because Tetsuya is not his real name.\n\nAn advertising executive named Yuma Fujita (Satoshi Tsumabuki) falls for a man named Naoto Onishi (Gou Ayano) and they begin to live together but Yuma soon develops suspicions that Naoto is the killer.\n\nIzumi Komiya (Suzu Hirose) and her mother (Urara Awata) move to an isolated island in Okinawa and Izumi meets a backpacker named Shingo Tanaka (Mirai Moriyama) who is hiding a secret.\n\nThree different communities across Japan, three different stories involving different people, all linked by one murder.\n\nHIKARI MITSUSHIMA\n\nThere are many films that could have been picked to represent Hikari Mitsushima like Sawako Decides and Love Exposure but these two are her latest and pretty strong. Capable of being punkish and vulnerable at the same time, she takes centre stage in both films at TIFF and shows her acting chops. Her turn in Traces of Sin will be sure to have audiences sympathising.\n\nLife and Death on the Shore\n\n海辺の生と死 「Umibe no Sei to She」\n\nRunning Time: 155 mins.\n\nDirector: Michio Koshikawa\n\nWriter: Michio Koshikawa (Screenplay), Miho Shimao, Toshio Shimao (Original Essay)\n\nStarring:Hikari Mitsushima, Kento Nagayama, Yota Kawase, Kai Inowaki, Masane Tsukayama,\n\nWebsite JFDB\n\nThis is Michio Koshikawa’s sophomore film but he has an extensive filmography as a producer with titles like The Wife of Gegege, Sketches of Kaitan City (both 2010), Our Homeland (2012) and “A Band Rabbit” and a Boy (2013), and Asleep (2015). This is a war movie and it was the second film made by Hikari Mitsushima in 2017 (the other is Trace of Sin) who has worked with Koshikawa on one of his films. She is paired up with Kento Nagayama in this romantic war-time melodrama.\n\nSynopsis: It is 1945 and World War II is about to reach its end. Saku (Kento Nagayama) arrives on the island of Kakerojima, just south-west of the coast of Kyushu, to take command of navy special forces. His entry enlivens the place as the children on the island admire him and he sets the pulse of the elementary school teacher Toe (Hikari Mitsushima) racing. As the war winds down, she develops feelings for him until, one day, Toe receives a letter from Saku with a simple message, “please come to the beach around 9PM tonight.”\n\nGukoroku – Traces of Sin\n\n愚行録 「Gukoroku」\n\nRunning Time: 120 mins.\n\nDirector: Kei Ishikawa\n\nWriter: Kosuke Mukai (Screenplay), Tokuro Nukui (Original Novel),\n\nStarring: Satoshi Tsumabuki, Hikari Mitsushima, Keisuke Koide, Asami Usuda, Yui Ichikawa,\n\nWebsite IMDB\n\nHikari Mitsushima and Satoshi Tsumabuki play siblings in this shocking exploration of class-warfare and murder. There are some surprise deaths and great acting turns that will leave audiences reeling.\n\nSynopsis from the Nippon Connection: Several years after the brutal, unsolved murder of a Tokyo family, ambitious reporter Tanaka attempts to find the perpetrators of the crime. Step by step, he comes close to discovering what really happened.\n\nThere are other titles that are fresh from touring the international festival circuit such as Hirokazu Kore-eda’s critically-acclaimed murder mystery, The Third Murder and Daihachi Yoshida’s sci-fi family tale A Beautiful Star which is about a family who believe they are aliens with a mission to save the Earth from nuclear weapons. One of the big highlights has got to be seeing the grand-old man of Japanese arthouse cinema Nobuhiko Obayashi of House fame who has made another film. This one is Hanagatami, an anti-war tale that looks as colourful and imaginative as some of his earlier titles.\n\nHanagatami\n\n花筐 「Hanagatami」\n\nRunning Time: 169 mins.\n\nRelease Date: December 16th, 2017\n\nDirector: Nobuhiko Obayashi\n\nWriter:Nobuhiko Obayashi, Chiho Katsura (Screenplay),\n\nStarring:Shunsuke Kubozuka, Shinnosuke Mitsushima, Keishi Nagatsuka, Tokio Emoto, Mugi Kadowaki, Yuriko Oo, Tetsuya Takeda, Takako Tokiwa, Hirona Yamazaki,\n\nIMDB Website\n\nSynopsis: It is the spring of 1941 and the setting is Karatsu City, Saga Prefecture. Toshihiko, a 17-year-old, lives life to the full and has a close group of friends including a cousin named Mina who suffers from lung disease but the war is drawing closer and their lives will be changed forever…\n\nOpen-Air Cinema Arena 30\n\nHer Love Boils Bathwater\n\n湯を沸かすほどの熱い愛 「Yu wo wakasuhodo no atsui ai」\n\nRunning Time: 125 mins.\n\nDirector: Ryota Nakano\n\nWriter: Ryota Nakano (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Rie Miyazawa, Hana Sugisaki, Taro Suruga, Aoi Ito, Tori Matsuzaka, Joe Odagiri, Yukiko Shinohara,\n\nWebsite IMDB JFDB\n\nThis was at the Tokyo International Film Festival last year and reviews like this one paint a picture of a great family drama thanks to the actors Rie Miyazawa (Pale Moon, Twilight Samurai), Joe Odagiri (Bright Future, Mushishi), and Hana Sugisaki (Pieta in the Toilet).\n\nSynopsis: Futaba and her daughter Azumi live in a house connected to their family-run bathhouse in a small town. Their used to be three people in their family but husband and father Kazuhiro left them for another woman and since then, the bathhouse has been closed. Everything changes when Futaba is diagnosed with terminal cancer, giving her only months to live. The approach of death fires her up to make the most of her remaining time.

Ecotherapy Getaway Holiday is his latest film and it features another ensemble but they are a bunch of unknowns. This was at the Tokyo International Film Festival and Mark Schilling’s review in The Japan Times indicates that this is a solid dramedy.\n\nSynopsis: Seven middle-aged/elderly women go for a tour of a mountain to see a picturesque waterfall. Their trip is pleasant until their male guide disappears and leaves them stranded deep in the mountains and with no cellphone service.\n\nSchool Days with a Pig\n\nブタがいた教室 「Buta ga Ita kyoushitsu」\n\nRunning Time: 109 mins.\n\nRelease Date: November 01st, 2008\n\nDirector: Tetsu Maeda\n\nWriter:Hirotoshi Kobayashi (Screenplay), Yasushi Kuroda (Original Novel)\n\nStarring:Satoshi Tsumabuki, Ren Osugi, Tomoko Tabata, Seiji Ikeda, Mieko Harada, Itsumi Osawa, Pierre Taki, Naho Toda, Runa Natsui,\n\nIMDB\n\nThis film is based on a true event that took place in an elementary school in Osaka Prefecture.

His most famous is “The Great Wave off Kanagawa,” that features a huge wave of blue surging water topped by white foam framing Mount Fuji. It is an image that can be found in galleries, on posters, and other types of merchandise and it is images like these that inspired some of the stylistic techniques of the French Impressionists. Would it surprise you to hear that Katsushika Hokusai had a daughter who was also an artist? That she created works in her own right? That some scholars suggest she was more than just her father’s assistant but a close collaborator who played a major role in his art as he neared 90 and had palsy? Like many a female artist it seems that her contribution to art has been forgotten about by history, something which the anime “Miss Hokusai” seeks to redress.\n\nColorful\n\nカラフル 「Karafuru」\n\nRelease Date: August 21st, 2010\n\nRunning Time: 126 mins.\n\nDirector: Keiichi Hara\n\nWriter: Miho Maruo (Screenplay), Eto Mori (Original Creator)\n\nStarring:Kazato Tomizawa (Makoto Kobayashi), Akina Minami (Hiroaki Kuwabara), Kumiko Aso (Makoto’s Mother), Katsumi Takahashi (Makoto’s Father), Aoi Miyazaki (Shoko Sano) Michael (Purapura)\n\nIMDB\n\nColorful is an award-winning movie adapted from a novel written by Eto Mori. It won the award for Excellent Animation of the Year at the 34th Japan Academy Prize and received the Audience Award and Special Distinction prize at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in 2011. It’s a great drama that is sure to make people cry.\n\nSynopsis: Upon reaching the train station to death, a dejected soul is informed that he is ‘lucky’ and will have another chance at life and is placed in the body of a 14-year-old boy named Makoto Kobayashi, who has just committed suicide. Watched over by a neutral spirit named Purapura, the soul must figure out what his greatest sin and mistake in his former life was before his time limit in Makoto’s body runs out. He also has a number of other lesser duties he must complete, such as understanding what led Makoto to commit suicide in the first place and learning how to enjoy his second chance at life.\n\nDawn of a Filmmaker: The Kinoshita Keisuke Story\n\nはじまりのみち 「 Hajimari no Michi」\n\nRelease Date: June 01st, 2013 (Japan)\n\nRunning Time: 96 mins.\n\nDirector: Keiichi Hara\n\nWriter: Keiichi Hara (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Ryo Kase, Yuko Tanaka, Aoi Miyazaki, Gaku Hamada, Ren Osugi, Mari Hamada, Yusuke Santamaria, Ken Mitsuishi Shigeru Saiki, Itsuki Sagara, Mayu Matsuoka, Shoko Fujimura\n\nIMDB\n\nThis film was made to commemorate the 100th year anniversary of Keisuke Kinoshita’s birth and it follows his early life from his days as a lively youth to his entry into Shochiku movie studio. The trailer is pretty earnest and some of the themes seem to be the loyalty of a son to his mother and the mother’s belief in him. Wipe away the tears and you will see that footage from Kinoshita’s films has been interwoven into the new film. Aoi Miyazaki leading those children along the riverbank is a clear nod to Twenty-Four Eyes.\n\nKeisuke Kinoshita was a contemporary of Kurosawa, Ozu and Mizoguchi and yet he is pretty unknown to a lot of cinephiles in the west. Okay, that may be a bit of an exaggeration because his films Twenty-Four Eyes and The Ballad of Narayama are available in the west and pretty famous but a lot of his other titles are only now getting screened at recent film festivals like Berlin and Venice. To be quite frank his work is unknown to me but from writing up about him I can see how he is important since a lot of those titles sound different to the films of Ozu, presenting interesting new stories that must have challenged the views of audiences of the time. Wikipedia makes him sound like he has an interesting visual style as well:\n\nHe refused to be bound by genre, technique or dogma. He excelled in almost every genre, comedy, tragedy, social dramas, period films. He shot all films on location or in a one-house set. He pursued severe photographic realism with the long take, long-shot method, and he has gone equally far toward stylization with fast cutting, intricate wipes, tilted cameras and even medieval scroll-painting and Kabuki stage technique.\n\nThere is more anime at the festival from claymation to the screening of 5 films directed by Makoto Shinkai as part of an All night screening presented by WOWOW’s “CINEMA STUDIO”.\n\nJapanese Classics\n\nSansho the Bailiff\n\n山椒大夫 「Sanshou Dayuu」\n\nRunning Time: 126 mins.\n\nRelease Date: March 31st, 1954\n\nDirector: Kenji Mizoguchi\n\nWriter: Fuji Yahiro, Yoshitaka Yoda, (Screenplay) Mori Ogai (Original Story),\n\nStarring:Kinuyo Tanaka, Yoshiaki Hanayagi, Kyoko Kagawa, Eitarou Shindou,\n\nIMDB\n\nSynopsis: I saw this in a double-bill with Ugetsu Monogatari when I was a teenager and cried my little heart out at the end. It’s a jidai-geki set in the Heian period and tells the tale of a virtuous governor who gets exiled to be the lord of a remote province. When his wife and children travel to meet him years later, they are betrayed and the mother is sold into prostitution and the children are sold into slavery. They battle to retain their humanity and will to live even under such awful circumstances.\n\nBallad of Narayama\n\n楢山節考 「Narayama bushiko」\n\nRunning Time: 130 mins.\n\nRelease Date: April 29th , 1983\n\nDirector: Shohei Imamura\n\nWriter: Shohei Imamura (Screenplay), Shichiro Fukazawa (Original Novel),\n\nStarring: Ken Ogata, Sumiko Sakamoto, Tonpei Hidari, Aki Takejo, Shoichi Ozawa, Fujio Tokita, Seiji Kurasaki, Junko Takada, Mitsuko Baisho,\n\nIMDB\n\nShohei Imamura is one of the New Wave directors that came after the golden age of Kurosawa and Ozu. Indeed, he worked with Ozu on a number of films such as on the films Early Summer (1951), The Flavor of Green Tea over Rice (1952) and Tokyo Story (1953) before he blazed a trail of his own with fiction and documentary films that offered a critique of Japanese society – Pigs and Battleships (1961), The Profound Desire of the Gods (1961) and Vengeance is Mine (1979), and Black Rain (1989). He won a Palme d’Or for this film and The Eel (1997). My personal favourite of his works is the more laidback and funny, Warm Water Under a Red Bridge (2001).\n\nSynopsis: The film is set in poor rural Japanese village some time in the 19th century. It is tradition that everyone who reaches the age of 70 has to climb a nearby mountain to die. An old woman named Orin resolves not to be a burden on her family and spends a year wrapping up affairs and helping her family before she makes her own journey. We see her efforts.\n\nKagemusha\n\n影武者 「Kagemusha」\n\nRunning Time: 180 mins.\n\nRelease Date: April 26th, 1980\n\nDirector: Akira Kurosawa\n\nWriter:Akira Kurosawa, Masato Ide (Screenplay),\n\nStarring:Tatsuya Nakadai, Tsutomu Yamazaki, Kenichi Hagiwara, Kaori Momoi, Takashi Shimura, Mitsuko Baisho, Jinpachi Nezu,\n\nIMDB\n\nThis Kurosawa title which won the Palme d’Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival is the 4K Digitally Restored Version which gives rise to the hope that, like Ran, it will tour different cinemas around the world. Watch the trailer and imagine it looking a lot better.\n\nSynopsis from Wikipedia: In Japanese, kagemusha is a term used to denote a political decoy. It is set in the Sengoku period of Japanese history and tells the story of a lower-class criminal who is taught to impersonate a dying daimyō to dissuade opposing lords from attacking the newly vulnerable clan. The daimyō is based on Takeda Shingen, and the film ends with the climactic 1575 Battle of Nagashino.\n\nChikamatsu Monogatari\n\n近松物語 「Chikamatsu Monogatari」\n\nRunning Time: 102 mins.\n\nRelease Date: November 23rd, 1954\n\nDirector: Kenji Mizoguchi\n\nWriter: Yoshitaka Yoda, Matsutarou Kawaguchi (Screenplay), Chikamatsu Monzaemon (Original Story),\n\nStarring:Kazuo Hasegawa, Kyoko Kagawa, Yoko Minamida, Eitarou Shindou,\n\nWebsite IMDB\n\nSynopsis: Ishun is a wealthy, but miserly scroll-maker in Kyoto. He is married to a beautiful young woman named Osan who is only in the relationship for money. Things go wrong for Osan when she is wrongly accused of infidelity with one of Ishun’s apprentices. Osan and the apprentice flee from Ishun who is desperate to track them down to prevent the scandal from leaking…\n\nDOCUMENTARIES\n\nBunka-Cho Film Week 2017 will award excellent documentaries and individuals in recognition of their many years of distinguished contributions to the film industry.
