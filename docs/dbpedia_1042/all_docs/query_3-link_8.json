What is the difference in how to celebrate Japan and Korea?\n\nIn Japan, the “coming -of -age ceremony” is one of the big events of life!\n\nThe coming -of -age ceremony is held every year near the second Monday of January near the public holiday \"Adult Day\", except for some areas.👑\n\nThere is also a day like \"Adult Day\" in Korea.✨\n\nThat is \"Adult Day (성년 의 날)\", which is specified on the third Monday of May every year ^^\n\nHowever, South Korea's \"Adult Day\" is different from Japan, not a national holiday.\n\nIn addition, large events such as the coming -of -age ceremony are basically held, and we celebrate with close friends, such as family, friends, and lovers.😊\n\nIntroducing idols in Japan and Korea, who are 20 years old in 2024!\n\nAdults have passed, but it can be
