        "text": "Ah, the endless allure of the Japanese high-school. The days of the beauty of youth and overwhelming innocence…Something that appeals quite a bit, it would seem, to pop god and on-the-side metal magician Nishikawa Takanori, who will spend some academic time away from abingdon boys school in order to go co-ed for Fuji TV’s new drama, Okusama wa 18-sai [My Wife is 18-Years-Old].\n\nOkusama wa 18-Sai is based on the shoujo manga of the same name, as penned by Motomura Miyoko. Okusama wa 18-Sai revolves around the secret marriage between a Japanese-language teacher and his student, and was originally set to take place in the United States. The manga was serialized in Margaret magazine by Shueisha Publishing in 1969.\n\nThe secret relationship between teacher and student is one of the more popular topics in dramas and animes, and apparently is in no danger of losing popularity. Especially once Nishikawa gets in on it, I have no doubt the limelight relationship will cause all kinds of schoolgirl fantasies to unfurl…Unsatisfied, the principles of every Tokyo school district hope.\n\nThe show originally aired in 1970, catching the late Ishidate Tetsuo with his hand in the cookie-jar, and Okazaki Yuki as the kitten Okusama.\n\n2011 brings Okusama wa 18-Sai back to Japan and the romantic tension of democratic classroom cleaning policies and a sea of plaid-skirted temptation, enough to drive any man over the edge. And we’re right there with Nishikawa Takanori as he navigates the plot-thick high-school days as teacher Takagi, who must hide his relationship with his wife Asuka (Watanabe Natsuna), who is also his student.\n\nAlthough I’m sure he’ll have no trouble pretending he’s not married to her (most people try anyway, don’t they?), while sporting that impeccable blond coif Nishikawa may have a harder time convincing us that he’s not T.M.Revolution doing some kind of social services. That being said, for someone who just hit their 4th decade, Nishikawa is defying age as admirably as any Cullen, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he plays some 8th-grader in the next unnecessary Great Teacher Onizuka remake.\n\nHis variety show and hosting experience aside, Nishikawa has appeared in several other television dramas, such as “Beautiful Life“, and has also starred in the full-length film Corazon de Melon, which premiered at NYU’s Cantor Film Center in New York City on September 28, 2008.\n\nWatanabe Natsuna has appeared in a smattering of shows since 2006, none of which I have heard of and therefore hardly feel motivated to list. She also appears in feature-films Kimi ni Todoke (2010) and GANTZ (2011).\n\nFetishes and immortality aside, Nishikawa’s newest venture into acting, Okusama wa 18-sai sounds like a charming drama, and I look forward to getting an opportunity to see the abingdon boys school frontman go totally co-ed.\n\nThe new TV series will be on air from 22:00 March 27th on Fuji TV, and so far has a scheduled run of 4 episodes.\n\nRate this:\n\nIt must be awesome to not have to die before people celebrate your life’s work. And, although they do often conjure images of demons and underworlds and gloomy macabre classifiable “other”, Gothic emperors BUCK-TICK shot off their fire-work-worthy career nearly 30 years ago, and remain to this day anything but dead. After nearly 3 decades of ridiculously good rockin’, the veteran J-rockers are still going strong, and the respect of their fans only seems to increase the more years the gloomy gang racks up.\n\nOn June 27th, this five-star national-treasure of Visual Kei will be celebrated by six selected bands in an unholy tribute fest: FIVE STAR FACTORY PRESENTS: BUCK-TICK A TRIBUTE CONCERT.\n\nOne of the more widely “covered” bands in the J-music scene, BUCK-TICK has seen their fair share of tribute. A couple of years ago renowned Visual and J-rockers were selected to cover songs for a tribute album called Parade~ Respective Tracks of BUCK-TICK. These artists included abingdon boys school and Kiyoharu, as well as a range of lesser-names from the industry.\n\nNow, the band will be officially honored as the five-star vet Visualists they are, in an event dedicated solely to playing covers of their music, new and classic, and (hopefully) everything in between. The band’s work will be represented by a performance of 6 cover-bands:\n\n爆－竹 [Boku-Take]\n\nBUCKRI-TICKRI\n\nB-T-K\n\nMADS\n\nSHAKA-TICK\n\nONE NIGHT BALLET MOONLIGHT HIBIKI\n\n…and one DJ: D.D.D.J.X4N20\n\nAs far as I am aware, these are all one-time session bands created for the purpose of this concert, so if you don’t recognize any of these names, don’t worry. Nobody else does either. The most exciting of the groups is the final listed name, ONE NIGHT BALLET MOONLIGHT HIBIKI, the lineup of which is almost as much of a mouthful as their never-ending name. The group consists of ex-Sugar bassist Loki, ex-The GazettE drummer Yune (as “Dekith”), ex- The Candy Spooky Theater guitarist Zull, ex-Calmando Qual vocalist Hibiki, and finally ex-munimuni guitarist Matenrou (yes, as in the opera) .\n\nNote: Just for clarity’s sake, Loki was the vocalist for Sugar, not the bassist, but his role in ONE NIGHT is the bassist. Don’t spam me with correction- comments!\n\nI’ll finish it off with some footage of rally‘s cover of Aku no Hana, which they performed at BUCK-TICK FEST in 2007.\n\nrally are:\n\nguitar – HISASHI (GLAY)\n\nvocals – TERU (GLAY)\n\nbass – ウエノコウジ / ueno kouji (radio caroline)\n\ndrums – 宮上 元克 / miyagami motokatsu (the mad capsule markets)\n\nFIVE STAR FACTORY official website (Japanese)\n\nRate this:\n\nI’m on a roll. And, as they say, yesterday’s enemies are today’s friends. Speaking of which, I think I’m starting to get a hang of Nishikawa’s lyrical style, so things should just get easier from here on out. Just as a note, in the ABINGDON ROAD version of the song, Nishikawa sings the chorus once as an intro before the regular lyrics begin.\n\nSong: From Dusk Till Dawn\n\nArtist: abingdon boys school\n\nAlbum: From Dusk Till Dawn (’09)\n\nLyrics by Nishikawa Takanori, music by Shibasaki Hiroshi\n\nKANJI\n\n暮れてく夕映えに砂が押されて\n\n歩き出す影が示す方へ\n\n絶えない幾つもの出会いと別れを\n\n繰り返しどこへ向かうのか\n\n人は誰も 迷いながら 罪とう名の 運命を背負って\n\nそれでなお 生きる意味を 知るだろう\n\n僕らは そう Day by Day 明日へ 続く道の途中で\n\nNow Say It Again 君とふたりのまま居られたならいいのになー\n\n何かを 失って 何かを手に入れて\n\n消れてく 僕の心には\n\n傷だらけで痣にも似た数えきれないほころびがあって\n\nそれでもまた光差す揚所を目指して\n\n僕らはそう Day by Day 描いた 果てない未来の地図に\n\nNow Say It Again ずっとあの日のまま居られたなら\n\n限りある時の中で 限りない夢を抱いて\n\n打ち鳴らす胸の鼓動が 君を呼び続ける\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn\n\nひそやかに野に咲く 名もないき花びらの様に\n\nそう Day by Day 明日へ続く道の途中で\n\nNow Say it Again 君とふたりのまま\n\n移りゆく世界に その足音だけを 残して\n\nROMAJI:\n\nKureteku yuubaeni suna ga osarete\n\narukidasu kage ga shimesu hou he\n\nTaenai ikutsumono deai to wakare wo\n\nkurikaeshi doko e mukau no ka?\n\nHito wa dare mo mayoinagara\n\ntsui to iu nano sadame wo seotte\n\nsore demo nao ikiru imi wo shiru darou\n\nBokura ha sou Day by Day ashita he tsuzuku michi no tochuu de\n\nNow Say It Again kimi to futari no mama iraretanara ii noni na\n\nNanika wo ushinatte nanika wo te ni irete\n\nKesureteku boku no kokoro ni ha\n\nkizudarakede aza ni mo nita hokorobi ga atte\n\nsoredemo mata hikarisuyousho wo mezashite\n\nBokura ha sou Day by Day egaita hatenai mirai no chizu ni\n\nNow Say It Again zutto ano hi no mama iraretanara\n\nKagiri aru toki no naka de kagirinai yume wo daite\n\nuchinarasu mune no kodou ga kimi wo yobitsuzukeru\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn\n\nhisoyaka ni noni saku namonaiki hanabira no youni\n\nSou Day by Day ashite he tsuzuku michi no tochuu de\n\nNow Say It Again kimi to futari no mama\n\nutsuriyuku sekai ni sono ashioto dake wo nokoshite\n\nENGLISH:\n\nIn the darkening sunset, sand pressed underfoot,\n\nthe shadow that begins walking indicates the direction we are moving\n\nAre we turning toward the cycle of endless meetings and goodbyes,\n\nwhich are too many to count?\n\nDespite their bewilderment, a person is, everyone is, burdened by the destiny called “sin”\n\nStill, because of that they know the reason of living, don’t they?\n\nWe are, yes, DAY BY DAY, moving toward tomorrow\n\nOn the path that continues on\n\nNOW SAY IT AGAIN remaining together with you, it would have been nice\n\nto live that way….\n\nLosing something, and gaining something,\n\nIt’s being erased, my spirit\n\nCovered in scars and bruises, there are too many open wounds to count\n\nBut even so we are aiming at a better, brighter place\n\nAs for us, we drew it DAY BY DAY, the map of the unending future\n\nNOW SAY IT AGAIN if we could only live together forever, remaining as we were that day\n\nWithin the time that has limits, I embrace the limitless dreams\n\nThe heartbeat ringing in my chest continues to call out to you…\n\nFROM DUSK TILL DAWN\n\nBlooming wildly in the stillness, like the petals of an unknown flower\n\nYes, DAY BY DAY moving on the path that continues toward tomorrow\n\nNOW SAY IT AGAIN, remaining in this way together with you\n\nLeaving behind only the sound of our footsteps, in this changing world\n\nTranslating is a lot of work.

Nishikawa is an amazing lyricist, and I really like his use of nature elements, metaphor, and way of expressing complex feelings with simple words. My favorite line in the whole song is the one about the bubble.\n\nSong: and I love…\n\nArtist: abingdon boys school\n\nAlbum: Abingdon Road (2010)\n\nLyrics by Nishikawa Takanori, music by Kishi Toshiyuki\n\nRomaji:\n\nAmadare ni koboeta kimi no kata ga nureru\n\ntsunaida boku no te wo poketto ni shimatte\n\nsonna nanigenai yasashisa ni boku ha kidzukenakute\n\nMou ichido kimi ni aerunara tarinai kotoba wo zenbu tabanete\n\nayanashite tsutsumu kasa ni nari kimi wo mukaeni yukukara\n\nMy love, and I love…\n\nMy love, and I love…\n\n“gomen ne” tte dorekurai kimi ni kikaseta kana?\n\n“arigatou” tte dorekurai kimi ni ieta no kana?\n\nima ha nani mo nai kono heya ni fuyu no nioi ga shita\n\nme wo tojirutabi ni omoidasu kimi no egao mo, koe mo, nukumori mo\n\nnamima ni tayutau awa no youni usete kioku no unabara e\n\nmou ichido kimi ni aetanara karenai omoi wo hitotsu kakaete\n\nharumoe amane wo utanishite kimi ni todokeni yukukara\n\nboku no kokoro wo takushite\n\nMy love, and I love…\n\nMy love, and I love…\n\nEnglish:\n\nThe rain drops fell, and your figure became soaked\n\nIn my pocket, I close the hand that you held\n\nI don’t notice your casual kindness\n\nIf I can meet you again one day, binding up all of the insignificant words,\n\nI’ll become an umbrella that covers you with multi-colored lights, because I’m setting out\n\nto see you\n\nMy love, and I love…\n\nMy love, and I love…\n\nHow many times did I tell you “I’m sorry”?\n\nHow many times did I say “thank you”, I wonder?\n\nNow, in this room where there is nothing, I caught the scent of winter\n\nEverytime I close my eyes, it all comes back to me; your smiling face, your voice, your warmth\n\nLike a bubble drifting on the waves, disappearing, into the deep ocean of my memories\n\nIf I had been able to meet you once again, holding onto this single unwithering feeling,\n\nSinging the sound of the first spring rain, I work my way toward you\n\nI entrust my heart to you\n\nMy love, and I love…\n\nMy love, and I love…\n\nTranslating is hard work.
