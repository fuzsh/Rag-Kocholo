        "text": "According to Women's Own Magazine, Natsumi Watanabe, a popular actress who married the company's operator in January, originally planned to star in the MHK Japanese drama, but her name was suddenly removed from the script in early August. It is reported that she had to give up acting because she was pregnant and had to take care of the baby in her belly.\n\nA Japanese drama related source revealed: \"It was the beginning of August. I saw that Natsunobi Watanabe's name was no longer in NHK's script, but it was in both the original draft and the revised draft. The show was mainly filmed on location, and had to be filmed for a few days on the outskirts of Tokyo after the Menglan Basin Festival, but Watanabe suddenly released pigeons shortly before filming. Although she played an important role in the play, she did not specify the reason for her sudden departure. All crew members did PCR before filming and found no positive results. Because of the new crown pneumonia, it is impossible to quit. ”\n\nIn 2012, Natsuki Watanabe was chosen to star in the NHK series of novels Pure and Love. He hosted the music program \"The Covers\" for two months in March 2014 and has a close relationship with NHK TV. In terms of private life, Natsumi Watanabe registered and married the president of an IT company on January 16 this year, and when he attended the game launch on January 31, he also expressed his expectation that he would be able to go out for his honeymoon as soon as the epidemic passed.\n\nNatsui Watanabe, who has been very successful in both public and private affairs, was also revealed by FRIDAY magazine on September 3 that she was happy to participate in the Japanese drama shooting of People's Radio in August, but why did she suddenly give up the NHK Japanese drama that she cares so much? An insider in the circle gave the answer: \"Actually, because Watanabe Natsuki found out that she was pregnant, she should announce this good news to the public soon.\" There are a lot of outdoor scenes in this episode, considering that it may affect pregnancy, in case Natsuki Watanabe has to give up acting. ”\n\nIn February, when Natsuki Watanabe was interviewed by Women's Self magazine, her first words to speculation four years later were that she should have a baby. She also said: \"I have a child should be a tiger mother, my family has three brothers and sisters, I am the eldest sister, take care of two younger brothers, my mother is also very strict, now I am very strict with dogs.\" ”\n\nThe insider also revealed: \"Married so quickly and pregnant, Watanabe Charlai and his wife are very happy.\" NHK Japanese drama has decided to replace her starring in another serial novel, and Natsumi Watanabe is also very grateful to the other party. \"I look forward to Natsuki Watanabe continuing to be active in the entertainment industry as a mother artist after giving birth.\""
