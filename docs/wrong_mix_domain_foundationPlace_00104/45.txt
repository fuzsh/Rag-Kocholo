Belleville Wisconsin Arts…

BELLEVILLE AREA CULTURAL FOUNDATION, INC.

The Belleville Area Cultural Foundation promotes Belleville Wisconsin arts, cultural programs, educational opportunities and quality entertainment in the Greater Belleville WI Area.

“Together We Bring The World To The Greater Belleville Area”

It is our mission to support and bring the arts to the Greater Belleville, WI area through various cultural, educational and entertainment programs; to provide an annual scholarship to a deserving high school student involved in the cultured activities and achievement; and to inspire our youth by involving them in many of our varied programs.

The BACF is an example of how a small community can help bring significant programs to the Belleville WI area, inspire the arts in our children and future generations, and ensure the future of our organization! It is all about the future of our community. With the help of every area household, business and organization, our cultural opportunities will grow in proportion to our investment in the BACF. You can help make Belleville, Wisconsin arts grow for our community by joining the BACF.

“It is never too late or too early to build for the future.” ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson

All any of us can do as individuals is to give our families and future generations an example to follow. The Belleville Area Cultural Foundation is that example of what our community can do with everyone participating. If you have a child, grandchild, niece or nephew, a business, are living or teaching in our community or just love good entertainment, you should be a shareholder of the Belleville Area Cultural Foundation.

This is your Belleville Area Cultural Foundation. It is what you and other members make it.
