        "text": "Transforming how the public navigates and accesses government programs\n\nIncreasing efficiency, transparency around public services and activities with generative AI\n\nREDWOOD CITY, Calif. – July 15, 2024 – C3 AI (NYSE:AI), the Enterprise AI application software company, today announced C3 Generative AI for Government Programs, a generative AI application that helps federal, state, and local governments quickly deliver accurate information to the public about government programs ranging from healthcare, employment, financial assistance, and more. The application streamlines access and comprehension of complex government programs and processes for hundreds of millions of citizens and residents, helping them navigate systems and services with ease.\n\nWith C3 Generative AI for Government Programs, federal, state, or local government agencies can eliminate service delays, reduce wait times, make contact centers more effective, and improve the citizen experience. By empowering the public to find answers directly through an intuitive search and chat interface, support centers will see decreased inquiry volumes and strain, allowing service representatives to focus on more complex cases and inquiries.\n\n“Understanding and accessing vital services and benefits programs can be an overwhelming process for many, and C3 Generative AI for Government Programs provides an easy way to get clear and quick answers to questions about the intricacies of these services,” said Thomas M. Siebel, Chairman and CEO, C3 AI. “Government programs and services make the most impact when those who need them can smoothly use them. This product offers an intuitive, intelligent interface that provides trustworthy information about programs like the Affordable Care Act, alleviating staff workload, accelerating information gathering, and transforming how the public can learn about and use critical services.”\n\nC3 Generative AI is an AI application designed with an intuitive natural language search and chat interface, allowing users of all levels to easily and quickly find information with high precision, perform data analysis, and discover insights. This application offers robust enterprise-level security, access controls, and full traceability.\n\nWith C3 Generative AI for Government Programs, users — including government workers, residents, or anyone looking to understand federal, state, or local programs — can get trustworthy answers with complete citations to sources and websites. The application understands nuances of various programs and provides clear, step-by-step instructions if applicable, and supports queries and responses in 130+ languages.\n\nFor example, a user could ask, “What are the enrollment steps for the Affordable Care Act?” and C3 Generative AI for Government Programs will provide a response that clearly details each step a potential enrollee would need to take to apply for and secure an ACA-compliant health insurance plan. Going further, the user could ask follow-up questions including, “What is a special enrollment period?”, “What qualifies me for a special enrollment period?”, and “Does changing jobs qualify me for a special enrollment period?”; in a few minutes, a user can find out how and when to enroll in state health insurance coverage, including any special circumstances they need to consider during the process.\n\nRunning on Google Cloud, C3 Generative AI for Government Programs can withstand large inquiry volume and deliver an exceptional customer service experience. Users benefit from secure, high-performance cloud infrastructure and Google Cloud’s most advanced family of language models, Gemini. These models deliver very accurate and relevant responses through features including large context windows, multi-modal capabilities, and particularly strong reasoning capabilities. C3 Generative AI then packages this strong foundation into an enterprise-grade AI application that eliminates hallucination, provides high precision responses, maintains source traceability, and meets strict security requirements.\n\n“Partnering with Google Cloud enables C3 AI to deliver innovative generative AI applications spanning multiple industries, with the security and privacy controls required by the most demanding of customers,” said Kevin Ichhpurani, Corporate Vice President, Global Ecosystem and Channels at Google Cloud. “These latest applications from C3 AI help support public sector agencies as they harness the power of AI to better serve citizens, including helping people get trusted information on government programs more quickly.”"
