Drawing from proven research and a legacy of innovation, we deliver the best possible outcomes—advancing the recovery of thousands of patients and families every year. Gateway Treatment Centers provides:\n\nAcceptance and Commitment (ACT)\n\nACT is a form of mindfulness that is beneficial in helping change behaviors and assisting with commitment to positive action.\n\nLearn More\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\n\nCBT, a well-established practice is interwoven with other evidence-based practices. It focuses on changing destructive or unhealthy behavior patterns.\n\nLearn More\n\nDialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)\n\nDBT is a skill-based approach to learning effective coping strategies that can be used to address and change unhealthy behaviors.\n\nLearn More\n\nDual Diagnosis Treatment\n\nDual Diagnosis is the treatment of patients who have both a substance use disorder and a mental health diagnosis such as anxiety or depression.\n\nLearn More\n\nMedication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)\n\nMAT is using FDA-Approved medications such as Suboxone and Vivitrol to help manage withdrawal symptoms and cravings associated with substance use disorders.\n\nLearn More\n\nMindfulness-Based Sobriety\n\nDeveloped at Gateway, Mindfulness-Based Sobriety is an integrated approach to substance use disorder treatment that focuses on helping patients build the skills to be more present and ultimately create positive change.\n\nLearn More\n\nMotivational Interviewing (MI)\n\nMI helps patients recognize the need for change and how to move past the physical, psychological and social reasons for substance use. This practice keeps patients accountable to their treatment and recovery.\n\nLearn More\n\nSeeking Safety\n\nThis coping skills therapy is specifically designed for survivors of trauma with substance use disorders. By learning to cope in the present instead of focusing on trauma of the past, survivors of trauma can heal and address substance use at the same time.\n\nLearn More\n\n12-Step Facilitation\n\n12-step facilitation introduces patients to the 12-step framework using therapists instead of the 12-step community. Patients are encouraged to link to an ongoing support network such as AA, NA or SMART Recovery in their own community for long-term support.\n\nLearn More\n\nLasting recovery takes more than hope. It takes science. It takes Addiction Medicine.\n\nAddiction is a disease—and lives are at stake. At Gateway, Addiction Medicine is a holistic approach that uses evidence-based practices.
