        "text": "The main types of foundation repair are crack repair, leak repair, underpinning, stabilization, and waterproofing.\n\nCrack repair and leak repair are exactly as they sound: your foundation repair expert will perform an inspection and complete any repairs necessary to remedy cracks or leaks. Costs will vary depending on the size and cause of the problem.\n\nUnderpinning, also called piering or leveling, is when a contractor levels your foundation by underpinning it with large concrete piers. The amount you can expect to spend depends on how many piers are required. The price of stabilization varies similarly. This process fixes bowing walls by reinforcing them with steel or carbon fiber strips, and the total cost will depend on the material chosen and how many strips are used.\n\nFinally, waterproofing is an overarching term for a number of jobs designed to stop water from getting into your foundation or basement. This can involve exterior waterproofing, interior waterproofing, or both, and costs can vary greatly. We recommend contacting a waterproofing specialist if you're planning to waterproof your foundation.\n\nWhen caring for your foundation, you should make sure that it has the proper level of moisture. Belleville sees more rain than many places, so be sure that your gutters and landscaping are arranged to prevent too much water from collecting near your foundation. Also make sure that you quickly identify and repair any leaking gutters or pipes.\n\nIf you have any concerns about your foundation, you can call a structural engineer for an evaluation. This will run you a few hundred dollars, but the consultation can net you a list of things to look out for as well as additional steps to further protect your foundation. Lastly, if you're building a new house, ensure to have a soil report done. This can provide information about how well the soil on your property can support a foundation, and can highlight potential future issues."
