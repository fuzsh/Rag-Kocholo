This is such a lonely and devastating position to be in – to forego non-elective treatment, or, in some cases, to euthanize. We started the Farley Foundation because we believe there must be a third option: to get help. Thanks to our generous donors, pets are getting the care they need and their owners receive a gift more precious than words.\n\nThese acts of kindness have raised more than $7 million to help over 16,000 pets since 2002."
