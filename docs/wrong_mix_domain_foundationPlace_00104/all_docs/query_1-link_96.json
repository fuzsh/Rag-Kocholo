        "text": "In the heart of Illinois, a revolution is underway. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) has established itself as a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI), driving transformative advancements across industries and paving the way for a future where AI redefines what is possible. From groundbreaking research initiatives to pivotal partnerships with industry giants, the university's commitment to AI innovation is reshaping the landscape of technology and education.\n\nIt was no coincidence that Arthur C. Clarke chose Urbana, Illinois, as the birthplace of HAL, the infamous fictional AI from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Back then, the University of Illinois (U of I) was becoming a powerhouse in the fields of technology HAL represents. Today, the U of I's Grainger College of Engineering and its brand-new Siebel School of Computing and Data Science constitute a world-leading hub of AI innovation beyond anything Clarke could have imagined. Since 2019, the university has conducted over $270 million of AI-related research projects, spurring advancements in agriculture, biotechnology, education, and other fields while equipping the next generation of inclusive experts with hands-on experience.\n\nIllinois’ top-10 engineering college has a rich history of producing alumni, faculty, and student entrepreneurs shaping the commercial AI landscape. One alum, C3.ai CEO Tom Siebel, recently donated $50 million to transform the Department of Computer Science into the new Siebel School of Computing and Data Science to further AI research and education at U of I.\n\nC3.ai Digital Transformation Institute\n\nC3.ai also supports the C3.ai Digital Transformation Institute (C3.ai DTI), a collaboration between Siebel's C3.ai, the University of Illinois, the University of California, Berkeley, and Microsoft, which aims to accelerate the application of AI to enhance digital transformation in business, government, and society. The institute launched after the pandemic began and was instrumental in solving major medical, policy, and urban planning challenges concerning COVID-19. C3.ai DTI has also contributed to solving ongoing issues of energy and climate security and advancing AI subdisciplines.\n\nIBM-Illinois Discovery Accelerator Institute\n\nComputing giant IBM recently committed $100 million to launch the IBM-Illinois Discovery Accelerator Institute. Its mission is to employ AI and augmented human intelligence, among other critical areas such as quantum technologies, to create tomorrow's hybrid cloud – specifically, expanding the potential of edge computing and cloud security capabilities across public and private clouds. IBM is currently led by U of I graduate Dr. Arvind Krishna.\n\n\"Grainger Engineering's size and excellence propels innovation,\" says Grainger Engineering Dean Rashid Bashir. \"Few other higher education institutions offer the preeminence and scale – there are hundreds of researchers working in AI-related areas– their research spans everything from the theoretical foundations of AI to new applications – of this Midwestern jewel.\"\n\n\"We have all the ingredients needed to transform society through generative AI in all domains,\" Bashir said. \"With our new Siebel School of Computing and Data Science, we will be able to bring discipline-specific expertise to bear on technology transfers in numerous fields that demand more intelligence in order to progress.\"\n\n\"We have a longstanding history of translating research into applications that have shaped our nation's culture and economy,\" said Nancy Amato, who will lead the new Siebel School of Computing and Data Science housed within Grainger Engineering. \"We also are a place where industry comes to do cutting-edge research. We are the bridge between foundational research and corporate breakthroughs.\"\n\nMultiple AI Institutes\n\nWhile AI transverses all disciplines, not only within engineering but across the U of I campus, its advancement is at the center of three Illinois-led AI institutes funded by the National Science Foundation.\n\nAIFARMS (AI+Agriculture)\n\nGlobal agricultural systems face enormous challenges in the coming years that could impact the reliability and sustainability of food supply chains. The industry is projected to spend $4.7 billion by 2028 on AI investments to address these challenges. Artificial Intelligence for Future Agricultural Resilience, Management, and Sustainability (AIFARMS) is a $20 million initiative that leverages AI to improve efficiency and solve problems within farming.\n\nThe researchers in the effort's core areas – including computer vision, machine learning, data science, soft object manipulation, and intuitive human–robot interaction – are working to create more productive and sustainable agriculture without increased labor, improve livestock operations with AI, and develop strategies to enhance crop resilience.\n\nMolecule Maker Maker Lab Institute (AI+Chemical Synthesis)\n\nThe Molecule Maker Lab Institute (MMLI) is pushing the boundaries of science, fostering innovation, and accelerating the discovery of new molecules and materials. The institute's AI-driven advancements are essential in accelerating drug discovery, creating more sustainable pesticides and other chemicals for agriculture, and designing new materials for various applications, such as biodegradable plastics and other eco-friendly materials.\n\nIn the short four years since the $20 million institute launched, the MMLI has made numerous breakthroughs, including developing the AlphaSynthesis platform, which offers a suite of AI-guided tools for synthesis planning, catalyst discovery, process optimization, and closed-loop discovery science. The platform allows researchers to access click-and-go tools with a user-friendly interface, integrating knowledge from publicly available databases and publications.\n\nINVITE (AI+Education)\n\nAs Grainger Engineering was the launchpad of PLATO, the first computer-assisted educational platform, it makes sense that it works with educators today to push the next generation of AI-fueled teaching technologies. The Inclusive Intelligent Technologies for Education Institute (INVITE) has a mission to fundamentally transform how AI-based educational technologies interact with learners, especially those students who historically have been marginalized in STEM education.\n\nINVITE aims to transform K-12 STEM education by developing AI-enabled learning technologies that support and understand learners in more nuanced ways. These new approaches will support learners as they persist through difficult material and collaborate with others, thus helping prepare them for successful careers in a rapidly changing technological landscape.\n\nAI Entrepreneurs\n\nMany faculty members apply their research in the development of commercial tools. Two new startups have emerged that are making an impact on the fields of medicine and construction:\n\nReconstruct: Machine learning fuels this startup, which develops aerial robots to monitor construction sites. Civil engineering professor Mani Golparvar helped launch Reconstruct, which uses AI tools—like reality mapping and 4D scheduling—to analyze construction data and provide insights for progress monitoring, quality control, and facilities assessment.\n\nPrenosis: This growing startup, which recently received the FDA's first-ever approval of an AI diagnostic tool for sepsis, uses AI to tailor health care to an individual's biology. Prenosis, started by Bashir and one of his students, applies a data-driven approach to fast-paced acute care environments, ushering in a new era of precision medicine.\n\nAlums have blazed a path for these startups to continue revolutionizing the commercial landscape for computing and digital transformation. In addition to Siebel and Krishna, U of I alums include:\n\nSteve Chen and Jawed Karim, co-founders of YouTube\n\nMarc Andreessen and Eric Bina, who wrote the first graphical web browser and co-founded Netscape\n\nMartin Eberhard, co-founder of Tesla\n\nRussell Simmons and Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founders of Yelp\n\nMax Levchin, Luke Nosek, and Yu Pan, co-founders of PayPal\n\nJerry Sanders III, co-founder of Advanced Micro Devices\n\nWhile these and many other alums are changing the world, they also ensure that AI is used responsibly and ethically. For example, UIUC's Center for Just Infrastructures seeks to create equity in everyday systems infrastructures. U of I faculty are members of the U.S. AI Safety Institute Consortium (AISIC), a Dept. of Commerce initiative that supports developing and deploying safe and trustworthy AI. The college is also part of the AI Alliance, a collaboration between leading technology developers such as IBM and Meta, healthcare entities like the Cleveland Clinic, and other notable higher education institutions to promote open, responsible AI innovation.\n\nAs we stand on the precipice of an AI-driven future, the University of Illinois is a lighthouse, guiding advancements that will reshape our world. The Midwest's AI powerhouse is not just a regional leader but a global influencer, shaping the trajectory of AI innovation for years to come."
