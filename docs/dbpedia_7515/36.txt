Students at Steenrod Elementary will be able to take advantage of a new playground when the weather gets warmer.

The school received grant money toward the project, which was matched by the board of education at last Monday night’s meeting.

It will include a mud kitchen, water table, and a trampoline. Officials say it will have much more use than just an area to play.

"There's so many studies, brain-based research into play and the importance of it in a child's development," Principal Michelle Dietrich said.

"We use it as an outdoor classroom,” Pre-K teacher Beth Wallace said. “We do experiments out there, and they do a lot of cause and effect things to figure out how things work. It also promotes a sense of cooperation and teamwork."

The playground should be up and running fully when the weather warms.
