        "text": "Interviewed by Max Lieblich and Lauren Williams of the Harvard Math Club in 99/00.\n\nQ: I guess the most basic question is, what got you interested in mathematics?\n\nA: I was initially interested in electronics -- Maxwell's equations. When I was in high school I had a friend who was quite a whiz as a Ham radio operator. He would build electronic things and I would try to understand why they worked. The thing I was baffled by, and kept trying to understand, was how energy got transmitted.\n\nAfter high school I went to MIT with the idea of studying electronic engineering. But the first day at MIT I went to the library -- and was surprised that there were so many books on mathematics: I was surprised to find that math was actually a subject. I had thought of math as a tool, and I had intended to learn it to prepare myself to study electromagnetism. That first day while browsing through the shelves I realized that mathematics and not engineering was really what I wanted to do.\n\nQ: How much exposure had you had to math before MIT?\n\nA: I went to the Bronx High School of Science, which was then, as apparently it still is now, very very good. It had at that time a number of excellent math teachers: the father of the Lepowsky brothers taught there; and also Lhavaty, a fine mathematician. I profited very much from the general atmosphere there even though I didn't take any of the advanced math courses offered in High School. It was not, at the time, standard for everyone there to take Calculus.\n\nInstead I tried to learn calculus on my own, from this wonderful book that was either called \"Calculus Made Simple\" or \"Calculus Made Easy,\" I have forgotten which, by Thompson. This text had at least two great virtues. It was very thin, and it proudly proclaimed (on its opening pages) that it was about to \"save\" Calculus from the obscurity into which it had been cast by the mathematicians. I have no idea what I would think of this book if I saw it now, but at least, for me, then, it conveyed the awe of calculus -- with no rigor at all -- and by golly, its title was correct.\n\nI was also an avid reader of electronics books, and I picked up a certain amount of calculus just by reading them; and finally I went through a text by Kell which taught a version of Calculus directed to applications to aeronautical engineering; Kell's Calculus had a huge number of (rote, for the most part) exercises at the end of each chapter: I obsessively did every one of the problems in that book.\n\nQ: Did you meet any strong mentors or influences at MIT?\n\nA: Oh yes. I was at MIT for two years -- I decided to go through it very fast, partly because my father had taken out loans and I thought I would save him some money. Also I was excited about the subject. Very early on, one of the professors attached me to a graduate student named Gus Solomon who helped me enormously. Solomon was a student of Iwasawa at the time, studying number theory, but later turned his hand to applied mathematics and had an extremely distinguished career in industry. Gus Solomon would oversee my mathematical reading, answer questions, correct any of the exercises that I wrote out and gave to him. And generally he would give good advice. That was great.\n\nAnd then there was Warren Ambrose, a professor at MIT, who did research in functional analysis, but when I was at MIT he seemed particularly interested in algebraic topology -- and more specifically was very enthousiastic about the things that were going on in the Cartan seminar in Paris. Ambrose taught a graduate course in algebraic topology which I took (I had much help from Gus Solomon ). I suspect that Ambrose didn't know all that much algebraic topology at the time, but that fact somehow contributed to the greatness of the course he gave. For Ambrose, intuition was primary, and he would hold back on formal definitions long after anyone else would normally have presented them.\n\nFor example, he would say \"OK, consider the group of chains on a topological space\" and then he would write on the board\n\n'a chain is a formal sum of pieces of space'\n\nOnly after having written this, would he begin to define the various formal variants of \"pieces of space\" (i.e., simplex, or singular simplex, etc. -- he also liked cubical chains). There would be an engaging mystery at the beginning of any of his explanations: a mystery that, so to speak, charged up the imaginative faculties, and made one ready, eager, for the eventual formalization. I was inspired by his classes.\n\nAnd there was Kenkichi Iwasawa. Iwasawa was just the opposite of Ambrose, formal at every level. He would enter the room writing on the blackboard -- no informal interaction at all! Everything was presented absolutely perfectly: clean, clear, with wonderfully thought out notation. His problems were gems. There weren't very many of them, and they would often be thorny -- they would usually take a couple of weeks to figure out -- but they would really open up the subject for anyone who worked them through to the end.\n\nQ: So after two years at MIT you went to Princeton?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: How old were you at the time?\n\nA: Well, I went to MIT when I was 16, so I guess I was 18. At Princeton I intended to study algebraic topology (having been so motivated by Ambrose's course). But almost as soon as I got there I found myself attracted to more geometric problems.\n\nNorman Steenrod was my adviser at first. Steenrod reminded me of Rodin's thinker (not in physique, but rather in the way in which he revelled in slow reflection). He made it clear that quickness was not essential to doing good mathematics; the important problems in mathematics, or at least the ones he valued, required having an appropriate view of the whole, and such overviews are gotten only after considerable experience, and long deliberation. Some of the most instructive moments to me in my first weeks in Princeton came from watching Steenrod, in his course, slowly ruminate (out loud) about the real meaning of \"cohomology operation\" and, with equal intensity, ponder the signficance of a sign in a formula. I very much liked it.\n\nSteenrod also gave a lecture to incoming graduate students in which he said two things. He said : \"In your undergraduate studies the mathematics that you have read has been primarily in textbooks. But now you are ready to read original articles -- articles are living mathematics, and textbooks are dead mathematics. You should read original articles, even if they're harder and not so well written.\" The other thing he said was quite important to me: he said that there was a natural tempo to \"mathematical maturity\": certain mathematical ideas take a certain amount of time to digest -- they deserve a certain amount of time -- and trying to rush this process is disrespectful of the ideas and might lead to a less full comprehension of them. So I took Steenrod's classes.\n\nThe other graduate students in Princeton at the time were terrific. We gave seminars every night -- on wild topics, whatever occurred to us. The graduate students I spent most time with were Jim Stasheff, John Stallings and Han Sah. We would go through various books together (books and not, in fact, articles, as Steenrod would have us do). For example, we read through Chevalley's books on algebraic functions of one variable, and on algebraic Lie groups. We also took delighted in finding strange \"examples\" -- the stranger to us, the better. These \"examples\" we cooked up were mainly in algebraic topology (e.g., CW-spaces equipped with various algebraic structures, given up to homotopy), but also in geometry, and pointset topology. In January, Steenrod suggested that I work on the differential geometry of manifolds with a Lorentz-type metric on their tangent bundles -- a space-time metric; it was a kind of open-ended problem. I thought a bit about this problem but got nowhere with it. At the end of the year I said that I wanted to go to Paris. Steenrod warned me that he thought I would not get anything done in Paris, and was strongly against my going. But I did.\n\nQ: What were you planning to do in Paris?\n\nA: I was going primarily to... spend a year in Paris with my high school girlfriend. My claim was that I wanted to go to the Cartan seminar. I did, in fact, attend the Cartan seminar, but I don't think I spoke to any of the mathematicians there. I got it into my head that I would try to prove the Poincar&eacute conjecture and to learn a little geometric topology on the side. But I didn't (prove the Poincar&eacute conjecture). In the course of cogitating about the Poincar&eacute conjecture, though, I happened on a result which I thought of as being \"in the right direction\" and which I called \"Lemma 1\". When I got back to Princeton I learned that my \"Lemma 1\" had been conjectured by the mathematician Schoenflies, and was until then an open problem, so I submitted it as my Ph.D. thesis.\n\nQ: So essentially you wrote your thesis in Paris?\n\nA: Right. From then on I regarded Paris as a lucky place for me to do mathematics, and for a number of years I spent every other Spring term there. I liked the atmosphere -- it's a wonderful place to do mathematics if you're not locked into the system -- e.g., if you're not teaching.\n\nQ: At some point you underwent a shift and changed from algebraic topology to number theory... could you tell us about that?\n\nA: I did some work in dynamical systems with Mike Artin. To do this we used the theory of John Nash (about components of the real locus of real algebraic varieties), so there was a fair amount of algebraic geometry in what we did. I then became interested in the algebraic side of things. And then the two of us (Mike Artin and I) worked on an algebraic geometric version of homotopy theory, which is, of course, still algebraic topology, but in the setting of algebraic geometry. This led naturally to my spending a number of years doing algebraic geometry.\n\nQ: So when did you come to Harvard?\n\nA: When I came back from Paris I spent a year as a visitor to the Institute for Advanced Study, and then the following year came to Harvard as a Junior Fellow. I've been here ever since.\n\nQ: What kind of changes have you seen at Harvard?\n\nA: It's gotten better. When I first arrived the students were mainly from quite restricted backgrounds. Not that there weren't people from all economic backgrounds, but there still was something of a \"Harvard mold\".\n\nQ: How does Harvard back then compare to what MIT was?\n\nA: In my opinion MIT just hasn't changed. MIT was then as it is now: intense. And I love that. But Harvard was -- well, in the early 60's the level of intellectual energy that was ever-present at MIT was not as evident in the Harvard student body: \"gentleman C's\" were rampant.\n\nQ: What about the math department?\n\nA: The math department was a lot stuffier.\n\nQ: What about the Princeton department back then?\n\nA: The Princeton people then were much more thoroughly engaged in research, partly to the detriment of their teaching. Not that there aren't great teachers there, but there was a distinct gap between the undergraduate and graduate courses (an almost unbridgable gap, as it seemed to me when I was a graduate student there). Princeton had lots of undergraduate courses, and then only \"topics\" graduate courses. That might be an exaggeration, but there were very few beginning graduate courses. At Harvard, there was always more interest in shaping the curriculum so that a student has a better chance of following courses that form some coherent continuous program of study.\n\nQ: What has been the most exciting aspect of your career?\n\nA: That's hard to say. Math is continually exciting -- you have no idea how things will change from one day to the next.\n\nQ: Do you see any trends in math that you think will prevail in the 21st century, or do you have any idea where math is going?\n\nA: I don't. In the 60's, there was a period when abstract mathematical machines were being developed in all directions -- sheaves, and cohomology theories -- there was a general trend towards abstraction, to the mild neglect of thoroughly concrete issues. I'm very happy that now, wherever you look in mathematics, people are riveted on concrete, precise problems. I'm also happy that there now seems to be more such concrete problems, which are both interesting, important, and possibly accessible, than ever. As for large developments I would expect that string theory will take decades to give all its fruits, and that it is a tree that will bear much fruit. And I would expect that the amazing level of progress in so many aspects of number theory that we have seen in recent years will keep up. But I don't really want to guess about the future of mathematics. Mathematics constantly surprises us.\n\nQ: Do you do many things outside of math? You're teaching a non-mathematical course, right? How did you get interested in that?\n\nA: Some years ago a friend of mine gave me some essays about the imagination in literature (they were about how you imagine what you read). I became interested in how the ideas in those essays could be modified to talk about how you imagine a mathematical idea. I wrote my friend a letter about this, which I kept revising. My letter got longer and longer and when it got to about 160 pages, my friend figured that he'd better do something to stop its Rabelaisian growth, and so he invited me to help teach a graduate seminar with him.\n\nQ: What other things do you do?\n\nA: Well, I don't do mathematics 24 hours a day -- or on second thought, perhaps I do -- but there's also some time-sharing.\n\nQ: Do you dream about mathematics?\n\nA: I certainly daydream. Usually, in a somnolent state, I find that mathematical ideas jiggle around, and sometimes settle in more commodious ways in my head. But no, I haven't had any of those benzene-ringed dreams.\n\nQ: Could you tell us about the Steele prize which you were recently awarded?\n\nA: The prize is given for a paper that is judged to be \"seminal.\" The Steele Prize Committee gave it to me for a paper I wrote in the seventies called \"Modular Curves and the Eisenstein Ideal.\"\n\nQ: Could you tell us about it?\n\nA: Maybe it would be easiest to describe one of the consequences. There's a theorem of Mordell that says the group of rational points on an elliptic curve is finitely generated. Now any finitely generated abelian group is isomorphic to a product of a finite number of copies of the additive group of integers, and a finite (abelian) group. So the question is, what finite groups can occur (as the torsion subgroups of the group of rational points on an elliptic curve)? I gave a complete classification of these groups in my paper.\n\nDisclaimer: This html file is reproduced from the one here with minor typographical changes."
