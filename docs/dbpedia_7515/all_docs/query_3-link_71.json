        "text": "The Archives of American Mathematics (AAM) consists of both personal papers and the records of mathematical organizations from the twentieth century. Major strengths of the AAM are in topology, mathematics education, analysis, number theory, logic, and the mathematical foundations of physics.\n\nIn addition to offering resources for studying the role of mathematics and mathematicians in America over the last century, the Archives also offers resources for the historical study of mathematics education.\n\nThe Mathematical Association of America Records, for example, reflect the organization’s active role in college mathematics education, while the School Mathematics Study Group Records document the influential “New Math” primary and secondary curriculum of the 1960s.\n\nClass notes on University of Texas courses from the 1920s and notes on several Harvard University courses from 1910 to 1913, such as courses by G. D. Birkhoff, M. Bôcher, J. L. Coolidge, and W. F. Osgood are present.\n\nOral histories offer another rich source for study. The R. L. Moore Legacy Collection includes over one hundred interviews with Moore’s students and colleagues recounting personal experiences with him and the Moore Method of teaching. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Oral History Project Records consist of interviews since 2002 of leaders in mathematics education.\n\nBack to top\n\nMax Dehn Papers, 1899-1979\n\nThe collection documents the career of Max Dehn (1878-1952), relating chiefly to his research in geometry, topology, group theory, and the history of mathematics at Frankfurt University and Black Mountain College, North Carolina.
