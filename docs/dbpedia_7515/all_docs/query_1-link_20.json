        "text": "You do not make explicit which definition of Čech cohomology you are using. I guess it is the \"classic\" one based on nerves of open coverings. Here are two references giving proofs of the homotopy invariance of Čech cohomology:\n\nThe timeless classic from 1952\n\nEilenberg, Samuel, and Norman Steenrod. Foundations of algebraic topology. Vol. 2193. Princeton University Press, 2015.\n\nHave a look at Chapter IX \"The Čech homology theory\":\n\nIn this chapter the Cech homology and cohomology theories are defined and the axioms for such are verified.\n\nThe homotopy axiom is stated as Theorem IX 5.1.\n\nAnother classic from 1967\n\nSpanier, Edwin H. Algebraic topology. Springer Science & Business Media, 1989.\n\nHave a look at Chapter 6 \"General cohomology theory and duality\".\n\nIn section 4 the Alexander cohomolgy theory is introduced and the homotopoy axiom for Alexander theory is proved in section 5 (Theorem 6). In section 7 Čech cohomology theory is introduced (with coefficients in a presheaf; the constant presheaf gives coefficients in a module $G$). Spanier does not verify the axioms directly from the definition, but proves that Čech cohomology and Alexander cohomology agree for paracompact spaces (see section 8 Corollary 8). In particular, this proves the homotopy invariance of Čech cohomology."
