        "text": "Let (V, 0) be a germ of a complete intersection variety in C n+k, n&gt; 0, having an isolated singularity at 0 and X be the germ of a holomorphic vector field on C n+k tangent to V and having on V an isolated zero at 0. We show that in this case the homological index and the GSV-index coincide. In the case when the zero of X is also isolated in the ambient space C n+k we give a formula for the homological index in terms of local linear algebra.\n\nThese are the notes for the talk Splittings, comfortably embedded subvarieties and index theorems I gave at the RIMS Symposium on Topological and geometrical methods of complex differential equations in Kyoto, 19-23 January 2004. I wish to sincerely thank prof. Shishikura and prof. Ito for the invitation. These notes contain some well known facts (maybe with a new interpretation) and statements of new results which will be proved in a forthcoming paper. 1. WHAT IS AN INDEX THEOREM? Let X be a n-dimensional complex variety and let ϕ ∈ H•(X) be a (nonzero) element of its cohomology. Often it is not possible to “calculate ” such an element directly. It is then important when one can calculate such element using tools like differential geometry or complex analysis. For instance the Chern classes of a vector bundle on X can be calculated using the Chern-Weil theory of connections, provided X is nonsingular. In applications however it is important to know the image of P (ϕ) ∈ H2n− • where...\n\nwhere z = z1 1 · · · z νn n for ν = (ν1, . . . , νn) (respectively z̄ μ = z̄1 1 · · · z̄ μn n for μ = (μ1, . . . , μn)) as usual. Here z̄j is the complex conjugate of zj. We call f(z, z̄) a mixed analytic function (or a mixed polynomial, if f(z, z̄) is a polynomial) of z1, . . . , zn. We are interested in the topology of the hypersurface V = {z ∈ C | f(z, z̄) = 0}, which we call a mixed hypersurface. This approach is equivalent to the original one."
