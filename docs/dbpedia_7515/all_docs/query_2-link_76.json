The type system accounts for the linear-algebraic aspects of this extension of $\\\\lambda$-calculus: it is able to statically describe the linear combinations of terms that will be obtained when reducing the programs.

Our construction extends the linear typed lambda calculus with a linear negation of \"trivialised\" De Morgan duality. Reduction is realised through explicit substitution, based on a symmetric notion of binding of global scope, with rules acting on the entire typing judgement instead of on a specific subterm. Proofs of subject reduction, confluence, strong normalisation and consistency are provided, and the language is shown to be an internal language for dagger compact categories.\n\nProgramming Language Concepts - The Lambda Calculus Approach\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nFokkinga, M.M.; Asveld, P.R.J.; Nijholt, Antinus\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe Lambda Calculus is a formal system, originally intended as a tool in the foundation of mathematics, but mainly used to study the concepts of algorithm and effective computability. Recently, the Lambda Calculus and related systems acquire attention from Computer Science for another reason too:\n\nExtending the Extensional Lambda Calculus with Surjective Pairing is Conservative\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nStÃ¸vring, Kristian\n\n2006-01-01\n\nWe answer Klop and de Vrijer's question whether adding surjective-pairing axioms to the extensional lambda calculus yields a conservative extension. The answer is positive. As a byproduct we obtain a \"syntactic\" proof that the extensional lambda calculus with surjective pairing is consistent....\n\nUnification and matching in Church's Original Lambda Calculus\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nHustadt, U.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nIn current implementations of higher-order logics higher-orderunification is used to lift the resolution principle from the first-order case to the higher-order case. Higher-order matching is the core of implementations of higher-order rewriting systems and some systems for program transformation. In this paper I argue that Church's original lambda calculus, called non-forgetful lambda calculus, is an appropriate basis for higher-order matching. I provide two correct and complete algorithms f...\n\nA Step-indexed Semantic Model of Types for the Call-by-Name Lambda Calculus\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMeurer, Benedikt\n\n2011-01-01\n\nStep-indexed semantic models of types were proposed as an alternative to purely syntactic safety proofs using subject-reduction. Building upon the work by Appel and others, we introduce a generalized step-indexed model for the call-by-name lambda calculus. We also show how to prove type safety of general recursion in our call-by-name model.\n\nA fully-abstract semantics of lambda-mu in the pi-calculus\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSteffen van Bakel\n\n2014-09-01\n\nFull Text Available We study the lambda-mu-calculus, extended with explicit substitution, and define a compositional output-based interpretation into a variant of the pi-calculus with pairing that preserves single-step explicit head reduction with respect to weak bisimilarity. We define four notions of weak equivalence for lambda-mu â one based on weak reduction, two modelling weak head-reduction and weak explicit head reduction (all considering terms without weak head-normal form equivalent as well, and one based on weak approximation â and show they all coincide. We will then show full abstraction results for our interpretation for the weak equivalences with respect to weak bisimilarity on processes.\n\nContinuation calculus\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nGeron, B.; Geuvers, J.H.; de'Liguoro, U.; Saurin, A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nPrograms with control are usually modeled using lambda calculus extended with control operators. Instead of modifying lambda calculus, we consider a different model of computation. We introduce continuation calculus, or CC, a deterministic model of computation that is evaluated using only head\n\nThird-Order Matching in the Polymorphic Lambda Calculus\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nSpringintveld, J.\n\nWe show that it is decidable whether a third-order matching problem in the polymorphic lambda calculus has a solution. The proof is constructive in the sense that an algorithm can be extracted from it that, given such a problem, returns a substitution if it has a solution and fail otherwise.\n\nMaximal Sharing in the Lambda Calculus with Letrec\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nGrabmayer, C.A.; Rochel, J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIncreasing sharing in programs is desirable to compactify the code, and to avoid duplication of reduction work at run-time, thereby speeding up execution. We show how a maximal degree of sharing can be obtained for programs expressed as terms in the lambda calculus with letrec. We introduce a notion\n\nA Type System for the Vectorial Aspect of the Linear-Algebraic Lambda-Calculus\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPablo Arrighi\n\n2012-07-01\n\nFull Text Available We describe a type system for the linear-algebraic lambda-calculus. The type system accounts for the part of the language emulating linear operators and vectors, i.e. it is able to statically describe the linear combinations of terms resulting from the reduction of programs. This gives rise to an original type theory where types, in the same way as terms, can be superposed into linear combinations. We show that the resulting typed lambda-calculus is strongly normalizing and features a weak subject-reduction.\n\nRelational Reasoning for Markov Chains in a Probabilistic Guarded Lambda Calculus\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nAguirre, Alejandro; Barthe, Gilles; Birkedal, Lars\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe extend the simply-typed guarded $\\\\lambda$-calculus with discrete probabilities and endow it with a program logic for reasoning about relational properties of guarded probabilistic computations.

Instead of modifying lambda calculus, we consider a different model of computation. We introduce continuation calculus, or CC, a deterministic model of computation that is evaluated using only head reduction, and argue that it is suitable for modeling programs with control. It is demonstrated how to define programs, specify them, and prove them correct. This is shown in detail by presenting in CC a list multiplication program that prematurely returns when it encounters a zero. The correctness proof includes termination of the program. In continuation calculus we can model both call-by-name and call-by-value. In addition, call-by-name functions can be applied to call-by-value results, and conversely.\n\nElementary affine $lambda$-calculus with multithreading and side effects\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMadet, Antoine; Amadio, Roberto M.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nLinear logic provides a framework to control the complexity of higher-order functional programs. We present an extension of this framework to programs with multithreading and side effects focusing on the case of elementary time. Our main contributions are as follows. First, we provide a new combinatorial proof of termination in elementary time for the functional case. Second, we develop an extension of the approach to a call-by-value $lambda$-calculus with multithreading and side effects. Thi...\n\nA General Schema for Constructing One-Point Bases in the Lambda Calculus\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nGoldberg, Mayer\n\n2001-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we present a schema for constructing one-point bases for recursively enumerable sets of lambda terms. The novelty of the approach is that we make no assumptions about the terms for which the one-point basis is constructed: They need not be combinators and they may contain constants...... and free variables. The significance of the construction is twofold: In the context of the lambda calculus, it characterises one-point bases as ways of ``packaging'' sets of terms into a single term; And in the context of realistic programming languages, it implies that we can define a single procedure...\n\nVerified Representations of Landau's \"Grundlagen\" in the lambda-delta Family and in the Calculus of Constructions\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFerruccio Guidi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Landau's \"Grundlagen der Analysis\" formalized in the language Aut-QE, represents an early milestone in computer-checked mathematics and is the only non-trivial development finalized in the languages of the Automath family. Here we discuss an implemented procedure producing a faithful representation of the Grundlagen in the Calculus of Constructions, verified by the proof assistant Coq 8.4.3. The point at issue is distinguishing lambda-abstractions from pi-abstractions where the original text uses Automath unified binders, taking care of the cases in which a binder corresponds to both abstractions at one time. It is a fact that some binders can be disambiguated only by verifying the Grundlagen in a calculus accepting Aut-QE and the Calculus of Constructions. To this end, we rely on lambda-delta version 3, a system that the author is proposing here for the first time.\n\nThe untyped stack calculus and Bohm's theorem\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlberto Carraro\n\n2013-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The stack calculus is a functional language in which is in a Curry-Howard correspondence with classical logic. It enjoys confluence but, as well as Parigot's lambda-mu, does not admit the Bohm Theorem, typical of the lambda-calculus. We present a simple extension of stack calculus which is for the stack calculus what Saurin's Lambda-mu is for lambda-mu.\n\nRelational Reasoning for Markov Chains in a Probabilistic Guarded Lambda Calculus\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nAguirre, Alejandro; Barthe, Gilles; Birkedal, Lars\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe extend the simply-typed guarded $\\\\lambda$-calculus with discrete probabilities and endow it with a program logic for reasoning about relational properties of guarded probabilistic computations. This provides a framework for programming and reasoning about infinite stochastic processes like Mar...... literature to justify better proof rules for relational reasoning about probabilistic expressions. We illustrate these benefits with a broad range of examples that were beyond the scope of previous systems, including shift couplings and lump couplings between random walks....\n\nA call-by-value lambda-calculus with lists and control\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRobbert Krebbers\n\n2012-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Calculi with control operators have been studied to reason about control in programming languages and to interpret the computational content of classical proofs. To make these calculi into a real programming language, one should also include data types. As a step into that direction, this paper defines a simply typed call-by-value lambda calculus with the control operators catch and throw, a data type of lists, and an operator for primitive recursion (a la Goedel's T. We prove that our system satisfies subject reduction, progress, confluence for untyped terms, and strong normalization for well-typed terms.\n\nStandardization and Confluence in Pure Lambda-Calculus Formalized for the Matita Theorem Prover\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFerruccio Guidi\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available We present a formalization of pure lambda-calculus for the Matita interactive theorem prover, including the proofs of two relevant results in reduction theory: the confluence theorem and the standardization theorem. The proof of the latter is based on a new approach recently introduced by Xi and refined by Kashima that, avoiding the notion of development and having a neat inductive structure, is particularly suited for formalization in theorem provers.\n\nA type system for continuation calculus\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nGeuvers, J.H.; Geraedts, W.; Geron, B.; Stegeren, van J.; Oliva, P.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nContinuation Calculus (CC), introduced by Geron and Geuvers, is a simple foundational model for functional computation. It is closely related to lambda calculus and term rewriting, but it has no variable binding and no pattern matching. It is Turing complete and evaluation is deterministic. Notions\n\nLabelled Lambda-calculi with Explicit Copy and Erase\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaribel FernÃ¡ndez\n\n2010-03-01\n\nFull Text Available We present two rewriting systems that define labelled explicit substitution lambda-calculi. Our work is motivated by the close correspondence between Levy's labelled lambda-calculus and paths in proof-nets, which played an important role in the understanding of the Geometry of Interaction. The structure of the labels in Levy's labelled lambda-calculus relates to the multiplicative information of paths; the novelty of our work is that we design labelled explicit substitution calculi that also keep track of exponential information present in call-by-value and call-by-name translations of the lambda-calculus into linear logic proof-nets.\n\nOn Undefined and Meaningless in Lambda Definability\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nde Vries, Fer-Jan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe distinguish between undefined terms as used in lambda definability of partial recursive functions and meaningless terms as used in infinite lambda calculus for the infinitary terms models that generalise the Bohm model. While there are uncountable many known sets of meaningless terms, there are four known sets of undefined terms. Two of these four are sets of meaningless terms. In this paper we first present set of sufficient conditions for a set of lambda terms to se...\n\nUnfolding Semantics of the Untyped Î»-Calculus with lectrec-Calculus with letrec\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nRochel, J.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe investigate the relationship between finite terms in lambda-letrec, the lambda calculus with letrec, and the infinite lambda terms they express. We say that a lambda-letrec term expresses a lambda term if the latter can be obtained as an infinite unfolding of the former. Unfolding is the process\n\nConfluence via strong normalisation in an algebraic Î»-calculus with rewriting\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPablo Buiras\n\n2012-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The linear-algebraic lambda-calculus and the algebraic lambda-calculus are untyped lambda-calculi extended with arbitrary linear combinations of terms. The former presents the axioms of linear algebra in the form of a rewrite system, while the latter uses equalities. When given by rewrites, algebraic lambda-calculi are not confluent unless further restrictions are added. We provide a type system for the linear-algebraic lambda-calculus enforcing strong normalisation, which gives back confluence. The type system allows an abstract interpretation in System F.\n\nA Formal Calculus for Categories\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nCÃ¡ccamo, Mario JosÃ©\n\nThis dissertation studies the logic underlying category theory. In particular we present a formal calculus for reasoning about universal properties. The aim is to systematise judgements about functoriality and naturality central to categorical reasoning. The calculus is based on a language which...... extends the typed lambda calculus with new binders to represent universal constructions. The types of the languages are interpreted as locally small categories and the expressions represent functors. The logic supports a syntactic treatment of universality and duality. Contravariance requires a definition...... of universality generous enough to deal with functors of mixed variance. Ends generalise limits to cover these kinds of functors and moreover provide the basis for a very convenient algebraic manipulation of expressions. The equational theory of the lambda calculus is extended with new rules for the definitions...\n\nShell-model predictions for Lambda Lambda hypernuclei\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGal, A.; Millener, D.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIt is shown how the recent shell-model determination of ÎN spin-dependent interaction terms in Î hypernuclei allows for a reliable deduction of ÎÎ separation energies in ÎÎ hypernuclei across the nuclear p shell. Comparison is made with the available data, highlighting # Lambda# # Lambda# 11 Be and # Lambda# # Lambda# 12 Be which have been suggested as possible candidates for the KEK-E373 HIDA event.\n\nThe use of typed lambda calculus for comprehension and construction of simulation models in the domain of ecology\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nUschold, Michael\n\n1992-01-01\n\nWe are concerned with two important issues in simulation modelling: model comprehension and model construction. Model comprehension is limited because many important choices taken during the modelling process are not documented. This makes it difficult for models to be modified or used by others. A key factor hindering model construction is the vast modelling search space which must be navigated. This is exacerbated by the fact that many modellers are unfamiliar with the terms and concepts catered to by current tools. The root of both problems is the lack of facilities for representing or reasoning about domain concepts in current simulation technology. The basis for our achievements in both of these areas is the development of a language with two distinct levels; one for representing domain information, and the other for representing the simulation model. Of equal importance, is the fact that we make formal connections between these two levels. The domain we are concerned with is ecological modelling. This language, called Elklogic, is based on the typed lambda calculus. Important features include a rich type structure, the use of various higher order functions, and semantics. This enables complex expressions to be constructed from relatively few primitives. The meaning of each expression can be determined in terms of the domain, the simulation model, or the relationship between the two. We describe a novel representation for sets and substructure, and a variety of other general concepts that are especially useful in the ecological domain. We use the type structure in a novel way: for controlling the modelling search space, rather than a proof search space. We facilitate model comprehension by representing modelling decisions that are embodied in the simulation model. We represent the simulation model separately from, but in terms of a domain mode. The explicit links between the two models constitute the modelling decisions. The semantics of Elklogic enables\n\n{lambda}{lambda} pairing in N{lambda} composite matter\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nTanigawa, Tomonori [Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Tokyo (Japan); Matsuzaki, Masayuki [Japan Atomic Energy Research Inst., Tokyo (Japan); Chiba, Satoshi [Fukuoka Univ. of Education, Dept. of Physics, Munakata, Fukuoka (Japan)\n\n2002-09-01\n\n{lambda}{lambda} pairing correlation in binary mixed matter of nucleons and lambdas is studied within the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model. {lambda} hyperons to be paired up are immersed in background nucleons in normal state. A phenomenological {lambda}{lambda} interaction, which is derived relativistically from the Lagrangian of the system, is adopted to the gap equation. It is found that increasing the nucleon density makes the {lambda}{lambda} pairing gap suppressed. This result suggests a mechanism, specific to relativistic models, of its dependence on the nucleon density.

Various ${\\\\Lambda\\\\Lambda}$ and $\\\\Lambda$-nucleus or ${\\\\Lambda N}$ potentials are used and the sensitivity of $\\\\Delta B_{\\\\Lambda\\\\Lambda}$ to the interactions is discussed.

R. Hansen, and P. Sestoft on decidability of dense-time Duration Calculus [Zhou, Hansen, Sestoft, 1993] it is well-known that decidable fragments of Duration Calculus can only be obtained through withdrawal of much of the interesting vocabulary...... of this logic. While this was formerly taken as an indication that key-press verification of implementations with respect to elaborate Duration Calculus specifications were also impossible, we show that the model property is well decidable for realistic designs which feature natural constraints...... suitably sparser model classes we obtain model-checking procedures for rich subsets of Duration Calculus. Together with undecidability results also obtained, this sheds light upon the exact borderline between decidability and undecidability of Duration Calculi and related logics....\n\nCorrelation Measurement of Lambda-anti-Lambda, Lambda-Lambda and anti-Lambda-anti-Lambda with the ATLAS detector at s=7 TeV\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCheng, Hok-Chuen\n\nThis thesis summaries the measurements of correlations between Lambda 0Lambda0, Lambda0Lambda 0, and Lambda0Lambda 0 hyperon pairs produced inclusively at the LHC, which are useful for a better understanding of the quark-antiquark pair production and jet fragmentation and hadronization processes. The analysis is based on hyperon pairs selected using the muon and minimum bias data samples collected at the ATLAS experiment from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV in 2010. Excess Lambda0Lambda 0 are observed near the production threshold and are identified to be originated from the parton system in the string model in the MC sample, decaying either directly or through heavy strange resonances such as Sigma0 and Sigma*(1385). Dynamical correlations have been explored through a correlation function defined as the ratio of two-particle to single-particle densities. Positive correlation is observed for Lambda0Lambda0 and anticorrelation is observed for Lambda0Lambda 0 and Lambda0Lambda 0 for Q in [0,2] GeV. The structure replicates similar correlations in pp, pp, and pppp events in PYTHIA generator as predicted by the Lund string fragmentation model. Parameters of the \"popcorn\" mechanism implemented in the PYTHIA generator are tuned and are found to have little impact on the structure observed. The spin composition of the sample is extracted using a data-driven reference sample built by event mixing. Appropriate corrections have been made to the kinematic distributions in the reference sample by kinematic weighting to make sure that the detector effects are well modeled. A modified Pearson's chi2 test statistics is calculated for the costheta* distribution to determine the best-fitted A-value for data. The results are consistent with zero for both like-type and unlike-type hyperon pairs in Q â [0,10] GeV and Q â [1,10] GeV respectively. The data statistics in the range of Q â [0, 1] GeV is currently too low for the estimation of the emitter\n\nA Typed Functional Calculus With State\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nRensink, Arend; MÃ¼llhÃ¤user, M.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nWe extend the simple typed \\\\lambda-calculus with statements.

In this paper, we show that token machines also make sense when the programs at hand are those of a simple quantum lambda-calculus with implicit qubits. This, however, requires generalising the concept of a token machine to one in which more than one particle travel around the term at the same time. The presence of multiple tokens is intimately related to entanglement and allows us to give a simple operational semantics to the calculus, coherently with the principles of quantum computation.\n\nTowards Model Checking a Spi-Calculus Dialect\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nGnesi, S.; Latella, D.; Lenzini, Gabriele\n\nWe present a model checking framework for a spi-calculus dialect which uses a linear time temporal logic for expressing security properties.

It is closely related to lambda calculus and term rewriting, but it has no variable binding and no pattern matching. It is Turing complete and evaluation is deterministic. Notions like \"call-by-value\" and \"call-by-name\" computation are available by choosing appropriate function definitions: e.g. there is a call-by-value and a call-by-name addition function. In the present paper we extend CC with types, to be able to define data types in a canonical way, and functions over these data types, defined by iteration. Data type definitions follow the so-called \"Scott encoding\" of data, as opposed to the more familiar \"Church encoding\". The iteration scheme comes in two flavors: a call-by-value and a call-by-name iteration scheme. The call-by-value variant is a double negation variant of call-by-name iteration. The double negation translation allows to move between call-by-name and call-by-value.\n\nEnergy spectra in $p$-shell $\\\\Lambda$ hypernuclei and $^{19}_{\\\\Lambda}\\\\textrm{F}$ and spin-dependent $\\\\Lambda N$ interactions\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nKanada-En'yo, Yoshiko; Isaka, Masahiro; Motoba, Toshio\n\n2018-01-01\n\nEnergy spectra of $0s$-orbit $\\\\Lambda$ states in $p$-shell $\\\\Lambda$ hypernuclei ($^{A}_\\\\Lambda Z$) and those in $^{19}_{\\\\Lambda}\\\\textrm{F}$ are studied with the microscopic cluster model and antisymmetrized molecular dynamics using the $G$-matrix effective $\\\\Lambda N$ ($\\\\Lambda NG$) interactions.

In this paper, a brief view of the equilibrium point hypothesis for human motor system modeling is given, and the lambda-model derived from this hypothesis is studied. The stability of the lambda-model based on equilibrium and Jacobian matrix is investigated.

Both nonrelativistic and semirelativistic Hamiltonians are used to obtain the baryon wave functions from a fit to the spectra, and the wave functions are expanded in both the harmonic oscillator and Sturmian bases. The latter basis leads to form factors in which the kinematic dependence on q{sup 2} is in the form of multipoles, and the resulting form factors fall faster as a function of q{sup 2} in the available kinematic ranges. As a result, decay rates obtained in the two models using the Sturmian basis are significantly smaller than those obtained using the harmonic oscillator basis. In the case of the {Lambda}{sub c}, decay rates calculated using the Sturmian basis are closer to the experimentally reported rates. However, we find a semileptonic branching fraction for the {Lambda}{sub c} to decay to excited {Lambda}* states of 11% to 19%, in contradiction with what is assumed in available experimental analyses. Our prediction for the {Lambda}{sub b} semileptonic decays is that decays to the ground state {Lambda}{sub c} provide a little less than 70% of the total semileptonic decay rate. For the decays {Lambda}{sub b} {yields} {Lambda}{sub c}, the analytic form factors we obtain satisfy the relations expected from heavy-quark effective theory at the non-recoil point, at leading and next-to-leading orders in the heavy-quark expansion. In addition, some features of the heavy-quark limit are shown to naturally persist as the mass of the heavy quark in the daughter baryon is decreased.\n\nA \"Model\" Multivariable Calculus Course.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBeckmann, Charlene E.; Schlicker, Steven J.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nDescribes a rich, investigative approach to multivariable calculus.

This measurement was performed in the experimental Hall C at Jefferson Lab. The scattered electron was detected in the HMS spectrometer, and the electro-produced kaon and the proton from the Lambda -> ppi- decay were both detected in the SOS spectrometer. This quantity is very sensitive to the elementary p(e,e'K) [capital Lambda, Greek] process and gives information on resonance production, and Regge exchange, among others. The result presented was measured at Q2=1.50 (GeV/c)2 and cos [straight theta, small theta, Greek] K [small gamma, Greek] CM=14 sup o. The limits of the [capital Lambda, Greek] polarization, with respect to the p [small gamma, Greek] x pK axis, were found to be -0.21 and +0.89 with a confidence level of 68%.

The main focus of the research is the understanding of the spin transfer mechanism from quarks to hadrons through the fragmentation process by utilizing the longitudinal {lambda} and anti {lambda} polarization. The result of the spin transfer provides useful information to test different model predictions which describe spin effects in hyperon production and the quark-antiquark asymmetry of the nucleon and hyperon. The {lambda} and anti {lambda} polarization are determined by measuring the acceptance corrected angular distribution of its decay products. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to correct the acceptance of the COMPASS spectrometer. In this work, preliminary results from data collected in the current fragmentation region during 2002-2004 are presented. A significantly positive average spin transfer of anti {lambda} is found to be equal to C{sub LL}=+0.232{+-}0.039(stat.){+-}0.022(sys.), while the spin transfer of lambda is compatible with zero within the statistical accuracy. The dependences of the spin transfer on various kinematic variables are also presented.

The optimal transverse shape of the laser beam, including its variability under water-cooling, is determined for selective ablation of dental calculus. Intensity profiles under various water-cooling conditions were optically observed. The 400-nm laser was coupled into a multimode optical fiber using an f = 2.5-cm lens and light-shaping diffuser. Water-cooling was supplied coaxially around the fiber. Five human tooth samples (four with calculus and one pristine) were irradiated perpendicular to the tooth surface while the tooth was moved back and forth at 0.3 mm/second, varying between 20 and 180 iterations. The teeth were imaged before and after irradiation using light microscopy with a flashing blue light-emitting diode (LED). An environmental scanning electron microscope imaged each tooth after irradiation. High-order super-Gaussian intensity profiles are observed at the output of a fiber coiled around a 4-in. diameter drum. Super-Gaussian beams have a more-homogenous fluence distribution than Gaussian beams and have a higher energy efficiency for selective ablation. Coaxial water-cooling does not noticeably distort the intensity distribution within 1 mm from the optical fiber. In contrast, lasers focused to a Gaussian cross section (Calculus is preferentially ablated at high fluences (> or =2 J/cm(2)); below this fluence, stalling occurs because of photo-bleaching of the calculus. Healthy dental hard tissue is not removed at fluences calculus with a frequency-doubled Ti:sapphire laser. Fluences over 2 J/cm(2) are required to remove calculus efficiently since photo-bleaching stalls calculus removal below that value.\n\nRecombinant lambda-phage nanobioparticles for tumor therapy in mice models.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGhaemi, Amir; Soleimanjahi, Hoorieh; Gill, Pooria; Hassan, Zuhair; Jahromi, Soodeh Razeghi M; Roohvand, Farzin\n\n2010-05-12\n\nLambda phages have considerable potential as gene delivery vehicles due to their genetic tractability, low cost, safety and physical characteristics in comparison to other nanocarriers and gene porters. Little is known concerning lambda phage-mediated gene transfer and expression in mammalian hosts. We therefore performed experiments to evaluate lambda-ZAP bacteriophage-mediated gene transfer and expression in vitro. For this purpose, we constructed recombinant lambda-phage nanobioparticles containing a mammalian expression cassette encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and E7 gene of human papillomavirus type 16 (lambda-HPV-16 E7) using Lambda ZAP- CMV XR vector. Four cell lines (COS-7, CHO, TC-1 and HEK-239) were transduced with the nanobioparticles. We also characterized the therapeutic anti-tumor effects of the recombinant lambda-HPV-16 E7 phage in C57BL/6 tumor mice model as a cancer vaccine. Obtained results showed that delivery and expression of these genes in fibroblastic cells (COS-7 and CHO) are more efficient than epithelial cells (TC-1 and HEK-239) using these nanobioparticles. Despite the same phage M.O.I entry, the internalizing titers of COS-7 and CHO cells were more than TC-1 and HEK-293 cells, respectively. Mice vaccinated with lambda-HPV-16 E7 are able to generate potent therapeutic antitumor effects against challenge with E7- expressing tumor cell line, TC-1 compared to group treated with the wild phage. The results demonstrated that the recombinant lambda-phages, due to their capabilities in transducing mammalian cells, can also be considered in design and construction of novel and safe phage-based nanomedicines.\n\nA generalized nonlocal vector calculus\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAlali, Bacim; Liu, Kuo; Gunzburger, Max\n\n2015-10-01\n\nA nonlocal vector calculus was introduced in Du et al. (Math Model Meth Appl Sci 23:493-540, 2013) that has proved useful for the analysis of the peridynamics model of nonlocal mechanics and nonlocal diffusion models. A formulation is developed that provides a more general setting for the nonlocal vector calculus that is independent of particular nonlocal models. It is shown that general nonlocal calculus operators are integral operators with specific integral kernels. General nonlocal calculus properties are developed, including nonlocal integration by parts formula and Green's identities. The nonlocal vector calculus introduced in Du et al. (Math Model Meth Appl Sci 23:493-540, 2013) is shown to be recoverable from the general formulation as a special example. This special nonlocal vector calculus is used to reformulate the peridynamics equation of motion in terms of the nonlocal gradient operator and its adjoint. A new example of nonlocal vector calculus operators is introduced, which shows the potential use of the general formulation for general nonlocal models.\n\nCalculation of subLAMBDA sup 9 Be in an alpha-alpha-LAMBDA three-body model using the Faddeev equations\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nOryu, S; Yamashita, H; Nakazawa, M; Kamada, H\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe hypernucleus subLAMBDA sup 9 Be is investigated in an alpha-alpha-LAMBDA three-body model using the Faddeev formalism. We use an alpha-alpha interaction in which the Pauli-forbidden states are correctly taken into account and we employ some phenomenological potentials between the alpha and LAMBDA particles. We obtained two bound states for J suppi = 1/2 sup + and 3/2 sup + , and three resonance states of (3/2) sub 1 sup - , (3/2) sub 2 sup - , (3/2) sub 3 sup -. We studied the properties of these states by calculating the components and the expectation values of the potential for each partial wave. It is found that a few channels dominate in the 1/2 sup + and 3/2 sup + states, so that the alpha-clusters or the sup 8 Be core are still alive in the nucleus. In a case were the two alpha particles are fixed on an axis the contour plots of the distribution of the LAMBDA particle are shown. With the assistence of these plots one can visually understand that some of them are shell-model-like states while others ...\n\nAn operator calculus for surface and volume modeling\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGordon, W.

An outline of what may be termed an operator calculus for the approximation and interpolation of functions of more than one independent variable is presented. By considering the linear operators associated with bivariate and multivariate interpolation/approximation schemes, it is shown how they can be compounded by operator multiplication and Boolean addition to obtain a distributive lattice of approximation operators. It is then demonstrated via specific examples how this operator calculus leads to practical techniques for sculptured surface and volume modeling.\n\n$\\\\Lambda$ and $\\\\bar{\\\\Lambda}$ polarization at COMPASS\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nKang, Donghee\n\n2010-01-01\n\nAt the COMPASS experiment $\\\\Lambda$ and $\\\\bar{\\\\Lambda}$ particles are produced with high statistics in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) processes of 160 GeV/c polarized muons.

The paper presents a method to model a calculus domain based on a bool algebra which uses solid and hollow polygons. The general calculus relations of the geometrical characteristics that are widely used in mechanical engineering are tested using several shapes of the calculus domain in order to draw conclusions regarding the most effective methods to discretize the domain. The paper also tests the results of several CAD commercial software applications which are able to compute the geometrical characteristics, being drawn interesting conclusions. The tests were also targeting the accuracy of the results vs. the number of nodes on the curved boundary of the cross section. The study required the development of an original software consisting of more than 1700 computer code lines. In comparison with other calculus methods, the discretization using convex polygons is a simpler approach. Moreover, this method doesn't lead to large numbers as the spline approximation did, in that case being required special software packages in order to offer multiple, arbitrary precision. The knowledge resulted from this study may be used to develop complex computer based models in engineering.\n\nBrueckner Rearrangement Effects in $^5_\\\\Lambda$He and $^6_{\\\\Lambda\\\\Lambda}$He\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nKohno, M.; Fujiwara, Y.; Akaishi, Y.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nRearrangement effects in light hypernuclei are investigated in the framework of the Brueckner theory.

While this problem is known to be non-elementary when arbitrary length models are considered [Hansen94], it turns out to be only NP-complete when...... constrained to bounded length. As a corollary we obtain that model construction is in NP for the formulae actually encountered in case studies using Duration Calculus, as these have a certain small-model property.

The effects of photoionization from low lying excited states of neutral calcium are found to reduce the sensitivity of the lambda 6573 center-to-limb behavior as a thermal structure diagnostic. The synthetic center-to-limb behavior is also sensitive to uncertainties in the nonthermal broadening. Nevertheless, the measured center-to-limb behavior of lambda 6573 favors a 'cool' photospheric model similar to the Vernazza, Avrett, and Loeser model M over hotter models based on the Ca II K wings. The non-LTE calcium abundance obtained from the disk center equivalent widths of lambda 6573 and lambda 7324 using the best fit model is Asub(Ca)approximately=2.1+-0.2x10 -6 (by number relative to hydrogen). Applications of these lines as diagnostics of the Ca-Ca + ionization equilibrium in other stars are briefly discussed.

The model is used for the interpretation of various motor phenomena, particularly electromyographic patterns. The stretch reflex in the lambda model has no mechanism to follow-up a certain muscle length prescribed by central commands. Rather, its task is to bring the system to an equilibrium, load-dependent position. Another currently popular version defines the equilibrium point concept in terms of alpha motoneuron activity alone (the alpha model). Although the model imitates (as does the lambda model) spring-like properties of motor performance, it nevertheless is inconsistent with a substantial data base on intact motor control. An analysis of alpha models, including their treatment of motor performance in deafferented animals, reveals that they suffer from grave shortcomings. It is concluded that parameterization of the stretch reflex is a basis for intact motor control. Muscle deafferentation impairs this graceful mechanism though it does not remove the possibility of movement.\n\nModelling the Landing of a Plane in a Calculus Lab\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMorante, Antonio; Vallejo, Jose A.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe exhibit a simple model of a plane landing that involves only basic concepts of differential calculus, so it is suitable for a first-year calculus lab. We use the computer algebra system Maxima and the interactive geometry software GeoGebra to do the computations and graphics.

M.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nFaddev calculations are reported for Lambda-Lambda-5H, Lambda-Lambda-5He and Lambda-Lambda-6He in terms of two Lambda hyperons plus the respective nuclear clusters, using Lambda-Lambda central potentials considered in past non-Faddeev calculations of Lambda-Lambda-6He. The convergence with respect to the partial-wave expansion is studied, and comparison is made with some of these Lambda-Lambda hypernuclear calculations. The Lambda-Lambda Xi-N mixing effect is briefly discussed.\n\nTuplix Calculus\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nBergstra, J. A.; Ponse, A.; van der Zwaag, M. B.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWe introduce a calculus for tuplices, which are expressions that generalize matrices and vectors. Tuplices have an underlying data type for quantities that are taken from a zero-totalized field. We start with the core tuplix calculus CTC for entries and tests, which are combined using conjunctive composition. We define a standard model and prove that CTC is relatively complete with respect to it. The core calculus is extended with operators for choice, information hiding, scalar multiplicatio...\n\nExterior calculus and two-dimensional supersymmetric models\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSciuto, S.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nAn important property of the calculus of differential forms on superspace is pointed out, and an economical way to treat the linear problem associated with certain supersymmetric two-dimensional models is discussed. A generalization of the super sine-Gordon model is proposed; its bosonic limit is a new model whose associate linear set has an SU(3) structure.

We will present step by step the methodology for the displacements calculus and in the end we will insert these relations in a program for automatic calculus and we extract the conclusions. There is taken into account only the effects of the bending moments (because these insert the highest displacements. The simplifying assumptions and the calculus relations for the displacements (linea r and angular ones are presented in an original way.\n\nSearch for the $\\\\Lambda_b^0 \\\\rightarrow \\\\Lambda \\\\eta^\\\\prime$ and $\\\\Lambda_b^0\\\\rightarrow \\\\Lambda \\\\eta$ decays with the LHCb detector\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nAaij, Roel;

The objective of this article is to validate a mathematical postural control model for quiet standing posture. The postural dynamics is modeled in the sagittal plane as an inverted pendulum with torque applied at the ankle joint. The torque control system is represented by the physiological lambda model. Two neurophysiological command variables of the central nervous system, designated lambda and micro, establish the dynamic threshold muscle at which motoneuron recruitment begins. Kinematic data and electromyographic signals were collected on four young males in order to measure small voluntary sway and quiet standing posture. Validation of the mathematical model was achieved through comparison of the experimental and simulated results. The mathematical model allows computation of the unmeasurable neurophysiological commands lambda and micro that control the equilibrium position and stability. Furthermore, with the model it is possible to conclude that low-amplitude body sway during quiet stance is commanded by the central nervous system.\n\nRenormalization Group Evolution of the Standard Model Dimension Six Operators I: Formalism and lambda Dependence\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nJenkins, Elizabeth E; Trott, Michael\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe calculate the order \\\\lambda, \\\\lambda^2 and \\\\lambda y^2 terms of the 59 x 59 one-loop anomalous dimension matrix of dimension-six operators, where \\\\lambda and y are the Standard Model Higgs self-coupling and a generic Yukawa coupling, respectively. The dimension-six operators modify the running of the Standard Model parameters themselves, and we compute the complete one-loop result for this. We discuss how there is mixing between operators for which no direct one-particle-irreducible diagram exists, due to operator replacements by the equations of motion.\n\nCalculus with applications\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nLax, Peter D\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis new edition of Lax, Burstein, and Lax's Calculus with Applications and Computing offers meaningful explanations of the important theorems of single variable calculus. Written with students in mathematics, the physical sciences, and engineering in mind, and revised with their help, it shows that the themes of calculation, approximation, and modeling are central to mathematics and the main ideas of single variable calculus. This edition brings the innovation of the first edition to a new generation of students. New sections in this book use simple, elementary examples to show that when applying calculus concepts to approximations ofÂ functions, uniform convergence is more natural and easier to use than point-wise convergence. As in the original, this edition includes material that is essential for students in science and engineering, including an elementary introduction to complex numbers and complex-valued functions, applications of calculus to modeling vibrations and population dynamics, and an introduc...\n\nMeasurement of the Longitudinal Spin Transfer to Lambda and Anti-Lambda Hyperons in Polarised Muon DIS\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nAlekseev, M.; Alexandrov, Yu.; Alexeev, G.D.; Amoroso, A.; Austregesilo, A.; Badelek, B.; Balestra, F.; Ball, J.; Barth, J.; Baum, G.; Bedfer, Y.; Bernhard, J.; Bertini, R.; Bettinelli, M.; Birsa, R.; Bisplinghoff, J.; Bordalo, P.; Bradamante, F.; Bravar, A.; Bressan, A.; Brona, G.; Burtin, E.; Bussa, M.P.; Chapiro, A.; Chiosso, M.; Chung, S.U.; Cicuttin, A.; Colantoni, M.; Crespo, M.L.; Dalla Torre, S.; Dafni, T.; Das, S.; Dasgupta, S.S.; Denisov, O.Yu.; Dhara, L.; Diaz, V.; Dinkelbach, A.M.; Donskov, S.V.; Doshita, N.; Duic, V.; Dunnweber, W.; Efremov, A.; Eversheim, P.D.; Eyrich, W.; Faessler, M.; Ferrero, A.; Finger, M.; Finger, M.Jr.; Fischer, H.; Franco, C.; Friedrich, J.M.; Garfagnini, R.; Gautheron, F.; Gavrichtchouk, O.P.; Gazda, R.; Gerassimov, S.; Geyer, R.; Giorgi, M.; Gobbo, B.; Goertz, S.; Grabmuller, S.; Grajek, O.A.; Grasso, A.; Grube, B.; Gushterski, R.; Guskov, A.; Haas, F.; von Harrach, D.; Hasegawa, T.; Heckmann, J.; Heinsius, F.H.; Hermann, M.; Hermann, R.; Herrmann, F.; Hess, C.; Hinterberger, F.; Horikawa, N.; Hoppner, Ch.; d'Hose, N.; Ilgner, C.; Ishimoto, S.; Ivanov, O.; Ivanshin, Yu.; Iven, B.; Iwata, T.; Jahn, R.; Jasinski, P.; Jegou, G.; Joosten, R.; Kabuss, E.; Kang, D.; Ketzer, B.; Khaustov, G.V.; Khokhlov, Yu.A.; Kisselev, Yu.; Klein, F.; Klimaszewski, K.; Koblitz, S.; Koivuniemi, J.H.; Kolosov, V.N.; Komissarov, E.V.; Kondo, K.; Konigsmann, K.; Konopka, R.; Konorov, I.; Konstantinov, V.F.; Korzenev, A.; Kotzinian, A.M.; Kouznetsov, O.; Kowalik, K.; Kramer, M.; Kral, A.; Kroumchtein, Z.V.; Kuhn, R.; Kunne, F.; Kurek, K.; Le Goff, J.M.; Lednev, A.A.; Lehmann, A.; Levorato, S.; Lichtenstadt, J.; Liska, T.; Maggiora, A.; Maggiora, M.; Magnon, A.; Mallot, G.K.; Mann, A.; Marchand, C.; Marroncle, J.; Martin, A.; Marzec, J.; Massmann, F.; Matsuda, T.; Maximov, A.N.; Meyer, W.; Michigami, T.; Mikhailov, Yu.V.; Moinester, M.A.; Mutter, A.; Nagaytsev, A.; Nagel, T.; Nassalski, J.; Negrini, S.; Nerling, F.; Neubert, S.; Neyret, D.; Nikolaenko, V.I.; Olshevsky, A.G.; Ostrick, M.; Padee, A.; Panknin, R.; Panzieri, D.; Parsamyan, B.; Paul, S.; Pawlukiewicz-Kaminska, B.; Perevalova, E.; Pesaro, G.; Peshekhonov, D.V.; Piragino, G.; Platchkov, S.; Pochodzalla, J.; Polak, J.; Polyakov, V.A.; Pontecorvo, G.; Pretz, J.; Quintans, C.; Rajotte, J.F.; Ramos, S.; Rapatsky, V.; Reicherz, G.; Reggiani, D.; Richter, A.; Robinet, F.; Rocco, E.; Rondio, E.; Ryabchikov, D.I.; Samoylenko, V.D.; Sandacz, A.; Santos, H.; Sapozhnikov, M.G.; Sarkar, S.; Sbrizzai, G.; Schiavon, P.; Schill, C.; Schmitt, L.; Schroder, W.; Shevchenko, O.Yu.; Siebert, H.W.; Silva, L.; Sinha, L.; Sissakian, A.N.; Slunecka, M.; Smirnov, G.I.; Sosio, S.; Sozzi, F.; Srnka, A.; Stolarski, M.; Sulc, M.; Sulej, R.; Takekawa, S.; Tessaro, S.; Tessarotto, F.; Teufel, A.; Tkatchev, L.G.; Venugopal, G.; Virius, M.; Vlassov, N.V.; Vossen, A.; Weitzel, Q.; Windmolders, R.; Wislicki, W.; Wollny, H.; Zaremba, K.; Zemlyanichkina, E.; Ziembicki, M.; Zhao, J.; Zhuravlev, N.; Zvyagin, A.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe longitudinal polarisation transfer from muons to lambda and anti-lambda hyperons, D_LL, has been studied in deep inelastic scattering off an unpolarised isoscalar target at the COMPASS experiment at CERN. The spin transfers to lambda and anti-lambda produced in the current fragmentation region exhibit different behaviours as a function of x and xF . The measured x and xF dependences of D^lambda_LL are compatible with zero, while D^anti-lambda_LL tends to increase with xF, reaching values of 0.4 - 0.5. The resulting average values are D^lambda_LL = -0.012 +- 0.047 +- 0.024 and D^anti-lambda_LL = 0.249 +- 0.056 +- 0.049. These results are discussed in the frame of recent model calculations.\n\nSearch for the Lambda(0)(b) -> Lambda eta ' and Lambda(0)(b) -> Lambda eta decays with the LHCb detector\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nAaij, R.; Adeva, B.; Adinolfi, M.; Affolder, A.; Ajaltouni, Z.; Akar, S.; Albrecht, J.; Alessio, F.; Alexander, M.; Ali, S.; Alkhazov, G.; Cartelle, P.

Thanks to these new configurations, various hypernuclei such as # Lambda# 28 Al, # Lambda# 12 B and # Lambda# 7 He were measured with precise energy resolution of 500 keV (FWHM). Obtained absolute binding energies and cross sections were compared with other experimental data and recent theoretical calculations based on shell model and cluster model. The results of this study provided new information on ÎN interaction.\n\nMeasurement of $\\\\Lambda$ polarization from Z decays\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nBuskulic, Damir; DÃ©camp, D; Ghez, P; Goy, C;

Evidence of longitudinal polarization of s quarks from Z decay is observed for the first time. The measured longitudinal \\\\Lambda polarization is P^{\\\\Lambda}_{L} = -0.32 \\\\pm 0.07 for z = p/p_{\\\\mathrm{beam}} > 0.3. This agrees with the prediction of -0.39 \\\\pm 0.08 from the standard model and the constituent quark model, where the error is due to uncertainties in the mechanism for \\\\Lambda production. The observed \\\\Lambda polarization is diluted with respect to the primary s quark polarization by \\\\Lambda baryons without a primary s quark. Measurements of the \\\\Lambda forward-backward asymmetry and of the correlation between back-to-back \\\\Lambda \\\\bar{\\\\Lambda} pairs are used to check this dilution. In addition the transverse \\\\Lambda polarization is measured. An indication of transverse polarization, more than two standard deviations away from zero, is found along the normal to the plane defined by the thrust axis and the \\\\La...\n\nSharks, Minnows, and Wheelbarrows: Calculus Modeling Projects\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSmith, Michael D.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this article is to present two very active applied modeling projects that were successfully implemented in a first semester calculus course at Hollins University.
