Then cohomology with coefficients in a local system is the corresponding sheaf cohomology.\n\nMore generally, we say a local system is a locally constant stack, ‚Ä¶ and eventually a locally constant ‚àû-stack.\n\nUnder suitable conditions (if we have Galois theory) local systems on XX correspond to functors out of the fundamental groupoid of XX, or more generally to (‚àû,1)-functors out of the fundamental ‚àû-groupoid. These in turn are equivalently flat connections (this relation is known as the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence) or generally flat ‚àû-connections.\n\nDefinitions\n\nA notion of cohomology exists intrinsically within any (‚àû,1)-topos. We discuss local systems first in this generality and then look at special cases, such as local systems as ordinary sheaves.\n\nGeneral\n\nFor H\\mathbf{H} an (‚àû,1)-sheaf (‚àû,1)-topos, write\n\nfor the terminal (‚àû,1)-geometric morphism, where Œì\\Gamma is the global section (‚àû,1)-functor and LConstLConst the constant ‚àû-stack-functor.\n\nWrite ùíÆ:=core(Fin‚àûGrpd)‚àà\\mathcal{S} := core(Fin \\infty Grpd) \\in ‚àûGrpd for the core ‚àû-groupoid of the (‚àû,1)-category of finite ‚àû\\infty-groupoids. (We can drop the finiteness condition by making use of a higher universe.) This is canonically a pointed object *‚ÜíùíÆ* \\to \\mathcal{S}, with points the terminal groupoid.\n\n(See principal ‚àû-bundle for discussion of how cocycles ‚àáÀú:X‚ÜíLConstùíÆ\\tilde \\nabla : X \\to LConst \\mathcal{S} classify morphisms P‚ÜíXP \\to X.)\n\nSheaf-theoretic case\n\nLocal systems can also be considered in abelian contexts. One finds the following version of a local system\n\nRegarded as a sheaf FF with values in abelian groups, such a linear local system serves as the coefficient for abelian sheaf cohomology. As discussed there, this is in degree nn nothing but the intrinsic cohomology of the ‚àû\\infty-topos with coefficients in the Eilenberg-MacLane object B nF\\mathbf{B}^n F.\n\nRelated concepts\n\nflat vector bundle, Gauss-Manin connection\n\ninfinity-local system\n\ninner local system\n\nsimplicial local system: within Sullivan‚Äôs (1977) theory of Infinitesimal computations in topology, he refers to ‚Äòlocal systems‚Äô several times. This seems to be simplicial in nature. This entry explores some of the uses of that notion based on Halperin‚Äôs lecture notes on minimal models\n\nD.
