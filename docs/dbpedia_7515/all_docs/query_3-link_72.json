        "text": "Students at Steenrod Elementary will be able to take advantage of a new playground when the weather gets warmer.\n\nThe school received grant money toward the project, which was matched by the board of education at last Monday night’s meeting.\n\nIt will include a mud kitchen, water table, and a trampoline. Officials say it will have much more use than just an area to play.\n\n\"There's so many studies, brain-based research into play and the importance of it in a child's development,\" Principal Michelle Dietrich said.\n\n\"We use it as an outdoor classroom,” Pre-K teacher Beth Wallace said. “We do experiments out there, and they do a lot of cause and effect things to figure out how things work. It also promotes a sense of cooperation and teamwork.\"\n\nThe playground should be up and running fully when the weather warms."
