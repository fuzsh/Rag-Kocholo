These are a high standard of academic performance within a broadly-based, liberal arts curriculum, the individual nature of this education, and the importance of personal ideals and moral values. High scholastic ability is a requisite for admission to Haverford, but heavy weight is given to the character of each candidate and the potential contribution he can make to the college community. Along with a commitment to scholarship, the college emphasizes the development of sound ethical judgments based on a clear perception of individual and social aims. In his academic work, each student is encouraged and expected to perform at a level consistent with his abilities. The more capable he is the more is expected of him. He will soon discover the high value which the college attaches to intellectual integrity, independence of judgment, an imaginative grasp of the interrelationship of the branches of knowledge, and a capacity to carry out independent work. The requirements for graduation are designed to develop the ability to learn, to understand, and to reach sound conclusions, on the basis of study in each of the broad fields of human knowledge as well as by concentration in a single field. The college believes that the desirable qualities cultivated in the classroom and laboratory can be supplemented and strengthened by a sound program of non-academic courses, athletics, and extraairricular activities. The Arts and Service non-credit courses are designed to encourage interest in constructive community service and to develop appreciation of beauty and certain creative skills. Athletic activities, including intramural and intercollegiate contests, promote physical fitness and coordination and provide opportunity for all students to experience the benefits of wholesome competition and team play. A variety of campus organizations allow each student to join with others in pursuing common interests. The important role of the honor system in student government emphasizes the value which the community places on individual responsibility. Haverford College believes that while the mastery of facts, techniques, and certain skills is important, it must be coupled with the desire and moral capacity to use them for worthwhile ends. It will continue to lay stress on the formation of moral values and personal ideals, not insisting on any set doctrine, but cherishing freedom of religious beliefs and of conscience. Such growth is fostered by the weekly Collections, or assemblies, where leaders from various walks of life share with the undergraduates their diverse experi- 21 HAVERFORD COLLEGE ences and points of view. In addition, outstanding scholars frequently visit the campus for lectures or special classes, and have extensive personal con- tacts with students. At the center of the religious activity of the Society of Friends is the Meeting for Worship. This fact has been recognized by a policy of com- pulsory attendance for Haverford's students at Fifth Day Meeting. The majority of attenders at Fifth Day Meeting, students and faculty members, are not members of the Society of Friends. In view of this, and the fact that attendance is compulsory, Haverford's Fifth Day Meeting is not a Friends' Meeting in the usual sense. However, what the Haverford Meeting does share with an authentic Friends' Meeting is the gathering together of a group in silence for collective meditation and consideration of matters of funda- mental and common concern. Here students, faculty, and administration alike learn from meditative silence or from a spoken message how to delineate and cultivate the highest moral principles, to see themselves in their proper relation to their fellowmen and to the totality of life. HISTORY Haverford College was founded in 1833 as the first college established by members of the Society of Friends in the United States. It was organized as an institution which would provide an \"enlarged and liberal system of instruction\" to meet the intellectual needs of \"Friends on this continent,\" offering a course of instruction in science, mathematics, and classical lan- guages \"as extensive as given in any literary institution in this country.\" In those days it was modestly called Haverford School, but the intent was clear to create a center that would give to Friends the kind of education which other young Americans were receiving in the best colleges. The founders selected, as a site for the new college, 198 acres of rolling farmland in the center of the Welsh Tract, a large area originally set apart by William Penn for Quaker immigrants from Wales. Today its beautifully landscaped campus, grown to 216 acres, forms a peaceful setting in the midst of the suburbs of Philadelphia. The first forty years of Haverford's history were devoted to establishing policies and practices to make effective the ideals of its founders. In 1847 it opened its doors to young men who were not Quakers, and in 1856 it became a degree-granting institution. Although the college has never had any formal connection with an organized Meeting of the Society of Friends, its Quaker tradition continues strong. With the exception of four of its 22 RESOURCES number nominated by the alumni and two elected by the faailty, all members of the Board of Managers must be members of the Society of Friends. President Isaac Sharpless, 1887-1917, led Haverford College into the fore- front of American collegiate institutions. Under his leadership, Haverford's tradition of outstanding teaching was continued and strengthened. During the administration of William Wistar Comfort, from 1917 to 1940, the student body increased from two hundred to over three hundred. Felix Morley, a Rhodes Scholar of the Class of 1915, was President during the difficult years of World War II. He was succeeded by Gilbert F. White, one of the country's outstanding geographers, who served as President from 1946 to 1955 before returning to teaching and research. Hugh Borton, former Professor of Japanese History at Columbia University and Director of its East Asian Institute, was inaugurated as President in 1957. In 1963 the Board of Managers (Trustees) approved expansion in the enrollment from 450 to 700 within the following decade. By 1965, enroll- ment has grown to just over 500. RESOURCES The endowment and trust funds of Haverford College currently have a book value of about $14,000,000. The income from these funds and the support given to the college annually by its alumni and other friends play significant parts in maintaining its high educational standards and under- writing the scholarship and loan programs which help many of its students. Founders Hall, built in 1833 at a cost of $19,251.40, was known for years as \"The College\". Over the years the campus has been improved by the addition of dormitories and other buildings to supplement Founders Hall. Except for those who live at home, students live in dormitories or small residence houses on the campus. Similarly a large portion of the faculty live in houses or apartments owned by the college and situated on or near the campus. Academic Buildings Classroom and laboratory buildings are Chase Hall, Hilles Laboratory of Applied Sciences, Strawbridge Memorial Observatory, Henry S. Drinker Music Center, Stokes Hall, Sharpless Hall, and the Lyman Beecher Hall Building. Some classes are also held in Whitall Hall. Hilles houses the Engineering Department and contains classrooms, draw- ing rooms, a departmental library, shops, and mechanical and electrical lab- 23 HAVERFORD COLLEGE oratories. Also located there is the Haverford-Bryn Mawr Computer Center. This center contains an IBM 1620 computer with card input and output. The computer has a 60,000 decimal digit memory with an access time of 20 microseconds. Its speed is 1800 five-digit additions or 200 five-digit multiplications per second. This center has several key punches, a sorter, a reproducer, and a tabulator. All of its equipment may be used by students. Stokes Hall, built at a cost of $2,000,000 and opened in September 1963, provides unexcelled facilities, including classrooms and office space, for the departments of physics, chemistry, and mathematics. In one wing are an auditorium seating 205 persons and a science library with space for 20,000 volumes and current journals. The Physics Department is equipped for teaching and research in modern nuclear and atomic physics. Facilities include six general laboratories for course work, seven speciali2ed laboratories for student-faculty research, and two senior thesis rooms, used exclusively by seniors for their major projects. The equipment includes an X-ray unit for powder diffraction work, a sub- critical reactor containing 2.5 tons of uranium, a doubly shielded room for work with electromagnetic radiation, and four scanning microscopes. Student- built equipment is also available, such as a laser apparatus and a radio-telescope. Facilities for the Chemistry Department include five laboratories used in conjunction with formal courses, instrument and specialized equipment rooms, and six independent faculty research laboratories which are used freely by students doing independent work and advanced projects with professors. The department has its own glass-blowing shop. Equipment includes a full range of recording spectrophotometers, counting equipment for radioactive tracer work, and a gas chromatography apparatus for general use as well as units for separate research projects. The physical chemistry laboratory includes a Bausch and Lomb grating spectrograph, high vacuum systems, and standard precision electrical apparatus. Mettler single pan balances are used in instruc- tional laboratories. Ground joint glassware is used in the elementary organic chemistry program and in all higher courses. Grants from the National Science Foundation are available to students for summer research projects. The Mathematics Department, located on the top floor, uses several class- rooms, some of which are equipped with desk calailators. Sharpless Hall, recently completely remodeled and redesigned for the departments of biology and psychology at a cost of $750,000, was reopened for use in the fall of 1964. 24 RESOURCES Three floors, devoted to the Biology Department, include laboratories and seminar rooms with a broad spectrum of facilities for studying all phases of modern molecular biology. There is a large freshman-sophomore laboratory, and a junior laboratory equipped to handle all aspects of cell biology. One entire floor is devoted to student-faculty research where senior students do projects in common with professors. Equipment includes animal rooms, shops for glass-blowing and wood and metal working, several constant temperature rooms for controlled temperature experiments, ultra-centrifuges, a high-reso- lution electron microscope, spectrophotometers, and a liquid scintillation counter. The department also has its own library and journal collection. The top two floors are devoted to psychology. Equipment includes both primate and non-primate animal quarters, animal laboratory with sound- proofed and full wired individual experimental rooms, a set of individual multi-purpose animal and human research rooms, a perception laboratory, a statistical laboratory, a social-personality observation laboratory with one-way mirrors, a shop, a journal library and reading room. In addition there is a physiological psychology and control room for animal operation procedures and master control panels of all inter-laboratory communication channels. William J. Strawbridge Memorial Observatory is equipped with three equatorially mounted telescopes, a 10-inch and a 41/2-inch refractor, and a 6-inch reflector; a reflecting telescope with 8-inch mirror and altazimuth mounting; a meridian circle telescope of 3%-inch aperture; a zenith telescope of 21/^ -inch aperture; a spectrohelioscope; an astrographic mounting pro- vided with two 4-inch Ross lenses and a 4-inch guiding telescope; sidereal clocks, a chronograph, and other instruments. The astronomical library is housed in the Observatory. Henry S. Drinker Music Center, located in the former home of William Wistar Comfort, provides offices, classrooms, and practice facilities for the music department, and houses the college's record collection and music library. The larger concerts are held in Roberts Hall where a Steinway grand and a Schlicker portable pipe organ are at the disposal of artists. The Library The Haverford College Library is planned and developed with the primary purpose of providing the intellectual resources of books, periodicals, and pamphlets needed to sustain the work of the academic curriculum. Most of the volumes have been selected by the teaching faculty, and, with the 25 HAVERFORD COLLEGE exception of some special collections described below, the books and period- icals are all on open shelves and readily accessible for over one hundred hours a week during the college year. In the administration of the Library, the aim is to bring the resources of the book collection as effectively as possible into the academic life of the college. Beyond this primary purpose, the Library seeks through several collections to provide opportunities for independent research in certain fields. Most notable of such collections is the Quaker Collection, which attracts many visiting scholars each year. The Government Depository and International Documents Collections provide extensive resources for independent study in the social sciences, and there are further collections of autograph material, orientalia, and particularly of Renaissance literature offering similar research opportunities in other fields. The Haverford Library contains about 245,000 volumes, and receives about 1250 periodicals and serials. It is an academic library, planned and operated for the students and faculty of the college, but welcomes alumni, members of the Library Associates, and residents of the Haverford community who wish to consult materials not readily available in public libraries. Because of limited seating capacity, however, special rules govern applications by secondary school students for permission to use the Library. The Library is open on weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to midnight, and on Sundays from 1:00 P.M. to midnight. (Treasure Room: Weekdays — 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.; Sundays 1:00 - 5:00 p.m.). Special hours are arranged for vacation periods. The Library building, the first portion of which (the present north wing) was built in 1863, has grown by five successive additions. In December, 1952, the original north wing was renovated in memory of William Pyle Philips, and now forms a bright and comfortable room for quiet study. There are also four special reading rooms in the building: Gummere-Morley Memorial Reading Room, decorated and equipped by the Class of 1892, provides a reading and browsing room for Haverford students. Micromaterials Reading Room, equipped with microfilm and micro- print readers and a microfilm file of The New York Times from 1930 to the present. RuFUS M. Jones Study, a replica of Rufus Jones' own study, with his own books and furniture, is used for seminar classes in philosophy as well as for quiet reading. 26 RESOURCES Treasure Room, provided through the generosity of Morris E. Leeds of the Class of 1888, contains the Quaker Collection as well as other rare books and special collections. Plans are in preparation and funds are being collected for a major addition to the Library, which will double the interior space, provide twice the present capacity, and greatly increase student study areas. Special Collections The Quaker Collection, containing approximately 22,000 books and 60,000 manuscripts and documents, maps, and pictures of interest to the Society of Friends, provides a repository for Quaker literature in the United States, and makes Haverford a vital center for the study of the history and philosophy of Quakerism. The unique nucleus of this collection is The William H. Jenks Collection of Friends' Tracts, mostly of the seventeenth century, which numbers about 1500 separately bound titles. The Rufus M. Jones Collection on Mysticism contains almost a thousand books and pamphlets from the fifteenth century to the present day. The Tobias Collection of the Writings of Rufus M. Jones is practically complete. It consists of 168 separate volumes and 16 boxes of pamphlets and extracts. The Charles Roberts Autograph Collection contains more than 20,000 items, embracing autographs of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, authors, statesmen, scientists, ecclesiastics, and monarchs, and also several series of valuable papers on religious and political history. French Drama of the Romantic Period, a collection of several hun- dred popular plays produced in Paris between 1790 and 1850. The collection was presented to the college by William Maul Measey. The Christopher Morley Collection of Autographed Letters comprises about 200 letters and memoranda selected by Mr. Morley from his correspondence files. Over one hundred contemporary authors are represented. The William Pyle Philips Collection contains rare books and manu- scripts, mostly of the Renaissance period. Among the treasures of this collection are first editions of Dante, Copernicus, Spenser, the King James Bible, Milton, Newton, and the four folios of Shakespeare. 27 HAVERFORD COLLEGE The Harris Collection of Anqent and Oriental Manuscripts contains over 60 Hebrew, Latin, Arabic, Syriac, and Ethiopian rolls and codices collected by J. Rendel Harris. Affiliations Haverford maintains a cooperative arrangement with Bryn Mawr and Swarthmore whereby the facilities of the libraries of all three colleges are open to the faculty and students of each of the colleges. The Philadelphia Bibliographical Center and Union Library Catalogue, the largest regional cooperative catalogue in America, enables users of the Haverford Library to locate books in over 170 libraries of the Philadelphia area. Library Associates is an organization of graduates and friends of the college, devoted to increasing the usefulness of the Library. It serves to bring the facilities of the Library to wider notice and to make them avail- able; to encourage the making of gifts to the Library; and to aid in the use of the Library for exhibition purposes. Also, it sponsors occasional talks on Sunday afternoons on matters of interest to friends of the Library. Inquiries should be addressed to The Library, Haverford College. Art Collection A small permanent art collection, including paintings and drawings by Homer, Inness, Pintorricchio, Sargent, and Whistler, is displayed in the Library. Temporary exhibitions of paintings, drawings, and photographs are held from time to time at the college. Framed reproductions of outstanding paintings and a few originals are available at the beginning of each semester for loan to students. Music In addition to a considerable collection of music scores, including the complete works of several composers, the special equipment of the music department consists of several pianos and a collection of scores, books, and phonograph records presented in 1933 by the Carnegie Corporation. This record collection, housed in The Henry S. Drinker Music Center, has served as the basis for further acquisitions which are used for teaching and study purposes. 28 RESOURCES Haverford College Friends of Music is an association of friends and neighbors of the college and faculty members, who, in cooperation with the music department, arrange a series of chamber music concerts which are held three or four times a year on Sunday afternoons in the Common Room. Residence Halls Dormitories include Foljnders Hall, which in addition to a number of living units also includes the college dining hall, a few faculty and administrative offices, and suites for visiting guests; Barclay Hall, which houses mostly freshmen; Lloyd Hall, and Leeds Hall. A new dormitory, with space for 129 students, was opened early in 1965. Spanish-, German-, and French-speaking students may reside in Williams House, Yarnall House and French House, respectively, thus gaining an opportunity to live in close association with others specializing in these fields. One other residence, near but not on the campus, is Scull House, with room for about 20 students. Athletic Facilities Haverford's Gymnasium was supplemented in 1957 by Alumni Field House, which affords capacious facilities for indoor athletics and has proved its value in the college's extensive program for physical education. Walton Field, where football games and track meets are held, has stands capable of seating 2000 spectators. Around the field is a quarter-mile track with a 220 yard straight-away. In addition, varsity soccer matches are played on '88 Field, varsity baseball games are played on '22 Field, and cricket is played on Cope Field. The college has 15 tennis courts, six of them all-weather, a skating pond, a cross country course, and several prac- tice fields which are also used for intramural sports. Other Buildings Administration offices are located in Roberts Hall, an impressive col- umned building at the center of the campus, which also contains an audi- torium seating over 700. Other offices are maintained in Whitall. The Union provides facilities for the campus radio station, student lounges, the college bookstore, and a snack bar. Morris Infirmary, presented by John T. Morris of the Class of 1867, houses a clinic, emergency treatment room, and facilities for bed care of 10 patients, including an isolation ward for contagious diseases. It has its own kitchen and accommodations for a resident nurse. 29 HAVERFORD COLLEGE Location Located ten miles west of Philadelphia on the \"Main Line,\" Haverford is fortunate to have the extensive cultural, scientific and industrial facilities of the Greater Philadelphia area close at hand. Within a half hour's drive there are some 20 other colleges and universities. Haverford Station, on the Pennsylvania Railroad between Ardmore and Bryn Mawr, is 20 minutes from the center of the city. The campus fronts on famous Lancaster Pike (U.S. 30) , a few miles from the Pennsylvania Turnpike. It is approximately two hours by train from New York or Baltimore and less than three hours from Washington. The campus, landscaped and park-like in appearance, provides a beautiful natural setting. The Arboretum and Woolman Walk, the latter the gift of the late Edward Woolman, '93, contain a wide variety of woody plants, both indigenous and exotic, thus permitting direct observation and study by students of the natural sciences. Mary Newlin Smith Memorial Garden, which adjoins the south side of the Library, while primarily developed as a decorative feature, contains a wealth of flowering shrubs of interest to the botanist. ADMISSION The policy of Haverford College is to admit to the freshman class those applicants who, in the opinion of the Committee on Admissions, are best qualified to profit by the opportunities which the college offers and at the same time to contribute to undergraduate life. Due regard is given not only to scholarly attainment, as shown by school record and examination, but also to character, personality, and interest and ability in important extra- curricular activities. Whenever practicable, the college will expect the candidate to have a personal interview with the Director of Admissions or another administrative officer. Every applicant should realize that, in view of the limited enrollment, he is entering a competition for admission to a carefully selected and com- paratively small student organization. On the basis of all information avail- able — school record, class standing, College Board reports, evidence touch- ing on character and personality — the application will be accepted or rejected, and the decision of the Committee on Admissions is final. Preference will be given to those with superior records and credentials rather than to those with mere priority of application. 30 ADMISSION Each applicant must submit his school record and a certificate of character signed by his school principal. The preparatory course should include as a minimum four years of English, three years of mathematics including two years of algebra, three years of one foreign language (in preference to two years of two languages), a laboratory science, and a course in history or social studies. Additional courses in foreign language, mathematics, science, social studies and history will be dictated by the interests of the candidates. Each applicant for admission must take the Scholastic Aptitude Test and three Achievement Tests of the College Entrance Examination Board. The English Composition Test is required, but a candidate may choose the other two tests. If there is any doubt about the choice of the two tests he should consult the Director of Admissions. Applications involving divergence from the normal procedure must be discussed in detail with the Director of Admis- sions. Applications for admission should be submitted early in the candidate's senior year. The application must be accompanied by a check or money order for $10 drawn to the order of Haverford College to cover the application fee, which is not refundable. Upon receipt of the application, the college will send a school record form to the candidate for completion by the school officials. Candidates are encouraged to visit the college for an interview. The Office of Admissions is open from 9:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. on weekdays and from 9:00 A.M. until noon on Saturdays. The office is closed on Saturdays during the summer. Arrangements should be made in advance for an appointment. Information Concerning College Entrance Board Tests The College Entrance Examination Board will offer the Scholastic Apti- tude Test and Achievement Tests on each of the following dates during the 1965-66 academic year: Sat., Dec. 4, 1965 Sat., Jan. 8, 1966 Sat., Mar. 5, 1966 Sat., May 7, 1966 Sat., July 9, 1966 The Bulletin of biformaf/oii, distributed without charge by the College Entrance Examination Board to all secondary schools that present candidates for the tests, contains rules regarding applications, fees, reports, and the 31 HAVERFORD COLLEGE conduct of the tests; lists of examination centers; and an application. This application may be used for any College Board administration involving the SAT and Achievement Tests. Additional applications will be available at the schools for students needing more than one. Booklets describing the tests and giving sample questions, explanations, and answers, as well as score interpretation booklets for counselors and students, are also distributed in quantity to secondary schools without charge. Candidates should make application by mail to the College Entrance Exam- ination Board, Box 592, Princeton, N. J. 08540. Students who wish to take the examinations in any of the following States, territories, or foreign areas should address their inquiries and send their applications to College Entrance Examination Board, P. O. Box 1025, Berkeley, Cal. 94701. Alaska Nevada Province of Alberta Arizona New Mexico Province of British Columbia California Oregon Province of Manitoba Colorado Utah Province of Saskatchewan Hawaii Washington Republic of Mexico Idaho Wyoming Australia Montana Northwest Territory Pacific Islands including Yukon Territory Japan and Formosa Early Decision An early decision plan is available for candidates whose first choice is Haverford. Since a limited number of students can be accepted under the plan, only students who have seriously investigated the college and who are well qualified should apply. Candidates must take the required College Board examinations in their junior year and must submit an application before November 1. Additional information may be obtained from the Director of Admissions. Transfer Students Several transfer students are admitted each year. In addition to filing an application, a candidate must submit a school transcript (on a form pro- vided by Haverford), the results of the College Board examinations that he has taken, a college transcript, a letter of recommendation from a responsible 32 HOUSING official of the college which he is attending, and have an interview with a representative of the Admissions Office. Decisions are announced in June. Advanced Standing An adequately qualified student may be permitted to omit an introductory course in college and proceed directly to work at the intermediate level in that subject. Several departments give placement examinations to determine these qualifications; other departments use less formal means. Students who have taken courses in high school under the Advanced Placement Program may take tests in these subjects given by the College Entrance Examination Board each May. Students who do well on these tests may be given advanced placement or college credit or both. Credit may also be granted for work done at another college prior to entrance here. To be considered for such credit, a student must arrange for the transcript of the work to be sent to Haverford. Provision is made under the Flexibility Program (see pages 45-48) for a student to make special use of such credits if he so desires. HOUSING The value of participating as widely as possible in the life of the com- munity is an integral part of Haverford's educational philosophy. Therefore students, with the exception of those who are married or are living at home, are normally expected to live on campus. Entering freshmen are assigned the rooms available after the other classes have made their choice. New students will be notified of their housing assignments prior to their arrival on campus in September. The choice of rooms by other students is governed by established rules. A deposit of $35 is required of all new students at the time they are notified of their admission. A similar deposit is required also of those students who have not been in attendance at the college during the immediately preceding semester. This amount will be deducted from the bill for the fol- lowing year. If the student fails to present himself at the beginning of the semester for which he has been enrolled, the deposit will be forfeited. Students are expected to treat college propert)' with the same consideration as their own. A student is held financially responsible for any damage to his room. 33 HAVERFORD COLLEGE EXPENSES The tuition charge for all regular students is $1775 for the academic year.* Tuition for special students is $250 per course, per semester. The residence fee is $900 per year. The payment of a unit fee of $135 per year makes it possible for the student to participate in any campus organization without an additional fee. The residence fee covers board and room charges when college is in session; under the latter are included heat, electric light, weekly service, and the use of necessary bedroom furniture, i.e., a bureau, table, chair, study lamp, and a bed, the linen for which is furnished and laundered by the college. Students will supply their own study furniture, blankets, and towels. The unit fee includes the following: student activities fee, admission to Art Series, laboratory fees, health fee, accident insurance (a maximum of $1000 within one year of each accident), diploma, and psychological tests when required by the college. There are four scheduled vacation recesses during the school year: Thanks- giving, Christmas, mid-year recess, and spring vacations. With minor excep- tions student services and facilities and academic facilities are closed or dras- tically curtailed during vacation periods. The college requires that bills rendered August 15 and January 15 for the following semester's tuition, board, room, unit fee, and deposits be paid in full before the beginning of the semester. In order to avoid last minute congestion, it is suggested that bills be paid by mail in advance. A non-refundable fee of $10 is payable when application for admission is presented. When a special diet is required for medical reasons, and approved by the college physician, a charge of $1.50 weekly will be made, but this charge may be increased if the special foods required are unusually expensive. The college requires freshmen to pay a fee of $20 toward the cost of the orientation week. * Any student who is taking four or more courses in a given semester, or who has been granted permission, under the Flexibility Program (see page 45) to carry fewer courses, is regarded as a regular student. 34 FINANCIAL AID The college requires a $100 deposit to cover the cost of books and any other incidental charges which may arise during the school year. Each inci- dentals account must have a balance, on June first, adequate to cover all final charges. At intervals during the year, a bill for the actual charges made will be sent to the student. If this bill, or any other indebtedness, is not paid by the end of the semester, credits will not be granted for the work performed. Any unspent balance is refunded at the end of the academic year. No reduction or refund of the tuition charge will be made after the first two weeks of any semester. If a student withdraws before the completion of the first two weeks, there will be a complete refund of his tuition. In case of withdrawal or absence due to illness, full refund of the residence fee can- not be made, since overhead expenses continue. However, if a student with- draws more than four weeks before the end of a semester, or is absent because of illness of four weeks or more, a partial refund of the residence fee, in the amount of $10 for each week of absence, will be made. The unit fee cannot be refunded for any reason. College Responsibility The college is not responsible for loss due to fire, theft, or any other cause. Students who wish to take out fire insurance may apply for information at the Business Office. Monthly Payments Parents who prefer to pay tuition and other fees in monthly instalments may do so through the Bryn Mawr Trust Company. Details of this plan, including charges for financing, may be obtained from the Business Office. FINANCIAL AID Students at Haverford pay only a portion of the entire cost of their educa- tion, since endowment income covers 50 percent of it. Nevertheless it must be recognized that the student bill is a considerable sum. Fortunately, the college has many resources to aid in meeting expenses. As a result, no able and responsible student who is seriously interested in Haverford should hesitate to apply because of financial reasons. The main sources of financial aid are described below. A more detailed discussion of the problem is described in a separate booklet entitled Financial Aid at Haverford. 35 HAVERFORD COLLEGE The financial aid program — scholarships, loans, and jobs — is administered by a committee consisting of the Director of Admissions, who serves as chair- man, the Dean of the College, and the Dean of Students. Scholarships Scholarships are awarded on a basis of merit and individual need. While no scholarship is given for more than one year, it is the practice to continue the scholarship if a student's scholastic performance has been satisfactory and his need continues. No scholarship will be given to a student whose academic standing is unsatisfactory. No scholarship will be given to a student whose previous college bill has not been paid in full. Candidates for freshman scholarships must file a financial statement with the College Scholarship Service, Box 176, Princeton, N. J. 08540, before January 15th. Copies of the form to be used may be obtained from the applicant's high school or from the College Scholarship Service. Inquiries about scholarships for incoming students should be addressed to the Director of Admissions. Students enrolled at the college must submit all preliminary correspond- ence and applications for undergraduate scholarships for 1966-67, together with supporting letters from parents or guardians, to the Dean before April 15, 1966. It is assumed that requests for scholarships will not be made by those whose expenses can be met by their parents or from other sources. Corporation Awards — Four Corporation Scholars will be chosen in the senior, junior and sophomore classes. The selection will be made on the basis of the highest general averages for the preceding year. Each Corporation Scholar will be awarded $50. No application for these awards is necessary. Endowed Scholarships — Included in the college's endowment are a number of funds designated especially for scholarships. A list of the endowed scholarships appears on pages 139-144 of this catalog. General Scholarships — In addition to the endowed scholarships, a general scholarship fund is available. Scholarships awarded from this fund will vary in size and number according to the needs of the applicants. 36 FELLOWSHIPS AND PRIZES Student Loan Funds Loan funds are available for students in good standing who demonstrate financial need. Haverford College does not participate in the NDEA Loan Program, but has established a College Loan Fund which is similar in most important respects. Any member of the student body who qualifies may borrow up to $1000 a year under this plan. Short-term loans are available for emergencies. They are limited to $300 a year, carry no interest charge, and are repayable within the academic year. Inquiries about loans for incoming students should be addressed to the Director of Admissions; others should be addressed to the Dean. Student Aid In addition to the Student Loan Fund and to scholarship help, the college ofiFers students the opportunity to work at standard rates in the Library and as clerical assistants to faculty and administrative oflScers of the college. The program of student aid is administered by the Dean of Students. Placement Haverford's placement service is under the direction of the Director of Alumni Affairs. Senior and alumni registrants are offered vocational guid- ance, and interviews are arranged with prospective employers. Throughout the academic year, and especially during February and March, employment ofiicers of corporations, government agencies, and service organizations come to the Haverford campus for interviews with undergraduates and alumni. FELLOWSHIPS AND PRIZES The Clementine Cope Fellowship was established in 1899. The income is applied to '\"assisting worthy and promising graduates of Haverford College in continuing their studies at Haverford or at some other institute, in this country or abroad, approved by the Board of Managers. Candidates shall be nominated by the college faculty to the Board of Managers.\" 37 HAVERFORD COLLEGE The faculty will nominate a First Cope Fellow and a Second Cope Fellow whose individual stipends, not to exceed 1 1,000, will be determined by the Board. Letters of application for the Clementine Cope Fellowship must be in the hands of the President not later than March 1, accompanied by whatever statements of extracurricular activities the candidates consider relevant. Augustus Taber Murray Research Scholarships were established in 1964 \"in recognition of the scholarly attainments of Augustus Taber Murray, a distinguished alumnus of Haverford College, of the Class of 1885.\" The scholarships are awarded in English literature or philology, the Classics, German literature or philology (in order of preference) to students who have received the bachelor's degree from Haverford College, and shall be awarded for the purpose of study in other institutions toward the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, or such degrees as may in the future correspond to that degree. In making the awards the college will take into consideration the candidate's promise of success in graduate work and the availability of other financial assistance in the candidate's proposed field of study. The scholarships shall be awarded only to unmarried men; they may be awarded to the same student for two or three years in succession, but not longer than three years. Ordinarily one scholarship will be awarded each year and the stipend will be $900. In years when finances permit, two scholarships may be awarded. Letters of application for the Augustus Taber Murray Scholarships must be in the hands of the President not later than March 1, accompanied by whatever statements of plans the candidates consider relevant. The faculty of the college will select the Augustus Taber Murray Research Scholars. Prizes of various kinds are awarded by the college for excellence or special achievement in specific areas of accomplishment, both academic and non-academic. Descriptions of these pri2es and rules governing their award are given on pages 145-148 of this catalog. Honor Societies Phi Beta Kappa. — The Haverford College Chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa Society of America was chartered in 1898 as Zeta of Pennsylvania. Election of members-in-course, alumni members, and honorary members, based upon scholarly attainment and distinction, takes place at the end of the 38 CURRICULUM academic year. Preside7it: John F. Gummere '22; Vice-President, George H. Nofer, II '49; Secretary, Harry W. Pfund '22; Treasurer, Holland Hunter '43. Founders Club. — The Founders Club was established in 1914 as a Haverford organization of students, alumni, and faculty. Election to its membership is recognition of a sound academic record combined with note- worthy participation in extracurricular activities. Undergraduate elections are usually limited to the junior and senior classes. President: Stephen R. Miller '49, Secretary, Hunter R. Rawlings, III '66. CURRICULUM Haverford is a liberal arts college. Its curriculum is designed to develop in its students the capacity to learn and understand, and to make sound judg- ments based on knowledge and on thought. The requirements for the degree insure the exercise of these skills in each of the broad fields of human knowl- edge, and their subtler development in a single field of concentration. Bachelor's Degree To graduate from Haverford College a student must complete successfully four years of academic work, at least 36 semester courses,* and three years of physical education (part of which may be replaced by work in the Arts and Service Program). Credit for a year of academic work is given to a student who has passed at least eight semester courses with an average of at least 60 for the freshman year, 65 for the sophomore year, and 70 for the junior and the senior years. Under the Flexibility Program (see page 45) some students are permitted to graduate with less than four years of work as here defined. Among the courses taken, the student must include Freshman English, the courses required for his major department, and, during the first three years, those required under the limited electives program (see below). To avoid undue specialization, the college requires that at least 21 courses must be passed in departments other than that of the student's major. In each course which is required as a part of his major program, a student must achieve a minimum grade of 65. He must also include course 100 in his major depart- ment during the second semester of the senior year, at the end of which he * For the class of 1966, the requirement is 38 semester courses. 39 HAVERFORD COLLEGE must take the major examination in that department, and receive in it a grade of at least 70. The degree conferred upon candidates meeting these require- ments is that of Bachelor of Arts or, for men majoring in natural science, mathematics, or engineering who request it. Bachelor of Science. Course Load The total number of courses required for graduation, as stated above, is 36, of which 20 are normally taken by the end of the sophomore year. However, on recommendation by the adviser and approval of the Dean, a student may take as few as 18 courses during the first two years. With this limitation, the 36 courses may be distributed among the normal eight semesters of residence as the student and his adviser see fit — five courses in each of four semesters (normally the first four) and four courses in each of the remaining four semesters. Any student is free to take more than 36 courses, but to take more than five at one time he must have had an average of 80 or better in the preceding semester. Course Intensification The college believes that wide diversity of course experience is an important part of a Haverford education, but the college also recognizes that students may sometimes profit from the opportunity on occasion to work more intensively on a smaller number of subjects. Therefore, with the approval of his adviser, a student may, if he wishes, effect reduction in the number of dif- ferent subjects he is studying at any time except in his freshman year by reg- istering, with the instructor's permission, for double credit in one, and in unusual cases, more than one of his courses. In a double credit course the student undertakes an approved program of independent study in conjunction with a regular course or a project course and submits a paper or passes an examination based on his independent work. Such independent work is not suitable in all subjects and the instructor of the course must be the final judge of whether or not it should be attempted. In unusual cases, a student may apply to the Committee on Academic Flexibility for permission to pur- sue a reduced program without enrolling in a double credit course. Limited Electives To ensure breadth of distribution, every student is required to take a certain number of courses in each of four designated areas of study. This require- ment must be satisfied before a student can be admitted to senior standing. Exception may be made with the permission of the major supervisor and the Dean. The requirements are as follows: 40 II CURRICULUM 1. Foreign Languages: Students whose native language is English are required to pass at least one full-year course in a foreign language above the elementary grade. For the purpose of this requirement all first year foreign language courses are considered as of elementary grade. Ordinarily this requirement shall be satisfied by the end of the sophomore year. At the time a student is admitted to a department his major adviser, in con- sultation with the student and his language instructors, shall make a decision as to whether the student's projected uppcrclass work and special interests require him to pursue additional language study and if so what study is required. 2. Humanities: Division of courses into (a) and (b) categories is designed to assure that each student will have experience in the two areas: philosophic and religious, and literary and aesthetic. While recognizing that each humanities course may have some elements of both areas, the faculty has agreed that the desired objectives can be reached by requiring that each student shall pass two semester courses in each of the following categories (a) and (b): (a) Humanities 21-22; all courses in Philosophy except 16, 31, 32, 36, and 47; all courses in Religion. (b) All courses in Classics numbered above 14; all courses in English numbered above 16, except English 40; all courses in French numbered above 22; all courses in German numbered above 14, except German 21; all courses in History of Art and in Music; Russian 201, 203 (at Bryn Mawr); all courses in Spanish numbered above 14. 3. Natural Sciences and Mathematics: The requirement may be met by passing four semester courses chosen from : Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, and Physical Science 36. At least one of the four semester courses must be a laboratory course. Excluded from the category of laboratory courses are Biology 11, Physical Science 36, Physics 15, 16, and all courses in the Department of Mathematics, 4. Social Sciences: The requirement may be met by passing four semester courses from at least two departments in the social sciences: Eco- nomics, History, Political Science, Sociology, Psychology (limited to Psychology 11, 12, 22, 23, 32). Included must be at least one of the following courses, which contain contemporary, quantitative materials not normally treated in secondary schools: Economics 11, 12, Political Science 12, Psychology 11, 12, Sociology 11. This requirement may not be met solely with courses listed and crosslisted in a single department. 41 HAVERFORD COLLEGE Courses listed jointly under history and English, or history and Classics, may be used in meeting the Social Science requirement or the Humanities (b) requirement, but not both. Neither Religion/History 27, 28 nor Religion/ History 40 may be counted toward the Social Science requirement. Courses taken at other institutions will not normally be accepted as satis- fying limited elective requirements. For transfer students, credit toward limited elective requirements for work already done is evaluated by the Dean at the time of admission. Free Electives A number of courses sufficient to bring the total to at least 36 semester courses shall be chosen by the student in consultation with his faculty adviser, with the understanding that the college reserves the right, through the adviser and the Dean, to prevent unreasonable combinations of courses. Non-Academk Electives Three terms of physical education or of courses in the Arts and Service Program are required of each freshman, sophomore, and junior, as described on pages 99 and 124-127. These courses must be taken in addition to the 36 semester courses of academic work normally required for a degree. Major Concentration A student may elect to major in any one of the following departments: Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Classical Archaeology (Bryn Mawr College), Classics, Economics, Engineering, English, French, Geology (Bryn Mawr Col- lege), German, History, History of Art (Bryn Mawr College), Italian (Bryn Mawr College), Mathematics, Music, Philosophy, Physics, Political Science, Psychology, Religion, Russian, Sociology and Anthropology (at Bryn Mawr College if emphasis is on Anthropology), Spanish. Definite requirements are stated under the name of each department on pages 57-124. During the fourth semester of his attendance each student should confer with the major supervisor of the department in which he wishes to major, and apply to him for written approval of a program of courses for the last four semesters. Such a program must provide for the completion, by the end of the senior year, of approximately twelve semester courses, or the equivalent, at least six of which must be in the major depart- ment and the others in closely related fields. Should the student's application 42 CLURICULUM be rejected by all departments in which he is interested, he should consult the Dean. Failure to file with the Dean, before the date specified on the college calendar, a copy of his major program signed by his major super- visor, will entail a fine of $5. Any student who continues delinquent in this matter, unless he is excused by the Dean, will be debarred from the final examinations in his fourth semester. Should the student's application be rejected by all the departments to which he applies, he will not be promoted. A student who applies for permission to become a major in any depart- ment may be rejected for scholastic reasons only. The college rule on this point is: If, at the time specified for application, the average of the grades obtained by a student in the \"preliminary courses\"* of any department is 75 or above, the student will be accepted by that department. If the average of the grades obtained in these courses is below 70, the student will be accepted in that department only under exceptional circumstances. If the average of the grades obtained in these courses is 70 or above, but below 75, the decision will be at the discretion of the major super- visor. A student who has been formally accepted as a major by any department has the right to remain as a major in that department as long as he is in college. Should he wish to change from one department to another after the beginning of his fifth semester, the change can be made only with the con- sent of the new major supervisor and the Dean. Each senior must take a special major comprehensive examination (written, oral, or both) during the period sclieduled for such examinations. The purpose of this examination is to promote the student's comprehension, inte- gration and application of the knowledge acquired in the field of his major concentration, and to secure evidence of this achievement. The passing grade for this examination is 70. In case of failure, a candidate may, with the per- mission of his major supervisor, present himself for re-examination at a date (to be determined by the major supervisor) later than Commencement Day of the current year. * \"Preliminary courses\" are any courses the student may already have taken in the department to which he is applying. If the applicant has not already taken any courses in that department, the department may name courses in other departments which are to be regarded as \"preliminary.\" 43 HAVERFORD COLLEGE If the re-examination is taken one year later, during the regular period of major examinations, there is no fee. But if the candidate applies for re-examination at an earlier date (involving the preparation of a special examination for one individual), and if the request is granted, the fee is $25. As special background for the comprehensive examination a senior shall engage in a period of study, technically called course 100, in his department of concentration during the semester preceding that examination. This period of study shall be counted as one of the five courses normally carried by the student during his final semester. Evaluation of the work in course 100 may be included in the grade earned by the student in his comprehensive examination. In case of failure of the comprehensive examination a student does not necessarily repeat the term work of course 100, but follows the application procedure for re-examination as indicated above. A student may not take more than two re-examinations in the field of his major concentration. Students taking majors under the supervision of Bryn Mawr College will note that their course 100 may extend over more than one semester; if this is the case, credit for two courses at Haverford will be granted if the work in each semester of this course is satisfactory. Examinations in courses in the major subject taken in the last semester of the senior year may be omitted at the discretion of the major supervisor. Courses taken in Summer School will not satisfy Haverford course require- ments for the major unless prior written approval is granted by the major supervisor. A student who has demonstrated unusual maturity and who has special interests and abilities may be permitted to arrange an interdepartmental major. The program of courses, the nature of the 100 course, and the nature of the comprehensive examination for an interdepartmental major are to be worked out in advance (that is, when the major is selected) by the student, with per- mission of the Dean, in consultation with and subject to the approval of the chairmen of the departments concerned, one of whom will be designated as major supervisor for that student. In rare cases, and only for high ranking students, a double major may be arranged, in which the student takes the complete major in each of two departments. In order to take a double major, a student must receive per- mission from the Dean as well as from the chairman of each of the departments concerned. 44 CURRICULUM Freshman Program Each freshman, on entering the college, is assigned to a faculty member as adviser. Unless the student or the adviser requests a change, the student keeps the same adviser until he choooses a major near the end of the sopho- more year, when the chairman of the major department becomes his adviser. Assignment of advisers for incoming students is made by the Dean, on the basis of the best evidence available to him. If the student finds another faculty member whom he would prefer to have as adviser, he is urged to inform the Dean of this preference, so that, if possible, the change can be made. An important function of the adviser is to help the student select a plan of study, consistent with college requirements, which is suited to his special needs. The limited elective requirements are designed to assure that each student will acquire breadth of knowledge and of interest to enrich his life and to enable him to relate his special field to other fields; they will assure that he encounters areas of knowledge and ways of thinking which may be new to him, and which might change altogether his ideas about desirable areas of specialization. Since it is important that this diversified experience be gained early, the faculty requires that English be taken throughout the freshman year, and strongly recommends that the other courses be one in language, one in natural science or mathematics, and one in social science, with the fifth course chosen freely. The courses open to freshmen are numbered 11 to 20 in the section on Courses of Instruction. If he is qualified, a freshman may be permitted by the department concerned and by the Dean to take more advanced courses. A series of standard tests is administered to all entrants within the first few days of the first semester. These tests are helpful in guidance and counseling. Each freshman's capacity for oral expression is considered early in the academic year, and further training in speech is given to those who need it, as well as to any others who may request it. Flexibility Program Since difl?erent students have different needs, abilities, and goals, there may be cases where the general regulations prevent a student from making the best use of educational opportunities at Haverford. Provision is therefore 45 HAVERFORD COLLEGE made for changing the normal requirements in certain individual cases. Par- ticular emphasis is placed on attempting to take advantage of any advanced work, such as that done under the Advanced Placement Program, which a student may have completed successfully before entering the college. Power to act on requests for exceptions to any of the academic regulations is in the hands of a standing committee of the faculty, called the Committee on Academic Flexibility, which consists of three faculty members and the Dean of the College. Before granting an exception, the Committee will secure approval from the student's major supervisor or, if the student is an underclassman, from his adviser and from the chairman of the department in which he proposes to major. Any student who believes that a special course program would promote his best intellectual development, is invited to present a proposal to this group. Students with exceptional abilities or exceptional preparation or both (including especially those students who enter with several credits from the Advanced Placement Program) are encouraged to consider whether a program out of the ordinary may help them to make the most of their opportunities. The college suggests con- sideration of the following, as examples of special programs which might be followed: Enrichment and Independent Study: Students with outstanding records who have the approval of the appropriate departmental chairmen and the Committee on Academic Flexibility may depart from the usual course pat- terns. Three examples follow: (a) A student admitted to the Thesis Progra/n may enroll in his senior year in as few as three courses, and will complete a thesis based on independent work. (b) A student admitted to an Inteydepartmental Program must first have been accepted as an interdepartmental major (the two departments need not be in the same division). His program, which may include a reduced course load and a thesis, as in (a) above, will also include some advanced independent work relating to both departments. (c) A student admitted to a Concentrated Program will be permitted more than the usual amount of concentration, taking in each of two or three of his last four semesters, two double credit courses in his major field, or a closely related field. Students who meet the standards set by departments for honors, may be granted departmental or interdepartmental honors for these programs. 46 CURRICULUM Grcid nation in Less than Eight Haver jord Semesters: Students with extra credits, gained from the Advanced Placement Program, summer school, or carrying an overload, or from some combination of these, may be able to finish requirements for the Haverford degree in less than the normal four years. Other students may obtain credit for a year's work under either the Junior Year Abroad or the Junior Year Language programs. Such students, like transfer students, may graduate after fewer than eight semesters at Haverford, but with the usual 36 course credits. Sufficiently mature students, if they possess outstanding ability or are judged to have legitimate reason for special consideration, may be allowed to graduate without necessarily accumulating all of the credits normally required. The Committee on Academic Flexibility may approve an individual student course program for graduation with fewer than the usual number of courses. Three examples of possible programs are : (a) Graduation After Three Years: A student who has done consistently good work and who, by the beginning of his second year at Haver- ford, has credit for 15 or more courses, may request permission to graduate after only two more years at the college. If such permission is granted, it will be with the proviso that he must maintain a very high level of performance and, to help assure sufficient breadth in his program, he must not only meet the usual limited elective and minimum departmental requirements, but must study for four con- secutive semesters some subject (or meaningful combination of sub- jects) outside of the division in which his major department lies. His continuation in this program is subject to review, before he enters his senior year, by the Committee and by his major supervisor. (b) A Term Away from Haverford: There may be occasion when a stu- dent's needs are best served by studying or serving elsewhere for a time, without gaining formal academic credit, as he would if he were in a program like Junior Year Abroad. A student accepted into the \"term away\" program must meet all departmental and limited elec- tive requirements, and must successfully complete a total of seven semesters at Haverford and at least one semester elsewhere (or six at Haverford, and two or more elsewhere) engaged in a program (academic, service to others, gainful employment, etc.) approved in advance by the Committee on Academic Flexibility and by his major supervisor, and evaluated by them after completion. 47 HAVERFORD COLLEGE (c) Reduced Course Load: The 36 course requirement in effect at Haver- ford helps to assure that diversity which is an important part of a liberal education. There may, however, be students who could profit by carrying fewer than the normal number of courses each semester. The Committee on Academic Flexibility is authorized to permit some students, where good reason can be shown, to omit one of their courses. Gradual 10)1 in More than Eight Haver j or d Semesters: Although most stu- dents are expected to graduate in four academic years, some, as indicated above, may take less and some may be permitted to take more. The Com- mittee on Academic Flexibility may permit some sti.idents to remain at Haverford for a fifth year. Examples would include students with physical handicaps which prevented them from carrying a full load, students who change their goals or who have aspirations (such as a double major) for which more than four years might be required, and students who wish to take, simultaneously with their work at Haverford, part-time work elsewhere (such as journalism, design, etc.) for which academic credit at Haverford is not appropriate. Developmental Reading A program of developmental reading, under the direction of Mr. F. D. Comfort, offers an opportunity for students to improve their reading and study proficiency. Few students, if any, have realized their real potentiality in this field. Through a series of conferences, and possibly some group sessions, methods of developing higher level reading skills are explored and practiced. Any student who is willing to concentrate upon it, while reading for his various subjects, will find that he can increase his speed and comprehension. Also, by giving thought to the different purposes of reading, and practicing methods appropriate to each purpose, he may increase his adaptability, making each type of reading more effective. Preparation for Professions A large number of Haverford College students plan, after graduation, to enter upon further courses of study. As a liberal arts college, Haverford arranges its curriculum so that students who have such plans are able to meet the entrance requirements of graduate and professional schools. The college does not, however, attempt to anticipate in its own curriculum the work of any graduate or professional school. It is the conviction of the faculty that 48 CURRICULUM the best preparation for graduate work is a liberal education, with sound training in basic disciphnes, to which more speciaHzed training may later be added. A student who intends to go to a professional school is free to choose his major in accord with his principal abilities and interests, since professional schools, such as those of business administration, education, law, medicine, or theology, usually accept students on the basis of merit regardless of their choice of major and, except in the case of medical schools, without specific course requirements. The requirements of most state boards of medical licensure are such that all students who hope to be admitted to a medical school must take two semester courses, each of which must include laboratory work, in biology (usually Biology 12 and Biology 21), Chemistry 13, 14 (or 15, 16), 25, 26, and Physics 13, 14. Students who plan to go to professional schools should seek advice as early as possible from appropriate faculty members as follows: business adminis- tration, Mr. Teaf; education, Mr. Lyons; engineering, Mr. Hetzel; law, Mr. Diamant; medicine, Mr. Cadbury; theology, Mr. Spiegler. If a student plans to do graduate work in a departmental subject, such as economics, mathematics, history, etc., he should consult as early as possible with the chairman of the department at Haverford which most nearly corre- sponds to the department in which he plans to work in graduate school. This adviser will be able to guide him in his selection of courses, his choice of major (which will not necessarily be in the department of his intended graduate study), and other questions which may have bearing on his future. Law schools, medical schools, and some graduate schools require applicants to take special admission tests. Arrangements for taking these tests are the responsibility of the student concerned; he can obtain information about them from the faculty members mentioned above. Regulations Co72Jlicting Courses A student is not allowed to elect conflicting courses, except with the per- mission of the Dean and the two instructors concerned. Audited Courses A student who wishes to audit a course should obtain the permission of the instructor. No charge is made for auditing. 49 HAVERFORD COLLEGE Course Changes Courses may be changed during the first week of each new semester. During that time students are free to make changes after consultation with their advisers and the Dean. Changes will not be permitted later except in cases where the student is known to be an excellent student and where he receives the consent of the professor to whose course he is changing and of his adviser and of the Dean. Evaluation of Academic Performance The instructor in each course submits at the end of each semester a numerical grade for each student. A grade of \"c.i.p.\" (course in progress) may be submitted at midyears for senior research courses which run through- out the year, and for certain other year courses, as agreed on by the instructor and the Dean, and so announced at the beginning of the course. Passing grades at Haverford range from 60 to 100 inclusive. Failing grades range from 45 to 59 inclusive (the lowest grade given to a student who completes a course is 45). The grades obtained by each student are averaged together to give evidence of his overall performance during that semester. If a student drops a course, or is required by his instructor to drop it, the grade is recorded as \"dr\" and averaged as 40, except that if the drop is permitted by the Dean for reasons, such as illness, beyond the student's control, it is recorded as \"w\" (withdrawn) and is not included in computing the average. The Committee on Academic Standing reviews students' records at inter- vals, and has authority to drop students from college, or to set requirements for additional work in cases of students whose work is unsatisfactory. As a rule, the committee will drop from college freshmen who do not receive the required minimum average of 60, sophomores whose averages are below 65, and juniors and seniors whose averages are below 70. However, any student whose record is such as to justify the belief that he is not availing himself of the opportunities offered by the college may be dropped. In a year course in which the work of the second semester depends heavily on that of the first, a student who fails the first semester but nevertheless is allowed to continue may receive credit for the first semester (although the grade will not be changed) if his grade for the second semester is 70 or above, provided that the instructor in the course states in writing to the Registrar at the beginning of the second semester that this arrangement applies. 50 CURRICULUM A student who, because of special circumstances such as illness, receives a low grade in a course, may petition his instructor and the Dean for a special examination. If the request is granted, and the student takes the special examination, the grade in that examination will replace the grade originally received in the mid-year or final examination in computing the final grade for that course; the new course grade will be entered in place of the old on the student's transcript, and the semester average will be revised accordingly. Intercollegiate Cooperation The variety of courses available to Haverford students is greatly increased as a result of a cooperative relationship among Haverford, Bryn Mawr, Swarthmore, and the University of Pennsylvania. Under this arrangement, full-time students of any of these four institutions may, upon presentation of the proper credentials, enroll for courses at another institution of the group without added expense. Students wishing to take advantage of this arrangement must obtain the permission of the Dean. Such permission is seldom granted to freshmen, but is normally granted to others unless the course in question conflicts with required appointments at Haverford. It is not granted if an equivalent course is offered at Haverford; however, if taking the course elsewhere will resolve a serious schedule conflict, the Dean, with the consent of the department offering the equivalent course, is empowered to make an exception. Haverford students taking courses at Swarthmore or the University of Pennsylvania are expected to make their own arrangements for transportation. Arrangements for transportation to classes at Bryn Mawr for students who need it is made through the office of the Dean of Students. Junior Year Abroad Well-qualified students who request it may be granted permission to spend the junior year studying in a foreign country. Such permission will require approval of the student's major supervisor and the Dean. If the student is not a language major, approval will also be required of the chairman of the department of the language spoken in the country selected. Interested stu- dents should consult the Dean early in the sophomore year; he will direct them to faculty members best qualified to advise them. Students who may want to take their junior year abroad should plan"
