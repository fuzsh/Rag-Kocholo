        "text": "I am happy to introduce to you the 6th International Arab Conference on Mathematics and Computations, IACMC 2019. This conference is among a series of international conferences held and sponsored by Zarqa University. The purpose of all IACMC’s is to bring together researchers and professionals in all fields of Mathematical Sciences to meet, discuss, to share and explore ideas that improve their research. On the other hand, these conferences will also provide a good opportunity to encourage young researchers, students and all those who are desirous of working in the field of Mathematics to in tract with each other and to explore possibilities for future collaborative work. This book contains the short papers of IACMC 2019 which is held in Zarqa University on April 24-26, 2019. This sixth edition contains a large number of research topics and applications in both pure and applied mathematics in addition to the field of statistics which are the topics included in the scope of IACMC’s. Furthermore, the program is enriched by several keynote lectures delivered by well-known experts in their areas of Mathematics. IACMC 2019 received 120 abstract submissions from 20 countries. The accepted fullpapers went through an evaluation method: each paper was reviewed by two reviewers from the IACMC Scientific Committee; one of them is an international known expert. Authors of some selected papers, based on the reviewer's evaluations and on the oral presentations, are invited to submit extended versions of their papers for a book which will be published by Springer. The program for this conference required the dedicated effort of many people. Firstly, we must thank the sponsors of IACMC 2019: Zarqa University and The Scientific Research Support Fund. Secondly, we thank the invited speakers for their invaluable contributions and the authors, whose research efforts are herewith recorded. We also give our thanks to the reviewers for their diligent and professional reviewing. Last but not least, a special word of thanks is due to those who spent much of their time to make the success of this conference: to all members of the Local and Organizing Committees for their super job. We look forward to welcoming and sharing this conference with you. Wishing you all an exciting conference and an unforgettable stay in Jordan and hoping to meet you again for the 7th IACMC. Aliaa Burqan Conference Chairman Zarqa University"
