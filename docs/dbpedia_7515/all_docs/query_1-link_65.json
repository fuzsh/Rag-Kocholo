        "text": "This talk was presented by Shing-Tung Yau in \"Chern: a Great Geometer of the 20th Century --- A Conference for the 110th Annivers\" (available live online,Zoom ID:228 011 0844, Passcode:Chern110) at Tsinghua University, on October 10, 2021. The Chinese translation published in Mathematics, Science, History and Culture (陈省身 —— 二十世纪伟大的几何大师).\n\nShiing-Shen Chern (1911–2004)\n\nOil painting in S.-T. Yau International Conference Center (Jiaoling, Guangdong)\n\nOpening Speech\n\nI'm proud to be a student of Shiing-Shen Chern. We come together here today to honor and memorize his great accomplishments in the history of mathematics. Professor Chern was a graduate student here at Tsinghua University 91 years ago where he grew up and became a first-class scientist. Today is his 110th birthday according to the lunar calendar. It's a unique opportunity for us to celebrate. Mathematics is getting mature at Tsinghua and the university is set to become a world-class institute of mathematics. We now have many researchers, undergraduate students, faculties, both young and established. We all consider Professor Chern as the role model as he is the greatest mathematician in the history of China. Students of Tsinghua university should be proud to have such a great alumnus who left a permanent and important landmark in the history of mathematics.\n\nChern spent four years in this beautiful courtyard of Tsinghua where he wrote his first paper on campus before he left for Germany for further study. He brought the newly developed theories of Wilhelm Blaschke and Élie Cartan back to China in 1937, after he graduated from Hamburg University and conducted researches in Paris. This becomes a new era of modern geometry in China. Although it was during the war time and Japan was invading China, yet mathematics started to grow.\n\nIn 1943, he visited and spent two years in the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In those years, he has transformed modern mathematics and modern geometry into a new era. Worked among the great mathematicians in the 20th century, he obtained an intrinsic proof of the Gauss-Bonnet formula and developed the Chern classes during those two years.\n\nBased on these works, we saw a great transformation of modern geometry into a subject where global topology and the curvature of space is no more separated.\n\nAnd we saw the birth of the gauge theory and the applications of Chern classes to all fields in science up to now. Characteristic classes have now become the key to unlock the mystery behind modern geometry, topology, high energy physics, and condensed matter physics.\n\nIt's difficult to emphasize how modern science is transformed by his influences. Now we saw Chern classes, Chern-Simons theory, and many many important invariants that were made by professor Chern. When you open a journal, you see the name of Chern everywhere. I think it is difficult to compare any other scientists with Professor Chern.\n\nLet me mention a few personal interactions with professor Chern. In the year 2000, I wrote the couplet in honor of Chern's accomplishment. Professor Chern was very pleased and insisted that I used my calligraphy to put them on the wall of the Chern institute in Nankai. I was not able to do that because of poor skill in calligraphy. I asked a very famous calligrapher to write the couplet now hang in Nankai. After 20 years, I still feel guilty because Chern asked me to do so. Right before this meeting, I finally decided to try and I hope it is presentable to you.\n\nI have the good fortune to be his student. The deeper I learn from this master of mathematics, the more I admire the harmony and beauty of nature revealed by my teacher through the Chern classes.\n\nThe first part of the couplet says, topologists start to know what curvature meant through Gauss-Bonnet formula and Chern classes. Only after Professor Chern, geometry becomes a global subject, as We interacting with topology, physics, and many different fields.\n\nThe second part of the couplet talked about his influences in terms of students and friends he trained. He had great success in establishing several extremely important institutes of mathematics in the world. He has trained 42 Ph. D. students and his descendants in mathematics are close to 1400, certainly one of the most successful educators in the world.\n\nAmong his students, Shiu-Yuen Cheng and I now work at Tsinghua. So we see his influences at Tsinghua. At Fudan University, Jun Li is his grand student and few others. I'll say Chern through his active students has a deep influence on China's mathematics.\n\nWe shall witness the transformation of mathematics in China through his education, his accomplishments in mathematics. I hope we can follow his footsteps and continue his tradition on creating and broadening the subject of geometry. I think in the next 10 years is very important for us.\n\nA Couplet Composed in Tribute to Late Mentor Shiing-Shen Chern\n\nThe cosmos was transformed by him single-handed,\n\nTopologist thus starting to know what curvature meant,\n\nand Geometer to learn global picture,\n\nConsulted by later ages Chern classes shall always see;\n\nTrue pillar of the State was he unrivalled,\n\nwith Disciples across the world,\n\nMatchless is his vision and sagacity in the universe,\n\nRemembered by future generations the master will eternally be.\n\n—— Pupil Shing-Tung Yau, August 2021\n\nChern's Education\n\nShiing-Shen Chern was born on Oct. 28, 1911 in Jiaxing, and died on Dec. 3, 2004 in Tianjin, China.\n\nHis father was a judge, who spent little time at home . His family was a well to do family in Jiaxing. He did not go to elementary school, but started preliminary middle school at the age of 9.\n\nFulun\n\nWhen he was 11, his family moved to Tianjin. At age 12, He entered a christian middle school called Fulun High School. The books that he learnt were :\n\nAlgebraby Hall and Knight,\n\nAdvanced Algebraby Wentworth, and\n\nGeometry and Trigonometryby Smith.\n\nWhen he was 14, he met professor Baocong Qian (1892-1974) of Nankai university and a friend of his father. Qian taught algebra and also was an expert on history of mathematics in China. He recommended Chern to apply to Nankai, two years ahead of his time.\n\nBaocong Qian\n\nNankai\n\nDuring his undergraduate study in Nankai, Chern was taught by Lifu Jiang (1890-1978) who graduated from Harvard in 1919 with advisor Julian Coolidge (1873-1954). The classes he took were:\n\nCoolidge's non-Euclidean geometry:Geometry of the Circle and Sphere.\n\nSalmon's book:Conic Sections and Analytic Geometry of Three Dimensions.\n\nCastelnuovo (1865-1952)'s book:Analytic and Projective Geometry.\n\nOtto Stande's book:Fadenkonstruktionen.\n\nLifu Jiang\n\nTsinghua\n\nWhen he was 19, Chern graduated from Nankai with the honor of one of the best students graduated. Then he became graduate student in Tsinghua university.\n\nHis teacher Professor Dan Sun (or Guangyuan Sun) (1900-1979) studied projective differential geometry (found by E.J. Wilczynski (1876-1932) in 1901 and followed by Fubini (1879-1943), Čech (1893-1960)).\n\nChern's master thesis was on projective line geometry which studies hypersurface in the space of all lines in three dimensional projective space. He studied line congruences: two dimensional submanifold of lines and their oscillation by quadratic line complex. At the end of his study, he wrote four papers in projective differential geometry. He published his first paper inTohoku Journal of Mathematics. That was his master thesis and the subject matter is on projective differential geometry.\n\nBlaschke\n\nWilhelm Blaschke\n\nIn 1932, the German mathematician Wilhelm Blaschke (1885-1962) visited China. He gave six talks in Peking University on the topic \"Topological questions in differential geometry\". The content of his talks were on geometry of webs, pseudo-group of diffeomorphisim and their local invariants.\n\nBlaschke's lectures let him read Oswald Veblen (1880-1960)'s bookAnalysis Situs(1922). Chern started to look into questions in global differential geometry instead of projective differential geometry.\n\nIn 1933, the topologist Emanuel Sperner (1905-1980) came to Peking University to lecture on topology and Chern was impressed by his proof of Jordan curve theorem.\n\nChern also learnt from the lectures given by G.D. Birkhoff (1884-1944) who came from Harvard to give lectures in Peking University.\n\nG.D. Birkhoff\n\nThe chairman of the department of mathematics in Tsinghua University that time was Prof. Tongsun Zheng (1887-1963), who later became father in law of Chern. He helped Chern to get a fellowship to follow Blaschke to study in Hamburg in 1934.\n\nChern wrote a doctoral thesis on web geometry under Blaschke. Emil Artin (1898-1962), Erich Hecke (1887-1947) and Erich Kähler (1906-2000) were also there. Blaschke worked on web geometry and integral geometry at that time. Chern started to read Seifert–Threlfall (1934) and Alexandroff–Hopf (1935).\n\nHe also started to learn integral geometry started by the formula of Morgan Crofton (1826-1915) on calculating length of a plane curve by counting the measure of a needle intersecting this curve.\n\nThe other founder of integral geometry was Johann Radon (1887-1956) who invented Radon transform which is now used extensively in medical imaging: reconstruct a geometric figure by slicing the figure by moving planes.\n\nChern was very much fond of integral geometry partially because of the tradition created by Radon who was in Hamburg many years ago and had created a tradition that inspired Blaschke.\n\nBoth Chern and Luis Santaló (1911-2001) were students of Blaschke around the same time. Santaló was a major leader on the subject after Blaschke. Perhaps this education influenced Chern's famous paper in 1939 on integral geometry.\n\nKähler\n\nErich Kähler\n\nIn Hamburg, Blaschke travelled quite often, so Chern spent more time to study with his assistant Erich Kähler. Kähler lectured on Cartan–Kähler theory, asEinführung in die Theorie der systeme von Differentialeichungen. At the beginning, the seminar was packed with people, including Blaschke, Artin and Hecke. But after two months, Chern was the only audience. He started to learn the power and intuition of the works of Élie Cartan (1869-1951).\n\nIn 1933, Kähler published the first paper where Kähler geometry was introduced. It is a remarkable paper as some very important concepts were introduced. He has computed the Ricci tensor of a Kähler metric to be the complex Hessian of the log of the volume form.\n\nKähler observed the condition of the metric to be Kähler–Einstein metric comes from solution of a complex Monge–Ampère equation, where he gave many examples.\n\nHe also proved that the Ricci form defines a closed form which gives rise to a de Rham homology class which is independent of the choice of the Kähler metric.\n\nThis is the first Chern form of the Kähler manifold.\n\nChern certainly was influenced by this paper as he was a student there.\n\nIn the last thirty years of his life, Chern told many students that he would like to spend his time to teach them the powerful concept of moving frames invented by Cartan.\n\nHe probably learned Cartan–Kähler from Kähler in Hamburg in 1934 when he was taking a class from Kähler where he ended up to be the only student in that class.\n\nCartan\n\nÉlie Cartan\n\nWhen Chern graduated, he earned a postdoctoral fellowship in 1936 to pursue further study in Europe. Blaschke advised him either stayed in Hamburg to study with Artin or to go to Paris to study with Cartan. He took the latter choice.\n\nIn 1936 to 1937, Chern went to Paris, to study with Cartan on moving frames (principle bundles, in modern terminology), the method of equivalence and more on Cartan–Kähler theory. He spent ten months in Paris and met Cartan every two weeks.\n\nChern went back to China in the summer of 1937. He spent a few years to study Cartan's work. He said that Cartan wrote more than six thousand pages in his whole life. Chern has read at least seventy to eighty percent of these works. Some of the works he read it over and over again. During the War, it is great to spend full time to read and think in isolation.\n\nChern got married in 1939 in Kumming. Next year, his wife was pregnant and she went with her father to Shanghai for the birth of their first born son. It shall wait for six years before Chern saw his son.\n\nChern's comment on Cartan\n\nChern mentioned the influence of Cartan on him in the following way:\n\nUndoubtedly one of the greatest mathematician of this century, his career was characterized by a rare harmony of genius and modesty.\n\nIn 1940, I was struggling in learning Cartan. I realized the central role to be played by the notion of a connection and wrote several papers associating a connection to a given geometrical structures.\n\nWeyl's comment on Cartan\n\nHermann Weyl (1885-1955) was a great mathematician of all time who studied with David Hilbert (1862-1943). His comment on Cartan was:\n\nCartan is undoubtedly the greatest living master in differential geometry. Nevertheless, I must admit that I found the book, like most of Cartan's papers, hard reading.\n\nHowever, Weyl said that he finally understood Cartan after Chern spent some time in IAS in Princeton.\n\nIt was Cartan, around 1901, who first formulated many local geometric problem as a generalization of the Pfaff problem (which was about describing the Lagrangian submanifolds associated to a contact 1-form).\n\nCartan proposed to consider, instead of a single 1-form, a collection\n\nof 1-forms on a manifold\n\n, and to find the conditions for finding the maximal submanifolds\n\nof\n\nto which all of the 1-forms in\n\npullback to be zero.\n\nHe found sufficient conditions for this, but had to use the Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem to solve a sequence of initial value problems to construct the maximal submanifolds, so his theory was only valid in the real-analytic category (which did not bother people that much at the time).\n\nThe equivalence problem\n\nIn modern terms, we would say that Cartan formulated his answer in terms of the algebra of the differential ideal on\n\ngenerated by the collection of 1-forms\n\n. Cartan's version of this result sufficed for (nearly) all of Cartan's applications.\n\nIn 1933, Kähler found that Cartan's theory could be naturally generalized to the case of a differential ideal on\n\nthat was generated by forms of arbitrary degree (not just 1-forms), and he reformulated Cartan's \"Test for Involutivity\" to cover this more general case. That is what became known as the Cartan–Kähler Theorem.\n\nThe tools of Cartan–Kähler theory has deep influence on the works of Chern. His skill on constructing forms for the Gauss–Bonnet theorem and the characteristic forms cannot be surpassed by any geometer that I knew of.\n\nIt is also interesting to know the history of non-abelian gauge theory, which are connections over vector bundles or principle bundles.\n\nIn the beginning of 20th century, Cartan recognized right away that the work of Levi-Civita (1873-1941) and Jan Arnoldus Schouten (1883-1971) could be generalized to cover \"covariant differentiation\" of many different kinds of tensor fields on manifolds endowed with geometric structures.\n\nIn fact, he had already worked out, in his method of equivalence, a general method for computing curvature invariants and canonical parallelizations of what we now recognize as principal bundles by the time of his famous papers on pseudo-groups in the early 1900s.\n\nThroughout the early 1920s, he published papers about intrinsic \"connections\" on manifolds endowed with (pseudo-)Riemannian, conformal, or projective structures, as well as many others (which he called \"generalized spaces\").\n\nIn his 1926 book on Riemannian geometry, he did talk about covariant differentiation of tensor fields.\n\nOf course, when Chern published the theory of Chern forms in 1946, he knew unitary connections on bundles. Both Ehresmann (1905-1979) and Chern has written detailed survey paper for connections over general bundles in 1950. In fact, Chern gave the planetary talk on connections in 1950 in the international congress of mathematics in Harvard.\n\nChern summerizes works about connections in general vector bundles in 1950 when Chern gave a planetary speech in the international congress of mathematics in 1950 in Harvard, where he explained the general theory in great detail.\n\nIn fact, when Chern left China in late 1948 and arrived in Princeton in the new year of 1949, he gave a series of lectures in the Veblen Seminar in the Institute for Advanced Study. The lectures were written up in 1951 when Chern was in Chicago. The title was called:Topics in differential geometry.\n\nHe explained clearly the works of Cartan and himself on connections and characteristic classes for general vector bundles. (The subject is called non-abelian gauge theory by physicists and was founded and pioneered by Weyl in 1928. Weyl coined the term of gauge principle to explain the basic law behind matter.)\n\nIn 1954, C.-N. Yang (1922-) and Robert Mills (1927-1999) applied this theory to explain isospin in particle physics. But since they did not know how to quantize the theory, they did not know how to compute the mass as was pointed out by Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958) who had also developed the non abelian version of Weyl's gauge theory.\n\nApparently, all of Pauli, Yang and Mills did not know the works of Cartan, Chern and others despite Yang was student in Chicago and postdoctoral fellow in Princeton at the time when Chern was there. Yang's father, Wuzhi Yang (1896-1973), was also a teacher of Chern.\n\nLet us now explain in more details of Chern's works in geometry. Most of the works of Chern are related to problem of equivalence, which dated back to Riemann (1826-1866). In 1869, Christoffel (1829-1900) and Lipschitz (1832-1903) solved a special form of equivalence problem in Riemannian geometry. It was also called the form problem:\n\nTo decided when two\n\ndiffer by a change of coordinate.\n\nChristoffel introduced the covariant differentiation now called Levi-Civita connection.\n\nIt was Cartan who formulated a more general form of equivalence problem which can be stated in the following:\n\nGiven two sets of linear differential forms\n\n,\n\nin the coordinates\n\n,\n\nrespectively, where\n\nboth linearly independent. Given a Lie group\n\n, find the conditions that there are functions\n\nsuch that\n\n, after the substitution of these functions, differ from\n\nby a transformation of\n\n.\n\nThe problem generally involves local invariants, and Cartan gave a procedure to generate such invariants.\n\nChern's work (1932–1943)\n\nChern continued the tradition of Cartan and applied the Cartan–Kähler theory to solve various geometric questions related to equivalence problem. For example, in projective differential geometry, he is interested in the following question:\n\nFind a complete system of local invariants of a submanifold under the projective group and interpret them geometrically through osculation by simple geometrical figures.\n\nChern studied web geometry, projective line geometry, invariants of contact pairs of submanifolds in projective space, transformations of surfaces (related to in Bäcklund transform soliton theory).\n\nAnother typical problem in projective differential geometry is to study the geometry of path structure by normal projective connections.\n\nArthur Tresse (1868-1958) (a student of Sophius Lie (1842-1899)) studied paths defined by integral curves of\n\nby normal projective connections in space\n\n.\n\nChern generalized this to\n\n-dimension: Given\n\n-dimensional family of curves satisfying a differential system such that through any point and tangent to any direction at the point, there is exactly one such curve. Chern defines a normal projective connection. He then extended it to families of submanifolds.\n\nThe first major work that Chern did was in 1939 where he studied integral geometry which was developed by Crofton, Blaschke. Chern observed that such theory can be best understood in terms of two homogeneous spaces with the same Lie group\n\n. Hence there are two subgroups\n\nand\n\nTwo cosets\n\nand\n\nare incident to each other if they intersect in\n\n. Important geometric quantities in\n\ncan be pulled back to\n\nand then pushes forward to be interesting geometric quantities in\n\n. This work proceeded the important works of the Russian school led by Israel Gelfand (1913-2009) and the works of Shigeru Mukai (1953-). The transformations defined this way is sometimes called the Fourier–Mukai transformation.\n\nIn his work in integral geometry, Chern generalized several important formula of Crofton and much later, he uses this setting to generalize the kinematic formula of Poincaré (1854-1912), Santaló and Blaschke.\n\nAndré Weil (1906-1998) commented on this work of Chern that it lifted the whole subject at one stroke to a higher plane than where Blaschke's school had lift it. I was impressed by the unusual talent and depth of understanding that shone through it.\n\nWeil was so impressed by this paper of Chern that he wrote to Weyl about Chern. As a result, Veblen and Weyl recommended IAS of Princeton to invite Chern for a visit. The offer was 1500 dollars per year.\n\nWhile Chern was a faculty in Tsinghua University, he was also working with Prof. Lifu Jiang to form the institute of mathematics in Academia Sinica. Several prominent mathematicians were also appointed in this institute: Buqing Su (1902-2003), Jiangong Chen (1893-1971), Zehan Jiang (1902-1994), Luogeng Hua (1910-1985).\n\nChern left Kumming to Princeton in the July of 1943. On his way to Princeton, he passed India, where he gave four talks in University of Calcutta.\n\nHe came back to China in 1946 April by boat to Shanghai where he met his wife after 6 years and his son first time.\n\nChern's visit of Princeton (1943)\n\nIn 1943, Chern went from Kumming to Princeton, invited by Oswald Veblen and Weyl. This was during the war time. It took him seven days to fly by military aircraft from Kumming to Miami via India, Africa and South America. He arrived at Princeton in August by train. (It took him five years before he meet his new born son again.)\n\nWeyl was his hero. But it was Weil who suggested him to look into Fiber bundle theory of Cartan and Whitney (1907-1989). Weil pointed out that Stiefel–Whitney classes were only defined mod two. But there were works of Todd and Eger that constructed certain classes that are well-defined without mod two.\n\nJohn Arthur Todd (1908-1994) publishes his work:The geometric invariants of algebraic lociin 1937 on Todd class in Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society.\n\nMax Eger published his workSur les systèms canoniques d'une variété algébrique à plusieurs dimensionsin 1943 in Annales Scientifique de l'École Normale Supérieure.\n\nWeil just published his work on Gauss–Bonnet formula and told Chern the works of Todd and Eger on \"canonical classes\" in algebraic geometry (These works were done in the spirit of Italian geometers and rested on some unproved assumptions).\n\nThe Chern–Gauss–Bonnet formula\n\nChern told everybody his best work was his intrinsic proof of Gauss–Bonnet formula. Here is a brief history of the formula:\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) did it for geodesic triangle (1827):Disquistiones Circa superficies Curvas. He considered surface in\n\nand used Gauss map.\n\nPierre Ossian Bonnet (1819-1892) in 1848 generalized to any simply connected domain bounded by an arbitrary curve:Mémoire sur la théorie générale des surfaces.\n\nWalther von Dyck (1856-1943) in 1888 generalized it to arbitrary genus:Beiträge zur analysis situs.\n\nHeinz Hopf (1894-1971) generalized the formula to codimension one hypersurfaces in\n\n.\n\nCarl B. Allendoerfer (1911-1974) in 1940 and Werner Fenchel (1905-1988) studied closed orientable Riemannian manifold which can be embedded in Euclidean space.\n\nC.B. Allendoerfer and Weil in 1943 extended the formula to closed Riemannian polyhedron and hence to general closed Riemannian manifold inThe Gauss-Bonnet theorem for Riemannian polyhedra.\n\nBut the proof of Allendoerfer–Weil depends on the possibility of isometric embedding of the manifold into Euclidean spaces. This was only established about 15 years later by John Nash (1928-2015).\n\nWeil in his comment in the introduction of Chern's selected works made the following comments:\n\nFollowing the footsteps of Weyl and other writers, the latter proof, resting on the consideration of \"tubes\", did depend (although this was not apparent at that time) on the construction of an sphere-bundle, but of a non-intrinsic one, viz. the transversal bundle for a given immersion.\n\nChern's proof operated explicitly for the first time with an intrinsic bundle, the bundle of tangent vectors of length one, thus clarifying the whole subject once and for all.\n\nThe proof of Chern–Gauss–Bonnet formula\n\nLet us explain what Chern did: in the simplest two dimensional case, he wrote, in terms of moving frame, the structure equation for a surface is\n\nwhere\n\nis the connection form and\n\nis the Gauss curvature.\n\nIf the unit vector\n\nis given by a globally defined vector field\n\nby\n\nat points where\n\n, then we can apply Stokes' formula to obtain\n\nwhere\n\nis a small disk around\n\nwith\n\n. Eachterm in the right hand side of (1) can be computed via the index of the vector field of\n\nat\n\n. According to the theorem of Hopf and Poincaré, summation of indices of a vector field is the Euler number. This proof of Chern is new even in two dimension. In higher-dimensional proof, the bundle is the unit tangent sphere bundle.\n\nThe curvature form\n\nis skew-symmetric. The Pfaffian is\n\nThe Gauss–Bonnet formula is\n\nChern managed to find, by tour de force, a canonical form\n\non the unit sphere bundle so that\n\nis the lift of\n\n. This beautiful construction is called transgression and played an important role in topology theory of fiber bundle. This construction is very important. When it applies to the Pontryagin forms, it gives rises to the Chern–Simons forms, a joint work with Jim Simons (1938-) twenty some yearslater.\n\nInvention on Chern Classes\n\nIn the preface to Chern's selected works, Weil said that when Chern arrived in Princeton in 1943, both of them were deeply impressed by the works of Cartan and the masterly presentation by Kähler in the following paper:Einführung in die Theorie der Systeme von Differentialgleichungen(1934).\n\nBoth of them realized the importance of fiber bundles in geometry. Then Weil told Chern to look into the \"canonical classes\" in algebraic geometry introduced by Todd and Eger.\n\nTheir work resembled the Stiefel–Whitney classes, but do not need to define mod 2. On the other hand, the works of these two authors were done in the spirit of Italian geometers and rested on some unproved assumptions.\n\nWeil did not seem to realize that Chern was also influenced by two works of Lev Pontryagin (1908-1988)\n\nCharacteristic cycles on manifolds,, C.R.(Doklady) Acad. Sci. URSS35(1942), 34-37, and\n\nOn some topological invariants of Riemannian manifolds, C.R.(Doklady) Acad. Sci. URSS(N.S.)43(1944), 91-94.\n\nLev Pontryagin\n\nThese two papers were mentioned by Chern in the preface of his paper on Chern classes. In the second paper, Pontryagin has introduced closed forms defined by curvature form. He proved that the de Rham cohomology defined by the closed form is independent of the metric that defines the curvature forms.\n\nApparently Pontryagin did not know how to integrate his curvature forms in Schubert cells to identify the cohomology classes they represented with the same classes that he defined topologically. Chern attempted to solve this problem left in the work of Pontryagin, after he succeeded in giving the intrinsic proof of the Gauss–Bonnet formula.\n\nHe did not succeed to carry out the calculation for the real Grassmannians, whose cell structure is more complicated. He did it for the complex Grassmanians.\n\nChern said: My introduction to characteristic class was through the Gauss–Bonnet formula, known to every student of surfaces theory. Long before 1943, when I gave an intrinsic proof of the\n\n-dimensional Gauss–Bonnet formula, I know, by using orthonormal frames in surface theory, that the classical Gauss–Bonnet is but a global consequence of the Gauss formula which expresses the \"Theorema Egregium\".\n\nThe algebraic aspect of this proof is the first instance of a construction later known as transgression, which is destined to play a fundamental role in the homology theory of fiber bundle, and in other problems.\n\nCartan's work on frame bundles and de Rham's theorem have been always behind Chern's thinking. The history of fiber bundle can be briefed as follows:\n\nStiefel in 1936 and Whitney in 1937 introduced Stiefel–Whitney classes. It is only defined mod two.\n\nJacques Feldbau (1914-1945) in 1939, Ehresmann in 1941, 1942, 1943, Chern in 1944, 1945, and Norman Steenrod (1910-1971) in 1944 studied topology of fiber bundles.\n\nPontrjagin in 1942 introduced Pontrjagin classes. He also associated topological invariants to curvature of Riemannian manifolds in 1944 (Doklady).\n\nIn the proof of Gauss–Bonnet formula, Chern uses one vector field and look at its set of zero to find the Euler characteristic of the manifold.\n\nIf we replace a single vector field by\n\nvector fields\n\nin general position, they are linearly independent form a\n\n-dimensional cycle whose homology class is independent of the choice of\n\n. This was done by Stiefel (1909-1978) in his thesis (1936).\n\nChern considered similar procedure for complex vector bundles. In the proof of Gauss–Bonnet formula, he used curvature forms to represent the Euler class by zero set of vector field. It is therefore natural to do the same for the other Chern classes using set of degeneracy for\n\nvector fields.\n\nWhitney in 1937 considered sections for more general sphere bundles, beyond tangent bundles, and looked at it from the point of view of obstruction theory.\n\nHe noticed the importance of the universal bundle over the Grassmannian\n\nof\n\nplanes in\n\n.\n\nHe in 1937 showed that any rank\n\nbundle over the manifold\n\ncan be induced by a map\n\nfrom this bundle.\n\nWhen\n\nis large, Pontrjagin in 1942 and Steenrod (1910-1971) in 1944 observed that the map\n\nis defined up to homotopy. The characteristic classes of the bundle is given by\n\nThe cohomology\n\nwas studied by Ehresmann in 1936 and they are generated by Schubert cells.\n\nIn a recollection of his own works in the nineties, Chern said that it was a trivial observation and a stroke of luck, when I saw in 1944 that the situation for complex vector bundles is far simpler, because most of the classical complex spaces, such as the classical complex Grassmann manifolds, the complex Stiefel manifolds, etc. have no torsion.\n\nFor a complex vector bundle\n\n, the Chern classes Chern defined are in three different ways: by obstruction theory, by Schubert cells and by curvature forms of a connection on the bundle. He proved their equivalences.\n\nAlthough the theory of Chern classes have a much bigger impact than his proof of Gauss–Bonnet theorem. Chern considered his proof of Gauss–Bonnet formula to be his best work. The formula was in fact carved in his Tomb stone in Nankai University.\n\nI believe the reason is that he got his idea of Chern classes from the Gauss–Bonnet theorem. Also in his proof of Gauss–Bonnet formula, he started to appreciate the power on study the geometry of forms on the intrinsic sphere bundle of tangent vectors with length one.\n\nIn the approach based on obstruction theory, it is parallel to the way that Stiefel generalized Hopf's vector field theory to Stiefel–Whitney classes by looking at them as an obstruction to multi vector fields that are linearly independent. As for the curvature forms, the representations of Chern classes by curvature forms are clear analogue with Gauss–Bonnet formula. Therefore Chern did the Chern form for unitary connections.\n\nWhen Weil reported his work in Bourbaki Seminar, Weil formulated it so that it applies to connections based on connections with any compact Lie group.\n\nAccording to Chern himself, he knew the formula for general\n\n-connections. But he did not know the proof that the cohomology classes are independent of the choice of connections. In a way, this is surprising, because Weil simply forms a family of connections joining linearly two connections together, and then differentiates the characteristics forms defined by the connections in this family and obtains its transgression form.\n\nThis kind of idea was used by Kähler in 1933 to prove that the first Chern class as represented by the Ricci curvature form is independent of the Kähler metric. The same idea was also used by Pontryagin to prove similar statement for Pontryagin classes.\n\nIn 1945, Chern was invited to give a plenary address in the summer meeting of American Mathematical Society. His report appeared in 1946 in Bulletin of American Math Society52. It is titled:Some new view points in the differential geometry in the large.\n\nIn the mathematical review of this paper, Hopf wrote that Chern's work had ushered in a new era in global differential geometry.\n\nChern returned to China in April of 1946 where he became the deputy director of mathematics Institute for Academia Sinica in Nanking.\n\nIn this period and also in the period when he was teaching in Tsinghua University as part of Southwest Associated University in Kumming, he trained a few young Chinese mathematicians that were influential in China. The most notable mathematicians were Hsien-Chung Wang (1918-1978), Kuo-Tsai Chen (1923-1987) and Wen-Tsun Wu (1919-2017). They made contributions to topology.\n\nChern also proved that the Chern classes of algebraic bundles are represented by algebraic cycles. This statement was known to Hodge for algebraic hypersurfaces.\n\nWhen Friedrich Hirzebruch (1927-2012) was writing his paperTransferring some theorems of algebraic surfaces to complex manifolds of two complex dimension(1953), he noticed that some of the results of that paper could have been generalized to higher dimensions. But the so-called duality formula was not yet proved. This formula says that the total Chern class of the direct sum of two complex vector bundles equals the product of the total Chern classes of the summands.\n\nHirzebruch's paper has a remark written during proofreading that Chern and Kunihiko Kodaira (1915-1997) told Hirzebruch that the duality formula is proved in a forthcoming paper of Chern:On the characteristic classes of complex spherebundles and algebraic varieties(1953).\n\nKunihiko Kodaira (left), Friedrich Hirzebruch (right)\n\nHirzebruch: My two years (1952-1954) at the Institute for Advanced Study were formative for my mathematical career. I had to study and develop fundamental properties of Chern classes, introduced the Chern character, which later (joint work with Michael Atiyah (1929-2019)) became a functor from\n\n-theory to rational cohomology.\n\nThe fundamental paper of Chern (1946)\n\nIn the paper,Characteristic classes of Hermitian manifolds, Chern also laid the foundation of Hermitian geometry on complex manifolds. The concept of Hermitian connections was introduced.\n\nIf\n\nis the curvature form of the vector bundle, one defines\n\nThe advantage of defining Chern classes by differential forms have tremendous importance in geometry and in modern physics.\n\nAn example is the concept of transgression created by Chern. Let\n\nbe the connection form defined on the frame bundle associated to the vector bundle. Then the curvature form is computed via\n\nand hence\n\nSimilarly, we have\n\nThis term\n\nis called Chern–Simons form and has played fundamental role in three dimensional manifolds, in anomaly cancellation, in string theory and in solid state physics.\n\nThe idea of doing transgression on form level also gives rise to a secondary operation on homology, e.g. Massey product. It appeared in K.T. Chen's work on iterated integral.\n\nWhen the manifold is a complex manifold, we can write\n\n. In a fundamental paper, Raoul Bott (1923-2005) and Chern (1965) found: for each\n\nthere is a canonically constructed\n\n-form\n\nso that\n\nRaoul Bott\n\nChern made use of this theorem to generalize Nevanlinna theory of value distribution to holomorphic maps between higher dimensional complex manifolds. The form\n\nplays a fundamental role in Arekelov theory.\n\nSimon Donaldson (1957-) used the case\n\nto prove the Donaldson–Uhlenbeck–Yau theorem for the existence of hermitian Yang–Mills equations on algebraic surfaces. For\n\n,\n\nwhere\n\nis the hermitian metric. The right hand side is the Ricci tensor of the metric.\n\nSimon Donaldson (left), Karen Uhlenbeck (right)\n\nThe simplicity of the first Chern form motivates the Calabi conjecture. The simplicity and beauty of geometry over complex number can not be exaggerated.\n\nChern (IAS in 1949 and later in Chicago)\n\nAfter the fundamental paper on Chern classes in 1946, he explored more details on the multiplicative structure of the characteristic classes.\n\nIn 1951, he had a paper with Edwin Spanier (1921-1996) on the Gysin sequence on fiber bundle. They proved the Thom isomorphism independently of René Thom (1923-2002).\n\nEdwin Spanier (left), René Thom (right)\n\nSplitting principle\n\nIn the paper (1953),On the characteristic classes of complex sphere bundle and algebraic varieties, Chern showed that by considering an associated bundle with the flag manifold as fibers the characteristic classes can be defined in terms of line bundles.\n\nAs a consequence the dual homology class of a characteristic class of an algebraic manifold contains a representative of algebraic cycle.\n\nThis paper provides the splitting principle in\n\n-theory and coupled with Thom isomorphism allows one to give the definition of Chern classes on the associated bundle as was done by Alexander Grothendieck (1928-2014) later.\n\nHodge has considered the problem of representing homology classes by algebraic cycles. He considered the above theorem of Chern and was only able to prove it when the manifold is complete intersection of nonsingular hypersufaces in a projective space.\n\nChern's theorem is the first and the only general statement for the \"Hodge conjecture\". It also gives the first direct link between holomorphic\n\n-theory and algebraic cycles.\n\nChern's ability to create invariants for important geometric structure is unsurpassed by any mathematicians that I have ever known. His works on projective differential geometry, on affine geometry, on Chern–Moser invariants for pseudo-convex domains demonstrate his strength.\n\nThe intrinsic norm on cohomology of complex manifolds that he defined with Harold Levine (1922-2017) and Louis Nirenberg (1925-2020) has not been fully exploited yet.\n\nBefore he died, a major program for him was to carry out Cartan–Kähler system for more general geometric situation.\n\nIn 1957, Chern wrote a paper called:On a generalization of Kähler geometry. In effect, he was looking for geometry with special holonomy groups. But at that time, he could not find interesting examples, beyond Kähler geometry.\n\nOn the other hand, in his review article on a book by André Lichnerowicz (1915-1998) in 1955 called:Theorie globale des connexions et dea groupers d’holonomie. Chern pointed out that the classical works of Cartan pointed to the fact that the group concept is the basic underlying idea behind the work of Levi-Civita and Schouten (1883-1971) on the theory of connections.\n\nHe also wrote that people had confusion of Cartan's terminology. Cartan's \"tangent space\" is a fiber in the modern terminology and his space of moving frame is what is now called a principal fiber bundle.\n\nIn this review, he made a comment which did not come out as he thought. He said: the holonomy group is a very natural notion in the theory of connections. However, recent investigations by Marcel Berger (1927-2016) and Isadore Singer (1924-2021) have shown that its possibilities are rather limited. Except for homogeneous spaces, It is perhaps not a strong invariant.\n\nMany years ago, Singer told me that both Warren Ambrose (1914-1995) and him attended the class taught by Chern in geometry in Chicago when they were graduate students together in Chicago.\n\nAfterwards, they managed to prove what we call Ambrose–Singer theorem which identifies the Lie algebra of the holonomy group by relating it with curvature tensors.\n\nBerger in France developed this idea further and classified all possible Lie group that may appear as holonomy group in Riemannian Geometry (a more conceptual proof was given by Simons later).\n\nHolonomy groups were introduced by Cartan in 1926. It gives rise to the concept of internal symmetry of the manifold and it gives geometric meaning of what modern physicists called supersymmetry.\n\nKähler manifolds are those whose holonomy group is a unitary group. Calabi–Yau manifolds are those with manifolds whose holonomy group is a special unitary group.\n\nTo the contrary of what Chern expected, manifolds with special holonomy has been one of the most fascinating manifolds in modern geometry. The construction of such manifolds depend on nonlinear analysis which Chern was not very familiar with.\n\nIt may be interested to note that Chern gave a course on Hodge theory for Kähler manifolds in Chicago using potential theory after the works of Kodaria.\n\nBut in late sixties, Chern wrote a booklet calledComplex manifold without potential theory. For some reason, Chern gave up his interest in the direction in Kähler geometry pioneered by Kodaria starting on the proof of vanishing theorems.\n\nIn the late fifties, Chern studied to show interest in the old classical subject of minimal surfaces. His works largely followed the works of Jean Gaston Darboux (1842-1917), Cartan, and others, which was more local in nature.\n\nHowever he was immediately attracted by the works of Eugenio Calabi (1923-) in the global theory of minimal two spheres in higher-dimensional spheres.\n\nChern and Calabi\n\nHe observed that the Gauss map mapping minimal surfaces in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces into the Grassmanian of two planes in higher-dimensional Euclidean space, is anti-holomorphic. Hence one can apply the theory of holomorphic curves to minimal surfaces theory to reprove the work of Bernstein–Osserman on minimal surfaces (Note that the Grassmanian of two planes has a natural complex structure).\n\nHis lectures on minimal surfaces in Berkeley influenced the important works of Simons on higher-dimensional minimal subvarities by making important contribution towards the stability questions on minimal cones which in turns solves some part of the Bernstein problem which gave better understanding of singularity of minimal subvarities.\n\nIn particular, Simons made an important contribution towards the Bernstein problem in this theory which gave better understanding of singularity of minimal subvarities.\n\nThe last most important works that Chern did in the seventies were his work with Simons, now called , and his work with Jürgen Moser (1928-1999), now called for strongly pseudoconvex manifolds.\n\nJürgen Moser\n\nThe first work was motivated by the idea of transgression started in his proof of Gauss–Bonnet formula. It has become a corner stone for works in theoretical physics and condensed matter. The last work continued the unfinished works of Cartan on construction of local invariants of domains invariant under biholomorphic transformations.\n\nThe Chern-Simons form has became very important in theoretical physics in the past forty years. We briefly outline its development below:\n\nIn 1978, Albert Schwarz (1934-) introduced a topological quantum field theory that includes Chern-Simons theory. The paper is calledThe partition function of degenerate quadratic functional and Ray-Singer invariants, (1978).\n\nIn 1981, Roman Jackiw (1939-) and his student Stephen Templeton studied 3D QED with the Chern-Simon term and, in 1982, non-Abelian gauge theory and 3D Einstein gravity.\n\nIn 1981, Laughlin (1950-) wrote about quantized Hall conductivity in two dimensions and in 1983 on the fractional quantum Hall effect where low energy can be described by the Chern-Simons term. This was followed by Wilczek (1951-), Zee (1945-), Polyakov (1945-), and others.\n\nWitten (1951-) developed the 3D Chern-Simons as a quantum theory related to the Jones polynomial. This paper of Witten prompted a great deal of investigation of knot theory, including the so-called volume conjecture for three dimensional hyperbolic manifolds. The influence of Chern-Simons theory and its applications in modern condensed matter physics is so vast and overwhelming that there is simply not enough space to report on that here.\n\nXiaogang Wen (1961-) (also done at IAS 1990) introduced the concept of topological order (how condensed matter people called) as the realization of TQFT and Chern-Simons theory in quantum matter, in general dimensions.\n\nAfter these two important works, Chern was still active, continuing to write several papers on different topics including web geometry, harmonic maps into complex Grassmannians, and Lie sphere geometry. But they are less consequential in comparison to his previously mentioned works. This is probably natural as Chern was then in his 70s --- an age when mathematicians, even the most extraordinary ones, rarely make their biggest contributions.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen I was a student, Chern told me that he is interested in mathematics because it is fun and is the only thing he knew how to do. He feels that he can master very complicated calculation as was shown in his proof of Gauss–Bonnet theorem.\n\nDespite of his tremendous influence in modern geometry, he said that he did not have a global vision as people would think that he is guided by it. He just followed his intuition to have fun. And he emphasized how important it was to him to have friends with brilliant minds.\n\nChern: The importance of complex numbers in geometry is a mystery to me. It is well-organized and complete.\n\nChern always regret that ancient Chinese mathematicians never discovered complex number. Chern's everlasting works in complex geometry make up the loss of Chinese mathematics for the last two thousand years.\n\nAt the last part of his life, Chern tried to promote Finsler geometry. He wrote a book with David Bao and Zhongmin Shen in the subject. Since there is no concrete example of Finsler geometry to model, they had difficulty to develop their theory with great depth.\n\nIn particular, they were not able to apply their theory to the concrete example of Finsler geometry appeared in Teichmüller space or in Kobayashi hyperbolic manifolds.\n\nIn Riemann's thesis, he thought about the possibility of replacing Riemannian metrics defined by quadratic differentials by quartic differentials, presumably to handle geometry of space which is far apart.\n\nIt will be interested to know whether rich geometry can be developed based on quartic differentials. One has to solve the equivalence problem, i.e., to find complete invariants to determine whether two quartic differential are equal up to change of variables.\n\nIronically, while Chern was a great admirer of Riemann, Cartan, Weyl and Weil, he did not think highly of Einstein and was slow in reaction to the ideas coming from theoretical physics.\n\nHe showed no interest in the part of geometry related to quantum field theory. The dream of Riemann to understand space of extremely small needs full understanding of quantum field theory and perhaps a new form of quantum geometry.\n\nBut he is flexible in general. When I mentioned to him that I was working on Calabi's conjecture, he did not think much of it until he realized that it could be used to solved problems that he wanted to solve in algebraic geometry.\n\nSince then, he realized the power of nonlinear analysis in geometry. This was reflected by the series of international conference called \"Conference on Differential Geometry and Differential Equations\", organized by him after he returned to China.\n\nChern devoted last part of his life to the development of mathematics in China. In fact, he built an excellent center of mathematics in Nankai University. Big efforts were made by him from 1984 to 2004 until he died. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to find a good successor after he passed away.\n\nThere is no question that Chern is a great mathematician and will always be remembered in the history of mathematics, especially on his contributions to the theory of fiber bundle and its characteristic classes.■\n\nWater Dragon Chant\n\n(On the Birth Centenary of Late Mentor Shiing-Shen Chern)\n\nRaising my head to see the clouds dispersing a thousand miles,\n\nin the boundless sky the vast galaxy hangs.\n\nNight is silent and lamplight dusky,\n\nremembrance so endless runs, whether or not his soul returns?\n\nNankai by the Po Hai Sea, Tsinghua of water and groves,\n\nboth are still blessed with handsome talents.\n\nLonging to climb high and look far away,\n\ninto the wilderness of the cosmos, the past in remote distance,\n\nwho remembers?\n\nRecalling Chu Shun-shui* fleeing to Japan,\n\nearning immortal fame with his influence,\n\nembodying the quintessence of the Han’s.\n\nPouring out mathematical thinking as water falls,\n\neternally worshipped by the entire world, his unparalleled attainments.\n\nThe master lived into his nineties, natural, simple, clear, noble,\n\nall those whirling years.\n\nWeighing achievements,\n\non a pair with the Tsu father and son and Ch’in Chiu-shao’s,\n\nin geometry stand Chern classes.\n\n—— Shing-Tung Yau, August 12, 2010.\n\nRemark: *Shiing-Shen Chern first officially published paper was printed on Tohoku Mathematical Journal of Japan in 1935:Triads of rectilinear congruences with generators in correspondence, Tohoku Math.
