        "text": "A brief Description of the school\n\nOne can trace the history of Algebraic topology back to the Konesberg’s seven bridges problem and Euler’s solution to that. Poincare used the notion of Betti number for studying manifolds. Once the notion of Algebraic Topology was put in sound modern algebraic setting by Noether the subject advanced by leaps and bounds. Fundamental groups was instrumental in distinguishing R^2 and R^3 upto homeomorphism where as homology groups were instrumental in distinguishing R^3 and R^4 and so on, For distinguishing more and more topological objects more and more sophisticated tools like cohomology, Steenrod operations and more and more different notions of generalized cohomology theories, primary , secondary and higher cohomology operations etc. have been invented. An obstruction theory for extending and lifting of maps have been developed, in a way the operations mentioned above are offshoots of this. Characteristic classes and numbers were developed to classify manifolds upto cobordism. These developments also helped in developing powerful surgery techniques to classify manifolds upto diffeomorphism, pl-homeomorphism and homeomorphism. Another major development is the use of spectral sequence to compute (generalized) (co)homology of a space in terms of the knowledge of (generalized) (co)homology of some associated spaces or associated (co)homology theories of the given space. It also helped in computing stable homotopy groups classifying spaces and sphere. Algebraic topology together with the techniques from geometry and analysis and physics has give rise to new (co)homology theories which have helped in settling old conjectures like the triangulation conjecture. String topology is another promising field attracting attention of a large number of researchers.\n\nThe purpose of the AIS would be to expose these topics in a condensed and yet lucid fashion, help students in digesting the topics through tutorials, to direct the development towards some interesting outstanding problems in the subject and also towards applications which are under intensive current development process.\n\nPrerequisite:\n\nIt is expected that the participants of the AIS-Algebraic topology 2016 have undergone the material covered in the AFS-III, in algebraic topology as given below. These topics will be assumed and further topics built on these will be taken up.\n\nAFS-III syllabus: Algebraic Topology:\n\nStatements of basic problems in algebraic topology extension problems and lifting problems; homotopy, relative homotopy, deformation,contraction, retracts etc. Typical constructions: Adjunction spaces, Mapping cones, Mapping cylinder, Smash-product, reduced cones reduced suspension etc. Categories and Functors.
