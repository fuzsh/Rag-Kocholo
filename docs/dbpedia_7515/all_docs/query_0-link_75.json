Our construction extends the linear typed lambda calculus with a linear negation of \"trivialised\" De Morgan duality. Reduction is realised through explicit substitution, based on a symmetric notion of binding of global scope, with rules acting on the entire typing judgement instead of on a specific subterm. Proofs of subject reduction, confluence, strong normalisation and consistency are provided, and the language is shown to be an internal language for dagger compact categories.\n\nA Type System for the Vectorial Aspect of the Linear-Algebraic Lambda-Calculus\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPablo Arrighi\n\n2012-07-01\n\nFull Text Available We describe a type system for the linear-algebraic lambda-calculus. The type system accounts for the part of the language emulating linear operators and vectors, i.e. it is able to statically describe the linear combinations of terms resulting from the reduction of programs. This gives rise to an original type theory where types, in the same way as terms, can be superposed into linear combinations. We show that the resulting typed lambda-calculus is strongly normalizing and features a weak subject-reduction.\n\nProgramming Language Concepts - The Lambda Calculus Approach\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nFokkinga, M.M.; Asveld, P.R.J.; Nijholt, Antinus\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe Lambda Calculus is a formal system, originally intended as a tool in the foundation of mathematics, but mainly used to study the concepts of algorithm and effective computability. Recently, the Lambda Calculus and related systems acquire attention from Computer Science for another reason too:\n\nA Step-indexed Semantic Model of Types for the Call-by-Name Lambda Calculus\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMeurer, Benedikt\n\n2011-01-01\n\nStep-indexed semantic models of types were proposed as an alternative to purely syntactic safety proofs using subject-reduction. Building upon the work by Appel and others, we introduce a generalized step-indexed model for the call-by-name lambda calculus. We also show how to prove type safety of general recursion in our call-by-name model.\n\nExtending the Extensional Lambda Calculus with Surjective Pairing is Conservative\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nStÃ¸vring, Kristian\n\n2006-01-01\n\nWe answer Klop and de Vrijer's question whether adding surjective-pairing axioms to the extensional lambda calculus yields a conservative extension. The answer is positive. As a byproduct we obtain a \"syntactic\" proof that the extensional lambda calculus with surjective pairing is consistent....\n\nUnification and matching in Church's Original Lambda Calculus\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nHustadt, U.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nIn current implementations of higher-order logics higher-orderunification is used to lift the resolution principle from the first-order case to the higher-order case. Higher-order matching is the core of implementations of higher-order rewriting systems and some systems for program transformation. In this paper I argue that Church's original lambda calculus, called non-forgetful lambda calculus, is an appropriate basis for higher-order matching. I provide two correct and complete algorithms f...\n\nA metric model of lambda calculus with guarded recursion\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nBirkedal, Lars; Schwinghammer, Jan; StÃ¸vring, Kristian\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe give a model for Nakanoâs typed lambda calculus with guarded recursive definitions in a category of metric spaces.

To make these calculi into a real programming language, one should also include data types. As a step into that direction, this paper defines a simply typed call-by-value lambda calculus with the control operators catch and throw, a data type of lists, and an operator for primitive recursion (a la Goedel's T. We prove that our system satisfies subject reduction, progress, confluence for untyped terms, and strong normalization for well-typed terms.\n\nThird-Order Matching in the Polymorphic Lambda Calculus\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nSpringintveld, J.\n\nWe show that it is decidable whether a third-order matching problem in the polymorphic lambda calculus has a solution. The proof is constructive in the sense that an algorithm can be extracted from it that, given such a problem, returns a substitution if it has a solution and fail otherwise.\n\nMaximal Sharing in the Lambda Calculus with Letrec\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nGrabmayer, C.A.; Rochel, J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIncreasing sharing in programs is desirable to compactify the code, and to avoid duplication of reduction work at run-time, thereby speeding up execution. We show how a maximal degree of sharing can be obtained for programs expressed as terms in the lambda calculus with letrec. We introduce a notion\n\nA fully-abstract semantics of lambda-mu in the pi-calculus\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSteffen van Bakel\n\n2014-09-01\n\nFull Text Available We study the lambda-mu-calculus, extended with explicit substitution, and define a compositional output-based interpretation into a variant of the pi-calculus with pairing that preserves single-step explicit head reduction with respect to weak bisimilarity. We define four notions of weak equivalence for lambda-mu â one based on weak reduction, two modelling weak head-reduction and weak explicit head reduction (all considering terms without weak head-normal form equivalent as well, and one based on weak approximation â and show they all coincide. We will then show full abstraction results for our interpretation for the weak equivalences with respect to weak bisimilarity on processes.\n\nA Typed Functional Calculus With State\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nRensink, Arend; MÃ¼llhÃ¤user, M.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nWe extend the simple typed \\\\lambda-calculus with statements.

Notions\n\nConfluence via strong normalisation in an algebraic Î»-calculus with rewriting\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPablo Buiras\n\n2012-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The linear-algebraic lambda-calculus and the algebraic lambda-calculus are untyped lambda-calculi extended with arbitrary linear combinations of terms. The former presents the axioms of linear algebra in the form of a rewrite system, while the latter uses equalities. When given by rewrites, algebraic lambda-calculi are not confluent unless further restrictions are added. We provide a type system for the linear-algebraic lambda-calculus enforcing strong normalisation, which gives back confluence. The type system allows an abstract interpretation in System F.\n\nElementary affine $lambda$-calculus with multithreading and side effects\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMadet, Antoine; Amadio, Roberto M.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nLinear logic provides a framework to control the complexity of higher-order functional programs. We present an extension of this framework to programs with multithreading and side effects focusing on the case of elementary time. Our main contributions are as follows. First, we provide a new combinatorial proof of termination in elementary time for the functional case. Second, we develop an extension of the approach to a call-by-value $lambda$-calculus with multithreading and side effects. Thi...\n\nContinuation calculus\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nGeron, B.; Geuvers, J.H.; de'Liguoro, U.; Saurin, A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nPrograms with control are usually modeled using lambda calculus extended with control operators. Instead of modifying lambda calculus, we consider a different model of computation. We introduce continuation calculus, or CC, a deterministic model of computation that is evaluated using only head\n\nA type system for Continuation Calculus\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHerman Geuvers\n\n2014-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Continuation Calculus (CC, introduced by Geron and Geuvers, is a simple foundational model for functional computation. It is closely related to lambda calculus and term rewriting, but it has no variable binding and no pattern matching. It is Turing complete and evaluation is deterministic. Notions like \"call-by-value\" and \"call-by-name\" computation are available by choosing appropriate function definitions: e.g. there is a call-by-value and a call-by-name addition function. In the present paper we extend CC with types, to be able to define data types in a canonical way, and functions over these data types, defined by iteration. Data type definitions follow the so-called \"Scott encoding\" of data, as opposed to the more familiar \"Church encoding\". The iteration scheme comes in two flavors: a call-by-value and a call-by-name iteration scheme. The call-by-value variant is a double negation variant of call-by-name iteration. The double negation translation allows to move between call-by-name and call-by-value.\n\nA General Schema for Constructing One-Point Bases in the Lambda Calculus\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nGoldberg, Mayer\n\n2001-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we present a schema for constructing one-point bases for recursively enumerable sets of lambda terms. The novelty of the approach is that we make no assumptions about the terms for which the one-point basis is constructed: They need not be combinators and they may contain constants...... and free variables. The significance of the construction is twofold: In the context of the lambda calculus, it characterises one-point bases as ways of ``packaging'' sets of terms into a single term; And in the context of realistic programming languages, it implies that we can define a single procedure...\n\nVerified Representations of Landau's \"Grundlagen\" in the lambda-delta Family and in the Calculus of Constructions\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFerruccio Guidi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Landau's \"Grundlagen der Analysis\" formalized in the language Aut-QE, represents an early milestone in computer-checked mathematics and is the only non-trivial development finalized in the languages of the Automath family. Here we discuss an implemented procedure producing a faithful representation of the Grundlagen in the Calculus of Constructions, verified by the proof assistant Coq 8.4.3. The point at issue is distinguishing lambda-abstractions from pi-abstractions where the original text uses Automath unified binders, taking care of the cases in which a binder corresponds to both abstractions at one time. It is a fact that some binders can be disambiguated only by verifying the Grundlagen in a calculus accepting Aut-QE and the Calculus of Constructions. To this end, we rely on lambda-delta version 3, a system that the author is proposing here for the first time.\n\nA Formal Calculus for Categories\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nCÃ¡ccamo, Mario JosÃ©\n\nThis dissertation studies the logic underlying category theory. In particular we present a formal calculus for reasoning about universal properties. The aim is to systematise judgements about functoriality and naturality central to categorical reasoning. The calculus is based on a language which...... extends the typed lambda calculus with new binders to represent universal constructions. The types of the languages are interpreted as locally small categories and the expressions represent functors. The logic supports a syntactic treatment of universality and duality. Contravariance requires a definition...... of universality generous enough to deal with functors of mixed variance. Ends generalise limits to cover these kinds of functors and moreover provide the basis for a very convenient algebraic manipulation of expressions. The equational theory of the lambda calculus is extended with new rules for the definitions...\n\nThe untyped stack calculus and Bohm's theorem\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlberto Carraro\n\n2013-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The stack calculus is a functional language in which is in a Curry-Howard correspondence with classical logic. It enjoys confluence but, as well as Parigot's lambda-mu, does not admit the Bohm Theorem, typical of the lambda-calculus. We present a simple extension of stack calculus which is for the stack calculus what Saurin's Lambda-mu is for lambda-mu.\n\nStandardization and Confluence in Pure Lambda-Calculus Formalized for the Matita Theorem Prover\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFerruccio Guidi\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available We present a formalization of pure lambda-calculus for the Matita interactive theorem prover, including the proofs of two relevant results in reduction theory: the confluence theorem and the standardization theorem. The proof of the latter is based on a new approach recently introduced by Xi and refined by Kashima that, avoiding the notion of development and having a neat inductive structure, is particularly suited for formalization in theorem provers.\n\nLabelled Lambda-calculi with Explicit Copy and Erase\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaribel FernÃ¡ndez\n\n2010-03-01\n\nFull Text Available We present two rewriting systems that define labelled explicit substitution lambda-calculi. Our work is motivated by the close correspondence between Levy's labelled lambda-calculus and paths in proof-nets, which played an important role in the understanding of the Geometry of Interaction. The structure of the labels in Levy's labelled lambda-calculus relates to the multiplicative information of paths; the novelty of our work is that we design labelled explicit substitution calculi that also keep track of exponential information present in call-by-value and call-by-name translations of the lambda-calculus into linear logic proof-nets.\n\nContinuation calculus\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBram Geron\n\n2013-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Programs with control are usually modeled using lambda calculus extended with control operators. Instead of modifying lambda calculus, we consider a different model of computation. We introduce continuation calculus, or CC, a deterministic model of computation that is evaluated using only head reduction, and argue that it is suitable for modeling programs with control. It is demonstrated how to define programs, specify them, and prove them correct. This is shown in detail by presenting in CC a list multiplication program that prematurely returns when it encounters a zero. The correctness proof includes termination of the program. In continuation calculus we can model both call-by-name and call-by-value. In addition, call-by-name functions can be applied to call-by-value results, and conversely.\n\nUnfolding Semantics of the Untyped Î»-Calculus with lectrec-Calculus with letrec\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nRochel, J.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe investigate the relationship between finite terms in lambda-letrec, the lambda calculus with letrec, and the infinite lambda terms they express. We say that a lambda-letrec term expresses a lambda term if the latter can be obtained as an infinite unfolding of the former. Unfolding is the process\n\nType Inference for Session Types in the Pi-Calculus\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nGraversen, Eva Fajstrup; Harbo, Jacob Buchreitz; Huttel, Hans\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn this paper we present a direct algorithm for session type inference for the Ï-calculus. Type inference for session types has previously been achieved by either imposing limitations and restriction on the Ï-calculus, or by reducing the type inference problem to that for linear types. Our approach...\n\nThe use of typed lambda calculus for comprehension and construction of simulation models in the domain of ecology\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nUschold, Michael\n\n1992-01-01\n\nWe are concerned with two important issues in simulation modelling: model comprehension and model construction. Model comprehension is limited because many important choices taken during the modelling process are not documented. This makes it difficult for models to be modified or used by others. A key factor hindering model construction is the vast modelling search space which must be navigated. This is exacerbated by the fact that many modellers are unfamiliar with the terms and concepts catered to by current tools. The root of both problems is the lack of facilities for representing or reasoning about domain concepts in current simulation technology. The basis for our achievements in both of these areas is the development of a language with two distinct levels; one for representing domain information, and the other for representing the simulation model. Of equal importance, is the fact that we make formal connections between these two levels. The domain we are concerned with is ecological modelling. This language, called Elklogic, is based on the typed lambda calculus. Important features include a rich type structure, the use of various higher order functions, and semantics. This enables complex expressions to be constructed from relatively few primitives. The meaning of each expression can be determined in terms of the domain, the simulation model, or the relationship between the two. We describe a novel representation for sets and substructure, and a variety of other general concepts that are especially useful in the ecological domain. We use the type structure in a novel way: for controlling the modelling search space, rather than a proof search space. We facilitate model comprehension by representing modelling decisions that are embodied in the simulation model. We represent the simulation model separately from, but in terms of a domain mode. The explicit links between the two models constitute the modelling decisions. The semantics of Elklogic enables\n\nOn Undefined and Meaningless in Lambda Definability\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nde Vries, Fer-Jan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe distinguish between undefined terms as used in lambda definability of partial recursive functions and meaningless terms as used in infinite lambda calculus for the infinitary terms models that generalise the Bohm model. While there are uncountable many known sets of meaningless terms, there are four known sets of undefined terms. Two of these four are sets of meaningless terms. In this paper we first present set of sufficient conditions for a set of lambda terms to se...\n\nEnriching an effect calculus with linear types\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nEgger, Jeff; MÃ¸gelberg, Rasmus Ejlers; Simpson, Alex\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWe define an ``enriched effect calculus'' by conservatively extendingÂ a type theory for computational effects with primitives from linear logic. By doing so, we obtain a generalisation of linear type theory, intended as a formalism for expressing linear aspects of effects. As a worked example, we...... formulateÂ linearly-used continuations in the enriched effect calculus. These are captured by a fundamental translation of the enriched effect calculus into itself, which extends existing call-by-value and call-by-name linearly-used CPS translations. We show that our translation is involutive. Full...... completeness results for the various linearly-used CPS translationsÂ follow. Our main results, the conservativity of enriching the effect calculus with linear primitives, and the involution property of the fundamental translation, are proved using a category-theoretic semantics for the enriched effect calculus...\n\nDouble-Lambda hypernuclei and the nuclear medium effective Lambda Lambda interaction\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nCaro, JosÃ©; GarcÃ­a Recio, Carmen; Nieves Pamplona, Juan Miguel\n\n1999-01-01\n\nWe fit the $^1 S_0 \\\\Lambda\\\\Lambda$ interaction in the nuclear medium to the masses of the experimentally known double-$\\\\Lambda$ hypernuclei: $^{\\\\phantom{6}6}_{\\\\Lambda\\\\Lambda}$He, $^{10}_{\\\\Lambda\\\\Lambda}$Be and $^{13}_{\\\\Lambda\\\\Lambda}$B. We derive this effective interaction from OBE J\\\\\"ulich $\\\\Lambda\\\\Lambda$-type potentials and using both Hartree-Fock and variational approaches. We find that the inclusion of $\\\\Lambda\\\\Lambda$ correlations in the variational scheme leads to significant differenc...\n\nSession Types in Abelian Logic\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYoichi Hirai\n\n2013-12-01\n\nFull Text Available There was a PhD student who says \"I found a pair of wooden shoes. I put a coin in the left and a key in the right. Next morning, I found those objects in the opposite shoes.\" We do not claim existence of such shoes, but propose a similar programming abstraction in the context of typed lambda calculi. The result, which we call the Amida calculus, extends Abramsky's linear lambda calculus LF and characterizes Abelian logic.\n\nPrincipal Typings in a Restricted Intersection Type System for Beta Normal Forms with De Bruijn Indices\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDaniel Ventura\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The lambda-calculus with de Bruijn indices assembles each alpha-class of lambda-terms in a unique term, using indices instead of variable names. Intersection types provide finitary type polymorphism and can characterise normalisable lambda-terms through the property that a term is normalisable if and only if it is typeable. To be closer to computations and to simplify the formalisation of the atomic operations involved in beta-contractions, several calculi of explicit substitution were developed mostly with de Bruijn indices. Versions of explicit substitutions calculi without types and with simple type systems are well investigated in contrast to versions with more elaborate type systems such as intersection types. In previous work, we introduced a de Bruijn version of the lambda-calculus with an intersection type system and proved that it preserves subject reduction, a basic property of type systems. In this paper a version with de Bruijn indices of an intersection type system originally introduced to characterise principal typings for beta-normal forms is presented. We present the characterisation in this new system and the corresponding versions for the type inference and the reconstruction of normal forms from principal typings algorithms. We briefly discuss the failure of the subject reduction property and some possible solutions for it.\n\nThe lambda sigma calculus and strong normalization\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nSchack-Nielsen, Anders; SchÃ¼rmann, Carsten\n\nExplicit substitution calculi can be classified into several dis- tinct categories depending on whether they are confluent, meta-confluent, strong normalization preserving, strongly normalizing, simulating, fully compositional, and/or local. In this paper we present a variant of the Î»Ï-calculus, ...\n\nLambda interferon (IFN-lambda), a type III IFN, is induced by viruses and IFNs and displays potent antiviral activity against select virus infections in vivo\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nAnk, Nina; West, Hans; Bartholdy, Christina\n\n2006-01-01\n\nType III interferons (IFNs) (interleukin-28/29 or lambda interferon [IFN-lambda]) are cytokines with IFN-like activities. Here we show that several classes of viruses induce expression of IFN-lambda1 and -lambda2/3 in similar patterns. The IFN-lambdas were-unlike alpha/beta interferon (IFN......-alpha/beta)-induced directly by stimulation with IFN-alpha or -lambda, thus identifying type III IFNs as IFN-stimulated genes. In vitro assays revealed that IFN-lambdas have appreciable antiviral activity against encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) but limited activity against herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), whereas IFN......-alpha potently restricted both viruses. Using three murine models for generalized virus infections, we found that while recombinant IFN-alpha reduced the viral load after infection with EMCV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and HSV-2, treatment with recombinant IFN-lambda in vivo did not affect viral...\n\nCorrelation Measurement of Lambda-anti-Lambda, Lambda-Lambda and anti-Lambda-anti-Lambda with the ATLAS detector at s=7 TeV\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCheng, Hok-Chuen\n\nThis thesis summaries the measurements of correlations between Lambda 0Lambda0, Lambda0Lambda 0, and Lambda0Lambda 0 hyperon pairs produced inclusively at the LHC, which are useful for a better understanding of the quark-antiquark pair production and jet fragmentation and hadronization processes. The analysis is based on hyperon pairs selected using the muon and minimum bias data samples collected at the ATLAS experiment from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV in 2010. Excess Lambda0Lambda 0 are observed near the production threshold and are identified to be originated from the parton system in the string model in the MC sample, decaying either directly or through heavy strange resonances such as Sigma0 and Sigma*(1385). Dynamical correlations have been explored through a correlation function defined as the ratio of two-particle to single-particle densities. Positive correlation is observed for Lambda0Lambda0 and anticorrelation is observed for Lambda0Lambda 0 and Lambda0Lambda 0 for Q in [0,2] GeV. The structure replicates similar correlations in pp, pp, and pppp events in PYTHIA generator as predicted by the Lund string fragmentation model. Parameters of the \"popcorn\" mechanism implemented in the PYTHIA generator are tuned and are found to have little impact on the structure observed. The spin composition of the sample is extracted using a data-driven reference sample built by event mixing. Appropriate corrections have been made to the kinematic distributions in the reference sample by kinematic weighting to make sure that the detector effects are well modeled. A modified Pearson's chi2 test statistics is calculated for the costheta* distribution to determine the best-fitted A-value for data. The results are consistent with zero for both like-type and unlike-type hyperon pairs in Q â [0,10] GeV and Q â [1,10] GeV respectively. The data statistics in the range of Q â [0, 1] GeV is currently too low for the estimation of the emitter\n\nWave-Style Token Machines and Quantum Lambda Calculi\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nUgo Dal Lago\n\n2015-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Particle-style token machines are a way to interpret proofs and programs, when the latter are written following the principles of linear logic. In this paper, we show that token machines also make sense when the programs at hand are those of a simple quantum lambda-calculus with implicit qubits. This, however, requires generalising the concept of a token machine to one in which more than one particle travel around the term at the same time. The presence of multiple tokens is intimately related to entanglement and allows us to give a simple operational semantics to the calculus, coherently with the principles of quantum computation.\n\nComments on Georgeff's Transformation and Reduction Strategies for Typed Lambda Expressions\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nNielson, Flemming; Nielson, Hanne Riis\n\n1986-01-01\n\nIn his recent paper, Georgeff [1] considers the evaluation of lambda expres sions (with reducing reflexive types) on a variant of Landin's SECD machine. It is observed that for so-called simple expressions the SECD machine will construct stack-like environment structures, whereas, in general......, they are tree-like. Georgeff then explores the idea of transforming any (typed) lambda expression into simple form and then using the SECD machine for these expressions. However, such transformations might be undesirable if the language is going to be interpreted directly.

To obtain efficient implementations...... it is important to distinguish between early and late binding times, i.e. to distinguish between compile-time and run-time computations. The authors therefore introduce a two-level version of the lambda-calculus where this distinction is made in an explicit way.

A phenomenological {lambda}{lambda} interaction, which is derived relativistically from the Lagrangian of the system, is adopted to the gap equation. It is found that increasing the nucleon density makes the {lambda}{lambda} pairing gap suppressed. This result suggests a mechanism, specific to relativistic models, of its dependence on the nucleon density.

(Joint Inst. for Nuclear Research, Dubna (USSR))\n\n1990-05-01\n\n{lambda}-prophage induction in repair-deficient and wild-type E. coli strains by heavy ions and {gamma}-rays was investigated. The dose dependence of the fraction of induced cells has been measured and its initial slope ({lambda}-induction potency) determined. Induction by {gamma}-rays was found to be more efficient in a polA-repair-deficient strain; the value of {lambda}-induction potency is zero in lexA{sup -} and recA{sup -} strains. The {lambda}-induction potency potency increased with LET for wild-type cells but remained constant in polA{sup -} mutant cells. It is suggested that DNA damage triggering the {lambda}-prophage induction in the case of ionizing radiation could be a type of DNA single-strand break with complex structures which cannot be repaired by fast repair processes, and requires a substantial level of energy deposition for induction in a DNA molecule.

The optimal transverse shape of the laser beam, including its variability under water-cooling, is determined for selective ablation of dental calculus. Intensity profiles under various water-cooling conditions were optically observed. The 400-nm laser was coupled into a multimode optical fiber using an f = 2.5-cm lens and light-shaping diffuser. Water-cooling was supplied coaxially around the fiber. Five human tooth samples (four with calculus and one pristine) were irradiated perpendicular to the tooth surface while the tooth was moved back and forth at 0.3 mm/second, varying between 20 and 180 iterations. The teeth were imaged before and after irradiation using light microscopy with a flashing blue light-emitting diode (LED). An environmental scanning electron microscope imaged each tooth after irradiation. High-order super-Gaussian intensity profiles are observed at the output of a fiber coiled around a 4-in. diameter drum. Super-Gaussian beams have a more-homogenous fluence distribution than Gaussian beams and have a higher energy efficiency for selective ablation. Coaxial water-cooling does not noticeably distort the intensity distribution within 1 mm from the optical fiber. In contrast, lasers focused to a Gaussian cross section (Calculus is preferentially ablated at high fluences (> or =2 J/cm(2)); below this fluence, stalling occurs because of photo-bleaching of the calculus. Healthy dental hard tissue is not removed at fluences calculus with a frequency-doubled Ti:sapphire laser. Fluences over 2 J/cm(2) are required to remove calculus efficiently since photo-bleaching stalls calculus removal below that value.\n\nCorrelation Measurement of $\\\\Lambda^{0}$$\\\\overline{\\\\Lambda}$$^{0}$ $\\\\Lambda^{0}$$\\\\Lambda^{0}$ and $\\\\overline{\\\\Lambda}$$^{0}$$\\\\overline{\\\\Lambda}$$^{0}$ with the ATLAS Detector at $\\\\sqrt{s}$=7 TeV\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nAUTHOR|(INSPIRE)INSPIRE-00357007\n\nThis thesis summaries the measurements of correlations between Lambda0-anti-Lambda0, Lambda0-Lambda0 and anti-Lambda0-anti-Lambda0 hyperon pairs produced inclusively at the LHC, which are useful for a better understanding of the quark-antiquark pair production and jet fragmentation and hadronization processes. The analysis is based on hyperon pairs selected using the muon and minimum bias samples collected at the ATLAS experiment from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV in 2010. Excess Lambda0-anti-Lambda0 are observed near the production threshold and are identified to be originated from the parton system in the string model in the Monte Carlo sample, decaying either directly or through heavy strange resonances such as Sigma0 and Sigmaâ(1385). Dynamical correlations have been explored through a correlation function defined as the ratio of two-particle to single-particle densities. Positive correlation is observed for Lambda0-anti-Lambda0 and anticorrelation is observed for Lambda0-...\n\nRealization of bicovariant differential calculus on the Lie algebra type noncommutative spaces\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMeljanac, Stjepan; KreÅ¡iÄâJuriÄ, SaÅ¡a; MartiniÄ, Tea\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThis paper investigates bicovariant differential calculus on noncommutative spaces of the Lie algebra type. For a given Lie algebra g0, we construct a Lie superalgebra g =g0âg1 containing noncommutative coordinates and one-forms. We show that g can be extended by a set of generators TAB whose action on the enveloping algebra U (g ) gives the commutation relations between monomials in U (g0 ) and one-forms. Realizations of noncommutative coordinates, one-forms, and the generators TAB as formal power series in a semicompleted Weyl superalgebra are found. In the special case dim(g0 ) =dim(g1 ) , we also find a realization of the exterior derivative on U (g0 ) . The realizations of these geometric objects yield a bicovariant differential calculus on U (g0 ) as a deformation of the standard calculus on the Euclidean space.\n\n$\\\\Lambda$ and $\\\\bar{\\\\Lambda}$ polarization at COMPASS\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nKang, Donghee\n\n2010-01-01\n\nAt the COMPASS experiment $\\\\Lambda$ and $\\\\bar{\\\\Lambda}$ particles are produced with high statistics in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) processes of 160 GeV/c polarized muons. Since both, beam and target, are polarized, various studies on the $\\\\Lambda$ polarization are possible. We present results on the longitudinal polarization transfer from muons to $\\\\Lambda$ hyperons produced by scattering off an unpolarized isoscalar target and preliminary results on the transverse $\\\\Lambda$ polarization with a transversely polarized proton target. The $\\\\Lambda$ and $\\\\bar{\\\\Lambda}$ polarization can be studied by measuring the acceptance corrected angular distribution of its decay products. The longitudinal spin transfers to $\\\\Lambda$ and $\\\\bar{\\\\Lambda}$ produced in the current fragmentation region exhibit different behaviours as a function of $x_{Bj}$ and $x_{F}$. The $x_{Bj}$ and $x_{F}$ dependences of $\\\\Lambda$ polarization are compatible with zero, while $\\\\bar{\\\\Lambda}$ polarization tends to increase with $x_{F}$.

Rouson\n\n2008-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This article approaches scientific software architecture from three analytical paths. Each path examines discrete time advancement of multiphysics phenomena governed by coupled differential equations. The new object-oriented Fortran 2003 constructs provide a formal syntax for an abstract data type (ADT calculus. The first analysis uses traditional object-oriented software design metrics to demonstrate the high cohesion and low coupling associated with the calculus. A second analysis from the viewpoint of computational complexity theory demonstrates that a more representative bug search strategy than that considered by Rouson et al. (ACM Trans. Math. Soft. 34(1 (2008 reduces the number of lines searched in a code with Î» total lines from O(Î»2 to O(Î» log2 Î» , which in turn becomes nearly independent of the overall code size in the context of ADT calculus. The third analysis derives from information theory an argument that ADT calculus simplifies developer communications in part by minimizing the growth in interface information content as developers add new physics to a multiphysics package.\n\nLambda Interferon (IFN-gamma), a Type III IFN, is induced by viruses and IFNs and displays potent antiviral activity against select virus infections in vivo\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nAnk, Nina; West, Hans; Bartholdy, C.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nType III interferons (IFNs) (interleukin-28/29 or lambda interferon [IFN-lambda]) are cytokines with IFN-like activities. Here we show that several classes of viruses induce expression of IFN-lambda1 and -lambda2/3 in similar patterns.

We contribute to this clarification with a calculus that models essential AOP, both simpler and more general than existing formalizations. In AOP, advice may intercept......-oriented code. Two well-known pointcut categories, call and execution, are commonly considered similar.We formally expose their differences, and resolve the associated soundness problem. Our calculus includes type ranges, an intuitive and concise alternative to explicit type variables that allows advice...... to be polymorphic over intercepted methods. We use calculus parameters to cover type safety for a wide design space of other features. Type soundness is verified in Coq....\n\nReasoning about objects using process calculus techniques\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nKleist, Josva\n\nThis thesis investigates the applicability of techniques known from the world of process calculi to reason about properties of object-oriented programs. The investigation is performed upon a small object-oriented language - The Sigma-calculus of Abadi and Cardelli. The investigation is twofold: We......-calculus turns out to be insufficient. Based on our experiences, we present a translation of a typed imperative Sigma-calculus, which looks promising. We are able to provide simple proofs of the equivalence of different Sigma-calculus objects using this translation. We use a labelled transition system adapted...... to the Sigma-calculus to investigate the use of process calculi techniques directly on the Sigma-calculus. The results obtained are of a fairly theoretical nature. We investigate the connection between the operational and denotaional semantics for a typed functional Sigma-calculus. The result is that Abadi...\n\nModerate-resolution spectral standards from lambda 5600 to lambda 9000\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAllen, Lori E.; Strom, Karen M.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nWe present a grid of stellar classification spectra of moderate resolution (R approximately 1500) in the range lambda lambda 5600-9000 A, compiled from high signal-to noise spectra of 275 stars, most in the open clusters Praesepe and M67. The grid covers dwarfs from types B8 through M5, giants from G8 through M7, and subgiants from F5 through K0. We catalog atomic and molecular absorption features useful for stellar classification, and demonstrate the use of luminosity-sensitive features to distinguish between late-type dwarf and giant stars. The entire database is made available in digital format on anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.\n\n{Lambda}{bar {Lambda}} production in two-photon interactions\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nAnderson, S.; Kubota, Y.; Lattery, M.; ONeill, J.J.; Patton, S.; Poling, R.; Riehle, T.; Savinov, V.; Smith, A.

The analysis is based on a data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3 \\\\rm fb^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions, collected by the LHCb experiment. The $\\\\Lambda_b^0 \\\\to \\\\Lambda K^+\\\\pi^-$ and $\\\\Lambda_b^0 \\\\to \\\\Lambda K^+K^-$ decays are observed for the first time and their branching fractions and $CP$ asymmetry parameters are measured. Evidence is seen for the $\\\\Lambda_b^0 \\\\to \\\\Lambda \\\\pi^+\\\\pi^-$ decay and limits are set on the branching fractions of $\\\\Xi_b^0$ baryon decays to the $\\\\Lambda h^+h^{\\\\prime -}$ final states.\n\nPre-calculus workbook for dummies\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nKuang, Yang\n\n2011-01-01\n\nGet the confidence and math skills you need to get started with calculus Are you preparing for calculus?

We present an extension of this framework to programs with multithreading and side effects focusing on the case of elementary time. Our main contributions are as follows. First, we provide a new combinatorial proof of termination in elementary time for the functional case. Second, we develop an extension of the approach to a call-by-value $lambda$-calculus with multithreading and side effects.

The observed material has been obtained by means of the space observatory ''Orion-2''. Some regularities in the behavior of lambda 2800 Mg II in stellar spectra have been revealed: wide and deep depression of the continuous spectra at 2800 A in F-G type stars; the presence of the doublet lambda 2800 Mg II in the form of weak emission in the spectra of cold stars (K2-K5); the presence both of the multiplet lambda 3080 Ti II and the doublet lambda 2800 Mg II simultaneously either in emission--in the late-type stars--or in absorption in earlier types; the existence of combined profiles of lambda 2800 Mg II, i.e., a wide absorption line with a weak emission in the center, in stars of the transitional class (G5-K0), etc. A well-defined empirical relationship between the equivalent width of lambda 2800 Mg II and the spectral class of the star has been established (Fig. 8).

Our calculus enjoys confluence without any restriction. Its type system enforces strong normalization of expressions and it is a sound and complete system for full implicational Classical Logic. We give a very simple denotational semantics which allows easy calculations of the interpretation of expressions.\n\nLambda-dropping\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nDanvy, Olivier; Schultz, Ulrik Pagh\n\n1997-01-01\n\nLambda-lifting a functional program transforms it into a set of recursive equations. We present the symmetric transformation: lambda-dropping. Lambda-dropping a set of recursive equations restores block structure and lexical scope.For lack of scope, recursive equations must carry around all...... the parameters that any of their callees might possibly need. Both lambda-lifting and lambda-dropping thus require one to compute a transitive closure over the call graph:â¢ for lambda-lifting: to establish the Def/Use path of each free variable (these free variables are then added as parameters to each...... of the functions in the call path);â¢ for lambda-dropping: to establish the Def/Use path of each parameter (parameters whose use occurs in the same scope as their definition do not need to be passed along in the call path).Without free variables, a program is scope-insensitive. Its blocks are then free...\n\nCommand injection attacks, continuations, and the Lambek calculus\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHayo Thielecke\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper shows connections between command injection attacks, continuations, and the Lambek calculus: certain command injections, such as the tautology attack on SQL, are shown to be a form of control effect that can be typed using the Lambek calculus, generalizing the double-negation typing of continuations. Lambek's syntactic calculus is a logic with two implicational connectives taking their arguments from the left and right, respectively. These connectives describe how strings interact with their left and right contexts when building up syntactic structures. The calculus is a form of propositional logic without structural rules, and so a forerunner of substructural logics like Linear Logic and Separation Logic.\n\nA Measurement of the Product Branching Ratio $f(b \\\\to \\\\Lambda_{b}).BR (\\\\Lambda_{b} \\\\to \\\\Lambda X)$ in $Z^{0}$ Decays\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nAbbiendi, G.; Alexander, G.; Allison, John; Altekamp, N.; Anderson, K.J.; Anderson, S.; Arcelli, S.; Asai, S.; Ashby, S.F.; Axen, D.; Azuelos, G.; Ball, A.H.; Barberio, E.; Barlow, Roger J.; Bartoldus, R.; Batley, J.R.; Baumann, S.; Bechtluft, J.; Behnke, T.; Bell, Kenneth Watson; Bella, G.; Bellerive, A.; Bentvelsen, S.; Bethke, S.; Betts, S.; Biebel, O.; Biguzzi, A.; Bird, S.D.; Blobel, V.; Bloodworth, I.J.; Bock, P.; Bohme, J.; Bonacorsi, D.; Boutemeur, M.; Braibant, S.; Bright-Thomas, P.; Brigliadori, L.; Brown, Robert M.; Burckhart, H.J.; Capiluppi, P.; Carnegie, R.K.; Carter, A.A.; Carter, J.R.; Chang, C.Y.; Charlton, David G.; Chrisman, D.; Ciocca, C.; Clarke, P.E.L.; Clay, E.; Cohen, I.; Conboy, J.E.; Cooke, O.C.; Couyoumtzelis, C.; Coxe, R.L.; Cuffiani, M.; Dado, S.; Dallavalle, G.Marco; Darling, C.; Davis, R.; De Jong, S.; de Roeck, A.; Dervan, P.; Desch, K.; Dienes, B.; Dixit, M.S.; Dubbert, J.; Duchovni, E.; Duckeck, G.; Duerdoth, I.P.; Eatough, D.; Estabrooks, P.G.; Etzion, E.; Fabbri, F.; Fanti, M.; Faust, A.A.; Fiedler, F.; Fierro, M.; Fleck, I.; Folman, R.; Furtjes, A.; Futyan, D.I.; Gagnon, P.; Gary, J.W.; Gascon, J.; Gascon-Shotkin, S.M.; Gaycken, G.; Geich-Gimbel, C.; Giacomelli, G.; Giacomelli, P.; Gibson, V.; Gibson, W.R.; Gingrich, D.M.; Glenzinski, D.; Goldberg, J.; Gorn, W.; Grandi, C.; Graham, K.; Gross, E.; Grunhaus, J.; Gruwe, M.; Hanson, G.G.; Hansroul, M.; Hapke, M.; Harder, K.; Harel, A.; Hargrove, C.K.; Hartmann, C.; Hauschild, M.; Hawkes, C.M.; Hawkings, R.; Hemingway, R.J.; Herndon, M.; Herten, G.; Heuer, R.D.; Hildreth, M.D.; Hill, J.C.; Hobson, P.R.; Hoch, M.; Hocker, James Andrew; Hoffman, Kara Dion; Homer, R.J.; Honma, A.K.; Horvath, D.; Hossain, K.R.; Howard, R.; Huntemeyer, P.; Igo-Kemenes, P.; Imrie, D.C.; Ishii, K.; Jacob, F.R.; Jawahery, A.; Jeremie, H.; Jimack, M.; Jones, C.R.; Jovanovic, P.; Junk, T.R.; Karlen, D.; Kartvelishvili, V.; Kawagoe, K.; Kawamoto, T.; Kayal, P.I.; Keeler, R.K.; Kellogg, R.G.; Kennedy, B.W.; Kim, D.H.; Klier, A.; Kluth, S.; Kobayashi, T.; Kobel, M.; Koetke, D.S.; Kokott, T.P.; Kolrep, M.; Komamiya, S.; Kowalewski, Robert V.; Kress, T.; Krieger, P.; von Krogh, J.; Kuhl, T.; Kyberd, P.; Lafferty, G.D.; Landsman, H.; Lanske, D.; Lauber, J.; Lautenschlager, S.R.; Lawson, I.; Layter, J.G.; Lazic, D.; Lee, A.M.; Lellouch, D.; Letts, J.; Levinson, L.; Liebisch, R.; List, B.; Littlewood, C.; Lloyd, A.W.; Lloyd, S.L.; Loebinger, F.K.; Long, G.D.; Losty, M.J.; Ludwig, J.; Lui, D.; Macchiolo, A.; Macpherson, A.; Mader, W.; Mannelli, M.; Marcellini, S.; Markopoulos, C.; Martin, A.J.; Martin, J.P.; Martinez, G.; Mashimo, T.; Mattig, Peter; McDonald, W.John; McKenna, J.; Mckigney, E.A.; McMahon, T.J.; McPherson, R.A.; Meijers, F.; Menke, S.; Merritt, F.S.; Mes, H.; Meyer, J.; Michelini, A.; Mihara, S.; Mikenberg, G.; Miller, D.J.; Mir, R.; Mohr, W.; Montanari, A.; Mori, T.; Nagai, K.; Nakamura, I.; Neal, H.A.; Nellen, B.; Nisius, R.; O'Neale, S.W.; Oakham, F.G.; Odorici, F.; Ogren, H.O.; Oreglia, M.J.; Orito, S.; Palinkas, J.; Pasztor, G.; Pater, J.R.; Patrick, G.N.; Patt, J.; Perez-Ochoa, R.; Petzold, S.; Pfeifenschneider, P.; Pilcher, J.E.; Pinfold, J.; Plane, David E.; Poffenberger, P.; Polok, J.; Przybycien, M.; Rembser, C.; Rick, H.; Robertson, S.; Robins, S.A.; Rodning, N.; Roney, J.M.; Roscoe, K.; Rossi, A.M.; Rozen, Y.; Runge, K.; Runolfsson, O.; Rust, D.R.; Sachs, K.; Saeki, T.; Sahr, O.; Sang, W.M.; Sarkisian, E.K.G.; Sbarra, C.; Schaile, A.D.; Schaile, O.; Scharf, F.; Scharff-Hansen, P.; Schieck, J.; Schmitt, B.; Schmitt, S.; Schoning, A.; Schroder, Matthias; Schumacher, M.; Schwick, C.; Scott, W.G.; Seuster, R.; Shears, T.G.; Shen, B.C.; Shepherd-Themistocleous, C.H.; Sherwood, P.; Siroli, G.P.; Sittler, A.; Skuja, A.; Smith, A.M.; Snow, G.A.; Sobie, R.; Soldner-Rembold, S.; Spagnolo, S.; Sproston, M.; Stahl, A.; Stephens, K.; Steuerer, J.; Stoll, K.; Strom, Dav"
