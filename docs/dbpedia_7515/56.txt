You do not make explicit which definition of Čech cohomology you are using. I guess it is the "classic" one based on nerves of open coverings. Here are two references giving proofs of the homotopy invariance of Čech cohomology:

The timeless classic from 1952

Eilenberg, Samuel, and Norman Steenrod. Foundations of algebraic topology. Vol. 2193. Princeton University Press, 2015.

Have a look at Chapter IX "The Čech homology theory":

In this chapter the Cech homology and cohomology theories are defined and the axioms for such are verified.

The homotopy axiom is stated as Theorem IX 5.1.

Another classic from 1967

Spanier, Edwin H. Algebraic topology. Springer Science & Business Media, 1989.

Have a look at Chapter 6 "General cohomology theory and duality".

In section 4 the Alexander cohomolgy theory is introduced and the homotopoy axiom for Alexander theory is proved in section 5 (Theorem 6). In section 7 Čech cohomology theory is introduced (with coefficients in a presheaf; the constant presheaf gives coefficients in a module $G$). Spanier does not verify the axioms directly from the definition, but proves that Čech cohomology and Alexander cohomology agree for paracompact spaces (see section 8 Corollary 8). In particular, this proves the homotopy invariance of Čech cohomology.
