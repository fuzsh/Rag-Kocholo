Traffic Incidents

Traffic incidents range from a flat tire to a semi rollover crash. Traffic incidents on the I-70 mountain corridor can create major delays or cause a full closure of the interstate. Reducing incident clearance times improves the reliability of the corridor for all travelers.

Keeping You Safe

CDOT employs several strategies to help motorists enjoy safe, reliable travel on the I-70 corridor in winter. Specifically, motorists can expect such traffic control measures as ramp management, snowplow escorts, quick clearance of traffic incidents, and real-time traveler information through cotrip.org and 511.

Because Eisenhower Tunnel has no shoulders, when heavy traffic congestion or incidents poses the risk of back-ups, traffic must be stopped, or safety metering must be implemented to clear traffic and maintain access to the tunnel interior for emergency response vehicles. When road conditions on the approaches to the tunnel are adverse, vehicles lose traction and cause significant delays (such as the three-hour delays between Silverthorne and the tunnel on Feb. 9, 2014).

The highest travel delays of the winter occur when heavy traffic congestion necessitates metering Eisenhower Tunnel. CDOT will use the following mitigation strategies to achieve this:
