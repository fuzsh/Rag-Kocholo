Real-time metrics reports

Real-time metrics reports show real-time or near-real time metrics information about activity in your contact center. Metrics such as Online show the number of agents currently online in real-time, updating every 15 seconds. Metrics such as Handled and Abandoned reflect near real-time values for your contact center.

You can customize the reports, specify a time range for each report, select metrics for each report, and select filters for data to include or exclude from each report.

You can also use the Amazon Connect Service APIs to create custom reports, such as real-time reports that are filtered by teams of agents.
