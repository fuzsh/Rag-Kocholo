        "text": "Cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. Distracted driving is very dangerous. In 2021, 3,522 people died in distraction-related crashes, up 12% from the year before and accounting for 8.2% of all road deaths.\n\nKnowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help families manage this dangerous crash risk.\n\nTexting and driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking while driving or texting and driving or checking or sending social media posts while driving takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.\n\nBecause technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. Make a family commitment not to use distracting devices while driving, including texting and driving and checking social media while driving.\n\nWatch this video with your teen to avoid distractions both inside and outside the car, including talking on a cell phone while driving and texting and driving:\n\nBenefits of Not Texting and Driving\n\nAccording to research conducted at Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks. For these teens, the benefits associated with not using a cell phone while driving include:\n\nBeing able to pay better attention\n\nBeing less likely to have a crash\n\nFollowing the law\n\nParents need to provide teens with safe alternatives to cell phone use while driving, including texting and driving:\n\nComplete any call or text before starting the car\n\nGet directions and try to visualize the destination before turning the key\n\nCheck in with friends or parents only after arrival\n\nParents should also avoid calling their teen when he or she is driving. Instead ask to be called before leaving one place and when arriving at the next destination. A teen may feel compelled to answer a parent's call or text if received while driving.\n\nIt's also a good idea to set the default \"do not disturb\" setting on a teen's phone. With recent upgrades in IOS, Apple created an option to avoid distraction while driving. When the phone detects driving, it sends automated messages and does not alert the driver. Visit Apple Support to learn how to set this up.\n\nBeyond distracted driving laws, behavioral research to prevent distracted driving shows promise. For example, can paying drivers to stay off their cell phones while driving make roads safer? A large randomized controlled clinical trial conducted by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that it can. Key to better results are how the incentive is framed and whether performance feedback is given."
