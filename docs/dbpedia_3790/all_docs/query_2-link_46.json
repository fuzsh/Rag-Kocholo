If you need the assistance of a police officer, please call 606-5800 if it is not an emergency and 911 if it is an emergency.\n\nTo report a traffic crash online or to download the report, please use the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles' Online Crash Report application.\n\nBike Box locations include Call Street at Stadium Drive and Call Street at both Bronough and Macomb Streets.\n\nTake a look at our pamphlet (PDF) for more information on bike boxes.\n\nThe goal of a Bike Box is to create a safe location for cyclists on the road at intersections in an effort to prevent bike and car collisions. The life-saving benefits of awareness and safety for cyclists in our community is the driving force behind this project. Both motorists and cyclists need to be aware of one another and share the road in a safe, responsible manner.\"\n\nThe Bike Box is highly visible when installed. It consists of a green area with a white bicycle symbol inside placed between the white stop bar and the pedestrian crosswalk. Additionally, a portion of the existing bike lane leading up to the intersection is painted green with white bicycle symbols to indicate to motorists they are approaching an intersection with a Bike Box.\n\nStatistical data from progressive, cycling friendly communities, like Portland, Oregon, and Austin, Texas, show that bike boxes reduce the number of collisions between motorists turning right and cyclists going straight or turning right, better known as \"right hook\" collisions.\n\nThe Bike Box concept was introduced and supported by the cycling community during community meetings regarding Moving Tallahassee: Cars Optional plan, which was discussed with the community during the past year. The city plans to work with the cycling community to potentially identify other intersections for future locations of bike boxes.\n\nBike boxes are easy to use for both cyclists and motorists. You can learn how quickly and easily by watching the City's How Do I? video:\n\nHow Do I Use a Bike Box?"
