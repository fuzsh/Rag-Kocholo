        "text": "This section contains knowledge and safe driving information that all CDL holders should know. You must pass a test on this information to get a CDL. This section does not have specific information on air brakes, combination vehicles, doubles, or passenger vehicles. When preparing for the vehicle inspection test, you must review the material in Section 11 in addition to the information in this section. This section does have basic information on HazMat that all drivers should know. If you need an “H” endorsement, study Section 9.\n\n2.1 – Vehicle Inspection\n\n2.1.1 – Why Inspect\n\nSafety is the most important reason you inspect your vehicle, safety for yourself and other road users.\n\nA vehicle defect found during an inspection could save you problems later. You could have a breakdown on the road that will cost time and dollars, or even worse, an accident caused by the defect.\n\nFederal and state laws require that drivers inspect their vehicles. Federal and state inspectors may also inspect your vehicles. If they judge the vehicle to be unsafe, they will put it “out-of-service” until it is fixed.\n\n2.1.2 – Types of Vehicle Inspections\n\nVehicle Inspection\n\nA vehicle inspection will help you find problems that could cause an accident or breakdown. Vehicle inspections should be done routinely before operating the vehicle. Review the last vehicle inspection report. Make sure the vehicle has been released for service by the maintenance mechanics, if applicable. The motor carrier must repair any items in the report that affect safety, and certify on the report that repairs were made or were unnecessary. Remember, when you get behind the wheel, you (not the mechanic) are responsible for the safe operation of the vehicle. If the defects have been repaired, sign the previous driver’s report. There is detailed information on vehicle inspections in Section 11 of this handbook.\n\nTrip Inspection\n\nFor safety during a trip, you should:\n\nWatch gauges for signs of trouble.\n\nUse your senses to check for problems (look, listen, smell, and feel).\n\nCheck these critical items when you stop:\n\nTires, wheels, and rims.\n\nBrakes.\n\nLights and reflectors.\n\nBrake and electrical connections to trailer.\n\nTrailer coupling devices.\n\nCargo securement devices.\n\nAfter-Trip Inspection and Report\n\nYou should do an after-trip inspection at the end of the trip, day, or tour of duty on each vehicle you operated. It may include filling out a vehicle condition report listing any problems you find. The inspection report helps a motor carrier know when the vehicle needs repairs.\n\n2.1.3 – What to Look For\n\nTire Problems\n\nToo much or too little air pressure.\n\nBad wear. You need at least 4/32-inch tread depth in every major groove on front tires. You need 2/32 inch on other tires. No fabric should show through the tread or sidewall.\n\nCuts or other damage.\n\nTread separation.\n\nDual tires that come in contact with each other or parts of the vehicle.\n\nMismatched sizes.\n\nRadial and bias-ply tires used together.\n\nCut or cracked valve stems.\n\nRegrooved, recapped, or retreaded tires on the front wheels of a bus. These are prohibited.\n\nWheel and Rim Problems\n\nDamaged rims.\n\nRust around wheel nuts may mean the nuts are loose (check tightness). After a tire has been changed, stop a short while later and recheck tightness of nuts.\n\nMissing clamps, spacers, studs, or lugs mean danger.\n\nMismatched, bent, or cracked lock rings are dangerous.\n\nWheels or rims that have had welding repairs are not safe.\n\nBad Brake Drums or Shoes\n\nCracked drums.\n\nShoes or pads with oil, grease, or brake fluid on them.\n\nShoes worn dangerously thin, missing, or broken.\n\nSteering System Defects\n\nMissing nuts, bolts, cotter keys, or other parts.\n\nBent, loose, or broken parts, such as steering column, steering gear box, or tie rods.\n\nIf power steering equipped, check hoses, pumps, fluid level, and check for leaks.\n\nSteering wheel play of more than 10 degrees (approximately 2 inches movement at the rim of a 20 inch steering wheel) can make it hard to steer.\n\nSuspension System Defects\n\nThe suspension system holds up the vehicle and its load and keeps the axles in place. Therefore, broken suspension parts can be extremely dangerous.\n\nLook for:\n\nSpring hangers hat allow movement of an axle from its proper position. See Figure 2.2.\n\nCracked or Broken Spring Hangers.\n\nMissing or broken leaves in any leaf spring. If 1/4 or more are missing, it will put the vehicle “out-of-service,” but any defect could be dangerous. See Figure 2.3.\n\nBroken leaves in a multi-leaf spring or leaves that have shifted so they might hit a tire or other part.\n\nLeaking shock absorbers.\n\nTorque rods or arms, u-bolts, spring hangers, or other axle positioning parts that are cracked, damaged, or missing.\n\nAir suspension systems that are damaged and/or leaking. See Figure 2.4.\n\nAny loose, cracked, broken, or missing frame members.\n\nExhaust System Defects\n\nA broken exhaust system can let poison fumes into the cab or sleeper berth. Look for:\n\nLoose, broken, or missing exhaust pipes, mufflers, tailpipes, or vertical stacks.\n\nLoose, broken, or missing mounting brackets, clamps, bolts, or nuts.\n\nExhaust system parts rubbing against fuel system parts, tires, or other moving parts of the vehicle.\n\nExhaust system parts that are leaking.\n\nEmergency Equipment\n\nVehicles must be equipped with emergency equipment. Look for:\n\nFire extinguisher(s).\n\nSpare electrical fuses (unless equipped with circuit breakers).\n\nWarning devices for parked vehicles (for example, 3 red reflective warning triangles, 6 fuses, or 3 liquid burning flares).\n\n2.1.4 – CDL Vehicle Inspection Test\n\nTo obtain a CDL, you will be required to pass a vehicle inspection test. You will be tested to see if you know whether your vehicle is safe to drive. You will be asked to do an inspection of your vehicle. You must point to or touch and name the item you are inspecting and explain why to the examiner. The following 7-step inspection method should be useful.\n\nCargo (Trucks). You must make sure the truck is not overloaded and the cargo is balanced and secured before each trip. If the cargo contains HazMat, you must inspect for proper papers and placarding.\n\n2.1.5 – 7-Step Inspection Method\n\nMethod of Inspection. Do a vehicle inspection the same way each time so you will learn all the steps and be less likely to forget something.\n\nApproaching the Vehicle. Notice the general condition. Look for damage or the vehicle leaning to one side. Look under the vehicle for fresh oil, coolant, grease, or fuel leaks. Check the area around the vehicle for hazards to vehicle movement (people, other vehicles, objects, low-hanging wires, limbs, etc.).\n\nVehicle Inspection Guide\n\nStep 1: Vehicle Overview\n\nReview Last Vehicle Inspection Report. Drivers may have to make a vehicle inspection report in writing each day. The motor carrier must repair any items in the report that affect safety and certify on the report that repairs were made or were unnecessary. You must sign the report only if defects were noted and certified to be repaired or repairs are not needed.\n\nStep 2: Check the Engine Compartment\n\nCheck that the parking brakes are on and/or wheels chocked. You may have to raise the hood, tilt the cab (secure loose things so they do not fall and break something), or open the engine compartment door. Check the following:\n\nEngine oil level.\n\nCoolant level in radiator and condition of hoses.\n\nPower steering fluid level and condition of hose (if so equipped).\n\nWindshield washer fluid level.\n\nBattery fluid level, connections and tie downs (battery may be located elsewhere).\n\nAutomatic transmission fluid level (may require engine to be running).\n\nCheck belts for tightness and excessive wear (alternator, water pump, air compressor). Know how much “give” the belts should have when adjusted right, and check each one.\n\nEngine compartment for leaks (fuel, coolant, oil, power steering fluid, hydraulic fluid, battery fluid).\n\nElectrical wiring insulation for cracks and wear.\n\nLower and secure hood, cab, or engine compartment door.\n\nStep 3: Start the Engine and Inspect the Inside the Cab\n\nGet in and Start the Engine\n\nMake sure the parking brake is on.\n\nPut the gearshift in Neutral (or “Park” if automatic).\n\nStart engine and listen for unusual noises.\n\nIf equipped, check the anti-lock braking system (ABS) indicator lights. The light on the dash should come on and then turn off. If it stays on, the ABS is not working properly. For trailers only, if the yellow light on the left rear of the trailer stays on, the ABS is not working properly.\n\nLook at the Gauges\n\nOil pressure. Pressure should come up to normal within seconds after the engine is started. See Figure 2.5.\n\nAir pressure. Pressure should build from 50 – 90 pounds per square inch (psi) within 3 minutes. Build the air pressure to governor cut-out (usually around 120–140 psi.) Know your vehicle’s requirements.\n\nAmmeter and/or voltmeter. Should be in normal range(s).\n\nCoolant temperature. Should begin gradual rise to normal operating range.\n\nEngine oil temperature. Should begin gradual rise to normal operating range.\n\nWarning lights and buzzers. Oil, coolant, charging circuit warning, and ABS lights should go out right away.\n\nCheck the Condition of the Controls\n\nCheck all of the following for looseness, sticking, damage, or improper setting:\n\nSteering wheel.\n\nClutch.\n\nAccelerator (gas pedal).\n\nBrake controls:\n\n— Foot brake.\n\n— Trailer brake (if the vehicle has one).\n\n— Parking brake.\n\n— Retarder controls (if the vehicle has them).\n\nTransmission controls.\n\nInter-axle differential lock (if the vehicle has one).\n\nHorn(s).\n\nWindshield wiper/washer.\n\nLights.\n\n— Headlights.\n\n— Dimmer switch.\n\n— Turn signal.\n\n— 4-way emergency flashers.\n\n— Parking, clearance, identification, marker switch(es).\n\nCheck Mirrors and Windshield\n\nInspect mirrors and windshield for cracks, dirt, illegal stickers, or other obstructions to seeing clearly.

Then apply firm pressure to the pedal and hold for 5 seconds. The pedal should not move. If it does, there may be a leak or other problem. Get it fixed before driving. If the vehicle has air brakes, do the checks described in Sections 5 and 6 of this handbook.\n\nBrake System\n\nTest the Parking Brake(s)\n\nFasten the safety belt.\n\nSet the parking brake (power unit only).\n\nRelease the trailer parking brake (if applicable).\n\nPlace the vehicle into a low gear.\n\nGently pull forward against the parking brake to make sure the parking brake holds.\n\nRepeat the same steps for the trailer with the trailer parking brake set and the power unit parking brakes released (if applicable).\n\nIf it does not hold the vehicle, it is faulty.

Drivers of trucks and truck tractors transporting cargo must inspect the securement of the cargo within the first 50 miles of a trip and every 150 miles or every 3 hours after (whichever comes first).\n\n2.1.7 – After-Trip Inspection and Report\n\nYou may have to make a written report each day on the condition of the vehicle(s) you drove. Report anything affecting safety or possibly leading to a mechanical breakdown. The vehicle inspection report tells the motor carrier about problems that may need fixing. Keep a copy of your report in the vehicle for 1 day. That way, the next driver can learn about any problems you have found.\n\nSUBSECTION 2.1\n\nTest Your Knowledge\n\nWhat is the most important reason for doing a vehicle inspection?\n\nWhat things should you check during a trip?\n\nName some key steering system parts.\n\nName some suspension system defects.\n\nWhat 3 kinds of emergency equipment must you have?\n\nWhat is the minimum tread depth for front tires? For other tires?\n\nName some things you should check on the front of your vehicle during the walk around inspection.\n\nWhat should wheel bearing seals be checked for?\n\nHow many red reflective triangles should you carry?\n\nHow do you test hydraulic brakes for leaks?\n\nWhy put the starter switch key in your pocket during the vehicle inspection test?\n\nThese questions may be on your test. If you cannot answer them all, reread Subsection 2.1.\n\n2.2 – Basic Control of Your Vehicle\n\nTo drive a vehicle safely, you must be able to control its speed and direction. Safe operation of a CMV requires skill in:\n\nAccelerating.\n\nSteering.\n\nStopping.\n\nBacking safely.\n\nFasten your seatbelt when on the road. Apply the parking brake when you leave your vehicle.\n\n2.2.1 – Accelerating\n\nDo not roll back when you start. You may hit someone behind you. If you have a manual transmission vehicle, partly engage the clutch before you take your right foot off the brake. Apply the parking brake whenever necessary to keep from rolling back. Release the parking brake only when you have applied enough engine power to keep from rolling back. On a tractor-trailer equipped with a trailer brake hand valve, the hand valve can be applied to keep from rolling back.\n\nSpeed up smoothly and gradually so the vehicle does not jerk. Rough acceleration can cause mechanical damage. When pulling a trailer, rough acceleration can damage the coupling. When starting a bus on a level surface with good traction, there is often no need for the parking brake.\n\nSpeed up very gradually when traction is poor, as in rain or snow. If you use too much power, the drive wheels may spin and you could lose control. If the drive wheels begin to spin, take your foot off the accelerator.\n\n2.2.2 – Steering\n\nHold the steering wheel firmly with both hands. Your hands should be on opposite sides of the wheel. If you hit a curb or pothole (chuckhole), the wheel could pull away from your hands unless you have a firm hold.\n\n2.2.3 – Stopping\n\nPush the brake pedal down gradually. The amount of brake pressure you need to stop the vehicle will depend on the speed of the vehicle and how quickly you need to stop. Control the pressure so the vehicle comes to a smooth, safe stop. If you have a manual transmission, push the clutch in when the engine is close to idle.\n\n2.2.4 – Backing Safely\n\nBecause you cannot see everything behind your vehicle, backing is always dangerous. Avoid backing whenever you can. When you park, try to park so you will be able to pull forward when you leave. When you have to back, here are a few simple safety rules:\n\nStart in the proper position.\n\nLook at your path.\n\nUse the mirrors on both sides.\n\nBack slowly.\n\nBack and turn toward the driver’s side whenever possible.\n\nUse a helper whenever possible.\n\nThese rules are discussed as follows.\n\nStart in the Proper Position. Put the vehicle in the best position to allow you to back safely. This position will depend on the type of backing to be done.\n\nLook at Your Path. Look at your line of travel before you begin. Get out and walk around the vehicle. Check your clearance to the sides, and overhead, in, and near the path your vehicle will take.\n\nUse Mirrors on Both Sides. Check the outside mirrors on both sides frequently. Get out of the vehicle and check your path if you are unsure.\n\nBack Slowly. Always back as slowly as possible. Use the lowest reverse gear. That way you can more easily correct any steering errors. You also can stop quickly if necessary.\n\nBack and Turn Toward the Driver’s Side. Back toward the driver’s side so you can see better. Backing toward the right side is very dangerous because you cannot see as well. If you back and turn toward the driver’s side, you can watch the rear of your vehicle by looking out the side window. Use driver-side backing–even if it means going around the block to put your vehicle in this position. The added safety is worth it.\n\nUse a Helper. Use a helper when you can. There are blind spots you cannot see. That is why a helper is important. The helper should stand near the back of your vehicle where you can see them. Before you begin backing, work out a set of hand signals that you both understand. Agree on a signal for “stop.”\n\n2.2.5 – Backing With a Trailer\n\nWhen backing a car, straight truck, or bus, turn the steering wheel toward the direction you want to go. When backing a trailer, turn the steering wheel in the opposite direction. Once the trailer starts to turn, you must turn the wheel the other way to follow the trailer.\n\nWhenever you back with a trailer, try to position your vehicle so you can back in a straight line. If you must back on a curved path, back toward the driver’s side so you can see. Back slowly so you can make corrections before you get too far off course.\n\nCorrect Drift Immediately. As soon as you see the trailer getting off the proper path, correct it by turning the steering wheel in the direction of the drift.\n\nPull Forward. When backing, make pull-ups to reposition your vehicle when needed.\n\n2.3 – Shifting Gears\n\nCorrect shifting of gears is important. If you cannot get your vehicle into the right gear while driving, you will have less control.\n\n2.3.1 – Manual Transmissions\n\nBasic Method for Shifting Up. Most heavy vehicles with unsynchronized manual transmission require double clutching to change gears. If equipped with a synchronized manual transmission, double clutching is not required. This is the method:\n\nRelease the accelerator, push in the clutch, and shift to Neutral at the same time.\n\nRelease the clutch.\n\nLet the engine and gears slow down to the revolutions per minute (rpm) required for the next gear (this takes practice).\n\nPush in the clutch and shift to the higher gear at the same time.\n\nRelease the clutch and press the accelerator at the same time.\n\nShifting gears using double clutching requires practice. If you remain too long in Neutral, you may have difficulty putting the vehicle into the next gear. If so, do not try to force it. Return to Neutral, release the clutch, increase the engine speed to match the road speed, and try again.\n\nKnowing When to Shift Up. There are 2 ways of knowing when to shift:\n\nUse Engine Speed (rpm). Study the driver’s manual for your vehicle and learn the operating rpm range. Watch your tachometer, and shift up when your engine reaches the top of the range. (Some newer vehicles use “progressive” shifting: the rpm at which you shift becomes higher as you move up in the gears. Find out what is right for the vehicle you will operate.)\n\nUse Road Speed (mph). Learn what speeds each gear is good for. Then, by using the speedometer, you will know when to shift up.\n\nWith either method, you may learn to use engine sounds to know when to shift.\n\nBasic Procedures for Shifting Down\n\nRelease the accelerator, push in the clutch, and shift to Neutral at the same time.\n\nRelease the clutch.\n\nPress the accelerator and increase the engine and gear speed to the rpm required in the lower gear.\n\nPush in the clutch and shift to the lower gear at the same time.\n\nRelease the clutch and press the accelerator at the same time.\n\nDownshifting, like upshifting, requires knowing when to shift. Use either the tachometer or the speedometer and downshift at the right rpm or road speed.\n\nSpecial conditions where you should downshift are:\n\nBefore Starting Down a Hill. Slow down and shift down to a speed that you can control without using the brakes hard. Otherwise, the brakes can overheat and lose their braking power. Make sure you are in a low enough gear, usually lower than the gear required to climb the same hill.\n\nBefore Entering a Curve. Slow down to a safe speed, and downshift to the right gear. This lets you use some power through the curve to help the vehicle be more stable while turning. It also allows you to speed up as soon as you are out of the curve.\n\n2.3.2 – Multi-Speed Rear Axles and Auxiliary Transmissions\n\nMulti-speed rear axles and auxiliary transmissions are used on many vehicles to provide extra gears. You usually control them by a selector knob or switch on the gearshift lever of the main transmission. There are many different shift patterns. Learn the right way to shift gears in the vehicle you will drive.\n\n2.3.3 – Automatic Transmissions\n\nSome vehicles have automatic transmissions. You can select a low range to get greater engine braking when going down grades. The lower ranges prevent the transmission from shifting up beyond the selected gear (unless the governor rpm is exceeded). It is very important to use this braking effect when going down grades.\n\n2.3.4 – Retarders\n\nSome vehicles have “retarders.” Retarders help slow a vehicle, reducing the need for using your brakes. They reduce brake wear and give you another way to slow down. There are 4 basic types of retarders (exhaust, engine, hydraulic, and electric). All retarders can be turned on or off by the driver. On some vehicles, the retarding power can be adjusted. When turned “on,” retarders apply their braking power (to the drive wheels only) whenever you let up on the accelerator pedal all the way.\n\nBecause these devices can be noisy, be sure you know where their use is permitted.\n\nCaution. When your drive wheels have poor traction, the retarder may cause them to skid. Therefore, you should turn the retarder off whenever the road is wet, icy, or snow covered.\n\nSUBSECTIONS 2.2 AND 2.3\n\nTest Your Knowledge\n\nWhy should you back toward the driver’s side?\n\nIf stopped on a hill, how can you start moving without rolling back?\n\nWhen backing, why is it important to use a helper?\n\nWhat is the most important hand signal that you and the helper should agree on?\n\nWhat are the 2 special conditions where you should downshift?\n\nWhen should you downshift automatic transmissions?\n\nRetarders keep you from skidding when the road is slippery. True or False?\n\nWhat are the 2 ways to know when to shift?\n\nThese questions may be on the test. If you cannot answer them all, reread Subsections 2.2 and 2.3.\n\n2.4 – Seeing\n\nTo be a safe driver you need to know what is going on all around your vehicle. Not looking properly is a major cause of accidents.\n\n2.4.1 – Seeing Ahead\n\nAll drivers look ahead but many do not look far enough ahead.\n\nImportance of Looking far Enough Ahead.\n\nBecause stopping or changing lanes can take a lot of distance, knowing what the traffic is doing on all sides of you is very important. You need to look well ahead to make sure you have room to make these moves safely.\n\nHow far Ahead to Look. Most good drivers look at least 12 to 15 seconds ahead. That means looking ahead of the distance you will travel in 12 to 15 seconds. At lower speeds, that is about one block. At highway speeds, it is about a quarter of a mile. If you are not looking that far ahead, you may have to stop too quickly or make quick lane changes. Looking 12 to 15 seconds ahead does not mean not paying attention to things that are closer. Good drivers shift their attention back and forth, near and far. Figure 2.6 illustrates how far to look ahead.\n\nFigure 2.6\n\nLook for Traffic. Look for vehicles coming onto the highway, into your lane, or turning. Watch for brake lights from slowing vehicles. By seeing these things far enough ahead, you can adjust your speed, or change lanes if necessary to avoid a problem. If a traffic light has been green for a long time, it will probably change before you get there. Start slowing down and be ready to stop.\n\nRoad Conditions. Look for hills and curves– anything for which you will have to slow or change lanes. Pay attention to traffic signals and signs. Traffic signs may alert you to road conditions where you may have to change speed.\n\n2.4.2 – Seeing to the Sides and Rear\n\nIt is important to know what is going on behind and to the sides of you. Check your mirrors regularly. Check more often in special situations.\n\nEvery California registered motor vehicle must have at least 2 mirrors, including one attached to the left-hand side, and located to give a clear view of the roadway to the rear for a distance of at least 200 feet. Both left and right-hand rear view mirrors are required on a motor vehicle that is constructed or loaded to obscure the driver’s view to the rear, or which is towing a vehicle or load that blocks the view (CVC §26709).\n\nHow to Use Mirrors. Use mirrors correctly by checking them quickly and understanding what you see.\n\nWhen using your mirrors while driving on the road, check them quickly. Look back and forth between the mirrors and the road ahead. Do not focus on the mirrors for too long. Otherwise, you will travel quite a distance without knowing what is happening ahead.\n\nMany large vehicles have curved (convex, “fisheye,” “spot,” “bugeye”) mirrors that show a wider area than flat mirrors. This is often helpful. However, everything appears smaller in a convex mirror than it would if you were looking at it directly. Things also seem farther away than they really are. It is important to realize this and to allow for it. Figure 2.7 shows the field of vision using a convex mirror.\n\nMirror Adjustment. Mirror adjustment should be checked prior to the start of any trip and can only be checked accurately when the trailer(s) are straight. You should check and adjust each mirror to show some part of the vehicle. This will give you a reference point for judging the position of the other images.\n\nRegular Checks. Make regular checks of your mirrors to be aware of traffic and to check your vehicle.\n\nTraffic. Check your mirrors for vehicles on either side and behind you. In an emergency, you may need to know whether you can make a quick lane change. Use your mirrors to spot overtaking vehicles. There are “blind spots” that your mirrors cannot show you. Check your mirrors regularly to know where other vehicles are around you, and to see if they move into your blind spots.\n\nCheck Your Vehicle. Use the mirrors to keep an eye on your tires. It is one way to spot a tire fire. If you are carrying open cargo, you can use the mirrors to check it. Look for loose straps, ropes, or chains. Watch for a flapping or ballooning tarp.\n\nSpecial Situations. Special situations require more than regular mirror checks. These are lane changes, turns, merges, and tight maneuvers.\n\nLane Changes. Check your mirrors to make sure no one is alongside or about to pass you. Check your mirrors:\n\nBefore you change lanes to make sure there is enough room.\n\nAfter you signaled to check that no one has moved into your blind spot.\n\nRight after you start the lane change to double-check that your path is clear.\n\nAfter you complete the lane change.\n\nTurns. In turns, check your mirrors to make sure the rear of your vehicle will not hit anything.\n\nMerges. When merging, use your mirrors to make sure the gap in traffic is large enough for you to enter safely.\n\nTight Maneuvers. Any time you are driving in close quarters, check your mirrors often. Make sure you have enough clearance.\n\nFigure 2.7\n\n2.5 – Communicating\n\n2.5.1 – Signal Your Intentions\n\nOther drivers cannot know what you are going to do until you tell them.\n\nSignaling what you intend to do is important for safety. Here are some general rules for signaling.\n\nTurns. There are 3 good rules for using turn signals:\n\n1. Signal Early. Signal well before you turn. It is the best way to keep others from trying to pass you.\n\n2. Signal Continuously. You need both hands on the wheel to turn safely. Do not cancel the signal until you have completed the turn.\n\n3. Cancel Your Signal. Do not forget to turn off your turn signal after you have turned (if you do not have self-canceling signals).\n\nFor information on vehicles that must be equipped with lamp turn signal systems and two stop lamps, see CVC §§24951 and 24600.\n\nLane Changes. Put your turn signal on before changing lanes. Change lanes slowly and smoothly. That way, a driver you did not see may have a chance to honk their horn, or avoid your vehicle.\n\nSlowing Down. Warn drivers behind you when you see you will need to slow down. A few light taps on the brake pedal — enough to flash the brake lights — should warn following drivers. Use the 4-way emergency flashers for times when you are driving very slowly or are stopped. Warn other drivers in any of the following situations:\n\nTrouble Ahead. The size of your vehicle may make it hard for drivers behind you to see hazards ahead. If you see a hazard that will require slowing down, warn the drivers behind by flashing your brake lights.\n\nTight Turns. Most car drivers do not know how slowly you have to go to make a tight turn in a large vehicle. Give drivers behind you warning by braking early, slowly, and gradually.\n\nStopping on the Road. Truck and bus drivers sometimes stop in the roadway to unload cargo or passengers, or to stop at a railroad crossing. Warn following drivers by flashing your brake lights. Do not stop suddenly.\n\nDriving Slowly. Drivers often do not realize how fast they are catching up to a slow vehicle until they are very close. If you must drive slowly, alert following drivers by turning on your emergency flashers if it is legal. (Laws regarding the use of flashers differ from one state to another. Check the laws of the states where you will drive).\n\nDo Not Direct Traffic. Some drivers try to help out others by signaling when it is safe to pass. You should not do this, it could cause an accident. You could be blamed and it could cost you many thousands of dollars.\n\n2.5.2 – Communicating Your Presence\n\nOther drivers may not notice your vehicle, even when in plain sight. To help prevent accidents, let them know you are there.\n\nWhen Passing. Whenever you are about to pass a vehicle, pedestrian, or bicyclist, assume they do not see you. They could suddenly move in front of you. When it is legal, tap the horn lightly or, at night, flash your lights from low to high beam and back. Drive carefully enough to avoid an accident, even if they do not see or hear you.\n\nWhen It Is Hard to See. At dawn, dusk, in rain, or snow, you need to make yourself easier to see. If you are having trouble seeing other vehicles, other drivers will have trouble seeing you. Turn on your lights. Use the headlights, not just the identification or clearance lights, use the low beams: high beams can bother people in the daytime as well as at night.\n\nWhen Parked at the Side of the Road. When you pull off the road and stop, be sure to turn on the 4-way emergency flashers. This is important at night. Do not trust the taillights to give warning. Drivers have crashed into the rear of a parked vehicle because they thought it was moving normally.\n\nIf you must stop on a road or the shoulder of any road, you must put out your emergency warning devices within 10 minutes. Place your warning devices at the following locations:\n\nIf you must stop on or by a one-way or divided highway, place warning devices 10 feet, 100 feet, and 200 feet toward the approaching traffic. See Figure 2.8.\n\nFigure 2.8\n\nIf you stop on a 2-lane road carrying traffic in both directions or on an undivided highway, place warning devices within 10 feet of the front or rear corners to mark the location of the vehicle and 100 feet behind and ahead of the vehicle, on the shoulder or in the lane you stopped in. See Figure 2.9.\n\nFigure 2.9\n\nBack beyond any hill, curve, or other obstruction that prevents other drivers from seeing the vehicle within 500 feet. If line of sight view is obstructed due to hill or curve, move the rear-most triangle to a point back down the road so warning is provided. See Figure 2.10.\n\nFigure 2.10\n\nWhen putting out the triangles, hold them between yourself and the oncoming traffic for your own safety. (So other drivers can see you.)\n\nUse Your Horn When Needed. Your horn can let others know you are there. It can help to avoid an accident. Use your horn when needed. However, it can startle others and be dangerous when used unnecessarily.\n\n2.6 – Controlling Your Speed\n\nDriving too fast is a major cause of fatal accidents. You must adjust your speed depending on driving conditions. These include traction, curves, visibility, traffic. and hills.\n\n2.6.1 – Stopping Distance\n\nPerception Distance + Reaction Distance + Braking Distance = Total Stopping Distance\n\nPerception Distance. This is the distance your vehicle travels, in ideal conditions, from the time your eyes see a hazard until your brain recognizes it. Keep in mind, certain mental and physical conditions can affect your perception distance. It can be affected greatly, depending on visibility and the hazard itself. The average perception time for an alert driver is 1 3/4 seconds. At 55 mph, this accounts for 142 feet traveled.\n\nReaction Distance. This is the distance you will continue to travel, in ideal conditions, before you physically hit the brakes, in response to a hazard seen ahead. The average driver has a reaction time of 3/4 second to 1 second. At 55 mph, this accounts for 61 feet traveled.\n\nBraking Distance. This is the distance your vehicle will travel, in ideal conditions, while you are braking. At 55 mph, on dry pavement with good brakes, it can take about 216 feet.\n\nTotal Stopping Distance. The total minimum distance your vehicle has traveled, in ideal conditions, with everything considered, including perception distance, reaction distance, and braking distance, until you can bring your vehicle to a complete stop. At 55 mph, your vehicle will travel a minimum of 419 feet. See Figure 2.11 shows the American football field in using distance.\n\nFigure 2.11\n\nEffect of Speed on Stopping Distance. The faster you drive, the greater the impact or striking power of your vehicle. When you double your speed from 20 to 40 mph, the impact is 4 times greater. The braking distance is also 4 times longer. Triple the speed from 20 to 60 mph and the impact and braking distance is 9 times greater. At 60 mph, your stopping distance is greater than the length of an American football field. Increase the speed to 80 mph and the impact and braking distance are 16 times greater than at 20 mph. High speeds greatly increase the severity of accidents and stopping distances. By slowing down, you can reduce braking distance.\n\nEffect of Vehicle Weight on Stopping Distance. The heavier the vehicle, the more work the brakes must do to stop it and the more heat they absorb. The brakes, tires, springs, and shock absorbers on heavy vehicles are designed to work best when the vehicle is fully loaded. Empty trucks require greater stopping distances because an empty vehicle has less traction.\n\nControl and Stopping Requirements. The service brake must hold the vehicle or combination of vehicles stationary on any grade on which it is operated under all conditions of loading or unloading (CVC §26454).\n\nThe service brakes of every motor vehicle or combination of vehicles must be capable of stopping from an initial speed of 20 mph as follows maximum stopping distance (MSD) in feet:\n\nPassenger vehicle—25 MSD\n\nSingle motor vehicle with a manufacturer’s GVWR of less than 10,000 pounds—30 MSD\n\nSingle motor vehicle with a manufacturer’s GVWR of 10,000 pounds or more, or any bus—40 MSD\n\nCombination of vehicles consisting of a passenger vehicle or any motor vehicle with a manufacturer’s GVWR of less than 10,000 pounds in combination with any trailer, semitrailer, or trailer coach—40 MSD\n\nAll other combinations of vehicles—50 MSD\n\n2.6.2 – Matching Speed to the Road Surface\n\nYou cannot steer or brake a vehicle unless you have traction. Traction is friction between the tires and the road. Some road conditions reduce traction and call for lower speeds.\n\nSlippery Surfaces. will take longer to stop, and it will be harder to turn without skidding, when the road is slippery. Wet roads can double stopping distance. You must drive slower to be able to stop in the same distance as on a dry road. Reduce speed by about 1/3 (for example, slow from 55 to about 35 mph) on a wet road. On packed snow, reduce speed by a half or more. If the surface is icy, reduce speed to a crawl and stop driving as soon as you can safely do so.\n\nIdentifying Slippery Surfaces. Sometimes it is hard to know if the road is slippery. Here are some signs of slippery roads:\n\nShaded Areas. Shady parts of the road will remain icy and slippery long after open areas have melted.\n\nBridges. When the temperature drops, bridges will freeze before the road will. Be especially careful when the temperature is close to 32 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nMelting Ice. Slight melting will make ice wet. Wet ice is much more slippery than ice that is not wet.\n\nBlack Ice. Black ice is a thin layer that is clear enough that you can see the road underneath it. It makes the road look wet. Any time the temperature is below freezing and the road looks wet, watch out for black ice.\n\nVehicle Icing. An easy way to check for ice is to open the window and feel the front of the mirror, mirror support, or antenna. If there is ice on these, the road surface is probably starting to ice up.\n\nJust After Rain Begins. Right after it starts to rain, the water mixes with oil left on the road by vehicles. This makes the road very slippery. If the rain continues, it will wash the oil away.\n\nHydroplaning. In some weather, water or slush collects on the road. When this happens, your vehicle can hydroplane. It is like water skiing–the tires lose their contact with the road and have little or no traction. You may not be able to steer or brake. You can regain control by releasing the accelerator and pushing in the clutch. This will slow your vehicle and let the wheels turn freely. If the vehicle is hydroplaning, do not use the brakes to slow down. If the drive wheels start to skid, push in the clutch to let them turn freely.\n\nIt does not take a lot of water to cause hydroplaning. Hydroplaning can occur at speeds as low as 30 mph if there is a lot of water. Hydroplaning is more likely if tire pressure is low, or the tread is worn. (The grooves in a tire carry away the water: if the grooves are not deep, they do not work well.)\n\nRoad surfaces where water can collect may create conditions that cause a vehicle to hydroplane. Watch for clear reflections, tire splashes, and raindrops on the road. These are indications of standing water.\n\n2.6.3 – Speed and Curves\n\nDrivers must adjust their speed for curves in the road. If you take a curve too fast, two things can happen. The tires can lose their traction and continue straight ahead, so you skid off the road. Or, the tires may keep their traction and the vehicle rolls over.\n\nSlow to a safe speed before you enter a curve. Braking in a curve is dangerous because it is easier to lock the wheels and cause a skid. Slow down as needed. Do not ever exceed the posted speed limit for the curve. Be in a gear that will let you accelerate slightly in the curve. This will help you keep control.\n\n2.6.4 – Speed and Distance Ahead\n\nYou should always be able to stop within the distance you can see ahead. Fog, rain, or other conditions may require that you slow down to be able to stop in the distance you can see. At night, you cannot see as far with low beams as you can with high beams. Slow down when you must use your low beams.\n\n2.6.5 – Speed and Traffic Flow\n\nWhen you are driving in heavy traffic, the safest speed is the speed of other vehicles. Vehicles going the same direction at the same speed are not likely to run into one another. In California, speed limits are lower for trucks and buses than for cars. It can vary as much as 15 mph. Use extra caution when you change lanes or pass on these roadways. Drive at the speed of the traffic, if you can without going at an illegal or unsafe speed. Keep a safe following distance.\n\nThe main reason drivers exceed speed limits is to save time. Anyone trying to drive faster than the speed of traffic will not be able to save much time. The risks involved are not worth it. If you go faster than the speed of other traffic, you will have to keep passing other vehicles. This increases the chance of an accident, and it is more tiring. Fatigue increases the chance of an accident. Going with the flow of traffic is safer and easier.\n\n2.6.6 – Speed on Downgrades\n\nYour vehicle’s speed will increase on downgrades because of gravity. Your most important objective is to select and maintain a speed that is not too fast for the:\n\nTotal weight of the vehicle and cargo.\n\nLength of the grade.\n\nSteepness of the grade.\n\nRoad conditions.\n\nWeather.\n\nIf a speed limit is posted, or there is a sign indicating “Maximum Safe Speed,” never exceed the speed shown. Also, look for and heed warning signs indicating the length and steepness of the grade. You must use the braking effect of the engine as the principal way of controlling your speed on downgrades. The braking effect of the engine is greatest when it is near the governed rpms and the transmission is in the lower gears. Save your brakes so you will be able to slow or stop as required by road and traffic conditions. Shift your transmission to a low gear before starting down the grade and use the proper braking techniques. Carefully read the information on going down long, steep downgrades safely in Subsections 2.16 Mountain Driving in this handbook.\n\n2.6.7 – Roadway Work Zones\n\nSpeeding traffic is the number one cause of injury and death in roadway work zones. Observe the posted speed limits at all times when approaching and driving through a work zone. Watch your speedometer, and do not allow your speed to creep up as you drive through long sections of road construction. Decrease your speed for adverse weather or road conditions. Decrease your speed even further when a worker is close to the roadway.\n\n2.6.8 – Overtaking or Following Another Vehicle\n\nYou may not overtake and pass another vehicle which is moving at less than 20 mph on a grade (outside a business or residential district) unless you can pass that vehicle at least 10 mph faster than it is travelling and the pass can be completed within 1/4 mile (CVC §21758). You must not follow the vehicles listed below any closer than 300 feet. The rule does not apply during overtaking and passing, when there are 2 or more lanes for traffic in each direction, or in a business or residential district (CVC §21704).\n\nA motor truck or truck tractor having 3 or more axles.\n\nAny motor truck or truck tractor towing any other vehicle.\n\nA passenger vehicle or bus towing any other vehicle.\n\nA school bus transporting any school pupil.\n\nA farm labor vehicle when transporting passengers.\n\nA vehicle transporting explosives.\n\nA trailer bus.\n\nWhen large vehicles are being driven in caravan on the open highway, at least 100 feet must be left between them to allow other vehicles to overtake and pass them (CVC §21705).\n\nSUBSECTIONS 2.4, 2.5 AND 2.6\n\nTest Your Knowledge\n\nHow far ahead does the handbook say you should look?\n\nWhat are two main things to look for ahead?\n\nWhat’s your most important way to see the sides and rear of your vehicle?\n\nWhat does “communicating” mean in safe driving?\n\nWhere should your reflectors be placed when stopped on a divided highway?\n\nWhat 3 things add up to total stopping distance?\n\nIf you go twice as fast, will your stopping distance increase by 2 or 4 times?\n\nEmpty trucks have the best braking. True or False?\n\nWhat is hydroplaning?\n\nWhat is black ice?\n\nThese questions may be on the test. If you cannot answer them all, reread Subsections 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6.\n\n2.7 – Managing Space\n\nYou need space all around your vehicle to be a safe driver. When things go wrong, space gives you time to think and take action.\n\nYou need to manage space to have space available when something goes wrong. While this is true for all drivers, it is very important for large vehicles. They take up more space and require more space for stopping and turning.\n\n2.7.1 – Space Ahead\n\nOf all the space around your vehicle, it is the area ahead of the vehicle–the space you are driving into, that is most important.\n\nNeed for Space Ahead. You need space ahead in case you must suddenly stop. Remember, if the vehicle ahead of you is smaller than yours, it can probably stop faster than you can. You may crash if you are following too closely.\n\nHow Much Space? How much space should you keep in front of you? One good rule says you need at least 1 second for each 10 feet of vehicle length at speeds below 40 mph. At greater speeds, you must add 1 second for safety. For example, if you are driving a 40-foot vehicle, you should leave 4 seconds between you and the vehicle ahead. In a 60-foot rig, you will need 6 seconds. Over 40 mph, you would need 5 seconds for a 40-foot vehicle and 7 seconds for a 60-foot vehicle. See Figure 2.12.\n\nTo know how much space you have, wait until the vehicle ahead passes a shadow on the road, a pavement marking, or some other clear landmark. Then count off the seconds like this: “one thousand-and-one, one thousand-and-two” and so on, until you reach the same spot. Compare your count with the rule of 1 second for every 10 feet of length.\n\nIf you are driving a 40-foot truck and only counted up to 2 seconds, you are too close. Drop back a little and count again until you have 4 seconds of following distance (or 5 seconds, if you are going over 40 mph). After a little practice, you will know how far back you should be. Remember to add 1 second for speeds above 40 mph. Also, remember that when the road is slippery, you need more space to stop.\n\n2.7.2 – Space Behind\n\nYou cannot stop others from following you too closely, but there are things you can do to make it safer.\n\nStay to the Right. Heavy vehicles are often tailgated when they cannot keep up with the speed of traffic. This often happens when you are going uphill. If a heavy load is slowing you down, stay in the right lane if you can. Going uphill,you should not pass another slow vehicle unless you can get around quickly and safely.\n\nDealing With Tailgaters Safely. In a large vehicle, it is often hard to see whether a vehicle is close behind you. You may be tailgated:\n\n— When you are Traveling Slowly. Drivers trapped behind slow vehicles often follow closely.\n\n— In Bad Weather. Many small vehicle drivers follow large vehicles closely during bad weather, especially when it is hard to see the road ahead.\n\nIf you find yourself being tailgated, here are some things you can do to reduce the chances of an accident:\n\nAvoid Quick Changes. If you have to slow down or turn, signal early, and reduce speed very gradually.\n\nIncrease Your Following Distance. Open up room in front of you to help you avoid having to make sudden speed or direction changes. It also makes it easier for the tailgater to get around you.\n\nDo Not Speed Up. It is safer to be tailgated at a low speed than a high speed.\n\nAvoid Tricks. Do not turn on your taillights or flash your brake lights. Follow the suggestions above.\n\n2.7.3 – Space to the Sides\n\nCMVs are often wide and take up most of a lane. Safe drivers will manage what little space they have. You can do this by keeping your vehicle centered in your lane, and avoiding driving alongside others.\n\nStaying Centered in a Lane. Keep your vehicle centered in the lane to keep a safe clearance on either side. If your vehicle is wide, you have little room to spare.\n\nTraveling Next to Others. There are 2 dangers in traveling alongside other vehicles:\n\nAnother driver may change lanes suddenly and turn into you.\n\nYou may be trapped when you need to change lanes.\n\nFind an open spot where you are not near other traffic. When traffic is heavy, it may be hard to find an open spot. If you must travel near other vehicles, try to keep as much space as possible between you and them. Also, drop back or pull forward so that you are sure the other driver can see you.\n\nStrong Winds. Strong winds make it difficult to stay in your lane. The problem is usually worse for lighter vehicles. This problem can be especially bad coming out of tunnels. Do not drive alongside others if you can avoid it.\n\n2.7.4 – Space Overhead\n\nHitting overhead objects is a danger. Make sure you always have overhead clearance.\n\nDo not assume that the heights posted at bridges and overpasses are correct. Repaving or packed snow may have reduced the clearances since the heights were posted.\n\nThe weight of a cargo van changes its height. An empty van is higher than a loaded one. Clearing under a bridge when your CMV was loaded does not mean it will clear when you are empty.\n\nIf you doubt you have safe space to pass under an object, go slowly. If you are not sure you can make it, take another route. Warnings are often posted on low bridges or underpasses, but sometimes they are not.\n\nSome roads can cause a vehicle to tilt. There can be a problem clearing objects along the edge of the road, such as signs, trees, or bridge supports. Where this is a problem, drive a little closer to the center of the road.\n\nBefore you back into an area, get out and check for overhanging objects such as trees, branches, or electric wires. It is easy to miss seeing them while you are backing. Also, check for other hazards at the same time.\n\n2.7.5 – Space Below\n\nMany drivers forget about the space under their vehicles. This space can be very small when a vehicle is heavily loaded. This is often a problem on dirt roads and unpaved yards. Do not take a chance on getting hung up. Drainage channels across roads can cause the ends of some vehicles to drag. Cross such depressions carefully.\n\nRailroad tracks can also cause problems, particularly when pulling trailers with a low underneath clearance. Do not take a chance on getting hung up halfway across.\n\n2.7.6 – Space for Turns\n\nThe space around a truck or bus is important in turns. Large vehicles can hit other vehicles or objects during turns because of wide turning and off-tracking.\n\nRight Turns. Here are some rules to help prevent right-turn accidents:\n\nTurn slowly to give yourself and others more time to avoid problems.\n\nIf you are driving a truck or bus that cannot make the right turn without swinging into another lane, turn wide as you complete the turn. Keep the rear of your vehicle close to the curb. This will stop other drivers from passing you on the right.\n\nDo not turn wide to the left as you start the turn. A following driver may think you are turning left and try to pass you on the right. You may crash into the other vehicle as you complete your turn.\n\nIf you must cross into the oncoming lane to make a turn, watch out for vehicles coming toward you. Give them room to go by or stop. However, do not back up for them because you might hit someone behind you. See Figure 2.13.\n\nFigure 2.13\n\nLeft Turns. On a left turn, make sure you reach the center of the intersection before you start the left turn. If you turn too soon, the left side of your vehicle may hit another vehicle because of off-tracking.\n\nIf there are 2 turning lanes, always take the right turn lane. Do not start in the inside lane because you may have to swing right to make the turn. Drivers on your left can be more readily seen. See Figure 2.14.\n\n2.7.7 – Space Needed to Cross or Enter Traffic\n\nBe aware of the size and weight of your vehicle when you cross or enter traffic. Here are some important things to keep in mind:\n\nBecause of slow acceleration and the space large vehicles require, you may need a much larger gap to enter traffic than you would in a car.\n\nAcceleration varies with the load. Allow more room if your vehicle is heavily loaded.\n\nBefore you start across a road, make sure you can get all the way across before traffic reaches you.\n\n2.8 – Seeing Hazards\n\n2.8.1 – Importance of Seeing Hazards\n\nWhat is a Hazard? A hazard is any road condition or other road user (driver, motorcyclist, bicyclist, and pedestrian) that is a possible danger. For example, a vehicle in front of you is headed toward the freeway exit, the brake lights come on and they begin braking hard. This could mean the driver is uncertain about taking the off ramp. They might suddenly return to the highway. This vehicle is a hazard. If the vehicle cuts in front of you, it is no longer just a hazard; it is an emergency.\n\nSeeing Hazards Lets you be Prepared. You will have more time to act if you see hazards before they become emergencies. In the example above, you might make a lane change or slow down to prevent an accident if the vehicle suddenly cuts in front of you. Seeing this hazard gives you time to check your mirrors and signal a lane change. Being prepared reduces the danger. A driver who did not see the hazard until the slow vehicle pulled back on the highway in front of them would have to do something very suddenly. Sudden braking or a quick lane change is more likely to lead to an accident.\n\nLearning to See Hazards. There are often clues to help you see hazards. The more you drive, the better you can learn to see hazards. This section will talk about hazards that you should be aware of.\n\n2.8.2 – Hazardous Roads\n\nMove-Over Laws\n\nThe incidents of law enforcement officers, emergency medical services, fire department personnel, and people working on the road being struck while performing duties at the roadside are increasing at a frightening pace. Move-over laws have been enacted, which require drivers to slow and change lanes when approaching a roadside incident, to lessen the problem. Signs are posted on roadways in states that have such laws.\n\nWhen approaching an authorized emergency vehicle stopped on the roadside or a work zone, proceed with caution by slowing and yielding the right-of-way by changing into a lane not next to that of the authorized emergency vehicle or work zone if safety and traffic conditions permit. If a lane change is unsafe, slow down and proceed with caution while maintaining a safe speed for traffic conditions.\n\nIn California, failing to obey the move-over law is an infraction, punishable by a fine (CVC §21809).\n\nSlow down and be very careful if you see any of the following road hazards:\n\nWork Zones. When people are working on the road, it is a hazard. There may be narrower lanes, sharp turns, or uneven surfaces. Other drivers are often distracted and drive unsafely. Workers and construction vehicles may get in the way. Drive slowly and carefully near work zones. Use your 4-way emergency flashers or brake lights to warn drivers behind you.\n\nDrop Off. Sometimes the pavement drops off sharply near the edge of the road. Driving too near the edge can tilt your vehicle toward the side of the road. This can cause the top of your vehicle to hit roadside objects (such as signs, or tree limbs). Also, it can be hard to steer as you cross the drop off, go off the road, or come back on.\n\nForeign Objects. Things that have fallen on the road can be hazards. They can be a danger to your tires and wheel rims. They can damage electrical and brake lines. They can be caught between dual tires and cause severe damage. Some obstacles that appear to be harmless can be very dangerous. For example, cardboard boxes may be empty, but they may also contain some solid or heavy material capable of causing damage. The same is true of paper and cloth sacks. It is important to remain alert for objects of all sorts, so you can see them early enough to avoid them without making sudden, unsafe moves.\n\nOff Ramps/On Ramps. Freeway and turnpike exits can be particularly dangerous for CMVs. Off and on ramps often have speed limit signs posted. Remember, these speeds may be safe for small vehicles, but may not be safe for larger vehicles or heavily loaded vehicles. Exits that go downhill and turn at the same time can be especially dangerous. The downgrade makes it difficult to reduce speed. Braking and turning at the same time can be a dangerous practice. Make sure you are going slowly enough before you get on the curved part of an off or on ramp.\n\n2.8.3 – Drivers who Are Hazards\n\nIn order to protect yourself and others, you must know when other drivers may do something hazardous. Some clues to this type of hazard are discussed below.\n\nBlocked Vision. People who cannot see others are a very dangerous hazard. Be alert for drivers whose vision is blocked. Vans, loaded station wagons, and small vehicles with the rear window blocked are examples. Rental trucks should be watched carefully. Their drivers are often not used to the limited vision they have to the sides and rear of the truck. In winter, vehicles with frosted, ice-covered, or snow-covered windows are hazards.\n\nVehicles may be partly hidden by blind intersections or alleys. If you only can see the rear or front end of a vehicle but not the driver, then they cannot see you. Be alert because they may back out or enter into your lane. Always be prepared to stop.\n\nDelivery Trucks Can Present a Hazard. Packages or vehicle doors often block the driver’s vision. Drivers of step vans, postal vehicles, and local delivery vehicles are often in a hurry and may suddenly step out of their vehicle or drive their vehicle into the traffic lane.\n\nParked Vehicles Can Be Hazards. People may start to get out of their vehicles, or they may suddenly start up and drive into your way. Watch for movement inside the vehicle or movement of the vehicle itself that shows people are inside. Watch for brake lights, backup lights, exhaust, and other clues that a driver is about to move.\n\nBe careful of a stopped bus. Passengers may cross in front of or behind the bus, and they often cannot see you.\n\nPedestrians and Bicyclists Can Also Be Hazards. Walkers, joggers, and bicyclists may be on the road with their back to the traffic, so they cannot see you. Sometimes they wear portable stereos with headsets, so they cannot hear you either. This can be dangerous. On rainy days, pedestrians may not see you because of hats or umbrellas. They may be hurrying out of the rain and may not pay attention to the traffic.\n\nDistractions. People who are distracted are hazards. Watch where they are looking. If they are looking elsewhere, they cannot see you. Be alert even when they are looking at you. They may believe they have the right of way.\n\nChildren. Children tend to act quickly without checking traffic. Children playing with one another may not look for traffic and are a serious hazard.\n\nTalkers. Drivers or pedestrians talking to one another may not be paying close attention to the traffic.\n\nWorkers. People working on or near the roadway are a hazard clue. The work creates a distraction for other drivers and the workers themselves may not see you.\n\nIce Cream Trucks. Someone selling ice cream is a hazard clue. Children may be nearby and may not see you.\n\nDisabled Vehicles. Drivers changing a tire or fixing an engine often do not pay attention to the danger roadway traffic is to them. They are often careless. Jacked up wheels or raised hoods are hazard clues.\n\nAccidents. Accidents are particularly hazardous. People involved in the accident may not look for traffic. Passing drivers tend to look at the accident. People often run across the road without looking. Vehicles may slow or stop suddenly.\n\nShoppers. People in and around shopping areas are often not watching traffic because they are looking for stores or looking into store windows. People often run across the parking lot without looking. Vehicles may slow down or suddenly stop.\n\nConfused Drivers. Confused drivers often change direction suddenly or stop without warning. Confusion is common near freeway or turnpike interchanges and major intersections. Tourists unfamiliar with the area can be very hazardous. Clues to tourists include car-top luggage and out-of state license plates. Unexpected actions (stopping in the middle of a block, changing lanes for no apparent reason, backup lights suddenly going on) are clues to confusion. Hesitation is another clue, including driving very slowly, using brakes often, or stopping in the middle of an intersection. You may also see drivers who are looking at street signs, maps, and house numbers. These drivers may not be paying attention to you.\n\nSlow Drivers. Motorists who fail to maintain normal speed are hazards. Seeing slow moving vehicles early can prevent an accident. Some vehicles, by their nature, are slow and seeing them is a hazard clue (mopeds, farm machinery, construction machinery, tractors, etc.). Some of these will have the “slow moving vehicle” emblem to warn you. This is a red triangle with an orange center.\n\nVehicles displaying this emblem are not designed to attain a speed greater than 25 mph (CVC 385.5).\n\nDrivers Signaling a Turn May Be a Hazard. Drivers signaling a turn may slow more than expected or stop. If they are making a tight turn into an alley or driveway, they may go very slowly. If pedestrians or other vehicles block them, they may have to stop on the roadway. Vehicles turning left may have to stop for oncoming vehicles.\n\nDrivers in a Hurry. Drivers may feel your CMV is preventing them from getting where they want to go on time. Such drivers may pass you without a safe gap in the oncoming traffic, cutting too close in front of you. Drivers entering the road may pull in front of you in order to avoid being stuck behind you, causing you to brake. Be aware of this and watch for drivers who are in a hurry.\n\nImpaired Drivers. Drivers who are sleepy, have had too much to drink, are on drugs, or are ill are hazards. Some clues to these drivers are:\n\nWeaving across the road or drifting from one side to another.\n\nLeaving the road (dropping right wheels onto the shoulder, or bumping across a curb in a turn).\n\nStopping at the wrong time (stopping at a green light, or waiting for too long at a stop).\n\nOpen window in cold weather.\n\nSpeeding up or slowing down suddenly and driving too fast or too slow.\n\nBe alert for drunk drivers and sleepy drivers late at night.\n\nDriver Body Movement as a Clue. Drivers look in the direction they are going to turn. You may sometimes get a clue from a driver’s head and body movements that a driver may be going to make a turn, even though the turn signals are not on. Drivers making over-the-shoulder checks may be going to change lanes. These clues are most easily seen in motorcyclists and bicyclists. Watch other road users and try to tell whether they might do something hazardous.\n\nConflicts. You are in conflict when you have to change speed and/or direction to avoid hitting someone. Conflicts occur at intersections where vehicles meet, at merges (such as turnpike on ramps) and where lane changes are needed (such as the end of a lane, forcing a move to another lane of traffic). Other situations include slow moving or stalled traffic in a traffic lane, and accident scenes. Watch for other drivers who are in conflict because they are a hazard to you. When they react to this conflict, they may do something that will put them in conflict with you.\n\n2.8.4 – Always Have a Plan\n\nYou should always be looking for hazards. Continue to learn to see hazards on the road. However, do not forget why you are looking for the hazards—they may turn into emergencies. Look for the hazards to have time to plan a way out of any emergency. When you see a hazard, think about the emergencies that could develop and figure out what you would do. Always be prepared to take action based on your plans. In this way, you will be a prepared, defensive driver who will improve your own safety as well as the safety of all road users.\n\nSUBSECTIONS 2.7 AND 2.8\n\nTest Your Knowledge\n\nHow do you find out how many seconds of following distance space you have?\n\nIf you are driving a 30-foot vehicle at 55 mph, how many seconds of following distance should you allow?\n\nYou should decrease your following distance if somebody is following you too closely. True or False?\n\nIf you swing wide to the left before turning right, another driver may try to pass you on the right. True or False?\n\nWhat is a hazard?\n\nWhy make emergency plans when you see a hazard?\n\nThese questions may be on the test. If you cannot answer them all, reread Subsections 2.7 and 2.8.\n\n2.9 – Distracted Driving\n\nA driver distraction is anything that takes your attention away from driving. Whenever you are driving a vehicle and your full attention is not on the driving task, you are putting yourself, your passengers, other vehicles, and pedestrians in danger. Distracted driving can cause accidents, resulting in injury, death, or property damage.\n\nActivities inside the vehicle that can distract your attention include: talking to passengers; adjusting the radio, CD player or climate controls; eating, drinking, smoking; reading maps or other literature; picking up something that fell; talking on a cell phone or citizens band (CB) radio; reading or sending text messages; using any type of telematics or electronic devices (such as navigation systems, pagers, personal digital assistant, computers, etc.); daydreaming or being occupied with other mental distractions; and many others.\n\nPossible distractions that could occur outside a moving vehicle: traffic, vehicles, or pedestrians; events such as police pulling someone over, an accident scene or road construction; sunlight/sunset; objects in roadway; reading billboards or other road advertisements; and many others.\n\n2.9.1 – The Distracted Driving Crash Problem\n\nThe Large Truck Crash Causation Study (LTCCS) reported that 8 percent of large-truck accidents occurred when CMV drivers were externally distracted and 2 percent of large-truck accidents occurred when the driver was internally distracted.\n\nApproximately 5,500 people are killed each year on U.S. roadways and an estimated 448,000 are injured in motor vehicle accidents involving distracted driving (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA] Traffic Safety Facts: Distracted Driving).\n\nResearch indicates that the burden of talking on a cell phone–even if it is hands-free–saps the brain of 39 percent of the energy it would ordinarily devote to safe driving. Drivers who use a handheld device are more likely to get into an accident serious enough to cause injury. (For more information, visit the NHTSA Distracted Driving web page at distraction.gov.)\n\n2.9.2 – Effects of Distracted Driving\n\nEffects of distracted driving include slowed perception, which may cause you to be delayed in perceiving or completely fail to perceive an important traffic event. Delayed decision making and improper action can cause you to be delayed in taking the proper action or make incorrect inputs to the steering, accelerator, or brakes.\n\n2.9.3 – Types of Distractions\n\nThere are many causes of distraction, all with the potential to increase risk.\n\nPhysical Distraction – causes you to take your hands off the wheel or eyes off the road, such as reaching for an object.\n\nMental Distraction – takes your mind away from the road, such as engaging in conversation with a passenger or thinking about something that happened during the day.\n\nBoth Physical and Mental Distraction – creates an even greater chance an accident could happen, such as talking on a cellphone, or sending or reading text messages.\n\n2.9.4 – Cell/Mobile Phones\n\nCFR, Title 49, Part 383, 384, 390, 391, and 392 and the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) restricts the use of hand-held mobile telephones by drivers of CMVs and implements new driver disqualification sanctions for drivers of CMVs who fail to comply with this federal restriction, or have multiple convictions for violating a state or local law or ordinance on motor vehicle traffic control that restricts the use of hand-held mobile telephones. Additionally, motor carriers are prohibited from requiring or allowing drivers of CMVs to use hand-held mobile telephones.\n\nThe use of hand-held mobile telephones means using at least one hand to hold a mobile telephone to conduct a voice communication; dialing a mobile telephone by pressing more than a single button; or moving from a seated driving position while restrained by a seat belt to reach for a mobile telephone. If you choose to use a mobile phone while operating a CMV, you may only use a hands-free mobile phone that is located close to you and can be operated in compliance with the rule to conduct a voice communication.\n\nYour CDL will be disqualified after 2 or more convictions of any state law on hand-held mobile telephone use while operating a CMV. Disqualification is 60 days for the second offense within 3 years and 120 days for 3 or more offenses within 3 years. In addition, the first and each subsequent violation of such a prohibition are subject to civil penalties imposed on such drivers. Motor carriers must not allow nor require drivers to use a hand-held mobile telephone while driving. Employers may also be subject to civil penalties. There is an emergency exception that allows you to use your hand-held mobile telephone if necessary to communicate with law enforcement officials or other emergency services.\n\nResearch shows the odds of being involved in a safety-critical event (for example, accident, near-accident, or unintentional lane deviation) is 6 times greater for CMV drivers who engage in dialing a mobile telephone while driving than for those who do not. Dialing drivers took their eyes off the forward roadway for an average of 3.8 seconds. At 55 mph (or 80.7 feet per second), this equates to a driver traveling 306 feet (approximate length of an American football field) without looking at the roadway.\n\nYour primary responsibility is to operate a motor vehicle safely. To do this, you must focus your full attention on the driving task.\n\nNote that hands-free devices are no less likely than hand-held cell phones to cause you to become distracted. Attention is diverted from the driving task while using either device.\n\nIn California, you are not allowed to use an electronic device while driving unless it is hands-free. Even these devices are unsafe to use when you are driving down the road.\n\nIf you must use your electronic communication device while driving, follow these tips:\n\nTry to keep it brief and never use the electronic device for social visiting.\n\nHang up your cell phone in difficult traffic situations.\n\nDo not use the vehicle’s equipment or any electronic communication device when approaching locations with heavy traffic, road construction, heavy pedestrian traffic, or severe weather conditions.\n\nDo not attempt to type or read messages.\n\n2.9.5 – Texting\n\nCFR, Title 49, Part 383, 384, 390, 391, 392, and the FMCSR prohibits texting by CMV drivers while operating in interstate commerce, and implements new driver disqualification sanctions for drivers of CMVs who fail to comply with this federal prohibition, or who have multiple convictions for violating a state or local law or ordinance on motor vehicle traffic control that prohibits texting while driving. Additionally, motor carriers are prohibited from requiring or allowing their drivers to engage in texting while driving.\n\nTexting means manually entering text into, or reading text from, an electronic device. This includes, but is not limited to, short message service, emailing, instant messaging, a command or request to access a webpage, or engaging in any other form of electronic text retrieval or entry, for present or future communication.\n\nElectronic device includes, but is not limited to, a cellular telephone, personal digital assistant, pager, computer; or any other device used to enter, write, send, receive, or read text.\n\nYour CDL will be disqualified after 2 or more convictions of any state law on texting while operating a CMV. Disqualification is 60 days for the second offense within 3 years and 120 days for 3 or more offenses within 3 years. In addition, the first and each subsequent violation of such a prohibition are subject to civil penalties imposed on such drivers, in an amount up to $2,750. No motor carrier shall allow or require its drivers to engage in texting while driving. There is an emergency exception that allows you to text if necessary to communicate with law enforcement officials or other emergency services.\n\nEvidence suggests text messaging is even riskier than talking on a cell phone because it requires you to look at a small screen and manipulate the keypad with your hands. Texting is the most alarming distraction because it involves both physical and mental distraction simultaneously.\n\nResearch shows that the odds of being involved in a safety-critical event (such as an accident, near- accident, unintentional lane deviation) is 23.2 times greater for CMV drivers who engage in texting while driving than for those who do not. Sending or receiving text takes your eyes from the road for an average of 4.6 seconds. At 55 mph, you would travel 371 feet (the length of an entire American football field) without looking at the roadway.\n\n2.9.6 – Do Not Drive Distracted\n\nYour goal should be to eliminate all in-vehicle distractions before driving begins. Accomplishing this goal can be done by:\n\nAssessing all potential in-vehicle distractions before driving.\n\nDeveloping a preventative plan to reduce/eliminate possible distractions.\n\nExpecting distractions to occur.\n\nDiscussing possible scenarios before getting behind the wheel.\n\nBased on the assessment of potential distractions, you can formulate a preventative plan to reduce/ eliminate possible distractions.\n\nIf drivers react a half-second slower because of distractions, accidents double. Some tips to follow so you will not become distracted:\n\nTurn off all communication devices.\n\nIf you must use a mobile phone, make sure it is within close proximity that it is operable while you are restrained, use an earpiece or the speaker phone function, use voice-activated dialing, and use the hands-free feature. Drivers are not in compliance if they unsafely reach for a mobile phone, even if they intend to use the hands-free function.\n\nDo not type or read a text message on a mobile device while driving.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with your vehicle’s features and equipment before you get behind the wheel.\n\nAdjust all vehicle controls and mirrors to your preferences prior to driving.\n\nPreprogram radio stations and preload your favorite CDs.\n\nClear the vehicle of any unnecessary objects and secure cargo.\n\nReview maps, program the GPS, and plan your route before you begin driving.\n\nDo not attempt to read or write while you drive.\n\nAvoid smoking, eating, and drinking while you drive. Leave early to allow yourself time to stop to eat.\n\nDo not engage in complex or emotionally intense conversations with other occupants.\n\nSecure commitment from other occupants to behave responsibly and support the driver in reducing distractions.\n\n2.9.7 – Watch Out for Other Distracted Drivers\n\nYou need to be able to recognize other drivers who are engaged in any form of driving distraction. Not recognizing other distracted drivers can prevent you from perceiving or reacting correctly in time to prevent an accident. Watch for:\n\nVehicles that may drift over the lane divider lines or within their own lane.\n\nVehicles traveling at inconsistent speeds.\n\nDrivers who are preoccupied with maps, food, cigarettes, cell phones, or other objects.\n\nDrivers who appear to be involved in conversations with their passengers.\n\nGive a distracted driver plenty of room and maintain your safe following distance.\n\nBe very careful when passing a driver who seems to be distracted. That driver may not be aware of your presence, and they may drift in front of you.\n\n2.10 – Aggressive Drivers/Road Rage\n\n2.10.1 – What Is It?\n\nAggressive driving and road rage is not a new problem. However, in today’s world, where heavy and slow-moving traffic and tight schedules are the norm, more and more drivers are taking out their anger and frustration in their vehicles.\n\nCrowded roads leave little room for error, leading to suspicion and hostility among drivers and encouraging them to take personally the mistakes of other drivers.\n\nAggressive driving is the act of operating a motor vehicle in a selfish, bold, or pushy manner, without regard for the rights or safety of others.One sign of an aggressive driver is a driver changing lanes frequently and abruptly without notice.\n\nRoad rage is operating a motor vehicle with the intent of doing harm to others or physically assaulting a driver or their vehicle.\n\n2.10.2 – Do Not Be an Aggressive Driver\n\nHow you feel before you start your vehicle has a lot to do with how stress will affect you while driving.\n\nReduce your stress before and while you drive. Listen to “easy listening” music.\n\nGive the drive your full attention. Do not allow yourself to become distracted by talking on your cell phone, eating, etc.\n\nBe realistic about your travel time. Expect delays because of traffic, construction, or bad weather, and make allowances.\n\nIf you are going to be later than you expected – deal with it. Take a deep breath and accept the delay.\n\nGive other drivers the benefit of the doubt. Try to imagine why he or she is driving that way. Whatever their reason, it has nothing to do with you.\n\nSlow down and keep your following distance reasonable.\n\nDo not drive slowly in the left lane of traffic.\n\nAvoid gestures. Keep your hands on the wheel. Avoid making any gestures that might anger another driver, even seemingly harmless expressions of irritation like shaking your head.\n\nBe a cautious and courteous driver. If another driver seems eager to get in front of you, say, “Be my guest.” This response will soon become a habit and you will not be as offended by other drivers’ actions.\n\n2.10.3 – What You Should Do When Confronted by an Aggressive Driver\n\nFirst and foremost, make every attempt to get out of their way.\n\nPut aside your pride. Do not challenge them by speeding up or attempting to hold-your-own in your travel lane.\n\nAvoid eye contact.\n\nIgnore gestures and refuse to react to them.\n\nReport aggressive drivers to the appropriate authorities by providing a vehicle description, license number, location and, if possible, direction of travel.\n\nIf you have a cell phone and can use it safely, call the police.\n\nIf an aggressive driver is involved in an accident farther down the road, stop a safe distance from the accident scene, wait for the police to arrive, and report the driving behavior you witnessed.\n\nSUBSECTIONS 2.9 AND 2.10\n\nTest Your Knowledge\n\nWhat are some tips to follow so you will not become a distracted driver?\n\nHow do you use in-vehicle communications equipment cautiously?\n\nHow do you recognize a distracted driver?\n\nWhat is the difference between aggressive driving and road rage?\n\nWhat should you do when confronted with an aggressive driver?\n\nWhat are some things you can do to reduce your stress before and while you drive?\n\nThese questions may be on the test. If you cannot answer them all, reread Subsections 2.9 and 2.10.\n\n2.11 – Driving at Night\n\n2.11.1 – It Is More Dangerous\n\nYou are at greater risk when you drive at night. Drivers cannot see hazards as quickly as in daylight, so they have less time to respond. Drivers caught by surprise are less able to avoid an accident. The problems of night driving involve the driver, roadway, and vehicle.\n\n2.11.2 – Driver Factors\n\nVision. Good vision is critical for safe driving. Your control of the brake, accelerator, and steering wheel is based on what you see. If you cannot see clearly, you will have trouble identifying traffic and roadway conditions, spotting potential trouble or responding to problems in a timely manner.\n\nBecause seeing well is so critical to safe driving, you should have your eyes checked regularly by an eye specialist. You may never know you have poor vision unless your eyes are tested. If you need to wear glasses or contact lenses for driving, remember to:\n\nAlways wear them when driving, even if driving short distances. If your DL has a corrective lenses restriction, it is illegal to move a vehicle without using corrective lenses.\n\nKeep an extra set of corrective lenses in your vehicle. If your normal corrective lenses are broken or lost, you can use the spare lenses to drive safely.\n\nAvoid using dark or tinted corrective lenses at night, even if you think they help with glare. Tinted lenses cut down the light that you need to see clearly under night driving conditions.\n\nGlare. Drivers can be blinded for a short time by bright light. It can take several seconds to recover from glare. Even 2 seconds of glare blindness can be dangerous. A vehicle going 55 mph will travel more than half the distance of an American football field during that time.\n\nFatigue and Lack of Alertness. Fatigue is physical or mental tiredness that can be caused by physical or mental strain, repetitive tasks, illness, or lack of sleep. Just like alcohol and drugs, it impairs your vision and judgment.\n\nFatigue causes errors related to speed and distance, increases your risk of being in an accident, causes you to not see and react to hazards as quickly, and affects your ability to make critical decisions. When you are fatigued, you could fall asleep behind the wheel and crash, injuring or killing yourself or others.\n\nFatigued or drowsy driving is one of the leading causes of traffic accidents. NHTSA estimates that 100,000 police-reported accidents a year are the result of drowsy driving. According to the National Sleep Foundation’s Sleep in America Poll, 60 percent of Americans have driven while feeling sleepy and more than 1/3 (36 percent or 103 million people) admit to having actually fallen asleep at the wheel. Drivers may experience short bursts of sleep lasting only a few seconds or fall asleep for longer periods of time. Either way, the chance of an accident increases dramatically.\n\nAt-Risk Groups\n\nThe risk of having an accident due to drowsy driving is not uniformly distributed across the population. Accidents tend to occur at times when sleepiness is most pronounced, for example, during the night and in the mid-afternoon. Most people are less alert at night, especially after midnight. This is particularly true if you have been driving for a long time. Thus, individuals who drive at night are more likely to have fall-asleep accidents.\n\nResearch has identified young males, shift workers, commercial drivers, especially long-haul drivers, and people with untreated sleep disorders or with short-term or chronic sleep deprivation as being at increased risk for having a fall-asleep accident. At least 15 percent of all heavy truck accidents involve fatigue.\n\nA congressionally mandated-study of 80 long-haul truck drivers in the U.S. and Canada found drivers averaged less than 5 hours of sleep per day (FMLSA, 1996). It is no surprise that the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that drowsy driving was probably the cause of more than half of accidents leading to a truck driver’s death (NTSB, 1990). For each truck driver fatality, another 3 to 4 people are killed (NHTSA, 1994).\n\nWarning Signs of Fatigue\n\nMany people cannot tell if or when they are about to fall asleep. Here are some signs that should tell you to stop and rest:\n\nDifficulty focusing, frequent blinking, or heavy eyelids.\n\nYawning repeatedly or rubbing eyes.\n\nDaydreaming and wandering/disconnected thoughts.\n\nTrouble remembering the last few miles driven and missing exits or traffic signs.\n\nTrouble keeping head up.\n\nDrifting from your lane, following too closely, or hitting a shoulder rumble strip.\n\nFeeling restless and irritable.\n\nWhen you are tired, trying to “push on” is far more dangerous than most drivers think. It is a major cause of fatal accidents. If you notice any signs of fatigue, stop driving and go to sleep for the night or take a 15–20 minute nap.\n\nAre You at Risk?\n\nBefore you drive, consider whether you are:\n\nSleep-deprived or fatigued (6 hours of sleep or less triples your risk).\n\nSuffering from sleep loss (insomnia), poor quality sleep, or a sleep deprivation.\n\nDriving long distances without proper rest breaks.\n\nDriving through the night, mid-afternoon, or when you would normally be asleep. Many heavy motor vehicle accidents occur between midnight and 6 a.m.\n\nTaking sedating medications (antidepressants, cold tablets, antihistamines).\n\nWorking more than 60 hours a week (increases your risk by 40 percent).\n\nWorking more than one job and your main job involves shift work.\n\nDriving alone or on a long, rural, dark, or boring road.\n\nFlying and changing time zone.\n\nPreventing Drowsiness Before a Trip:\n\nGet adequate sleep – adults need 8-9 hours to maintain alertness.\n\nPrepare route carefully to identify total distance, stopping points, and other logistic considerations.\n\nSchedule trips for the hours you are normally awake, not the middle of the night.\n\nDrive with a passenger.\n\nAvoid medications that cause drowsiness.\n\nConsult your physician if you suffer from daytime sleepiness, have difficulty sleeping at night, or take frequent naps.\n\nIncorporate exercise into your daily life to give you more energy.\n\nMaintaining Alertness While Driving:\n\nProtect yourself from glare and eyestrain with sunglasses.\n\nKeep cool by opening the window or using the air conditioner.\n\nAvoid heavy foods.\n\nBe aware of down time during the day.\n\nHave another person ride with you, and take turns driving.\n\nTake periodic breaks – about every 100 miles or 2 hours during long trips.\n\nStop driving and rest or take a nap.\n\nCaffeine consumption can increase awareness for a few hours, but do not drink too much. It will eventually wear off. Do not rely on caffeine to prevent fatigue.\n\nAvoid drugs. While they may keep you awake for a while, they will not make you alert.\n\nIf you are drowsy, the only safe cure is to get off the road and sleep. If you do not, you risk your life and the lives of others.\n\n2.11.3 – Roadway Factors\n\nPoor Lighting. In the daytime there is usually enough light to see well. This is not true at night. Some areas may have bright street lights, but many areas will have poor lighting. On most roads you will probably have to depend entirely on your headlights.\n\nLess light means you will not be able to see hazards as well as in daytime. Road users who do not have lights are hard to see. There are many accidents at night involving pedestrians, joggers, bicyclists, and animals.\n\nEven when there are lights, the road scene can be confusing. Traffic signals and hazards can be hard to see against a background of signs, shop windows, and other lights.\n\nDrive slower when lighting is poor or confusing.\n\nDrive slowly enough to be sure you can stop in the distance you can see ahead.\n\nDrunk Drivers. Drunk drivers and drivers under the influence of drugs are a hazard to themselves and to you. Be especially alert around the closing times of bars and taverns. Watch for drivers who have trouble staying in their lane, or maintaining speed, stop without reason, or show other signs of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n\n2.11.4 – Vehicle Factors\n\nHeadlights. At night, your headlights will usually be the main source of light for you to see by and for others to see you. You cannot see nearly as much with your headlights as you see in the daytime. With low beams you can see ahead about 250 feet and with high beams about 350-500 feet. You must adjust your speed to keep your stopping distance within your sight distance. This means going slowly enough to be able to stop within the range of your headlights. Otherwise, by the time you see a hazard; you will not have time to stop.\n\nNight driving can be more dangerous if you have problems with your headlights. Dirty headlights may give only half the light they should. This cuts down your ability to see, and makes it harder for others to see you. Make sure your lights are clean and working. Headlights can be out of adjustment. If they do not point in the right direction, they will not give you a good view and can blind other drivers. Have a qualified person make sure they are adjusted properly.\n\nYou must turn on your headlights:\n\nA half hour after sunset to a half hour before sunrise.\n\nIf snow, rain, fog, or other hazardous weather condition require the use of windshield wipers.\n\nWhen visibility is not sufficient to clearly see a person or a vehicle for a distance of 1,000 feet (CVC §§280 and 24400).\n\nNo vehicle may be driven with only parking lights on. However, they may be used as signals or when the headlamps are also lighted (CVC §24800).\n\nOther Lights. In order for you to be seen easily, the following must be clean and working properly:\n\nReflectors\n\nMarker lights\n\nClearance lights\n\nTaillights\n\nIdentification lights\n\nTurn Signals and Brake Lights. At night your turn signals and brake lights are even more important for telling other drivers what you intend to do. Make sure you have clean, working turn signals and brake lights.\n\nWindshield and Mirrors. It is more important at night than in the daytime to have a clean windshield and clean mirrors. Bright lights at night can cause dirt on your windshield or mirrors to create a glare of its own, blocking your view. Most people have experienced driving toward the sun just as it has risen or is about to set, and found that they can barely see through a windshield that seemed to look okay in the middle of the day. Clean your windshield on the inside and outside for safe driving at night.\n\n2.11.5 – Night Driving Procedures\n\nVehicle Procedures. Make sure you are rested and alert. If you are drowsy, sleep before you drive! Even a nap can save your life or the lives of others. If you wear eyeglasses, make sure they are clean and unscratched. Do not wear sunglasses at night. Do a complete vehicle inspection. Pay attention to checking all lights and reflectors, and cleaning those you can reach.\n\nAvoid Blinding Others. Glare from your headlights can cause problems for drivers coming toward you. They can also bother drivers going in the same direction you are, when your lights shine in their rearview mirrors. Dim your lights before they cause glare for other drivers. Dim your lights within 500 feet of an oncoming vehicle and when following another vehicle within 500 feet.\n\nAvoid Glare From Oncoming Vehicles. Do not look directly at lights of oncoming vehicles. Look slightly to the right at a right lane or edge marking, if available. If other drivers do not put their low beams on, do not try to “get back at them” by putting your own high beams on. This increases glare for oncoming drivers and increases the chance of an accident.\n\nUse High Beams When you Can. Some drivers make the mistake of always using low beams. This seriously cuts down on their ability to see ahead. Use high beams when it is safe and legal to do so. Use them when you are not within 500 feet of an approaching vehicle. Also, do not let the inside of your cab get too bright. This makes it harder to see outside. Keep the interior light off, and adjust your instrument lights as low as you can to still be able to read the gauges.\n\nIf You Get Sleepy, Stop at the Nearest Safe Place. People often do not realize how close they are to falling asleep even when their eyelids are falling shut. If you can safely do so, look at yourself in a mirror. If you look sleepy, or just feel sleepy, stop driving! You are in a very dangerous condition. The only safe cure is to sleep.\n\n2.12 – Driving in Fog\n\nFog can occur at any time. Fog on highways can be extremely dangerous. Fog is often unexpected, and visibility can deteriorate rapidly. You should watch for foggy conditions and be ready to reduce your speed. Do not assume the fog will thin out after you enter it.\n\nThe best advice for driving in fog is do not. It is preferable that you pull off the road into a rest area or truck stop until visibility is better. If you must drive, be sure to consider the following:\n\nObey all fog-related warning signs.\n\nSlow down before you enter fog.\n\nUse low-beam headlights and fog lights for best visibility even in daytime, and be alert for other drivers who may have forgotten t"
