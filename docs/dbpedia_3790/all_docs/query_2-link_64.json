        "text": "Key Takeaways\n\nOlder adults with hearing loss can drive safely by taking proactive measures and being mindful of potential challenges.\n\nRegular hearing and vision assessments, along with proper use of hearing aids or assistive devices, are helpful for optimal driving abilities.\n\nVehicle modifications and using assistive technologies can enhance driving comfort and safety.\n\nPlanning drives to avoid rush hour traffic and inclement weather and staying alert are fundamental for a confident driving experience.\n\nDriving, a symbol of freedom and independence, is a skill many cherish. But as we age, it becomes crucial to address potential safety challenges. Older adults may experience changes in vision, hearing, reaction time, cognitive function, mobility, or medication which can all impact the ability to drive safely. In this comprehensive guide, we shed light on an often-overlooked aspect of safe driving: hearing loss.\n\nIt’s expected one of every four licensed drivers will be an older adult by 2050. A study found people with moderate to severe hearing impairment had poorer driving performance in the presence of distractions than those with normal to mild hearing loss. But research is limited, and there are resources available and modifications you can make to ensure you’re driving safely even with hearing loss.\n\nThis guide explores the challenges of driving with age-related hearing loss, its impact on driver safety, and, most importantly, the knowledge and resources needed to confidently continue your journey on the open road. Remember, the key to a fulfilling life on wheels lies not only in recognizing challenges but also in taking the necessary steps to overcome them.\n\nCan I drive safely with hearing loss?\n\nMany people who are hard of hearing can still drive safely, and there are no laws against driving with hearing loss or full hearing impairment.\n\nThe prevalence of hearing loss among older adults\n\nHearing loss is a common issue as we age, affecting approximately one in three people 65 and older in the United States alone. While the natural aging process is a significant cause, other factors, such as exposure to loud noises, genetics, and certain chronic diseases, can contribute to hearing loss as well. And not all drivers with hearing loss are aware their hearing ability has declined.\n\nIs driving with hearing loss safe?\n\nYes, driving with hearing loss is generally considered manageable, though some states may require certain conditions to be met, including:\n\nAbility to hear essential sounds, such as sirens, horns, and other vehicles: For reference, ambulance sirens are about 120 decibels, while profound hearing loss is 90 decibels and higher. No specific hearing level requirements are set for drivers of private vehicles, but the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) requires drivers to hear a forced whisper from 5 feet away in order to obtain a commercial driver’s license (CDL). In 2013, the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) challenged this requirement and successfully gained exemptions for deaf or hearing-impaired drivers with safe driving records to obtain a CDL. While the hearing exemption can be waived in these circumstances, NAD continues to work toward removing the hearing standard in full.\n\nClearance from a health care professional: Anyone experiencing hearing loss should undergo evaluation and advice from an audiologist or ENT doctor. Again, while there is no standard required level of hearing set for private drivers, 40 decibels seems to be the cutoff for commercial drivers (unless exempted from the standard). Those with hearing loss at higher than 40 decibels are not prohibited from driving commercially but need an evaluation and approval from a doctor basing their decision on medical history, driving history, the type of driving, functional design of the driving cab, and any other medical challenges the driver may have.\n\nRachel Magan Faivre, AuD, owner of Oklahoma City-based Ash Audiology, added: “Another concern is people who have a dead ear, or no usable hearing in one ear. Even if the other ear has normal hearing, if one ear doesn’t work, then you lose the ability to localize sounds, which becomes important when locating sirens, horns, or a person or animal calling out.”\n\nIt’s important to note driving while deaf is legal in all 50 states, though some states may enforce some requirements, including requiring deaf and hard of hearing people to inform their local motor vehicles department of their impairment, have full-view mirrors in and outside their cars, take driving lessons after obtaining their permit, and wear hearing aids.\n\nSue Keiss, 59, of Denver, Colorado, has moderate hearing loss in both ears due to chemotherapy medications. She feels her hearing aids make her a perfectly safe driver. “I always wear my hearing aids when driving and have not had any issues. I can hear horns and sirens,” she said. “My doctors have not mentioned or asked me about driving.”\n\nThe NHTSA assessment:\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) offers an online self-assessment tool to evaluate a person’s fitness to drive safely. This comprehensive evaluation covers hearing and vision capabilities, physical fitness, and reaction time. Taking this assessment can provide valuable insights into your driving abilities and potential areas for improvement.\n\nHow age impacts driving ability\n\nWhile driving is a skill honed over years of experience, it’s essential to be aware of the various factors associated with aging influencing our capabilities on the road, including:\n\nVision changes: Aging can lead to changes in vision, such as decreased visual acuity, sensitivity to glare, and reduced peripheral vision. Difficulties detecting road signs, recognizing pedestrians, or seeing objects in low-light conditions can pose challenges while driving. Night vision declines with age, making driving at night more challenging for older adults.\n\nReaction time: As we age, our reflexes may slow down, affecting our ability to respond quickly to unexpected situations on the road. This slower reaction time can increase the risk of accidents, especially in high-traffic or complex driving scenarios.\n\nCognitive function: Aging can also affect cognitive abilities, including memory, attention, and decision-making, making it important to minimize distractions while behind the wheel.\n\nMobility and flexibility: Physical changes, such as reduced muscle strength and flexibility, can impact our ability to control a vehicle effectively. Turning the steering wheel, pressing pedals, or looking over your shoulder when changing lanes may become more challenging.\n\nMedications and health conditions: Certain health conditions become more prevalent with age, and the medications used to manage them can have side effects affecting driving ability. For example, drowsiness, dizziness, or impaired coordination can compromise road safety.\n\nThe importance of adaptive strategies:\n\nDespite these age-related changes, it’s important to emphasize many older adults can continue driving safely by employing adaptive strategies. Regular health check-ups, vision tests, and hearing assessments are essential. Furthermore, staying physically and mentally active and attending defensive driving courses can help compensate for many age-related challenges.\n\nHow to drive safely with hearing loss\n\nAs we prioritize safety on the road, especially for older adults with hearing loss, taking proactive steps can significantly enhance driving abilities and confidence. Let’s explore a checklist of essential actions to ensure safe driving with hearing loss.\n\nTalk to your doctor\n\nHave an open conversation with your doctor about your hearing level and any concerns you may have regarding your ability to drive safely. Maintain regular check-ups at the recommended intervals to monitor your overall health and fitness for driving.\n\nCheck your eyes and ears\n\nAll drivers should be mindful of their vision and hearing health. Some strategies to increase your driving safety include:\n\nEnsure your prescription glasses or contacts are up-to-date to optimize your vision while driving.\n\nIf you have hearing aids, regularly inspect and maintain them to ensure the batteries are fresh and the volume is adjusted appropriately. If you don’t have hearing aids yet, there are lots of affordable hearing aids and over the counter hearing aids on the market.\n\nIf advised by your doctor, consider obtaining a personal sound amplifier (PSAP) to enhance your auditory perception. Note: PSAPs should not be used to treat hearing loss, but they can help amplify sounds and are often used in this way recreationally.\n\nReview your medications\n\nSchedule periodic medication reviews with your doctor to assess for any interactions or side effects with the potential to affect your driving abilities, such as drowsiness or heightened anxiety.\n\nOptimize your vehicle for your eyesight\n\nSight is the most important sense for driving. You can optimize your vision by following these tips:\n\nAdjust your vehicle’s mirrors to provide an optimal field of view, reducing blind spots.\n\nInstall wide-angle or blind-spot mirrors to enhance visibility.\n\nKeep your windshield and windows clean to minimize glare and improve vision.\n\nChoose vehicles with advanced safety features, such as lane departure warning systems or rearview cameras.\n\nUse window visors and wear sunglasses on bright sunny days.\n\nControl noise and distractions\n\nReducing distractions is a key to safe driving at any age. Ways to reduce excess noise and distractions include:\n\nReduce noise inside the car to enhance your ability to hear important auditory cues while driving.\n\nKeep conversations at a comfortable volume and limit excessive noise from radios or devices like smartphones.\n\nMinimize distractions by avoiding using mobile phones or other electronic devices while driving.\n\nPlan for hearing fatigue\n\nRecognize hearing loss can be mentally fatiguing, requiring extra energy to pay attention to signals and surroundings. You can help manage hearing fatigue by:\n\nPlanning scheduled stops on longer drives to rest and recharge during extended journeys.\n\nSetting a maximum trip drive time to avoid driving when fatigue will likely impact your abilities.\n\nOpting for driving at times of the day when you feel most alert and energetic and/or will experience less traffic that can contribute to hearing and general fatigue.\n\nTake a safe driving course\n\nEnroll in a driving safety course designed for older adults to refresh your driving skills and learn valuable strategies for safe driving. AAA offers a RoadWise Driver course for older adults, which covers driving techniques and the latest technologies. The National Safety Council offers an Online Mature Defensive Driving Course. Individual states also often offer driver safety courses for older adults. Course fees may depend on your location, and completing the course usually leads to discounts on insurance premiums.\n\nGo to a CarFit event\n\nCarFit events are specifically designed to help older drivers achieve a better fit with their vehicles for increased comfort and safety. Trained technicians will check the vehicle settings and provide recommendations for adjustments to accommodate individual needs.\n\nCar modifications for easier driving\n\nThese car modifications and technologies can be valuable tools for older adult drivers to enhance their driving experience and overall safety on the road:\n\nHand controls: Install hand controls, so drivers can operate the brake and accelerator pedals using hand movements, which can be beneficial for those with limited leg mobility or strength.\n\nSteering wheel spinner knob: Attach a spinner knob to the steering wheel to provide better grip and control, reducing the effort required to steer the vehicle.\n\nSwivel seat: Incorporate a swivel seat to make it easier for drivers with mobility challenges to enter and exit the vehicle.\n\nExtended mirrors: Install extended mirrors, such as panoramic or blind-spot mirrors, to enhance visibility and reduce blind spots, especially for those with limited neck mobility.\n\nPedal extensions: Add pedal extensions to adjust the position of the pedals, ensuring a more comfortable and ergonomically suitable driving position.\n\nAuto-dimming rearview mirror: Replace the traditional rearview mirror with an auto-dimming one to reduce glare from headlights, enhancing night driving safety.\n\nAssistive parking devices: Install parking sensors or a backup camera to aid drivers in maneuvering their vehicles during parking, providing additional assistance and confidence.\n\nSome programs may help pay the costs of vehicle modifications. For information, contact your state’s department of vocational rehabilitation or another agency providing vocational services and, if appropriate, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Some technologies to consider are:\n\nCollision avoidance systems: Advanced driver-assistance systems, such as collision warning and automatic emergency braking, can help prevent accidents by alerting the driver and even applying the brakes in critical situations.\n\nLane departure warning system: This technology alerts drivers when they unintentionally drift out of their lane, reducing the risk of lane departure-related accidents.\n\nVoice-activated controls: Voice-activated features allow drivers to perform various tasks, such as adjusting climate control or navigation, without taking their hands off the wheel.\n\nAdaptive cruise control: Adaptive cruise control adjusts the vehicle’s speed based on the traffic flow, maintaining a safe following distance and reducing the need for constant acceleration and braking.\n\nGPS navigation systems: GPS navigation systems provide clear and audible turn-by-turn directions, assisting drivers in finding the best routes and destinations.\n\nBlind spot monitoring: Blind spot monitoring systems use sensors to detect vehicles in the driver’s blind spots, alerting them through visual or audible signals to avoid potential collisions.\n\nGesture control interfaces: Emerging technologies may offer gesture control interfaces and allow drivers to interact with in-car systems through simple hand movements, reducing the need for complex button presses.\n\nSafe driving tips for older adults\n\nIn addition to using technology, many common-sense defensive driving strategies can increase road safety for people of all ages:\n\nTime your driving wisely: Whenever possible, plan your trips during off-peak hours to avoid heavy rush hour traffic. Reduced traffic can make driving less stressful and minimize the likelihood of aggressive driving encounters.\n\nAvoid inclement weather: Poor weather conditions, such as heavy rain, snow, or fog, can significantly impact driving safety. If bad weather is forecasted, consider postponing your trip until conditions improve.\n\nResearch your route: Before setting out on a journey, familiarize yourself with the route and potential road hazards. Use GPS navigation systems to receive real-time traffic updates and alternative route suggestions.\n\nMaintain a safe following distance: Allow for ample space between your vehicle and the one in front of you. A greater following distance provides more time to react to sudden stops or emergencies.\n\nObserve speed limits: Adhere to posted speed limits, especially in unfamiliar areas. Driving at an appropriate speed allows for better control and reaction time, reducing the risk of accidents.\n\nStay focused and alert: Minimize distractions inside the car and keep your focus on the road ahead. Avoid using mobile phones or other electronic devices while driving. Keep hydrated and well-rested before embarking on a journey. On longer trips, schedule breaks to rest and stretch your legs.\n\nUse turn signals: Signal your intentions clearly and in advance when changing lanes or making turns. This helps other drivers anticipate your movements, promoting smoother traffic flow.\n\nBe cautious at intersections: Approach intersections cautiously, even if you have the right of way. Look for potential hazards, such as vehicles running red lights, to avoid collisions.\n\nAdjust to changing light conditions: Be prepared for changing light conditions, such as transitioning from daylight to dusk or night driving. Keep your headlights on when visibility is reduced.\n\nBe patient and tolerant: Stay patient and avoid aggressive driving behaviors. Remain courteous to other road users, and avoid confrontations with aggressive drivers.\n\nChad Shepperd, associate director of operations and training at Drive Safe Colorado, told us, “Anyone driving with hearing loss will need to rely more on their vision. It’s important that they limit visual distractions, increase visual scanning at intersections (even at green lights), and check mirrors more frequently.”\n\nOlder adult licensing by state\n\nRules regarding renewing driver’s licenses vary by state. You may visit your particular state’s Department of Motor Vehicles website or NOLO’s Driving Laws for Seniors and Older Drivers page for details.\n\nWhile most states require a vision test past a certain age, typically 65 but sometimes younger or older, written and road tests usually are only required if specific impairments are documented. Below is a general overview of the requirements.\n\nFor a full summary of the key features of each state’s rules, download this Older Adult Licensing by State Packet.\n\nUnable to display PDF file.\n\nBottom line\n\nRecognizing how hearing loss can impact driving abilities, you can take proactive measures to ensure safety on the road. From regular assessments of hearing and vision to embracing modern technologies and adapting driving habits, older drivers can continue to navigate our roads with confidence and enjoyment. Remember, the goal is not to discourage or limit your freedom, but to ensure the safety of yourself and others on the road. By honestly evaluating your hearing abilities and taking necessary precautions, you can continue to enjoy the open road with confidence and peace of mind.\n\nHave questions about this article?
