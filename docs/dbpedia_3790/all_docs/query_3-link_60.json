        "text": "This sections describes how to monitor traffic or system counters.\n\nTraffic or System Counters Solution\n\nSmartView Monitor provides tools that enable you to monitor traffic related to specified network activities, and server, as well as the status of activities, hardware and software use of different Check Point products in real-time. With this knowledge you can:\n\nBlock specified traffic.\n\nControl traffic flow on a .\n\nSee how many tunnels are currently open, or the rate of new connections that pass through the VPN Gateway.\n\nSmartView Monitor delivers a comprehensive solution to monitor and analyze network traffic and network usage. You can generate fully detailed or summarized graphs and charts for all connections intercepted and logged when you monitor traffic, and for numerous rates and figures when you count usage throughout the network.\n\nTraffic\n\nTraffic Monitoring provides in-depth details on network traffic and activity. As a network administrator you can generate traffic information to:\n\nAnalyze network traffic pattern\n\nNetwork traffic patterns help administrators determine which services demand the most network resources.\n\nAudit and estimate costs of network us\n\nMonitoring traffic can provide information on how the use of network resources is divided among corporate users and departments. Reports that summarize customer use of services, bandwidth and time can provide a basis to estimate costs for each user or department.\n\nIdentify the departments and users that generate the most traffic and the times of peak activity.\n\nDetect and monitor suspicious activity. Network administrators can produce graphs and charts that document blocked traffic, alerts, rejected connections, or failed authentication attempts to identify possible intrusion attempts.\n\nA Traffic view can be created to monitor the Traffic types listed in the following table.\n\nTraffic Type\n\nExplanation\n\nTraffic Legend Output\n\nThe values that you see in the legend depend on the Traffic view that you run.\n\nAll units in the view results show in configurable Intervals.\n\nSystem Counters\n\nMonitoring System Counters provides in-depth details about Check Point usage and activities. As a network administrator, you can generate system status information about:\n\nResource usage for the variety of components associated with the Security Gateway. For example, the average use of real physical memory, the average percent of CPU time used by user applications, free disk space, and so on.\n\nSecurity Gateway performance statistics for a variety of Firewall components. For example, the average number of concurrent CVP sessions handled by the HTTP security server, the number of concurrent IKE negotiations, the number of new sessions handled by the SMTP security server, and so on.\n\nDetect and monitor suspicious activity. Network administrators can produce graphs and charts that document the number of alerts, rejected connections, or failed authentication attempts to identify possible intrusion attempts.\n\nSelect and Run a Traffic or System Counters View\n\nWhen a Traffic or System Counters view runs, the results show in the SmartView Monitor client. A Traffic or System Counter view can run:\n\nFrom an existing view\n\nWhen you create a new view\n\nWhen you change an existing view\n\nTo run a Traffic or System Counters view:\n\nIn the SmartView Monitor client, select the Traffic or System Counter branch in the Tree View.\n\nDouble-click the Traffic or System Counter view that you want to run.\n\nA list of available Security Gateways shows.\n\nSelect the Security Gateway, for which you want to run the selected Traffic or System Counter view.\n\nClick OK.\n\nThe results of the selected view show in the SmartView Monitor client.\n\nRecording a Traffic or Counter View\n\nYou can save a record of the Traffic or System Counter view results.\n\nTo record a traffic or counter view:\n\nRun the Traffic or System Counters view.\n\nSelect the Traffic menu.\n\nSelect Recording > Record.\n\nA Save As window shows.\n\nName the record.\n\nSave it in the related directory.\n\nClick Save.\n\nThe word Recording shows below the Traffic or Counter toolbar. The appearance of this word signifies that the view currently running is recorded and saved.\n\nTo stop recording, open the Traffic menu and select Recording > Stop.\n\nA record of the view results is saved in the directory you selected in step 3 above.\n\nPlay the Results of a Recorded Traffic or Counter View\n\nAfter you record a view, you can play it back. You can select Play or Fast Play, to see results change faster.\n\nTo play the results:\n\nIn the SmartView Monitor client, select Traffic > Recording > Play.\n\nThe Select Recorded File window shows.\n\nAccess the directory in which the recorded file is kept and select the related record.\n\nClick Open.\n\nThe results of the selected recorded view start to run. The word Playing shows below the toolbar.\n\nPause or Stop the Results of a Recorded View that is Playing"
