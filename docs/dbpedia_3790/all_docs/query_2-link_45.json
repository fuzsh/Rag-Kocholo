        "text": "You must immediately notify police if you are a driver involved in an accident meeting any of the same criteria required under DMV Accident Reporting Requirements (see above).\n\nUse a non-emergency police phone number.\n\nIf you have a traffic accident, you must:\n\nStop at Once\n\nStop at the accident scene or as close as possible without blocking or endangering other traffic.\n\nFollowing a traffic accident, you must carry out duties of a driver.\n\nBelow are links to Oregon law that outline legal duties.\n\nORS 811.700 outlines duties of a driver when property is damaged; and\n\nORS 811.705​ outlines duties of a driver to injured persons.​\n\nRender Aid\n\nGive aid to injured people. Remember, injured people should never be moved carelessly. In many cases, they should not be moved at all except by emergency staff or someone trained in first aid. If someone is killed or unconscious, the driver must remain at the scene until a police officer arrives.\n\nExchange Information (printable checklist to keep in your car)\n\nGive the other driver, passengers in the vehicle, or any injured pedestrian your:\n\nName;\n\nAddress;\n\nDriver license number;\n\nLicense plate number; and\n\nYour insurance information.\n\nReport the Accident to DMV (instructions above)\n\n​If you hit an unoccupied vehicle, try to find the owner. If you can't find the owner, leave a note that says you are the person who hit the vehicle and how to contact you. By law, ORS 811.700(1)(B), you must write your name and address on the note, and a brief description of what happened.\n\nIf you damage property other than a vehicle, you also must try to find the owner or someone in charge of the property to report the damage.\n\nIf you have a crash on the highway and you have no injury, you should move your vehicle over to the shoulder if it’s safe to do so. This helps keep traffic moving. You will also avoid getting a ticket for failure to remove your vehicle."
