        "text": "What are the top five dangers of self-driving cars?\n\nSelf-driving cars will change how we educate drivers and reduce human interaction while driving. This poses several risks because drivers may not develop or retain the driving skills needed to deal with significant changes in road conditions. If the self-driving system breaks down, some drivers will be stranded because they cannot safely operate the car. Reducing human involvement when driving is an effective way to prevent accidents. Still, extreme weather, traffic jams, debris on roadways, and other factors could prevent self-driving cars from operating correctly. These are just a few of the dangers.\n\nLearning about the top five dangers of using self-driving cars will help you understand the risks of autonomous vehicles.\n\nVehicle crashes: Automated systems can malfunction\n\nThe automated systems should provide ample warning about speed limit changes, stop signs, and other changes in road conditions. However, if the automated systems malfunction, they may not recognize road signs or alert you if you’re drifting from your lane. Relying on these systems can cause an accident if you don’t notice a problem until it’s too late.\n\nPedestrian accidents: Automated systems don’t respond to people or animals\n\nProgramming a computer system to recognize a speed limit sign and adjust the vehicle speed is straightforward. Programming a vehicle to recognize people or animals on or near a roadway, anticipate their subsequent actions, and take appropriate measures to avoid hitting them is far more complex. Current automated driving systems can’t anticipate what pedestrians or animals will do; therefore, drivers can’t rely on these systems to take steps to avoid hitting pedestrians or animals.\n\nSelf-driving cars are fire hazards\n\nThe lithium-ion batteries used in self-driving vehicles pose a fire hazard if they overheat. Lithium-ion batteries may explode if they catch fire, and the fire can spread to other vehicle systems. You can’t put out a lithium-ion battery fire with water or a fire extinguisher, which makes it challenging to contain these fires.\n\nHacking\n\nSelf-driving cars rely on computer systems to function. Hackers can bypass firewalls and access these systems, overriding your controls and redirecting your vehicle. Criminals could use self-driving cars to cause accidents and gridlock. Hackers can also access systems to access your data, increasing the risk of identity theft.\n\nHealth risks\n\nMultiple systems in self-driving cars — including GPS navigation and tracking systems, Bluetooth, and radio systems — release radiation. Even short-term exposure or exposure to small doses of radiation can cause headaches, migraines, insomnia, respiratory problems, and high blood pressure. Long-term radiation exposure or exposure to large amounts of radiation can cause severe health issues such as cancer. Long-term or large-dose exposure can also be fatal.\n\nAre there actual self-driving cars?\n\nNo fully automated self-driving cars exist yet; however, car manufacturers continue to expand self-driving vehicles’ capabilities in the marketplace. Vehicles receive a ranking that indicates their level of automation. A car with cruise control, for example, is a Level 1 autonomous vehicle. Level 2 autonomous vehicles are programmed to control at least two functions. Levels 3 and 4 continue to expand the vehicle’s autonomous capabilities. Level 5 is reserved for any fully autonomous vehicles produced in the future.\n\nAre self-driving cars legal yet?\n\nLaws can take time to catch up to technology. Currently, self-driving vehicle laws vary from state to state. Self-driving vehicles are legal in Nevada, but the laws in neighboring states vary. Autonomous vehicles are permitted in Utah and California, but drivers must receive authorization to use self-driving vehicles in Arizona. At this time, Oregon has no laws addressing the use of self-driving cars.\n\nWhat is the biggest problem with self-driving cars?\n\nAlthough the top five dangers of self-driving cars listed here address valid risks of using self-driving vehicles, these vehicles pose other problems that shouldn’t be overlooked.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles are expensive. Consumers could pay hundreds of thousands more for fully automated cars when they hit the market. Consequently, self-driving vehicles will be luxury vehicles only wealthy consumers can afford. Since different laws govern self-driving vehicles in many states, introducing fully autonomous vehicles to roadways will change driving laws and could affect legal claims from self-driving vehicle accidents.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles may also damage the environment. The computer systems these cars rely on produce toxic waste, and self-driving vehicles will increase the volume of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change.\n\nWhat could go wrong with self-driving cars?\n\nMany things can go wrong with autonomous vehicles. As noted, the computer systems may not recognize pedestrians, animals, debris, or other objects near or on roadways. It’s nearly impossible for self-driving vehicles to anticipate what a person or animal will do and take preventative measures to avoid an accident. Self-driving cars may also strike objects, such as lane dividers, causing accidents.\n\nAlthough it may sound like something from a science fiction movie, hackers could gain control of self-driving vehicles to commit illegal acts, putting autonomous vehicle operators at risk of criminal charges.\n\nHow a car accident attorney can help with a self-driving car accident\n\nTurning to the best trucking accident lawyer in your city or state is the most effective way to get legal guidance after a truck accident. The best accident lawyer can also help with your self-driving vehicle accident.\n\nAt Adam S. Kutner, Injury Attorneys, we understand any accident can be overwhelming. Self-driving vehicles complicate matters because you may not understand how self-driving vehicle laws affect your legal claim.\n\nWe’ll investigate your accident to determine who was at fault. You may have a claim against the vehicle’s operator, manufacturer, or both. We’ll gather the evidence to support your case and negotiate with the at-fault parties for a fair settlement. You shouldn’t have to pay costly medical bills or absorb financial losses if you’re unable to work because of a self-driving vehicle accident. That’s why we’ll help you calculate the total damages you deserve and fight to get you every penny while you recover from your accident."
