At the same time, illegal trade – one of the most profitable criminal activities worldwide – fuels environmental degradation and economic losses.\n\nTRAFFIC is driving action to reduce illegal trafficking and enhance benefits to people from legal and sustainable trade of wild species. As a global trusted advisor, we generate evidence, analysis, and solutions to strengthen global and national policy frameworks, and build responsible and fair supply chains."
