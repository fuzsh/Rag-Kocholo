        "text": "District 1\n\nRenova 4000\n\nWarren County identified an opportunity to improve repairs due to potholes, which typically involved cold-patching during the winter season as a temporary solution, by employing the Renova 4000 asphalt recycler, an American-made, heavy-duty mobile asphalt pavement recycler that converts asphalt pavement as large chunks or ground millings into asphalt plant-quality hot mix with high-level elasticity, resilience, adhesion, and compactability. Warren County repairs around 150-200 potholes per day, including rework from cold patching dislodge from daily traffic, plowing, and freeze-thaw cycles, which causes lost production on other important roadway projects. Repairs made using the Renova 4000 typically do not require rework as with typical cold patching. This equipment can produce at least 8 tons of material in a 7.5-hour shift with a cycle time of 75 minutes from startup to completion. Annual savings are estimated to be $150,000 in material costs and over 2,800 man-hours (roughly $1.2M) with a production increase of 167% for pothole repair, versus about $300,000 for typical cold patching. District 1 was awarded $16,000 from the Productivity Improvement Fund (PIF) to fund renting the Renova 4000 for use in Warren and Forest counties.\n\nBayfront Updates with Renderings\n\nThe Bayfront Parkway Central Corridor Project is designed to improve the pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and passenger vehicle connections between the Erie Central Business District and adjacent neighborhoods to the waterfront property north of the Bayfront Parkway, to reduce crashes on the parkway as much as practical, to decrease future congestion to an acceptable level of service or delay, and to increase traffic operations and efficiency. The design process has included several years of public outreach and continued partnership with area stakeholders. The selected alternatives for improvements along the Bayfront Parkway (Route 4034) includes dual-lane roundabouts at Sassafras Street Extension and Holland Street; grade separate intersection at State Street, including a traditional signalized at-grade intersection and a path for through traffic on the Bayfront to travel below the intersection; sidewalk and crosswalk upgrades throughout the length of the project; a multi-use trail connecting the existing trail network, downtown, and the waterfront; and overhead pedestrian bridges at each intersection. Ancillary projects near the work area will be completed in 2021 and 2022 with the Bayfront project itself expected to get underway in 2022.\n\nMerit Badge Program\n\nIn early 2020, an idea for a Boy Scouts of America (BSA) merit badge program was proposed to teach and garner interest in engineering and traffic safety topics. The program was initially pitched as a recruitment effort and formulated through the personal experiences of some of its originators who participated in similar scouting programs as Scouts or Boy Scout leadership. With the support of the District’s Executive Staff, several members of the district’s Civil Engineer Council volunteered to participate, some of whom had spent time in the Scouting program. With the transition to virtual group settings, the volunteer team adapted the program to a virtual setting while maintaining the necessary curriculum and quality of in-person activities.\n\nThe program involved PennDOT engineers explaining engineering concepts to the Scouts in an engaging and interactive virtual setting. Topics included, but were not limited to basic engineering fundamentals, various fields of engineering, developing processes, drawing and design, engineering ethics, roadway elements, driver and traffic safety factors and career opportunities. Two sessions were conducted in 2020 and were met with overwhelming interest and positive feedback from participants and volunteers, and future sessions are set to be planned for 2021.\n\nMultimodal Hub\n\nPennDOT, Venango County, and the Crawford Area Transportation Authority (CATA) collaborated on a project to build the Venango County Multimodal Transit Facility. The $10 million, 25,000-square-foot facility was constructed on the former PennDOT District 1 parking lot along Elm and Duncomb streets in Oil City. It features administrative offices and vehicle maintenance, storage and wash facilities for Venango County’s public transit system, as well as space for PennDOT’s fleet maintenance operations. Preliminary work on the project started in 2017 with the demolition of the closed Oil City parking garage. Construction on the building will be completed in spring 2021.\n\nWarren/Forest Counties Worked with Allegheny National Forest on Tree Trimming on SR 62\n\nThe collaborative effort between the Allegheny Forest Health Collaborative (AFHC) and PennDOT maintenance units in Warren and Forest counties improved the process for trimming trees along Route 62 to increase driver safety and pavement lifecycle.\n\nTraditional daylighting projects work within 25 feet of the roadway centerline. This project extended the daylighting to 40 feet and hazard tree removal to 100 feet from the centerline within Allegheny National Forest lands. Prior to the project, motorists were surrounded by a tunnel of trees, many of which were diseased and dying. Today, motorists can see the sunshine and beauty the river corridor offers.\n\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\nI-90 Updates with Bridges Replaced\n\nThe $66.1 million Interstate 90 project, which is considered phases 2 and 3 of a long-term reconstruction plan, includes the 6.85-mile section beginning near mile marker 3.5 and extending east to near mile marker 10.5, located in Springfield Township, Girard Township, and Platea Borough. Work will also include replacement or rehabilitation of five bridges and the construction of two teardrop roundabouts at the Route 18 interchange in Erie County. Work is expected to take three construction seasons to complete. Information on the project and other work scheduled along I-90 is available online at www.penndot.gov/I90Projects.\n\nRoute 8 Venango\n\nA $32.6 million project to repair and reconstruct nearly 10 miles of Route 8 from Georgetown Road (Route 3004) in Irwin Township to Polk Cutoff Road (Route 3024) in Sandycreek Township in Venango County is in its second year. The roadway is a major artery for drivers from Venango County wishing to access Interstate 80. The two-year project includes breaking the existing concrete to create a base for new asphalt pavement, paving, several bridge rehabilitations, drainage upgrades, guiderail replacements, and sign updates. Work in 2020 concentrated on the northbound lanes. The 2021 project schedule focuses on the southbound lanes.\n\nLeader in Pavement and Bridge Conditions\n\nDistrict 1 continues to provide a superior level of service to Northwestern Pennsylvania’s motoring public by maintaining paved surfaces and bridge structures to a higher standard. Nearly 70% of roads by segment mile are measured as ‘Excellent’ or ‘Good’ International Roughness Index (IRI) and Overall Pavement Index (OPI), with only about 10% measuring in the ‘Poor’ category.\n\nInternational Roughness Index (IRI)\n\nNetwork Excellent Good Fair Poor Interstate 86% 12% 1% 0% NHS Non-Interstate 37% 42% 14% 7% Non-NHS, ADT>=2000 64% 28% 5% 3% Non-NHS, ADT<2000 25% 28% 29% 18% Grand Total 39% 28% 20% 12%\n\nOverall Pavement Index (OPI)\n\nExcellent Good Fair Poor 47% 46% 7% 0% 11% 53% 18% 18% 30%\n\n38% 24% 7% 21%\n\n48% 23% 8% 24% 46% 21% 8%\n\nNearly 40% of all bridge structures in District 1 are rated ‘Good’ with less than 10% of bridges in each county, 6% districtwide, rated in ‘Poor’ condition.\n\nCounty Good Fair Poor Crawford 41% 51% 9% Erie 36% 59% 5% Forest 38% 58% 4% Mercer<2000 36% 58% 5% Venango 39% 55% 6% Warren 41% 52% 7% Grand Total 38% 55% 6%\n\nDistrict 2\n\nMaintenance\n\nImproved Brine Usage - Salt brine is an efficient and effective winter operations tool across District 2-0. Increasing salt brine usage has been one of our focus areas for several years. Our first step was to enhance education efforts with our operators and foreman. To further increase our success, we identified our brine needs by stockpile in each county so we could adjust our production and storage to meet that need.\n\nOver the past year, we have increased our District storage capacity to 378,200 gallons by upgrading two brine shops in Mifflin and Juniata Counties and constructing a new facility in Elk County. We are also installing additional storage tanks at four stockpiles across the District this year.\n\nTransportation of the brine from the manufacture site to the storage site is also a critical element this process. In addition to utilizing traditional anti-ice / water trucks, District 2-0 retrofits tag trailers with anti-icing units and adapts the mounting of zero velocity spreaders to pull trailers. This initiative has proven to be cost-effective, adds usage to our trailers, and does not affect our truck fleet.\n\nWith our education efforts and technology gains since the 2017/18 winter, we have seen improved continuous gains. As you can see in the bar graph (See Brine Graph), District 2-0 increased brine usage by 24.27% and decreased solid material use by 36.24% from 2018-19. We also exceeded our 2019/20 target of 12 gallons/ton and set a goal of applying 15 gallons of brine per ton of salt for the 2020/21 Winter Season.\n\nCyclic Maintenance with GANNT Chart\n\nOne of District 2-0’s current top County Accreditation initiatives is implementing sectional cycle maintenance to include Gannt chart scheduling.\n\nEach of the nine counties in District 2-0 had previously established six maintenance sections for the core cyclical maintenance activities. During the 2020 Summer Season, our counties implemented using a Gannt chart to schedule both Department Force projects and the necessary equipment, to the Foreman level.\n\nScheduling has provided crews advance knowledge of projects and, subsequently, decreased logistic concerns. Each county structured their crews to be specific to core activity needs and identified the equipment required to perform each cyclic activity. By defining who and what was needed to complete an activity, we identified inefficiencies and reallocated excess capacity in both personnel and equipment.\n\nThe increased focus on planning and scheduling has improved our equipment sharing capabilities. Historically, District 2-0 has been very good at sharing large pieces of equipment such as chippers, graders, and large excavators. By utilizing Gannt charts, we are now able to address our smaller equipment needs, such as skid steers, 5-ton rollers, and hotboxes. We are also in conversations with adjoining Districts to expand equipment sharing opportunities.\n\nWhile COVID-19 disrupted our initial summer plans, our staff saw first-hand that Gannt charts are dynamic and can be modified to adapt to any situation. Many counties have experienced, and staff have expressed, the benefits of using both tools.\n\nImproved SEMP Reporting – As part of the District 2-0 Environmental Unit reorganization, SEMP related activities transitioned from the Maintenance Operations Section to the Environmental Unit where Audit Reports were identified as an area for improvement.\n\nSEMP Audit Reports were redesigned to be similar to the Bridge Inspection Reports. Deficiencies have been categorized and clearly defined and a time frame has been established for corrective action by deficiency type. You can view a sample data sheet here. Additionally, a Summary of Findings was added as a report cover so the reader could easily assess important facility and categorical information. The body of the report details the audit criteria and regulatory standards as well as documents the specific findings at each facility. Finally, Internal Compliance Checklists are included as an appendix.\n\nThe new format of District 2-0’s SEMP Reports have improved communication between the responsible District and County Staff. The updated presentation has increased the efficiency of corrective action and provided an education process that has resulted in fewer and less severe deficiencies.\n\nRoadway\n\nThe 2020 State of Pavement Smoothness Report indicates that District 2-0's median IRI values continue to be lower than the Statewide median value for each business planning network. Further, not only is our overall IRI value on all routes lower than the Statewide value, it is the lowest IRI value in the State.\n\nCounty Name ORG Interstate NHS Non-Interstate Entire NHS Non-NHS Routes w/ADT>2000 Non-NHS Routes w/ADT‹2000 All Routes Centre 2-1 65 77 74 84 152 96 Clearfield 2-2 53 97 77 90 138 114 Clinton 2-3 39 74 50 82 124 105 Cameron 2-4 - - - 89 148 139 McKean 2-5 - 74 74 103 110 99 Potter 2-6 - 95 95 104 161 141 Mifflin 2-7 - 79 79 88 150 114 Elk 2-8 - 89 89 86 161 123 Juniata 2-9 - 60 60 72 164 134 District 2-0 53 82 75 87 143 112 Statewide 63 99 88 120 182 140\n\nUtilizing appropriate pavement preservation and rehabilitation techniques in conjunction with the with performing core maintenance activities has proven effective in maintaining excellent median IRI values. Also, it is critical to the District 2-0 programming process that staff perform visual inspections when evaluating IRI, OPI, and out-of-cycle pavement data.\n\nBridge\n\nOver the past several years, District 2-0’s Asset Management Plan was developed to aggressively address Poor bridges. Currently 3.3% of our bridges are rated Poor, based on Deck Area.\n\nOur proactive Bridge Preservation Program is one of the tools we rely on as we continue to address our bridge condition needs. With the cooperation of our Planning Partners, we have been able to dedicate 10% of our bridge-related Transportation Improvement Plans (TIP’s) funding to bridge preservation efforts. Performing bridge preservation activities extends the service life of our structures and addresses specific structural deficiencies.\n\nThe District 2-0 Maintenance Box Culvert program has also been an important means of improving the District’s overall bridge condition. In 2020, our County Maintenance staff lead the installation efforts of 8 box culverts, 7 of which had an overall rating of Poor. The District is confident that with our Bridge Preservation and Maintenance Box Culvert Programs we can continue to exceed the targets set for the District.\n\nSignificant Projects\n\nCentre County SR 322-B06\n\nDistrict 2-0 was pleased to hold the ribbon cutting for the new Route 322 Potters Mills Gap Project in November 2020. The completion of this 4-lane roadway on the new alignment will reduce congestion through the area and allow traffic to move more efficiently and safely from the Mifflin/Centre County line to west of Potters Mills. This has been an extremely challenging 3-phase project with construction spanning over seven years. Work this summer to rehabilitate former State Route 322 will complete the $108 million project.\n\nCentre County I80-A18\n\nThis is the first phase of the long-awaited Highspeed Interchange Project in Centre County connecting I-99 to I-80. This phase involves the construction of a local interchange that will provide access to I-80 from State Route 26, Jacksonville Road. This $52 million project was bid in April 2020 and is expected to be open to traffic in 2022. The project includes a modern diamond interchange with a 4-span structure that crosses over I-80. Also included is 2000’ of new roadway connecting Jacksonville Road and the new interchange along with 3 miles of full-depth reconstruction of I-80.\n\nClearfield County I80-B41\n\nThe $17.9 million Woodland Interchange Reconstruction Project at MM 123 on I-80 was bid in January 2020 and work will be completed by the end of 2021. The project will improve an older diamond interchange by replacing the structures to provide the proper vertical clearance, extending the ramps to meet current acceleration and deceleration criteria, providing turning lanes on State Route 970 with the appropriate storage lengths and correct a serious drainage issue along State Route 970. A temporary bridge established in the median has allowed the project to be constructed while still maintaining two lanes of traffic in each direction.\n\nDistrict 3\n\nAsset Management\n\nCyclical Sectional Maintenance (6-Year Plan)\n\nThe District 3 Cyclical Sectional Maintenance 6-Year Plan (6YP) was created in calendar year 2020 in preparation for work to begin on the first section in 2021. Each of the nine counties was divided into six sections and maintenance programmed such that High-Level (HL) Treatment Networks are addressed on a 3-year cycle and Low-Level Treatment Networks on a 6-year cycle. This methodology ensures the correct treatment type, seal coat, micro-surfacing or crack sealing, is applied at the right time, out-of-cycle projects are efficiently incorporated into the rotation, and core maintenance activities, such as shoulder cutting, side dozing, pipe flushing, and tail ditching are effectively addressed in the process.\n\nThe Department’s Maintenance IQ application has been extremely beneficial assisting county staff develop and assess their 6YP. District Maintenance IQ Power User, Melissa Kiessling, created Sectional Cycle Maintenance Plan Review maps that identify cyclical needs in ‘Required’, ‘Planned’, ‘Completed’ or ‘Not Warranted’ color coded categories providing a visual presentation of the plan. Using the county’s roadway inventory data as a basis for the maps ensures all roadway notifications have been entered and any gaps or overlapping projects are clearly identified.\n\nBy July 1, 2021 each county manager will have confirmed all core maintenance activities have been planned for all six sections. Maintenance IQ will continue to be used to document completion of the core maintenance items as planned.\n\nSafety\n\nDays Without Disabling Injury\n\nAs of December 31, 2020:\n\nSullivan County: 3,852 days (10 years, 7 months) without a disabling injury - the longest active streak of its kind in PennDOT history.\n\nUnion County 3,088: days (8 years, 6 months) without a disabling injury.\n\nSafety Project – Duke Street\n\nThe Route 147-110/11-113, Northumberland Reconstruction Project, was a $13.7 million project started in 2017 and completed in 2020. This project aimed to improve safety and congestion on Routes 11 and 147 within Northumberland Borough. Two intersections were widened, pedestrian crossings improved through busy intersections and modern signals installed for greater safety. The pavement was reconstructed with concrete in some areas and in other areas asphalt paving, including stone matrix asphalt (SMA) - a gap-graded hot mix asphalt providing maximum durability and rut-resistance.\n\nSafety Project - Route 220 Section 122 Safety Corridor Project\n\nThis $40.9 million project, traversing through Woodward and Piatt Townships, Lycoming County, west of the City of Williamsport, provides safety enhancements through improved highway access points, median U-turns, left turn jug handles, deceleration and acceleration lanes and various other improvements along the mainline. Design for the corridor improvements resulted from the Access Management Study with public input. The safety project’s focus was to reduce fatalities and severe injuries by minimizing vehicle right angle conflict points, closing unimproved median crossovers, and improving the access points throughout the entire corridor.\n\nThe work on Route 220, from the intersection with Route 287 near Jersey Shore to the intersection with Route 2014 (Fourth Street) near the City of Williamsport, also included replacement of the structures crossing Larry's Creek and Queneshukney Run, a new structure carrying relocated Front Street over Queneshukney Run, and rehabilitation and widening of the structures over Pine Run.\n\nModifications to the existing roadway in East Linden, guide rail upgrades, highway lighting and other miscellaneous work was also included as part of this project. The 2020 construction season focused on placing temporary pavement to allow two lanes of traffic in each direction.\n\nSafety Project - HSIP Program Approach\n\nBased on the results from the Federal Safety Performance Measures for 2018, the Department was required to prepare and submit an implementation plan for the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) to FHWA. This plan identified areas of opportunity to reduce fatalities and suspected serious injury crashes.\n\nWe program projects that can treat entire networks with systematic updates. This pro-active approach includes programming High Tension Median Cable Barrier (HTMCB) into freeway projects with separate contracts to fill in the gaps. In addition, the installation of rumble strips, all weather pavement markings, and high friction surface treatments based on crash patterns help reduce fatal and suspected serious injury crashes within the District limits.\n\nAdding additional dollars from other funding sources to supplement the $53 million HSIP monies allocated to the district allows us to select the right treatment for the right locations. These right location or spot treatment safety projects address roadway sections experiencing a crash pattern involving a high number of fatal and suspected serious injury crashes. A combination of systematic and spot location safety projects has contributed to the district’s HSIP program success. Tracking HSIP project investments from 2002 to 2015 showed these expenditures resulted in a 30 percent reduction of fatal and suspected serious injury crashes in District 3 compared to the statewide average reduction of only 11 percent.\n\nEnvironmental and Sustainability\n\nPaving Partnership Projects with Chief Oil & Gas\n\nSullivan County\n\nThe District 3 Central Paving Crew partnered with Chief Oil & Gas to complete a 3.5-mile resurfacing Paving Partnership Project in Sullivan County on Route 4002 and Route 4003. Total paving for both routes was 3.3-miles long with 1,000 tons of widening material, 46,000 square yards of reclamation and 10,400 tons of material were placed. At a cost of $1,100,000, Chief Oil & Gas contributed half the funds for the partnership.\n\nLycoming County\n\nThe District 3 Central Paving Crew partnered with Chief Oil & Gas to complete a 0.8-mile resurfacing Paving Partnership Project in Lycoming County on Route 2015. One thousand four hundred fifty (1,450) tons of material was used at a total project cost of $120,000. Chief Oil & Gas contributed half the funds in the partnership.\n\nFull Depth Reclamation\n\nBradford County Department Force staff completed a full depth reclamation project on Route 1045, Horn Brook Road, in Sheshequin Township, Bradford County. Considerable hills and curves along the 3.48 project miles made the work challenging.\n\nFull-depth reclamation (FDR) is a rehabilitation method that works by uniformly crushing, pulverizing, and re-mixing the existing roadway to achieve a uniform and stable base. Additional millings were added to the existing roadway before the FDR took place. This process offers a cost-effective method to create a stabilized base, ready for placement of the overlay, at approximately $76,201 a mile. Work was carried out in 1-mile sections each day and despite enduring several rain and flooding events, the project was completed in approximately two and a half months.\n\nTo aid in pavement preservation, 10,000 feet of underdrain was installed after the FDR was complete and before the asphalt base was placed. After the two-week curing, the Regional Paving Crew paved with three inches of 19MM warm mix asphalt. Bradford County Department Force staff then completed the shoulder backup and driveway entrance finishing. The roadway was seal coated in 2020. Total cost of the project was approximately $440,000.\n\nBradford Route 414-69S Embankment Repair Project with Stream Relocation\n\nThe Route 414-69S project consisted of the repair of a soil slide on Route 414 near the intersection of Jennings Road in Leroy Township, Bradford County. The project began in the fall of 2018 and was completed in October 2020. The work included relocating and placing amended soils in and around the relocated tributary to Towanda Creek. Careful coordination and cooperation amongst the Pennsylvania Department of Environment Protection (DEP), the Army Corps of Engineers, the District 3-0 Environmental Unit and Bradford County Conservation District made this project successful. Total project cost was $3.9 million dollars.\n\nMajor Projects\n\nCentral Susquehanna Valley Transportation (CSVT) Project\n\nProgress continued and included a significant milestone in 2020 for the $865 million Central Susquehanna Valley Transportation (CSVT) Project, which will ultimately provide a 13-mile, four-lane, limited-access highway in Northumberland, Union, and Snyder Counties, connecting Route 147 south of Interstate 80 to the north end of the Selinsgrove Bypass (Routes 11/15).\n\nThe significant milestone of 2020 was the completion of the new bridge over the West Branch of the Susquehanna River that is a major component of the project’s Northern Section. The 4,545-foot river bridge was completed in December, roughly five years after its construction began in late 2015.\n\nWith the river bridge finished, only one construction contract remains to be completed for the Northern Section, which will connect Route 147 south of Montandon in Northumberland County to Route 15 south of Winfield in Union County. The final contract involves the paving of the new highway, and it must be completed to open the river bridge and the rest of the Northern Section to traffic.\n\nPaving operations began for portions of the Northern Section in 2019. They will be focused in 2021 on the areas adjacent to the newly completed river bridge, including the new interchange with Route 15 just south of Winfield. The Northern Section is anticipated to be fully completed and opened to traffic in 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, final design and other pre-construction activities continue to move forward for the project's Southern Section, which will connect Route 15 south of Winfield in Union County to Routes 11/15 north of Selinsgrove in Snyder County. Final plans preparation, right-of-way acquisitions, utility relocations, and waterway/wetland and NPDES permitting are ongoing, and they must be completed prior to the start of construction, which is currently anticipated in 2022. The Southern Section is anticipated to be completed and opened to traffic in 2027.\n\nOther Achievements - Regional Interstate Guide Rail Contract Review-Design Team\n\nCentral Office initiated a 3-year requirement to ensure all guide rails and guide rail end treatments on interstate roadways were compliant with the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH) standards. To accomplish this, the condition of all existing interstate guide rails and guide rail end treatments in District 3 were assessed, upgraded designs for any substandard appurtenances were developed and the upgraded designs and documentation were provided to Central Office to be incorporated into a regional contract.\n\nA review of Interstates 80 and 180 revealed approximately 550,000 linear feet (LF) of guide rail currently in place. Excluding locations that would be rectified by projects programmed to be bid prior to prior to 2022, approximately 400,000 LF of guide rail needed to be field viewed, designed, documented, and submitted.\n\nLed by the Traffic Safety section, over a two-week timeframe, this group of individuals, in multiple two-person teams, were on the interstate roadway each day assessing guide rail and end treatments, while at the same time maintaining current schedules, workloads, deadlines, and customer response timeframes. Long days and weekend work were required to meet the mid-April deadline, culminating in approximately 500 man-hours to complete this task on time.\n\nThis team was recognized for their efforts with a District 3 Group of the Quarter (GOTQ) award.\n\nIn the photo, top row: Ken Allensworth, Traffic Control Specialist, Jason Barrett – Highway Drafter, Kyle Bunce – Environmental Planner 2, Luke Franzen – Environmental Manager, Mary Guinter – Tort Liability Specialist; Middle row: Bill Houpt – Asst.

Safety Engineer, Anna Rose Temple – Transportation Technician.\n\nProject Delivery\n\nMulti-modal Connectivity (Montour Street Airport Connector, Marsh Creek Greenway, and CSVT Special Impact Study)\n\nTransitioning from the traditional assets, we understand the need to connect and enhance provisions for all modes of transportation. Our Multimodal Coordinator and Local Projects Coordinator work with our planning partners to ensure we accommodate all modes on every project. In some cases, specific stand-alone efforts are necessary to address specific modal needs.\n\nMontour Street Airport Connector:\n\nDistrict 3 has one commercial service airport: the Williamsport Regional Airport. The Montour Street Connector Project is being designed instead of its predecessor - an earmark funded, dedicated, new access road and bridge into the Williamsport Regional Airport, which was shelved nearly a decade ago due primarily to the large costs associated with the project. Working with the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), the remaining earmark funding was salvaged and applied to a different airport access improvement project that improves existing streets and intersections. In addition to a more direct access from Interstate 180, the completed project will include sidewalks, lighting, upgraded signals, and a new at-grade crossing that will satisfy the earmark requirements and meet the airport needs.\n\nMarsh Creek Greenway:\n\nWe are working with Tioga County to advance the Marsh Creek Greenway project (also known as Tioga County, SR 0-MCG, 105066) which, when completed, will connect the 65-mile Pine Creek Rail Trail to downtown Wellsboro. District 3 is working with the Rural Planning Organization (RPO) to leverage Federal CMAQ funds with DCNR funds and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) funds. To ensure that the complicated project stays on schedule, the District is providing project management expertise. Ultimately, this $15 million project will provide additional modal options while also enhancing Wellsboro’s status as a tourist destination.\n\nCSVT Special Impact Study:\n\nCompletion of the Central Susquehanna Valley Transportation (CSVT) project has the potential to affect the Route 147, Route 15, and Interstate 180 major corridors within District 3 and the municipalities adjacent to them. We are partnering with the SEDA-COG and WATS MPOs on a CSVT Project Special Impact Study to examine the potential traffic diversion and subsequent land use impacts that may be caused by completion of the CSVT, and to make recommendations for mitigating any unwanted impacts. The study area focuses on the areas that exhibit the greatest potential for the CSVT project to impact future development:\n\nRoute 147 from the Ridge Road interchange to the Intersate-80/Interstate-180 interchange\n\nInterstate-180 from the Interstate-80 interchange to the Route 15/Market Street interchange in Williamsport; and\n\nRoute 15 from Winfield to the Interstate-180/Route 15/Market Street interchange in Williamsport.\n\nOngoing coordination with a study management team, steering committee, corridor municipalities, and partnering agencies is providing essential information and guidance. Additional outreach will gauge public opinion on study recommendations using a public open house and legislative briefings.\n\nStudy recommendations will be identified that address safety, system operations, economic development potential, and land use policy. Final recommendations will be presented to the MPOs for their endorsement, and the formal study process will end on June 30, 2021.\n\nOther Achievements - PennDOT Connects Columbia Route 11-65E Addressing Municipal Sidewalk Needs\n\nUnable to outreach in person, District 3 staff were still very active in PennDOT Connects during the COVID-19 pandemic. Working with our planning partners we negotiated roles and responsibilities that worked for each region’s needs and staffing capabilities. We prepared project lists, identified affected municipalities, sent outreach letters and set up forms in the Connects System.\n\nA series of reconstruction and resurfacing projects in Bloomsburg resulted in a successful Connects engagement. During planning, the municipality made us aware of their desire for sidewalks in a section of the project area. Working with the town and MPO, we successfully acquired a Transportation Alternative (TA) Set Aside awarded to fund sidewalks and let this, Columbia County, Route 11-65E project with other highway project contracts. The combined project was lauded by the Statewide TA Coordinator who said: “I’m glad we got a pretty good bid on this large project and the first one – at least I’m aware of – where we used PennDOT Connects to identify a need, a municipality applied for TA Set-Aside, and then we combined the awarded funds with a larger PennDOT project. Great stuff!”\n\nDistrict 5\n\nReconstruction of I-78 in Greenwich and Maxatawny Townships, Berks County\n\nThe $168.3 million project is on I-78 from approximately 5.9 miles east of Exit 30 (Hamburg) to the Berks-Lehigh County line (just west of Exit 45/PA 863).\n\nWork includes reconstruction of existing 4 lanes (2 east and 2 west), drainage system improvements, guide rail, fencing, landscaping, message sign boards, signing, delineators and pavement markings.\n\nAlso included is construction of three drainage culvert extensions, new construction of five precast concrete sound barriers, one retaining wall, replacement of three (3) dual single-span pre-stressed concrete Bulb-Tee Bridges, one (1) single-span pre-stressed concrete Bulb-Tee Bridge, two (2) single-span pre-stressed concrete spread box beam bridges, and other miscellaneous construction work, all contained within an overall project length of 8.7 miles.\n\nThe project also includes adding a third lane (“truck climbing lane”) eastbound and westbound on the hill just east of PA 737.\n\nThe H&K Group, Inc of Skippack, PA is the general contractor on the project that began in November 2018 and is anticipated to be complete in May 2023.\n\nPA 248 Rehabilitation in Carbon County\n\nA long-awaited project began in August to rehabilitate PA 248 (POW/MIA Remembrance Highway) in Carbon County between US 209 and the Northampton County.\n\nWork on the project includes upgrading rock fence, upgrading median barrier, concrete patching, concrete joint rehabilitation, milling and paving, upgrading shoulders and guiderail, new pavement markings and other miscellaneous items. The project also includes rehabilitating interchange ramps on this section of PA 248.\n\nJ.D. Eckman, Inc. of Atglen, PA is the general contractor on the $13,869,778 project that is anticipated to be complete in June 2022.\n\nThis section of PA 248 runs through East Penn, Franklin, and Lower Towamensing Townships, and Bowmanstown, Palmerton, and Parryville Boroughs and was first constructed in 1962 and received a major resurfacing in 1999. Smaller sections received minor resurfacing in 2012 and 2014. The average daily traffic volume on PA 248 in Carbon County varies between 18,813 and 22,161 vehicles.\n\nDistrict 5 Begins Major Reconstruction of PA 100 in Lehigh County\n\nA $19.1 million project began in early 2020 to reconstruct the 4-6 lane section of PA 100 from Industrial Boulevard to Main Street/Tilghman Street in Upper Macungie Township, Lehigh County.\n\nThis major project includes roadway reconstruction, storm sewer improvements, water main relocation, curb replacement, milling and overlay of the PA 100/I-78 interchange ramps, upgraded traffic signal equipment, ADA ramp improvements at the intersection of PA 100 and Schantz Road, a new cantilever sign structure at the entrance to the two-lane ramp from PA 100 north to I-78 east, and other miscellaneous construction.\n\nThis section of roadway is a major commercial and industrial corridor in the Lehigh Valley, with an average daily traffic volume of over 36,000 vehicles (21% trucks). Manufacturers such as Boston Beer Company, Keurig Dr. Pepper, Nestle Waters N.A., Niagara Bottling, Coca-Cola, Ocean Spray and Bimbo Bakeries all have major production facilities along the corridor. And multiple large volume distribution facilities in the area include Amazon, Bridgestone Tires, Nestle Distribution, and Home Depot. This area also has many restaurants, hotels, and other retail businesses.\n\nNew Enterprise Stone & Lime Co., Inc. of New Enterprise, PA is the general contractor on the project, which is expected to be complete in August 2022.\n\nInnovation: Sandbag Maker\n\nThe sign crew in PennDOT’s Northampton County Maintenance Office is all about working smarter to prevent injuries. Using a sandbag filler they modified from a You Tube video, the crew was able to make 300 sandbags with four people and one loader in four hours.\n\nUsing the PennDOT version of the sandbag filler is less labor intensive as it uses the loader in place of hand shoveling, and the filler is “rolled” over so there is less bending.\n\nThe crew controlled the weight of the bag by adjusting the length of the PVC pipe. They used 15” pieces of PVC which yielded an average 40-pound bag. Having a consistent weight of sandbags can also lead to less injuries.\n\nOn the PennDOT version of the sandbag filler, the steel is used to act as a stand when the unit is rolled over. It can also be used as a lifting point for a forklift or loader.\n\nHome Offices\n\nAs many have also done, District 5 staff made the adjustment to teleworking during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nVirtual Public Involvement\n\nWith the COVID pandemic changing the way PennDOT conducts Public Involvement, District 5 had multiple Online Plan Displays in 2020. The Online Plans Displays included a Project Description, Location Map, Anticipated Schedule, Detour Map (if applicable), Project Plans and a Comment Form. The Project Manager contact information was also included as well as the District Press Officer’s.\n\nDistrict 6\n\nConstruction Closeouts\n\nDistrict 6 closed out construction contracts on 43 projects in 2020 totaling $1,070,615,231. Some of the most notable include:\n\n$230.2 million project to rebuild and widen 1.5 miles of northbound Interstate 95 between the Girard Avenue and Allegheny Avenue interchanges in Philadelphia\n\n$98.4 million project to build new, wider bridges to improve travel and carry U.S. 422 motorists over the Schuylkill River, Norfolk Southern Railroad, South Trooper Road and Schuylkill River Trail in West Norriton, Upper Merion and Lower Providence townships, Montgomery County\n\n$64.1 million project to widen and improve 2.5 miles of U.S. 322 (Conchester Highway) in Concord Township, Delaware County\n\n$47.6 million to rehabilitate two Interstate 76 (Schuylkill Expressway) viaducts in Center City Philadelphia and West Conshohocken Borough, Montgomery County\n\n$21.7 million project to replace the bridge carrying the Route 452 (Market Street) over Amtrak and SEPTA railroad tracks in Marcus Hook Borough and Lower Chichester Township, Delaware County; and\n\n$3.2 million to rehabilitate the Route 52 (Lenape Road) bridge over Brandywine Creek Floodplain in Birmingham Township, Chester County\n\nHistoric Bridge Preservation Honors\n\nDistrict 6’s commitment to historic bridge preservation garnered three 2020 Preservation Alliance Grand Jury awards for the rehabilitation of five historic structures across the five-county Philadelphia region.\n\nThe bridges that were recognized were:\n\nMain Street Bridge over SEPTA tracks in Sellersville Borough, Bucks County\n\nRoute 52 (Lenape Road) bridge over Brandywine Creek Floodplain in Birmingham Township, Chester County; and\n\nThree bridges that carry Bryn Mawr Avenue over Meadowbrook Run and Doom Run in Radnor Township, Delaware County\n\nASCE Award Winners\n\nTwo District 6 employees were recipients of the 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Philadelphia Section awards. Sarah McInnes, the District 6 Geotechnical Engineer won Geotechnical Engineer of the Year and Lou Belmonte, Assistant District Executive of Operations won the Government Service Award.\n\nSarah McInnes is an active member in the ASCE Philadelphia Section and the Delaware Valley Geo-Institute, currently serves on the ASHE Board of Directors as the scholarship chair and participates on several TRB geotechnically-related committees. She has contributed to the Highway Geology Symposium on the national level since 2007, serving on the Host Committee for the 58th Symposium and on the Steering Committee since 2016. Sarah is also a technical advisor for three geotechnical research projects with Temple and Villanova universities. Sarah was nominated for and received this award based on her dedication to the geoscience discipline, service to ASCE, DVGI, ASHE and other affiliate societies.\n\nLou Belmonte earned the Government Service Award for his work developing the PennDOT Connects Bicycle-Friendly Resurfacing Program, which is a collaborative process to screen roadways on PennDOT’s maintenance program for opportunities to implement locally supported and regionally beneficial bike facility improvements. The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC), who nominated Lou for the award, explained how he helped get the program established, going so far as to find creative ways for project requests to be accommodated even after paving projects have been let. Lou’s approach has been critical in getting the program established and implementing a number of successful improvements even as the program was still in the early stages of development.\n\nInterstate and Expressway Pavement Preservation\n\nDistrict 6 continues to support and advance the department’s emphasis on interstate and expressway preservation.\n\nIn 2020, District 6 continued construction on projects to rehabilitate and repair pavement and bridges on Interstate 95 in Delaware County, U.S. 422 in Montgomery County and Route 309 (Sellersville Bypass) in Montgomery and Bucks counties.\n\nThe $69.6 million project on I-95 includes rehabilitating and resurfacing pavement and repairing 15 structures on more than 11 miles of the interstate from the Delaware state line to just north of the Route 420 Interchange.\n\nThe $19.3 million project on U.S. 422 includes rehabilitating pavement and repairing seven structures along a five-mile section between the Royersford/Trappe and Sanatoga interchanges in Limerick and Lower Pottsgrove townships, Montgomery County.\n\nThe $54.3 million project on Route 309 (Sellersville Bypass) includes the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the 9.1-mile corridor and eight bridges from Unionville Pike in Hatfield Township, Montgomery County, to just north of Rich Hill Road in Richland Township, Bucks County.\n\nActive Traffic Management (ATM) Initiatives Underway in District 6\n\nIn 2020, PennDOT and the Department of General Services issued Notice to Proceed to Heim Construction Company as the design-build contractor for a new Regional Traffic Management Center (RTMC) and district parking garage in King of Prussia. A formal groundbreaking ceremony for these additions took place on August 20, 2020, with work commencing on the new parking garage, which is scheduled to finish in June 2021. Construction of the new RTMC building will begin in January 2021 and is scheduled to be operational by late 2022 with total project completion by May 2023.\n\nThe new southeastern RTMC will be a mission-critical facility responsible for optimizing the safe and efficient movement of traffic across the Philadelphia region through the application of complex transportation systems and incident management strategies along all limited access and major arterial roads. The RTMC maintains 24/7/365 operations, dispatches State Farm Safety Service Patrols, and coordinates closely with the Pennsylvania State Police, City of Philadelphia, and the five county Emergency Operations Centers (EOC) to optimize highway safety and emergency response across the region. PennDOT currently operates 454 CCTV traffic cameras on regional expressways and arterials in District 6, as well as 790 detectors, 72 variable speed limit signs, 201 dynamic message signs and 15 ramp meters via more than 700 miles of fiber optic, including direct connections with the five county EOCs, City of Philadelphia, and numerous agencies and municipalities.\n\nThe need for a new RTMC is driven by the District’s Active Traffic Management (ATM) vision. ATM expansion initiatives underway on many major regional corridors (I-76, I-95, I-476, US 422, US 30), as well as the department’s venture into traffic signal ownership, will result in a doubling (or more) of both devices and staffing over next decade. Although the current RTMC has been retrofitted multiple times to accommodate new technologies, systems and workstations over the years, it is currently operating well over-capacity and simply has no remaining expansion capability.\n\nWith a current focus along the I-76 (Schuylkill Expressway) mainline and parallel corridors, the District continues to move forward with several ATM initiatives including:\n\nRecent activation of PennDOT’s first permanent Variable Speed Limit and Queue Detection and Warning system under the first phase of a long-range, comprehensive, multimodal transportation management plan designed to enhance travel and safety on I-76 between King of Prussia and Philadelphia.\n\nThe next I-76 mainline phase, currently in design, will transform the existing shoulders on portions of I-76 to accommodate an additional travel lane or “flexible” travel lane during peak travel times or when additional capacity is needed.\n\nPennDOT’s Traffic Signal Ownership (Green Light Go) Pilot program is underway with a focus along the signalized arterials running parallel to the I-76 corridor in Philadelphia and Montgomery counties, where the District will eventually take over ownership responsibility of 72 traffic signals. If successful, the pilot will expand to 1,400 signalized intersections planned for ownership across the District 6 region. The signals will be actively controlled from the RTMC in alignment with the vision to improve and prioritize arterial operations along the state’s super-critical corridors as the single responsible authority through all municipal jurisdictions.\n\nMural Arts Program\n\nThrough a partnership with Mural Arts Philadelphia, District 6 has helped transform and beautify various communities across the City, while also enhancing its infrastructure.\n\nDistrict 6’s highway lighting maintenance team was instrumental in completing and activating Philadelphia’s largest lighted mural display to-date, Electric Philadelphia, which was completed in fall 2020 at the 6th Street underpass at Interstate 676.\n\nPennDOT partnered and allowed right of entry for the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program and installed the power circuit and necessary hardware to supply electricity for the mural’s lighted artwork. This required a significant effort by the highway lighting team through design, review, and execution by the contractor.\n\nPennDOT also installed walkway lighting along 6th street between Wood Street and the I-676 overpass to provide more visibility and safety for pedestrians.\n\nDistrict 6 is currently coordinating the right of entry approval for a new Mural Arts Philadelphia project in the 21st Street underpass at John F. Kennedy Boulevard.\n\nDistrict 9\n\nHopewell Bridge Replacement\n\nOn August 18th, 2020, the Route 915 Hopewell Bridge Project in Hopewell Borough, Bedford County was opened to traffic. The project consisted of replacement of the existing bridge carrying Route 915 over the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River and realignment of Route 26 to improve safety at the adjacent intersection. These improvements required over 450 feet of retaining walls, excavation of the River Mountain rock slope along Route 26, installation of anchored wire mesh to stabilize the rock slope above Route 26, and other miscellaneous construction. The new bridge is a 3-span continuous PA bulb-tee beam bridge with an overall length of 308 feet and was realigned upstream of the existing bridge to create a plus intersection with Route 26. The project was completed by HRI, Inc., of State College.\n\nProject Delivery\n\nSince 2012, D9 has let 99% of projects without missing a committed let date and remained a statewide leader in estimating pre-bid construction cost. The three projects that were delayed were a result of issues with an NPDES permit. The District has subsequently created a Stormwater Management Committee aimed at assisting Project Managers in identifying potential issues before permits are submitted to the DEP.\n\nD9 is also working towards the completion of our Decade of Investment (DOI) commitments. By the end of CY 2020, 75% of DOI projects have been let. We are projecting to deliver 83% by the end of CY 2025.\n\nD9 is planning to complete 489 miles of surface improvements in CY 2021 which includes resurfacing contracts and sealcoating.\n\nDuring construction, D9 is committed to delivering quality projects that meet our stakeholders' needs while making sound, cost-effective decisions when addressing unforeseen conditions. During the 2020 construction season, the District’s cumulative final construction contract amounts were managed to within 2.8% of original bid amounts.\n\nPoor Condition Bridge Reduction\n\nSince 2005, the district has rehabilitated or replaced 599 state-owned poor bridges (28.5% of total inventory) comprising 1,886,000 sf of deck area at a cost of approximately $735 million.\n\nOur 25-year goal of 7.9% poor deck area, established in 2008, was met in 2013 after only five years, and our current % poor deck area is 2.4%. Our 25-year goal of 9.4% for number of poor bridges was met in November 2017, 16 years ahead of schedule.\n\nThe district is committed to maintaining our bridges in fair or better condition and avoiding the unacceptably high poor percentages experienced in the past.\n\nPennDOT Connects\n\nD9 is committed to the successful implementation of PennDOT Connects. In CY 2020 we conducted PennDOT Connects municipal outreach for the remaining 2021 TIP Projects that were not completed in CY 2019. Since January 2020, we have reached out to 16 municipalities to conduct interviews on 14 projects. We have found that most municipalities (88%) were responsive and willing to discuss the projects in their jurisdiction. The initial meetings resulted in the need for follow-up contacts with the municipality approximately 19% of the time. We continue to utilize our District Quality Assurance process to ensure these follow-ups occur before the project advances into final design.\n\nIn CY 2021, D9 plans to conduct PennDOT Connects outreach for candidate projects for the 2023 TIP update.\n\nPennDOT Connects - Follow-Ups\n\n#Projects # Follow-Ups % Follow-Ups Blair 1 0 0.0% Cambria 3 0 0.0% Bedford 4 2 25.0% Fulton 2 0 0.0% Huntingdon 1 1 100% Somerset 3 0 0.0% D9 Totals 14 3 21.4%\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe District is continuing its efforts to emphasize sectional cycle maintenance for shoulder cutting, crack sealing, and sealcoat. Some counties will be committing additional resources in 2021 to complete work that was scheduled in the spring and summer of 2020 but not performed due to COVID shutdowns.\n\nCounties will continue to perform the necessary prep work in advance of these activities. The prep work will include activities such as flushing pipes, replacing pipes, tail ditch cleaning, side dozing, base repairs, and pothole patching. District 9 remains committed to maintaining the quality of our highway network and will continue to emphasize the right treatment at the right time.\n\nDistrict 10\n\nDistrict 10 Innovative Solutions\n\nVirtual Incident Command Center (VICC)\n\nIncident Command is based in situational awareness and real-time communications. Prior to COVID-19, the District had operated a state-of-the art Incident Command Center which had always required in-person attendance. During the pandemic, the District staff was challenged to find a way to communicate from home while teleworking during winter weather events. An innovative approach utilizing Microsoft Teams was implemented. An open Teams meeting call was established for the duration of the activation, which allowed executive staff, county management and ICC staff to dial in at any time and obtain real-time communications and situational awareness on an open telecommunication line. Within the Teams page, a Wiki was formed with all relevant information including staff contact numbers, road closures, and Assistant County Manager shift schedules. Additionally, Event Logs were stored on the page for easy access, and After Action Reviews were hosted on the page.\n\nThe District staff has found the “Virtual ICC” to be so effective that they are considering its use in the future for off-hours incidents. This eliminates the need for ICC staff members to leave the safety of their homes when emergency events may dictate otherwise. The District Command Center will continue to evolve as technology allows.\n\neTicketing\n\nDuring the 2020 construction season and the onset of COVID, District 10 staff searched for ways to increase safety and reduce physical contacts. One such way that contacts were reduced was through eTicketing for our asphalt deliveries.\n\nThrough eTicketing, employees could use one of four proprietary software systems integrated with the producer’s plants. They could also view and/or photograph the physical ticket then record the data in OneNote.\n\nThe four approved eTicketing softwares that were used in District 10 were: CONNEX by Command Alkon, DOTslip, FleetWatcher, and Libra Sentinel. These systems provide virtual solutions to track and manage material delivery in real-time.\n\nThese systems provided access for our inspectors to electronically write on the eTickets and gave them the ability to save the entire days’ placement of eTickets to a PDF document. Additionally, the inspector could photograph the ticket and record all the necessary data in a OneNote spreadsheet for the inspectors’ use. Using these eTicketing software systems, we were able to reduce physical contacts and increase the productivity of our process.\n\nMastic Usage\n\nArmstrong County piloted utilizing Mastic material on State Route 28 in the fall of 2019. The product has now successfully gone through two winter seasons and still looks like it did when it was placed. The initial cost of the Mastic material is more expensive when comparing it to our normal crack sealing material, however it can provide longer term repairs to larger cracks in the pavement.\n\nSome facts about the Mastic Operation are:\n\nIt takes about 3-4 kettles to have an efficient operation\n\nIt takes 2 hours to heat a kettle\n\nOnly 30 minutes to empty a kettle\n\nUtilized approximately 2.5 pallet/mile\n\nOverall, with the way this material is holding up the condition of the road it is showing to be very effective. In the long run it will save the County time and money as areas will not have to be addressed every year once the Mastic is placed.\n\nAWSO Summer Schedule\n\nCOVID has impacted many things about the way we do business. Some creative solutions have been used to work within the guidelines while saving money and increasing employee productivity. In District 10, Indiana and Jefferson Counties implemented alternate work schedules with the Sealcoat Operations crews to eliminate overtime and continue to complete jobs efficiently. Using this solution, crews increased production by 17% while showing an overall 56% reduction in overtime costs based on the 2019 costs.\n\nBalls Bend Project\n\nThe Balls Bend project is one project in an overall corridor improvement initiative on State Route 228 in the quickly developing region of southern Butler County. The approximately 1.3-mile-long project addresses adverse roadway curvature, capacity and access issues and includes substantial horizontal and vertical realignment of the existing roadway. It widens the roadway from two lanes to four lanes (two through lanes in each direction). The project also includes installation of auxiliary turning lanes at various locations and the installation of a new traffic signal at the State Route 228/Harbison Road/Park Road intersection.\n\nThe project funding is a combination of state and federal funds including approximately $12.8 million of Federal BUILD Grant funding that was secured by the County of Butler as part of the “Gateway 228” initiative. In 2018, Butler County, with assistance from Delta Development and in coordination with District 10, was successful in obtaining a federal BUILD Grant – part of $1.5 billion distributed nationwide.\n\nMSA Thruway Project\n\nThe MSA Thruway Project is a $12 million enhancement to the roadway network near the Interstate 79 and State Route 228 Interchange in Cranberry Township, Butler County. This partnership between the township, PennDOT, and local developers establishes a tunnel connection from Interstate 79 Northbound to the Cranberry Springs Development, thereby keeping traffic off of the congested 228 corridor.\n\nThe scope of improvements for the project includes new ramps, a roundabout, and a CON-SPAN arch culvert which will carry two lanes of traffic under State Route 228. Completion of the project is scheduled for the winter of 2021.\n\nSmicksburg Bridge\n\nIn the heart of Amish country in Smicksburg, Indiana County, a bridge upgrade project turned into a complete superstructure replacement. The continuous three-span steel bridge over Little Mahoning Creek was built in 1960 and was in poor condition. Work to replace the deck and a fractured beam was halted three times – once for COVID, and twice when cracked critical welds were discovered in the other girders.\n\nClose consultation between Construction field staff and the District Bridge Unit, along with partnering with the contractor (Mekis Construction), Central Office, a design consultant (KCI), and the fabricator (High Steel Structures) allowed for a successful pivot on a short timeline to a complete superstructure replacement.\n\nDuring the accelerated design and beam fabrication period, Mekis was able to complete preliminary work, and negotiated costs and time impacts, and the Design Unit worked on finding the necessary funding. The delays still pushed work deep into the winter months. As labor became available from other projects that were shut down for the winter, Mekis was able to bring on additional staff and accelerate the schedule for deck pours into early December 2020. Cold weather curing methods protected the deck from air temperatures as low as 25 degrees.\n\nThe structure will temporarily reopen in January 2021 to reduce the impact to Amish community members living on the far side of the bridge from the town and their schools. Final work items and final reopening are scheduled for spring of 2021.\n\nArmstrong Slides\n\nThe terrain of Armstrong County presents unique challenges for highway slope stability and landslides. The County monitors more than 105 landslides with around 46 of these considered active. In 2018, Armstrong County received record rainfalls with a 50% increase of the average normally received. This caused five of these active landslides to let loose and forced the County to close three roads. The County acted quickly and began systematically repairing these deficiencies during the winter months in between winter needs. Since 2018, Armstrong County has repaired eight landslide locations with another three planned for 2021.\n\nDistrict 11\n\nConstruction Highlights\n\nNegotiating Contracts During COVID\n\nIn Construction, 111 projects were shut down and restarted, 40 projects have had costs submitted, and we have 38 of those settled. The other 73 projects had costs mitigated through partnering. The construction season was highlighted by the $3.7 million Sewickley Bridge Preservation project, the $11.5 million Route 28 landslide and resurfacing project, the $7.9 million I-376 Parkway West resurfacing project, and the $10.9 million Route 22 resurfacing project in Allegheny County. In Beaver County, the highlight was the $11.7 million SR 51 resurfacing and bridge preservation project and in Lawrence County, it was the $9.2 million Wampum Bridge replacement project.\n\nSewickley Bridge Rehabilitation\n\nThis was a $3.7 million project that utilized a single 24-day bridge closure for accelerated expansion dam replacements, a Latex Modified Concrete (LMC) overlay, an approach roadway reconstruction, and bearing replacements. The accelerated technique utilized for expansion dam replacement was incorporated into Pub 408 and District 11 received compliments from local stakeholders on the duration and quality of the work.\n\nElizabeth Bridge\n\nThe Elizabeth Bridge project involved a major rehabilitation of the main truss and multiple approach structures that carry 4 lanes of State Route 51 over the Monongahela River in southern Allegheny County. The project was completed in the fall of 2020 with a total construction cost of just over $34.8 million. Work included full paint, grid deck replacement, latex overlays, bearing replacement, substructure and drainage repairs, expansion dam replacement, the installation of new sidewalk railings, and various steel repairs including stringer replacement work. In 2020, construction was temporarily halted for a 3-week COVID shutdown but was granted an early restart approval due to concerns of the structure being supported by the temporary jacking and support system for an extended duration. The project finished up with the successful replacement of all 18 pairs of suspension cables and associated bracket assemblies, as well as the replacement of the existing rocker bearings with updated high load multi-rotational disc bearings on the northernmost river pier.\n\nVirtual HOLA\n\nDistrict 11 Materials Unit, working with Lindy Paving’s QC Management, developed guidelines on how to handle Hands-On Local Acceptance (HOLA) testing for asphalt while under COVID-19 restrictions. The solution they collaboratively developed maximizes safety – the paramount concern with our operations through this pandemic. The new procedures involve the use of high definition cameras to allow witnessing of the tests while maintaining social distancing and the use of electronic sharing to review the test results before they are entered and finalized in the electronic Construction and Materials Management System (eCAMMS).\n\nConstruction Drone Flights\n\nDistrict 11 instituted monthly drone flights where possible, on projects to document progress, enhance social distancing and safety, and calculate quantities. Drone flights were utilized on the CAP Project, Kenmawr Bridge Replacement (also using “Reconstruct” software, which ties drone imagery to project schedule), several slide projects, and a final inspection, to minimize social interaction during the pandemic.\n\nDesign Highlights\n\nRoute 28 Virtual Public Meeting\n\nAmid the growing concerns of COVID-19, PennDOT District 11 acted quickly to cancel the State Route 28 Highland Park Interchange Reconstruction Project in-person public meeting and instead held the District’s first virtual public meeting on PennDOT's website. With the success of using the virtual format for the Highland Park public meeting and the ongoing restrictions for other in-person events, District 11 continued to conduct meetings online, providing the necessary information for the public to review and comment. Additional meetings included the Kenmawr Bridge Replacement Project, the Smithfield Bridge Preservation Project, the Neville Island Bridge Preservation Project and the Fern Hollow Road/Little Sewickley Creek Road Slide Remediation Project.\n\nBridge Inspection Drone Flights\n\nIn 2020, District 11’s Drone Pilot for Bridge Inspection and our Chief of Surveys collaborated on semi-weekly drone tests for bridge inspection purposes. This involved testing the drone in different scenarios – close to structures, under structures, high winds, GPS capability, etc. The observations are captured for a report to be shared with the Bridge Unit and Executive Staff for further development of the Department’s drone program.\n\nIn addition, District 11 and Michael Baker International (MBI) collaborated on an ongoing unmanned aircraft system study to demonstrate and compare multiple drones on bridges in the Pittsburgh region. The goals of the test flights were to collect data on which drones worked best in various situations, how different results could be achieved in the same application for each drone, and to simulate the different applications for use in the Department’s bridge inspection program.\n\nMaintenance & Traffic Highlights\n\nOur Maintenance staff accomplished much of their planned cycle maintenance work despite having to operate in skeleton crews at the beginning of the pandemic. In addition to their planned work, they facilitated over 2,300 Customer Care Center concerns. Between our Maintenance Forces and our Construction staff working with our contractors, 48 landslide remediation projects were completed in 2020. Even with the COVID-19 pandemic, our maintenance crews were able to complete or nearly complete many of our cycle maintenance activities. Crews in all three counties were able to complete a large seal coat program, preserving the pavement on our lower ADT roadways.\n\nRoadway Signs Are Now On Cycle\n\nAs of September 1, 2020, after nearly four years of planning and hard work, the District, as well as all three Counties, are on cycle regarding signs ≥ 18 years of age.\n\nRoadway Incidents Are A 24/7 Business\n\nIn 2020, our Tunnels organization responded to 1,791 incidents and the Western Regional Traffic Management Center handled 31,603 roadway events for the 18 western regional counties while working remotely from home.\n\nFort Pitt Tunnel Rescue\n\nIn October 2020, a crash occurred near the Fort Pitt garage on the Parkway West, involving multiple vehicles colliding. One of the vehicles went over the hillside and landed on its side in Saw Mill Run creek. Employees at the tunnel heard the accident and immediately responded by climbing down the hill to the vehicle. The motorist was injured and unable to get out of the car. Tunnel staff stabilized the car with nearby rocks and tree branches and removed the windshield so a medical professional who happened to be driving by could assess the motorist. City of Pittsburgh Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and the Pennsylvania State Police arrived at the scene and set up access with a rope line down the hill. Everyone assisted EMS with removing the motorist, carrying the motorist on the backboard basket, and helped pull them up the hill. After the motorist was taken by ambulance, they worked on getting access for the towing company to remove the vehicle. Several of the Tunnel staff assisted with removing the vehicle from the creek.

The District has committed an increase in funding to remediate slides. The Department repaired a large landslide on SR 68 near Midland in Beaver County using deep soil mixing techniques. Deep soil mixing was used as an innovative landslide remediation technique for this repair due to bedrock being far too deep to repair using standard techniques. Also, the landslide in this area had been occurring for many years over a vast land-area. The deep soil mixing consisted of large drilling augers that mixed cement into the ground as they drilled deep into the subsurface.\n\nDistrict 12\n\nMajor Projects\n\nThe pandemic changed the way we conduct our work both internally and externally, district personnel were able to transition to virtual work seamlessly and successfully since March of 2020. The Design Unit continued to work effectively in both a quantitative and qualitative way. Some notable accomplishments for the year:\n\nBid 32 projects for a total cost of $74,220,604. Of those, 28 were delivered remotely.\n\nCompleted 1213 state and 511 local bridge inspections\n\nThe District 12 Environmental Unit initiated a joint Stream Bank Restoration project along Miller’s Run in Washington County between PennDOT, California University of PA and Cecil Township. The project will result in PennDOT, and possibly Cecil Twp., obtaining sedimentation reduction credits to fulfill the requirements of the MS4 permit.\n\nWe executed 4 design agreements:\n\nBridge Unit Open End\n\nI-70: Belle Vernon Bridge to Bentleyville Reconstruction\n\nValleybrook/Bebout Road Intersection Project\n\nBebout Road/East McMurray Road Intersection Project\n\nI-70 Corridor\n\nInterstate 70 in Westmoreland County\n\nThe Interstate 70 (I-70) Corridor continues to play a major part in the Design and Construction activities in District 12. Our two biggest interstate projects in Design were able to progress as if we were working in our own office:\n\nI-70 at PA 51 interchange- tentative bid date of 01/27/22. This project is the reconstruction of the PA 51 interchange located on I-70 in Rostraver Township, Westmoreland County and includes improvements to both I-70 and SR 51. The project will reconstruct approximately 1.7 miles of I-70 beginning at the Smithton High Level Bridge over the Youghiogheny River and ending approximately one mile west of the PA 51 interchange. These upgrades will make this section of I-70 similar to other reconstructed sections of I-70 to the east and west. A key feature of this project will include a Diverging Diamond Interchange (DDI) to replace the current substandard cloverleaf interchange at I-70/SR 51. This will be the second Diverging Diamond interchange in District 12; the first was completed in 2016 at the I-70/SR 19 Murtland Avenue interchange in Washington County. In addition, approximately one mile of SR 51 will be reconstructed and widened. The project also includes work on eight structures including the replacements of the PA 51 over I-70 and the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad over PA 51 structures and the rehabilitation of the I-70 Smithton High level bridge.\n\nI-70 at the Arnold City Interchange- tentative bid date of 08/11/22. This project is the reconstruction of the Arnold City Interchange at Exit 44 on I-70 located in Rostraver Township, Westmoreland County. The project will reconstruct approximately 1.75 miles of I-70, including the replacement of two structures over the Interstate at SR 3011 (Indian Hill Road) and SR 3017 (Crawford Lane) and a revised interchange alignment that addresses geometric, operation and safety issues. The existing interchange is a diamond configuration and will remain a diamond configuration after construction, except a roundabout will be utilized for the Eastbound Ramp terminal. Additional improvements include wider shoulders and median on both I-70 and the ramps, drainage, signing, stormwater management, median barrier, guiderail, and ITS.\n\nI-70 at the Yukon and Madison Interchanges- Construction began on the construction of the $93 million Interstate I-70-L10 project which includes complete reconstruction of the Yukon and Madison interchanges as well as reconstruction of four miles of I-70.\n\nThese projects continue with our strategic plan for our interstate projects. Progress is shown on the maps below.\n\nInterstate 70 in Washington County\n\nThe largest Interstate 70 project competed in 2020 was in Washington County. This project includes the complete reconstruction and widening of approximately 6.5 miles of Interstate 70 from the Route 136/Beau Street Interchange to the SR 519 interchange. The western end of the project connects to the recently constructed I-70-T20 project and completes the link to the recently constructed I-70/SR 0019 Interchange. The SR 70-T10 and SR 70-W31 projects were initially scheduled to be bid separately but were combined to allow more efficient construction and traffic control.\n\nThe SR 70-T10 project spans from the SR 136 Interchange to the I-79 South Junction in South Strabane Township, Washington County. The project included the widening and reconstruction of I-70 from two to three lanes in each direction in the area and is based on a 60-mph design speed. The new template in this section includes three 12-foot lanes, 12 foot outside shoulder, 10 foot inside shoulder and varying width of grass median. The project includes improvements to the existing entrance and exit ramps along I-70 at Exit 20 (Beau Street). Noise Barrier Walls were also constructed along a section of Westbound I-70.\n\nThe SR 70-W31 Section of this project, which has limits from the I-79 South Junction with I-70 to the Route 519 Interchange, included complete reconstruction and widening of I-70 to accommodate two 12 foot lanes, 12 foot outside shoulders, 10 foot median and is based on 70 mph design speed. This project included improvements to the existing Eastbound entrance and Westbound exit ramps at the I-79 South Junction Interchange. The project also included the realignment of T-574 (Wilson Road) and the relocation of approximately 2650 lineal feet of a tributary of Little Chartiers Creek to accommodate improved geometry on I-70. Replacement of the entire drainage system included construction of 12 detention basins for storm water management. All signs, pavement markings and highway lighting were upgraded. Guide rail was upgraded to latest safety standards and new overhead sign structures were installed.\n\nWork on this project began in January 2017 with Lane Construction as the Prime Contractor. Utilizing the construction of more than 140,000 square yards of temporary pavement, the project was successfully completed in December of 2020 while maintaining four lanes of Interstate 70 at all times. Intermittent single lane closures and traffic restrictions were only used during off peak hours.\n\nThe project area drains into tributaries of Little Chartiers Creek and Chartiers Creek which is considered a High-Quality Watershed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. By closely managing the construction site, the project team maintained a successful partnership with the Washington County Conservation District (PADEP inspecting authority) throughout all phases of construction. By utilizing a detailed review process and conducting regular meetings and site visits, the work was performed in this High-Quality Watershed while maintaining the conservation of Pennsylvania’s natural resources.\n\nCompletion of this $120 million project required nearly 300,000 tons of construction aggregate, 120,000 cubic yards of concrete, and placed more than 286,000 square yards of concrete pavement, all locally produced and placed by local tradespersons.\n\nWith the completion of this project, I-70 between the junctions of I-79 is three lanes in each direction. This very important project will alleviate congestion in this corridor and improve safety for years to come. This is the highest traffic volume road in District 12.\n\nSlide Repairs\n\nDistrict 12 has some of the most susceptible soil to landslides in the eastern part of the US. In 2020, we had the opportunity to complete 4 major projects to repair significant landslides that required the roads to be closed. One of these areas was a section of PA 906 that experiences large rocks falling onto the roadway as well as a subsurface failure below the roadway. We were able to develop and employ a repair to scale the rock and install a rock fall wall in the worst area to prevent additional impacts to the roadway and perform subsurface soil stabilization to support the roadway. Through this hard work, the roadway was stabilized and reopened to traffic.\n\nSR 906 Before:\n\nSR 906 After:\n\nAnother project was along SR 4099 in Westmoreland County where an ancient slide was allowing the roadway support slope to fail and road to settle. In this case, we contracted a repair to install a pin pile treatment to arrest the slide and support the roadway. This work was critical as it is a primary connector for two communities. Without this roadway, residents would have been disjointed and separated creating a hardship on both communities.\n\nSR 4099 Before:\n\nSR 4099 After:\n\nConstruction Unit Projects\n\nThe District 12 construction team completed 36 projects in 2020 with a total contract value of $252 million including, in addition to the I-70 projects above, the $24 million SR 31-X10 project that reconstructed 2 miles of SR 31 in Donegal PA, including safety improvements to the SR 31 interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike; a $12 million Route 381-OMG project in Ohiopyle, PA which included the reconstruction of one mile of SR 381, new sidewalks, construction of a pedestrian underpass, traffic calming devices and the replacement of the superstructure on the major bridge crossing the Youghiogheny River; a $15.5 million SR 356 project including the reconstruction, realignment and widening of 1.5 miles of Route 356 in Freeport PA; and the $10.5 million Route 18-T10 project in Washington PA which includes reconstruction and resurfacing of 1 mile of Route 18 and a portion of E. Wylie Ave.\n\nSuccess vs. COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 virus quickly became a world-wide challenge in 2020. Lives were affected in ways no one could have predicted. Many businesses were shut down or services greatly reduced. PennDOT was no less affected by the mandatory shutdowns. Employees were suddenly required to adapt to doing business in a very different way. Employees whose job requirements allowed them to work from home began tele-working. Our IT units were then tasked with providing the necessary equipment for those employees to be able to work remotely in an efficient manner. Meetings which were held face-to-face now had to be done in a virtual environment which required employees to train and learn to use our computers to communicate internally and externally.\n\nConstruction projects which had been shut down for as much as two months could restart once COVID-19 Safety Plans had been developed, approved, and implemented. Safety personnel and project managers worked tirelessly to get the projects in compliance and back on track. One example was the Ohiopyle Multimodal Gateway Project which was reopened and completed with minimal delays affecting the summer tourist season.\n\nDistrict 12 put in place all COVID-19 safety procedures required to keep employees safe during this pandemic. Masks became a new PPE for all employees to restrict the spread of the virus among the workforce. Summer maintenance activities were challenging while keeping these safety protocols in place. It was soon realized how important keeping our employee’s infection free would be with the upcoming winter season. The loss of operators during the winter season could adversely affect our ability to keep the roadways open and passable during any winter storm event. With the ongoing challenge of filling winter seasonal operator positions, the loss of current experienced operators could be devastating. Again, safety personnel and employees rose to the task and District 12 experienced minimal loss of operators due to the virus during an especially severe winter season. Our district roadways were kept open and passable in a season which saw many back to back to back snow events.\n\nDistrict 12 has always shown their generosity when it comes to State Employees Combined Appeal (SECA) as well as in other charitable activities. However, this year with the COVID-19 pandemic we knew it would be more challenging to reach our goals, both in employee participation and financial contributions. We also knew the history of District 12 employees being very generous and caring and believed they would continue to support great causes. The challenge was how to logistically motivate everyone without face to face contact and meetings.\n\nA team of employees worked hard at campaigning for SECA. Due to the pandemic restricting personal contact, we had to get creative and spread the word virtually to our employees. We hosted a virtual Employee Recognition and Safety Stand Down Day this fall. During this virtual meeting we took the time to present a SECA PowerPoint and have some of our staff members talk about the importance of SECA. They highlighted examples of charities, and how they have helped local people.\n\nCharities have taken a big hit during this pandemic because they were not able to host large events that raised money. Our employees knew this and were willing to step up and continue to support these charities. I am proud to say that District 12 raised more than $34,000."
