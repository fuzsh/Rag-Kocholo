        "text": "This dataset consists of hourly files of raw IPv4 packets of unsolicited traffic captured by the UCSD Network Telescope instrumentation.\n\nData Description\n\nThis dataset represents raw traffic traces captured by the Telescope instrumentation and made available in near-real time as one-hour long compressed pcap files. We collect more than 3 TB of uncompressed IBR traffic traces data per day. The most recent 14 days of data are stored locally at CAIDA. Once data slides out of ths \"near-real-time window\", the pcap files are off-loaded to a tape storage. This historical Telescope data starting from 2008 are available by additional request.\n\nCaveats that apply to this dataset\n\nThis dataset and the types of worm and denial-of-service attack traffic contained therein are representative only of some spoofed source denial-of-service attacks. Many denial-of-service attackers do not spoof source IP addresses when they attack their victim, in which case backscatter would not appear on a telescope. Attackers can also spoof in a non-random fashion, which will incur an uneven distribution of backscatter across the IPv4 address space, and may cause backscatter traffic to miss any telescope lenses. Note that the telescope does not send any packets in response, which also limits insight into the traffic it sees.\n\nData Access Policy\n\nIn 2021 CAIDA completed an NSF-funded CI-SUSTAIN project \"Sustainable Tools for Analysis and Research on Darknet Unsolicited Traffic\" (STARDUST). NSFâs expectation is that this funding has enabled CAIDA to sustain Telescope data collection, curation, and sharing through users' contributions. We are now undertaking efforts to put in place the mechanisms that allow such contributions. This includes service agreements and data licensing for academic and commercial data use, as well as new data access options. If you are interested in finding more information about the access options and pricing please fill out and submit the CAIDA UCSD Network Telescope Datasets Request Form.\n\nAcceptable Use Agreement\n\nAccess to these data is subject to the terms of the following CAIDA Acceptable Use Agreement\n\nWhen referencing this data (as required by the AUA), please use:\n\nThe CAIDA UCSD Network Telescope Traffic Dataset - <dates used>,\n\nhttps://catalog.caida.org/dataset/telescope_live\n\nYou are required to report your publications using this dataset to CAIDA.\n\nUCSD Network Telescope Datasets\n\nHistorical and Near-Real-Time Network Telescope Dataset\n\nAggregated Traffic Data in FlowTuple format\n\nDaily RSDoS Attack Metadata\n\nTwo Years of Daily RSDoS Attack Metadata (downloadable paper supplement)\n\nAnnotated Anonymized Telescope Packets Sampler\n\nThree Days Of Conficker Dataset\n\nCAIDA UCSD Network Telescope Traffic Samples\n\nWitty Worm Dataset\n\nCode-Red Worms Dataset\n\nPatch Tuesday Dataset\n\nTwo days in November 2008 Dataset\n\nTelescope Educational Dataset\n\nTelescope Dataset on the Sipscan\n\nTelescope Darknet Scanners Dataset\n\nReferences\n\nFor more information about the use of these data in studies of internet censorship, see:\n\nA.
