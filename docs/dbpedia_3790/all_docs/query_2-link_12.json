        "text": "If you are in a collision and no one is hurt, don't wait for the police before moving your vehicle. If you can drive the vehicle, the law requires you to move it out of the flow of traffic.\n\nIf there is damage to the vehicle, stop and exchange information. If someone is hurt, render aid and notify law enforcement. If you hit an unattended vehicle, find the driver or write your name and address on a note explaining what happened. You must also include the owner's name and address if the vehicle you are driving doesn't belong to you.\n\nTexas law requires drivers to have basic liability coverage. If you don't have auto insurance, you can be fined up to $350, or more if you've been ticketed before for no insurance. Be ready to show your insurance card if an officer asks you for it and inform your insurance company of a collision right away."
