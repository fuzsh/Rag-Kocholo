The spreadsheet ​represents the best available spatial data. For some cemeteries that are included in the spreadsheet, the location of the cemetery could not be determined at this time.\n\nIf you plan to visit a cemetery that is located on private property, you must get permission from the landowner. If you plan to visit a cemetery that is located within the boundaries of the Fort Benning, Fort Gordon, or Fort Stewart Military Reservations, you must get permission from that military reservation.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nIdentification and Evaluation of Georgia's Historic Burial Grounds Context and Handbook\n\nThis document was developed by the GDOT Office of Environmental Services to assist people in identifying and evaluating burial grounds for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).\n\nDownload Document\n\nTo view information about GDOT’s Georgia Statewide Cemetery Context Project, visit the Cultural Resources Projects webpage.\n\nHonorarium is the process to acknowledge individuals or groups from Georgia by the Georgia General Assembly for their contributions to the state. The Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) Honorarium Program is currently maintained by the Office of Transportation Data (OTD). Honorariums can be named for Scenic Byways, Trails/Walkways, Interstates, Interchange, an Intersection, a bridge, and an overpass, if available on the primary state route systems of interest. Per OCGA §32-4-3, dedications are limited to the state route system. Therefore, local (county and city) roads and bridges are not eligible for dedication.\n\nThe process requires a “conflict status check” on information provided by the GDOT Legislative Liaison regarding request(s) from members of the Georgia Legislature. Conflict status here refers to whether the area of interest has already been named or is available for naming. Based on the available data on OTD's database, OTD confirms the accuracy and availability of the honorarium naming request. Results of OTD’s research regarding conflict or no conflict status are submitted to the GDOT Legislative Liaison who sends an official GDOT letter to the requesting legislator.\n\nIf you would like to submit an Honorarium request for the 2023-2024 biennium, please complete the form below.\n\nDownload Request Form\n\n​\n\n​\n\nHonorarium ​Locator Application\n\nThis application allows users to view resolutions for the Georgia honorarium. View help if assistance is needed.\n\nAccess Application Watch Tutorial Download Spreadsheet ​​​\n\nNOTE: In accordance with OCGA §32-4-3, road dedications must be introduced and adopted by the General Assembly and enacted by the Governor’s signature. These dedications are limited to roads and bridges on the state route system. GDOT’s role in the dedication process includes reviewing existing records and confirming via a “conflict status” letter if there are any existing dedications previously enacted by the General Assembly or—prior to 2002—adopted by the State Transportation Board and its predecessors. Upon enactment, GDOT will coordinate with dedication sponsors on executing the enacted dedication resolution(s).​​​"
