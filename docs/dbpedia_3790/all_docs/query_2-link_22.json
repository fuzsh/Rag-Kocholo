And when they do, you might be looking at car repairs and injuries as well as possible increases to your insurance premium. Safe driving can go a long way in keeping you and your family safe and your premium in check. Here are seven common car accidents and tips on how to help avoid them:\n\n1. Rear-end collisions\n\nRear-end collisions are a common reason for auto insurance claims. Whether you are the driver who hits a vehicle in front of you or the driver who gets hit by a vehicle behind you, these accidents can often be avoided. Consider these tips:\n\nKeep your distance. Drive far enough behind the car in front of you so you can stop safely. This is especially true in inclement weather. Stay at least three seconds behind the vehicle ahead of you, and longer if you’re in a heavier vehicle. Extend the timing when weather conditions are bad.\n\nDrive strategically. Avoid situations that could force you to suddenly use your brakes. If a driver is following you too closely or isn’t paying attention, you might be rear-ended.\n\nDon’t get distracted. Never take your eyes off the road to eat, read a text message or find your phone. If the driver ahead of you stops suddenly, it only takes a second or less of not paying attention to rear-end their vehicle.\n\nDon’t drive when drowsy or under the influence. You’re more likely to make driving errors when you’re sleepy or impaired by drugs or alcohol.\n\n2. Parked car damage\n\nAnother common cause of auto damage: having a parked vehicle hit by another car. Whether you’re leaving your car in a parking lot or on the road, take steps to help avoid parked car collisions and claims. Here are some suggestions:\n\nGo the distance. Don’t park in the busiest part of a parking lot. Instead, select a space away from heavy traffic. You’ll help reduce your chance of getting hit by another car.\n\nMaximize the space. Always park in the center of a spot. Reposition your vehicle if it’s too close to a parking line. It will help keep your car from being hit by others pulling in to or out of adjacent spots. It can also help prevent dings from swinging doors.\n\nPark in a garage if you can. The idea is to put your car in a safe place when you’re not driving it.\n\nPark street-smart. Try not to park near busy intersections, tight turns and driveways. Other drivers may not see your vehicle and could side-swipe it when passing by.\n\n3. Single-vehicle accidents\n\nSingle-vehicle losses include collisions with road barriers, debris or animals, in addition to rollovers and accidents when driving off-road. It’s not hard to help prevent them.\n\nDrive right for the weather. Even if yours is the only vehicle on the road on a rainy, snowy or icy day, drive at speeds that allow you to maintain control. Learn how to avoid hydroplaning on flooded roads and refresh your winter driving skills before the season begins.\n\nAlways pay attention. Just because you’re the only person on the road doesn’t mean it’s OK to text, make hands-on phone calls or eat while driving. You never know when conditions might change.\n\nDon’t drive too fast. Speeding has been involved in approximately one-third of all motor vehicle fatalities for more than two decades.1 Simply put, speeding is dangerous, even if there is no one else around you.\n\n4. Windshield damage\n\nChips and cracks to vehicle windshields are a common auto accident that many drivers don’t realize they can help prevent. Most windshield damage happens when rocks and stones are thrown up in the air by other vehicles. Help prevent this damage by keeping your distance from cars and trucks.\n\nAlso, don’t drive behind snowplows when they’re dropping salt or other granular substances. Some pieces are large enough to cause chips and cracks.\n\n5. Crashes at intersections\n\nIntersections are another place where accidents frequently occur. Distracted drivers may miss traffic signals changing from green to yellow to red. Or they don’t notice vehicles pausing before making turns.\n\nPractice defensive driving to help avoid accidents. Take a moment after the light turns green to make sure no one is coming through the intersection. Look out for drivers speeding to make it through a yellow light on a cross street. When you’re approaching a yellow light, be cautious and don’t take chances.\n\n6. Parked vehicle theft\n\nNo matter where you park your car, there’s always a chance of a break-in. Still, there are things you can do to help prevent potential unnecessary damage to your vehicle. Keep in mind that items stolen from your vehicle could be a loss that you file under your homeowners insurance coverage. Damage that occurs to your vehicle during a break-in would be filed under your auto insurance coverage.\n\nNever leave valuables in a parked car. Having them in view is an invitation to thieves. Take expensive things with you, store them inside your glove compartment or lock them in the trunk.\n\nNever park in dark locations. Instead, find spaces in well-lit areas. Plan ahead if you’re parking prior to sunset.\n\n7. Backing collisions\n\nWhether you’re backing out of a parking spot or your driveway, accidents can happen.\n\nThe best thing you can do to avoid accidents when backing up is to avoid having to back up in the first place. When possible, park in a way where you won’t have to back up into traffic, such as pulling through or backing into a parking spot.\n\nAnother helpful tip: Drive vehicles that have a backup camera. If your car doesn’t have one, you can have one installed.\n\nIf you drive a car that’s not equipped with a backup camera, here are some other suggestions of what you can do:\n\nBefore getting into your vehicle, look around to assess your surroundings and traffic patterns.\n\nBack out using the shortest, most direct route possible.\n\nReverse in a straight line, turning only when clear of parked vehicles or any other obstructions.\n\nBack out slowly while continuing to check traffic around you.\n\nUse your mirrors and brakes until you’re completely out of the spot and integrated into traffic.\n\nNever do anything distracting while backing out.\n\nWhile there are many things you can do to help prevent collisions, theft, injuries or damage to your vehicle, it’s not always possible to avoid the unexpected. Contact your local independent agent or a Travelers representative to make sure you have appropriate coverage to meet your needs.\n\nSource\n\n1 https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/speeding\n\nTop Stories\n\n10 Tips to Reduce Distracted Driving\n\nFrom stowing your phone to speaking up when you see distracted driving, these tips can help avoid dangerous activity on the road.\n\nRelated products & discounts\n\nComprehensive Coverage\n\nThis covers non-collision-related damage to your vehicle, such as theft, fire or impact with an animal.\n\nCollision Coverage\n\nCollision coverage helps pay for damage to your vehicle if your car hits another car or object, gets hit by another car or if your vehicle rolls over.\n\nMore Prepare & Prevent\n\n3-Second Rule for Safe Following Distance\n\nHelp prevent rear-end collisions by minding the distance between your car and other cars on the road.
