        "text": "Wild animals are forced to cross roads and highways in search of food, water, cover and mates—placing them in the path of our speeding vehicles. Each year, there are roughly 1.5 million vehicle collisions just with deer on U.S. roadways.\n\nHow can I avoid hitting an animal with my car?\n\nFirst and foremost, slow down! Keeping your speed in check gives you a better chance of stopping in time if an animal darts into the road.\n\nFollow speed limits. Many animals are hit simply because people drive too fast to avoid them. Taking it slow makes the roads safer for other drivers and pedestrians, too.\n\nWatch for wildlife in and near the road at dawn, dusk and in the first few hours after darkness. Keep in mind that where there is one animal, there are probably others—young animals following their mother or male animals pursuing a female.\n\nBe especially cautious on two-lane roads bordered by woods or fields, or where streams cross under roads. Most animal/vehicle collisions occur on these roads. Slow down to 45 mph or less.\n\nScan the road as you drive, watching the edges for wildlife about to cross. This will also make you more aware of other hazards such as bicyclists, children at play and slow-moving vehicles.\n\nDon’t throw trash out car windows. Discarded food pollutes the environment and creates a hazard by attracting wildlife to the roads.\n\nUse your high beams whenever possible.\n\nLower your dashboard lights slightly. You'll be more likely to see your headlights reflected in the eyes of animals in time to brake.\n\nTry to drive straight; avoid swerving around wildlife. Instead, try to brake firmly and blow your horn. Animals are easily confused. If you swerve, deer may run into the vehicle rather than away from it. And swerving could mean driving into another vehicle or off the road into poles or fences.\n\nHow can we make roads safer?\n\nEnforce speed limits in areas with deer. The lower the speed, the fewer collisions with deer.\n\nErect fences. One of the most successful techniques for alleviating deer/vehicle collisions is to use fencing to prevent deer from crossing roads.\n\nInstall devices that warn deer of oncoming cars: Streiter Lite® reflectors, which reflect headlights to create an optical illusion of a fence and alert deer to oncoming vehicles, have been reported to reduce deer/vehicle collisions by 60 to 100%; Deer Deter devices alert deer to oncoming vehicles by combining a strobe light effect with ultrasonic high-pitched sounds.\n\nMount motion-activated flashing lights on deer-crossing signs or posts to warn motorists about the presence of deer.\n\nConstruct green bridges or wildlife crossing underpasses to enable wildlife to cross roads without having to negotiate traffic.\n\nHow can I help an injured animal?\n\nSometimes collisions are unavoidable, no matter how careful we are. Here's what to do if you hit an animal or come across an injured one."
