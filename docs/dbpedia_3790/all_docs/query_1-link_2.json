        "text": "Why is it “near” real time tracking?\n\nVerizon Connect provides scalable vehicle and asset tracking using GPS tracking devices that update vehicle locations in our fleet management software as often as every 30 seconds.\n\nEach ping from the GPS tracker also includes in-depth information about the vehicle diagnostic systems or any additional sensors connected to the tracking unit.\n\nThe vehicle location updates occur often enough that fleet managers can be alerted as soon as something out of the ordinary happens, yet still see a clear breadcrumb trail of your vehicle and asset locations.\n\nRespond quickly to fleet issues with alerts\n\nOur near live GPS tracking system and alerts help you see unwanted, fuel-wasting driver behaviors, like speeding, fast acceleration, excessive idle time or entering forbidden locations (geofencing). Near real-time GPS fleet tracking software gives you an extra set of eyes on your vehicles, so you can better manage your time.\n\nNear real-time alerts include activity, idling, geofence, harsh driving, ignition, late start, sensor activation, speeding, towing and video events. Alerts can be configured within our Apple iOS and Android mobile apps."
