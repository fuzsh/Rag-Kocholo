        "text": "In today’s data-driven world, organizations of all sizes should handle and analyze data in real time. From financial institutions to eCommerce companies, real-time processing helps organizations make faster, more informed decisions, improve the customer experience, and optimize operations.\n\nBut for many people, the concept of real-time processing can be confusing and overwhelming. What exactly is real-time processing? How does it work? And how can it benefit businesses?\n\nIf you’re new to real-time processing and want to learn more about it, you’re in the right place. This article will help you understand real-time processing and how it can help your business in today’s data-driven world.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll explain real-time processing and how it can assist your organization.\n\nWe’ll also compare real-time processing with near-real-time and batch processing and describe its real-life applications. After reading this 10-minute guide, you’ll have a solid understanding of real-time processing, its advantages, and the tool that works best for it.\n\nSo let’s dive in.\n\nWhat Is Real-Time Data Processing?\n\nImage Source\n\nReal-time data processing refers to the ability to collect, process, and analyze data as it is generated. This means that data can be processed and made available for use almost instantly. This enables organizations to make decisions quickly and intelligently based on the most recent data available.\n\nTypically, real-time processing is used in situations where data must be processed and made immediately accessible, such as in financial markets, eCommerce solutions, and online gaming.\n\nReal-time processing should not be confused with stream processing. While stream processing refers to the continuous processing of data streams as they are generated, real-time processing refers to the timely processing of input data. Most stream-processing platforms do work in real-time, but not all real-time processing is stream processing.\n\nIn terms of time constraints on data processing, real-time processing can be divided into 3 main types:\n\nHard real-time: Hard real-time systems must always meet deadlines. These systems are frequently utilized in mission-critical applications, such as aviation or healthcare, where a missed deadline could have catastrophic effects. Missed deadlines are seen as system failures.\n\nSoft real-time: Soft real-time systems try to fulfill deadlines most of the time but may miss one without any real consequence. These methods are widely used in video streaming or online gaming when missing a deadline is not important but should be avoided.\n\nFirm real-time processing: Firm real-time systems prioritize completing deadlines over other metrics. These systems are utilized when fulfilling deadlines is more important than data accuracy or system performance. Data delivered after the deadline may be considered invalid but isn’t a system failure.\n\nLet’s now examine how real-time processing functions.\n\nHow Does Real-Time Processing Work?\n\nReal-time processing involves several steps that can change based on the needs of the system and how it is built. But a general outline of how real-time processing works is as follows:\n\na. Data Collection\n\nThe first step in real-time processing is to collect data events as soon as they occur from sensors and devices, other applications, or databases.\n\nb. Data Processing\n\nAs soon as the data has been collected, it is processed and put into a format that other systems or applications can use. Data can be filtered, aggregated, enriched, or transformed.\n\nc. Data Storage\n\nAfter data has been processed, it is often saved in a database so that it can be accessed and analyzed at a later time. This can be a relational database management system (RDBMS), a streaming platform, or an in-memory database optimized for real-time processing. Processed real-time data can also be stored in an analytical data store to be used for historical reporting and analysis.\n\nd. Data Distribution\n\nProcessed and stored data is made available to downstream systems or applications via APIs. This helps organizations access and query data in real time and make prompt, informed decisions.\n\ne. Data Analysis\n\nThis is the final step in real-time processing. It generates insights from the processed data that might drive business activities or decision-making. Machine learning, data visualization, and BI software can be used for this.\n\nReal-Time Processing Vs Near Real-Time Processing Vs Batch Processing\n\nAt this point, you might be wondering if there are any alternatives to real-time processing. The answer is yes. While real-time processing is a powerful and effective data processing approach, it’s not the only one. When developing their data pipelines, data scientists can choose from several different approaches to data processing.\n\nBesides real-time processing, there is also batch processing as well as near real-time processing. These approaches differ in the rates at which data is processed and made available for use, and each has advantages and disadvantages of its own.\n\nWhat Is Near-Real-Time Processing?\n\nNear-real-time processing, also known as “low-latency” processing, involves processing data with a few seconds to a few minutes of delay. In comparison, real-time processing requires a few milliseconds of delay, if any at all.\n\nNear-real-time processing is employed when a business has to handle data quickly, but a delay isn’t critical. Applications where near real-time processing may be suitable include handling online transactions and managing inventory levels.\n\nSome benefits of near-real-time include:\n\nScalable: Near real-time processing is scalable, making it more flexible than real-time processing.\n\nFlexible: Near real-time processing is more flexible as it allows firms to trade off cost and speed as needed.\n\nCost-effective: Depending on the implementation, near-real-time processing can require less infrastructure and computing power and thus be more cost-effective.\n\nWhat Is Batch Processing?\n\nImage Source\n\nBatch processing involves processing data in large groups, or “batches,” rather than individually. Batch processing is best for jobs that don’t need to be done right away. It works well for companies with a lot of data but the results are not time-bound.\n\nApplications, where batch processing can be employed effectively, include:\n\nGenerating invoices\n\nAnalyzing sales data\n\nPreparing financial reports\n\nThe key benefits of batch processing include:\n\nMost cost-effective: Batch processing usually requires less infrastructure and computing power than real-time or near-real-time processing.\n\nEfficiency: Rather than handling incoming data sequentially, batch processing allows businesses to process large amounts of data in parallel.\n\nSimplicity: Batch processing systems are easier to set up and manage than real-time or near-real-time processing since they require less complicated infrastructure.\n\nNow that you are familiar with the fundamentals of real-time processing, near real-time processing, and batch processing, it’s time to focus on their main differences.\n\nUnderstanding The Key Differences Between Real-Time Processing, Near Real-Time Processing, And Batch Processing\n\nWhen determining which technique is best for your company’s requirements, keep the following factors in mind:\n\nA. Latency\n\nLatency is the time needed to process and consume data. It’s an important factor when choosing a data processing method. Of the data-processing approaches discussed, real-time processing has the lowest latency—a few milliseconds or less. It’s perfect for time-sensitive operations.\n\nNear-real-time processing comes in second with a few seconds to a few minutes delay. This is still low latency, and can be used by many applications that need quick results but can deal with a little delay.\n\nBatch processing has the longest latency, which can be up to several hours or even days. This less time-sensitive technique is appropriate for non-time-sensitive processing tasks.\n\nB. Cost\n\nReal-time processing is traditionally the most expensive because of the system’s complexity and necessary infrastructure. To cut down on latency, real-time data processing systems usually need specialized hardware, software, and a high-speed network.\n\nNear-real-time processing is less expensive than real-time processing and provides a balance between cost and latency.\n\nFinally, batch processing is the most cost-effective solution of the three approaches because it requires minimal infrastructure.\n\nFortunately, new advances in real-time and near-real-time technologies are closing the gap in costs, and real-time processing can actually become cost-efficient at scale.\n\nC. Complexity\n\nReal-time, near-real-time, and batch processing differ greatly in terms of system complexities.\n\nReal-time processing requires a hard-to-build software platform to process data in real time. For this method to work, you need a solid engineering team or to enlist the help of a pre-built product or service.\n\nNear-real-time processing is less complex than real-time processing but still requires advanced infrastructure. This strategy strikes a balance between complexity and delay and is used for tasks that can handle a lot of delays.\n\nBatch processing is the least complex method since it processes data in large, predefined groups rather than in real-time or near real-time. It’s easiest for small teams to build and manage from scratch.\n\nD. Use Case\n\nPerhaps the most important deciding factor when selecting the correct data processing approach for your business is the use case.\n\nReal-time processing is the only correct choice for time-sensitive tasks like fraud detection and stock trading. This strategy works effectively when immediate and accurate results are essential.\n\nNear-real-time processing is utilized for activities with a high delay tolerance. This strategy works well for applications like analyzing social media or answering customer service questions, where low latency is nice but not essential.\n\nLastly, batch processing is used for jobs that don’t have to be done right away, like making financial reports and doing sales analysis within a certain time window. This technique works effectively when data correctness is critical but latency isn’t.\n\nNow let’s talk about some of the benefits that businesses can get from using real-time processing.\n\n5 Advantages Of Real-Time Data Processing\n\nImage Source\n\nReal-time processing has a lot of benefits, from improving customer experience to making better business decisions.
