        "text": "​When weather is at its worst, our statewide Winter Level of Service Plan guides us in prioritizing where to send equipment and resources. It's more important than ever to plan ahead:\n\nStay home during ice and snow storms if you can.\n\nLeave early to get ahead of storms.\n\nCarry chains and know how to use them.\n\nHave food, water, medicine and other emergency supplies in your car.\n\nKeep your cell phone charged.\n\nHave a full tank of gas or a full charge on your electric vehicle.\n\nVisit TripCheck.com for up-to-the-minute road conditions and more information on Oregon's chain law requirements.\n\nLevel of service\n\nOur Winter Level of Service Plan establishes anti-icing/de-icing, sanding and plowing priorities for state highways. Priorities are based on safety, the amount of traffic the highways typically carry, and the anticipated impact to commerce and industry.\n\nThere are five Statewide Levels of Service. Highways tagged for high-volume priority service are plowed first; medium and low-volume highways are handled as soon as possible thereafter.\n\nWhen winter weather hits, we'll be on the job. Our goal is to keep roads passable, not completely free of ice and snow. During a one day storm, crews may use approximately 600 trucks full of sand and 150 trucks of de-icer.\n\nClean up\n\nClean up operations begin as bad weather clears. It normally takes 4-8 weeks to remove all the sanding material that was placed on the road.\n\nSand provides significantly improved traction on the roads in both snow and ice. But it spreads everywhere and can be found along the road surfaces and shoulders once the snow and ice are gone.\n\nRock chips are a particular hazard for windshields and bicyclists. We send our ODOT crews out for cleanup as soon as possible, particularly in the lower elevations. In the higher elevations, crews often wait until spring to clean up the sand as we don’t want to clean sand up only to apply a new layer when a new storm arrives soon after.\n\nPractices may vary\n\nOur winter maintenance practices may not reflect the practices used on county or city roadways. Contact your city or county for that information.\n\nIt's illegal to pass a snowplow on the right on state highways. On most Oregon highways, snowplows have “wing” plows that stick out more than eight feet from the right front edge of the truck. The snow being plowed or blown off the road can contain rocks and other debris that can damage vehicles.\n\nDrivers who try to pass on the right when a snowplow is in operation run the risk of damaging their vehicles, hitting the snowplow or running off the road and into a snow bank or guardrail.\n\nDrivers should give winter maintenance vehicles such as plows and sanders a wide berth. They do not travel at high speeds and other vehicles quickly overtake them. Plows and sanding trucks pull over periodically to let traffic pass. The best advice is to stay at least three car lengths behind and give yourself more time to get where you are going.\n\n​\n\nIt's a lot easier to put chains on for the first time when you don't have to struggle to read the instructions alongside a snowy road. Practice installing your chains at home when the weather is fair. Then when road conditions require chains, you'll already know how to use them.\n\nVideo: How to put chains on​\n\nOregon chain law​\n\nMap of chain-up areas\n\nTips on chaining up and driving with chains:\n\nCheck your vehicle operator’s manual for the right type and size of chains to use. Follow the manufacturer’s installation instructions.\n\nEnsure chains are the proper size. Don’t deflate tires to install chains.\n\nDon’t wait until you lose control of your vehicle before chaining up.\n\nPull over to a safe and level area to mount or remove chains.\n\nPull over in a safe place and retighten your tire chains after you have driven a short distance.\n\nPull over and stop immediately if any part of your chain fails or comes loose.\n\nDon’t drive faster than 30 miles per hour when using chains. Accelerate and decelerate slowly. Avoid spinning or locking your wheels.\n\nRemember: you can slide even with chains, so drive carefully and slowly.\n\nStudded Tire Facts\n\nYou can use studded tires in Oregon from Nov. 1 to March 31. Driving with studded tires before Nov. 1 or after March 31 is a Class C violation and carries a presumptive fine of nearly $200.\n\nResearch shows that studded tires are more effective than all-weather tires on icy roads, but are less effective in most other conditions because they may reduce traction between the road and the tire.\n\nDamage from studded tires cost Oregonians approximately $8.5 million a year because roadways required repaving earlier than they normally would be.\n\nWhen it rains, water collects in the pavement ruts caused by studded tires and creates dangerous driving conditions. In cold weather, that water can freeze and cause extra-slippery roads.\n\nAlternatives to studded tires\n\nChains and chain-like devices\n\nChains are more effective than studded tires and are becoming easier to use.\n\nLink chains may not be recommended for use on some types of vehicles; check your owner's manual.\n\nOther traction tires\n\nTraction tires other than studded tires provide increased traction in winter conditions.\n\nThey work about as well as studded tires on ice, but work better than studded tires or regular tires in most other winter conditions.\n\nThese other traction tires cause no more damage to road surfaces than regular tires.\n\nFabric alternatives to chains\n\nFor vehicles that cannot be fitted with tire chains, a potential option is one of the fabric cover products — sometimes called “snow socks” — that slip over your tires. These are an option if you need temporary traction to get out of a snowy spot. They are only intended for short stretches of road in adverse conditions​.\n\nSnow Zones\n\nWhen you see a \"Snow Zone​\" sign as you drive Oregon's highways, pay special attention! These signs provide valuable information during winter months. Snow Zone signs let you know about the current requirements for using chains​ and traction tires. In very bad winter conditions all vehicles may be required to use chains regardless of the type of vehicle or type of tire being used. A conditional road closure may occur on any of Oregon's highways.\n\nKnow Before You Go\n\nVisit www.TripCheck.com, Oregon's travel information website, for up-to-the-minute road conditions and more information on Oregon's chain law and chain requirements​. You can also get the latest in road conditions by calling 511. ​\n\nBridges and overpasses are the most dangerous parts of the road in the winter. They are the first to freeze and the last to thaw because they’re built of concrete, which doesn’t retain as much heat as other materials. Be safe while driving on icy roads by remembering the following:\n\nTurn off your cruise control, be alert and drive cautiously.\n\nRoads that are wet or have fresh snow, packed snow, or ice have varying degrees of traction. Adjust your speed to match road conditions accordingly.\n\nIncrease your distance from vehicles in front of you. Allow about three times as much space as usual.\n\nIf your vehicle suddenly feels like it’s floating, gradually slow down. Tap on your brakes gently; don’t slam on them.\n\nChanges in elevation can drastically affect road and weather conditions. Watch for icy spots, especially in shaded corners.\n\nAvoid driving through snowdrifts — they may cause your vehicle to spin out of control.\n\nBlowing powder or dry snow can limit your visibility, especially when approaching or following trucks or snowplows. Keep your distance to avoid being blinded by blowing snow.\n\nLook for signs of ice on windshield wipers, side view mirrors, road signs, trees or fences. If ice has formed on any of these things, it may be on the road as well.\n\n​\n\nInvisible Danger: Black Ice\n\nBlack ice, also called glare ice or clear ice, is a thin layer of ice on the roadway. Any ice is dangerous to drive on, but black ice is particularly hazardous because the road looks wet, not icy. Black ice isn’t really black; it’s so thin and transparent that the darker pavement shows through. It often has a matte appearance rather than the expected gloss.\n\nOrdinary snow tires are designed for snow, not ice. The most helpful device for gaining traction on ice is tire chains. But even with chains, stopping distance is still several times greater than on dry pavement with ordinary tires.\n\nBlack ice is most common at night and very early in the morning, when temperatures are typically their lowest. It is usually thin enough that it melts soon after sunlight hits it, but it can last much longer on shaded areas of roadways. The ground cools more slowly than the air and warms back more slowly as well, so even if the air temperature is above freezing, the roadway may still be frozen. This discrepancy between temperatures can lull drivers into a false sense of security.\n\n​\n\nDriving at night is more difficult because visibility is reduced. However, low visibility conditions often occur during the day, caused by heavy snowfall, downpours, thick fog and blowing dust or smoke.\n\nTips for driving in low visibility:\n\nSlow down. Every year, \"driving too fast for conditions\" shows up in the top five most common reasons for crashes.\n\nUse your low beams. High beams will disperse in thick fog or snow, making visibility worse for you and other drivers.\n\nTurn on your rear fog lamps, if your vehicle is equipped. They greatly aid visibility for drivers approaching from the rear.\n\nIf you suddenly encounter a severe loss of visibility, pull off the pavement as far as possible. Stop, turn off your lights, set the emergency brake and take your foot off the brake to be sure the taillights are not illuminated. Turn on your emergency flashers.\n\nIf you can't pull off the roadway, slow down, turn on your low beam headlights and sound the horn occasionally. Use the white fog line or roadside reflectors if necessary to help guide you.\n\nNever stop in the travel lanes.\n\n​​\n\nUse Headlights in Winter\n\nTurn on your low-beam headlights during the daytime in the winter months to make your vehicle more visible to other drivers, people on bikes and pedestrians. When natural light is low — at dawn or dusk or when it’s raining, cloudy or snowing — you can improve your vehicle’s visibility significantly. Remember to keep your car headlights clean. Get in the habit of wiping off your lights at the gas station. That way you're ready for low-visibility conditions.\n\nTests conducted by the Society of Automotive Engineers determined that with headlights off, drivers can see oncoming cars when they are an average of 2,074 feet away. With headlights on, that distance more than doubles to an average of 4,720 feet.\n\nTips for Driving in Pacific Northwest Fog\n\nWhen you are driving in fog, slow down to adjust to the reduced visibility. In the most severe situations, a Dense Fog Advisory​ will be issued if visibility is reduced to less than one-quarter mile. Follow these safety tips when driving in Fog:\n\nSlow down and disengage your cruise control.\n\nUse your low beams; high beams will reflect back thick fog, making visibility worse for you and other drivers.\n\nKeep the view clear. Avoid fogged windows by regularly using the defroster and windshield wipers. The air conditioning setting will help keep moisture from building up inside.\n\nIncrease following distance to ensure enough time to stop safely.\n\nUse the right edge of the road, white fog line or roadside reflectors as a guide. Do not change lanes or pass other vehicles unless necessary.\n\nIf you pull off the road, pull over as far as possible, turn off your headlights and turn on your hazard lights.\n\n​​​​\n\n​Landslides are large masses of unstable rock, soil and debris that move down sloped areas. More common are pop outs, smaller quantities of rock, soil and debris that may be a few dozen to a few hundred yards. Landslides and pop outs can be triggered by heavy rain, ongoing erosion, earthquakes or human activity. When there's a landslide on a highway, there may be pavement damage, closed roads, or detours. Landslide cleanup may take some time, especially if the slide is still moving.​\n\nODOT monitors dozens of active landslide areas throughout the state. We use tools to help slow them down, such as clearing ditches and installing pipes and culverts to help drainage during heavy rains, stabilizing the soil with stone columns to pin soil layers together — think of a toothpick holding together a tall sandwich — and installing walls or fences to help hold landslides back from the highway.\n\nHere are some tips to consider:\n\nPlan ahead. When the ground is saturated by rain or snow, especially after a dry spell, know that slides can occur.\n\nBe aware of your surroundings and ready to react should conditions change.\n\nWatch for rocks, water and mud on the road — especially during and after heavy rain. They can be signs of a slide. Watch for collapsed pavement.\n\nIf you can't see the road, don't drive through. Stop, back up, turn on your hazard lights, and call 9-1-1 to report it. Be careful and keep your distance as more may be coming down the hill — or moving from underneath the road.\n\nThe Sno-Park program, established in 1977, helps pay for snow removal in these designated winter recreation parking locations. A list of Sno-Parks are available at TripCheck under the Travel Center​ tab. There are three types of Sno-Park permits:\n\nAn annual permit is $25.\n\nA three-day permit (valid for three consecutive days) is $9.\n\nA one-day permit is $4.\n\nParking in an Oregon Sno-Park without a permit may result in a $30 fine.\n\nSno-Park permits are sold at all DMV offices and by permit agents at many sporting goods stores, winter resorts and other outlets. These sales agents may charge an additional service fee for each permit they sell. For a list of Sno-Park permit vendors, visit the DMV website​.\n\nAnnual permits are also available to purchase online at www.oregondmv.com/dmv2u​. If you buy an annual permit online, a printable interim permit will be email to you immediately. The interim permit may be used for up to 14 days intil you receive the annual permit in the mail.\n\nSno-Park permits issued in California and Idaho are honored in Oregon, and Oregon permits (except for interim annual permists) are honored in those states.​\n\n​Some snow-seekers heading to winter recreation areas via state highways find designated parking areas filled and then create safety issues by parking on roadsides.​\n\nThis parking creates significant safety hazards when people exit their vehicles and walk across the highway to reach their destination. It's also dangerous for vehicles traveling through the area, for emergency vehicles and for snow plows.\n\nTravelers in winter recreation areas should remember to:\n\nSlow down and use all your best winter driving skills, especially in snowy conditions and in the upper elevations.\n\nWatch out for people next to the road. Unexpected snowball fights, sledding and other winter activities often take place dangerously close to the highways.\n\nBe extra alert for snow removal equipment. Vehicles parked at the side of the road prevent plows and other equipment from doing their job.\n\nFind a safe and legal place to park.\n\nExpect extra traffic congestion during high volume holiday weekends.\n\nWe're seeing the problem on major state highways, including U.S. 26 and OR 35 around Mount Hood and OR 372 (Century Drive, south toward Mount Bachelor). This problem is especially concerning on busy freight corridors.\n\nUnder state law, non-emergency parking on state highways, including shoulders, is illegal in areas marked with no parking signs. Violators risk a ticket and a tow.\n\nParking is allowed in designated areas, such as Sno-Parks. Oregon has about 100 Sno-Park sites dedicated to winter recreation parking. The sites can be found throughout the state in all mountain passes and at most recognized ski, snowmobile and snow play areas.\n\nA list of Oregon's Sno-Parks is available at TripCheck.com under Travel Center.\n\nIf you approach an intersection with signal lights either flashing or out, it’s important to follow basic rules to keep yourself and other drivers safe:\n\nTreat the intersection as an all-way stop: Come to a full stop. Look both ways for other traffic and pedestrians. Once it's safe, drive cautiously through the intersection.\n\nIf there is other traffic, common courtesy requires that the driver who stops first goes first.\n\nIf in doubt, yield to the driver on your right.\n\nBe alert at railroad crossings. Power outages also can also affect railroad crossings. Railroad crossing signals have built-in backup battery power and should continue to operate for a short time during power outages. During a long-term power outage or other problem, railroad-crossing arms will automatically move to the “down” position. Railroad companies have standard procedures for these situations. Never drive around railroad-crossing arms in the down position. A train may be coming.\n\nUse your headlights for tunnels and bridges. It may be more difficult to see tunnel entrances and bridge approaches if there is a power outage. Use your headlights whenever there is reduced visibility and use caution.\n\nThe state highway is not a good place to deposit snow from your driveway. In fact, it’s against the law to deposit any object onto Oregon highways and highway right of way, including snow.\n\nPlacing driveway snow on the road or shoulder creates a hazard for other highway users and for our snowplow operators. Chunks of snow and ice form an uneven road surface that can surprise drivers and cause crashes.\n\nWhen snowplows create berms of snow at the end of driveways, we ask property owners to help by shoveling that snow to the sides of their driveways, rather than back onto the road or shoulder.\n\nIf you shovel snow onto the roadway, you will be asked to clear it away. Or we may remove the snow and bill you for the cost of doing so. In addition, you may be cited under Oregon law; violations are punishable as a misdemeanor.​"
