        "text": "Application Areas\n\nTraffic Management\n\nDescription\n\nThis center-to-center application area covers the interface between a traffic management center and other centers and supports the following capabilities:\n\nExchanging near real-time traffic data and control information to support a regional traffic management strategy.\n\nProviding information to maintenance and construction operations for the efficient management of maintenance activities.\n\nProviding near real time traffic information for use by traveler information providers (organizations that provide traveler information directly to the traveling public) and other centers such as emergency management, transit management, maintenance and construction management, and the media. Traffic and incident information collected by the media is collected by the traffic management center.\n\nDeveloping a view of potential incidents by acquiring event information from other centers.\n\nThe extent to which information and control are shared between centers is determined through working arrangements among agencies or jurisdictions.\n\nNational ITS Architecture Interface\n\nThis application area focuses on the distribution of road network information by the Traffic Management Subsystem (TMS) to other centers. The TMS disseminates current and forecasted traffic information to EM, ISP, MCMS, TRMS, and the Media, as well as to Traffic Management Subsystems in neighboring jurisdictions to ensure efficient and effective management of various traffic situations. Coordinating information is exchanged between Traffic Management Subsystems to allow remote control of another center's field devices. The TMS also gathers information from the Media and Event Promoters via center-to-center interfaces. Finally, this application area includes an interface to report HOV lane violations.\n\nApplicable Standards\n\nIn general, the following standards are applicable to Traffic Management deployments. To determine which specific standards are applicable for a deployment you will need to determine which architecture flows will be needed for the Traffic Management piece of your deployment.
