        "text": "Focus on Driving\n\nAvoid activities such as talking on the phone, texting, eating, and personal grooming. Staying focused will help you see potential problems in time to properly respond or avoid them.\n\nStay Alert\n\nStaying alert while driving allows you to respond quickly to potential problems – such as a child running into the street or a driver slamming on their brakes in front of you. Your judgment and response time can be adversely affected by simple daydreaming as well as from doziness or being under the influence of alcohol or drugs (including over-the-counter and prescription drugs). Take responsibility by getting adequate rest and refraining from substances that will affect your ability to respond in a timely manner.\n\nMaintain an Appropriate Speed\n\nFollowing the posted speed limit is fine while road conditions are clear; however, it is up to you to ensure your speed matches conditions. Slow down to maintain control of your vehicle, particularly if the road is wet or if other risky conditions are present.\n\nBe Aware of Other People on the Road\n\nYou are less likely to be caught off guard if you pay attention to other people on the road and anticipate their actions. Paying attention and anticipating what other drivers may do will help you adjust accordingly. Don’t assume other drivers will see and accommodate your vehicle – anticipate the worse-case scenario and be prepared to respond.\n\nMaintain a Safe Following Distance\n\nKeep at least three to four seconds of distance between you and the vehicle in front of you – increase this distance in bad weather or if following a large truck or motorcycle. Maintaining a safe distance helps give you adequate time to brake to a stop if necessary to avoid a collision.\n\nDon’t be Overconfident\n\nIt is easy for someone who has had a lot of driving experience to become overconfident in their abilities and allow their driving skills to become sloppy. No matter how much driving experience you have, you could be the cause of an accident by allowing yourself to become distracted behind the wheel."
