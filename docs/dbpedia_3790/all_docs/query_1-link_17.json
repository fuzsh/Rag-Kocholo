Metrics such as Online show the number of agents currently online in real-time, updating every 15 seconds. Metrics such as Handled and Abandoned reflect near real-time values for your contact center.\n\nYou can customize the reports, specify a time range for each report, select metrics for each report, and select filters for data to include or exclude from each report.\n\nYou can also use the Amazon Connect Service APIs to create custom reports, such as real-time reports that are filtered by teams of agents.\n\nThanks for letting us know we're doing a good job!\n\nIf you've got a moment, please tell us what we did right so we can do more of it.\n\nThanks for letting us know this page needs work. We're sorry we let you down.\n\nIf you've got a moment, please tell us how we can make the documentation better."
