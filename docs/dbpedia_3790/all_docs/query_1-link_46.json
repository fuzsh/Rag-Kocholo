        "text": "–\n\nRapid innovation and globalization have generated tremendous opportunities and choices in the marketplace for firms and customers. Competitive pressures have led to sourcing and manufacturing on a global scale resulting in a significant increase in products. The paper tries to identify the need for real time business intelligence (BI) in supply chain analytics.\n\n–\n\nThe paper focuses on the necessity to revisit the traditional BI concept that integrates and consolidates information in an organization in order to support firms that are service oriented and seeking customer loyalty and retention. Enhancing effectiveness and efficiency of supply chain analytics using a BI approach is a critical component in a company's ability to achieve its competitive advantage."
