        "text": "This chart outlines state distracted driving laws. Some localities have additional regulations. Enforcement type is also noted.\n\nHandheld Cellphone Use: 30 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands prohibit all drivers from using handheld cellphones while driving. All but Alabama and Missouri are primary enforcement laws — an officer may cite a driver for using a handheld cellphone without any other traffic offense taking place.\n\nAll Cellphone Use: No state bans all cellphone use for all drivers, but 36 states and D.C. ban all cellphone use by novice drivers, and 25 states and D.C. prohibit it for school bus drivers.\n\nText Messaging: Washington was the first state to pass a texting ban in 2007. Currently, 49 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands ban text messaging for all drivers. All but six have primary enforcement.\n\nCrash Data Collection: All states except two (Connecticut and New Hampshire) include at least one category for distraction on police crash report forms, although the specific data collected varies.\n\nPreemption Laws: Some states have preemption laws that prohibit local jurisdictions from enacting their own distracted driving bans. States with such laws include — but may not be limited to — Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Oregon and South Carolina.\n\nNOTE: GHSA does not compile any additional data on distracted driving laws other than what is presented here. For more information, consult the appropriate State Highway Safety Office.\n\nSources: Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and State Highway Safety Offices (SHSOs).\n\nLast updated in June 2024. Laws last reviewed by SHSOs in March 2024."
