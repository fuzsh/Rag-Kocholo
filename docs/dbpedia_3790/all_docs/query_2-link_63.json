        "text": "The Condition Acquisition Reporting System (CARS) is the platform where data is collected to support 511IN.org. The CARS POLICY was enacted to create awareness of restrictions and closures of shoulders, ramps, and lanes, and other activities within INDOT’s right-of-way as they affect the motoring public’s safety and mobility. The CARS POLICY applies to anyone working on the INDOT right-of-way and anyone responsible for maintaining CARS data. CARS is the reporting platform and one of the tools used by INDOT’s Traffic Management, Freight Management (for the purpose of managing oversize and overweight permits), Construction Management, Operations, Design, and other third parties to operate, manage, and plan activities that occur on Indiana’s highways and to create awareness with the motoring public. These stakeholders require CARS data that is both timely and accurate. The CARS POLICY provides the procedures, rules, and reporting requirements for CARS. This policy also provides Traffic Management Center (TMC) reporting requirements associated with these activities."
