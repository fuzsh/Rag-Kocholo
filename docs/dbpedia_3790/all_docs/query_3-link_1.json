        "text": "Traffic reporting refers to the collection of traffic information for Wikimedia content then processing that data in some way to present a meaningful insight.\n\nSomeone might be interested in discussing the extent to which Wikipedia is a popular source of information about a set of topics. To introduce data into the discussion, they might collect pageview data on a set of Wikipedia articles, then present a report that says, \"These 20 articles had 1,000,000 pageviews in the past month.\" That information might provide insight about whether developing Wikipedia articles is a useful way to share information as compared to other communication strategies.\n\nSomeone might share images in Wikimedia Commons, then be curious about how many people view those images. They might collect pageview data for images that interest them, then use that information as a basis for thinking about how useful it is to spend time sharing images in Wikimedia projects.\n\nWeb traffic - the attention that readers give to particular online media. People who communicate online typically want more web traffic from more relevant audiences, and they might want the audience to respond in a particular way. There is no standard way to measure or report web traffic. Different websites report traffic in different ways. The Wikimedia community has its own standards and customs for discussing traffic, as does every other online community and website.\n\nPageview - a user request for a Wikimedia page or file. Pageview is the standard measure for reporting web traffic for any Wikipedia article. One pageview represents one user request for an article.\n\nUnique user - a single count per person who uses a web service. Many web traffic reports include a report of unique users. For privacy reasons, Wikimedia projects are designed to technically avoid collecting this common traffic reporting metric.\n\nEnd user - a person who will use a tool or process. Often \"end user\" is used to refer to a person with no technical background or special training, and who will use a tool in the manner of a typical person\n\nThe Pageviews Analysis tool is the most basic tool available for giving pageview reports on Wikipedia articles to typical Wikimedia community members. If given the title of a Wikipedia article and a date range, this tool reports how many pageviews that article got in that range. You can enter up to 10 pages for comparison.\n\nPageviews Analysis - this is the tool\n\nCommunity Tech/Pageview stats tool - Development of the tool was advanced following the 2015 Community Wishlist Survey, and this page reports the work responding to that survey\n\nTypical Wikipedia users access this tool by starting at any Wikipedia article, clicking \"view history\" in the top menu, then clicking \"page view statistics\". Doing this generates a report for the past 20 days for that article; the reporting period can be adjusts back to the most recent of the date of creation of the article and 2015-07-01, when data collection for this tool began.\n\nAnyone who wants a quick traffic report of up to 10 Wikipedia articles may use this tool. It has a range of options for providing variations in the information it reports.\n\nMusikAnimal established the tool.\n\nThe Massviews Analysis tool is the most basic tool available for giving pageview reports on over 10 Wikipedia articles to typical Wikimedia community members. If given a list of titles of Wikipedia articles and a date range, this tool reports how many pageviews each of those articles have in that range.\n\nMassviews Analysis - this is the tool\n\nHere are the steps for using this tool with PagePile:\n\nIdentify a set of Wikipedia articles for which pageview reports are desired\n\nUse another tool, called \"Page Pile\", to create a list naming each article in that set\n\nPage Pile\n\nCreate new pile\n\nCollect the identification number for the Page Pile - this number can be used as input for various tools that generate various reports\n\nInput the Page Pile identification number into Massviews, along with a date range\n\nThe output is a report of pageview traffic for multiple articles\n\nMusikAnimal established the tool.\n\nVardi, Elad; Muchnik, Lev (2017). \"WikiShark Wikipedia traffic statistics\". www.wikishark.com.\n\nWikiShark is a tool notable for providing access to Wikipedia traffic since 2008.\n\nWikipedia Tools for Google Spreadsheets is a set of tools to provide data and analyze data about sets of Wikipedia articles.\n\nWikipedia Tools for Google Spreadsheets - see documentation on Meta\n\nThe tool is provided by Tomayac.\n\nWikipediaviews.org is a tool for presenting pageview information. If given a list of titles of Wikipedia articles and a date range, this tool reports how many pageviews each of those articles got in that range.\n\nwikipediaviews.org\n\nThe tool is provided by Vipul.\n\nStats.grok.se, also known as \"Henrik's tool\", was a pageview reporting tool which was a predecessor to the Pageviews Analysis tool and was accessed in the same way. The tool was the only common way for end users of Wikipedia to access pageview information from January 2008 to early 2016, when software changes broke the tool.\n\nThis tool is no longer functional. It was uniquely influential in guiding Wikipedia traffic discussions for the entirety of its working existence.\n\nen:User:Killiondude/stats - an FAQ for the tool\n\nThe tool was provided by Henrik.\n\nWikimedia Commons is a Wikimedia repository for non-text media files, most commonly images. Most images in other Wikimedia projects are actually hosted in Wikimedia Commons. For example, most images in any Wikipedia are stored in Commons, and any image in Commons might be reused in multiple Wikipedias for different languages.\n\nAnyone who shares or curates files in Wikimedia Commons might wish to track how many views a file is getting. Files in Commons are typically viewed outside of Commons, like for example, in a Wikipedia article, and not in the Commons file cataloging system. Because of this, counts for views to Commons files typically include pageview reports for Wikipedia articles containing those files.\n\nGLAMorgan is a tool which generates reports of pageviews of Wikipedia articles which contain all of the files in any given Wikimedia Commons category.\n\nGLAMorgan\n\nSee wikitech:Analytics/Data/Mediacounts for the data on actual downloads for files and methods to use the data.\n\nWeb traffic reporting is useful for anyone who needs information about the popularity, use, and impact of content on Wikipedia.\n\nCommunications professionals are the most likely demographic to be the most interested in investing time to track and consider web traffic reports. Data scientists, communication researchers, and anyone with a general interest in the present state of communication might be interested in this data.\n\nTypically web traffic data is collected with the intent to compare it to other, similar traffic data reports. For example, someone might collect Wikipedia web traffic data, and then collect communication data on the traffic to another website or communication platform, then compare the traffic numbers. The comparison of traffic reports provides insight and justification for making decisions about labor investments in communicating through different channels.\n\nWeb traffic data from Wikimedia projects is a way to measure and describe the popularity of Wikimedia projects as an information source. For many topics in many languages, Wikimedia projects host information resources which are extremely popular or the most popular sources of information for that topic. If an individual or organization has supporting evidence which establishes that Wikipedia is a popular source of information for their field of interest, then that individual or organization might respond by engaging with the Wikimedia community and Wikimedia projects to collaborate in sharing information.\n\nn:template:Popular articles provides number of hits for top 20 articles of the hour on wikinews.\n\nRaw about consultation data is made available by Domas Mituzas. Files can be found here. One compressed file is created every hour and contains counts of every requests of a page from Wikipedia and other related projects. This data also contains pages which do not actually exist, and is not processed: for example, redirected pages are counted separately, as are pages accessed using different encodings.\n\nThe data is stored in files such as pagecounts-20100412-170000.gz, indicating the date (12 April 2010) and hour (1700). Each line in the file follows the following format:\n\nen White_lead 9 122588 en White_lie 2 138038 en White_lies 3 18907 en White_light 2 45042 en White_light_scanner 1 7881 en White_lion 9 152551\n\nwhere the four fields correspond to\n\nthe project code\n\nthe article name\n\nthe number of hits\n\nthe total of bytes transferred\n\nThe project code is also to be interpreted as:\n\nen.b for Wikibooks\n\nen.d for Wikidictionary\n\nen.m for Wikipedia mobile\n\nen.m.b for Wikibooks mobile\n\necc.\n\nThe Kiwix project provides a few tools to download and merge these usage stats. They are available here:\n\nget_hourly_charts.sh updates a local directory with the new remote usage stats.\n\nget_daily_charts.sh merges and cumulates the stats over a day. It removes the hour based files.\n\nget_monthly_charts.sh merges and cumulates the stats over a month. It removes the day based files.\n\nTo get merged, cumulated and consequently smaller log files, simply call periodically these three scripts with the directory where you want to store the logs as first and only argument.\n\nFiles are available at dumps.wikimedia.org.\n\nSee w:en:User:Emijrp/Wikipedia Archive#Domas visits logs.\n\nDaily user pageviews for all local Wikipedies (assembled by Dušan Kreheľ, separately local Wikipedies, format d0cmf, from 2015-07) are stored on archive.org (link)."
