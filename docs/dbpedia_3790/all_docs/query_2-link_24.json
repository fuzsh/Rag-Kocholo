        "text": "Speeding is a significant aggressive driving behavior and is estimated to be a contributing factor in over one-third of all fatal crashes nationwide. The probability of death or serious injury grows with impacts at higher speeds—doubling for every 10 MPH over 50 MPH that a vehicle travels.\n\nSlow Down\n\nSpeeding endangers everyone on the road. It’s a problem that we all need to address. Speeding rarely results in any noticeable difference in how quickly you arrive at your destination. It’s better to give yourself a few extra minutes to get to where you’re going than to speed.\n\nPosted speed limits are set assuming ideal weather and traffic conditions. However, bad weather, areas of road work, and other factors may require motorists to drive below the posted speed limit.\n\nSlow down. Speeding won’t get you where you’re going any quicker – it will only increase your chances of not getting there at all."
