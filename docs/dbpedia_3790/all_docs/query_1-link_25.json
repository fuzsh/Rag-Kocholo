        "text": "Provision of accurate traffic information in real time is essential for every Intelligent Transport System (ITS) development. With growing number of stakeholders involved in the ITS, it becomes a necessity to establish robust and reliable system for immediate traffic report notification for either all, or targeted groups of ITS users. The fact that communications make gradual transition towards the Internet Protocol (IP)-based systems offers an opportunity to exploit the existing IP-related signalling/notification mechanisms for possible deployment in ITS. Here we present the concept of utilisation of the Really Simple Syndication (RSS) and Geospatial RSS (GeoRSS) in provision of near-real-time notification and distribution of the latest traffic information, based on the Traffic Information System as a system for continuous traffic situation awareness monitoring. The GeoRSS-based system for traffic information syndication monitors the release of the latest traffic information report (provided by Traffic Information System), and notifies subscribers in targeted geospatial zone about them. Using proposed communication protocol and a dedicated client installed in vehicle, driver is automatically and immediately provided with the latest traffic information related to the road segment in current use in the user-friendly form (preferably voice, but the addition of a dedicated geospatial data layer for vehicle navigation device is an option). The utilisation of the GeoRSS protocol allows for geospatial filtering, thus reducing the amount of data traffic. Mobile internet is a communication back-bone, with end-users allowed to choose the most appropriate option for network access. Proposed concept is validated using a simple research prototype, comprehensively presented in this paper. Performance of GeoRSS-based traffic information distribution system is discussed, providing an outlook in contribution to situation awareness enhancement and the range of possible applications. The paper concludes with an outline of existing syndication-for-ITS opportunities, and the plans for further developments.\n\nCorporate Authors:\n\nITS Japan\n\nTokyo, Japan\n\nITS America\n\n1100 17th Street, NW, 12th Floor\n\nWashington, DC United States 20036\n\nERTICO\n\n326 Avenue Louis\n\nBrussels, Belgium B-1050\n\nAuthors:\n\nFiljar, Renato\n\nVidovic, Kresimir\n\nDrilo, Boris\n\nSaric, Dinko\n\nDadic, Ivan\n\nSevrovic, Marko\n\nZupanovic, Dino\n\nConference:\n\n17th ITS World Congress\n\nLocation: Busan , Korea, South\n\nDate: 2010-10-25 to 2010-10-29\n\nPublication Date: 2010\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish\n\nMedia Info\n\nMedia Type: DVD\n\nFeatures: Figures; References;\n\nPagination: 10p\n\nMonograph Title: 17th ITS World Congress, Busan, 2010: Proceedings\n\nSubject/Index Terms\n\nTRT Terms: Driver information systems; Intelligent transportation systems; Real time information; Traffic data; Traffic flow\n\nIdentifier Terms: Really Simple Syndication\n\nUncontrolled Terms: Geospatial data\n\nSubject Areas: Data and Information Technology; Highways; I70: Traffic and Transport;\n\nFiling Info"
