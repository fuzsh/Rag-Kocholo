These robots also provide flexibility in neutralizing unexploded ordnance (UXO) and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), both physically with a manipulator arm, and visually via multiple camera images presented through the OCU tablet.\n\nUnmanned Surface Vehicle - 1\n\n(USV-1)\n\nA radio controlled surface boat with SONAR, bathymetric sensors, and other detection means for locating potential obstacles in littoral areas during amphibious operations. Used by USMC EOD Technicians (EOD Companies within Engineer Support Battalions). USMC EOD Technicians manage the day to day operation of the system. No Memoranda of Understanding or Agreement are in place for the USV-1. USV-1 is part of the Littoral Explosive Ordnance Neutralization Family of Systems: ROV, UUV, and AUGV are the other components in the Family of Systems. The USV-1 is directed to sweep over Littoral waters to scan for underwater mines and other obstacles, which the EOD Technicians will then neutralize the threat. USMC; potential for future use by USN. The USV-1 is mission essential because without it, the speed with which USMC EOD Technicians can locate potential threats will increase exponentially, putting the Amphibious Forces at risk.\n\nVehicle Automated Diagnostic System\n\n(VADS)\n\nVADS is a man-portable, diagnostic system of modular design that is used to perform intrusive diagnostics on diesel engines, transmissions, central tire inflation systems, and other mechanical, electrical and hydraulic systems via an Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) using the vehicle data bus as well as embedded vehicle sensors and probes provided as part of the VADS system. The VADS will perform testing and diagnostics of legacy, newly fielded, and future engineer, motor transport, and ordnance equipment to the fullest extent practical.\n\nUnmanned Surface Vehicle - 1 (USV-1)\n\nA radio controlled surface boat with SONAR, bathymetric sensors, and other detection means for locating potential obstacles in littoral areas during amphibious operations.

The primary mission of DLA Transaction Services is to use the Defense Automatic Addressing System (DAAS) to receive, edit, validate, route, and deliver logistics transactions for the Department of Defense (DoD) Components and Participating Agencies; to provide value-added services for numerous logistics transactions, such as network and data interoperability, DoD level logistics information services, and report generation. DLA Transaction Services serves as the DoD translator which allows the DoD Component and Participating Agency systems to speak the same language by receiving data, often non-standard, editing and validating the transactions, and forwarding the transactions, in the correct format, to the proper destination. DLA Transaction Services maintains two sites that operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Mission essential applications run in parallel at both sites. The number of DAAS interfaces is too great to list in the 'Range of number of interfaces to other systems?' and the 'Associated System' fields; the number of interfaces exceeds 1200. The using components include DLA, DOD, Federal Agencies, State Government, and commercial users. There is a NIPRNET and a scaled down SIPRNET version of this system.\n\nDefense Property Accountability System\n\n(DPAS)\n\nDPAS DoD property management system.
