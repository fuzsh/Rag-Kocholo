        "text": "Edge computing is cutting-edge technology that is transforming the way we process data in digitally networked ecosystems. But exactly what is edge computing and why is edge computing important? Edge computing brings processing power closer to the source of data, rather than sending it to a centralized location. As the world becomes more connected and the amount of data generated continues to grow, edge computing is poised to play an increasingly important role in shaping the future of technology. This blog provides an introduction to edge computing, the benefits of edge computing and some examples on industry applications of edge computing.\n\nWhat is edge computing?\n\nEdge computing refers to the practice of processing data closer to where it is generated, rather than sending it to a central location for processing. This means that data is processed in real time, without the need for a high-speed internet connection. Increasingly, the proliferation of connected, Internet of Things (IoT) devices is why edge computing is important. With so much data being generated by these devices, it’s not practical to send all the data to a central location for processing. Edge computing allows for faster, more efficient processing of data, which in turn can lead to better decision-making and improved performance.\n\nEdge computing works by using mainly small, low-power devices called “edge devices.” These edge devices are located close to data sources and connected to a network, which allows them to communicate with each other and with the cloud. When data is generated, it’s processed by an edge device, which can then send the processed data to the cloud for further analysis. This process is much faster than sending all of the data to the cloud for processing, which can take a long time and require a lot of bandwidth. Edge computing will not replace cloud computing. Rather, edge computing aims to push some of the cloud’s processing power and storage capacity closer to devices that produce and consume the data. Therefore it extends today’s cloud capabilities to a seamless hybrid computing environment.\n\nAs we explore the possibilities that edge computing offers the world by bringing data storage and processing power closer to data source devices, one possibility includes multi-access edge computing (MEC). Multi-access edge computing is a specific implementation of edge computing for wireless communication networks, such as 4G or 5G. Multi-access edge computing focuses on deploying edge computing capabilities at base stations or access points, enhancing network performance and delivering low-latency services to wireless communication users. Such implementation concepts, like the MEC for telecommunications, play more and more a significant role in various industries, including healthcare, transportation and smart cities. Thereby it enables new edge-based services and applications, such as video analytics for real-time surveillance, low-latency analytic services or intelligent autonomous logistics.\n\nWhat are the benefits of edge computing?\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of edge computing is its ability to reduce latency. By processing data closer to the source, edge computing can significantly reduce the time it takes to transmit data to the cloud. With edge computing, data is processed locally on devices or servers at the edge of the network, rather than being sent to a central data center for processing. This means that data can be processed in real time, without the latency that comes with sending data back and forth to a central location. This is particularly important for businesses that rely on real-time data analysis, such as those in the healthcare and finance industries, as well as applications that require real-time data processing, such as autonomous vehicles and industrial automation.\n\nAnother benefit of edge computing is its ability to enhance security, because sensitive data can be processed and stored locally instead of being sent to a central location where it may be more vulnerable to cyber attacks. By processing data locally, edge computing can reduce the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks.\n\nAdditionally, edge computing can help businesses reduce network congestion and bandwidth costs by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the network and to the cloud.\n\nEdge computing is a powerful technology and a compelling option for businesses looking to improve their data processing capabilities. Take advantage of three key benefits that edge computing offers:\n\nLatency reduction\n\nEnhanced security\n\nCost savings on bandwidth\n\nOverall, edge computing is a useful technology for optimizing web apps and connected devices by securely minimizing bandwidth usage and latency. With that it has a big impact on both security and sustainability requirements of new IT/OT system landscapes.\n\nEdge computing benefits for IT security\n\nWhen it comes to edge computing, security is an important consideration that cannot be overlooked. As more and more devices are connected to the internet, the risk of cyber attacks increases and the importance of cyber security for businesses cannot be underestimated. Edge computing has the potential to reduce the strain on network infrastructure and improve security by keeping sensitive data closer to the source. Edge computing, which involves processing data closer to the source rather than in a centralized location, can help mitigate some of these risks by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the internet.\n\nHowever, to implement edge computing, it is important to ensure that edge devices and networks are secure through measures such as encryption, access controls and regular software and firmware updates. Additionally, it is important to have a plan in place for responding to security incidents, as well as to regularly test and evaluate the security of edge computing systems. By taking these steps, organizations can harness the powerful benefits of edge computing while minimizing cyber security risks.\n\nEdge computing benefits for sustainability\n\nEdge computing has the potential to improve sustainability across every industry.
