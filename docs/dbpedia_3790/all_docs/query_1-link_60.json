        "text": "O-RAN compliant RAN programmability with near-real-time RIC\n\nThe near-real time RIC allows external control applications, xApps, to control aspects of the 5G radio network through installed control applications. xApps can come from multiple sources and provide many benefits. There are several use case scenarios for the xApps, such as:\n\nAutomated AI/ML based network optimization xApps\n\nUse-case specific RAN customization e.g. Enterprise specific RAN adaptation\n\nInnovation in the RAN e.g. introduction of Service Awareness\n\nNokia is committed to lead the open mobile future\n\nAn open and programmable Radio Access Network (RAN) enables many new capabilities to be introduced for 5G networks. Furthermore, it fosters innovation by supporting the introduction of advanced capabilities such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that can automatically optimize the network. Nokia is investing in Open RAN (O-RAN) and Cloud RAN capabilities to enable a robust telecom ecosystem with strong network performance and security.\n\nWorld´s first RAN Intelligent Controller trials in commercial networks\n\nNokia and AT&T are leading the O-RAN Software Community’s effort to create an open source base code for the RIC. Successful limited live trials with multiple RIC applications (xApps) at the edge of AT&T’s commercial 5G network have proven the concept of deploying external AI/ML logic to augment base station functions, without interrupting the live commercial network.\n\nNokia is actively engaging with major operator and research groups globally with Proofs of Concept, trials and development of the open and programmable RAN, which will enable many new capabilities for 5G network."
