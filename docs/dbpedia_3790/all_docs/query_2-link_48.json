        "text": "It is illegal to drive over the speed limit as deemed “safe” by reasonable regard to traffic conditions. Driving over the speed limit at any rate can be extremely dangerous to the driver, passengers, and others on the road.\n\nAlthough it may not always be top of mind on a routine outing, it is important to pay attention to your speed on the road. Speeding can not only result in crashes but the driver or responsible party can also face serious legal consequences.\n\nWhy Is Speeding Dangerous?\n\nSpeeding is one of the most dangerous things you can do while driving a vehicle. Driving too fast makes you more likely to hit another car or pedestrian, gives you less control while driving, and increases the severity of any resulting collision.\n\nThe dangers of speeding include:\n\nIncreased occurrence of rollover accidents\n\nIncreased potential for loss of control as a driver\n\nHigher severity of crash if an accident does occur\n\nIncreased distance needed to stop a vehicle safely\n\nReduced reaction time\n\nPossible failure to yield, resulting in an accident\n\nSpeeding not only refers to driving over the posted speed limit. Speeding can also include other behaviors, such as driving too fast for road conditions like rain or ice or driving carelessly through construction zones.\n\nIn addition to the dangers of speeding that result in accidents, speeding can also lead to frequent speeding tickets and points on your license, increased insurance rates, increased wear and tear on your vehicle, and increased fuel costs.\n\nSpeeding Facts\n\nSpeeding accidents happen all around our country, and Indiana is no different. Speeding problems can and do happen everywhere. That’s why it’s so important for every driver on the road to be aware of their speed and the speed of those around them to lessen the consequences of speeding in Indiana and the U.S. as a whole.\n\nHere are some speeding statistics to consider when on the road. Many of these statistics are taken from the latest Indiana Crash Facts Book Report.\n\nThere were a total of 11,258 speeding-related deaths in the United States in 2020.\n\nSpeeding is the cause of nearly one-third (⅓) of all fatalities involving car or vehicle accidents.\n\nIn Indiana specifically, there were 20,200 speed-related collisions in 2019.\n\n26.3% of fatal collisions in Indiana were speed-related in 2019.\n\n15,926 speed-related collisions resulted in some sort of property damage in Indiana.\n\n12,079 collisions happened in Indiana due to drivers speeding too fast for weather conditions.\n\nMotorcycles and mopeds were some of the most affected vehicles involved in speed-related collisions in Indiana at 10.9%.\n\nOf those speeding in Indiana collisions, 700 of those drivers were found to be intoxicated.\n\nAccording to the National Safety Council, 45% of fatalities in which speeding was a factor happened on roads with water on them in 2020.\n\nWhy Do Drivers Speed?\n\nMany people speed, often for reasons unrelated to aggressive behavior. Some reasons why drivers speed include traffic congestion, running late, as well as simple disregard for the law.\n\nTraffic\n\nFrustration while driving through heavy traffic can increase a driver’s aggressiveness and result in speeding. Drivers frustrated by traffic tend to change lanes frequently or express road rage toward other drivers.\n\nRunning Late\n\nIt’s never good when you look at the clock and realize it’s 15 minutes past when you were originally supposed to leave. This happens to the best of us, often making individuals want to drive faster in order to try to make up time on the road. Running late for work, meetings, school, appointments, or other activities is common and can be a big factor in why drivers speed. Plus, when worrying about being late, a driver can be more easily distracted since their mind is on places other than the road in front of them.\n\nDisobeying the Law\n\nMany drivers speed without showing any signs of aggressiveness or road rage. Speeding can simply be a result of not wanting to drive according to the law due to one’s own personal agenda or desire to get somewhere quicker.\n\nDistracted Driving\n\nBlatant unawareness of the speed at which people are driving is a large factor in speeding. Whether it’s thinking about where they’re going, talking to a passenger in the car, or any other form of distracted driving, a driver may not even realize how fast they are going until it’s too late.\n\nOther Reasons Why People Speed\n\nEven if not everyone knows the specific dangers of speeding, everyone knows not to speed. So, why do people still do it? There are many reasons why, and identifying the reason for speeding in the moment is the first step to stopping the risky behavior:\n\nUnawareness of the speed limit\n\nThe desire to drive fast in a certain type of car (think Mustang or Ferrari)\n\nOther drivers around them are speeding\n\nOverconfidence in their driving and/or reaction time\n\nPressure from passengers\n\nNot knowing the maximum speed limit in an Indiana workzone\n\nRead more about the common causes of road accidents in WKW’s car accident blog.\n\nAccidents Caused by Speeding\n\nIn the United States, nearly one-third of all car crashes are a result of speeding. When speeding, the driver has less time to react to other drivers on the road or to road conditions. There are many common accidents related to speed, including:\n\nHead-on collisions\n\nFailing to yield\n\nFailure to stop\n\nSide collisions\n\nRear-end collisions\n\nIntersection crashes\n\nAccidents involving pedestrians or bicyclists\n\nExcessive speed can be a factor in any accident. High speeds also increase the severity of injury and fatality rates and can cause excessive property damage compared to accidents where high speeds may not have been a factor. An Indianapolis car accident attorney can help you recover compensation for an accident that was not your fault.\n\nSafety Tips to Avoid Crashes Caused by Speeding\n\nOne of the main problems with speeding is that it is easy to mindlessly forget the speed limit, to be in a hurry, or to become frustrated and aggressive while on the road. To avoid accidents or other dangers caused by speeding, keep the following tips in mind:\n\nGive yourself plenty of time to reach your destination. It’s better to be early than late and having extra time to get places may reduce your inclination or need to speed.\n\nBe patient. While other drivers on the road may frustrate or even infuriate you, actively focus on keeping your cool so that you and others arrive at their destinations safely.\n\nBe mindful of other drivers around you. Watching out for people speeding will help avoid an accident. If you notice someone speeding, let them pass you if you are in a safe spot to do so.\n\nKnow the speed limit. When a speed limit sign is not posted or you are unsure, refer back to Indiana speed limit laws. In an urban district, the speed limit is 30 mph; in all streets except for subdivisions, the speed limit is 55 mph; on a highway or interstate, the maximum speed limit is 70 mph. Note that these limits are for cars only, not for buses or semi-trucks.\n\nBe aware of what is happening inside and outside of your car. For example, if loud music is playing while you are driving through a city with a lot going on outside, it’s easy to become distracted and go over the speed limit.\n\nBe aware of the weather. Speeding is about staying safe, not necessarily meeting the maximum speed limit. If Indiana roads are icy, the dangers of speed increase that much more. Be aware of inclement weather conditions in order to stay safe on rainy and icy roads.\n\nIn addition to these points, it’s also important to be familiar with Indiana’s “Move Over” laws. When there is an emergency vehicle, you need to move over to let it through. If a vehicle is stopped and has flashing lights, merge so that there is a lane open between it and your vehicle.\n\nLegal Consequences of Speeding\n\nThe consequences of speeding vary widely depending on the circumstances. If a driver is pulled over, they may receive a speeding ticket resulting in points added to their license. Ticket costs can range from anywhere between $75 and $400, depending on the state laws and your driving record.\n\nFirst- or second-time offenders probably won’t lose their license. With three or more violations in the past five years, however, that risk increases. Where speed is a factor along with additional factors, penalties and consequences may be higher or different altogether.\n\nSteps to Take Following an Accident\n\nCar crashes and other auto accidents are scary, especially when high speeds are involved. If you are involved in an auto accident, follow these steps to ensure safety:\n\nStay calm and get to a safe spot\n\nCheck self and others for injuries\n\nSeek medical attention\n\nCall 911\n\nDocument the accident\n\nCollect information from witnesses and additional parties involved\n\nInform insurance company\n\nContact an attorney\n\nDangers of Speeding FAQs\n\nIs it Illegal to Drive Under the Speed Limit?\n\nIt is not illegal to drive under the speed limit, particularly in harsh weather conditions. However, it may be dangerous. Indiana law requires drivers to drive at the speed that is posted. Take a look at the “Speed Limits” section of the Indiana Driver’s Manual for more information on speeding.\n\nWhat Is the Excessive Speed Meaning?\n\nWe’ve talked a lot about speeding, but what is speeding, exactly? According to the Indiana Crash Facts Book, speed-related is defined as an unsafe speed that leads to the cause of a collision. This means that excessive speed can either be the main reason or a contributing factor to an accident.\n\nAt What Speed Does a Car Crash Become Fatal?\n\nThere is no particular speed that causes a fatality in a car crash. Instead, it is the intensity of the crash and what damage is done to the people and property involved. However, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), tests conclude that driving 50 mph or above is more likely to result in injury or death than driving at speeds below that.\n\nCar damage at different speeds can range from minor injuries to fatalities. That’s why it’s so important to be cautious while on the road.\n\nHow Many Accidents Are Caused by Speeding Each Year?\n\nIn Indiana, there were 188 fatalities involving speed-related collisions in 2019.\n\nIs Speeding the Main Cause of Accidents?\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), distracted driving is the leading cause of accidents nationwide. Speeding can contribute to distracted driving.\n\nContact an Attorney Today\n\nIf you or a loved one have been involved in an accident as a result of speeding, contact the Indianapolis attorneys of Wilson Kehoe Winingham today.
