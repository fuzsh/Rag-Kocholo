This will allow you to complete and submit your report electronically and will provide your collision report and report number immediately. This is what most insurance companies will need to process your claim.\n\nIf you would like to download a copy of the paper report, click this link Motor Vehicle Collision Report.

Collision Records staff can assist you if needed. Please refer to office hours and contact information to ensure we are open and available.\n\nHow long does it take for my report to be available?\n\nOfficers completing the collision reports have 2-4 weeks to complete their investigation and have their report approved by their supervisor. It is typically available much sooner, but that is the guideline.\n\nCan you give me collision details over the phone?\n\nNo, we do not give out collision information over the phone.\n\nWhat do all of the codes on the side of the collision report mean?\n\nSide coding is used on a collision report to categorize the massive amounts of collision details contained in the report. The Overlay Sheets will assist you in understanding what each box represents.\n\nUse the sheet “Overlay for Collisions Happening before 12-31-2019” if your collision occurred at any time BEFORE 12-31-2019.\n\nUse the sheet “Overlay for Collisions Happening after 01-01-2022” if your collision occurred at any time AFTER 01-01-2022.\n\nI have a collision on my record, can you remove it?\n\nNo, The Department of Licensing (DOL) is the custodian of your Abstract Driving Record (ADR). If there is a mistake on your driving record, please contact DOL at 360-902-3900.\n\nIf there is a mistake on my collision report, how do I fix it?\n\nOnly the officer that completed the report has the authority to make any changes to the report.\n\nHow far back do your records go?\n\nOur retention schedule is 10 years.\n\nCan I get a certified copy of a collision report?\n\nYes, but it typically takes 5-7 business days to complete that request.\n\nIt has been weeks since my collision, I received a no record found on your WRECR application, how come?\n\nIf an officer arrived at the scene and completed a report, they typically would provide you an exchange of information or direct you to our website, if the damage threshold of $1,000 was not met based on their observation, they would direct you to complete a citizen report. If unsure, please contact the officer or department that arrived at the scene for verification."
