        "text": "For all information regarding licensing (including learners permit, rookie driver, driving test, etc.) please visit MDOT MVA.\n\nYoung driver crashes, injuries, and fatalities in Maryland have generally been declining the past few years. However, young driver issues remain a concern in many communities across the state and country. The focus of young driver traffic safety programs involves Maryland’s Graduated Licensing System (GLS). This system goes beyond traditional driver education to involve young people and their parents, law enforcement, safety professionals, and educators in addressing this high-risk demographic. Approximately 1,500 skills are needed to drive a motor vehicle including observation, perception, interpretation, reaction, and anticipation.\n\nScientific research supports that these important cognitive and motor skills do not occur in adults until the mid-to-late 20’s. Through Maryland’s GLS, young drivers are able to get knowledge and experience to help them become safer behind the wheel and driving well into adulthood. Lack of experience contributes to teens’ higher rate of fatal crashes which is why supervised, behind-the-wheel driving experience is key to helping them develop necessary habits and skills for safe driving."
