        "text": "What is Foot Traffic Data?\n\nFoot traffic data, also known as footfall or location data, analyzes the movement of people from place to place.\n\nThis data is usually derived from actual counting, the use of cameras, in-store sensors, visitor interviews or data sent from mobile devices.\n\nAt its best, this data becomes part of a panel that serves as the basis for larger estimations â enabling high levels of accuracy and a unique cross-sector perspective. For context, standard polling can utilize interviews with hundreds of people to produce a result that is within a 5% margin of error.\n\nFoot traffic is used by real estate, retail and investment professionals as the basis for many of key decisions. Data is often used to measure visits to a property, understand where visitors are coming from (trade area) or is paired with other data such as demographics to better understand the details of a locationâs audience.\n\nA wide range of use cases, like retail site selection, real estate investments and property leasing, and location-based marketing campaigns use foot traffic insights.\n\nTrue Trade Area shows where a propertyâs visitors come from. See an example analysis\n\nWhy Use Location Analytics to Analyze Foot Traffic Data?\n\nWhen boiled down to its core value, location analytics helps any business with a stake in the offline world make better decisions, faster.\n\nâWhy?\n\nFirstly, foot traffic data is behavioral â meaning it shows actions not opinions. In a poll, people are asked to state what they feel about a certain issue or how they believe theyâd act. Foot traffic data focuses on the actions themselves.\n\nSecondly, when done properly with estimations, foot traffic data can provide a single lens on an entire sector. Because it does not rely on a specific companyâs existing data it allows comparisons. These comparisons can be used for benchmarking and competitive intelligence, opening up a wider range of use cases and allowing every location to be compared to any other locations in the country, state or region.\n\nThirdly, it is not owned by a single entity. Whereas an in-store sensor may double count, include employees in its numbers or break down, foot traffic data looks at all locations for all retailers and shopping centers. This enables a unique level of scale and comparability.\n\nFourthly, it is accessible. Whereas other data sources can require weeks or months to normalize, foot traffic data can be provided in near real time when handled properly. Additionally, it can be made far more accessible, and therefore can be used across organizations.\n\nWith the tremendous costs of each decision, the ability to limit risk, better identify opportunities and optimize offline activities is changing the way professionals in Commercial Real Estate, Retail, Hospitality, CPG and beyond drive value offline.\n\nA strong analytics platform allows for ways to generate insights from foot traffic data by leveraging data science and artificial intelligence technologies.\n\nHow Do I Collect Data for Foot Traffic Analysis?\n\nKey considerations to foot traffic data collection:Location â WiFi, GPS, Beacons, and user motion all play a key part in determining accuracy.\n\nâ\n\nâPOIs â The need to match Point of Interest to location requires a highly accurate and current list of places.\n\nVolume â Panel sizes are required to be large enough to accurately reflect visitors.\n\nPanel Biases â Panel biases are modeled and accounted for in extrapolations.\n\nPanel Variations â Changes in technology and application sources are normalized over time.\n\nâThermal sensors â placing sensors at a propertyâs entrances and exits to count the number of people coming and going. The downside is it only provides people counting so thereâs no useful information on your trade area, customer journeys, demographics and cross shopping.\n\nâCameras â CCTV cameras are used to count the number of people entering and exiting a property.\n\nâBeacons & WiFi sensors â connect with phones in the network and count uniques. Both rely on a visitorâs telephone being open to WiFi and bluetooth. Misses out on trade areas, customer journeys, etc.\n\nâMobile Location Data â Use a location-tracking SDK inside mobile applications to track anonymous visits to locations and where the visitors came from. Itâs the only solution to understanding the context of the visits in addition to the number of visits.\n\nFoot Traffic Analysis Use Cases\n\nThere are many use cases for foot traffic, especially related to commercial real estate.\n\nâRetailers\n\nMake better site-selection decisions, track the competition, inform and measure marketing campaigns.\n\nâShopping center owners/operators\n\nAttract high-value customers, make strong leasing offers to ideal tenants, identify acquisition opportunities.\n\nâConsumer Packaged Goods\n\nBetter understanding of consumer shopping behavior, measuring demand for brands and products, and running better local promotional campaigns.\n\nâFinance\n\nIdentify new opportunities, incorporate visitation data into models, monitor foot traffic of portfolio companies.\n\nâCivic & Economic Development\n\nTell your regionâs story to attract the retailers and businesses that will drive sustainable economic development.\n\nâBrokerages\n\nIdentify great properties, win the representation, and drive the transaction with the best data.\n\nâHospitality\n\nAttract high-value customers, learn from your competitors, and make the best strategic decisions.\n\nHow to Analyze a Retail Siteâs Foot Traffic\n\nWhen it comes to making commercial real estate decisions, there is little data more important than foot traffic data.\n\nBut knowing what to look for is just as important as having it.
