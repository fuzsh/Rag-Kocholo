        "text": "Network traffic analysis (NTA) monitors traffic flowing over the network and can tip off an organization of a potential cyberattack on the network infrastructure.\n\nNetwork traffic analysis is the process of capturing, inspecting, and analyzing network data packets to gain insights into the behavior, performance, and security of a computer network. It involves examining the patterns, protocols, and volume of data flowing through a network to understand how devices and systems communicate with each other.\n\nThe process allows network administrators, security professionals, and analysts to monitor network performance, detect network security threats, troubleshoot network issues, understand network usage, and gather information for compliance and auditing. This article focuses on the use of NTA in cybersecurity.\n\nWhy Companies Need an NTA Solution to Bolster Cybersecurity\n\nAs organizations evolve their infrastructure based on digital transformation efforts, networks are increasingly becoming more complex and operating in hybrid multi-cloud environments. This has led to a larger threat landscape with more security gaps. Threat actors can more easily perform reconnaissance, lateral movement, communicate with external systems, and deliver malicious payloads or exfiltrate data. Log data, endpoint solutions, and other telemetry are not suited to exposing these kinds of attack patterns or abnormal activity that are part of an overall active attack campaign.\n\nNetwork traffic analysis solutions serve as a proactive defense mechanism, enabling organizations to identify, respond to, and mitigate cyber threats effectively. By continuously monitoring and analyzing network traffic, companies can spot unusual or suspicious patterns that indicate potential security incidents. For example, quickly identifying traffic going to a known external malicious domain gives administrators the opportunity to break that connection and prevent the download of malware.\n\nNTA also provides visibility into unknown and undetected network threats based on risky abnormal behavior. This gives organizations the opportunity to strengthen their cybersecurity posture and protect their critical assets from various attacks.\n\nWhat is the Goal of Analyzing and Monitoring Network Traffic for Cyber Threats?\n\nThe goal of analyzing and monitoring network traffic for cyber threats is to enhance an organization’s cybersecurity defenses. This is done by having another layer of threat detection; getting an early warning of threats before they can cause damage; getting valuable insights to assist with incident response; gathering evidence for attack attribution; and identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the network infrastructure.\n\nHow NTA Works\n\nNetwork traffic analysis involves monitoring and examining the data flowing through a computer network to gain insights into its behavior, performance, and security. It typically follows these general steps:\n\nData Collection: Network traffic is collected from various sources, such as network devices (routers, switches) or network monitoring tools. This data includes packet-level information such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, protocol types, and payload data.\n\nData Capture: Network traffic is captured using specialized software or hardware devices, such as network analyzers, packet sniffers, or intrusion detection systems. These tools capture packets traversing the network and store them for analysis.\n\nData Filtering and Processing: The captured data is filtered to focus on relevant information. Filtering criteria may include specific IP addresses, protocols, ports, or other attributes of interest. This step reduces the amount of data that needs to be analyzed and enhances the efficiency of subsequent analysis.\n\nTraffic Analysis Techniques: Various techniques are applied to analyze the filtered network traffic, including:\n\nProtocol Analysis: Analyzing the protocols used in network traffic to understand the type of communication occurring. This includes identifying protocols such as HTTP, FTP, DNS, etc., and their associated behaviors.\n\nStatistical Analysis: Analyzing network traffic patterns, such as traffic volume, flow rates, packet sizes, and response times. Statistical analysis can help identify trends, anomalies, or potential performance issues.\n\nBehavioral Analysis: Examining patterns of network behavior over time to detect anomalies or suspicious activities. This can involve comparing current traffic patterns to baseline models or known patterns of normal behavior. In the case of the Gurucul Network Traffic Analysis solution, organizations are provided visibility into unknown and undetected network threats based on risky abnormal behavior. Gurucul machine learning based NTA uses entity models to create behavior baselines for every device and machine on the network based on network flow data such as source and destination IPs/machines, protocol, bytes in/out, etc. It also supports leveraging DHCP logs to correlate IP specific data to machines and users.\n\nPayload Analysis: Inspecting the contents of network packets to extract meaningful information. This can involve examining application-layer data, such as URLs, email subjects, or file contents, to understand the nature of communication or identify potential security threats.\n\nFlow Analysis: Analyzing the flow of network traffic between different hosts or networks to understand communication patterns, detect bottlenecks, or identify potential security incidents.\n\nVisualization and Reporting: The results of the analysis are often presented in visual form to facilitate interpretation. Graphs, charts, and reports help network administrators, security analysts, or researchers understand the findings, identify issues, and make informed decisions.\n\nUse Cases for NTA\n\nThere are numerous security-oriented use cases for network traffic analysis.\n\nDetect Traffic To/From Unusual Geo Locations\n\nWith context from any log family containing IP address fields, it’s possible to detect “geographically undesirable” traffic indicative of account sharing (security policy violations), account takeover (login through compromised credentials), or VPN usage (circumvention of network controls).\n\nExpose DNS Tunneling\n\nNTA can uniquely detect traffic to unusual DNS Servers and surges in outbound DNS queries. It performs comprehensive DNS packet inspection. Standard detection mechanisms only look at DNS length.\n\nIdentify Unknown IoT Devices\n\nNTA monitors activities from all network devices and detects unauthorized use of non-registered devices to access the network. NTA also discovers unknown or unseen devices or services on the network so they can be removed or disabled.\n\nInternal and External Threat Monitoring\n\nNTA provides an effective understanding of real-time network and application traffic. This includes monitoring complex cloud, hybrid, or on-premises architectures with east and west network traffic, which can help identify attacker lateral movement and spreading of an infection across resources. In addition, NTA is effective at monitoring north and south traffic for command-and-control activity to external malicious hosts that could be for downloading more malware, sharing encryption keys for ransomware or externally monitoring current ransomware status, and data exfiltration.\n\nAttack Attribution\n\nNTA can aid in attributing cyber-attacks to specific threat actors or groups. By examining network traffic patterns, communication channels, and other indicators, organizations can gather evidence to identify the source of an attack or the origin of malicious activity. This information can be useful in legal proceedings or intelligence sharing with relevant authorities.\n\nIncident Response\n\nAnalyzing network traffic assists in incident response efforts by providing valuable insights into the nature and scope of security incidents. It helps security teams understand how an attack occurred, the affected systems or devices, the data accessed or compromised, and the methods used by attackers. This information facilitates effective incident containment, eradication, and recovery processes.\n\nThreat Intelligence\n\nAnalyzing network traffic provides valuable data for threat intelligence purposes. By monitoring and analyzing network traffic, organizations can gather information about the latest attack vectors, emerging malware strains, new vulnerabilities, and other indicators of compromise. This intelligence helps in proactive defense measures, such as updating security controls, implementing patches, and adjusting security policies.\n\nVulnerability Assessment\n\nNetwork traffic analysis can help identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the network infrastructure. By examining traffic patterns and communication protocols, organizations can identify potential security gaps, misconfigurations, or outdated software versions that may be exploited by attackers. This information assists in prioritizing vulnerability management efforts and implementing appropriate security measures.\n\nCompliance and Audit\n\nAnalyzing network traffic ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and internal security policies. By monitoring network activity, organizations can verify adherence to security standards, track data transfers, and identify any non-compliant or suspicious activities. Network traffic analysis supports auditing processes, enabling organizations to demonstrate compliance and respond to compliance-related inquiries.\n\nHow Does NTA Enhance Your Security?\n\nNetwork traffic analysis plays a crucial role in enhancing security by providing valuable insights into the network activities and detecting potential security threats. Overall, NTA enables proactive monitoring, threat detection, and incident response, helping organizations identify and mitigate security risks in a timely manner.

Gurucul NTA provides pre-packaged machine learning models which are pre-configured and tuned to run on high frequency network data streams to detect real-time anomalies and risk ranked threats.\n\nIn addition to network data, Gurucul also can ingest and link application and platform logs, security alerts, DHCP, CMDB data, vulnerability assessment reports, threat intelligence and access control data to build rich context. This provides end-to-end visibility and trace of the anomalous behavior kill-chain from across the network. This contextual linked data and extensive library of out-of-the-box behavior and threat models help identify advanced and unknown threats like zero-day exploits, fileless malware, and ransomware. This is achieved by detecting unusual behavior on a given entity (e.g. server, IP, device), any related lateral movement within the network, command and control (C2) communication, suspicious account activity from a compromised account, as well as access misuse.\n\nThe platform supports real-time data processing and analytics to quickly detect such threats at near real-time as well as uncover APT / stealth attacks which lay dormant between various stages of an attack. For instance, if a host belonging to the database administrator shows indications of suspicious outbound C2 traffic as well as lateral movement across a range of hosts not seen before, Gurucul NTA will immediately flag such risky abnormal behavior. The solution can be configured to trigger automated risk response to isolate the host from the production network or allow the NetOps team to take preventive actions before the compromise.\n\nWith the expansion of IoT and mobility in the borderless enterprise environment, one of the top threats has been the unauthorized use of non-registered devices, and WiFi/IoT networks, to gain access to enterprise networks. The Gurucul NTA solution also discovers and reports any unknown or unseen devices on the network. It closely monitors all activities from such devices with a higher resident risk score.\n\nNetOps and SecOps users can further customize existing machine learning models or deploy their own from templates offered out of the box. These models are highly flexible and allow users to run analytics on a wide variety of attributes including IP addresses, ports, byte size, etc. Custom models are especially useful to track activity from non-traditional hosts such as CCTVs, PoS terminals and IoT devices. With an increasing number of Robotic Process Automations, bots and scripts on the prowl, accounting for and reducing the attack surface for what could be weak links in the network becomes imperative to ensure the overall health of the environment. There exist very few inherent means of securing these devices, and Gurucul Network Traffic Analysis can serve as a valuable alerting tool to preempt any malicious activity.\n\nA side benefit is that network behavior analytics also can identify unregistered devices, network policy violations and network misconfigurations that result in higher risk.\n\nConclusion\n\nNetwork traffic analysis is an important proactive defense mechanism that provides one more layer of security by delivering valuable insights into unusual or suspicious network activities. NTA enables proactive monitoring, threat detection, and incident response, helping organizations identify and mitigate security risks in a timely manner.\n\nRelated Resources"
