        "text": "NTA provides a suite of reports for viewing more detailed probe data from different perspectives. Detailed reports for probes are organized into the following reporting groups:\n\nTraffic reports—Provide overall traffic statistics for the selected time range for probe tasks.\n\nApplication reports—Provide rate of traffic statistics by application with details for an individual application.\n\nSource reports—Provide rate and percentage distribution of traffic by source host for the task for the selected time range.\n\nDestination reports—Provide rate and percentage distribution of traffic by destination host the task for the selected time range.\n\nSession reports—Display the rate and percentage distribution of traffic on source and destination pairs for the selected time range.\n\nSource, destination, and session reports allow you to access more detailed data.\n\nTraffic reports for probe tasks provide statistics for the probe traffic analysis task. The Traffic Trend chart displays average traffic rate, and minimum average, maximum average, and average traffic rate statistics in a table for the associated task. The Traffic Details list provides individual data collection samples: timestamp, total volume of traffic, and traffic rate in seconds. You can filter reports by time range.\n\nTo view the reports for a probe task, click the Traffic tab to view traffic reports for the selected probe traffic analysis task.\n\nQuery traffic\n\nNTA enables you to change the filter criteria for probe reports. You can change the default settings for the time range for the graphs and tables to customize the reports displayed under the Traffic tab.\n\nIn the query criteria area in the upper right corner of the traffic report, click the icon . On the list that is displayed, select Last 1 hour, Last 3 hours, Last 12 hours, Last 24 hours, Last 7 days, Last 30 days, Last 3 months, or Custom. Click the Query icon in the query criteria area to set the time range for the traffic report.\n\nTo customize the time range for the traffic report, select Custom from the list that is displayed in the query criteria area, or click the Advanced icon next to the query field to expand the query criteria area.\n\nSpecify the following query criteria:\n\nStart Time—Enter the start time of the time range, in YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm format. Or, click the Calendar icon next to the input box to manually specify a start time.\n\nEnd Time—Enter the end time of the time range, in YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm format. Or, click the Calendar icon next to the input box to manually specify an end time.\n\nClick OK.\n\nThe page displays the results of your query.\n\nClick Export to view reports using the IMC Intelligent Analysis Report Viewer and to print or export all reports found on this page.\n\nTo print this report, click the Print icon on the toolbar.\n\nIn Page Range, select the page range.\n\nTo export the data, click Export.\n\nTo export this report, click the Export icon on the toolbar.\n\nSelect the export file format from the File Format list. Options are:\n\nPDF\n\nXLS\n\nCSV\n\nDOCX\n\nRTF\n\nXLSX\n\nPPTX\n\nHTML\n\nJRXML\n\nIn Page Range, select the page range.\n\nClick Export.\n\nTraffic Trend – Average\n\nThe Traffic Trend line chart displays the average traffic rate for the selected time range. This chart provides total, minimum average, maximum average, and average traffic rate statistics in a table for traffic for the associated task for the selected time range.\n\nFigure 96: Traffic Trend\n\nTraffic Trend – Peak Rate\n\nNTA displays the Max./Min. Peak Rate chart next to the Traffic Trend chart when the Peak Traffic Analysis feature is enabled and the time range for the report exceeds six hours.\n\nThe Traffic Trend – Peak Rate line chart displays the minimum and maximum peak traffic rate for the associated task for the selected time range. This chart contains two lines. The red line displays the maximum peak rate. The green line displays the MIN peak rate.\n\nFigure 97: Traffic Trend – Peak Rate Report\n\nFor more information on enabling Peak Traffic Analysis, see \"Configuring NTA traffic analysis parameters.\"\n\nTraffic Details\n\nThe Traffic Details list provides the data collection samples for traffic statistics based on the report time range. This report includes timestamp, total volume of traffic, and traffic rate in seconds.\n\nFigure 98: Traffic Details\n\nApplication reports provide rate of traffic statistics by application, by protocol, and by application category for a task, with details for an individual application. Application reports for a probe traffic analysis task include the Application List, which provides a list of applications captured by the probe in the selected probe traffic analysis task. This report also provides additional reports for the selected application. The Application Traffic Trend stacked area chart displays average traffic rates for all applications captured by the probe in the selected traffic analysis task.\n\nProtocol reports for a probe traffic analysis task include the Protocol List, which provides a list of protocols captured by the probe in the selected probe traffic analysis task. This report also links to additional reports for the selected protocol.
