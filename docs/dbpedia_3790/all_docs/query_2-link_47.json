        "text": "Report a Vehicle Crash\n\nIf you are involved in a crash or collision, whether that may be with another vehicle, pedestrian, building or bicyclist, Colorado State law requires all drivers involved to provide their name, address and vehicle registration to all other involved persons. This means that you must show your driver's license to anyone who asks to see it. In all cases, except when an Accident Alert has been declared, you must stop and report the crash by calling your local police station or 911.\n\nPlease Note: Vehicle crash reporting is for Colorado Department of Revenue records only. No law enforcement agency will be investigating these reports, and the Denver Police Department will not able to provide you with a copy of any submitted report.\n\nReport a Vehicle Crash\n\nAccident Alert\n\nAn Accident Alert is declared when conditions (such as inclement weather or other emergency) are so severe that police officers are unable to respond to the volume of motor vehicle crashes. If involved in a crash while an Accident Alert is declared, call 911 and waiting for a dispatcher to determine if a police officer will be sent to the scene. If the crash does not meet the criteria for a police response you must do the following:\n\nAll drivers involved must exchange their name, driver's license information, vehicle registration information and proof of insurance information.\n\nFile a report as soon as possible by reporting the crash to your local police station or calling 911. For crashes that occur outside of the Denver city limits, you must respond to that jurisdiction to complete the counter crash report.\n\nRequest an Accident Report\n\nVisit our Records page to order an Accident Report. To obtain an accident report case number, please call the Denver Police Records Section at 720-913-6029 anytime from 10:00am to 4:00pm, Monday through Friday (holidays and City furlough days excluded).\n\nParking Citation\n\nYou can pay your parking ticket online, over the phone, in person, or by mail.\n\nTo pay by phone using a Visa, Mastercard, or Discover, call 1-866-280-9988.\n\nMail-in payments may be made by check or cashiers check. Payment must be sent in US Dollars. Please write the ticket number(s) on the check. If you have received a notice concerning the ticket through the mail, please return the payment coupon from your notice along with your payment to:\n\nParking Violations Bureau\n\nP.O. Box 46500\n\nDenver, Colorado 80201-6500\n\nPay a Parking Citation\n\nTraffic Citation\n\nIf there is a fine amount listed on the front of your ticket, you can pay the ticket online, by mail, or in person. Visa, MasterCard, Discover, cash, money order or personal check are acceptable forms of payment. The Court does not accept payments by phone. If you do not know your ticket number, you can do a Search by Name and find all your cases that can be paid online.\n\nPay a Traffic Citation\n\nPhoto Radar Ticket\n\nVisit the Photo Radar Enforcement page for more information.\n\nLocating a Towed Vehicle\n\nDenver, unlike many municipalities, doesn't automatically impound towed vehicles. Vehicles that are towed are often relocated to a nearby location and parked legally there. There is a $100 tow fee incurred for moving a vehicle.\n\nIf your vehicle has been towed, contact the Denver Police Non-Emergency line (720-913-2000) to locate it or search for your vehicle online if it has been impounded.\n\nVisit the Denver Sheriff Vehicle Impound for more information.\n\nBoot Removal\n\nIf there are 3 or more unpaid tickets (or other outstanding citations) on a vehicle, a seizure warning notice will be issued, and a boot may be placed on your car. The boot won't be removed until all outstanding fines (including the additional $100 boot fee) are paid. If a vehicle is booted for 72 hours (excluding weekends and holidays) without payment, it will be considered abandoned and towed to impound. If a vehicle is towed to impound, an additional $100 tow fee will be charged.\n\nPayment by phone or online for booted vehicles can be made 24 hours a day. However, if fines, penalties and boot fees are paid after 5:00 pm using the Pay-by-Phone system or the Pay-by-Web service, the vehicle will be released during normal operating hours.\n\nWalk-in payments for boots may be made with cash, money order, Visa or Mastercard; no checks accepted for boots. Payments should be presented at the Parking Cashier's Office on the first floor of the Wellington Webb Building, 201 W. Colfax Avenue. The Parking Cashier's Office is open Monday through Friday between 8:00am and 5:00 pm, excluding holidays.\n\nPay a Parking Citation"
