        "text": "Cars have come a long way since their conception in the 19th century. More than just a means of traveling between points A and B, these vehicles have evolved to be safer, intelligent companions for their users. While they were regarded as “death machines” for many years, modern cars boast sophisticated, safe driving technologies that protect drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. These cutting-edge systems act as a second pair of eyes (and hands) for drivers.\n\nModern technologies like Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving Systems (ADS) offer a range of features designed to add more layers of safety and improve the overall driving experience. Some provide alerts and warnings to notify drivers of potential road hazards. Other safety features take a more active role in ensuring safety by directly intervening in driving maneuvers to prevent car accidents or reduce the risk of severe injuries if one does occur.\n\nThe Key To Preventing Car Accidents With Technology Is Reducing Human Error\n\nOur personal injury lawyers agree that human error remains the leading cause of traffic accidents. Knowing this, many auto manufacturers are hard at work equipping their vehicles with various features that will assist drivers in reducing the potential for making mistakes that will ultimately lead to a serious or even fatal car accident.\n\nThe auto industry’s new technologies have helped reduce the number of car accidents worldwide. With all the innovation and future technology available to drivers that limit the common causes of car collisions, traffic-related accidents will likely continue to decrease significantly.\n\nLatest Technologies That Help Prevent Car Accidents And Injuries\n\nHere are the newest safe-driving technologies that will significantly help drivers steer clear of accidents on the road:\n\nAutomatic Emergency Braking Systems (AEB)\n\nAutomatic emergency braking systems are classified into two types: crash imminent braking and dynamic brake support. These control forward and reverse brakes, respectively. Both of these features can be especially helpful in preventing rear-end accidents and head-on collisions.\n\nAccording to a 2019 report, rear-end collisions typically account for around one-third of all car accidents reported annually. In 2022, the National Safety Council (NSC) reported that 3,400 deaths, or 17.3% of all fatalities in motor vehicle crashes, stem from rear-end crashes. Meanwhile, head-on collisions accounted for 26.9% or 5,800 fatalities.\n\nAEBs are also designed to help prevent the following accidents:\n\nAEBs play a huge role in preventing these accidents. These systems use radar sensors to identify potential hazards in front of the car. When a collision with another vehicle is likely, crash imminent braking alerts the driver. It can even apply the brakes automatically to prevent an accident or minimize the impact. On the other hand, dynamic brake support will kick in when the driver doesn’t brake hard enough. It provides additional braking force to avoid a crash.\n\nBackup Cameras\n\nBackup cameras, also known as rearview video systems, are designed to prevent crashes that may occur when a driver is backing up. This type of accident often involves a bicyclist or pedestrian getting struck by a vehicle pulling out of a driveway or parking lot.\n\nThese cameras automatically turn on when the vehicle is in reverse, giving the driver a direct view of what’s happening behind the car. Because rearview video systems effectively reduce the risk of backup accidents, they are now mandatory on all vehicles manufactured after May 2018.\n\nBlind Spot Detection\n\nMassive vehicles like trucks have huge blind spots that truckers and other road users have to be wary of. Unfortunately, blind spot accidents frequently happen on U.S. roads. Using blind spot detection helps drivers ensure that no vehicles are in their blind spots (i.e., the places that drivers cannot easily see) if they change lanes. Some versions of this technology allow the driver to receive constant updates on their blind spots’ status, while other systems only provide warnings when the turn signal is on. A widespread adoption of blind spot detection could help save countless lives everywhere.\n\nLane Departure Warnings\n\nThis technology uses cameras to keep track of the car’s position inside the lane markings. If you begin to drift without using a turn signal, the system will sound an alarm to get your attention back on the road and prevent a potential sideswipe accident. This technology is particularly helpful for drivers who might have momentary lapses in concentration. Some versions of this technology can also take control of the vehicle, ensuring it stays within the lane.\n\nForward Collision Systems (FCS)\n\nMany people end up in rear-end accidents simply because they aren’t focusing on the road. They might be looking at the other side of the road or looking down at their phones while driving. Forward collision systems are a saving grace in these situations.\n\nFCS uses sensors to monitor the distance between the car and the vehicle in front. If the system detects a closing distance that suggests an imminent collision, it will typically warn the driver with an audible or visual alert. In some advanced systems, FCW can even initiate automatic braking to further mitigate the impact of a crash.\n\nAdaptive Headlights\n\nAdaptive headlights are another new and impressive technology that’s proven to minimize road accidents. These devices activate when the steering wheel is turned.\n\nSo, how are these helping drivers avoid accidents? Imagine driving down a dark road, and a deer jumps out onto the road, or another vehicle enters your path. Using adaptive headlights will allow you to see anything on the road at all times. Some models even have auto-dimming features to prevent blinding oncoming motorists.\n\nElectronic Stability Control (ECS)\n\nElectronic Stability Control is an excellent breakthrough that keeps vehicles from sliding out of control, even in dangerous weather conditions. This system uses sensors for wheel speed, steering angles, and side-way motions. If it detects that the car is losing traction and is about to skid, it applies brakes to the wheels to reduce engine power.\n\nStudies show that ESC can prevent around 50% of traffic accidents, including rollovers and car crashes.\n\nVehicle-To-Vehicle Communication (V2V)\n\nSelf-driving vehicles have lately been a big focus in the automobile sector. This type of technology would require vehicles to have a type of communication to prevent a collision. Enter V2V or vehicle-to-vehicle communication. This technology allows vehicles to directly communicate with each other, sharing real-time traffic data and hazard warnings to prevent collisions.\n\nV2V communication relies on GPS for location tracking and other sensors to detect surrounding vehicles and objects. The GPS, along with the Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) tech, connects cars with other vehicles and detects when road users, such as cyclists and pedestrians, are nearby.\n\nV2V is a game-changer. It has the potential to dramatically reduce accidents, especially in congested urban areas where road hazards can be unpredictable.\n\nTraction Control Systems( TCS)\n\nTraction Control Systems can help eliminate accidents on slippery roads. They prevent the vehicle’s wheel from spinning out of control when it starts or accelerates, particularly on wet ground.\n\nAlthough similar in objectives, TCS differs from anti-lock braking systems. The latter prevents the brake pads from locking by slowly lowering the pressure applied to the brakes. On the other hand, TCS simultaneously reduces the engine power delivered to the wheels, reducing their traction to maintain control and stability.\n\nAuto-Steering\n\nSome cars nowadays are capable of auto-steering. However, this does not mean that your car can completely drive itself. The technology can control the steering wheel in specific situations to prevent a collision. This crash avoidance technology obtains information from your surroundings and uses it to change your vehicle’s performance accordingly.\n\nCurrently, many auto-steering systems work together with automatic braking systems. That’s why most vehicles with auto-steering devices can apply brakes while avoiding or going around potential obstructions in the path, such as motorists or pedestrians.\n\nRear Cross-Traffic Alert\n\nA rear cross-traffic alert is similar to a backup camera but only alerts you to approaching objects rather than stationary ones. This system alerts you to approaching vehicles when backing out of a parking space. It can also warn you of an animal, a person, or any other moving obstructions in your way.\n\nWhen it senses danger, the system typically sounds a warning beep and flashes an indicator light in your side mirrors, allowing you to react quickly to avoid a collision.\n\nRear AEB\n\nA car with a rear cross-traffic alert installed also often has a rear AEB system. If an object is detected, the system automatically applies the brakes to prevent the driver from backing into it.\n\nLED Headlights\n\nHaving quality headlights is an important way to prevent a car accident at night. Unlike traditional halogen bulbs, light-emitting diode (LED) headlights last much longer, with some lasting over 20 years. An LED light does more than light up the street in front of you so you can see. They directly convert 80% of their energy to light. LED headlights only waste twenty percent of their energy. Compared to halogen bulbs, which only convert around 20% and wastes 80%, LED headlights put less strain on your car’s battery.\n\nLED headlights also generally produce better-quality light. They illuminate the road without blinding other drivers. An LED headlight also draws less energy from the car and produces a much brighter light, which improves fuel efficiency.\n\nAutonomous Cruise Control (ACC)\n\nFor a long time, vehicles have been equipped with cruise control, which makes long-distance drives a lot more bearable. Autonomous Cruise Control is a more advanced version of cruise control technology. It automatically adjusts the speed of your car to help maintain a safe distance from other vehicles in front. That way, you can enjoy the benefits of cruise control without constantly slamming on the brakes and resetting it due to slow traffic or sudden stops.\n\nThere is now an even more advanced option for cruise control called cooperative adaptive cruise control. This system gathers information from roadside beacons, mobile infrastructure, and satellites to determine the distance between other vehicles and adjust accordingly.\n\nVoice Control/Bluetooth\n\nIn California and many other states, using a phone while driving is illegal, and for good reason; after all, it’s one of the leading causes of motor vehicle accidents. Smartphones nowadays can automatically be connected to Bluetooth-enabled cars, allowing you to answer calls with a voice command.\n\nVoice control also allows you to interact with your car’s features. Using voice commands, you can get directions, change songs, adjust the temperature, and perform other functions without taking your hands off the wheel and your eyes off the road.\n\nThis is not a brand-new technology, but it is helpful in preventing distracted driving accidents. Due to an increase in car accidents caused by phone distractions, many applications and devices for safe driving will continue to receive funding.\n\nAnti-Reckless Teen Driving Tech\n\nEven if you manage to prevent teenagers from using their phones while behind the wheel, they might still be tempted to engage in aggressive driving when prompted to do so by their peers. Some younger drivers even speed to reach their destinations faster or engage in other risky behaviors for fun.\n\nTeens need to think twice about reckless driving. Now, there are products designed to monitor and ensure the safe driving of teens. For example, some phone applications that use GPS can alert parents if the teen is speeding or driving dangerously.\n\nInterlock Devices\n\nEvery year, thousands of deaths occur due to driver drowsiness or intoxication. In 2022, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) logged 693 deaths due to drowsy driving. Meanwhile, authorities recorded about 13,524 alcohol-related traffic deaths.\n\nEvery year, there are more than 9,000 fatalities that can be avoided if an attention detection device is implemented to monitor a driver for any sign of drowsiness or inebriation. For example, an in-vehicle breathalyzer could disable a vehicle if the driver’s blood alcohol content (BAC) exceeds 0.08.\n\nDrowsiness Video Sensor\n\nThere is also a drowsiness video sensor on the dashboard that monitors the driver’s face for any signs of drowsiness. The system records your driving habits and behavior using sensors and cameras. It then analyzes the video footage of the driver’s face and behavior to determine whether they’re attentive enough to operate their car safely. It can also track the movements of your eyes and see how they coordinate with the steering wheel.\n\nThis technology also checks on the following:\n\nEye Movement & Closure — The cameras monitor whether you close your eyes frequently, which can indicate fatigue.\n\nSteering Patterns — The sensors detect how you control your steering wheel, whether it starts to wander or your grip on it becomes loose.\n\nLane Position — The system tracks if your car drifts from its lane without a clear cause.\n\nThe system immediately notifies you if it notices signs that you might be distracted or sleepy. This sensor will tug on the driver’s seat belt or make noises to get the driver to pull over. When you receive these signals, find a safe parking spot, then rest or take a nap to avoid drowsy driving.\n\nThis technology also offers in-the-moment assessments and interventions, significantly reducing the risk of accidents. It provides extra security for anyone traveling long distances or at specific times when fatigue may set in, such as early in the morning or late at night.\n\nThe trucking industry has been the first to adopt this technology. Some logistics service providers use special Bluetooth headsets that track drivers’ head movements and eye activity to assess drowsiness.\n\nGear Shift Palm Detection\n\nThis technology integrates a sensor into the gear shift knob that detects alcohol traces on the driver’s palm. If alcohol is present above a certain threshold, the system automatically shifts the car into park. It also triggers the navigation system to issue a voice alert for drunk driving. Nissan and other car manufacturers are incorporating this technology into their vehicles.\n\nPhone Suppression Technology\n\nNew apps, such as Zoom Safer, are improving road awareness and helping drivers ignore their phones. Zoom Safer is installed on the headset to screen text messages and calls. This technology will block text messages and inform those texting that you are currently driving. It will announce any callers over a speaker, so the driver does not have to look at the phone.\n\nNight Vision\n\nNight vision technology makes driving considerably easier and safer at night. It is particularly useful when traveling in areas with fewer streetlights or where animals often walk or cross. Standard headlights only illuminate a portion of the pathway. With night vision technology, you can better see the entire road, its curves, bumps, and obstructions.\n\nThis technology also uses special cameras with low-light performance, which can detect heat and emit a unique type of light to improve long-range vision. The system may also display images of people, animals, and other objects on the road that are typically difficult to notice with only your car’s headlights on your dashboard screen.\n\nTire And Wheel Innovations\n\nLike other car parts, tires play a critical role in safe driving. Worn or defective tires can significantly compromise your handling and braking abilities. Here are some new technologies designed for tires to keep you safe on the road:\n\nRun-Flat Tires — These tires allow drivers to continue driving for a limited distance, even after a puncture. They give you time to reach a safe location for repairs.\n\nTire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) — This technology monitors tire pressure to ensure optimal performance. The system will warn you if your tire pressure falls below a safe level so you can address the issue before it becomes a safety hazard.\n\nDriver Alcohol Detection System For Safety (DADSS)\n\nAnother innovation called the driver alcohol detection system for safety has resurfaced to reduce drunk driving-related accidents. It comes with two technologies:\n\nA touch system emits an infrared light that passes through the motorist’s fingertips or palms to measure blood alcohol content. It can capture several precise readings in a short time. Vehicle experts are still deciding on the technology’s most appropriate placement. However, initial discussions suggest it should be near the car’s steering wheel, gear change, and starter button.\n\nA breath system measures the vehicle occupants’ normal breath in a passive and noninvasive manner. Unlike breathalyzers, it doesn’t require a forced deep lung sample into a mouthpiece. The sensor uses infrared light to precisely determine alcohol levels.\n\nCars installed with DADSS may start but not move if the driver’s BAC is at or over the legal limit of 0.08%. While waiting for the alcohol level to drop, drivers may charge their phones, call for assistance, or adjust their vehicle temperature. Once the BAC falls below the limit, the system will reset and prepare to conduct another test.\n\nUsing Existing And Emerging Technology To Prevent Distracted Driving\n\nTechnology has become an unavoidable part of everyone’s life. Not many people can say they go a day without having anything to do with technology. Now, we can keep in touch with family and friends and work anywhere, whether we’re at the beach, the mall, or even on the road.\n\nHowever, fiddling with any device while driving, especially a cell phone, is incredibly dangerous. It can divert drivers’ attention, causing them to collide with obstacles or oncoming traffic. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported that in 2022, the country recorded a total of 3,308 fatalities and 289,310 injured individuals due to distracted driving.\n\nDistracted driving has become a prevalent concern throughout the United States. Although many drivers agree that it is dangerous, their actions don’t always match their words.\n\nBased on a nationwide survey, 38% of drivers in the country admit their increasing impatience behind the wheel over the last 12 months. Results also reveal that about 54% have been guilty of speeding by more than ten mph, while 56% have been eating while driving. Furthermore, almost one-fifth, or 22%, of the drivers were reported to be texting while driving, and 21% were making lewd gestures to other drivers.\n\n​​Technology can be part of the solution, not just the problem. While some technologies contribute to distracted driving, others can actually promote safe practices. The following devices may be used to reduce distractions:\n\nMobile Phone Solutions\n\nSmartphones with built-in driving modes offer a convenient and cost-free way to help drivers minimize distractions. When enabled, driving mode turns on a “Do Not Disturb” function, silencing incoming calls, messages, and notifications that could pull your focus away from driving.\n\nOther Car Safety Features Technology\n\nTo help reduce the accidents and fatalities caused by distracted driving, automakers and tech companies created standard safety measures that can be installed in most cars. These include the following:\n\nSeatbelt Sensors — Seatbelts save lives, but the importance of using one while driving is often overlooked. Most cars have seatbelt warning lights on their dashboards, but some cars have seatbelt alarms that emit loud successive beeps until the driver and passengers fasten their seatbelts.\n\nLane-Keeping Assist — This device automatically applies light steering correction to help a car stay in its lane.\n\nLockout Controls — While the car moves, lockout controls can partially control on-screen keyboard monitor functions.\n\nDriver-Monitoring Systems (DMSs) — These systems aim to continuously evaluate drivers’ attentiveness and concentration. Using both hardware and software components, DMSs monitor driver behaviors and physiological states in real time and give warnings as needed.\n\nInfotainment Systems — Due to technological advancements, infotainment devices rely less on visual or physical controls, so they won’t compromise a driver’s attention. For example, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay enable phones to connect to the vehicle’s built-in microphones and speakers. The driver can then use voice control to play music and access other apps.\n\nTelematics Technologies\n\nWith auto insurance rates increasing, agents have a great opportunity to use telematics to help both personal and commercial clients save money. This technology has advanced significantly and has become accessible through mobile applications, internet-connected phones, and plugged-in vehicle gadgets.\n\nTelematics primarily collects data on driving behavior and vehicle data, such as:\n\nThe system can detect car accidents and automatically call emergency services. It can also analyze the circumstances of the event, potentially aiding in accident reconstruction for insurance purposes. Additionally, safer drivers with lower risk profiles based on telematics data may qualify for lower premiums.\n\nHow Cybersecurity Devices Protect Cars From Hackers\n\nLike computers and cell phones, modern vehicles typically contain computer systems that perform many functions. As these systems are also often connected to the internet, they become vulnerable to cyberattacks.\n\nHackers may attempt to access an automobile without authorization to take over the vehicle. They may also deactivate safety features or steal personal information. Drivers may need to install cybersecurity features, such as data-blocking devices, intrusion detection systems, or anti-hacking software, to help protect privacy and safety.\n\nThese features prevent hackers from gaining control of a car’s systems, potentially manipulating steering or braking functions. They also prevent vulnerabilities in software within a car’s system that can lead to glitches and malfunctions, impacting features crucial for a smooth driving experience.\n\nHow Drivers Must Treat Car Safety Features\n\nModern cars are packed with technology designed to keep you safe. These features can be incredibly helpful, but only if you understand how they work and how to use them properly.\n\nFor instance, if you have an ADAS camera or sensor, you should be aware that these technologies are commonly installed on windshields or the sides of vehicles, which are more susceptible to damage. If they become defective, only skilled experts should replace or recalibrate them using special equipment. Errors in this process can render the technology useless, leading to inaccurate identification of potential hazards.\n\nYou should also use the ADAS as intended. A 2020 survey of 500 US drivers with 2016-made vehicles revealed that many intentionally disabled certain safety features that could help them avoid collisions. For instance, 30% of them would turn off their adaptive cruise controls because they prefer full control of their vehicles instead of relying on a device.\n\nMeanwhile, 23% wouldn’t keep using lane-keeping assistants and driver attention monitors after these systems sent false alarms. Lane-keeping assistants could inform drivers with a sound, flashing light, and vibration if their cars drift out of their lanes. If the driver doesn’t react, the system takes over the steering to return the vehicle to the center of the lane. However, many drivers find this feature disturbing, so they disengage this function.\n\nSome people also disable adaptive cruise control because they find the system bothersome or prefer to operate the vehicle manually. Other safety features also switched off were AEBs, traffic sign recognition, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection systems, blind-spot monitoring, backup cameras, and traffic alerts.\n\nWhile some drivers might find certain safety features annoying or intrusive at first, disabling them can significantly increase their risk of getting into an accident. At the same time, remember that these safety features are there to assist you, not take over completely. You should always be alert and focused behind the wheel.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Safe Driving Technologies\n\nWhat Is The Difference Between ADS And ADAS?\n\nAdvanced Driver-Assistance Systems, or ADAS, are technological features that improve driver safety. Unlike ADS, these features still require human intervention. Sensors and cameras can detect nearby obstacles or driver errors and alert the driver. If a sensor in an ADAS-equipped vehicle malfunctions, its specific function stops working.\n\nOn the other hand, Automated Driving Systems, or ADS, are the highest level of driving automation. Vehicles equipped with ADS can perform all aspects of dynamic driving within their operational design domain (ODD) specific to the model, even in the absence of human intervention or supervision.\n\nShould You Buy A Car With Advanced Safety Systems?\n\nAdvanced safety systems are crucial for some drivers, particularly those driving for Uber and Lyft. They’re encouraged to use ADAS to minimize the risk of harm while providing ridesharing services. This approach is similar to purchasing insurance for an inevitable event, aiming to reduce potential liability and damages as much as possible.\n\nHowever, ADAS also contributes to higher vehicle costs, including maintenance and repair expenses. Because these systems rely on complex sensors, repairs after an accident can be significantly more expensive than with a regular car. The cost difference can be as much as double the typical service bill. Despite its drawbacks, ADAS is a worthwhile investment, especially since it can significantly enhance a car’s safety.\n\nAre These Systems Actually Making Cars Safer?\n\nMany drivers and car enthusiasts wonder, “Are vehicles with sophisticated safety systems truly safer?” Most research shows that they are.\n\nAccording to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the crash involvement rate for cars equipped with blind-spot monitoring was 14% lower than that for identical models without the technology. A separate study also reported that about 50,000 crashes and 16,000 injuries may have been prevented if this monitoring device had been sold in the country since 2015. It could have also reduced crash frequency by roughly 3.5% and prevention costs by up to $264 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the Partnership for Analytics Research in Traffic Safety (PARTS) also published a 2022 study revealing the benefits of FCS and AEBs. These technologies have reduced the number of traffic accidents by 49%, injury crashes by 53%, and serious collisions by 42%.\n\nThe same analysis also indicated that AEBs are applicable in different weather, lighting, and road conditions. Furthermore, lane-keeping, centering assistance, and other similar intervention technologies are beneficial in reducing single-vehicle crashes that result in severe injuries.\n\nAlthough these safety features have garnered excellent impressions from users, they have also received criticism. Some drivers report that their car systems misinterpret nearby vehicles, especially on highway on-ramps, as potential crash threats.\n\nDoes New Technology In Vehicles Cause Accidents?\n\nNew vehicle technologies are designed to improve safety. However, they are not completely foolproof. While these features can significantly reduce accidents, things can still go wrong, especially when misused.\n\nAccording to a 2019 study, drivers often struggle to understand how these systems work and how to use them properly. Researchers acknowledged that learning new technology takes time but also identified a troubling trend. Many drivers don’t make the effort to grasp the limitations of these automated safety systems. The expectation seems to be that these features operate autonomously without driver responsibility.\n\nAnother recent study revealed that many vehicles with ADAS still experienced accidents. In California, 200 such accidents happened, mostly at intersections on dry surfaces, involving vehicles traveling at 25 mph.\n\nThis data underscores the importance of safe driving practices, even in vehicles with advanced technology. Remember, ADAS is there to assist, not replace, you behind the wheel.\n\nIn What Way Does Automotive Technology Contribute To Wrecks?\n\nDifferent technologies are emerging to help drivers prevent collisions. However, this does not mean traffic accidents will drop to zero.\n\nHere are some ways safety technologies can contribute to car accidents:\n\nOver-Reliance On Technology\n\nDrivers are increasingly expected to use modern in-car technology, which they may not fully understand. For example, GPS systems are responsible for over 200,000 crashes in the country annually. Some of these accidents happened when drivers looked at maps and navigational instructions. Others occurred when drivers blindly followed directions, which led them astray.\n\nFurthermore, depending too heavily on ADAS may lead to driver inattention. While some ADAS features can enhance focus, over-reliance can be dangerous. Drivers may become complacent, trusting technology to handle situations for them without maintaining their vigilance.\n\nIn fact, in the first quarter of 2024, TESLA recorded one crash for every 7.63 million miles driven by its vehicles with autopilot technology.\n\nOverwhelmed By Information\n\nMultiple safety technologies can overwhelm drivers and lead to confusion. For example, you might become overstimulated and lose focus if you constantly try to monitor and interpret information from multiple displays. Sensors and warnings may also cause you to become distracted while driving.\n\nDistractions From Infotainment Systems\n\nInfotainment systems in cars make traveling easier. They’re designed in a really simple way to avoid distractions. Nonetheless, they can still distract drivers. Adjusting the radio or changing a podcast while driving on a busy street can cause you to look away from the road. Consequently, you might fail to notice obstructions or incoming traffic, leading to accidents. Excessive focus on the car’s technology, whether using a touchscreen or voice commands, can also result in collisions.\n\nVehicle Safety Systems Struggle To “See” In Bad Weather\n\nCalifornia’s reputation for sunshine can lull drivers into a false sense of security. While rain, fog, and thunderstorms are less frequent, they can still pose a significant threat when they do occur. These unpredictable weather events can quickly change road conditions. For example, rain makes the pavement slippery, reducing traction and increasing stopping distances.\n\nYou might be tempted to rely on your car’s safety features in these challenging conditions. Unfortunately, they may not function optimally during the storm.\n\nAAA’s research indicates that AEBs may decrease performance in wet weather conditions. Researchers found out that at a speed of only 35 mph, this technology failed one out of three times when tested using various simulated weather conditions. This study raises concerns about driver liability if the technology does not activate emergency braking to reduce the impact.\n\nAdditionally, the same study disclosed that lane assistance might also not work during a heavy downpour. AAA’s analysis showed these devices failed 69% of the time when tested in the rain.\n\nDespite the high expectations for car safety technologies, manufacturers have yet to address several significant limitations, particularly concerning adverse weather conditions. The failure to conduct thorough testing of these systems in bad weather, coupled with the absence of alternative programming or settings for rain, could result in catastrophic accidents. In such cases, victims may have a claim against the vehicle’s manufacturer.\n\nGiven these limitations, it’s still essential for drivers to remain focused on the road. Remember, drivers know better than automatic systems.\n\nWho Is Liable For System Failures Or Errors On My Vehicle?\n\nCar manufacturers and developers of ADAS and ADS technology strictly follow the laws and regulations surrounding their business. However, they could also be held responsible if their safety driving systems fail and cause an accident. Should you decide to file a lawsuit against them, you can expect that their first answer to your car accident lawyer will be that you were the one who caused the accident.\n\nIn that case, your car accident attorney will collect any evidence that proves that it was their mistake that caused the accident. For example, your car’s electronic control module can help find system errors and show that you weren’t at fault. This technology can also help ensure that liable parties are held accountable.\n\nShould I Hire A Lawyer For My Car Accident?\n\nThe law does not require you to hire an attorney after a car accident. However, if you are seeking compensation, working with an established car accident lawyer can be beneficial. Many victims of car accidents choose to seek legal counsel and representation so that they can focus on their health and recovery while also pursuing legal action. The benefits don’t just stop there. When you hire an attorney for your car accident case, they will:\n\nHow Can I Find A Good Car Accident Lawyer?\n\nFinding a reputable car accident lawyer may seem overwhelming, but there are several strategies you can use to simplify your search. Start by seeking recommendations from friends, family, or colleagues who were in one and got a car accident lawyer to help them with their claim. They can provide valuable insights and recommendations based on their personal experiences.\n\nAdditionally, online directories and legal associations, such as the American Association for Justice, can list respected local car accident lawyers. Once you have a shortlist of potential lawyers, schedule consultations to discuss your case and assess their suitability.\n\nWhat Should I Ask A Car Accident Attorney?\n\nDuring a consultation with a car accident lawyer, it’s vital to ask relevant questions to evaluate their qualifications and determine if they are the right fit for your case. Here are some questions to consider:\n\nTech Can’t Stop Every Accident, But We’re Here To Help If You’re Injured In One\n\nMost vehicle-related innovations have one purpose: improving safety.
