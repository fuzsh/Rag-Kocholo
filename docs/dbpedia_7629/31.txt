José Joaquim Emerico Lobo de Mesquita was a Brazilian composer, music teacher, conductor and organist. He received his first music lessons (organ and music theory) from Father Manuel da Costa Dantas, who was organist and choirmaster at the church Nossa Senhora da Conceição in Serro. Soon after 1776 he went to Arraial do Tijuco (now Diamantina) to become organist and conductor at the cathedral Santo Antônio of Diamantina. On 17 January 1789 he entered the religious order Ordem Terceira de Nossa Senhora do Carmo. He founded a music school in this city and was appointed teacher of the art of music. In 1798 he worked in Vila Rica (now Ouro Preto) for the city mayor, and was also organist and choirmaster at the church Nossa Senhora do Pilar. He had a quarrel with the mayor and left for Rio de Janeiro, where he became organist of the Ordem Terceira do Carmo until his death, in April 1805.
