Born in 1868, Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita was a Dutch graphic artist. He was an artist of many talents, trying out even experimental techniques.

Around 1900, he produced batiks and block-printed fabrics, which were sold by the Amsterdam interior design stores â€™t Binnenhuis and De Woning.

In his collection at Wallsauce, see an abundance of striking art prints that will give any space the feature it deserves!
