INTRODUCTION Portuguese literature may be said to belong largely to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Europe can boast of no fresher and more charming early lyrics than those which slept forgotten ^ in the Vatican Library until the late Professor Ernesto Monaci published 11 Canzoniere Portoghese in 1875. And, to take a few more instances out of many, the poems of King Alfonso X, of extraordinary interest alike to historian and literary critic, first appeared in 1889 ; the plays of Gil Vicente were almost unknown before the Hamburg (1834) edition, based on the Gottin- gen copy of that of 1562 ; Sa de Miranda only received a definitive edition in 1885 ; the Cancioneiro Geral became accessible in the middle of the nineteenth century, when the three volumes of the Stuttgart edition were published ; the exquisite verses ^ of Sa de Meneses, which haunted Portuguese poetry for a century,^ then sank into oblivion till they were discovered by Dr. Sousa Viterbo in the Torre do Tombo.^ The abundant literature of popu- lar quadras^ fados, romances, contos has only begun to be collected in the last fifty years. In prose, the most important Leal Conselkeiro * of King Duarte 1 A few Portuguese sixteenth-century writers in touch with Italy may have known of their existence. But they were neglected as rusficas mitsas. The references to King Dinis as a poet by Antonio Ferreira and once in the Cancioneiro Geral 6.0 not of course imply that his poems were known and read. Andre de Resende seems to have been more interested in tracing an ancestor, Vasco Martinez de Resende, than in the poets among whom this ancestor figured (see C. MichaeUs de Vasconcellos, Randglosse XV in Ztft. fiir roni. Phil., XXV. 683). ^ Illud vero poeniation quod viilgo circumfertur de Lessa . . . nunc vera cum plurimum illud appelant . . .

Vetus, ii . 241), Del Buen Consejero (Faria e Sousa) ; correctly by Duarte Nunez de Leam. A Con- selheiro Fiel by Frei Manuel Guilherme (1658-1734) appeared in 1727. 14 INTRODUCTION was rediscovered in the Paris Bibliotheque Nationale and first printed in 1842, and Zurara's Cronica da Guine, lost even in the days of Damiao de Goes,^ similarly in 1841 ; Correa's Lendas da India remained in manuscript till 1858 ; so notable a book as King Joao I's Livro da Montaria appears only in the twentieth century, in an edition by Dr. Esteves Pereira, and the first trust- worthy text of a part of Fernam Lopez was published by Snr. Braamcamp Freire in 1915 ; D. Francisco Manuel de Mello, who at the end of his second Epanaphora wrote ' Se por Ventura tambem despois de meus dias acontece que algum vindouro honre ao meu nome quanto eu procuro etcrnizar e engrandecer 0 dos passados ', had to wait two and a half centuries before this debt was paid by Mr. Edgar Prestage.^ Even now no really complete history of Portuguese literature exists, but the first systematic work on the subject was written by Friedrich Bouterwek in 1804. Other histories have since appeared, and during the last half-century the ceaseless, ingenious, and enthusiastic studies of Dr. Theophilo Braga have sifted Portuguese literature, chiefly the poetry, in all directions, and a flood of light has been thrown on it by the works of D. Carolina Michaelis de Vasconcellos. Perhaps, therefore, one may be for- given for having been tempted to render some account of this ' new ' literature which continues to be so strangely neglected in England and other countries.^ Yet a quarter of a century hence would perhaps offer better conditions, and a summary written at the present time cannot hope to be complete or definitive. Every year new studies and editions appear, new researches and alluring theories and discoveries are made. The Lisbon Academy of Sciences during its long and honourable • De que nao ha noticia (Goes, Cronica de D. Joao, cap. 6). ' D. Francisco Manuel de Mello. Esbofo biographico. Coimbra, 1914, an admirably clear and very important work, in which much light from new documents is thrown on Mello's life. ' It would be interesting to know how many English-speaking persons have ever heard cf the great men and writers that were King Dinis, Fernam Lopez, Bcmardim Ribeiro, Diogo Bernardez, Heitor Pinto, Frei Thome de Jesus, Ferreira de Vasconcellos, Frei Luis de Sousa, Antonio Vieira, Manuel Bemardes. Their neglect has been largely due to the absence of good or easily available texts ; there is still nothing to correspond to the Spanish Biblioteca de Autores Espanoles or the many more modern Spanish collections. But is not even CamSes still ' an abused stranger ', as Mickle called him in 1776 ? INTRODUCTION 15 history ^ has rarely if ever rendered greater services — ' essential services' as Southey called them in 1803 — to Portuguese literature. A short history of that literature must, apart from unavoidable errors and omissions, do less than justice to many writers. In appropriating the words of Damiao de Goes, ' Haud ignari plurima esse a nobis omissa quibus Hispania ornatur et celebrari possit,' one may hope that Mr. Edgar Prestage, who has studied Portuguese literature for a quarter of a century,^ and whose ever-ready help and advice are here gratefully acknowledged, will eventually write a mellower history in several volumes and give their full due both to the classics and to contemporary authors and critics. No one can study Portuguese literature without becoming deeply indebted to D. Carolina Wilhelma Michaelis de Vasconcellos. Her concise history, contributed to Groeber's Grundriss (1894), necessarily forms the basis of subsequent studies, but indeed her work is as vast as it is scholarly and accurate, and the student finds himself constantly relying on her guidance. Even if he occasionally disagrees, he cannot fail to give her point of view the deepest attention and respect. Born in 1851, the daughter of Professor Gustav Michaelis, she has lived in Portugal during the last forty years and is the wife of the celebrated art critic, Dr. Joaquim de Vasconcellos (born in 1849). Her edition of the Cancioneiro da Ajuda (1904) is a masterpiece of historical re- construction and literary criticism, and her influence on Portuguese literature generally is as wide as her encouragement and assis- tance of younger scholars are generous.^ Femina, as was said of the Princess Maria, undequaque spectatissima et doctissima. Most of the works of Dr. Theophilo Braga are of too pro- visional a nature to be of permanent value, but a summary, Edade Medieval (1909), RenasceuQa (1914), Os Seiscentistas (1916), Os 1 See F. de Figueiredo, O que e a Acadeniia das Sciencias de Lisboa (1779- 191 5) in Revista da Historia. vol. iv, 191 5. * His valuable study on Zurara, which has not been superseded by any later work on the subject, is dated 1896. ' She has, indeed, laid the Portuguese people under an obligation which it vnW not easily redeem. That no formal recognition has been bestowed in England on her work (as in another field on that of Dr. Jose Leite de Vasconcellos, of Snr. Braamcamp Freire, and of the late Dr. Francisco Adolpho Coelho) is a striking example of our insularity. i6 INTRODUCTION Arcades (1918), gives his latest views. The best detailed criticism of the Hterature of the nineteenth century is that of Dr. Fidelino de FiGUEiREDO, Member of the Academy of Sciences and Editor of the Revista de Historia : Historia da Litteratura Romantica Portu- guesa (1913) and Historia da Litteratura Realista (1914). The only completely methodical history of Portuguese literature in existence is the brief manual by the learned ex- Rector of Coim- bra University, Dr. Joaquim Mendes dos Remedios : Historia da Literatura Portuguesa (5th ed., Coimbra, 1921), since it con- tains that rarity in Portuguese literature : an index.^ Dr. Figueiredo published a short essay in its general bibliography in 1914 [Bibliographia portuguesa de critica litteraria), largely increased in a new (1920) edition, but otherwise little has been done in this respect (apart from a few special authors). The bibliography attached to the present book- follows — longo intervallo — the lines of Professor James Fitzmaurice-Kelly's Biblio- graphie de VHistoire de la Litterature Espagnole (Paris, 1913). After its proved excellence it would, indeed, have been folly to adopt any other method. It has been thought advisable to add a list of works on popular poetry, folk-lore, &c. (since in no country are the popular and the written literatures more intimately connected), and of those concerning the Portuguese language. Unless energetic and persistent measures are taken to protect this language it will be hopeless to look for a great Portuguese hterature in the future. Yet with the gradually developing prosperity of Portugal and her colonics such expectations are not unfounded. A new poet may arise indigenous as Gil Vicente and technically proficient as Camoes. And in prose, if it is not allowed to sink into a mere verbiage of gallicisms, great writers may place Portuguese on a level with and indeed above the other Romance languages. The possibilities are so vast, the quarry ready to their hand so rich — the works of Manuel Bernardes, Antonio Vieira, Jorge Ferreira de Yasconcellos, Luis de Sousa, Joao de Lucena, Heitor Pinto, Arraez ; an immense mass of sermons [milhoes de sermonarios), » It does not include living ^vTiters. Its dates must be received with caution. * It has been found necessary to pubUsh the bibliography separately. INTRODUCTION 17 most of them in excellent Portuguese, as those of Ceita, Veiga, Feo, Luz, in which, as in a large number of political tracts, notably those of Macedo, intense conviction has given a glow and con- cision to the language ; old constituigoes, ordenagdes, and foros ^ ; technical treatises,^ folk-lore, popular phrases,^ proverbs. But unless a scholarly use of Portuguese be more generally imposed no masterpieces will be produced. The same holds good of Brazilian literature, which, although, or perhaps because, it has provided material for a history in two portly volumes (Sylvio Romero, Historia da Litter atur a Brazileira, 2nd ed., 1902-3), is here, with few exceptions, omitted. A supplementary chapter on modern Galician literature has been added, for although the language from which Portuguese parted only after the fourteenth century is now quite indepen- dent,* modern Galician is not more different from modern Portu- guese than is the language of the Cancioneiros with which Portu- guese literature opens. The Portuguese have always shown a strong aptitude for acquiring foreign languages, and the indi- vidual's gain has been the literature's loss. Jorge de Montemor, who con su Diana Enriquecio la lengua castellana, was not by any means the only Portuguese who wrote exclusively in Spanish, and others chose Latin. The reason usually given in either case was that Portuguese was less widely read.^ It was * e.g. King Sancho II's Foros da Guarda, printed, from a 1305 manuscript, in vol. V (1824) of the Collecfao de Ineditos, or the Foros de Santarem (1385). The Livro Vermelho do Senhor D. Affonso V , printed in the CollecQcio de Livros Ineditos, vol. iii (1793), is also full of interest. ' e. g. the fourteenth-century Livro de Cetreria of Pero Menino ; Mestre GiRALDo's Tratado das Enfermidades das Aves de Caga and Livro d' Alveitaria ; the Arte da Cavallaria de gineta e estardiota (1678) by Antonio Galvam de Andrade (161 3 ?-89) ; Correcgam de abusos introduzidos contra o verdadeiro methodo da medicina (2 pts., 1668-80) by the Carmelite Frei Manuel de Azevedo (11672); Agricultura das Vinhas (171 1) by Vicente Alarte (i.e. SiLVESTRE Gomez de Moraes (1643-1723)) ; Compendia de Botanica (2 vols., 1788) by Felix de Avellar Brotero (i 744-1 828). ' Many will be found in Portugalia and the Revista Lusitana. * In the beginning of the sixteenth century Galician is already despised in Portugal, and became more so as Portuguese grew more latinized. Cf. Gil Vicente, ii. 509 : Pera que he falar galego Sendo craro e despachado ? ; Chiado, Auto das Regateiras: Eu ndo te falo galego. ' For ser lingua mais jeral (Vera, Lovvores), mais universal (Sousa de 2362 B i8 INTRODUCTION a short-sighted view, for the more works of importance that were written in Portuguese the larger would naturally become the number of those who read them. While Portuguese literature may be taken to be the literature written in the Portuguese language, in a sense it must also include the Latin and Spanish works of Portuguese authors. Of the former, one collection alone, the Corpus Illustriiim Poetarum Lusitanorum qui latine scripserunt (Lisbonae, 1745), consists of eight volumes, and Domingo Garcia Peres' Catdlogo Razonado (Madrid, 1890) contains over 600 names of Portuguese authors who wrote in Spanish. Portuguese names present a difficulty, for often they are as lengthy as that which was the pride of Dona Iria in Ennes' 0 Saltimhanco. The course here adopted is to relegate the full name to the index and to print in the text only the form by which the writer is generally known. ^ The Portuguese, a proud and passionate people with a certain love of magnificence and adventure, an Athenian receptivity,^ an Macedo). Os grandes ingenios ndo se contentao de ter por espera de sen applauso a hiia s6 parte do tnundo (D. Francisco de Portugal). Cf. Osorio, writing in Latin, De Rebus, p. 4, and Pedro Nunez' reason for translating liis Libra de Algebra into Spanish : he mais comnm, and the advice given to Luis Marinho de Azevedo to write in Spanish or Latin as mais serai (Primeira Parte da Funda^ao, Antiguidades e Grandezas da mvi insigne cidade de Lisboa. Prologo). Faria e Sousa condemns the practice of writing Spanish glosas to a Portuguese mote, and declares that he himself wrote in Spanish con gran pesar mio. Frei Antonio da Purifica^am considered that had he written his Cronica in Latin or Spanish fora digno de grande nota, in this following Frei Bernardo de Brito, who indignantly rejected the exhortation to use Latin or Spanish {Mon. Lus. i, Prologo), although he wrote under Spanish rule. Bernarda Ferreira de Lacerda wrote in Spanish por ser idioma claro y casi comun. Simao Machado explains why he wrote Alfea in Spanish as follows (f. 72 v.) : Vendo quam mal aceitais As obras dos naturais Fiz esta em lingoa estrangeira Por ver se desta maneira Como a eles nos tratais. ' Portuguese spelling is a vexed and vexing question, complicated by the positive dislike of the Portuguese for uniformity (the same word may be found spelt in two ways on the same page both in modern and ancient books ; the same person will spell his name Manoel and Manuel). In proper names their owners' spelling has been retained, although no one now writes Prince Honry the Navigator's name as he wrote it : Anrique. Thus Mello (modern Melo) ; Nunez (13th c), Nunes (19th c.) ; Bernardez (i6th c), Bernardes (i7th-i8th c). The late Dr. Gon9alves Vianna himself adopted the form Gon^alvez Viana. In quoting ancient Portuguese texts the only alteration made has been occa.sionally to replace y and i< by i and v, ' Este desejo {de sempre ver e ouvir cousas nouas) he moor que nas outras nafdes na gente Lusitana. Andre de Burgos, Ao prudente leitor {Relafam, Evora, 1557). It is displayed in their fondness for foreign customs, for the Spanish language, for India to the neglect of Portugal, the description of INTRODUCTION ig extensive sea-board and vague land-frontiers, naturally came under foreign influences. Many and various causes made their country cosmopolitan from the beginning. It is customary to divide Portuguese literature into the Provencal (13th c), Spanish (14th and 15th c), Italian (i6th c), Spanish and Italian (17th c), French and English (i8th c), French and German (19th c.) Schools. The question may therefore be asked, especially by those who con- fuse influence with imitation, as though it precluded originality : What has Portuguese literature of its own } In the first place, the Celtic satire and mystic lyrism of the Galicians is developed and always present in Portuguese literature. Secondly, the genius for story- telling, displayed by Fernam Lopez, grew by reason of the great Portuguese discoveries in Africa and Asia to an epic grandeur both in verse and prose. Thirdly, the absence of great cities, the pleasant climate, and fertile soil produced a peculiarly realistic and natural bucolic poetry. And in prose, besides masterpieces of history and travel — a rich and fascinating literature of the East and of the sea — a fervent religious faith, as in Spain, with a more constant mysticism than in Spain, led to very high achievement. Had one to choose between the loss of the works of Homer, or Dante, or Shakespeare, and that of the whole of Portuguese literature, the whole of Portuguese literature must go, but that is not to say that the loss would not be very grievous. Indeed, those who despise Portuguese literature despise it in ignorance,^ affecting to believe, with Edgar Quinet, that it has but one poet and a single book ; those who are acquainted with it — with the early lyrics, with the quaintly alluring eclogues of Ribeiro and Sa de Miranda, with the works of Fernam Lopez, described by Robert Southey as ' the best chronicler of any age or nation ', nai'f, exact, touchant et philosophe^; of Gil Vicente, almost as far above his contemporary Juan del Enzina as^Shakespeare is above Vicente ; of Bernardim Ribeiro, whose Menina e moga is the earliest and best of those pastoral romances which led Don Quixote to contemplate a quieter epic deeds rather than of ordinary life, high-flown language as opposed to the common speech {da pra(a), &c. Antonio Prestes calls the Portuguese estranho no natural, natural no estranjeiro. * In Spain it has had fervent admirers, notably Gracian. More recently Juan Valera spoke of it as riquisima, and Menendez y Pelayo explored this wealth, * F. Denis, Resumi (1R26), p. xx.

Unhappily the Portuguese, with a noto- rious carelessness,^ have in the past set the example of neglecting their literature, and even to-day scarcely seem to realize their great possessions and still greater possibilities in the realm of prose.* The excessive number of writers, the excessive production of each individual writer, and the desleixo by which innumerable books and manuscripts of exceptional interest have perished, are all traceable to the same source: the lack of criticism. A nation of poets, essentially lyrical,^ with no dramatic genius but capable of writing charmingly and naturally without apparent effort, needed and needs a severely classical education and stern critics, to remind them that an epic is not rhymed history nor blank verse mangled prose, that in bucolic poetry the half is greater than the whole, and to bid them abandon abstractions for the ' Wilhelm Storck, Luis de Camoens' Sammtliche Werke, Bd. I (1880). * Dorothy Osborne to Sir William Temple. * For a good instance of this descuido portugues see Manuel Pereira de Novaes, Anacrisis Historial (a history of the city of Oporto in Spanish), vol. i (1912), Predmhulo, p. xvii. It is lamented by the editors of the Cancioneiro Geral (15 16) and Fenix Renascida (17 16). * Portuguese literature begins for most Portuguese with Camoes and Barros, and its most charming and original part thus escapes them. Cf. F. Dias Gomes, Obras Poeticas (1799), p. 143: Camoes 'without whom there would have been no Portuguese poetry ' ; and ibid., p. 310 : Barros ' prepared the beautiful style for our epic writers '. Faria e Sousa's homely phrase as to the effect of Camoes on preceding poets (echdlos todos a rodar) was unfortunately true. ' Much of their finest prose is of lyrical character, personal, fervent, mystic. As to philosophy proper the greatest if not the only Portuguese philosopher, Spinoza, a Portuguese Jew, left Portugal as a child, and Francisco Sanchez (c. 1550-C. 1620), although probably born at Braga, not at a soberba Tuy, lived in France and wrote in Latin. He tells us that he in 1574 finished his celebrated treatise Quod nihil scittir, published at Lyon in 1581, in which, at a time of great intolerance, he revived and gave acute and curious expression to the old theory that nothing can be known. To modern philosophy Dr. Leonardo Coimbra (born in 1883) has contributed a notable but somewhat abstruse work entitled O Criacionismo (Porto, 191 2). INTRODUCTION 21 concrete and particular and crystallize the vague flow of their talent. But in Portugal, outside the circle of writers themselves, a reading public has hitherto hardly existed, and in the close atmosphere resulting the sense of proportion was inevitably lost, even as a stone and a feather will fall with equal speed in a vacuum. The criticism has been mainly personal,^ contesting the originality or truthfulness of a writer, without considering the literary merits of his work. To deprecate such criticism became a commonplace of the preface, while numerous passages in writers of the sixteenth century show that they feared their countrymen's scepticism, expressed in the proverb De longas vias mui longas mentiras, which occurs as early as the thirteenth century.- The fear of slovenly or prolix composition was not present in the same degree. But these are defects that may be remedied partly by individual critics, partly by the increasing number of readers. Meanwhile this little book may perhaps serve to corroborate the poet Falcao de Resende's words : Engenhos nascem bons na Lusitania E ha copia delles.^ ' Or political, or anticlerical, or anything except literary. The critics seem to have forgotten that an auto-da-fS does not necessarily make its victim a good poet, and that even a priest may have literary talent. A few literary critics, as Dias in the eighteenth, Guilherme Moniz Barreto in the nineteenth century, are only exceptions to the rule. It has been the weakness of Portuguese criticism, more lenient than the gods and booksellers of ancient Rome, to suffer mediocres gladly. - C. da Vat. 979 (cf. Jorge Ferreira, Eufrosina, v. 5 : como dizia 0 Galego : de longas vias longas mentiras). * Poesias, Sat. 2. The remark of Garrett still holds good : Em Portugal ha mats talento e menos cultivafao que em paiz nenhum da Europa. ii85 1 ^ -1325 §1 The C OSS antes Under the Moorish dominion we know that poetry was widely cultivated in the Iberian Peninsula, by high and low. At Silves in Algarve ' almost every peasant could improvise ' } But the early Galician-Portuguese poetry has no relation with that of the Moors, despite certain characteristics which may seem to point to an Oriental origin. The indigenous poems of Galicia and Portugal, of which thirteenth-century examples have sur- vived, are so remarkable, so unlike those of any other country, that they deserve to be studied apart from the Provencal imita- tions by the side of which they developed. Half buried in the Cancioneiros, themselves only recently discovered, these ex- quisite and in some ways astonishingly modern lyrics are even now not very widely known and escape the attention of many who go far' afield in search of true poetry. The earliest poem dated (1189) by D. Carolina Michaelis de Vasconcellos, in which Pay Soarez de Taveiroos, a nobleman of Galicia or North Portugal, addresses Maria Paez Ribeira, the lovely mistress of King Sancho I, 7nia semior branca e vermelha, does not belong to these lyrics^; but the second earliest (1199), attributed to King Sancho I (1185-1211) himself, is one of them (C. C. B. 348). This unique form of lyric requires a distinctive name, and if we adopt that used by the Marques de Santillana's father, Diego Furtado de Mendoza(ti404), we shall have a word well suited to convey an idea of their striking character.^ HisSpanishpoem written in parallel ' Kazwini ap. Keinhart Dozy, Spanish Islam, trans. F. G. Stokes, London, 1913, p. 663. * C. A. 38. It is a cantiga de meestria, of two verses, each of eight octo- syllabic lines (ahbaccde bfhaccde). ' Although neither Knglish nor Portuguese, it is a name for these poems, of lines pariler plangtnles, less clumsy than parallelistic songs adopted by THE COSSANTES 23 distichs, A aquel arhol; is called a cossante} In an age when all that seemed most Spanish, the Poema del Cid, for instance, or the Lihro de Buen Amor, has been proved to derive in part from French sources, it is peculiarly pleasant to find a whole series of early poems which have their roots firmly planted in the soil of the Peninsula. The indigenous character of the cossantes is now well established, thanks chiefly to the skilful and untiring re- searches of D. Carolina Michaelis de Vasconcellos.- They are wild but deliciously scented single flowers which now reappear in all their freshness as though they had not lain pressed and dead for centuries in the library of the Vatican. One of the earliest is quoted by Airas Nunez (C. V. 454) and completed in Grundriss, p. 150 : 1. Solo ramo verde frolido Vodas fazen a meu amigo, E choran olhos d'amor. 2. Solo verde frolido ramo * Vodas fazen a meu amado, E choran olhos d'amor. What first strikes one in this is its Oriental immobility. The second distich adds nothing to the sense of the first, merely intensifying it by repetition. Neither the poetry of the trouveres of the North of France nor that of the Vro\\ex\\(;di\\ troubadours presents any parallel. The scanty Basque literature contains Professor Henry R. Lang (who also uses the words serranas — but see C. D. L., p. cxxxviii, note 2 ; Dr. Theophilo Braga had called them serranilhas — and Verkettimgslieder), Parallelstrophenlieder (D. Carolina Michaelis de Vas- concellos), cantigas parallelisticas (D. Carolina Michaelis de Vasconcellos and Snr. J. J. Nunes), chansons a ripSHtions (M. Alfred Jeanroy). Cantos dualisticos, cantos de danza prima, and bailadas encadeadas have also been proposed . * Perhaps = rhyme (consoante), but more probably it is derived from cosso, an enclosed place, which would be used for dancing : cf . Cristobal de Castillejo, Madre, un caballero Que estaba en este cosso (bailia). In the Relacion de los fechos del mui magnifico e mas virtuoso senor el senor Don Miguel Lucas [de Iramo] mui digno Condestable de Castilla, p. 446 (a.d. 1470), occurs the following passage : Y despues de danzar cantaron un gran rato de cosante (Memorial Histdrico Espanol, torn, viii, Madrid, 1855). Rodrigo Cota, in the Didlogo entre el Amor y un Viejo, has dangas y corsantes, and Anton de Montoro (el Ropero) asks un portugues que vido vestido de muchos colores if he is a can- tador de corsante (v. 1. cosante) {Cane. General, ed. Bibliof . Esp., ii. 270, no. 1018). 2 In the Grundriss (1894), Randglossen (i 896-1905), and especially vol. ii of the Cancioneiro da Ajuda (1904). * Or Solo ramo verde granado : the green branch in (red) flower. 24 I185-1325 nothing in this kind. But it is unnecessary to go for a parallel to China.^ None more remarkable will be found than those contained in the books of that religion which came from the East and imposed its forms if not its spirit on the pagans of the Peninsula. Verses 8, 9 of Psalm 118 are very nearly a. cossante but have no refrain. The resemblance in Psalm 136, verses 17, 18, is still more marked : To him which smote great kings, For his mercy endureth for ever, And slew famous kings, For his mercy endureth for ever. The relations between Church and people were very close if not always very friendly. The peasants maintained their ancient customs, and their pagan jollity kept overflowing into the churches to the scandal of the authorities. Innumerable ordi- nances later sought to check their delight in witchcraft and mummeries, feasts and funerals (the delight in the latter is still evident in Galicia as in Ireland and Wales). Men slept, ate, drank, danced, sang profane songs, and acted plays and parodies in the churches and pilgrimage shrines. The Church strove to turn their midsummer and May-day celebrations into Christian festivals, but the change was rather nominal than real. But if the priests and bishops remained spiritually, like modern politicians, shepherds without sheep, the religious services, the hymns, ^ the processions evidently affected the people. Especially was this the case in Galicia, since the great saint Santiago, who farther south (as later in India) rode into battle on a snow-white ' Translations of Chinese poems resembling the cossanies are given by Dr. Theophilo Braga, C. V. B., Introd., p. ci, and Professor H. R. Lang, C. D. L., Introd., p. cxlii. A Proven9al poem with resemblance to a cossante is printed in Bartsch, p. 62 : Li tensz est bels, les vinnesz sont flories. * Any one who has heard peasants at a Stabat singing the hymn Stabat Mater dolorosa Jussa crussa larimosa Du penebat Filius realizes that the words for them have no meaning, but that they will long remember tune and rhythm. Compare, for the form, the Latin hymn to the Virgin by the Breton poet Adam de Saint Victor (tii77) : Salve Verbi sacra parens, Flos de spinis spinis carens, Flos spineti gloria. THE COSSANTES 25 steed before the Christians, gave a more peaceful prosperity to the North-west. Pilgrims from all countries in the Middle Ages came to worship at his shrine at Santiago de Compostcla. They came a motley company singing on the road,^ criminals taking this opportunity to escape from justice, tradesmen and players, jugglers and poets making a livelihood out of the gathering throngs, as well as devout pilgrims who had ' left alle gamys ' for their soul's good, des pelerins qui vont chantant et des jongleurs. Thus the eyes of the whole province of Galicia as the eyes of Europe were directed towards the Church of Santiago in Jakobsland. The inhabitants of Galicia would naturally view their heaven-sent celebrity with pride and rejoice in the material gain. They would watch with eager interest the pilgrims passing along the camino frances or from the coast to Santiago, and would themselves flock to see and swell the crowds at the religious services. When we remember the frequent parodies of religious services in the Middle Ages and that the Galicians did not lag behind others in the art of mimicry,^ we can well imagine that the Latin hymns sung in church or procession might easily form the germ of the profane cossante. A further characteristic of the cossante is that the z-sound of the first distich is followed by an a-sound in the second [ricercando ora il grave, ora Vacuto) and this too maybe traced to a religious source, two answering choirs of singers, treble and bass.^ It is clear at least that these alter- ' Cf. Luis Jose Veldzquez, Origenes de la Poesia Castellana (Malaga, 1754) ap. C. M. (1889), i. 168 : las cantares y canciones devotas de los peregrinos que iban en romeria a visitar la iglesia de Compostela mantuvieron en Galicia el gusto de la poesia en tiempos bdrbaros. A Latin hymn composed in the twelfth century by Aimeric Picaud is printed in Recuerdos de un Viaje a Santiago de Galicia por el P. Fidel Fita y D. Aureliano Fernandez-Guerra (Madrid, 1880), p. 45 : Jacobi Gallecia Opem rogat piam Glebe cujus gloria Dat insignem viani Ut precum frequentia Cantet melodiam. Herru Sanctiagu / Grot Sanc- tiagu / Eultreja esuseja ! Deus, adjuva nos ! ^ Cf. Simao de Vasconcellos, Cronica da Companhia de Jesu do Estado do Brazil (1549-62), 2nd ed. (1865), Bk. I, § 22 : chegamos a huma praga [in Santiago de Compostela] onde vimos hum ajuntamento de mulheres Gallegas com grande risada e galhofa ; e querendo 0 irmdo meu companheiro pedir-lhe esmola vio que estavdo todas ouvindo a huma que feita pregadora arremedava, como por zombaria, o sermao que eu tinha pregado. ' One has but to watch a Rogation procession passing through the fields in the Basque country (which until recently preserved customs of immemorial eld and still calls the Feast of Corpus Christi, introduced by Pope Urban IV in 1262, ' the New Feast — Festa Berria ') to realize the singularly impressive 26 I185-1325 nating sounds are echoes of music : one almost hears the clash of the adiife in the lougana (answering to garrida) or ramo (pinho). The words of these poems were, indeed, always accompanied by the son {= music). But if born in the Church, the cossante suffered a transformation when it went out into the world. The rhythm of many of the songs in the Cancioneiros is so obtrusive that they seem to dance out of the printed page. One would like to think that in the ears of the peasants the sound of the wheel mingled with the echo of a hymn and its refrain as they met at what was, even then, no doubt, a favourite gathering-place — the mill ^ — and thus a lyric poem became a dance-song. The cossante Solo ramo would thus proceed, sung by ' the dancers dancing in tune ' : (Verses 3 and 4) Vodas fazen a meu amigo (amado) Porque mentiu o desmentido (perjurado) E choran olhos d'amor, the first line of the third distich repeating the second line of the first (and in the same way the first line of the fifth the second line of the third), in leixa-pren [laisser prendre) corresponding evidently to the movements of the dance. '^ The love-lorn maidens danced together, the men forming a circle to look on. St. Augus- tine considered the dance to be a circle of which the Devil was the centre ; in real life the Devil was often replaced by a tree (or by a mayo). The refrain was a notable feature of the cossante in all its phases as it went, a bailada (dance-song) from the terreiro, to become a serranilha on the hills, or at pilgrimage shrines a cantiga de romaria,^ or a harcarola (boat-song) or alvorada (dawn- efifect of the singing, first the girls' treble Ave Ave Ave Maria, Ave Ave Ave Maria, then the answering bass of the men far behind, Ave Ave Ave Maria, Ave Ave Ave Maria (with the slow ringing of the church bell for a refrain like the contemplando and tan callando in the Coplas de Manrique). ' Cf. Gil Vicente, Tambor em cada moinho. It is a curious coincidence that the word citola (the jogral's fiddk ) = mill-clapper. Cf. also moinante in Galicia = picaro. * Cf. the Icixapren and refrain of the cantiga danced and sung at the end of Gil Vicente's Romagem de Aggravados (Por Maio era, par Maio). The parallelism and leixapren are present also in religious poems by Alfonso X : C. M. 160, 250, 260. Snr. J.J. Nunes has noted that in motkrn peasant dances, accompanied with song, the dancers sometimes pause while the refrain is sung. » C. V. contains many striking pilgrimage songs, sometimes wrongly called THE COSSANTES 27 song). A marked and thoroughly popular characteristic of the cossante is its wistful sadness/ the soidade which is already men- tioned more than once in the Cancioneiros,^ and, born in Galicia, continued in Portugal, combined with a more garish tone under the hotter sun of the South. Thus we have the melancholy Celtic temperament, absorbed in Nature, acting on the forms suggested by an alien religion till they become vague cries to the sea, to the deer of the hills, the flower of the pine. The themes are as simple and monotonous — the monotony of snowdrops or daffodils — as the form in which they are sung. A girl in the gloom of the pine-trees mourning for her lover, the birds in the cool of the morn- ing singing of love, the deer troubling the water of a mountain- stream, the boats at anchor, or bearing away mens amores, or gliding up the river a sahor. The amiga lingers at the fountain, she goes to wash clothes or to bathe her hair in the stream, she meets her lover and dances at the pilgrim shrine, she waits for him under the hazel-trees, she implores the waves for news of him, she watches for the boats pelo mar viir. The language is native to the soil, far more so, at least, than in the cantigas de amor and cantigas de amigo written under foreign influence. Their French or Provencal words and learned forms ^ are replaced in the cossante by forms Galician or Spanish. Despite its striking appearance to us now among sirventes senes sal in the Cancioneiro Colocci-Brancuti, it must be confessed that the early cossante of King Sancho has a somewhat meagre, vinegar aspect, and the genre could hardly have developed so successfully in the next half-century had it not been fixed in the country-side, ever ready to the hand of the poet in search of fresh inspiration. It is possible to exaggerate the effect of war on the life of the peasant. Portugal in the twelfth century was only gradually and by constant conflict winning its territory and independence. It had no fixed capital and Court at which the Provengal poets cantigas de ledino. The word probably originated in a printer's error (de ledino for dele dino) in a line of Chrisfal : canton canto de ledino. » Cf. the wailing refrains of C. V. 415, 417 ; and, for the form, compare e de mi, lougana ! with ; ay de mi, Alfama ! In the sense of the two refrains lies all the difference between the poetry of Portugal and Spain. » C. C. B. 135 (= C. A. 389) ; C. V. 119, 181, 220, 527, 758, 964. * Endurar, besonha, greu, gracir, cousir, escarnir, toste, entendedor, veiro (varius, Fr. vair, CM. 213 has egua veira), genta (genser, gensor). 28 I185-1325 might gather. But while king and nobles and the members of the religious and military orders were engaged with the [Moors to the exclusion of the Muses, so that they had no opportunity to introduce the new measures, the peasants in Galicia and Minho no doubt went on tilling the soil and singing their primitive songs. In the thirteenth century Provengal poetry flourished in Portugal, but so monotonously that it failed to kill the older lyrics, and they reacted on the imported poetry. In the trite conventions with which the latter became clothed the cossante had a new oppor- tunity of life. Trohadores wearied by their own monotony, jograes wishing to please a patron with a novidade, had recourse to the cossante. The jogral wandering from house to house and town to town necessarily came into close touch with the peasants. Talented men among them, prompted by patrons of good taste, no doubt exercised the third requisite of a good jogral [doair' e uoz e aprenderdes hen, C. C. B. 388) — a good memory — not only in learning his patron's verses to recite at other houses but in re- membering the songs that he caught in passing from the lips of the peasants, songs of village mirth and dance, of workers in the fields and shepherds on the hills. These, developed and adorned according to his talent, he would introduce to the Court among his motz recreamens e prazers. When Joan de Guilhade in the middle of the thirteenth century complained that os trohadores ja van para mal (C. V. 370), he might almost be referring to the fact that the stereotyped poems of the Portuguese trohadores could no longer compete with the fresh charm of the cossante. Alfonso X reproached Pero da Ponte for not singing like a Pro- vengal but, rather, like Bernaldo de Bonaval (first half 13th c). King Dinis in the second half of the century viewed the cossante with such favour that he wrote or collected some of the most curious and delightful that we possess. But although King Dinis set his name to a handful of the finest cossantes, most of the cossante-v^nttrs, belonged to an earlier period and were men of humble birth. Of Nuno Fernandez Torneol^ (first half 13th c), poet and soldier, besides conventional cantigas de amor we have eight simple cossantes of which the alvorada (C. V. 242), the har- carola (C. V. 246), and C. V. 245 with its dance rhythm are » C. V. 242-51, 979 ; C. C. B. 159-71 (= C. A. 70-81, 402). THE COSSANTES 29 especially beautiful. Pedr' Anez Solaz* (early 13th c.) wrote a cossante (C. V. 415) celebrated for its refrain, lelia doura, leli leli par deus leli, in which some have seen a vestige of Basque {il = dead). Of Meendinho (first half 13th c.) we have only one poem, a cantiga de romaria (C, V, 438), but its beauty has brought him fame ; ^ and another jogral, Fernand' Esguio ^ (second half 13th c), is remembered in the same way chiefly for C. V. 902 : Vayamos, irmana. Bernaldo de Bonaval, one of the earliest Galician poets, and the jograes Pero de Veer, Joan Servando, Airas Carpancho,* Martin de Ginzo,^ Lopo and Lou- rengo, composed some charming pilgrimage songs in the second third of the thirteenth century. This was a popular theme, but the two poets who seem to have felt most keenly the attraction of the popular poetry and to have cultivated it most successfully are Joan Zorro (fi. 1250) and Pero Meogo (fl. 1250). The cossantes of Zorro, one of the most talented of all these singers, tell of Lisbon and the king's ships and the sea. In this series of barcarolas (C. V. 751-60) and in his delightful bailada (C. V. 761) ^ he evidently sought his inspiration in popular sources, as with equal felicity a little later did Pero Meogo,' whose cossantes (C. V. 789-97), each with its biblical reference to the deer of the hills [cervos do monte), are as singular as they are beautiful. Martin Codax at about the same time was singing graceful songs of the ondas do mar of Vigo (C. V. 884-90). But the real poet of the sea was the Admiral of Castille, Pay Gomez Charino ® (■|\"i295). He belonged to an ancient family of Galicia, was > c. V. 414-16, 824-s ; c. A. 281. 2 Meen di nho in the C. V. M. index. Thus he is scarcely even a name. ' Or Esquio (? = esquilo, 'squirrel '). « Or Corpancho (Broade) or Campancho (Broadacre) ; but the word carpancho (= basket) exists in the region of Santander {La Montana). There is a modem Peruvian poet Manuel Nicolas Corpancho (1830-63). * This is the most probable form of his name, although modern critics have presented him with various others. * M. Alfred Jeanroy (Les Origines, 2^ ed., 1904, p. 320) compares with this bailada the fragments Tuit cil qui sunt enamouraf Vignent dangar, li autre non and N'en nostra compaignie ne soit nus S'il n'est amans, but even if there was direct imitation here, which is doubtful, that would not affect the indigenous character of the cossantes. ' Or, according to D. C. Michaelis de Vasconcellos, Moogo (from monachus). Meogo (= meio) occurs in C. M. 65 and 161, moogo (= monk) in C. M. 75 and 149. « C. V. 392-402, 424-30, 1 1 58-9; C. A. 246-56. Chariiio is buried at Pontevedra, in the Franciscan convent which he founded. 30 I185-1325 prominent at the Courts of Alfonso X (between whose character and the sea he draws an elaborate parallel in C. A. 256) and of his son Sancho IV, played an important part in the troubled history of the time, and fought by land and sea in Andalucia, at Jaenini246 andSevilleini247. On the lips of his amz'g'a he places a touching cantiga de amigo (C. V. 424 : she expresses her relief that her amigo has ceased to be almirante do mar ; no longer will she listen in sadness to the wind, now her heart may sleep and not tremble at the coming of a messenger) and the two sea cossantes C. V. 401, with its plaining refrain : E van-se as frores d'aqui ben con mcus amores, idas son as frores d'aqui ben con mcus amores, — one can imagine it sung as a chanty ^ — and C. V. 429, in which she prays Santiago to bring him safely home : ' Now in this hour 'Over the sea He is coming to me. Love is in flower.' Beauty of expression and a loyal sincerity are conspicuous in his poems, as well as a certain individuality and vigour. He escaped the perils of the sea, the miii gran coita do mar (C. A. 251), but to fall by the hand of an assassin on shore. His sea lyrics are only excelled by the enchanting melody of the poem (C. V. 488) of his con- temporary and fellow-countryman Roy Fernandez (second half 13th c), who was apparently a professor at Salamanca University, Canon of Santiago, and Chaplain to Alfonso the Learned. Of the later poets Estevam Coelho, perhaps father of one of the assassins of Ines (ti355), wrote a cossante of haunting beauty (C. V. 321) : Sedia la fremosa, seu sirgo torcendo, Sa voz manselinha fremoso dizendo Cantigas d'amigo, and D. Afonso Sanchez {c. 1285-1329) in C. V. 368 {Dizia la fremosinha — Ay Deus val) proved that he had inherited part of his father King Dinis' genius and instinct for popular poetry. King Dinis, having thrown wide his palace doors to these thyme- scented lyrics, would turn again to the now musty chamber of Provengal song (C. V. 123) : Quer'eu en maneira de provengal Fazer agora un cantar d'amor. ' Cf. the modern Ai U 16 U, marinheiro vira a ri or Ai IS U U Rihamar e S. Josi. THE COSSANTES 31 The cossantes had become so familiar that Airas Nunez, of Santiago, could string them together, as it were, by the head, without troubling himself to givemore than the first lines, precisely as Gil Vicente treated romances three centuries later. The reader or listener would easily complete them. His pastorela (C. V. 454) would be an ordinary imitation of a pastourelle of the trouveres ^ were it not for the five cossante fragments inserted. Riding along a stream he hears a solitary shepherdess singing and stays to listen. First she sang Solo ramo verde frolido,^ then — as if to prove that she is a shepherdess of Arcady, not of real life — Ay, estornino do avelanedo, Cantades vos e moir'eu e peno, D'amores ei mal, an impassioned cry of the heart only comparable with Thine earth now springs, mine fadeth : Thy thorn without, my thorn my heart invadeth ; or that wonderful line of a wonderful poem : Ilia cantat, nos tacemus : quando ver venit meum ? ^ Next she sang the first lines of a cossante by Nuno Fernandez Torneol (C. V. 245) with its dance refrain E pousarei solo avelanal. The refrain is identical in C. V. 245 and C. V. 454, but the distich has variations which seem to imply that Airas Nunez was not quoting Fernandez, rather that both drew from a popular source. The fourth cossante we also have complete, a lovely harcarola by Joan Zorro (C. V. 757) : Pela ribeira do rio (alto) Cantando ia la dona virgo (d'algo) D'amor : Venhan as barcas pelo rio A sabor.* ' For later reminiscences of the pastorela see C. Michaelis de Vasconcellos, Jodo LourenQo da Ctinha, a ' Flov de Altura ' e a cantiga Ay Donas por que em tristura ?

' A modern Portuguese quatrain runs Passarinho que cantaes Nesse raminho de flores, Cantae vos, chorarei eu : Assim faz quem tern amores. * By the margin of a river Went a maiden singing, ever Of love sang she : 32 I185-1325 Lastly she (or he), as he rides on his way, sings : Quen amores ha Como dormira, Ai bela fror ! i.e. este cantar which is familiar in the villancico [Por una gentil floresta) by the Marques de Santillana (1398-1458) : La nifia que amores ha I Sola como dormira ? Very few, if any, of the cossantes were anonymous, which only means that modern folk-lore was unknown; it was not the fashion to collectsongs from the lips of the people withoutulteriorpurpose. A variety known as cantiga de vildos existed, but it was deliber- ately composed by the trohadores and jograes} A specimen is given in C. V. 1043 : O pee d'hQa torre Baila corpo piolo,^ Vedes o cos, ay cavaleiro. No drawing-room lyric, evidently : more likely to be sung in taverns ; composed perhaps by a knight like him of C. V. 965, whose songs were not fremosos e rimados. Like the Provencal poet Guilherme Figueira who mout se fetz grazir . . . als ostes et als taverniers, this knight's songs pleased ' tailors, furriers and millers ' ; they had not the good taste of the tailor's wife in Gil Vicente who sings the beautiful cantiga Donde vindes filha Branca e colorida? The cantiga de vildos was no such simple popular lyric, but rather a drinkers' song, picaresquely allusive, sung by a jogral who non fo horn que saubes caber entre Hs baros ni entre la bona gen but sang vilmen et en gens bassas, entre gens bassas per pauc d'aver (Riquier), cantares de que la gente baja e de servil condicion se alegra (Santillana). The cossante, on the contrary, came straight from field and hill into palace and song-book. Probably Up the stream the boats came gliding Gracefully. All along the river-bent The fair maiden singing went Of love's dream : Fair to see the boats came gliding Up the stream. * Poetica (C. C. B., p. 3, 11. 50-1). ' It probablyjdoes not rhyme (e morre or corre) purposely. D. Carolina Michaelis de Vasconcellos proposes ^raci'oso or friolo (A Saudade Portuguesa, Porto, 1914, pp. 84, 140). THE COSSANTES 33 many of them were composed, as they were sung, and sung danc- ing, by the women. The women of Galicia have always been noted for their poetical and musical talent. We read of the choreas psalleritiiim mulierum, like Miriam, the sister of Moses, at Santiago in 1116,^ and there is a cloud of similar witnesses. But whether any of the cossantes that we have in the Cancio- neiros is strictly of the people or not, their traditional indigenous character is no longer doubtful. It would surely be a most astounding fact had the Galician-Portuguese Court poets, who in their cantigas de amor reduced Provencal poetry to a colourless insipidity, succeeded so much better with the cossantes that, while the originals from which they copied have vanished, the imita- tions stand out in the Portuguese Cancioneiros like crimson poppies among corn. It is remarkable, too, that of the three kinds of poem in the old Cancioneiros, satire, love song, and cossante, the first two remain in the Cancioneiro de Resende (1516), but the third has totally disappeared. The explanation is that as Court and people drew apart and the literary influence of Castille\" grew, the poems based on songs of the people were no longer in favour. But they continued, like the Guadiana, underground, and D. Carolina Michaelis de Vasconcellos has traced their occasional reappearances in poets of popular leanings, like Gil Vicente and Cristobal de Castillejo, from the thirteenth century to the present day,^ while Dr. Leite de Vasconcellos has discovered whole cossantes sung by peasants at their work in the fields in the nineteenth century.^ Dance or action always accom- panies the cossante as it does in the danza prima of Asturias (to the words Ay un galan d'esta villa, ay un galan d'esta casa)* If it * Espana Sa-^rada, xx. 211. \" C. A. M. V. ii. 928-36. Almeida Garrett had written in a general sense : 05 vestigios d'essa poesia indigena ainda duram (Revista Univ. Ltsbonense, vol. V (1846), p. 843). ' At Rebordainhos, in Tras-os-Montes, e.g. Na ribeirinha ribetra Naquella ribeira Anda Id nm peixinho vivo (bravo) Naquella ribeira. Other examples of the i-a sequence are amigo (amado), cosido (assado), villa (praga), ermida (oraga), linda (clara), Abril (Natal), ceitil (real). See J. Leite de Vasconcellos, Annnario para 0 estudo das tradigoes populares portnguezas (Porto, 1882), pp. 19-24. Cf. the modem Asturian song with its refrain ; Ay Juana cuerpo garrido, ay Juana cuerpo galano ! * Francisco Alvarez, Verd. Inf., p. 125, speaks of cantigas de bailhos e de terreiro (dance-songs). 2362 C 34 I185-1325 be objected that the songs printed by Dr. Leite de Vasconcellos are rude specimens by the side of a poem like Ay flores, ay flores do verde pinko, it should be remembered that the quadra (or perhaps one should say distich without refrain) has now replaced the cossante on the lips of the people, and that among these quatrains something of the old cossante' s charm and melancholy is still found. D. Carolina Michaelis de Vasconcellos and others have remarked that these quadras pass from mouth to mouth and are perfected in the process, smoothed and polished like a stone by the sea, and this may well have been true of the earlier cossantes?- The jogral who hastened to his patron with a lovely new poem was but reaping the inspiration of a succession of anonymous singers, an inspiration quickened by competition in antiphonies of song at many a pilgrimage. One singer would give a distich of a cossante, as to-day a quadra, another would take it up and return it with variations. The cossante did not always preserve its simple form, or, rather, the more complicated poems renewed themselves in its popularity. We find it as a hailada (C. V. 761), balleta (cf. C. A. 123 : Se vos eu amo mats que outra ren), as cantiga de amor (C. A. 360 or 361, C. V. 657- 60), cantiga de maldizer (C. V. 1026-7), or satirical alba (C. V. 1049). But these hybrid forms are not the true cossante, which is always marked by dignity, restraint, simple grace, close communion with Nature, delicacy of thought, and a haunting felicity of expression. The cossante written by King Sancho seems to indicate a natural development of the indigenous poetry. In its form it owed nothing to the poetry of Provence or North France, but its progress was perhaps quickened, and at least its perfection preserved, by the systematic cultivation of poetry introduced from abroad at a time when no middle class separated Court and peasant. The tantalizing frag- ments that survive in Gil Vicente's plays show all too plainly what marvels of popular song might flower and die unknown. In spirit the original grave religious character of the cossante may in some measure have affected the new poetry. To this ' Cf. Barros, Dial, em lovvor da nossa ling., 1785 ed., p. 226: Pois as cantigas composlas do povo, sent cabega, sent pees, sent nome oti verbo que se entenda, quern cuidas que as Iraz e leva da terra ? Quern as faz serem tratadas e recebidas do comum consintimenlo ? O tempo. THE COSSANTES 35 in part may be ascribed the monotony, the absence of particular descriptions in the cantigas de amor. In religious hymns obviously reverence would not permit the Virgin to be described in greater detail than, for example, Gil Vicente's vague branca e colorada, and the reverence might be transferred unconsciously to poems addressed to an earthly dona. (Only in the extravagant devotional mannerisms {gongorismo ao divino) of the seventeenth century could Soror Violante do Ceo describe Christ as a galan de ojos verdes.) Dona genser quHeu no sai dir or la genser que sia says Arnaut de Marueil at the end of the thirteenth century. The Portuguese poet would make an end there : his lady is fairest among women, fairer than he can say. He would never go on to describe her grey eyes and snowy brow : huelhs vairs and fron pus blanc que lis. But introduced into alien and artificial forms, like mountain gentians in a garden, the monotony can no longer please. In the cantigas de amor the iteration becomes a tedious sluggishness of thought, whereas in the cossantes it is part of the music of the poem. C2 C. A. = Cancioneiro da Ajuda. C. A. M.

The Cancioneiros If, besides the Cancioneiros da Vaticana, Colocci-Brancuti, and da Ajuda, we include King Alfonso X's Cantigas de Santa Maria (C, M.) we have over 2,000 poems, by some 200 poets. Of these the Cancioneiro da Ajuda (C. A.) contains 310. Preserved in the Lisbon Collegio dos Nohres and later in the Royal Library of Ajuda at Lisbon, it was first published in an edition of twenty-five copies by Charles Stuart (afterwards Lord Stuart of Rothesay), British Minister at Lisbon (C. A. S.). Another edition, by Varnhagen, appeared in 1849 (C. A. V.), and the splendid definitive edition by D. Carolina Michaelis de Vasconcellos in 1904 (C. A. M. V.). C. A. M. V. contains 467 poems, in part reproduced from C. V. M. and C. C. B. The third volume, of notes, is still unpublished. Of the Cancioneiro preserved as Codex Vaticanus 4803, and now commonly known as Cancioneiro da Vaticana (C. V.), frag- ments were published soon after its rediscovery : viz, that portion attributed to King Dinis, edited by Moura in 1847 (C. D. M.). This part received a critical edition at the hands of Professor H. R. Lang in 1892 ; and ed., with introduction, Halle, 1894 (C. D, L.). A few more crumbs were given to the world by Varnhagen in 1870, 2nd ed. 1872 (C. T, A.), and in 1873 (C. A. P.) and 1875 (C. L.) by Ernesto Monaci, who printed his diplomatic edition of the complete text (1,205 poems) in the latter year (C. V. M.), and with it an indgx of a still larger Cancioneiro (it has 1,675 entries) compiled by Angelo Colocci in the sixteenth century and discovered by, Monaci in the Vatican Library (codex 3217). Dr. Theophilo Braga's critical edition appeared in 1878 (C. V. B.). In this very year a large Cancioneiro (355 ff.), corresponding nearly but not precisely to the Colocci index, was discovered in the library of the Conte Paolo Antonio Brancuti (C. C. B. 38 I185-1325 For convenience' sake C. C. B. also = the fragment published by Enrico Gasi Molteni), and the 442 of its poems, lacking in C. V. (but nearly half of which are in C. A.), were published in diplomatic edition by Enrico Molteni in 1880 (C. C. B.). All these (C. A., C. V., and C. C. B.) were in all probability derived from the Cayicioneiro compiled by the Conde de Barcellos. When his father, King Dinis, died, silence fell upon the poets. The new king, Afonso IV, showed no sign of continuing to collect the smaller Cancioneiros kept by nobles and men of humbler position, a custom inaugurated by his grandfather, Afonso III (if the Livro de Trovas del Rei D. Afonso in King Duarte's library was his), continued by King Dinis {Livro de Trovas del Rei D, Dinis), and perhaps revived by King Duarte a century later {Livro de Trovas del Rei). It was thus a time suitable for a ' definitive edition ', and Count Pedro, who was the last of the Cancioneiro poets and who was more collector than poet, probably took the existing Cancioneiros (of Afonso III and Dinis) and added a third part consisting of later poems. Besides the chronological order there was a division by subject into cantigas de amor, cantigas de amigo, and cantigas d'escarnho e de maldizer (Santillana's cantigas, serranas e dezires, or cantigas serranas, the Archpriest of Hita's cantares serranos e dezires). C. V. is divided into these three kinds ; in the older and incomplete C. A. 304 of the 310 poems are cantigas de amor. Eleven years after the death of King Duarte the Marques de Santillana wrote (1449) to the Constable of Portugal, D. Pedro, describing the Galician- Portuguese Cancioneiro — un grant volume — which he had seen in his boyhood in the pos- session of D. Mencia de Cisneros. (This may have been the actual manuscript compiled by D. Pedro, Conde de Barcellos and Jsequeathed by him in 1350 to Alfonso XI of Castille and Leon — a few days after Alfonso XI's death. Or it may have been a copy of the Cancioneiro of D. Pedro or the Cancioneiro of Afonso III or of Dinis.) It is significant that in this very important letter it is a foreigner informing a Portuguese. Under the predominating influence first of Spain then of the Renaissance, the old Portuguese poems, even if they were known to exist, excited no interest in Portugal. They were THE CANCIONEIROS 39 musas rusticas, musas in illo tempore rudes et incultas.^ With this disdain the Cayicioneiro became a real will-o'-the-wisp. Even as late as the nineteenth century one disappeared mysteriously from a sale, another emerged momentarily (see C. T. A.) from the shelves of a Spanish grandee only to fall back into the unknown. In the sixteenth century the evidence as to its being known is contradictory. Duarte Nunez de Leam in 1585 says of King Dinis that extant hodie eius carmina. Antonio de Vasconcellos in 1621 declares that time has carried them away : obliviosa praeripuit vetustas. A few vague allusions (as that of Sa de Miranda concerning the echoes of Provencal song) were all that was vouchsafed in Portugal to the Cancioneiro, although prominent Portuguese men of letters — as Sa de Miranda, Andre de Resende, Damiao de Goes — travelled in Italy and met there Cardinal Pietro Bembo (1470-1547), who had probably owned the Cancioneiros (copies by an Italian hand of a Portuguese original) acquired by Angelo Colocci ; yet at this very time Colocci (11549) was eagerly indexing and annotating the Cancioneiros in Rome, It is this Portuguese neglect and indifference to the things of Portugal which explains the survival of the cossantes only in Rome while the more solemn and less indigenous poems of the Cancioneiro da Ajuda remained in the land of their birth. A fuller account of the Portuguese Cancioneiros, with the fascinating and complicated question of their descent and inter- relations, will be found in the Grundriss (pp. 199-202) and D. Carolina Michaelis de Vasconcellos' edition of the Cancioneiro da Ajuda (vol. ii, pp. 180-288). ^ When the poetry of the troubadours flourished in Provence Portugal was scarcely a nation. The first Provengal poet, Guilhaume, Comte de Poitou (1087-1127), precedes by nearly a century Sancho I (1154-1211), second King of Portugal, who wrote poems and married the Princess Dulce of Aragon ; and the Gascon Marcabrun, the first foreign poet to refer to Portugal, in his poems Al prim comens del ivernaill and Emperaire per mi ' Antonio de Vasconcellos, Anacephalaeoses, id est Svmmn Capita Actorum Regum Lusitaniae (Antverpiae, 162 1), p. 79. 2 See also C. V. B., pp. xcv-vi. 40 I185-1325 mezeis, in the middle of the twelfth century, spoke not of her poetry but of her warrior deeds : la valor de Portegal. Gavaudan similarly refers at the end of the twelfth century to the Galicians and Portuguese among other (Castille, &c.) barriers against the ' black dogs ' (the Moors). It was in Spain that the Portu- guese had opportunity of meeting Proven9al poets. The Penin- sula in the thirteenth century was, like Greece of old, divided into little States and Courts, each harbouring exiles and refugees from neighbouring States. Civil strife or the death of a king in Portugal would scatter abroad a certain number of noblemen on the losing side, who would thus come into contact with the troubadours as Provengal poetry spread to the Courts of Catalonia and Aragon, Navarre, Castille and Leon. The first King of Portugal, although a prince of the House of Burgundy, held his kingdom in fief to Leon, and all the early kings were in close touch with Leon and Castille. Fernando III, King of Castille and Leon (St. Ferdinand), was a devoted lover of poetry, and his son Alfonso X gathered at his cort sen erguelh e sen vilania a galaxy of talented troubadours, Provengal and Galician. Portugal came into more direct touch with France in other ways, but the influence might have been almost exclusively that of the trouveres of the North had not the more generous enthusiasm of Provence penetrated across the frontier into Spain. Trade was fairly active in the thirteenth century between Portugal and England, North France and Flanders. Many of the members of the religious orders — as the Cluny Benedictines — who occupied the territory of the Moors in Portugal were Frenchmen. With foreign colonists the new towns were systematically peopled. The number of French pilgrims was such that the road to Santiago became known as the ' French Road '. The Crusades also brought men of many languages to Portugal.' The Court by descent and dynastic intermarriage was cosmopolitan ; but indeed the life of the whole Peninsula was cosmopolitan to an extent which tallies ill with the idea of the Middle Ages as a period of isolation and darkness. The Portuguese had already begun to show their ' An English Crusader writing from Lisbon speaks of inter hos tot linguarum populos {Crucesignati Anglici Epistola de ExpugnationeOlisiponis, ad. 1147). THE CANCIONEIROS 41 fondness for novedades. Yet it was they who imposed their, the Galician, language. As the Marques de Santillana observed and the Cancioneiros prove, lyric poets throughout the Peninsula used Galician.^ Probably the oldest surviving instance of this language in verse by a foreigner is to be found (ten lines) in a descort {descordo) written by Raimbaud de Vaqueiras (1158- 1217) at the Court of Bonifazio II of Montferrat towards the end of the twelfth century. We cannot doubt that the character and conditions of the north-west of the Peninsula had permitted a thread of lyric poetry to continue there ever since Silius Italicus had heard the youth of Galicia wailing {ululantem) their native songs, and that both language and literature had the opportunity to develop earlier there than in the rest of Spain. The tide of Moorish victory only gradually ebbed southward, and the warriors in the sterner country of Castille, with its fiery sun and battles and epics, would look back to the green country of Galicia as the idyllic land of song, a refuge where sons of kings and nobles could spend their minority in comparative peace. When from the ninth century Galicia became a second Holy Land its attractions and central character were immeasurably increased. Pilgrims thither from every country would return to their native land with some words of the language, and those acquainted with Provengal might note the similarity and the musical softness of Galician. - It is not certain that the eldest of the ten children of San Fernando, Alfonso X (i22i?-84), el Sabio, King of Castille and Leon, Lord of Galicia, and brother-in-law of our Edward I, passed his boyhood in Galicia. But when he was compiling a volume of poems referring to many parts of the world besides Spain, to Canterbury and Rome, Paris and Alexandria, Lisbon, Cologne, Cesarea, Constantinople, he would naturally choose Galician not only, or indeed chiefly, because it was the more graceful and pliant medium for lyric verse but because it was the most widely known, and, like French, plus commune a toutes * Coleccidn de Poesias Castellanas (1779), vol. i, p. Ivii. The important passages of Santillana's letter have been so often quoted that the reader may be referred to them, e.g. in the Grundriss, p. 168. • Mild y Fontanals {De los Trobadores, p. 522) lays much stress on the resem- blance between Galician and Proven9al. 42 I185-1325 gens} He had no delicate ear for its music and made such poor use of its pliancy that it often becomes as hard as the hardest Castilian in his hands. His songs of miracles offer a striking contrast to contemporary Portuguese lyrics in the same language. Their jingles are only possible as a descort in the Portuguese Cancioneiros. At the same time he would be influenced in his choice of language by his knowledge of Galicia as the traditional home of the lyric, of the encouraging patronage extended to Galician poets by his son-in-law Afonso HI, of the Santiago school of poets, and of the promising future before the Galician language in the hands of the conquering Portuguese. Multas et perpulchras composuit cantilenas, says Gil de Zamora, and likens him to David. But when we remember the prodigious services rendered by Alfonso X to Castilian prose, the first question that arises is whether he was indeed the author of the 450 fioems in Galician - that we possess under his name. Of these poems 426, or, cancelling repetitions, 420, are of a religious character, written, with one or two exceptions, in honour of the Virgin : Cantigas de Santa Maria. Many of these poems themselves provide an answer to the question : they record his illnesses and enterprises and his trobar in such a way that they could only have been written by himself : he is the entendedor of Santa Maria (C. M. 130), he exhorts other trohadores to sing her praises (C. M. 260), he himself is resolved to sing of no other dona (C. M. 10 : dou ao demo os otros amores) ; and his attractive and ingenuous pride in these poems accords ill with an alien authorship. When he lay sick at Vitoria and was like to die it was only when the Livro das Cantigas was placed on his body that he recovered (C. M. 209), and he directed that they should be preserved in the church in which he was buried. There is little reason to doubt that he was the author, in a strictly limited sense, of the majority of the poems, although not of all. ' It must be remembered that in the early thirteenth century (12 13) the range of the Gahcian-Portuguese lyric already extended to Navarre (C. V. 937). • Guiraut Riquier and Nat de Mons placed Proven9al poems on his lips, which may be taken as an indication that he also wrote in Proven9al. As proof that he wrote poems in Castilian we have a single cantiga of eight lines (C. C. B. 363 : Senora por amor dios). The other poem of the Cancioneiros in Castilian (with traces of Galician) is by the victor of Salado, Alfonso XI (1312-50), King of Castille and Leon : En un tiempo cogi flores (C. V. 209). THE CANCIONEIROS 43 Various phrases seem to imply a double method. C. M. 219 says : ' I will have that miracle placed among the others ' ; C. M. 295 : ' I ordered it to be written.' On the other hand, C. M. 47 is ' a fair miracle of which I made my song ' ; CM. 84 ' a great miracle of which I made a song ' ; of 106 ' I know well that I will make a goodly song ' ; of 64 ' I made verses and tune ' ; for 188 ' I made a good tune and verses because it caught my fancy ' ; for 307 ' according to the words I made the tune ' ; of 347 ' I made a new song with a tune that was my own and not another's '. The inference seems to be that, the personal poems and the loas apart, if a miracle especially attracted the king he took it in hand ; otherwise he might leave it to one of the joglares, and he would perhaps revise it and be its author to the extent that the Portuguese jograes were authors of the early cossantes. We know that he had at his Court a veritable factory of verse. The vignettes^ to these Cantigas show him surrounded by scribes, pen and parchment in hand, by joglares and joglaresas. Poets thronged to his Court and he was in communication with others in foreign lands. Some of the miracles might come to him in verse, the work of a friendly poet or of a sacred jogral such as Pierres de Siglar, whom C. M. 8 shows reciting his poems from church to church : en todalas eigreias da Uirgen que non a par un seu lais senpre dizia,^ and this would account for the variety of metre and treatment. Of raw material for his art there was never a scarcity, nor was the idea of turning it into verse original. In France Gautier de Coincy (i 177-1236) had already written his Miracles de la Sainte Vierge in verse, and the Spanish poet Gonzalo de Berceo (1180-1247) had composed the Milagros de Nuestra Sennora. But there was no need for direct imitation. If the starry sky were parchment and the ocean ink, the miracles * Their antiquarian interest was recognized over three centuries ago. Cf. Argote de Molina, Nobleza de Andalvzia (Seuilla, 1588), f. 151 v. : es un libro de mucha curiosidad assi por la poesia como por los trages de aquella edad q se veen en stts pinturas. * Some of King Alfonso's Cantigas were recited in the same way. C. M. 172 implies this in the lines : Et d'esto cantar fezemos Que cantassen os iograres And of this we made a song for the joglares to sing). 44 1185-1325 could not all be written down, says King Alfonso (C. M. no). Churches and rival shrines preserved an unfailing store for collectors. Gautier de Coincy spoke of tant miracles, a grant livre of them, and King Alfonso chooses one from among 300 in a book (C. M. 33), finds one written in an ancient book (265) written among many others (258), in a book among many others (284), and refers to a book full of them at Soissons. The miracles were recorded more systematically in France, and the books of Soissons and Rocamadour {Liber Miraculonim S. Mariae de Rupe Amatoris) provided the king with many subjects, as did also Vincent de Beauvais' Speculum Historiale, of which he possessed a copy. But the sources in the Peninsula were very copious, as, for instance, the Book of the Miracles of Santiago, of which a copy, in Latin, exists in the Paris Biblio- theque Nationalc. Of other miracles the king had had personal experience, or they were recent and came to him by word of mouth. Thus he often does not profess to invent his subject : he merely translates it into verse and sometimes appraises it as he does so. It is ' a marvellous great miracle' (C. M. 257), ' very beautiful ' (82), ' one in which I have great belief ' (241), ' one almost incredible ', mui cruu de creer (242), or ' famous ' (195), 'known throughout Spain' (191). Many of these miracles occurred to the peasants and unlettered : then as now the humbler the subject the greater the miracle. Accordingly we find the king in his poems dealing not with the conventional shepherdesses of the pastorelas but with lowly folk of real life, peasants, gleaners, sailors, fishermen, beggars, pilgrims, nuns ; and it is one of the king's titles to be considered a true poet that he takes an evident pleasure in these themes and retains their graphic, artless presentment. The collection abounds in charming glimpses of the life of the people. Indeed, in many of the poems there is more of the people than of King Alfonso,^ and he sings diligently of the misdeeds of clerics and usurers, of the incompetence of doctors, and of massacres of Jews. He seems to have followed the originals very closely, and evident traces 1 Their popular origin is borne out by the music. See H. Collet et L. Villalba, Contribution a I'itude dcs Cantigas (1911). Cf. also P. Meyer, Types de quelques chansons de Gautier de Coinci {Romania, vol. xvii (iJ pp. 429—37) : paroles pieuses d des miladies profanes. THE CANCIONEIROS 45 of their language remain, French, English, and perhaps Provengal. The poems are often of considerable length, some- times twenty or thirty verses, and as a rule the last line of each verse must rhyme with the refrain. The attention thus neces- sarily bestowed upon the rhymes sometimes mars the pathos of the subject, and the reader is reminded that he has to do with a skilful, eager, and industrious craftsman but not with a great original poet. In the remarkable Ben vennas Mayo and in many of his other poems materialism and poetical ecstasy go hand in hand. Yet in several of the more beautiful legends the poet proves himself equal to his theme. Some of these legends are still famous, that of the Virgin taking the place of the nun (C. M. 55 and 94), of the knight and the pitcher (155), of the stone miraculously warded from the statue of the Virgin and Child (136 and 294), of the monk's mystic ecstasy at the lais of the bird in the convent garden (103). Others had probably an equal celebrity in the Middle Ages, as that of the captive miraculously brought from Africa and awaking free in Spain at dawn (325),^ of the painter with whom the Devil was wroth for always painting him so ugly (74), or of the peasant whose vineyard alone was saved from the hail (161). Every tenth poem (the collection was intended originally to consist of one hundred) interrupts the narratives of miracles by a purely lyrical cantiga de loor, and some of these, written with the fervour with which the king always sang as gragas muy granadas of the Madre de Deus Manuel, are of great simplicity and beauty The king had not always written thus, and of his profane poems we possess thirty ^ (since no one who has read the lively essay by Cesare de Lollis will doubt that C. V. 61-79 and C. C. B. 359-72 ( = 467-78) were written by Alfonso X). The most important of these are historical, and invoke curses on ' Padre Nobrega came upon a crowd of pobres pedintes peregrtnos at San- tiago feasting merrily an^ having grandes contendas entre si as to which of them was cleverest at taking people in. The trick of one of them was to declare that, being captive in Turkey, encommendando-me miiito d Senhora . . . achei-me ao oittro dia ao romper da alva em terra de Christaos (Simao de Vascon- cellos, Cronica, Lib. I, § 22). Cf. Jeronymo de Mendo9a, Jornada de Africa, 1904 ed., ii. 34, and Frei Luis de Sousa, Hist, de S. Domingos, i. i. 5. 2 i. e. besides the Spanish caw/Z^a (C. C. B. 363), C. C. B. 359, which belongs to the Cantigas de Santa Maria, and C. C. B. 372, which consists of a single line. 46 I185-1325 false or recalcitrant knights, non ven al mayo ! C. V. 74 is a battle-scene description so swift and impetuous that we must go to the Poema del Cid for a parallel. And indeed some of the old spirit peeps out from the Caniigas de Santa Maria, as when he prays to be delivered from false friends or praises the Virgin for giving his enemies ' what they deserved '. From the return and enthronement of Afonso III imitation of French and Provencal poetry was in full swing in Portugal. The long sojourn of the prince in France, accompanied by several noblemen who figure in the Cancioneiros (as Rui Gomez de Briteiros and D. Joan de Aboim), had an important bearing on the development of Portuguese poetry. He came back determined to act the part of an enlightened patron of letters ; he encouraged the immigration of men of learning from France and maintained three jograes permanently in his palace.^ Princes and nobles as trohadores for their own pastime, the segreis,^ knights who went from Court to Court and received payment for the recital of their own verses, the jograes, belonging to a lower station, who recited the poems of their patrons the trohadores, all vied in imitation of the love songs of Provence. In general, i. e. in the structure of their poems, the resemblance is close and clear enough. The decasyllabic love song in three or four stanzas with an envoi, the satirical sirventes, the tenson (jocs-partits) in which two poets contended in dialogue, the descort in which the discordant sounds expressed the poet's distress and grief, the halada of Provence, the balletic and pastourelle of North France, were all faithfully reproduced. If, on the other hand, we look for imitations in detail it is perhaps natural that we should find them less frequently.\"^ ^ El Rei aia tres jograes en sa casa e non mats. 2 Riquier's segricrs per tolas cortz (King Alfonso X (C. M. 194) speaks of a jograr andando pelas cortes). See also C. V. 556. The word probably has no connexion with scguir (to follow). Possibly it was used originally to differentiate singers of profane songs, caniigas profanas e seculares. Frei Joao Alvarez in his Cronica do Infanle Sanlo has ' obras ecclesiasticas e segraaes ' ; King Duarte counted among os pecados da boca ' cantar cantigas sagraaes ', The Cancioneiros show that the segrel was far less common than the jogral in the thirteenth century. For segre { = saeculum) see infra, p. 93, n. 2. ^ For instances see H. R. Lang, The Relations of the Earliest Portuguese Lyric School with the Troubadours and Trouvdres {Modern Language Notes (April, 1895), pp. 207-31), and C. D. L., pp. xlviii etseq. THE CANCIONEIROS 47 The conventional character of the Portuguese poems would sufficiently account for this, and moreover their models were probably more often heard than read, so that reproduction of the actual thought or words would be difficult. When Airas Nunez in a poem of striking beauty, which is almost a sonnet (C. V. 456), wrote the lines : Que muito m'eu pago d'este verao Por estes ramos et por estas flores Et polas aves que cantan d'amores, he need not have read Peire de Bussinac's lines : Quan lo dous temps d'Abril Fa 'Is arbres sees fulhar E 'Is auzels mutz cantar Quascun en son lati, in order to know that birds sing and trees grow green in spring. And generally it is not easy to say whether an apparent echo is a direct imitation or merely a stereotyped phrase. The Portu- guese trobadores introduced little of the true spirit of the Provengal troubadours — that had passed to Palestine and to the Lady of Tripoli. In their cantigas de amor is no sign of action — unless it be to die of love ; no thought of Nature. Jaufre Rudel (1140-70), that prince of lovers, had ' gone to school to the meadows ' and might sing in his maint bons vers of la flor aiglentina or of flors d'albespis, but in the Portuguese cantigas nothing relieves the conventional dullness and excessive monotony (which likewise marked the Provengal school of poets in Sicily). Composed for the most part in iambic deca- syllabics they describe continually the poet's coita d'amor, grave d'endurar, his grief at parting, his loss of sleep, his pleasure in dying for his fremosa sennor. She is described merely as beautiful, or, at most, as Tan mansa e tan fremosa e de bon sen (C. C. B. 206). Fremosa e mansa e d'outro ben comprida (C. C. B. 278). Vocabulary and thought are spectre-thin. Indeed, it was part of the convention to sing vaguely. Eu ben falarei de sa fremosura, says one poet ^ (C. C. B. 337) — he will sing of her ' This poet, Femam Gon9alvez de Seabra or Fernant Gonzalez de Sanabria (C. V. 338; C. C. B. 330-7 ; C. A. 210-21, 445-7), apparently obtained some 48 I185-1325 beauty, but not in such a way that the curious who non 0 poden adeuinhar should guess his secret As to allusions to Nature, perhaps the climate, with less marked divisions than in Provence, furnished less incentive to sing of spring and the earth's renewal or to imitate Guiraut de Bornelh in going to school all the winter {Vivern estavaa escola a aprerider) and singing only with the return of spring. King Dinis, perhaps in reference to that troubadour, declares that his love is independent of the seasons and more sincere than that of the singers of Provence : - Proengaes soen mui ben trobar E dizen eles que e con amor, Mais OS que troban no tempo da frol E non en outro sei eu ben que non An tan gran coita . . . (C. V. 127) and even as he wrote the words he was unconsciously imitating the thought of the Provengal poet Gace Brule, who had spoken . of les fans amoureus d'este. The exceeding similarity of the cantigas de amor did raise doubts as to the sincerity of all this dying of love (cf. C. V. 353 and C. V. 988) and as to whether a poem was a cantar novo or an article at second hand (C. V. 819). Yet the poets evidently had talent and poetic feeling ; indeed, their skill in versification contrasts remarkably with their entire absence of thought or individuality. They appear to revel in monotony of ideas and pride themselves on the icy smoothness of their verse. All their originality consisted in the introduction of technical devices, such as the repetition at intervals of certain words [dohre], or of different tenses of .the same verb {mordohre, as C. V. 681), to carry on the poem without stop from beginning to end by means of ' for ', ' but ', &c., at the beginning of each verse [cantigas de atafiinda,^ as C. V. 130, fame by his mystification, unless the object of his devotion was as high-placed as the Portuguese princess for love of whom, according to legend, D. Joan Soarez de Paiva died in Galicia. The latter wrote in the first years of the thirteenth century (C. V. 937, Randglosse xi). They are the only two Galician-Portuguese poets — besides King Dinis — mentioned in Santillana's letter. ^ Poetica, 11. 126, 130. Much of the information of this Poetica (printed in C. C. B.) may be gleaned from the Cancioneiros, but it shows how carefully the different kinds of poem were distinguished. There were apparently special names for poems to trick and deceive : de logr' e d'artciro, and for THE CANCIONEIROS 49 C. A. 205), to begin and end each verse with the same line [cangdo redonda, as C. V. 685), to repeat the last line of one verse as the first line of the next {leixapren), to use the same word at the end of each line (as vi in C. A. 7). The poet who addressed cantigas de amor to his lady also provided her with poems for her to sing, cantigas de amigo in complicated form, or as the simpler cossante, which the cantigas de amigo include. These are poems with more life and action, often in dialogue. Perhaps the dona herself, wearied by the monotonous cantigas de amor, had pointed to the songs of the peasant women, and the form of these cantigas de amigo was a compromise between the Provengal cantiga de meestria and the popular cantiga de refran. The peasant woman composed her own songs, and the poet places his song on the lips of his love : thus we find her describing herself as beautiful, eu velida ; eufremosa ; trisV e fremosa ; fremosa e de mui bon prez ; 0 men hon semelhar. Poetical shepherdesses sing these cantigas de amigo ; the fair dona sings them as she sits spinning (C. V. 321). The old Poetica (11. 2-12) distinguishes between the cantigas de amor, in which the amigo speaks first, and the cantigas de amigo, in which the first to speak is the amiga. Both were artificial forms, but the latter are clearly more popular in theme (the amiga waiting and wailing for her lover), and in treatment sometimes convey a real intensity of feeling.^ The favourite subject of the cantiga de amigo is that the cruel mother prevents the lovers from meeting. The daughter is kept in the house : a manda muito guardar (C. V. 535). She reproaches and entreats her mother, who answers her as choir to choir ; she bewails her lot to her friends, or to her sister. She is dying of love and begs her mother to tell her lover. Her mother and lover are reconciled. Her lover is false and fails to meet her at the trysted hour. She waits for him in vain, and her mother comforts her in her festive laughter poems : de risadelha (or refestela ?) = de riso e mote. San- tillana's mansobre is, it seems, a misprint for ntordobre. It occurs again in the Requesta de Ferrant Manuel contra Alfonso Alvarez (Cane, de Baena, i860 ed., i. 253) : Sin lai, sin deslai, sin cor, sin descor. Sin dobre, mansobre, sensilla o menor. Sin encadenado, dexar o prender. ' e. g. C. V. 300 : Por Deus, se ora, se era chegasse Con el mui leda seria. 2362 D 50 1185-1325 distress. She pines and dies of love while her amigo is away serving the king in battle or en cas' del rei. The third section of the Cancioneiro da Vaticana does not sin by monotony. We may divide Pope's line, since if the cantigas de amor are ' correctly cold ' many of the satiric poems are ' regularly low '. In these verses, containing violent invec- tive and abuse [cantigas de maldizer) or more covert sarcasm and ridicule [cantigas d'escarnho), the themes are often scandalous, the language ribald and unseemly. They were written with great zest, although without the fiery indignation of the Proven- gal and Catalan sirventeses. They are concerned with persons : the haughty trobador may take a jogral to task for writing verses that do not rhyme or scan, but even then it is a personal matter and he rebukes his insolence for daring to raise his thoughts to ' altas donas in song. Some of these poems should never have been written or printed, but many of them give a lively idea of the society of that time. They laugh merrily or venomously at the poverty-stricken"
