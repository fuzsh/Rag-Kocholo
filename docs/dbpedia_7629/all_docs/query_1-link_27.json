        "text": "Since the first Portuguese conquests in 1500 (Monteiro, 1), the music of Brazil’s tribal peoples has been adapted to foreign tastes in a number of ways. Accustomed to a learned written tradition developed in the Church, colonizers were disgusted with music of the Natives. Accounts of the culture shock include harshly pejorative, animalizing descriptions of native South American tribes and their lifestyle. In more recent times, musicians from outside these tribal cultures have assimilated slightly more honest, egalitarian research of Brazil’s pre-colonial musical traditions. Innovative treatments of native melodies are not uncommon, but no adaptation does a complete enough job of portraying the material clearly. In fact, I propose that the only effective way to teach the world about pre-colonial music from Brazil would be that an individual (or group) offer knowledge from within his or her own indigenous community. Having researched the multicultural development of Brazilian music, as well as the modern state of tribal life, I suggest the following solution: an effort must be made by indigenous peoples to reach out through a universally comprehensible interface with the intention of conveying the music as it is made in an authentic context. In this essay, I expand on instances of contact between tribal and modern civilizations. My hope is that the reader will arrive at an understanding of not only indigenous music as it is employed by non-indigenous musicians, but also the complex social dynamic at work.\n\nIn 1989, Cape Verdean author G. T. Didial published his novel «O Estado Impenitente da Fragilidade». Five years later, in 1994, the South African author and 2003 Nobel Prize winner J.M. Coetzee released «The Master of Pitersburg». Both novels focus on the life story of literary writers (D. T. Juga, in Didial’s novel; Dostoevsky, in Coetzee’s) and their inability to write about and to live with their innermost (literary) family. They address the complexity in the apparent silencing of the voices of the Other and of the Other-self, challenging us to think about some of the following issues. To what extent the apparent silencing of those voices activates (both in human life and in cultural phenomena) the shadow of mutual violence between fathers and sons? Can we read Didial and Coetzee’s novels as literary discussions on the violence and on the word crisis which are recognizable in the contemporary World? Thus, this paper seeks to demonstrate how the two narratives revisite an ancient Western mythological tradition (Abraham and Isaac; Oedipus and Laius; Herod and the Massacre of the Innocents), and how, through a complex rewriting process, they both discuss, not only the tensional relationship between fathers and sons but also the complex relationship between contemporary literatures of post-colonial African cultural systems and the literatures of Western cultural systems. in Journal of Lusophone Studies, 1.1 (Spring 2016) (forthcoming). Special issue devoted to Lusophone Africa. The issue will be co-edited by Ana Maria Martinho and Phillip Rothwell, and it will also include essays from a special tribute to Russell Hamilton co-edited by Fernando Arenas and Ana Paula Ferreira. http://jls.apsa.us/index.php/jls/article/view/44/58"
