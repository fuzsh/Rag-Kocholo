        "text": "A COLLECTION OF WORKS BY SAMUEL JESSURUN DE MESQUITA The following 19 lots form a small collection of works by the Dutch artist Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita (1868-1944) Jessurun de Mesquita studied amongst others with Lambertus Zijl and his cousin and brother-in-law Joseph Mendes da Costa. Next to his activities as a draughtsman and painter he soon developed an interest in printing and took lessons in etching from the Dutch artist Maurits van der Valk. He possibly learned even more from experimenting himself with various printing-techniques, such as the engravings in marble and zinc or the printing of etchings in relief. From 1902 until 1926 he taught at the Kunstnijverheidsschool in Haarlem. Amongst his students was the nowadays well-known Maurits Cornelis Escher. Influenced by the ideas of the Arts and Crafts movement in England he made many designs for textile decorations, making use of the techniques of batik and woodcut. Only few of his textiles still exist today. In many of his well-known images of animals Jessurun de Mesquita shows a clear decorative style. Very opposite in style are his so-called 'Sensitivistische' drawings and prints in which he shows a more personal, spontaneous and visionary kind of art. Examples of this style can be found in this sale in the lotnumbers 526, 527, 528, 531 and 542. Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita died in 1944 in Auschwitz. The many styles and techniques in which he worked are well represented in the present collection. E.H. Ariëns Kappers published many prints and drawings by the artist in S. Jessurun de Mesquita, Rotterdam/Amsterdam, 1984\n\nSamuel Jessurun de Mesquita (1868-1944)"
