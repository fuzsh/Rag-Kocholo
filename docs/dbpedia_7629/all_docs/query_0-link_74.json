Born in Shiraz, Persia, Melamed was taken to Palestine by his father, R.R. *Melamed, when he was two. He worked at the Ministry of Education (1952–56), and was appointed professor of Bible at the Hebrew University (1964) and of Talmud at Bar Ilan (1961) and at Tel Aviv (1964) universities. He was elected to the Hebrew Language Academy in 1956 and to the Higher Archaeological Council in 1963. He was awarded the Israel Prize in 1987 for Torah literature and commentary on the sources. Melamed’s major works are in the fields of talmudic literature: Midreshei Halakhah shel haTanna’im be-Talmud Bavli (1943), in which he collected beraitot in the Babylonian Talmud based on verses from the Pentateuch, and Ha-Yaḥ as she-Bein Midreshei Halakhah la-Mishnah ve-la-Tosefta (“Relations Between Halakhic Midrashim and Mishnah and Tosefta,” 1967). Two related works were published posthumously: Midreshei Halakhah shel ha-Tanna’im be-Talmud Yerushalmi (2001) and Midreshei Halakhah shel\n\nha-Amoraim be-Talmud Yerushalmi (2004). Melamed devoted much labor to editing the scientific legacy of his teacher Jacob Nahum *Epstein, including Mekhilta de-Rabbi Simeon bar Yoḥ ai (1955), Mevo’ot le-Sifrut ha-Tanna’im (1957), Mevo’ot leSifrut ha-Amora’im (1962), and Dikduk Aramit Bavlit (1960). He also edited B. de Vries’ Meḥ karim be-Sifrut ha-Talmud (1968). He composed a special work in which he summarized the most significant achievements of modern Talmud scholarship: Pirkei Mavo le-Sifrut ha-Talmud (1973). He prepared textbooks and popular works, including Pirkei Minhag veHalakhah (“Chapters of Custom and Halakhah,” 1955), and Parashiyyot me-Aggadot ha-Tanna’im (“Chapters of Tannaitic Aggadot,” 1955). Among his other writings are Tafsir Tehillim bi-Leshon Yehudei Paras (“Psalms in Judeo-Persian,” 1968), Millon Arami-Ivri le-Talmud Bavli le-Matḥ ilim (“AramaicHebrew Dictionary of the Babylonian Talmud for Beginners,” 1969), and a comprehensive glossary to the entire Babylonian Talmud (Millon Arami-Ivri shel ha-Talmud ha-Bavli, 1992), as\n\nENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14\n\n5\n\nmelamed, meir well as articles in scientific journals. Of special significance is his edition of Eusebius’ geographical work Onomastikon, which he translated from the original (1938). Because of his involvement with the Persian and other Oriental communities (whom he served as honorary rabbi) and his familiarity with their traditions of custom and language, Melamed served as an important source on such community traditions.

A Hebrew author of the period calls him the “king’s secretary,” apparently because he held office in one of the royal accounting departments. In official documents he is referred to as “Rabbi” and not “Don,” as were most of the other Jewish tax farmers, which indicates that he was a scholar. He lived mainly in Segovia. In 1487 he succeeded his aged father-in-law Abraham *Seneor as chief administrator of tax farming in the kingdom. On June 15, 1492, he and Abraham Seneor were baptized with great ceremony at Guadalupe, Ferdinand and Isabella acting as godparents. As a Christian he adopted the name Fernándo Núñez Coronel. On June 23, 1492, he was appointed chief accountant (contador mayor). He also became a permanent member of the royal council and was town councillor (regidor) in Segovia.

Born in Shiraz, he moved to Jerusalem in 1906, established a yeshivah in his own home, and served as rabbi to the Persian Jews. He wrote many commentaries in both Hebrew and *Judeo-Persian to the Pentateuch, the Scrolls, Avot, and portions of the Zohar: among them Kisse Raḥ amim (1911), Yeshu’ah ve-Raḥ amim (1912), Ẓ edakah veRaḥ amim (1926), Ḥ ayyei Raḥ amim (1929), Zikhron Raḥ amim (1930), and Seder Leil Pesaḥ (in Hebrew and Persian, 1930), all published in Jerusalem. Some of his works were republished by his son, Ezra Zion *Melamed.\n\nthe Sufic ideas of *Baḥ ya ibn Paquda’s Ḥ ovot ha-Levavot and other Jewish and Muslim medieval thinkers. In the tradition of Meshed’s Jews, Siman Tov Melamed is also remembered as a staunch defender of Judaism in theological disputations which the Shiʿa clergy arranged between him, Muslims, and Jewish converts.

Born at Bretten in Baden, Melanchthon was a great-nephew of the Hebraist and Christian kabbalist Johann *Reuchlin, who taught him Hebrew and supervised his education at Pforzheim. In 1518, at the age of 21, Melanchthon was appointed professor of Greek at Wittenberg but within a year he had sided with Martin *Luther in the struggle with Rome, thus alienating Reuchlin, who later disinherited him. Melanchthon was Luther’s principal assistant in translating the Old Testament into German (1523–34). Widely respected as a humanist and theologian, he favored study of the Kabbalah, but condemned its later accretions. One of his addresses on the importance of Hebrew, De studio linguae Ebraeae, appeared in 1549. Although Melanchthon was influenced by Luther’s antisemitism, he avoided its cruder excesses and in 1539, at the Frankfurt religious assembly, publicly denounced the blood libel that had resulted in the martyrdom of 38 Brandenburg Jews in 1510.

A poet, philosopher, and author of many treatises in Hebrew and *Judeo-Persian, he composed *azharot (1896) in Judeo-Persian (portions of which were written in Persian, as well as Aramaic and Hebrew). A manuscript of his commentary to Pirkei Avot is in the possession of Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati, together with other of his writings. His major work is his philosophical-religious Sefer Ḥ ayyat al-Rukh (published 1898), which combines a commentary on Maimonides’ teachings on the 13 articles of faith and a treatise on Israel’s existence in the Diaspora and ultimate salvation. The work shows a strong influence of\n\nMELAVVEH MALKAH (Heb. ‫“ ; ְמלַ ֵ ּוה ַמלְ ָּכה‬escorting the queen”), term used to describe the meal and festivities at the end of the Sabbath. This gesture of farewell to the “queen” (Sabbath) is designed as the counterpart of the festivities which greeted her arrival. The origin of the custom has been traced to the Talmud. R. Ḥ anina asserted that the table should be (festively) laid at the termination of the Sabbath, although only a small amount of food would be eaten (Shab. 119b). The melavveh malkah was later seen by both *Jacob b. Asher and Joseph *Caro to be the fulfillment of R. Ḥ idka’s injunction to celebrate four meals on the Sabbath (Shab. 117b). It was in the context of this injunction that the melavveh malkah later assumed the image of a virtually voluntary extension of the Sabbath. Isaac *Luria, for example, believed that not until the melavveh malkah was over did the sinful dead return to hell from their Sabbath rest, and the kabbalists and Ḥ asidim were so reluctant to relinquish the honored Sabbath guest, that they used the melavveh malkah as a means of prolonging the Sab-\n\n6\n\nENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14\n\nBibliography: M.D. Gaon, Yehudei ha-Mizraḥ be-Ereẓ Yisrael, 2 (1937), 437–8. [Walter Joseph Fischel]\n\nmelbourne bath day as long as possible. They used the occasion to chant special *zemirot and to relate ḥ asidic tales. The melavveh malkah is also known as se’udat David (“King David’s banquet”). As such, it serves as a reminder of the legend that King David, having been told by God that he would die on the Sabbath (Shab. 30a), celebrated his survival each new week with special joy (Ta’amei Minhagim). One of the favorite melavveh malkah hymns is Eliyahu ha-Navi (“Elijah the Prophet”), attributed by some authorities to *Meir of Rothenburg. It welcomes the prophet as the herald of the Messiah. According to legend, Elijah is expected to announce the salvation of Israel at the first opportunity after the termination of the Sabbath. Medieval paytanim devoted several other zemirot to the melavveh malkah festivities. Among the most notable are Be-Moẓ a’ei Yom Menuḥ ah by Jacob Menea (14t century); Addir Ayom ve-Nora, Ish Ḥ asid by Jesse b. Mordecai (13t century); and Amar Adonai le-Ya’akov.\n\nEarly Metropolitan Settlement Jews clustered around shops and businesses in the center of the city in Collins, Bourke, and Elizabeth streets and in 1847 opened the first synagogue (Melbourne Hebrew Congregation) in that area. The influx in the 1850s and 1860s led to settlement in working-class districts in the suburbs adjoining the city – Fitzroy, Carlton, Richmond, and East Melbourne. The East Melbourne Congregation was founded in 1857 with Moses Rintel as minister, most of the congregants being immigrants from Germany and Austria. At the turn of the century this congregation was led by the patriarchal figure, Rev. Jacob Lenzer. There were continuous movements of Jews from their first areas of settlement to new areas. In the wake of such a group movement the St. Kilda Synagogue was opened in 1872. In the period before compulsory education the Melbourne Hebrew School was established as a day school in 1874 and continued until 1886, when it was closed because of financial difficulties. In 1888 the three congregations (Melbourne, East Melbourne, and St. Kilda) established the United Jewish Education Board, which conducted part-time Hebrew schools in various centers. As they moved from area to area, the Jews ascended in the social and occupational ladder and by 1900 the most popular occupations were textile manufacturing, general dealing, and skilled trades such as tailoring, watchmaking, and cabinetmaking. Small draper shop-owners were beginning to\n\nacquire large retail stores. Carpenters were opening furniture factories. Less than 3 were in the professions. During the first decades of the 20t century there gradually developed a struggle for communal supremacy between the earlier immigrants who lived south of the Yarra River, and who were more prosperous and assimilated, and the more recent immigrants, mostly from Eastern Europe, who were concentrated north of the river, and who were Yiddish-speaking, with an Orthodox background, Yiddish culture, and strong Zionist leanings. Concurrently, a change took place in the centers of Jewish activity. Whereas until the first decades of the 20t century life centered around the synagogues, in the next decades a shift took place, non-synagogal bodies being organized and gradually taking a more prominent place in communal leadership. The synagogues in the first decades of the 20t century were the Melbourne Hebrew Congregation (first at Bourke St. in the city; after 1930 at Toorak Road) and the St. Kilda Synagogue south of the Yarra, and the East Melbourne Synagogue and the Carlton Synagogue (established 1927), north of the Yarra. Some smaller minyanim had also been formed, notably the Woolf Davis Chevra, run by the family of J.E. Stone, and the Talmud Torah Hascola at North Carlton. A number of societies mainly in the hands of the south of the Yarra element were already in existence – the Philanthropic Society, Aid Society, Welfare Society, Sick Visiting Society, the Chevra Kadisha (founded 1910), the United Shechita Board, and the Beth Din. A number of bodies began to spring up north of the Yarra. In 1912 new immigrants had helped to form a center of Yiddish culture, the “Jewish National Library-Kadimah,” which apart from its book collection held regular cultural meetings including Yiddish lectures and plays. The Judean League of Victoria was founded in 1921 as a roof-organization for non-synagogal activity, sports, literary, cultural, social, and Zionist activity. Its headquarters in its heyday at Monash House, Carlton, was a vibrant center of Jewish activity every night of the week for three decades. Its founder and leading spirit was Maurice *Ashkanasy. The struggle between the two elements ended in 1948 with a democratic representation unifying the whole community and putting an end to the era of Anglo-Jewish patrician control and of the congregational dictatorship in communal affairs. The place of Melbourne (later Victorian) Jewish Advisory Board (established in 1921), a strictly synagogal body, was taken by the Victorian Jewish Board of Deputies (in 1948) which gave a new direction to communal activities, and brought about the formulation of a community viewpoint on all matters affecting both local Jewry, such as public relations, immigration, and a deepening of Jewish cultural values, and wider Jewish issues such as Zionism and antisemitism. There was also a move from voluntary philanthropy to organized professional social services. It operated through the following committees: education, social welfare, immigration, public relations, appeals coordination, youth, organization and statistics, and congregational. The struggle was fought out on a number of points, including the question of the kashrut of frozen meat\n\nENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14\n\n7\n\nBibliography: Eisenstein, Dinim, 227; H.

The 15 Port Phillip Association members who founded Melbourne in 1835 included two Jews. Melbourne is today the only Jewish community of any size in the State of Victoria. During the 19t century however a considerable number of Jews settled in other centers in the State, but the country communities practically disappeared. The Melbourne Jewish community was established in 1841.\n\nmelbourne exported to Palestine, prepared under the supervision of the United Shechita Board and its chief shoḥ et Rabbi I.J. Super (who served the community as shoḥ et, mohel, and teacher for more than half a century), which was challenged by Rabbi J.L. Gurewicz, disciple of Chaim Ozer *Grodzinsky of Vilna and the respected leader of the Orthodox Carlton Synagogue in its heyday. The main issues however were the battle against anti-Zionist elements in the mid-1940s, the struggle for the establishment of a Jewish day school, the continuing cleavage between the Orthodox and the Liberals, a stubborn but losing battle for the greater use of Yiddish, the attitude to antisemitism, and the problem of public relations. The Transformation of the Community Between the late 1930s and the mid-1950s the Melbourne Jewish community was transformed, as were the other centers of Australian Jewish life, by a number of important interrelated events. Some of this change occurred before, when the traditional synagogues, mainly Anglo-Jewish in orientation, such as the Melbourne Hebrew Congregation and the St. Kilda Hebrew Congregation, which had provided communal leadership, were challenged by new synagogues representing either a stricter European Orthodoxy or the Reform congregation founded in 1930. A Yiddish-speaking component already existed, centered in Carlton, just north of central Melbourne, rather than in the traditional middle-class Jewish area of St. Kilda, south of the inner city. Institutions like the Jewish National Library–Kadimah, founded in 1912, and the Judean League, a center of cultural life and pro-Zionist activity, founded in 1921, emerged in Yiddish Carlton, whose inhabitants demonstrated the range of Jewish orientations and ideologies of troubled Europe. There was no secular communal representative body until the foundation of the Victorian Jewish Advisory Board in 1938, an organization which changed its name in May 1947 to the Victorian Jewish Board of Deputies (VJBD), and, in October 1988, to the Jewish Community Council of Victoria. Although all local synagogues which wished to affiliate to the Board could do so, it also included a plethora of secular bodies, including Zionist and Yiddish groups. These representative bodies took a much more visible and direct role in lobbying on behalf of Jewish interests to the government and the media than was previously the case. While (with many exceptions) the old Anglo-Jewishdominated Melbourne community had been notably lukewarm on Zionism, the new community was, by and large, enthusiastically pro-Zionist, and, in the decade before the establishment of Israel, defended the creation of a Jewish state against influential local Jewish non-Zionists such as Rabbi Jacob *Danglow and Sir Isaac *Isaacs. Perhaps the most important manifestation of the new Jewish assertiveness in Melbourne was the foundation of Mt. Scopus College, the first Jewish day school, in 1949. Mt. Scopus was coeducational, and moderately Orthodox and Zionist in its orientation. By the 1980s eight full-time Jewish day schools, representing\n\n8\n\nvarious trends in the Jewish community, had been founded. The relatively large-scale migration to Melbourne of perhaps 35,000 Holocaust refugees and survivors, especially from Poland, dramatically changed the nature of the community, adding not merely to its pro-Zionist and Orthodox strength, but to its secular Yiddish and leftist elements. This in turn produced a number of major cleavages within the community, especially between the mainstream community and an allegedly pro-Communist communal defense body, the Jewish Council to Combat Fascism and Antisemitism, which resulted in the Council’s expulsion from the VJBD in 1952, and notably bad relations between the Orthodox synagogues and the Reform movement (which included significant numbers of German and Austrian refugees). As well, Yiddish persisted as a significant Jewish lingua franca in Melbourne for decades after the War. By the mid-1950s, however – and certainly by the 1967 War – the Melbourne Jewish community had been transformed into one which was enthusiastically pro-Zionist, religiously pluralistic but with a large Orthodox majority, outspoken in defense of its interests, and keen to deter assimilation through the creation of a large Jewish day school movement. A number of individual activists responsible for these developments, such as Maurice *Ashkanasy, Alex Masel, and Benzion Patkin (1902–1984), the chief founder of Mt. Scopus College, should to be mentioned here. Visitors to Melbourne were often amazed at the breadth and vigor of its institutions and it was often known as the “shtetl on the Yarra” – Melbourne’s river – for its extraordinary preservation of many of the cultural, linguistic, and ideological matrices of prewar Europe. Melbourne was also often contrasted with Sydney, which had fewer Polish Holocaust refugees but more from Britain and Hungary, and was widely seen as less assertively Jewish than Melbourne, at least down to the 1990s. The rivalry between Melbourne and Sydney was found in many aspects of Australian life, and, in the case of the two Jewish communities, probably owed something to the more extreme nature of Victoria’s left-wing, often anti-Israel, stance which emerged in the 1950s from local political developments. The Contemporary Community DEMOGRAPHY. Melbourne has experienced considerable and continuing growth during the postwar period. The number of declared Jews in Melbourne, according to the optional religious question in the Australian census, rose from about 22,000 in 1954 to 26,409 in 1971 and then to 35,383 in 1996 and 37,779 in 2001. Since this is based on responses to an optional question of religious affiliation (rather than ethnic identity), the actual number is certainly much higher, probably in the range of 50–55,000, just under 2 of Melbourne’s population of about 2.9 million. Most Melbourne Jews tend to live in a small number of well-defined Jewish neighborhoods. Among the 17 postal code areas (equivalent to zip codes in the United States, but somewhat smaller in size) in Australia with the highest number of Jews in the 2001 census, nine were in Melbourne, including three of the top five. The largest and most\n\nENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14\n\nmelbourne obviously Jewish areas of concentration are the Caulfield–St. Kilda East–Elsternwick districts, about five miles south of central Melbourne, where 18,216 Jews were identified in the 2001 census. This area contains many Jewish synagogues, institutions, and shops, and a large and visible Strictly Orthodox community. The other significant areas of Jewish concentration were adjacent to this core area: Bentleigh (2,667 Jews in 2001), to the east; the wealthy neighborhood of Toorak (1,611 Jews) to its north; and East Brighton (1,316 Jews) to its south. These neighborhoods became heavily Jewish just after World War II and have remained very stable ever since. There is little or no sign of Jewish suburbanization, as in many other Diaspora societies, nor any equivalent of “white flight,” as in the United States, away from decaying neighborhoods. The only major change in Melbourne’s Jewish demographic pattern since 1945 has been the decline to the vanishing point of the former area of East European Jewish settlement in Carlton, immediately north of central Melbourne, which, until the 1960s, contained many Yiddish-based institutions such as the Kadimah, the leading Yiddish cultural and social center. The Melbourne Jewish community has grown chiefly by immigration, welcoming successive waves of German Holocaust refugees and a very large flow of postwar Holocaust survivors, especially from Poland, and then more recent groups of South African and ex-Soviet immigrants, as well as a continuing settlement of Jews from the English-speaking world and elsewhere for normal professional purposes. Nevertheless, the stability of Melbourne Jewry, and other social characteristics, have given it some very favorable features. A 1991 random sample survey of the community, for example, found that the Melbourne Jewish fertility rate was apparently above the replacement level, a notable accomplishment for a middle-class Diaspora Jewish community. CONGREGATIONS. In terms of congregational affiliation, Melbourne had about 50 synagogues in the early 21st century, of which four were Liberal (Reform) and one Masorti (Conservative), one Independent, and all the others Orthodox of various strands ranging from moderate Anglo-Orthodoxy to Strict Orthodoxy. The postwar era has seen a vast expansion in the range of congregational affiliation beyond the AngloOrthodoxy predominant before 1939, especially at the religious extremes. Relations between the Orthodox and Reform components of the community have been notably bad, as have, to a lesser extent, relations between different strands in Orthodoxy. In part for this reason, no postwar Melbourne rabbi has been able to act as recognized spokesman for the whole community, in the manner of Rabbi Jacob Danglow before the war. A number of rabbis, such as the Orthodox *Gutnicks, Yitzhak *Groner, and John S. *Levi from the Liberals, have been viewed by many as notable leaders, but none has been regarded as a consensual leader.\n\n88) as the Victorian Jewish Board of Deputies (VJBD); and since 1988 as the Jewish Community Council of Victoria (JCCV). Its president (elected annually, and normally serving a two-year term) and other office-holders are regarded as the community’s spokesmen to the media and government. The JCCV is composed of representatives of many Jewish organizations in Melbourne, including most synagogues, Zionist bodies, fraternal, women’s, and youth groups. There is no provision to elect individuals on a personal basis. The JCCV has at all times represented a consensual position in the community, strongly supportive of Israel as well as multiculturalism and the Jewish day school system. It monitors and combats antisemitism and extreme anti-Zionism. By its constitution, no religious question can be discussed, since any debating of religious issues is likely to be divisive. The JCCV, which meets on a monthly basis, works closely with the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ), the national representative body of the community, and the Zionist Federation. EDUCATION. Probably the major reason for the relative success of the Jewish community in Melbourne has been the Jewish day school system. Since 1949, nine full-time Jewish day schools have been established in Melbourne. (See *Australia for list.) In 1962, 1,480 students attended these schools, a total which rose to 4,840 in 1982, 5,492 in 1989, and about 6,000 in 2004. The experience of Melbourne has clearly been that education there strongly discourages assimilation and intermarriage. One of the major challenges confronting the Melbourne Jewish community is the ever-increasing cost of education at Jewish schools (which are private and fee-paying, although they receive some state funding). No long-term solution to this problem is yet in sight. Jewish interest courses exist at Monash University, but the underfunding of the tertiary and research sectors compared with the Jewish school system is also a notable and unfortunate feature of the community. There are a number of Jewish museums in Melbourne which would be of interest to tourists. The Jewish Museum of Australia (26 Alma Road, St. Kilda) contains exhibits on Australian Jewry history. The Jewish Holocaust Museum and Research Centre (13 Selwyn Street, Elsternwick) has used Holocaust survivors as tour guides. Melbourne’s most prominent Jewish landmark is certainly the magnificent Melbourne Hebrew Congregation’s synagogue at Toorak Road and Domain Road, South Yarra.\n\nCOMMUNAL LEADERSHIP. Instead, the leadership of the community has been vested in its representative body, known (1938–47) as the Victorian Jewish Advisory Board, then (1947–\n\nCOMMUNAL RELATIONS. Relations between the Melbourne Jewish community and the local state government of Victoria have generally been very good. Only very occasionally have difficulties arisen, for instance in the late 1970s when a strongly anti-Zionist and radical segment of the local Australian Labor Party supported a radical radio station, 3RC, whose license to broadcast to the Jewish community was questioned at a series of public hearings. By and large, however, relations between the Jewish community and successive Victoria governments have been harmonious. Relations with the local\n\nENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14\n\n9\n\nmelchior media are also good, although the community has protested many times when Israel is unfairly criticized, as has become common, especially in the liberal media and on “talk-back” radio. Relations with other groups in the wider community are normally also harmonious, despite the existence of antisemitic and anti-Zionist activists and the threat of terrorism, especially from extremist sections of Melbourne’s growing Muslim community.

Originally from Hamburg, where the family had lived since the 18t century, MOSES MELCHIOR (1736–1817) arrived in Copenhagen in 1750. He became a successful dealer in leather and tobacco and in 1795 founded the import-export firm of Moses and Son G. Melchior, which is still in existence. His son GERSON (1771–1845) took over the business on his father’s death, and enlarged it by importing sugar, rum, and tea. He was one of the leaders of the Copenhagen Jewish community. One of his sons, NATHAN GERSON (1811–1872), was a prominent ophthalmologist. He lectured at Copenhagen University and in 1857 became a director of the Ophthalmological Institute in Copenhagen. Another son, MORITZ GERSON (1816–1884), succeeded his father as head of the firm in 1845, establishing branches in the Danish West Indies and in Melbourne, Australia. Melchior was a member of the landsting (upper house of the Danish parliament) from 1866 to 1874 and was the first Jew to belong to the Danish Chamber of Commerce, becoming its president in 1873. Active also in the Jewish community, he served as a trustee and was made president in 1852. The writer Hans Christian Andersen was a friend and frequent guest in his house. His brother MOSES (1825–1912) succeeded him in 1884, opening a New York office in 1898. He was well known for his philanthropy, contributing to many Jewish and general causes. CARL HENRIQUES (1855–1931) took over the business after his brother’s death and expanded it. He organized many athletic associations and sports clubs in Denmark and became their patron. Like his brother, he was the president of the Copenhagen community (1911–29). His son HARALD RAPHAEL (1896–1973) succeeded him in the firm, which dealt in the import of coffee, tea, rice, cocoa, and vanilla.\n\nMELCHIOR, CARL (1871–1933), German banker. Melchior, who was born in Hamburg, studied law and later became a judge there. In 1900 he was appointed legal counsel to the bank M.M. Warburg and Co. and in 1917 became a partner in the bank. During World War I, he served as a captain in the German Army and was badly wounded. After his recuperation, he worked for the German government’s Zentraleinkaufsgesellschaft (ZEG), which was charged during the war with importing foodstuffs. Melchior always considered himself a patriot. From 1918 to 1919, together with Max M. Warburg, he took part as a German delegate in the financial and economic negotiations following the armistice. Melchior subsequently played a prominent role in the lengthy negotiations which eventually paved the way for Germany’s reacceptance into the community of nations and displayed a mastery of financial and legal issues, diplomatic tact, and attention to detail. As a Jew he was afraid to arouse antisemitism by holding official positions, so he tried to act more in the background. At the international conference in Spa in 1920 as an expert for the German government, together with Walther *Rathenau and Moritz Julius *Bonn Melchior created the “policy of fulfillment” as a strategy of how Germany should pay its reparations. After Germany’s admission to the League of Nations, Melchior became the only German member of the League’s finance committee and in 1928–29 its chairman. In 1929 he was one of the German delegates discussing the revision of the Dawes Plan, under which German reparation payments were scheduled. He also served as a member of the board of the Bank for International Settlements in Basle and in other political or economic functions concerning international financial affairs. In the early 1930s he hoped that integrating the NSDAP, which he detested, into the government would placate the Nazis. After the Nazis took power in 1933, he lost his positions on several company boards. Melchior became active in the preparation for the formation of the *Reichsvertretung der deutschen Juden. In November 1933 he died. Bibliography: Carl Melchior, Ein Buch des Gedenkens und der Freundschaft (1967). Add. Bibliography: J.M.

Born in Fredericia of an old Danish family, Melchior received his rabbinical diploma in 1921 from the Hildesheimer Seminary. He served as rabbi in Tarnowice, Poland (1921–23), in Beuthen, Germany (1925–34), and as rabbi of the Danish refugees in Sweden (1943–45). From 1947 he was the chief rabbi of Denmark. Melchior endeavored to promote understanding between all the religious trends in Judaism, while personally advocating the modern Orthodox one. He supported Zionism short of advocating aliyah. The main spokesman of Danish Jewry before the\n\n10\n\nENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14\n\nmelchizedek gentile community, Melchior was considered one of the prominent orators in Denmark. He supported the establishment of relations and furthering of understanding with West Germany. Among his books are Jødedommen i vor tid (19662); En jødedommens historie (1962); Levet og oplevet (1965; A Rabbi Remembers, 1968; also Ger. tr.); and Tœnkt og Talt (1967). He translated into Danish (1961) Shalom Aleichem’s Tevye de Milkhiger. He was succeeded in the chief rabbinate by his son Bent. MELCHIOR, MICHAEL (1954– ), rabbi and Israeli politician. Born in Copenhagen, the son of Chief Rabbi Bent Melchior, Melchior studied in Israel at Yeshivat ha-Kotel after high school. He was ordained in 1980 and in the same year became the first chief rabbi of Oslo and was largely responsible for the community’s renaissance (see *Norway; *Oslo). After six years he returned to Israel but continued to serve Norwegian Jewry. In Israel he entered politics and was elected to the Knesset in 1999 as a representative of Meimad, a moderate religious party aligned with the Labor Party. In the government he served as minister without portfolio, minister for Diaspora affairs, and deputy minister for foreign affairs. MELCHIZEDEK (Heb.: ‫“ ; ַמלְ ִּכי ֶצ ֶדק‬legitimate/righteous king”; the English spelling follows LXX Melxisedek as opposed to MT Malkizedek), king of Salem (or Jerusalem; cf. Ps. 76:3) according to Genesis 14:18–20. He welcomed *Abraham after he had defeated the four kings who had captured his nephew, Lot. Melchizedek brought out bread and wine and blessed Abraham. Finally, it is related that “he gave him a tithe of everything” although who gave the tithe to whom became a subject of considerable dispute (see below). The biblical account states that “he (Melchizedek) was priest of God Most High” (‫)וְ הוּא כ ֵֹהן לְ ֵאל ֶעלְ יוֹ ן‬. Melchizedek’s priesthood was a source of numerous post-biblical speculations, which were intensified by the difficult verse Psalms 110:4: “The Lord has sworn/and will not repent/Thou art priest for ever/after the manner of Melchizedek” (‫) ַא ָּתה כ ֵֹהן לְ עוֹ לָ ם ַעל־דִּ ְב ָר ִתי ַמלְ ִּכי ֶצ ֶדק‬. It is generally believed that the Melchizedek mentioned here and the one in Genesis are the same. Some interpreters, however, maintain that the Melchizedek of Psalms is not a person but a title, “my righteous king,” presumably because the name is written as two separate words (‫) ַמלְ ִּכי ֶצ ֶדק‬. The first post-biblical documents mentioning Melchizedek in various contexts appear from around the beginning of the Christian era. The earliest is probably the fragmentary scroll discovered in cave 11 at Qumran (11Q Melch or 11Q 13) and published by A.S. Van der Woude (in OTS, 14, 1965) and again with certain corrections by M. de Jonge and A.S. Van der Woude (in NTS, 12, 1966) and much studied since (bibliography in Brooke). Although this text “is a midrashic development which is independent of the classic Old Testament loci” (J.A. Fitzmyer, JBL, 86, 1967), it is clear that the eschatological and soteriological functions it attributes to Melchizedek draw on the perplexing figure of the biblical Melchizedek. In the Qumran text, Melchizedek is described as passing judgENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14\n\nment, in the time of the tenth or last Jubilee, on Belial and those of his sort. The judgment takes place in heaven, and immediately there follows the “day of slaughter” prophecied by Isaiah. Here, Melchizedek is both judge and executor of his own decree, and in all likelihood he is to be identified with the Angel of Light, who figures in the dualistic doctrine of the Qumran sect (I. Gruenwald, in: Maḥ anayim, 124 (1970), 94). He has also been identified with the Archangel Michael. Melchizedek is also mentioned in another Qumran text, the Genesis Apocryphon (22: 13–17), where the biblical story of the meeting between Abraham and Melchizedek is retold. Here it is Abraham who offers the tithe to Melchizedek: “And he [i.e., Abraham] gave him a tithe of all the goods of the king of Elam and his companions” (cf. Heb. 7:2 followed by the Christian translations of Genesis where, however, Melchizedek, not Abraham, is the subject of the verse). The question of who gave the tithe to whom was of considerable importance in rabbinical literature. In several places Melchizedek is stated to be a descendant of Noah, and is even identified with Shem the son of Noah. The same sources maintain that his priesthood was taken away from him and bestowed upon Abraham because he blessed Abraham first and only afterward blessed God (Gen. 14:19–20; cf. Ned. 32b; Lev. R. 25:6). Abraham’s priesthood is also mentioned in connection with Psalms 110 (Gen. R., 55:6). In other rabbinical sources Melchizedek is mentioned among the four messianic figures allegorically implied by the “four smiths” of Zechariah 2:3. Melchizedek’s messianic functions are also elaborated in two other literary documents. At the end of several manuscripts of the Slavonic Book of Enoch appears the story of the miraculous birth of Melchizedek as the son of Nir, Noah’s brother. He is transported to heaven and becomes the head of a line of priests leading down to messianic days. There will presumably be another eschatological Melchizedek who will function as both priest and king. In symbolizing Mechizedek as Jesus in his three functions as messiah, king, and high priest (see below) the author’s ingenuity combines all the motives singled out in the above-mentioned sources. A gnostic sect whose particular theological position is unknown called itself after Melchizedek. [Ithamar Gruenwald]\n\nIn Christian Tradition The two brief and somewhat enigmatic references to Melchizedek in the Bible provided the New Testament with a subject for typological interpretation. In the Epistle to the Hebrews (7:1–7), Melchizedek (king of justice – Zedek; of peace – Salem) is described as unique, being both a priest and a king, and because he is “without father, without mother, without genealogy”; he is eternal, “having neither beginning of days nor end of life.” In this respect Melchizedek resembles Jesus, the son of God, and thus is a type of the savior. Abraham, and therefore Levi “in the loins of his father” (ibid. 9–10), paid the tithe in submission to Melchizedek. Since in Christian tradition Jesus is high priest “after the order of Melchizedek” and “not after the order of Aaron” (ibid. 7:11, 17–21), Jesus’ priesthood is excellent, superior to that of\n\n11\n\nmeldola Abraham’s descent, and transcends all human, imperfect orders (Heb. 7:23–28; 8:1–6). To Christians the objection that Jesus, like Aaron, was “in the loins” of the patriarch, and consequently paid the tithe was met by the Church Fathers with the argument that Jesus, though descended from Abraham, had no human father.

Raphael was born in Leghorn, received rabbinical ordination there from Ḥ .J.D. *Azulai in 1796, became a dayyan in 1803, and in 1804/05 was appointed haham of the Sephardi community in London – an office vacant since the death of Moses Cohen d’*Azevedo in 1784. Energetic and capable, he helped to reform the educational institutions of his community in the face of missionary activities, introduced a choir into the synagogue, and cooperated cordially with Solomon *Hirschel, the Ashkenazi chief rabbi. On the other hand, his belligerent nature was responsible for periodic friction with the members of his community. Notwithstanding his imperfect knowledge of English he corresponded extensively with Christian scholars. Before leaving Leghorn, he had published there Ḥ uppat Ḥ atanim (1797), a handbook on the laws of marital life. He also published sermons and memorial poems: part of his catechism Derekh Emunah (The Way of Faith) appeared with his English translation after his death (1848).

Rutilius Namatianus) probably to the fact that from a pagan point of view the Sabbath, with its numerous prohibitions, was “cold,” i.e., “dull.”\n\nmelokhim-bukh the time of Jesus. Together with other bishops of Asia Minor, Melito continued to celebrate Easter on the 14t of Nisan, the eve of Passover. He visited Palestine in an effort to establish an accurate canon (Greek διαυήκη) of the Old Testament (from which he excerpted passages pertaining in some way to Jesus). His list of books (Eusebius, Hist. Eccles. IV, 26:13 f.) corresponds to the Hebrew canon (excluding Esther). Only brief quotations from Melito’s works were known until the mid-20t century, when two papyrus copies of his homily on the Passion (On Pascha) were published. As a result of this discovery, Latin, Coptic, Georgian, and two Syriac translations of this treatise could be identified. The bishop delivered the treatise as a sermon after the biblical account of the Exodus was read on Easter, precisely the time when the Jews observed the Passover feast. The coincidence of observances and Melito’s animosity toward Judaism caused his sermon, which was written between 160 and 170 C.E., to become one of the most important documents of early Christian anti-Judaism. After a theological introduction, Melito gives a dramatic description of Egypt’s sufferings at the time of the Exodus. Influenced by the Midrash on Exodus 10:21, the darkness that engulfed Egypt is described as tangible. However, the events surrounding the Exodus were only a prefiguration of the Passion of Christ, the true Passover lamb. The earlier model no longer had validity and usefulness, because the prefigurations of the Old Testament had become a reality in the New Testament. The second part of the sermon is the oldest and one of the strongest accusations of deicide made against the Jews in early Christian literature. Jews are, among other things, described as having themselves crucified Jesus; and the murder is clearly defined as deicide: “God has been murdered, the King of Israel has been slain by an Israelite hand” (§96). In view of the tragic events suffered by the Jews of this period – the destruction of the Temple and the defeat of Bar Kokhba – Melito could say that, in consequence of the deicide, “Israel lay dead,” while Christianity, “the broad grace,” was conquering the whole earth. The sermon, nevertheless, attests the antiquity of the Passover Haggadah. Paragraph 68 of the sermon contains a Greek version of part of the introduction to Hallel in the Haggadah; and paragraphs 84–85 and 88 derive from the famous Passover litany “Dayyeinu.” Bibliography: Eusebius Pamphili, Ecclesiastical History, 2 vols.

At the turn of the 19t century, Melitopol turned into an important city of metallurgical industries. Part of them, as well as other industries, belonged to Jews, and many Jewish workers were employed in them. On April 19, 1905, a mob attacked Jewish houses, but a Jewish *self-defense group of 300 Jewish and Christian youngsters managed to minimize the pogrom; 15 were wounded and 45 shops (Jewish and Christian) were robbed. In 1910 Melitopol had a talmud torah and two private schools for boys and two for girls. Joseph *Trumpeldor was active in the town and the first ḥ aluẓ im he organized left from there for Palestine. During World War I 2,043 refugees arrived in Melitopol, and were helped by a local aid committee. By 1926 the Jewish population had risen to 8,583 (33.6 of the total), then dropped to 6,040 (8 of the total population). In the 1920s there was a Yiddish school with 63 pupils, which was probably closed later in the 1930s. The ex-bourgeoisie who were denied state rights tried to learn trades and join artisan cooperatives, or went to farm in Birobidzhan or to established kolkhozes in the vicinity of the town. In 1938–40 a clandestine yeshivah operated, but when it was discovered, it moved to Kutaisi (Georgia). Melitopol was occupied by the Germans on October 5, 1941. On October 8 the Jews, about 1,800 families, were concentrated in a ghetto in the flourmill. Intermarried Jews and children from mixed marriage were freed. On October 10 and 15, the Sonderkommando 10a murdered 75 Jewish prisoners of war, and on October 11, 3,000 local Jews. The killings of Jews continued for a year, and on October 9, 1942, the Jewish spouses and children of mixed marriages were brutally killed. About 8,000 Jews, including those from nearby towns, and a few hundred Karaites were murdered. Melitopol was liberated on October 23, 1943. There were 2,500 Jews in 1959, and 1,800 in 1979. There was no synagogue. Most remaining Jews left in the 1990s. Bibliography: Voskhod, nos. 17, 18, 19 (1905); Dubnow, Hist. Russ., 3 (1920), 115.

The Bible mentions it among the vegetables eaten by the Israelites in Egypt, for which they hankered in the wilderness (Num. 11:5). The Hebrew name may possibly be connected with the verb ‫( בטט‬btt) meaning to swell or grow. Watermelons were a familiar plant in Egypt, and a papyrus from the 21st dynasty preserves a pictorial representation of one. The avati’aḥ is frequently mentioned in rabbinical literature. It was comparatively cheap (Ma’as. 2:6) and was usually eaten when ripe, though some ate it as a vegetable while still unripe (Ma’as. 1:5). (2) The muskmelon, Cucumis melo, is called in the Mishnah melafefon (‫) ְמלָ ְפפוֹ ן‬, a name of Greek origin. It is not known if it was grown in biblical times and no Hebrew name exists for it. The Palestinian Targum identifies the biblical avati’aḥ with melafefonya, i.e., the muskmelon, but this does not appear likely, since in a number of places in the Tosefta and Talmud they are mentioned together (Tosef., Kil. 1:1). Some held that these two species do not constitute a mixed species (*kilayim; ibid.) for “a man takes a seed from the upper part of the avati’aḥ and plants it – and it becomes a melafefon” (TJ, Kil. 1:2, 27a), i.e., these species may be interchangeable. This view was taken over from Greek and Roman agricultural folklore which assumed that the characteristics of species were subject to change. An echo of this view is found in the Palestinian Targum in the philological explanation of the name melafefon given by R. Judah: “A man takes one seed from the upper part of an avati’aḥ and one seed from the upper part of an apple and puts them into the same hole, they grow together and become a hybrid species, that is why in Greek it is called melafefon.” The Greek μηλοπέπον and the Latin melopepo both mean “apple-watermelon” probably because the taste of the muskmelon is reminiscent of both the apple and the watermelon. According to Pliny the melopepo originated in Campania from a species of cucumber which looked like a quince (Natural History 19:67). There is certainly no substance for these views, which are based on the polymorphism of the family Cucurbitaceae. The plant Cucumis melo var.

Melton is best known for envisioning and establishing a highly successful program of serious adult Jewish learning called the Florence Melton Adult Mini-School. She was born in Philadelphia, Penn., and raised under the influence of her grandmother, whom she credited for much of her commitment to Jewish education and Jewish values. In 1930 she married Aaron Zacks, with whom she had two sons. In 1946 she and her husband founded the R.G. Barry Corporation, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of soled slippers. She invented the first use of foam in footwear and revolutionized the industry. Zacks died in 1965 and in 1968 she married Samuel Mendel Melton of Columbus, Ohio, a successful businessman and philanthropist. Samuel Melton had endowed the Melton Research Center at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America and the Melton Centre at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and Florence Melton became an active partner in his philanthropic projects as she pursued her own parallel interests. In the early 1980s Melton became convinced that although many Jews were accomplished in their careers, they lacked basic knowledge about Jewish history, philosophy, and religious practices. Hence she began to advocate for the creation of a program of study to help adults attain “Jewish literacy.” She envisioned a well-designed curriculum, taught by engaging and interactive teachers, open to students from across the various Jewish denominations. Adult students, in her view, would need to commit to two years of weekly study. Her ideas were met by skepticism; few people believed that contemporary adults were either interested in Jewish study or would want to view Jewish learning as seriously as her program proposed. Eventually she turned to the Melton Centre for Jewish Education at the Hebrew University, which agreed to recruit sites and develop the curriculum for the project. Melton’s idea turned out to be prescient. Proving the skeptics wrong, Mini-Schools were established in more than 60 cities and thousands of adult students participated in the program. Through its carefully designed organizational structure and its commitment to a serious learning curriculum the Mini-\n\n14\n\nENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14\n\nmeltzer, shimshon School became a model for adult education throughout the Jewish community. In recognition of her communal leadership Melton received a number of awards, including honorary doctorates from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, the Scopus Award from the American Friends of the Hebrew University, and the Ohio State University Distinguished Service Award. She was inducted into the Ohio Women’s Hall of Fame in October 1994. [Barry W. Holtz (2nd ed.)]\n\nMELTON, SAMUEL MENDEL (1900–1993), U.S. industrialist and philanthropist. Melton was born in Saros, AustroHungary. His family immigrated in 1904 to Toledo, Ohio. He established the Capitol Manufacturing and Supply Company in Columbus, as well as several pipe and nipple companies, which later merged with the Harsco Corporation (1968) and became a leader in the metals industry. Melton extended the Capitol Company to Israel in 1949 and deeded it to various Israeli institutions in 1955. Active in numerous communal and national Jewish organizations, he was a member of the UJA “cabinet” and the board of the Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS), where he founded the Melton Research Center in New York (1959) to develop Jewish educational materials. He established the Samuel Mendel Melton Foundation (1951); professorships in Judaica at Ohio State University and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem (1965); a vocational school in Bat Yam, Israel (1968); the Melton Center for Jewish Education in the Diaspora at the Hebrew University (1968); the Melton Building at the Hebrew University; the Melton Journal of the JTS; the Melton Fellowship; the Jewish History and Studies Center at Ohio State University (1976); and the Melton Coalition for Creative Interaction at the JTS, devoted to Jewish arts education (1993).

Born in Tluste (eastern Galicia; present-day Tolstoye), Meltzer immigrated to Palestine in 1933, after having taught in Horodenka (Gorodenka), Galicia. For a time he taught secondary school in Tel Aviv, but from 1937 he engaged in editorial work; first in the daily *Davar, and later in the Am Oved publishing house and in the children’s magazine Davar li-Yladim. From 1959 he was on the editorial staff of the Zionist Library publications of the Jewish Agency. His first poems were published in Ba-Derekh, the magazine of the teachers’ seminary in Lvov where he studied. After his arrival in Ereẓ Israel his poetry appeared mainly in Davar, but also in various literary journals. He published a number of volumes of poems and ballads, including Be-Shiv’ah Meitarim (1939); Me’ir ha-Keleizemar Na’asah Komisar (1940); Asarah She’arim (1943); Alef (1945, 19632), memoirs of the ḥ eder; Sefer ha-Shirot ve-ha-Balladot (1950); and Or Zaru’a (1966). Meltzer attempted to capture the folk flavor of Eastern European Jewry by using ḥ asidic tales and motifs in his ballads. His collection of essays on literature is entitled Devarim al Ofnam (“Words and their Forms,” 1962).

The first explicit reference to Jews in Melun dates from the middle of the 12t century: in his will, Simon of Beaugency mentions a Jew of Melun among his creditors. From the beginning of the 13t century, there is evidence of a Rue des Juifs and an “escole des Juis” (the synagogue). There is no record of a medieval Jewish community after the expulsion of the Jews from the Kingdom of France in 1306. Scholars of Melun took part in the *synod convened by *Samuel b.

The town was founded in the 13t century; the earliest existing document in which Jews are mentioned is dated April 20, 1567, and refers to an edict expelling the Jews from the city. In 1664 the elector of Brandenburg permitted a Jewish merchant from the Netherlands, Moses Jacobson de Jong, to settle in Memel, and eventually Jews were allowed to visit the city for the annual trade fairs. Only after the emancipation of Jews in Prussia (1812) were they able to settle freely in Memel. In the 19t century the community consisted of Eastern European and Prussian Jews. The former had settled in the port in connection with their trans-Baltic business and formed the majority of the Jewish population (in 1880 they accounted for 80 of the total number of Jews). In later years there was an increased influx of Jews from Germany. The number of Jews grew from 887 in 1867, to 1,214 in 1900, and to over 2,000 in 1910. Each group had its own synagogue and communal institutions, but the official community administration was run by German Jews. Israel *Lipkin (Salanter), founder of the Musar movement, lived and taught in Memel 1860–80, founding a bet midrash and societies for Torah study, and publishing here the short-lived periodical Ha-Tevunah (1861). Isaac *Ruelf, one of the spiritual leaders of German Jewry, was rabbi of Memel from 1865 to 1898 and devoted much effort to alleviating the plight of Russian Jews. Ruelf was succeeded by Emanuel Carlebach (until 1904), M. Stein (until 1915), L. Lazarus (until 1932), and S. Schlesinger (until 1939). After World War I, the League of Nations adopted the Memel Convention (1924), whereby it became an autonomous region under Lithuanian rule. As the country’s only port, it played an important role in the economic life of Lithuania, and there was a steady influx of Jews into the city in the interwar period. In March 1939 it had a Jewish population of approximately 9,000 (17 of the total). Most of the Jews were engaged in commerce but there were also a few industrialists. The Memel district also had a few Jewish-owned estates, some of which were made available for hakhsharah. On March 22, 1939, the Germans occupied Memel and incorporated it into the Reich. Most of the Jews managed to flee to *Lithuania, where they later shared the fate of their coreligionists. In 1970 the estimated Jewish population was less than 1,000. There was no synagogue, cemetery, or organized religious life. Bibliography: I.

After completing his studies he returned to Tunis, where he became head of a psychological institute.

ENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14\n\nmemorbuch He specialized in the social effects of colonization, finding a similarity between the situation of the Jew and that of colonized peoples. Though an advocate of independence for the countries of the Maghreb, he was well aware that one of its consequences would be the mass exodus of North African Jewry. Memmi’s first two books were novels, both largely autobiographical. La statue de sel (1953; Pillar of Salt, 1955), is the story of a North African Jew’s emergence from a narrow Jewish society through the discovery of French culture, and his eventual disillusionment with an idealized Western humanism. Agar (1955; Strangers, 1958) describes the isolation of a Tunisian Jew, rejected by both Frenchmen and Arabs. Memmi was still dealing with the same problem a decade later in essays such as Portrait d’un Juif (1962; Portrait of a Jew, 1963) and its sequel, La libération du Juif (1966; The Liberation of the Jew, 1966). He portrays the Jew as a “shadow figure,” neither wholly assimilated nor anxious to lose his distinctiveness, concluding that “Israel is our only solution, our one trump card, our last historical opportunity.” Memmi’s sociological studies appeared in various journals and in Le Français et le racisme (1965). He published an Anthologie des écrivains nord-africains (1964) and a Bibliographie de la littérature nord-africaine d’expression française 1945–1962 (1965). He also wrote essays on Jewish subjects for L’Arche, Evidences, and Commentary.

Jews were present in Memmingen by the second half of the 13t century, since the city statutes of 1270 contain references to Jewish moneylending activities. In 1344 the bishop of Augsburg excommunicated the city for nonpayment of its debts to a Jew; the burghers thereupon threatened to bury their dead in the Jewish cemetery. The Jews made their living in the city in 1373. By 1500, however, there were no Judengasse. The community was destroyed during the *Black Death persecutions of 1348, but Jews were again living in the city in 1373. By 1500, however, there were no longer Jews there. The privilege of Judenfreiheit (“freedom from Jews”), granted in 1541, was renewed in 1559. Many Jews who had formerly lived in Memmingen concentrated in Fellheim, a nearby village, and maintained a settlement there numbering 379 persons (63 of the population) in 1810 (during World War II it again served as a center for refugees). Jews from Fellheim often visited Memmingen for trading purposes during the 17t and 18t centuries. In 1862 the first Jew received citizenship in Memmingen. A community comprising 100 members was formed in 1875, and 20 years later it had grown to 231. A synagogue was dedicated in 1909. The community subsequently declined: from 194 in 1900, to\n\nMEMORBUCH, a community prayer book once common in Jewish communities throughout Central Europe. It consisted of three major parts: (1) a collection of prayers usually intoned by the reader while standing at the almemar (see *Bimah) such as the order of blowing the shofar and reading the Scroll of Esther, different forms of the Mi She-Berakh prayer, etc; (2) a necrology of distinguished persons, either of local or of general Jewish importance; (3) a martyrology of persons and places. The last has been subjected to minute research by scholars, particularly by S. *Salfeld. According to one view the Memorbuch received its name from being placed, for the convenience of the reader, on the almemar, while another holds that it is derived from the Latin memoria. The custom of reading the names developed after the massacres of the *Rhine communities during the First Crusade; to this list were added the names of the martyrs of the *Rindfleisch massacres and other catastrophes. The list of martyrs who perished during the *Black Death persecutions (1348–49) was of such magnitude that mainly names of places were recorded. It became the custom to read off the list of thousands of names in ceremony on the Sabbath before Shavuot (when the massacres of the First Crusade took place); at a later date it was also read off on the Sabbath before the Ninth of Av although the author probably intended it to be read in part each Sabbath.

Moses Levi of Mainz (see *Moellin), the codifier of the Ashkenazi minhag, made the reading of the\n\nENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14\n\n17\n\nBibliography: Sartre, in: Les Temps Modernes, 137–8 (1957), 289–92; Camus, in: A.

The Memorbuch of the Mainz community, begun by Isaac b. Samuel of Meiningen in 1296, was supplemented and became the complete and authoritative version for all other copies. (Salfeld considered the early version to be that of the Nuremberg community, a view not accepted by M. Weinberg, a later authority.) It was updated by mention of the catastrophes of 1492 in *Mecklenburg, and 1510 in *Brandenburg, and by the names of communities which perished in the *Chmielnicki massacres (1648). As no community could be complete without the Memorbuch, it was frequently copied in the 17t and 18t centuries. The Memorbuch was expanded in the different localities to include names of esteemed local personages, lists of deceased, as well as prayers of purely local use and origin. It was therefore never printed and gradually fell into disuse in the mid-19t century, through the unification and standardization of services and ritual. The earliest Memorbuecher (excluding that of Mainz) appeared in about 1600, but between 1650 and 1750 a large number were commenced (based on that of Mainz), for many communities were established in this period. The Memorbuch reflected the religious life of the community and accompanied it in its tribulations and migrations; refugees from Vienna (1670) continued using their Memorbuch in Fuerth; refugees from Fulda (1671) took theirs with them to Amsterdam and subsequently back to Fulda. Some communities had more than one Memorbuch (Fuerth Jewry had five complementary ones). Memorbuecher were particularly common among communities in rural areas; it is estimated that there were about 150 in Bavaria alone and a few hundred more in *Baden, *Wuerttemberg, *Hesse, *Alsace, and *Switzerland. The Memorbuch continues to serve the historian as an important source for the social and religious history of the Jews and is frequently cited. Bibliography: M. Weinberg.

The Memorial Foundation was established with German reparations funds by Nahum Goldmann in 1965 with the mandate to raise up a new generation of scholars, intellectuals, rabbis, and cultural and communal leaders to replace the Jewish cultural elite annihilated in Europe during the Shoah. The Foundation awards scholarships and fellowships to scholars, academicians, writers, artists, rabbis, educators, and communal workers. Funds are also provided to academic and scholarly institutions for research and publication. For the first few decades after its founding, special attention was paid to the Jewish communities in the former Soviet Union countries\n\n18\n\nwhere Jewish life had been suppressed for seven decades under Communist rule. The list of individuals and institutions who received the Foundation’s support since its inception can be found on its Website, www.mfjc.org. In addition to its support of communities and institutions, the Foundation has developed innovative programs to address needs not adequately met by the Jewish community globally. These include the International Nahum Goldmann Fellowship, which prepares communal, cultural, and professional leadership for Jewish communities around the world; reaching the Jewish unaffiliated; Jewish family education; and utilization of new technologies for Jewish culture and education. Currently the Foundation’s programs extend to Jewish communities on six continents, reaching both individuals and institutions at the core of the Jewish community as well as Jews affiliated only marginally with Jewish life. The Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture is committed to the creation, intensification, and dissemination of Jewish culture worldwide, the development of creative programs to meet the emerging needs of the Jewish communities as they enter the 21st century, and service as a central forum for identifying and supporting innovative programs to ensure the continuation of creative Jewish life wherever Jewish communities exist. Its headquarters are in New York. [Jerome Hochbaum (2nd ed.)]\n\nMEMORIAL LIGHT (Heb. ‫“ ;נֵ ר נְ ׁ ָש ָמה‬the light of the soul”), a light kindled on the anniversary of the death of a relative. It is lit on the eve of the anniversary, according to the Hebrew calendar, and should burn without interruption for 24 hours. A memorial candle is also kindled when a person dies (it is placed near his head until the burial) and during the sevenday mourning period, or according to some customs during the sheloshim (“30 days”) after the death. In some communities, it is customary to kindle memorial lights on the eve of the *Day of Atonement. It is generally believed that the custom of memorial lights, as well as that of *yahrzeit, originated in Germany in the Middle Ages and spread from there to other Jewish centers. The medieval custom easily linked up with earlier notions of light as a symbol for the soul as found, e.g., in Proverbs 20:27, “The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord” or in the story about R. *Judah ha-Nasi who asked on his deathbed that a light be kindled in his room after his death (Ket. 103a). In some synagogues memorial lights are lit on the anniversary of departed members of the congregation who have bequeathed money for that purpose. Near the lights (electrical bulbs are used nowadays), nameplates indicate the persons who are being commemorated. Bibliography: I.

(c. 19 km.) south of Cairo, lying partly under the site of the modern village Mit Riheina. According to tradition, Memphis was founded by the legendary Egyptian king Menes (probably the same as King Aha) in about 3100 B.C.E. The Egyptian name Mn-nfr originally designated the pyramid of King Pepi I (c. 2300 B.C.E.) at Saqqara, and was eventually extended to include also the town that grew up around it. By the end of the second millennium the name was probably vocalized “Menufi,” although a papyrus from the late 20t Dynasty (c. 1184–1087 B.C.E.), gives the variant reading Mnf, from which the Coptic Menfi, Arabic Menf, and Hebrew Mof were derived. Until the founding of Alexandria, Memphis played a paramount role in Egypt. As the administrative capital of the Old Kingdom, it had many palaces and temples, particularly that of Ptah, the city’s creator god (with the Apis bull sacred to Ptah being venerated at Memphis); the remains of these structures can still be seen on the site. Literary texts, lavish in their praise and descriptions of the city, indicate that it was a cosmopolitan metropolis with a large, resident foreign population which included Jews (cf. Jer. 44:1); this has been confirmed by archaeological excavation. Foreign divinities worshiped at Memphis include Resheph, Baal, Astarte, and Qudshu. The eventual destruction of Memphis is predicted in Isaiah 19:13; Jeremiah 2:16; 46:14, 19; and Ezekiel 30:13. The city was not in fact destroyed, although it was besieged and taken by the Persians. Memphis was also the place where it was said Antiochus IV Epiphanes received the crown of Egypt. Archaeological excavations have brought to light the large Ptah temple, the palace of Apries, another large ceremonial palace, shrines of Seti I and Rameses II, an embalming house of the Apis bulls, tombs of the high priests, and various settlement remains. A project to record the scattered remains of Memphis through excavation and survey has been undertaken by D. Jeffreys and H.S. Smith for the Egypt Exploration Society since 1982.\n\nMEMPHIS, city in Tennessee, U.S., with a Jewish population of 9,500 (.08 percent of the general population) in 2005. Memphis was first settled in 1818 and the first known Jewish settler, David Hart, arrived in 1838. In the 1840s Jews began to settle in larger numbers, and they acquired land for a cemetery in 1848. In 1850 a Hebrew Benevolent Society was formed, and by 1853 the Jews were “regularly organized” for purposes of worship. In 1935 the Society changed its name to the Jewish Welfare Fund, and in 1977 it became the Memphis\n\nJewish Federation. In 1853, B’nai Israel Congregation (Children of Israel), with 36 members, was granted a charter by the state legislature. The congregation worshiped in rented halls until 1857, and in 1858 converted a bank building into a place of worship. The building was dedicated by Rabbi Isaac Mayer *Wise, the founder of American Reform Judaism, and would later be known as Temple Israel. Rev. Jacob J. Peres, a native of Holland, was the first spiritual leader. In 1860 the relationship between the congregation and Rev. Peres was severed and a new congregation, Beth El Emeth, was organized. From 1860 to 1870 R. Simon Tuska was rabbi of Congregation Children of Israel. At this time, the city’s Jews, some 400 people, worked in banking, barbering, and auctioneering (including slaves); they even operated a racetrack. A good number ran several businesses simultaneously. A few entered the professions; most were small storekeepers who dealt in clothing and dry-goods, groceries and hardware. Memphis suffered little or no damage during the Civil War. Some Memphis Jews served in the army of the Confederacy. From 1863 to 1866 Congregation Children of Israel sponsored a nonsectarian school – Hebrew Educational Institute. The school was to provide educational opportunities during the disruption caused by the war. Following the death of Rabbi Tuska in 1870, Rabbi Max Samfield was elected rabbi of the congregation in 1871 and served until 1915. In addition to serving the congregation, Samfield published The Jewish Spectator from 1885 until his death. This paper served the Jews of Memphis and the mid-South. In 1884 the Orthodox Baron Hirsch Congregation was organized and in 1891 converted a church as a place of worship. The first rabbi was Benjamin Mayerowitz. It became the largest synagogue in the United States. In recent years it moved to a new, smaller sanctuary to be within the area with the highest concentration of Jews in East Memphis. Congregation Anshei Sphard was organized in 1898. Beth Sholom, a Conservative congregation, was established in 1950 and in 1967 dedicated its new synagogue. Like many Jews in the Memphis community, Beth Sholom’s rabbi at that time, Rabbi Arie Becker, was well known for his involvement in the civil rights movement. Long-time Rabbi Zalman Posner was a ḥ asid of the rebbe, but he served in a congregational role. Official Chabad Lubavitch of Tennessee was founded in Memphis in 1994. Under the leadership of Rabbi Levi Klein, Chabad quickly became an active part of Memphis Jewish life. A B’nai B’rith Lodge was organized in 1856 and in 1927 the B’nai B’rith Home was established to serve the Jews of Memphis and the mid-South. It was completely rebuilt in the 1960s and dedicated in 1968 as the B’nai B’rith Home and Hospital. The Jewish Community Center was organized in 1949 and in 1968 dedicated a $2,000,000 edifice, and the Jewish Historical Society of Memphis and the Mid-South was established in 1986. Jews have been active in the economic, political, and civic life of the community. The Goldsmith family, leading\n\nENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14\n\n19\n\nBibliography: W.F.

The Jewish community was so well accepted in Memphis that in the 1920s, it chose not to build a Jewish hospital, fearing that it might alienate the non-Jewish medical community and lead to a restriction of their hospital privileges. Abe Plough, a native of Tupelo, Mississippi, was generally regarded as one of the foremost citizens of the community by virtue of his philanthropy. His company was bought out by Schering to form Schering-Plough, a pharmaceutical giant. He played an important role in settling the famous sanitation strike of 1968 that brought Martin Luther King, Jr., to town, the site of his assassination in April 1968, contributing money anonymously to offset the costs to the city of pay raises. Other families who generously supported the entire Memphis community include the Fogelman, Lipman, Lowenstein, Lemsky, and Belz families. The Jews have also served as presidents of the bar association and the medical society. The Jewish population has remained relatively stable for more than 80 years. It has received 200 Holocaust survivors and 300 Russians. The community’s hub shifted to East Memphis, the heart of Jewish life today. The community boasts the Bornblum Judaic Studies Program, established in 1985 at the University of Memphis through the generosity of David Bornblum and Bert Bornblum. The program brings numerous scholars and lecturers to the community. As in many college towns, the town-gown gap is bridged by the Judaic Studies Program. There are two Jewish days schools: the Bornblum Solomon Schechter Conservative day school, and the Orthodox Margolin Hebrew Academy Feinstone Yeshiva of the South, which honors Harry Feinstone. The Orthodox community of Memphis was described by Tova Mirvis in her highly acclaimed novel The Ladies Auxiliary (1999). Bibliography: R.

Menahem seized the throne after assassinating *Shallum son of Jabesh (15:14). Shallum and Menahem may possibly have competed for the throne during the decline of the house of *Jehu. It is widely believed that both were among the officers from Gilead, a group which had been influential from the beginning of Jehu’s reign (of. II Kings 9:1ff.; 15:25). Both Jabesh (the name of the principal city of Gilead) and Gadi (the name of a tribe) are designations pointing to the fact that both Menahem and Shallum were of Transjordanian origin. The struggle between the two was conducted with great cruelty. II Kings 15:16 states: “At that time Menahem sacked Tiphsah and all who were in it and its territory.” Tiphsah is Thapsacus which is on the River Euphrates, east of Aleppo. From this statement it appears that Menahem’s campaign extended to the Euphrates. However, most scholars\n\n20\n\nmaintain that in light of the political-military situation of the Kingdom of Israel since the end of the reign of *Jeroboam II, it is not possible that Menahem ruled over such a large kingdom, and they therefore accept the Lucian version of the Septuagint, where Tappuah appears instead of Tiphsah (cf. Josh. 16:8; 17:8). In view of the biblical chronological data with regard to Menahem and *Pekah, several scholars concluded that Menahem rul"
