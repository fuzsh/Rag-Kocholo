Portugal is a country located in Southwestern Europe, bordered by Spain. It has a population of around 10.6 million people, with about half living in the metropolitan areas of Porto and Lisbon. Portugal has a long history dating back to pre-Roman times and was an early global colonial power during the Age of Discovery from the 15th to 16th centuries. It established a global empire and was the first country to circumnavigate the globe. Portugal transitioned to a democratic republic in 1910 and its overseas territories gained independence in the 20th century. Today it is a developed country and member of the EU and NATO.",
