        "text": "Four European museums of modern art have been selected for this study – Tate Modern, Centre Georges Pompidou, Stedelijk Museum and Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia – precisely for their localization in former colonizer countries. They thus lend themselves perfectly to a survey on the ways postcoloniality interacts – or not – with their conception of the role of museums at the beginning of the 21st Century. Guiding lines for a hypothetical handbook of \"Postcolonial Theories for Museums\", that could be useful to dismantle the colonial foundations of museums of modern art, are sketched from the conclusions of this survey.\n\nThis is a midway PhD project – produced as part of an exhibition (also titled 'The Museum of Dissensus), part of a series ('Ex Libris Fisherarium') exploring intersections between plastic and literary art forms, curated by David Corbet at the Fisher Library, University of Sydney, from October 2016-February 2016. It contains an introductory essay by David Corbet and essays and text extracts by several other writers: Susan Best, Ivan Muñiz Reed and Matt Poll. It features images and texts (from numerous cited sources) exploring the work of 49 artists: Abdul Abdullah, Jumana Emil Abboud, Vernon Ah Kee, Tony Albert, Francis Alÿs, Kader Attia, Tania Bruguera, Nick Cave, Aslı Çavuşoğlu, Chimurenga, Dadang Christanto, Destiny Deacon and Virginia Fraser, Karla Dickens, Fiona Foley, Félix González-Torres, Guerrilla Girls, Julie Gough, Dale Harding, Edgar Heap of Birds, Pierre Huyghe, Guo Jian, Jonathan Jones, Jumaadi, Yuki Kihara, Glenn Ligon, Laura Lima, Teresa Margolles, Shaghayegh Mazloom, Queenie Nakarra McKenzie, Kent Monkman, Zanele Muholi, Clinton Nain, Paulo Nazareth, Ramesh Mario Nithiyendran, Fiona Pardington, Mike Parr, Ben Quilty, Imran Qureshi, Rosanna Raymond’s SaVAge K’lub, Marwan Rechmaoui, Lisa Reihana, Doris Salcedo, Alex Seton, Hito Steyerl, James Tylor, Adriana Verejão, Kemang Wa Lehulere, Kara Walker, Jason Wing.\n\nThis chapter tracks a single work of art, 'Projeto terra' by Juraci Dórea, through the archival traces of three successive biennials – São Paulo in 1987, Venice in 1988 and Havana in 1989. Drawing on the documentation amassed by Dórea himself, critical readings of each exhibition context are developed and breaks with the official record are examined. In particular, the São Paulo initiative is presented as the postmodern heir to the Venice Biennale’s aging modernism, postmodernism being identified here with a Brazilian concept of the baroque. In this context, Projeto terra is then considered as a productively disruptive force, and some discursive possibilities are explored. Are these possibilities then diminished or amplified in the Cuban Bienal of 1989? What becomes apparent through this geographical and historical parcours is not only how the historiography of works and exhibitions (in this case biennials) might be intertwined, but also how a single work may, over time, either endorse or undo curatorial intentions. First given as a paper at the World Biennial Forum, no.2, in São Paulo, November 2014, this chapter is published in the resulting digital book (issuu.com/iccoart/docs/wbf_book_r5_issuu) (printable: http://www.biennialfoundation.org/2015/05/out-now/). Please note that image captions incorrectly reproduced: second image (p.41) shows the Bienal de São Paulo, 1987."
