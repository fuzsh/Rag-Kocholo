        "text": "In a brief fashion, this paper covers the history of the Chicano Art movement from its origins in the 1960s up to some of its more recent expressions. The essay also includes a succinct history of the Chicano socio-political movement, since the author maintains that the Chicano art is interrelated and interdependent to it. On the artistic movement’s history, it is noted the significant influence of the Mexican Muralist Movement and other Mexican artists, like Frida Kahlo. It is also remarked the fundamental importance of the indigenous Mexican Pre-Columbian art forms and myths. On the description of the movement, the paper states that the essence of the Chicano Art movement is to provide an artistic outlet to the Chicanos social demands, helping the Mexican-American community to find and define its own identity as an American ethnic group, with the purpose of empowering it. As the American society becomes more diverse, the Chicano art movement moves forward, progressively assimilating to the American cultural mainstream.\n\nOriginating in the context of the Civil Rights Movements and political activities addressing issues of race, gender and sexuality, the Women's Liberation movement and the Chicano Movement became departures for two significant counter art movements in Los Angeles in the 1970s. This article explores some of the various reasons why Anglo American feminist artists and Chicana artists were not able to fully collaborate in the 1970s, provides some possible explanations for their separation, and argues that the Eurocentric imperative in visual fine art was challenged already in the 1970s by Chicana/o artists in Los Angeles. In so doing, the art activism by Anglo American feminists and Chicanas/os is comparatively investigated with Los Angeles as the spatial framework and the 1970s as the time frame. Four main components are discussed: their respective political aims, alternative art spaces, pedagogical frameworks and aesthetic strategies. The study found that the art activisms by Anglo American feminists and Chicanas/os differed. These findings suggest that a task ahead is to open up a dialogue with Chicana/o activist art, making space for more diverse representations of activities and political issues, both on the mainstream art scene and in the history of art.\n\nThis article departs from the huge art-curating project Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A., 1945–1980, a Getty funded initiative running in Southern California from October 2011 to April 2012 with a collaboration of more than sixty cultural institutions coming together to celebrate the birth of the L.A. art scene. One of the Pacific Standard Time (PST) exhibitions was Asco: Elite of the Obscure, A Retro- spective, 1972–1987, running from September to December 2011 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). This was the first retrospective of a conceptual performance group of Chicanos from East Los Angeles, who from the early 1970s to the mid 1980s acted out critical interventions in the politically con- tested urban space of Los Angles. In conjunction with the Asco retrospective at LACMA, the Getty Foundation co-sponsored a new street mural by the Chicano artist Willie Herrón, paying homage to his years in the performance group Asco. The PST exhibition program also included so-called Mural Remix Tours, taking fine art audiences from LACMA to Herrón’s place-specific new mural in City Terrace in East Los Angeles. This article analyze the inclusion in the PST project of Herrón’s site-specific mural in City Terrace and the Mural Remix Tours to East Los Angeles with regard to the power relations of fine art and critical subculture, center and periphery, the mainstream and the marginal. As a physical monument dependent on a heavy sense of the past, Herrón’s new mural, titled Asco: East of No West, transforms the physical and social environment of City Terrace, changing its public space into an official place of memory. At the same time, as an art historical monument officially added to the civic map of Los Angeles, the mural becomes a permanent reminder of the segregation patterns that still exist in the urban space of Los Angeles.\n\nThis essay examines the murals of the Chicano movement, which flourished in the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1960s, through the lens of colonial Latin American iconography. Murals were a powerful means of communication as Chicano artists sought to address the marginalization and political isolation of Mexican-Americans in society. Much of the scholarship regarding murals completed in the late 1960’s through the 1980’s decodes the use of indigenous icons and Mesoamerican modes of representation. While this emphasis on the pre-colonial era has been made clear, there are indisputable instances of colonial visual remnants in Chicano murals, and their function serves as an artistic form of resistance against past or present injustices. Examining these murals through the lens of colonial Latin American art and identity allows audiences to come to terms with a complex history, and find instances of beauty in an oppressive past."
