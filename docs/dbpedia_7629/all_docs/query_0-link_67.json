        "text": "Citation preview\n\nThe Translation and Transmission of Concrete Poetry\n\nThis volume addresses the global reception of “untranslatable” concrete poetry. Featuring contributions from an international group of literary and translation scholars and practitioners, working across a variety of languages, the book views the development of the international concrete poetry movement through the lens of “transcreation”, that is, the informed, creative response to the translation of playful, enigmatic, visual texts. Contributions range in subject matter from ancient Greek and Chinese pattern poems to modernist concrete poems from the Americas, Europe and Asia. This demanding body of experimental work offers creative challenges and opportunities to literary translators and unique pleasures to the sympathetic reader. Highlighting the ways in which literary influence is mapped across languages and borders, this volume will be of interest to students and scholars of experimental poetry, translation studies and comparative literature. John Corbett is a CAPES International Fellow and Visiting Professor in the Department of Modern Languages at the University of Sao Paulo. His numerous books and articles include Language and Scottish Literature (1997) and Written in the Language of the Scottish Nation: A History of Literary Translation into Scots (1999). Ting Huang is a literary translator and doctoral candidate in the E ­ nglish Department at the University of Macau, where she took an MA in Translation Studies in the Portuguese Department and her Bachelor’s degree in Portuguese Studies. She has translated Azul Corvo, by Brazilian novelist, Adriana Lisboa (2019).\n\nRoutledge Advances in Translation and Interpreting Studies\n\n36 A (Bio)Semiotic Theory of Translation The Emergence of Social-Cultural Reality Kobus Marais 37 A Sociological Approach to Poetry Translation Modern European Poet-Translators Jacob S.

The round table and the editors’ own research was financially supported by a University of Macau Multi-Year Research Grant: MYRG2015–00080-FAH ‘Mapping the Literary Avant Garde, 1950–2000: A pilot study.’ A number of the chapters in this volume were presented in draft form at this seminar, which was also attended by Lucas Klein, Peter McCarey, and David McAleavey, as well as graduate students and staff members from the Departments of English and Portuguese. Stranded in Hong Kong by a typhoon for the duration of the seminar, Tong King Lee travelled to Macao on a later date to deliver a presentation on experimental writing in translation. While not everyone who presented at the seminar and its offshoots is represented in this volume (and, conversely, it contains contributions by scholars who were not present in the seminar), we are grateful to all the original participants for their input, lively discussions and encouragement; they have, directly and indirectly, influenced the content of the book. We also appreciate contributors’ patience, as the volume has slowly taken shape. A special mention goes to James McGonigal, for his generous collegiality and advice throughout and beyond this project, and to Simone Homem de Mello and Augusto de Campos for their help in tracking down copyright holders. The book could not have been completed without the love and constant support of Jiuhai Huang, Chunhong Fan and Augusta Alves. Every effort has been made to trace and secure the copyright of literary texts and images. The editors apologise if any material has been included without appropriate acknowledgement and would be happy to address any oversights in future editions.

It was later printed in Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum (1652), a work ‘containing severall poeticall pieces of our famous ­English philosophers, collected, with annotations, by Elias Ashmole.’1 In its original sense, now obsolete, ‘concrete’ meant ‘united or connected by growth; growing together.’ It seems apt to revive this sense in the context of the present volume, which considers the roots, growth, flourishing and cross-pollination of different phases of ‘concrete poetry,’ over time and space. Despite the impersonality of its form, as we shall see, concrete poetry is and has been a curiously sociable literary genre, both in modern and ancient times. The form has always demanded and indeed created a readership that is in tune with its oblique linguistic games, and its more recent practitioners have actively sought out poets of like mind, at home and abroad. The practice and appreciation of concrete poetry ‘unites and connects’ across cultures and languages, enriching both, in part by presenting translation challenges that have demanded creative, ingenious solutions. Only from the later 16th century does ‘concrete’ evolve from a participle (e.g. ‘concrete into a stone’) into an adjective that expresses ‘congealed’ or ‘solid.’ It is this concern with materiality, of course, that primarily characterises concrete poetry, whether it is made manifest graphically or phonetically. The material on which the written poem is carved, embroidered, typed, printed or projected – whether rock, silk, a white page, canvas, a wall or computer screen – becomes part of the communicative process. Sound poetry, in turn, foregrounds the substance of the voice, its aural quiddities, in live performance or via an audio or video recording. Of course, as Susan Bassnett reminds us early in this volume, all poetry plays with the material patterning of sound and, to a certain extent, the graphic qualities of text, in that we can recognise a traditional poem as a poem because it has a regular metrical or rhythmical pattern, pronounced consonance, assonance and rhyme, and falls into an array of lines on the page. Concrete poetry, however, focuses on visual and/or aural substance to the apparent detriment of sense. The traditional metrical pattern, and even the regular poetic line,\n\n2 John Corbett are disrupted, and the reader is invited to interpret creatively the interaction among the elements of the graphic or phonetic forms of the characters, and the visual or vocal spaces in which they are situated. When, in the early 20th century, Ezra Pound, whose poetry and essays influenced many of the avant-garde poets discussed in the present volume, urged his fellow poets to deal with the ‘concrete’, he did not have in mind a concern with the literal materiality of the text itself. In his essay, ‘A Few Don’ts by an Imagiste’ (1913), Pound makes the following recommendation: Use no superfluous word, no adjective which does not reveal something. Don’t use such an expression as ‘dim lands of peace.’ It dulls the image. It mixes an abstraction with the concrete. It comes from the writer’s not realizing that the natural object is always the adequate symbol. 2 For Pound, the essence of ‘concrete’ lay in its contrast with ‘abstract’ and, in this early period of his literary career, to make a poem concrete was to deal with unvarnished images. Not long after he published this brief manifesto, he would become the literary executor of Ernest Fenollosa, and embrace the sinologist’s theory that the Chinese ideogram was a natural medium for poetry, in that the Chinese written character allegedly bears within it the visual, embodied origins of its meaning. In Pound’s edition of Fenollosa’s essay on the poetic qualities of the ideogram, or ideograph, the notion of ‘concrete’ again resurfaces in the discussion of its pictorial qualities: For example, the ideograph meaning ‘to speak’ is a mouth with two words and a flame coming out of it. The sign meaning ‘to grow up with difficulty’ is grass with a twisted root. But this concrete verb quality, both in nature and in the Chinese signs, becomes far more striking and poetic when we pass from such simple, original pictures to compounds. In this process of compounding, two things added together do not produce a third thing but suggest some fundamental relation between them.3 Pound practised the ‘ideogrammic method’ for much of his later career; his poetry proceeds in part by placing ‘concrete’ images adjacently so that the reader infers their abstract relation. But Pound’s ideogrammic method, for all its emphasis on the concrete, is not yet ‘concrete poetry.’ Only later did a new generation of visual and sound poets reinterpret Pound and Fenollosa to create a new kind of ideogram (albeit one with ancient precedents, in the West and East), that is, a poem as an ‘original picture,’ or as a series of vocal sounds, whose enigmatic, compounded elements must somehow be related to produce meaning.\n\nIntroduction 3 The reinterpretation of Pound and Fenollosa’s conception of the ­ hinese ideogram by later Western avant-garde poets drew also on a C sense of ‘concrete’ that is not recorded in the OED until 1834, namely ‘A composition of stone chippings, sand, gravel, pebbles, etc., formed into a mass with cement; used for building under water, for foundations, pavements, walls, etc.’ The development of reinforced concrete in the 19th century led to its use in a number of modernist architectural movements in the 20th century, from the constructivist buildings of Soviet Russia in the 1920s and 1930s to the Brutalist architecture of Europe and Brazil in the 1950s and 1960s. The association of concrete as a building material with unvarnished, progressive modernity wedded the first phase of concrete poetry to a modernist architectural aesthetic, as Chris M ­ cCabe observes in his chapter in this volume. The first recorded use of ‘concrete poetry’ in the OED is indeed the English translation of the Brazilian ‘Noigandres’ poets’ manifesto for the new literary genre, ‘Pilot Plan for Concrete Poetry’ (1958), a document that alludes directly to the architect, Lúcio Costa’s Plano Piloto de Brasília (1957), the blueprint for Brazil’s new, futuristic, concrete, capital city. Much like the curvaceous modernist buildings that Oscar Niemeyer designed for Brazil’s utopian capital, there is an essential playfulness to concrete poems, a feature identified in Susan Bassnett’s opening chapter as one that also presents practical challenges to the translator. Bassnett relates the pleasurable playfulness of concrete poetics to its manifestation in poetry more generally; nevertheless, the conceptual wittiness of concrete poetry does seem to demand particularly inventive responses from those who seek to reconstitute it anew in a different language. The very act of attempting to translate the apparently untranslatable results in a necessary redefinition of the process of translation itself. In an essay on cultures in circulation, Homi Bhabha writes: Translation is an iterative process of revision that moves back and forth in geographic circulation and discursive mobility, each time motivated by what is ‘untranslatable’ – from one language to another, from one culture toward others – and therefore must be the cause for starting again from another place, another time, another history.4 The geographical and temporal transmission of ‘untranslatable’ concrete poetry, and the consequent, necessary reinvention of translation in the process are the primary concerns of the present volume. The challenges of reinvention have been met by non-translations, literal translations, translations-with-exegesis and creative translational strategies that are so innovative that they require new ways to describe them, giving rise to coinages such as ‘transcreations’ and ‘intraductions.’ The dissemination and circulation of concrete poetry goes beyond the body of work itself, to the translation of its neo-modernist manifestos,\n\n4 John Corbett and to oft-repeated legends of its origins, and accounts of its apparently spontaneous eruption in various countries in the middle years of the 20th century. However, two complementary chapters follow Bassnett’s lead in offering a useful corrective to the notion that the governing principles of concrete poetry are a purely modernist invention. Despite its avant-garde progressiveness and novelty, concrete poetry has precedents that stretch back well beyond the 20th century, as the chapters by Juliana di Fiori Pondian and Li Li demonstrate. Di Fiori Pondian argues that the Alexandrian poets, of around the 3rd century bce, who produced the Greek pattern poems known as technopaegnia, pioneered most of the features that we now associate with concrete poetry, namely a visual and aural iconography, and a dense, puzzling, playful, textual content that teaches the reader new ways of reading. She illustrates her argument with a detailed analysis of ‘Syrinx’, attributed to Theocritus, and a discussion of how a selection of contemporary Western translators into English, Portuguese, Spanish and French has attempted to solve the problems it poses. The modern translator of a proto-concrete poem like ‘Syrinx’ needs not only to reconstitute the visual shape and aural patterning of the source text in the target language; even more demanding are the challenges of reconstituting the dense verbal allusions to Greek literary culture and of reproducing the riddling linguistic tricks that obfuscate the poem’s content. The issues of interpretation and translation that are raised in this chapter echo, time and again, throughout the volume. If concrete poetics drew on Fenollosa and Pound’s conception of the Chinese ideogram, it is reasonable to ask how, if at all, concrete poetics have been and are represented in Chinese literature. In her chapter, Li Li shows that the Chinese ideogram was indeed used in ancient Chinese pattern poetry, though (unlike the case of the ‘Syrinx’) the visual patterns, which include graphic representations of pagodas and tortoises, were not necessarily related to the content of the poem. The complex aural and visual patterning of the Chinese characters themselves is practically impossible to reproduce in contemporary Western translations. The discussion of Chinese characters is further complicated by the fact that ideograms are found in ‘simplified’ forms, officially adopted by the People’s Repulic of China in 1949, and in ‘traditional’ forms, which are still used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. Both simplified and traditional styles are represented in the present volume, in the chapters by Li Li and Chen Li, respectively. As Li Li observes, early Chinese pattern poems were marginal to mainstream literature; they were social and occasional poems written to prove the author’s ingenuity and wit, as a token of comradeship or demonstration of love. One example discussed is a petition poem, whose medium (a palindromic poem in the shape of a tortoise, embroidered on silk) was part of the gift to a ruler who had the power to grant a favour. The tradition of writing these sociable or petitionary pattern poems, though peripheral in Chinese literary history, survived into the early 20th century, when the techniques filtered\n\nIntroduction 5 into Chinese modernist poetry that paralleled developments in the West, without necessarily being in direct contact with it. Li Li considers the case of the Hong Kong poet, Ou Waiou (鸥外鸥), active from the 1930s, whose literary experiments in many ways recall those of e. e. cummings in the West and equally prefigure concrete poetics. A Chinese visual poet of the present day, Yin Caigan (尹才干) also appears to have reinvented aspects of familiar concrete poetics, without much evidence of direct contact with the avant-garde tradition elsewhere. Ou Waiou and Yin Caigan are potent reminders that the ‘spontaneous’ eruption of concrete poetics can still happen without much apparent influence from outside. When East-West contact does occur, as in the case of Chen Li (陳黎), the distinguished Taiwanese poet who discusses his own experimental work and its translations in the present volume, the Chinese concrete poem becomes almost a textbook illustration of Pound’s conception of the ideogrammic method. In Chen Li’s most celebrated poem, ‘A War Symphony,’ we see a Chinese character (兵) being ‘dismembered’ into 乒 and 乓, until it becomes a new ideogram (丘). From the conceptual frame given by the title of the poem, and the visual conjunction and meanings (and, indeed, sounds) of these characters, the reader is invited to construct a narrative that engenders meanings beyond those of the characters in isolation. Chen Li’s experimental poetry in Chinese represents Asian literary culture’s re-appropriation of Western avant-garde modernist aesthetics, channelled from Pound via the Chicago Review anthology of concrete poetry that he read as a student. While Susan Bassnett, Juliana di Fiori Pondian and Li Li discuss precursors of modern Western and Asian concrete poems, which extend to 17th-century pattern poems, such as George Herbert’s ‘Eastern Wings’ and Apollinaire’s ‘calligrams,’ the heart of the present volume consists of an extended series of chapters that deal with a small but important group of concrete poets and translators who contributed to the main wave of Western concrete poetry from the 1950s to the 1970s. Among the Brazilian pioneers of the form, the brothers Augusto and Haroldo de Campos, who made up two-thirds of the ‘Noigandres’ group, both pioneered the form and contributed to its theorisation. Fenollosa’s conception of the poetic nature of the Chinese ideogram and Pound’s advocacy of the ‘ideogrammic method’ were central to their literary programme. Claus Clüver’s chapter on the ‘Brazilian ideogram’ illustrates the ways in which the de Campos brothers and their contemporaries rethought Fenollosa’s linguistics and Pound’s poetics to give a conceptual framework for the new genre of concrete poetry, and Clüver discusses how these ‘Brazilian ideograms’ have been rendered in English. K. David Jackson’s chapter on Haroldo de Campos’s ‘transcreations’ takes up the issue of his translation practices in particular, and addresses two issues: first, the way in which Haroldo’s ‘cannibalisation’ of world literature through translation realises a tenet of Brazilian modernism that originates in Oswald de Andrade’s Manifesto Antropófago (1928), and, second, how the desire\n\n6 John Corbett to translate the untranslatable, to paraphrase Bhabha, above, led Haroldo to the concept of ‘transcreation.’ Haroldo de Campos’ reimagining of the literary translator’s task involves the translator in going beyond the literal paraphrasing of the source text, often accompanied by exegetical matter (as seen, largely, in the more literal translations of ‘Syrinx’), and gives him or her the role of effectively composing an original text that seeks to recreate the impact on the target culture that the original work had on the source culture. Among the most distinguished of the English language translators of the Brazilian concretistas was the Scottish poet, Edwin Morgan. Morgan’s active engagement with the experimental poetry of the de Campos brothers, among others, arguably influenced his own poetry. Ting Huang’s chapter on Morgan’s translation of Haroldo de Campos’ Servidão de Passagem as ‘Transient Servitude’, which was informed by an extended correspondence between de Campos and Morgan, gives a valuable insight into the source poem, a key text in the ‘second phase’ of concrete poetry, and how it was ‘transcreated’ into English. Turning to another pioneer of concrete poetry, Raquel Abi-Sâmara contributes a chapter on the poetics of Eugen Gomringer’s ‘constellations.’ While Gomringer and the Brazilian Noigandres poets collaborated, and agreed together on the ‘concrete’ label for the new form, Gomringer’s view of the ‘constellation’ differed from the de Campos brothers’ view of the ideogram. As Abi-Sâmara shows, Gomringer was much more influenced by visual aesthetics than by Poundian imagism, and he sought in his ‘constellations’ to achieve a universal language that would render translation unnecessary. Indeed, some concrete poems, like Gomringer’s ‘ping pong’ (1953), which consists of an arrangement of these two onomatopoeic words in such a way as visually to suggest a table-tennis match with two players, seem to require no translation, at least into languages that use the Roman alphabet. But other concrete poems do seem to find themselves in translation. When, for example, Virna Teixeira came to produce a Brazilian version of Edwin Morgan’s sound poem, ‘The Loch Ness Monster’s Song’, the Scottish poet encouraged her to change the phonetic structure. In an early version, she kept Morgan’s lines as they were simply providing a literal gloss of the title in Portuguese, as A Canção Do Monstro Do Lago Ness. However, in a later published version, she Brazilianised the song. Thus, while Morgan’s monster disappears under the surface to the sound of ‘blm plm/blm plm/blm plm/blp,’ Teixeira’s monster descends to ‘blu plb/blu plb/ blu plb/blb.’5 Even a universal language, it seems, can have local dialects. By this point in the volume, it should be clear that the conjunction of concrete poetry and translation results in an array of different possible strategies for rendering into different languages enigmatic literary texts that foreground their formal ingenuity and materiality. This expansion of the frontiers of translation remains a consistent motif through different phases of the concrete poetry project, right up to the present day. Simone\n\nIntroduction 7 Homem de Mello’s chapter is a valuable discussion of Augusto de Campos’ more recent poetry, which extends the early poetics of the concrete movement into an allusive ‘verbivocovisual’ mode that effectively inhabits the translational spaces between different media. Like the poet of the ancient Greek ‘Syrinx,’ Augusto de Campos in a series of later poems demands the reader juggle a wealth of allusive references. He calls these poems intraduções (‘intraductions’), which, alongside his brother, Haroldo’s ‘transcreations’ represent a distinctive mode of literary translation that continues to trace their origin to the aesthetics of concretismo. The encounter with the enigmatic and ‘untranslatable’ concrete poem in one language and the challenge of reconstituting it in another have contributed to literary innovation across languages and cultures. The processes of writing and translation are themselves enmeshed in a web of other activities, including magazine and book editing and publishing, exhibiting in public spaces such as galleries and parks, and, increasingly, transmission via websites. What concrete poetry and its translation represent for its practitioners and readers is continually renegotiated in and through such activities. One of the most important of these activities, in the days before digital communications, was physical correspondence. Odile Cisneros’ chapter testifies to the importance of correspondence and personal contacts to the transmission of concrete poetry in Central and North America. She notes that, as with the case of China, concrete poetry has tended to exist on the margins of the literary tradition in the United States, despite the importance of international anthologies published there in the 1960s and 1970s. American concrete poets were influenced by contacts with like minds in Central and South America, with the de Campos brothers again emerging as influential figures, directly and indirectly. The relationship between concrete poetry and architecture in Mexico parallels that found in other countries, while the relative longevity of concrete poetry in Canada has been supported by a particular infrastructure of government-funded support for the literary and visual arts there. John Corbett takes the specific case of the Scottish poet and translator, Edwin Morgan, and considers how his correspondence with other agents in the concrete poetry movement positions him in an international network of concrete poets, translators, scholars, gallery curators, editors, publishers and interested readers. By drawing in part on the methods of social network analysis, Corbett seeks to show how the meaning and ethos of concrete poetry and associated practices, such as ‘transcreation,’ were negotiated by central and peripheral players in Morgan’s global correspondence network. Finally, Chris McCabe looks at the recent translations that have occurred as concrete poetry has been reassessed and integrated into the digital poetics of the 21st century. Revisiting the ‘translation’ of an architectural ethos into the poetics of the original Noigandres poets, ­McCabe traces this vital line into the poetry that is made possible by digital media. As the chapters amply demonstrate, a poetry that foregrounds its\n\n8 John Corbett materiality will be affected by the arrival of new media, and the affordances of computer screens, algorithmic manipulation, and digital projection have led to a reappraisal of concrete poetry and a reinvigoration of concrete practices, even as the concrete has become largely ‘virtual.’ The present volume cannot, of course, hope to be comprehensive in its coverage. There are obvious lacunae: individual, generic and geographical. Given the emphasis on the de Campos brothers, more space might have been given to their fellow Noigandres poet, Décio Pignatari’s equally innovative translation practices. Visual poetry in the Cyrillic and Arabic alphabets is also overlooked here, not because of any lack of interest or importance in these subjects, but because the space and time required to give them adequate coverage was lacking.6 That said, the chapters in the present volume offer a variety of perspectives and instances of scholarship and practice on three continents, extending from the Americas through Europe to Asia. There is a certain amount of repetition and overlap, as is inevitable when individual authors approach a common topic; however, the result is, we hope, a set of lively, reverberating conversations that the reader is invited to participate in and extend. Active engagement in the production of meaning has always been characteristic of the form, from the earliest conundrums of ‘Syrinx’ (di Fiori Pondian) and the sociable ingenuity of ‘Tea’ (Li Li) to witty digital installations such as the ‘Adam and Eve Sonnet’ (McCabe). As the chapters that follow demonstrate, at its most intense, this engagement takes the form of creative transcreation.\n\nNotes 1 ‘concrete, adj. and n.’ OED Online. March 2019.

For a start, the sonnet is composed in alexandrines, rather than in the expected iambic pentameter, and the last three lines offer an absurd image of a pregnant male poet struggling with his own inability to write: Thus great with child to speak and helpless in my throes Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite, ‘Fool’, said my Muse to me, ‘Take up thy pen and write.’ The reader is invited to smile at this admission of helpless foolishness. The Muse chastises the poet, and were that Muse a contemporary of ours, she would be saying, simply, ‘Just get on with it.’ However serious the love Sidney felt for his Stella might be, and the ensuing sonnets build on that emotion, this opening poem sets a more joking tone and uses an unfamiliar form. This was, in its day, a very avant-gardist piece of writing. Centuries later, the Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh used a comic parallel with his own local community to write about the Trojan War. In his sonnet, ‘Epic’ he draws ironic parallels between the Trojan War and local rivalry. The opening lines set the scene: I have lived in important places, times When great events were decided, who owned That half a rood of rock, a no-man’s land Surrounded by our pitchfork-armed claims. The local Duffys confront old McCabe, ‘stripped to the waist,’ and Kavanagh then widens the gyre noting ‘That was the year of the Munich bother,’ the year, of course, when the seeds of the Second World War were sown. The poet asks himself which was more important, the local\n\n10 Susan Bassnett conflict or what politicians were failing to resolve in Munich, and then concludes with these lines: Homer’s ghost came whispering to my mind He said: I made the Iliad from such A local row. Gods make their own importance.1 In both these poems the reader is confronted with the unexpected: Sidney mocks himself, and in so doing pokes fun at love poetry in general, while Kavanagh weaves the narrative of the Trojan War, the Second World War and a local struggle between Irish peasants together to show both the absurdity and the tragedy of conflicts over land, comparing the greatest poem in the Western canon to a fight between local Irish families. In both these examples the reader is engaged through the absurdity of the situation depicted by the poet, and the final lines leave that reader with a great deal to think about. The key to both these poems is the shock created by breaking conventional expectations, and doing so in a way that combines shock with the ludic. There has been a vast amount written about poetry and about the difficulties of translating poetry, but not a great deal about poetry and humour. What there is tends to focus on satire and irony, rather than on playfulness, unless the poet in question is writing for children. Indeed, playfulness in poetry tends to be associated with writing for children where the use of rhyme is often combined with the unexpected. Shel Silverstein’s four-line poem ‘The Slithagadee’ is just such an example: in the final line of the poem the I-speaker is cut off mid-sentence as he boasts that the creature will never catch him: ‘You may catch all the others but you wo….’ The break in the word signifies that the boasting has all been in vain: the speaker is the creature’s latest victim.\n\nThe Tale and the Tail The late Anthea Bell, who translated the Asterix books, where linguistic playfulness is essential, once told me that she was trained in lexical games by her father, Adrian Bell, the compiler of the first Times crossword. Play is crucial to crossword solving, and wordplay is a strong element in the Asterix books, which reach a reading public that spans generations. Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland similarly reaches a vast global public, and the Index Translationum lists Carroll’s work as the 13th most translated text of all time. Carroll’s writing is full of jokes, puns, word games, and parodies, and one of the best-known is ‘The Mouse’s Tale’ which is set out in the shape of a mouse’s tail, a play on the words ‘tale and tail.’ Carroll writes that while the mouse was speaking, Alice’s ‘idea of the tale was something like this,’ and there follows the visual image with a story being told about a nonsensical trial. As the tail twists down the page the letters become gradually smaller until at\n\nConcrete Poetry, Playfulness & Translation 11 the very tip of the tail the poem consists of just single words. This visual representation of a tale being told as a tail can be described as an early example of a concrete poem. One of the most generally accepted definitions of concrete poetry is that the visual element of the poem is a vital structural feature. The current Wikipedia entry on concrete poetry declares it to be ‘an arrangement of linguistic elements in which the typographical effect is more important in conveying meaning than the verbal significance.’ This facile definition can most certainly be challenged: although the visual element may be given greater prominence than in other more traditional poetic forms, the typographical is not ‘more important’ in conveying meaning, it is one element in the construction of meaning, which will also depend on the agency of the reader. Benjamin Lee Whorf suggested that ‘the forms of a person’s thoughts are controlled by inexorable laws of pattern,’ by which he meant the ‘unperceived intricate systematizations of [one’s] own language,’2 and in poetry, as Charles Davy (1965) points out, patterns become more complex as they are articulated, involving sounds of words and their symbolic meanings. With concrete poetry there may be visual patterns, verbal patterns and sound patterns, and these can interact in ways that become realisable during the reading process. There is also a strong element of playfulness, and here the role of the reader is crucial.\n\nChallenging Expectations: Filippo Marinetti The shock effect of poetry by Apollinaire or Marinetti, for example, depended on challenging expectations and engaging readers in different ways. In his Futurist Manifesto, Marinetti declared that his new poetry would sing of danger, excitement, revolt against what he claimed was an antiquated museum culture. This was the age of the machine, he proclaimed, the age of the beauty of speed, the age of the ‘great-breasted locomotives,’3 of aeroplanes tearing across the skies, where the new sounds will be the roar of engines and the chatter of machine-gun fire. War, declared Marinetti, should be glorified as the only cure for a stagnant world. In his poetry for this new vision of the world, Marinetti experimented with sounds, and he also experimented with typefaces, using different colours and different fonts, sometimes including letters cut out from newspapers or his own sketches. One of his best-known poems, Après la Marne, Joffre Visite le Front en Auto (‘After the Marne, Joffre visits the front by car’) (1915), uses a whole range of such techniques to create a poem that is as much a visual artefact as it is a piece of writing. The inspiration for the poem was the visit of General Joffre after the Battle of the Marne when his French troops held back the German forces. A sentence in French in the lower centre of the poem says that this is ‘Verbalisation dynamique de la route’ (Dynamic verbalisation of the route). In the top left is the word ‘FRANCE,’ in the bottom left ‘PRUSSIENS.’ Marjorie Perloff sees this poem as ‘maybe the first instance of visual\n\n12 Susan Bassnett notation in poetry,’ combining letters, words, numbers, crosses (which might indicate graves or plus signs) and serpentines to convey that dynamic verbalisation. She adds: He also uses typography as an expressive marking, so that changes in letter size indicate an increase or decrease in volume, onomatopoeic repetitions of letters and words dramatise wartime sounds and heavily or lightly inked letters indicate verbal emphasis.4 Scattered across the page are words representing sounds which suggest the battlefield – a ‘toumb a toumb; tatatatata; traac craaac; tap tap tap’ – while the phrases ‘Mon ami’ and ‘Ma petite’ are drawn out as ‘Mon Amiiiii’ and ‘MaAa AAapetite,’ possibly reproducing the way in which General Joffre’s words floated across in the wind.5 Perloff also points out that there is a performative element in much of Marinetti’s writing, and there is a short piece on YouTube of Luciano Chessa (17 Feb. 2015) performing another of Marinetti’s war poems about conditions on the Alpine battlefields, ‘Carso=A Rat’s Nest: A Night in a Sinkhole + Mice in Love’ (c.1917). Here too the sounds of war (‘tuum tuum’) and the ‘popopopop’ of a motorcycle are combined with drawings of rats and cockroaches, a sketch of the captain smoking a long pipe on the left side, drawings of the mess hut and the latrine and even a rat on a high wire labelled ‘topo equilibrista’ (balancing rat). Marinetti’s concrete war poem combines sound and image, and sentences in French or Italian with nonsense, jokes and occasional obscenities in such a way as to create an impression of the chaos in which he was living. Hearing this poem read aloud gives added insight into what Marinetti was trying to do through a combination of words, sounds and images.\n\nIs Concrete Poetry Trans-national? In an essay on concrete poetry and translation, Kirsten Malmkjaer (1987) refers to the German T. Kopfermann, who suggests that concrete poetry can be seen as international, given that the language elements are not necessarily tied to the author’s mother tongue. This is certainly the case with Marinetti, and also with Apollinaire, a man of Polish descent, born in Italy, who grew up speaking Italian, Polish and French and who was able to switch languages with ease. Kopfermann suggests that the ‘concrete’ in concrete poetry consists in the linguistic items used, and these are purportedly used in such a way to eliminate from them any ­semantics – they are language as material, purely and simply. This leads on to his assumption that, at least between Indo-European languages, it is not necessary to translate concrete poetry, something that Malmkjaer challenges. Questioning Kopfermann’s notion of internationalism, Malmkjaer notes that most anthologies of concrete poetry do include at the very least glossaries\n\nConcrete Poetry, Playfulness & Translation 13 and in the case of the two Marinetti poems cited above both contain linguistic elements that require some form of translation if the reading experience of target language readers is to be enhanced. She concludes that concrete poetry is ‘neither more nor less translatable than any other type of poetry,’6 pointing out that any translation will reflect the set of priorities established by the translator. However, ‘The Mouse’s Tale/Tail’ not only depends on word play, but also relies on Western typography for it to be effective. Translating it into a character-­based language, for example, would present problems. Similarly, translation into a non-Western alphabet would present problems with the famous ‘apple’ poem by Reinhard Doehl (1965). This text consists of multiple repetitions of the German word ‘Apfel’ (apple) set out in the shape of an apple. In creating the shape, parts of the word have to be cut around the edges, leaving 55 full spellings of the word ‘Apfel.’ A reader’s first reaction to this poem is to see the word repeated within a shape of the actual object and to admire the playfulness of creating a piece about an apple from its lexical definition. So dominant is the word ‘Apfel’ that a reader has to look very closely to see the elusive intruder, the word ‘Wurm’ (worm) inserted in the lower right-hand side of the apple image. I have often been surprised by how long it takes some students to find that ‘Wurm’ when given the text in class. The question is, however, whether this poem would work in a non-related language. The ­German ‘Apfel’ and ‘Wurm’ map perfectly onto English ‘apple’ and ‘worm,’ with the pattern of a two-syllable word and a monosyllable intruder, but if we think of a Spanish translation we would have polysyllabic words ‘manzana’ and ‘gusano,’ and in Welsh we would have ‘afal’ but with a much more obvious worm, ‘mwydyn.’\n\nStrategies for Translating Poetry In 1929 an essay by Ezra Pound entitled ‘How to Read’ first appeared in the New York Herald Tribune. In this essay, Pound sets out his theory of poetic translation. He urges us to ‘chuck out the classifications which apply to the outer shape of the work,’7 that is, the identifiable formal aspects, and to look at what is actually going on in a poem. He then goes on to identify what he calls ‘three kinds of poetry’ – I would prefer to term these as three ‘aspects’ of poetry. The first is melopoeia, which refers to the musical properties of words and which adds a dimension ‘over and above their plain meaning.’ This can be appreciated by a foreign reader ‘with a sensitive ear’ but is practically impossible to translate, ‘save perhaps by divine accident or for half a line at a time.’8 His second aspect is phanopoeia, ‘the casting of images upon the visual imagination.’9 This, he claims, can be translated ‘almost, or wholly intact,’10 adding that it is almost impossible for a translator to destroy, unless the translator is incompetent or ignorant.\n\n14 Susan Bassnett But the third aspect, logopoeia ‘does not translate.’ For this is the use of words beyond their direct meaning, and which ‘holds the aesthetic content of which is peculiarly the domain of verbal manifestation.’11 Under this we might include word play, double meanings, puns, culturally specific words, and allusions which can only be translated, as Pound puts it, when a translator, having ‘determined the original author’s state of mind,’ may or may not be able to find ‘a derivative or an equivalent.’12 Pound was a founder of the Imagist movement, so it is perhaps unsurprising that he should appear to be arguing that the casting of images on the visual imagination is the easiest aspect of poetry to translate. The translation of multidimensional words used by a poet in specific ways beyond what he calls their direct meaning is pretty well impossible, as is the reproduction of meaningful musical properties that are language-­ specific, though Marinetti’s phonetic sounds of war and machines appear to be transcultural. Pound, of course, was not taking concrete poetry into account when he endeavoured to articulate his theory, but his advice to translators to ‘chuck out the classifications’ and look at what is going on in a poem would surely be applicable to any form of poetry. One of the founding fathers of Translation Studies, the poet and translator James Holmes also endeavoured to set out his ideas about poetry and translation. In ‘Forms of Verse Translation and the Translation of Verse Form’ (1988) Holmes defined four translation strategies: what he called mimetic form, that is, retaining the form of the original; analogical translation, that is finding a form in the target language that would have a similar function to that of the source language (e.g. the alexandrine instead of iambic pentameter); content-derivative translation where the translator takes the semantic material as a starting point; ‘deviant or extraneous form’ where a completely new form is used by the translator, perhaps because the source language form does not exist or as a deliberate attempt at innovation.13 What Holmes, like Pound, was trying to do was to urge translators to look at both the form and content of a poem and to establish a set of priorities, recognising that no poem can ever be translated in such a way as to be identical to the original, since transformation is an inevitable part of all translation. What both Pound and Holmes were saying is that the translation of any poem involves several stages: the translator first has to read the poem, then to decide on which elements to try and foreground and then to restructure the poem in such a way as to reach a new readership in another time and place. Both acknowledge that the final product is going to be very different from the starting point. The task of any translator of any poem is to decode and then re-encode that poem in another language, which always involves reconfiguration.\n\nAlphabet Poetry and Literation In 1978 Peter Mayer edited a collection of poems that includes ancient texts, sacred texts, poems by Pope, Coleridge and Burns, and work by\n\nConcrete Poetry, Playfulness & Translation 15 concrete poets such as Kurt Schwitters, Bob Cobbing and Henri Chopin. The volume is entitled Alphabetical and Letter Poems. A Chrestomathy. Edwin Morgan, the great Scottish poet and translator, wrote the Foreword, explaining the significance of an anthology of poetry about alphabets, which opens with this extraordinary sentence: Alphabets, like musical scales, or fingers and toes, or stars and constellations, or stone circles, or abacuses, or sea waves, or comets and eclipses, or genealogies, or bird and fish migrations, owe their interest and appeal to a combination of regularity and chance.14 Regularity and chance: here Morgan is making an important point. The playfulness of the unexpected in poetry comes precisely from that ­combination – the expectation of regularity and the sudden chance interruption of that expectation. Morgan draws attention to the long tradition of alphabet poems in languages around the world, then turns to highlight the different weight which different cultures give to certain letters of the alphabet: ‘in a Hungarian dictionary the letter K is as fat in entries as in English it is thin’ (Morgan, 1978, p. 8), noting that each language carries its own feelings about certain letters, a point which anyone who does crossword puzzles in more than one language can see straight away. As a translator from several languages, Morgan knew only too well how different languages are from one another and the extent to which linguistic diversity is linked to cultural difference. He also makes two other important points: he draws attention to the way in which so many of the alphabet poems play games with the reader, noting that the very idea of playfulness is multi-layered and resists definition: Play effects readily arise when attention is drawn to rearrangeable components, especially if sound and sight are both involved. Qualities will appear, too, which may be hard to describe merely in terms of ‘comedy’ or ‘seriousness’, perhaps reminding us of the ambiguous nature of speech and language-instruments equally of communication and secrecy.15 He also draws attention to the lineage of concrete poetry, pointing out that ‘new men of letters from Schwitters and the futurists to Cobbing and the concretists have emerged to remind us of the literation basis of language and language culture.’16 Morgan himself experimented with that literation basis, creating such well-known sound poems as ‘The Loch Ness Monster’s Song,’ ‘The Computer’s First Christmas Card,’ ‘Nine one-word poems’ and the ‘Siesta of a Hungarian Snake,’ which consists of the letters ‘s’ and ‘z’ arranged in a sequence: s sz sz SZ sz SZ sz Zs Zs zs zs zs z.\n\n16 Susan Bassnett Here there is a play on the words ‘Hungarian’ and ‘hungry,’ also a play on the frequency of the ‘sz’ combination in the Hungarian language, together with the use of the sibilant ‘s’ to suggest a snake’s hiss and ‘z’ to suggest sleeping. The use of capital letters can be taken to hint at the snake digesting something large before falling asleep.\n\nBob Cobbing One sequence of poems included in Mayer’s anthology is Bob Cobbing’s ‘ABC in Sound,’ a tour de force consisting of 26 sections, one for each letter of the English alphabet. Some sections are made up of different recognisable languages (English, French, German, Latin, Japanese), others are made up of sound clusters, while others such as the ‘O’ section consist solely of letters. The section for ‘M’ consists of a list of Scottish surnames starting with McAllister, ending with McTaggart, while the ‘S’ section is laid out on the page as a gradually expanding image, with the first line consisting of just one word ‘Sign’ and the last line being ‘Systematicwholeofspeechsounds.’ The ‘Q’ section plays with the sound of the letter: Q Kew Queue Cue Q Coo! Listening to a recording of Cobbing’s work, made in 2014 by the Argentinian performers, Gastón Mazières and Martin Virgili, who comprise the Ensamble Orquesta Negra, what I found interesting were the sections omitted, which include ‘Q.’ This is perhaps not surprising, since although most of the poem can be read transnationally, the Q section is very definitely aimed at English readers. ‘Kew’ refers to Kew Gardens in London, a ‘queue’ is a line of waiting people, a ‘cue’ is used in billiards and ‘Coo,’ here with an exclamation mark refers not only to the sound made by a pigeon but to a now outdated English slang expression of surprise. If we return to the questions posed by Kirsten Malmkjaer about translation and concrete poetry, what we appear to have in Cobbing’s ‘ABC of Sound’ are some sections that transcend linguistic frontiers and some which appear to be firmly located in one cultural and linguistic context. What this means is that some sections, such as ‘Q,’ might require glosses for a non-English reader though others, as demonstrated by the Argentinian performance, would not.\n\nConcrete Poetry, Playfulness & Translation 17\n\nCreating a Concrete Poem through Translation The joking effect of Reinhard Doehls’ poem depends on the presence of the ‘Wurm,’ but there is another worm in a poem by the Brazilian poet Augusto de Campos, his translation of William Blake’s ‘The Sick Rose’ (1794). This tiny but deeply disturbing poem consists of two short, four-line verses: Oh rose, thou are sick! The invisible worm That flies in the night In the howling storm, Has found out thy bed Of crimson joy, And his dark secret love Does thy life destroy. Critics have extensively debated the meaning of the poem, but one underlying message is clear: the worm, whatever it is, is killing the rose, and the final word ‘destroy’ is unequivocal. De Campos translated the poem into Portuguese in 1978 creating what he called an iconographic version, that is, turning Blake’s rhyming stanzas into a concrete poem, through a visual representation. De Campos’ version consists of a circle of words that spiral inwards from the opening ‘O’ Rosa, estas doente! Um verme pela treva Voa invisivelmente…’ until the words almost vanish in the tiny centre of the image (see also Homem de Mello, this volume). Commenting on the translation, Else Ribeiro Pires Vieira points out that Augusto de Campos, as a translator, transforms the text, breaking with the untouchability of the original – his translation does not represent, but re-presents the original. Still, further, de Campos does not silence Blake’s voice, he does not translate Blake into Portuguese only, but also into Portuguese literature, into his own concrete poetry.17 Vieira’s argument is that de Campos has created a new poem in a new context, one that is not so much a translation as a new piece of Brazilian literature created in the spirit of the anthropophagic function of discourse which both the de Campos Brothers, Haroldo and Augusto, were promoting (e.g. Haroldo de Campos and María Tai Wolff, 1968). She refers to Haroldo’s coining of the term ‘transtextualization’ (cf. the chapters by Clüver, Jackson and Huang in the present volume) whereby a translation becomes an autonomous creation, albeit retaining its debt to an original, and argues that what Augusto de Campos does in this translation is to ‘herald a new axiomatics of translation in that there is a shift-away from sacred textuality towards textualised otherness.’18 She also recounts how 14 years after the publication of that translation, on the occasion of Blake’s 227th birthday, two Brazilian artists built a\n\n18 Susan Bassnett spiral model of the Portuguese concrete version of the ‘sick rose’ poem out of plastic tubes of human size that people could walk through – ‘a translation resituated to be seen, felt, and lived.’19\n\nThe Road North – A New Kind of Poetry? On 16th May, 2010, two Scottish poets, Ken Cockburn and Alec Finlay, set off from Edinburgh on a journey through Scotland that they would later publish as a blog, a collaborative audio and visual word-map. They chose that date because their guide on that journey was the 17th-century Japanese poet, Matsuo Basho, author of Narrow Road to the Deep North, who set off on his own journey round Edo, Japan, on that same day in 1689. Cockburn and Finlay created an interactive map of Scotland which readers can access by clicking on the highlighted sites which they call ‘stations.’ For each station there is a kind of diary, with photographs, maps, texts in English and occasionally in Gaelic, various sounds – wind, sea, animals – and poems, some concrete, some in more familiar forms. Some poems are written in sand, some are shaped like circles or wave-like bands, and throughout there are references back to Basho’s journey, so the Scottish poets’ journey is interwoven with that of the Japanese poet. In an essay in The Author (2014), Cockburn explains the rationale for the project and how they carried it out. They planned originally to publish poems at each station via QR codes that could be read by mobile phones, whereby scanning a code would mean that a poem about a landscape could be heard in situ, but they gave up on that idea and opted instead for labels: We wrote our verses on parcel tags from the post office, pinned on fenceposts or tied to trees along the way, and photographed with our mobiles…For us, ‘the thing with the labels’, which eventually we came to call simply ‘poeming’, became our practice-what we did when we stopped somewhere we felt a connection to. 20 The Road North exists in various forms – it can be accessed via the internet, with or without sound, there is a print version of some of the poems, in short, there is a range of alternatives offered to the reader who can choose which way to access the material. This kind of text resists categorisation, though I suspect that, had Marinetti had the option of using electronic media, he too would have used the internet as a means of reaching an audience.\n\nConclusions Can we apply the same strategies for translation which Pound and Holmes suggest are applicable to poetry in general, or does concrete poetry resist translation? This is the question that underpins this essay.\n\nConcrete Poetry, Playfulness & Translation 19 Malmkjaer is of the view that translating concrete poetry involves the same choices as translating any other poem, and she rejects the idea that concrete poetry is somehow more ‘international’ than other forms of poetry. I find myself in agreement with her. If a concrete poem relies on sound effects, then Pound’s admonition about the problems posed by melopoeia is applicable, though where such sound effects are transnational as in Marinetti’s ‘Carso’ poem there is no need for translation. In some concrete poems, it is the sound effects that dominate, in others the visual element may be most significant, in some there may be a mixing of different languages, in others there may be an interweaving of the visual and the sounds – but whatever the techniques used, the objective is to startle the reader and to invite that reader to think beyond more traditional boundaries and categories. The playful dimension is also crucial, and here the whole vast area of culture-bound humour also needs to be taken into consideration. What might be more applicable to the translation of concrete poetry therefore is a more functionalist approach, asking what the original is doing and then seeking an equivalent effect. In the case of ‘The Slithagadee’ the whole point of the poem is that the I-speaker is eaten by an imaginary monster before he can complete his sentence and that is the effect that a translator would have to think about recreating. In the case of Augusto de Campos’ translation of William Blake, here we have a deliberate attempt to deconstruct a ‘classic’ English poem and to reinsert it into a different literary system in a completely new way. De Campos’ translation can be seen as an example of what Octavio Paz defines as the proper task of the translator – freeing the verbal signs of a poem into circulation, then returning them to language. Pound adds: The idea of poetic translation, as Valery once superbly defined it, consists of producing analogous effects with different implements.21 In the case of concrete poetry, reproducing analogous effects may well involve very different implements than those chosen by the original writer, but that, surely, is the challenge of the game.\n\nNotes 1 Kavanagh, 1972, p. 233. 2 Whorf, 1956, p. 252. 3 Marinetti, 1909, np. 4 Perloff, 2009, pp. 107–108. 5 ‘Animated visual poem by Italian Futurist poet F.

Among the poets who appeared in this period is a group whose critical reception has always been mixed, but whose work has nevertheless always been read: the Alexandrian poets. They were the first in the Western world to experiment with the possibilities of poetic composition, deploying graphic and aural resources in a new and very different way from that of the heroic era, and their surviving oeuvre consists in all sorts of poetic games, such as anagrams, acrostics and palindromes. Characterised by virtuosity and erudition, these poets combined the rare, the obscure, the eccentric, the enigmatic and the whimsical, which relates their work directly to the formally ‘difficult’ poetry described by Ezra Pound in his anthology, Confucius to Cummings (1964). The present chapter argues that the origins of Western poetry in the ‘untranslatable,’ ‘ideogrammic,’ ‘concrete’ tradition lie in the Alexandrian poets’ collection of technopaegnia, or ‘games of skill,’ the first extant examples of visual poetry in the West. This collection of six poems is attributed to four different poets who flourished in the 2nd and 3rd centuries bce: Πέλεκυς (‘Axe’), Πτέρυγες Ερώτος (‘Wings of Eros’) and Ωιόν (‘Egg’) are attributed to Simmias of Rhodes, considered the inventor of the genre; Συρίγξ (‘Syrinx’ or ‘Pan Pipes’) is attributed to Theocritus; and two poems on the same theme, βωμός (‘Altar’), known as ‘Doric’ and ‘Ionian,’ are attributed, respectively, to Dosiadas, and to Julius Vestinus (or, according to some, to Besantinus). These are all, up to a point, what we might call ‘pattern poems’ or, with Apollinaire, ‘calligrams,’ that is, poems whose outlines, produced by the arrangement of the lines, visually reproduce their subject. In short, Πέλεκυς is in the shape of an axe, and the βωμός poems are in the shape of an altar. Therefore, the technopaegnia have frequently found their way into anthologies of visual poetry, although some, like Apollinaire and the later concrete poets, either deny their status as precedents or ignore them completely. The purpose of this chapter, then, is, by considering one\n\n22 Juliana Di Fiori Pondian example in detail, to reappraise these poems and to identify in them traces of characteristics that allow us, in some respects, to acknowledge them as a framework for a genre of poetry that (i) exploits all the sonorous and graphic potential of verbal matter, testing its limits, and (ii) doggedly pursues the ‘synthetic-ideological’ rather than ‘analytic-­ discursive’ construction of poetic matter, long before Apollinaire’s formulation.1 In this genre, language itself is taken to be the matter of the poem, not only because its physical traces are re-signified to compose a pictorial icon, but because games are forever being played with language itself, via homonyms, synonyms and homophones, in sophisticated verbal constructs in which the word is objectified and made concrete. In this respect the Alexandrian collection can be compared to the work of Lycophron of Chalcis; the first Brazilian translator of the Alexandrian’s work, Trajano, has pointed to its Baroque elements, noted Mallarmé’s interest in it and argued for it to be rightfully regarded as a precursor to Joyce’s Finnegans Wake. 2 The lineage from Joyce to the Baroque poets, to which Trajano refers, is a familiar narrative in the poetics of Brazilian concretismo. The poems of the technopaegnia add to the tortuous word-games and obscurities of Lycophron’s style a visual element, which prefigures the calligrams of Apollinaire and the ideogrammic method proposed, later, by Pound and Fenollosa. If Pound posed the question, ‘How does Chinese define ‘red’ without using ‘red’?’ and answers it with pictographs of rose, rust, cherry and flamingo, then, as we shall see, much earlier, ‘Syrinx’ posed the question, ‘How does one refer to something without ever mentioning it?’ Thus, in certain respects, the technopaegnia can be considered antecedents of early and later modernist traditions. For the reader – and the translator – their word-games invite a series of clues and obstacles that reside in the way in which they approach lexical semantics and reference. The poems combine the following elements: (i) pre-calligramic visuality; (ii) sonority, highlighting innovations in the rigid metrical system of Greek verse; and (iii) a synthetic-ideographic mode of composition that relies on enigmas and riddles, in which each proposition embodies a hidden narrative, encrypted in a single word or expression that is often a compound neologism. The name ‘Syrinx’ itself has two referents: the chaste nymph who was pursued by the goatish Pan, and the set of pipes that he played. It is no wonder that Ernst Robert Curtius described these poems as ‘torture for the translators!’3 By adapting the Poundian method of criticism through comparison and translation, this chapter presents a detailed analysis of one of the poems of the technopaegnia, ‘Syrinx’ or the ‘Pan Pipes,’ which is attributed to Theocritus, and which is considered a masterpiece of the genre. Through a detailed comparison of the original with a selection of its translations, we aim to make a case for ‘Syrinx’ as a continuing point of reference for experimental poetics.\n\nThe Origins of the Untranslatable 23\n\n‘Syrinx’ ‘Syrinx’ (Figure 2.1) has been called ‘the most obscure poem in Greek literature’4 as well as being described as an uglier monster than Polyphemus and, most damning perhaps, a tedious piece of work. However, it is possible to read ‘Syrinx’ as a virtuoso composition, erudite and sometimes lyrical, demonstrating a mastery of varied poetic techniques on several levels. In its theme and its compositional structure\n\nFigure 2.1 Detail of ‘Syrinx’ Supplément grec 0384, 028–29v*, by courtesy of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. 5\n\n24 Juliana Di Fiori Pondian it bears an immediate resemblance to religious verse such as Homer’s Hymn No.19: with each verse, the poet depicts a character, in this case, the divine goatherd, Pan. Pan’s genealogy, his physical characteristics and some of his stories, especially his involvements with nymphs, are described or alluded to. However, ‘Syrinx’ differs from Greek hymns proper in that the object of veneration is not named once. There are only clues and puzzles that, once solved, are associated with this divine character. A major clue, obviously, is the visual presentation of the poem, which is in the form of ‘Pan pipes,’ the triangular flute that has become synonymous with the god. The poem is organised into ten couplets, each couplet regularly decreasing in length, foot by foot, from hexameter to dipole. Each couplet, or pair of couplets, deals riddlingly with someone or something associated with Pan. As well as being organised into couplets the poem falls into two parts: the first half (lines 1–10) dealing with the myths surrounding Pan’s genealogy, and the second half (lines 11–20) consisting of dedications. The puzzles presented to the reader vary in type, from allusions to particularly obscure mythical episodes, to punning ideas based on homonymy, homophony and synonymy. Thus, a multitude of references to Pan are constituted playfully through unlikely cultural and traditional allusions, or linguistic games. The vocabulary of the poem displays the poet’s erudition in its use of neologisms, archaisms, rare words, and unusual compounds and blends. While the poem is commonly attributed to Theocritus, the authorship has been contested. Relatively little is known about Theocritus: he was born in Syracuse and lived in the first half of the 3rd century bce, during a time in which Alexandrian poetry flourished. He is credited with incorporating new themes into Greek poetry, taking as his main subject the countryside and the man in the field. Some of the varied pieces of his work that are preserved show a taste for epigrams and couplets. His interests and style therefore seem consistent with the ‘Syrinx,’ although this is the only pattern poem attributed to him. The Greek original is here compared to four modern vernacular translations: (i) Anthony Holden (English, 1974), (ii) José Paulo Paes (Portuguese, 1995), (iii) Armando Zárate (Spanish, 1978) and (iv) Félix Buffière (French, 1970). The original poem is discussed alongside its translations, with a detailed focus on four couplets that illustrate the challenges presented to the translators.\n\nTranslations of ‘Syrinx’ The four translations were selected for their apparent desire to engage with the original in a poetic manner. Three were composed in the 1970s and one, by Paes, in 1995. While Paes is the first to translate ‘Syrinx’ into Portuguese, there are earlier translations into English (Edmonds, 1912; Paton, 1918) and French (Legrand, 1925) as well as\n\nThe Origins of the Untranslatable 25 into other languages. Even so, there are few translators who have had the tenacity to persevere with the challenge that this text offers. Of the four translators considered here, Félix Buffière is the only Hellenist by training, an expert in Homer and a professor of Greek at the University of Toulouse, France. He has translated a number of classical works. Anthony Holden is an English writer, biographer, editor and critic. Among the classical works which he has translated – besides ‘Syrinx’ – is Greek pastoral verse and Aeschylus’ Agamemnon. Armando Zárate, the first translator of ‘Syrinx’ into Spanish, is not primarily a Hellenist but a poet and essayist, a scholar of visual poetry and professor at the University of Vermont (USA). He translated the Greek visual poems in an article, ‘The visual texts of the Alexandrian period’ (1978). Finally, José Paulo Paes was a highly regarded poet, editor, researcher and multilingual translator in Brazil, who translated a selection of Greek literary texts, among them two of the six technopaegnia. In all the cases selected, the translations are accompanied by an essay or explanatory notes that expound on the complex meanings of the original, verse by verse. This chapter, then, presents an overview of the translation strategies used by modern writers to approach an ‘untranslatable’ poem.\n\nThe Riddles of ‘Syrinx’ We begin with the title of the poem or, rather, its absence. While the poem has no title in Greek and its authorship is uncertain, the translations all assign it to Theocritus and name it ‘Syrinx,’ with only Zárate domesticating the Greek proper name to its Spanish form, ‘La Siringa.’ As noted, the name can refer either to the nymph pursued by Pan or to his trademark pipes. The opening couplet and its translations are given below: Οὐδενός εὐνάτειρα, Μακροπτολέμοιο δὲ μάτερ, μαίας ἀντιπέτροιο θοὸν τέκεν ἰθυντῆρα, The bedmate of Nobody, mother of The Warmonger, bore the nimble pilot of The Stone-swapped’s nurse; A concubina de ninguém, a mãe do Luta-de-Longe deu à luz o pastor ágil da que foi ama-de-leite do Trocado-por-Pedra, Templa tu sonido, oh mujer de Ninguno, madre de la Largaguerra, que pariste al rápido protector de la nodriza de Antipatro, La propre épouse de Personne et la mère d´Au-loin-combat de la nourrice de Pourpierre enfanta l´agile gardien\n\n26 Juliana Di Fiori Pondian The opening couplet invites the reader to solve the kind of riddling periphrases that will characterise the poem. The ‘bedmate of Nobody’ (οὐδενός εὐνάτειρα) is Ulysses’ wife, Penelope. Ulysses named himself ‘Nobody’ (οὒτις) in the Cyclops episode of the Odyssey (IX, 278). Their son, Telemachus (τῆλε + μᾶκος) literally means ‘distant battle,’ and is translated as various compounds, ‘The Warmonger,’ ‘Luta-de longe,’ ‘Largaguerra’ and ‘Au-loin-de-combat.’ Synonyms of the components of Telemachus’ name are then compounded to rechristen him as ‘Macroptolemy,’ μάκρος (= τῆλε) and πτόλεμος (= μᾶκος). The second line expects the reader to work out the identity of ἀντιπέτροι (‘he who was exchanged for a stone’), which, in translation, is ‘The Stone-swapped,’ ‘­Trocado-por-pedra,’ ‘Antipatro’ and ‘Pourpierre.’ This lexical compound refers to an episode, recounted in Hesiod’s Theogony, in which the infant Zeus is replaced by a stone, when his father, Chronos, seeks to devour him. Also associated with Zeus is the μαία, here translated as ‘nurse’ ‘ama-de-leite,’ ‘nodriza,’ ‘nourrice,’ which refers to Amalthea, the goat who gives milk to Zeus as a child (cf The Odyssey, IX, 116–117, 210). The fact that Theocritus’ readers might have identified μαία, ‘Maia,’ as the mother of Hermes, might represent a deliberate red herring.6 Amalthea’s swift-footed goatherd, translated more or less opaquely, as her ‘nimble pilot,’ ‘pastor agil,’ ‘rápido protector’ and ‘agile gardien,’ is, of course, the god Pan. By the tortuous process of allusive association, then, Pan is the guide (that is, the goatherd) of the milk-nurse (the goat, Amalthea) of the Swappedfor-a-stone (Zeus) to whom Penelope, the wife of Nobody (Ulysses) and mother of Struggle-Far (Telemachus), gave birth. Despite her reputation for chastity in Ulysses’ absence, there is an alternative version of her narrative, recorded by Duris of Samos (c. 350 bce – after 281 bce), in which Penelope sleeps with all 108 of her suitors and gives birth to the goat-god as a result. From the outset, then, the poem presents considerable challenges to the translator. The main obstacle is the compounding and reformulating of names that allude to mythological and epic characters. Another is the rare and archaic quality of the Greek vocabulary. These words are likely also to have appeared to be unusual to the original readers: •\n\n• • •\n\nεὐνάτειρα, according to Kwapisz is ‘rare and poetic’7 and extant in the work of three tragedians. The translators opt for normalising strategies in their choice of more widely used terms: ‘bedmate,’ ‘concubina,’ ‘mujer’ and ‘épouse.’ μαίας, ‘an old epic word for ‘nurse, mother,’’8 becomes the more mundane ‘nurse,’ ‘ama-de-leite,’ ‘nodriza’ and ‘nourrice.’ θοὸν, ‘a poetic word’9 is also expressed in the target languages by the more prosaic ‘nimble,’ ‘ágil,’ ‘rápido’ and ‘agile.’ ἰθυντῆρα, ‘found twice in Hellenistic poetry and never before,’10 is translated as ‘pilot,’ ‘pastor,’ ‘protector’ and ‘gardien.’ The translators do not attempt to reproduce the rarity of the Greek word. The\n\nThe Origins of the Untranslatable 27 Portuguese ‘pastor’ even gives a clue to the occupation of the divine goatherd that the more generic term in Greek withholds. A characteristic of the sound-patterning of the Greek poem, apart from its regular metre, is its alliteration. Kwapisz suggests that the sound-­patterning in the Greek poem, which is characteristic of other works by Theocritus, is here mimetic in that it evokes the music of the Pan pipes.11 Dupont-Roc and Lallot also suggest that the poem calls to mind ‘le son de la syrinx, souffle de Pan renvoyé par Echo’ (‘the sound of the Pan pipes, Pan’s exhalation returned by Echo’).12 However, apart from some isolated alliteration between certain phrases (e.g. ‘Luta-de-Longe … luz’; ‘propre épouse de Personne’) none of the translators attempts to recreate the metrical, rhythmical or alliterative patterning of the original, choosing instead to reconstitute the semantic content and preserve the triangular shape of the poem. There is another feature of the sound-patterning that the translators do not attempt to reproduce, namely the fact that every couplet in the first half of the poem (lines 1–10) begins with the vowel , i.e. οὐ (lines 1, 3 and 5) and ὅς (lines 7 and 9). The repetition is not at all random if we think of these ‘o’s’ as a visual representation of mouthpieces, and so the succeeding couplets can be taken to represent the pipes of the flute. The combination of baroque textual content, complex sound-patterning and striking visual shape makes ‘Syrinx’ clearly a pioneer of ‘verbivocovisual’ aesthetics. And so the poem continues, with each couplet reduced in length by a foot, until the ‘turn’ half-way through the poem. Lines 3–6 offer the reader a further series of riddles that have Pan as the solution. Presumably if the reader has not solved the riddle in the first couplet, he or she may treat these couplets as supplementary clues. More likely, if the shape of the poem and the riddling first couplet have suggested a solution to the reader, he or she may enjoy the playful ingenuity of the successive allusions. To give a further illustration, the final couplet before the ‘turn’ (lines 9–10) is as follows. ὅς σβέσεν ἀνορέαν ἰσαυδέα παπποφόνου Τυρίας τ’ ἐ conquered parricide-like armies, drove them out of Tyre’s girl, o que soube dar fim à homônima arrogância do mata-avô, dela salvando a jovem tíria; que empleó la soberbia, tan luego el nombre del que mató al abuelo y lo expulsó de la Tiria, (…) Brisa d´orgueil d´un nom évoquant le meurtrier de son grand-père et éloigna de la Tyrienne.\n\n28 Juliana Di Fiori Pondian In this couplet, a new strategy is introduced to reveal further characteristics of Pan. The allusion here is to the historical wars between Athens and Persia, and the appearance of Pan that emerged as a portent of Athens’ victory. Rather than mention the Persians directly, another linguistic game is played: the hapax legomenon, Παπποφόνου, refers to ‘grandfather killer’ an allusion to Perseus, who, in numerous stories, was unintentionally responsible for his grandfather’s death.13 The suggested name of ‘Perseus’ (Περσεύς) evokes the homophone ‘Persians’ (Περσεύς) against whom the Greeks were fighting, with Pan’s support. The chain of allusions is tortuous. The sole function of the periphrasis (παπποφόνου, ‘grandfather-­murderer’) is to evoke a homophone (Περσεύς = ‘Perseus’ > ‘Persians’) that refers to an army rebuffed by the Athenians, with Pan’s help. This chain of allusions is maintained in the translations, given that all the target languages have similar forms for Perseus/Persians. Thus, three of the four translators opt for literal translations of ‘grandfather-­murderer’ (e.g. ‘mata-­avô) which, for a reader conversant with the mythology, might evoke Perseus/Persians. Holden chooses a different solution, with ‘parricide-­like’ perhaps having a faint aural echo of ‘Perseus/Persian-like’ but it is so faint as to be barely discernible, at least without an explanatory note. The significance of the main reference in the second line of the couplet must also be deduced by way of a linguistic game. ‘Tyre’ is another name for the mythological figure of Europa, who was born in the Phoenician city. Via ‘Tyre’ and ‘Europa’ (Εύρώπη), the reader is led to the European lands (that is, the Greek territory) from which the Persians were expelled, thanks to Pan. The riddling strategy is similar to that in the previous line: a character is alluded to indirectly, not for his or her relevance to the poem’s content, but because his or her name (which is unmentioned) is homonymous with another entity (an army, a territory) which is relevant. To nudge the reader in the direction of Tyre being a female (Europa) rather than the Phoenician city, the translators personalise the reference: ‘Tyre’s girl,’ ‘a jovem tíria’ (=‘the young Tyria’), ‘la Tiria/la Tyrienne’ (=‘the Tyrian maid’). Again, here, the translations give more of a clue to the riddle’s solution than does the original poet. The first half of the poem, then, is a series of puzzles that reconfigure how the reader approaches a text. To make sense of the riddling content, the reader has to identify characters referred to by periphrasis, transfer from the sense of one homophone to another and situate the references in his or her detailed knowledge of mythology and history. The translators have to find some means of taking their readers on a similar journey, a semantic quest through a labyrinth of riddles to which the answer is always Pan. At the very centre of the poem (line 11) there is a particularly enigmatic "
