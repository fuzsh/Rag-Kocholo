        "text": "If you’re interested in seeing a band that looks like an art school-drama project reject and sounds comparable to Nine Inch Nails stabbing or shooting their way through the Resident Evil mansion, then don’t miss Mudvayne at The Boardwalk at 8 p.m. this Sunday.\n\n“These guys are really cool because they aren’t just like a normal band,” said Ryan Miller, The Sony Music college representative for Sacramento State. “They are crazy, they actually have their own style, it’s a show you have to see live.”\n\nTo enter to win free tickets to the Mudvayne show and have the chance to get your face painted by the band in the 98.5 “98 Rock” tour bus, register to win in any Dimple Records store. Winners must be 18 or older, since admission to The Boardwalk is also for adults only. The winner will be announced Friday.\n\nMudvayne, a Peoria, Illinois band that consists of four members: vocalist Kud (Chad Gray), guitarist Gurrg (Greg Tribbett), bassist Ryknow (Ryan Martinie), and drummer sPaG (Matthew McDonough), has been compared to such bands as Tool, Korn, Fear Factory, Nine Inch Nails, and Slipknot.\n\n“The main lead singer of Slipknot supports these guys,” said Miller. “They are not together, but [the singer of Slipknot] saw the group and he took them under? so for everyone who is into Slipknot, Mudvayne is like the underground super-group.”\n\n“We don’t have a problem with the Slipknot comparison,” insists sPaG in an interview with Kerrang! Magazine. “But listen to the music and you’ll realize we’re very different.”\n\nAlthough the band is hardcore rock, the lyrics portray an attitude without anger or self-pity.\n\n“Too many hard rock bands convey one message: I’m pissed at my parents,” explained drummer sPaG. “Were trying to move beyond that.”\n\nIn addition to having their own original sound, Mudvayne’s image is in a class of it’s own.\n\n“We’ve been wearing make-up for two years, but people who’ve never seen us before aren’t going to know that,” sPaG told Kerrang! Magazine.\n\nTickets for Mudvayne are available for $12.50 at the door. Questions can be answered at (916) 988-9247.
