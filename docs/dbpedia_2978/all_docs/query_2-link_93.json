        "text": "Aleksey Antipov is a bright representative of Russian rap, although the roots of the young man go far to Ukraine. The young man is known under the creative pseudonym Tipsy Tip.\n\nThe performer has been singing for over 10 years. Music lovers know that Tipsy Tip touched on acute social, political and philosophical topics in his songs.\n\nThe rapper's musical compositions are not a banal set of words. And it is precisely for this that Tipsy is respected by the army of his “fans”. Today, the performer performs with his own team \"Shtora\".\n\nChildhood and youth of Alexei Antipov\n\nAlexey Antipov spent his childhood on the territory of Krivoy Rog. There are few facts about the singer's personal biography. It is known that his parents had nothing to do with creativity. Mom worked for a long time as a simple teacher, and her father worked as a miner.\n\nLike all children, Alex went to school. Even then, little Lesha had the nickname Type. The young man was not eager to study. He was much more interested in music and sports.\n\nHe repeatedly became the winner in youth competitions. In addition, Alexey was engaged in martial arts.\n\n“I grew up in the 90s and grew up in the 2000s. I never grabbed the stars from the sky, I achieved everything myself. I am an ordinary kid with my dreams, ”Alexey Antipov himself says this about himself.\n\nOnce, information appeared on the Internet that Alexei had been addicted to drug use for a long time. Antipov confirmed this information.\n\nThe young man noted that he took his head in time. In his musical compositions, he promoted young people to lead a healthy lifestyle and stop using alcohol and drugs.\n\nCreative way and music of Tipsy Tipa\n\nAlexei Antipov noticed from childhood that he had a beautiful voice. He often sang songs. Most of all, the young man liked hip-hop. As a student, Antipov composed the first musical compositions.\n\nIn early 2006, Antipov participated in rap battles, which took place on the site of the Nip-hop.ru resource. Alexey took a creative pseudonym Tip. Then the rapper competed with the famous Rem Digga. Tip reached the 6th round, but lost to Digga.\n\nLosing was not a reason to give up. Tipsy Tip won for \"Best Video\" for the 3rd round track \"Regular Accidents\". This was the beginning of Antipov's serious approach to rap culture.\n\nIn addition to participating in the battle, he participated in Rap Live. At the same time, the performer did not forget about his solo career. MC recorded his debut compositions at home on a primitive voice recorder.\n\nIn 2009, the rapper's debut album \"Nishtyachki\" was released on the RAP-A-NET Internet label. In the same 2009, Tipsy Tip presented his second studio album Shtorit.\n\nThe rapper released the first two records under the pseudonym \"Type\". Later it turned out that the pseudonym was already taken by a performer from St. Petersburg. And to the word \"Type\" I had to add another \"Tipsi\" (tipsi - drunk, English - drunk).\n\nIn 2010, Tipsy Tip expanded his discography with the third album \"Bytnabit\". After that, the audience of fans of the rapper from Krivoy Rog expanded significantly.\n\nCreativity for Antipov remained a hobby. A young man is forced to work as a manager in order to earn money for musical equipment. Antipov could not afford to completely dissolve in music.\n\nLarge-scale popularity and recognition came to Tipsy after the release of the musical composition \"Wide\". The presentation of the track fell on 2011.\n\nThe video has received over 1 million views on YouTube. Then the rapper performed in Moscow, where he presented the album \"Customs Gives Good\".\n\nMusic critics began to sort out Tipsy's work by bones. Some said that he describes the world and everything that happens too aggressively and gloomily, others, on the contrary, praised the rapper for masterfully describing an imperfect world.\n\nBut in some ways, critics agreed - Tipsy's songs are bright, expressive, logically complete and have philosophical overtones.\n\nA year later, Tipsy Tip made attempts to get out of solo work. Together with the famous performer Zambezi, he presented the mini-LP \"Song\".\n\nThen the singer became interested in the new Versus project. In 2014, the rapper decided to test his strength. His opponent in the \"duel\" turned out to be a powerful opponent, Harry Ax, who, by the way, won.\n\nIn 2015, Alexei Antipov became the founder of his own musical group Shtora. The musicians have been rehearsing for many years, but did not advertise that they dream of creating a group.\n\nThe musical group included the following \"persons\": Zambezi - a former member of the Central Zone group, Nafanya - guitarist of the Nafanya and Co. group. Later, Tipsy Tip shared his thoughts with journalists about the work of a group with an unusual name:\n\n“There is a hip-hop energy, it is wide and vast - you can roam on it, and for that I love it. “Shtora” has a completely different, distinctive sound, different mood of the tracks, but with a significant admixture of rap.”\n\nTipsy Tip is glad that he sings not solo, but together with the guys. One of the main highlights of the songs of the Shtora group is the bright and powerful sound of the button accordion.\n\nIt was Tipsy Tip who suggested that the soloists add an accordion to the track. In Ukraine, this musical instrument was very popular. The band's music is mega-cool and colorful.\n\nIn 2015, an interesting interview took place between Tipsy Tip and other members of the Shtora team. The guys were interviewed by the famous writer Zakhar Prilepin.\n\nIn 2017, Zakhar named Alexei Antipov his most favorite performer and encouraged music lovers to listen to the tracks of the Shtora group.\n\nIn 2016, the rapper presented the \"juicy\" album \"22: 22\". MiyaGi and Endgame took part in the recording of this disc. Fans appreciated the efforts of the guys.\n\nThe personal life of an artist\n\nAs for his personal life, this is the only thing that the performer does not like to talk about. Neither social networks nor Alexei Antipov himself confirm that he has a girlfriend.\n\nAlexei leads the right way of life. As far as possible, the young man visits the gym. He loves to travel and spend time with his mom.\n\nTipsy Tip today\n\nNow the performer and the Shtora musical group spend a lot of time on tour. At the beginning of 2018, Tipsy performed in the capital of the Russian Federation with the Big Spring Concert. In autumn, the rapper presented the new album \"Datynet\".\n\nThe latest news from the life of your favorite artist can be found on Twitter and Instagram. The rapper also posts his tour schedule there."
