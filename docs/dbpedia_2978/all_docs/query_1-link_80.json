        "text": "MUDVAYNE frontman Chad Gray says the band are currently working on new music\n\nIn a recent conversation with The Oakland Press, Chad Gray, the lead vocalist of MUDVAYNE, officially revealed that he and his fellow band members have been actively brainstorming concepts for fresh musical creations\n\nIt’s worth noting that the reformed metal group has abstained from presenting any new compositions since 2009. As the years have progressed, this absence of novel MUDVAYNE tracks has gradually approached the significant milestone of fifteen years.\n\n“We’ve already been working on some stuff,” he said. “We’ve got four [songs] in the pipe. I’ve written each one of them probably three different times, ’cause it’s like nothing’s good enough. We’re gonna keep pushing. We’re all getting along really good. We’re all talking. Hopefully we all want the same thing from our music, so we’ll see. It’s definitely the thing that makes the most sense to do now.”\n\nLast month, MUDVAYNE commenced their inaugural headlining tour in over 14 years, named “The Psychotherapy Sessions“. Live Nation is orchestrating this 26-city journey, and the bill boasts support from COAL CHAMBER, as well as GWAR, NONPOINT, and BUTCHER BABIES.\n\nIn the prior year of 2022, MUDVAYNE garnered attention with the “Freaks On Parade” tour, a co-headlining venture alongside ROB ZOMBIE. Yet, it is this tour in 2023 that stands as MUDVAYNE‘s foremost headlining pursuit since 2009.\n\nMUDVAYNE, a prominent nu-metal band, traces its origins back to Peoria, Illinois, in 1996. Comprising vocalist Chad Gray, guitarist Greg Tribbett, bassist Ryan Martinie, and drummer Matt McDonough, the group rapidly gained recognition for their unique fusion of aggressive metal and elements from alternative and progressive rock.\n\nIn 2000, MUDVAYNE released their debut studio album, “L.D. 50,” which showcased their innovative sound and intricate musicianship. The album’s distinctive combination of heavy riffs, complex rhythms, and Chad Gray‘s versatile vocals earned them a devoted following and critical acclaim.\n\nTheir subsequent albums, including “The End of All Things to Come” (2002), “Lost and Found” (2005), and “The New Game” (2008), further solidified MUDVAYNE‘s place within the nu-metal landscape. The band’s penchant for experimenting with both musical styles and visual aesthetics, often featuring elaborate face paint and distinctive stage attire, set them apart from their contemporaries."
