        "text": "MUDVAYNE played its third reunion show last Sunday night (November 14) at the Welcome To Rockville festival at the Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. An official video recap of the concert was uploaded to the band’s YouTube channel and can now be seen below.\n\nMUDVAYNE canceled its appearance at the Louder Than Life festival in Louisville, Kentucky in September after the band’s singer Chad Gray and “a few staff members” tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.\n\nMUDVAYNE played its first show in 12 years on September 11 at the Inkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival in Mansfield, Ohio.\n\nMUDVAYNE formed in 1996 and has sold over six million records worldwide, earning gold certification for three albums (“L.D. 50”, “The End Of All Things To Come”, “Lost And Found”). The band is known for its sonic experimentation, innovative album art, face and body paint, masks and uniforms. MUDVAYNE is Chad Gray (vocals), Greg Tribbett (guitar, backing vocals), Matthew McDonough (drums, synthesizer) and Ryan Martinie (bass).\n\nIt’s been more than a decade since MUDVAYNE released its self-titled fifth album and little had been heard about the group during that time.\n\nGray has spent the past 15 years fronting HELLYEAH, which released its sixth studio album, “Welcome Home”, in September 2019 via Eleven Seven Music. The disc marked the group’s final effort with drummer Vinnie Paul Abbott, who passed away more than three years ago.\n\nIn 2018, Tribbett said that fans who are calling for a MUDVAYNE reunion “just need a little more patience.” He explained: “We’re all flattered that everybody still wants MUDVAYNE to tour and do a new record and come out and do all that stuff. The thing is is that everybody is in three different bands and kind of doing their own projects, and there’s no time for that right now.”\n\nTribbett‘s most recent focus was AUDIOTOPSY, which released its second full-length album, “The Real Now”, in November 2018 via Megaforce Records. He is joined in that band by MUDVAYNE drummer Matt McDonough, SKRAPE vocalist Billy Keeton and bassist Perry Stern.\n\nMUDVAYNE did not tour behind its fifth album, which was barely promoted and sold weakly upon release.\n\nGray previously expressed skepticism about the possibility of a MUDVAYNE reunion, noting in a 2015 interview that “the only way I personally would want to do MUDVAYNE is if everybody licked their wounds and got over it.”\n\nTribbett was also part of HELLYEAH with Gray but was fired from that band in 2013.\n\nAsked in Revolver magazine if Greg‘s exit from HELLYEAH hit him especially hard, seeing as the two of them started off playing together in MUDVAYNE, Chad said: “Yeah, man. He has always been my right-hand man. He’s been the back I look at when I’m writing songs and the sounding board for my ideas. When everything went sideways, it was like losing a great friend. I was filled with fear and I had mixed emotions. At first, I was, like, ‘Goddamn, I don’t know if I’m ever gonna be able to do this without him.'”\n\nRelated\n\nComments\n\ncomments"
