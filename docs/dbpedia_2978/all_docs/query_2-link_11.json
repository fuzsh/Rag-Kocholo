Betty Rae, Chad's grandma, died in 2005.[5][6]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nThe video for the song is directed and conceptualized by Thomas Mignone and is shot in two locations: At the abandoned Seaview Hospital located in Staten Island, NY (also utilized in the film Jacob's Ladder), where the four members are playing their instruments; and a seemingly mystic beach in a remote part of Malibu, CA, where an old, frail woman is going through the transition into afterlife, and is aided by a little girl (the younger version of the elder woman) and vocalist Chad Gray to pass into heaven.[7]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (2001) Peak\n\nposition U.S. Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks[8] 32\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
