        "text": "When Mudvayne's record \"The New Game\" comes out Nov. 18, it will be the first studio album released from the Peoria-formed band in three years. And not to get too far ahead of ourselves, but there's more where that came from; a following record, due for release in the summer of 2009, is already making its way through the pipeline.\n\nThat should come as welcome news for fans of the metal band, made up of central Illinois natives Chad Gray, Ryan Martinie, Greg Tribbett and Matthew McDonough.\n\n- What: Mudvayne with special guests 10 Years and Snot.\n\n- When: 7 p.m. Nov. 26.\n\n- Where: East Peoria Event Center, 4200 E. Washington, East Peoria.\n\n- Cost: $31 at the door, or $29 in advance at Co-Op Records locations, Shandi's Music and More in Canton, online at JayTV.com or by calling (800) 514-3849.\n\n\"We've done so much touring and so much writing in 10 years it's ridiculous,\" said Tribbett, who, along with Gray, is also a member of the supergroup Hellyeah. \"It seems like we never have a break. Literally, we came off the tour with Hellyeah and two weeks later I was writing Mudvayne material.\"\n\nMudvayne, which formed in 1996 and made it big in 2000, will perform at the East Peoria Event Center on Nov. 26. The stop is part of a 35-city tour to promote \"The New Game,\" Work on the album began in 2006, and the delayed release is due to the fact that the band, during a creative streak, decided to go right back into the studio and continue producing material for the following, yet-untitled album before releasing \"The New Game,\" which was created in a remote area of Idaho.\n\n\"We actually started in Chicago and didn't get much done there, too much stuff going on,\" Tribbett said by telephone from a stop in Corpus Christi on the second day of the tour. \"So we ended up in Idaho, in the middle of nowhere. It was pretty secluded. It was a cool experience, we got everything done there, we had plenty of time - waking up and seeing deer and six feet of snow.\"\n\nTribbett said the nearest town was 20 miles away, and their only release was the occasional football game and time spent drinking beer.\n\n\"We'd been secluded on every record so far, that's kind of how we like it, we don't like distractions. We don't listen to a lot of music, either, even to be influenced or anything else,\" Tribbett said.\n\nIt's seems like that has always been the band's method of operation.\n\n\"All we did was lock ourselves in the basement, rehearse four times a week or something like that and write material,\" Tribbett said of Mudvayne's early days in central Illinois. \"We got a demo together, started selling it, then started shopping it and sending it to labels. We didn't even have MySpace back then, we just had a Web site. Now, you can get your music everywhere.\"\n\nPerhaps it's this kind of focus that helps crank out albums. \"The New Game\" includes \"Do What You Do,\" which Gray has said is about being \"a better person, a better parent, a better friend, a better colleague.\" In contrast, \"Dull Boy\" is about a crazy guy losing his mind - think Jack Nicholson in \"The Shining.\"\n\nIn press materials, Gray is quoted as saying \"The New Game\" includes political songs from the perspective of being in the military service, as well as from the point of view of a world leader.\n\n\"It's killing at different levels,\" Gray said. \"Just because you're not pulling the trigger doesn't mean you're not killing people. I started to analyze all the different levels of consciousness and what made people feel and act that way. The album is like a psychological profile of a lot of different characters.\"\n\nTribbett wouldn't reveal many details of the album to follow \"The New Game,\" except: \"We're still being creative, we still have a lot left to write and everybody still wanted to do it, so we were like, OK, let's just write another record,\" he said of the collection, which is due out in 2009. It will no doubt be another intense year for the musicians. With a schedule like this, what does Tribbett do with his free time?\n\n\"Absolutely nothing. When I have time off, I don't do anything, any kind of business or any of that crap because I'm doing it all the time. When I do get home, I just like to chill and relax,\" Tribbett said.\n\nSounds like a task for another day - for now it looks like the band members will just keep doing what they do."
