        "text": "Mudvayne\n\n“Lost and Found”\n\nEpic Records\n\nMudvayne exploded onto the national scene in 2000 with the release of “L.D. 50.” Despite having an EP under its belt (1997’s “Kill I Oughta”), this was the first taste most fans had to the band that mixed vocals delivered with a psychotic edge and heavy, groove-laden riffs with start-stop tempos. Add into the mix a helping of ethereal “mood” music and interludes and you have Mudvayne’s debut album.\n\nBut as good as “L.D. 50” was, it was also a little too eclectic for it’s own good. The thread holding some of the songs together was just too fine and the interludes were, at times, simply forgettable.\n\nThen, in addition to the musical problems, the band was type-cast as face-painted madmen, with the image (every member was painted up) soon overtaking the message of the music.\n\n2002’s “The End of All Things to Come” was an image overhaul of sorts. The music became more focused, albeit less intense. The band lost the facepaint but replaced it with an alien theme.\n\nWith two (or three if you want to include the re-release “The Beginning of All Things to End”) full-length albums under its belt, Mudvayne was still looking for the album to make or break the band.\n\n“Lost and Found” is that album. Simply put, it’s nothing short of a homerun.\n\n“Lost and Found” pulls in the best elements from the band’s entire career and strings them together as a metal masterpiece. There’s the tempo-changes, but they make more sense now and come across as less experimental. The vocals drift from the growls seething anger to the melodic delivery Chad Gray is more than capable of pulling off. The groove from the band’s debut EP is utilized. Truthfully, this album is the culmination of all the band’s previous work. And it doesn’t hurt that the band finally put away the image and the members are presented simply as themselves.\n\n“Determined” is the perfect opening track for the album, an exclamation point and mission statement all at the same time. Featuring the trademark growled, scratchy vocals and fantastic rhythm section, the song is probably one of the hardest-hitting tracks the band has recorded.\n\n“Happy?” is almost the perfect juxtaposition to such a track, more melodic and gentle in delivery (similar to “Not Falling” off the band’s second album). There’s the stutter-step tempo but (again) it seems to actually drive the song instead of pull attention away from it.\n\n“IMN” is the best of “L.D. 50” wrapped into one almost-six minute track: there’s the frantic tempo-changes, the sick bass work, the full array of vocal styles and, while Ryan Martinie’s bass-work is subtle at times, at others it takes center stage to amazing effect.\n\nEven when the band goes out on a limb this time, everything seems to blend together perfectly. The album’s longest track, “Choices,” which runs just over eight minutes in length, drifts back and forth between melody and driving force. And the distorted “inny, meeny, miny, mo” that breaks up the verses during the opening verses sounds crazy at first, but soon fits in so well you hardly notice it. Gray’s singing has never sounded better during the track’s driving bridges and choruses. The song unfolds to an epic as Greg Tribbett is let loose on the guitar and Gray punctuates his guitar bridges with scratchy exclamations.\n\nWhen listening to the album, it’s impossible not to note how grounded everything sounds thanks to Matt Mcdonough’s solid drumming. He can lay down a brutal wall of sound like the album’s opener, or offer up a more subtle back-beat in songs like “Forget to Remember” (thought he still comes across explosive during the choruses).\n\nOverall, “Lost and Found” is a glimpse at a band at its absolute best. This is the album Mudvayne’s fans knew the band was capable of, and an album that will convert countless others to the fan base.\n\nDefinitely one of the band’s best, “Lost and Found” is also a contender for album of the year. A great metal release … a great album in general."
