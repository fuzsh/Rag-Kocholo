        "text": "damn guys thank you SOOOO much im so happy you all enjoy it, and yea im not sure which of the songs is my favorite. if any of you follow me you'll notice berheavement is actually my first pickup comparison video from like a year ago hahaha\n\nthank you guys for all the support both on this and my personal vids ive posted on here. ill be doing playthroughs of all the songs HOPEFULLY soon except i had someone apparently break into my house a few days ago and among other things they stole my F****** camera so im trying to figure out how the hell to get ahold of a new one. but anyway as for the questions of ryan and matt being involved here is the story..\n\nso it started off as my old band Iodine Sky was kinda on the rocks, just the other guys didnt seem as into it as i was hoping so it was falling apart thus i started doing the youtube stuff as well as writing an abundance of just random 8 string material thinking \"if i was in a band this is what i would be proud of\" anyway around this time i had someone randomly friend request me on facebook.. turns out it was the guy i had bought my warwick thumb 5 from a few years back... his band had recently broke up and on a whim he found me and we talked a bit he said if i wanted shoot him some of the stuff i was doing so he had something to screw around with.\n\na few months go by and i was actually planning to do an EP with a few local singers each song featuring a different vocalist... the more i searched etc the more i loved my buddy mikes vocals, we had ALWAYS wanted to work together and its funny cause the band i used to tour in, he quit RIGHT before i joined so we had known of eachother a long time. anyway the guy is amazing,\n\nso this past winter the bassist (Jonathan Munnier) goes to NAMM with his friends in Strictly 7 as well as being a Warwick Endorsee, while there he runs into Ryan from Mudvayne they start talking allot about music etc and what is Ryan up to, he spills some of his projects etc but then says he really wants to get into producing but hasnt found a project he feels he can really benefit. jonathan mentions what we were doing just for fun etc he says yea sure shoot it my way ill check it out when i get home. a few days after NAMM ryan calls my bassist all freaking out excited saying he is in love with it, we all started putting stuff together and he was pretty much balls deep in the band since then.\n\na few weeks after that he asked us if we had a drummer, we had a few guys in mind but werent really sure what was going on, he mentioned brining in Matt saying he has been lookin for something fun to do etc and him and ryan are really close and he got him all excited tellling him how great he thought he music was.. we sent matt a few songs, had a few skype conversations, the rest is what you see/hear now with MUUUUUCH more to come... as of now we prolly have an ENTIRE full length written etc with in my oppinion some songs that are extremely out of the box and original i cant WAIT to record. but thats the story,\n\nthank you so much you guys for checking it out, if you're intersted after that long winded rant here is our facebook page as well\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ontsog"
