        "text": "John Petrucci Gears\n\nLast night i chat with my friend and we talk about any guitarist rig. He wants to know about john petrucci's (JP) rigs and setting. Today i search about any information about JP and i got it any information for his.\n\nHere is a list and some photos of the gear John is currently using for touring especially for you don !! :)\n\nGuitars\n\n1 Musicman JP BFR Rubyburst Baritone\n\n1 Musicman JP BFR Walnutburst Baritone\n\n1 Musicman JP BFR Walnutburst 7 String\n\n1 Musicman JP BFR Blackburst 7 String\n\n1 Musicman JP BFR Tobaccoburst\n\n1 Musicman JP BFR 2006 Ltd.

This film is release After \"Metal a headbanger journey\" by sam dunn (antropolog which concern on metal music).\n\nIn GLOBAL METAL, directors Scot McFadyen and Sam Dunn set out to discover how the West’s most maligned musical genre – heavy metal – has impacted the world’s cultures beyond Europe and North America. The film follows metal fan and anthropologist Sam Dunn on a whirlwind journey through Asia, South America and the Middle East as he explores the underbelly of the world’s emerging extreme music scenes — from Indonesian death metal to Chinese black metal to Iranian thrash metal. GLOBAL METAL reveals a worldwide community of metalheads who aren’t just absorbing metal from the West – they’re transforming it. Creating a new form of cultural expression in societies dominated by conflict, corruption and mass-consumerism.\n\nHeavy Metal in Baghdad\n\nmore : - Music News\n\nSome time ago my friend tell me about something interest with documenter film called \"Heavy Metal in Baghdad\".\n\nthis film tell about four musicians with band called Acrassicauda struggling to make a go of the rock and roll life in the middle of a war zone.\n\nIf popular perceptions are to be believed, then every Iraqi citizen would be a worshipful Muslim who hates all pop culture (particularly anything emanating from America) with a fervent zeal. Not so the Metallica-loving lads of Acrassicauda, the heavy-metal quartet from Baghdad portrayed with true concern and understanding in a documentary that succeeds (almost in spite of its filmmakers) in illustrating the necessity of art in even the worst situations.\n\nhere's for the movie trailer :\n\nand here's for ACRASSICAUDA's BIO\n\nBorn out of a basement rehearsal space in Baghdad, Acrassicauda (Latin for “Black Scorpion”) is Iraq’s only heavy metal band. Tutored by music instructor and guitar virtuoso Saad “Yngwie” Say and inspired by western bands like Metallica, Slayer and Slipknot, they began writing and playing metal in 2001. They soon learned that their dream of performing live in Iraq was going to be no easy task.\n\nOriginal members Firas (bass), Tony (lead guitar), Marwan (drums), Faisal (rhythm guitar) and Waleed (lead vocals) were only able to play 3 shows before the war started in 2003. Soon after, Waleed retired from the band and fled the country, leaving Faisal to fill the void of lead singer. Due to increased security precautions throughout Iraq, it became difficult to practice or even get through a show without serious problems. As the situation worsened in Baghdad they began receiving death threats from insurgent groups and religious fundamentalists accusing them of Satan-worship. Eventually, it proved impossible to find any venue that was safe to perform in.\n\nThanks to generous donations made on their behalf, the band now resides in Turkey after living a year as refugees in Damascus, Syria. In their seven years as a band they have managed to play only 6 concerts in Baghdad, 2 in Syria and one in Turkey. The war has all but destroyed their dream to live in peace, grow their hair long, bang their heads and play metal as loud as they want. Life in Turkey is proving extremely difficult for them. Acrassicauda is literally a band on the run.\n\ninformation has taken from any source :)\n\nDan Donegan Gear and Amplification\n\nmore : - Gear reviews\n\nDan Donegan (born August 1, 1968 in Oak Lawn, Illinois) is an American musician and guitarist for Disturbed. Donegan began playing guitar as a teenager and eventually formed a band called Vandal, which was an '80s-style hair band. Recently, Donegan was added to the guitar show \"Chop Shop's\" list of \"Top 100 Most Complete Guitar Players of All Time\" at number 76.\n\nEarly on with his career with Disturbed, Donegan played Gibson Les Paul Standards and SGs. Then, he switched to play a few Paul Reed Smith models, the Tremonti Model and a PRS Singlecut. In 2005, Washburn Guitars built Donegan his own signature model called the Maya, named after his daughter. Donegan is a fan of GHS Boomer guitar strings and uses the 12-52 gauge set. He also uses Seymour Duncan pickups in his guitars.\n\nDonegan has primarily used Randall(his signature being the 1082) and Mesa Boogie Amplifiers, using Randalls for indoor events, and using MESA amps for outdoor gigs. He used to play on Marshall amps during the very early days of Disturbed.\n\nDonegan also uses the DigiTech Dan Donegan, The Weapon, that DigiTech made for him. He also uses the DigiTech Whammy Pedal and has been seen using the DigiTech Metal Master distortion pedal. According to an interview in 2000, Donegan also uses the BOSS PH-2 Super Phaser, a Dunlop Crybaby Wah, and an Ernie Ball Volume pedal. He also uses a BBE Sonic Maximize.\n\nrig mapping\n\nRyan Martinie with Warwick Gear\n\nmore : - Gear reviews\n\nAlso known as : Ry-Know Rü-d\n\nBorn : August 6, 1975 (1975-08-06) (age 33)\n\norigin : Peoria, Illinois, USA\n\nGenre(s): Heavy metal, progressive metal\n\nInstrument(s): Bass guitar\n\nYears active: 1998 - Present\n\nLabel(s): Epic Records\n\nAssociated acts : Mudvayne\n\nEarly life\n\nRyan Martinie grew up playing bass in Normal, Illinois. His father gave him his first bass at the age of twelve, at which time he began picking out Metallica songs to teach himself.\n\nHe studied jazz bass, and won several high school awards for classical vocals. He also became interested in sword swallowing.\n\nHe was in a Dream Theater-styled progressive rock band called Broken Altar. Former members of Broken Altar Les Aldridge (guitarist) and Wes Pollock (drummer) joined heavy metal band LowTwelve of Bloomington, Illinois.\n\nStyle\n\nRight hand\n\nRyan is known for pushing the envelope that most metal bassists limit themselves to. His right hand is one of the major reasons for this, as he pulls from many different techniques and genres. He is known for flicks (found throughout his music) and a flamenco style. Ryan uses a tapping technique on the neck where he will use his index and middle fingers to tap an octave chord while his left hand moves the chord.\n\nLeft Hand\n\nMartinie is known as a precise player. Even when playing his Pedulla fretless he uses quick movements and jogs up and down the neck. Ryan tends to accentuate his work with thick low end, double stops, and chords that add warmth or awkward tension. He uses harmonics that add a bright sound to his variety of styles, such as the intro to \"Death Blooms\" and also in \"Not Falling\".\n\nEquipment\n\nBasses\n\nMain bass: Warwick Thumb Bass 5-string, ebony fingerboard, chrome hardware, nickel frets.\n\nBack-up basses: Thumb 4, rosewood neck and gold hardware. Also two Thumb 5 stringers with ebony and rosewood necks and bubinga bodies & also a fretless Pedulla Buzz 4. In several images he has been seen with, but never using, a Warwick Vampyre bass.\n\nStrings: Ryan uses Dr Hi-Beams .045-.105 with a .135 5th string, tuned to F#-B-F#-B-E and B-F#-B-E (as heard in LD50), and for Mudvayne's newer albums he is tuned to G-C-G-C-F and C-G-C-F. Sets action high for live shows and low for recording.\n\nAmplification\n\nLive Setup: runs his bass into a Shure UHF U4D dual-channel wireless unit, Whirlwind multi-selector, dbx 160 compressor, Ampeg SVT-4Pro head on an SVT PR-810H 8x10 cabinet. Also has a BSS AR133 direct box that runs from the SVT-4Pro's effect loop.\n\nRecording setup: Full Ampeg rig, plus an SWR Workingman's 10 Head driving Greg Tribbett's Mesa Boogie 4x12 guitar cabinet for added midrange and top end.\n\nFor Mudvayne's newest album, 'The New Game', Ryan switched to Warwick amplification. He recorded using an X-Treme 10.1 head and two 410 Pro cabinets. He will be taking two stacks with him while he tours.\n\nMatthew McDonough\n\nmore : - Biography\n\nBirth name: Matthew McDonough\n\nAlso known as: sPaG; Spüg; MjDawn\n\nOrigin: Peoria, Illinois\n\nGenre(s): Heavy metal, progressive metal\n\nOccupation(s): Drummer\n\nInstrument(s): Drums\n\nYears active: 1996–present\n\nLabel(s) : Epic Records\n\nAssociated acts: Mudvayne\n\nWebsite www.mudvayne.com\n\nMatthew McDonough is the drummer for American heavy metal band Mudvayne.

In 1998, then bassist Shawn Barclay was replaced by current bassist Ryan Martinie.\n\nSigning with Epic (1998)\n\nA critical turning point for the band occurred in April 1998 when local promoter Steve Soderstrom hosted Soda Pop Production's \"Original Hard Rock Music Showcase\" at the now defunct Hub Ballroom in Edelstein, Illinois. Mudvayne along with fifty seven other Peoria bands answered the radio ad and was one of the twelve bands chosen to perform live on two stages. Soda Pop Productions followed the show up with \"Shredfest\" on the Peoria riverfront stage which Mudvayne also played.
