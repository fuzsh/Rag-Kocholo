        "text": "Yup, Ryan is a total badass. I'm happy for the other guys but it would be pretty cool to see something like this with Ryan in the mix.\n\nI saw Mudvayne in Frankfurt, Germany back in the LD 50 days. I was right up against the stage in front of Ryan for the whole set. (I still have the setlist that was taped to his monitor) Watching him play was just awesome. Definitely one of my favorite bass players in metal period.\n\nI was just talking to my guitarist last week about Greg being the weakest link in Mudvayne's material. What he does worked for those tunes I suppose, but I never *listened* to his parts like I have the other 3 guys in the band.\n\nChad was a major influence on me when I started screaming (except I actually have concern over my vocal health....Chad DGAF!) and Ryan and Matt are just so interesting together, Ryan for the obvious reasons but I always dug how you can't really pinpoint Matt's influences.\n\nMy drummer has known the guys in Nonpoint for years, when they came off Ozzfest a while back they shared a few stories, they said nearly every time Mudvayne's bus would park you'd see the door open and then 2 or 3 band members would get out and just start throwing punches at each other.\n\nI really don't doubt the truth in that being that these guys had a good solid 3 records in a row and made some pretty good headway in a business that was diminishing as they were growing. Then at the highest peak they hit commercially, Chad and Greg go and do Hellyeah.\n\nI used to watch that LD50 live in peoria dvd and was always struck by how awful the guitar player was. His tone sounded like styrofoam crap and he often was totally off-time with the bassist and drummer and it was like he didn't know how to play guitar right or he was just deaf. So bad. The intro to Prod was especially heinous. So yeah, no bassist = no care The drummer's good but not unique enough to make me listen.\n\nI thought Ryan and Matt put something together a couple years ago....maybe they were just producing?\n\nHahaha, I just googled him and this popped up-\n\nHe did some work with some guys from the Korn camp, one of their drum techs and the dude who played in Head's band.......and jesus, it sounds like something Korn would have released in the last 10 years.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KjqSTMq1dRY\n\nMudvayne Bassist Ryan Martinie Returns In New Project With Ex-Head Guitarist | Theprp.com\n\nI was just talking to my guitarist last week about Greg being the weakest link in Mudvayne's material.

Then at the highest peak they hit commercially, Chad and Greg go and do Hellyeah.\n\nTotally agreed with the importance of Ryan, Chad and Matt, each one of those guys brought something huge to Mudvayne. Greg did a good job, but I always felt that any number of guitarists could have stood in for him.\n\nRyan is and always was the standout talent, it's a shame what's happened to his career these days."
