Both musicans tend to create evocative sound textures, opening as a traveling over their analogical dreams. Short tales made of samples and waves, energised by tribal beats. Soundtrack for the early party letting time for the moon and the tempo to set, or for afters to slow down the nocturnal excesses and celebrate the return of the Sun. Aes dana’s music is to be enjoyed between the veils.\n\nSolar Fields– Ultimae Records – Gothenburg, Sweden // LIVE\n\nSwedish based electronic music composer and graphic designer who as been involved in many projects since a teenager, playing drums, percussions, piano, guitar, for various bands before launching his own project Solar Fields in 2001 with the album “Reflective Frequencies”. Magnus always built a unique sound universe, poles apart from current trends in the genre, he explores the wide possibilities of electronic ambient; atmospheric, deep, ecstatic, industrial yet organic, cultivating contrasts and subtelty with brio.\n\nAs a “high tech” sound designer (sampling, sequencing, morphing, programming,…) and multi-instrumentalist, Magnus collaborated with several art galleries and museum, his latest sound installation at Trabekel (Sandviken, spring 2004) met a great success. In synchronisation to the work of pictural artist Antonio Sognasoldi, he presented four pieces which could be played simultaneously and evolve depending on the position of the visitor in the gallery.\n\nIn November 2005 were released [ Leaving Home ] and [ Extended ], the later being a limited edition. These two albums are receiving excellent comments from the media, opening new horizons for Magnus Birgersson and his true visionary work.\n\nIn 2007 he began composing a stunning in-game score for Mirror’s Edge, Electronic Arts (EA) and DICE, a new first-person action adventure game released worldwide on 14th November 2008.

Kris Northern lays down Portland’s most twisted and bass-ridden hybrid live sets of psychedelic future funk breaks, and you would not be surprised to see a party of robots getting down on his dance floor. A master of the science of slicing and dicing, Phidelity’s tech funk is loaded up with tons of real-time effects, creating an experience that uses the science of sound creation. Hailing from Portland and representing Native State Records, his dub-laced sticky bass is overlaid with plenty of clean green grit and the moving goodness of his world is imposed on all who listen and dance- robots included.\n\nPrimordial Ooze – Chilluminati – Chicago/Milwaukee // LIVE\n\nPrimordial Ooze is the unstoppable juggernaut duo of Scott Collins and Igor Vazhenin. Pants dropping basslines, combined with sounds originating from the creation of mankind gives the listener an experience unlike any they’ve had before.\n\nDixon’s Violin – Mi // LIVE\n\nDixon is one part concert violinist, one part digital effects master, and one part shaman. He blends his classical training with soulful improvisation skills and the command of a wide range of digital technology to create a captivating one-man show unlike anything you’ve experienced. Dixon’s mesmerizing sound and passionate energy will enchant, transform, and inspire you.\n\nDrache Musik – Indianapolis // LIVE\n\ndRachEmUsiK is the most recent project by international, award wining electronic musician, sound designer and producer Charles Shriner. The current sound of dRachEmUsiK has been described as “glitch-groove ambient beats with a strong modal jazz influence”. Simple melodies swirling in mixed tempos and undulating textures. Dense, erotic, evocative, emotional, spontaneous and sometimes noisy. dRachEmUsiK blends improvisation with structure and is performed in real time. The music is fresh, innovative and eclectic while maintaining enough familiar elements to remain accessible without compromising creative integrity. Sounds like; Squarepusher, George Shearing (on acid), Morton Subotnk and Techno-Animal. Glitch-Groove Elektronique with a touch of Ambient and Strong Modal Jazz Influence. Simple melodies swirling in mixed tempos, and undulating textures. Dense, erotic, complex, emotional, spontaneous. Stunning real-time visuals. And he plays the electric clarinet.\n\nLeoHawk – Mighty Quinn Records – San Francisco, Ca\n\nLeo Burkatov aka DJ LeoHawk was born in Kazakstan, Almaty in 1982 and moved to San Francisco in 1992, He has been djing since 1998. Starting out with Melodic and Hard Trance on Vinyl and now playing the most “Full Power” Psy he can find since a Goa Gil experience on October 5th, 2000. A fine mixture of light and dark music, with defined kicks and rumbling base lines is what you can expect every time without fail. Mixing in tracks all the time without stopping is not easy and this is why he dances and sweats through every performance while delivering perfect mixes with epic punctuation!\n\nLeoHawk has performed at various outdoor and indoor, musical and arts festivals all around the United States As of Jan. 2011 LeoHawk became a Label DJ under Mighty Quinn Records. LeoHawk spends most of his time organizing psychedelic gatherings such as Alchemy Festival, Goa Gil, How Weird Street Fair the Resonance Gatherings and many more…, DJing and producing music in and around San Francisco, CA, USA which can be felt in pure healing light vibration all around our humble little planet.\n\nNick Synergy – Overmind Works – Phoenix, AZ\n\nNick Synergy hails from the southern midwest. After some experience as a mainstream DJ, he caught the techno bug in 1992, ironically from the radio. The newfound rave culture also fascinated him, and thus he became increasingly absorbed by DJing and electronic music. He began beatmatching in 1995 and has been immersed in many facets of underground dance culture ever since.\n\nHe’s a bit of an idealist, but something of a realist. He has a benevolent nature and brings a solid work ethic to creating and promoting events. Gravitating toward the funky, groovy, and progressive sides of electronic music, the dynamic vibe this man carries is best demonstrated by the music he plays.\n\npocketchange – Day Four Records – Madison, Wi\n\n//((~*GROWTH WORKSHOPS~*))\n\nOrganized by KORU- get involved at theChilluminati Forum\n\nplus…\n\n// Fire and dance performances\n\n// Close encounters of the first, second, and third kinds\n\n// Mindblowing UV deco installations both on stage… and off…\n\n// Growth workshops; commune with your fellow psy-goers and learn something in the process!\n\n// Interstellar space travel\n\n// Much, much, more!\n\n// WHERE:\n\nVenue address:\n\nN8390 US Hwy 12 & 27\n\nBlack River Falls, Wi\n\nLongitude: -90.67328\n\nLatitude: 44.20615\n\nAbout The Chilluminati:"
