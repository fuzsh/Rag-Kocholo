The\n\nspecially designed package comprises five plug-in processors:\n\nRenaissance Reverb, EQ and Compressor; the C1 Parametric Compander; and\n\nS1 Stereo Imager.\n\nThe decision to choose Waves DSP plug-ins was made by Berklee as\n\npart of a comprehensive plan to require all students to acquire certain\n\ncritical technology platforms. All incoming students must now purchase\n\nApple G4 laptop computers equipped with certain software packages. As\n\npart of an academic initiative, students are asked to add other\n\nspecific platforms upon choosing certain majors. Those who choose one\n\nof five majors from the Professional Writing and Music Technology\n\ndivisions—including the departments of Contemporary Writing and\n\nProduction, Film Scoring, Songwriting, Music Synthesis, and Music\n\nProduction and Engineering—must own the Waves Berklee Bundle as\n\npart of their academic toolset.\n\nFor more information on Waves plug-ins, visit the company’s newly\n\nredesigned Website at www.waves.com.\n\nHouse Ear Institute Reports Noise’s Impact on Hearing\n\nHouse Ear Institute researchers recently presented data compiled since\n\n1997 indicating that high-frequency hearing loss from noise-induced\n\ninner-ear damage is evident in individuals repeatedly exposed to high\n\nlevels of sound (i.e., musicians, music industry professionals, audio\n\nengineers and systems contractors). The report results from thousands\n\nof hearing screenings conducted at trade shows attended by such audio\n\nprofessionals.\n\nEven when thresholds were within normal limits, all groups shared a\n\ncharacteristic “noise-notch,” or loss of hearing sensitivity around the\n\n4 to 6kHz frequency range. Further, compared to the general population,\n\nboth men and women in music and sound careers show more hearing loss\n\nacross all age groups.\n\n“This is the first study of this scope to assess hearing loss among\n\nprofessionals in the music and audio industries,” says Rachel Cruz,\n\nM.A., CCC-A/FAAA, a research audiologist at the House Ear Institute.\n\n“Study results confirm what we’ve suspected for a long time: These\n\ngroups not only have high-frequency hearing damage from over exposure\n\nto loud sounds, they also acquire it earlier than individuals in the\n\ngeneral population, who may experience a high-frequency hearing loss as\n\nthey age.”\n\nWhen assessing hearing damage for these groups, HEI researchers also\n\nconsidered exposure to noise sources outside of the work environment\n\nthat might contribute to hearing loss. These additional noise sources\n\nincluded recreational activities and hobbies, home and yard maintenance\n\nwith power equipment, and commuter noise (car/train/bus). Comparative\n\nstudies were included to determine contributing factors such as gender,\n\nage and history of vocational noise exposure to loud sounds.\n\nHEI researchers emphasize that noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is\n\nthe one type of hearing loss that is preventable and encourage all\n\nmusic and audio professionals to wear appropriate hearing protection\n\nwhere sound levels exceed the 85dB SPL for extended periods of\n\ntime.\n\nFor specific sound exposure guidelines, please visit the Sound\n\nPartners page on the HEI Website at www.hei.org.\n\nLittle Kids Rock Manhattan Center Studios\n\nLittle Kids Rock, a nonprofit music education program that provides\n\nfree instruments and instruction to children in public schools,\n\nannounced the completion of another celebrity recording session for its\n\nupcoming project, Little Kids, Big Fans: Stars United for Music\n\nEducation. Two tracks, “”Little Dinosaur” and “Everyone Loves\n\nthe Rainbow,” were recorded at Manhattan Center Studios.\n\nThe new CD features high-profile artists covering versions of songs\n\nwritten by Little Kids Rock students. Artists already onboard include\n\nBilly Joel’s percussionist, Liberty DeVitto; Public Enemy’s Brian\n\nHardgroove; Victor Burks of the Fine Arts Militia; Tom Johnson (Doobie\n\nBrothers); Jason Newsted, (Voivod); blues guitarist Roy Rogers; Zigaboo\n\nModaliste (The Meters); and singer Austin Willacy.\n\nFuture stages of the production will include several more recording\n\nsessions, post-production/mixing/mastering, art production, CD\n\nduplication, distribution, marketing and several benefit concerts. In\n\nthe coming months, both Manhattan Center Studios in New York and the\n\nPlant in Sausalito, Calif., will be donating their time and services to\n\nLittle Kids Rock. The CD is slated for release in December 2004.\n\nIn other Manhattan Center News, its sister company, Manhattan Center\n\nProductions, recently signed an agreement with NewYorkDVD to be the\n\npreferred in-house provider of expert-level DVD authoring and project\n\ndevelopment for MCP clients, including live music and performance acts\n\nbooked in both the Grand Ballroom and the Hammerstein Ballroom, which\n\nare operated by Manhattan Center Studios.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.mcp-studios.com.\n\nNew Release: Tassman 4\n\nTassman recently announced the new Tassman 4 modular sound synthesis\n\nstudio, which arrives with an expanded library, audio input processing\n\ncapability and other upgraded features.\n\nTassman 4’s new Performance mode provides instant access to sounds\n\nby combining a synth, a preset, effects and MIDI maps.

The multitrack recording techniques that\n\nblossomed in the late 1960s and early 1970s would have been impossible\n\nwithout Dolby’s invention because the tape hiss would have been\n\nintolerable,” said Fred Allen, head of the selection committee for the\n\nNational Inventors Hall of Fame Foundation. “And today, applied to\n\nconsumer formats and motion picture sound, the results are even more\n\nfar-reaching. With the removal of tape noise, cinema sound became\n\nhigher fidelity and paved the way for even more sophisticated surround\n\nsound formats like Dolby Stereo.”\n\nAt a ceremony at the National Inventors Hall of Fame headquarters in\n\nAkron, Ohio, Dolby and 19 other inventors joined such historic figures\n\nas Alexander Graham Bell, Eli Whitney and Thomas Edison in the National\n\nInventors Hall of Fame. To qualify for this distinction, an inductee’s\n\ninvention must have contributed to the welfare of society and have\n\npromoted the progress of science and the useful arts. All nominations\n\nare reviewed by the National Inventors Hall of Fame Selection\n\nCommittee, which comprises representatives from national science and\n\ntechnology organizations.\n\nRead about Dolby’s latest developments at www.dolby.com.\n\nVOX Takes the Stage at Florida Grammy Showcase\n\nVOX Amplification was chosen as an equipment sponsor for the first\n\nFlorida Grammy® Showcase held in Miami Beach this past March.\n\nVOX AC30s were used throughout the show, which comprised live\n\nperformances from six unsigned acts selected from more than 250\n\nentries.\n\nFor more information on VOX and the AC30, visit www.voxamps.co.uk.\n\nMusictech Opens American Pop Music College in Europe\n\nMusictech College announced plans to open its first college of American\n\npopular music in Europe this fall.

The Retouch system\n\nwill be used with the company s SADiE RADiA workstation.\n\nSADiE users since 1993, the Contact program, produced by\n\nSacred Heart Program and syndicated to more t han 300 stations\n\nnationwide, portrays stories of real people meeting and surmounting\n\nreal-life challenges.\n\n“”Some of the productions in our archives go back as far as\n\nthe 1950s,” says Jim Hone, production director at Sacred Heart Radio.\n\n“They were produced at a time when broadcast technology was at one\n\nstage. Today, we’re at a completely different stage, one in which any\n\nartifacts that the older productions have will be magnified\n\nconsiderably. But with the Retouch system, we can make them sound as\n\ngood and new as they did 30 years ago.”\n\nContemporary productions also receive treatment from Retouch. Sonic\n\nartifacts that occur while doing voice-overs and other open-microphone\n\nrecording for the show are located and eliminated using Retouch\n\nalgorithms and the SADiE workstation.\n\nFor more information on CEDAR, visit www.sadie.com.\n\nFox Station Chooses Two Euphonix Max Airs\n\nFox-owned and -operated WOFL-TV has purchased two Euphonix Max Air\n\ndigital audio consoles.

The U.S., Great Britain and\n\nFrance rejected a Russian bid for membership in NATO; and Roger\n\nBannister, an Oxford medical student shattered track and field’s most\n\nfamed barrier, running a mile course in three minutes and 59 seconds.\n\nLooking off the newspaper front pages—meaning way off—you\n\nmight have noticed a tiny birth announcement for future pro audio\n\nmagnate Lynn Martin.\n\nOne of those guys who shrugged off the notion that he’d ever reach\n\n30—much less 50—Martin lived the ultimate dream rock ‘n’\n\nroll lifestyle of playing screaming electric violin solos in a long\n\nstring of bands that ultimately went nowhere. However, the years of\n\nroad life, filthy roadside bathrooms, late-night gigs in sleazy clubs\n\nand an existence on cheap cigarettes and cold morning-after pizza took\n\ntheir toll, and Martin gave up his wandering ways for a real daytime\n\ngig.\n\nOf course, as a musician, the ultimate fantasy job is to work in a\n\nmusic store, selling gear to other people who somehow think they can\n\nmake money in this biz. It’s always been this way, so he signed on at\n\nK&K Music in the bustling metropolis of Sacramento, Calif. After\n\nworking there long enough to get all of the gear he needed at an\n\nemployee discount, Martin quit and became a manufacturers rep for Brian\n\nTrankle & Associates, calling on local stores and dealers and\n\nwholesaling them gear that they could sell to musicians who thought\n\nthey could make money in this biz.\n\nMartin’s friendly smile and easy-going nature helped him in his new\n\ncareer, but also led to a stumble or two, according to Skip Maggiora of\n\nleading Sacramento retailer Skip’s Music: “I always enjoyed giving Lynn\n\na hard time and he made it very easy since he could be pretty gullible.\n\nEven before he heard the news, I already knew he would be offered the\n\nrep job. This was a perfect opportunity pull a fast one on my good\n\nfriend Lynn. Knowing he’d be my new rep for Audio-Technica and\n\nDigitech, I sat in my office and waited for his call, which came later\n\nthat day. Lynn was excited and said, ‘I have some good news for you,’\n\nbut before he could say anything else, I said, ‘I’ve got some news for\n\nyou: You don’t have to worry about losing any of those A-T or Digitech\n\nsales [from K&K] to Skip’s anymore, because I just discontinued\n\nboth lines!’ There was a long silence on the other end of the phone and\n\nwith a whole lot less excitement in his voice, Lynn asked, ‘You’re not\n\ndoing business with A-T or Digitech anymore?’ I quickly said, ‘No,\n\nnever again. Why?’ I let him stew on it as long as I could. I knew that\n\nhe had probably already seen just how much business we were doing in\n\nhis new territory and had calculated those numbers into his new\n\npaycheck. Of course, I was just kidding him and went on to do a lot of\n\nbusiness with Lynn.”\n\nTurning his back on the Golden State, Martin pulled up stakes and\n\nmoved to Salt Lake City in 1991, beginning a long stint with the Harman\n\nMusic Group, helping to develop the Allen & Heath and dbx brands.\n\nIn a November 2002 interview in Mix magazine, he was quoted as saying,\n\n“I knew I was in the right profession when I found myself developing,\n\nmarketing and selling products for the brands and the type of gear that\n\nI used to dream of owning.” However, what he really meant to say was\n\nthat as a manufacturer, he could use rep firms to sell gear to dealers\n\nwho’d sell gear to musicians who thought they could make money in this\n\nbiz. And after eight years of that (and a long, unfulfilled yearning\n\nfor decent local sushi), he returned to California as the VP of\n\nmerchandising for Guitar Center’s technology division.\n\nAllen & Heath left the Harman group in 2001, and Martin saw an\n\nopportunity. Some months later, he left Guitar Center to form NAPA\n\n(North American Pro Audio), an Agoura Hills, Calif.-based consortium\n\nthat handles U.S. distribution of A&H and other brands, including\n\nthe famed Swedish Hagstrom guitars, again putting Lynn ever-closer to\n\nthat lifelong dream of selling gear to people who think they can make\n\nmoney in this biz.\n\nSo today, May 7, 2004, marks Lynn Martin’s first half-century. If\n\nyou know Martin, drop a note or call to wish him a couple\n\nmore…half-centuries, that is. He’ll appreciate it.\n\nMix correspondent George Petersen also runs www.crazycampsongs.com, a Website offering wacky\n\nchildren’s music books to people who think there’s money to be made in\n\nthe music biz.\n\nQueen Teams With Waves for Video Reissue\n\nThe band Queen remains an icon of glamorous, orchestral rock ’’n’\n\nroll, having carved a lasting place in music history with an indelible\n\ncatalog of rousing anthems and compelling ballads. Queen’s huge fan\n\nbase continues to devour a steady stream of reissues of the group’s\n\nclassic recordings. The use of Waves’ digital signal processing\n\nplug-ins has allowed the band’s recordings to stay as true as possible\n\nto the originals.\n\nQueen’s Greatest Video Hits 2, a compilation of Queen music\n\nvideos with audio remixed in 5.1, is the latest release in a series\n\nthat includes Live At Wembley Stadium, The Game and\n\nGreatest Video Hits 1. The new project was remixed by Justin\n\nShirley-Smith, Kris Fredriksson and Josh Macrae with Queen bandmates\n\nRoger Taylor and Brian May. Members of the team worked in two different\n\nstudios in the UK on two identical Digidesign Pro Tools|HD systems,\n\nboth of which are equipped with Waves’ Renaissance DSP tools as part of\n\nthe Gold Bundle of plug-ins. This setup allows Macrae and Shirley-Smith\n\nto work on the same piece of music in identical digital environments\n\nand trade sound files back and forth.\n\n“”The Waves plug-ins have been critical to making these Queen\n\nreissue projects sound as good as they do,” remarked Macrae. “The\n\nprocessing in the Renaissance bundle is remarkable and we use it on\n\nvirtually every aspect of the project. I’ll start with the Waves EQ as\n\nthe primary equalization for everything. I’ll also have the Renaissance\n\ncompression on individual tracks and then across the entire mix. In\n\nbetween, I’ll apply various other Waves processors, such as the\n\nflangers and the delays. All of them are incredible-sounding as digital\n\nsignal processors, but they go a step further. Only Waves plug-ins are\n\ncapable of making tracks that are, in some cases, 20 years old sound\n\nlike new, yet still leave in the analog warmth of the original\n\nrecordings. It’s actually quite amazing: The Renaissance processors\n\ncolor the sound but in such a way that’s sympathetic to the original\n\nrecordings. That’s not a quality I have found in any other plug-ins,\n\never. The success of the Queen reissues also tells us that the Waves\n\nplug-ins are the only tool for this job. Simply put, they are\n\nremarkable.”\n\nFor more information about the latest Queen projects, please visit\n\nwww.queenonline.com.

DVI, often the preferred format for professional\n\nA/V applications, transmits high-resolution uncompressed digital video\n\ndata from source to display. HDMI, geared toward the consumer market,\n\ntransmits high-resolution uncompressed digital video and multichannel\n\ndigital audio from source to display. When used with computer-based\n\nsystems, DDC control signals are sent in addition to HDTV video on\n\ntheir own dedicated Cat-5 cable.\n\nThe HDTV Extender is HDCP-compliant, retails for $499 and is\n\navailable to order at www.gefen.com. Shipping should begin within six to\n\neight weeks. The HDTV Extender comes with its own sender and receiver\n\nunits, both powered by a single 5-volt external supply and connection\n\ncables.\n\nSoundelux Debuts the E250 Cardioid Tube Mic\n\nConceived and designed purely as a vocal microphone, the Soundelux E250\n\ncardioid tube condenser rethinks classic tube microphone design to\n\naddress the inherent problems with the modern practice of close-miking\n\nloud vocals. Classic tube condenser microphones were never meant to be\n\nplaced within six inches of loud vocalists, yet producers and engineers\n\nlove the presence, size and low-frequency boost this adds to their\n\nartist’s sound. However the proximity effect’s low-frequency buildup\n\nand the upper midrange/treble tilt of many old classic cardioid\n\nmicrophones can also work counterproductively, causing problems\n\nrequiring extensive outboard signal processing.\n\nDesigner David Bock remarks, “I started out designing a more\n\naffordable and mellow version of the ELUX 251 while still retaining all\n\nthe 251’s meat and sound something you can’t get from a 47 or any of\n\nthe other vintage mics. The E250 is not as bright as the 251 with its\n\npronounced high-frequency peak. The 250 is mellowed down a bit, and I\n\nsculpted the proximity effect more toward the middle of the vocal range\n\nthan down below it where it usually lives. Basically, the 250 is a\n\ncondenser version of the 251 optimized for close vocals and includes\n\nall our modern enhancements with lower noise and distortion specs.”\n\nAnother problem with close-miking vocals is high-frequency\n\ndirectionality, or the “beaming effect.” This is where any slight head\n\nmovement by the singer can produce a big change in the high-frequency\n\ncontent. Bock continues, “The new E250 has a broader cardioid polar\n\npattern than our standard 251, which is fairly directional up close,\n\nand that makes it much more forgiving in these cases.”\n\nThe E250 is similar-looking to the ELUX 251 with the same color\n\nscheme but with a one-piece body and without a chromed windscreen. The\n\nE250 is delivered in a wood box, comes with a custom shock-mount and\n\nthe P251 power supply (same as ELUX 251).\n\nDerived from the 251, the capsules are hand-picked and individually\n\ntested. They have a 1-inch diameter with a 6-micron-thick\n\ngold-vapor-deposited diaphragm. Like the 251, the entire capsule is\n\nmounted in a brass holder. Bock also chose a different tube and output\n\ntransformer than the ELUX 251 and kept Soundelux’s Stable Bias\n\ncircuitry design to prevent the sound of the mic changing with\n\ndynamics. The mic’s frequency response stays constant whether the\n\nvocalist is singing loud or soft.\n\nFor more information, go to Soundelux’s U.S. distributor,\n\nTransamerica Audio Group, at www.transaudiogroup.com.\n\nTC-Helicon Rebate Extended\n\nAnyone who is interested in TC-Helicon’s vocal processor Quintet should\n\nact now, as the $100 rebate, which began February 1 and was scheduled\n\nto end May 1, has now been extended to June 1, 2004.

Montes used a string ensemble, piano and acoustic guitar. “The challenge for me was doing a lot of musical experimenting. I wrote a lot of pieces—more than we would ever use—played them for Paul and after detailed discussions, I moved forward from there.”\n\nBelle, a short film directed by New York filmmaker Ruth Sergel, features Klezmer-style compositions recorded live using tuba, clarinet, cello, violin and trombone. “Klezmer music is filled with a lot of spirituality and joy,” says Montes. “I did a lot of research and was able to find some early recordings made in the 1900s. Listening to those records helped me understand the tonality, instrumentation and the spirit of it all.”\n\nFor more information on Sacred Noise, visit www.sacrednoise.com.\n\nAbleton Offers New Web Bundles\n\nThe Ableton Webshop now offers Live 3 bundled with seven other products, including Live FireWire Audiophile, Live Indigo DJ bundle, Live Hammerfall bundle, Live FW-410 bundle, Live Ozone bundle, Live X-Session bundle and Live UC-33e bundle.\n\nAll bundles come with an Ableton T-Shirt, an exclusive Ableton mousepad and free shipping charges.

You need something smaller while still maintaining the necessary pattern control.\n\n“With the triks’ four 8-inch direct-radiating low-frequency drivers, four 5-inch midrange drivers and a 1-inch high-frequency driver, and the contribution of the two SPL-runts, we were able to put the sound right on the audience, maintaining intelligibility down to a low frequency.”\n\nTwo clustered triktraps were suspended from the ceiling 30 feet over the middle of the platform. To that cluster’s left and right, dB Audio personnel installed SPL-Runt speakers as lateral fills that were localized back to the center with the help of a Shure P4800 signal processor.\n\nThe front of the stage features two BASS 118 subwoofers from Belisle Acoustics.\n\nIn addition, one two-way, passive full-range loudspeaker was employed, as were\n\nfour Yamaha floor monitors. Other key equipment included two Crown CTS2000 and\n\ntwo CTS3000 amplifiers, a Yamaha 01V 96-CA digital mixing console, a Yamaha\n\nAD 824 mic preamp and a selection of Sennheiser microphones.\n\nDave Fortman to Produce New Mudvayne Album\n\nMudvayne has tapped Dave Fortman (Superjoint Ritual, Evanescence) to produce their third album for Epic Records, slated for release this fall. Singer Chad Gray, guitarist Greg Tribbett, bassist Ryan Martinie and drummer Matt McDonough chose Fortman because they felt he could combine the band’s more extreme elements.\n\nBut before heading to The Plant in Sausalito, Calif., Fortman will spend time with Mudvayne in pre-production. “I’ve found that those first few days are the most important when it comes to setting the album’s tone, challenging the band about their goals and fine-tuning the arrangements for maximum emotional impact,” he says.\n\n“We’ve been extremely fortunate to work with some amazing producers,” says Gray. “Garth Richardson captured the band’s raw energy on the first record and David Bottrill gave our music a three-dimensional quality on the second record. For this record, we asked Dave Fortman to produce because we wanted someone who can bring both of those elements together into a sound that’s brutal and beautiful.”\n\nThe upcoming album follows L.D. 50 and The End of All Things to Come—both of which were certified Gold.\n\nFor more info, visit www.mudvayne.com.\n\nManhattan Center Hosts Hip Hop Summit\n\nManhattan Center Productions recently hosted Power 105.1 FM’s 2004 Hip Hop Summit, a series of panels and discussions surrounding the hip hop industry featuring such speakers as producer/Def Jam Records founder Russell Simmons and artist Fat Joe, among others. The facility also donated a full day of recording studio time—with an engineer— to 10 summit attendees.\n\nThe Hip Hop Summit attracted artists, producers, managers, attorneys, label owners and other industry professionals to speak on a variety of topics that affect the industry, including radio airplay, getting signed to a record deal, live show promotions and the overall business of hip hop.\n\nTo find out more about Manhattan Center Productions, visit www.mcstudios.com.\n\nKyle Lehning Leaves Home With Soundelux\n\nAlthough Nashville-based producer Kyle Lehning frequently works in fully stocked high-end studios, he usually arrives with his personal Soundelux E47 and U99 microphones in tow.\n\n“I record lots of overdubs in my own studio, which I built in my home in the Nashville area,” Lehning says. “I also take these mics into the big rooms in Nashville: Seventeen Grand, Cartee Day and Emerald Studios, in particular,—where I like to track, even though they have extensive mic cabinets of their own.”\n\nUpon moving to Nashville from Cairo, Ill., in 1971, Lehning quickly established himself as an in-demand producer, working with such acts as Waylon Jennings, Jimmy Buffett, Ronnie Milsap, Dan Seals and Kinky Friedman, among others. As the former president of Asylum Records, Lehning worked closely with artists such as Mandy Barnett and Randy Travis. He is currently in pre-production on Travis’ next album and has just finished projects for singer/songwriter Joy Lynn White and local Hammond B3 whiz Moe Denham.\n\nFor more information on Soundelux, dist. by Transamerica Audio Group, visit www.transaudiogroup.com.\n\nHal Winer Opens BiCoastal Music\n\nGrammy Award-nominee Hal Winer recently opened BiCoastal Music, a new 1,700-square-foot facility featuring an SSL C200 digital production console.\n\nWiner brought in Dallas-based Russ Berger Design Group to design the comfortable space, located in a converted house on several acres in Ossining, N.Y.

I can align the subwoofers by the time delay or do a simple RTA analysis.\n\n“I can use SpectraFoo to look at the noise floor of my mastering system, see the shape of the dither in real time and make sure the dither generator is operating properly, and even get an indication of the distortion in the system. I’ve used it to measure jitter, as well as distortion.”\n\nMetric Halo’s SpectraFoo incorporates a metering system invented by Katz, called K-System metering. K-System metering offers a standard, integrated approach to monitoring, leveling practices, metering and metadata to bring objectivity back into the perception of loudness. Mixing and mastering processes are standardized through the K-System by aligning monitor calibrations with metering calibrations and making subjective loudness reflect different program material and listening environments.\n\nVisit Katz’s www.digido.com Website for information and technical articles on mastering and digital audio.

The Black Eyed Peas front these high-energy, music video-styled spots, which feature Carlos Santana and a roster of NBA legends like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell and Bill Walton.\n\nEach of the four spots headlines a different member of The Black Eyed Peas’ crew performing custom-composed tracks with a refrain made popular by their song “Let’s Get It Started.” The first spot opens with will.i.am’s rap,”Twenty-four seconds to live and 200 percent is what I gotta give.”Multilayered images of will.i.am., a choir, dancers, Jumbotron game footage, the NBA legends and guitar great Santana appear and disappear, as if peeled away like the layers of an onion.\n\n“Maintaining a sense of realism was key to the effects-heavy production. We didn’t want the spots to look like an assembled bunch of greenscreen shots; it was our goal to make it appear as if everyone was really living and performing together in the space,” Loeb emphasizes. “Architecturally, these spots are a real house of cards: Every element delicately relates to every other element in terms of performance and sharing screen real estate.”\n\nJust as the ESPN campaign arrived at PS 260, the Flatiron District edit house was completing installation of five Avid Media Composer Adrenalines with 2.8 terabytes of Avid Unity centralized storage.\n\nQuickTime previews of these spots and images can be found at www.ps260.com/pr.\n\nNorthern Lights Post Partners With Beastie Boys on New Video\n\nFor the Beastie Boys’ new music video, Ch-Check It Out, off of their forthcoming CD, To the 5 Boroughs, director Nathaniel Hornblower turned to Northern Lights Post (www.northernlightspost.com) and HD editor/effects artist Ross Shain to both finish the clip in HD and handle the extensive visual effects compositing.\n\n“It was important to the Beastie Boys to have a 24p HD master because they are not only interested in the technology, they have interest in preserving their work for years to come,” explains Shain. “The historic Beastie Anthology DVD released in 2000 maximizes the format’s capabilities with unreleased remixes, rare footage and even user-selectable camera angles. If footage from 20 years ago is being re-released, it only makes sense to finish new projects on HD. To their credit, they realized whether it’s for HD broadcasting, creating a PAL version for European broadcast, progressive streaming on the Web or for a future DVD release, having a 16×9 24p master is the way to go.”\n\nThe song “Ch-Check It Out” is a blast from the past, with Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA mugging for the mic and weaving through a rumbling bed of throwback breakdance beats and a distinct old-school feel. In typical Beastie Boys fashion, the video is a bizarre mixture of hip hop humor and visual nonsequitors. The clip begins with a parody of TV show Star Trek with the Beastie Boys dressed as Captain Kirk, Spock and Dr. McCoy, beamed into the streets of Manhattan’s Lower East Side.\n\n“Ch-Check It Out” isn’t the first time Shain has worked with Beastie Boys. In fact, his relationship with the band goes as back to the early ’90s when Shain had his first editing job. “My first job after graduating college was editing a New York public access show called Rappin With the Rickster, which was hosted by Ricky Powell, an old friend and roadie for the Beastie Boys,” recalls Shain. “Through my work for the show, I met Adam and ended up editing ‘Slow and Low,’ a song filmed in concert that was featured on their 1992 video compilation called Skills to Pay the Bills. It’s funny when I look back on it because back then, we were using the most primitive editing systems and now here I am some 12 years later working with the Beastie Boys again, only this time in high def.”\n\nPropellerheads’ ElectroMechanical ReFill Offered Free for Reason Users\n\nPropellerhead Software announced that the ElectroMechanical ReFill loops collection would be included in every Reason package from May 12 forward.

The program was sponsored by the National Association of Record Industry Professionals (NARIP, www.narip.com) and drew attendees from as far away as Arizona, San Diego and San Francisco.\n\n“When the marketplace responds and makes your creative work successful, it’s the best reward and the best indicator of the ability to sustain a career over time,” said Tess Taylor, president of NARIP and panel moderator, introducing the pair. “Damon and Harvey are a bright part of the present and future of our industry, and we thought it would be a good time to talk to them about how they are flourishing outside the major-label model and how they have managed their business to success and profitability.”\n\nDuring the course of the program, The Underdogs offered their take on the industry’s current state. Said Thomas, “I’m optimistic about the future. I think there’s better music in all genres right now and sales are up for the first time in a long time.” His partner, Harvey Mason Jr., echoed that sentiment, saying, “This is a great time to be in music. And the best way to act is to just be grateful if you can be in the music business. This is just such a dream.”\n\nIn a spirited Q&A segment, The Underdogs answered what top producers in the record business look for in an artist: “What helps make great artists is a story in their songs,” said Damon Thomas. “[I look for] someone who can sing in a way that is convincing,” added Harvey Mason Jr, “They need to deliver from the heart so that when they sing, you believe them. It’s not always something you can say, it’s something you can feel.”\n\nThe discussion centered on music’s future, technology and gear, artist development, producing and owning a record label, and more.\n\nMcCartney Remix Album Uses Eventide Clockworks Legacy Plug-Ins\n\nDemonstrating the versatility and ease-of-use of the company’s Clockworks Legacy plug-ins, Eventide announced that accomplished recording, mixing and production engineer Peter McCabe has successfully used the plug-ins on a recently released Paul McCartney remixed track for the Inlaws soundtrack. According to McCabe, the Clockworks Legacy plug-ins are a faithful re-creation of Eventide’s industry-leading hardware products.\n\n“Eventide has done a fantastic job pulling gear from the past that many of us have been familiar with and adjusting them to fit a changing time,” McCabe said. “The hardware products were simple to use back then and Eventide was successfully able to keep their integrity into the new digital domain.”\n\nIn addition to the McCartney track, McCabe has also used the Clockworks Legacy plug-ins on numerous projects spanning across different musical genres, including Alien Ant Farm, Eve6, the Violent Femmes, Mark Wills, Tracy Bird, Billy Currington and the soul rock band Big Red Button. Among the plug-ins that McCabe found most valuable was the Eventide Omnipressor®. “Although I use all of the plug-ins to different degrees, the Omnipressor is my best friend,” McCabe explained. “Whereas other plug-ins tend to be more specific to certain instances, the Omnipressor is such a great compressor in that it can do all your normal stuff but can also do what others can not. This makes it part of your creative process. I find it so versatile that it can be used across the board in different musical forms and applications.”\n\nFor more information about the Omnipressor and other Eventide products, go to the company’s Website at www.eventide.com.\n\nSan Diego-Based Maranatha Chapel Installs TC Electronic EQ Stations\n\nAs soon as the first TC Electronic EQ Stations arrived in the U.S., Dave Shadoan’s production company Sound Image took delivery of two units for Maranatha Chapel in Rancho Bernardo, Calif., located near San Diego. Sound Image configured the two 8-channel EQ Stations to handle both the front-of-house and monitor EQ for the sanctuary.\n\nAccording to Scott Fannon, senior sound engineer at Marantha Chapel, TC-quality processing was the major factor in the decision to go with EQ Station. “After turning them on, it was as if we had installed a new sound system in the sanctuary. The dynamics were better and the overall fidelity was much more open-sounding,” said Fannon. “I heard things in the system I wasn’t able to hear before, from the chest-pounding punch of the bottom end to the sizzle of the cymbal along with the cymbals bell sound.\n\n“The first Sunday the EQ Stations were operational, I had people coming to the sound booth wondering what I had done to make the system sound so good,” he enthused. Another important feature Fannon was looking for in a live EQ was the ease of use. “I think I had the sanctuary, front of house and monitors dialed in within the first 30 minutes,” commented Fannon.\n\nFor more information, go to the TC Electronic Website at www.tcelectronic.com.

Both wires are California Proposition 65-compliant and are lead- and\n\ncadmium-free.\n\n“The Electronic News Gathering wire is designed to run onstage or in the field, for live broadcasts or any other application requiring a high level of confidence and dependable audio/video transmission,” said Cody May, director of engineering at VTG Corporation. “The ENG wire comes standard with four audio pairs and six video coaxial cables that are all color-coded and contained within one jacket. However, clients can also custom-design this cable to have 10 audio and 10 video or any other combination; we can build it to their specification.\n\n“The AES/EBU digital wire was designed to meet the AES3 PHY standard,” continues May. “Manufacturing the cables, plugs and terminating it all in-house provides us with significant advantages. This allows us to control the levels of attenuation, crosstalk, resistance, product life and other metrics detrimental for high-quality audio performance. The end result is a superior cable assembly. The wire is for AES/EBU digital audio applications where you need to connect a console or router to any other source or destination, such as a digital recorder. It is a 24-gauge cable that comes in two, four, six, eight, 12 or 16 pairs, so regardless of the application, we have a cable that meets nearly every requirement.”\n\nFor more information about this product, contact VTG Holdings at info@vtgcorp.com.\n\nMixer/Producer Steve Kempster Uses ATC Monitors\n\nThe list of film credits that scoring mixer/record producer Steve Kempster\n\nhas worked on continues to expand; current projects include Ghost Soldiers,\n\nExorcist: The Beginning and John Water’s indie film, Dirty Shame.\n\nFilms currently running that credit Kempster as mixer include Brother Bear,\n\nThe Haunted Mansion, Mean Girls and New York Minute. Kempster\n\nhas also recently finished producing new songs for the rock band Sky Farm.\n\nKempster’s diverse work as a recording engineer, film score mixer and record producer led him on a quest to find a great mid-field monitor system that would sound great for his film scoring dates, commercial sessions and record production work. Kempster explains: “For my work, I’m a studio on wheels. My racks of gear and I are in a different room from project to project. My dream was a system that could handle a lot of gain with loads of headroom and could still survive the abuse loudspeakers take during a tracking date. I needed something that was tough and great-sounding. The design and idea behind the ATCs is that they are the gold standard. I can depend on them in any situation.” After many auditions, trials and extensive consultations with a number of manufacturers, he purchased an LCR set of ATC SCM100ASL Pro and an CM0.1/15 Pro subwoofer.\n\nKempster continues, “I produced Sky Farm, mixed three films and a number of commercials all on the ATCs and everything has translated beautifully. So my confidence level is extremely high! With the 100s, I find the imaging is breathtaking. The soundfield is so defined and exactly the way it is on the soundstage. I also find the sweet spot is wide both vertically and horizontally, making it great for my clients and artists to also enjoy the sound equally over a fairly wide area. These speakers somehow maintain the same relationship between low, mid and high frequencies at all volumes better than any speaker I’ve worked on. If I was mixing a record, the vocal sound, characteristic and position in the mix stays exactly the same—dead on from quiet to earthshaking room volumes.”\n\nAnother big consideration is the transition from film work to record work. There is a big jump for monitoring because most film score mixing is done through the X Curve, a deliberate roll-off of high frequencies (in the monitor path) to simulate the speaker playback systems in movie theaters. Kempster says, “What ATC is doing now is developing and building multistage X Curve filters for my 100s. Being able to accommodate this change for me and build a filter to the high standards of ATC was a significant reason for me to go with them.”\n\nMixing for film, with much its bigger dynamic range, a speaker’s ability to exhibit detail and resolution are tested. Kempster finds that “in film work, what’s important is the basic resolution of the speaker. How well are you hearing detail? I find the resolution of the ATCs as good as I’ve ever heard. I can track the detail of the foreground information and still hear the quality of the ambient decay. This is crucial to what I do, but even more important is that the ATCs are so damn much fun to listen to!”\n\nATC is distributed in the U.S. by the Transamerica Audio Group.

Dech’s new ATR-102 was remanufactured by Michael Spitz of ATR Services in York, Pa. The vintage recorder was restored to original operating specifications and modified to accept the new 1-inch 2-track recording format.\n\nAfter years of mixing to analog half-inch at other studios, Dech decided to take the plunge and invest in his own machine after calculating the long-term costs. “I added up the costs of the studio time and realized that if I got my own machine, it would pay off long before I die! And that was just on my own work. When I added my clients into that, I realized it could pay off very quickly.”\n\nIn addition to handling the stereo mixdown, the new ATR also serves as an effects device on individual tracks prior to mixing, according to Dech. “Sometimes I will take an individual track out of Pro Tools, record it onto the tape, bounce it back into Pro Tools and I have what I call my magic Neve-like sound without having to buy a big analog console.”\n\nIn addition to mixing and editing, Dech uses his own studio for keyboard recording, sampling and vocal overdubbing. For the latter chores, his other prized piece of gear is a Sony C-800G tube condenser microphone.\n\nIn addition to recording his own music as Infa Red, Dech produces several noted San Francisco Bay Area rap/hip hop/soul artists such as the Conscious Daughters. Several of the CD releases are on his own Roulette Records, a new enterprise not related (except perhaps in spirit) to the defunct East Coast label of the same name. Dech may be contacted at 415/334-8742 or via rouletterecords@earthlink.net.\n\nFor more information on ATR Services, visit www.atrservice.com.\n\nConservatory of Recording Arts & Sciences Chooses Pro Tools|HD\n\nThe Conservatory of Recording Arts & Sciences recently upgraded its Pro Tools\n\nlabs, studios and mobile rigs to Pro Tools|HD. In addition, the school has created\n\neight mobile Pro Tools LE rigs using the new Digi 002 Rack FireWire Interface.\n\n“Having 26 Pro Tools rigs on campus enables us to give our students maximum hands-on time with this world-class digital audio workstation,” says conservatory administrator Kirt Hamm. The Conservatory teaches the Digidesign 101, 201 and 210M programs and certifies all students as Pro Tools Operators. In addition to offering students Digidesign’s Operator certification, the Conservatory offers its own certificate giving students the extra skills necessary to find employment in the audio marketplace.\n\nThe school’s Pro Tools floater rigs are used by students for classes in post-production, commercial production and various tracking sessions in the Conservatory’s eight professional-level recording studios. Students also track live bands to HD as they perform in the 150,000-cubic-foot live sound classroom at the Conservatory’s Gilbert, Ariz., location.\n\nFor more about the Conservatory’s Pro Tools program was go to their Website at www.cras.org.\n\nThe Beatles Arrive at Stax Museum, Memphis\n\nThe Stax Museum of American Soul Music announced that on June 12, 2004,\n\n84 behind-the-scenes, never-before-published photographs of The Beatles will go\n\non display at the museum, marking only the third American venue to host the show,\n\nwhich runs through Sept. 12.

Entitled “Forty\n\nYears of Change” and given by British director John Boorman (Point Blank,\n\nDeliverance, Hope and Glory), the lecture was captured in a three\n\ncamera shoot by the National Film and Television School (NFTS), with HHB’s location\n\nsound recorder handling virtually all the audio tasks.\n\nAs head of sound production at the NFTS, Andrew Boulton explains that the decision to use the Portadrive paid considerable dividends during the shoot and later in post-production. “The Portadrive allowed us to rationalize our equipment setup and produce a much more sophisticated result. We were able to capture both microphone clean feeds and a stereo mix, as well as outputting a separate feed to the cameras. Our students found the Portadrive to be operationally intuitive and the unit’s headphone section allowed us to keep on top of all of the various audio signals. As we synched the Portadrive to house timecode and the session was saved as AES-31 files, the audio recording could be transferred directly into our post systems.”\n\nSpeaking for HHB, Portadrive product manager Paul Isaacs s"
