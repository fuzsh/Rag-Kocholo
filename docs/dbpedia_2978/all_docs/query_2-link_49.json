        "text": "Heavy metal band Mudvayne is playing a “New Game” when it comes to ticket sales as the rockers take their latest album on the road. The New Game Tour kicks off October 28 at the El Paso County Coliseum in El Paso, TX, and continues through December 20 at the House of Blues in Lake Buena Vista, FL.\n\nMudvayne is touring in support of “The New Game,” due in stores November 18. According to a statement released by the band, fans who preorder any physical version of the release will have the opportunity to purchase concert tickets on a first come, first served basis as part of the band’s new “The Album is the Ticket” promotion. Mudvayne partnered with Best Buy and Ticketmaster to create the program.\n\n“Traditionally, over the life cycle of an album, a fan purchases a CD, DVD, tickets to a show and a fan club membership, generally spending over $100 for the experience. For the launch of ‘The New Game,’ fans can experience all of these elements for well under $40,” lead vocalist Chad Gray said in the statement. “We created ‘The Album is the Ticket’ program to give back to you the fans that have supported us for so many years and make it and easy to get what you want.”\n\nAlbums purchased through Best Buy will come with a unique access code for TheAlbumIsTheTicket.com, which will allow fans to purchase concert tickets while supplies last, while also receiving a one-year membership to the official Mudvayne fan club.\n\nDrummer Matt McDonough said the goal of the partnership is “to save our fans money and prevent them from getting taken advantage of by scalpers.” However, in addition to discouraging some secondary ticket sellers, the program could also help boost album sales.\n\nWhile the alt-rockers have never had a huge problem with album sales, earning five Gold certifications from RIAA since 2001, Mudvayne’s program could encourage more casual listeners to buy the album rather than pirating the tracks from the Internet. Earlier in the year, the Associated Press reported that album sales dropped 9.5 percent in 2007, a fact that some published reports by industry analysts have blamed on increased pirating of digital music.\n\nMetal groups 10 Years and Snot will provide support on the 35-date trek, which also includes a special Halloween performance with Puddle of Mudd at the Freaker’s Ball at Nokia Live in Grand Prairie, TX. Other highlights include a November 11 show at the Palladium in Los Angeles, CA, and a December 16 show at the Roseland Ballroom in New York, NY.\n\nMudvayne itinerary:\n\n(Dates subject to change.)"
