        "text": "On Friday, September 8, a sold-out Fiddler’s Green Amphiteatre hosted a night of performances showcasing iconic hip-hop artists and their legacies. Wu-Tang Clan and Run the Jewels, with support from Deltron 3030, brought a hip-hop supergroup extravaganza that captivated fans from start to finish. This was one of our most anticipated shows of the year since its announcement. It did not disappoint.\n\nDeltron 3030\n\n“The year is 3030,” announced a voice as the show began. Deltron 3030 — consisting of Del the Funky Homosapien, Dan the Automator, and Kid Koala — took the stage. The trio performed tracks from their highly influential concept album, Deltron 3030, and its sequel, Event 2. The group’s golden hour time slot created the perfect atmosphere for their dystopian, futuristic sci-fi themes.\n\nWith a setting sun behind them, Del’s raps, Dan’s production, and Kid Koala’s turntable scratches entranced the crowd. The set came to conclusion with an electrifying rendition of Gorillaz mega-hit “Clint Eastwood,” which features two-thirds of the group.\n\nRun The Jewels\n\nAfter a short break, Run The Jewels (rapper Killer Mike and rapper-producer El-P) made their grand entrance. The stage lit up and revealed props of their famous finger gun and fist logo. Then, the duo (with Trackstar, the DJ, providing the beats) began their set with a kinetic performance of “Legend Has It.” This was the most fast-paced set of the night as the duo performed hard-hitting songs spanning their critically acclaimed discography.\n\nAt one point, Run The Jewels announced that 2023 marks their 10-year anniversary and thanked day one fans. In between the raps, there was plenty of banter among the group that kept the tone light and evoked laughter from the audience. The whole performance was a blast and effectively warmed the crowd up for the main act.\n\nWu-Tang Clan\n\n2023 is a landmark year for hip-hop as it marks the 50th anniversary of the genre. This summer especially has given us an opportunity to commemorate the history of hip-hop and its key players. We can’t think of a better way to celebrate than with one of the most monumental groups in rap, Wu-Tang Clan.\n\nWu-Tang Clan was formed in 1992 in Staten Island, New York. The collective consisted of RZA, GZA, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God, Masta Killa, and, until his death in 2004, Ol’ Dirty Bastard (later members and affiliates include Capadonna and Young Dirty Bastard). The group came to prominence with their debut group album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), and their subsequent solo albums. Since then, they have become a cultural juggernaut that has produced numerous albums, comic books, TV shows, and much more.\n\nBy the time Wu-Tang Clan’s band (along with DJ Mathematics) hit the stage, every seat in the amphiteatre was full. After a short introduction by the RZA, the band played “Bring Da Ruckus” and “Da Mystery of Chessboxin’” and the rest of the group joined the stage with their respective verses. Every active member was present except for Method Man, who was unable to make it due to a flight delay.\n\nThe setlist mainly consisted of tracks from their debut album, with the rappers taking turns delivering their verses. They also performed songs from their solo albums such as Raekwon’s “Ice Cream” and GZA’s “4th Chamber.” The group paid tribute to the late ODB with “Shimmy Shimmy Ya” and “Got Your Money,” prominently featuring YDB. The live band added another dimension to RZA’s gritty beats. Every member had their moment to shine before their set ended with the ultimate posse cut, “Triumph.”\n\nA Hip-Hop Supergroup Extravaganza\n\nWu-Tang Clan, Run the Jewels, and Deltron 3030 all put on a spectacle for fans of every hip-hop era. The generation-spanning careers of the groups led to exemplary performances that displayed the lasting legacy of the genre.\n\nPhotos by Joe Pekara"
