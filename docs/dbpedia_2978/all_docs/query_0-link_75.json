        "text": "One of the worst kept secrets has unveiled itself with Nu-Metal mad men Mudvayne announcing their reunion for a string of festival shows across the United States including Inkcarceration Music & Tattoo, Louder Than Life, Aftershock and Welcome to Rockville. The announcement comes with vocalist Chad Gray, guitarist Greg Tribbett, bassist Ryan Martinie and drummer Matthew McDonough back on deck alongside a brand new website with plenty of updates and lyrics to their song ‘Monolith‘ spread all across the social pages:\n\nThese symptoms suggested that our evolution, I suppose, from the animal kingdom into human kingdom itself was catalyzed or triggered by our encounter with these hallucinogenics, and… Yes, we are an ape with a symbiotic relationship to a mushroom, and that has given us self reflection, language, religion, and all the spectrum of effects that flow from these things And one can only wonder how these hallucinogens might effect our future evolution as well They have brought us to this point and as we make our relationship to them conscious, we may be able to take control of our future evolutionary path\n\nThe song came from their breakthrough debut album L.D. 50 which turns the ripe old age of 21 this year (finally legal in the states) so chances are the band may be performing an anniversary set of this album at the aforementioned festivals. Considering last year would have been the 20th Anniversary of the release (before COVID fucked that for everyone) this heightens the fact the reunion would have been based around that celebration.\n\nAlong with the news, a teaser video was unveiled as well and by the looks of things, we may even see some new material dropping.\n\nStay tuned for more via their Facebook and Instagram"
