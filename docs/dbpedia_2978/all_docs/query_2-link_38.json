        "text": "Hailed for their musical prowess, hardcore riffs, and dominating stage show; Mudvayne continues to push the envelope with the video for their second single \"Beautiful and Strange\" off their self-titled album MUDVAYNE. \"Beautiful and Strange\" is directed by Frankie Nasso (ALL THAT REMAINS, HATEBREED, EMMURE, BRIAN \"HEAD\" WELCH) and is the latest installment of three conceptually linked videos that were filmed to promote the band's self-titled album. \"Scream With Me\", the first single off the album saw great success becoming #2 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Chart.\n\nWith the release of the video for \"Beautiful and Strange\" came the unwillingness of networks, and media sources to play the video due to its disturbing and thought provoking imagery that is meant for mature audiences. The video contains sexually explicit acts that take place in a graveyard and some scenes that involve acts of sadism that is part of a storyline that is linked to the other two videos. The exact definition of the video is left to interpretation and flows beautifully with the other two videos that complete the concept. It has been banned from every outlet except for one; the only place where this video can be seen is on the social networking site vampirefreaks.com.\n\nMudvayne has been praised for changing the landscape of metal music through their songwriting and now they continue to broaden that landscape with their provocative new video for \"Beautiful and Strange\". The song is extremely dynamic and is an example of the bands technical abilities as musicians. The release of the third and final video \"Heard It All Before\" is set to premiere next month.\n\nFormed in 1996, the Illinois-based band has been a staple in the music industry and the metal world for close to 15 years. With their willingness to constantly push the envelope, and with their ability to change other people's perspectives on what metal should be, Mudvayne continues to amaze everyone in the world of music. The band is made up of Chad Grey (vocals), Greg Tribbet (guitar), Ryan Martinie (bass), and Matthew McDonough (drums).\n\nRead More News\n\nTags: Mudvayne, Beautiful and Strange, banned\n\nadmin February 26, 2010\n\nMore News\n\nThe Ascent of \"Fear of Water\" Accelerates Interview: Dave Perry\n\nThe Ascent of Fear of Water is in Action\n\nGuns N' Roses Working On New Album With Slash\n\nMarilyn Manson Accuser Gets Trial Date\n\nDARK TRANQUILLITY And AMORPHIS Announce North American Tour"
