        "text": "Mudvayne put on a hell of a show at Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio on August 4, 2023. The band was touring in support of their latest album, “The Paradigm Shift,” and they played a setlist that spanned their entire career.\n\nThe crowd was pumped from the moment the opening band, Butcher Babies, took the stage. Butcher Babies is a female-fronted heavy metal band that is known for their high-energy performances. They got the crowd pumped, moving and energized for the openers and the obvious reason for the gathering, Mudvayne.\n\nNext up was Nonpoint, and these guys hit the stage hard and heavy! Nonpoint, I have seen these guys open for Mudvayne and HELLYEAH when Chad Gray was touring with that band. Nonpoint has a solid fanbase, and when you see their stage presence and intensity, it is no hard to see why!\n\nGWAR, and then Coal Chamber were next up for the growing crowd at Blossom. GWAR is definitely a show that is interactive and messy! If you have never been hosed down at a GWAR show, then you have to ask if you are really a fan of these guys!\n\nCoal Chamber took the stage, and the crowd was at full capacity by now, and when Coal Chamber opened with Loco, the crowd certainly went that direction! Seeing the crowd of all ages just loosing their minds and thrashing to the beats I have been listening to for years, I cannot stress how that never gets old! It never gets any less awesome, seeing so many gathered and just enjoying a night of music that spans generations is certainly exhilarating!\n\nOnce Mudvayne took the stage, the energy level in the venue went through the roof. The band opened with their hit song “Not Falling” and the crowd went wild. Mudvayne played a mix of old and new songs, and they sounded incredible. Their live performance is even better than their recorded music.\n\nLead singer Chad Gray’s vocals were spot-on, and the band’s instrumental prowess was on full display. Bassist Ryan Martinie’s slapping bass lines were particularly impressive. Mudvayne also put on a great visual show, with their elaborate stage set and pyrotechnics.\n\nThe highlight of the show for me was when Mudvayne played their songs “Not Falling, Dig, Determined, World So Cold, and Happy?” These are some of my favorite Mudvayne songs from their library, and the band really brought the sounds to life playing live. The crowd sang along and the energy in the venue was electric.\n\nSomething that was a personal favorite of mine was when Chad spent a large portion of the show leaning into and on to the crowd. Seeing the crowd clammer and fight to reach up and touch him was truly awe inspiring . I cannot imagine what that would feel like, to have thousands of people gather to see and hear you… that has to be a feeling that cannot be put to words.\n\nMudvayne closed their set with their hit song “Happy?” This was the perfect song to end the show on, and it got the crowd pumped up for the encore.\n\nOverall, Mudvayne put on an incredible show at Blossom Music Center. They were tight, energetic, and sounded great. I would definitely recommend seeing them live if you have the chance.\n\nHere is the setlist from the concert:\n\nNot Falling\n\nUnder My Skin\n\nInternal Primates Forever\n\nWorld So Cold\n\nA New Game\n\nSevered\n\nDeath Blooms\n\nFish Out of Water\n\nDull Boy\n\nDetermined\n\nNothing to Gein\n\nDig\n\nHappy?\n\nI would give the show a 5/5 stars. It was an amazing show from start to finish.\n\nNonpoint Website | Facebook | YouTube | Twitter | Instagram | TikTok |\n\nMudvayne Website | Facebook | YouTube | Instagram |\n\n]]>\n\nFreaks On Parade Tour\n\nBlossom Music Center\n\nCuyahoga Falls, OH.\n\nAug. 3, 2022\n\nby Andrew Latshaw\n\nWednesday night, I was privileged to see the Freaks on Parade Tour 2022 at Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. Powerman 5000 kicked off the show and they did not pull any punches! Their set was their greatest hits, and I believe the third song was “When Worlds Collide,” easily their biggest hit and most well-known song in their library. I do not know how Spyder does not age! I have seen this man several times over their career, the man is ageless!\n\nNext up was Static-X, and while I still feel that Wayne cannot be replaced, Edsel Dope A.K.A – Xer0 is doing a wonderful job as the new vocalist to keep their legacy rolling into the current times with this tour. The energy from the crowd when they starting playing was great to experience! They started off with Bled for Days, and while I was snapping as many shots of guys as I could, it was almost impossible not to feel like a kid again! Both times I have photographed Static-X, Wayne had already passed, and Edsel or Xer0 was filling in and I cannot praise him enough for the job he is doing!\n\nBy the time that Static-X had finished their set, Blossom had filled in completely! As I made my way back to the photo pit, the\n\ncurtain was hung to hide the stage for the crew to set up for Mudvayne! I was kept to one side of the stage until the curtain was pulled after being dropped. Seeing Chad come out, and he fist bumped the crew, and the band, and I could see it in his posture and step that everyone there had his back and his appreciation! I stood there for a moment and it was just awesome to see Chad wearing the overalls, with the iconic face paint from the DIG video! Next thing I knew, Chad had his mic in his hands and let out a guttural roar that shook the rafters of the amphitheater as he started their set with DIG! I forgot that Mudvayne added a 5th member last year, and so seeing Marcus Rafferty there positioned behind Gregg. I can say with absolution that his addition to the band was a great choice!\n\nThe night was winding down, and it was time for the headliner, the one and only legend himself: Rob Zombie! I have never seen in concert! This was something you could not have prepared me for! The sights he gave with the background, the monitors, the skull tower for his opening song: The Triumph of the Freak King, it was unlike anything I have ever seen at a show! Not only was I in absolute awe at seeing Rob Zombie, to my left was Piggy D, and to my right was John5, then pedestalled in the back on drums was Ginger Fish! It was a Fanboy’s dream come true!\n\nAs he went into Superbeast, I saw this giant Devil prop with long flowing robes, and pentagram belt buckle floating from one side of the stage to the other. I was so gob-smacked at how astonishing the devil prop was, and then seeing Rob moving as he did, gliding from platform to platform! Then he started grinding his mic stand like a veteran pole dancer! Seeing this man moving at his age so freely and with such vigor, was a sight to behold to say the least! Not only was his performance unhinged in the best and most complimentary of ways, to pull all this off wearing bell bottoms! Not many people can pull off that look, and he does it with breathtaking ease!\n\nWebsite | Facebook | YouTube | Twitter | Instagram |\n\n]]>"
