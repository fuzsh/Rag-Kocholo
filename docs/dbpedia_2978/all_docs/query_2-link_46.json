        "text": "From the rumor mill department: music tour prognosticator and the occasional scourge of the music industry, Wolverine Kills, has shared a new post on Facebook touting that Nu-Metal legends Mudvayne are planning to reunite and tour in 2021. Although no evidence is provided, considering the source, this may very well be true. Wolverine Kills is often stunningly accurate at predicting tours and leaking them early, ahead of announcements. Other than dominating memes in 2019, Mudvayne has been dormant for a decade following the release of their 2009 self-titled release and tour followed. The band formed in 1996 and had their breakthrough in 2000 with their album L.D.50. Vocalist Chad Gray has been the frontman of HELLYEAH, while guitarist Greg Tribbett formed Audiotopsy after departing HELLYEAH in 2014, along with drummer Matthew McDonough. Bassist and internet sensation Ryan Martnie has a Jazz-rock band Soften the Glare. We’d welcome a return by Mudvayne and will update fans on any news that develops from this story.Continue reading →\n\nNorthern Invasion has expanded to two full days – Saturday, May 14 and Sunday, May 15, 2016 at Somerset Amphitheatre in Somerset, WI.

You can watch the clip at this link or below.\n\nThe band recently announced the departure of long-time bassist/vocalist Jeanne Sagan and named her replacement, Aaron “Bubble” Patrick (ex-Devildriver). Kicking off a tour tonight with Devour The Day, Audiotopsy, and Sons Of Texas, the band is on the road supporting their album The Order of Things (Razor & Tie) released earlier in 2015.\n\nAll That Remains tour dates, with Devour The Day, Audiotopsy, and Sons Of Texas\n\nDec 08: Masquerade – Atlanta, GA\n\nDec. 09: The Fillmore – Charlotte, NC\n\nDec 11: Asylum – Portland, ME\n\nDec 12: Webster Theater – Hartford, CT\n\nDec 13: Rams Head Live – Baltimore, MD\n\nDec 14: Gramercy Theater – New York, NY\n\nDec 16: Chameleon Club – Lancaster, PA\n\nDec 17: Machine Shop – Flint, MI\n\nDec 18: Mr. Smalls – Millvale, PA\n\nAll That Remains online\n\nAll That Remains on Facebook\n\nAll That Remains on Twitter\n\nAll That Remains on YouTube\n\n[amazon asin=https://t.e2ma.net/click/gcyrp/0j9s2b/kfrrsg&template=iframe image1]\n\nI’ll admit it. I’m one of those dudes who would like to have another Mudvayne album. I really would. I’d actually settle for a final tour just to get a proper sense of closure for that band. But I’ll just keep waiting.\n\nIn the meantime though, the artists formerly known as Mudvayne, particularly guitarist Greg Tribbett, have stayed busy in a variety of bands. Tribbett was doing time with vocalist Chad Gray in the musically inferior Vinnie Paul project Hellyeah until he walked in 2013. Wasting little time he recruited Mudvayne drummer Matt McDonough, Skrape singer Billy Keeton and bassist Perry Stern for a “progressive hard rock” act dubbed Audiotopsy. I’m not sure about the progressive tag, but the music on Natural Causes (Napalm) tends to fluctuate from alternative metal to post-grunge.\n\nOn paper the idea of Tribbett and McDonough working together again seems awesome, but the angular and off-kilter Mudvayne rhythms are nowhere to be found here. The closest we get to those days is on ‘Distorted’ and ‘Darken the Rainbow,’ but even then it’s more Lost and Found rather than L.D. 50. And that’s fine because this is a new band and they’re capable of producing their own interesting moments. The best bits on Natural Causes are the songs more in line with grunge (God, I hate that word) like ‘LYLAB’ and ‘The Calling.’ Then you have the strongest track ‘Swim’ which also happens to be the closest to mellow.\n\nNatural Causes starts to show its cracks with songs like ‘Headshot’ and ‘Burn the Sky’ as they feel more like placeholders as opposed to fleshed out compositions. It could have been a noteworthy EP as opposed to a full length that’s been padded out with ideas that haven’t been fully realized. Do we really need interlude ‘H20’ smack in the middle of the album or the three-minute title track outro? Who does outros?\n\nMaybe we can chalk it up to the short gestation period between band formation and album release. These are the growing pains that lead to musical polish. It’s fine, I can wait.\n\n5.5/10\n\nHANSEL LOPEZ"
