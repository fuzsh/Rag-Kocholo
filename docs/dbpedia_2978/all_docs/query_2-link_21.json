        "text": "The members of the quartet Mudvayne are toning down their visual shock value - giving up heavy makeup and \"out of this world\" costuming (for the moment anyway).\n\nSome may remember the band's appearance at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, where the members accepted the first MTV2 award wearing blood-spattered tuxedos and faux bullet holes in their foreheads.\n\nAlthough the band's November 2002 release, The End of All Things to Come, displayed vocalist Chud (Chad Gray), guitarist Guug (Greg Tribbett), bassist Ru-D (Ryan Martinie) and drummer Spug (Matt McDonough) dressed as aliens - Mr. Gray said the costuming was just for the photo shoot.\n\n\"A lot of people think that Mudvayne has a look for a record,\" Mr. Gray explained during a phone interview from Portland, Maine. But \"we've changed our looks a hundred times.\" The band now is wearing very little makeup, Mr. Gray said. The group is sick of being put into the box of \"shock rock\" because of costuming, he said.\n\n\"The look doesn't have any affiliation to the band - other than that we wanted to add another element of visual stimulation to our live performance. We don't interview in it, we don't do television interviews in it. We're very careful about what we do wearing makeup.\"\n\nThe band's music has been compared to new metal bands, he said, adding that there's \"nothing new about our band.\"\n\n\"We've been around for years,\" Mr. Gray said. \"To compare us with a kid who's been playing guitar for five years and got lucky getting a deal to people (who) have been playing their instruments for 20 years - it just isn't fair to us to be lumped into that. That's probably why we haven't sold 18 billion records, because we're not always an easy listen. Art's not always easy.\"\n\nNeither is listening to Mudvayne. But if you're not up the challenge, don't bother showing up at the concert, Mr. Gray said.\n\n\"We don't want the cattle. We want people who want to take time and try to do the work and try to do things to help themselves.\"\n\nMr. Gray spent four months of intense meditation \"dissecting\" himself to write material for The End of All Things to Come.\n\n\"There're a lot of things on this record that I touched on in trying to reflect and realize myself as a human and just trying to understand my potential as a human being,\" he said.\n\nMudvayne recorded the 12-track album with producer David Bottrill (King Crimson, Tool, Peter Gabriel) at Pachyderm Studios in Minneapolis, Minn., where Nirvana's In Utero was recorded.\n\nMudvayne began in Peoria, Ill., in 1996 and signed with Epic Records in 1999, releasing its debut, L.D. 5.0, in 2000. A tour with Disturbed and a slot in Ozzfest 2001 followed. L.D. 5.0 was certified gold and the band won the first ever MTV2 Video Award in September 2001.\n\nFor more on Mudvayne, log on to www.mudvayne.com."
