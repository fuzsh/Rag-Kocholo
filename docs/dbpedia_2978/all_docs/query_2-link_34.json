        "text": "Mudvayne have officially announced their long-awaited reunion plans, which will find them performing at several festivals scheduled for later this year. Among their confirmed plans are the following festivals:\n\n‘Inkcarceration Festival‘ (September 10th – 12th in Mansfield, OH)\n\n‘Louder Than Life‘ (September 23rd – 26th in Louisville, KY)\n\n‘Aftershock Festival‘ (October 07th – 10th in Sacramento, CA)\n\n‘Welcome To Rockville‘ (November 11th – 14th in Daytona Beach, FL)\n\nThe band said in a statement:\n\n“These symptoms suggested that our evolution, I suppose, from the animal kingdom into human kingdom itself was catalyzed or triggered by our encounter with these hallucinogenics, and… Yes, we are an ape with a symbiotic relationship to a mushroom, and that has given us self reflection, language, religion, and all the spectrum of effects that flow from these things And one can only wonder how these hallucinogens might effect our future evolution as well They have brought us to this point and as we make our relationship to them conscious, we may be able to take control of our future evolutionary path\n\n~~ MudDvAyNe 2021 ~~”"
