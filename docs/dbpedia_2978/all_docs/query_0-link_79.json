And this time, it doesn’t suck\n\nThe band went on hiatus in 2010, a year after the release of their self-titled fifth studio album. Since then, vocalist Chad Gray has been fronting the band Hellyeah, of which Mudvayne guitarist Greg Tribbett is a former member.\n\nThe band are gearing up to play at US festivals Inkcarceration in Ohio, Louder Than Life in Kentucky, Aftershock in California and Welcome To Rockville in Florida, all organised by Danny Wimmers Presents. The festivals are currently scheduled between September and November.\n\nMudvayne, who formed in 1996 and is made up of Chad Gray (vocals), Greg Tribbett (guitar, backing vocals), Matthew McDonough (drums, synthesizer) and Ryan Martinie (bass), took to Instagram yesterday (July 26) to share the first video footage from the rehearsal sessions for the upcoming gigs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can watch the rehearsal session below:\n\nDanny Wimmers said in a recent statement that Mudvayne were one of the most requested acts for the upcoming festivals and that they have “been working for years to make this happen”.\n\nRecommended\n\n“We sat down for dinner with Mudvayne, their lawyer Eric German, manager Diony Sepulveda and agent Ryan Harlacher – the band hadn’t even been in the same room together for 10 years – and pleaded our case for why the time was right for this to happen,” Wimmers said.\n\n“We were hoping to announce this in 2020, we’re fortunate enough to be able to do it in 2021, and DWP is super pumped to have Mudvayne exclusively at all four of our festivals this year.”\n\nWimmers said they initially intended to announce the shows in 2020. A year prior to that, bassist Ryan Martinie discussed a possible reunion during an interview with Metal Sucks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Man, there’s always talk. Which is a good thing. I’m fortunate enough that the thing that we made together still garners some kind of interest from our fans and for those people who may have wanted to see us and never got to. There’s still kind of the ‘man, are they gonna do it?’,” Martinie said."
