        "text": "Matt McDonough\n\nCoastal Carolina University\n\nMatthew McDonough is a Senior Lecturer of history at Coastal Carolina University. He specializes in American military history, American expansionism and the U.S. Civil War. After earning his PhD in history from Kansas State University he has won several teaching awards for his innovative assignments and teaching style. He spent a year as a Visiting Assistant Professor of History at the United States Military Academy at West Point teaching the history of the military art to senior cadets. As a Senior Instructor at CCU, he often teaches more than 10 courses a year including American Military History, the American Civil War and Reconstruction, American Frontier, the Golden Age of Piracy and both sections of the American history survey. He is fascinated by the intersection of popular culture, gaming and military history and his currently working on several articles that pertain to pedagogy.\n\nThe purpose of this course is to familiarize you with the major events and people associated with the Civil War. We shall discuss many of the debates and problems that surrounded this momentous event such as the myth of the lost cause and reconstruction. In addition you shall learn write book reviews and become aware of some of the relevant historical literature. The Civil War permeated into every facet of society and I have structured this course to be as broad as possible without leaving out the critical facts. Consequently, we shall cover not only the important battles and leaders but also learn what life was like for everyday soldiers and civilians and for society in general.\n\nThis will not be your traditional military history. While we will cover important wars, battles and commanders we shall also discuss the role of the home front, the everyday soldier and concepts such as gender and republicanism."
