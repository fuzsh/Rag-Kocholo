The band formed in 1996 before disbanding in 2010 and are known for their songs “Dig,” “Not Falling,” and “Happy?”, as well as for the iconic “Brr Brr Deng” memes. After more than a decade of wondering if the band would ever reform, we finally have our answer. It’s a resounding yes.​\n\nThe band was first formed in 1996 in Peoria, Illinois, and released their debut EP Kill, I Oughta in 1997, as well as their debut album, L.D. 50 in August of 2000, which contained the band’s most popular song to date, “Dig”. “Dig” won MTV2’s music awards, as well as receiving significant radio play. Mudvayne began getting recognition for their music, but also their looks, which included unique uniforms and masks that featured distinct face and body paint."
