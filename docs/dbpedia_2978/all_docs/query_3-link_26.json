        "text": "Interview with Matt McDonough of Mudvayne – December 2009\n\nBy: Ian Macdonald\n\nPics: Tracy Ketcher\n\nSDM: The New Game was released in 2008 and the latest Self-Titled release in 2009. Looking back to the album prior to New Game, it was Lost and Found in 2005. Can you tell us about the latest release coming only a year after it’s predecessor, as opposed to a three year gap between recordings? What was the difference, or motivation this time around?\n\nMatt: The band, after discussing our future plans with management, decided to write and record two separate albums back to back. The creative process for both albums was separate, but after taking a short break from recording The New Game; we proceeded directly into writing for our self-titled release.\n\nSDM: How has the new release been received by Mudvayne fans, old and new?\n\nMatt: It’s hard to say, since the album was just released. The response seems positive. In general, I think it’s safe to assume you can please most fans but not everyone. I see our albums as individual entities. Each one has it’s own individual identity and spirit. Not everyone is going to like the twists and turns between these different styles.\n\nSDM: Can you tell us a bit about how you record? Any rituals, practice routines, use of triggers/modules etc…\n\nMatt: I can’t think of any \"rituals\" to mention. I’m pretty methodical, and am fortunate to have worked with great producers and engineers that have allowed me direct access to participating in the recording process. I enjoy the engineering, so I try to pay attention and learn as much as I can. I’m also a bit of a computer geek, so all aspects of editing intrigue me.\n\nThe computer interest aside, I’m a purist when it comes to my drum tones. I use a v-drum pad for very sparing percussion, but overall, drum and cymbal tones are all natural and generated in real time in the studio, exclusive to the session.\n\nSDM: A lot of people complain about using Ahead sticks, due to the material and weight. What do you like about them, and what advantage do they give you over wood sticks?\n\nMatt: I’m not aware of complaints about Ahead sticks. Personally, I don’t believe I would be able to play any longer (due to wrist/elbow injuries) if it weren’t for Ahead sticks. The material and hollow construction allow distribution of impact energy. Consequently, making them very comfortable to play with. Also, being a machined metal stick affords consistent manufacturing. Every stick is identical.\n\nSDM: How long have you been working with Pearl Drums? Were there any others you endorsed before Pearl? What can you say about your kit and how it sounds raw in the studio?\n\nMatt: I’ve been Pearl endorsed since the early 2000’s. I began with a hardware endorsement that complimented an endorsement I had with Ayotte. I eventually moved completely to Pearl.\n\nI think the kit sounds speak for themselves. As I mentioned earlier, the tones on Mudvayne records are as is. We don’t layer other tones from other recordings, but remain within the session we are recording in. What you hear is all there is.\n\nSDM: What other kinds of music do you listen to for inspiration? If any extreme metal is part of your answer, who are some of the \"sickest\" drummers you dig?\n\nMatt: I’m an electronic music fan predominantly. But I make it a habit to focus on music-listening in general. I have a \"reference\" playlist on my ipod that I’m daily maintaining and using for study. It’s about as eclectic as you can get. Right now it includes: Autechre, The Beatles, Wendy Carlos, The Clash, Neil Diamond, Bob Dylan, Iron Maiden, The J.Geils Band, Kraftwerk, Matmos, Meshuggah, Gary Numan, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Rammstein, Rush and The Thompson Twins.\n\nSDM: Peoria, Illinois (general area) has had quite a few amazing metal bands come from there. Would you still say you were an innovator in \"Math-Metal\" and looking back, would you entertain other genre titles these days, like: Death-core, Grind-core and agree that each band should be labeled in such a manner? or is that just overdone now?\n\nMatt: I honestly don’t know what \"math metal\" is. I made a joke early on in Mudvayne’s career that we used an abacus in writing. It seems I should be careful making jokes in interviews. I don’t really see Mudvayne as an innovator in anything. We’ve digested and reinvented what we most love about music and strive to enjoy our creative process. If something new happens along the way, it’s an accident.\n\nSDM: What kind of response did you experience with the Frequency Response solo album? Will there be more?\n\nMatt: I appreciate being asked about my solo work! I haven’t gotten much feedback from my solo releases. Most people that are paying attention are family and friends, people that already know I like to goof around with computers!\n\nYeah, my solo work (MjDawn) and AtmoWorks (distribution label) are ongoing projects for me. Along with Frequency Response, I’ve released a track on our compilation album titled AtmoWorks Presents: Compiled. We’re getting ready to release another compilation in the spring that I will contribute to. Along with releases as \"MjDawn\", I have a project with my co-label owner called miKroNaught. We’ve released an EP called Neutino_2.1. We are working on a current project called Audiotopsy and also producing a Chicago local band called Camera. And on top of all this, I’m working on another solo project called ultrAtheist, that is a doom style project inspired by Swans.\n\nSDM: What would some of your characteristics be that you can attribute to the longevity both you, and the band have experienced? What can others do to attempt the same longevity in music?\n\nMatt: I’ve always said you should not have expectations. They can be unrealistic and not bound to reality. I’ve always been interested in what’s happening in a creative moment. Trying to control the outcome of these experiences separates you from it’s availability. What becomes available is truth and I think that’s pretty special.\n\nSDM: What’s next for you in 2010?\n\nMatt: 2010 is going to be a lot of experimenting with AtmoWorks and my solo projects. I’m still building my studio, so the consequent music is evolving with my gear and knowledge. I’m not even really sure where the journey is going."
