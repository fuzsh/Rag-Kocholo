        "text": "RENO, Nev. (March 21, 2023) – Experimental metal group Mudvayne will be joined by Coal Chamber, GWAR, Nonpoint and Butcher Babies for The Psychotherapy Session at Grand Sierra Resort and Casino (GSR) on Sunday, August 20, 2023 at 5:30 p.m.\n\nTickets for Mudvayne: The Psychotherapy Sessions at GSR go on sale Friday, March 24 at 10 a.m. PT and start at $69.50, plus additional taxes and fees. Infinity Rewards members will have access to presale beginning Thursday, March 23 from 10 a.m. PT through 10 p.m. PT. For more information or to purchase tickets, visit grandsierraresort.com or call 1-800-648-3568.\n\nMudvayne is an American metal band known for their sonic experimentation, face and body paint, masks and uniforms, the band has sold over six million records worldwide, including nearly three million in the United States. The group consists of guitarist Greg Tribbett, drummer Matthew McDonough, lead vocalist Chad Gray, and bassist Ryan Martinie. The band became popular in the late-1990s and found success with the single \"Dig\" from their debut album “L.D. 50.” The group began experimenting with their sound starting with their second album, “End of All Things to Come” by including elements of thrash metal, death metal and jazz. They found the most success with their 2005 release “Lost and Found,” which debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and has since gone on to sell over one million copies thanks to support from singles like “Happy?” and “Fall into Sleep.” After releasing two more albums and relentless touring, Mudvayne went on hiatus in 2010. They reunited in 2021 and continue to perform live.\n\nHailing from Los Angeles, Coal Chamber formed in 1993 and went on to become one of the most acclaimed nu-metal bands, exploring the darker side of the genre with a pronounced Goth influence as opposed to hip-hop. The group went on to release four albums including their self-titled debut in 1997, “Chamber Music” two years later, “Dark Days” in 2002 and “Rivals” in 2015.\n\nFormed in Virginia in 1984, GWAR developed an early following with their costumed, prop-filled, spectacle-heavy take on thrash metal. Simultaneously embracing and poking fun at the genre's extremes, the band struck a chord with audiences looking to indulge in metal's excesses without taking them too seriously. Their 1988 debut “Hell-O” was a huge hit in Germany, with subsequent albums like “Carnival of Chaos” and “We Kill Everything” enjoying considerable success in the U.S. Over the course of their career, GWAR have packed top venues with their extravagant performances.\n\nNonpoint formed in Fort Lauderdale in 1997 and quickly made a splash on the budding South Florida metal scene with their intense sound and captivating stage presence. After self-releasing their first two albums, the band made their major label debut in 2000 with “Statement,” which put them on the national radar, earning them their first charting single and drawing them out for touring alongside bigger rock acts like Fuel and Taproot. In 2002, the band released “Development,” an acclaimed album that landed at No. 52 on the Billboard 200 and led to tour dates with Filter, Papa Roach and Sunset Black. In 2014, Nonpoint scored their highest position yet when their eighth studio album “The Return” peaked at No. 3 on Billboard's alternative chart. Since then they've continued to wow fans with electrifying performances across the country.\n\nButcher Babies is an American groove metal band from Los Angeles, consisting of frontwomen Heidi Shepherd and Carla Harvey, guitarist Henry Flury, bassist Ricky Bonazza, and drummer Chase Brickenden. Their debut album, “Goliath” sold 3,300 copies in the U.S. during its first week of release and charted at No. 3 on the Billboard Heatseeker chart and No. 112 on the Billboard 200. Doors open at 4:30 p.m."
