Trivia[]

Fantasque, the fastest destroyer in the history. She was even reclassified as cruiser after modification, and that's why she needs CRUISER CORES instead of destroyer cores to remodel in game.

One more thing is that, remodeled Fantasque has middle range like other CLs.

Although she has a very high evasion, Fantasque's armor is too weak to protect her so she usually gets damaged (cuz you run too fast!). Low amounts of armor increased her speed.

Some researches shows that armor DOES effect with the actual evasion rate, therefore one of the useful way to prevent Fantasque getting hurt is to equip her a light armor. (In fact is it to stop her runs too fast and falls)

Despite being a destroyer, Fantasque is usually constructed with aircraft carrier recipes (player: WTF where does my bauxite go).
