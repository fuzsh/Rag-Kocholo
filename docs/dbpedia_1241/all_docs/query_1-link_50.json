        "text": "have been since the fall of France,\n\nfighting under General de Gaulle.\n\nActually all French ships not scut-\n\ntled at Toulon are now in Allied\n\nhands.\n\nVice-Admiral Fenard said that the\n\nbattleship Jean Bart, smashed at\n\nCasablanca during the Allied landing\n\nin North Africa, could be salvaged,\n\nbut it was improbable that she would\n\nfight in this war because of the im-\n\npracticability of manufacturing 15in\n\nguns.\n\nStorm\n\nThe Richelieu and the ships with\n\nher reached port after having dodged\n\nsubmarines and ridden out the worst\n\nAtlantic storm the crews had experi-\n\nenced.\n\nOnly three of the Richelieu's en-\n\ngines were working, and at the stern\n\na temporary hull of big timbers had\n\nbeen built over the 40ft. rent in the\n\nside made by British depth charges\n\nand torpedoes at Dakar in 1940.\n\nUnited States destroyers es-\n\ncorted the Richelieu as she was\n\nforced by the storm to travel at\n\na slow speed.\n\nThe crew were very excited and\n\nhappy when they saw the Statue of\n\nLiberty loom up through a heavy\n\nfog at the journey's end.\n\nCaptain Marcel Deramond said that\n\ntheir coming would show the Ameri\n\ncan people that France still has a\n\nnavy and sailors anxious and eager\n\nto fight.\n\nOn the fifth day out the radio\n\nwarned that submarines were dead\n\nahead. .\n\n'We abruptly, and temporarily\n\nchanged our course and saw no trace\n\nof the enemy,' said Captain Dera-\n\nmond.\n\nBearn\n\nA United Press correspondent ac-\n\ncompanying the Richelieu says that\n\nthe transfer is the first positive step\n\nto outfit a major unit of the French\n\nNavy for use against the enemy.\n\nThe eighteen-ktnot carrier Bearn\n\nwhich is at Martinique may be re-\n\nfitted in the United States.\n\nThe refitting in all cases will\n\nnecessitate the removal of the\n\nelegant woodwork which adorns\n\nall French ships.\n\nRichelieu is 794ft. long, 'has\n\neight 15in. guns, 15 6 -in. guns and\n\n36 anti-aircraft guns. She has\n\nfour aircraft, carries a crew of\n\n1670.\n\nCompleted in 1940 she was then\n\nthe most modern and formidable\n\ncapital ship in the- world.\n\nOn July 11, 1940, Prime Minister\n\nChurchill announcing the damaging\n\nof the ship at Dakar, said that the\n\nCabinet 'with aching hearts but\n\nwith clear vision unanimously felt\n\nbound to take measures to prevent\n\nthe French fleet from felling into\n\nGerman hands.'\n\nFour alternatives were offered to\n\nthe French admirals and were re-\n\njected:\n\n1. That the ships should sail to a\n\nBritish port with a guarantee that\n\nthe crews would be repatriated;\n\n2. That they sail to the French\n\nWest Indies, be demilitarised or en-\n\ntrusted to U.S.A.;\n\n3. That they be demilitarised at\n\nDakar, or\n\n4. That they be sunk by the\n\nFrench themselves."
