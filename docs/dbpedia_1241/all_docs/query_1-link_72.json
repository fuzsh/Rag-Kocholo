        "text": "In 2003, the animated French feature “The Triplets of Belleville” swept the globe, raking up dozens of awards and nominations, not to mention the hearts of countless admirers along the way.\n\nNow experience the live cinema-concert recreation of the classic animated French film “The Triplets of Belleville” on Thursday, Oct. 19, presented by the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s Alys Stephens Performing Arts Center. The evening features Le Terrible Orchestre de Belleville with composer-conductor Benoît Charest.\n\nMuch of the joie de vivre of the film came from the Oscar-nominated score by Charest, which grabbed audiences by the ears and dragged them into the streets of 1920s Paris. Charest will recreate the original score live as the film is beamed onto the big screen. Enjoy the misadventures of a kidnapped Tour de France cyclist, his would-be rescuer grandmother and the titular-trio of larger-than-life divas, all accompanied by the speakeasy-slick sounds of a live orchestra."
