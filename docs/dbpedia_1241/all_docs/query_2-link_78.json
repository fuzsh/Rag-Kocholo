He met with officers and crew, went through a simulation exercise and was given a tour.\n\nAfter the visit he tweeted: “At Ile Longue base of nuclear submarines, launching equipment. France has a deterrent force, a guarantee of peace.”\n\nFrance will be the only EU country to possess nuclear weapons after Britain leaves the bloc in 2019.\n\nRead: Police foil Macron assassination attempt\n\nLe Terrible, which submerges to a depth of 500 meters, is the first submarine entirely mapped out through computer assisted design, and cost about $1.72 billion."
