She was named for the 18th century Governor-General of French India Joseph François Dupleix.\n\nShe was commissioned on 7 July 1932 and based in Toulon, as part of the 1st light division of the 1st squadron. In 1937, she was completely refitted. From 14 October 1939 to the end of January 1940, along with the cruiser Algérie, she was part of Force X based in Dakar. While on patrol in the Atlantic with the destroyers, Le Fantasque and Le Terrible, she intercepted and captured the German freighter Santa Fé, on 25 October 1939, On 14 June 1940, Dupleix participated in the French raid on Genoa, with sister ships Foch and Colbert.\n\nAfter the surrender, Dupleix remained with the Vichy Fleet at Toulon. When the Germans occupied Vichy France, she was scuttled, in the Scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon. German officers, attempting to take the ship intact, rushed aboard and forced the French crew below decks, and successfully located and closed the sea valves. The ship's captain, capitaine de vaisseau Moreau, ordered the scuttling charges in the main turrets to be lit with shortened fuses and when they exploded and fires took hold, Moreau ordered the final evacuation. French and Germans aboard all fled the vessel. Explosions of the ship's torpedo stores destroyed the vessel, which burned for 10 days.\n\nRefloated in two sections on 3 July 1943 by Italian salvage teams; the two halves were hit by bomb on 11 March 44, the bow sinking immediately and the stern on the 15th. The remains were broken up in situ in 1951.\n\nReferences[]\n\nJordan, John; Moulin, Jean (2013). French Cruisers 1922-1956. Seaforth Publications.\n\nSaibène, Marc (n.d.).
