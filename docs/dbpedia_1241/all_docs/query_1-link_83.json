        "text": "The test was preformed following the submarine’s complex overhaul / mid-life update. The firing took place off Britany in Western France. As usual, the M51 SLBM was tracked throughout its flight phase by radars and by the missile range instrumentation ship Monge (A601).\n\nAccording to an official statement: “The missile was monitored throughout its flight phase by the means of DGA Essais de Missiles and those of the Monge vessel The fallout zone is located in the North Atlantic several hundred kilometers from any coast. This test was carried out without a nuclear warhead and in strict compliance with France’s international commitments. This firing validates the operational capability of the SSBN Le Terrible’s global weapons system and once again demonstrates the excellence of the high technology that French industries are implementing in this field.”\n\n“The success of this launch confirms France’s ability to implement its deterrent weapon system, the credibility of the SSBN and the efficiency of its crew. The Navy ensures the permanence of oceanic nuclear deterrence by deploying at least 1 SSBN without interruption since 1972.”\n\nAdmiral Vandier, Chief of Staff of the French Navy\n\nAs always, Navigational Warnings for the related hazard zones in the Atlantic were published a few days ahead, indicated that a French test was coming:\n\nThe previous two M51 tests were conducted in April 2021 (from a land based test site) and June 2020 (from a submarine). Le Terrible is the fourth final submarine in the Le Triomphant-class. The test conducted last week was likely related to the upgrade of the submarine (in relation to its complex overhaul) so that it may deploy the new “TNO” warhead.\n\nAbout the Triomphant-class SSBN\n\nThe Le Triomphant-class is a class of four nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBN) of the French Navy built by DCNS (now known as Naval group). They are known in French as Sous-Marin Nucléaire Lanceur d’Engins de Nouvelle Génération – SNLE NG. They replaced the Le Redoutable-class from 1997. They were commissioned in 1997, 1999, 2004 and 2010.\n\nThese submarines are fitted with 16 submarine-launched ballistic missile launching tubes each and are equipped with M51 ballistic missiles but also traditional armament such as torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, Exocet. Le Terrible, last ship of the class which was commissioned in 2010, was fitted with M51 capability from its construction. The other three SSBNs originally deployed M45 missiles and were upgraded for the new M51 missile by DCNS\n\nTriomphant-class SSBNs are dedicated to the French nuclear deterrent mission. As such, at least one of the SSBN is always deployed at sea. The fleet of 4 SSBNs ensures that 3 can be maintained in the operational cycle and continuously guarantee there is at least one SSBN at sea during peacetime.\n\nLe Triomphant-class main specifications:\n\nDisplacement: 12 640 tonnes surfaced; 14 200 tonnes submerged\n\nLength: 138 m\n\nBeam: 12.5 m\n\nDepth: <300 m\n\nPropulsion: nuclear reactor K15, turboreductor system, two diesel-powered generators SEMT Pielstick auxiliaries\n\nNuclear weapons: 16 ballistic missiles M51\n\nTraditional weapons: four 533 mm torpedo tubes for F17 torpedoes and Exocet SM39 anti-ship missiles\n\nCrew : 110\n\nAbout M51 SLBM\n\nThe M51 is the new generation intercontinental SLBM which started replacing the M45 in 2010. Each missile carries six to ten independently targetable (MIRV or Multiple Independently targeted Reentry Vehicle) TN 75 thermonuclear warheads. TN 75 are being replaced with the new Tête nucléaire océanique (TNO or oceanic nuclear warhead) warheads since 2015. These new warheads are reported to be maneuverable (MARV or Maneuverable Re-entry Vehicle) in order to avoid potential ballistic defenses. The TNO has a yield that is estimated to be greater than or equal to the yield of the TN 75 warhead, 150 kilotons of TNT (kt) with a CEP (circular error probability) of 150 meters.\n\nThe three-stage engine of the M51 is directly derived from the solid propellant boosters of the European Ariane 5 space rocket. Open source data indicates an M51 weight of 52,000 kg, a length of 12.0 m and a diameter of 2.3 m. M51 operational range is reported to be 8,000 to 10,000 km with a speed of Mach 25.\n\nThe first test launch of an M51 ballistic missile was successfully carried out at Centre d’essais de lancement de missiles (CELM) in Biscarosse, France, on November 9, 2006. The sixth missile test carried out on May 5, 2013, ended in failure. The latest M51 tests in September 2015, July 2016, June 2020 and April 2021 were all successful."
