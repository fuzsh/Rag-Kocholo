        "text": "As much as I reveled in the preciousness of a rare meal out during the depths of COVID, it feels so so good to be going to restaurants on the regular again (the last update was hybrid takeout/dine-in sitch, but we’re officially back in the full throttle “for here” zone). Looking back on the last six months of discovering new places to eat (24 of ‘em!), I’m touched by the memories and moments that come along with each – double dates, celebrations, spontaneous outings, and intimate catch-ups. I hope you’re back in the swing of things yourselves, and if not, then perhaps these suggestions will be the oomph you need to get back out there. If not, I’ve got a whopping 298 more for you to scope out over on the big map (which means this lil list of mine is now over 300 recs strong!). This time around, we’re heading into IYKYK territory with Rong’s, La Parilla Loca, Khan Toke, and Swanson Berry Farm. But we’re also #stayingrelevant with plenty of Mission hotspots (Good Good Culture Club, Shuggie’s Trash Pie + Natural Wine, Mijoté, The Morris, Penny Roma, Handroll Project) and new projects from old favorites (Loquat, from the folks that brought you The Mill, Good Good Culture Club from the geniuses at Liholiho Yacht Club, Penny Roma from the Flour + Water fam, and Handroll Project from the ju-ni masterminds). Raw seafood seems to be having a moment with newcomers Le Fantastique, Penny Roma, Handroll Project, and Mijoté putting it front and center on their menus. Pandemic projects got permanent homes in Fruitvale (Tacos El Ultimo Baile) and in Emeryville (Good To Eat Dumplings), and I experienced a whole new level of “California Cuisine” at Chez Panisse (the OG!), Harbor House, and Mijoté. As always, there are more Richmond additions, including spots that confirm I was on the early leg of the area’s gentrification (hello, Laundromat and The Coffee Movement). But I remain grateful for plenty of lowkey institutions sticking it out here (this time, Rong’s, Khan Toke, and HoDaLa). As much as I love my life in the fog, East Bay food adventures have been plentiful, including a self-led taco crawl that resulted in three new faves (vampiros tacos at Tacos El Ultimo Baile, tacos de cabeza at El Tacostao, and asado at La Parilla Loca). And finally, while dinner tends to get the spotlight, some new breakfast spots were added to the rotation (pancakes at Glen Park Cafe, bourekas at Loquat, bagels at Laundromat). We’re back baby!!\n\n18. Rong's\n\nCuisine: Chinese\n\nHood: Outer Richmond\n\nDining Style: Table Service\n\nPrice: $$\n\nOccasion: Foggy weeknight dinner\n\nDon’t Miss The: Pan-Fried Flat Noodle\n\nWe learned about this restaurant thanks to the SF Chronicle's interactive map of regional Chinese food in the Bay Area. Rong's makes Jiangnan cuisine (it actually used to be called Jiangnan Cuisine before Rong bought the business and renamed it after herself). While I haven't found a dish I didn't love to the point of overeating, my two standbys are the Lion's Head Meatball and Homemade Pan-Fried Flat Noodle. The meatball weighs in at about one pound, and is fluffy and caramelized, swimming in a sweet and salty soy sauce. The noodles appear simple, but are probably the top food item in SF that I crave. They're chewy on the inside with splotches of crispiness where they frizzled in a hot pan and then topped with Chinese cauliflower and chicken breast and doused in an umami-packed gravy. Just trust me when I tell you, you can't miss this place.\n\nhttps://www.rongssf.com/?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=website | 3420 Balboa St, San Francisco, CA 94121"
