        "text": "January 12, 2023\n\nIn this short update, we’re making a bunch of changes to gameplay, including revamps for the French destroyer and Italian cruiser Tech Trees.\n\nFrench Destroyers\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the changes to French destroyers. In the past, these ships have acted primarily as torpedo destroyers due to a combination of factors like the Go All Out skill, their fast torpedo reload, and their high speed. To make these ships match their ship designs more closely and change their role, we’re transforming them into gunboat destroyers. After all, they were designed to counter less well-armed counterparts.\n\nThat said, this change comes in the form of increased charges of Main Battery Reload Booster and improvements to their main battery shells, at the cost of torpedo performance:\n\nIII Bourrasque\n\nMain battery armament\n\nMain battery reload speed improved from 6.6 to 6.3 s\n\nHE shell damage increased from 1,900 to 2,050\n\nAP shell damage increased from 2,300 to 2,450\n\nTorpedo armament\n\nStock torpedo reload speed reduced from 75 to 80 s\n\nUpgraded torpedo reload speed reduced from 73 to 75 s\n\nUpgraded torpedo speed increased from 58 to 59 kts\n\nIV Jaguar\n\nMain battery armament\n\nHE shell damage increased from 1,900 to 2,050\n\nAP shell damage increased from 2,300 to 2,450\n\nTorpedo armament\n\nStock torpedo reload speed reduced from 90 to 95 s\n\nStock torpedo speed increased from 57 to 66 kts\n\nUpgraded torpedo reload speed reduced from 88 to 90 s\n\nUpgraded torpedo speed increased from 59 to 68 kts\n\nBoth stock & upgraded torpedoes:\n\nTorpedo detectability range increased from 1.2 to 1.4 km\n\nTorpedo damage decreased from 18,400 to 14,833\n\nTorpedoes are less likely to disable modules\n\nV Guepard\n\nMain battery armament\n\nHE shell damage increased from 2,000 to 2,200\n\nAP shell damage increased from 2,600 to 2,850\n\nAP shell service cost increased from 0 to 12 credits per shell (this is fixing it to normal for a 138.6 mm shell)\n\nMain Battery Reload Booster charges increased from 1 to 2\n\nMain Battery Reload Booster cooldown time decreased from 150 to 120 s\n\nTorpedo armament\n\nStock torpedoes\n\nReload speed reduced from 90 to 95 s\n\nSpeed increased from 57 to 66 kts\n\nTorpedo detectability range increased from 1.2 to 1.4 km\n\nTorpedo damage decreased from 18,400 to 14,833\n\nTorpedoes are less likely to disable modules\n\nUpgraded torpedoes\n\nSpeed increased from 59 to 68 kts\n\nTorpedo detectability range increased from 1.2 to 1.4 km\n\nTorpedo damage decreased from 18,400 to 14,833\n\nTorpedoes are less likely to disable modules\n\nVI Vauquelin\n\nMain battery armament\n\nHE shell damage increased from 2,000 to 2,200\n\nAP shell damage increased from 2,600 to 2,850\n\nMain Battery Reload Booster charges increased from 1 to 2\n\nMain Battery Reload Booster cooldown time decreased from 150 to 120 s\n\nTorpedo armament\n\nStock torpedoes\n\nReload speed reduced from 90 to 95 s\n\nSpeed increased from 59 to 66 knots\n\nTorpedo detectability range increased from 1.2 to 1.4 km\n\nTorpedo damage decreased from 18,400 to 14,833\n\nTorpedoes are less likely to disable modules\n\nUpgraded torpedoes\n\nReload speed reduced from 87 to 90 seconds\n\nSpeed increased from 61 to 68 kts\n\nTorpedo detectability range increased from 1.2 to 1.4 km\n\nTorpedo damage decreased from 18,400 to 14,833\n\nTorpedoes are less likely to disable modules\n\nVII Le Fantasque\n\nMain battery armament\n\nHE shell damage increased from 2,000 to 2,200\n\nAP shell damage increased from 2,700 to 2,950\n\nMain Battery Reload Booster charges increased from 1 to 2\n\nMain Battery Reload Booster duration increased from 15 to 20 s\n\nTorpedo armament\n\nStock torpedoes\n\nReload speed reduced from 90 to 95 s\n\nTorpedo detectability range decreased from 1.9 to 1.8 km\n\nTorpedo damage decreased from 18,400 to 16,667\n\nUpgraded torpedoes\n\nReload speed reduced from 86 to 90 s\n\nSpeed increased from 70 to 72 knots\n\nTorpedo detectability range decreased from 1.9 to 1.8 km\n\nTorpedo damage decreased from 18,400 to 16,667\n\nTorpedo range decreased from 8.3 to 8.0 km\n\nVIII Mogador\n\nMain battery armament\n\nMain Battery Reload Booster charges increased from 1 to 2\n\nMain Battery Reload Booster duration increased from 15 to 20 s\n\nTorpedo armament\n\nStock torpedoes\n\nTorpedo damage decreased from 18,400 to 17,200\n\nUpgraded torpedoes\n\nTorpedo damage decreased from 18,400 to 17,200\n\n★ Kléber\n\nMain battery armament\n\nMain Battery Reload Booster charges increased from 1 to 2\n\nMain Battery Reload Booster duration increased from 15 to 20 s\n\nTorpedo armament\n\nTorpedo reload speed reduced from 77 to 85 s\n\nTorpedo damage decreased from 18,400 to 17,200\n\nTier IV Premium Siroco, Royal Navy Tier VII Premium Caprice, and German Tier VII Premium ZF-6 have also received the following changes to their Main Battery Reload booster:\n\n• Main Battery Reload Booster charges increased from 1 to 2\n\n• Main Battery Reload Booster cooldown time decreased from 150 to 120 s\n\nThis is because these ships share the same Main Battery Reload Booster as the tech tree ships (except Le Fantasque, Mogador, & Kleber), and therefore received the same improvements. This was not intended, but we consider it a happy accident as it should not cause any issues for game balance with these ships.\n\nItalian Tech Tree Cruisers\n\nIn this update, the Italian Tech Tree cruisers from Tier II to Tier VII are receiving the option to equip Semi-Armor-Piercing (SAP) shells. You will have the choice of using HE or SAP shells when helming these ships, like with their Premium counterparts and Marco Polo. A few of these ships have also received improvements to their standard AP shells.\n\nIn regard to the increase in reload time for SAP shells, the majority of Italian cruisers have been performing well, with the exception of the lower tier ships. The results of testing show that giving SAP shells to a ship markedly increases her performance, so we aim to make this addition without overcooking the ships. If needed, changes can always be made in the future.\n\nII Taranto\n\nUpgraded main battery AP shell damage increased from 3,700 to 4,000\n\nAdded SAP upgrade module — Artillery: 150 mm/45 SK L/45-2 SAP\n\nIncreases reload time to 13 s\n\nChanges HE to SAP ammunition\n\nSAP shell damage: 3,550\n\nPenetrates 42 mm of armor\n\nRicochet angles: Can ricochet at 70 degrees; guaranteed to ricochet at 80 degrees\n\nIII Giussano\n\nAdded SAP upgrade module — Artillery: 152 mm/53 Ansaldo 1926 SAP\n\nIncreases reload time to 16.5 s\n\nChanges HE to SAP ammunition\n\nSAP shell damage: 3,850\n\nPenetrates 42 mm of armor\n\nRicochet angles: Can ricochet at 70 degrees; guaranteed to ricochet at 80 degrees\n\nIV Montecuccoli\n\nAdded SAP upgrade module — Artillery: 152mm/53 OTO Model 1926 SAP\n\nIncreases reload time to 15.5 s\n\nChanges HE to SAP ammunition\n\nSAP shell damage: 3,850\n\nPenetrates 42 mm of armor\n\nRicochet angles: Can ricochet at 70 degrees; guaranteed to ricochet at 80 degrees\n\nV Trento\n\nUpgraded Main Battery AP Shell Damage increased from 4,800 to 5,100.\n\nAdded SAP upgrade module — Artillery: 203 mm/50 Ansaldo 1929 SAP\n\nIncreases reload time to 16.5 s\n\nChanges HE to SAP ammunition\n\nSAP shell damage: 4,850\n\nPenetrates 55 mm of armor\n\nRicochet angles: Can ricochet at 70 degrees; guaranteed to ricochet at 80 degrees\n\nVI Zara\n\nAdded SAP upgrade module — Artillery: 203 mm/53 Model 1927 SAP\n\nIncreases reload time to 16 s\n\nChanges HE to SAP ammunition\n\nSAP shell damage: 5,050\n\nPenetrates 55 mm of armor\n\nRicochet angles: Can ricochet at 70 degrees; guaranteed to ricochet at 80 degrees\n\nVII Amalfi\n\nUpgraded main battery AP shell damage increased from 4,800 to 5,100.\n\nAdded SAP upgrade module — Artillery: 203 mm/55 Model 1934 SAP\n\nIncreases reload time to 17.5 s\n\nChanges HE to SAP ammunition\n\nSAP shell damage: 5,200\n\nPenetrates 55 mm of armor\n\nRicochet angles: Can ricochet at 70 degrees; guaranteed to ricochet at 80 degrees\n\nHE Penetration Logic\n\nThis is a fundamental change to how all high-explosive (HE) munitions work in the game (main battery guns, ATBA guns, carrier bombs).\n\nBefore this change, HE of all types had to have greater penetration than the armor the shell (or bomb) struck. So, if an HE shell had 25 mm of penetration, it could only penetrate up to 24 mm of armor. This was called the \"Greater Than\" or \"–1 Rule.\"\n\nAfter this change, HE of all types will now penetrate armor that is thinner or equal totheir penetration value. So, if an HE shell has 25 mm of penetration, it can penetrate up to 25 mm of armor. We call this the \"Equal To\" rule.\n\nIn effect, this improves the effectiveness of HE shells and secondary battery guns in the game, the most improved ships will be light cruisers armed with 6-inch (152 mm) guns at Tiers V and VI. We’re aware of a few additional changes that may need to be made and will be watching impacted ships closely—in particular, the battleships at these tiers.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nVII Vanguard\n\nFinally, let's start the new year with a time-honored tradition—a Vanguard buff! This change makes the ship more consistent with the rest of the British battleship Tech Tree while marginally improving her overall performance.\n\nMain battery HE shell penetration increased from 64 to 95 mm\n\nTry out the changes, and turn the tide!"
