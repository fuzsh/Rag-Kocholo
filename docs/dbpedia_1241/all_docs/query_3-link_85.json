        "text": "Tyranny in recent times has presented students of philosophy and history with a new problem: in an age of Enlightenment, when reason, security, and prosperity were thought to be advancing ineluctably against their opposites, modern man has subjected himself to systematic persecutions and slaughters on an unprecedented scale, while the very sciences said to guarantee our progress have long since taught us, à la Thomas Hobbes, that tyranny is merely a disapproving word concocted by those “discontented” under a given regime. How can one account for—and thus effectively oppose—the evils we have witnessed, when their very source is said to be a figment of the imagination?\n\nSophie Wahnich’s succinct and bold essay on the French Revolution seamlessly integrates an admirable command of historical detail and philosophical analysis in a highly seductive argument. Wahnich argues that the (Reign of) Terror was neither the necessary outcome of the French Revolution nor a policy of arbitrary violence and intimidation. Rather, it was a conscious attempt to defend the revolution and contain and control outbursts of popular violence. Her argument is a conscious attack on the revisionist accounts of the French Revolution, which have displaced the traditional republican celebration of the revolution as the birthplace of modern democracy, instead identifying it as the origin of the greatest political catastrophes of the twentieth century, from the Shoah to the Gulags and contemporary terrorism. The primary avatars of this revisionism are historians such as François Furet and his followers, but also include political thinkers such as Hannah Arendt and Giorgio Agamben.\n\nThe Dictionnaire Robespierre, Lexicométrie et usages langagiers. Outils pour une histoire du lexique de l'Incorruptible, tome I (Trieste: Edizioni Università di Trieste, 2015), is the product of a team of Italian historians working on the French Revolution in the department of social sciences at the University of Trieste. It presents itself as a print edition of a work-in-progress. Utilizing the digital technology of computational linguistics, this paper dictionary aims to provide provisional yet useful information to scholars working on the French Revolution and Robespierre as they await a comprehensive and fully accessible digitalized database of documents related to printed materials from the French Revolution and the reign of Terror. While Stanford University has now entirely digitized the Archives Parlementaires, the members of the University of Trieste have focused on publishing print editions of lexicographical studies of key Revolutionary terms and concepts. Cesare Vetter, one of the three researchers behind volume one of the Dictionnaire Robespierre has published two volumes on La felicità è un'idea nuova in Europa (in collaboration with Elisabetta Gon and Marco Marin, who are also the co-authors of the dictionary). The Robespierre dictionary aims to facilitate the study of Revolutionary historiography by providing empirical data on word-clusters deployed by Robespierre in his public speeches and writings. A \" linguistic turn \" is arguably central to gaining a full understanding of the tenor of Robespierre's ideas and can correct some interpretations of Robespierre's political thought that have resulted in what the dictionary authors deem to be vital misunderstandings in Robespierrist studies: namely, the reputation of a terroristic Robespierre who denies individuality to citizen-subjects and who evades the issue of women's role in French society, as well as questions of gender. In fact, the qualitative data yielded by the scientific study of Robespierre's vocabulary demonstrates the importance of the concept of happiness in the politician's thought (491 occurrences identified in the eleven volumes of Robespierre's OEuvres), and helpfully tracks the references to \" liberté des femmes \" and usages of figures of the maternal in Robespierre's political speeches. The authors grant that this reference work best serves as a modest launching pad rather than a destination point for scholarly enquiries that would deepen historical studies on Robespierre by paying stylistic attention to the emotive modulations of Robespierre's rhetoric and to the study of political contexts. The Dictionary also does not investigate Robespierre's private writings, which could lend an alternative light to his public addresses, but it does include an introductory essay on the importance of the notion of private existence and the individual in Robespierre's meditations on human happiness. The reference book positions itself as entering into fruitful synergy with recent Anglo-American scholarship on the Revolutionary period."
