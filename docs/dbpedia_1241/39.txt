From the popular game "Azur Lane" comes a scale figure of Le Malin , a Le Fantasque-class destroyer of the Vichya Dominion! The figure features her in an elegant dancing pose, with her lavish outfit and listless expression faithfully recreated. Attention has been paid to the paintwork of her white stockings, creating a translucent appearance. The delicate movement of the satin has also been carefully sculpted. Be sure to add the beautiful and hardworking Le Malin to your collection!
