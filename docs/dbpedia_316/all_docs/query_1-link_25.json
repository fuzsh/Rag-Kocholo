        "text": "Changes are underway at the helm of a local screen-based storytelling company that has achieved international success with numerous well-known screen projects.\n\nVancouver-based Thunderbird Entertainment Group announced today (December 9) that Mark Miller will step down as president and board director of Thunderbird and CEO of Great Pacific Media (GPM), which he cofounded.\n\nHowever, he will assume a new role as executive producer at GPM to focus on creative work. He will also remain a senior member of the creative team, which is responsible for TV series such as Highway Thru Hell, and will work with the development team on the creation of new content.\n\nConsequently, Thunderbird CEO Jennifer Twiner McCarron has been appointed as president of Thunderbird.\n\nMeanwhile, David Way will continue as GPM’s president while the CEO position is eliminated.\n\nThunderbird Entertainment Group—which is headquartered in Vancouver and also has offices in Los Angeles, Toronto, and Ottawa—creates scripted, unscripted, and animated programming for digital platforms, and Canadian and international broadcasters.\n\nThunderbird operates several divisions.\n\nIts scripted projects include Kim’s Convenience, Blade Runner 2049, and The Man in the High Castle.\n\nGreat Pacific Television (Thunderbird acquired GPM in 2014) specializes in documentary, game show, and reality television with series such as Daily Planet, Save My Reno, and Worst to First.\n\nMeanwhile, Thunderbird’s Vancouver animation studio, Atomic Cartoons, creates, produces, and finances programs for kids and family, such as Max and Ruby and Minecraft Miniseries."
