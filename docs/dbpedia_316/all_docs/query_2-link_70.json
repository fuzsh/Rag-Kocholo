        "text": "The federal government will invest $21 million into the King Thunderbird Centre.\n\nThe new home of Boyle Street, okimaw peyesew kamik (King Thunderbird Centre), has been under construction since 2023\n\nThe federal money was announced on Friday, and will be provided through the Green and Inclusive Community Buildings campaign.\n\nBoyle Street has also raised over $24 million for the project.\n\n\"Our city and our downtown face real challenges, and solving this problem needs all levels and all orders of government working alongside the frontlines of the amazing people of Boyle Street and so many others here from the public and private sector working together to get the job done,\" said Randy Boissonnault, minister of employment, workforce development and official languages.\n\n\"We are going to be able to serve our communities diverse needs in a safe, inclusive and accessible space, one that acknowledges cultural needs, and that all Edmontonians are treated and provided in a dignified way that respects their backgrounds.\"\n\nSign up for breaking news alerts from CTV News Edmonton, right at your fingertips\n\nKing Thunderbird will have 75,000 square feet of indoor space, including a triage area for people needing health support and services. There will also be a private outdoor space for ceremonies and land-based healing.\n\nThe most recent rendering of Boyle Street Community Services's King Thunderbird facility, released to CTV News Edmonton on May 3, 2024. The enhancements to King Thunderbird Centre are expected to reduce the facility's energy consumption by 99 per cent and greenhouse gas emissions by 708 tonnes annually.\n\nThe new facility has faced hurdles, including having its building permit revoked in November 2022.\n\n'Problematic decision': Permit board revokes Boyle Street application for new downtown location\n\nIn March 2023, the organization announced it was able to secure a permit again.\n\n'It's a beautiful space': Boyle Street secures permit for new location, despite community outcry\n\n\"This project has had lots of ups and downs, but with this investment, it removes all the uncertainty around this project,\" said Jordan Reiniger, the executive director of Boyle Street.\n\n\"(This investment) allows us to fully realize our original vision of a purpose built building that facilitates healing, that's a place of ceremony at the heart of our city and that gets people the supports that they need when they need it in the way that they need it.\"\n\nThe new facility will be located two blocks north of the former Boyle Street building.\n\n\"Thank you…to all of you who have come around this project in many different ways, you've approached this with compassion, with an open heart and you've just wanted to help your neighbors out who are struggling and having a difficult time,\" Reiniger said.\n\n\"This project is a demonstration of hope of what we can do in our city when we come together as a community and put people at the center.\"\n\nBoyle Street has been operating in Edmonton for over 50 years.\n\nThe organization moved out of its previous location in September after the lease on the building ended.\n\nBoyle Street Community Services closing downtown location at the end of September\n\nThe building was sold to the Oilers Entertainment Group in 2021 to raise funds for the new facility.\n\nBoyle Street Community Services is currently in a legal battle with a branch of the Katz group over a disputed $5 million conditional donation for the centre.\n\nHowever, Reiniger said the organization is confident they will be able to raise the last $4.5 million needed for the new facility.\n\n\"We're close enough that we can confidently say this is happening and we're starting construction,\" he added. \"We're full steam ahead.\""
