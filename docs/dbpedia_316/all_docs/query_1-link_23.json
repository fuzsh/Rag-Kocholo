However, they were released on VHS several times during the 80's and 90's in the UK (as volumes 1, 2, and 3 of the entire series VHS release). These also ended up creating a rights issue for the episodes meaning that these compilation films were the only form of the original episodes that could be released on VHS until the mid 90's. It wasn't until Carlton released the series in 2000 that the original episodes in their uncut form were released on a home video format.\n\nSee also[]\n\nFor the 2004 live-action remake, see:"
