In this regard, I have co-edited The Oxford Anthology of Indigenous Literature and An Anthology of Indigenous Literary Criticism in Canada. I have also published a wide range of creative texts, and my poetry has been included in over thirty anthologies, including The Best Canadian Poetry (2023) and The Best of the Best Canadian Poetry in English (2017)."
