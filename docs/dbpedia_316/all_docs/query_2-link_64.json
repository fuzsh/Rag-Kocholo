        "text": "Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA), the Directors Guild of Canada (DGC) and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) have come together, asking members to pledge to attend at least one all-candidates meeting or town hall leading up to the federal election and ask a question. The goal of the “Just Ask“ campaign (“Je m’implique” in French) is to get candidates on record on the future of Canada’s $9 billion screen-based production market. Micro-websites justask2019.ca and jemimplique2019.ca feature election backgrounders and sample questions on key issues facing the industry. One of the top questions the site encourages members to pose references the current lack of taxation and regulated Canadian content contributions from foreign digital players like Netflix and Amazon. Candidates will be asked if they’ll “support both legislation and regulation requiring all players that benefit from the Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications systems to invest in the creation of original Canadian programming?” Read more here.\n\nTelefilm Canada has issued a revised call for entries for the 92nd Academy Awards’ Best International Feature Film Award (formerly Best Foreign Language Film) following outcry over a proposed change in criteria. Each year, Telefilm coordinates the Pan-Canadian Selection Committee to determine which Canadian film will be submitted to the Academy Awards. Last week, the Crown corporation announced updated eligibility criteria, stipulating that to be entered, a film must be represented by an American sales agent/distributor or an international sales agent and have been selected by one of 13 eligible international film festivals. Telefilm said the goal of the changes was to ensure that the Selection Committee puts forth the strongest possible contender in a highly-competitive field. However after hearing from a “combination of different parties from the industry,” a Telefilm representative told Broadcast Dialogue there will be further consultation. Previously, Telefilm has always followed standard Academy criteria. Tuesday, Telefilm issued a revised call for entries saying that it would heed industry calls “to proceed with a more robust consultation with representatives of the industry before adopting new admissibility criteria.” Read more here.\n\nFIN Partners, the co-production/co-financing market, that runs concurrent to the FIN: Atlantic International Film Festival, Sept. 12-14 in Halifax, has announced the line-up of producers and delegates attending from the spotlight regions of the UK, Ireland, and the U.S. Among those producers/projects are Solon Papadopoulos and Roy Boulter: Hurricane Films – England; Chris Patterson: Causeway Pictures – Northern Ireland; Stella Nwimo: Boudica Entertainment – England; Alice Lusher and Catryn Ramasut: Ie Ie Productions Ltd. – Wales; Martin Gooch: Gothic Manor Ltd. – England; Arabella Page Croft: Black Camel Pictures – Scotland; Andrew Freedman and Samantha Corr: Venom Films – Ireland; Claire McCaughley: Treasure Entertainment – Ireland; Trevite Willis: Southern Fried Filmworks – USA; Lisa Black and Scott Lukacs: Garnet Girl – USA.
