        "text": "When Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman decided in 1961 that Dr. No would become James Bond’s first movie adventure, they immediately went to Jamaica to look for possible locations, together with Terence Young, the director. This exploration was remembered by EON in 1972, when they were again looking for a Caribbean location for Roger Moore’s first Bond movie, Live and Let Die. Their decision paid off, and the wonders of Jamaica surely came fully to their right in both films.\n\nIn our search for Bond locations, we wondered whether certain places would still be recognizable, especially those used in 1961-62. But we can assure you; Jamaica is just as ‘relaxed’ as it was in the 60’s and 70’s. Not much has changed. All tourists coming in by airplane arrive at Montego Bay, situated in the Northwest of the island. This is a good point to start off your trip.\n\nThe Bond locations are all over the island, so it is advisable to rent a car and drive around. Do not count on public transportation, because it doesn’t exist on Jamaica. The rental cars are mostly brand new Japanese cars and very comfortable. The roads in the north are reasonable, but the further you get from the tourist area, the worse the roads get. Jamaicans drive on the left, so if you’re not used to this, it’s better to practice first on your hotel’s grounds. Another important thing is the driving style. Be sure to have a good insurance and even then: Watch out! Most Jamaicans drive like maniacs and assume you are one of them.\n\nLucea is a small harbour town with some historical buildings and a fortress, Fort Charlotte. The town’s courthouse has a beautiful clock with a great anecdote attended. The clock was originally made for the island of St. Lucia, but was mixed up with a more moderate clock, built for Lucea at that same time. When the people of Lucea received the beautiful but wrongly delivered clock they refused to give it back. The town council was therefore forced by the people to buy it, and since then it decorates Lucea’s Courthouse.\n\nTime to relax a bit on the beautiful beaches of Negril. This is also a very touristy area, but world-famous for its eleven kilometres long, white, sandy beach. The former swamp-area now offers loads of hotels, restaurants and bars. One specific place worth mentioning is Rick’s Cafe. Here, locals frequently dive off a twenty-meter high cliff, and are considered a main attraction. The beach-area is divided into two halves, Long Bay and Bloody Bay. In between them, off coast, lies a small island named Booby Cay. This island served as a filming location for Walt Disney’s classic ‘20,000 Leagues under the Sea’.\n\nIf you have read Fleming’s novel ‘The Man with the Golden Gun’, some names of places in the vicinity of Negril will ring a bell, like e. g. Orange River, Green Island Harbour or The Great Morass. The Hotel ‘Thunderbird’, where most of the action of the novel takes place, is supposed to be located at Bloody Bay. When you leave Negril and drive south-westward, the first bigger town you reach will be Savanna-La-Mar. Here at No. 3 ½ Love Lane Bond meets Scaramanga for the first time (in the novel). This address in fact really exists, and resembles Fleming’s description of it."
