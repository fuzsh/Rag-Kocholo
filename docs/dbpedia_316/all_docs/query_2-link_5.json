(TSXV:TBRD) (\"Thunderbird\" or the \"Company\"), a global multiplatform entertainment company with offices in Los Angeles, London, Vancouver, Ottawa and Toronto, is delighted to announce the opening of a new production hub in Ottawa, Canada.

The city has an established animation sector and local universities are producing incredible talent at all levels,\" says Jennifer Twiner McCarron, chief executive officer, Thunderbird Entertainment and Atomic Cartoons. \"It is important we tap into the potential of talent-pools across Canada to support Thunderbird's plans for the future, and to keep up with the growing number of requests we are getting from partners like Netflix, Amazon, Disney, Discovery and the CBC.\"\n\nTwiner McCarron, also recently met with Ottawa's film commissioner, Bruce Harvey, and Mayor Jim Watson to share the Company's enthusiasm for its new studio and long-term vision.\n\nHarvey echoes Twiner McCarron's excitement about the new production hub. \"We're thrilled that Thunderbird has selected Ottawa, the birthplace of Canada's animation industry, for the first major expansion of its kids' division,\" he says. \"Thunderbird's presence will further distinguish Ottawa as a first-choice destination for talent looking for a career at the highest levels in the animation industry, and it will also strengthen our entertainment industry with production of factual and scripted content. Thunderbird now joins our family of six world-class animation studios, North America's largest animation festival, and multiple post-secondary animation programs in an affordable, artist friendly, G7 capital city.\"\n\nThe new production hub will also focus on growing Thunderbird's factual footprint in Ottawa, where segments of its hit series Heavy Rescue: 401 are already produced.\n\n\"Ottawa has the depth of journalistic talent and is a great place to grow Canada's rapidly expanding factual story telling industry,\" notes Mark Miller, president, Thunderbird Entertainment. \"It's exciting to be in Ottawa, where our Thunderbird team has already started to tap into the city's network of top level story tellers, to create our globally recognized factual content.\"\n\nAbout Thunderbird Entertainment Group Inc.\n\nThunderbird Entertainment Group is a Vancouver-based global multiplatform entertainment company with offices in Vancouver, Los Angeles, Toronto, Ottawa and London.
