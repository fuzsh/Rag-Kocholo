        "text": "The University of British Columbia's Vancouver campus is located at the western tip of the Point Grey Peninsula, close to the city of Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada. UBC's second campus - Okanagan campus - is located in Kelowna, about 5 hours north-east of Vancouver.\n\nUBC's Point Grey (Vancouver) campus, sits on the traditional, ancestral, unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) First Nation.\n\nThe University Endowment Lands community (also known as University Hill) is situated adjacent to the campus to the east, while 763 hectares of forested parkland known as Pacific Spirit Regional Park serves as a \"green belt\" between Vancouver and the campus.\n\nThe main campus is bounded by Chancellor Boulevard to the northwest, Marine Drive to the southwest, Wesbrook Mall to the northeast, and West 16th Avenue to the southeast. This represents the administrative and educational core of UBC.\n\nThe South Campus is bounded by Southwest Marine Drive to the south, West 16th Avenue to the northwest, and Pacific Spirit Park to the northeast. The South Campus houses many research facilities.\n\nThe East Campus is bounded by West 16th Avenue on the south, Wesbrook Mall on the west, Acadia Road on the east, and on the north its border zigzags from Toronto Road to Agronomy Road to Fairview Avenue. A large part of the East Campus is made up of student, faculty and staff housing, along with child care buildings and the local police and fire department. UBC's first market housing development, known as Hampton Place, is also located here.\n\nAlthough many buildings on campus are quite new, the University's history actually dates back to 1877.\n\nCampus Tours\n\nDue to the diversity of our many research facilities, we do not offer campus tours specifically for graduate students. However, individual departments or research groups may offer open houses or other outreach events that may allow you to visit their facilities. Please check on the websites of individual departments or programs for such opportunities.\n\nYou can enjoy one of our many self-guided campus walking tours, such as from the Sustainability Initiative or the Art Outdoor Tour. Or you may decide to walk in Pacific Spirit Regional Park.\n\nOr try out one of these five 30 minute walking maps:\n\nMain Mall Trail\n\nSword Fern Trail\n\nThunderbird Trail\n\nTower Beach Trail\n\nWreck Beach Trail\n\nOnce you're here, there are several options for getting around campus—you can walk, bike and for longer distances there are convenient and accessible shuttle buses to get you where you need to go. Find more information on how to get around campus.\n\nIf you have a temporary or permanent condition that limits your mobility, the Accessibility Shuttle can help you get around areas of campus that can only be reached on foot. The shuttle is a free, shared-ride service; you can book up to three trips a day. Each building in the service area is within 100 meters of a shuttle stop."
