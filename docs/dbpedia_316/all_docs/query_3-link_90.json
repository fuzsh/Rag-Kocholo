        "text": "A Los Angeles City Council committee on Tuesday will consider increasing the total cost of LAX’s significantly delayed Automated People Mover from $2.9 billion to $3.34 billion in a bid to settle legal claims and finalize the project’s completion date.\n\nOn Tuesday’s agenda, the five-member Trade, Ravel and Tourism Committee will consider an additional $400 million for the project. The L.A. World Airports Commissioners previously approved the funding on July 18, which they said is needed to address claims filed by the contractor, LAX Integrated Express Solutions, also known as LINXS, over issues related to compensation and production.\n\nAt the time, LAWA CEO John Ackerman said the project is a top priority for airport leadership. The settlement agreement largely covers already completed extra work by LINXS dating back to August 2018, and a longer than anticipated construction timeline.\n\n“It is an honor to continue our partnership with LAWA and deliver a transportation system that will offer an elevated experience for travelers and Los Angeles residents alike. Our team has worked on large and complex transit projects around the globe, and the transformation provided by the LAX People Mover is poised to truly set the bar,” Shawn West, LINXS Constructors board member, said in a statement issued July 18.\n\nWith the board’s approval, the project could be completed on Dec. 8, 2025, and begin operation in January 2026. The electric train system on 2.25 miles of elevated rail with six stations will be available to ticketed passengers, their guests and airport employees for free.\n\nSusan Shelly, vice president of communications for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, criticized the board’s decision in a statement to City News Service on July 18.\n\n“A new allocation of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to settle legal claims over delays in the construction of the LAX Automated People Mover seems to suggest outrageous mismanagement in this over-budget and over-schedule project. Maybe the airport commissioners are showcasing to be appointed the next CEO of the California High Speed Rail Authority,” Shelley said.\n\nBefore the agreement can be finalized it will need to clear the council’s transportation committee and approval by the City Council.\n\nL.A. City Councilwoman Traci Park, who represents the 11th District, including the neighborhoods around LAX, and chair of the council’s tourism committee, backed the board’s decision.\n\nPark had said she was “hopeful” the project will reduce congestion on nearby streets and improve travel to and from LAX.\n\nThe LAWA board in May already approved some $200 million in additional money for the project, to address similar claims submitted by the contractor — but that money would be included as part of this $400 million, increasing the total settlement to about $550 million.\n\nAn additional $50 million will be part of a contingency that may or may not be allocated fully, according to airport officials.\n\nThe Automated People Mover is a piece of the airport’s larger $30 billion project to update terminals, gates and airport signage.\n\nThe project is aimed at coming online ahead of world events taking stage in the Los Angeles region, including the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nThe airport broke ground on the People Mover in March 2019. It’s estimated that it will eventually carry some 30 million passengers a year, resulting in 117,000 fewer vehicle miles traveled per day, according to LAWA’s website.\n\nLAX’s train will operate 24/7, with trains arriving at stations every two minutes during peak hours from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m.. Running on 2.25 miles of elevated rail, it will connect to six stations: three inside the Central Terminal Area, one at LAX’s Economy Parking facility, one connecting to Metro’s LAX/Metro Transit Center station with transfers to the C (Green) and K lines and one at LAX’s Consolidated Rent-A-Car facility. Total end-to-end travel time will be 10 minutes with a top speed of 47 miles per hour."
