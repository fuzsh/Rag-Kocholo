        "text": "Thunderbird is a rapidly growing Vancouver-based TV and film production company with offices in Los Angeles, Toronto and London.\n\nThe Thunderbird is a mythological creature born from the rich narrative tradition of Canada’s First Nations people in the Pacific Northwest. The Thunderbird is often carved at the top of totem poles, which bring communities together to illustrate their stories. The artwork, which depicts abstract elements of the Thunderbird legend, was commissioned from First Nations artist Corrine Hunt for Vancouver-based television production company Thunderbird. Hunt, also the co-creator of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic medals, captures the story of the company’s namesake, while honouring her roots and cultivating a refreshing artistic expression. Thunderbird is a rapidly growing Vancouver-based TV and film production company with offices in Los Angeles, Toronto and London. Thunderbird produces award winning programming for Canadian and International broadcasters. The Thunderbird group of companies includes Vancouver-based Reunion Pictures, Great Pacific Media and Atomic Cartoons, UK-based theatrical distributor Soda Pictures, and a joint venture with Lionsgate, Sea to Sky Entertainment, which is dedicated to creating content for the US and International market."
