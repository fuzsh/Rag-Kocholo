        "text": "VANCOUVER, Nov. 23, 2018 /CNW/ - Thunderbird Entertainment Group Inc. (TSXV:TBRD) (\"Thunderbird\" or the \"Company\"), a global multiplatform entertainment company with offices in Los Angeles, London, Vancouver, Ottawa and Toronto, is pleased to announce that its UK subsidiary, Thunderbird Releasing Limited, has secured the rights to distribute Hirokazu Kore-eda's Palme d'Or-winning film Shoplifters across the UK and Ireland. Following its international premier at the Cannes Film Festival, Shoplifters debuts Friday, November 23, 2018 at key venues in London, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin and throughout the UK.\n\nShoplifters was awarded the Palme d'Or at Cannes amidst fierce competition from films by Spike Lee and Jean-Luc Godard among others - marking the second time that an Asian film has won the prestigious award this century. The film follows a Tokyo family who relies on shoplifting to cope with a life of poverty, as they adopt an abused young girl found abandoned in the street. Shoplifters features the final performance of veteran Japanese actress Kirin Kiki, who passed away earlier this year, as well as Kore-eda regular Lily Franky(Our Little Sister; Like Father, Like Son).\n\n\"Thunderbird is honoured to distribute Shoplifters in the UK, not only because it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, but because it is a deeply impacting story that urgently needs to be told,\" says Edward Fletcher, Managing Director of Thunderbird Releasing. \"Early reviews are praising Shoplifters, and we know that audiences across the UK and Ireland will be moved by the journey of the Shibata family.\"\n\nInitial reviews for the film are overwhelmingly positive, with the Daily Telegraph calling it a \"thrilling beautiful tale of Tokyo's down-and-outs,\"Maggie Lee of Variety writing: \"At once charming and heart-wrenching, this exquisitely performed film will steal the hearts of both art-house and mainstream audiences,\" and Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian declaring it \"a rich, satisfying and deeply intelligent film.\"\n\nBeyond Shoplifters, upcoming releases from Thunderbird include Burning, The Kindergarten Teacher and Vita & Virginia. Recent releases include The Heiresses, Redoubtable, Sweet Country, Toni Erdmann, A Quiet Passion, My Life as a Courgette, A Man Called Ove, Land of Mine and Brimstone.\n\nAbout Thunderbird Entertainment Group Inc.\n\nThunderbird Entertainment Group is a Vancouver-based global multiplatform entertainment company with offices in Vancouver, Los Angeles, Toronto, Ottawa and London.
