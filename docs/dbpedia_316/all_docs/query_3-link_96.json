        "text": "Towards the end of the movie, when Thunderbird 3 lands in London, all 3 engines are working to land it, even though the reason they couldn't get there in time was that only 2 of the 3engines was working (as seen when they left orbit).\n\nIn the freezer, Onaha's hands are meant to be tied behind her back, like everyone else's, yet she slaps her thighs when Lady P hits the icicle with her shoe.\n\nBefore Tintin uses her powers to flip the catwalk at the Bank of London, Alan is hanging from the middle of the railing. After the railing flips, Alan is instantly at the edge.\n\nLady Penelope reports that Thunderbird 2 is on final approach to London, looking at a display that shows T2 at the western edge of greater London. However this is after we have seen T2 fly under Tower Bridge in the heart of the city.\n\nWhen Lady Penelope is in TB1 she is wearing a pink jumpsuit, long hair and a pink hands-free device. The next scene in the bank she has changed her clothes and her hair is in a bun\n\nContact is re-established with Thunderbird five seconds before it re-enters the atmosphere, at an altitude of around 100 miles. Yet seconds later they confirm having established geosynchronous orbit, which requires an altitude of 22,300 miles.\n\nAt the beginning, Alan's dad asked him if he was wearing his retainer (showing that it goes in and out). Later, when Fermat needed to solder, they had to yank his retainer out, like it was cemented in.\n\nIn the opening rescue, people at the scene are waiting for the Thunderbirds to arrive, and then Thunderbirds 1 and 2 arrive at the same time. Thunderbird 1 is much faster than 2 and would have arrived much earlier in order to assess the situation.\n\nWhen the Hood and his men are in the mole, they start an EMP to knock out the security system. An EMP would also knock out the lights and the rest of the power, but they are still on throughout the movie.\n\nAt lunch, Jeff Tracy asks to be passed the salad when he has the salad in his hand. But he is not asking that the salad be passed to him, he's handing it on and asking that it be passed along down the table.\n\nScenes of the Thunderbirds entering London show them flying from the East- passing Tower Bridge, then the London Assembly building and so forth. But maps showing their flightpaths, shots of the landings at the London Eye and shots of them passing over English coast and countryside imply that they're flying from the West.\n\nWhen the Hood is plotting his course to London, he is clearly going to approach from the west, but the first scene of him arriving in London is from the east under Tower bridge (for no apparent reason). In the next scene in Thunderbird One, Fermat reports that Thunderbird 2 is approaching London and on a map shows it coming from the west, but located around about Heathrow, roughly 15 miles from where we just saw it and in the opposite direction to Tower Bridge."
