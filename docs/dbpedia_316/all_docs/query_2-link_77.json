We have reached a turning point where our most recognized filmmakers and cinematic ambassadors are no longer English-speaking directors.

Traditionally, our domestic appreciation for French Canadian filmmakers has rarely been extended outside our own borders to international audiences.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nDomination du monde: How French Canadian directors are taking over the world of cinema Back to video\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nThat’s been changing dramatically as Québécois directors like Vallée, Denis Villeneuve, Xavier Dolan, and Philippe Falardeau are gaining momentum on the international scene with films like C.R.A.Z.Y., Incendies, Laurence Anyways and Monsieur Lazhar. You could almost call them a French Canadian New Wave.\n\nSince 2006, seven of the ten Best Motion Picture Winners at the Genie/Canadian Screen Awards went to French Canadians, and only one Best Achievement in Direction prize went to an English-speaker. Abroad, their films have garnered equal attention, with Villeneuve’s Incendies and Falardeau’s Monsieur Lazhar representing Canada in the Best Foreign Film category at the Oscars. All that momentum has led to multiple breakthroughs in the last few years, coalescing into a massive wave of international recognition and success. Perhaps most importantly, in Hollywood.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn the last three years alone, Falardeau made his English-language debut with The Good Lie; Vallée has quickly become a highly sought-after director for his ability to coax Oscar-worthy performances out of actors like Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto in Dallas Buyers Club, as well as Reese Witherspoon in Wild; while Villeneuve made an impression with the one-two Jake Gyllenhaal punch of Prisoners and Enemy, and now Sicario, which gets its much anticipated gala premiere at TIFF this Friday. As for wunderkind Dolan, his English-language debut—The Death and Life of John F. Donovan, starring Jessica Chastain­—is still forthcoming, but as far as wide recognition goes, it’s hard to top Mommy sharing the 2014 Cannes Jury Prize with Jean-Luc Godard.\n\nDolan’s promising collaboration with Chastain isn’t the only onwards and upwards move amongst the French Canadian directors, either. Villeneuve is next helming Story of Your Life, a sci-fi film with Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, before moving on to the much-anticipated Blade Runner sequel with Harrison Ford. Vallée has been working on getting a Janis Joplin biopic (also starring Amy Adams) off the ground. As for Falardeau, his latest film, My Internship in Canada, is a satire of Canadian politics showing at TIFF, but he’s openly expressed a desire to do “larger U.S. fare” in the future, moving forward from his 2014 film The Good Lie with Reese Witherspoon.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nQuébécois directors have long deserved the spotlight, and now they get to show off the wide range of talent they have to offer. One of the first things you notice when you compare the works of Vallée, Villeneuve, Dolan and Falardeau is that their sensibilites are all drastically different. Vallée is deft at Oscar-friendly character studies, Villeneuve makes dark mainstream thrillers, Dolan is an arthouse auteur and Falardeau simply makes visually beautiful pictures.\n\nWhat they all have in common, however, is their talent for great storytelling. It’s something Vallée, the unofficial spokesman of his colleagues, expressed last year when asked about their collective migration to making movies down south. “When I look at Philippe Falardeau, Xavier Dolan, Denis Villeneuve, there seems to be an intention to tell stories, and to get out of Montreal, get out of Quebec, to say: ‘Alright, let’s tell stories, let’s try to touch the world.’”\n\nIn an incredibly short amount of time, they’ve set themselves on a path to do just that, and it will be exciting to see where that path will take them.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThat’s undoubtedly exciting, as it always is when Canadian talent succeeds on a larger scale. It’s especially encouraging to see French Canadian filmmakers get the kind of worldwide recognition they haven’t received in the past.\n\nStill, if 2015 becomes the turning point it promises to be, Canadian cinephiles can be forgiven for feeling a bit of empty nest syndrome at the thought of once again losing our best talents to Hollywood, instead of seeing them continue to make movies at home. We’ll be left to appreciate their success as Canadians, even if we’re the only ones who remember them as such.\n\nAll of this means that 2015 could represent the last time many of these directors make films outside of Hollywood. They are on the precipice of not only being acclaimed French Canadian directors, but simply acclaimed directors.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
