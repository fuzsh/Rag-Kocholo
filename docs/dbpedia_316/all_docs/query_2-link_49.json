        "text": "Thunderbird Stadium is an outdoor stadium on the University Endowment Lands in British Columbia, Canada. It is located west of Vancouver's city limits, and is primarily used for soccer and football by the UBC Thunderbirds. It seats 3,500 in the main grandstand, plus grass seating for about 5,000 people on the west side and ends of the stadium.\n\nThe stadium was opened on October 7, 1967.[1] It features 12 80-foot-high concrete support towers, all topped with concrete thunderbird statues created by renowned First Nations artist Bill Reid[2] Later renovations include the replacement of a few original benches with fold-down seating directly below the press box.\n\nHistory[]\n\nSports[]\n\nThe top attendance for a football game at Thunderbird Stadium came in 1989 â€“ the Shrum Bowl football game between the Thunderbirds and Simon Fraser University was seen by an estimated 8,700 fans.\n\nThe facility is also used for Canadian Rugby international matches, and the B.C. High School Rugby Championships. In 2009, the stadium was used to host the Ireland national rugby union team playing against the Canada national rugby union team.[3]\n\nSince 2006, the stadium has been used for Australian rules football matches, including the West Coast Challenge tournament, and in 2007 as the venue for Canada's international games against the United States and Japan which drew 2,500 spectators. In 2008, it became home to the Vancouver Cougars club.\n\nIn 2013, the Vancouver Nighthawks, a professional ultimate team competing in Major League Ultimate, became tenants of Thunderbird Stadium. A total of five home games are expected to be played at Thunderbird Stadium for both the team and the league's inaugural season.\n\nIn April 2015, the USL Pro soccer team, Whitecaps 2 (part of the Vancouver Whitecaps) began to play its home games at the stadium.[4]\n\nIn June 2015, A Canadian Football League preseason game was held at the stadium on June 19, 2015, between the BC Lions and Edmonton Eskimos. This was due to Women's World Cup soccer being held at the Lions' usual home, BC Place.[5]\n\nCultural events[]\n\nThe facility was also used for cultural events and rock festivals. However, with the installation of artificial turf in 2010, concerts are no longer permitted.\n\nThunderbird Stadium hosted Ozzfest, Lilith Fair, Lollapalooza, Area:One Festival, Another Roadside Attraction and the Arts County Fair. It also held individual concerts including \"Midnight Oil/Hunters & Collectors/Art Bergmann\" in 1991. From 1995 it was used for the Vans Warped Tour. Up to 25,000 have attended concerts and/or festivals at the stadium.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nOfficial Page"
