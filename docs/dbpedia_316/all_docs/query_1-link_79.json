        "text": "Located on Nevada’s eastern shore of Lake Tahoe, Thunderbird Lodge is a historic site built in 1939 and sometimes referred to as “Nevada’s Castle in the Sky.” It was once owned by George Whittell Jr. (also known as Captain Whittell), an eccentric millionaire who owned a large percentage of the area around Lake Tahoe (as much as 40,000 acres). Whittell valued his privacy so much that he is the reason a lot of the land remained undeveloped, yet well-maintained, after the construction of his main lodge.\n\nAfter Whittell passed away in 1969, Jack Dreyfus of Dreyfus Investments purchased his property along with an adjacent 10,000 acres. At the time, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency said that Dreyfus’s request to add onto the property could not be historical in nature, a policy which has since been reversed, so an entertainment room and a two-story wing added onto the lodge in 1985 reflect a distinctly different time period than the rest of the lodge (source).\n\nEventually, the property came to be under the protection and ownership of the Thunderbird Lodge Preservation Society, a non-profit formed to preserve the area. The estate is currently compromised of:\n\nMain lodge\n\nLakeside lawn\n\n1,500 sq. ft. conference room with views of the water and lakeside lawn\n\nPrivate sandy cove\n\nThree cottages\n\nCard house / game room\n\nBoathouse where the famous Thunderbird Yacht is moored\n\nElephant house\n\n1,800 sq. ft. lighthouse room featuring floor-to-ceiling windows and built around a soaring masonry lighthouse\n\nThree garages\n\nGatehouse\n\nElaborate tree and granite boulder filled grounds with fountains, three-story waterfalls, staircases, and paths\n\n600 ft. underground privacy tunnel that allows escape from the card room and leads to the boathouse\n\nThe buildings were designed by Nevada State Architect, Frederick J. DeLongchamps.\n\nA few of the other interesting things that have drawn visitors to Thunderbird Lodge include the following:\n\nThunderbird Yacht\n\nThe Thunderbird Yacht is a world famous attraction. 55 feet long and made of Honduran mahogany, it was designed by Naval architect John Hacker, who designed the commuter boat to resemble Whittell’s personal DC-2 aircraft and his Duesenbergs automobiles (source).\n\nThe Thunderbird Yacht was commemorated by the U.S. Postal Service on a postage stamp in 2007 (source).\n\nExotic Animals\n\nWhittell was known for his love of animals. He purchased a two-ton Indian elephant named Mingo from the Barnum & Bailey Circus in 1931 and had an elephant house built for him (source). He also owned a few lions, including one named Bill that traveled with him everywhere. Stories floated around of guests waking up to Bill licking them. When Whittell died, he left much of his estate to animal rights groups (source).\n\nHauntings\n\nMany people are convinced that Thunderbird Lodge is haunted. One of the earliest stories of tragedy occurring at the property is when a worker in the pool house fell from a ladder and died. Although Whittell sealed the room off, visitors have claimed that the worker’s restless spirit haunts the lodge.\n\nOther stories of ghostly whispers and strange apparitions have led psychics and even reality television shows to investigate the lodge for paranormal activity. It is believed that the spirits of Native Americans and other ghosts haunt many parts of the estate.\n\nWith beautiful mountain ranges, gorgeous gardens, stunning lagoons, waterfalls, and fountains, Thunderbird Lodge offers a breathtaking, picturesque film setting. Thunderbird Lodge is also full of interesting tales, architecture, and resources. If you are looking for a historic piece of property to film your next production at, be sure to take a tour of Thunderbird Lodge.
