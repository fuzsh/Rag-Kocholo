        "text": "By Bill Watson, Chief Executive & Curator\n\nIn 1939, flamboyant Tahoe summer resident Captain George Whittell Jr. commissioned naval architect John L. Hacker to design a new kind of speedboat: one having the lines of his Duesenberg automobiles and DC-2 aircraft. He envisioned a powerful and stylish yacht that would seamlessly cut through the afternoon chop kicked up by zephyr winds along Lake Tahoe’s East Shore.\n\nWhittell specified the boat’s fit and finish: double-planked Honduran mahogany over a frame of sawn white oak, polished stainless-steel houses and gleaming crystal accents.\n\nA year-round boat, there was forced-air cabin heat to keep passengers cozy on inclement days, hot- and cold-running water, a shower, wardrobe, four Pullman-style berths, galley and an ample head. No creature comfort was overlooked.\n\nWhen Hacker lost his own shop in the Great Depression, he worked from Ben Huskins’ Bay City, Mich., boat works. Hacker anticipated a 36-month construction schedule. However, with laborers desperate for employment and working three shifts each day, Thunderbird was delivered in 11 months for a then-staggering price of $83,500. After November trials on the Saginaw River, Hacker shipped her the following summer by rail to Lake Tahoe.\n\nThunderbird arrived at Mayfield’s Boatyard in Tahoe City on July 12, 1940. Mayfield’s, the former railroad engine house and shops, is now home to Tahoe Yacht Club and Tahoe City Marina.\n\nMaking headlines across the nation, Whittell deprived the waiting press of a “scoop” when, in the wee hours of July 15, 1940, he slipped “Thunderbird” quietly out of Mayfield’s as reporters slept soundly nearby. Whittell berthed his new toy in a cavernous steel boathouse blasted into solid rock and connected to his stone castle — Thunderbird Lodge — by a 600-foot-long tunnel.\n\nDuring World War II, at the age of 60, the U.S. government deemed Whittell too old to serve the war effort. Possibly feeling dejected, he lost his passion for technology, socializing and gallivanting, which included cruising aboard his yacht.\n\nTwenty-two years after building his prized vessel, Whittell sold “Thunderbird” to casino magnate Bill Harrah. Harrah added a flying bridge and replaced her twin Kermath Sea Raider engines (having only 83 operating hours) with Allison V-12 aircraft engines. He then coined her his “70 mile-an-hour cocktail lounge” and entertained on board Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Sammy Davis Jr., Liza Minelli and many more.\n\nToday, the party continues aboard “Thunderbird” yacht. The nonprofit Thunderbird Lodge Preservation Society meticulously cares for “Thunderbird” yacht at her original home, the historic Thunderbird Lodge estate on Lake Tahoe’s East Shore. The preservation society uses the yacht extensively for its school and maritime heritage programs, partnerships with children’s organizations such as Make-a-Wish Foundation and Boys and Girls Clubs, and as a fundraising vehicle for its own museum and preservation endeavors.\n\n“Thunderbird” is on view at Thunderbird Lodge, which is offering limited tours this summer. | thunderbirdtahoe.org\n\nChronology of “Thunderbird” yacht’s first 80 years\n\nSpring 1939 | Captain George Whittell, Jr. commissions naval architect John L.
