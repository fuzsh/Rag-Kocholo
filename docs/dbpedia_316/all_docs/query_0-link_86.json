See here for more information.\n\nFor crew members who will be entering to oversee the project, Western passport holders are able to enter Canada visa-free with an eTA for a period of up to six months. This excludes US nationals arriving directly from the US, who are exempt from the eTA requirement.\n\nTransport & Accommodation\n\nTransportation Infrastructure.
