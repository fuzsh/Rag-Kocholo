It played second run movies, exploitation flicks, bikini beach pictures, horror movies – a perfect venue for American International Pictures product! Cars packed the theatre for Banko night (a variation of bingo), but the real draw was the naughty midnight movie. A showing of the X-rated version of “Cinderella” got the manager thrown in jail for a few hours. Of course, the city fathers had to watch the movie several times before deciding that it was “pornographic”!\n\nkd3p76d on\n\nI remember when I was around 6 years old in the very early 70s going to a drive-in theater called the Thunderbird. It was on Montgomery Highway in Vestavia Alabama about where Vestavia Bowl is now (1429 Mont. Hwy.) I loved the look of it with the neon lights.\n\nDTaylor on\n\nOh I’m sorry to say that’s not the marquee for the one in Decatur Al., I should know I had to climb up and change the movies. Across the street I’d flat land. The one you posted has a hill. Our sign was a V type."
