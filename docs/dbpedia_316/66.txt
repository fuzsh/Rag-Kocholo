Thunderbird Films has acquired Canadian reality TV producer Great Pacific Media to get into the unscripted space.

Terms of the acquisition deal were not disclosed, but Vancouver-based Great Pacific, launched in 2010 by president Blair Reekie and CEO Mark Miller, will get Thunderbird into reality, lifestyle and TV formats for the international market.

Great Pacific series include Discovery Canada’s Highway Thru Hell, which also airs on National Geographic Channel in Europe, Africa and Asia and on The Weather Channel in the U.S. Upcoming 2015 series include the documentary series Airshow for Discovery Canada and Game of Homes for W Network, where four couples compete to save four houses from the wrecking ball.

“Mark is a terrific writer/producer/showrunner who, together with Blair, has built an enviable business in a relatively short period of time,” Ivan Fecan, Thundebird executive chair, said in a statement Wednesday. Vancouver-based Thunderbird has until now focused on scripted TV production via an earlier acquisition of Reunion Pictures and running a 50-50 TV studio with Lionsgate Entertainment.
