Thunderbird is a rapidly growing Vancouver-based TV and film production company with offices in Los Angeles, Toronto and London.

The Thunderbird is a mythological creature born from the rich narrative tradition of Canada’s First Nations people in the Pacific Northwest. The Thunderbird is often carved at the top of totem poles, which bring communities together to illustrate their stories. The artwork, which depicts abstract elements of the Thunderbird legend, was commissioned from First Nations artist Corrine Hunt for Vancouver-based television production company Thunderbird. Hunt, also the co-creator of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic medals, captures the story of the company’s namesake, while honouring her roots and cultivating a refreshing artistic expression.
