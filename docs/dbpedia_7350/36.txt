American football, or gridiron, is a sport most widely played in the United States and Canada. It is a team game that requires physical strength and agility as well as strategy and finesse to be successful. In a typical match of American football, two teams of eleven players each compete against one another by attempting to propel an oblong ball into the other team's end zone or kick it through an upright goalpost while trying to stop the opposition from doing this themselves.

The team with the highest score after four quarters of play wins; overtime may be necessary when scores are tied. Although often viewed as violent due to its physical nature, American football is actually highly regulated, with rules dictating elements of play, including downs (possessions), snap formation, blocking, tackling, and use of certain formations such as passing and punt return formations. It's no wonder American Football continues to gain popularity among its fans and players.
