        "text": "When watching American football, either college football or the National Football League, it can be overwhelming with how many players are on the field. Each player on the field has a specific job they must accomplish each play. So, how many players are on a football team?\n\nThere are 53 players on a football team that stand on the sideline. During the game, only 11 players on offense and 11 players on defense can be on the field at one time. There can be no more than 22 players on the field at once.\n\nIn this article, we will show you what each position in American football is responsible for and how they contribute to the overall success of the offense & defense.\n\nNFL Team roster only allows 53 players to be on an active roster. Any NFL team that has more than 53 players must cut them or trade them.\n\nIn football, 11 players on the offense and 11 on the defense make up the 22 players on the field during play.\n\nThe offense uses its 11 players to score points against the 11 defensive players. All 11 players are treated differently, as each player on both the offense and the defense has a particular role and task they must do each play. If you’re interested in learning more about football, we have multiple football resources here.\n\nFor youth football, teams are often capped at 30-40 players.\n\nHigh school football teams typically don’t have cuts. If they have cuts, teams will carry about 100 players on their entire roster.\n\nCollege football teams will often carry 100-120 players on their roster. It may vary based on coaches and programs.\n\nBelow is a table of all the offensive players on the football field and the names often referred to by announcers and fans.\n\nQuarterback (QB)\n\nOne of the most critical players on the field, the quarterback, starts the play. They are responsible for either handing the ball off, running, or throwing it to another player.\n\nThe quarterback is crucial to an offense because of the calm and poise to deliver the football to the appropriate player.\n\nWhile most of us take for granted the passes that Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers make, this position is highly skilled. It requires the brain to process information fast but with fast reflexes and proper decision-making.\n\nQuarterbacks who often make poor decisions will more likely than not lead their team to a losing record.\n\nLearn More About Quarterbacks Here\n\nRunning Back (RB)\n\nTeams will often feature one or two running backs in their offense. It depends on what kind of system they run and how they want to attack the opposing defense.\n\nThe running back position is often next to or behind the quarterback. This player is responsible for running the football and receiving the quarterback’s hand-off.\n\nThis player is often one of the fastest and toughest players on the field, as when they run the football, they are almost certain to get tackled by the defense. These players must absorb physical contact and continue to run the ball.\n\nThey are also responsible for taking fakes from the quarterback, such as play-action fakes.\n\nExamples of running backs in the NFL are Ezekiel Elliot and Christian McCaffrey.\n\nLearn More About Running Backs Here\n\nWide Receivers (WR)\n\nThe wide receiver position is becoming increasingly popular as more teams throw the football. The benefit of throwing the football down the field is it forces defenses to cover the entire field.\n\nWide receivers are often taller (or smaller) players with both speed and catching ability. These players must catch the football without the fear of getting hit by a defensive player.\n\nA wide receiver and a slot receiver are also responsible for catching the football but line up closer to the offensive line.\n\nLearn the difference between running backs and wide receivers here.\n\nLearn More About Wide Receivers Here\n\nTight End (TE)\n\nThe next offensive position is a tight end. A tight end is a hybrid between an offensive lineman and an offensive tackle.\n\nThey need to be big enough to block defensive linemen and athletic enough to catch the football and run away from linebackers.\n\nWhile this is a rare body type, players like Rob Gronkowski have flourished in the position and consistently give defenses trouble.\n\nLearn more about the tight-end position here.\n\nOffensive Line (OL)\n\nThe offensive line will have five players in the same spot pretty much every time. These players are responsible for protecting the quarterback.\n\nOffensive line positions are broken down by offensive tackle, offensive guard, and center. The center is the position that puts his hand on the ball to snap it to the quarterback. The center is responsible for starting the play and protecting the quarterback.\n\nThe offensive guards are located on both sides of the center. The tackles are located outside of the guards. The guard and tackle positions are instrumental for an offense to be effective.\n\nThey must protect the quarterback and move defensive tackles and defensive ends off the football to make room for the running back.\n\nLearn More About Offensive Linemen Here\n\nBelow is a table of all the offensive players on the football field and the names often referred to by announcers and fans.\n\nDefensive Tackles (DT)\n\nDefensive tackles are defensive players who play either against the guards or the center. These players are responsible for getting after the quarterback and disrupting the running back.\n\nDefensive tackles are often more prominent in stature, as they can clog up gaps and force the offense to run the ball to the outside.\n\nDefensive tackles differ based on the defensive scheme that the defensive coordinator plays. Often, teams running a four-defensive lineman set will have two defensive ends, a nose guard, and a defensive tackle.\n\nLearn More About Defensive Line Here\n\nDefensive Ends (DE)\n\nDefensive ends are also part of the defensive line (along with the defensive tackles). These players often line up head up or outside of the offensive tackles. They are responsible for attacking the quarterback from outside of the offensive line.\n\nDefensive ends are essential because they force offenses to stretch the ball farther to the sideline. In the passing game, defensive tackles ensure the quarterback stays in the pocket and doesn’t scramble.\n\nPopular defensive ends in the NFL are Von Miller & Chase Henry, who significantly impact the game.\n\nLearn More About Defensive Line Here\n\nLinebackers (LB)\n\nLinebackers are often known as the captain of the defense. These players get their names for where they line up, in the back of the defensive line.\n\nLinebackers are responsible for playing both the run and the pass. These players need to be well versed in tackling and covering wide receivers.\n\nRay Lewis exemplified what it means to be a linebacker. Tough, hard-hitting, and leadership are the few words that come to mind when thinking of ideal traits for a linebacker.\n\nThe linebackers are often broken into the Mike Linebacker, Sam Linebacker, and Will Linebacker.\n\nLearn More About Linebackers Here\n\nCornerbacks (CB)\n\nThe following two positions are often grouped as “defensive backs.” The first defensive back is the cornerback. The cornerback is the player that lines up closest to the sideline.\n\nThis player is often the fastest on the defense and is responsible for covering speedy wide receivers.\n\nCornerbacks are often tasked with playing man-to-man coverage or even zone coverage.\n\nAlthough the cornerback position is one of the easiest positions to learn, it’s one of the most challenging to play football.\n\nLearn More About Defensive Back Here\n\nStrong Safety (SS)\n\nThe next defensive back position is safety. The two safety positions are often broken into two types: strong safety and free safety. Learn more about what a DB in football is here.\n\nStrong safety is a mix between a linebacker and free safety. This player must be agile enough to play defensive back, hard-hitting, and tough enough to play linebacker.\n\nTeams will use a strong safety position if they feel like they have a player who fits the mold.\n\nLearn More About Safeties In Football\n\nFree Safety (FS)\n\nThe next position is the free safety. This player is responsible for making sure no big plays happen. They are essentially the safety valve of the defense. If the running back on the offense makes a few players missing by chance, it’s up to the safety to tackle him.\n\nSafeties play a vital role, as the defense’s safety insurance ensures the offense doesn’t score a touchdown.\n\nKnowing about gameplay is one thing, but there’s so much more to learn about football! Don’t worry, we’re here to help!\n\nNFL Teams are constantly rotating rosters to stay under the 53 player limit. Injuries happen frequently which cause teams to keep more or less position players.\n\nThe more versatile players are (like offensive linemen), who can play multiple positions, the more valuable they are to the team.\n\nIf you like learning about football, we recommend you check out our Beginners Guide To Football below.
