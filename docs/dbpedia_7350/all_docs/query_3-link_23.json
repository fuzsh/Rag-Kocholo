        "text": "Life skills can be learned in a number of ways such as working at a job, listening through classes, or practicing application. What many people don't know is that being a part of a sports team can develop and further your life skills, whether you're a child or an adult. We've outlined six ways that participating in adult recreational sports can develop your life skills.\n\n1.Teamwork\n\nAlthough this seems a bit obvious, there is a reason that the people you play with are called your team. Teamwork is the base of any sport and without it, you will not succeed. Your team is filled with people who are all driving toward the same goal. In sports, teamwork helps motivate people to play hard, train hard, and compete.\n\nIn your everyday life, teamwork from sports will transfer and give you a sense of how important collaboration and cooperation are. Growing your team skills will have a positive impact on coordinating group projects, engaging with others, and staying motivated to improve. Being part of a team also develops soft skills like communication and goal-setting.\n\nAdults that are a part of multiple teams allow lessons and teamwork to shine in different environments which can encourage adaptability and change. They may have the leadership role on one team, but the follower role on another which will promote learning.\n\nAt The Nook, there are many activities offered that can help strengthen your bond with your teammates; whether it's a sports team or a work team.\n\n2.Communication\n\nCommunication is key. That phrase is equally important in everyday life as it is in the sport world. Different ways of communicating are helpful in conveying different types of messages, but in sports, interpersonal communication is the most important. Interpersonal communication uses face-to-face communication and nonverbal cues to get the point across which plays an important role in sports and business. Without being able to convey play calls or quickly adapt to a situation, a team will have no hope of victory.\n\nIn the workplace, communication skills are helpful in discussing ideas, motivating others, and addressing a job well done. You will undoubtedly come across people who you don't mesh well with and have to work with them. This happens often in sports, when off the field, teammates bicker, but when on the field, they put those differences aside and work together.\n\nBeing able to put personal preferences aside and effectively communicate with everyone will lead your work team to success. After all, a team is made up of more than just you so sometimes you must recognize that the name on the front of the jersey is more important than the one on the back.\n\nWhether your communication skills are strong or lacking, there is always room to improve. Joining an adult league or adult recreational sport can sharpen your communication skills and fine-tune the delivery of information.\n\n3.Leadership\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest skills that employers look for is leadership experience. Athletes understand the importance of a strong leader and know that success comes from strong direction and specific goals. In sports, the leader is meant to make tough decisions and inspire teammates, but leadership skills don't just come from those in charge. Any team member that proves their dedication through hard work and time displays leadership skills.\n\nPeople have experienced both sides of the coin; they've led and they've been led. The more experience you have in both, the better off you'll be. More experience means knowing how to rally people together towards a common goal and how to solve problems as they arise.\n\n4.Time Management\n\nThe first three skills are almost irrelevant if time management isn't adopted. If there is no organization, strategy, or prioritizing, then a team will fail. Sports give people the chance to create strategies for winning and sometimes this means honing in on specific skills and having others take back seat. It all depends on what your team is struggling the most with. This doesn't mean that the other skills are neglected, they just aren't the priority.\n\nAlong with strategy, athletes learn to juggle practice, team meetings, work, and life all at once. This directly translates into balancing a work-life balance. Knowing how to handle multiple things at a time while meeting deadlines is a huge asset in the workplace. You will always have several tasks that need completed and determining which need to be completed first is an important skill to have.\n\nAdults who are a part of a recreational team often find that they feel less stressed and enjoy the break from \"adulting\". Sports help with time management while working and they help with getting some much needed time in a happy, stimulating environment.\n\n5.Self-Discipline\n\nSelf-discipline is one of the hardest things to have. With nearly everything being so accessible and available at any time, it is difficult to have the patience or the discipline to focus. Sports gives people an implementation of self discipline. This can range from perfecting a batting stance to having more endurance. In order to improve, each skill requires a head-on attempt.\n\nThe same thing is true with work. Nobody is perfect which means that there is always something to enhance. In order to improve and be successful, you need self-discipline and focus. People who know how to concentrate are more likely to be diligent and engaged at work.\n\n6.Exercise and Socializing\n\nJoining a sports team gives you a unique set of friends. These are people you may only see when you play together or they could turn into life-long friends you see quite often. Being a part of a team is an easy way to get to know new people and because you're on the same team, you'll be spending a good amount of time together. Playing on a team builds meaningful relationships and this can improve your social and communication skills.\n\nBeing on an adult sports team will also keep you active. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that in order to stay healthy, most adults need about two and a half hours of activity a week. Playing sports is a great way to check off exercise for the day. This works well for people who hate the gym or don't know where to start."
