        "text": "After reading this lesson, you should be able to:\n\nunderstand how groups are structured,\n\nexplain how to create an effective team climate,\n\ndescribe how to maximize individual performance in team sports,\n\nunderstand social loafing and the conditions under which it is more likely to occur,\n\ndefine task and social cohesion,\n\ndescribe the conceptual model of cohesion,\n\nunderstand the cohesion–performance relationship, and\n\nidentify guidelines for building team cohesion.\n\nIt isn’t necessarily the talent on a team that makes it great, people have said, but how that talent is blended. Michael Jordan made just this point when he said, “Talent wins games, but teamwork wins championships”. We often see talented teams perform poorly, failing to use the resources of their individual members, whereas other teams with less talent and fewer resources succeed. Teamwork and group dynamics play an important role in the success of teams and groups. Team members in sport and exercise settings must interact, work toward shared goals, adapt to environmental demands, and balance individual needs with those of other team members. Certainly, part of teamwork and group dynamics is what is called group (team) cohesion. In team sports, forming a cohesive unit appears to contribute to success on the field.\n\nThe following information is related to the Spencer Institute Sports Psychology Coach Certification training course…\n\nOne example is the Chicago Cubs; by winning Major League Baseball’s 2016 World Series, the Cubs broke a drought of over 100 years without a championship. Many players discussed the “closeness” of the players and coaching staff as everyone sacrificed individual glory for team success. The notion of a cohesive unit is not reserved only for team sports. For example, Darren Clarke, from the victorious 2004 Ryder Cup European golf team noted, “We played as a team, we dined as a team, we talked as a team, and we won as a team.” Furthermore, group cohesion is important in exercise groups. Research shows that positive group feelings and interactions among exercisers are critical for individuals adhering to exercise programs (Spink & Carron, 1992). This lesson focuses on team dynamics, including such things as group development, group structure, group efficiency, and the cohesiveness of groups and how they interact (or don’t interact) effectively and efficiently.\n\nRecognizing the Difference Between Groups and Teams\n\nYou may think it’s easy to define a group or a team, but the differentiation can be quite complex. For example, social psychologists define a group as two or more people who interact with, and exert mutual influence on, each other. This is also taught in detail in the Spencer Institute Life Strategies Coach training program. A sense of mutual interaction or interdependence for a common purpose distinguishes a group from a mere collection of individuals. Along these lines, a volleyball team that trains together every morning before school shares a common objective (training) and interacts with each other in formal ways (warming up for competition) and thus is considered a group. Conversely, several people might decide to get together on Thursday nights to go to volleyball games, which is not strictly a group because they do not interact with each other in a structured manner. In essence, a collection of individuals is not necessarily a group—and a group is not necessarily a team. So, how are groups and teams similar, and what distinguishes a group from a team?\n\nFor both groups and teams, members may like and be attracted to other members. Members of a group may have common goals (e.g., all people in a fitness class may want to lose weight and tone muscle). Members of groups and members of teams, then, have characteristics in common. But a sport team is really a special type of group. Apart from having the defining properties of mutual interaction and task interdependence, teams have four key characteristics:\n\nCollective sense of identity: “we-ness” rather than “I-ness”\n\nDistinctive roles: all members know their job\n\nStructured modes of communication: lines of communication\n\nNorms: social rules that guide members on what to do and not do\n\nAlthough teamwork is important for success in sport, what exactly does teamwork mean? From a definitional point of view, teamwork can be viewed as a dynamic process involving a collaborative effort by team members to effectively carry out the independent and interdependent behaviors that are required to maximize a team’s likelihood of achieving its purposes (McEwan & Beauchamp, 2014). These authors present a model of teamwork in which its two main components are team maintenance and the regulation of team performance. Team maintenance refers to behaviors that function to keep the 176 team together, and the regulation of team performance comprises behaviors devoted to the achievement of team goals.\n\nThe management of team maintenance consists of two processes: psychological support and integrative conflict management. Psychological support refers to the voluntary assistance that team members provide to reinforce a sense of well-being for teammates and is like social support (discussed later in this lesson). It is essential to create a supportive team environment so that team members can feel comfortable asking for support and taking the initiative to support other teammates. Research also shows that teams should work together to provide communal support instead of simply one- on-one support.\n\nIntegrative conflict management refers to teams working through interpersonal problems to prevent prolonged conflict, which often leads to decreased team performance. It is not so much a matter of whether conflicts arise, but whether they are dealt with in an effective manner. Recommendations for resolving intrateam conflict include conducting team-building exercises, establishing clear player roles and expectations, holding structured team meetings, and addressing conflicts immediately.\n\nIdentifying Three Theories of Group Development\n\nAs noted, a group of individuals does not necessarily form a team. Although all teams are groups, not all groups can be considered teams. A team is any group of people who must interact with each other to accomplish shared objectives. Becoming a team, however, is really an evolutionary process. Teams are constantly developing and changing in their attempts to respond to both internal and external factors. Let’s take a closer look at how a group becomes a team. To study team development, people have put forth different theories. These theories fall into three categories: linear theory, which holds that groups develop in stages or in a linear fashion; cyclical theory, which holds that groups follow a cyclical pattern; and pendular theory, which holds that groups develop in a pendulum-like manner.\n\nLinear Perspective\n\nIn the linear perspective, the assumption is that groups move progressively through different stages. Critical issues arise in each stage, and when the issues are successfully dealt with, the group moves on. Groups go through four stages as they develop and prepare to carry out the group’s tasks: forming, storming, norming, and performing. Although most groups go through all four stages, the duration of each stage and the sequence that the stages follow may vary from one group to another in the process of team development.\n\nIn this first stage of team development, forming, team members familiarize themselves with other team members. Members of a team engage in social comparisons, assessing one another’s strengths and weaknesses. For example, athletes might compare the amount of playing time they get with other athletes’ playing time. Individuals also try to determine whether they belong in the group and, if so, in what role.\n\nThe second stage of team formation, storming, is characterized by resistance to the leader, resistance to control by the group, and interpersonal conflict. Great emotional resistance emerges, and infighting can occur as individuals and the leader establish their roles and status in the group. In this stage, sport or exercise leaders need to communicate with participants objectively and openly.\n\nDuring norming, the third stage, hostility is replaced by solidarity and cooperation. Conflicts are resolved, and a sense of unity forms. Instead of watching out for their individual well-being, the athletes work together to reach common goals. Instead of competing for status or recognition, players strive for economy of effort and task effectiveness.\n\nIn the final stage, performing, team members band together to channel their energies for team success. The team focuses on problem solving, using group processes and relationships to work on tasks and test new ideas. Structural issues are resolved, interpersonal relationships stabilize, and roles are well defined.\n\nCyclical (Life Cycle) Perspective\n\nLife cycle models have in common the assumption that groups develop in a manner like the life cycle of individuals—experiencing birth, growth, and death. Life cycle models are distinguished from linear models in their emphasis on the terminal phase before group dissolution. The main element in the cyclical approach to group development is the assumption that as the group develops, it psychologically prepares for its own breakup. This model has relevance for groups in physical activity in that exercise groups, for example, last approximately 10 to 15 weeks. Similarly, recreational teams typically play for a season (e.g., fall, winter, spring, or summer) and then break up.\n\nPendular Perspective\n\nMost of the earlier linear and life cycle models were based on the underlying assumption that groups possess an inherent static development that is unresponsive to the demands of the environment. The pendular models emphasize the shifts that occur in interpersonal relationships during the growth and development of groups. The assumption is that a group does not move progressively through stages in a linear fashion from the instant it forms. The pendular model has five stages:\n\nOrientation: Cohesion and feelings of unity are high.\n\nDifferentiation and conflict: Teams subdivide into smaller groups and conflicts arise as players compete for positions.\n\nResolution and cohesion: Cohesion increases as group members share common concerns and feelings.\n\nDifferentiation and conflict: Team unity is weakened as some individuals are rewarded while others are punished.\n\nTermination: With team success, feelings of cohesion are high. If the season was unsuccessful, then feelings of cohesion are low.\n\nUnderstanding Group Structure\n\nEvery group develops its own structure, which begins to emerge even at the group’s first meeting. A group’s structure depends largely on the interactions of its members—how they perceive one another and what they expect of themselves and each other. For a group of individuals to become an effective team, certain structural characteristics must develop. Two of the most important are group roles and group norms.\n\nThe topic of group structure in sports and fitness is also discussed in detail in the Spencer Institute’s Youth Performance Coach Certification course.\n\nGroup Roles\n\nA role consists of the set of behaviors required or expected of the person occupying a certain position in a group. Teachers, parents, athletic trainers, corporate executives, and health professionals, for example, all have specific roles in their professions and in society. Coaches, for instance, are expected to perform such behaviors as teaching, organizing practices, and interacting with other school officials and to be good role models. Similarly, head athletic trainers and personal fitness trainers are expected to perform such behaviors as assigning and evaluating student trainers and to provide clinical evaluations for serious injuries.\n\nFormal Versus Informal Roles\n\nTwo types of roles exist in any group or team: formal roles and informal roles. Formal roles are dictated by the nature and structure of the organization. Athletic director, coach, team captain, exercise leader, and the like are examples of specific formal roles in a sport or an exercise organization. Point guard in basketball, setter in volleyball, goalie in hockey, and other formal positions all have specific performance roles in a team. Each of these roles carries specific associated expectations. When athletes approached or exceeded their social involvement expectations, they reported higher levels of social cohesion (interpersonal attraction). From an applied perspective, coaches should find a way to improve the quality of athletes’ roles, such as providing members with meaningful opportunities to contribute to or become socially involved with the team. For example, when appointing or electing a captain, a coach could specify the specific behaviors expected of this position.\n\nRole Clarity\n\nYou can improve a team’s effectiveness by making sure players understand (role clarity) and accept (role acceptance) their roles. For example, role ambiguity has been found to have an effect on coach–athlete relationships. Athletes who perceived greater ambiguity in their offensive or defensive roles were more critical of their coach’s ability to lead the team during competition. In addition, research has indicated that understanding one’s role is critical to being effective in that role. Along these lines, one of the probable reasons for the success of the National Basketball Association’s Golden State Warriors is that players accept their roles. Although Steph Curry leads the team, other talented players such as Draymond Green (defense and rebounding) and Klay Thompson (shooting) fulfill their roles on the team. Furthermore, when superstar Kevin Durant was traded to the team, he fit in, and he functions collaboratively within the team concept.\n\nPeople in a specific role usually have a different perspective on the role’s requirements than do other members of the group. Unclear roles hurt a team’s performance. If two players on the same basketball team both think their role is to direct the team’s offense, conflict will likely result over who brings the ball up court. Similarly, an athletic trainer and team doctor must agree on their roles so that athletes and coaches know whom to see for injury evaluation and whom to see for decisions on playing availability. Sometimes individuals’ performances can blur their roles on a team. A National Hockey League coach once observed that the worst thing that could happen to a team is to have its enforcer score a few goals in consecutive games. The enforcer would then begin to think of his role as a scorer, to the detriment of the team.\n\nAn effective goal-setting program can clarify roles. Helping players set goals in specific areas gives the players direction and focus. If a football coach wanted a defensive lineman to focus on stopping the run instead of on sacking the quarterback, setting a specific goal would clarify the lineman’s role. See “Role Clarity and Ambiguity in Teams” for more information.\n\nRole Acceptance\n\nRole acceptance is also important for enhancing a group’s structure. Although role acceptance is generally related to role performance, this is not always the case. For example, athletes may accept a role even though the assigned responsibilities may exceed their capabilities, leading to subpar performance. Therefore, coaches need to be able to determine whether athletes are failing to accept their role responsibilities or whether the athletes are being asked to perform role responsibilities that exceed their level of ability.\n\nPlayers who don’t start or don’t get significant playing time can easily feel left out and confused about their contribution to the team. Coaches can help players accept their roles by minimizing the status differences among roles and emphasizing that the success of the team depends on everyone’s contribution. Role acceptance appears to depend on four conditions: opportunity to use specialized skills or competencies, feedback and role recognition, role significance, and autonomy (the opportunity to work independently).\n\nFor example, players are more willing to accept and carry out their roles when they perceive that their responsibilities contribute to team success. For many years, Dean Smith, former basketball coach at the University of North Carolina, fostered the acceptance of the role of his reserves by playing them as a second unit in actual games for a short period of time. The reserves knew they were going to play in the game (even if for a short period), and they developed pride in trying to keep or extend a lead or reduce a deficit while giving the starters a rest.\n\nRole Conflict\n\nRole conflict exists when the role occupant doesn’t have sufficient ability, motivation, time, or understanding to achieve that goal despite the presence of consensus on a 180 desired goal or outcome. There are many types of role conflict, but a typical one is the conflict of “wearing too many hats” and having different people expect different things (i.e., roles) from you. The following quote from a 36-year-old nontraditional college athlete and mother of two children illustrates this type of role conflict.\n\n“The whole week my son was sick. I hardly trained at all . . .I would have to wait until my husband came home from work, but sometimes he would work a double shift so I would get no running in. So not only was my training hurt but I missed several classes because I had to stay home with my son.”\n\nGroup Norms\n\nA norm is a level of performance, pattern of behavior, or belief. Norms can be either formally established or informally developed by a group. Individuals usually receive pressure to adhere to their group’s norms, whether the norm is seen as relevant or irrelevant. For example, rookies (especially with professional teams) are often expected to carry the bags for the veterans. For men who play sports such as football and hockey, there is a strong social norm to be tough, aggressive, and competitive, and negative consequences (e.g., cut from the team or ostracized) can occur if a player does not embrace these norms. Although this tough behavior may not appear functional, it is often the norm to indoctrinate new players onto the team. “Pressure of Social Norms” presents a famous research example.\n\nOn a sport team, the norm might involve practice behaviors, dress and hairstyle, the interactions between rookies and veterans, or who takes control in critical situations. Deviation from the expected behaviors might result in informal or formal sanctions. For example, in the movie Chariots of Fire, the British sprinter Harold Abrahams, who was training for the 1924 Olympics, was chided by his Cambridge colleagues for hiring a professional trainer because this meant he was too serious about his running and not really an amateur any longer. In essence, he did not adhere to the social norms of his day.\n\nNorm for Productivity\n\nThe standard for effort and performance accepted by the team is called the norm for productivity. For example, in a corporate fitness program, members of a fitness club may all exercise at lunch for 30 minutes; this then becomes an expectation for new members. In a sport setting, the captain or top performer on a team is often a role model who sets the norm of productivity. For example, Hilary Knight is often considered the best player on the 2017 U.S. Women’s Hockey Team. Despite her skill and high profile, she is usually the first to practice and the last to leave. If your best player is putting in this effort, then the rest of the team often follows.\n\nPositive Norms\n\nBecause norms can have powerful effects on behavior, it is imperative for a coach, teacher, or exercise leader to establish positive group norms or standards. One effective method for creating positive norms is to enlist the formal and informal leaders of a team to set positive examples. Top athletes such as LeBron James, Tom Brady, Novak Djokovic, and Simone Biles create high standards for their teammates and others in their sport through their incredible work ethic and practice regimens. But often the coach or teacher needs to encourage leaders to set high standards of achievement. Whenever possible, include all team members in decision making about norms adopted by the team. In addition, Van Bussel and Gregg (2014) note that norms must be clear if conformity to the norm is to be enhanced. For example, a team norm of arriving to practice 10 minutes early is clear. However, a norm of players giving their best effort during training is ambiguous because some players may interpret this as giving 100% effort, whereas others think 80% is best because they want to save themselves for the game the following day.\n\nGender Differences in Team Norms\n\nResearch has found that female teams had a better understanding of norms for competition, practice, and social settings than male teams. This is not surprising because females have demonstrated that they hold stronger perceptions for social values such as belongingness than males do. This might have something to do with males playing more often in contact and collision sports (e.g., football, hockey) where there may be fewer social norms than in individual sports and other noncontact team sports (e.g., volleyball, softball). From an applied perspective, coaches of male teams should consider strategies such as team goal setting and team building to help set appropriate team norms (Bloom & Stevens, 2002).\n\nCreating an Effective Team Climate\n\nTeam climate develops from how players perceive the interrelationships among the group members. The players’ perceptions and evaluations set the team’s climate. Still, the coach has the final say on establishing team climate (although players do not necessarily have to buy into the coach’s approach). Some factors of team climate are more easily changed than others, but all can influence the effective functioning of a group (Zander, 1982).\n\nSocial Support\n\n“I had so much help. So many people believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself. So many people . . . motivated me every single day to be who I am. I failed so many times and got back up. I’ve been through the toughest times with my family, but I’m still standing. . . .When you’ve got people behind you, you can do anything.”\n\nThe previous quote highlights the importance that social support can have on an athlete’s (or anyone’s) life. Social support refers to “an exchange of resources between at least two individuals perceived by the provider or the recipient to be intended to enhance the well- being of the recipient” (Shumaker & Brownell, 1984, p. 13). Research has revealed that social support can have a positive effect on a variety of behaviors and feelings such as recovery from injury, coping with stress, burnout, youth physical activity, and performance (Freeman, Rees, & Hardy, 2009; Rees, 2007). In addition, social support has been linked to increases in feelings of team cohesion and team climate. Along these lines, Mike Krzyzewski, men’s basketball coach at Duke University, says the first thing he does at the beginning of the season is make sure all his players fit into the team concept and support each other (2009). “Building an Effective Team Climate Through Social Support” lists the types of social support and ways to enhance each of them.\n\nSocial support is not always effective in helping the individual receiving the support. Along these lines, Rees (2016) suggests five ways to make social support most effective.\n\nThe effectiveness of social support may depend on the initial levels of perceived support. Specifically, athletes reporting low levels of perceived support will usually benefit the most from the subsequent provision of support.\n\nSocial support may depend on its match to the situation. Certain types of support may be better for certain situations. For example, it appears that when athletes are dealing with uncontrollable events, emotional support seems most effective. However, when dealing with controllable events, personal assistance support seems most effective.\n\nSocial support may depend on the context of the situation. F or example, in performance settings, emotional support or listening support seems most effective because it is less threatening than information that could create too much thinking about other things, which can interfere with a total focus on the task.\n\nTiming of support appears important. Support is more effective when an athlete has appraised the situation and asked for support than when support is provided before it has been requested.\n\nThe level of knowledge and expertise of the provider is also important. Athletes are more receptive to receiving support (and the specific type of support) from individuals they perceive as knowledgeable in a specific area of support. For example, receiving support more informational in nature may be better received if coming from a coach than a parent.\n\nProximity\n\nPeople are more likely to bond when they are near each other. Although physical proximity alone does not usually develop a team concept, close contact with teammates promotes interaction, which in turn can hasten the group’s development. Locker rooms, team training tables, and road trips ensure proximity. Some college coaches promote team unity by having athletes live together in a residence hall. In youth sports, car or bus trips and fund-raisers such as car washes often help build a positive team climate by providing opportunities for players to get to know one another better. These interactions, combined with a similarity of attitudes, can help establish team identity.\n\nDistinctiveness\n\nWhen a group feels distinct, its feelings of unity and oneness increase. In sport, distinctiveness is traditionally achieved through team uniforms and mottoes, special initiation rites, or special privileges. By making team members feel unique and distinct from other teams, a coach helps develop and mold a team concept. In exercise classes, Carron and Spink (1993) increased group\n\ndistinctiveness and built group cohesion in part by providing group T-shirts and creating special slogans for participants. Similarly, personal trainers might develop special logo shirts for people training at the same workout facility.\n\nFairness\n\nAn important component of team climate is trust, and at the core of trust is athletes’ perceptions that they are being treated fairly. Athletes should believe that their play, effort, and contributions to the team’s success are evaluated objectively and evenly.\n\nFairness, or lack of it, can bring a team close together or tear it apart. Coaches should deal with athletes honestly, openly, and fairly. Athletes need to believe they are treated fairly, even if they are not entirely happy with certain decisions. Some coaches do not pay much attention to their athletes’ feelings of fairness. This is unfortunate given the degree to which these feelings can transfer into negative actions, such as disruptive behavior or even quitting the team.\n\nSimilarity\n\nSimilarity among team members in commitments, attitudes, aspirations, and goals is important to developing a positive team climate. Team members usually differ in ethnicity, race, socioeconomic background, personality, and ability. But research has shown that factors such as socioeconomic background and playing experience are not necessarily important in building a team concept. However, it is up to the coach to get a diverse bunch of athletes working together for common and shared purposes. Specifically, the coach must develop similarity in attitudes, such as shared group performance goals, expectations for individual behavior, and clarity about various team roles.\n\nTask Interdependence\n\nA final way to improve team climate as well as increase performance is through outcome interdependence. In essence, outcome interdependence refers to the fact that all group members benefit (or suffer) from the group’s performance.\n\nAs coaches might say, the team wins together, and the team loses together. Interdependence has been shown to be a way to help manage a team’s conflict. Task conflict can turn out to be positive but “only when conflict is managed constructively and teams have high levels of openness, psychological safety, and within team trust. One way to promote task interdependence is to provide team-level appraisals to reinforce a common fate among team members. This promotes a feeling of interdependence because all teammates are responsible to each other, and everyone shares in the successes and failures.\n\nMaximizing Individual Performance in Team Sports\n\nCoaches are responsible for getting individual players to play together as a team, and they must understand how interactions among team members affect performance on the athletic field or court. Most coaches and sport psychologists agree that a group of the best individuals usually does not make the best team. Take the 1997 National Collegiate Athletic Association men’s basketball tournament, for example. The two finalists, Kentucky and Utah, had lost their top players, all-Americans Keith Van Horn and Ron Mercer (both of whom were selected very high in the first round of the NBA draft). Yet, with less talent, the teams were able to reach the pinnacle of college basketball because of the teamwork and individual sacrifice of the returning players.\n\nSteiner’s Model of Actual Productivity\n\nIvan Steiner developed a model to show the relationship between individual abilities or resources on a team and how team members interact. Steiner’s model is shown by this equation:\n\nActual productivity = potential productivity − losses attributable to faulty group processes\n\nPotential productivity refers to a team’s possible best performance, given each player’s ability, knowledge, and skill (both mental and physical) as well as the demands of the task. According to Steiner’s model, individual ability is probably the most important resource for sport teams—thus, the team made up of the best individuals will usually achieve the most success.\n\nHowever, Steiner’s model implies that a team’s actual productivity does not usually match its potential productivity. Only when a team effectively uses its available resources to match the demands of the task will its actual productivity or performance approach its potential performance and the group themselves often coordinates these resources. However, a group’s actual performance usually falls short of its potential productivity because of faulty group processes.\n\nTherefore, we might predict that one team will perform better than the other team under the following circumstances:\n\nTeam A possesses more ability (resources) than team B while experiencing equal process losses (losses caused by putting forth submaximal effort).\n\nTeam A possesses ability equal to that of team B but has fewer losses attributable to faulty group processes.\n\nThis prediction suggests that the role of any coach is to increase relevant resources (through training, instruction, and recruiting) while at the same time reducing process losses (by enhancing cohesion and emphasizing individuals’ contributions to the team concept).\n\nTwo kinds of losses are attributable to faulty group processes: motivation losses and coordination losses. Motivation losses occur when team members do not give 100% effort. Perhaps players believe that one or two stars can carry the load; thus, the other players slacken their efforts. Coordination losses occur when the timing between teammates is off or when ineffective strategies are used. For example, a coordination loss occurs in a doubles match in tennis when the ball is hit right down the middle of the court and neither player goes for it because each thinks the other will take it.\n\nSports that require complex interaction or cooperation (e.g., basketball, soccer, football, or volleyball) are more susceptible to coordination losses than are sports requiring fewer interactions and less coordination (e.g., swimming or track and field). Basketball, soccer, and volleyball coaches typically spend much time and effort on fine-tuning coordination, timing, and team movement patterns. Swimming coaches, in contrast, spend most of their time developing individual swimming technique.\n\nDifferent terms have been developed to distinguish between tasks that require coordination among team members and those that do not. Knowledge required to perform a task is known as taskwork knowledge, and knowledge required where coordination is needed to perform a task is known as teamwork knowledge. For example, a quarterback in football must acquire taskwork knowledge to be able to throw a pass accurately to a receiver. However, the successful completion of the pass also relies on teamwork knowledge of both the quarterback and receiver: They both must read the defense the same way and anticipate what the other is going to do. When Peyton Manning signed as a free agent with Denver in 2012, nobody knew how quickly he would develop teamwork knowledge in Denver—he certainly had it in Indianapolis—because he was throwing to a whole new set of receivers. However, to no one’s surprise, he developed teamwork knowledge very quickly.\n\nIt appears that in sports in which more cooperation and interaction are necessary, the importance of individual ability decreases and the importance of group process increases. When teams of only two people play, they apparently work together best if they are close in ability because they are more likely to fully use their combined abilities (Gill, 2000). In tennis, when a superior player is paired with an inferior player, the better player will often try to do too much. Similarly, experienced teams quickly identify and target a weaker player and hit the majority of shots to that person. Usually, the top doubles teams are made up of two very good players (e.g., Bob and Mike Bryan of the United States) who complement each other rather than one star and another adequate player who have trouble combining their skills.\n\nRingelmann Effect\n\nClearly, individual abilities do not neatly sum up to group or team performance. This is consistent with Steiner’s model, which holds that faulty group processes can reduce potential productivity. But what causes these losses, and how much potential productivity is lost? The answers to these questions began to emerge from an obscure, unpublished study on individual and group performance (the Ringelmann effect) on a rope-pulling task conducted by Ringelmann nearly 100 years ago (cited by Ingham, Levinger, Graves, & Peckham, 1974). Ringelmann observed individuals and groups of two, three, and eight people pulling on a rope. The task is based on a person giving 100% effort and thus pulling 100 pounds. If no losses attributable to faulty group processes occurred, then one could assume that everyone pulled 100 pounds. Therefore, groups of two, three, and eight would be able to pull 200, 300, and 800 pounds, respectively. However, the relative performance of each individual progressively declined as the number of people in the group increased. That is, two- person groups pulled 93% of their individual potential, three-person groups 85%, and eight- person groups only 49%.\n\nBecause some of the early methodology and descriptions had been incomplete in Ringelmann’s study, Ingham and colleagues (1974) attempted to replicate Ringelmann’s findings while extending the work. Ingham and colleagues first had individuals and groups of two, three, four, five, and six persons perform the rope-pulling task. Results were like those in Ringelmann’s study: Groups of two performed at 91% of their potential and groups of three at 82% of their potential. However, contrary to what Ringelmann found, increases in group size did not lead to corresponding decreases in efficiency. Rather, a general leveling-off occurred: Groups of six pulled at an average of 78% of their potential.\n\nIn a second study, Ingham and colleagues (1974) wanted to determine whether the losses resulting from increased group size were attributable to poor coordination or reduced motivation. To separate these two factors, the investigators reduced coordination losses by testing only one participant at a time, blindfolding the participant, and having trained helpers pretend to pull on the rope (participants thought the other members of the group were pulling on the rope, although they were not). Any decrease in performance was then primarily attributed to a loss in motivation (a slight amount of coordination loss that could not be controlled for still occurred) rather than a loss in coordination because only the real participant was pulling the rope.\n\nTwo other experiments used shouting and clapping as group tasks and found that the average sound that each person produced decreased from the solo performance to 71% in two-person groups, 51% in four-person groups, and 40% in six-person groups. When the scientists controlled for coordination, they found that two- person groups performed at 82% of their potential and six-person groups at 74% of their potential.\n\nSocial Loafing and Ways to Reduce It\n\nSocial loafing is the term psychologists use for the phenomenon in which individuals in a group or team put forth less than 100% effort because of losses in motivation due in large part to a diffusion of responsibility (expecting others to pick up the slack). Social loafing is like bystander effect, which is generally focused on people acting (or not acting) in helping others; this theory states that the more people who are available to act, the less likely anyone will actually act. In both cases, action does not occur or is significantly restrained due to the diffusion of responsibility previously noted.\n\nSocial loafing and bystander effect research began after the repeated stabbing of Kitty Genovese in 1964. She was stabbed outside her apartment building and was attacked again in the stairwell. Reports at the time alleged that dozens of witnesses saw or heard the attacks, but nobody called the police or tried to help. More recent investigations call into question the original reporting; however, the incident prompted research into the bystander effect and the development of the 911 emergency call system. The prevalence of social media adds a new angle to the bystander effect. For example, in 2017, a 15-year-old girl was raped while approximately 40 people watched on Facebook. No action was taken to try to help the girl or contact the authorities. Social loafing often happens when students are assigned to a group project. Specifically, students sometimes complain that only a couple of students are doing the work, while others are “just going along for the ride” (social loafing). If faculty members don’t build individual contribution (e.g., each member of the group is given a specific assignment) into the requirements, then social loafing is more likely to occur.\n\nIn terms of sports and motor skills, researchers have found social loafing effects in swimming, track, and cheerleading as well as in a wide variety of laboratory motor tasks. Numerous conditions seem to enhance the probability of social loafing. In testing these causes of increased social loafing, research has shown that the losses in individual productivity attributable to social loafing are greatest when the contributions of individual group members are not identified, are dispensable, or are disproportionate to the contributions of other group members. For example, offensive linemen in football might not block so hard if the running play is going in the direction opposite to where they are blocking. However, if they know that coaches will review the film of the game on Monday morning and that their lack of effort could be identified, they may block harder on each play regardless of the play’s direction. Thus, if individual contributions to the group product are monitored directly, social loafing should be reduced. In addition, when individuals perceive that their contributions are essential to the group’s productivity, social loafing should be reduced.\n\nReviews of the literature have revealed that social loafing occurs across a wide variety of tasks, including those that are physical (e.g., rope pulling, swimming), cognitive (e.g., generating ideas), perceptual (e.g., maze performance), and evaluative (e.g., quality of output). In addition, social loafing generalizes across many populations and cultures and across genders.\n\nFinally, social loafing is increased under the following conditions:\n\n✔ The individual’s output cannot be independently evaluated.\n\n✔ The task is perceived to be low on meaningfulness.\n\n✔ The individual’s personal involvement in the task is low.\n\n✔ A comparison against group standards is not possible.\n\n✔ The individuals contributing to the collective effort are strangers.\n\n✔ The individual’s teammates or coworkers are seen as high in ability.\n\n✔ The individual perceives that his contribution to the outcome is redundant.\n\n✔ The individual is competing against what she believes to be a weaker opponent.\n\n✔ The group is larger rather than smaller.\n\nIf athletes believe that social loafing is occurring on their team, even if it is not actually occurring, might they socially loaf as well? This notion of believing that social loafing is occurring has been termed perceived social loafing. One study examined the idea that perceived social loafing causes social loafing. The researchers found that when soccer players perceived social loafing among their teammates (i.e., they thought their teammates’ poor performance was attributable to poor effort), they also exerted less effort. Enhancing social support among teammates can build trust, which may in turn help reduce perceived social loafing. Using these findings, let’s look at specific examples, along with supporting research, of what sport and exercise leaders can do to reduce social loafing.\n\nEmphasize the Importance of Individual Pride and Unique Contributions\n\nWhen a sports psychology coach stresses the team concept, some players may not recognize the importance of their own contributions to the team. Everyone’s unique contribution to the team’s success should be communicated and highlighted whenever possible. In addition, all athletes should take responsibility for their own efforts and not assume that a teammate will take care of things. For example, a basketball player may play great defense and set good screens that open shots for his teammates. If the coach emphasizes to the player how important his contribution is to the success of the team, the player will likely put forth consistent effort and be more personally involved because he sees the importance of his contribution even though he scores only a few points.\n\nIncrease the Identifiability of Individual Performances\n\nThe most consistent finding across research studies points to identifiability as the most acceptable explanation for the social loafing phenomenon. As a result, social loafing may be eliminated when team members believe that their individual performances are identifiable (i.e., known to others) because players no longer feel anonymous. Studies of swimmers showed that they swam faster in relays than in individual events only when individual times in relays were announced (i.e., identifiability was high). However, swimmers swam slower in relays than in individual events when individual times in relays were not announced (i.e., identifiability was low). By evaluating the effort of participants as individuals, coaches, teachers, and exercise leaders make the participants aware of their concern and assure them that they are not lost in the crowd. For example, a fitness leader might call out the names of individuals doing a specific exercise or movement particularly well.\n\nFilming or using observational checklists at team sport practices or games can also provide increased identifiability. For example, at Ohio State University, the late Woody Hayes increased the identifiability of football linemen by filming and specifically grading each player on each play, providing “lineman of the week” honors, and awarding helmet decals to players who showed individual effort and performance. Include practices as well as games in the evaluation because many players don’t get a lot of actual game time.\n\nDetermine Specific Situations in Which Loafing May Occur\n\nThrough filming or other observations, Certifed Sports Psychology Coaches can determine what situations seem to elicit loafing. However, social loafing is sometimes appropriate. For example, a basketball center gets a rebound and throws an outlet pass to the guard but does not follow the ball down the floor. She is taking a rest on the offensive end, in effect, to make sure she is ready on the defensive end, which may be appropriate if she is tired. To better understand when social loafing might be appropriate, coaches should carefully analyze the dynamics and strategies involved in their sport. If changes need to be made, coaches should structure the practice sessions and competitions so that each player can economize efforts without interfering with team performance. For example, during a particularly tough part of the season, coaches might incorporate low-intensity practices into the schedule or complement high-intensity practices with fun activities. This will help keep players sharp and minimize their loafing.\n\nAssign Players to Other Positions\n\nAthletes should know not only their own role on the team but also the roles their teammates play. One of the best ways for players to gain an appreciation of their teammates and of how their own performance affects others on the team is to\n\nlearn about teammates’ positions. Talking about the unique challenges of other positions will help all players better understand the effect they have on other positions when they loaf. Coaches can help here by requiring athletes to spend a small period rotating to other positions to better understand their teammates’ contributions and to experience the potential effects of these contributions on other positions.\n\nDivide the Team in to Smaller Units\n\nForming subgroups in a team allows for greater recognition of the responsibility to others and helps develop a cohesive unit. Coaches should carefully monitor these subgroups and constantly reinforce the overall notion of team pride. Forming subgroups (e.g., defensive backs, offensive linemen, and receivers in football) can enhance feelings of group cohesion, which in turn leads to increased effort and commitment. Be careful, however, because placing too great an emphasis on subgroups at the expense of the larger group can result in the formation of destructive social cliques.\n\nAttribute Failure to Internal Unstable Factors\n\nAfter failure—especially consistent failure— teams often tend to give up and socially loaf because they start to attribute their failure to lack of ability, which is stable and internal. If a team feels they are not as good as the other team, they can start to put forth less than optimal effort because they start to ask, “What is the point in trying if the other team is better and we’ll lose anyway. Teams attribute failure to internal, controllable, unstable factors such as effort and poor strategy because these can be changed. This will encourage teams to give full effort and not loaf because they attribute previous losses to things that are under their control.\n\nDefinition of Cohesion in Team Sports\n\nIn 1950, Festinger, Schacter, and Back defined cohesion as “the total field of forces which act on members to remain in the group”. These authors believed that two distinct types of forces act on members in a group. The first class of forces, attractiveness of the group, refers to the individual’s desire for interpersonal interactions with other group members and a desire to be involved in the group’s activities. The second class of forces, means control, refers to the benefits that a member can derive by being associated with the group. For example, playing for a highly ranked college football team might increase an athlete’s recognition and value in the draft.\n\nSince 1950, several other definitions of group cohesion have been proposed, defining cohesion as “a dynamic process that is reflected in the tendency for a group to stick together and remain united in pursuit of its instrumental objectives and/or for the satisfaction of member affective needs”. This underscores the notion that cohesion is multidimensional (many factors are related to why a group sticks together), dynamic (cohesion in a group can change over time), instrumental (groups are created for a purpose), and affective (members’ social interactions produce feelings among group members). The definition of cohesion as multidimensional alludes to cohesion as a combination of task and social dimensions. Task cohesion reflects the degree to which members of a group work together to achieve common goals. In sport, a common goal would be winning a championship, which in part depends on the team’s coordinated effort or teamwork. Social cohesion, on the other hand, reflects the degree to which members of a team like each other and enjoy one another’s company. Social cohesion is often equated with interpersonal attraction. In an exercise class, for example, a common goal would be enhanced fitness, and it has been shown that adherence to the exercise program increases as the social cohesion of the group increases.\n\nThe distinction between task and social cohesion helps explain how teams can overcome conflict to succeed. Take, for example, the Los Angeles Lakers in the early 2000s—a team that certainly appeared to be low in social cohesion (star players Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal didn’t appear to get along off the court). However, the team clearly had a high degree of task cohesion— they wanted to win an NBA championship. It didn’t matter whether Kobe Bryant got along with Shaquille O’Neal, because they shared the goal of winning, and thus the Lakers worked together on the court (e.g., switching defenses, setting screens, passing accurately) despite personality differences.\n\nConceptual Model of Cohesion\n\nA conceptual model serves as a system and framework for systematically studying cohesion in sport and exercise. Carron’s model outlines five major antecedents or factors affecting the development of cohesion in sport and exercise settings: environmental, personal, leadership, team factors, and outcomes.\n\nEnvironmental Factors\n\nEnvironmental factors, which are the most general and remote, refer to the normative forces holding a group together. Environmental factors are present when, for example, players are under contract to the management, athletes hold scholarships, family members have expectations of athletes, geographical restrictions exist (e.g., having to play for a certain high school because of where you live), regulations specify the minimum playing time in a youth sport program, and exercisers pay an extra fee for their class. These influences can hold a group together, although other factors can also play an important role. For example, having individuals near each other or having smaller groups where there are more opportunities for interaction and communication fosters group development.\n\nPersonal Factors\n\nPersonal factors refer to the individual characteristics of group members. For ease of investigation, researchers have classified these personal factors into three categories: demographic attributes (e.g., member similarity, sex), cognitions and motives (e.g., attributions for responsibility, anxiety), and behavior (e.g., adherence, social loafing). The most important personal factor associated with the development of both task and social cohesion on a sport team’s satisfaction being a predictor of both social and task cohesion in the sport of golf. Another factor often cited as a correlate of cohesiveness is similarity (a demographic attribute)— similarity in attitudes, aspirations, commitments, and expectations. The importance of similarity (noted earlier under “Effective Team Climate”) is highlighted in the following quote about Jackie Robinson breaking the color (racial) barrier in baseball and the way Pee Wee Reese helped this transition:\n\n“Those early days were awfully tough on Jackie. I remembered times when on the train nobody would sit with him or talk to him. Pee Wee Reese always seemed to be the first to break the tension. He kidded Jackie before anyone else . . . . He started being friendly toward Jackie. In the beginning, Jackie was alone at the dining table. By the middle of the year, you couldn’t get a seat at the dining table.”\n\nLeadership Factors\n\nLeadership factors include the leadership style and behaviors that professionals exhibit and the relationships they establish with their groups. Research has indicated that the role of leaders is vital to team cohesion. Specifically, clear, consistent communication from coaches and captains regarding team goals, team tasks, and team members’ roles significantly influences cohesion. In addition, perceptions of compatibility between the leader and group members as evident in the coach–athlete relationship (commitment, closeness, complementarity) are important to enhancing feelings of cohesion.\n\nTeam Factors\n\nTeam factors refer to group task characteristics (individual vs. team sports), group productivity norms, desire for group success, group roles, group position, and team stability. It may be that teams that stay together a long time and have a strong desire for group success also exhibit high levels of group cohesion. In addition, shared experiences, such as a series of successes or failures, are important in developing and maintaining cohesion because they unify a team to counter the threat of opposing teams. Finally, some suggest that the relatively recent factor of collective efficacy is positively related to perceptions of team cohesion (Carron & Brawley, 2008). The following quote by Michael Jordan (1994) illustrates the relationship between collective efficacy and cohesion:\n\n“Naturally there are going to be ups and downs, particularly if you have individuals trying to achieve at a high level. But when we stepped between the lines, we knew what we were capable of doing. When a pressure situation presented itself, we were plugged into one another as a cohesive unit. That’s why we were able to come back so often and win so many close games and beat more talented teams.”\n\nOutcomes\n\nOutcomes occur at both the team and individual levels. At the team level, outcomes are seen in terms of team stability (how well the team stays together, especially during adversity) as well as absolute and relative effectiveness. At the individual level, outcomes are seen in terms of behavioral consequences (e.g., how much effort is put forth to work together), satisfaction, and relative and absolute effectiveness.\n\nTools for Measuring Cohesion\n\nTo determine the relationship between cohesion and performance, we must be able to measure cohesion. Two types of measures have been developed: questionnaires and sociograms.\n\nQuestionnaires\n\nMost early research on cohesion used the Sport Cohesiveness Questionnaire developed by Martens, Landers, and Loy (1972). This questionnaire has seven items that either measure interpersonal attraction or directly rate closeness or attraction to the group.\n\nUnfortunately, no reliability or validity measures were established on the Sport Cohesiveness Questionnaire, and most items address only social cohesion. To account for the multidimensional nature of cohesion, Yukelson, Weinberg, and Jackson (1984) developed a 22- item tool called the Multidimensional Sport Cohesion Instrument. It includes four broad dimensions of team cohesion: attraction to the group, unity of purpose, quality of teamwork, and valued roles. Later, Widmeyer, Brawley, and Carron (1985) developed the Group Environment Questionnaire (GEQ), which distinguishes between the individual and the group and between task and social concerns. It is based on theory related to group processes and systematically developed to guarantee reliability and validity (Brawley, Carron, & Widmeyer, 1987; Carron et al., 1998).\n\nThe GEQ has been successfully used in numerous studies of group cohesion in sport as well as fitness settings (e.g., see Carron et al., 1998, for a review). For example, using the GEQ, researchers have shown level of cohesion to be related to team performance, increased adherence, group size, attributions for responsibility for performance outcomes, reduced absenteeism, member satisfaction, and intrateam communication.\n\nThe model on which the development of the GEQ was based has two major categories: a member’s perception of the group as a totality (group integration) and a member’s personal attraction to the group (individual attraction to the group). The members’ perceptions of the group as a unit and their perceptions of the group’s attraction for them can focus on task or social aspects.\n\nThus, there are four constructs in the model:\n\nGroup integration—task (e.g., our team is united in trying to reach its goals for performance)\n\nGroup integration—social (e.g., members of our team do not stick together outside of practices and games)\n\nIndividual attraction to group—task (e.g., I do not like the style of play on this team)\n\nIndividual attraction to group—social (e.g., some of my best friends are on the team)\n\nSociograms\n\nQuestionnaires have been the most popular way to measure group cohesion, but they do not show how particular individuals relate to each other, whether cliques are developing, or whether some group members are socially isolated. A sociogram is a tool for measuring social cohesion. It discloses affiliation and attraction among group members, including:\n\nthe presence or absence of cliques,\n\nmembers’ perceptions of group closeness,\n\nfriendship choices in the group,\n\nthe degree to which athletes perceive interpersonal feelings similarly,\n\nsocial isolation of individual group members\n\nextent of group attraction.\n\nTo generate information for the sociogram, you ask individual group members specific questions such as “Name the three people in the group you would most like to invite to a party and the three people you would least like to invite,” “Name the three people you would most like to room with on road trips and the three you would least like to room with,” or “Name three people you would most like to practice with during the off-season and three you would least like to practice with.” Confidentiality must be ensured, and honesty in responses should be encouraged. Based on the responses to the questions, a sociogram is created, which should reveal the pattern of interpersonal relationships in a group. As the sociogram is created, the most frequently chosen individuals are placed toward the center and less frequently chosen individuals are placed outside. Jay and Bob form a closed unit and are not really involved with the rest of the team. Knowing about these relationships might help the coach deal with interpersonal problems before they become disruptive.\n\nRelationship Between Cohesion and Performance\n\nFans, coaches, and sport psychologists seem to have an enduring fascination with how team cohesion relates to performance success. On an intuitive level, you might assume that the higher the level of a team’s cohesion, the greater its success. Why else spend so much time trying to develop team cohesion? A review of 66 empirical studies assessing the cohesion–performance relationship in a variety of settings showed positive relationships in 92% of the studies; the strongest relationships were found in sport teams (Mullen & Cooper, 1994). Using just sport teams (46 studies including almost 10,000 athletes and more than 1,000 teams), Carron, Colman, Wheeler, and Stevens (2002) found moderate to large cohesion–performance effects and, like Mullen and Cooper, found that the strongest effects were in sport teams.\n\nA clue to the way in which cohesion enhances performance comes from a study showing that higher levels of cohesion may increase performance by producing higher levels of effort. However, several studies show a negative cohesion–performance relationship. In fact, several reviews of the research literature have noted the somewhat contradictory nature of the results regarding cohesion and performance success. The best way to understand the inconsistencies is to consider the measurement of cohesion, characteristics of the task, and direction of causality with reference to the latest review of the cohesion–performance literature.\n\nType of Measurement\n\nThere has been a great deal of controversy over the years regarding the effects of task and social cohesion on performance. In a review of the literature, Carron and colleagues (2002) found that increases in both task and social cohesion were associated with increases in performance. Previous reviews had indicated that task cohesion was more important (as a predictor of performance) than social cohesion, but evidently this is not the case. These results have important implications for applied sport psychology and interventions undertaken with athletes and teams to enhance team cohesiveness. Specifically, these results suggest that both task and social cohesion interventions can be effective in enhancing cohesiveness and improving performance. Socially oriented techniques include team campouts, ropes and challenge courses, social get-togethers outside of the sport context, and personal growth experiences. Task- oriented interventions include team goal setting, team communication, and understanding and conforming to team roles and norms.\n\nTask Demands\n\nA second explanation for the confusing cohesion– performance results involve the diversity of task demands that sport teams face. Specifically, the nature of interactions among team members runs along a continuum, from interactive to coactive. Interactive sports require team members to work together and coordinate their actions. Players on a soccer team, for example, must constantly pass the ball to each other, maintain certain positions, coordinate offensive attacks, and devise defensive strategies to stop opponents from scoring. Coactive sports require much less, if any, team interaction and coordination for the achievement of goals. For instance, members of a golf or bowling team have little to do with each other in terms of coordinated activity. Baseball is a good example of a sport that is both coactive and interactive: Batting or catching a fly ball is coactive, whereas making a double play or hitting the cutoff player (i.e., an outfielder throwing to an infielder who in turn throws the ball to home plate) is interactive.\n\nPrevious research argued that the cohesion– performance relationship was stronger in interactive sports than in coactive sports. However, a review by Carron and colleagues (2002) revealed that more cohesiveness is related to better performance in both coactive and interactive sports. However, the absolute level of cohesiveness is typically higher in interactive sports than in coactive sports, which makes sense considering the close on-court or on-field interactions required in sports such as basketball, football, and ice hockey. As a result, in interactive sports, coaches inevitably and explicitly introduce many of the team-building strategies associated with increased cohesiveness, such as ensuring role clarity and acceptance, establishing team performance goals, and improving athlete– athlete and coach–athlete communication. Conversely, the nature of coactive sports means there are fewer natural or inevitable opportunities for group cohesion to develop. Therefore, team-building interventions might have a greater effect on both team cohesion and team performance in that context.\n\nDirection of Causality\n\nThe direction of causality refers to whether cohesion leads to performance success or performance success leads to cohesion. In essence, will a team that works together on and off the field be successful, or do players like each other more and work together well because they are successful? Researchers have investigated these questions from two perspectives:\n\nCohesion leads to performance; that is, cohesion measures precede performance.\n\nPerformance leads to cohesion; that is, performance measures precede cohesion.\n\nDirection of causality or cause–effect relationships proved difficult to establish in past studies because there were too many uncontrolled factors, such as previous team success, coaching, or talent. For example, research (Grieve, Whelan, & Meyers, 2000) has supported the idea that the effect of performance on cohesion is stronger than the effect of cohesion on performance. Although cohesiveness may indeed lead the group to perform better, the tendency for the group to experience greater cohesiveness after successful performance may be even stronger”. A review using just sport teams, however, found no difference between the cohesion-to-performance and the performance-to-cohesion relationships. These findings appear to be consistent with research suggesting that the relationship between cohesion and performance is circular. Performance seems to affect later cohesion, and these changes in cohesion then affect subsequent performance.\n\nIn summary, then, the cohesion–performance relationship is complex. Considering the preponderance of evidence, we currently think that increased cohesion leads to greater performance and that better performances bring teams together and lead to increased cohesion. Hence, the relationship is circular. In this circular relationship, the effect of performance on cohesion appears to be stronger than that of cohesion on performance for teams in general (although not for sport teams).\n\nOther Factors Associated with Cohesion\n\nAlthough researchers have focused predominantly on the relationship between cohesion and performance, other potentially important factors are also associated with cohesion. This section reviews some of the more traditional.\n\nTeam Satisfaction\n\nSatisfaction and cohesion are highly similar except that cohesion is about groups whereas satisfaction is an individual construct. Although researchers have found consistently strong relationships between cohesion and satisfaction, two models are used to explain the relationships among cohesion, satisfaction, and performance.\n\nOne model (A) hypothesizes a circular relationship in which team cohesion leads to performance success, which leads to feelings of satisfaction, which tend to strengthen and reinforce team cohesion. The other model (B) hypothesizes a circular relationship in which performance success leads to higher cohesion, which in turn leads to greater satisfaction. Thus, both the models suggest that relationships among satisfaction, cohesion, and performance do indeed exist. However, model A suggests that cohesion directly enhances performance, whereas model B argues that performance success leads to cohesion. In either case, leaders do well in building group cohesion because being in a cohesive group is satisfying and indirectly and directly enhances performance.\n\nConformity\n\nPsychological research has shown that the more cohesive the group, the more influence the group has on its individual members. In a highly cohesive group, members might feel pressured about clothing style, hairstyle, practice habits, or game behavior. People joining health clubs might feel pressured to purchase designer exercise clothing, so they don’t look out of place.\n\nHighly cohesive groups demonstrate a greater conformity to the group’s norm for productivity than do less cohesive groups. For example, the best performance occurs when the group norm for productivity is high and group cohesion is high, whereas the poorest performance occurs when the group norm is low and group cohesion is high. One of the reasons the New England Patriots were so successful in the 2000s is that Tom Brady set such a high group norm for productivity, which helped raise the level of their teammates’ contributions to the team’s success.\n\nAdherence\n\nSeveral research studies have addressed the relationship between cohesion and adherence in a variety of exercise groups. A summary of these findings (Burke, Carron, & Shapcott, 2008) concluded that individuals in exercise classes who feel more cohesive (a) are likely to attend more classes, (b) are more likely to arrive on time, (c) are less likely to drop out, (d) are more resistant to disruptions in the group, (e) are more likely to experience positive affect related to exercise, and (f) have stronger efficacy beliefs related to exercise.\n\nSocial Support\n\nResearch on social support suggests a positive relationship between the social support an individual receives and her evaluations of group cohesion (Rees & Hardy, 2000). For example, social support provided by coaches has been positively related to athletes’ perceptions of task cohesion in high school football teams (Westre & Weiss, 1991), cohesion and satisfaction in college basketball teams (Weiss & Friedrichs, 1986), and higher performance in collegiate football teams (Garland & Barry, 1990). Although to many people social support simply means some sort of emotional support, researchers have identified seven distinguishable forms of social support.\n\nStability\n\nStability refers to both the turnover rate for group membership and the length of time group members have been together. It seems logical that teams that remain relatively constant across a certain period of time will be more stable, cohesive, and ultimately successful. Team cohesion and stability are related in a circular fashion. That is, the longer the team has been together, the more likely it is that cohesion will develop, and the more cohesive the team becomes, the less likely it is that members will choose to leave. Let’s look at research on this issue.\n\nStudies of soccer and baseball teams across a single season showed that teams with few lineup changes were more successful than those that changed constantly. Another study tried to determine whether there is an optimal amount of time to keep a group of players together to maximize cohesion and subsequent success. This study showed that in Major League Baseball, teams with a half-life (defined as the time it took for the starting roster to reduce to half its original size) of 5 years were the most successful.\n\nOther studies examined the relationship between cohesion and a sport group’s resistance to disruption (e.g., personnel changes or internal conflict) among elite sport athletes, recreational sport athletes, and fitness classes. A reliable positive relationship existed between group cohesion and group resistance to disruption: The groups that were higher in cohesion exhibited a higher resistance to disruption than did teams that were lower in cohesion. Establishing positive group norms for productivity is one way to keep individuals working together as a unit over time.\n\nGroup Goals\n\nMost people think that individuals set their own goals. But in group situations, such as with sport teams or exercise groups, goals are often set for the group. A group’s goals are not merely the sum of the personal goals of group members; they are shared perceptions that refer to a desirable state for the group as a unit. The question is, what relationship exists among group goals, cohesion, and performance?\n\nMembers who perceived that their team engaged in group goal setting for competition had higher levels of cohesion and the higher the level of satisfaction with team goals, the higher the level of team cohesion.\n\nAlthough individual group members’ perceptions of cohesion changed across a season, cohesion was still related to team satisfaction and group goals throughout the season.\n\nOther studies showed that a stated team goal— along with its acceptance—was the most important contributor to task cohesion and the second most important contributor to social cohesion. In addition, group cohesion increased as commitment to, clarity of, and importance of the goal increased for players. Having individuals participate in developing team or group goals also increased group cohesion.\n\nOn a practical note, athletes who perceive that a team goal encourages them to increase effort and who practice drills designed to achieve that goal (e.g., in volleyball, moving quickly from defensive to offensive sets) will likely feel satisfied with their team’s practice goals. You might expect this to happen because team members receive feedback that drills were correctly completed (i.e., the goal was reached) and that the team’s effort was high and its attention was focused. In this way, the group’s goals can enhance its feelings of unity and cohesion.\n\nTry the following guidelines for instituting a team goal-setting program:\n\n✔ Establish long-term goals first that are specific and challenging.\n\n✔ Establish clear paths to the long-term goals through the use of short-term goals.\n\n✔ Involve all team members in establishing goals.\n\n✔ Carefully monitor progress toward team goals.\n\n✔ Reward team progress toward team goals\n\n✔ Foster collective efficacy concerning team goal attainment.\n\nGender\n\nThe review of the cohesion–performance relationship suggests that the importance of cohesion is more important for women than for men.\n\nOn women ’s teams, performance doesn’t always lead to cohesion; however, it is more likely to on men’s teams. “Just because we’re winning doesn’t mean everything is great with a female team. Whereas most men’s teams, when we’re winning everything else just falls into place.”\n\nMen and women approach conflict and adversity differently.\n\nStrategies for Enhancing Cohesion\n\nBecause sport psychologists better understand the nature of group cohesion, researchers have focused on specific interventions for enhancing cohesion in sport and exercise groups.\n\nExercise Settings\n\nWith dropout rates from formal exercise programs at about 50%, researchers have been investigating ways to reduce this discouraging statistic. One innovative approach has focused on cohesion to enhance attendance rates. It has been found that dropouts from exercise programs have less regard for the task and social cohesion of their exercise class than do participants who stay with the program (Carron & Spink, 1993; Spink & Carron, 1993). In addition, exercisers with higher feelings of cohesion attend class more regularly and are more punctual than exercisers with lower cohesion.\n\nIn another innovative study, sport psychologists attempted to build cohesion in exercise classes through a team approach (Spink & Carron, 1993). They learned that distinctiveness contributes to a sense of group identity, unity, and cohesion. Some instructors emphasized distinctiveness by having a group name, making up a group T-shirt, or handing out neon headbands. Their classes showed higher levels of cohesion and significantly fewer dropouts and late arrivals than did the classes not exposed to team building. This suggests that cohesion is an important ingredient in exercise settings as well as in traditional sport settings.\n\nTo further test the effects of team building on cohesion, devised an intervention for small and large exercise classes. The team-building program offset the negative effect that increased size can have on perceptions of cohesion. Specifically, no differences existed in perceptions of cohesion for participants from small (fewer than 20 participants) and large (more than 40) exercise groups that had been exposed to a team- building intervention. In essence, it is possible to maintain a sense of cohesion even in relatively large groups with the implementation of an appropriate team-building program.\n\nSport Settings\n\nOther research has focused on team building in sport. In this case, the intervention began with elite male soccer coaches attending a workshop during the off-season in which specific strategies for implementing a team-building program were established. Specifically, based on the principles outlined in table 9.3, the coaches were asked to develop applied techniques and procedures that could be used for team building with their teams during the 6 weeks before the season. Although results did not show significant differences in cohesion between the team- building and control conditions, the authors believed that the coaches in the control conditions used many of the strategies from the cohesion intervention to enhance their own team’s cohesion.\n\nGroup norms. Have team members work in small groups to describe how an ideal teammate would react to a list of hypothetical but realistic situations. The team then discusses and agrees on unacceptable (e.g., yelling at teammates, coming late to practice) and acceptable behaviors. By having a meeting and coming to a joint decision on acceptable team norms, players will better understand what is expected of them on and off the field.\n\nIndividual roles. Each athlete anonymously writes “I want [player’s name] on my team because . . .” for everyone on the team. The coach then collects and distributes the responses to the appropriate athletes. This helps each athlete understand the importance of their role on the team.\n\nDistinctiveness. Matching uniforms with team mottos is an easy way to bring the team together and create distinctiveness. Traveling to competitions together also increases interactions among athletes, bringing them closer together and making them more distinct from other groups.\n\nIndividual sacrifice. Have an offensive player play a more defensive role, or ask a team captain or veteran to make efforts to mentor a younger or new team member.\n\nCommunication and interaction. Set out a small obstacle course using cones. Separate athletes into small groups and blindfold all but one member in each group. The athlete not wearing a blindfold directs teammates through the course using verbal instructions only.\n\nA unique approach to improving the performance environment of competitive teams was developed and implemented in English soccer, which broadened the definition of cohesion to include the entire environment in which teams function, including coach–athlete interaction, organizational issues, team climate, communication, goal setting, and team socialization. Especially important was getting the coach and players involved in a reflective way so that they considered the game performance, which led to valuable ideas regarding team functioning. This type of action research, conducted with athletes and coaches while carefully considering potential actual changes within the team, during a competitive season holds great promise for sport psychologists working with competitive teams. In one study, in-depth interviews and participant observations (one of the researchers was on the team) revealed factors associated with the development of cohesion at midseason and at the end of the season. At midseason, clear, and meaningful roles, team goals, communication, and selfishness or personal sacrifice were most strongly related to cohesion. At the end of the season, the same four factors were still operative, although to varying degrees. This demonstrated the unstable nature of cohesion and the fact that it can significantly change over the course of a season. Furthermore, a study found that a group-based intervention of team building could be successfully implemented by an online delivery method (Forrest & Bruner, 2017). This provides greater flexibility for both coaches and athletes, with a result like that of a face-to-face team-building intervention.\n\nShared Team Values: A Prerequisite for Team Building\n\nTeam building has become a common technique in sport, business, and the military. Team building usually involves identifying team goals and a team mission. But before team-building activities and goals are identified, team values need to be developed and understood because values clarify the path to achieving goals and are critical to building trust among players and coaches. Common team values might include morality, teamwork, honesty, cooperation, communication, winning, fairness, and accountability.\n\nKnowing that other team members share common values will lead to a commitment to act in accordance with these values both on and off the field (Kramer & Lewicki, 2010).\n\nGuidelines for Building Team Cohesion\n\nCohesion doesn’t always enhance group performance, but it can certainly create a positive environment that elicits positive interactions among group members. Along these lines, building team cohesion involves understanding the experience of individual athletes on the team and uncovering the ways in which they can become personally invested in the team, feel satisfied with the contributions that they are making, and feel responsibility for the team’s cohesiveness and success. Sport psychologists have created guidelines for developing group cohesion. Of special note is an issue of Journal of Applied Sport Psychology (Hardy & Crace, 1997) devoted to team building. These ideas are appropriate for competitive sport, teaching, and exercise settings.\n\nWhat Coaches or Leaders Can Do\n\nIf communication is effective and open, coaches and leaders can foster group cohesion in several ways. We discuss here what leaders can do to help build cohesion and what participants themselves can do.\n\nCommunicate Effectively\n\nAn effective group or team leader needs to create an environment where everyone is comfortable expressing thoughts and feelings. Open lines of communication can alleviate many potential problems. Here, Terry Orlick (2000) describes the critical role of communication in group cohesion:\n\n“Harmony grows when you really listen to others and they listen to you, when you are considerate of their feelings and they are considerate of yours, when you accept their differences and they accept yours, and when you help them, and they help you”\n\nOne technique to help individuals communicate and express their feelings positively and assertively is known as the DESC formula. This technique consists of describing (the situation), expressing (feelings), specifying (changes you want to take place), and noting the consequences (what to expect if agreement is not reached).\n\nLeaders should ensure that everyone pulls together and is committed to the group’s goals, which include improved interpersonal relationships. This improvement is important because increased communication has a circular relationship with increased group cohesiveness. As communication about task and social issues increases, cohesiveness develops. As a result, group members are more open with each other, volunteer more, talk more, and listen better.\n\nExplain Individual Roles in Team Success\n\nCoaches should clearly outline individual roles to team members, stressing the importance of each player’s role to the team’s success. The more team members there are who perceive their roles as unimportant, the more apathetic the team will become. Coaches need to carefully explain to these athletes what their roles on the team are and give them opportunities to contribute. When players understand what is required of their teammates, they can begin to develop support and empathy. For example, during practice, the coach might assign a player to a position other than his usual one. For example, a spiker in volleyball who is upset at the setter’s poor passes could be asked to set during practice. This way he can see how hard it is to set the ball in just the right spot for the spiker.\n\nDevelop Pride Within Subunits\n\nIn sports in which subunits naturally exist (e.g., football, hockey, track and field), coaches should foster pride within these groups. Players need the support of their teammates, especially those playing the same position. The offensive linemen for the Washington Redskins in the 1980s called themselves “the hogs” because they did all the dirty work. The linemen took pride in this name and in what they contributed to the team’s overall success. And the running backs and quarterback really appreciated the linemen’s contributions— after all, their success depended on how well those hogs blocked.\n\nSet Challenging Group Goals\n\nSetting specific, challenging goals has a positive effect on individual and group performance. Goals set a high norm for productivity and keep the team focused on what it needs to accomplish. As players reach goals, they should be encouraged to take pride in their accomplishments and strive toward new goals. These goals need to be clearly defined for them in order to foster group cohesion in their pursuits. The goals should be performance based (relating to players’ abilities) rather than outcome based (relating to winning).\n\nEncourage Group Identity\n\nA coach or leader can encourage team identity by ordering team jackets and scheduling social functions, for example, but these jackets and events should not interfere with the development of subunit identity. The two should work hand in hand. Groups should be made to feel special and, in some sense, different from other groups.\n\nAvoid Formation of Social Cliques\n\nCompared with subunits, which are groups of athletes working at a similar position or task, social cliques usually benefit only a few athletes— at the expense of alienating most team members. Players often form cliques when the team is losing, when their needs are not being met, or when coaches treat athletes differently and set them apart from each other (e.g., starters vs. substitutes). Cliques tend to be disruptive to a team, and coaches should quickly determine why cliques are forming and take steps to break them up. Changing roommate assignments on trips and encouraging team functions are ways to battle the development of cliques.\n\nEmploy Transformational Behaviors\n\nLeadership Leaders should employ transformational behaviors such as setting high performance expectations, fostering acceptance of group goals, serving as an appropriate role model, and displaying inspirational motivation to enhance cohesion. Especially important is to demonstrate the willingness to sacrifice personal gains for the general good of the team, as this will enhance group cohesion.\n\nAvoid Excessive Turnover\n\nExcessive turnover decreases cohesion and makes it difficult for members to establish close rapport. Of course, high school and college teams lose players to graduation each year. In this case, veteran players should be asked to help integrate new players into the team. Veterans can share team expectations in a warm, sincere, open manner, making the new players feel at ease with their new team and teammates. Similarly, exercise groups often have turnover as people drop out, and it’s important to make newcomers feel welcome and part of these groups.\n\nConduct Periodic Team Meetings\n\nThroughout the season, coaches should conduct team meetings to allow team members to honestly, openly, and constructively express positive and negative feelings.\n\nTeams can talk about learning from mistakes, redefining goals, and maintaining good sporting behavior.\n\nIf no problems or issues exist and the goal is simply to enhance feelings of cohesion, a technique known as group disclosures may be appropriate. Participants discuss individuals and teams that they admire the most along with the characteristics that contribute to the success of these individuals and groups. Then participants are asked to share things they admire about each other and what they have learned from each other.\n\nEnhance Team Efficacy\n\nResearch indicates that focusing on developing team efficacy early in the season can have a positive influence on the development of a type of cohesion (individual attraction to the group— task) later in the season. In essence, the development of collective competence (especially in teams requiring integration and coordination, such as football, volleyball, and basketball) can increase players’ feelings about their personal involvement with their team’s productivity and objectives. For example, strategies designed to build or maintain athletes’ beliefs about their team efficacy should be encouraged. These could take the form of team drilling and instruction, emphasizing players’ contributions to the team’s efforts, or helping players help each other and cooperate in a task- involving climate, focusing on self-improvement rather than simply winning.\n\nWhat Group Members Can Do\n\nSo far, our guidelines have targeted coaches and leaders. But team unity is not only the coach’s responsibility— group members can also promote team cohesion. Here are ways group members can improve communication and build a strong, cohesive unit, the better the chances for team success and harmony.\n\nResolve conflicts immediately. If a team member has a complaint or a conflict with the coach or a teammate, he should take the initiative to resolve the situation and clear the air. Players should not just complain and vent their feelings. Players and coaches should collaborate for optimal resolutions.\n\nGet to know members of the group. The better team members know each other, the easier it is to accept individual differences. Individuals should take time to get to know their teammates, especially the new members in the group.\n\nHelp group members whenever possible. Being a team means that individuals are mutually interdependent. Helping each other out creates team spirit and brings teammates closer together. For example, if a teammate is having trouble with free-throw shooting in basketball, you might offer to help her, especially if you are proficient in this aspect of the game.\n\nGive group members positive reinforcement. Supporting teammates instead of being negative and critical goes a long way toward building trust and support. Team members should be especially sensitive, positive, and constructive when a teammate is going through adversity.\n\nThe help and support given to this player also helps the team.\n\nBe responsible. Group members should not habitually blame others for poor performances. Blaming serves no useful purpose. When things are not going well, players should try to make positive, constructive changes and get themselves back on track.\n\nCommunicate honestly and openly with the coach or leader. Team members should make sure the coach receives accurate information concerning what is happening within the team. The better everyone understands everyone else,\n\nrespond to the problem quickly so that negative feelings don’t build up and explode later.\n\nGive 100% effort at all times. Working hard, especially in practice, helps bring the team together. Dedication and commitment are contagious. Setting a good example usually has a positive effect on a team’s unity.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nUnderstand how groups are structured.\n\nA group’s structure depends largely on the interactions of its members. Two of the most important structural characteristics of groups are group roles and group norms. Roles consist of the set of behaviors required or expected of the person occupying a certain position in a group. Norms are levels of performance, patterns of behaviors, or beliefs characteristic of the group.\n\nExplain how to create an effective team climate.\n\nTeam climate develops from how players perceive the interrelationships among the group members. Some of the critical factors affecting team climate are social support, proximity, distinctiveness, fairness, and similarity.\n\nDescribe how to maximize individual performance in team sports.\n\nIndividual skills are only moderately related to ultimate team success. Thus, getting greater contributions from each player is critical for high-level team performance. Through filming performances, helping players understand their roles, and increasing identifiability, you can maximize an individual’s sense of contributing to the team effort.\n\nUnderstand social loafing and the conditions under which it is more likely to occur.\n\nSocial loafing is the phenomenon whereby individuals in a group put forth less than 100% effort because of losses in motivation, due in large part to a diffusion of responsibility (expecting others to pick up the slack). In essence, a diffusion of responsibility occurs, and individuals believe that others in the group will pick up the slack. Social loafing appears to occur more often when an individual’s output cannot be independently evaluated, the task is perceived to be low in meaningfulness, the individual’s personal involvement in the task is low, a comparison against group standards is not possible, other individuals contributing to the collective effort are strangers, the individual’s teammates are seen as high in ability, and individuals perceive that their contribution to the outcome is redundant.\n\nDefine task and social cohesion.\n\nIn measuring cohesion, researchers have found that it is multidimensional and comprises both task and social cohesion. Team cohesion is a dynamic process reflected in the group’s tendency to stick together while pursuing its goals and objectives. Task cohesion refers to working together as a team to achieve goals, whereas social cohesion refers to the interpersonal attraction among team members.\n\nDescribe the conceptual model of cohesion.\n\nCarron’s model of cohesion indicates that four areas affect the development of cohesion: environmental (team size, scholarships), personal (motivation, social background), team (team norms, team stability), and leadership (leadership style, leader’s goals) factors. These factors do not exist in isolation but rather interact to affect both task and social cohesion.\n\nUnderstand the cohesion–performance relationship.\n\nResearchers have been examining the relationship between cohesion and performance in sport for more than 30 years. However, this relationship is complex, and studying it involves three factors: measurement of cohesion, type of task, and direction of causality. Both task and social cohesion and interactive and coactive tasks are associated with positive effects on performance. In addition, the cohesion– performance relationship appears to be circular: Team success enhances cohesion, which leads in turn to success.\n\nIdentify guidelines for building team cohesion. Researchers have recently developed and outlined interventions for enhancing task and social cohesion in both sport and exercise settings. However, group members, as well as coaches or leaders, must assume responsibility for developing group cohesion.\n\nReview and Discussion:\n\nDiscuss why most definitions of a group agree that a collection of individuals is not necessarily a group.\n\nDescribe the Ringelmann effect. What implications do Ringelmann’s findings have for a coach, physical educator, or exercise leader?\n\nDiscuss three potential explanations for social loafing. How would you identify social loafing? Compare and contrast the linear, cyclical, and pendular models of group development.\n\nDefine cliques, including their antecedents and consequences. Provide three ways to reduce the formation of cliques that have negative outcomes.\n\nDiscuss the definitions of cohesion, including the difference between task and social cohesion.\n\nDiscuss how measuring cohesion has developed via questionnaires.\n\nFindings in the research literature on the cohesion–performance relationship have been inconsistent.\n\nExplain whether or how the types of instruments used to measure these two factors and the demands of the task have affected this relationship.\n\nAlthough researchers have focused on the cohesion–performance relationship, cohesion appears to be related to several other potentially important variables. Discuss the relationship of cohesion to four factors other than performance."
