        "text": "What does teamwork mean?\n\nSuccess in team games means everyone involved in the task in hand needs to combine their efforts. If everyone does their job well, then it increases what the team can accomplish.\n\nThis teamwork has to be recognised by everyone. All must understand that great things can happen if individuals work together as one unit.\n\nEveryone has their own unique role, of course, but each person’s individual role must be recognised and appreciated.\n\nVince Lombardi, the legendary American Football coach famed for his leadership, defined teamwork as “Individual commitment to a group effort - that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work\".\n\nThe successful coaches in all team sports agree on one thing; teamwork is extremely important to attain the highest goals.\n\nHow you describe teamwork to young players is also important.\n\nTo them, at an early age, soccer is an expression of individuality - but once they grasp the concept of team play and the ethos of teamwork, they can both be achieved very readily.\n\n\"All must understand that great things can happen if individuals work together...\"\n\nIn teams, young players can work together and accomplish much more than they could by themselves.\n\nThis joining together is how many teams achieve success – think of how sides like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Manchester City win trophies by creating a strong web of individuals all supporting and working for each other.\n\nThe teams with the best players do not necessarily win championships. Often, it is those that work best together that accomplishes great things.\n\nMia Hamm was one of the most prolific forwards in international women’s soccer history - but she never forgot who helped create the 158 goals she scored for the US national team.\n\n\"I am a member of a team,\" she said. \"I rely on the team, I defer to it and sacrifice for it - because the team, not the individual, is the ultimate champion.\"\n\nBeing part of a team also adds to the fun – they share in the glory and the pain.\n\nIt is not so bad when you are going round to your best friend’s house if they lost the game with you - and even better if you have won together.\n\nINSPIRING TEAMWORK QUOTES TO USE WITH YOUNG PLAYERS\n\n“TEAM - Together Everyone Achieves More...”\n\n\"There is no ’I’ in TEAM...\"\n\n“Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard...”\n\n\"It’s not the team with the best players that win, but the players who make the best team...\"\n\n“You don’t inspire your teammates by showing them how amazing you are. You inspire them be them by showing them how amazing THEY are...\"\n\n\"The main ingredient of stardom is the rest of the team...\"\n\n“Don’t aspire to be the best on the team. Aspire to be the best for the team...\"\n\n\"It is amazing how much people get done if they do not worry who gets the credit...\""
