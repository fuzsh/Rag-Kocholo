        "text": "As one of the most popular sports in the U.S., football has tons of benefits for those who choose to play. There are multiple mental and physical perks to participating in football, including reducing anxiety, as well as providing an awesome workout. You would be surprised at how many areas of your life can be positively impacted by this sport. Here are 6 benefits of playing football that you should know:\n\n1. Improved Work Ethic\n\nWhether you’re playing on an amateur or professional level, football is hard work. Not only do you have to work hard to ensure you’re pulling your own weight for the team, you also have to be ready to assist your teammates at any time. It takes practice and dedication and is a great way to improve your overall work ethic. If you want to be good at football, you’ve got to put in the necessary effort.\n\n2. Reduced Anxiety\n\nIf you’re someone who struggles with anxiety, football can be a great way to redirect your stress into a more productive outlet. The adrenaline that comes with playing football is shown to reduce the effects of daily stressors and keeps the players calm. People who play football show less symptoms of depression and anxiety, in addition to being less likely to exhibit aggressive behaviors in their everyday life.\n\n3. A Great Workout\n\nCombining cardio, strength training, and endurance, football is an overall great workout. If you aren’t someone who enjoys going to the gym or a workout class, signing up for a recreational football league may be a great option for you. One of the greatest benefits of playing football is the consistent workouts you’ll get during practice and games.\n\n4. Teaches Teamwork\n\nFootball is not an individual sport where you only have to depend on yourself. When your team isn’t working effectively together as a group, it’ll be very difficult to win any games. This sport teaches selflessness, cooperation and teamwork to players, coaches and even fans. When a team comes together as a unit, it shows on and off the field.\n\n5. Interval Training\n\nFootball is a great way to work on interval training! With periods of slow and fast movements, your heart begins to work at different speeds to accommodate for both elevated and reduced levels. This is a great form of interval training, which helps control your body fat and increase your overall fitness.\n\n6. Stronger Bone Density and Mass\n\nOne benefit of playing football that a lot of people don’t think about is the improvement it can have on your bone density and mass. With the combination of high protein intake and strength training, football players typically see strengthening in their bones and joints. This can decrease your chances of facing bone and joint related diseases as you age.\n\nWith so many benefits of playing football, it’s no wonder so many people around the world enjoy this sport. If you coach or are a member of a football team, make sure to sign up for a few of the events at our Gatlinburg sports complex. We look forward to seeing you!"
