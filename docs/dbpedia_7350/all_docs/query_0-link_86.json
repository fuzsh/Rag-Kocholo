        "text": "History\n\n[edit]\n\nFootball finds its origins in rugby, which bears some general similarities to gridiron-style football. (Association football—or \"soccer\"—also split from rugby around the same time, albeit in a very different direction.) The first football games were played by the colleges of the Northeastern United States, with the first recognized football game taking place in 1869, soon followed by the establishment of a standard set of rules and intercollegiate play. The game closely resembled rugby, but as it evolved through the 1870s and 80s football began to break from its rugby roots, particularly with the innovation of the \"line of scrimmage\" and the \"snap\" (passing the ball backwards at the start of play). Walter Camp, then-captain of Yale's football team and now considered the \"Father of American Football\", was instrumental in securing rule changes that effectively created the modern sport of football.\n\nFurther innovations followed in the early decades of the 20th century, such as the establishment of the forward pass and the current point system and field dimensions. During this time, the collegiate leagues established a governing body, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and the tradition of annual postseason bowl games. The era also saw the rise of professional football, with the 1920 creation of the National Football League, which quickly established itself as the premier professional league, but nonetheless had to fight off rival claimants to major league status during almost all of its first five decades of existence. Eventually, the NFL would come to surpass the collegiate leagues in popularity, and by the late 1960s football was the most popular sport in the United States. 1960 saw the establishment of the American Football League, a rival professional league which soon proved fierce competition for playing talent with the NFL, though the rivalry quickly came to an end when the two leagues agreed to a merger in 1966, which instituted a championship game to be played between the champions of each league: the Super Bowl. The AFL–NFL rivalry arguably helped football surpass baseball in popularity and grow as a sport as the game went from 12 teams in 1959, only two of which played south of Washington, D.C. or west of Chicago (both in California), to 26 in 1970 upon completion of the merger. Both game attendance and TV ratings also grew very fast during that period of time.\n\nToday, the NFL and the NCAA remain far and away the most popular football leagues in the world, with both having made attempts since the 1990s to promote football abroad, the most notable of which is the yearly NFL international series in London. The Super Bowl is the single most important game on the American sporting calendar, and perennially one of the most-watched television events every year, with hundreds of millions tuning in from around the world for the only football game they will watch until the following February.\n\nDue to a number of rules that ensure competitiveness, such as the draft, the salary cap, or revenue sharing for TV revenue, the NFL is one of the most balanced professional sports leagues in the world and many teams have gone from championship contender to the bottom of their division or the other way round in just a few years. This makes \"dynasties\" of teams appearing in and winning multiple Super Bowls in a short span of time all the more impressive, as unlike in other sports, simply outspending opponents to get the best players is not a feasible tactic.\n\nRules\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following is a brief overview of the basics of American football, as played in the NFL (there are some small differences in the NCAA or high school matches):\n\nFootball is played by two teams of 11 players on the field who face off trying to advance an elongated ellipsoid ball (often described as looking like an egg) towards the end zone and its tall yellow goalpost, where points can be scored. The offense has four opportunities (called downs) to advance the ball 10 yards (9.1 metres). Each new down begins where the preceding down ended (i.e. where the ball carrying player was \"marked down\" or—in the case of an incomplete pass—at the previous spot). If the 10 yards have been achieved, a new set of four downs starts. If a net distance of 10 yards has not been achieved after four downs, the offense must turn the ball over to the other team. Oftentimes, a down is synonymous with a play but if a penalty is called on the defensive, the offensive may be given extra opportunities or even an all-new first down to start over after a particularly egregious defensive infraction.\n\nIn very few cases will the offense risk turning the ball over on downs when they are in a disadvantageous field position; instead, they almost always elect to punt on fourth down. Punting means kicking the ball away out of the hand towards the opposing team (much like a goalkeeper does in soccer). However, if the field position is good enough (usually within 35 yards of the end zone) a field goal will be attempted (see below). In rare cases, including cases where the offensive team is trailing by more than three points or only needs a couple yards to gain, the team may try to \"go for it\", i.e. convert the first down.\n\nEach play starts with a snap, in which the ball is passed backwards to the quarterback, away from the line of scrimmage. The ball may then be advanced through passing with one forward pass (subject to some other preconditions as well) and unlimited backward passes (which are rarely used) permitted per play. Passing is almost exclusively the domain of the quarterback, who is usually the best paid and most prestigious player on the field. He is the de facto team captain and guides the other offensive players. If a forward pass is not caught before it hits the ground, the referee signals an incomplete pass, the play ends (\"is blown dead\") and the next play begins at the spot where the previous one started. The ball may also be advanced by running (carrying it forward) which is usually done by a running back. The other positions on the offense are the wide receivers, who catch forward passes; the offensive linemen, who try to clear a space for the running back to run through and are also responsible for protecting the quarterback; and the tight end (not always present), a larger receiver who may be called on to either catch passes or block, depending on the play call.\n\nThe defense tries to stop the offense's advance by tackling the player that carries the ball. There are three basic defensive positions. The defensive linemen try to prevent the offense from pushing the defense back and will try to reach the quarterback on passing plays. Linebackers, who play behind the defensive linemen, have perhaps the broadest role. Depending on what the offense does, they may rush the passer, cover a running back or tight end on a pass pattern, or try to chase down a running back. Defensive backs, divided into cornerbacks who play at the edges of the defense and safeties who play in the middle of the field, are usually assigned to a specific receiver or area and try to prevent the receivers from catching the ball or catch it themselves. If they catch it themselves, it is called an interception and possession of the football changes to the other team. If a player who had control of the ball drops the ball, or a backwards pass or snap is not caught, it is called a fumble. When the ball is fumbled, any player of either team may take the ball and advance it (for an exception to that rule, found only in the NFL, see Wikipedia's article on the \"Holy Roller\" play). Lost fumbles and interceptions are collectively referred to as turnovers, and one of the most important aspects in winning the game is to turn the ball over less than the opponent does. Typically a team that turns the ball over three or more times loses the game.\n\nScoring is done through one of three means. The most common and coveted is a touchdown: when a player enters the opponent's end zone with the ball, or catches the ball inside the opponent's end zone. Unlike in rugby, and despite its name, touching the ball to the ground is not required. A touchdown is worth six points, and further points may be earned by either a two-point conversion (another touchdown from the two-yard line) or a single point by touchdown kick (which is similar to a field goal). As the touchdown kick is by far the preferred option and has a success rate well over 90% (in the NFL at least; in youth and amateur leagues that rate may be considerably lower), touchdowns are often perceived to be worth seven points. Field goals are scored by kicking the ball through the yellow goalpost from a place kick, and are worth three points. A very rare drop kick can also be attempted instead of the place kick when attempting a field goal or one-point conversion, whereby the ball is dropped and immediately kicked through the goalposts on hitting the ground—only one has been successfully converted in NFL football since 1941. Least commonly, the defense can score a two-point safety if the opposing offense is brought down within their own end zone. Even more uncommon is a different type of two-point safety (also called a defensive conversion), scored if the defense forces a turnover (blocked kick, interception, fumble) on a conversion attempt and returns the ball to the opponent's end zone.\n\nFouls, or penalties, are signaled through yellow flags (orange in Canada) which are thrown onto the field by an official. Enforcing the penalty involves placing the ball some distance forward or back, to the detriment of the offending side. Common penalties include unnecessary roughness, any type of illegal motion prior to the snap (such as a false start or crossing the line of scrimmage) and holding (grabbing a player who doesn't have the ball).\n\nEach game lasts for four quarters of 15 minutes each, although each team is allowed a limited number of timeouts to briefly stop the clock. As the clock stops or keeps running depending on what happened in the previous play, \"clock management\" is one of the most crucial and complicated aspects of tactics at the highest level, particularly in the last few minutes of a half. After the first two quarters, an extended break called half-time occurs where the two teams return to their locker rooms to recover. During this intermission, entertainment is provided for the fans, such as a cheerleading or a marching band performance, or a pop music concert in the case of major events. When the teams return from the break, the end zones are swapped for the second half of the game. During the regular season, if the scores are tied at the end of the fourth quarter, the game goes into a 10-minute overtime period, where the first team to score wins the game. If neither team manages to score by the end of overtime, the game ends in a tie. During the playoffs, each overtime period lasts for 15 minutes, and play continues even after a team has scored, and the team with more points at the end of overtime wins. If the scores are tied at the end of overtime, the game continues into as many overtime periods as necessary until a winner is determined.\n\nAs American football allows an unlimited number of substitutions, players tend to specialize in either offense or defense, and the entire team is usually substituted whenever there is a stoppage during or after a turnover. This means that touchdowns by defensive players are a rare event, and typically only occur if a pass by the offensive team is intercepted, or if a fumble by the offensive team is recovered by the defensive team in a good position. While even the NFL has a few players that play \"both ways\" (J. J. Watt is a commonly cited example), this is more common in youth or developmental leagues or outside North America, as some players so far outrank others in talent that the additional strain and less rest is not a deciding factor. It is more common for an otherwise defensive or offensive player to play on special teams, often in a role broadly similar to his role on scrimmage downs.\n\nSuper Bowl and Pro Bowl\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Super Bowl, the NFL championship game that pits the AFC champion against the best of the NFC, is the biggest single-day event in sports and one of the most watched TV programs worldwide every year. Many fans dream of seeing a Super Bowl live once in their lifetime, but tickets sell out extremely quickly and unless you have luck, patience, a lot of money, or know the right people getting tickets is extremely hard, if not impossible.\n\nThe Super Bowl is a major annual event in the United States and has even become something of an unofficial holiday, drawing the attention even of people who don't typically follow football. There has been a media obsession with Super Bowl commercials, due to the exceptionally high cost of airtime during the Super Bowl television broadcast and the increasingly theatrical nature of these advertisements. Super Bowl Sunday is also one of the busiest days for food delivery of any kind—tip accordingly—and high amounts of fast food are eaten.\n\nEven if you can't make it to the game, being in the city of the Super Bowl during Super Bowl weekend can be a worthwhile reason for travel all by itself. The highlight of Super Bowl festivities is the NFL Experience, a fan festival that takes place the week prior to the game in the host city and has lots of games, vendors, a giant souvenir/collectibles store and autograph opportunities. You can get free gear, participate in virtual reality football games, go zip-lining, and generally be in the center of the action without actually attending the game itself. Wherever the Super Bowl is held, expect packed hotels, more expensive flights (or bus/train tickets if and where applicable) and a general state far from normalcy in and around the host city.\n\nVenues are chosen and announced years ahead and the date has shifted from being in January for several years to being held on the second full weekend in February. (The most recent change was due to the NFL expanding its regular season from 16 to 17 games in 2021.) The next events are scheduled to be:\n\nSuper Bowl LIX, February 9, 2025 / Caesars Superdome, New Orleans (in the Central Business District)\n\nSuper Bowl LX, February 8, 2026 / Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara (in the San Francisco Bay Area)\n\nSuper Bowl LXI, February 14, 2027 / SoFi Stadium, Inglewood (near Los Angeles International Airport)\n\nFinally, the Pro Bowl is an all-star match played a week before the Super Bowl. For several years, this one-off game was played in Hawaii, but has since moved to the US mainland, most recently to Las Vegas in 2022 and 2023. The Pro Bowl is a more low-key event than the Super Bowl—e.g., the NFL does not allow players from the Super Bowl teams to play in the Pro Bowl, to avoid injuries and focus on the big game. Starting with the 2023 edition (2022 season), the event is now known as the Pro Bowl Games, with various skills competitions leading up to a series of three non-contact flag football games. But for someone who is even a casual fan, the Pro Bowl is a unique experience to see several of the game's greatest players having fun. Events will frequently include older stars who have retired and may be honored at the proceedings.\n\nRegular season\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are numerous college football conferences in the United States. Teams play both in-conference and out-of-conference games. If you are interested in seeing a college football game somewhere where you are visiting, look at the websites of local colleges for schedule and other useful information. The atmosphere at college games is very different from what you would experience at an NFL game, with a lot more cheerleading (cheerleaders are those pretty women in flashy uniforms, often partnered with muscular men in slightly less flashy uniforms, who chant things and do dance and sometimes acrobatic moves) and performances by the college's pep band (a marching band) and dance team (more pretty women in flashy uniforms, but they only dance and don't do acrobatics) during halftime and other breaks in the action. There are myriad local rivalries; some teams located close to an opponent (e.g. Michigan and Michigan State or Texas and Texas A&M) may have a crowd made up of even contingents for both squads, although this normally happens only when the game is held at a neutral site within easy reach of both fanbases (e.g. Oklahoma–Texas, held in Dallas, and Florida–Georgia, held in Jacksonville). Outright hooliganism or violence is rare, but emotions can run high and these can result in especially rowdy audiences.\n\nConference championship games\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom 2018 through 2023, all 10 FBS conferences held championship games. At the start of that period, these games featured the champions of the league's two football divisions, but with recent changes to NCAA rules, most conferences no longer split their teams into divisions. As of the upcoming 2024 season, the only conference with divisions is the Sun Belt Conference (SBC). The early-2020s conference realignment effectively killed the Pac-12 Conference; it now has only two members after the other 10 left for other power conferences in 2024, making a conference championship game meaningless. The other eight—the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), American Athletic Conference (The American), Big Ten Conference, Big 12 Conference, Conference USA (CUSA), Mid-American Conference (MAC), Mountain West Conference (MW), and Southeastern Conference (SEC)—instead feature the top two teams in the final conference standings. All conference championship games are held on the first full weekend of December. The \"Power Four\" conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, SEC) all hold their title games in NFL stadiums, as does the Mid-American Conference.\n\nGames with permanent sites\n\nACC – Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, home of the Carolina Panthers.\n\nBig Ten – Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, home of the Colts.\n\nBig 12 – AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, home of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nMAC – Ford Field in Detroit, home of the Lions.\n\nSEC – Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, home of the Falcons.\n\nThe other Group of Five leagues—The American, CUSA, MW, and SBC—play their championship games on campus. The SBC game is hosted by the divisional champion with the better conference record; all others are hosted by the team with the best conference record.\n\nArmy–Navy Game\n\n[edit]\n\nAnother prominent college football event is the Army–Navy Game, the annual matchup between the teams of two of the country's five military academies—the Army Black Knights of the United States Military Academy and Navy Midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy. The game, held on the second Saturday of December (the week after FBS conference championship games), is steeped in military pageantry and decades-old traditions, and is a unique combination of bitter competitiveness and mutual respect. Even though neither team has been nationally relevant in the modern era, thanks to players being subject to mandatory military commitments and weight limits, the game remains nationally televised to this day, and is now the last game of college football's regular season. While the game has been played in a number of places during its history, it's usually played in Philadelphia at the Eagles' home of Lincoln Financial Field. Both academies are now football-only members of the American Athletic Conference, but they will still play on their traditional date outside the conference. (In the very unlikely event that both qualify for the conference championship game, they will play in back-to-back weeks.)\n\nIvy League\n\n[edit]\n\nMuch like the Army-Navy game, the \"Ivy League\" - the conference of America's preeminent and most traditional educational institutions on the East Coast - has over a century of tradition, pageantry and rivalries, but in terms of the likelihood of any of the players on the field ever playing in the NFL, they are an afterthought. In part this is due to the Ivy League not giving scholarships based on sports ability alone. In addition, the Ivies play in Division I FCS, the second tier of NCAA football. That said, Ivy League alumni who've played an important part in the early history of the sport (for example, Walter Camp attended Harvard, and coached Amos Alonzo Stagg at Yale) continue to shape the game and its equipment with a former Harvard Quarterback founding the Xenith company that introduced a few innovations in helmet design.\n\nHistorically black colleges and universities (HBCUs)—schools founded during the era of legal segregation to educate African Americans—have unique football traditions of their own. Before the Civil Rights Movement, many traditional flagship universities in the South were off-limits to African Americans, with some not even allowed to play against integrated teams, much less all-black ones. Talented black players in the South who wanted to play in college had two options—leave the region, or play at an HBCU. In the immediate post-World War II era, many HBCU stars made their way to the NFL, with a significant number becoming all-time greats. The rival leagues the NFL had to fend off in the 1940s (AAFC) and 1960s (AFL) both became known for drafting more people from HBCUs and other small universities overlooked by the established and more conservative NFL. With integration, almost all of the most talented black players now attend traditional major schools, both within and outside the South, but the traditions of black college football are still a significant part of African-American culture—even if all of the HBCUs now play in Division I FCS, or in lower levels of college football. Similarly HBCUs now admit white students and they have of course taken to the Football field just as well as black students.\n\nMany HBCU games are marketed as \"classics\", often held at neutral sites and some in distant cities. When marketed in this way, the game is typically the culmination of several days of festivities, with concerts, parties, and \"battles of the bands\". The last of these involves special performances by the marching bands of the schools involved; HBCU bands are famous for incorporating extensive theatrics into their musical performances, and are not to be missed, whether at a halftime show or at an outside event.\n\nA little-known variant of college football governed completely outside the NCAA structure, sprint football is played under standard college rules, but its players can weigh no more than 178 pounds (81 kg). This weight limit places a premium on speed and agility. As of the next 2024 season, 16 schools play this variant (some of which also have full-sized teams), divided into two leagues. The Collegiate Sprint Football League features 9 schools in the northeastern quadrant of the country, including Army, Navy, and a couple of Ivy League schools. The Midwest Sprint Football League features 7 teams in the Midwest and Upper South.\n\nFor several decades, there was no championship tournament in Division I college football, unlike the NFL's Super Bowl or the NCAA's Final Four in basketball, but the post-season has been restructured into a unique tournament style. After the regular season, starting before Christmas and going until January, there are numerous bowl games. These games are heavily advertised and extremely profitable for the schools whose teams are picked to play in them, and also for the TV networks that offer live coverage. Some have long traditions, while others are much newer. The most famous is the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, which takes place every New Year's Day and is ushered in with a parade, but the Sugar Bowl (in the New Orleans Saints' stadium), the Cotton Bowl (in the Cowboys' stadium in Arlington), and the Orange Bowl (in the Miami Dolphins' stadium) are also famous and take place around New Year's. Since the 2014 season, these four bowls, along with the Fiesta Bowl (in the Arizona Cardinals' stadium near Phoenix) and Peach Bowl (in the Atlanta Falcons' stadium), are part of the College Football Playoff (CFP), the de facto national championship for major college football. Through the 2023 season, two of the six previously mentioned bowl games rotate as hosts of CFP semifinal games, while slots in the other four games are filled by other top teams. The winners of the two semifinals advance to the College Football Playoff National Championship, whose host is determined by open bidding several years in advance. Sites for the championship game have been announced through the 2025 season (with the title game being played early in the next calendar year).\n\nAlso of note is the Celebration Bowl, the only FCS bowl game and the de facto championship game for HBCU football. It features the champions of the two HBCU conferences, the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference and Southwestern Athletic Conference (the three HBCUs that are in other FCS conferences are left out). Played in the Falcons' stadium in Atlanta, it takes place on the Saturday after FBS conference champpionship games—the same day as the Army–Navy Game, although the Celebration Bowl kicks off at noon and Army–Navy at 3 pm.\n\nStarting with the 2024 season, the CFP will expand to 12 teams: the top five conference champions in the CFP rankings will automatically participate, but no conference will receive an automatic bid. The other seven slots will be selected by the same committee that ranks teams and invites playoff participants. The four top-ranked conference champions receive first-round byes; the remaining eight teams will play at the home stadiums of the higher seeds in each matchup (the higher seed can also designate an off-campus site). The quarterfinals and semifinals will be hosted by the current \"New Year's Six\" bowl games (Cotton, Fiesta, Orange, Peach, Rose, Sugar), with each bowl hosting two quarterfinals and one semifinal in a three-year cycle. As before, the CFP National Championship will be held at a predetermined site.\n\n2025: Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia (home of the Atlanta Falcons), 20 January\n\n2026: Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida (home of the Miami Dolphins), 19 January\n\nBowl games are huge events, so tickets may be expensive and hard to come by, especially for the major bowls listed above.\n\nThe lower divisions of college football each play a traditional single-elimination tournament, just like the majority of NCAA sports (with baseball and softball as the most notable exceptions)."
