Join 24,000 others and get exclusive access here üîë ‚Äî it‚Äôs free!\n\nI still remember this very clearly and it comes up every now and then.\n\nA few years ago at Boston University, my philosophy professor asked the international students in my class ‚Äúwhat is the strangest thing you observed when coming to America?‚Äù\n\nOne kid said all the food options. Another kid mentioned how different people are depending on which state you‚Äôre in.\n\nThen it was this girls turn from Scandinavia.\n\nShe introduces herself, where‚Äôs she from, and what she‚Äôs studying. Then the professor goes ‚ÄúWhat is the strangest thing about America?‚Äù\n\nShe looks up and says ‚ÄúAmerican Football. It‚Äôs two sides of men trying to kill each other and advance down the field. It‚Äôs so warlike and is only really played in America.‚Äù\n\nWow. I had never even thought of that before, but it still shocks me to this day of how right she is.\n\nLet‚Äôs dive in üëá\n\nThe History of American Football\n\nThe first American football game was played on November 6, 1869 between Rutgers and Princeton using rules based on soccer at the time. Rutgers won the game 6‚Äì4.\n\nA set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp, the \"Father of American Football\", established the snap, the line of scrimmage, eleven-player teams, and the concept of downs.\n\nDespite these new rules, football remained a violent sport. Dangerous mass-formations like the flying wedge resulted in serious injuries and deaths.\n\n19 fatalities occurred in 1905, which resulted in a threat by President Theodore Roosevelt to abolish the game unless major changes were made.\n\nIn response, 62 universities met in New York City to discuss rule changes in December of 1905. These proceedings resulted in the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later renamed the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).\n\nToday, nearly 1.1 million high school athletes and 70,000 college athletes play football in the United States annually.\n\nThe National Football League (NFL) is the most popular American professional league and has the highest average attendance of any professional sports league in the world.\n\nThe Super Bowl ranks among the most-watched club sporting events in the world.\n\nThe NFL has an annual revenue of around $13 billion, making it the most valuable sports league in the world.\n\nOn November 12, 1892, Pudge Heffelfinger was paid $500 to play a game for the Allegheny Athletic Association in a match against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club.\n\nThis is the first recorded instance of a player being paid to participate in a game of American football, although many athletic clubs in the 1880s offered indirect benefits such as:\n\nhelping players attain employment\n\ngiving out trophies or watches\n\npaying double in expense money\n\nFootball was founded not long after the Civil War, which I find as no surprise that it CLOSELY resembles war.\n\nFootball and The Similarities of War\n\nFootball and many combative team sports are really just modern expressions of warfare.\n\nHere are the main ones:\n\nStadiums\n\nLike the Roman Colosseum.\n\nFormations\n\nLike war. There‚Äôs an offense and a defense. How you align your players and put them to their specialties matters.\n\nAerial View.\n\nOffensive coordinators sit high like a spy plane.\n\nCheating.\n\nAnything to get an advantage. Cough Cough the Patriots.\n\nKickoff.\n\nTwo armies rushing at each other in war.\n\nCoaches.\n\nThe generals and decision makers.\n\nMedical staff.\n\nHelp injured players off the battlefield.\n\nArmor.\n\nPadding and equipment for protection and to enable fearlessness.\n\nWar, not a battle.\n\nLong seasons, as you‚Äôll lose some battles but the best warriors and generals come out on top at the end.\n\nFame.\n\nTop warriors were famous, just like the top football players enjoy similar benefits.\n\nInjuries.\n\nSoldiers might suffer from PTSD, where as NFL players suffer from CTE or other chronic pains.\n\nAmerica Loves War (And Football)\n\nJust like the Romans use to pack in a colosseum to watch the top warriors fight.\n\nAmericans pack into modern day colosseums to watch the top armies fight it out.\n\nGreat warriors were the highly-paid stars of days past and enjoyed the admiration of the people.\n\nIt is in ancient Rome that we get a great comparison between the warfare of times past and the warfare we see on fields across the earth today.\n\nThe Romans were warlike and organized, and they were used to winning. They built large stadiums in order to watch their bloodsports.\n\nDeriving from the broader football-as-war analogy, athletes become warriors or soldiers, whilst coaches are regarded as generals.\n\nThe offensive coordinator sits high above the fray (in the skybox), cold-bloodedly calling individual plays that are then executed by the team on the field. Each of the players is a cog in the machine as every one has been drilled and drilled until they do exactly as they‚Äôre told.\n\nThere is minimal decision making on the field, especially as wireless technology has improved.\n\nIn football, you‚Äôre always facing one direction, always trying to advance the ball towards the end zone.\n\nAmerican culture loves our individual heroes and we actively seek them out. Football seems tailor made for this, particularly since the NFL deliberately spotlights specific players.\n\nThe weekly sports shows, fantasy football, and pregame build ups intentionally pick ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù and ‚Äúbad guys.‚Äù\n\nThey love a special interest story, and play to American hero worship as much as possible.\n\nAmerican culture is far less responsive to sports that limit individual heroics. How is this a problem?\n\nIn football games, opposing teams often try to limit individuals instead of playing a fluid team sport. In war, military efforts often look for specific individuals to assassinate or capture.\n\nBut where is the game headed?\n\nThe Future of Football\n\nI think there‚Äôs a chance football will go extinct at some point in my life.\n\n‚ÄúNo Way!‚Äù is what you‚Äôre probably thinking. But hear me out.\n\nAmericans just want to be entertained and have a sense of pride in something.\n\nWe use to get our entertainment in blood and death.\n\nWe now get it through physical violence, but not in death.\n\nTechnology is advancing at a rapid pace and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before it catches up.\n\nIf e-Sports successfully merges with VR and AR, then that might be our new entertainment.\n\nThe best players will be playing in a virtual world with fans and no death or physical violence.\n\nDefinitely a possibility.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this deep dive!\n\nYou might watch the Super Bowl on Sunday with a slightly different perspective.\n\nI encourage you to share this article with someone else. Thank you!\n\nShare\n\nEnjoy the weekend,\n\n-Andrew"
