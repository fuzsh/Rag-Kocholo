        "text": "^ But there isn't any actual communication. I think you can stick a bunch of random people together and they can play volleyball. I think it's Basketball. In football (both footballs) your players are spread so far away you can barely communicate. In Basketball you're usually stuck in that half-court.\n\nTo the person that says football requires more, the NBA is on a whole different level. You have go to guys, some of the guys are playing for stats, it's a show. People want to see Kobe net 30+ a game. You go a step down, in college ball there's a lot more distribution and you don't usually get super high scoring guys. Then you go to pick up basketball, 3 on 3 half court games a lot of ball movement.\n\n^ But there isn't any actual communication.

Then you go to pick up basketball, 3 on 3 half court games a lot of ball movement\n\nDid you ever play volleyball. No seriously, not making fun or anything. There is little to no communictaion because there is no time to. I play soccer, basketball, and volleyball and I am on my school's team for all three, and I know what its like. In volleyball you are either all organised and ready to help each other or you all lose. In soccer and basketball, one player can stall while the others get ready, but in volleyball, you have to be ready to help your teammate or you're screwed.\n\nFootball, I have played all sports mentioned. Football requires at least 22 players to be on the same page. If one person doesn't do their job on one play, that could be the game. To whoever said there is no communication in football, you obviously haven't played it. If anything it has the most communictaion(not saying it does). Not only do you need good players to play in football you need the other 56 on the roster to be good so they can help you practice. If you have clowns on your team aside from your strarting 22 your not going anywhere(You won't get good looks in practice). Plus you need another say 5 off the bench to know plays and be able to work with everyone else. In basketball you have 1 or 2 off the bench for the most part. Their is no 1 man band man in football if you can tell me a team that was lead to win a Super Bowl because of 1 player than lemme' know. You can have clowns on the basketball court and someone like Lebron can make up for that a'la what was it 23 of the last 24 points against the Pistons. Lebron's performance wasn't nice passes to him, oops, or pick and rolls. It was give him the ball at half court, let him dribble up the court, than press the lane on Chauncy and slam it in Tayshawn Prince's face. That wasn't team play that was Lebron taking over a game. You can't do that in any other sport, just feed someone the ball and expect super results and win the game. You ever wonder why there isn't a best football player of all time? While in baseball you have Babe Ruth and in Basketball you have MJ. There is no best player in football, you have best people at their positions, but that is as far as it goes. Not saying that it is a fact but just my reasons for thinking it does require the most teamplay."
