The commitment of your time and your willingness to do your best. “Another disadvantage to playing football is that the sport requires a significant commitment of time. Often, during the season a player's schedule revolves entirely around the team -- practices, gym workouts, games, film breakdown -- and it makes life considerably more hectic”(Goldsmith). The hectic schedule can cause the players to lack behind in their classes and can also stress the student out because they have to be able to perform their best both in the sport and their\n\nBy participating in football people can learn sportsmanship, hard work, discipline, and teamwork. Considering the many lessons it teaches, teamwork and discipline play the main role. With teamwork, players/children are learning how to trust their teammates the more experience they have with each other. As for discipline, it teaches kids to work hard and set good goals which can be helpful for them in the future as opposed to not playing, and being a step behind. NFL expert Jobe Lewis says that “football requires a pretty unique brand of teamwork and requires the player to discipline himself and to work hard” (Lewis 1).\n\nThese skills include preparation, management, dedication, and motivation. For example, preparation is used when waiting for the play to start or to catch the ball. Dedication when they put their time and effort to improve or committing to the team. Football also has many health benefits including increased bone density and mass. This reduces the players chance of bone and joint related diseases as they get older. Another major life skill being teamwork and work ethic. This is a life skill because it teaches the players how to collaborate with one another as they would need in another job with colleagues. Let’s not forget about all the jobs that would be lost due to football being taken away such as the players, coaches, and referees for\n\nInvolving a group will have a great impact on our lives. My involvement in college’s football team is an example. The purpose of our group is to prepare for the Med Cup and University Football Association games. Our most important value is to win as much as possible. Furthermore, there are several norms we all keep in mind. One is to play every game with all our hearts. That is, even when we are just playing a friendly game, we should pay our attention to the ball and play as well as we can. Another is to realize the spirit of teamwork. In other words, we must always trust our teammates at any time. By the way, when a new person joins the team, he or she needs to learn how to play correctly and spend much time practicing the\n\nSport’s are an aspect of life that affect societies across the globe. Athletics affect everyone's life, whether that be playing the sport, watching games, or hearing about a sporting event. There is a big difference between playing an individual sport and players relying on their own athletic abilities versus a team sport when members of the team rely on their teammates to complete each individual's specific responsibility to reach the team's goal. Team sports bring people together in countless ways, and they teach many life skills for the athletes that participate in them. Some of these skills include communication, teamwork, discipline, work ethic, dedication, leadership, and numerous more that will help them in their personal and work\n\nTeamwork is a key skill that everyone should have installed in them at a young age.The brain of a child is like a sponge, they absorb everything and use it in the future. Playing football is not an individual sport unlike competitive swim or boxing, when playing a sport heavy contact or not as a team a child learns to work with others to achieve a common goal of winning or advancing. Children become cooperative and have the ability to collaborate with others making them more resourceful and beneficial in any real life situation. According to live strong representative and author of article “Benefits of Teamworks in Sports” Wade Harle, stated “ Teamwork in sports can help give participants stronger communication skills and teach them to work better with others. Additional advantages to teamwork in sports are learning to deal with conflict and varieties of different ideas within a team.” As the young child grows and prospers into a young adult having the teamwork ability and characteristic will only gain them the upper hand when applying for jobs, working on projects and in life commitments and relationships.\n\nWhen people work together they can make more progress than when they work solo. In the novel Hiroshima, Hersey shows that when people work together, they are stronger. On page 58, the Jesuits banded together to assist the injured people and get them to the church. The Jesuits helped about fifty people and took them to the chapel of the Novitiate. “The Rector gave them what medical care he could--- mostly cleaning away of the pus.” This shows the Jesuits assisting the refugees to the church. Then the Rector cleaning their wounds. On a football field, it takes the whole team to make progress during the game. To run or pass the ball, the offensive line has to participate most of all. The offensive line needs to block the defensive line to move\n\nCommunication is the key to success. A team without communication could never be successful. Communication is important because the group needs a clear goal and also they need to have shared objectives. For example, in football a defense needs to be on the same page; if two players on the defense are on different pages then the defense will not be successful. You need everyone to share the same objective in order to succeed, not just a few people but all as one. To ensure a team’s success, everyone on the team has to be accountable. Everyone has a job on the team to contribute to becoming successful as a whole. Also you need trust in order to become successful; you have to be able to trust in your team that they will give their all for the team.\n\nIn every sport there are a lot of factor that will affect the way the athletes will perform. It is important to take into consideration all of them, but there are a few that are crucial to the overall success of the team or even just the athlete itself. There a need for cohesion with in the team and with the staff enables the players to succeed in the sport. Football is a sport among others that requires strong team cohesion to function as a whole. The Denver Broncos are one example of how team cohesion plays a vital importance in the success of the team and the performance of each of the players that are on the field. Overall, each person is needed, but it vital that the quarterback, running back, and the wide receiver are able to play perfectly.\n\nAs far as athletes on the field a great many lessons are often learned there and one of the biggest lessons is sportsmanship. For any sports played teamwork is often times essential for winning. It also allows for a person to become more confident in their own abilities allowing them to become more proud and not ashamed of what they can or cannot do. It allows players to build bonds among their teammates and while this maybe be one of the main creators of the “jocks hang out with jocks” stereotype it is only because athletes feel a connection to someone that is going through the same time of training and emotions that sports tend to create. Sportsmanship teaches a person the value of working together in groups and allows the player to learn how to adjust to situations that he or she may not agree with. The work ethic sportsmanship creates is also carried off the field as well into the school and more importantly the working environment, because we all know that in our lifetimes we are going to have to work with someone that we do not like or agree with. And having the ability to be able to work through a problem which sportsmanship can do allows for an easier job experience.\n\nThis directly translates into their studies and their lives. In these team sports, success or failure in competition depends on many variables. When these variables align through effective teamwork a successful play emerges as the teammates work together through coordination, communication and cohesion in training to achieve this result. Everyone has a role in the team and is expected to execute their task effectively. Any sort of individualism proves detrimental to the team as we all know, there is no “I” in"
