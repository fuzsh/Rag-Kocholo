        "text": "Earlier I was responding to a discussion post, similar to a blog post, and I had a bit of a new revelation between teams and groups. I will admit that I too am guilty of using each terms interchangeably because I’ve never quite defined the terms in relation to team leadership. Team leadership defines teams as individuals working together to achieve a common goal. Groups on the other hand, defined by team leadership, as individuals working separately though achieving common goals. (The Pennsylvania State University) Luckily, I have a little star athlete who has been on multiple sports team that allowed me to interview him. My brother Scott has played baseball for two seasons, wrestling for four, and track for three so we chatted about teams and the variation of events or positions of each sport.\n\nDuring this time of the year, summer 2014, the biggest sport event of the year is the World Cup, so “FOOTBALL” and no it isn’t American football but what we here in America often refer to as soccer. After completing a quick refresher and search of soccer field positions, there’s the goalkeeper, defenders, midfielders, forwards, and hybrid positions who work together as a team to defend opponents from scoring and score into your opponents as often as possible. Soccer works as a team not so much as a team. The eleven players on the field work with one another to achieve one goal win. Now, take sports like wrestling and track while both sports are essentially a “team” players do fall into the definition of group where all individuals work solely in achieving a common goal.\n\nMy baby brother Scott played a team sport of baseball as defined by team leadership. I would categorize baseball as a team sport because it, essentially requires players to work together to achieve a common goal at least in outfield and a player at bat is playing like one were in a group because the player is an individual working solely to achieve a common goal. Typically I would also categorize both track and wrestling as a group sport too because of the core concepts of these sports: Wrestling at 120 and now 140-145 weight classes Scott wrestles one-on-one with his opponents there isn’t a such thing as team wrestling matches except only in professional wrestling like in the WWE. In some of his track events he would run the 100m and 400m also perform in both high jump and long jump events solely to achieve a common goal. One factor, I have failed to mention in relation to the mentioned sports above, they are essentially a team and no not because they’re attempting to achieve a common goal, but the important aspects of any sport, camaraderie and sportsmanship. Earlier I asked Scott if he would define his positions in wrestling and track as either a team or a group, and he said a team. “We work together whether it be on the mat assisting with coaching or on the sidelines of a track field cheering one another on always.”\n\nReference:"
