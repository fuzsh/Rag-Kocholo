The sport is played on a rectangular field with goal-posts at the end by two teams of eleven players each with an oval-shaped ball. The sport was originated in the United States and is the combination of association football and rugby. It is also the most popular game in the country whereas, professional and college football are the two most popular forms of the sport.
