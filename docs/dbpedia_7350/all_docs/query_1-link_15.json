        "text": "well the answer depends how you ask the question. Clearly if it's turnover, then soccer wins, with not even a hint of a contest, but then with so many clubs that's not exactly surprising.\n\nIn profit the NFL wins hands down because with the salary cap it's possibly to suppress salaries and the players have no option of going elsewhere.\n\nRemember what a So called Silvio Berlusconi said at the height of Milans success,this is not a profit making business, at that time Milan was making losses,yet they would sign the best players,the Milans,Inters,Reals of this world don't have to make profits they are all about trophys and getting the players they want,just like Barca will not have any advertisements on their shirts or the nike swoosh cannot be white in color. More Money in soccer is easily translated as a means to buy the best players not who is doing the best business,look at Real's rooster,before the end of the baseball season their payroll was slightly larger than the Yankees,just like the Yankees Org it's all about the trophys, pride counts more than dollars in this business. You cannot compare the two sports in this respect,what NFL team will offer to pay up a players taxes,guess who will Inter,Real cause they will do anything to get what they want and thats trophys.\n\nOne league in one country v multiple leagues in multiple countries, how is this even a contest. If you are talking Gross, then there is no question Soccer will win. But if you compare the NFL to say just EPL or La Liga or any other single league then I would be interested to see that comparison.\n\nMy question why even have these debates? NFL is a different game then soccer, played primarily in the US. Who needs to make themselves feel better here? NFL fans or Soccer fans??\n\nIf my sums are right the NFL has a $17.6 billion TV deal over 8 years.\n\nThat's $2.2 billion per year.\n\nIf there are 32 NFL teams that's $68.75 per year per team (I think the $142 million per club figure must be turnover, not profit, as I can't see where they could get an extra $75 million per year)\n\nThe best TV deal in soccer is probably the premiership, where each team gets a basic Â£18 million per year or $32.5 million. So on that front the NFL wins easily, but then again, with the size of the TV markets in each country, it's hardly surprising. The USA has five times the population of England.\n\nYou're correct: in the US, we use the term \"revenue\" in the same way you are using the term \"turnover.\" It is a measure of gross receipts, which included TV, ticket receipts, licensing and all. It is good business practice that the owners were able to negotiate a salary cap with the player since, as you point out, it helps limit their liabilities. Wasn't Serie A trying to do something similar, or did that not pan out?\n\nSoccer makes more, but if you are one of the few NFL owners, you are all but GUARANTEED you are going to make money. There are no Leeds United in this league. The NFL is an absolute monopoly. In the NFL, there is a salary cap for two reasons (1) Competitive balance - it makes the TV networks and most of the owners happy that each year 80% of the teams have a chance at winning. How many EPL teams think they are going to finish in the top 4? Probably 4. (2) If the player doesn't like how much they make, where are they going? Arena football? Canada? I don't think so. In soccer, you don't like how much you make, you can go to just about any other country in the world and play."
