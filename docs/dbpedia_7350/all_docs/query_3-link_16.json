        "text": "Mark Murphy is president and CEO of the NFL's Green Bay Packers (@packers) and a member of PCA's National Advisory Board. Before joining the Packers, Murphy served as athletic director for Colgate University and Northwestern University. Earlier, he was an All-Pro defensive back for the NFL's Washington, DC franchise.\n\nHere, Mark explains how football stands out in terms of the lessons that players learn about teamwork. Drawing from his experience as a collegiate athletic director, where he oversaw operations in multiple sports at once, Mark singles out football as the truest example of a team sport, in which success is impossible without each individual contributing to the team.\n\nBecause a football season has so few games relative to other sports' seasons, football creates a unique emphasis on preparation for each game, as each game is so important to the rest of the season. From his own career experience, Murphy has learned valuable lessons about accepting loss and learning how to properly deal with success. He adds that these lessons help with experiences outside of sports, as well.\n\nWritten by Mimi Fhima"
