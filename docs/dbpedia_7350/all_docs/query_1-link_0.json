        "text": "Sport with players in opposing teams\n\nA team sport is a type of sport where the fundamental nature of the game or sport requires the participation of multiple individuals working together as a team, and it is inherently impossible or highly impractical to execute the sport as a single-player endeavour. In team sports, the cooperative effort of team members is essential for the sport to function and achieve its objectives. The objective often involves teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar object in accordance with a set of rules in order to score points. Examples are basketball, volleyball, rugby, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey. These sports emphasize teamwork, strategy, and coordination among team members while competing against opposing teams to achieve a common goal.[2] Team sports do not include individual or individual-to-team events within a sport.[citation needed]\n\nDistinctions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe meaning of a \"team sport\" has been disputed in recent years. Some types of sports have different objectives or rules than \"traditional\" team sports. These types of team sports do not involve teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar object in accordance with a set of rules in order to score points. Overall, the division into team sports and individual sports is not always unproblematic since there are different combinations in the individual sports.\n\nTeam sports and individual-to-team events\n\n[edit]\n\nPure team sports\n\n[edit]\n\nThis includes sports that can only be practiced as a team sport. The number of team members is fixed for the team. In order to compete successfully in championships and tournaments, teams need a roster that is significantly larger than the number of players starting the game. Players may be substituted from a squad in competition matches to replace exhausted or injured players or to make tactical changes. Examples are basketball, volleyball, rugby, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey.\n\nTeams of two people are common in certain sports, such as dancesport or beach volleyball. No substitute players are used here. The two partners are absolutely dependent on each other. The absence of a person here means a loss of competitiveness.[3][4][5]\n\nFormations\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition, there are sports, while mostly played in singles, that are also played in different formations together cooperatively, such as badminton, table tennis, or tennis in doubles. However, this formation is significantly lower in terms of prestige, spectators, and prize money.[6] In these formations, common tactics, teamwork, and agreements are crucial for success. There are also different rowing formations, such as one, two, four, and eight, or sailing with their different boat classes.[7][8] The most important thing here is smooth movements and common tactics. This also applies approximately to the team time trial in cycling,[9][10] which is the case with cycling tours and one-day races, which are different tasks for the team members of a cycling team.[11][12]\n\nRelays\n\n[edit]\n\nIn some sports, relay races are held, which can be distinguished from pure team evaluations by a common racing tactic and the observance of change regulations. Relay races are common in running, swimming, cross-country skiing, biathlon, or short-track speed skating and are also an integral part of the Olympic Games program[13] with high popularity. [14][15]\n\nTeam ratings\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are team ratings in many sports, and the results of individual athletes or formations are added up. In cycling, team members, whilst still in competition with each other, will also work towards assisting one member of the team, usually a specialist, to the highest possible finishing position.[12][11][16] In some sports where participants are entered by a team, they do not only compete against members of other teams, but also against each other for points towards championship standings, for example, in motorsport, particularly Formula One.[17] Team orders can occur in such teams and although previously accepted were banned in Formula One[18] between 2002 and 2010. After a controversy involving team orders at the 2010 German Grand Prix however, the regulation was removed as of the 2011 season.[19]\n\nOverview comparison\n\n[edit]\n\nOverview comparison Team Sports Formations in Sports Relay Races Sports with Team Ratings (e.g., Soccer, Basketball) (e.g., Synchronized Swimming, Doubles Tennis) (e.g., Track and Field relay, Swimming relay) (e.g., Gymnastics, Figure skating)\n\nIn team sports, the entire game or match revolves around team dynamics.\n\nThe outcome depends on collective performance throughout the entire duration of the match.\n\nThe teamwork, strategy, and coordination among team members are crucial for success.\n\nDo not include individual or individual-to-team events within a sport.\n\nThese sports can be performed individually, but they also have team variations.\n\nIn synchronized swimming, swimmers perform coordinated routines together.\n\nIn doubles tennis, two players collaborate as a team to compete against another pair.\n\nTeam formations enhance the strategic and cooperative elements of these sports.\n\nRelay races involve teams, but they are often a series of individual efforts within a team context.\n\nEach team member runs a segment of the race independently.\n\nSuccess depends on both individual speed and the smooth transition between the athletes.\n\nThese sports include individual performances, but the team rating considers the cumulative scores of all team members.\n\nTeam members' performances contribute to the team's overall score, but they may perform their routines individually.\n\nTeam strategy involves selecting the right competitors for specific events to maximize the team's chances.\n\nIn summary, team sports are characterized by the impossibility or impracticality of executing the sport as a single-player endeavor, and the entire game or match relies on team dynamics. In contrast, sports with team ratings and formations involve both individual and team aspects, where individual performances contribute to a team's overall success but may not be entirely reliant on team dynamics. Relay races combine individual efforts within a team context, where smooth transitions are essential.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of sport\n\nAreas around the Mediterranean had a long tradition of athletic events. Ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians depicted athletic scenes in the tombs of kings and their nobles. They did not, however, hold regular competitions, and those events that occurred were probably the preserve of kings and upper classes. Minoans culture held gymnastics in high esteem, with bull-leaping, tumbling, running, wrestling and boxing shown on their frescoes. The Mycenaeans adopted Minoan games and also raced chariots in religious or funerary ceremonies.[20][21] Homer's heroes participate in athletic competitions to honor the dead. In the Iliad there are chariot races, boxing, wrestling, a foot race, as well as fencing, archery, and spear throwing. The Odyssey adds to these a long jump and discus throw.[22]\n\nIt was in Greece that sports were first instituted formally, with the first Olympic Games recorded in 776 BCE in Olympia, where they were celebrated until 393 CE.[23] These ancient Olympic Games consisted of running, long jump, boxing, wrestling, Pankration (combat sport), discus throw, and javelin throw.[24] In the Bayankhongor Province of Mongolia, Neolithic-era cave paintings dating to 7000 BC depict a wrestling match surrounded by crowds.[25] Prehistoric cave-paintings in Japan show a sport similar to sumo wrestling.[26] In Wadi Sura, near Gilf Kebir in Libya, a Neolithic rock painting in the cave of swimmers shows evidence of swimming and archery being practiced around 6000 BC.[27]\n\nTeam sports have a rich and ancient history dating back thousands of years. These activities served as important facets of society, not only for physical fitness but also for social, cultural, and even political purposes. In ancient civilizations, team sports were prevalent and often intertwined with religious and cultural practices. In Mesoamerica, the Aztec ball game, ollamaliztli, was not just a sport but also a ritual with symbolic significance.[28]\n\nThe Greeks, who laid the foundations for many contemporary sports, held various team sports as central to their culture. The Olympic Games, first recorded in 776 BCE, featured events like chariot racing and team foot races, fostering unity and friendly competition among city-states.[29] The Spartans, known for their military prowess, engaged in team sports like the episkyros, a type of football.[30]\n\nRome adopted and adapted many Greek sports, introducing harpastum, a ball game similar to soccer, and ludi circenses, which included team chariot racing. These sports provided a sense of entertainment and unity, while also serving as a means of social control.[31]\n\nIn ancient China, cuju was a popular team sport akin to modern soccer, played as early as the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). The sport was not only a form of entertainment but also a means of fostering camaraderie among communities.[32]\n\nThroughout history, team sports have reflected the values and priorities of their respective cultures. Whether it was the competitive spirit of the Greeks, the discipline of the Romans, or the communal bonding in China, ancient team sports played an integral role in the social fabric of civilizations. They transcended mere physical activity, serving as a testament to the enduring significance of sports in human history. Today, these ancient traditions continue to influence modern team sports, reminding us of the timeless appeal and cultural importance of collective athletic endeavors.\n\nOlympic team sports\n\n[edit]\n\nstatus after the 2022 Winter Olympics\n\nCurrent Olympic team sports (16)\n\n[edit]\n\nSummer Olympics (14)\n\nSource:[33]\n\nSport Men Women First edition Editions First edition Editions Cricket at the Summer Olympics [Note OG_2028] Paris 1900 1 Los Angeles 2028 not yet held Football at the Summer Olympics Paris 1900 27 Atlanta 1996 7 Water polo at the Summer Olympics Paris 1900 28 Sydney 2000 6 Lacrosse at the Summer Olympics [Note OG_2028] St. Louis 1904 2 Los Angeles 2028 not yet held Field hockey at the Summer Olympics London 1908 24 Moscow 1980 11 Basketball at the Summer Olympics Berlin 1936 20 Montreal 1976 12 Basketball (3x3) at the Summer Olympics Tokyo 2020 1 Tokyo 2020 1 Handball at the Summer Olympics Berlin 1936 14 Montreal 1976 12 Volleyball at the Summer Olympics Tokyo 1964 15 Tokyo 1964 15 Baseball at the Summer Olympics [Note OG_2028] Barcelona 1992 6 — — Softball at the Summer Olympics [Note OG_2028] — — Atlanta 1996 5 Beach volleyball at the Summer Olympics Atlanta 1996 7 Atlanta 1996 7 Rugby sevens at the Summer Olympics Rio de Janeiro 2016 2 Rio de Janeiro 2016 2 Flag football at the Summer Olympics [Note OG_2028] Los Angeles 2028 not yet held Los Angeles 2028 not yet held\n\nNotes\n\nWinter Olympics (2)\n\nIce hockey and curling are team sports at the Winter Olympics, with particularity that the men's tournament in Ice hockey was introduced at the 1920 Summer Olympics and was transferred permanently to the Winter Olympic Games program in 1924, in France. Before the monobob event has been introduced as an additional women's class by the IBSF for the 2020–21 world cup season and the 2022 Olympic games, bobsleigh was considered as a pure team sport, that can only be practiced as a team with at least two drivers. At the present time the men's events consist of the two-man and four-man class and the women's events are restricted only to the two-woman and women's monobob class.[35]\n\nSport Men Women First edition Editions First edition Editions Ice hockey at the Winter Olympics Antwerp 1920 25 Nagano 1998 7 Curling at the Winter Olympics Chamonix 1924 8 Nagano 1998 7\n\nDiscontinued Olympic team sports (3)\n\n[edit]\n\nPolo at the Summer Olympics (on 5 editions: 1900 Paris, 1908 London, 1920 Antwerp, 1924 Paris, 1936 Berlin)\n\nRugby Union at the Summer Olympics (on 4 editions: 1900 Paris, 1908 London, 1920 Antwerp, 1924 Paris)\n\nTug of War at the Summer Olympics (on 5 editions: 1900 Paris to 1920 Antwerp)\n\nDemonstration team sports at the Olympic Games (9)\n\n[edit]\n\nGaelic football (on 1 edition as a demonstration sport: 1904 St. Louis)\n\nAmerican football (on 2 editions as a demonstration sport: 1904 St. Louis and Los Angeles 1932)\n\nHurling (on 1 edition as a demonstration sport: 1904 St. Louis)\n\nCycle polo (on 1 edition as a demonstration sport: London 1908)\n\nKorfball (on 2 editions as a demonstration sport: 1920 Antwerp and Amsterdam 1928)\n\nKaatsen (on 1 edition as a demonstration sport: Amsterdam 1928)\n\nPesäpallo (on 1 edition as a demonstration sport: Helsinki 1952)\n\nAustralian football (on 1 edition as a demonstration sport: Melbourne 1956)\n\nRoller hockey (on 1 edition as a demonstration sport: 1992 Barcelona)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nSports portal\n\nList of sports\n\nOlympic Sports\n\nIndividual sport\n\nMajor professional sports teams of the United States and Canada\n\nMost valuable player\n\nProfessional sports leagues in the United States\n\nRelay race\n\nSports strategy\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography"
