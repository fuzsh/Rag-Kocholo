        "text": "Terungwa Gyanggyang\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n5 min read\n\n·\n\nMar 2, 2024\n\n--\n\nI was watching a movie a while ago … pardon me, I don’t remember the name… but it was about American football. The setting was in a small town in the American country where the two most important activities was farming and football. They had a high school with a football program that had made a name for themselves nationwide. The scene that caught my attention was at the beginning, where the school program was running preseason tryouts to select players for the coming season. Nervous parents were sitting in the stands encouraging their boys to do their best. In that community, it was a thing of pride and brag-worthiness to have your son play on the high school team plus he had a chance at a college scholarship, so the stakes were high… maybe too high.\n\nOne player, who was pretty good, got hurt during a scrimmage game and the coach, who was a no-nonsense guy and well respected in the society, cut him from the final team. The boy’s father after the practice went to the coach to make a case for his son pointing out that his son would have surely made the team if not for the minor injury, basically trying to convince him that his boy, if given a chance would be up and running in no time… but the coach bluntly refused. As everyone was leaving, the father while assisting his limping son towards his car passed in front of the coach. The coach, in a sinister attempt to console the disappointed father said… “it’s a war out there!” … Let’s stop right there! …We’ll come back to this story.\n\nIn the arenas of sports and the theaters of war, there exists a fascinating parallel between the dynamics of a team on the field and an army on the battlefield. Though the objectives differ greatly, the processes of recruitment, training, teamwork, leadership, strategic planning, physical exertion and camaraderie demonstrate uncanny similarities. Let’s explore a little.\n\nRecruitment: In both sports and the military, recruitment serves as the foundational step towards forming a formidable unit. Athletes and soldiers are selected based on their individual skills, capabilities, and potential contribution to the collective success of the team or army. The recruitment process ensures that each member possesses the necessary attributes to complement the overall objectives.\n\nNow back to my story at the beginning of this article. The coach, in a sinister attempt to console the disappointed father said… “it’s a war out there!” The father turned to the coach and replied “no it’s not! I’ve been to war; football is a sport!” With all these similarities between sports and war … THEY ARE NOT THE SAME! … it’s important to highlight how they are different. So, what’s the difference between the two? Well for starters, sports is fun and war is not! One brings people together, the other drives them apart. One builds societies and the other destroys. One is very life threatening; the other is not! … very life threatening. There seems to be a very thin and delicate line between sports and warfare and sometimes the line can become blurred … especially when the stakes are high. It’s in situations like this where you see fanatics approaching sports like war and psychopaths approaching war like sport."
