        "text": "Karlene Sugarman explains how you can assess and develop a cohesive team.\n\nThe concept of teamwork is essential to the success of any team. All coaches talk about working as one unit, as a unified team. Teamwork and unselfishness create the backbone of a great team. Without them, a team cannot realistically compete. You can have a group of superstars, but if they do not work well as one unit, chances are they are not going to be as successful as you would think. The team working as one cohesive unit is going to be the key to their success.\n\nWhat to look for\n\nHere are some things to take into consideration when you are looking at your team:\n\nDoes your team have agreed-upon goals they created as a team?\n\nDo the players openly encourage and support one another?\n\nDo they have open communication with one another, as well as the coaching staff?\n\nDoes each player know what their role on the team is?\n\nIs there mutual respect among the players and coaching staff?\n\nDo players use statements such as \"we\" when referring to the team, or is it more of an \"every man for himself\" mentality?\n\nHave they created a positive team image for themselves?\n\nAre the individual contributions of each player recognised (regardless of whether he/she is a starter or not a starter)?\n\nIs the team as a whole committed to improving performance?\n\nDoes each member consider themselves as a \"team player?\"\n\nA productive team has players that share common goals, a shared vision, and some level of interdependence that requires both verbal and physical interaction. Teams come into existence through shared attitudes about a particular sport. They may come together for several different reasons, but their goals are the same - to achieve peak performance and experience success. The ends may differ, but how one gets there is the same - teamwork. Every member of the team is accountable when it comes to teamwork.\n\nTeamwork\n\nTo succeed at the task at hand, everyone involved needs to combine their efforts. If everyone does their job well, then it increases what the team can accomplish. This teamwork has to be recognised by everyone and knows that great things can happen if individuals master the fundamentals and work together as one unit. Everyone has a unique role, but each person's position must be recognised and appreciated.\n\nTeamwork is something that must be a high priority and given constant attention. Every player needs to understand how important it is for them to work smoothly together if they want to be successful. Each player must be dedicated to the whole team and be willing to act unselfishly. When challenges arise (as they always do), the team needs to have the resources, accountability, and commitment to deal with them constructively and positively. A sense of teamwork will play an integral part in this.\n\nJust remember T.E.A.M. - Together Everyone Achieves More!\n\nAbout the Author\n\nKarlene is a Mental Training Consultant in California and works with athletes and teams teaching mental training techniques and team-building strategies.
