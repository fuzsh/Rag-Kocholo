        "text": "American Football - Quick Guide\n\nAmerican Football - Overview\n\nAmerican Football originated in United States resembling a union of Rugby and Soccer; played in between two teams with each team of eleven players. American football gained fame as the people wanted to detach themselves from the English influence. The father of this sport is Walter Camp who altered the shape and size of the ball to an oval-shaped ball called ovoid ball and drawn up some unique set of rules.\n\nObjective\n\nAmerican Football is played on a four sided ground with goalposts at each end. The two opposing teams are named as the Offense and the Defense, The offensive team with control of the ovoid ball, tries to go ahead down the field by running and passing the ball, while the defensive team without control of the ball, targets to stop the offensive team’s advance and tries to take control of the ball for themselves.\n\nThe main objective of the sport is scoring maximum number of goals by moving forward with the ball into the opposite team's end line for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the challenger's goalposts which is counted as a goal and the team gets points for the goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.\n\nTeam Size\n\nAmerican football is played in between two teams and each team consists of eleven players on the field and four players as substitutes with total of fifteen players in each team. It is played in both men’s and women’s category.\n\nAmerican Football - History\n\nThe history of American Football starts from November 6, 1869, when the first game was played between the two college teams which were Princeton and Rutgers. Each team consisted of 25 players and had to play the game by foot only. Hands were not used to carry the ball. Players could use their hands, feet, head, and sides to kick the ball. The aim of each team was to reach the goal of the opponent and kick the ball into the goalpost.\n\nThe game was won by Rutgers as they were able to gain 6 points while the other team got 4 points only. This type of game was played between colleges for several years and the rules of the host school were followed.\n\nFixing Game Rules\n\nLater, colleges decided to fix a set of rules for the game so representatives of the following colleges held a meeting on October 19, 1873 −\n\nYale\n\nColumbia\n\nPrinceton\n\nRutgers\n\nIn the meeting, it was decided that the number of players on each side would be reduced to 20. The size of the field was 400 x 200 feet. No representative from Harvard University participated in the meeting as they wanted to follow the rules for this game similar to Rugby.\n\nHarvard played two games with McGill University. In the first game, American rules were followed and in the second Canadian rules were followed. Harvard gave preference to the Canadian rules and involved the following −\n\nOnly 11 players on each side\n\nPlayers can chase the ball and will not be chased by the opponent\n\nOblong ball should be used rather than the round one\n\nThe forward pass and tackling were also included\n\nHarvard and Yale played the game in 1875 which was watched by the two athletes of Princeton so they started playing the game in their university. Later, an association was formed by Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Harvard and they also decided to make modifications to the rules. The association was named as Intercollegiate Football Association. Yale joined the association in 1879.\n\nFather of American Football\n\nWalter Camp from Yale University made changes to the rules and came to be known as the Father of American Football. He reduced the number of players to 11 on each side and also made rules to reduce the chaotic environment.\n\nEvolution of American Football\n\nIn Rugby football, scrum occurred often. Scrum is a part of Rugby in which players used to handle the ball for an indefinite period and the game has to be restarted.\n\nYale and Princeton played a game in 1881 and used the rule of holding the ball for an indefinite period. None of the teams could score any point and the game ended in a tie as both teams scored 0. This game became unpopular among the audience, teams and fans also did not like it.\n\nIn 1882, Walter Camp changed the rule and each team was limited to 3 downs or tackles, and the ball had to be taken till 5 yards. If the team is unable to take the ball to 5 yards, the ball will be handed to the other team. The change in this rule gave birth to the American Football. A five-yard line was also drawn on the field.\n\nSome more changes were made to the rules which are as follows −\n\nThe field size was reduced to 100.6m x 48.8m\n\nFour points were given for a touchdown\n\nTwo points were awarded for safety\n\nFive points for a goal from the field\n\nTwo points for a goal following a touchdown\n\nPlayers can tackle below the waist\n\nThreat to abolish the game\n\nThe rules were changed but still, it was a violent game and players were injured and some also died. President Theodore Roosevelt threatened that the game would be abolished if major changes in the rules were not made as 19 players died in 1905.\n\nIn order to make changes, a meeting was held in New York City by 62 colleges and universities on December 18, 1905. This led to the creation of an association called Intercollegiate Athletic Association whose name was changed later to National Collegiate Athletic Association. The changes made in the rules are as follows −\n\nForward pass was introduced in 1906\n\nThe duration of the game was reduced from 70 minutes to 60 minutes\n\nThe first down was increased from 5 yards to 10 yards\n\nA neutral zone was created so that chaos could be reduced\n\nPoints for a field goal were reduced to 3 in 1909\n\nPoints for touchdowns was increased to 6 in 1912\n\nThe size of the field was also reduced in the same year which included the following −\n\nThe length of the field was reduced to 100 yards\n\nTwo end zones of 10 yards each were created\n\nTeams were allowed for four downs which previously was 3\n\nAnother rule was added in 1914 where a penalty was added for roughing the passer\n\nIn 1918, players were allowed to catch the ball anywhere on the field\n\nProfessional Era\n\nIn the 1880s, players were given extra benefits like getting a job. Trophies were also given to them by the athletic clubs. Some clubs also paid double for the money spent by a player but there was no direct payment.\n\nOn November 12, 1892, A sum of $500 was paid to Pudge Heffelfinger for playing a game for the Allegheny Athletic Association. The opponent in this match was Pittsburg Athletic Club and this was the first game in which direct payment was made to the players. This led to a rise in the number of professionals and salaries were given to the players. This also led to illegal payments to the players who were still studying in colleges.\n\nNational Football League (NFL)\n\nThe National Football League (NFL), established in 1920, decided to resolve this problem. Bidding wars for players was ended and college students were not allowed to play the game. It also made a rule that if a player changes the team, no payment will be made. NFL became the premier professional football league in 1922.\n\nAt this time, American Football was played mostly by college students at the college level. In 1925, an exhibition game was held in which the Pottsville Maroons defeated Notre Dame all-stars. Football became a popular game due to the 1958 NFL Championship game which was played between the Baltimore Colts and New York Giants. Millions of people watched the game and Colts scored 23 points while Giants scored 17.\n\nThe popularity of American Football led to the creation of the American Football League which helped to increase the popularity of the game in the United States. NFL was the dominating league and it was challenged by AFL by getting a television contract with ABC Television Network.\n\nThis forced the NFL to increase its capacity to Minnesota and Dallas to curb the expansion of AFL. AFL was able to introduce new features in the game in the United States. The features added by the AFL are as follows −\n\nThe time was based on the scoreboard rather than the watch in the referee’s pocket\n\nTwo points were given to run after touchdowns or by pass\n\nThe names of the jerseys of the players were changed\n\nThe role of the minority players was also enhanced\n\nCollege players that were selected by the NFL were also selected by the AFL. AFL New York also signed Joe Namath which increased the competition of player selection between NFL and AFL. In order to end this competition, the NFL offered AFL for a merger which was done in 1970. This merger led to the arrangement of the World Cup each year in which the champions of both leagues will compete. This World Cup came to be known as the Super Bowl.\n\nAmerican Football - Terminology\n\nBefore knowing the game rules and playing guidelines, it’s very important to get familiarized with the terms used in the game.\n\nTee − a cone shaped platform which holds the ball\n\nYard Space − Space gained by the player to measure the progress of the game.\n\nLine of Scrimmage − The lines parallel to goal line and next to each team’s end, the two lines are termed as the offensive & defensive line of scrimmage.\n\nOffense − Team with the control of the ball.\n\nDefense − Team opposing the offense, without the possession of the ball.\n\nCenter − Player in the offense, with the control of the ball.\n\nTackle player − Position of the players on both offense and defense lines.\n\nTight end − Position of offensive team player also called as the Y receiver, placed next to the offensive tackle.\n\nWide Receiver − Position of offensive team player 7 yards away from the formation.\n\nQuarterback − Position of offensive player right behind the center.\n\nHalfback − Position of offensive player behind the wide receiver near to the goal line.\n\nFullback − Position of offensive player placed behind the quarterback in forming a T shape structure.\n\nEnd player − Position of defensive player placed on the defensive line of scrimmage exactly opposing the center.\n\nNose tackle − Position of the defensive player opposing the center, effective in stopping the running and rushing the pass.\n\nLinebacker − Position of defensive player placed right behind the end players.\n\nCornerback − Position of defensive player positioned behind the linebackers to disrupt the passing.\n\nSafeties − Position of defensive player behind the linebacker ready to take control of the ball from the offense.\n\nDead ball − The ball not anymore in the play\n\nKickoff − The ball is placed on a tee at the defense’s 35-yard line, and a special kicker also kicks the ball to the offense.\n\nPlacekick − It is a style of kicking the ball when put on the tee.\n\nDrop kick − When the ball is being dropped to the ground and is being kicked before it hits the ground again.\n\nFree kick − It is a kicking form to place the ball in the play.\n\nDown − Time period in which the individual plays in a certain duration, outside of which the ball is dead or not in play.\n\nFirst Down − When the offensive team effectively passes and moves the ball 10 or more yards, they earn a first down.\n\nRun − A player advancing the ball gaining the necessary yard space.\n\nPass − A player passes the control of the ball to other player of the same team.\n\nForward pass − A player passing the ball, might touch an object, a person, or the ground nearer to the other team’s end line or is unintentionally lost in a forward throwing motion.\n\nTackle − When the player holding the ball whose knee touches the ground the play comes to an end with tackle.\n\nTouchdown − It is a scoring system worth 6 points ideally when a player carries the ball and touches the opponent’s end zone.\n\nPoint after touchdown (PAT) − After the touchdown the team will try for an extra 1 or 2 points by kicking the ball through the goal post or throwing it to the end zone.\n\nField Goal − Worth of 3 points occurs if the ball is place kicked, drop kicked or free kicked in between the goal posts in the opponent’s end zone.\n\nSafety − Scoring system worth of 2 points occurs by making the player possessing the ball out of his own end zone and out of bounds, or driving the other team to fumble the ball to exit the end zone.

They also provide muscle support which is helpful for the players to play the game.\n\nBalls\n\nThe size and structure of the ball has changed. In the 1800s, round-shaped balls were used in the game but now the shape of the ball is similar to the pig's bladder. Leather is used to make the football and it can be held easily with the help of laces. A football can be purchased from an online store or sporting goods stores.\n\nBelts\n\nBelts are used to keep the pants tight. They are tied on the waist to hold the pants in perfect position. All players have to use the belts designed by the NFL These belts can be found in the sporting goods store.\n\nChin Straps\n\nChin Straps are considered as one of the important equipment as they are valuable for the safety of the chin. The piece was first used in 1976 which decreased different types of injuries in the game. It can be uncomfortable but it creates a protective layer for the safety of the chin.\n\nCleat Cleaner\n\nCleat cleaners are used to clean the mud from cleats so that injuries can be prevented due to increased traction. If the game is being played on a wet field, cleat cleaners are very helpful.\n\nCleats\n\nCleats are required to help the players to run at a fast pace. Ordinary footwear cannot help the players to run fast while holding the ball. Cleats also help in the protection of ankles. Cleats also have grooved soles which provide traction to the runner.\n\nCompression Apparel\n\nCompression apparel is tight-fitting clothes which help the players to run on the field for a long time.

They help the players to protect their hands and fingers from getting injured. Receivers and linemen are more prone to hand injury as they have to catch the ball which may come by force. Receivers have to catch the ball and hold it to prevent other team members from snatching it. Linemen use gloves to protect their hands from bruising.\n\nHand Warmers\n\nHand warmers are the equipment that can be used by the players to keep their hands warm. This equipment is helpful in these areas where the climate is very cold. Players cannot play with cold and wet hands as this can lead the ball to slip away from their hands while catching.\n\nHelmet\n\nHelmet is considered as one of the most important pieces of equipment to be used in the game. The equipment is used for the protection of the head from any type of injury. Helmets are designed in such a way that they protect the head from any type of falling or damage caused by flying balls. The head is also protected from the pushes and force from other players.\n\nHelmet Pump\n\nHelmets consist of pads which can get deflated with time. Helmet pumps are used to inflate these pads to provide more comfort to the head. A deflated helmet is easy to store.\n\nHelmet Radios\n\nModern helmets also consist of radios and at least one player in each team has to wear such a helmet. These helmet radios are specially designed to be used during college football.

These balls are a replacement for the regular ball when kickoffs and field goals have to be done. These balls are hard in nature in comparison to the regular ball. The structure of these balls helps in making an accurate kick.\n\nMouth Guard\n\nMouth Guard is another essential piece of equipment that is used for the protection of teeth and mouth. A tooth can be broken due to a punch or force from another player. As there is always an encounter and chaos on the field so there are chances that the jaw can be broken. A mouth guard is the best protector of the mouth, teeth, and jaw.\n\nNeck Collars or Neck Rolls\n\nNeck Collars and Neck Rolls are useful for defensive linemen and linebackers.

Players have to run continuously and they also have to hold the ball and prevent the members of other time to get the possession. Knees and elbows can easily get hurt during the chaos. In such a case, knee pads and elbow pads are needed for the protection of these organs.\n\nThrowback Jerseys\n\nThese are the jerseys that are put on during a special match. The designs and brands of these jerseys have changed with time. These jerseys are worn by players to honor and pay tribute to the senior players.\n\nTowels\n\nSome players like quarterbacks wear the towels so that hands and the ball can be dried easily.

If you are purchasing the equipment online, you have to verify whether the products that are being sold are new. Internal working conditions of the second-hand product would be checked if you are buying any.\n\nFitting\n\nYou have to check the fitting of the uniform, helmet, mouth guard, and other equipment. If the equipment is tight and uncomfortable, you will face difficulty during the game. Loose items may fall down and fitting them during the game can be a waste of time. It is better to choose the pieces that are perfectly fit.\n\nCondition\n\nThe condition of the equipment should be checked before purchase. It is better to purchase a new one but if you are going for a second-hand product, check whether it is worn out or not and also the internal conditions like helmet, mouth guards, etc. Damaged and worn-out knee pads are not good for the knees. Purchase the knee pads that have excellent shock absorbers.\n\nBy position\n\nDifferent equipment has different positions. In the case of shoulder pads, they should be cantilevered for linebackers as they are bigger in size. Linebackers have to deal with collisions from the front and these pads will keep their shoulders safe. Flat shoulder pads are suitable for quarterbacks and receivers.\n\nIn the case of gloves, linemen need full gloves which can be used to cover the hand while receivers need such gloves that can be helpful for them to move their hand freely.\n\nAmerican Football - Players and Positions\n\nAmerican Football is a popular game played between two teams each having 11 players. Each player has his own position and they have to play a special role in the game. All the members of a team have to perform their job all the time to prevent the opponent from reaching the goalpost or the end zone. Before knowing about how the game is played, you need to know the position of the players.\n\nThe game consists of 3 teams listed below −\n\nOffensive Team\n\nThe offensive team consists of 11 players whose job is to take the ball to the end zone of the opponent. The offensive team has to go for a touchdown or settle for a field goal.\n\nDefensive Team\n\nThe defensive team also consists of 11 players and their job is to tackle the offensive team and prevent their attack. They have to tackle the player of the offensive team who carries the ball. They can also catch the pass or knock it down.\n\nSpecial Team\n\nThe offensive and the defensive teams are not allowed for kickoffs and extra points tries. They also cannot go for field goals and punts. All these actions have to be performed by the special team\n\nPlayers and Positions in the offensive team\n\nThe positions of these players are discussed here in detail.\n\nQuarterback (QB)\n\nThe player at this position has to control the ball coming from the center. This player has the option to pass the ball to a running back, wide receiver, tight end, or a passing play. QB also has the option of taking the ball and running. He needs to have knowledge about the position of each player so that he can throw the ball to a player of his team.\n\nOffensive Lineman\n\nThere are five offensive linemen on the field in the offensive team. These linemen are −\n\nLeft Tackle\n\nLeft Guard\n\nCenter\n\nRight Guard\n\nRight Tackle\n\nThe center lineman is the most important as most of the time the ball is with the center. The Center has to snap the ball, hand, or toss it between his feet and pass it to the Quarterback or another player to start the game. Usually, the Center position is held by the captain of the team. He is responsible for communication with the team.\n\nAfter the ball is in the hands of the Center, none of the players in the offensive team are allowed to touch the ball till the time the center passes the ball or the ball falls down from the hands of the center of the offensive team. This event is known as fumble and in such a case, the offensive team players try their best to push the defensive team so that they could not get the ball. Offensive linemen have the job of blocking the defensive team to get the ball.\n\nRunning Back\n\nThe job of the Running Back player is to get the ball thrown by the quarterback and run. Running Backs need to be powerful and fast so that they can be able to pass the ball to the other players of their team. They have to look for the best place where they can run and make a sudden stop to change the move. Usually, an offensive team has one running back but sometimes there can be two. If there are five receivers in the offensive team, then there will be no Running Backs.\n\nFullback\n\nFullbacks are considered as a mixture of lineman and running back. Their position is between Quarterback and Lineman. Their job is to block the running backs and then carry the ball. In the modern American Football game, Fullbacks are not required.\n\nTight End\n\nThe position of Tight Ends is bigger than the Wide Receivers but smaller than the Offensive Linemen. Their job is to block the linemen by catching the pass. They have to run in a similar way as that of Offensive Linemen. They have to catch the ball and run.\n\nWide Receiver\n\nThe position of Wide Receivers lies at or near the line of scrimmage. They are responsible for carrying the ball and they also have to block running plays. They are also tasked with catching passes. They have the option to jump in the air to catch the ball and run. They have to run on the known routes so that it is easy for the Quarterbacks to pass the ball.\n\nWide Receivers also have to hide their intentions from the defensive team. Wide Receivers are also allowed to wear face shields to hide the places where they are seeing and throwing the ball.\n\nPlayers and Positions in Defensive Team\n\nThe positions of different players in the defensive team are discussed here.\n\nDefensive Linemen\n\nDefensive linemen have to start playing from the line of scrimmage. This is the line where the ball is kept before the game starts. A defensive team can have 3 to 4 Defensive Linemen who are allowed to keep one or both hands on the field. Defensive Linemen are positioned in the middle and are called defensive tackle. If the number of defensive tackles is only one, he is known as a nose tackle.\n\nThe Defensive Linemen are responsible for stopping the Running Back of the offensive team. They also have to pressurize the Quarterback to throw the ball as soon as possible. They also have to tackle the Quarterback and it is known as sack. Defensive Linemen also have to stop the receivers and block them from catching the pass. These players need to be more active in the game.\n\nLinebacker\n\nThere are four Linebackers in the defensive team if there are three defensive linemen. In case there are four linemen, the number of linebackers is three. Linebackers have to work faster in comparison to the Defensive Linemen. They have to focus on passes and also have to keep an eye on the tight ends and wide receivers. The middle linebacker has to keep an eye on the quarterback before the play.\n\nCornerback\n\nCornerbacks are also known as Defensive Backfield or Defensive Backs. They are positioned outside of the defense and have the responsibility of dealing with the receivers of the offensive team. Cornerbacks try to prevent the receivers from catching the ball. The prevention can be done by batting down the ball or coming in its way while the receiver is going to receive it.\n\nThere can be five cornerbacks in a team and the fifth one is known as nickel back. The fifth defensive back is necessary if the offensive team has more number of receivers. If there are six cornerbacks in a defensive team, the sixth one is known as a dime back.\n\nSafety\n\nThe last player of the defensive is known as Safety. Safety has the responsibility to play at the back of the defensive team. Safeties have to check that none of the players of the offensive team cross the defense. Safeties have to take care of the large area of the field.\n\nA defensive team has two safeties. One of them is called strong safety and the other one is free safety. The strong safety is positioned at a place where the tight ends of the offensive team are lined up. The strong safety has to reach the line scrimmage while the free safety has to be available at the back of the defense.\n\nPlayers and Positions in the special team\n\nThe members of the special team are discussed below.\n\nKicker\n\nThe kicker is responsible for kicking off the ball and also going for a field goal. He is also responsible for earning point after touchdown (PAT).\n\nPunter\n\nIf the offensive players have gone for a fourth touchdown, they may or may not go for the first down. This is so because if they are unable to succeed the first down, they have to give the ball to the defensive team at the place where they have stopped their offense.\n\nThe punter has to kick the ball in such a way that the offensive team can be kept away from the end zone. Punters can also give the ball to the kicker to go for a field goal.\n\nKick Returner\n\nA Kick Returner is a player who has to catch the ball kicked by the kicker and run to the end zone of the opposite team. These players have to run at a fast speed and they can also act as wide receivers or cornerbacks.\n\nPunt Returner\n\nThe punt returner has to catch the ball punted by the Punter. The player does not have to return the ball as the special team of the other team has to tackle him. The Punt Returner may return the ball. He can also run towards the end zone of the other team.\n\nLong Snapper\n\nLong Snapper is a special center whose job is to snap the ball to the punter or kicker. The ball has to be kept in between the legs and passed to the punter.\n\nAmerican Football - How to Play?\n\nGetting Ready\n\nAmerican Football starts with the toss of a coin, just 3 minutes before the game. The referee meets both team captains and calls for a toss. The winner of the toss has can choose from either receiving the kickoff or just kickoff to start the game. Apart from that the winning team chooses an end of the field and the loser of the toss other end of the field.\n\nPlayers and Positioning\n\nAmerican Football has two teams and each of them has 11 players. The players have their own positions which depend on whether they belong to offensive, defensive, or special teams −\n\nTo know more about players and positions refer to the link below −\n\nAmerican Football - Players and Positions\n\nQuick Glimpse of the Game\n\nThe offensive team with 11 players takes possession of the ovoid ball and tries to advance the ball by throwing and running to the opponent team’s goal post to score points. Both the teams try to gain points by crossing the goal line and getting into the end zone. The opponent team called the defense tries to stop the offensive team and takes the control over the ball. Out of both the teams, the team with the ball has to score more points or the team is forced to give up the possession of the ball. The offensive and defensive teams change roles (the offensive team goes on defense and the defensive team goes on offense). The same continues back and forth, until all four 15 minute quarters of the game have been played.\n\nThe game starts with the kickoff. The ovoid ball is placed on a tee (a cone shaped platform which holds the ball) at the defense’s 35-yard line, and a special kicker also known as a placekicker kicks the ball to the offense. Any player from offense team will try to catch the ball and advance to the defense. When a kickoff is caught in the offense's end zone, the kicker has two options to play. First option is to run the ball away from the end zone and second option is to kneel down in the end zone to gesture a touchback and to stop the play immediately. The ball is positioned on the 20-yard line and game is started again.\n\nThe offensive team tries to get as much space as it can to try and move closer to the defense’s end zone. Every time the offense gets hold of the ball and has four downs or chances to gain 10 yards. If the offensive team effectively passes and moves the ball 10 or more yards, they earn a first down and similarly other set of four downs. If the offense fails to gain 10 yards’ space, then they lose control of the ball. The defense tries to prevent the offense from scoring and gaining the 10 yards needed for first down. If the offense reaches fourth down, then they end up punting the ball (kicks it away). This makes the defense team to begin its game from further down the field.\n\nOne of the important game rules of American Football is the play from scrimmage. It is the movement of the game during which one team tries to advance the ball, get a first down, or a point, and the other team tries to stop them or take the ball away. These plays from scrimmage include–field goal attempts (from either a place kick or a drop kick), passing the ball, retaining the ball and running, punting the ball (dropping the ball from the hands and then before it reaches the ground, kicking the ball), or freekicks such as kick-offs and fair catch kicks. The game also consists of a series of downs, referred to as a time period in which the individual plays in a certain duration, outside of which the ball is dead or not in play.\n\nReplacement of players can be made only between the downs, which allows for a great deal of choice for the team to send in the best suitable player for that particular situation.\n\nMoving the Bal – The Run and The Pass\n\nUsually the game begins with the snap of the ball at the line of scrimmage. The quarterback of the offense calls out a play in code and the center player passes or snaps the ball under his legs. The quarterback than continues from there and takes a quick decision on either to throw the ball or run with it.\n\nThe offense can advance the ball in two ways. First one is The Run and this happens when the quarterback player passes the ball off to a running back player, who attempts to gain as many yards as possible by escaping the defensive players. The quarterback is also one of the runners and is permitted to run with the ball.\n\nAnother alternative to taking the ball is to Pass it. The quarterback player generally passes the ball to trick the defense. Any other player from the offensive team can also pass the ball as long as the pass is thrown from behind the line of scrimmage. A pass is complete after another offensive player catches the ball, typically the wide receiver or tight end player of the catch the ball. If the ball smashes the ground before any other player catches it, then it’s an incomplete pass.\n\nThe defense players stop the offense from progressing with the ball by getting the ball to the ground. A player is said to be Tackled when the players’ knees touch the ground. This results in end of the play. A play also finishes in case if the player runs out of boundaries.\n\nScoring System\n\nThe game is played on a point based scoring system. The main objective of the players is to score points and team with scoring highest number of points is declared winner of the game. According to the scoring structure points can be scored in four methods that is Touchdown, Extra point (PAT), Field goal, and Safety points.\n\nTo know more about Scoring system, refer to the link below −\n\nAmerican Football - Scoring System\n\nAmerican Football - Scoring System\n\nThe scoring system in American football is different in comparison to other games. The game is played between an offensive and a defensive team. Both teams have the aim of reaching the goal post or end zone of the opponent team to gain points. The winner of the game is the team that has earned more points. The single play in the game is called down and the offensive team has four of them.\n\nThe team has to use the four downs till ten yards. If they are able to reach ten yards, they will get four downs again to reach the further 10 yards. If the offensive team is unable to reach the 10 yards in four downs, the ball is transferred to the other team.\n\nTypes of American Football Scores\n\nA team can earn points in different ways to increase their score. The highest point that they can get is through touchdown. The other ways through which points can be scored can be found in the table below −\n\nTouchdown\n\nThis is the most important way to earn points as each team gets six points for each touchdown. When the ball crosses the goal line of the opponent team, the offensive team earns six points. Another way to earn points through a touchdown is when a player catches the ball while he is in the end zone of the opponent team.\n\nThe rules of gaining points through touchdowns differ in college and pro football. In the case of pro football, both feet of the receiver should be on the ground or in the in-bounds when he catches the ball. In the case of college football, only one foot is enough to be in the in-bounds to get points through a touchdown.\n\nField Goal\n\nThe points which a team gets through the field goal is three. A team can score points through the field goal if a kicker kicks the ball that crosses the uprights of the goalpost. The center has to pass the ball to the punter or quarterback. The punter or the quarterback has to put the ball on the ground so that the kicker can kick it to the goalpost. The defense has to block the ball to stop the field goal.\n\nField goals can be scored from anywhere on the field but teams usually prefer a distance of 40 yards. Kickers have to position themselves along the offensive line to go for the field goal. Players can also use dropkick to get the field goal. The kicker in this case has to put the ball on the ground and kick it to the goalpost. This trick is very rarely used.\n\nTwo-Points Conversion\n\nTwo-point conversion can be attempted after getting a touchdown. In modern games, a team uses this option when they need two points to win the game or go for a tie. The team who wants to attempt a two-point conversion has to reach the end zone. In such a case, the game has to be started from a two-yard line. Many teams go for this type of scoring but analytics reveal that Per attempt a team receives 1.002 points while the average of the extra points is 0.938.\n\nExtra Point\n\nThe extra point is a type of field goal in which the goal has to be kicked from a 15-yard line. On being successful, the team gets only one point. Until 2015, players were allowed to go for a field goal from a two-yard line for getting extra points. This helped the kickers to earn extra points easily but after the change of rule, it became a little difficult to earn extra points.\n\nSafety\n\nSafety is a way of scoring in which the defensive team has to tackle the offensive team. The defensive team receives 2 points. After earning the points, the defensive team gets the possession of the ball and also gets the chance of punting. As per the strategy, a team always tries for safeties to earn points when the game is about to end.\n\nAmerican Football Scoreboard\n\nNow we will know about the American Football Scoreboard.\n\nTeam Names\n\nThe scoreboard has the names of the two teams participating in the current game.

If the team goes for the kick option, it can go for a punt or field goal.\n\nThe game is played between two teams of 11 players each.\n\nOne of the teams is offensive and the other is defensive.\n\nThe offensive team comes with the objective of reaching the end zone of the other team while the defensive team has the objective of preventing the offensive team from reaching the end zone.\n\nPoints can be earned in different ways which can be found in the table below −\n\nAmerican Football - Variants\n\nAmerican Football is the descendant of Rugby Football and has many variants which are played with different rules.
