        "text": "Teams that often end up on the winning end of the score in team sports are those that work well together. Learning to cooperate with others towards a common goal in sports is what builds character, friendship and important life skills for players and coaches. The friendships built within a team can last a lifetime for some players, and the journey of a team throughout a season is often memorable.\n\nTeam Cooperation\n\nEntering into a new season in sports, you might only know a few of the players on your team. Some of the players may actually be people you are not that fond of off the playing field. But when your team decides at the beginning of the year that it wants to be the team in the winner's circle holding the league championship trophy at the end of the season, personal differences are often set aside for the common good of the team. Many coaches like to say that the name on the front of the jersey is more important than the name on the back. This is saying that no one player is greater than the team. Sports such as football and ice hockey are physical sports and often require heavy commitment and dedication to be successful. By the end of the season, players who have been battered and bruised by the grind of the regular season and the playoffs may feel a strong connection, much like brothers, to their teammates.\n\nExercising and Socializing\n\nIn the case of many of today's youth, team sports offer a way for kids and young adults to avoid many temptations, including drugs and criminal activity. It also allows for kids and adults alike a chance to get out and socialize with friends and avoid spending too much time at home watching television and playing video games. The team work involved in these sports allows for people to become part of something of value and teaches people how to help someone on their team when they are struggling and offer them words of encouragement when they are performing either poorly or admirably. Team work can also give players a greater respect for one another and can build friendships that last a lifetime.\n\nCompetition\n\nTeam work in sports offer a way for people to compete for something together. In ice hockey, for example, the captain of the team can make it his goal to motivate every member of his team to give everything they have during the season in order to win the league championship. Although it is important to know that winning is not everything in sports, healthy competition can be good for people. People can translate the hard work they've put into their sport by working harder to be a better student or employee and a better person overall. Working towards a goal can teach people the value of hard work, commitment and dedication and team sports are a great way to learn these values.\n\nBuilding Important Life Skills\n\nTeam work in sports can help give participants stronger communication skills and teach them to work better with others. Many projects at work and at school often require a group to work together to put together a strong presentation to be looked at by the employer or teacher. Every member of that team must be pulling in the same direction to complete the project successfully. Additional advantages to team work in sports include learning to deal with conflict and exposure to a variety of ideas within the team."
