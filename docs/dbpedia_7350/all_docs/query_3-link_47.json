        "text": "You are over-thinking it. As someone who has played plenty of basketball, the 'reasons' are:\n\nSportsmanship\n\nSaving energy\n\nConvenience\n\nTake a quick rest while there's a break in the action\n\nNo reason\n\nJust making sure you're ok and not injured\n\nNone of these are because the player is incapable of standing up on his own (unless actually injured). More often than not, it's just a convenience thing or to get a quick little rest if you're fatigued. Actually, if you're talking about a player for the Heat or Clippers, disregard everything I just said...they flop and milk it like soccer players :)\n\nUnless the player is injured, the player could physically get up on their own; if they couldn't, there is no way they would be in physical shape enough to play the game. Nearly every play in football, however, ends with someone laying down on the field. At the end of the play, the players still standing typically offer a hand to help the ones that are down, even if they are on the other team.\n\nThe reasons other players will lend a hand to help other players up are professionalism, courtesy, sportsmanship (for the players on the other team), and teamwork (for the players on his own team).\n\nWhen a player helps someone up that they have just tackled, it is acknowledgement that they are both professionals doing a job, and that there are no hard feelings. Most professional players understand that, although they play on different teams, they are all coworkers, in a sense, and that your opponent this year might be your teammate next year.\n\nThat having been said, sometimes, especially in basketball, there is something else going on. Again, as with football, if a basketball player truly cannot get up off the floor on their own, they are not well enough to continue to play the game. Unfortunately, you sometimes see an element of theatrics in basketball. The player is trying to show that they have been fouled, and so they act hurt. They'll wave for help to try to draw sympathy, and then they will slam dunk the next ball they get. Basketball doesn't seem to have the \"iron-man,\" \"shake-it-off,\" \"tough guy\" culture that football has.\n\nI agree with all the reasons @A-D listed, but would also include that this is a way to disguise time-wasting. Yes, this happens in soccer quite a bit. By waiting for a teammate to pick them up a player to gets some rest while precious time ticks off the clock. Officials will generally allow it unless it's glaringly blatant that they're milking the time. This is particularly useful if a team has a marginal lead at the end of a game. Of course this mainly applies to soccer because the clock never stops, but in other sports this could be a way to kill an opponent's momentum. By slowing the game down it can chip away at a team's energy and cause frustration."
