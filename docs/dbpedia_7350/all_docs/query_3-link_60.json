        "text": "Youth, or “Pop Warner,” football is a version of the American sport played by children and teenagers. It is designed to introduce young players to the sport, teach them fundamentals and promote physical activity and teamwork.\n\nBut it does so much more than that.\n\nYouth football typically caters to children between the ages of 5 to 14, although that can vary by organization or league. They are often divided into age groups, such as 6 under, 8U (Smurf), 10U (Peewee), 12U (Pony), and 14U (Midget).\n\nYouth football rules are often modified and simplified to make the game safer and more suitable for young players. For example, there may be rules to limit contact and promote safety, such as restrictions on tackling techniques. Youth football fields are often smaller than those used in high school, college or professional football.\n\nSafety is a top priority. Players are required to wear protective equipment, including helmets, shoulder pads and pads for the legs and hips.\n\nTeams are typically coached by volunteers, often parents or community members. Youth football places a strong emphasis on teaching fundamental skills such as passing, catching, running and blocking. Coaches aim to help players develop their skills and a love for the sport.\n\nTri-Community Panthers Smurf Head Coach Zeke Johnson said coaching is his calling.\n\n“Everybody has their passion and their calling, mine is something with them kids,” Johnson said.\n\nCentral Penn Crusaders President Christopher Watts Sr. said the key to his organization’s success is the coaches, volunteers and parents.\n\n“The parents, coaches and volunteers dedicate countless hours to our program. Not just during the season but all year long. Whether it’s fundraisers, making sure equipment is ready and proper paperwork is filled and documented. It is a year-round commitment, and without our coaches, volunteers and parents we would be nothing,” Watts said.\n\nYouth American football is organized through various leagues and organizations, both at the local and national levels. Pop Warner, American Youth Football (AYF), and USA Football are someof the national organizations that oversee youth football programs.\n\nThe Capital Football Association (CFA) is the largest youth football league in Pennsylvania, and consists of many feeder programs that make up the Mid-Penn Football Conference. The CFA has three conferences: The National Conference, Federal Conference and Liberty Conference.\n\nHere’s a look at the central Pennsylvania teams in each of the conferences:\n\nNational Conference Teams: Central Penn Crusaders, Harrisburg Cougars, Susquehanna Twp. Tribe, Carlisle Herd, Cumberland Valley, New Cumberland Colts, York Bears, Central Dauphin Rams, State College Lions, Mechanicsburg Wildcats\n\nFederal Conference Teams: East Pennsboro Panthers, Middletown Blue Raiders, Northern Polar Bears, Swatara Tigers, West Perry Mustangs, Chambersburg Trojans, Waynesboro Stallions, Steelton Raiders, Northern Lebanon Vikings, Lebanon Raiders, Lower Dauphin Falcons, Red Land Patriots\n\nLiberty Conference Teams: Boiling Springs Bubblers, Gettysburg Warriors, Trinity Shamrocks, Big Spring Bulldogs, Seven Sorrows Eagles, Susquenita Blackhawks, Hershey Trojans, Palmyra Cougars, Tri-Community Panthers, Greenwood Buffaloes\n\nIt’s worth noting that the rules, regulations, and organization of youth football can vary significantly by region and league. The primary goal is to provide a safe and enjoyable introduction to American football for young players, with a focus on skill development, teamwork and sportsmanship.\n\nBenefits of youth football\n\nYouth football promotes physical activity and helps children develop strength, endurance, agility, and coordination. It encourages an active lifestyle and helps combat childhood obesity. It’s a team sport and teaches young players how to collaborate, communicate and support their teammates — valuable skills that can be applied in many areas of their lives.\n\nSusquehanna Tribe Smurf Head Coach Raekwon Purdy believes football builds bonds like no other sport.\n\n“When you put those shoulder pads on and you put your helmet on and go out on the field, those are your brothers,” Purdy said.\n\n“Those are the guys that you’re willing to lay it all on the line for. Nothing builds bonds between young men like football, in my opinion.”\n\nThe game teaches kids the importance of showing up for practice, following rules and committing to a schedule. It instills discipline and responsibility, and helps children set and pursue goals, a fundamental life skill. Football fosters social interactions, allowing kids to make friends and build relationships with teammates, coaches and parents. That can be especially important for children’s social development.\n\nFootball can instill values such as sportsmanship, respect and integrity. It teaches kids how to handle success and failure with grace and dignity. Football involves strategy and decision-making, helping kids develop problem-solving skills as they assess situations on the field and make quick, informed decisions. It can teach children to manage their emotions, to bounce back from disappointments and to persevere.\n\nYouth football can create a sense of community and identity, connecting children with their local area and giving them a sense of belonging. For some, playing youth football can spark a lifelong passion for the sport, even for those who don’t pursue it professionally.\n\nYouth football coach and mentor Sonny Arp says his coaching style is all about developing character.\n\n“My coaching style is based on young men becoming someone in life, it’s not about the actual sport,” Arp said. “It’s about giving them tools for life and teaching them hard work.”\n\nThe cons of youth football\n\nYouth football, like any sport, carries certain risks that can have both short-term and long-term consequences for young athletes. Players are at risk of injuries, including concussions, sprains, strains, fractures and dislocations. The physical nature of the sport can lead to both acute injuries and overuse injuries.\n\nMikell Simpson, a former Division I football player for the University of Virginia, doesn’t believe kids under the age of 10 years old should play tackle football due the wear and tear on the body.\n\n“As a kid your body is still growing, and football is a violent sport. When you’re that young and not lifting weights or training your body properly to take on the type of punishment physically, you can get seriously injured playing this game” said Simpson.\n\nConcussions are a major concern in football at all levels, as they can have both immediate and long-term consequences on a player’s health. Repeated concussions can lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease. Proper concussion management is crucial in youth football. If not handled appropriately, concussions can lead to more severe injuries or long-term issues. Education and awareness are essential for coaches, parents, and players.\n\nFootball is often played in hot weather, and players can be at risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Dehydration is a concern, and proper hydration is crucial.\n\nYouth athletes may be more susceptible to overuse injuries because their bodies are still growing. Repeatedly stressing the same joints and muscles can lead to injuries that can have lasting effects. The physical demands of the sport can take a toll on a young player’s body.\n\nEfforts are being made to make youth football safer. Organizations like USA Football and Pop Warner have implemented rule changes and safety protocols to reduce injury risk. Parents, coaches and players should be aware of the dangers and take steps to minimize risks by emphasizing proper equipment, training, supervision and sportsmanship.\n\nConsidering the child’s age, size and physical development is crucial when deciding whether to allow participation in contact sports like football.\n\nParticipation in youth football can also be expensive, with costs for equipment, uniforms, league fees, and travel. This financial burden may limit access to the sport for some families."
