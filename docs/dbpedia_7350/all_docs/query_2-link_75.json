        "text": "When did football start?\n\nThat is a difficult question and the answer is highly debatable. American Football can trace its roots back to rugby and soccer, two games that have been around for centuries.\n\nAccording to the legend, in 1823 during a school football match, a student named William Webb Ellis is said to have first picked up the ball and run with it, and thus he created a new style of play, where picking the ball and running with it was preferred over kicking it. From here on, colleges and universities in the United States would adopt their own variety of football.\n\nHowever, the first official game of American Football was played in 1869 between Rutgers and Princeton, universities in the United States. The game was relatively simple at that time and the rules were also very different from the football we know today, resembling more a rugby game. It wasn’t until the late 1800s that the rules began to resemble the game we know today.\n\nThe teams were composed of 25 players on each side. There was no forward pass and players could not receive more than one kick per possession. Kicking the ball or batting it with one’s hands, knees, or heads was the only way to move the ball around the field. The maximum number of points possible for the game was ten. The game ended with a 6-4 for Rutgers and laid the foundation for what would become one of the most beloved sports in the world.\n\nWhen was NFL founded?\n\nThe American Professional Football Association, now known as the National Football League (NFL), was founded in 1920, in Ohio, just a few years after the first official game of American football.\n\nAt that time, it was mostly made up of teams from small midwestern cities and was not yet the major league we know today. But the Association played an important part in professionalizing the sport, using schedules and proper payment systems. With all the changes and the new rules, APFA brought football closer to the version we are familiar with today.\n\nIn 1922 the American Professional Football Association changed its name to National Football League (NFL), and multiple other teams joined in the following years.\n\nToday, NFL is the biggest football league in the United States, consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC)."
