        "text": "National Football League\n\nAmerican sports organization\n\nNational Football League (NFL), major American professional football organization, founded in 1920 in Canton, Ohio, as the American Professional Football Association. Its first president was Jim Thorpe, an outstanding American athlete who was also a player in the league. The NFL’s present name was adopted in 1922.\n\nHistory\n\nThe league began play in 1920 and comprised five teams from Ohio (Akron Pros, Canton Bulldogs, Cleveland Tigers, Columbus Panhandlers, and Dayton Triangles), four teams from Illinois (Chicago Tigers, Decatur Staleys, Racine Cardinals [the Cardinals were based in Chicago but took the name of a local street], and Rock Island Independents), two from Indiana (Hammond Pros and Muncie Flyers), two from New York (Buffalo All-Americans and Rochester Jeffersons), and the Detroit Heralds from Michigan. Of these original franchises, only two remain: the Cardinals left Chicago for St. Louis after the 1959 season and relocated to Arizona in 1988; the Decatur Staleys moved to Chicago in 1921 and a year later changed their name to the Bears.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nThe NFL survived many years of instability and competition from rival organizations to became the strongest American professional football league. The most serious challenge to its leading role came from the American Football League (AFL) in the 1960s. The NFL and AFL completed a merger in 1970, creating a 26-team circuit under the name of the older NFL. Since then the league has expanded four times, adding six new franchises.\n\nFor a more complete history of football and the NFL, see American football.\n\nThe league’s 32 teams are aligned as follows:\n\nNational Football Conference (NFC) American Football Conference (AFC)\n\nThe league season culminates with an annual 14-team playoff tournament leading to the Super Bowl championship game. Some NFL teams also play regular-season games outside of the United States; these games have been held in England, Mexico, and Germany.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.
