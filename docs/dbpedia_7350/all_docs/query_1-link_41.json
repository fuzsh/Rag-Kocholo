        "text": "Why Nottingham?\n\nUniversity of Nottingham American Football is considered one of the most comprehensive American football programmes in the UK. Boasting a large and experienced coaching staff, with some of the best facilities in the nation, the University of Nottingham is an ideal place to play American football while studying at one of the UK’s top universities – regardless of experience in the sport.\n\nThe Gold team were the 2022 BUCS Championship Runners-up and have made playoff appearances in each season since being promoted to the BUCS Premier League in 2017. As one of only two UK university American football programmes to support two competitive BUCS teams; the Gold team, in the Premier North Division; the Green team, in the Division 2 Midlands Conference, an integrated two-team structure allows individual students to go at a pace that suits them. Those newer to the sport are able to develop and compete along with players at their level, whilst more experienced athletes can test themselves at the highest level in the UK.\n\nThe programme is supported by the leading facilities, support staff and coaching team situated at the £40 million David Ross Sports Village, with students enjoying weekly strength and conditioning sessions, access to the state-of-the-art Sports Injury Clinic, as well as expert tuition through twice-weekly classroom sessions and practice three times a week on the field.\n\nJason Scott - Head Coach\n\nUniversity of Nottingham American Football is led by Head Coach Jason Scott, who joined the #GreenandGold in 2017. After a debut 2017 season at the helm that resulted in a Division 1 Championship and promotion to the BUCS Premier League, Scott has guided his teams to postseason play in each season since including an undefeated first season at the highest level of British university American football in 2018.\n\nScott boasts five years’ experience coaching collegiate American football in the United States; at the NCAA Division I level with Mississippi State University in the Southeastern Conference, as well as with Endicott College.\n\nIn 2020, Scott was named head coach for the Great Britain Lions men’s national team, and was admitted to the British American Football Coaches Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nScott also previously served for six years as head coach of Loughborough University’s American football programme, winning four conference championships and appearing in two national championship games."
