        "text": "Not every child who plays youth sports will go on to be a professional athlete; however, the majority of children who play sports will go on to achieve greater success than their non-sports peers. The reason is simple: sports teach children teamwork, an important life skill. Every career involves some form of teamwork, whether you’re part of a large corporation or working one-on-one with clients, and personal relationships also require a strong team mentality.\n\nA 2009 University of Kansas study showed that Kansas students in grades 9-12 who participated in sports actually scored higher on academic tests and had a higher graduation rate than students who didn't participate. Additionally, 57 percent of business leaders attributed their youth sports experiences to career success. Participating in sports is such a rewarding and important experience for kids of all ages and it can positively impact their entire lives.\n\nThe Benefits of Teamwork in Youth Sports\n\nThe essence of teamwork is a group of people working together to achieve a common goal. While the premise seems simple, it requires a lot of dedication and perseverance. Successful teams must overcome many obstacles and be willing to learn and grow together. Because of the complexity of being part of a team and participating in youth sports, children can experience quite a lot of personal growth while receive several benefits and life skills.\n\nCooperation\n\nSports teams are an amazing way for kids to experience diversity and learn to cooperate with others. Every member of a sports team must work together to achieve success (even when it comes to picking out new uniform designs ), so individual differences have to be put aside. The diverse mix of personalities and challenges that young athletes face will help your child become patient, persistent, and adaptable.\n\nSelf-esteem\n\nWhen children understand that their voices are valued, they gain confidence. Being heard provides a sense of worth and encourages further participation. Teams naturally help children feel important as teammates interact and support each other. Kids may also develop long-lasting friendships that foster a sense of community and give them a safe foundation when dealing with stress.\n\nLeadership Skills\n\nAlong with organization, self-discipline, and conflict resolution, a strong leader understands how to communicate and work within a team. Youth sports can help children develop strong leadership skills by teaching them how to voice their needs, such as talking about issues with a coach, and to listen to the needs of their teammates.\n\nHow Team Working Skills Help a Child Later in Life\n\nAccording to Fortune , 75 percent of executives said an applicant's background in sports positively influenced their hiring decisions. The reason for that is the strong team working skills that young athletes learn. When an applicant has participated in youth sports, hiring managers understand that he or she has dealt with pressure and competition and has solid experience working with a team for a particular outcome.\n\nChildren in sports learn the importance of following rules and procedures, how to take constructive feedback, how to offer support to others, and when to ask for help. They also learn what it means to balance their strengths and weaknesses against teammates. Sports are basically teamwork in action, a major plus for any career.\n\nBesides job opportunities, personal relationships from friendships to romantic partners benefit from team working skills. Any successful relationship requires communication, compromise, support, and a willingness to work together for a common goal. By teaching kids these skills through sports at an early age, they will have what’s needed for successful interactions later in life.\n\nYouth sports is far more than an after-school activity or a way to get your child out of the house for a few hours. It builds teamwork and provides children the skills they need to be successful adults. So let’s get out there and play!\n\nDid you know that every member of your team can work together to sell fan gear and raise money for your organization?
