        "text": "In this documentary there was a mental skill that stood out the most, in particular, group dynamics/ cohesion. Throughout the team’s football season coach Courtney helps the boys feel closer with their fellow teammates, thus, resulting in each individual to look out for one another. With that said, in the movie the team worked together to achieve a common goal which was to win a playoff game while also working on individual interpersonal relationships with other teammates. With that in mind, different elements of task and social cohesion are emphasized in this documentary.\n\nThis structural-stress gives all of them time to develop their time-management skills as well as many other advantages. The training is designed to produce well-conditioned young athletes that will be ready to out-perform the next team they face. This also leads towards the athletes living a healthy lifestyle and develop problem-solving skills. (Runya, Robin) One good habit can lead to many good habits to form. Some more advantages would be a rise in self-esteem, higher social competence, and students striving for higher levels of academic achievement. (Robin) Collegiate sports also can reduce the rate of arrests, unplanned pregnancies, and lowers the dropout rate. (Robin) In addition to these social and emotional benefits, sports can also bring about intangible benefits to the school and community as a whole. “Sports also create important opportunities for students to contribute to the school community, which may cultivate an increased commitment to, or identification with, school and school values.” (Taliaferro 397) The teamwork skills these men learn from playing football with affect them every day of their lives. They learn to trust each other on the field, as well as develop skills that can and will help them in their future careers. This leads to a greater social benefit we experience as they enter the\n\nBy participating in football people can learn sportsmanship, hard work, discipline, and teamwork. Considering the many lessons it teaches, teamwork and discipline play the main role. With teamwork, players/children are learning how to trust their teammates the more experience they have with each other. As for discipline, it teaches kids to work hard and set good goals which can be helpful for them in the future as opposed to not playing, and being a step behind. NFL expert Jobe Lewis says that “football requires a pretty unique brand of teamwork and requires the player to discipline himself and to work hard” (Lewis 1).\n\nDespite such an increased concern for this topic many people are aware of the possible implications of placing their children in football or playing the game themselves yet they still continue to do so. Many players are told from a young age to simply be tough and suck it up, “[…] youth profess that the game and the team are more important than their individual health and they may play through a concussion to avoid letting down their teammates, coaches, schools and parents” (Breslow,\n\nFor decades, American Football has captivated this nation as one of the prime sources of entertainment. With the culmination point, the Super Bowl, attracting more viewership than any other televised event in the country, the sport has seen a tremendous growth since its origination in 1920. In an era of economic struggle, job shortage, and high-cost of living, those with above average physical abilities can find the lure of professional football to be extremely attractive. With the wealth and fame attached to a professional career, many of our youths share the common dream of achieving football star status. In order to attempt this lofty goal, many kids enroll in this contact sport at an early age, often times with the support of their parents.\n\nDespite the fanfare that comes with the game of football, I consider myself to be very lucky to have been exposed to the game at such a young age. Football is all about teamwork, where as some sports are more individual based. It is not like baseball where a player can hit a homerun and save your chances. In order for a football team to work, not only do all 11 players on the field have to work together, but the team must prepare to be successful well before the ball is first snapped. You always hear how football teaches young men to have a work ethic or to be better teammates, and while this true, for me football was about becoming a better person.\n\nJeff Scurran is the head football coach at Carolina Foothills High School in Tucson, Arizona and he wrote an article on why football is a necessity that society can’t get rid of. “We are teaching kids traits desired by many professions, including the military. I took my team on a trip to West Point a few years ago. I wasn’t surprised to find out that every freshman cadet was required to play on an intramural football team. Because in football, we are teaching kids hustle, determination, teamwork, effort, discipline, intelligence, and that hard work pays off.” High school football is one of the only sports that teaches so many traits that are proven to improve your academics, and could eventually assist you in life in general. “Look at the ones who stay, learn, put in the work to develop their technique- and put in the classroom to remain academically eligible. Other sports promote this but the combination of teamwork and toughness in football is second to none,” Scurran says in his article, “These are essential qualities to being successful in life; the intangibles are\n\nSports are a significant part of society and spectators enjoy particular events regardless of the type. However, there are many players who develop special working and social relationships with whom they are participating regardless of the type of sport. The relationship and how people interact with one another can be the determination of how successful a team can be. The particular film based on a true story that I chose is titled When the Game Stands Tall. This film consists of a high performing football team of De La Salle High School in the state of California. Jim Caviezel portrays the head coach (Bob Ladouceur) as a man with such vision and passion that goes beyond the fundamental principles of coaching the game of football. The football team had won 151 games without being defeated which is the highest winning record a team has had in the game of football. The film shows the internal struggles of the players in their lives as people, and how they perform on the field. It also shows the external tragic difficulties that they face while they attend and play for De Le Salle High School. In the movie, the head coach helps the students/players by not only coaching them but also showing them how to live a flourishing life by committing to endure difficult life situations and the way to overcome them. He helps teach the principles of brotherhood and companionship with the team that they build. In the movie, the head coach and the staff had taught the players\n\nTo begin looking at a football team it would first be beneficial to examine the normative behaviors associated with the adolescent period in a child’s life. The adolescent period of one’s life is often marked by moodiness, being short-tempered, and easily angered (citation). The above characteristics are often due to the hormonal and physical changes that accompany this time period. Not only are there changes occurring to the individual, changes are also occurring within peer\n\nIn addition to teamwork, football also teaches discipline. Discipline is the result of commitment, a love for the task, and passion for the game. These characteristics are usually enforced by infusing commitment, passion, and love for the task while growing up at a young age. Discipline in football controls your goals and accomplishments, which starts on the football field. When team players are disciplined it means that they know what they want (to win games) and they do it the best they know how by perfecting the basic skills, such as, tackling, running and blocking. Some examples of discipline are showing up to practice on time and knowing what job is expected of you on the football team. If you do not know, it can cause your team to lose games. Exercising throughout the year is another example because the player’s body has to be in shape year round.\n\nFootball remains the most popular sport in America and the ninth most popular sport in the world for a reason. Since its creation in 1869, football has played a fundamental part of American society. Every Sunday, my family along with millions of other Americans turn the television to CBS, NBC or FOX to watch their favorite football team go to battle. My family and I bleed burgundy and gold and root for the home team the Washington Redskins. Americans including myself display great intensity and passion for the game of football and the result of the game often changes my attitude for the better or worse. Watching the game on television may come as exhilarating and entertaining, but playing the game creates the best times. Overall football has made a severe impact on many people’s lives. Football teaches unique lessons in a hands on manner which helps athletes like myself sustain a much more adventurous life. Football has made an immeasurably positive influence upon my life, but the sport has its dangers. Football changes lives.\n\nFor a lot of kids, it’s not until it’s all said and done, and they look back on it several years later, that they realize the difference the sport made in their lives. They are proud of playing the game. Have you ever met anybody who accomplished playing four years of high school football, and at the end of that run said, ‘Man, I wish I wouldn’t have played’? It doesn’t get said. Football players aren’t perfect. Nobody is. But millions of former players, one by one, can recount the life-altering principles they learned from football. They know the value of football is the values in football.That’s why high school football – and particularly high school coaches – play such a vital role in our society. Our football coaches are on the front lines of the battle for the hearts and minds of the boys in our society.\n\nFootball is considered one of the most highly played sports and by some the most popular sport in America. Football is an intense game of great strength and triumph and most can agree that it is a great way for their children to make friends, build character, and for a select few make a career out of it. It can be agreed that these are all true and that football is a highly engaging event to watch. This is not an essay to say that football is an outrageously dangerous sport that should be banned at all levels of playing. Although, it is an outrageously dangerous sport, there needs to be a new way to coach these football players so they can play in a way that does not endanger one’s life. However, with any sport comes the risks of possible injury."
