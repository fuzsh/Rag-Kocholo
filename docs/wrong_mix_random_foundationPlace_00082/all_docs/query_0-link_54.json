        "text": "Asbestos exposure can also occur outside of jobsites. Older homes and schools may have been built with materials like asbestos tiles and roofing. Do-it-yourself homeowners should hire an asbestos inspector if their home was built before the 1980s.\n\nExposure can also occur when a worker accidentally brings asbestos home on their clothes or hair. This is called secondary asbestos exposure and can lead to mesothelioma.\n\nAutomobile Factories\n\nDetroit was the epicenter of the U.S. automotive industry. Henry Ford started the Ford Motor Company in that city in 1903. Automobile plants were asbestos-heavy locations and represent many asbestos exposure sites in Michigan. Workers may have experienced exposure from products like brake pads, gaskets and insulation.\n\nIn addition to Ford, other Michigan car manufacturers exposed their employees to asbestos. General Motors, Chrysler Motors and Plymouth Motor Car also had factories that used asbestos in the state.\n\nSteel Mills\n\nMichigan built a number of steel mills, foundries and metalworking shops to support the car manufacturing industry. To offset the high heat involved in melting, molding and tempering steel, companies often used asbestos in protective gear and machines and in products used to manipulate metal.\n\nCompanies like American Car and Foundry Company, Michigan Steel Foundry and National Steel all had locations in Michigan.\n\nPower Plants\n\nLike many other states, Michiganâ€™s power-generating facilities have exposed workers to asbestos. Power plant companies often used asbestos equipment for its heat resistance and durability. Jobsites like the Big Rock Point Nuclear Power Plant and Bridgeman Nuclear Plant are known to have used asbestos.\n\nOil Refineries\n\nMichigan has a number of oil refineries and distribution hubs that used asbestos. Because fuel can be volatile, they often used asbestos to prevent or contain fires. Some known oil companies that have exposed their workers in Michigan include Citrin Oil Company and Marathon Oil Company.\n\n03. Shipyards & Superfund Sites\n\nAsbestos Shipyards and Superfund Sites in Michigan\n\nBordering four of five Great Lakes, Michigan has the most coastline of any inland state. This access to deep inland waters provides plenty of space for shipbuilding activities within the state and its immediate neighbors. With harbors, dry docks and shipyards, shipping and shipbuilding are major industrial concerns.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also designated many Superfund sites requiring intervention. These sites have toxic waste, asbestos and other contaminants. Old factories are common Superfund sites.\n\nDefoe Shipyard\n\nThe Defoe Shipbuilding Company was founded in Bay City, Michigan, in 1905, as a manufacturer of wooden fishing boats. As the company grew, it began creating boats with gasoline engines, including two cruisers that the company sold to the U.S. Navy for use during World War I.\n\nBy the time World War II came about, Defoe was much larger and built more than 150 naval ships to participate in the war. In the post-war years, the company continued to build ships for the Navy. It also built commercial bulk freighters that operated on the Great Lakes shipping routes. During this entire period, asbestos was a standard material for nearly all shipbuilders.\n\nIn 1976, the company was forced to close after its contracts with the Navy began to run out.\n\nJesiek Brothers Shipyard\n\nThe Jesiek brothers started their shipbuilding business in 1901 on the Grand River in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Throughout the early 1900s, the company built boats anywhere from 24 to 75 feet in length. In the lead-up to World War II, it built submarine chasers that helped patrol the Atlantic coast of the United States. The company also built tugboats for naval shipyards.\n\nAfter the war, the company continued to produce many types of commercial and recreational boats, including ferries, yachts and other ships. The Jesiek Brothers Shipyard soon became the largest shipyard on Lake Michigan for servicing and docking.\n\nEventually, the company was sold and became Eldean Shipyard. Throughout its heyday, however, Jesiek Brothers Shipyard used asbestos in its boats, exposing shipbuilders and craftsmen to this dangerous carcinogen.\n\nMcLouth Steel Corporation\n\nFrom 1948 to 1996, McLouth Steel operated on 273 acres along the Detroit River in Trenton until it filed for bankruptcy. Once the ninth largest steel factory in the nation, it employed nearly 5,000 workers at its peak and was a major producer of steel for automobiles in Detroit.\n\nThe EPA added the property to the National Priorities List in 2019. Working with the Department of Justice and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, the EPA embarked on a $20 million cleanup on the southern 197 acres. They completed the initial cleanup in 2021.\n\nThe cleanup process included asbestos removal and the removal of thousands of containers of hazardous waste. Among the waste were asbestos-containing materials and other carcinogenic substances like polychlorinated biphenyls.\n\n04.
