The Mergermarket highlights reported: ☑ Global M&A volume grew 17% YoY to USD 1.6trn in the first half of 2024, driven by a resurgence in activity in North America after hawkish monetary policy worldwide appeared to tame inflation and returned some stability to markets. ☑ Corporate buyers have reclaimed the spotlight, accounting for 73% of the deal volume—a return to pre-pandemic levels. ☑ Private equity buyouts surged in 1H 2024 and expectations appear rosy for the second half, as anticipated rate cuts make leveraged borrowings cheaper. ☑ Meanwhile, exit values which increased in 1Q 2024, were more subdued in 2Q 2024, as stubborn inflation and political uncertainty put exits on hold. 📄You can explore Mergermarket rankings in greater detail here: https://lnkd.in/dTeHaJvz . . . . #mergers #CEE #legaladvisory #mergeracquisitions #deals\n\nCOBALT Dispute Market Report: 2023 H2 - 2024 H1 ⚖ Last year, COBALT Estonia began issuing a disputes market report to highlight key trends and important cases relevant to medium and large companies.
