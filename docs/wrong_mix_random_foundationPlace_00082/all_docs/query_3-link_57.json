        "text": "Our history is inspiration for the future.\n\nFounded by Dan Gilbert in 1985, Rocket Mortgage, known then as Rock Financial, was a brick-and-mortar mortgage company.\n\nOur first big break came in 1996 when we created Mortgage In A Box. The concept was simple: Fill out a mortgage application in the comfort of your home, at your leisure, and send it back when you’re ready.\n\nTwo months after Mortgage In A Box was released, we closed $35 million worth of loans.\n\nIn 1999, we made several more significant moves. That’s when we launched RockLoans.com, a branch-based lender site, changed our name to Quicken Loans, and partnered with Title Source, a title company we still work with today.\n\nIn 2010, we decided it was time for a change of scenery. We moved from Livonia, Michigan, to downtown Detroit. This sparked a revitalization of not just the company, but an entire city.\n\nBy the end of 2011, we achieved $30 billion in closed loan volume. The following year, we outdid ourselves again by hitting another game-changing record of $70 billion in closed loan volume.\n\nBy 2014, we were the largest provider of FHA mortgages – a distinction we still hold today.\n\nOur innovation hasn’t stopped.\n\nAt Rocket Companies, we like to say, “Innovation is rewarded. Execution is worshipped.”\n\nNothing better illustrates this philosophy than Rocket Mortgage – the world’s first completely online mortgage process – which we launched in 2015. We’re proud to say that today, 98% of all the home loans we originate use the Rocket Mortgage technology.\n\nIn 2017, we became the nation’s largest residential mortgage lender, surpassing close to 30,000 lending institutions.\n\nWithout our team members, we wouldn’t have been able to accomplish all of our amazing milestones, like closing $351 billion in mortgage volume in 2021."
