        "text": "GuardKnox, an Israel-based cybertech supplier to OEMs, Tier-1 suppliers, and the automotive aftermarket, will open a new subsidiary, GuardKnox USA, in Livonia. Joe Romeo, who held senior roles at Ford Motor Co. and Bosch, has been appointed managing director of the U.S. location.\n\nGuardKnox’s computing solutions offer added connectivity, infotainment services, applications, amenities, and vehicle customization while protecting vehicles against unauthorized access or manipulation. The company offers hardware and software.\n\nThe Livonia location will enable GuardKnox to better serve its existing U.S. customers, build partnerships, and initiate business in the U.S. It is onboarding new business development leaders, project managers, and engineers. GuardKnox also has a location in Germany.\n\n“We are thrilled to have a veteran automotive professional like Joe join the team and help us establish a larger footprint not only in America’s largest automotive hub, but the world’s center of vehicle innovation,” says Moshe Shlisel, co-founder and CEO. “This expansion opens the door for us to further build out our presence in the U.S. and enables our company to continue to grow and develop relationships within the automotive sector.”\n\nRomeo has an MBA from the University of Michigan and a master’s degree in engineering from Cornell University. He has more than 20 years of experience in engineering and business at Ford and Bosch.\n\n“I look forward to working with the GuardKnox team and leading the expansion into this pivotal automotive market,” says Romeo. “Today’s drivers are demanding a new in-vehicle experience that is easily customizable but also secure, and GuardKnox has the technology and solutions to make this vision a reality. I am excited to introduce these cutting-edge products to both current and future business partners in the U.S.”"
