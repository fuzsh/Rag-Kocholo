(NASDAQ: MULN) (“Mullen” or the “Company”), an emerging electric vehicle (“EV”) manufacturer, today announces its subsidiary, Bollinger Motors, has named the next two dealership groups, spanning seven states and 11 locations, as Bollinger rolls out its commercial electric truck line, beginning with the Bollinger B4 Chassis Cab in the second half of 2024.\n\nThe dealership groups are:\n\nNacarato Truck Centers – 10 locations in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Tennessee and Virginia.\n\nNuss Truck and Equipment – one location in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nThe Bollinger B4 Chassis Cab is an all-new, all-electric Class 4 commercial truck designed from the ground up with extensive fleet and upfitter input. Bollinger’s unique chassis design protects the 158-kilowatt-hour battery pack and components to offer unparalleled capability and safety in the commercial market. The company anticipates deliveries of the Bollinger B4 to begin in the second half of 2024.\n\n“We are building our national dealer network very strategically to ensure that they share Bollinger’s commitment to quality and customer service,” said Robert Bollinger, founder and CEO of Bollinger Motors. “These two dealership groups represent some of the busiest trucking hubs in the country and we welcome these new locations to the Bollinger family as we work to electrify fleets across the country.”\n\nToday’s announcement follows a series of Bollinger Motors announcements in recent months, including partnerships with Our Next Energy in Novi, Michigan, to supply the company with batteries and related components and Roush Industries in Livonia, Michigan, to manage vehicle assembly operations. The company recently qualified for federal clean vehicle tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of $40,000 per vehicle for the B4 chassis cab. Earlier this month, Michigan’s LaFontaine Automotive Group was named as the first commercial dealer.\n\nAbout Bollinger Motors\n\nFounded in 2015 by Robert Bollinger, Bollinger Motors, Inc. is a U.S.-based company headquartered in Oak Park, Michigan. Bollinger Motors is developing all-electric commercial chassis cab trucks, Classes 4-6. In September of 2022, Bollinger Motors became a majority owned company of Mullen Automotive, Inc.
