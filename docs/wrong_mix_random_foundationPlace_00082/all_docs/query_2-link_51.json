After one bad experience in renovating one we have decided to avoid them in the future for the following reasons:\n\n- Difficult to access plumbing and HVAC\n\n- Difficult to wire electrical\n\n- Prone to foundation issues\n\n(Many in our area unfortunately have sustained foundation damage from an unusual earthquake we had here in VA about 5 years ago.)\n\nBigger Pockets investors - What is your opinion / experiences with renovating and property managing slab houses? Good, bad, avoid like the plague?"
