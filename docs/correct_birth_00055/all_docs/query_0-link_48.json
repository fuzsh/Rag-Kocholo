        "text": "People of Chennai are warm and hospitable. Find out the lifestyle, culture, behaviour and traits of the Chennaiites.\n\nChennai Travel Guide : Chennai People\n\nChennai People\n\nA melting pot of many cultures, Chennai is a well known city in India but this fast paced metropolitan city, apart from anything else, is best known for its people. The warmth and hospitality of the Chennaiites is known to the one who visits this culturally rich place. Reason, you ask? The city being the centre of major activities is a place where different sects of people come to work and settle here. And within some time these temporary outsiders too, learn the new culture as if they are fascinated by it to the very core. Who wouldn't be? The inhabitants treat them as their own and slowly they learn the true feelings of being a Chennaiite. Chennaiites are devoted to their culture and traditions and are very particular in following the age old rituals, daily.\n\nUsually the day of a Tamil household begins with early rising and performing religious rites. The doorsteps are decorated with kolam, on a daily basis. Kolam are patterns made from rice power or white stone powder, which has both decorative as well as religious significance. People are very religious and visit the temples daily, but a major chunk of the population pays a visit on Friday. The religious festivals and ceremonies too, are celebrated with great pomp and show. The caring people of Chennai also cater to the needs of the poor and needy also come to help, immediately, anyone who needs it. But most of all, they believe in building harmonious relation with everyone and leave absolutely no scope for isolation.\n\nPeople of different cultures living peacefully in the city with the local inhabitants will agree that they are one of the humblest bunches of people in the country. People of different regions and religions like Sindhis, Gujaratis, Malayalees, Muslims, Christians and Kannadigas who live in perfect harmony with each other present a classic example of unity in diversity. A place where one can experience the true spirit of the country; Chennai is a place worth living. For those who are visiting Chennai for the first time it may seem that the city is conservative and the people are proud of their culture and follow traditional norms but the different contradictions shows that the city should be overlooked beyond Tamil culture.\n\nSome famous Personalities born in Chennai:\n\nIndra Krishnamurthy Nooyi - Businesswoman from United States of Hindu religion/ CEO of PepsiCo.\n\nVijay Amritraj - Indian tennis player, sports commentator and actor\n\nKaavya Viswanathan - Novelist\n\nTrisha Krishnan - Indian film actress and model\n\nA. R. Rahman - Indian film composer, record producer, musician and singer / Oscar & Grammy Awards winner\n\nR. K. Narayan - Indian author\n\nJohn Henry Constantine Whitehead - British Mathematician\n\nAshok Amritraj - Indian American film producer\n\nMahesh Bhupathi - Indian professional tennis player"
