        "text": "CHENNAI: A cheerful and confident looking Indian team seem ‘ready’ to take on Brazil in the World Group Play off tie that begins at the SDAT - Nungambakkam stadium here on Friday.\n\nWith Mahesh Bhupathi joining the team on Wednesday the mood looks to be upbeat and the mantra seems to be capitalising on the ‘Chennai’ and ‘crowd support’ factor.\n\nLeander Paes on Tuesday suggested that the Indian camp with the tall deeds of Rohan Bopanna in the US Open was a strong contender for a doubles slot. SP Misra, the captain of the team quelled any speculation by stating firmly that Paes and Bhupathi will be the doubles combination.\n\n“Of course, Leander and Mahesh will play the doubles, but we have the option to change one hour before the commencement of the match. But then, Rohan Bopanna will have to play two singles matches also,” said Misra tongue-in-cheek at a pre-draw press conference. Although Bhupathi did not spend much time on the court with his mates but he sounded confident. “I was born here (Chennai). Happy to be here. The crowd support and the environment will help me give my best,” said Bhupathi.\n\nIndia is ranked No 14 in the Davis Cup rankings and Brazil is no where in the top 20, but its key players Thomaz Bellucci, Bruno Soares are higher ranked than the Indians.\n\nBopanna, Paes and Somdev too echoed the same sentiments and believed that the “Chennai” factor will see them through. The draw for the tie will be held on Thursday by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi."
