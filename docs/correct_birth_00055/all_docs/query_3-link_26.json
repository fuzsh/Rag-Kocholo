        "text": "Indian actress (born 1978)\n\nLara Dutta Bhupathi (born 16 April 1978) is an Indian actress and beauty pageant titleholder who won Miss Universe 2000, and primarily works in Hindi films. Dutta is a recipient of a Filmfare Award and established herself as a prominent leading lady in the 2000s.\n\nDutta made her acting debut with Andaaz (2003), which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut.[1] She went on to star in several commercially successful films, including the comedies Masti (2004), No Entry (2005), Bhagam Bhag (2006), Partner (2007), Housefull (2010), and Chalo Dilli (2011), and the action film Don 2 (2011).\n\nFollowing a hiatus, Dutta appeared in the British drama miniseries Beecham House in 2019 and portrayed Indira Gandhi in the film Bell Bottom (2021).[2] She has since taken on roles in streaming series such as Hundred (2020), Kaun Banegi Shikharwati (2022) and Charlie Chopra & The Mystery Of Solang Valley (2023).\n\nIn addition to her acting career, Dutta has hosted several award shows and has her own line of beauty care products. She is married to tennis player Mahesh Bhupathi, with whom she has a daughter.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nDutta was born 16 April 1978[3] to a Hindu Punjabi father and an Anglo-Indian mother in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.[4][5] Her father is Wing Commander L. K. Dutta (retired) and her mother is Jennifer Maureen Dutta (née Storey).[6][7] Nitin Sawhney, who is a music composer and DJ is Dutta's cousin.[8]\n\nDutta moved to Bangalore in 1981 where she completed high school at the St. Francis Xavier Girls' High School and Frank Anthony Public School. She graduated with a degree in economics and a minor in communications from the University of Mumbai.[9] She is fluent in English and Hindi and can also speak Punjabi and Kannada.[9]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nDutta had a nine-year relationship with actor and model Kelly Dorji.[10] In 2008, she briefly dated Dino Morea, but they broke up in 2009.[11] She then briefly dated American professional baseball player Derek Jeter.[12][13]\n\nIn September 2010, became engaged to Indian tennis player, Mahesh Bhupathi.[14][15] They married on 16 February 2011 in a civil ceremony in Mumbai [16] and followed it with a Christian ceremony on 20 February 2011 at Sunset Point in Goa.[17] On 1 August 2011, Dutta confirmed that she was pregnant with their first child.[18][19]\n\nPageantry\n\n[edit]\n\nDutta won the annual Gladrags Manhunt and Megamodel Contest in 1995,[20] thus winning the right to enter the 1997 Miss Intercontinental Pageant. She was later crowned Miss Intercontinental 1997.[21]\n\nIn 2000, she entered and won the Femina Miss India contest receiving the title of Femina Miss India Universe. In the final, the top five delegates were asked the same question – \"If you were a police officer in the Garden of Eden, who would you punish for the original sin: Adam, Eve, or the serpent?” Dutta said:\n\nIf I was a policeman in the garden of Eden, I would take all three of them to court. Every person in life is faced with temptation, but you must be able to decide for yourself, make your own choices, and live by your own rules. Above all, fear God, because he is everywhere.[22]\n\nIn this round, some contestants had tied.[23] All the delegates were subsequently asked a tiebreaker question: \"If ignorance is bliss, why do we seek knowledge?”, Dutta said:\n\nKnowledge is something every man is endowed with and it is up to him to make use of it. Thirst for knowledge drives every man. They say every man dies but very few men really lived. And what is life without knowledge. Would you go through life without passing something on to your children?[23]\n\nThis allowed her to represent India at the Miss Universe 2000.[24]\n\nMiss Universe 2000\n\n[edit]\n\nDutta won Miss Universe 2000 in Cyprus.[25]\n\nDuring the final question and answer round, the top three contestants were each asked by the host, Sinbad: \"Right now, there is a protest that has been staged outside the stadium posing pageants as an affront to women. Convince them that they are wrong\". Dutta answered:\n\nPageants like Miss Universe gives us young women a platform to foray into the fields that we want to and forge ahead, be it entrepreneurship, be it the armed forces, be it politics. It gives us a platform to voice our choices and opinions, and makes us strong and independent that we are today.[26]\n\nDutta was crowned by the outgoing titleholder Mpule Kwelagobe of Botswana. Her win led to her appointment as a UNFPA Goodwill Ambassador in 2001.[27] In the same year, Priyanka Chopra and Dia Mirza won their respective Miss World and Miss Asia Pacific titles which gave India a rare triple victory in the world of beauty pageants.[28] During her reign as Miss Universe, she visited 42 countries.[25][29][30]\n\nShe is the second woman from India to be crowned Miss Universe. She received the highest score in the swimsuit competition and her finale interview score is the highest individual score in any category in the history of the Miss Universe contest.[31]\n\nDutta has been a United Nations Population Fund Goodwill Ambassador since 2001. Dutta has stated, \"Celebrities with the power to affect their impressionable minds therefore have a moral responsibility to impart positive messages. I am committed to using any influence I may have to do just that as a Goodwill Ambassador of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)\".[32]\n\nActing career\n\n[edit]\n\nDebut and early work (2001–2004)\n\n[edit]\n\nDutta appeared in the Tamil film, Arasatchi in 2002, but due to financial problems, it was only released in mid-2004.

She always knew what were her priorities.\"[71] Rajiv Vijayakar of Bollywood Hungama finds her to be \"versatile\".[72][73]\n\nDutta has been a vocal supporter of the Me Too movement in India. Dutta stated that \"I think it is about time. It is fantastic as I feel the difference today is that women are standing up for women. I think that comes from a generation shift. The older generation was largely taught that women should be quiet and don't speak up; that they don't come to the forefront because they should be homemakers. Women today still do all of that. We always manage the home, take care of family, we are still the troubleshooters, we wear multiple hats in a day, we juggle a million works, and we don't let any of them drop. But now this generation of women have become more vocal, and they are empowering each other, which is a much better situation. I cannot stress enough about how essential it is to have a sisterhood, to support other women that are speaking up. Be unafraid and be unapologetic about the stand that you take, especially against male entitlement.\"[74]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nKey † Denotes films that have not yet been released\n\nAll films are in Hindi unless otherwise noted.\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Film Role Notes Ref. 2003 Andaaz Kajal [75] Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost Kesar 2004 Khakee Herself Special appearance in the song \"Aisa Jado\" Masti Monica Singh Bardaasht Advocate Payal Arasatchi Lara Tamil film [76] Aan: Men at Work Kiran Kumar 2005 Insan Meghna Malhotra [77] Elaan Sonia Singh Jurm Sanjana Malhotra Kaal Ishika Malhotra No Entry Kaajal Singhania [78] Dosti: Friends Forever Kajal Sharma [79] 2006 Zinda Jenny Singh Alag Herself Cameo appearance in the song \"Sabse Alag\" Bhagam Bhag Aditi Desai / Nisha Chauhan / Munni / Sheetal[a] [80] Fanaa Zeenat Special appearance 2007 Jhoom Barabar Jhoom Anaida Raza / Laila[a] Partner Naina Sahani Om Shanti Om Herself Special appearance in song \"Deewangi Deewangi\" [81] 2008 Jumbo Sonia Voice only [82] Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi Herself Special appearance in song \"Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte\" 2009 Billu Barber Bindiya Rao Pardesi Do Knot Disturb Dolly Blue Mona [83] Satyameva Jayate Herself Telugu film; special appearance in the song \"Aisa Jadoo\" [84] 2010 Housefull Hetal Patel [85] 2011 Chalo Dilli Mihika Banerjee Also producer Don 2 Ayesha 2013 David Neelam [86] Gayathri Tamil version 2015 Singh Is Bliing Emily 2016 Fitoor Leena Becker Special appearance Azhar Advocate Meera Verma 2018 Welcome To New York Sophia 2021 Bell Bottom Indira Gandhi 2023 Ishq-e-Nadaan Ramona Singh [87] Welcome To The Jungle † TBA Filming [88][89] TBA Suryast † Avantika Completed [90] TBA Ramayana † Kaikeyi Filming [91]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Film Role Notes Ref. 2019 Beecham House Begum Samru English series 2020 Hundred ACP Saumya Shukla 2021 Hiccups and Hookups Vasudha 2022 Kaun Banegi Shikharwati Devyani Shikharwat Goel [92] 2023 Charlie Chopra & The Mystery Of Solang Valley Wilayat Hussain [93] 2024 Ranneeti: Balakot & Beyond Manisha Bharadwaj [94]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nActing awards\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Work Result Ref. 2004 Filmfare Awards Best Female Debut Andaaz Won[b] [95] International Indian Film Academy Awards Star Debut of the Year – Female Nominated [96] Sansui Viewers' Choice Movie Awards Most Promising Debut Actress Won [97] Screen Awards Most Promising Newcomer - Female Won [98] Zee Cine Awards Best Female Debut Andaaz & Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost Nominated [99] 2005 Stardust Awards Exciting New Face Khakee Won 2006 International Indian Film Academy Awards Best Supporting Actress No Entry Nominated [100] 2008 Zee Cine Awards Best Actor in a Supporting Role – Female Jhoom Barabar Jhoom Nominated [101] Stardust Awards Best Supporting Actress Nominated [102] 2009 Stardust Awards Best Actress Billu Nominated 2011 Zee Cine Awards Best Actor in a Supporting Role – Female Housefull Nominated Stardust Awards Best Actress in an Ensemble Cast Nominated 2012 Best Actress Chalo Dilli Nominated 2015 BIG Star Entertainment Awards Most Entertaining Actor in a Comedy Role – Female Singh Is Bliing Nominated 2022 International Indian Film Academy Awards Best Supporting Actress Bell Bottom Nominated [103] 22nd Indian Television Academy Awards Best Actress (Comedy) - OTT Kaun Banegi Shikharwati Nominated [104]\n\nOther recognition\n\n[edit]\n\n2008: Dutta won the Rajiv Gandhi Award for her contribution to Indian cinema.[105]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nLara Dutta at IMDb\n\nLara Dutta at AllMovie\n\nLara Dutta at Bollywood Hungama"
