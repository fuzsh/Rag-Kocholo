But this joke was taken seriously by multi-sport apparel startup Zeven, which has led them to design products that are conducive to Indian weather and terrain.\n\nThe startup is run by tennis star Mahesh Bhupathi, along with former Nike country manager (South Asia) Hemchandra Javeri. The startup was born when Bhupathi’s personal experiences and Javeri’s inclination to build a home-grown brand sprouted. \"About three-anda-half years ago, I started speaking with Hemu (the other founder) on a home-grown sports brand, and soon one thing led to another,\" said Bhupathi, director of Zeven.\n\nThe Zeven team spent a good three years in getting to know what actually needs to be done to make the product ‘Indian’. Take, for example, cricket. Zeven has designed three shoes, each for batsmen, bowlers and all-rounders. \"We went to different fields in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune, and understood how Indian ground conditions are different,\" said Ravi Shekhar, head (footwear), Zeven.\n\n\"The batsmen shoes have a slightly tighter grip on the in-step so as to have a snug fit, the all-rounder’s shoe is more ventilated. For the bowlers shoes, we have given more support to the ankle, as it is the most injury-prone part for the bowler,\" he added. One can also choose between titanium and steel spikes.\n\nThe other pain point that Zeven aims to tackle is cost. Zeven’s stress on ‘affordability’ is to make sure that every Indian plays sports. \"The primary angle is ‘Made for India at an affordable price’. If look at the bigger vision, it is about making Indians play sports. We want people to be in a community of sportsmen,\" said Javeri, Zeven’s chairman.\n\nThe company presently offers footwear, apparel and accessories across six sport categories: cricket, football, tennis, run, walk and gym. \"I have been wearing Zeven since August last year and have been testing the products. The results have been great, both at the comfort level and at the fit level,\" said Rohan Bopanna, tennis player.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhat this Sebi proposal for discerning investors means for MFs and PMS\n\nIt took 42 years of grit and finesse to turn a 2-minute promise into an INR9,000 crore brand whose taste unites India\n\nRBI sets stage for the first shift in monetary policy stance since April 2022\n\nWhy India should be worried about what’s happening in Bangladesh\n\nLessons for Indian cybersecurity from Google’s biggest acquisition ever\n\nHow WazirX lost USD230 million in India’s biggest crypto exchange hack\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
