        "text": "The Indian duo got the better of pairs that included Roger Federer and Andy Roddick, but fell agonizingly short of the podium at the end. The 2004 Summer Games in Athens presented another shot at glory, and though they fell short of the podium, their journey was a stirring display of their incredible talent and fighting spirit.\n\nA Rekindled Partnership\n\nBy 2002, their reign as a pair seemed over. Results dipped, and they went their separate ways. However, the allure of an Olympic medal brought them back together for Athens. Having suffered a second-round exit at the previous Olympics, they were determined to make their mark in 2004.\n\nEarly Domination\n\nSeeded fifth, Paes and Bhupathi began their campaign with a convincing win over the American duo of Andy Roddick and Mardy Fish. They displayed nerves of steel in the first-set tie-break before cruising through the second set.\n\nA Glimpse of Brilliance\n\nTheir second match was a masterclass. Facing the formidable Swiss pair of Yves Allegro and a young Roger Federer, Paes and Bhupathi reminded everyone of their prowess. They dismantled their opponents in straight sets, showcasing their exceptional teamwork and court awareness.\n\nFour years later at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, Paes and Bhupathi were up against Federer once again. But this time, in the quarter-finals, the Swiss had Stanislas Wawrinka as his partner and managed to get the win in straight sets.\n\n“It was a sweet revenge today because I lost to them with Yves Allegro four years ago in Athens,” Federer had said after that match.\n\nHeartbreaking End\n\nThe dream run was halted in the semi-finals. Up against the unseeded pair from Germany, Rainer Schuettler and Nicolas Kiefer, the 5th seeded Indian duo who had not lost a set in the competition yet were outclassed 2-6 3-6 by the Germans.\n\nFourth Place, but Unforgettable\n\nPaes and Bhupathi finished fourth, a heartbreaking distance from the podium. Yet, their journey in Athens resonated with Indian fans. They had displayed glimpses of their best tennis, reminding everyone why they were once considered one of the greatest doubles pairs ever.\n\nThe 2004 Olympics might not have delivered a medal, but it cemented Paes and Bhupathi’s place as legends of Indian tennis. Their unwavering determination and exceptional skills continue to inspire aspiring players and serve as a testament to the enduring power of the Indian sporting spirit."
