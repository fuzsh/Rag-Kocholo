        "text": "Leander Paes (born 17 June 1973) is an Indian professional tennis player who currently features in the doubles events in the ATP tour and the Davis Cup tournament. Having won 6 Doubles and 6 Mixed Doubles Tennis Grand Slam titles and finishing runners up in numerous other Grand Slam finals, he is considered to be one of the greatest and most respected contemporary doubles and mixed doubles players in the world. He is among the most successful professional Indian tennis players and is also the former captain of the Indian Davis Cup team. He is the recipient of India's highest sporting honour, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 1996â€“1997, the Arjuna Award in 1990, and the Padma Shri award in 2001 for his outstanding contribution to tennis in India.\n\nApart from his twelve Grand Slam victories at doubles and mixed doubles events, he is famous for his several memorable Davis Cup performances playing for India and also for winning a bronze medal for India in the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games. He also achieved the rare Men's Doubles/Mixed Doubles double during the 1999 Wimbledon. His consecutive Olympic appearances from 1992 to 2008 make him the third Indian, after shooters Karni Singh and Randhir Singh, to compete at five Olympic Games. After winning the Mixed Doubles in Wimbledon 2010, Leander Paes became only the second man (after Rod Laver) to win Wimbledon titles in three different decades. In 2010 he joined the Board of Directors of Olympic Gold Quest,> a foundation co-founded by Geet Sethi and Prakash Padukone to support talented athletes from India in winning Olympic medals.[...]\n\nDuo of Leander Paes & Mahesh Bhupathi were nicknamed as \"Indian Express\".Leander Paes's off and on partnership with fellow Indian tennis player Mahesh Bhupathi draws constant media attention in his home country, India. In the 2006 Asian Games, a loss to the Chinese Taipei in the team event led Leander to question Bhupathi's commitment to Team India. He once stated in an interview that although he and Bhupathi are friends, he did not consider pairing with his former team-mate. However, for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, they decided to play together for their country, and lost in the quarterfinals to the eventual champions Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka.\n\nIn 2011, the \"Indian Express\" pair won the doubles title at Chennai Open. They reunited to play in a Grand Slam Tournament after 9 years and claimed runners-up in the 2011 Australian Open."
