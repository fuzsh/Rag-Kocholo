        "text": "The Indian Davis Cup team began its preparations for the World Group qualifier against Italy in right earnest with non-playing captain Mahesh Bhupathi saying the task of upstaging the visitor was difficult but not impossible.\n\nThe team had its first day of practice on the grass courts of the Calcutta Gymkhana Clubs, giving itself eight days time to get prepared for an opposition which is way superior on paper.\n\nItaly has four players in top-60 —Marco Cecchinato (18), Andreas Seppi (35) and Matteo Berrettini (54). With the Italians deciding to travel without their topmost player Fabio Fognini, Cecchinato will spearhead the challenge.\n\nWhen Bhupathi was asked if the high rankings will play on the minds of Indians, the former World No. 1 in doubles said his team would not to be intimidated by rankings.\n\n“I think my boys are experienced enough to understand that the rankings are not a factor in Davis Cup. They have all played at the highest level now. Both Prajnesh (Gunneswaran) and Ramkumar (Ramanathan) have played Grand Slams and Tour events. So, it is not like that they would be intimidated.\n\n“When I was playing Davis Cup, if I played a top-ranked player it was different because I was always competing at the challenger level. But with these guys I do not think ranking plays a factor. I think they truly believe that they are capable of beating them if they play well.”\n\nThe Indian captain placed his confidence on the form and ability of Prajnesh and Ramkumar. “Prajnesh qualified for his first Grand Slam, so he is on an all-time high confidence wise. He had an amazing breakthrough year last year. He is a late bloomer, because of injury, but is definitely brimming with confidence.” Bhupathi said of the player currently ranked 109.\n\n“On these courts Ram is going to be super dangerous. We all saw what he did in Newport last year as he reached the final, which he should have won. So we are positive,” added Bhupathi."
