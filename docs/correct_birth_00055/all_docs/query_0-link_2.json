        "text": "(born 1974). Indian tennis player Mahesh Bhupathi was one of the most dominant doubles players in the sport’s history.\n\nBhupathi was born on June 7, 1974, in Chennai, India, and started playing tennis at a young age. He had an outstanding two-year career at the University of Mississippi, earning singles and doubles All-America honors in 1995, and he began his professional tennis career that same year. He was India’s national champion in 1994 and 1995, as well as a member of the Indian Davis Cup team from 1995 to 2011. In 1997 he became the first Indian to win a Grand Slam title when he captured the mixed doubles French Open crown along with Japan’s Rika Hiraki.\n\nIn 1994 Bhupathi began a highly successful doubles partnership with countryman Leander Paes. In both 1997 and 1998 the duo captured six Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) doubles titles out of the eight tournament finals they reached during each year. In 1999 Bhupathi and Paes advanced to the finals in all four Grand Slam events, winning the French Open and Wimbledon but losing in the Australian and U.S. opens. That year saw the pair ascend to the number one ATP doubles ranking. In 2001 Bhupathi and Paes again won the French Open doubles title, and they also received the Padma Shri, one of India’s highest civilian awards. In 2002 Bhupathi claimed the U.S. Open doubles title with Belarus’s Max Mirnyi."
