Winning it at Wimbledon is even more.\"\n\nHowever, the winner of seven other Grand Slam titles, all in partnership with different players, said it is still uncertain whether he will team up with Pierce at the US Open in August.\n\n\"We will have to wait and see whether that happens,\" Bhupathi, who will celebrate his 31st birthday on Wednesday, said.\n\nHis earlier Grand Slam mixed doubles titles were at the 1997 French Open, with Rika Hiraki; the 1999 US Open, with Ai Sugiyama; and the 2002 Wimbledon championships, with Elena Likhovtseva.\n\nThe Chennai-born six-footer has won 37 doubles titles on the international circuit, including three of his four Grand Slam men's doubles crowns with compatriot Leander Paes [Images] before the `Indian Express' partnership split in 2001.\n\nAsked about his immediate plans, Bhupathi, who also runs the event management company GloboSport that handles India's top woman player Sania Mirza [Images], said he would be heading to Germany [Images] to rejoin the circuit in the Stuttgart Open, where he will team up with American Martin Damm.\n\nComplete tennis coverage\n\nAll you want to know about Sania Mirza"
