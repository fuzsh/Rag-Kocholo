        "text": "Mahesh Bhupathi turns 40 on Saturday, an important milestone for any top athlete.\n\nHaving lived out of suitcases for over two decades, he has decided The Championships at Wimbledon will be his farewell event.\n\nAs the strapping champion reflected on the four decades and what he has achieved as a player, son, husband and father, Mahesh had one word to describe it: fulfiling.\n\nMahesh Bhupathi, who turns forty on May 7, and longtime doubles partner Leander Paes shared great chemistry and off court they even shared a pizza. It continued till 1999, when they made it to all the four Grand Slam finals\n\nThat, perhaps, sums up the philosophy of his live-life-kingsize attitude on and off the court.\n\nFor many players, retirement is a very tough decision.\n\nPerhaps, it is an amalgam of factors that Mahesh decided Wimbledon will be his last event where he is hoping to get into the draw with Marcin Matkowski.\n\nJust before the French Open, Mahesh had tweeted how his heart was in Paris but the legs were not going to hold up.\n\nThat was a clear sign retirement could not be pushed back.\n\nAs one who learnt the basics of serve, forehand and backhand in Oman under the tutelage of dad CGK Bhupathi, Mahesh would himself have never imagined he would make it so big. When he started as a pro, singles was his main focus, though he was not quick on his feet.\n\nSomeone like Naresh Kumar, the former Davis Cup nonplaying captain would keep saying \"his legs were bad.\"\n\nThe tall man worked hard on his movement and results were there to see. He won the grasscourt nationals, competed in back-to-back Challenger finals against Leander Paes on the Challenger circuit and then registered some memorable wins in Davis Cup as well.\n\nHis exploits in the World Group tie against the Netherlands in 1996 in Jaipur and the fifth rubber win over Chile's Gabriel Silberstein (1997, New Delhi) will never be forgotten.\n\nThe turning point in his career came in 1997 when he registered some incredible wins on the ATP Tour with Leander Paes as his doubles partner. From Chennai to Europe and then USA, the duo stormed the world.\n\nThe same year they also made it to the seasonending World Doubles finals in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nOn court, Mahesh and Leander shared great chemistry and off court they even shared a pizza.\n\nIt continued till 1999, when they made it to all the four Grand Slam finals.\n\nPerhaps, immense success was the reason for bickering with his partner. The 'Indian Express,' as the pair liked to call themselves, split, and came together again.\n\nIt became almost a habit with them but deep down there was a massive trust deficit.\n\nIf one wants to remember the good records of Leander and Mahesh, you will also have to factor their fights played out in the media.\n\nMahesh Bhupathi, who was born in Madras in 1974 and turned professional in 1995, won the 2012 French Open with Sania Mirza\n\nOn the personal front, Mahesh had his highs and lows.\n\nIf he was successful with eight different partners in mixed doubles, in real life he was a big hit with the women.\n\nA broken marriage with Shvetha Jaishankar led to a second marriage with film star Lara Dutta. Today, when Mahesh talks of \"fulfillment\" it is in a complete sense.\n\nIt is sad he never won an Olympic medal and at the same time was always portrayed as the villain vis a vis his relationship with Leander.\n\nYet, tennis fans will remember him as a great team person who played with passion and pride. Unlike other athletes around the globe who wonder what to do post retirement, Mahesh has his task cut out.\n\nHaving run Globosport and managed star players like Sania Mirza, Mahesh is now the brain behind the International Tennis Premier League which will feature icons like Rafael Nadal, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi.\n\nMahesh Bhupathi , who will retire after playing at Wimbledon this summer, won the 2006 Australian Open with Martina Hingis\n\nWhen his eyes gaze at the Wimbledon grass for one last time, you could be sure his eyes will be moist.\n\nHe used to have a bazooka serve before a shoulder injury."
