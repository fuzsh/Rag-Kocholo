George Orwell was an English novelist, essayist, journalist, and critic. He is best known for his novels ‘Animal Farm’ and ‘Nineteen Eighty-Four.’ Both ‘Animal Farm’ and ‘Nineteen Eighty-Four’ are literary masterpieces. Born in India to a British civil servant, George Orwell’s birth name was Eric Arthur Blair; George Orwell was his pen name. A year after his birth, his mother took him to England. Orwell studied at ‘Eton College,’ an independent boarding school for boys. Since his family did not have the financial means to support his university education, he joined the ‘Indian Imperial Police.’ He served in Burma for five years and then resigned and returned to England in order to pursue his passion for writing. He adopted the pen name George Orwell when he took to writing; he did so because he did not want to embarrass his family. Initially, he struggled to make ends meet with his writing career. His writing career came into prominence with his 1945 novel ‘Animal Farm.’ It was an anti-Soviet satire with two pigs as its main protagonists. The pigs ostensibly represented Josef Stalin and Leon Trotsky. His next masterpiece 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' explored how a totalitarian regime persecutes individualism. Orwell is still revered today and features in the list of the greatest writers of all time.
