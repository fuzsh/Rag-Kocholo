        "text": "June 25, 1903 – January 21, 1950\n\nGeorge Orwell was a UK author who wrote the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four—one of the best dystopian novels of the 20th century. Its tale of perpetual war, mass surveillance, and stamping out of individualism resonates to this day.\n\nBorn in India and raised mainly in England, Orwell started his professional career by following in his father's footsteps in the Indian Civil service, joining the Indian Imperial Police as an Assistant District Superintendent in 1922. It was through this life experience Orwell realized his distaste for colonial rule, which would frame much of his literary work to come.\n\nIn 1928 Orwell resigned from the Imperial Police and started his career as an author. His first novels, Down and Out in Paris and London (1933) and Burmese Days (1934), gave him literary recognition. Ten years later Orwell became a phenomenon with Animal Farm (1945). The novel mocks the USSR by depicting an animal coup against farmers, which only results in the animals turning against themselves and establishing another unjust state within their now “free” livelihood."
