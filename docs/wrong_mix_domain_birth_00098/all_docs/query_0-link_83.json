        "text": "At his essence, Bobby Fischer was the outlaw biker of the chess world,\n\na lonely, extraordinarily eccentric, extremely volatile genius —\n\nhalf-man, half-beast, pure will — whose moves on a chessboard and in\n\nhis everyday life were as stubborn and unpredictable as the weather\n\njust outside the Reykjavik apartment where he spent his final three\n\nyears.\n\nHe was a legendary recluse, an enigma who both captivated, shocked, and\n\noffended the world. Yet for all his innumerable eccentricities,\n\niron-fisted bull-headedness, and vitriolic assaults against Jews and\n\nhis own American government, during his last years, Bobby Fischer,\n\nmanaged to find some well-deserved solace in a place one might not\n\nexpect: sitting in a wooden chair tucked in the back corner of a quiet\n\nbookstore in downtown Reykjavik.\n\nBókin, or The Book, is essentially a 1950s version of New York’s Strand\n\nBookstore. Besides the books stacked head-high, under card tables, and\n\non plywood shelves, the first thing you notice about Bókin is its\n\nsmell, decayed and airless. Walking inside the 35-year-old\n\nestablishment is like entering a Parisian flea market without the\n\nnoise: overwhelming, a paralysis of the senses. But it was here,\n\nbetween narrow aisles lined with thousands of fraying biographies and\n\nhistory books, sitting in an ordinary chair whose varnish had worn\n\nthin, where Bobby Fischer could be alone in his thoughts. It was here\n\nwhere he could contemplate his place in history by poring through\n\nbooks on outlaws and rebels from Russia, Britain, Libya, and the Soviet\n\nUnion with whom he could relate. And it was here, beneath the quiet hum\n\nof the fluorescent lights above, where Bobby Fischer could, for at\n\nleast a few hours a day, seem to live a normal life.\n\n“Bobby said he liked this kind of bookshop because it reminded him of\n\nhis younger New York years. The mess everywhere, the stacks of books,\n\nthe smell,” says owner Bragi Kristjónsson. “He was often sitting here\n\nso long, reading from these shelves, that he fell asleep.”\n\n•\n\nBorn Robert James Fischer on March 9, 1943, the Brooklyn-raised\n\nhigh-school dropout was the youngest, the best and the smartest. He\n\nstarted moving rooks at age six. By 14, he had become the U.S.\n\nchampion. At 15 he was crowned the world’s youngest grandmaster. But\n\nFischer’s pinnacle achievement occurred nine years later in 1972, in\n\nReykjavik, the city where he would eventually die, when he beat Russian\n\ngrandmaster Boris Spassky before a crowd of 5,000 to become the world\n\nchampion.\n\nGudmundur Thórarinsson first met Fischer in February 1972 when he was\n\nPresident of the Icelandic Chess Federation. The federation was\n\nresponsible for helping to organize and publicize the match, famously\n\ndubbed the “Match of the Century.” Back then, Iceland was known at best\n\nfor its cod and at worst for its archaic language. At the time,\n\nThórarinsson had doubts the match merited such an audacious title,\n\nthought that perhaps it was a gross exaggeration of the truth. But his\n\nconcerns were overruled and “Match of the Century” it would remain.\n\nRightly so.\n\nThere are more than 150 books and at least 40 television shows and\n\ndocumentaries about the day a chessboard made from marble and mahogany\n\npitted the Russian great against the young American, East versus West.\n\nNow, 35 years later, Thórarinsson has no doubt the title was correct,\n\nif not an understatement. “The name of the match should be the ‘Match\n\nof all Times,’” says Thórarinsson, who would later become one of only a\n\nhandful of people who would fight for Fischer’s political asylum in\n\nIceland. “The surroundings of this match were so strange. Capitalism\n\nagainst communism. The two superpowers competing and dividing the world\n\nideologically into friends and foes. Fischer brought up by a single\n\nmother and trying to learn chess by himself versus the chess foundation\n\nof the Soviet Union. I’m of the opinion that the world will never have\n\nthe structure or the possibility to create situations that are anything\n\nsimilar to what happened there. Nothing like it will never ever be\n\nrepeated.”\n\nFridrik Ólafsson, Iceland’s first grandmaster champion, and Fischer\n\nbecame friends in 1958, when they met at a tournament in Yugoslavia.\n\nÓlafsson recalls a story from 1972 when Fischer had visited Iceland to\n\nscout out the conditions before the tournament. Fischer had tried\n\nÓlafsson at home, but the latter was away and his daughter answered the\n\nphone instead, saying something to Fischer in Icelandic. The next time\n\nÓlafsson and Fischer met, Fischer recited in Icelandic (without knowing\n\nthe language) exactly what his friend’s daughter had said. Though\n\nFischer didn’t know the words, he had remembered her words exactly.\n\n“This was really incredible. You could see how his faculties, his\n\nbrain, worked. He had a very good memory, phenomenal. If he saw or\n\nplayed a game, he remembered it instantly. And he could instantly\n\nremember the call of the game, the essential factor that ruled the\n\ngame. He was very quick.”\n\nAfter his victory in Iceland, Fischer wouldn’t play chess again until\n\n1992. He agreed to compete against his former nemesis, Spassky, in\n\nYugoslavia, and won. His purse was $3.5 million, plus an arrest warrant\n\nfrom the U.S. government for violating sanctions against the Balkan\n\nnation. He literally spat on the indictment at a press conference and\n\nwould never step foot on United States soil again. From that time on,\n\nhe led a nomadic existence that eventually landed him a nine-month\n\nstint in a Japanese prison in July 2004, where he was accused of trying\n\nto leave Japan — home of his long-time companion Miyoko Watai — with an\n\ninvalid passport.\n\nBut soon a handful of Icelanders sympathetic to his humanitarian cause,\n\nand still captivated by his 1972 victory, would listen to his appeal\n\nfor asylum. One of them, Magnús Skúlason, would eventually watch\n\nFischer die from his bedside. Iceland’s then-foreign minister, David\n\nOddsson, championed Fischer’s cause and Althingi, Iceland’s parliament,\n\nvoted unanimously to expedite his citizenship.\n\nBobby Fischer arrived in Iceland in March 2005 looking more hermit than\n\nhuman. Some people mistook him for a homeless person. But soon after\n\nhis arrival he began to lumber into Bókin, sometimes burdened with\n\ngrocery bags filled with bottled water, and take his seat in the back —\n\nsecluded, just as he preferred, reading about people he believed\n\nsuffered fates similar to his. In many ways, Bókin became his\n\nsafehaven, his very own Green Zone and even, occasionally, his post\n\noffice. Fischer became so paranoid in his final years that he refused\n\nto have his mail delivered to his apartment. Instead, it would be\n\ndelivered to his longtime friend and former bodyguard Saemunder\n\nPálsson. But when Pálsson was abroad, Fischer’s mail was delivered\n\ninstead to the bookstore, and owner Bragi Kristjónsson would pass it\n\nalong. Fischer didn’t have many close friends, but he was loyal to\n\nthose he did have.\n\nThe last time Fischer visited Bókin was in early October, before he\n\nbecame sick. In many ways, Bókin was the deeply rooted giving tree\n\nFischer so desperately needed, a place where he could either fuel — or\n\nseek shelter from — the storms brewing in his head. He remained\n\nobstinate until his dying day, refusing Western treatment for what\n\nwould ultimately lead to kidney failure, a move he could not outsmart\n\nwith any amount of intellect or logic. Bobby Fischer may have been able\n\nto defy his opponents but in the end, he couldn’t triumph over his own\n\ntired body.\n\nA few days ago, Magnús Skúlason walked into the bookshop just as\n\nKristjónsson was about to close up for the night and as I was about to\n\nleave. Kristjónsson introduced the two of us, and after thumbing\n\nthrough several back issues of Foreign Affairs, Skúlason invited me to\n\nsit down with him. Though he had been an admirer of Fischer for decades\n\nand helped secure his citizenship, Skúlason, a psychiatrist, had never\n\nspoken with Fischer at length until the fall. Whether out of necessity\n\nor loneliness, Fischer took to Skúlason. In a world of few absolutes,\n\none thing that was certain about Bobby Fischer was that he never liked\n\nto be quizzed. He would share when he felt impelled. And when he\n\nshared, he shared intensely and deeply. Skúlason would not have to prod; Fischer would just tell.\n\n“I think he was terribly misunderstood,” Skulason says slowly and with\n\ncare. “I think he was an extremely sensitive and rather tender man on\n\nthe inside. He was deeply interested in all kinds of humanistic affairs\n\nand searching for understanding. Unfortunately for him, it’s very\n\ntragic because he was also known as this harsh, angry man.”\n\n“I have a feeling he may have had an unhappy childhood. It’s always\n\neasy to revise afterwards, but he might have needed better help after\n\nhe became so famous so young. He did not like his fame. His fame made\n\nhim uncomfortable.”\n\nBobby Fischer’s rise and ultimate fall has been well-documented in the\n\nhistory books. But his death will probably mean some addendum in\n\ncoming years to those that will eventually sit on the shelves of the\n\nvery bookstore where the chess great whiled away his final years."
