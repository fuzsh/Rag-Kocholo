        "text": "Tuesday, August 13, 2019\n\nLocal History Month\n\nUpperdeckers: 142\n\nAugust is Local History Month on diamond geezer. Over the years I've explored the length of the River Fleet, walked around the edge of Tower Hamlets and crossed the capital on a line of latitude, to name but a few of my exciting quests. This year I thought I'd ride all the double decker London bus routes which run outside the capital and write you a running commentary, in a series I'm calling Upperdeckers.\n\nTourists often spend a fortune riding sightseeing buses around central London but rarely explore the outskirts. And yet top deck front seat tours are available at an exceptionally reasonable price... if only there was a commentary to accompany them. So I've set myself the task of writing real-time commentaries for bus journeys beyond the London border in an attempt to stimulate peripheral travel. Simply reset your screen reader to audio mode and the spoken text will automatically synchronise with your bus journey, no matter how bad the traffic. Let's start in Hertfordshire and ride the red double decker that runs past the place where I was born, because it doesn't get more local than that.\n\nBushey Heath → Watford Junction\n\n(I'm riding the 142, but you can also ride the 258)\n\nOur upperdecker journey begins at the crossroads where Stanmore Common merges into Bushey Heath. Today this marks the boundary between London and Hertfordshire, although prior to 1st April 1993 the dividing line crossed the road a short distance ahead. The next pair of bus stops are still operated by Transport for London, not Hertfordshire County Council. When you reach the Harvester restaurant look out for the boundary stone on the pavement opposite. It has Herts carved on on side and Middx on the other. This used to be the highest point in Middlesex. You are now 505 feet above sea level.\n\nOn the right hand side is Windmill Lane which once led to a smock mill used for grinding corn. The shopping parade at Bushey Heath is relatively modern, and in sunny weather attracts a certain silver-haired cafe culture. Note the pair of semi-detached cottages on the right, one named Alpha and the other Omega. St Peter's parish church is unmissable ahead. It was founded as a small chapel in 1836, extended in 1891 and mostly rebuilt in 1911. The foundation stone in the Chapel of St George was laid by General Edmund Phipps Hornby, who earned his Victoria Cross in the Boer War.\n\nThe Three Crowns is Bushey's oldest public house, in continuous service since 1749. This would have been the first building 18th century travellers reached after crossing open heathland from Stanmore, providing welcome respite from the threat of highwaymen. Bushey Heath is said to have been a favoured haunt of Dick Turpin, because this is said about virtually every heath everywhere. A short distance up the Elstree Road, on Little Bushey Lane, is the scout hut in which George Michael performed his first gig as a teenager. You cannot see this from the bus because it is around a different corner.\n\nThe road ahead is Sparrows Herne, a former turnpike opened in 1762 to carry traffic between here and Aylesbury. The land drops away steadily from this high point, but from the top deck there are excellent views across the entire Colne Valley towards the distant ridge of the Chilterns. Note the iron sign outside the cottage-style public library depicting two readers sitting back to back. Bushey used to lie within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Police, and the tall villa on the left with the high chimneys operated as a police station between 1884 and 2011. It is now flats, a fate which may soon befall the Royal Oak public house.\n\nThe bus now descends between some properly villagey housing, the oldest of which is Fern Cottage on the right hand side. A plaque outside says 1518, but its listing details reckon it's only early 17th century. Look back up School Lane to see Bushey's war memorial, designed by Sir William Reid Dick, depicting a mournful female figure with her head bowed. St Hilda's School celebrated its centenary last year. Across the hillside to the left is Bushey Golf Course, a municipal nine-holer which closed last year. Bushey Country Club closed at the same time because Hertsmere council found operations financially unsustainable.\n\nOn the corner of Melbourne Road is the entrance to Bushey Rose Garden, a beautiful public space with sunken fountain, pergola and summerhouse. It used to be the front garden of Lululaund, an amazing Romanesque home built for the acclaimed artist Hubert von Herkomer in 1894. Alas after he and his wife died the council only wanted the gardens, so everything other than Lululaund's front porch was demolished. Across the road a notionally similar block of flats called Herkomer House is almost complete. Herkomer's story is well told at Bushey Museum and Art Gallery, a welcoming collection of paintings and antiquities up Rudolph Road. Why not pause the audio description at this point, hop off and explore?\n\nAhead is the historic heart of Bushey (the name derives from the Old English ‘bysce’ meaning ‘place covered with wood’). St James's church has a 13th century chancel, 14th century timbered roof and 15th century tower, but the majority of the building is late Victorian. The original Red Lion pub dates back to 1648. Mavis has been selling wool and craft materials on the corner of Cow Lane since 1935. The wisteria-covered cottage opposite the village green was for many years occupied by Lucy Kemp-Welch, the artist who illustrated the 1915 edition of Black Beauty. The huge scary effigy on the tower of the Catholic church was carved by John Green.\n\nAt the top of Chalk Hill, by the Baptist church with the fluted octagonal spire, we pass from Hertsmere into Watford. Because of the one-way system we need to divert past Bushey station, its main building designed in characterful redbrick style. Two of the arms on its weathervane are somewhat bent. Can you see which two? Ahead is Bushey Arches - a very early brick railway viaduct carrying the London to Birmingham railway over the valley of the River Colne, and built by Robert Stephenson. The arches look a lot more impressive from the other side. A further viaduct, just beyond B&Q, carries the Overground to Watford High Street.\n\nThe Lower High Street appears to be mostly car showrooms, because these are quite easy to evacuate if the river ever floods. Jaguars, Mercedes, Suzukis, Seats and Saabs are locally available. Tesco's hypermarket beside the Colne was the first in the UK to open a Giraffe restaurant. The yellow-painted Pump House Theatre has been alternatively cultural since the 1970s. On the left are the offices of the Benskins Brewery, repurposed in 1994 as Watford Museum, an unexpectedly gloomy warren that's not worth getting off the bus for. Watford High Street station is closed this week so that its main staircase can be repaired.\n\nWatford's town centre was encircled by an inner ring road in the 1970s, but buses continue to enter the foot of the old high street. Half-timbered buildings include The One Crown on the left and Pizza Express on the right. Look out for the Hornet statue outside McDonalds, formerly Woolworths, and note that Littlewoods has been reborn as a Primark. Returning to the ring road, the modern houses on the far side cover the site of King Street Maternity Hospital where thousands took their first breath between 1930 and 1969. Lovers of Modernist architecture will adore the spiral ramp of the Church Street multi-storey.\n\nHold tight as the ring road unexpectedly leaps over the middle of the high street on a brief flyover. Intu Watford is the former Harlequin shopping centre, recently extended to include a cinema and an ill-advised Debenhams. Clarendon Road has become a magnet for ugly office blocks, including the current European HQ of TK Maxx and also the larger HQ they're building for themselves opposite Watford Junction station. Before alighting at the bus station look out for the decorated buses taking Harry Potter fans to the Studio Tour in Leavesden. Do not join their queue - the commentary is distinctly poor.\n\nUpdate: Except that most of the double deckers venturing outside London follow far less interesting routes. You might well enjoy the 107 through Borehamwood but the 403 to Warlingham is nothing special, the 467 to Epsom underwhelms and the 279 to Waltham Cross is ridiculously brief, so essentially I don't think this feature can be completed.\n\nposted 01:42 :\n\n<< click for Newer posts\n\nclick for Older Posts >>\n\nclick to return to the main page\n\nLife viewed from London E3\n\n» email me\n\n» follow me on twitter\n\n» follow the blog on Twitter\n\n» follow the blog on RSS\n\n» my flickr photostream\n\ntwenty blogs\n\nour bow\n\narseblog\n\nian visits\n\nlondonist\n\nbroken tv\n\nblue witch\n\non london\n\nthe great wen\n\nedith's streets\n\nspitalfields life\n\nlinkmachinego\n\nround the island\n\nwanstead meteo\n\nchristopher fowler\n\nthe greenwich wire\n\nbus and train user\n\nruth's coastal walk\n\nround the rails we go\n\nlondon reconnections\n\nfrom the murky depths\n\nquick reference features\n\nThings to do in Outer London\n\nThings to do outside London\n\nLondon's waymarked walks\n\nInner London toilet map\n\n20 years of blog series\n\nThe DG Tour of Britain\n\nLondon's most...\n\nread the archive\n\nJul24 Jun24 May24\n\nApr24 Mar24 Feb24 Jan24\n\nDec23 Nov23 Oct23 Sep23\n\nAug23 Jul23 Jun23 May23\n\nApr23 Mar23 Feb23 Jan23\n\nDec22 Nov22 Oct22 Sep22\n\nAug22 Jul22 Jun22 May22\n\nApr22 Mar22 Feb22 Jan22\n\nDec21 Nov21 Oct21 Sep21\n\nAug21 Jul21 Jun21 May21\n\nApr21 Mar21 Feb21 Jan21\n\nDec20 Nov20 Oct20 Sep20\n\nAug20 Jul20 Jun20 May20\n\nApr20 Mar20 Feb20 Jan20\n\nDec19 Nov19 Oct19 Sep19\n\nAug19 Jul19 Jun19 May19\n\nApr19 Mar19 Feb19 Jan19\n\nDec18 Nov18 Oct18 Sep18\n\nAug18 Jul18 Jun18 May18\n\nApr18 Mar18 Feb18 Jan18\n\nDec17 Nov17 Oct17 Sep17\n\nAug17 Jul17 Jun17 May17\n\nApr17 Mar17 Feb17 Jan17\n\nDec16 Nov16 Oct16 Sep16\n\nAug16 Jul16 Jun16 May16\n\nApr16 Mar16 Feb16 Jan16\n\nDec15 Nov15 Oct15 Sep15\n\nAug15 Jul15 Jun15 May15\n\nApr15 Mar15 Feb15 Jan15\n\nDec14 Nov14 Oct14 Sep14\n\nAug14 Jul14 Jun14 May14\n\nApr14 Mar14 Feb14 Jan14\n\nDec13 Nov13 Oct13 Sep13\n\nAug13 Jul13 Jun13 May13\n\nApr13 Mar13 Feb13 Jan13\n\nDec12 Nov12 Oct12 Sep12\n\nAug12 Jul12 Jun12 May12\n\nApr12 Mar12 Feb12 Jan12\n\nDec11 Nov11 Oct11 Sep11\n\nAug11 Jul11 Jun11 May11\n\nApr11 Mar11 Feb11 Jan11\n\nDec10 Nov10 Oct10 Sep10\n\nAug10 Jul10 Jun10 May10\n\nApr10 Mar10 Feb10 Jan10\n\nDec09 Nov09 Oct09 Sep09\n\nAug09 Jul09 Jun09 May09\n\nApr09 Mar09 Feb09 Jan09\n\nDec08 Nov08 Oct08 Sep08\n\nAug08 Jul08 Jun08 May08\n\nApr08 Mar08 Feb08 Jan08\n\nDec07 Nov07 Oct07 Sep07\n\nAug07 Jul07 Jun07 May07\n\nApr07 Mar07 Feb07 Jan07\n\nDec06 Nov06 Oct06 Sep06\n\nAug06 Jul06 Jun06 May06\n\nApr06 Mar06 Feb06 Jan06\n\nDec05 Nov05 Oct05 Sep05\n\nAug05 Jul05 Jun05 May05\n\nApr05 Mar05 Feb05 Jan05\n\nDec04 Nov04 Oct04 Sep04\n\nAug04 Jul04 Jun04 May04\n\nApr04 Mar04 Feb04 Jan04\n\nDec03 Nov03 Oct03 Sep03\n\nAug03 Jul03 Jun03 May03\n\nApr03 Mar03 Feb03 Jan03\n\nDec02 Nov02 Oct02 Sep02\n\nback to main page\n\nthe diamond geezer index\n\n2023 2022\n\n2021 2020 2019 2018 2017\n\n2016 2015 2014 2013 2012\n\n2011 2010 2009 2008 2007\n\n2006 2005 2004 2003 2002\n\nmy special London features\n\na-z of london museums\n\nE3 -
