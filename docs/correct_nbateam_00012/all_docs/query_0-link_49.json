        "text": "(Editor’s note: Welcome back to The Athletic NBA 75. We’re re-running our top 40 players to count down every day from Sept. 8-Oct. 17, the day before the opening of the 2022-23 NBA season. This piece was first published on Jan. 27, 2022.)\n\nIt was one of those perfect summer evenings during a family trip from Minnesota to the northeast in 1995, 65 degrees and sunny as 16-year-old me walked into Fenway Park for the very first time. The Red Sox were hosting the Toronto Blue Jays, and we settled into our seats near the top of a section above the third-base dugout, a momentous occasion for a sports-crazy kid who begged his parents to sprinkle some games into the history and sightseeing.\n\nAs I sat down and marveled at the Green Monster in front of me, I still couldn’t help but pull out a Sony Walkman, put the headphones over my ears and start listening as intently as I was watching. It wasn’t the radio broadcast of the game, but coverage of the 1995 NBA Draft.\n\nMy hometown Timberwolves had the fifth pick and there were so many intriguing possibilities in a class filled with household names. Jerry Stackhouse and Rasheed Wallace from North Carolina. Damon Stoudamire from Arizona. Michigan State’s Shawn Respert and UCLA’s Ed O’Bannon, all players I watched on television at storied college programs who became well-known stars with tantalizing potential.\n\nThere was another name out there I had never seen take one dribble, but he grabbed my attention as much as any other. In the week leading up to the draft, I pulled the Sports Illustrated out of the mailbox to see a skinny high school kid on the cover with the tagline “Ready or Not …”\n\n“Three weeks ago Kevin Garnett went to his high school prom,” the subhead read, stretching across a young man with legs so long they did not even fit onto the magazine cover despite his best efforts to fold himself into the camera frame. “Next week he’ll be a top pick in the NBA Draft.”\n\nThis was before YouTube compilations and Twitter highlights and ESPN coverage of high school games, so there was an air of mystery surrounding this kid’s game that rarely happens these days. And he was a kid, just a little bit older and a whole lot bigger than I was at the time. The story told of a player with the audacity to jump straight from high school to the NBA, the first player to do it in two decades. The great Jack McCallum detailed a big man with guard skills and movie-star charisma, someone NBA front-office personnel predicted would be the kind of magnetic presence who could “put backsides in the seats when Michael and Shaq aren’t in town.”\n\nSitting in one of the grandest ballparks there is, on a picture-perfect night, the biggest thrill came when NBA commissioner David Stern announced, “With the fifth pick in the 1995 NBA Draft, the Minnesota Timberwolves select Kevin Garnett, from Farragut Academy in Chicago.”\n\nGarnett checks in at No. 17 on The Athletic’s list of the top 75 players in NBA history after a 21-year career that started with cementing the Timberwolves’ place in the league and also included returning the proud Boston Celtics to their once-preordained spot at the top of the basketball world.\n\nWidely considered one of the very best and most versatile defenders of his or any generation, Garnett was the MVP in 2004 after leading the Timberwolves to the Western Conference finals, their only trip outside of the first round in franchise history. He was a 15-time All-Star, the NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2007-08 and a nine-time member of the first team All-Defense, the rare player capable of guarding any position on the floor and shutting him down. He won the rebounding title four times and no player has grabbed more than his 11,453 defensive rebounds.\n\nAbove all the numbers and superlatives, no one played with more fire, from the moment he first stepped foot on the court in 1995 to the day he retired 21 years later.\n\nUp until that day he was drafted, for anyone who wasn’t old enough to remember the Minneapolis Lakers, professional basketball in Minnesota was more of an idea than a reality. The Timberwolves entered the NBA in 1989, lost at least 60 games in five of their first six seasons (they lost 53 in the other one) and were so mismanaged that they nearly moved to New Orleans in 1994. There was nothing identifiable about them.\n\nIn a league with Jordan and Shaq and Hakeem and Barkley and Penny, Wolves fans had to settle for Christian Laettner and Tom Gugliotta and Doug West to get them excited. They always seemed to be a step behind, from building the last arena in the league with more seats in the upper deck than the lower bowl to constantly ending up one pick away from a true star in the draft lottery.\n\nGarnett represented the first time the Timberwolves, as an organization, were ahead of the game in any way, shape or form. When he arrived in the Twin Cities, it marked Wolves fans’ first introduction to the real NBA. Until that point, Wolves fans had only known scrappy, undertalented teams that only really had a chance to win on a given night if the opponent took them lightly. Once Garnett arrived, the team quickly morphed from the cute, cuddly Shep teams that were easily dismissed to the snarling, howling teams lurking in the trees that would huff and puff and blow your basket down.\n\nTarget Center was already there, so you couldn’t say that it was the place that KG built. But he was responsible for keeping the lights on. He was the franchise’s first bankable star, endearing himself to the hard-working, basketball-loving community by making sure that anyone who bought a ticket to come to see him play got their money’s worth. His No. 21 jersey was the only one for fans to have when he first arrived, and the All-Star appearances and playoff berths that quickly followed gave young fans a reason to tune in for the first time in, well, ever.\n\nBefore Garnett’s arrival, I was a casual NBA fan. I loved Jordan, of course, and rooted for the Gary Payton-Shawn Kemp Sonics, and my father was a Celtics fan. But there wasn’t much of a reason to watch the Wolves other than to see the other team. Garnett changed all of that. His youthful enthusiasm was instantly endearing. The way he always insisted on being listed at 6-foot-11 rather than the 7-foot-1 he was likely a lot closer to — KG always thought it would prevent coaches from forcing him to ditch his guard skills and make him live in the post — resonated with a fan base that counts modesty as one of its most treasured personality traits.\n\nBut above all else, it was the intensity that drew everyone in. Garnett would work up a full lather in pregame warmups, stewing and swearing and foaming at the mouth as he prepared to go to battle in the game. Before every tip, he would stand underneath the Wolves basket, tie his shorts and butt his head against the stanchion, talking to himself the entire time. Maybe it was something an opponent said in the media that pissed him off. Maybe it was the suggestion, real or invented, that another power forward was better than he was. Maybe it was the doubts that Garnett could convert a hockey state into a hoops one that fueled that fire in his belly. It was probably a combination of all those things, and some other slights conjured out of thin air, but he brought it every night.\n\n“I’m out there and I suit up every night,” Garnett told coaching legend John Thompson in an epic interview as the team was starting to crumble in 2005, a season after reaching the Western Conference finals. “I suit up every night. Banged up, hurt, whatever. Hundred percent, 30 percent, ain’t no numbers. It’s in my heart, and you can’t measure that.”\n\n“This ain’t golf. It ain’t tennis,” Garnett, who politely declined an interview for this piece, told Thompson as tears streamed down his face. “It ain’t about me. It’s about us.”\n\nAs I rose up the journalism ranks and left my fandom behind, the closer I got into KG’s orbit, the clearer it became on how his passion, his zeal, his cutting competitiveness could transform an organization. I was a pup as his first run in Minnesota was winding down, most often not even getting to write stories from the games but rather tasked with compiling interviews and quotes for The Associated Press writers to include in their stories. Many a night, I was tasked with waiting in the locker room for Garnett to come out to talk. He was notorious for taking a long time to come down after the game before addressing the media, so I would have to stand sentry while the writers pecked away on deadline.\n\nIt was always worth the wait. Some players stare right through a reporter, muttering whatever inanities it takes to get him off the hook and out of the locker room as quickly and painlessly as possible. Garnett stared into your soul as he dissected your motives, then offered nuanced, detailed and colorful examinations of what went right or what went wrong on a particular night.\n\nFor a young reporter, and an older one who was exposed to him again when he returned to the Wolves at the end of the 2014-15 season, it was captivating. In the earlier days of Garnett’s time in Minnesota, reporters sat courtside at Target Center. One of Garnett’s favorite pregame rituals was to come to the scorer’s table, dump a huge portion of talcum powder into his massive hands and clap them together right over the reporters sitting there preparing for the game, his way to needle us. Some of the veteran scribes would purposely wait to get to their seats until after the opening tip so Garnett couldn’t get them, grumbling the whole way about how no one ever dared tell him to knock it off.\n\nI, on the other hand, developed a ritual of my own. I would get out there early, bringing with me an extra packet of pregame notes. I would tear sheets out of the packet and cover my laptop. Then I would place my reporters notebook over the drink I brought to ensure none of the powder would land in my Coca-Cola. Then I would sit there and let KG have his fun. He would say a little, “What’s good?” as he doused me in the powder, then head to center court for the opening tip. I would then stand up, wipe the powder from my hair and pick up the sheets of paper covering the laptop and dump them into a nearby trash can. Fans would laugh, and I would, too. It never bothered me because I always saw it as playful hazing, not bullying. It was clear even back then that he was a Hall of Fame player, the most important member of the franchise, and I wanted to experience as much of him as possible.\n\nThat also meant seeing him change the energy in the room as soon as he was within 10 feet of it. Pregame locker rooms for KG-led teams were painfully quiet, with Garnett making it clear in no uncertain terms that it was a time for focus, for preparation, for concentration. Those who could not abide were castigated. Those who didn’t like it … well, this is what he told me in 2018 at the height of the Jimmy Butler drama:\n\n“I built this house,” he said when I asked about why he never requested a trade back in the day. “I’m not leaving this goddamn house. You can get the fuck up out of here. You don’t like it, then leave.\n\n“I would hear a bunch of whining and it’s snowing and it’s cold and why are we practicing. Man, you know what this was when you signed up. If you don’t want to be here, get the fuck up out of here, man. Guys know this. Guys know what you sign up for. I never asked for a trade because I never wanted to be traded.”\n\nIt was exactly what Timberwolves fans needed to hear. Butler was burning their house down, trashing the organization and making a mockery of their fandom. Garnett always stood tall for Minnesota, and even though he left on bad terms and would often say he wished he would have gotten out sooner, in the heat of the moment he always rode for ‘Sota. Where others snickered at it, Garnett embraced it. And the people loved him for it.\n\nHe went to Boston and won a championship with Paul Pierce and Ray Allen. Pierce was the face of that team. Allen provided the sizzle. But Garnett was the beating heart in the middle of it all. The Celtics probably would have won two had Garnett not suffered a knee injury the following season. In a franchise filled with legends, Garnett belongs right there with them, often credited for changing the tenor of that team with his maniacal practice habits and suffocating defense. His No. 5 jersey will be retired in Boston later this season, a legacy-cementing achievement for one of the greatest power forwards to ever do it.\n\nWolves fans won’t ever let him go. There was bad blood with Wolves owner Glen Taylor and tragedy when Flip Saunders passed away, but through all of the struggles that this franchise has endured, Garnett remains a shining beacon to their long-suffering fans. He could be demanding and biting behind the scenes, but that was the way for him to turn an unserious franchise into a team that commanded respect. And while so many players and coaches and executives came and went without paying this team, or this city, much mind, Garnett would never allow Minnesotans to feel inferior.\n\n“I left my spirit and my soul in there,” Garnett said then. “You can’t ever replace that. You feel me? That will always be, forever, as long as they have the Timberwolves in Minnesota.”\n\nTo this day, he is the franchise’s career leader in games played, minutes played, field goals made, scoring, rebounding, assists, steals, blocks, triple-doubles and win shares. But his legacy is so much more than his name at the top of a statistical category.\n\nTo root for Kevin Garnett was to root for Minnesota basketball itself. He proved that when it was done right, this sport didn’t have to take a back seat to hockey in this community. When this league was failing in this market, Garnett arrived to prove that basketball could flourish here. When Garnett prowled the Target Center hardwood, be it in the playoffs or when he made his triumphant return in the trade from Brooklyn, the arena was as loud and as rowdy as any other one in the league.\n\nKG huffed and he puffed and he blew that roof off. Here is hoping that one day, someway, somehow, he and the Timberwolves figure things out and he returns to hear that roar again.\n\nCareer NBA stats: G: 1,462, Pts.: 17.8, Reb.: 10.0, Ast.: 3.7, FG%: 49.7, FT%: 78.9, Win Shares: 191.4, PER: 22.7\n\nThe Athletic NBA 75 Panel points: 864 | Hollinger GOAT Points: 339.1\n\nAchievements: NBA MVP (’04), Nine-time All-NBA, 15-time All-Star, Defensive Player of the Year (’08), NBA champ (’08), Rebounding champ (’04, ’05, ’06, ’07), Hall of Fame (’20), NBA 75th Anniversary team (’21)\n\n(Illustration: Wes McCabe / The Athletic; Brian Babineau / NBAE via Getty Images)"
