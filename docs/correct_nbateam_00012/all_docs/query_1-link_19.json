        "text": "Kevin Garnett is considered among the greatest ever professional basketball players. He eschewed college and was drafted in the first round of the 1995 NBA Draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the 5th overall pick. He played with the Timberwolves from 1995-2007 when he was traded to the Boston Celtics.\n\nWith the Celtics, Garnett led them to the NBA title in 2008, the peak of his career. He played for the Celtics until 2013 when he was traded to the Brooklyn Nets although he finished his career in 2015/16 back with the T-Wolves.\n\nGarnett was a 6-11 (2.11) power forward who averaged 17.8 ppg and 10 rebounds/game for his NBA career. His individual honors are numerous. He was NBA MVP in 2004 and was a 15-time NBA All-Star, chosen as the MVP of the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. He was named All-NBA First Team four times, in 2000, 2004-04, and 2008; was on the Second Team in 2001-02 and 2005; and the Third Team in 1999 and 2007.\n\nRenowned for his defense, Garnett was NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2008 and was chosen nine times to the NBA All-Defensive First Team (2000-05, 2008-09, 2011) and three times was on the All-Defensive Second Team (2006-07 and 2012). Garnett led the NBA in rebounding four times, all consecutively, from 2004-07.\n\nGarnett was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame and his #5 was retired by the Boston Celtics.\n\nAfter retiring from the NBA, Garnett worked on the TNT crew of Inside the NBA on television. He also served as a consultant to the Milwaukee Bucks. Garnett also appeared in several movies, notably one entitled “Uncut Gems,” in which he played a fictionalized version of himself, which led to a deal for more movies with Village Roadshow Pictures."
