        "text": "By: Philip T.\n\nDo you watch sports on TV? If you do, did you see the first NBA playoff game between the Boston Celtics and the Miami Heat on Saturday, April 17th? That was a great game, but according to the article on April 19th 2010, there was a disturbing skirmish at the end of the game between, Celtic’s center, Kevin Garnett, and Miami Heat’s forward, Quentin Richardson.\n\nAccording to the article by Tom Withers in the Daily News, Joakim Noah, a Chicago Bulls center, was concerned about this situation as well. He said, “He‘s always swinging elbows, man. I’m hurting right now because of an elbow he threw. It’s unbelievable.” I have been in situations similar to this as well. When I am playing basketball and I make a good shot or am driving to the hoop, the player defending me or a player I might be defending may throw an elbow. Now an elbow isn’t just a body part. It is also a weapon depending on how you use it. If you get a really hard hit from an elbow, you can really be in some serious pain, or even unable to play for months, depending on where you are hit. This is probably why Joakim was complaining about it because Garnett is known for doing it and Joakim had a couple of painful experiences. Other NBA players in the same situation are either getting hurt from elbows or throwing them and getting caught.\n\nGarnett shouldn’t be allowed to be throwing elbows. The referees should watch the tapes more carefully and be aware of “sneaky violence” on the court, not only from Garnett, but any player. Suppose Kobe Bryant, Dwayne Wade, or LeBron James was to get whacked by an elbow in the face? Their teams will be in some serious problems, especially in the playoffs. As a result of this situation, Garnett got suspended for his actions for one game and Richardson was fined. As a veteran, Garnett should know what not to do, but as a veteran he knows what he can get away with. I am just upset that one of my favorite team players was hit by one of my least favorite team players. I am also concerned with the health of Quentin Richardson. He has lots of potential, and I hope this doesn’t jeopardize it.\n\nThis doesn’t just happen to NBA players or on TV. It happens where ever you engage in a physical sport. You should try your best to be careful and play fair and safe.\n\nPlayers like myself learn to play basketball many different ways. One way is by watching the NBA. Seeing guys like Garnett, Richardson, and Noah influence how we should play basketball. What I would do is learn from their mistakes, play as fair and as safe as possible, and encourage others to do the same."
