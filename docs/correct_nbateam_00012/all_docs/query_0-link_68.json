        "text": "The 2008 Boston Celtics were a highly successful basketball team that made a significant impact on the NBA. Coached by, the overrated, Doc Rivers, Boston consisted of Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen, forming a formidable “Big Three” that led the Celtics to their 17th NBA championship. The 2008 season marked a turning point for the Celtics franchise. After acquiring Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in the offseason, the team underwent a major transformation. The trio, along with Paul Pierce, formed a powerhouse lineup that showcased exceptional teamwork, defensive prowess, and offensive firepower and the concept of “ubuntu”. “Ubuntu” a Nguni Bantu word means “humanity” and is occasionally translated to “I am because we are”. It was the calling card for the Celtics team that won Banner 17. The Celtics tweeted out comments made by Kevin Garnett comparing them to comments made by the newest member of the Boston Celtics Jrue Holiday.\n\nWhile I understood what the message was, I didn’t and still don’t love Kevin Garnett and Jrue Holiday being compared. Are the 2023 Boston Celtics team channeling the 2008 team? Could Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Jrue Holiday be Pierce, Allen and Garnett? Sure but that’s a side topic. It did make me want to look back at the 2008 Boston Celtics team, a team that was around a lot in my past radio life and had it not been for a “credentialing issue” at the last minute, I would have been the onsite producer of record for Game 6 of the NBA Finals when the Celtics won their 17th NBA championship. Nope, not bitter at all about that.\n\nLed by their defensive-minded Associate Head Coach, Tom Thibodeau, the Celtics became known for their suffocating defense. Their ability to disrupt opponents’ offenses and force turnovers was THE key factor in their success. The team’s defensive anchor, Kevin Garnett, was instrumental in instilling a defensive mindset and setting the tone for the entire team. Garnett’s arrival in Boston brought a new level of intensity and defensive prowess to the Celtics. His impact on the team was immediate, as he averaged 18.8 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 3.4 assists per game during the regular season. His defensive presence and leadership on the court were instrumental in the Celtics’ success. Garnett was named the NBA’s defensive player of the year and should have been the 2007-08 regular season MVP.\n\nIn the playoffs, Garnett’s performance reached new heights. He elevated his game and showcased his versatility on both ends of the court. His ability to score, rebound, and defend at an elite level made him a force to be reckoned with. In the NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, Garnett’s impact was undeniable. He averaged 20.4 points, 11.7 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game.\n\nOffensively, the Celtics were a force to be reckoned with. Paul Pierce, known for his scoring ability and clutch performances, consistently delivered when it mattered most. Ray Allen, one of the greatest shooters in NBA history, provided a deadly outside threat, while Kevin Garnett’s versatility and mid-range shooting added another dimension to the team’s offense.\n\nPierce averaged 19.6 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game, taking a big step back from his numbers in previous seasons but still keeping his status as one of the league’s top players. It was in the playoffs where Pierce truly shined. In the NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, he displayed his clutch gene and determination. In Game 1, Pierce suffered a knee injury that forced him to be carried off the court in a wheelchair. This incident became one of the most memorable moments of the series. Remarkably, Pierce returned to the game and led the Celtics to victory, scoring 22 points.\n\nPierce’s performance throughout the series was exceptional. He averaged 21.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game, earning him the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player award.\n\nNot enough people talk about the importance of Ray Allen to the Celtics. If Ray Allen doesn’t ask out of Seattle and doesn’t get traded to the Celtics, Kevin Garnett doesn’t get traded to the Celtics soon after. On the court, Ray Allen sacrificed his numbers from past seasons as well. Allen averaged 17.4 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 3.1 assists per game, Allen’s ability to stretch the floor and knock down three-pointers made him a valuable asset to the Celtics’ offense.\n\nDuring the playoffs, Allen’s contributions became even more evident. In the NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, he consistently delivered clutch performances. In Game 2, Allen set an NBA Finals record by making eight three-pointers, finishing the game with 32 points. Throughout the series, Allen continued to excel, averaging 20.3 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 2.5 assists per game. His ability to create scoring opportunities for himself and his teammates made him a key factor in the Celtics’ championship run.\n\nRajon Rondo emerged as one of the league’s premier point guards in the 2008 season. He averaged 10.6 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game, showcasing his ability to contribute in multiple facets of the game. More importantly than the numbers, Rondo had to deal with all of the mouths to feed on the offensive side of the basketball. In the post season, Rondo’s ability to control the tempo of the game and make precise passes made him a valuable asset for the Celtics. In the NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, Rondo’s performance was instrumental in securing the championship. He averaged 13.6 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 6.7 assists per game.\n\nPJ Brown’s impact on the 2008 Boston Celtics cannot be understated. While his playing time may have been limited, his contributions on both ends of the court and his leadership qualities were crucial to the team’s championship-winning season. Brown’s professionalism and team-first mentality made him a respected figure within the organization, and his presence will be remembered as an important part of the Celtics’ success in 2008. His defensive intensity and ability to contest shots were instrumental in the team’s success. While Paul Pierce and LeBron James were dueling in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, it was PJ Brown, who hit the final field goal of the game.\n\nThe 2008 Boston Celtics were a dominant force in the NBA, showcasing exceptional teamwork, suffocating defense, and offensive firepower. Led by their “Big Three” of Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen, the Celtics captured their 17th NBA championship and left a lasting impact on the league. Their success serves as a reminder of the power of teamwork and selflessness in achieving greatness in basketball. “Ubuntu”\n\nJames Stewart is the Executive Producer of the Felger and Massarotti radio program.
