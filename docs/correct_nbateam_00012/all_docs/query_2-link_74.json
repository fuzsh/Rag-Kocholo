        "text": "This is my dream...\n\nThat there'll be no such thing as superstar\n\nOnly team\n\nThat pride will be measured in games won\n\nNot shots taken\n\nThat the sport will be for guys in uniforms\n\nNot guys in three-piece suits\n\nThat there'll be less playa hatin'\n\nAnd more love for the game\n\nThis is my dream today\n\n-Kevin Garnett, AND1 spot, 2001\n\nTuesday, May 19, 2008, 4:23pm ET ----- 33\n\nSunday's Game 7 loss was tough to swallow. It seemed like we just ran out of gas, and our weary legs and bodies finally caught up to us, as we couldn't withstand the Orlando Magic runs in the fourth quarter, our defense a shadow of its former self.\n\nWe pretty much got as far as most people thought we would -- second round, on the verge of the Conference Finals. But considering that we were up 3-2 in this series, and had a 10-point lead in Game 6, losing this series was tough.\n\nWithout Kevin, this year's Playoffs wasn't a real title defense. We also lost Leon Powe to that torn ACL (man, gotta fee bad for him). But on the bright side, Rajon Rondo took him game to a whole new level in these Playoffs, and he's fast becoming one of the best PGs in this league (and one of my favorite players). Big Baby stepped up huge in the second round, including the fantastic game winner at the buzzer in Game 5 (we NEED to re-sign him this offseason). Eddie House can be counted on time and time again to light it up from the bench. Perk actually did a decent job on Dwight Howard for most of the series, pushing him as far out from the basket as possible.\n\nThe EPIC first round against the Bulls is definitely something to talk about. It was one of the most entertaining, thrilling, and stressful series I've ever seen. A record seven overtime periods spanning across a full seven games, players hitting clutch shot after clutch shot, an insane amound of lead changes and ties. Ray Allen's 51-point game in Game 6 was something to behold (too bad we lost that game in triple-OT).\n\nI'm really bummed out that the Celtics are knocked out. I'm actually gonna miss watching this team play and scrap. It's obviously not the same team without KG, but I really enjoy watching the way we play. This team has really made something of itself. So the next few months without Celtics basketball will pass by really slowly...\n\nNow we look to next year, and hope that KG returns 100%. We'll be another year older, but a healthy core means that we still have a title-contending team, especially with an much-improved Rondo.\n\nToday is Kevin Garnett's 33rd birthday. And it's also the 5-year anniversary of his monumental Game 7 performance against the Kings during Round 2 of the 2004 Playoffs. He lead the Timberwolves to a victory with a monster performance: 32 points, 21 rebounds, 2 assists, 5 blocks, and 4 steals in 46 minutes. I can still remember that game as if it was yesterday. But at the same time, it feels like a lifetime ago.\n\nLastly, I received the notice that GeoCities will be shutting down later this year -- meaning that this website will surely go down with it. But don't worry, I think I'll move to BlogSpot or something. And of course, I'll still be active on YouTube, making mixes and posting KG videos. And I'm now on Twitter, so feel free to follow me. But it saddens me to know that I will lose this site. I definitely need to archive all my entries, posts, and writings from the past eight years. It's been a great run on this space. Thank you all for sharing it with me.\n\nSaturday, April 18, 2008, 12:29pm ET ----- Put Ya Dukes Up\n\nIt is what it is.\n\nWe're heading into these Playoffs without Kevin Garnett, the heart of this team, the emotional leader, the defensive anchor. Things aren't looking good. Round 1 against the Bulls -- which is about to start as I type this, and Kevin Garnett is making a rare apperance on the sidelines, looking pissed -- should be fine for us. It's the later rounds, likely Orlando in Round 2, and (if we make it that far) Cleveland in the Conference Finals. And if we somehow get past Cleveland, you know who will be the likely Western Conference finalist.\n\nSo things don't look good. But we can't hang out heads. We're still the defending champs, so we gotta look at it like, \"Everything goes through us, we ain't conceding anything.\"\n\nI know I haven't updated this site/blog in a while, I guess I've been more active on YouTube. So much has happened since I last wrote an entry... We raced out to the best 29-game start in NBA history (27-2), then we struggled in as December turned into January, Cleveland and LA overtook us in the standings, Tony Allen was out, Scalabrine was out, Leon Powe was out, we signed Stephon Marbury (who still hasn't played a minute together with KG this year), we had to fend off Orlando for the second seed late in the season.\n\nSince February 19th in Utah, KG's injury has definitely gotten me down, and I'd been just waiting for the Playoffs and for him to come back. He made his return in late March, playing very limited minutes in four games, not moving particular well but shot the ball really great. But the Celtics decided to shelve him until the last couple of games after seeing him struggle in Orlando on March 25th. As the season wound down, he never made it back. And when the news broke on Thursday that KG would likely be out for the entire Playoffs, I felt sick to my stomach.\n\nIt's absolutely surreal seeing KG injured. He's been so durable for all of his career, it's disturbing to see him on the sidelines. Mortality catches up to even the best of us. The injury itself was kind of freaky as well -- he just went up for an alley-oop in that Utah game, totally untouched, and strained a muscle behind his right knee. It was hard to watch.\n\nBut there's nothing we can do. We'll just have to suck it up and find another way to win these Playoff games. One series at a time, one game at a time.\n\nStarting with the Bulls, led by their super-rookie Derrick Rose. The Rondo-Rose match-up is gonna be hot -- both players are putting up buckets right now in the first quarter.\n\nLet's go C's.\n\nSaturday, December 20, 2008, 6:34pm ET ----- And The Beat Goes On\n\nGeocities was acting up a bit, so I couldn't update as consistently as I wanted. A lot has happened since my last entry. For one thing, we haven't lost in 17 games. That's right, we've strung together 17 straight wins -- over a lot of quality teams (Detroit, Orlando, Portland, New Orleans, Utah, Atlanta, etc). It's tough, because each night every team is giving us their best shot, trying to take us down. So our focus has been tremendous.\n\nThis is the longest winning streak of Kevin Garnett's professional career. His previous high was 11 straight with the Timberwolves back in the 2000-2001 season. Seventing and counting -- it's a great thing, but we need to continue to take it one game at a time. I know that sounds cliched, but that's how we got to roll. Never look beyond the next game. Just stay focused on the task at hand. And it's been a total team effort.\n\nRay Allen is shooting the ball incredibly well (49.3% from the field, 38.9% from downtown, and 91.6% from the line) and is currently leading the team with 18.8 points per game.\n\nPaul Pierce isn't shooting particular well from the field, but he's a HUGE shotmaker when it counts. He takes big shots and he makes big shots. He's got so many moves and so many ways to get shots up, it's just a relief knowing that he's out there doing the heavy lifting.\n\nKG's points are down this season (16.5 currently), but who cares. I don't even care how many points he scores these days -- he doesn't need to carry that scoring load like he did in those Timberwolves days. It doesn't mean he's lost a step or anything, or that he can't do it anymore. It's just that he doesn't need to, and that he's playing far less minutes (32.9) and getting less touches as a Celtic. There are games where he doesn't even play the entire fourth quarter because the Celtics have comfortable leads.\n\nAnd that's ideal, because on any given night, Paul Pierce can go off, Ray Allen can go off, even Rondo and Perk. Off the bench, we've got firepower and solid contributions from Leon Powe, Eddie House, Tony Allen, Scalabrine, Big Baby. KG knows his role now, and it's fluid one. Every night, the C's need his rebounding, shotblocking-altering, intensity, and leadership. Some nights, they might not need him to score all that much. But when they do need it, he's got it.\n\nCase in point, the Hawks game in Atlanta on Wednesday the 17th. The Hawks were pushing hard, and were right there. KG turned it on in the fourth quarter, hitting all five of his shots for 10 points, a couple of them really clutch down the stretch, y'know I mean. That was a great game, by the way. It felt like a Playoff game.\n\nEveryone else is doing their thing too, to help the team win. Rondo's had his first career triple double (a brilliant 16 points, 13 rebounds, 17 assists, 3 steals performance against the Pacers on Dec 3rd), and a new career high (against Utah on Dec 15th). In fact, Rondo is doing everything he's supposed to be doing and more -- he took just three shots yesterday to finish with 4 points, but dished out 15 assists and ripped 4 steals -- people are starting to whisper \"All-Star.\"\n\nPerk is averaging 9.0 points and 8.4 rebounds, 1.8 blocks -- all career highs. Tony Allen, Leon Powe, Eddie House, Glen Davis -- everyone producing and filling a role. Our second unit is often counted on to hold on leads, and those are good tests.\n\nThe state of the team looks great right now. But it's still only December, and the season is long. I don't really want to look to 70 wins as a goal -- because it isn't. Our goal is the second consecutive championship. If we win 70 games, or tie the Bulls record 72-wins, or finish with single digit in losses (73-9) -- great. But that ain't what we're playing for. We need to win in April, May and June.\n\nBy the way, I was reading SI.com today, and Ian Thomsen had this to say about KG, and it rings true to me:\n\nBefore Garnett came to Boston, he was criticized -- by former players-turned-broadcasters especially -- for his failure to carry the Minnesota Timberwolves offensively in the closing minutes of tight playoff games. But it was always unfair and off the mark to assume that Garnett should have done it the way of Jordan (who, by the way, was surrounded by more talented support in Chicago than Garnett ever received in Minnesota). There are all kinds of ways to lead a team. Jordan did so as a scorer, a finisher; Garnett has always been a creator, a team-first defender who would be at his best offensively in the company of top scorers. (Here's another aside: It is easier to find stars to score than it is to find someone like Garnett.)\n\n\"What you see in Kevin is the same greatness as you saw in a Russell,\" [Doc] Rivers said. \"He understood early on, even before he had the horses with him, that he couldn't do it by himself. And then when you gave him those horses, his greatness stood out. He was never going to be the greatest scorer in the NBA because he was so driven to play for the team. He made the unselfish plays, the right pass all the time, and because his teams [in Minnesota] weren't good enough, he got criticized for making the right plays. Now he makes the right plays to Paul [Pierce] and Ray [Allen] -- who are wide open and making shots -- and now that makes Kevin great. But it's the same thing he's always done.\"\n\nThe NBA has been interesting this season, especially the past month. Three teams -- Celtics, Cavaliers, Lakers -- are clearly head and shoulders above everone else. A lot of coaches fired -- six so far, I think. The Raptors are really underachieving, I have no idea how they lost to the Thunder last night. Detroit is still trying to figure out how to utlize AI. The Suns traded away Bell and Diaw for J-Rich. Elton Brand is out for a month. Brandon Roy dropped 52 the other day. Melo dropped 33 in a quarter recently, tying the NBA record. Everyone all of sudden loves Dwyane Wade again (funny how fickle the media and some fans are -- if you're injured, people literally forget about you as quickly as they propped you up when you were their darling). Stephon Marbury and the Knicks saga is just a sad sad one. Both Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt attended Celtics games (Bolt's favorite player is Kevin Garnett, that's whassup). Posey was welcomed back at the Garden and received his much deserved ring.\n\nLeBron James and the Cavs are scary scary -- their defense is elite this season, on par with what the Celtics are doing. The Celtics are at a league-leading 25-2, but the Cavs are right there are 22-4. The Lakers are also ight there are 21-4. Chris Paul just broke the NBA record for most consecutive games with at least a steal (106, breaking Alvin Robertson's previous 105). For some perspective, Rajon Rondo is currently second among active players -- I think he's at 26 or something.\n\nDamn it's been crazy, and it's still only December. Well, lots of basketball to be played and enjoyed. I know y'all are anticipating the Christmas Day match-up between the Celtics and the Lakers. I'm looking forward to it.\n\nHappy Holidays y'all. Be safe.\n\nFriday, November 21, 2008, 10:29am ET ----- Homecoming\n\nI will never trash the Minnesota Timberwolves. There are so many beautiful memories there, so many stories, so many ups and downs, and so many character-building and defining moments.\n\nSo much history.\n\nBut all that can only be seen in the rearview mirror. Things have changed, for everyone. People went in opposite directions -- KG and his new teammates capitalized on their opportunity to go straight to the NBA mountain-top, while the Timberwolves lost their heart and soul and plunged straight into the NBA basement. The Minnesota Timberwolves are virtually unrecognizable from what I knew. New players, new personnel, new uniforms, new logo, new floors, and poor basketball. Well, Kevin McHale is still there, calling the same old shots. Just barely a month into the season, his Mayo-Love trade looks really really horrible. Mayo is currently leading all rookies in scoring at 20.1 points.\n\nPerhaps some things never change.\n\nTonight, Kevin Garnett will play against the Timberwolves in Minnesota for the first time in his career. Last season, he missed the February 8th game because of an abdominal strain -- suffered during an earlier game against the Timberwolves in Boston, ironically. He did make a pregame appearance that night, to that memorable standing ovation and appreciation from the Target Center crowd. He waved, smiled sheepishly, and retreated back to the locker room to watch the game.\n\nThis season, he returns healthy. And he also returns having won an NBA championship this past June, something that eluded him as a Timberwolf, something that seemed impossible and unattainable a year and a half ago.\n\n\"Other than being able to sleep in my own bed, it should be cool,\" KG said after the Celtics beat the Pistons last night to improve to a East-leading 11-2. \"It's always good to go back and see my own personal friends in Minneapolis. It's good to see the fans and people that have always been good to me. Other than that, it's just another game, to be honest. I was locked in tonight and I'll be locked in tomorrow, so it should be fun.\"\n\nHe spent 12 seasons locking in at the Target Center, and made Minneapolis his own. From young phenom to all-star, from all-star to NBA elite, from NBA elite to MVP, from MVP to forging an unforgettable Timberwolf career. He is the Timberwolves' all-time leader in points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals. But more than that, his work ethic and effort were off the charts, his intensity and fire never wavered, and his loyalty and dedication never faltered. He was an unselfish team-player on the court, he was active in the community, he carried himself well and never got into trouble or embarrassed the franchise. He was real, genuine, and he represented everything that was good about the organization. He was their rock, their touchstone, their hero.\n\nAnd in so many ways, he is now their champion too.\n\nFans in Minnesota care about Kevin Garnett. They're proud of him, not just of his 12-years in Minnesota, but also of what he achieved last season in Boston. In so many ways, his triumph is their triumph.\n\nAnd tonight, he returns triumphant. Certified. You know it's gonna be all love at the Target Center. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they end up cheering for the Celtics instead of the Timberwolves.\n\nBecause for this one night, Kevin Garnett and the Celtics represent them.\n\nWednesday, November 12, 2008, 10:27pm ET ----- Ice Water\n\nPAUL PIERCE!!!!!!!\n\nWednesday, November 12, 2008, 12:14pm ET ----- KG and Calderon\n\nThere's been a lot of fallout since the Kevin Garnett and Jose Calderon incident. I posted the video on YouTube of KG clapping and pointing a finger in Calderon's face, and talking smack to him during the Celtics-Raptors game on Monday.\n\nAnd that clip became one of the most viewed videos yesterday, in Spain. It seems like all the fans from Spain searched \"calderon garnett\" on Youtube and were looking to hate on KG. Now, I can understand why they would be upset, and I can understand why they would point out that KG did something similar to Pau Gasol many years ago -- and I can understand why they could then conclude that KG has something against Spanish players.\n\nBut it makes me wonder if they're just commenting because they heard about it, blowing it out of proportion when they know nothing about Kevin Garnett. Anyone who's followed the NBA for the past, say 10 years, would know that KG will talk trash to anybody and everybody. Don't matter who you are, how big you are, or where you're from. Hell, he is known to talk to and curse at himself during games. He talks to his teammates, to coaches, and sometimes to no one in particular. He got into with Tim Duncan in 1999 during the first round of the Playoffs. He got into with with Will Bynum on Sunday (Bynum got him GOOD on that play, though).\n\nThat's simply his way of hyping himself up, of heightening the stakes and tension. Nothing personal. Some players can't talk and play at the same time. KG has been doing both for years, and if he can throw you off your game by getting inside your head, he will. He's gonna let you know that this is his house, this is his shine, and you're gonna have your work cut out for you.\n\nBelieve me, Kevin Garnett knows that Calderon is one of the most potent and dangerous point guards in the league today. Otherwise he wouldn't waste his breath talking to him. It's just gamesmanship.\n\nNow, I DO think that clapping and pointing in Calderon's face was a bit excessive, and definitely warranted a technical. It's good gamesmanship, but not great sportsmanship. That's why I was surprised that the referees didn't blow the whistle. To be fair, none of us knows what was actually said between Calderon and Garnett that lead up to the exchange. And for all intents and purposes, clapping and finger-pointing is no different from Jordan staring someone down after a dunk, or Gary Payton talking about someone's momma, or Mutombo wagging his finger. But definitely, a tech should've been called on KG. And everyone would move on. No biggie.\n\nIn other words, the incident was hardly a big deal, and it was just a part of the game which is both mental and physical. It's definitely not the issue that these angry Calderon fans make it out to be (by the way, I am a Calderon fan myself, and a Raptors fan). It's amusing to me how these fans act all surprised and indignant when KG says something now, when five years ago no one gave a damn. It's funny how winning a championship and playing in a big market suddenly make you visible and relevant.\n\nThat is the world of YouTube, I suppose, when anybody can hide behind a computer and type anything they want. It's amusing to me how little some of these people actually know about basketball, and how they're reacting to something without the full context. They act all indignant, cry foul, talk about the lack of professionalism in the NBA, and then proceed to type like a twelve-year-old and hurl four-letter words.\n\nThere are comments attacking either Garnett or Calderon, most of which are hatin on KG. I have deleted a lot of racist and stupid comments directed at KG. I don't mind if someone wants to criticize him, and wants to have a genuine discussion on the incident -- but I will simply delete any racist comments. It takes me one button and less than a second to delete a message, so you're wasting your time if you type that nonsense out.\n\nTuesday, November 11, 2008, 12:33am ET ----- Great Week\n\nGREAT game earlier tonight against the Raptors. Man, that was an awesome game with some real Playoff intensity.\n\nIn my view, that was our defining game of this young season so far -- more so than the Pistons game on Sunday (which was a big win as well). It was like we turned it up once the Raptors pushed us. We trailed by as many as 16 points, and for a while it looked like we were being bullied around as we settled for jumpshot after jumpshot. Then it was as if we woke up, realizing who we were and how we were supposed to play. The Big 3 all locked in, and finished in a big way.\n\nPaul Pierce, especially, came up huge in the fourth quarter. He scored 22 of his 36 points in that quarter... bucket after bucket, hitting 7-9, including consecutive three-pointers. 22 points in a quarter! He played about 45 and a half minutes total, barely getting any rest. He also had 9 rebounds and 4 assists.\n\nKevin Garnett finished with his first 20-10 game of the season, registering 21 points, 10 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 block. He hit some key shots to lead our second-half comeback charge, and got the Garden up when he started trash-talking Calderon. If anyone is wondering if KG is more chill now that he has a ring, they ought to ask Jose Calderon (who, by the way, didn't back down -- I'm a fan of Calderon, so I respect him).\n\nRay Allen also gave us a much needed lift, despite not shooting well. He had 19 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 steal. He hit all eight of his freethrows, and hit a big three-pointer with 3:02 left to tie the game at 84.\n\nIt was a terrific, exciting game to watch. The sense of urgency has not been diminished by our championship. Only eight games into the season, the stakes and desire to win are as high as ever. Our bench usually gives us a boost -- and often even bailing us out of our poor starts, like in the Pistons game -- but tonight we needed the Big Three to take charge. It was an excellent win against a division rival.\n\nSpeaking of rivals... that Pistons game was a good win too. You knew going in that the Palace was going to be fired up, because it was Iverson's first home game as a Piston, and because the Celtics were in the house. So I was expecting a tough, tough game. But it looked like the Pistons would need some time to get Iverson comfortable with his new teammates and develop chemistry.\n\nTony Allen played amazing in that game, off the bench: 23 points on 11-16 shooting, in just 28 minutes. Talk about efficiency and making an impact. Great performance.\n\nLeone Powe has had a string of great games too. He's definitely been a strong factor for us off the bench.\n\nSo tonight notwithstanding, our bench play has been a big part of our 7-1 start. Tony Allen, Leon Powe, Eddie House, and Glen Davis have more than held their own. Props to them.\n\nWe've now won five straight after the hiccup in Indiana. We're back on track, and currently have the most wins in the league at 7-1, but still trail the East-leading Atlanta Hawks. Yes, the Hawks are a perfect 5-0 right now. Maybe that seven-game first round series last season wasn't a fluke -- maybe they are actually good. But realistically, I don't see them staying at the top of the conference standings very long.\n\nThe best news of last week was of course off the court. The U.S. has a new President-Elect. Obama!!! What a beautiful, historic night November 4th was -- Celtics beat the Rockets that night, too, haha -- and I'm sure that years down the road, everyone will remember where they were and what they were doing on the night Barack Obama made history.\n\nSaturday, November 1, 2008, 11:12am ET ----- 1,000\n\nKevin Garnett played in his 1,000th (regular season) game last night, becoming the youngest player in NBA history to reach that mark, at 32 years and 165 days. The previous record was held by Shawn Kemp at 33 years and 24 days, set on December 20, 2002.\n\nNote that Kobe Bryant is at 868, and assuming he stays healthy for the next 132 games, he will become the youngest to 1,000 at just past the midway mark of next season (but only because he was younger in his rookie season than KG was in his). And it's possible that, currently at 393 games, a healthy LeBron James will break that record again years down the road (he has the benefit of not having the lockout season on his resume).\n\nBut for now, it's your boy Kevin Garnett. In other words, KG has played more games than anyone in history at this age. A lot of mileage. A lot of minutes. A lot of blood, sweat, and tears.\n\nOf course, coming straight out of high school and entering the league at 19 and a half had a lot to do with it (Kobe was 18 when he began his rookie season). But it's also a testament to KG's durability, longevity, conditioning, and committment to taking care of his body and playing through injuries. Knock on wood, of course. Luck has also played a role -- KG has been very fortunate to not have been seriously injured at any point in his career. Every night you suit up in the NBA, there's a chance of you coming down on someone's foot, landing wrong, dislocating something, tearing something, breaking something -- it's a risk each and every game. Luckily, through good fortune and good personal training/diet regimen, Kevin Garnett has stayed relatively healthy throughout his career. Knock on wood again. Let's hope it stays that way.\n\n\"It feels crazy, to be honest.\" Garnett said after the game. \"Some players come in here, Paul and I along with other teammates, and sit on the back of the bus and talk about Nike camps, people we grew up with, playing against and playing with, and how unfortunately they're not in the league. So to sit here and have a plateau of over 1,000 games says a lot not only about my conditioning, but, through knocking on wood countless times, taking care of my body and trying to be the best player that I can be. ... I've always taken a lot of pride in playing games and never taking games off. I have exceeded a lot of the personal goals I have set for myself and I'm just enjoying this team, enjoying this year, and enjoying everyday that I can get up and play this game full strength.\"\n\nHis personal stats after 1,000?\n\n20.407 points, 11.213 rebounds (2.708 offensive, 8.505 defensive), 4.395 assists, 1.666 blocks, 1.386 steals, 2.530 turnovers, 2.521 fouls, and 37.926 minutes per game.\n\nHis shooting averages are 49.428% (8121-16430) from the field, 28.374% (164-578) from downtown, and 78.068% (4001-5125) from the foul line.\n\nAnd he's got lots to show for those numbers too. 2002-2003 All-Star MVP. 2003-2004 league MVP. 2007-2008 Defensive Player of the Year. And most importantly, 2007-2008 NBA Champion.\n\nA successful and complete career, yes. And now he's hunting for MORE rings, looking to repeat, looking to carry his Celtics team to a couple more titles and to cement the squad as one of the greatest in Celtics history.\n\nIn other words, for Kevin Garnett, it's business as usual. That's what fans love about this guy -- he gives it his all no matter what. Don't matter if it's a practice scrimmage or an exhibition game. Don't matter if it's Game 6 of the NBA Finals or an insignifant second game of the season against the Bulls on Halloween. Kevin Garnett's intensity never drops.\n\nHe gave two great interviews recently. Check 'em out:\n\n• NBA.com Interview with John Schuhmann\n\n• SI.com Interview with Arash Markazi\n\nSo, did y'all see last night game against the Bulls? It was a blowout win in the fourth quarter, and KG was every bit as intense on the bench, cheering for his teammates, arguing bad calls, and involving himself with the flow of the game and spirit of the crowd. He sat out the entire fourth quarter, and played just 26 minutes for the game. He dropped 18 points, 10 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 block, and 2 steals in a 96-80 Celtic victory.\n\nWe played great D as a team, holding the Bulls to 29.8% shooting. We forced 20 turnovers, but had 20 ourselvs... That's too many TOs. I think last season we were 27th in the league in that department, so we need to clean that up.\n\nI love how Rondo plays. He attacks the defense, and gets knocked down like five times per game. He's not shy, though, and that's good. But I do wince every time I see him get hammered and has to be scrapped off the floor. Rondo does need to improve his freethrow shooting and his jumpshot. Something to work on.\n\n2-0.\n\nWe're in Indiana tonight for our first road game of the season. Let's run this.\n\nWednesday, October 29, 2008, 3:29pm ET ----- Ring Night\n\nThem rings look good. Real good. The emerald shamrock, that's tight.\n\nOther than getting our first win of the new season, the highlight from last night was of course the ring ceremony and the raising of Banner 17. Kevin Garnett finally got his ring, it's been a long time coming. Paul Pierce got really emotional, and it was just a special moment for everyone on the Celtics. They all worked so hard, and they deserve that moment.\n\nIt's awesome to see everyone again, more than four months since June 17th, which in some ways still seems just like yesterday. But here we are, end of October, start of the new season, and we're trying to climb that mountain again.\n\nAnd after watching the game last night, we have plenty of climbing to do. We started off poorly against the Cavs, probably still emotional from the ceremony just moments earlier. But we got our act together, and locked down the Cavaliers in the second half with our trademark defense.\n\nOne win down, 97 more to go.\n\nThe Darius Miles experiment didn't work out, so we had to waive him to trim down our roster. I don't quite know the reason behind that decision, other than the fact that he didn't produce during the preseason. But everyone had good things to say about his attitude.\n\nAnd without Posey this year, we need our young guys to step up and play a bigger role. They did just that last night. Leon Powe, if he keeps this up -- 13 points, 5-7 shooting, a couple of nasty dunks -- is gonna be a crucial piece of the puzzle for us this year. Tony Allen, compared to last season, looks much more confident and aggressive in his drives. I expect Tony and Leon to play key parts in our rotation this year.\n\nPaul Pierce, who came into training camp leaner and quicker than last season, looked in mid-season form already, dropping 27 points on 10-19 shooting. KG and Ray struggled with their shots (5-15 and 2-9, respectively), but Paul was on.\n\nI've been following some of the opening week coverage, and I noticed that a lot of commentators are looking past us, or are hesitant to say \"repeat.\" When asked who will come of the East, they point to Cleveland with the Mo Williams addition, they point to Detroit with a new coch and an intact nucleus. Then they look at other possibilities like Philly and Toronto who have new major pieces. They seem to not want to go with the obvious pick -- which is the defending champ.\n\nThat's fine. I think that the slight is good for us, because we need to stay hungry and show everyone that we are the champs and this is our throne. We ain't moving. So we have a lot to prove, and that chip on our shoulder should work in our favor.\n\nSo here we go. The journey begins anew. New season, same goal. Ubuntu.\n\nAnd..... Obama '08!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nTuesday, September 30, 2008, 1:20pm ET ----- The Defending Champs\n\n\"I don't think you just wake up and when you win, you're a champion. That starts with the mentality of how you think. It's just not validated by having the Larry O'Brien in my living room. A true champion starts from within with your heart, the way you go at it, the way you see it, the way you compete.\"\n\nWord. That's some real talk from a champ.\n\nAnd on that note, welcome back y'all. Doesn't that sound nice -- KG the defending champ. That's where it's at. That's whassup.\n\nMedia Day was yesterday, and it's great to see everyone back in uniform, ready for another championship run. It's a new mission, but the same goal. The prospects of repeating is very real, and we're gonna try our best to capitalize on it. Kevin Garnett knows it. Just because he now has a championship doesn't mean he's going to take it any easier now. He and the rest of the Celtics are just as hungry. Once you get that championship taste, you don't ever want to lose it.\n\n\"You don't get to a level and then take a step backward,\" KG said. \"One thing about this group that we have, we're very competitive. Obviously this year's no different.\n\nNo doubt, we all know how Kevin Garnett operates -- this guy goes at it 100% all the time. Doesn't matter if it's pick-up, practice, preseason, regular season, Playoffs, or Finals -- he's gonna bring it.\n\n\"We're about to get everybody's best,\" said KG. \"But everybody has to know that we're coming with our best, too. I'm looking forward to this year. You win it. You set a goal. I'm pretty sure people are looking at us as the pinnacle, on top of the hill. It's only right. I've been in that other position. I've been motivated. You have to anticipate that.\"\n\nOur approach this year shouldn't be too much different from last year's. All of last season, we had high expectations placed on us and we had a massive bullseye on our back. Same thing going into this season. Ain't nothing's changed, except this time we're gonna run this as champs.\n\nBy the way, everyone circle November 21st on your calendars. Yeah. That will be CRAZY. He went to Minnesota as The Kid, left as The Man, and will return as The Champion. It should be all love on that night, everyone in Minnesota should be proud of Kevin Garnett. The hero returns. Certified.\n\nSo as we all know, the major personnel change is the loss of Posey. KG knows what's like to lose teammates. \"It's hard,\" he said. \"You can understand the business side. Pose has things he still wants to accomplish in this league and you can't ever be upset with that. But the thing I learned when Steph left is that everyone has a different vision for themselves and what they want for themselves. You have to respect that as a man. That's how I feel about Pose. Pose is a big part of us with his knowledge, what he knew and his experience. You have to wish him the best and know that you've made a friend. At the end of the day, I will have him as a friend and we will forever be connected by the '08 championship in Boston.\"\n\nStill, that's a void we're gonna have to deal with. Darius Miles is an intriguing, low risk pick-up. Should be interesting. Other than that, our championship core is intact. KG, Pierce, and Ray are not getting any younger, but are still in their prime and are still very hungry. Rondo is now entering his third year, and he's gotta have a world of confidence -- he's also gotten bigger and stronger, adding eight pounds upto 181. Eddie House is back. Tony Allen is looking forward to a healthy season. Sam Cassell just signed a one-year guaranteed contract. Kendrick Perkins and Glen Davis are getting better and better.\n\nThe beautiful thing is that, no matter how this season plays out, no one can take away what Kevin Garnett and his teammates achieved last season. No one can take way what Kevin Garnett has accomplished in his career and in his life. He will be forever remembered as both a great player and and champion.\n\nAnd it is in that spirit that I made some new KG mixes in the past month. I've really enjoyed making them, trying to improve, and just having fun. At the same time, I put a lot of effort into them, and I hope KG fans enjoy watching them as muich as I enjoy making them. Here are the latest ones I made in the past month or so.\n\n• Celtics 2007-2008 Mix: Ubuntu\n\n• Dunk Mix 1: Weapon X (Video no longer available due to music copyright issues)\n\n• Dunk Mix 2: Eternal Flight\n\n• Block Mix: Enter The Dragon\n\n• Shots Mix: Lethal\n\n• Pictorial Mix: In My Lifetime\n\nI gotta say thanks to all the people who took the time to comment on the mixes, I appreciate all the kind words.\n\nGo Celtics. Here's to another successful championship run. Instead of the word \"repeat,\" Celtics managing partner Stephen Pagliuca has come up with \"Two-buntu\" as this year's mantra. Hey, we can roll with that.\n\nMonday, August 25, 2008, 3:52pm ET ----- Olympic Thoughts\n\nSo the Olympics are over, and I'm already suffering some withdrawals. As a huge track fan, the Beijing Games being over is not really a big deal because there's still another half to go in the 2008 season. But there's nothing quite like the sheer scale and spectacle of the Olympics.\n\nI have great, indelible memories of every Olympics that I watched -- Atlanta 1996 (Donovan Bailey, Michael Johnson), Sydney 2000 (Kevin Garnett that's whassup! Maurice Green, and I'm trying to forget Marion), Athens 2004 (Michael Phelps, Jeremy Wariner, Lauryn Williams, Allyson Felix), and now Beijing 2008.\n\nI hope y'all watched this year's Olympics too. This has been an incredible Olympic games. I definitely caught every minute of it. Michael Phelps was the face and megastar of the first week of the games, and Usain Bolt was took over the second week of the Olympics. But throughout the 16 days, there were amazing and memorable performances all around.\n\nMy girl Sanya Richards had an unfortunate 400m Final. She had the race won with about 100m to go, but a late hamstring tweak meant she couldn't fully cycle through her right leg, and she couldn't hold off Ohuruogu and Williams. Bronze is still pretty good, though. And she's a champion in my eyes. And hey, her anchor run in the 4x400m Final was absolutely beautiful. I love it.\n\nLolo Jones was another heavy favorite who came up short. I feel so bad for her, because this was supposed to have been her moment. And to hit the second last hurdle in the Final, to see her lead and dream evaporate in an instant, was horrifying. But it was how she carried herself afterwards that was so inspirational. She had so much class, grace, and respect for her competitors -- and it speaks volumes of who she is.\n\nAll the other events had their drama, twists and turns -- basketball, swimming, gymnastics, volleyball, etc. Lots of stories, intrigues, and memories throughout these games. So here are some of my musings of the 2008 Beijing Olympics:\n\n• Basketball is HUGE in China. I get the feeling that if Kobe Bryant and Liu Xiang got off a bus in China, all the fans would flock to Kobe for an autograph.\n\n• The Redeem Team got it done. Now let's see how well these cats hold up on their respective teams... come May during the Playoffs. Actually, guys like Pau Gasol and Manu Ginobili might burn out faster, consider all the heavy lifting they've done for their respective national teams. Stars on the USA squad had it easy.\n\n• No question, Michael Phelps was the face of these games. Eight for eight, seven world records. And he did all this under a grueling schedule, media scrutiny, and with every Olympic calibre swimmer gunning for him. This guy is a champion.\n\n• Dara Torres was inpirational. She should do London. If you can do this at the elite level at 41, why can't you do it at 45.\n\n• Poor Alicia Sacramone. Tood bad about what happened in the Team Final. And she got robbed in the Vault Final.\n\n• Nastia Liukin and Shawn Johnson were terrific.\n\n• China fielded eight-year-olds gymnasts, and hoped no one would notice.\n\n• That was a hurdling clinic put on by Dayron Robles. What a machine.\n\n• Poor Liu Xiang, couldn't stay healthy enough to defend his title in from his home country. And we were deprived of an epic showdown between him and Robles.\n\n• Jamaica performed superbly this year in the sprints. I do feel bad for Asafa, though... having dominated smaller meets yet never winning anything major. The stigma of choker -- fair or unfair -- must be affecting him mentally. He's a good guy, though, and I'm glad he got a gold medal in the 4x100m.\n\n• Michael Johnson's live reaction to Usain Bolt breaking his world record said it all. The first time I started paying attention to Bolt was back in 2005, when he was just a young, tall talent on the circuit. I had no idea he would be this dominant.\n\n•\"Who says lightning doesn't strike twice in the same spot\" -- I'm pretty sure Ato Boldon was the first to say that. It caught on, and now everyone in the media is using it.\n\n• Don't really know what's up with the US Track and Field team this year, it was kind of hit or miss.\n\n• What on earth happened to Bernard Lagat.\n\n• Props to Bryan Clay.\n\n• You gotta love Lauryn Williams. She's got so much heart, determined to track down the baton and finish the race despite the automatic DQ.\n\n• I don't ever want to hear the name Ohuruogu mentioned in my presence.\n\n• Poor Lolo Jones. Keep ya head up, girl.\n\n• Props to Angelo Taylor, Kerron Clement, and Bershawn Jackson.\n\n• I'd still take Allyson Felix over Veronica Campbell in the 200m. Anyday.\n\n• I now got even more respect for Tyson Gay. Despite having an underwhelming first Olympics, he made zero excuses, even when all the reporters/interviewers gave him every opportunity to blame it on the hamstring injury he suffered during the Trials in July.\n\n• I love Sanya Richards.\n\n• Shawn Crawford is mad cool: \"I didn't cross the line in second. And if I don't cross the line in second, I don't care if people are disqualified or not. I didn't deserve the medal. ... It feels kind of weird, it feels like a charity case. It's horrible, it is heart-breaking and I feel [Spearmon's] pain right now. I hope Usain stepped out too because... that's a gold medal for me.\"\n\n• I wonder if Marion Jones got TV in prison.\n\n• Usain Bolt...(please be clean please be clean please be clean son).\n\n• NBC's tape delay sucked. I wish they gave as much respect to track as they gave to swimming and gymnastics.\n\n• Lashawn Merritt beat Jeremy Wariner, and these two will have some exciting battles to come.\n\n• I love DeeDee Trotter.\n\n• Equestrian is the most stupid Olympics sport ever. How about getting rid of that instead of baseball/softball. You know a sport is wack when the horses are doping.\n\n• 2008 is shaping up to be one heck of a year for Candace Parker.\n\n• Yelena Isinbayeva continued her excellence by winning gold and breaking her own world record. Again.\n\n• Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh dominated the sand again in volleyball. Too bad Misty's idol is Jason Kidd, so she must be crazy.\n\n• And finally, now that the Olympics are over in Beijing, I suppose dogs have reasons to be scared again.\n\nMonday, August 25, 2008, 12:50pm ET ----- D-Miles\n\nSay what you want about Darius Miles, but you gotta admit that this acquisition doesn't hurt the Celtics.\n\nI paid a lot of attention to Darius Miles during the 2000 NBA Draft and during his 2000-2001 rookie season. Coming out of high school, he was hailed as the second coming of KG, who was Miles' favourite player and idol. D-Miles was very raw -- his game relying purely on athleticism -- but seemed very promising if he would just continue to work on his game, his shooting, his footwork, his maturity.\n\nBut after a couple of seasons, it become clear that his head wasn't in the right place. He didn't seem to care about refining his game or maximizing his potential. He still had some street cred, and got a lot of love from the fans -- you know you're hype when you can star in Jordan Brand commercials despite never accomplishing anything, or when Bobbito Garcia in NBA Street Vol.2 acknowledges you by name (D-Miiiiles!) after you dunk in the video game. He even acted in a movie.\n\nMaybe all that got to his head, and he stopped working hard. Off the court, he got in some trouble, got into it with (then) coach Mo Cheeks, and got himself a bad rep. And then he had the microfracture knee surgery in 2006, the damage to the knee was serious enough that his career was deemed to be over. The Blazers waived him.\n\nAnd now, here he is, signed by the Celtics after working out for them twice. There really isn't any risk to the Celtics. It's like this: When the Blazers waived him, there were two years and $18 million left on his contract (six-year, $48 million deal). If Miles plays more than 10 games in any one of the next two seasons, his remaining $18 million salary would go back on the Blazer's books.\n\nI think this is a good, low-risk move by the Celtics. Hopefully, Darius Miles is at a point in his life/career where he's mature enough to understand sacrifice and unselfishness, to appreciate hard work, and to grasp what it means to care about winning and the team concept. I don't worry about any potential negative effect on the Celtics because I know this is a veteran team with a very intelligent coach; and I know there's a guy named Kevin Garnett ready to reel Miles in if he don't ackrite. Remember, Darius Miles looked up to Kevin Garnett, and wanted to be a great player like him.\n\nThis is a chance at redemption for Darius Miles.\n\nFor him to respect the game of basketball. To put back in what he took out of it.\n\nFrom a basketball standpoint, obviously Miles is no James Posey. If the Celtics believe otherwise (which I'm sure they don't), then they are very much mistaken. Miles is not a good on-the-ball defender like Posey, he can't lock down like Posey, he can't spot up like Posey, he can't shoot the three like posey, and he can't hit a freethrow to save his life.\n\nSeriously, Darius Miles is a horrible shooter. If you're an athletic 6'9\" forward who gets a lot dunks, and you still shoot 41.6% from the field for your career, then you need to go put up extra shots in the gym after every practice.\n\nHowever, assuming he's healthy -- and this is a huge assumption at this point -- Miles does bring some things that the Celtics will find useful. At 6'9\", he's slightly bigger than Posey. He certainly is a lot longer than Posey, is more athletic, is a better leaper, and is a much better shotblocker. Miles is also a decent help defender; he probably gets most of his blocks that way. That, and he's still just 26 years old (turning 27 on October 9).\n\nAgain, this is all assuming that he's healthy, and that his knee will hold up through the long season. Remember, he hasn't played in the league in two seasons, and he's coming off a serious major microfracture surgery -- the very surgery for which he spent the past two years rehabbing. He might look decent in a few workouts, but he's still a huge question mark.\n\nAnd No one's gonna expect him to play 25-30 minutes a game. But if he can give a solid 15-20 minutes per game, work hard, play some D, get those long arms in the passing lanes, grab some rebounds, get some dunks, then he will be a valuable contributor on this team. He really needs to work on his shooting, though... especially now that he can't jump out of the gym anymore. And please, improve that freethrow shooting.\n\nIt's time for Darius Miles to figure out how to really play basketball.\n\nThursday, July 31, 2008, 4:09pm ET ----- One Year Later\n\nOn this day last year, July 31st, Kevin Garnett became a Celtic.\n\nIt's been a pretty dope year, wouldn't you say.\n\nHere's to another one. Cheers y'all.\n\nTuesday, July 29, 2008, 11:29pm ET ----- OG Mix\n\nLast year at this time, the Garnett-to-Boston trade talk was all the buzz. It was some craaazy hype. Electric. I was glued to the all the Internet and TV coverage, wondering when the trade was going through. And when it did, I was still caught up in all the coverage, trying to figure out what it meant and what the path was up ahead.\n\nOne year later, the hype's totally lived up to its craziness and expectations. Everything's been fulfilled. It was all justified.\n\nSo this summer, I'm just chilling. So much so that I made another mix. This one a Kevin Garnett high school mix. Back in the DAY, baby! Kevin Garnett is an OG. Make sure you toggle the quality to \"high\" when you go to the Youtube page. If you don't care about quality, you can watch the embedded vid here:\n\nThis mix only took about half a day. Up till now, most of my mixes that have some kind of narrative, a chronology and a flow from which that tell a story. The Legacy mix told a story. The Unfinished Business mix told a story. And the Rebirth mix told a story. Other than the Fatal mix (which really doesn't count, because that was my first mix, and I was just playing around), I prefer creating mixes to tell stories, rather than just throwing together a bunch of disjoined highlights.\n\nSo when I was thinking of doing the high school mix, I figured I didn't need a narrative. I figured this wasn't gonna be that kind of mix. It wasn't going to be long or epic, and I didn't really need to do any of the conceptual planning and tweaking that I did for Rebirth (which took a few days to do, and was exhausting as well as exhilarating). For this high school mix, I was actually aiming for simply a fun highlight reel, something that didn't really have to make sense.\n\nBut for some reason, it turned out to have some form of narrative anyway. As I went through the process, ideas came to me. There's till a chronology. And fittingly, I ended the mix the same way I started the Legacy mix -- with the SI cover of \"Ready or Not,\" as a bridge. Overall, I think it turned out alright.\n\nThis time, I decided to go all intrumental -- no lyrics. The music I went with is Steve Jablonsky's \"Scorponok,\" off the Transformers score. It's absolute fire.\n\nAs always, comments and suggestions are welcome.\n\nMaking this mix, I'm reminded of just how much of a BEAST Kevin Garnett was, dominating and dunking on cats. Obviously, KG is a much better player now than he was as a high school kid -- his game is now much more mature, his footwork refined, his jumpshot developed, his skillset perfected -- but he plays a different game now. He now plays with much more control, finding the true balance between the cerebral and the physical. He certainly doesn't dunk like he used to -- the kind of wild, screaming, fearless, teenage gusto, freakishly athletic and seriously visceral business.\n\nThis mix, then, is a showcase of the raw Kevin Garnett -- not yet top of the world in that certfied-what-can-you-say-now sort of way, but certainly king of the jungle, predator atop the high school foodchain.\n\nBefore Kobe, before T-Mac, before LeBron. There was KG, who did it first. No doubt, an OG.\n\nThursday, July 17, 2008, 1:50pm ET ----- One Month Later\n\nI hope everybody's summer is going great. Today is the 17th of July, meaning that it's been exactly a month since the Celtics won title 17. So I figure I'd check in, say whassup, and catch up on some of the things that have happened.\n\nFirst of all -- and it this is something the team will have to address -- we lost Posey to the Hornets. Just yesterday, he signed a four-year $25 million deal with New Orleans. I think his preference was to stay with the Celtics, and he wanted a longer (four-year) contract, but the Celtics didn't want to commit to more than two years. New Orleans, an up-and-coming contender, came along and offered Posey an ideal contract, so he went with it.\n\nWill the Celtics regret this? I hope not, but obviously right now our team is worse off without Posey, whose tremendous contributions to our championship run cannot be understated. Personally, I believe in the philosophy of holding together a championship nucleus for as long as you can -- because you're in a privileged position. It's a rarity to find a right group of guys with the right chemistry, peaking at the right time and playing at a championship level.\n\nYou should do everything you can to keep that group together. Because you may never get it back. Just look at the Bulls after the 1997-1998 season. Reinsdorf and Krause broke that team apart, didn't want Phil Jackson back, wanted to get trade Pippen, and in effect forced MJ to retire. The franchise hasn't accomplished anything since.\n\nThe lesson: You shouldn't mess with a proven team and a winning formula. Hold on to it for as long as possible.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean giving in to any demand by a 31-year old key contributor. But in this case, I think Posey's four-year deal request was totally reasonable. The Celtics should've given it to him. You can't really blame either side, as this is the nature of the business.\n\nThe Celtics will need to fill that void, because the rest of the East has just gotten tougher. Philly now has Elton Brand. Toronto has Jermaine O'Neal teaming up with Chris Bosh. Miami will have a healthy Wade coming back teaming with young Beasley and (maybe-maybe not) Marion. Orlando has Dwight Howard continuing his ascension to major league dominance.\n\nBoston is going to have to get better, so we see what happens the rest of the this summer. And no, Darius Miles is not the answer. I give props to D-Miles for having the desire to come back from a likely career-ending knee situation, but his game has never been refined to the point where he could contribute without relying purely on athleticism.\n\nIn other news, I'm totally siked about the Olympics. Now, I'm aware of all the politics and negative stuff surrounding the Beijing Games, but I really only care about the athletics. The athletes put their lives into this, and this is their moment. It's all about them. I'm a huge track fan, so I'm really amped. I want to see my girls Sanya Richards and DeeDee Trotter do their thing in the 400m and the relays. I want to see Allyson Felix dominate that 200m the way she does. I wanna see Tyson Gay vs. Usain Bolt vs. Asafa Powell. Jeremy Wariner vs. LaShawn Merritt. Lolo Jones. Yelena Isinbaeva. It's gonna be off the chain.\n\nAnd yes, there will be basketball too. The USA Team will look to bounce back from their ultra-disappointing bronze finish in the 2004 Athens Games.\n\nSunday, June 22, 2008, 12:19pm ET ----- Rebirth\n\nIt took me about two days to put together a new Kevin Garnett mix -- I titled it \"Rebirth\" -- as a tribute to KG's 2007-2008 championship season with the Celtics. I've upped it onto YouTbe now, and I've embedded it here too. However, the quality of the embedded video is standard by default, and is poor -- so I suggest you go directly to the video page here, and click on the \"watch in high quality\" option underneath the clip. Quality is much cleaner that way.\n\nBut it's here if you're not concerned about quality:\n\nThis mix was very enjoyable to make. It was a lot of fun just going through the clips and trying to be creative in my footage selections and in how I wanted the visuals to sync up with the music. The end result is satisfying, even more so because of the fact that it's been a dream season, and that KG is now an NBA champion -- and this mix is really a celebration of that.\n\nAs you can see, the first portion of the mix is comprised of plays from the regular season. The second portion is focused on the Playoffs and Finals run. And the final portion is what it is -- certified at last. The whole thing clocks in at almost 10 minutes, so it's pretty long. Highlights-wise, I made sure to incorporate some signature/memorable plays from throughout season, punctuated by specific sequences in the music. The dunk on Hunter, and the dunk on Gasol -- I really love those parts.\n\nThe music tracks themselves were a different beast. I've had ideas floating around in my head for a while now, ever since I finished up the Unfinished Business mix. Ultimately, I went with three RZA produced tracks. The middle track, \"Thirsty,\" was one I definitely wanted to use -- I actually almost used it a few months ago for a Tracy McGrady mix I was playing around with. But once I realized how versatile and how accommodating the flow/beat was -- i.e. good for either an aggressive mix or a mellow mix, or both -- I decided to use it for a KG mix.\n\nComments and suggestions are welcome. I hope y'all enjoy the mix. I plan to make a Celtics 2007-2008 mix as well, with KG, Paul, Ray, and everybody on this dope Celtics team. So look out for that.\n\nPeace.\n\nThursday, June 19, 2008, 6:53pm ET ----- Certified\n\nHas it sunk in yet? I think so, man.\n\nKevin Garnett is certified.\n\nI watched on TV the live coverage of the Celtics championship parade this morning. It was amazing. You could feel the energy and excitment surging through the crowds and the procession of duck boats. KG and all his teammates were in full celebration mode as they soaked up the glory in their duck boats, which rolled from the TD Banknorth Garden to Copley Square, and back to the Garden again. As he got on the duck boat (he was in the red vehicle), KG had a cigar in his mouth, wore his Celtics cap tilted to the left, and cradled the championship trophy. Pierce, in a separate duck boat, lit up a cigar as well, and showed off his well-deserved Finals MVP trophy.\n\nIt was awesome.\n\nA few hours after the conclusion of Game 6, I posted a video clip of KG's post-game interview with Michele Tafoya, and that clip got tons of views and comments in a hurry. Most of the comments are positive. But it seems that some people are shocked and even offended by KG's way of celebrating and letting his emotions out.\n\nI've now realized that these people don't understand Kevin Garnett at all. They are hatin' on him when they literally know nothing about him, about who he is, what he stands for, and how much he actually cares.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, there was nothing surprising to me about KG's post-game celebration. In fact, I was expecting him to go all out like that, screaming, cursing, crying, smiling from one second to the next. Anyone who understands Garnett will not find his actions strange or think that he was \"on something.\" KG had waited his entire life for this moment, and he had put his heart and soul into getting here. There were times in years past when he probably thought he might not EVER get here, no matter how hard he tried.\n\nSo he has earned every right to celebrate, to cry, to scream, to cuss, to let it all out. And to finally drop the burden that he had been carrying on his shoulders.\n\nYes, Kevin Garnett curses a lot, and he excitedly spewed profanity all over the place as the clock was winding down and as the Celtics were about the win the Finals. It wasn't his fault ABC snuck cameras and microphones near him and had to cut the audio for several seconds. Hey, that's how KG gets himself going and amped up. He's ALWAYS been like that, and every Kevin Garnett fan knows this. Anyone who finds that surprising, or tries to moronically claim that he has no class, knows nothing about Kevin Garnett.\n\nAnd yes, Kevin Garnett gave Michele Tafoya a compliment during the interview. So what. Garnett and Tafoya have developed an easy and friendly rapport not just during these Playoffs, but during the last few seasons. Michele Tafoya was the first reporter to interview Garnett when he won his first ever Playoff series in 2004, in Game 5 against the Nuggets. They have a friendly and professional relationship, and thus his compliment to her was not out of place. So for those people who seem to not understand the context, and who feel compelled to post stupid comments on YouTube, give it a rest.\n\nThere are also idiots who pontificate that KG embarrassed himself and showed no class during his celebration, and that Michael Jordan or Tim Duncan never did this. First of all, everyone gets to this destination through different paths -- MJ won his first title in his seventh season, and Duncan won his first in just his second season; they did not go through what Garnett went through. And secondly, everyone handles emotion differently. You want to talk about class? During the interview with Tafoya, Kevin Garnett gave shoutouts to Minnesota (which got first billing), Chicago, South Carolina, Basswood Drive, and most of all, his mother. How many players have you seen do that -- thanking their previous organization and city, and remembering where they came from? Which other NBA player do you know would look into the camera and speak directly to his mother, telling her that \"We made it, ma.\"\n\nThis is Kevin Garnett. He has always been different. He has always done things his way.\n\nThis was the kid who wore a rubber band around his wrist and popped himself when he made mistakes on the court. This was the kid who moved to Chicago in his senior year of high school, and had to take care of his little sister by himself. This was the kid who suddenly decided to start yelling \"Aaaahhhh! Aaaaaahhh!\" during the now legendary workout at UIC in front of NBA execs and scouts. This was the kid who defied critics and cynics and jumped straight to the NBA out of high school, a trend he would jumpstart. This was the kid who dunked and screamed like he was crazy. This was the kid spewed profanity at himself or no one in particular just to hype himself up. This was the kid who viciously and repeatedly pounded his own head with the basketball for missing freethrows.\n\nThis was the man who had his agent negotiate a $126 million deal at the age of 21, maximizing his worth and getting the most out of the system. This was the man who refused to break the team concept despite endless criticisms of him being too unselfish and passive. This was the man who shed tears during a John Thompson interview because he was \"losing.\" This was the man who refused to demand for a trade and bail out of Minnesota when things got tough. This was the man who put up 20-10-5 for an unprecedented six straight seasons, and whose all-around game complemented his unsurpassed intensity and uncompromising spirit. This was the man who continued to work and work, busting his ass regardless if it's a practice session, a preseason match, a January game against the Grizzlies, or an NBA Finals Game 6.\n\nThis was the champion who celebrated the only way he knew how.\n\nIf any of this is surprising to you, then you know nothing about Kevin Garnett.\n\nWednesday, June 18, 2008, 2:25am ET ----- Champion\n\nHow sweet it is!!\n\nKevin Garnett is an NBA champion. Finally!\n\nI don't even know where to begin with this entry. There's so much to digest, and not all of it has sunk in yet. And oh man, what a game. What a moment. What a dream come true. It's 2:30am right now, and I'm still pretty wired. Can't go to sleep just yet -- probably afraid that I might wake up and realize that I had been dreamin'.\n\nBut no, this ain't a dream. This is it right here -- the Celtics are the 2007-2008 NBA chamipions. Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Doc Rivers, and the entire Celtics squad are NBA champs! The culmination of all the years of hard work, all the disappointments, all the ups and downs, everything finally paid off.\n\nThe ultimate moment of triumph. And they did it as a team.\n\nIt's been a long haul. We needed to play 26 Playoff games this year to win the championship -- the most in NBA history. Seven games in the First Round, seven games in the Second Round, six games in the Conference Finals, and six more in the Championship Round.\n\nAt last, we can exhale.\n\nThe celebration was something. You've never seen Kevin Garnett like this, this emotional, this pumped up, this crazy -- this is way beyond the proverbial little kid on Christmas morning, or the toddler in a candy store. You've seen a bit of this when he won the gold medal back in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and you've also had a glimpse of this when the Timberwolves beat the Kings in Game 7 of the 2004 Western Semis.\n\nBut tonight was a WHOLE new level for Kevin Garnett.\n\nHe kept his game-face on and stayed extremely focused after the series wins against Atlanta, Cleveland, and Detroit. And as the Celtics progressed through the NBA Finals -- one win, two wins, three wins -- KG continued to stay business-like. And tonight, as the Celtics got that final win, it was like KG finally allowed himself to just let everything loose, smiling, screaming, cursing, clowning -- this IS Kevin Garnett. Unleashed. Finally. The only thing he didn't do were cartwheels.\n\nThe game itself was as perfect as Celtics fans could've hoped, filled with tremendous performances, superb shooting, terrific energy, tough plays, hardnose defense -- all of which led to a 39-point blowout victory. Kevin Garnett played like he had everything to prove. He was hungry, aggressive, and did not settle for jumpshots, finishing with 26 points, 14 rebounds, 4 assists, 3 steals, 1 block. He shot 8-12 from the field and made 6-7 freethrows. He led the Celtics charge in the first half, pouring in 17 points by halftime, and getting whatever looks he wanted.\n\nAnyone who doubted Garnett or hated on him should probably go find a hole in the ground to crawl into. Because you were fooled. Because Kevin Garnett had always been a champion -- always played like one, always conducted himself as one.\n\nNow he has a trophy to show for it.\n\nRay Allen caught fire in the second half. He was poked in the eye on a made layup (no foul call) in the first quarter, and was in the locker room for a long time. But he came back to a roaring crowd, with the Celtics working on a lead. And once the third quarter began, Ray Allen started to rain three's. One after another -- many of them wide open. He finished with a NBA Finals record-tying seven three-pointers made.\n\nIt was Rondo who found Ray on several of those treys. Rajon Rondo, oh man. He was unbelievable. Check out what he did tonight: 21 points, 7 rebounds (2 offensive), 8 assists, 6 steals, and just 1 turnover. That's simply amazing. He was all over the court tonight, ripping down rebounds, disrupting Lakers passes, snatching the rock out of the Lakers hands, driving the lane and finding shooters. His prints were all over this game.\n\nPaul Pierce, the Finals MVP who had carried the Celtics in this series, dished out a game-high 10 assists. He didn't shoot great from the field, 3-14, but he got the line eight times (made seven). He was terrific overall tonight once again, and I'm happy he won Finals MVP -- he deserved every bit of it.\n\nPerkins shook off his shoulder strain and started the game. He only played 13 minutes, but he was a real presence for us inside on the defensive end. We missed him in Game 5 when he sat out.\n\nAnd what more can I say about James Posey and Eddie House. They have, in these Playoffs, hit big shots for us time and time again. And they were on cue again in Game 6 tonight. In fact, for a stretch in the second quarter, it was the Posey & House show. The score was 32-29 Celtics before Posey and House got started, and it was 43-29 when they were done. That's an 11-0 barrage by Posey and House together. Wicked.\n\nThis game was, in every sense, a team effort. Everyone stepped up, and everyone came to play on both ends of the floor. Doc Rivers, before the game, asked his team to play lockdown defense for 48 minutes. Throughout the Playoffs, the Celtics have played that kind of defense in spurts and stretches. Doc wanted it for a full 48 minutes. And the team obliged.\n\nKobe Bryant got hot early, scoring 11 points in the first six minutes of the game, hitting several long range three-pointers that were all well-defended. But the Celtics kept at it and shut him down for the rest of the game. In fact, the Celtics basically shut every Laker down, as Gasol couldn't get anything going; neither could Odom, Fisher, or any of their role players. The Celtics stole the ball from the Lakers 18 times (Rondo was literally everywhere). We forced 19 turnovers and committed only 7. We out-rebounded the Laker 48-29, and had 14 offensive boards to the Lakers 2. Heck, Rondo himself had as many offensive rebounds as the entire Lakers team. Controlling the glass was intrumental to our dominating win, where we led by as many as 43 points.\n\nAs the fourth quarter clock reached its final minutes, as we realized that the game was in the bag, Doc took out KG, Ray, and Paul to a standing ovation. The players hugged one another, KG started cussing, and Pierce poured Gatorade all over Doc.\n\nKevin Garnett is my favorite player of all time. It's hard to describe, for me as a long-time Kevin Garnett fan, what I'm feeling right now. It's been a long time coming, no doubt, and it's definitely a joyous moment. But there's no one single feeling -- it's actually a mix of triumph, validation, proudness, relief, happiness, satisfaction, appreciation, and gratefulness. And I'm not quite able to distill everything just yet.\n\nI'm sure I'll have more to say in the coming days, once I have the chance to decompress a bit and digest everything, and to put everything into perspective. I'm definitely gonna be smilin' a lot, as I sift through all the coverage, photos, videos, and articles. And it's gonna be damn good to watch the Celtics championship parade on Thursday. But in the meantime, I'm just gonna enjoy this, and maybe eat some peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\n\nI'll say this, though: Ultimately, the journey means more than the destination. This moment would not be as sweet as it is had the journey been easy. The process is what makes you a true fan, not the end reward or the triumph. Similarly for KG, the process is what makes him a champion, not the trophy or the ring.\n\nEverything and anything in life that is worthwhile, needs to be earned.\n\nSo I would not trade any of those first round disappointments for anything. All those years of watching KG and the Timberwolves get bounced by stronger teams, of feeling the frustration and disappointment that accompany each defeat and setback, of continuing to roll with KG and root for him -- I think back now, and it was all worth it.\n\nFor this moment right here.\n\nAnd I know that Kevin Garnett would tell you the same thing.\n\nTuesday, June 17, 2008, 1:20pm ET ----- Hate Harder\n\nKevin Garnett critics have come out to play.\n\nTake Peter Vescey, for instance, and his latest venom in the New York Post. Of course, this is Peter Vescey after all, who no one likes. He makes everyone around him uncomfortable, and every time I see him on an NBA TV studio program, I want to change the channel. His caustic and spiteful tone and his natural tendency to hate on people are things we've all come to expect from him. But, looking at his choice of words and insults in yesterday's article, his attack on Garnett seems very personal.\n\nI don't really know why he's so intently on trying to rip KG apart. Back in 1998 -- 10 years ago -- I remember him in the NBC studio with Hannah Storm, speaking fondly of Kevin Garnett. He said that Garnett was a refresing, great kid, that Garnett respectfully called him \"Mr. Vescey\" in interviews.\n\nSo I don't know what happened in these 10 years that made Vescey so bitter towards Garnett. Maybe because the Knicks suck, and he's just sniping at random targets. Maybe there's nothing else for him to write about. Or maybe it was Monday.\n\nWho knows -- all I know is that he mocks Garnett by calling him \"cocky\" and a \"fake franchise player.\" And that he moronically quotes Ron Artest, who attended Game 4 in Los Angeles: \"Where's the fire when KG is down 20?\" Artest said. \"Watch how he goes back to huddle like a puppy. You're either a soldier all the time or you're not. You can't be a part-time soldier.\"\n\nWait a second, isn't this the same Ron Ron who onced quit on his team and asked the Pacers for some time off to work on his rap album?\n\nHere's a pro tip, Mr. Vescey -- when you need to quote Ron Arest to help you make your point, you're shooting blanks. And your article sucks.\n\nKevin Garnett is a \"fake franchise player?\" Have you even been following the NBA this season? The Boston Celtics was not even relevant last year, winning merely 24 games, on the path to nowhere. Then they got Garnett, who came in and not only completely changed the attitude and culture of this team, but rerejuvenated basketball in Beantown. Paul Pierce and Ray Allen, not known as defenders throughout their careers, are suddenly playing great D. Doc Rivers suddenly looks like a brilliant coach. Perkins and Rondo suddenly look like extremely promising talents. The Celtics suddenly won 66 games to finish the regular season. In other words, Kevin Garnett has totally lived up to the expectations and hype since the blockbuster trade was made last summer; his team is one win away from capturing the championship; and he is, in every sense of the tern, a true franchise player.\n\nPeter Vescey, you are a moron. And your article is asinine.\n\nAs far as the general criticisms of KG go, I agree with the assertion that KG doesn't demand the ball enough during crunch time, and that he does not take it upon himself to make something happen late in games. But that is not the same thing as fading away or disappearing. He merely plays the same way in the fourth quarter as he does in the first quarter -- passing to open teammates, getting everyone involved, not deviating from the team concept.\n\nGarnett is naturally a team-player and totally selfless, and I don't think there's anything wrong with playing that way. While I do think he could demand the ball a little more during crunchtime, and be more aggressive and get to the line, he's doing just fine. He knows that he has shooters out there, and he trusts his teammates. So why should he force the issue?\n\nGame 6 is tonight. Perkins is out, still, meaning we're missing a major physical presence in the paint. Gasol and Odom had a field day in there in Game 5. This is a problem, and we need to deal with it.\n\nRay Allen, who was attending to his child's health issue immediately after Game 5, got back to Boston much later than the team. The mental switch (worried about his son) and physical adjustment (jetlag) will be something he needs to overcome.\n\nPaul Pierce will still need to carry much of the scoring load, and put pressure on the Lakers' perimeter defense. Let's hope his knee holds up.\n\nAnd Kevin Garnett, in his own words, played \"like garbage\" in Game 5. He knows he needs to play better, and not commit silly fouls or put himself in positions where the refs could call phantom fouls.\n\nJust one more win. Let's hope tonight's the night where the dream finally comes true.\n\nGo Celtics.\n\nMonday, June 16, 2008, 12:11am ET ----- Not Quite\n\nThe good news is that we're going back to Boston.\n\nThe bad news is that the Lakers are coming with us.\n\nGame 5 began the same way Game 4 did -- ominously -- with the Lakers jumping all over us. This was very disturbing. We can't be playing from behind, thinking we can always mount a successful comeback. We trailed by as many as 19 points in the second quarter, and yes we did stage another comeback -- except this time we made our comeback much quicker and earlier.\n\nThe difference was that in Game 4, we made the comeback and took the lead much later in the game, at a stretch where the game was during crunchtime and we were able to maintain our sense of urgency and adrenaline. But tonight, we quickly sliced the 19-point margin with a 15-0 run. And then it was like we just didn't know how to keep going and ride that momentum. It was almost as if we were satisfied just with erasing the 19-point deficit. I know we weren't thinking that, but it appeared that way from a execution and focus standpoint.\n\nPaul Pierce was superb once again. He played amazing. Simply amazing. He drove to the basket incessantly, drawing fouls and splitting multiple defenders and twisting his way to the hoops time and time again. The Lakers could not stop him. He finished with 38 points, making 16-19 freethrows. He also had 6 rebounds and 8 assists.\n\nRay Allen was solid, but didn't have a great shooting night (4-13 field goals). He finished with 16 points, and hit three shots from beyond the arc.\n\nJames Posey played terrific, once again doing every little thing that doesn't necessarily show up on the boxscore. Sam Cassell came off the bench and hit some shots for us. Tony Allen gave us a lift as well. Overall, our bench did a fine job tonight.\n\nHis ankle not at 100%, Rondo started the game but was ineffective tonight. He needs to stop driving to pass, and start driving to score. He made some bad decisions and bad passes tonight, where he drove the lane and was wide open for a layup, but kicked it back out to a shooter. Take the shot, Rajon. Only pass if the defenders collapse on you; they haven't been doing that, so Rondo needs to finish those plays.\n\nKevin Garnett started off on a strong offensive note, hitting 4-6 shots early for 8 points in the first quarter. But he got in foul trouble early again and played just 11 minutes in the entire first half. He picked up his second foul (a bad call, if you watch the replays) with about a minute to go in the first quarter, went to sit down. Then came back in the second quarter and was immediately whistled for his third foul.\n\nAnd as a result, KG could not find his offensive rhythm at all. Defensively, he was his excellent usual self -- 14 rebounds (7 offensive boards), 2 steals -- but he could not get a rhythm going on the offensive end. He even missed three freethrows (1-4), two of which were crucial misses late in the game.\n\nSo we're going back to the TD Banknorth Garden for Game 6. For various reasons -- big road challenge, putting a desperate team away, Father's Day, injuries situation -- I really wished that we could've won the series tonight. We had a great chance to win it. Even though we played so poorly, and even though we basically played much of the game without three of our starters (injuries, foul trouble), the game was still right there for our taking. But it didn't happen.\n\nNow we really have to be careful. Things can unravel quickly if we don't take this series as soon as possible.\n\nBecause of his sprained ankle, Rondo is not playing at 100%. Kendrick Perkins didn't play tonight at all because of the shoulder injury, and is doubtful for Game 6. And Paul Pierce -- who refused an MRI because he does not want to know the result until the Finals are over -- is playing his heart out on a hurt knee. The longer this series goes, the more worn out we become; we've already played 25 Playoff games in the past two months out of a possible 26. So like I said, we really need to win this series as quickly as possible.\n\nOne positive is that now we can win in front of our home crowd -- Celtics fans in Boston deserve to be a part of it, and they will get the chance to cheer on their team in Game 6 and Game 7. Obviously, every Celtics fan hopes that Game 7 won't be necessary.\n\nAnother positive is that Kevin Garnett will get an opportunity to clinch a championship on a better performance than he had tonight. Foul trouble really hurt his edge in the past two games, and overall he hasn't shot the ball well in past four games.\n\nSo expect a big game from KG Tuesday night.\n\nFriday, June 13, 2008, 12:49am ET ----- The Monument\n\nGame 4 will go down as one of the greatest comebacks in NBA history, and will be forever talked about and cemented in Celtics lore.\n\nThis is the stuff champions are made of.\n\nThe only thing more stunning than how atrocious the Celtics played in the first half was how awesome they played in the second half. When the first quarter ended, Kevin Garnett was sitting on the bench with two early fouls, and the Celtics were trailing by 21 points -- the largest first quarter deficit in Finals history. I was in utter shock.\n\nEverything looked grim. Everything suddenly got on my nerve -- from the ugly-assed Vujacic celebration on the Lakers bench to the 9 millionth time Mike Breen said \"Puts it in!\" -- I was extremely irritated. The Celtics trailed by as many as 24 points in the second quarter (down 45-21 midway through the period), looking out of sync, lost, both offensively and defensively challenged as the Lakers poured it on. This is the NBA Finals -- what on Earth are the Celtics doing.\n\nThen, slowly, signs of pulse.\n\nLike a ice-sculptor patiently and intently chipping away at a block of ice, the Celtics encroached on the Lakers colossal lead. Every blow and every run we mustered was met by a definitive response, as the Lakers held us off. When we managed to slice the lead to 12 four minutes after being down 24, the Lakers responded by scoring five straight points to push it up to 17. When we cut the lead to 15, thinking that would be the decifit going into halftime, the Lakers (Farmar) drained a heartwrenching buzzer-beating trey for an 18-point lead.\n\nThe block of ice was not giving way.\n\nBut giving up was not an option.\n\nThird quarter. Celtics chipped the lead to 12 points (60-48) again on a Kevin Garnett jumper at the 9:55 mark. The pulse of life was beating, but the Lakers snatched it again. Los Angeles pushed the lead back up to 20 (70-50) at the halfway mark of the quarter. This was Game 4 of the NBA Finals, and we trailed by 20 points midway through the third quarter. Our every advance was denied, every punch counterpunched, every run met by another.\n\nThe block of ice was still looking every bit as unmanageble and daunting as it did in the first half.\n\nAnd then, it happened. A 21-3 run by the Celtics to end the third quarter -- Pierce driving layup, House three-pointer, Ray Allen freethrows, Posey layup, PJ Brown slam dunk, to list a few play-by-play seqeuences -- and the score was suddenly 73-71 Lakers.\n\nFour quarter. Leon Powe jumpshot. Boom. Tie game. The two teams traded baskets for the next few minutes, with the Celtics unable to take the lead despite having several opportunities to convert. Just more than halfway through the fourth quarter, Kobe Bryant dunked the ball to give the Lakers a four point lead. But the Celtics kept at it, working intently to fight through the adversity.\n\nUntil finally, a breakthrough.\n\nEddie House jumpshot at 4:07 -- Celtics lead 84-83, their first lead of the entire game. And they maintained it.\n\nRay Allen's sick reverse layup pushed it to a three point lead. Kevin Garnett's jumper dropped through for a five point lead. Celtics hit big shot after big shot -- Pierce freethrow, Posey three-pointer, Ray Allen clearout driving left-handed layup, House freethrow -- and there it was.\n\nThe ice in front of us, no longer the block it used to be, is a lovely sculpture that looks more and more like the Larry O'Brien trophy.\n\nIt's not quite ours yet. But almost.\n\nIn thinking about not just this game, but also about Kevin Garnett's entire career, I'm reminded of a quote by Jacob Riis, a 19th century social reformer. I came across the quote just recently and it has quickly become an instant favourite. Even though it's a motto that hangs as a banner above the entrance of an enemy locker room (San Antonio Spurs), it's still a valuable lesson that rings true. And they are indeed words to live by:\n\n\"When nothing seems to help, I go look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before.\"\n\nAll that had gone before.\n\nKevin Garnett is here today because he's been hammering away at that rock (or block of ice) for so long. Making the jump from high school to the NBA, proving doubters and haters wrong, putting up extra shots after practice, working on each go-to move, perfecting footwork and that turnaround jumper, studying film and tape, becoming an elite player, battling year after year in the cut-throat Western Conference, getting bounced in the first round seven consecutive years, losing in Game 6 of the West Finals, missing the Playoffs altogether for the next three seasons, getting a new start in a new city with high expectations and intense scrutiny.\n\nBlow after blow. It's the process that got him here.\n\nAnd finally, that stone is about to split into two. That block of ice is about to turn into a work of art. A monument that Kevin Garnett can call his own.\n\nAll that's needed, is to deliver one final blow.\n\nGame 5 is Sunday.\n\nTuesday, June 10, 2008, 11:59pm ET ----- Missed Opportunity\n\nKevin Garnett and Paul Pierce played terrible.\n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat it. Gotta keep it real and tell it like it is. KG and Paul stunk it up tonight in Game 3, and we missed a perfect opportunity to go up 3-0. Instead, the series is now 2-1, with the next two games still in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Celtics were down by as many as 11 points. But even though KG and Pierce couldn't find the basket at all in the first half -- if I remember right, KG was 1-9 at one point, and Pierce was 1-8 or something like that -- we were still in the game. Ray Allen was on tonight, as he and the role players kept us within striking distance. We clawed back and took the lead in the third quarter. It was a small lead, two points here, four points there, as both teams traded baskets back and forth late in the third quarter.\n\nUnfortunately, Kobe Bryant played brilliantly and seemingly very aggressively (getting to the line over and over and over again in the first half) throughout the game. And he hit several clutch baskets as the Lakers re-took the lead midway through the fourth quarter and pulled away. Kobe finished with 36 points on 12-20 shooting, and 11-18 from freethrows. Another player that really hurt us tonight was Vujacic. It's one thing to have Kobe Bryant going off like that, but it's unacceptable to have Sasha Vujacic punk us. How the hell can you let this boy drop 20 points on you.\n\nRay Allen was splendid tonight, scoring 25 points on 8-13 shooting, including 5-7 from downtown. Ray's defense on Kobe was as good as anyone could've played -- but great offense generally beats great defense, and there was nothing more Ray could've done to keep Kobe in front of him and contest every shot. James Posey was terrific as well, hustling and doing the little things that don't always show up on a stats sheet. Rondo played well, despite missing some time due to the mild ankle sprain he suffered during the game.\n\nKevin Garnett had an ugly shooting night, 6-21 from the field. Defensively, he was superb as usual -- 12 rebounds, 3 blocks, 1 steal. But too many jumpshots on the offensive end. KG a good jumpshooter, but if it's not falling, he should post-up more and try to get to the line (he was only 1-2 from the foul line tonight). KG found some rhythm in the third quarter -- I think he had like 7 or 9 points in the quarter -- but when the fourth quarter started, he was on the bench for his usual rest. I agree with Jeff Van Gundy: Doc should've kept KG and Pierce in the game to start the fourth quarter. This is the NBA Finals -- everyone should be ready to play heavy minutes and take less rest. We led by two points going into the fourth quarter, and we should have come out swinging big. Instead, KG and Pierce sat on the bench when the quarter began, and Vujacic immediately hit a 3-pointer to give the Lakers the lead.\n\nThe other big NBA news tonight was the Tim Donaghy situation. Of course, David Stern and the NBA have and will vehemently deny everything Donaghy is saying, and dismiss his claims as nothing more than a desperate man trying to lessen his sentence (which will be on July 14). But if there's an ounce of truth to what Donaghy is alleging -- then the repercussions will really hurt basketball and the integrity of the league. Donaghy implied that the 2002 Kings-Lakers series was heavily influenced by NBA officials and refs, alleging that Game 6 was essentially handed to the Lakers to win so that they could force Game 7 against the Kings.\n\nEveryone knows that the NBA is a business. Networks like TNT and ABC/ESPN are a business. The longer a series goes on for, the more viewers they attract and the more money they all make. That's why they would prefer a series to go six or seven games instead of four or five -- because more games means more ratings and revenues. Why do you think they changed the first round format from best-of-five to best-of-seven in 2002-2003?\n\nAnd also, had the Lakers not beat the Kings in the Western Conference Finals that year, the 2002 NBA Finals would've been Sacramento vs. New Jersey. Which match-up do you think would've generated higher ratings and more revenue for the NBA, Lakers-Nets or Kings-Nets? The answer is obvious, even if David Stern will never admit it.\n\nBut here's the important distinction: Hoping for longer series or wishing for certain dream match-ups (Lakers-Celtics anyone?) is one thing. But influencing and manipulating outcomes is another. I'm not sure I believe everything Donaghy is saying. First of all, this is not a man of integrity to begin with. He is a convincted felon (something David Stern was keen to stress repeatly when speaking with reporters tonight upon arriving at the Staples Center loading dock) and he is facing prison time. He and his lawyers obviously are doing everything they can to get him as light a sentence as possible, by \"cooperating\" with the investigation and implicating as many people as possible. He'll throw the entire league under the bus if he thinks he can get his sentence reduced. And also, the sudden revelation of these allegations arguably came as a retaliatory response to the NBA's demand of $1 million in restituion.\n\nSo take what Donaghy is claiming with a grain of salt.\n\nBut whether or not there is any validity and credibility to Donaghy's claims, it does take away some of the enjoyment of these NBA Finals games. As a fan, you start to unconsciously question every call, every whistle. You wonder why Kobe Bryant was all of a sudden getting ten freethrow attempts in the first quarter alone. You wonder if there was a memo sent to the refs, mandating them to offset the freethrow disparity from the first two games and make up the difference, or if it was just the Lakers simply being extra aggressive tonight.\n\nYou wonder if somehow the NBA is sweet on Kobe Bryant and want to capitalize on his MVP season and renewed popularity. You wonder why ABC/ESPN keeps gushing about how great Kobe is, fawning over his every move, every basket, and every gesture. You wonder why a Kevin Garnett alley-oop gets no replay, but a Kobe Bryant layup gets replays from multiple angles.\n\nYou wonder if this series will somehow and inexplicably go seven games.\n\nBut do remember this, it's nobody else's fault when you shoot 6-21 and 2-14.\n\nThat's on you.\n\nMonday, June 9, 2008, 11:05am ET ----- Ubuntu\n\nThat should be our mindset as the series site moves to Los Angeles. Ubuntu.\n\nJust like all season.\n\nBeing up 2-0 is as good as we could've hoped for coming into this series (or any series). But nothing is automatic or guaranteed. We of all people should know that, considering what we went through against Atlanta and Cleveland. All we've done so far in the Finals is hold serve at home. Now we take the show on the road, and we gotta continue to play as a team for that common goal.\n\nUbuntu.\n\nI almost missed the game last night. About two hours before tipoff, all the power went out in my home. I had to go find myself a TV, so my sis and I went to a nearby hotel bar, ordered orange juice, and watched the game from there. I got a call early in the first quarter, telling me that the power had returned. So we went home at halftime to watch the rest of the game.\n\nOverall, it was a great game. But the fourth quarter was quite a scare. In fact, we stunk so bad in the fourth quarter and got so lackadaisical that it must be discussed. We almost blew a 24-point lead. Yes, that's right -- we led by 24 points (95-71) with just under 8 minutes to go in the game.\n\nSeemed like a more than comfortable enough lead, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nIn fact, it was too comfortable. So comfortable that we relaxed and stopped playing basketball. We took rushed-shots, played no defense, and gave up way too many three-pointers to the Lakers. Check this, we let the Lakers score 41 points in that fourth quarter. And we let them cut the lead all the way down to two with 38 seconds left in the game. How we went managed to go from a 24-point lead to a mere 2-point lead in about half a quarter is beyond me. It was pretty disturbing (and horrifying) to watch.\n\nBut we managed to wake up in the final seconds, played some actual defense, draw some fouls, and hit all of our freethrows. So the Celtics held on, and won 108-102. It was quite a relief.\n\nSecond-year Leon Powe played the best Playoff game of his life, scoring 21 points on 6-7 shooting in just 15 minutes of play. Think about that for a minute. He played just 15 minutes. He got the line 13 times (made 9). Virtually all of his shots came around the basket -- mainly dunks -- meaning he was active and aggresive, and got his hands ready for passes. He even had one sequence where he dribbled the length of the floor and went in for the wide open dunk all by himself.\n\nAnd with that -- if the Celtics manage to win these Finals -- Powe has just made himself part of the Celtics folklore.\n\nRajon Rondo also played a critical role. He had 16 assists and just 2 turnovers (one of which was an offensive foul). His assist-to-turnover ratio has been remarkable in these Playoffs. One play stuck out in my mind, where Rondo drove the lane, faked a behind-the-back-pass, brough the ball back to the front for a shot, and then passed it off last minute to a wide open Powe for the dunk.\n\nAnother play that stuck out was where he blocked the 6'10\" Radmanovic's three-point attempt -- just met him at the top and snuffed him -- and ran down court. Kevin Garnett, catching the errant ball, fired the long pass to Rondo, who finished the break with the one-handed dunk.\n\nOne area Rondo really needs to improve is his freethrow shooting -- especially as a point guard. He hasn't been consistent at the line, and we need him to knock those down. I'm sure he knows this.\n\nPaul Pierce shrugged off his sore knee and continued his hot shooting, scoring 28 points on 9-16 shooting, including nailing all four of his three-pointers. He also had 4 rebounds and 8 assists. Ray Allen seems to have left his much publicized/discussed shooting slump in the dust. He scored 17 points on 6-11 shooting, and hitting 3-6 from downtown. Kevin Garnett chipped in 17 points as well, and ripped down 14 rebounds.\n\nAs a team, one thing that really stuck out was that we shot 38 freethrows... compared to 10 by the Lakers. That's a HUGE disparity. Powe had more freethrow attempts himself than the entire Lakers team. I don't know if it was the advantage of being at home, or just the fact that we were more aggressive overall -- but don't expect those calls when we get to LA. Phil Jackson is already complaining and planting the seeds for how the next few games might be officiated. The Celtics just need to continue to attack, and not get discouraged if calls don't go our way.\n\nAnd with the victory last night, the Celtics are two wins away from winning the championship. The nearly-blown lead notwithstanding, we should be pleased with the 2-0 lead. But not satisfied, obviously.\n\nOnly three teams in NBA Finals history had come back from a 0-2 deficit ('69 Celtics, '77 Blazers, '06 Heat). So we have history on our side, as it is rare for a team up 2-0 to blow a series in the Finals. But history doesn't mean a thing if we don't come out and play the right way. Again, nothing is automatic -- just ask Dallas, who two years ago blew a 2-0 Finals lead to the Miami Heat. A 2-0 lead is just a cushion for us going into the next three games, which are ALL in Los Angeles.\n\nConsidering what we did in the Pistons series, it seems that we have snapped out of our road woes. Hopefully, the roadkills of the Hawks series and the Cavs series are long gone, and that we've turned from road worriers to road warriors. And we'll need to be tough for the next three games in LA.\n\nIf all goes well, the next time we come back to Boston, we'll be carrying some hardware with us. But let's take this one game at a time. First let's focus on Game 3, which is tomorrow night.\n\nGo Celtics.\n\nSaturday, June 7, 2008, 6:33pm ET ----- They Can't Handle The Truth\n\n\"They\" as in LA. The media. The Lakers fans. Phil Jackson.\n\nThey can't handle The Truth.\n\nSo they go and come up excuses on why the Celtics won Game 1. Because apparently there's nothing else to write about, and it's too hard to give credit where it's due. Gotta blame the loss on something, right? They claim that Pierce faked the severity of his injury, that he was acting, and that he was over-dramatic trying to incite the home crowd.\n\nGive me a break.\n\nI'm not surprised to hear Phil Jackson suggest this notion after Game 1 -- he is the master of mind games, after all. And he's always been adept at trying to get under the skin of the fans in opposing cities. Just ask Sacramento fans.\n\nBut of course, certain columnists of the LA press took this and ran with it, accusing Pierce of acting. That's the media for you -- it's hardly surprising considering it's Lakers-vs-Celtics, a rivalry rekindled. And the media will write about anything to fuel the flame. What are you gonna do.\n\nJust play basketball. That's what.\n\nAnd focus on Game 2 tomorrow night.\n\nBy his own admission, Kevin Garnett thought he himself played \"terrible\" in the fourth quarter of Game 1, and promises to be better in Game 2. His 1-6 shooting in the fourth quarter was indeed really poor. Obviously, he redeemed himself with that ferocious putback slam over Gasol with about a minute and a half to go, and followed that with two freethrows to keep the lead safe -- but he knows that he needs to play better offensively in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"I thought I got my hands on loose balls,\" KG said. \"(I had) a lot of shots I knew I could make, rhythm shots, and I just missed them. I thought I was active. I was talkative, but I could be better, and I will be.\"\n\nNot all the articles out of the LA press are idiotic. There was a nice one about KG, with mentions of his Farragut Academy days with Ronnie Fields. Worth a read.\n\nSo Game 2 is tomorrow night on ABC. I prefer TNT's crew over ABC/ESPN's, but ABC is doing a decent job in these Playoffs. Mike Breen is a great play-by-play man, but somehow I prefer his work back in the NBC days. Jeff Van Gundy is hilarious as an analyst. This guy should get his own reality TV show. There should be a camera crew that follows him around all day. Of all the people in the world who you'd expect to be so tightly wound and NOT funny, he surprises you with his funny but insightful material, comedic timing, and delivery. He is great in his observations and self-deprecating humor. It's almost certain that in each game, he'll say something that will make you laugh.\n\nSo set that lasting image of Van Gundy clinging to Zo's leg in the 1998 Playoffs aside for a moment, and enjoy his commentary for the Finals.\n\nMark Jackson, on the other hand -- who gushes about Kobe each and every game, and who thinks Kobe might be better than MJ -- is grating as an analyst for the most part. This is the same Mark Jackson that was trying to land the Knicks head-coaching job a few weeks back. I'm sure no team owner or exec want to have anything to do with a candidate who actually thinks Kobe is better than Michael.\n\nIn the studio, you have Stuart Scott, Michael Wilbon, and Jon Barry. Stuart Scott does a nice job, though sometimes he seems overly exicted about the littlest things, as if trying to pump up everything he's saying. If you want a perfect studio host with the right voice and tone, look at Ernie on TNT.\n\nMichael Wilbon, who always appears to desperately want to be taken seriously when he speaks, probably doesn't know what he's talking a"
