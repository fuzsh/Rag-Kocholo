        "text": "There was this time I was watching him play and I saw him dunk over someone. If you think about it now, to dunk on somebody isn't very special, but if you're an 8-year old boy, watching a game of basketball, imagine it in that perspective.\n\nMy hero is Kevin Garnett. He was born on May 19, 1976, in Mauldin, South Carolina, to Shirley Garnett and O'Lewis McCullough. His first three years of high school, he played basketball for Mauldin High School. The summer before his senior year, he was in a clash between black and white students. To avoid being harmed, and ruining his future basketball career, he transferred to Farragut Academy HS, in Chicago. He was named Mr. Basketball for the state of Illinois, after his senior season. Although he transferred to Farragut Academy, his jersey hangs high in the gym at Mauldin High School (GARNETT 21).\n\nIn 1995, Garnett was drafted into the NBA (National Basketball Association), by the Minnesota Timberwolves. In the history of the Timberwolves, they had not yet had a 30+ win season. Garnett didn't rise to stardom as a rookie like LeBron James, or Dwight Howard, but he did have a decent rookie season. He made the all-rookie, second team roster. At this time, Garnett was the youngest player in the league, at 19 years, and 11 months of age.\n\nKevin Garnett is my hero because I've always wanted to play basketball. Since he went straight to the NBA, right after high school, he is a good role-model to all aspiring, high school basketball players. His off-court heroics are unforgettable as well. Not to mention the fact that he plays for my favorite NBA team, the Boston Celtics.\n\nIf I were to ever meet Kevin, I would have many questions for him. The main question Id like the answer to is: \"Why did you leave Mauldin High, for Farragut Academy?\" If I could get the answer to that, I'd be satisfied. I would also like to ask: \"What inspired you to become an NBA star?\" As well as: \"What are your plans after your basketball career?\" and finally: \"If you did go play college ball, where would you have played?\"\n\nOther events he's been involved with, are very good examples of why he's my hero as well. In 2006, he went to help the Katrina relief efforts at the Target Center in New Orleans, along with many players and coaches, from many different teams. He also donated $1.2 million to Oprah's \"Angel Network,\" which helped build 24 houses over a 2-year span. After all of that help, he played in a basketball game that raised $100,000 for tsunami relief in Malaysia. Not to mention the fact that he helps women and children with cancer, takes underprivileged kids on Christmas shopping trips, and donates computers to inner-city schools."
