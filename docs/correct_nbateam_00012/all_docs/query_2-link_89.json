        "text": "Chicago has an incredibly rich history on the hardwood. For generations, the ball played in high school gyms around this city has been as good as anywhere in the country, producing an unmatched list of players that eventually matriculated to success in the NBA. And countless others that — let’s face it — would beat you pretty soundly in a game of H-O-R-S-E.\n\nTo celebrate this longstanding tradition of basketball excellence, we’ve rather poetically put together a list of Chicago’s greatest all-time basketball players.\n\nDisclaimer: While you might expect to see Michael Jordan on this list, he is not. He grew up in North Carolina and, as synonymous as MJ is with the 3-1-2, we can’t claim his roots. Unfortunately. Kevin Garnett, while a graduate of Farragut Academy, only lived in Chicago for a little over a year. Again, we’d like to claim him, but cannot.\n\nWith that out of the way, we proudly present Chicago’s all-time greatest basketball players.\n\nMark Aguirre\n\nHigh school: Westinghouse\n\nCollege: DePaul\n\nCareer highlights: 3x NBA all-star, 2x NBA champion\n\nAguirre was voted both the AP and Naismith Player of the Year his final season at DePaul (1979-80) and was the first overall selection in the 1980 NBA Draft by the Dallas Mavericks.

Anderson scored a team-record 50 points for the Magic in April 1993, and played in the 1995 NBA Finals.\n\nDee Brown\n\nHigh school: Proviso East\n\nCollege: University of Illinois\n\nCareer highlights: 2005 Big Ten Player of the Year\n\nBrown was named Mr. Basketball in Illinois and won the Gatorade Player of the Year award in 2002.

The 1975-76 Hoosier squad remains the last team to complete an undefeated season with a championship. He was also a member of the gold medal-winning team in the 1976 Olympics in Montreal. Buckner was the seventh overall pick in the 1976 NBA Draft, and won an NBA championship with Boston in 1984.\n\nMaurice Cheeks\n\nHigh school: Du Sable\n\nCollege: West Texas A&M\n\nCareer highlights: 4x NBA All-Star, 1983 NBA Champion Cheeks was one of the premier point guards in the NBA in the 1980s, named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team four times and played in four NBA All-Star.

Since retiring, he has served as the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers and the 76ers.\n\nTerry Cummings\n\nHigh school: Carver\n\nCollege: DePaul\n\nCareer highlights: 2x NBA All-Star, 1983 NBA Rookie of the Year.

Late in the 2006-07 season, he was traded to the San Antonio Spurs, with whom he won an NBA Championship that spring.\n\nMichael Finley\n\nHigh school: Proviso East\n\nCollege: University of Wisconsin\n\nCareer highlights: 2007 NBA Champion, two-time NBA All-Star Finley was a member of the famous “Three Amigos” team at Proviso East with future NBA players Donnie Boyce and Sherrell Ford.

Hardaway created the “killer crossover” and was among the most lethal guards in the NBA over his 13-year career. He was named first team All-NBA in 1997 and his career average of 8.2 assists per game is the twelfth best mark in NBA history.\n\nHersey Hawkins\n\nHigh school: Westinghouse\n\nCollege: Bradley\n\nCareer highlights: 1988 NCAA AP Player of the Year, 1991 NBA All-Star Hawkins played four years at Bradley University, where he won back-to-back Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year Awards and averaged an NCAA Division I-leading 36.3 points per game his senior year.
