        "text": "The Boston Celtics are the most storied franchise in NBA history. They lead the NBA with their 18 championship banners hanging from the rafters of the TD Garden. Right now, the current version of the Celtics is poised to become the latest dynasty in the NBA, assuming they can stay healthy and locked in.\n\nBoston has enjoyed some of the most dominant teams in NBA history and some of the most iconic players. Bill Russell, Tommy Heinsohn, Larry Bird, John Havlicek, Bob Cousey, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, the list of all-time great Celtics is as long as it is impressive.\n\nNevertheless, a recent YouTube video by NESN postulated that we may be watching the greatest Celtics team in history due to its dominance, depth and the elite skillsets on offer up and down the roster. However, the current roster is likely a couple more championships away from being considered as the best Celtics team of all time.\n\nYou can watch the full reasoning for why this Celtics team could be the all-time best roster by clicking on the embedded video above.\n\nSubscribe to the “Celtics Chronicle” podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3UAVYRg\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3y0H4Lh\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS"
