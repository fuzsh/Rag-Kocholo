        "text": "Kevin Garnett will not be the next owner of the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nThe basketball Hall of Famer and Timberwolves icon announced on Instagram Thursday that his bid to purchase the franchise as part of an ownership group is over. He also delivered a message to team owner Glen Taylor, with whom he's carried a feud since his 2016 departure from the team.\n\n'Can never own them, only rent them'\n\nGarnett then lamented the lack of access to ownership of a franchise he helped build.\n\nWhile a \"disappointed\" Garnett appears ready to move on to what's next, the ownership fate of the Timberwolves remains unclear. Taylor reportedly began to explore a sale last July. Garnett announced his interest in buying the team shortly thereafter. Minnesota Vikings owners Zygi and Mark Wilf and Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam have also reportedly shown interest.\n\nFor now, what is known is that Garnett's feud with Taylor carries on.\n\n'I don't do business with snakes'\n\nWhen discussing the notion of having his Timberwolves jersey retired last April, Garnett said that he's \"not entertaining it\" while sharing a pointed assessment of Taylor's character with The Athletic's Shams Charania.\n\nWhy is Garnett mad at Taylor?\n\nGarnett accuses Taylor of failing to honor a deal they struck along with former general manager and head coach Flip Saunders. Garnett says that when he waived a no-trade clause to return to the Timberwolves from the Brooklyn Nets in 2015, it came with an understanding that he would join team ownership and play a front-office role after he retired.\n\nHe says Taylor backed out of that arrangement when Saunders died of Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2015. Garnett retired in 2016 after playing his final NBA season in Minnesota.\n\nThe prospect of ridding the franchise of Taylor and taking ownership himself was an exciting one for Garnett. Now, it appears that he'll have to settle strictly for Taylor's pending exit. When and if Taylor does sell the team, perhaps Garnett will seek to mend fences with the franchise he otherwise loves.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:"
