        "text": "NBA training camps opened this week, and it’s difficult to remember the last time the league has changed this dramatically in a single offseason. Multiple teams have lost current or former franchise players through retirement, free agency and health issues. Three Hall of Famers are gone, while another has just announced that this season will be his last. The Cleveland Cavaliers are actually defending champions – and if that’s not a sign of a radical shift in the basketball cosmos then nothing is.\n\nAmong those retiring are two of the players who, unintentionally, helped create the modern state of the NBA: Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce. Barring an improbable return from the not-officially retired Ray Allen, the first Big Three of the modern era will have gone by next summer. On Friday, Garnett announced that he would not return to the Minnesota Timberwolves, ending one of the most colorful careers in NBA history. On Monday, Pierce, currently a bench player for the Los Angeles Clippers, announced that this season would be his last.\n\nThe NBA world has already said goodbye to two other Hall of Famers. Kobe Bryant’s interminable farewell tour with the LA Lakers concluded with a phenomenally inefficient 60 point-final game, which felt perfectly fitting. A few months later, the San Antonio Spurs’ Tim Duncan quietly sent off a press release saying he had played his final game, which also felt perfectly fitting. In the career obituaries that followed, both Bryant and Duncan were praised for remaining with the same team for the entirety of their playing careers.\n\nWhile celebrating Bryant and Duncan, it was easy to contrast their careers with those of the many players who changed teams this offseason. Kevin Durant left the Oklahoma City Thunder, who he played with back when they were still the Seattle SuperSonics, to join Steph Curry and Klay Thompson in Oakland. Dwyane Wade left the Miami Heat, where he had spent his entire career, to join the Chicago Bulls, who had just traded one-time hometown hero Derrick Rose to the New York Knicks. Hours before Garnett’s announcement, word leaked that Chris Bosh, who began his career in Toronto but briefly became the face of the post-LeBron Heat, would not be medically cleared to play, effectively ending his time in Miami, if not his career.\n\nIt was Garnett and Pierce who helped usher in the current state of the NBA, albeit mostly unintentionally. After a bottoming-out season in 2006-07, followed by a disastrous lottery showing, the Boston Celtics made a bold move by trading for Garnett, then toiling with the increasingly floundering Timberwolves. Garnett only agreed to a contract extension with the Celtics after they had acquired the SuperSonics’ Allen, perhaps reasoning that two superstars alone wouldn’t be enough for them to be considered title favorites. This was a conclusion many teams would come to in the very near future.\n\nAt the time, however, there was skepticism that the New Big Three (they were nicknamed this to distinguish them from Boston’s original Big Three of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish) would gel. All three players were used to being undisputed top dogs, and it was no sure thing that they would even be able to co-exist, let alone dominate the league. Surprisingly, the three perennial all-stars clicked almost instantly, shocking experts, and even some Celtics fans, by winning a championship in the very first year of their partnership. The three of them would finally earn the first rings of their careers.\n\nIn that first year, they knocked out LeBron James’s Cavaliers by thoroughly exploiting the weakness of his supporting cast. They would again eliminate his Cavaliers in the 2010 playoffs, before falling to the Lakers in the finals. These failures directly led to James’s subsequent decision to join Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami, a partnership that led to four straight NBA finals appearances and two championships.\n\nThe Heat’s dominance inspired other teams to attempt to construct their own mega-teams, most recently the Warriors’ shockingly successful courting of Kevin Durant. James himself followed the script upon his return to Cleveland. Shortly after James made his return, the Cavaliers, almost certainly under his direction, retained Kyrie Irving but traded rookie Andrew Wiggins to the Timberwolves for established all-star forward Kevin Love. A sense of deja vu?\n\nNot that teams’ attempts to follow the Celtics/Heat model always resulted in success. The Lakers attempted to squeeze one last championship ring out of Bryant by surrounding him with a perennially disgruntled Dwight Howard and an almost entirely cooked Steve Nash. That ended poorly.\n\nIf the current state of the league is now defined by the formation of super-teams, and would-be super-teams, than Garnett OKing the Celtics trade probably marks the start of that era. At the very least, if the 2007-08 Celtics hadn’t set a precedent, The Decision, possibly the most seismic event in modern NBA history, very well could have turned out much differently.\n\nIt would be misguided to blame or praise Garnett for his role in starting this trend, however. Unlike James or Durant, Garnett didn’t leave via free agency and didn’t have much of a hand in orchestrating the deal. When Minnesota moved him, it was as much about the team, who had finally committed to rebuild, giving Garnett an opportunity to win a championship as it was about an established star trying to push his way out of town (although there are probably elements of truth in both narratives).\n\nThe Celtics’ New Big Three also wasn’t a collection of players at their peaks ready to dominate the league for years to come; it was three veteran Hall of Famers desperate to beat father time. They barely did. In 2009, Garnett suffered a knee injury that derailed the Celtics’ chances to repeat. The Celtics’ loss to the Lakers in 2010 would end up being the last time that a team without LeBron James represented the Eastern Conference in the finals, with the Heat beating the visibly ageing Celtics in both the 2011 and 2012 playoffs. After that second straight elimination, Allen took an “if you can’t beat them” approach and went to Miami, where he ended up making the biggest shot in franchise history. The New Big Three was no more.\n\nThe Celtics kept Pierce and Garnett for one more year, before trading their breaking-down stars to the Brooklyn Nets for first-round draft picks. Pierce went on with mostly undistinguished stints with the Washington Wizards and the Clippers. Garnett returned to Minnesota, taking on what was essentially a mentorship role. If there is any surprise in their retirement announcements, it might be in the fact that they stayed in the league this long.\n\nIt’s easy to contrast Garnett and Pierce with Bryant and Duncan, to cast the former as mercenaries who upset the balance of power in the NBA while romanticizing the latter as products of a bygone era where players were loyal to the teams they started with and vice-versa. That is not an entirely accurate view of history.\n\nDuncan and Bryant are, in fact, extreme aberrations. Their long runs remaining with the same team being as much accidents of history as conscious decisions on the part of the players involved. In fact, in an alternate universe, Duncan would have been the central figure in the first modern NBA superteam. In 2000, Duncan nearly made the decision to team up with Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady and sign with the Orlando Magic. And while Bryant did stay with the Lakers his entire career, it wasn’t like he was winning with a roster of homegrown talent. Bryant’s first few rings came after the Lakers signed Shaquille O’Neal from the Magic, while his later ones came after the Lakers acquired Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies. It’s easier to stay on one team when you can get the best players from other teams to come to you.\n\nThere’s no question, however, that in being part of the New Big Three, Garnett and Pierce sparked the trend of all-stars regularly joining forces to chase rings. It’s an ironic legacy for two players who were once synonymous with the teams that drafted them."
