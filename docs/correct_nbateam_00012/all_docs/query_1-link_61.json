The next guy is trying to be better than me, trying to destroy me when he sees me. For as long as I’m in this league, I’m not friends with anyone besides the 12 guys that are in this locker room.’ ”\n\nLast offseason, Garnett’s locker room changed for the second time in his career, with a trade from the Boston Celtics to the Nets. In the first 11 games Garnett has been a shadow of his former MVP self.\n\nGarnett, 37, has posted career-low averages in minutes (22.7), field-goal percentage (34), points (6.6) and assists (1.7). Those numbers pale in comparison with his MVP season of 2003-04, when he played nearly 40 minutes a game for the Wolves, shot just shy of 50 percent from the field and set career highs in points (24.2), rebounds (13.9) and blocks (2.2).\n\n“He was an absolute monster that year,” said Fred Hoiberg, Garnett’s teammate in 2003-04 and 2004-05.\n\nDespite the numbers, Hudson and Hoiberg said Garnett’s value to the Nets remains high. Mainly, it’s leadership and experience, with a championship ring earned with Boston in 2008.\n\n“He leads two ways,” said Hoiberg, the men’s basketball coach at Iowa State. “He is a great leader because he leads by example, and he is vocal, as well.”\n\nThe Nets, with the NBA’s highest payroll, are 3-8, having lost their three past games. With a first-year coach in Jason Kidd; new players in Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry; and an injury to guard Deron Williams, Brooklyn is still trying to jell.\n\nGarnett won’t stop working toward that goal, Hoiberg said.\n\n“It was always amazing to me,” he said of Garnett’s work ethic. “Kevin would play in back-to-back games (in 2003-04), where he would play 45 minutes a game and then he would be the first guy in the gym the next morning — whether he was in there shooting or in the weight room. Again, when you see a guy like that, there is a reason that you are an MVP candidate each and every year. It’s because of the way he works.”\n\nGarnett never has lost in the seven games he has played against the Wolves, the team that drafted him out of high school with the fifth pick in the 1995 draft. In those games since 2007, Garnet has averaged 14.9 points and 10.3 rebounds.\n\nWhen he returns to Target Center for the fourth time as a visitor, the Wolves expect a brisk number of walk-up sales but no sellout, said Brad Ruiter, vice president of communications.\n\nGarnett never wanted to leave Target Center, Hudson said.\n\n“Even though he knew it was going to be three or four years of rebuilding, he was still prepared to be here and be in the trenches with the Timberwolves during that time,” Hudson said.\n\nGarnett was again reluctant to be traded last offseason, according to a Sports Illustrated story. In the piece, Pierce said Garnett was close to retirement, but he was able to sell Garnett on Brooklyn.\n\n“A lot of players these days, the first sign that they can go to another team to win a championship, they are out,” Hudson said.\n\nBut not Garnett, Hudson said: “He is just a throwback player.”\n\nOriginally Published: November 20, 2013 at 11:01 p.m."
