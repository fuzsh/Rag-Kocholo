        "text": "Basketball HOFer Kevin Garnett's relationship with his former team the T’Wolves is “icy at best,” according to Gary Washburn of the BOSTON GLOBE. Garnett, whose number is still unretired by the franchise, seems to have issue with current majority owner Glen Taylor, who “is expected to relinquish his share of the team” to former MLBer Alex Rodriguez and businessman Marc Lore. But until that occurs, Garnett said that he is \"not as interested in getting his flowers from the Timberwolves or a jersey retirement.” During an interview discussing his new veem.com streaming network, Garnett said that he “remains a fan of the team,” but also “expressed disappointment in the direction of the city of Minneapolis” since the murder of George Floyd in May 2020. Garnett said when the team “takes on new ownership,” maybe he would “entertain” the idea of a retirement celebration. Garnett: “I still follow the team. I still root for the team. But I think Minneapolis has so much to deal with. I think they need to actually focus on that instead of the retirement of my jersey.” He added, \"I think the city needs to get to a balance, what I used to know it to be, as a great city to live in and a very, very great place to have a home\" (BOSTON GLOBE, 3/18).\n\nBLOCK OUT THE NOISE: When asked about the negative way fans have treated Black athletes while playing in Boston, Celtics G Jaylen Brown said he has “pretty much blocked it all out.” Brown: “It’s not the whole Celtic fan base, but it is a part of the fan base that exists within the Celtic nation that is problematic. If you have a bad game, they tie it to your personal character.” Brown said he “definitely think there’s a group or an amount within the Celtic nation” that is “extremely toxic and does not want to see athletes use their platform.” Brown added “they just want you to play basketball and entertain and go home. And that’s a problem to me” (N.Y. TIMES, 3/17)."
