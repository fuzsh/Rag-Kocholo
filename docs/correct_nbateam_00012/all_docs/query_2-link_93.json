        "text": "Down 14 points with less than nine minutes to go in the fourth quarter, the situation looked bleak for the Boston Celtics last night.\n\nHedo Turkoglu was alternately hitting improbable shots and dishing to open teammates like Dwight “Superman” Howard for three-point plays. The Celtics’ offense was like a buggy mired in a ditch. The anxiety in the crowd at the TD Banknorth Garden-having grown up in the area, I still have to fight my impulse to write ‘the Garden’-was palpable.\n\nThe game, and very possibly, the season, hung in the balance.\n\nEnter Stephon Marbury.\n\nHitting a combination of jumpers, a three-point shot from international waters and a conventional three-point play in which he attacked the Defensive Player of the Year Howard in the lane and threw the ball off the glass for a layup, Marbury scored all of his 12 points in the fourth quarter and provided a much-needed spark to the Celtics’ offense.\n\nMarbury’s play was a key element in a comeback that culminated in a gritty92-88 victory and gave the Celtics a 3-2 lead heading back to Orlando.\n\nThe undeniably talented Marbury-even with his declining output during the past four years, he still sports career averages of 19 points and 7.7 assists per game- has often been pilloried as the embodiment of the self-absorbed, me-first player whose teams inevitably improve after he leaves them.\n\nHere in Chicago, Youtube video sensation MrChiCity3 recently mocked the tattoo on Marbury’s head, and STATS Inc. noted recently that his time with the Celtics marked the first time in his career that his team had advanced past the first round of the playoffs.\n\nBy all accounts, Marbury has been a solid citizen in his stint with the Celtics. Since joining the team in March, in fact, he has been more notable for his reluctance, rather than willingness, to shoot.\n\nI wrote at that time about two books in which Marbury figures prominently: Darcy Frey’s The Last Shot: City Streets, Basketball Dreams; and Ian O’Connor’s The Jump: Sebastian Telfair and the High Stakes Business of High School Ball.\n\nBoth are worth another mention.\n\nIn The Last Shot, Marbury is an entering freshman at Lincoln High School, on the cusp of continuing the line of New York City high school point guard legends-a lineage that includes Dwayne “Pearl” Washington, Kenny “The Jet” Smith, and Mark Jackson, among others. Frey focuses his attention on three other, less gifted players from Coney Island, showing at base how these and other young men have concluded that basketball, rather than school, is the only viable option for them out of the community.\n\nUp to that point, no basketball player from Coney Island had hit the big time.\n\nO’Connor’s book picks up the story years later with Telfair about to enter his senior year at Lincoln High School and vacillating between declaring himself eligible for the NBA draft or running the point for Rick Pitino’s Louisville Cardinals. Telfair’s cousin, Marbury is portrayed as petulant and jealous, even as he and “Bassy” do have a reconciliation late in the book.\n\nIn March, I wrote,\n\n“While The Last Shot is a better written book, The Jump sheds more light on Marbury’s adult personality.\n\nTaken together, these works would appear to offer little reason for optimism that the Celtics have made the right decision in taking on Marbury.\n\nAnd yet they are banking on the locker room leadership of Garnett, CaptainPaul Pierce and Ray Allento hold Marbury to account as well as Marbury’s knowledge that, for him, this could easily be his last shot.\n\nThe last quarter of the regular season starts today.”\n\nMarbury and the Celtics still need another win to advance to the conference finals for the second consecutive year.\n\nThe young and hungry Orlando team will unquestionably be looking to make a statement that last night’s victory was a fluke. Led by recently crowned MVP LeBron James, the well-rested and undefeated Cleveland Cavaliers await the certainly weary victors. The West will certainly bring a worthy opponent, too.\n\nIn short, the transformation for Stephon Marbury from NBA miscreant to role player on a repeat champion is uncertain and far from complete.\n\nAnd yet, hoops lovers across the world would be remiss if they did not stop for a minute and notice the budding change in the Coney Island native that occurred on the Garden floor last night.\n\nGame 6 tips off tomorrow night.\n\nDunreith and I are heading back to Chicago today.\n\nIt’s been a rich weekend, filled with food, family and connection.\n\nMeghan and Maureen got married in a brief and elegant ceremony followed by an emotion-laden reception with plenty of wine, laughter, tears and a wide assortment of appetizers from risotto to short ribs.\n\nMy brother-in-law Josh and nephew Jacob initiated me into the ways of The White Hut, a greasy spoon with heaping portions of caramel fried onions, razor-thin burgers and instantly cooked hot dogs.\n\nJacob gave me the initial briefing on how to order decisively and incompletely-you ask for condiments besides the fried onions after the initial request-while Josh informed me about the lettuce, tomato and onions many are not aware are available to them.\n\nAnd Dunreith and I took several lengthy walks through Longmeadow, a classic New England town, with a village green, plenty of homes from the late 1700s and, in a conscious decision, no industrial development.\n\nI also caught large parts of the Celtics-Cavaliers game on Friday night, when the Celtics essentially held home court in pushing back the Cavs, 105-94.\n\nThe victory not only pulled the C’s into a virtual tie with the Cavaliers for the best record in Eastern Conference, the team showed grit in winning without the injured Kevin Garnett, and, for the last quarter and a half, Glen “Big Baby” Davis, who was ejected after a clothesline of Anderson Varejao that sparked memories of Kevin McHale’s takedown of Kurt Rambis in the 1984 NBA Finals.\n\nNewest Celtic Stephon Marbury played an important role in the Celtics’ victory Friday night, hitting a jumper during a decisive fourth quarter run. The mercurial “Starbury” has been the subject of much scrutiny before his arrival on the team, with many citing his teams’ losing records and his destructive influence in the clubhouse as reasons for the Celtics not to take him.\n\nThus far the relationship seems to be mutually beneficial. Marbury has joined a team on which he can actually play and the Celtics have experienced backup help for Rajon Rondo.\n\nReaders wanting to learn more about Marbury should go to Darcy Frey’s The Last Shot: City Streets, Basketball Dreams, a searching and arresting profile of Coney Island and an America in which many black men determine that their only legitimate route to success and fulfillment is through basketball.\n\nFrey spends much of a summer and the first half of a school year in the early 90s following three high school players. Russell, Corey and Tchaka all live in Coney Island, a down and out community rife with poverty, crime and drugs that has produced plenty of talent, but no professionals. Marbury, the youngest of the group, is the latest in the neighborhood and even his family to carry collective dreams on his young and highly talented shoulders.\n\nFrey brilliantly weaves descriptions of the neighborhood’s history, individual profiles of the players-the easy going Corey is physically gifted but more of a ladies’ man, while the deadly serious Russell practices relentlessly and is haunted by the razor-thin margin between success and failure-and the shamelessly self-serving and exploitative tactics adopted by college colleges. Frey opens one chapter with a monologue by Hall of Fame coach Jim Boeheim which includes the mention of almost all the possible advantages of a Syracuse University education except, of course, the education itself.\n\nMarbury is presented as enormously gifted, highly comfortable using the status that accrues from his talent and also aware that he is not just playing for himself, but for siblings like Eric Marbury, who attended the University of Georgia with Dominique Wilkins but whose career fizzled out. Frey does an impressive job of creating sympathetic portraits of these young men who, because of their circumstances, are denied the ability at most points to simply play and enjoy the game.\n\nFrey’s introduction to Marbury is picked up years later in Ian O’Connor’s The Jump: Sebastian Telfair and the High Stakes Business of High School Ball.\n\nAs its title suggests, this book focuses on Telfair, Marbury’s younger, and some say even more talented, cousin, during his senior year at Lincoln High School. Like Marbury, Telfair is another in the line of remarkable New York City point guards. Like his older relative, Telfair must carry the weight of other people’s expectations. And, like Marbury, “Bassy” must navigate through a neighborhood with plenty of distractions and obstacles and must decided whether to go straight to the pros or play for Rick Pitino and his Louisville Cardinals for a year.\n\nThe Marbury of The Jump is well onto his way to becoming the Starbury on whom so much criticism has been heaped. Petty, jealous and insecure, Marbury is shown to be unwilling to provide guidance to his younger cousin, in part because Telfair beat him in games of one-on-one. The two have a rapprochement before the book’s end, but the unflattering impression of Marbury remains.\n\nWhile The Last Shot is a better written book, The Jump sheds more light on Marbury’s adult personality.\n\nTaken together, these works would appear to offer little reason for optimism that the Celtics have made the right decision in taking on Marbury.\n\nAnd yet they are banking on the locker room leadership of Garnett, CaptainPaul Pierce and Ray Allen to hold Marbury to account as well as Marbury’s knowledge that, for him, this could easily be his last shot.\n\nThe last quarter of the regular season starts today.\n\nI’m still here in Western Massachusetts, very excited about Meghan and Maureen’s wedding , and eager to go with Jacob and Sarah for my initial experience at West Springfield’s The White Hut, a legendary hamburger and hot dog joint. I’ve been told I don’t need to shower before as I’ll be drenched in the sweet smell of grease afterward!\n\nHere are a couple of books for those feeling the Massachusetts, and, more specifically, Western Massachusetts, love:\n\n1. House, by Tracy Kidder. I wrote earlier this week about Among Schoolchildren, the book that chronicled a year in the life of Christine Zajac’s fifth-grade classroom in Holyoke, Massachusetts. House masterfully tells the story of the process of designing and building a house in Northampton.\n\nWarning: this work is not for recent home builders, as it is likely to trigger post-traumatic house disorder.\n\nKidder’s panoptic abilities are on full display here, as he shows the push and pull between the owners, the architect, the contractor and his workers. The scene at the book’s end, when the house is finally built, the owners are ecstatic and the contractor’s melancholy sets in as he realizes how little he has made, is nearly perfect, and there are plenty of other gems that come before.\n\n2. Top of the World: The Inside Story of the Boston Celtics’ Amazing One-Year Turnaround to Become NBA Champions, by Peter May.\n\nThis breezy book by longtime Boston Globe sportswriter Peter May covers the historic turnaround and championship run of last year’s Boston Celtics team. As has been well-chronicled, the team defied the odds and beat the Kobe Bryant-led and heavily favored Los Angeles Lakers for the C’s record 17th championship.\n\nMay, who wrote an earlier book about the 1986 Celtics, which he argued was the best team of all time, provides a lot of familiar, and some not so familiar, material in this book.\n\nWhile the death of coach Glenn ‘Doc’ Rivers’ father and the maneuverings of General Manager Danny Ainge to bring ‘The Big Three’ had been thoroughly discussed, I had not known that Kevin Garnett had spent much of his senior year at Chicago’s Farragut High School on his own.\n\nMay’s game descriptions of the game lack drama and you feel that his heart is still will Larry Bird and the rest of the original ‘Big Three.’ Still, for those looking for a charge as the Celtics makes this year’s push for the playoffs and seek to retain their crown, Top of the World is a quick and enjoyable read."
