        "text": "All four Boston major sports teams — the Red Sox, Patriots, Celtics and Bruins — have won championships since the turn of the century.\n\nThe Patriots have won six, the Red Sox four, the Celtics two and Bruins one. Which one captured the hearts of the region the most? It's your time to vote and decide.\n\nPlease read on for a look at the titles we highlight and scroll down to find our poll and vote for your favorite. Voting will continue until midnight on Thursday, July 18. We'll announce the winner on Friday, July 19.\n\n2004 Boston Red Sox - Boston beats St. Louis Cardinals, 4-0 in World Series\n\nTrailing the rival New York Yankees 3-0 in the American League Championship Series, the Red Sox win the next four games and advance to the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nThe Red Sox the sweep the Cardinals in four games, and win their first World Series title since 1918, a span of 86 years.\n\n2001-02 New England Patriots – Super Bowl XXXVI – a 20-17 win over the St. Louis Rams\n\nNot much was expected from the Patriots in 2001. They were coming off a last-place finish in the AFC East in 2000, Bill Belichick’s first year as head coach. The Patriots signed quarterback Drew Bledsoe to a 10-year contract extension in March 2001.\n\nBut the former No. 1 draft pick was injured in the second game of the season, sending an unknown second-year quarterback Tom Brady onto the field. The Patriots lost to the Jets in Week 2, and fell to 0-2. Brady started the next 14 games, and all the Patriots did was go 11-3 and earn the No. 2 seed in the AFC playoffs.\n\nThe playoffs started with a 16-13 overtime win over the Oakland Raiders in the infamous “Tuck Rule” game, the final game at Foxboro Stadium. Wins over Pittsburgh in the AFC Championship and St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl brought the Lombardi Trophy to Foxboro for the first time in franchise history.\n\n2013 Boston Red Sox - Boston beats St. Louis Cardinals, 4-2, in World Series\n\nThe Red Sox were coming off a dismal season in 2012, when they went 69-93, prompting the firing of manager Bobby Valentine and bringing in former pitching coach John Farrell as his replacement. The team brought in veterans like Johnny Gomes, Mike Napoli, David Ross and Shane Victorino in the off-season.\n\nThe Red Sox were inspired to play for the city after the tragic bombings at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. The Red Sox won the AL East with a record of 97-65, beat the Tampa Bay Rays in the ALDS, the Detroit Tigers in the ALCS, and the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series.\n\n2007-08 Boston Celtics - Boston beats Los Angeles Lakers, 4-2, in NBA Finals\n\nThe Boston Celtics formed a new Big Three with Paul Pierce, thanks to offseason trades for Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett. It was their first “Big Three” since the Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish era.\n\nThe Celtics went 66-16 in the regular season, and then beat the Atlanta Hawks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons and Los Angeles to win the 17th championship in franchise history.\n\n2010-11 Boston Bruins - Boston beats Vancouver, 4-3, in Stanley Cup Finals\n\nThe Bruins had gone 38 years since winning a Stanley Cup championship before the magical 2010-11 season. The Bruins, led by captains Zdeno Chara, Patrice Bergeron and Mark Recchi, and 35 wins by goalie Tim Thomas, went 46-25-11 in the regular season. It was good enough to win the Northeast Division and was third in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe Bruins faced rival and fellow Original 6 franchise Montreal in the first round of the playoffs, winning that series in a seventh-and-deciding game. The Bruins then continued their playoff dominance with series wins over Philadelphia and Tampa Bay before beating Vancouver in another seven-game series; their third of the postseason. The only series that did not go the distance was against Philadelphia, which Boston swept in four games.\n\n2014-15 New England Patriots – Super Bowl XLIX – a 28-24 win over the Seattle Seahawks\n\nWho can forget Malcolm Butler’s improbable interception in the end zone? Seattle trailed the Patriots, 28-24, with 26 seconds left, but had the ball on a second-and-goal from the New England 1-yard line. Rather than handing the ball off to running back Marshawn Lynch, quarterback Russell Wilson threw the ball, resulting in Butler’s interception.\n\n2016-17 New England Patriots – Super Bowl LI – a 34-28 overtime win over the Atlanta Falcons\n\nThis was the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history as the Patriots trailed 28-3 late in the third quarter. New England the next 28 points, winning on James White’s 2-yard touchdown run in overtime. The Patriots' only lead came on the final play of the game.\n\nOther championships in chronological order\n\nThere have been so many Boston championships since 2000 we couldn't include them all in our poll. Here's a look at the rest:\n\n2003 New England Patriots – Super Bowl XXXVIII – 32-29 win over the Carolina Panthers\n\n2004 New England Patriots – Super Bowl XXXIX – a 24-21 win over the Philadelphia Eagles\n\n2018 Boston Red Sox – 4-1 over the Los Angeles Dodgers\n\n2018 New England Patriots – Super Bowl LII – a 13-3 win over the Los Angeles Rams\n\n2024 Boston Celtics – 4-1 over the Dallas Mavericks"
