        "text": "TJ Ford: Man, for me personally, you never forget it. ‘Could you play Syracuse again, what would happen, would we have gone to the National Championship?’ or ‘What if a team played us man-to-man?’ We might have won a championship if we hadn’t faced a hot Syracuse team. But to be able to go back 21 years and feel the impact of that game between myself and Carmelo Anthony in the 2003 Final Four. Man, it stands the test of time and there’s still show footage that comes out every year. Feels like it was yesterday; a lot of people remember it.\n\nObviously, being from Texas, a Longhorn, it’s something embedded into our culture, it’s who we are. That Final Four team, and hopefully, the University’s program can help get that feeling going again of going to the Final Four with a chance to win the national championship. Best time of the year, you know, and to still be relevant forever. And today, I just think it’s a huge blessing for all of us to go back down memory lane.\n\nTF: I came into college with this health condition, spinal stenosis, the narrowing of the spinal cord. So, I was seeing doctors right away; I was having some symptoms, but you know, after a little period of months, I felt those symptoms went away and, you know, I was scared to have surgery going into my freshman year that summer. But I decided at the last couple of hours before it was time for me to go in. I asked my Coach Rick Barnes that I felt healthy and that I didn’t need the surgery, more out of fear. And he was like ‘Okay,’ which I wasn’t really expecting a successful career. And then to not have any problems in college… I took some, I took more nasty falls in college than I did in the NBA, but just being able to overcome it, I mean, I had to prove to myself that I could be one of the best basketball players in the world.\n\nAnd it was just a goal of mine that I wanted to chase. That was the thrill of trying to get to that gold status of being labeled and recognized as one of the best to ever play the game\n\nTF: Well, yeah. So, what happened was I started to feel tingling in my neck, shoulders, and down to my arm. It basically caused tingling and numbness, lasting maybe 10 minutes at a time. This went on for about two or three weeks right before I graduated high school. So, you know, I was dealing with those symptoms, and I just felt like I was aware. At the same time, I think it didn’t change much. I mean, I’m not a big guy anyway. So the odds of trying to be one of the best players in the world were slim to none, right? In hindsight, that was the focus, that was the desire and nothing would have stopped me from trying to reach that.\n\nTF: I think it’s always special playing against your idols. Iverson was a guy I was just excited to play against. So I don’t think I slept the night before, just so excited that I was going to be playing against somebody that I feel like I mirrored my game after and had a lot of similarities with.\n\nI mean, in the East, we had Stephon Marbury, Jason Kidd, Derrick Rose, Gilbert Arenas, Jameer Nelson. Mike Bibby was in the East too. You know, obviously when you look at the Cavs you had Kyrie Irving, Boobie Gibson, you had Mo Williams, man, the East was tough every night. To be able to face Chauncey Billups, I mean, you had a tough night every night, and those guys you knew were going to bring their A-game.\n\nAnd, you know, for me, it was about trying to gain respect, you know? So for me, I get that question every night; I was at a disadvantage. So, man, I enjoyed that. I think the ultimate goal as a player is to have the respect of your peers. And I feel like, you know, I was able to do that at all levels of basketball.\n\nTF: I mean, he was a good listener. He put in good work. And I think those are the things that he gave me but the work ended with the desire to stay in the gym and get better.\n\nI think he was definitely a sponge as a rookie. I didn’t need to tell him, ‘Listen, you know,’ he was always in the gym, working hard. And he was able to step into a role a lot earlier than most rookies because of Danny Granger’s injury. And he took full advantage of his skills, continuing to grow and develop.\n\nI think his confidence, when you look at his rookie year, coming in and being behind guys and being able to see what it is, and then it’s an opportunity to have the keys to the game and to become who you are. And you need mentors to be able to do that in the league.\n\nAnd I think he’s been one of the best talents. When I look at his injury and all that he went through, man, that was one of the most brutal injuries, and for him to come back, to still be an All-Star, to still be one of the faces of the league, still being able to develop his game, continue to get better, to have the respect of his peers and everybody.\n\nTo have Paul George in GOAT conversations with this younger generation shows his impact and style and how much he has improved as a basketball player to be able to have kids around the world saying, ‘You are one of the Top 5 best players to ever play this game.’\n\nTF: In my two years and my time on the Raptors, I thought I was at my best, both for my basketball skills and my physical condition, enabling my growth in efficiency and effectiveness. And then having this crazy combination of this guard position.\n\nI think Jose Calderon and I were kind of one of the first duos to have this impact where it didn’t matter, and the statistics were the same with different styles. We were able to turn the Raptors organization around, win the division title, make it to the playoffs, and create some unforgettable memories.\n\nWhen I look at the guys on the team, a lot of them had success and won championships in other places. But when I look at that team, we were really close. We spent a lot of time together with guys who really understood basketball and helped take my game to the next level by facilitating.\n\nI mean, with most of those guys, in today’s game, we would have had a lot of success. And when I look at the teammates that I had, a lot of us are doing amazing things post-career. And I think part of that comes from our time spent in Toronto. We really clicked. I talk with my friends all the time; that Raptors team, if you put them in today’s generation, I think they would seamlessly work.\n\nYou’ve got Andrea Bargnani, who would be shooting threes, or you’ve got Anthony Parker, who’s like that versatile player you need for today’s game at the forward spot. You’ve got Calderon, who’s going to be that one-two punch down the court with me, and then you’ve got [Chris] Bosh, who would be a beast in today’s game. That roster that was put together, we shot the ball well and we were probably ahead of our time. We wanted to play like Phoenix, get it up and down, and have shooters do it. We had the personnel. Man, we were one of the best three-point shooting teams at that time, so I can only imagine how we would perform in today’s game.\n\nTF: The game continues to evolve, and I think when we look at the personnel and what Steph Curry was able to do, and when you look at the next generation, you can see what can happen.\n\nYou’ve got Luka Doncic, you’ve got a lot of these big guards. And I think the defensive principles have changed in the NBA, right? We still have concepts, teams use different defensive schemes and I think what’s happened, you know, in my era, with bad teams, they were the ones that only switched on pick and roll, right, they were the bad teams.\n\nBut now, everybody’s good. So when you look at this, you have to ask yourself, can you shoot the ball? Can you get your shot off? Can you finish at the basket? So I think nowadays, it’s just not feeling like guys my size aren’t that much more effective at being able to dominate a big guy when you have to go one-on-one.\n\nTF: There are two guys right now for me. I think there’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in Oklahoma City. Being able to watch him with his length, his pace, he dominates guys in so many different ways. He can shoot the basketball well, has a good mid-range, and he’s strong driving to the basket.\n\nHis game is beautiful. It’s a beautiful game that he plays with fun. Watching him play, watching him be able to elevate guys who didn’t have a high profile, he has these guys playing at an extreme level. And then when you look at Anthony Edwards, his competitiveness kind of reminds me of Kevin Garnett as a guy who is going to give you something funny when he talks. He’s very interesting. He gives good comments, he gives good soundbites. He’s passionate about the game of basketball. He’s proved he loves basketball, displaying that with fire and excitement. You know, I’m all for guys taking a program or taking an organization to a higher level and being a one-man group, being able to change the perspective and idea of what we feel about those teams.\n\nAnd now when you look at OKC, you look at that as, ‘Oh yeah, these guys got a chance to be routinely good.’ So those are the two young guys that I like. Good, sexy games and has the ultimate competitiveness. And that’s what I love about both of those guys.\n\nTF: It was fun to be back. I had a great time collaborating, we had to reenact with Anthony and [Kendrick] Perkins. I mean, it was a lot of fun. You go back to the days and talk about the stories. AT&T is a global company that works with a lot of people around the world, so the views and being able to have that brand and have that relationship with AT&T more so than, to show any that can happen, you know, a Cinderella story, and tell stories of efforts here to keep to that."
