        "text": "Scores 12 points in Summer League\n\nEven with an off night from three-point land, Scheierman was able to make a positive impact Wednesday. He led the Celtics in rebounds and was one of four players to score in double figures. However, he isn't likely to factor into the Celtics nightly rotation during regular-season play.\n\nInks Exhibit 10 deal with Boston\n\nHarper spent the 2023-24 season as a two-way player for Toronto, but was waived in December after undergoing season-ending surgery on his left shoulder. He's since recovered from the procedure and logged three points and a block across 10 minutes with the Celtics' Summer League team Saturday. Harper's Exhibit 10 deal will earn him an invite to training camp and gives Boston his G league rights..\n\nTo replace Kawhi on Team USA\n\nWith Leonard bowing out of the Olympics earlier Wednesday, Team USA was in need of a replacement and quickly settled on White, who was one of the better two-way guards in the NBA last season. The 30-year-old started all 73 of his appearances for Boston, posting 15.2 points, 5.2 assists, 4.2 rebounds, 1.0 steals and 1.2 blocks per game while shooting 39.6 percent from three on nearly seven attempts per game. While White does not have any previous Olympic experience, he was a member of Team USA's roster for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup."
