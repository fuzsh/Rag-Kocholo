        "text": "Alright, so, we’re going to have to wait a while to watch the Boston Celtics play basketball again. There’s a whopping eight days remaining before Game 1 of the NBA Finals on June 6.\n\nAs much as it has felt like an expectation this season, it truly is a privilege to see your team play well enough to make the Finals. We’ve all become a bit spoiled over the past seven or eight seasons. A lot of fanbases would kill for the prolonged playoff runs that the Celtics have been putting together.\n\nBeing this deep into the postseason really drums up memories of the first time I remember there being buzz around the Celtics. In the summer of 2007, Boston made trades to build “The Big 3.” Danny Ainge brought in Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen to help Paul Pierce hang Banner 17.\n\nAlong with those trades, we got this absolute banger of an NBA commercial, the “I Remember” ad with Garnett’s arrival as the centerpiece.\n\nThe ad does a tremendous job of presenting the sheer impact that the news of Garnett had on the fanbase. After several seasons of subpar hoops, the Cs were back and ready to continue their winning ways. Plus, the use of Badfinger’s “Day After Day” is iconic.\n\nFans (yes, they’re actors) can be seen reacting to the news in real-time, as they learn of KG’s arrival on TV and the radio.\n\nThere’s a sense of community here. Everyone is in it together, they’ve been through years of awful teams, and can’t wait to win again.\n\nThey’ll never forget where they were when they learned about “The Big Ticket.”\n\nI’m sure some of you reading this probably remember exactly where you were when you heard the news.\n\nI was nine and wasn’t into basketball yet. All I remember is seeing this on TV and thinking it rocked.\n\nThe origin of the 2023-24 Celtics team is similar to that of the 2008 team.\n\nSure, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are both homegrown superstars just like Paul Pierce, but Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday have proven to be massive off-season additions.\n\nMuch like the fans in the KG commercial, I remember where I was when both trades were reported.\n\nI was at the movies, seeing “The Flash” by myself (going to the movies alone is underrated, you have to try it) when I had learned that Porzingis was going to be a member of the Celtics. I was in bed when I found out that it was going to cost Marcus Smart to bring him in.\n\nI remember being at a stoplight on my way to the gym when I got the notification about Holiday being traded to Boston. I had to turn around to go home and record a breaking “How ‘Bout Them Celtics” video with Jack Simone.\n\nBoth moves have had a tremendous impact on the Celtics’ success this season. Porzingis has given them an extra layer on offense with his post presence while offering rim protection on the other end. As for Holiday, his commitment to doing whatever the team needs from him has gone a long way.\n\nRealistically, the NBA could have literally remade this commercial ahead of the current season. It works, all of the pieces are there, it just would’ve been a little different.\n\nIf this ad were to be recreated today, there would just be a bunch of people getting Woj or Shams notifications on their phones. Maybe you’d have a few younger fans breaking news to their parents who aren’t as online, but just about everyone would be finding out it the same way.\n\nIt’s pretty funny because looking back on it, there was some foreshadowing of how transactions would become a major part of NBA fandom. The trade deadline and free agency have become massive events, where fans sit and wait to see which players will be headed to a new home.\n\nThe impact still remains the same. As much as scarring from past seasons has gotten in the way of fully enjoying it, this year’s Celtics team has been a joy to cover and support."
