Speaking about his unique relationship with the fans, and how he would feed off of their energy, the legendary big man outlined how the high expectations of Celtics fans fueled his title hunt.\n\n“I heard Larry Bird say one time in his early years in Boston is that the reason why he loved playing in front of the fans in Boston is because you couldn’t fake them,” Garnett shared."
