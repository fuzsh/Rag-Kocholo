        "text": "It is wholesome when former legends acknowledge the next generation. Minnesota Timberwolves legend, Kevin Garnett did something similar recently. The 2008 NBA Champion appreciated Gilbert Arena’s son’s performance in one of his recent high school matches.\n\nTaking to his official Instagram account, Garnett shared some highlights from Alijah Arenas’ recent high-school match in his Instagram story. “Shout to the young buh Alijah @alijah0arenas and Gil @no.chill.gil… We see the work bro,” read the caption to the story. The video in the Insta story showed Alijah making some impressive jump shots.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Alijah’s recent performance has made him the one to look out for in the future. In fact, he recently broke the California state championship scoring record. Playing for Chatsworth, he scored 17 field goals in the finals against Monterey, thus breaking the Division IV record for field goals made in a final, which was earlier with Shon Traver at 12 field goals in 1990.\n\nThe 16-year-old sophomore also broke Traver’s record of the highest score in a single game in Division IV by scoring 44 points as compared to Traver’s 35. These impressive feats at such a young age assure a promising future for the teenager.\n\nRead More: Despite Beaming With Pride, Gilbert Arenas’ 15YO Son Fails to Gain NBA Veteran’s Trust\n\nNext generation of NBA Stars who are likely to follow their father’s footsteps\n\nThe first, and the only name on the list who has a chance of playing NBA alongside his father, is USC guard Bronny James. LeBron James is still an active player who made his NBA debut at the age of 18. His son is already 19 and if the King could just pull out some more years, the duo may just become the first father-son duo to play professional basketball alongside each other.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAnother popular name to lookout for is Carmelo Anthony‘s son, Kiyan Anthony. The 17-year-old player often remains in media headlines. He ranks number 38 overall in the Class of 2025 by 247Sports. In fact, he managed to get 13 Division I offers from top institutions like Tennessee, Pittsburgh, Indiana, Florida State, and his father’s alma mater, Syracuse.\n\nOne of the best combo guards, Allen Iverson, is also among the NBA stars who’d be looking forward to their next generation to have a similar or greater impact than they did. And Iverson’s son, Jordan Lowery, may just make his father’s aspiration come true. He is already considered a promising point guard. Some other names on the list include DJ Rodman, Zaire Wade, Jamal Mashburn Jr and many others.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nRead More: Better Than Bronny and Bryce James? 6’5 Son of Ex-NBA All-Star Poised to Eclipse LeBron’s Heirs\n\nWhat is your opinion of this upcoming generation of players? Let us know in the comments who you think has the most likely chance of making it big in the NBA."
