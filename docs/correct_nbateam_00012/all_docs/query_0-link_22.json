        "text": "There have been odd criticisms of what star Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum did when the camera turned to him moments after the Celtics finally broke through to win Banner 18. But the man perhaps best known for any such post-title comments sees the situation very differently.\n\nWe are of course talking about Hall of Fame Boston big man Kevin Garnett, whose famous “ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!” scream has been burned in the league’s collective consciousness. Speaking on a recent episode of his Showtime Basketball “KG Certified” podcast, The Big Ticket gave his take on Tatum’s crowning achievement, and how he saw it.\n\n“When I saw Jayson Tatum in the moment he did his ‘We Did It,’ he looked like he got it,” said Garnett. “It’s the culmination of all of the stuff to get there.”\n\n“Real (expletive), when … Tatum did the ‘We did it’ moment that to me felt like it all clicked for him,” added KG. “It was a rush of visualizing all of the trials and tribulations over the years to get to this point.”\n\n“The C’s ain’t no microwave made team, this was a team that has been built and molded for years now. This is the process it takes to build championship DNA lord, and they’re just getting started.”\n\nListen to the “Celtics Lab” podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3F9DvjQ"
