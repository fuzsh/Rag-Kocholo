        "text": "Layup lines breed frivolity and pre-game looseness.\n\nSecond-year player Rajon Rondo found out early that Kevin Garnett hated the lollygagging.\n\nFrustrated by the pace, one night the new Celtics star leaned into Rondo, the teammate in front of him. As Rondo remembers it, “He bumped the (bleep) out of me.\n\n“I was like, what the hell, but KG never looked at me, he just kept moving, serious. A lot of people kind of (bullbleep) around in the layup line, but that was his time to get ready. He never shot before the game. Where he got it was in the layup line.”\n\nGarnett’s standards, which raised those of his Celtics teammates like a seven-foot, 240-pound magnet, became Rondo’s. Though not easy on all young players – stories abound of the star turning his back on disappointing youngsters – Garnett liked Rondo before they ever played together.\n\nBut when the first serious report of Garnett’s trade to the Celtics hit during the summer of 2007, Rondo caught his breath and worried that he was headed the other way.\n\n“I was definitely in the trade talk. I saw my name on the TV at first,” he said. “That summer I thought I was going to Minnesota, but I found out that KG wanted me to stay there.\n\n“God works in mysterious ways, and him speaking up and saying he wanted me as his point guard meant a lot. Obviously my career is where it is. Otherwise I don’t know where I was going to be. He’s always got my blessing and support in anything he does.”\n\nThe mutual trust was almost immediate. Garnett talked to Rondo in a frank way that not many others could. Rondo still thinks back to the 2011 conference semifinals against Miami, when he lost his temper during a critique-laden off-day video session that devolved into a shouting match with Doc Rivers.\n\nAn angry Rondo threw a bottle at the video screen, broke it, and stormed out in an incident first reported by the Herald’s Steve Bulpett. Garnett, the mediator in this situation, called Rondo that night.\n\n“He’s the one guy that called me and said you know what? You (bleeped) up. I see your point, but you were wrong,” said Rondo. “Having that kind of intervention on the team, that kind of big brother who holds you accountable, loves you when you’re right, loves you when you’re wrong, gives you the chance to grow as a person, step back and look at it, and I WAS wrong. He has an unbiased opinion – it was true, because he wants the best for me.\n\n“The next day I came in and apologized to the team, had a one-on-one talk with Doc and we moved forward.”\n\nIt occasionally occurs to Rondo now that he’s the last man standing from the 2008 Celtics.\n\n“Especially on the team I’m on now – guys close to my kids’ age are my teammates now,” said the 36-year-old Cavaliers point guard, now on his 10th NBA stop (and ninth team).\n\nRondo continues to bring immense value as a no-nonsense veteran with tremendous longevity and knowledge.\n\n“There’s a reason Rondo’s still playing,” said Rivers. “It’s his talent and IQ, but also the Kevin Garnett effect.”\n\nThough he technically has the day off – Cleveland has back-to-back games on March 11 and 12 – Rondo wasn’t sure he’d be able to attend when Garnett’s No. 5 gets hoisted to the rafters on Sunday March 13 following the Celtics’ game against Dallas.\n\nBut in a ceremony expected to have a number of “mystery” guests, all will have recollections of the Hall-of-Famer most responsible for what remains the greatest one-season turnaround (42 wins) in NBA history – from a 24-win team to 66 and the NBA title.\n\n“The guy’s amazing, man. I know he’s not going to go down as a Top 10 player all-time, but you talk about Brady, Jordan, even LeBron, those elite guys who are mentally different – KG is just mentally different,” said Brian Scalabrine. “Everything you wanted in a winner, a leader, he just checked every box.\n\n“From Day 1, (2007-08) preseason, everywhere he went everybody would just stand a little bit taller – this is how it works for him. There’s been a few times where I met people where it was like wow, there’s something about him. Michael Jordan was one, in a weird way Lute Olsen when I was in high school was one of them. It never went away, even though every single day with KG, it was the same way – just different.”\n\nThe turnaround\n\nThe 2006-07 season had grown interminable that February day Danny Ainge walked into the weight room in the Celtics’ Waltham practice facility.\n\nMisfortune had rolled in with the death of Red Auerbach from a heart attack the previous October. During one demoralizing stretch that included a franchise-record 18-game losing streak, the Celtics won three times in 42 games after Paul Pierce went down with a left foot stress reaction. From that point the Celtics captain, who only played in 47 games, became a whisper, often rehabbing away from the team.\n\nTony Allen stepped up in Pierce’s absence, put together a string of six 20-plus games, and in the seventh, after scoring 19 points in his first 33 minutes on the Garden floor against Indiana, tore his left ACL and MCL during an uncontested dunk attempt, directly in front of the Celtics’ new owners, Wyc Grousbeck and Steve Pagliuca. And then Ainge’s beloved former teammate, Dennis Johnson, died of a heart attack on Feb. 22 while coaching the Austin Toros – the Celtics’ D-League affiliate.\n\nSo it was with a heavy but defiant spirit that the Celtics general manager walked into the weight room. Already past the midway point of a season headed for the high lottery – even there the popcorn machine would later render the worst possible result, the fifth overall pick – Leon Powe and his teammates quietly lifted.\n\n“The fans were in an uproar a little bit. They wanted to see some winning basketball and we couldn’t blame them,” Powe recalls. “Everybody either wanted to get rid of the coach, or a lot of the players, what we gonna do?\n\n“And I remember Danny came down to the weight room and told everybody y’all going to play hard, but we’re not getting rid of Doc, he’s a great coach. But I will fix this, and then he left. We all just looked at each other, and agreed, somebody’s leaving if we don’t start doing something. Somebody’s leaving sooner or later, and I don’t know who it is. But somebody’s leaving.”\n\nAinge did indeed fix the problem, with the personnel move of his career. He parlayed Wally Szczerbiak, Delonte West and that draft pick, which became Jeff Green, into a trade to Seattle for Ray Allen. Allen’s arrival in turn convinced Garnett, up to now not interested in the Celtics because of their mediocrity, that the time was finally good to join Pierce, his friend since adolescence. He agreed to be traded for multiple players, with Al Jefferson the most notable Celtic heading west.\n\nThe role players flocked in, starting in short order with the summer signings of Eddie House and James Posey – the latter a key role player in Miami’s 2006 title run. The All-Star trio of Garnett, Pierce and Allen talked P.J. Brown out of retirement while visiting the veteran center’s hometown of New Orleans during the 2008 All-Star weekend. Sam Cassell, bought out by the Clippers that March, turned down several offers to rejoin his old Timberwolves teammate, now in a Celtics uniform.\n\n“It was the intensity and the heat, the intensity and the heat in the locker room. And we had so much fun,” Cassell, now on Rivers’ coaching staff in Philadelphia, said of the KG effect. “We did everything together. Eight guys going to dinner, and two of the guys coming late, and the guys who didn’t go had previous plans. We was friends, we was family, and we depended on each other. We had that saying Ubuntu, and that’s how it was.”\n\nGarnett won them all over by immediately putting himself last – or in this case third.\n\n“It was one of the first meetings or film sessions that we had, and he voluntarily said, We’re going to run this offense – well, he said it in KG of course so you can imagine what he said – through Ray and Paul,” said Kendrick Perkins. “Perk, we’re going worry about defense. Right then he set the tone for sacrifice. No disrespect to Paul. No disrespect to Ray, those guys are both in the Hall of Fame. It’s better to be in the Hall of Fame.\n\n“But everyone knew KG was the best basketball player on that team. For him to come in and set the tone, and take a back seat to Ray and Paul from the jump? It set the tone for everything. He let Doc hold him accountable. With that being said, when Doc was able to call him out, yell at him on the floor, then everybody else had to fall in line. Who was going to argue with that?”\n\nYes, we’re talking practice\n\nArguments with Garnett were generally a losing cause, unless it was Rivers on the other side of a situation. But even there, no one was going to separate Garnett from his intensity.\n\nScalabrine got caught in the middle on quite possibly the most bizarre day in an oft-bizarre season, when Rivers decided to pull Garnett out of practice because of his recent minutes load.\n\n“Doc wanted me to sub in, and KG kept telling me no. I’m looking at him, I’m looking at Doc, I don’t know what to do in this situation,” said the NBC Sports-Boston analyst. “So Doc calls practice. Never been in a situation where practice was called because a guy wants to work hard. I’ve been in a practice where, y’all don’t want to practice then I don’t want to bring it, either. But not because of a guy who didn’t want to take a possession off.”\n\nRivers thus went somewhere few others could or would want to. He confronted the 2004 MVP at a high-pitched, roaring decibel level.\n\n“It was so (bleeping) insane,” said Rivers. “I thought Kevin needed a rest. He lost his (bleeping) mind. He literally lost his mind. He wouldn’t do it. So finally I blew the whistle and said Kevin, you’ve gotta come out. But I’m a (bleeping) warrior! Warriors don’t sit! And he just kept yelling, Warriors don’t sit! And I said OK, warrior, alright, warriors sleep (bleeping) too, and you have to go to sleep.”\n\nSo Garnett morphed into Marcel Marceau along the Waltham facility’s narrow sideline area. Powe, running from end to end in the scrimmage, saw what initially appeared to be a “flash” on the sideline.\n\n“We’re running up and down the court, scrimmaging, and we all saw this shadow, just flashing back and forth. We’re like what the hell?” said Powe. “And then we start seeing it more and more and everyone starts saying stuff, and so I look – every time we’re running down the court, KG is trying to beat us down the court. When we went back up he would beat us again going down the court, and he would get mad at himself if he didn’t beat us. What the (bleep) is he doing? He’s in a full sweat talking to himself, yelling, up and down, up and down, c’mon, c’mon (mother-bleeper), c’mon. And this was his day off? C’mon. C’mon. Sweat’s pouring down him. And then he’s doing defensive slides, back and forth, back and forth.”\n\nBy now players, captivated by the bizarre sideshow, couldn’t concentrate. Rivers blew his whistle.\n\n“Alright, practice is over. Practice is over, Kevin won’t listen, practice is (bleeping) over,” said Rivers. “It was so insane everybody was laughing. It was such a comical act that the only one not laughing was Kevin. Kevin was dead serious. He wasn’t doing it to be funny – he wasn’t even doing it to be a distraction. He wasn’t doing it to show me up. He honestly thought that’s what he should do, because he doesn’t come out of practice. Insane. Paul’s laughing at it. Paul’s like, he’s (bleeping) crazy, period. That’s a good thing too for Rondo and Perk to see, because it stuck in their brain.”\n\nMentorship\n\nRondo was recently approached during a game in Detroit by Frank Jackson, the Pistons guard he played with in New Orleans.\n\n“I probably am still in the game because of my relationship with all the young guys in the league,” said Rondo. “It was very humbling to me a couple of weeks ago when (Jackson) came up to me and said thanks for what I did for him. I love being able to give back to young guys the way the game was given to me, and that’s the biggest takeaway (Garnett) gave me as a vet, was how to handle young guys. Show them the ropes. There’s been a stretch – four or five teams in a row, since I joined the Cavaliers – that players have walked up and said thank you. That’s what it’s about, a great part of why I’m still playing.”\n\nMentorship, according to Rondo, is the greatest part of his connection with Garnett. From the time he took a young Avery Bradley under his wing, he paid it forward. All of the young players on the 2007-08 team – Rondo, Powe, Perkins, Allen, Gabe Pruitt, Glen Davis – moved on with the knowledge they had just been anointed by a legend\n\n“It was crazy. There were times I would catch myself saying man, that’s Kevin Garnett,” said Perkins. “In high school I had a pair of his shoes when he was with Jordan. I had a pair of those Nikes that he had, and I’m like man, that’s the Big Ticket. It really set the stage for my generation as far as big men coming into the league out of high school, like bigs wanted to be the next KG.\n\n“I was like, I’m really playing with Kevin Garnett. As a youngster I would catch myself having anxiety. And then as I got to know him and we developed a relationship, it would become like, Oh, that’s KG, that’s my (bleeper-bleeping) dog. But before that it was like, man, that’s KG! It almost took until after training camp for it to really settle in. We’re going to be a tandem together – me and the guy I idolized. It took me two months to get over that.”\n\nNot everyone passed. One day after practice, with the media filtering into the gym, Garnett repeatedly dunked over a stricken Patrick O’Bryant – a young big man also represented by his agent – grunting “You feel me?” after each bounce. O’Bryant didn’t last long – the front half of the 2008-09 season to be exact. Even Davis had what can best be described as a love/hate relationship with Garnett.\n\n“If you didn’t listen to Kevin, if you didn’t want to work, if you were not over yourself, Kevin didn’t want (bleep) to do with you,” said Rivers. “Now he would give you a chance, and maybe a second chance, but after that, he would say it – I’m off of you. Because Kevin was so much about winning, he had no time for guys who were too caught up in themselves to get out of the way of winning.\n\n“But (Rondo) was probably entirely influenced by him. Kevin had such an amazing impact. His impact was immeasurable.”"
