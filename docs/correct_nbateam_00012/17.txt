More than a few players have come to the Boston Celtics to experience the intensity of an excited crowd of fans at TD Garden out in force to support their teams, and Hall of Fame Celtics champion Kevin Garnett is among the first to admit it.

But it didn’t stop there, as Garnett related in a recent press conference to meet with the media in anticipation of his looming jersey retirement set to take place at the Garden on March 13 as Boston takes on the Dallas Mavericks. Speaking about his unique relationship with the fans, and how he would feed off of their energy, the legendary big man outlined how the high expectations of Celtics fans fueled his title hunt.

“I heard Larry Bird say one time in his early years in Boston is that the reason why he loved playing in front of the fans in Boston is because you couldn’t fake them,” Garnett shared.
