“Starting to work on the Aero-OM brand is the practical translation of the confidence that Medinfar places in our work, namely in our versatility and in the focus we have on presenting results”, says the responsible for the Portuguese market at YDigital, Sara Mendonça.

“YDigital was an obvious choice, as it is an agency that presents not only a very strong creative aspect (recourse to new technologies, new tools, etc.), but also a very robust “business” aspect. The drive for results is something that is present in any proposal presented. The expectation is to have Ydigital not as an external agency, but almost as an employee of Medinfar, completely immersed in Medinfar's spirit and culture”, says the company's Senior Brand Manager, Hugo Luz.
