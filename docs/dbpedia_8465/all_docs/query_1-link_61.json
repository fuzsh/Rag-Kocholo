However, it is not always easy to ascertain which situations should be referred, especially given that PHC does not have access to all diagnostic exams recommended by international guidelines, such as natriuretic peptides in heart failure or computed tomography coronary angiogram in chronic coronary syndromes, among others.\n\nThe aim of this document is to describe a practical approach to the most frequent heart diseases that may require a referral for a hospital cardiology consultation. Thus, in the different chapters, the recommendations for referral are highlighted generically according to group of disease, as well as, albeit briefly, the initial clinical approach within the scope of PHC for a differential diagnosis and more efficient follow-up.\n\nA modified Metaplan methodology was used. A panel of 4 cardiology specialists and 3 specialists in General and Family Medicine developed this document, which should not be taken as an official guideline, but as additional guidance for the correct referral of patients. It is therefore advisable to validate these recommendations locally with the referral hospital, as well as to be aware of the respective international and national guidelines.\n\nKeywords:\n\nHospital referral\n\nCardiology consultation\n\nPrimary health care\n\nChronic coronary syndrome\n\nHeart Failure\n\nSyncope\n\nArrhythmias\n\nValvular disease\n\nHypertension\n\nAtrial fibrillation\n\nResumo\n\nEm Portugal, até 38% da população sofre de doença cardiovascular, o que salienta a importância dos cuidados de saúde primários (CSP) na sua gestão.\n\nA gestão adequada da pessoa com doença cardiovascular obriga frequentemente à referenciação hospitalar para consulta de cardiologia. Contudo, nem sempre é fácil distinguir quais as situações mais prementes, principalmente tendo em conta que os CSP não têm acesso a todos os exames complementares de diagnóstico recomendados pelas guidelines internacionais, como por exemplo péptidos natriuréticos na insuficiência cardíaca ou angiografia por tomografia computorizada cardíaca nas síndromes coronárias crónicas, entre outros.\n\nO objetivo deste documento é descrever uma abordagem prática às patologias do foro cardiológico mais frequentes que podem requerer uma referenciação para consulta hospitalar de cardiologia. Assim, nos diferentes capítulos são destacadas as recomendações de referenciação de forma genérica, por grupo de patologias, bem como, ainda que de forma sucinta, a abordagem clínica inicial no âmbito dos CSP para um diagnóstico diferencial e acompanhamento crónico mais eficiente.\n\nFoi utilizada uma metodologia Metaplan modificada reunindo um painel de quatro especialistas em cardiologia e três especialistas em medicina geral e familiar que desenvolveram este documento, o qual deve ser entendido não como uma norma oficial, mas sim como um instrumento de orientação adicional para o correto encaminhamento dos doentes. É por isso aconselhada a validação local destas recomendações com o hospital de referência, bem como a leitura das respetivas guidelines internacionais e nacionais.\n\nPalavras-chave:\n\nReferenciação hospitalar\n\nConsulta de Cardiologia\n\nCuidados de Saúde Primários\n\nSíndrome coronária crónica\n\nInsuficiência cardíaca\n\nSíncope\n\nArritmias\n\nDoença valvular\n\nHipertensão\n\nFibrilhação auricular\n\nTexto Completo\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn Portugal, up to 38% of the population suffers from cardiovascular disease (CVD), which highlights the importance of primary health care (PHC) in its management. Among the most common diseases in the context of PHC are hypertension (27%), arrhythmias (3%), valvular diseases (2%), heart failure (HF) (2%) and chronic coronary syndromes (2%), although their prevalence may be underestimated.1,2 Given its complexity in terms of diagnosis and clinical approach, adequate management of people with CVD implies a close, effective and bidirectional communication between PHC and hospitals.3,4 In fact, a well-defined functional network with the different levels of care is of the utmost importance, which is only possible with the intervention and cooperation of all institutional and political structures.\n\nHospital referral, when judicious, facilitates the timely diagnosis and treatment of potentially serious situations, and if appropriate to local access limitations, contributes to the correct clinical prioritization, being also a tool for updating all the professionals involved.5\n\nIn this document, we present general guidelines for the referral of patients with cardiovascular pathologies to a cardiology hospital consultation. Additionally, suggestions are made for the initial clinical approach within PHC, with the objective of promoting a more efficient differential diagnosis and follow-up, taking into account the limitations of access of PHC to some diagnostic exams and the context of the Portuguese national referral network.\n\nMethods\n\nA modified Metaplan6,7 methodology was used and divided into two phases: 1) in the first phase a panel of four specialists in Cardiology and 3 specialists in General and Family Medicine convened. After a presentation by the moderator, the panel discussed and defined which cardiovascular diseases were to be addressed in this document; 2) in the second phase, and based on the previous discussion, on current clinical guidelines, and on relevant scientific papers in the field, each chapter was developed by a Cardiologist and a General Practitioner (GP). Finally, the panel convened again to discuss the referral proposals, clinical approach and follow-up of these patients in the context of PHC.\n\nHeart failureDefinition of heart failure\n\nHF is defined as a syndrome caused by an anomalous cardiac structure and/or function, leading to a blood output that is inadequate to the metabolic requirements of the heart.8 HF may be asymptomatic at an early stage, with subsequent symptoms onset.9\n\nDiagnosisHeart failure diagnosis and classification algorithm\n\nFigure 1 describes the diagnosis algorithm, including typical signs and symptoms of HF, as well as the classification of HF according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).10\n\nFigure 1.\n\nDiagnostic algorithm and classification of the type of heart failure.10aThe key structural changes (left atrium dilation and/or left ventricular hypertrophy) are characterized by LAVI>34 mL/m2 or an LVMI≥115 g/m2 in men and ≥95 g/m2 in women or relative wall thickness >0.42. The key functional changes are an E/e’ at rest ≥9, PA systolic pressure >35 mmHg and a TR velocity at rest >2.8 m/s. AF: atrial fibrillation; BNP: B-type natriuretic peptide; CAD: coronary artery disease; COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ECG: electrocardiogram; HF: heart failure; LAVI: left atrial volume index; LVMI: left ventricular mass index; MI: myocardial infarction; NT-proBNP: N-terminal fragment of type B natriuretic peptide; OSAS: obstructive sleep apnea syndrome; PA: pulmonary arterial; T2DM: type 2 diabetes; TR: tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n(1,19MB).\n\nIn case of suspected HF, the diagnosis should be performed as soon as possible, ideally with evaluation of the results within a timeframe not exceeding two weeks to one month.11\n\nClassification of HF based on function and cardiac structural changes is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.\n\nClassification of Heart Failure regarding cardiac structural changes (ACC/AHA) and function (NYHA).28\n\nACC/AHA stagesNYHA functional classificationStage A Risk of developing HF, with no structural cardiac changes or symptoms Not applicableStage B Structural heart disease with no signs or symptoms Class I Asymptomatic Stage CStructural heart disease with current or previous HF symptomsClass I Asymptomatic Class II Symptomatic with moderate physical activity Class III Symptomatic with minimal physical activity Class IV Symptomatic at rest Stage D Refractory heart failure requiring specialized intervention Class IV Symptomatic at rest\n\nACC/AHA: American Colleage of Cardiology/American Heart Association; HF: Heart Failure; NYHA: New York Heart Association\n\nDiagnosis - initial investigationLaboratory evaluation10\n\n•\n\nComplete blood count, renal, hepatic and thyroid function, lipid profile, creatine kinase, HbA1c and glycemia (described in this document as baseline laboratory evaluation);\n\n•\n\nFerritin, % transferrin saturation ((iron/total iron-binding capacity)x100);\n\n•\n\nNatriuretic peptides, according to Figure 1, if available;\n\n•\n\nUrine sediment.\n\nTreatmentApproach to heart failure with reduced ejection fractionNon-pharmacological measures12\n\n•\n\nControl of risk factors and lifestyle modification;\n\n•\n\nInfluenza and anti-pneumococcal vaccination;\n\n•\n\nDaily weight monitoring and self-monitoring of symptoms;\n\n•\n\nAvoid the use of potential harmful medication (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), COX-2 inhibitors).\n\nPharmacological therapy\n\nThe prognostic-modifying therapy of the patient with HF should include angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI)/angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), beta blockers (BB), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists – spironolactone or eplerenone (MRA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors – dapagliflozin or empagliflozin (SGLT2i), as soon as possible, in order to reduce mortality, hospitalizations for HF, and symptoms.8,10\n\n∘\n\nACEi or ARBs should be replaced by an ARNI in suitable patients (i.e., patients that remain symptomatic).\n\n∘\n\nIf an ACEi is to be substituted by an ARNI, the ARNI should only be initiated 36 hours after ACEi discontinuation.10\n\n∘\n\nInitiation of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin is not recommended in patients with an eGFR <25 and <20 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively.

After excluding other forms of non-syncope transient loss of consciousness, such as convulsion or psychogenic forms, syncope can be divided into three major etiological groups: reflex, due to orthostatic hypotension, or cardiac.33\n\nApproximately 10–20% of patients may remain without an etiological diagnosis.34 Up to one third of these patients will experience recurrence of syncope.35\n\nClinical history and physical examination\n\nWith a careful clinical history and physical examination, which should include an orthostatic test (BP measurement in decubitus and orthostatism) and carotid sinus massage in patients over 40 years (usually performed in a hospital setting), up to 85% of all patients may have an etiological diagnosis (see Table 4).33,36\n\nTable 4.\n\nSigns and symptoms suggestive of reflex etiology, orthostatic hypotension or cardiac.33\n\nReflex syncope Syncope due to orthostatic hypotension Cardiac syncope • Long history of recurrent syncope, particularly occurring before 40 years of age;• After unpleasant vision, sound, smell or pain;• Prolonged orthostatism;• During the meal;• To be in crowded and/or hot places;• Autonomic activation before syncope: paleness, perspiration and/or nausea/vomiting;• With rotation of the head or pressure in the carotid sinus (such as in tumors, shaving, tight collars);• Absence of heart disease. • While or after standing;• Prolonged orthostatism;• Standing after exertion;• Postprandial hypotension;• Temporal relationship with onset or alteration of the dosage of vasodepressor or diuretic drugs leading to hypotension;• Presence of autonomic neuropathy or Parkinson's disease. • During exertion or in supine position;• Palpitations of sudden onset immediately followed by syncope;• Family history of unexplained sudden death at an early age;• Presence of structural heart disease (left ventricular dysfunction; moderate or severe valvular disease; cardiomyopathies; pulmonary hypertension);• Presence of coronary artery disease.ECG findings suggestive of arrhythmic syncope:• Bifascicular block (defined as left or right BBB combined with left anterior or posterior fascicular block);• Other intraventricular conduction anomalies (QRS duration ≥0.12 s);• Mobitz I second degree atrio-ventricular (AV) block and 1st degree AV block with markedly prolonged PR interval;• Mild asymptomatic inadequate sinus bradycardia (40-50 bpm) or slow AF (40-50 bpm) in the absence of negative chronotropic drugs;• Non-sustained VT;• Pre-excited QRS complexes (Wolff-Parkinson-White);• Long or short QT intervals;• Early repolarization;• Elevation of the ST segment with type 1 morphology on the V1-V3 leads (Brugada pattern);• Negative T waves on the right precordial leads, epsilon waves suggestive of arrhythmogenic right ventricle dysplasia;• Left ventricular hypertrophy suggesting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.TTE findings suggestive of cardiac syncope (non-exhaustive list):• Obstructive valvular disease;• Cardiomyopathy pattern;• Left or right ventricular dysfunction;• Pulmonary hypertension;• Changes in segmental kinetics suggestive of ischemia.\n\nAF: atrial fibrillation; AV: atrio-ventricular; BBB: bundle branch block; ECG: electrocardiogram; VT: ventricular tachycardia.\n\nIn the context of PHC, the approach in terms of initial diagnostic exams will include:33\n\n∘\n\nBasic laboratory evaluation;\n\n∘\n\nECG;\n\n∘\n\n24 h Holter;\n\n∘\n\nTTE with Doppler study, particularly in the presence of known previous heart disease or when there are data suggestive of structural heart disease or cardiac syncope (see Table 4);\n\n∘\n\nStress test, if there are complaints of angina or syncope on exertion (preferably performed in a hospital setting).\n\nDizziness is also common. It is a heterogeneous symptom, including feeling dizzy (sense of motion, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, paleness and diaphoresis), presyncope (perception of an imminent episode of fainting accompanied by paleness, diaphoresis and nausea) and imbalance (loss of balance without feeling of movement).37 The most frequent causes include peripheral vertigo, labyrinthitis, Menière disease, central vestibular causes, psychiatric diseases, hyperventilation and multifactorial causes. The prognosis of dizziness is usually favorable, unlike that of cardiac syncope.37\n\nWhen to refer to cardiologyReferral criteria (cardiology consultation)\n\n•\n\nSyncope suggestive of cardiac etiology:\n\n∘\n\nBased on clinical criteria or after suggestive findings in diagnostic exams available in PHC (ECG, TTE, stress test, laboratory tests) (see Table 4);\n\n•\n\nRecurrent syncope, even if of unlikely cardiac etiology;\n\n•\n\nSyncope in patients with pacemakers or other devices;\n\n•\n\nSyncope of unlikely cardiac etiology, but in patients with high risk professions (heavy-duty drivers, divers, etc.).\n\nReferral criteria (emergency department)\n\n•\n\nSyncope and33:\n\n∘\n\nDocumented 2nd or 3rd degree AV block (ECG or Holter);\n\n∘\n\nDocumented alternating branch block (ECG or Holter);\n\n∘\n\nTrifascicular block (ECG or Holter);\n\n∘\n\nSevere aortic stenosis;\n\n∘\n\nSevere depression of left ventricular function;\n\n∘\n\nSevere pulmonary HT;\n\n∘\n\nICD shock;\n\n∘\n\nSuspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS);\n\n∘\n\nSuspected pulmonary thromboembolism;\n\n∘\n\nSuspected dissection of the aorta;\n\n∘\n\nTraumatic brain injury.\n\nFollow-up plan in primary health care and discharge criteria from the cardiology consultation\n\nAfter evaluation in an external hospital consultation (often involving neurology and psychiatry), a final diagnosis is normally achieved in approximately 80% of patients, and this will determine the therapeutic approach.38\n\nCriteria for return to primary healthcare33\n\n•\n\nCardiac syncope:\n\n∘\n\nTreated with implantable devices (follow-up at devices consultation);\n\n∘\n\nTreated by ablation, surgery or pharmacological control (may be discharged or followed-up in a specific consultation, depending on the situation, but only after a period of at least one year without symptoms).\n\n•\n\nSyncope of unknown etiology with implanted event recording device (follow-up at device consultation);\n\n•\n\nReflex syncope without indication for pacemaker implantation and with clinical improvement after the establishment of general and/or pharmacological measures;\n\n•\n\nSyncope due to orthostatic hypotension and with clinical improvement after the establishment of general and/or pharmacological measures.\n\nFollow-up33\n\n•\n\nThe therapeutic approach to most patients with syncope of non-cardiac etiology (reflex or due to orthostatic hypotension) involves reassurance, general measures and adjustment of established therapy;\n\n•\n\nThe follow-up is based on the evaluation of the response to these measures over time;\n\n•\n\nPatients with syncope of non-cardiac etiology (reflex or due to orthostatic hypotension) or of unknown etiology may have syncope recurrences;\n\n∘\n\nIn these cases, the approach is summarized in Table 5.

The primary causes of AR in adults are: degeneration of the aortic valve or root (with or without a bicuspid valve); rheumatic fever; infectious endocarditis; myxomatous degeneration; thoracic aortic aneurysm. In children, the most common cause is ventricular septal defect with aortic valve prolapse.Diagnosis:TTE: • Mild AR: ∘ Semi-quantitative methods: Vena contracta width (VCW) <3 mm, PHT >500 ms; ∘ Quantitative methods: EROA <10 mm2, regurgitant volume <30 ml; • Moderate AR: ∘ Semi-quantitative methods: VCW ≥3-<6 mm, PHT ≥200-≤500 ms; ∘ Quantitative methods: ·Mild to moderate AR: EROA 10-19 mm2, regurgitant volume 30-44 ml; ·Moderate to severe AR: EROA 20-29 mm2, regurgitant volume 45-59 ml; • Severe AR: ∘ Semi-quantitative methods: VCW ≥6 mm, PHT <200 ms; ∘ Quantitative methods: EROA ≥30 mm2, regurgitant volume ≥60 ml; i) Documented severe AR in symptomatic and non-symptomatic patients;ii) Patients with moderate AR and LV dilation;iii) Patients with severe dilation of the aortic root;iv) Patients with Marfan syndrome with aortics root disease;v) Patients with aortic bicuspid;vi) Collagen diseases. Echocardiographic control:Progressive lesion• Mild AR: 3–5 years;• Moderate AR: 1–2 years.Patients with severe AR will be followed-up at the hospital.Mitral valve diseaseMitral Stenosis (MS) Thickening and calcification of the mitral valve, resulting in blood flow restriction from the left atrium to the left ventricle due to a narrowed mitral passage.Mitral stenosis usually results from rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever occurs mainly in children following streptococcal pharyngitis or scarlet fever. In the elderly, it occurs mainly if they had rheumatic fever and did not undergo antibiotic therapy during their youth.Diagnosis:TTE: • Mild MS: mitral valve area (MVA) >1.5 cm2, mean gradient <5 mmHg, pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) <30 mmHg; • Moderate MS: MVA 1.0-1.5 cm2, mean gradient 5-10 mmHg, PAP 30-50 mmHg; • Severe MS: MVA <1.0 cm2, mean gradient >10 mmHg, PAP >50 mmHg; i) Symptomatic and non-symptomatic patients with moderate/severe MS; Echocardiographic control:Progressive lesion3–5 years (MVA > 1.5 cm2).Patients with significant MS (MVA<1.5 cm2) will be followed-up at the hospital.Mitral Regurgitation (MR) It is essential to distinguish primary from secondary MR. In primary MR, one or several components of the mitral valve apparatus are directly affected.Secondary MR may be of the atrial (secondary to atrial dilation – frequent in HFpEF) or ventricular (frequent in HFrEF) type.Diagnosis:TTE • Mild MR: ∘ Semi-quantitative methods: VCW <3 mm; ∘ Quantitative methods: EROA <20 mm2, regurgitant volume <30 ml; • Moderate MR: ∘ Semi-quantitative methods: VCW ≥3-<7 mm; ∘ Quantitative methods: · Mild to moderate MR: EROA 20-29 mm2, regurgitant volume 30-44 ml; · Moderate to severe MR: EROA 30-39 mm2, regurgitant volume 45-59 ml; • Severe MR: ∘ Semi-quantitative methods: VCW ≥7 mm; ∘ Quantitative methods: EROA ≥40 mm2, regurgitant volume ≥60 ml. i) Patients with severe MR;ii) Patients with moderate MR with LV dilatation or systolic dysfunction,, pulmonary hypertension or heart failure. Echocardiographic control:Progressive lesion • Mild: 3–5 years; • Moderate: 1–2 years.Patients with severe MR will be followed-up at the hospital.Tricuspid valve diseaseTricuspid regurgitation (TR) Pathological TR is most commonly secondary and due to right ventricle dysfunction following pressure and/or volume overload in the presence of structurally normal leaflets. The most frequent causes are: infectious endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, carcinoid syndrome, myxomatous disease, endomyocardial fibrosis, Ebstein's disease and congenitally dysplastic valves, drug-induced valve diseases, chest trauma, and iatrogenic valve injury.Diagnosis:TTE • Mild TR: ∘ Semi-quantitative methods: VCW not defined; PISA≤5 mm; ∘ Quantitative methods: · Not defined; • Moderate TR: ∘ Semi-quantitative methods: VCW <7 mm, PISA 6-9 mm; ∘ Quantitative methods: · Not defined; • Severe TR: ∘ Semi-quantitative methods: VCW > 7 mm, PISA >9 mm; ∘ Quantitative methods: EROA ≥40 mm2, regurgitant volume≥45 ml. Patients with severe TR;Patients with moderate isolated TR with right ventricular dilation with symptoms of heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. Echocardiographic control:Progressive lesion • Mild: 3–5 years; • Moderate: 1–2 years.Patients with severe TR will be followed-up at the hospital.Valve prosthesesMechanical and biological valve prostheses In adults, the choice between a mechanical and biological valve is mainly determined by the risk of bleeding related to anticoagulation and the risk of thromboembolism when using a mechanical valve versus the risk of structural deterioration of the bioprosthesis, with lifestyle and patient's preferences being also considered. i) Patients with prosthesis with de novo onset of cardiac symptoms (heart failure, angor, syncope);ii) Evidence of prosthesis dysfunction in TTE. Echocardiographic control: 1. Mechanical valve (surgical) – baseline; 2. Bioprosthesis (surgical) – baseline; 5–10 after surgery; and then annually; 3.

Thus, local validation of these recommendations with the referral hospital and the primary health care network is recommended. Although the references cited are based mainly on guidelines from international scientific societies, this document does not intend to be a summary of those guidelines nor does it aim to replace them. On the contrary, it aims to put these recommendations into perspective, taking into account daily clinical practice, especially considering the limitations of access to diagnostic exams and the particularities of the Portuguese national referral network.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nRui Baptista has received fees for consultancy services and congress attendance from AstraZeneca, Janssen, Ferrer, Bial, Bayer, Novartis, Servier, Medinfar, Jaba-Recordati, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Pfizer, Bristol Myers-Squibb e Vifor Pharma.
