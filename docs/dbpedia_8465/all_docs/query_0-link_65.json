        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nDespite the global effort put into diabetes mellitus (DM) research and patient education, this condition remains a worrisome public health issue. Intimately linked with the increasing prevalence of obesity, Type 2 DM (T2DM) accounts for approximately 90% of all DM cases and is a major cause of several micro- and macrovascular complications [1,2].\n\nUpon food ingestion, the incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is released and stimulates insulin secretion while reducing glucagon production [3,4,5,6]. In addition, it decreases gastric motility, promotes satiety, may have a cardioprotective role besides glycaemic control (namely, by reducing blood pressure [BP] and post-prandial triglycerides [TG]/free fatty acid levels), and inhibits ß-cell apoptosis while inducing its proliferation [4,5]. However, endogenous GLP-1 is not suitable for long-term action, since its circulating form is rapidly degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4).\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry has therefore invested in the development of a group of peptides that mimic GLP-1 function, the GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1ra). They are resistant to DPP-4 degradation, allowing for supra-physiological GLP-1 equivalent concentrations and representing a suitable option for controlling hyperglycaemia when lifestyle modifications and metformin therapy are unable to do so [3,5]. Thus, GLP-1ra are currently recommended in clinical practice as a prognosis modifier for T2DM, even in the presence of good metabolic control.\n\nLiraglutide is a long-acting GLP-1ra with 97% sequence homology with the native hormone [3,5]. Its efficacy and safety as a monotherapy or add-on treatment for adult T2DM patients have been demonstrated in an extensive clinical trial programme named LEAD (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes). Briefly, liraglutide effectively reduced glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood glucose levels, increased insulin levels, improved surrogate markers of ß-cells function, promoted weight loss, and reduced BP [3,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. As for safety concerns, liraglutide was generally well tolerated, with reports of relatively frequent—but moderate and transient—gastrointestinal adverse events, namely, nausea and vomiting [3,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. Major hypoglycaemic episodes were uncommon, likely due to liraglutide’s glucose-dependent mechanism of action [3,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. Additional clinical trials involving T2DM patients with a high cardiovascular risk have demonstrated the cardioprotective potential of liraglutide, which decreased the risk of cardiovascular events and improved several cardiometabolic risk indices [18,19,20]. Finally, liraglutide was also shown to be associated with lower rates of the development and progression of diabetic kidney disease, as compared to placebo [21].\n\nThe added value of liraglutide in the pharmacological approach to T2DM has been firmly established by several randomised clinical trials. However, data from the trials are seldom replicated during standard clinical practice, mainly due to the strict inclusion criteria, the high patient compliance, and the close monitoring routine that characterises this type of approach. For instance, adjusting the eligibility criteria of the LEAD 1–5 trials to the Danish population revealed that only 26.9% of the 9251 patients prescribed liraglutide would have been eligible for these trials [22].\n\nObservational studies and post-marketing analyses are, therefore, of utmost importance to ascertain the impact of liraglutide in the real world, as well as to unveil its long-term effects. With that in mind, and with the goal of contributing to filling the knowledge gap between randomised clinical trials and real-world practice, we have analysed the effects of liraglutide in a Portuguese cohort of T2DM patients in regard to glycaemic control, changes in anthropometric parameters, and variations in other cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nWe have retrospectively analysed the effectiveness of liraglutide in a population of 191 Portuguese T2DM patients from 10 outpatient clinical centres, in terms of glycaemic control, anthropometric parameters, and other cardiovascular risk markers. Most patients were female (60.7%), obese (median BMI: 35.6), and under anti-diabetic (98.4%), anti-hypertensive (83.2%), and/or anti-dyslipidaemia medications (79.0%). Such characteristics are in accordance with previous studies conducted in the Portuguese population with T2DM, which describe a higher prevalence of the disease among women [23,24], obesity as one of the most common comorbidities [23], and the frequent use of the aforementioned medication [24]. Overall, most analysed variables have shown a statistical and clinical improvement 6 months after the introduction of liraglutide therapy, which was sustained for up to 24 months.\n\nOur results show that liraglutide treatment resulted in glycaemic control, as reflected by the significant decrease in HbA1c values at the 6-, 12-, and 24-month evaluations. Even though this reduction is in line with what was observed in the LEAD 3 trial and several real-world studies [13,15,16,25,26], others have reported an HbA1c reduction that is somewhat higher [8,9,10,11,12,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34]. A similar pattern was detected in the percentage of patients who achieved the predetermined HbA1c goals of ≤6.5%, ≤7.0%, and ≤7.5%. Still, it is worth mentioning that 38.2% of all patients had an HbA1c reduction of at least 1% 12 months after study initiation, a value that increased to 44.8% at the 24-month follow-up visit.\n\nDespite being modest, the reduction in the HbA1c levels suggests that most patients responded to liraglutide treatment. The main reason for this somehow modest yet statistically and clinically significant decrease in HbA1c may be related to the significant proportion of patients with HbA1c levels ≤7% (31.4%) at baseline. Such values were not expected to decrease by more than 1%, independently of the anti-diabetic medication introduced. In addition, even though the baseline HbA1c level was similar to that of previous studies, patients presented with a severe disease that lasted for a long time (12 years), with 56.5% of them already on insulin therapy at baseline. Another plausible reason could be related to the observed changes in the T2DM medication, such as the high frequency of patients (nearly two-thirds) who were under DPP4i at the time of study initiation and the reduction in the prescription of sulphonylureas. Of note, some patients who were previously on DPP4i incorrectly maintained this therapy after starting liraglutide.\n\nAs for the reduction of at least 1% in HbA1c levels, as expected, this was more likely to occur in patients with higher levels at baseline. The results showed that such a reduction was nearly 28 times more probable to occur in patients with an HbA1c basal level > 7% but less likely to occur in those taking metformin. The latter is an intriguing observation given that this medication was prescribed to more than 80% of patients during the 24-month study period.\n\nWe also noted a sustained improvement in the anthropometric parameters. Six months after treatment initiation, there was a decrease in median body weight (2.1 kg), body fat mass percentage (2.0%), and waist circumference (1.0 cm). These alterations were significant when compared to the baseline and similar to those at 12 and 24 months. Concerning weight reduction, we observed slightly higher values than reported in most LEAD trials [8,9,10,11,12,13]. Nevertheless, real-world studies report a wide range of weight reduction values among liraglutide users [15,17,26,27,28,29,30,32,33,34,35], a variation that likely reflects the baseline population characteristics, the concomitant medication, the follow-up time, the fact that some protocols focus on overweight or obese patients, and the dietary patterns of the study population. With respect to waist circumference, the reduction reported here is within the range of what has been previously published [8,28,34]. Although seemingly small, this reduction is clinically relevant given the importance of this parameter with regard to cardiometabolic risk [36].\n\nFinally, we have found a persistent improvement in some of the cardiovascular risk factors analysed, such as the increase in HDL-c and the decrease in LDL-c levels, and an overall modification in the lipid profile, which was most consistent with the results published by others [9,12,29,34]. Still, in this cohort, the reduction in LDL-c was smaller than those identified by Buse et al. and Rondinelli et al. [12,28], and the TG values did not significantly change, whereas the LEAD trials 4 and 6 and one observational study have found them to decrease [9,12,34]. Concerning patients who did not change their BP-lowering medication, systolic and diastolic BP did not suffer significant alterations, in contrast to what was found in most LEAD randomised clinical trials and some observational studies [8,10,11,12,13,28,29,31,34]. These disparities are likely related to the patients’ baseline cardiovascular risk, follow-up time, and concomitant therapies.\n\nIn the future, it would be interesting to achieve a follow-up of this cohort to evaluate liraglutide’s effectiveness for a longer period under real-world conditions. Additionally, it would be beneficial to perform a more thorough characterisation of the patients’ sociodemographic and clinical variables, as well as the collection of adverse events.\n\nOur study has some key strengths worth mentioning. Its multicentric nature accounts for a good representation of the Portuguese T2DM outpatient population in a real-world setting, and its relatively long follow-up period allows for the analysis of liraglutide effects from a long-term perspective. However, there are also a few limitations that should be acknowledged. The main one is inherent to all observational studies and is related to the non-controlled and non-randomised design of the study, which allows for the presence of selection bias and uncontrolled variables affecting the results. In addition, due to its retrospective nature, several parameters, such as laboratory data, could not be evaluated."
