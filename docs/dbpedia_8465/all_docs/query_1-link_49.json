        "text": "Appropriate management of obesity has been demonstrated to delay the progression from prediabetic state to T2D and to exert beneficial impact on the treatment of patients already with T2D [41,42,43,44,45,46].\n\nTreatment of Cardiometabolic Risk Factors: Focus on GLP-1 RAs\n\nFigure 1 summarises the effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on cardiometabolic risk factors and cardio-renal-metabolic conditions.\n\nImpact of GLP-1 RAs on Lipids Levels\n\nSeveral clinical trials showed that GLP-1 RA improved lipid profiles in T2D by modifying levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), Tg and free fatty acids [47, 48]. In a pilot study on the effect of liraglutide on lipids in patients with T2D, the administration of liraglutide reduced non-HDL-C and calculated TC at 1 and 3 months, and TC and LDL-C levels at 1 month [49]. However, such treatment did not affect cholesterol synthesis and cholesterol absorption markers. Only TC level was found to be reduced in patients with baseline LDL-C > 100 mg/dL (> 2.6 mmol/L). In turn, the administration of exenatide limited postprandial endothelial dysfunction and diminished postprandial Tg levels after a high-fat meal in patients with T2D [50]. GLP-1 RA-stimulated reduction in serum Tg levels was suggested to be related to diminished gastric emptying and intestinal lipid production [51,52,53].\n\nLipid-lowering properties have been observed also in the case of other GLP-1 RA, including semaglutide and dulaglutide. In a retrospective cohort study (Sema-MiDiab01), both TC and LDL-C levels were significantly reduced in patients with T2D after 6 months of semaglutide treatment (LDL-C 91.13 vs. 81.88 mg/dl, p = 0.0002; TC 167.07 vs. 155.61 mg/dl; p < 0.0001) [54]. Tg levels decreased significantly after 12 months of therapy (166.51 vs. 147.18 mg/dl; p = 0.001). Moreover, Tuttolomondo et al. [55] demonstrated that at the 9-month follow-up, subjects treated with dulaglutide had significantly lower values of the mean serum TC and LDL-C compared with control subjects treated with conventional therapy.\n\nThe impact of GLP-1 RA on lipid profile was suggested to be associated with weight loss. Magkos et al. [56] showed that a 5% weight loss enhanced adipose tissue lipolytic activity and cholesterol flux, while pathways involved in lipid synthesis were reduced. This weight loss significantly lowered triglyceride levels but did not affect free fatty acids, LDL or HDL cholesterol. Weight loss by 16% of body mass translated into progressive linear lowering of intrahepatic triglyceride content and triglyceride concentrations, with a significant decline in plasma free fatty acids observed only following 16% weight loss. These observations were confirmed by gene expression analysis in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue which revealed increased expression of cholesterol flux genes (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 1, ATP-binding cassette transporter, apolipoprotein E, cholesteryl ester transfer protein) and decreased expression of lipid synthesis genes (stearoyl-CoA desaturase, fatty acid desaturase 1, fatty acid desaturase 2, elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 6) with progressive weight loss [56]. However, GLP-1 RAs can also alter body fat distribution by influencing lipid remobilization and turnover across various fat depots [57]. Zhao et al. [57] found that liraglutide can reduce visceral fat while increasing subcutaneous fat via bidirectional regulation of lipid metabolism in these fat depots.\n\nImpact of GLP-1 RAs on Blood Pressure (BP)\n\nGLP-1 RAs have been found to decrease systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). In the meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling patients with T2D, exenatide BID was demonstrated to lower SBP levels when compared to placebo (mean difference [MD] − 5.24, 95% Cl − 6.88 to − 3.59; p < 0.00001) and insulin glargine (MD − 3.46 mmHg, 95% CI − 3.63 to − 3.29; p < 0.00001) [58]. Also, the DBP was decreased by − 5.91 mmHg (95% CI − 7.53 to − 4.28; p < 0.00001) compared with the placebo group, and by 0.99 mmHg (95% CI − 1.12 to − 0.87; p < 0.00001) compared with sitagliptin. Similarly, the treatment with liraglutide was associated with SBP and DBP reduction by 1 to 5 mmHg compared to glimepiride and placebo [58]. Beneficial impact on BP was hypothesized to result from the vasodilatory effect on the blood vessels, natriuretic/diuretic effects of GLP-1 agonists on kidneys, and interactions with the central nervous system [59,60,61]. Since the decrease in BP levels is mostly visible within the first 2 weeks of treatment, meaning before the occurrence of BW loss, it has been suggested that GLP-1 RA-related direct hypotensive effect is independent of BW reduction [58, 62].\n\nThe analysis of five randomized, placebo-controlled trials included in the AWARD program demonstrated that dulaglutide (1.5 mg) decreased SBP (− 2.6 mmHg, 95% CI − 3.8 to − 1.5; p < 0.001) and pulse pressure (− 2.5 mmHg, 95% CI − 3.5 to − 1.5; p < 0.001) in people with T2D [63]. Up to one-third of the impact of dulaglutide on SBP and pulse pressure was associated with BW reduction; however, the major effect was independent of BW. In contrast, the effect of dulaglutide on DBP was limited with only a small weight-mediated effect. Dulaglutide 4.5 mg affected SBP and pulse pressure to a greater extent in comparison to dulaglutide 1.5 mg [63]. Also, semaglutide was found to beneficially influence BP. The results of a 6-month retrospective study in the USA (SCOPE) revealed mean reductions of − 4.4 ± 12.3 mmHg (95% CI − 5.7, − 3.0; p < 0.001) in SBP and − 1.7 ± 8.4 mmHg (95% CI − 2.6, − 0.7; p < 0.001) in DBP following the administration of 2.4 mg semaglutide in subjects with overweight and obesity [64]. Similarly, in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 29 RCTs (26,985 T2D participants) weighted MD in SBP of semaglutide vs. placebo or other antihyperglycaemic agents was − 2.31 mmHg (95% CI − 3.11 to − 1.51), and 0.09 mmHg (95% CI − 0.16 to 0.33) for DBP [65]. The observed reduction in SBP was similar for semaglutide administered subcutaneously and orally [65].\n\nImpact of GLP-1 RAs on Inflammation\n\nGLP-1 RAs show the capability of regulating the immune system and inflammation [66], and immune cell recruitment [22]. Anti-inflammatory properties of GLP-1 RAs have been confirmed in human trials, which demonstrated a significant reduction of inflammatory biomarkers following GLP-1 RAs treatment compared to other standard antidiabetic treatments [22, 67]. Furthermore, the use of GLP-1 RAs has been demonstrated to reduce inflammatory cytokines and pro-fibrotic factors related to the development of nephropathy, such as tumour growth factor (TGF)-β1 and fibronectin [68, 69]. These additional effects are of importance because the presence of chronic inflammation is associated with the occurrence of long-term chronic complications of diabetes [70]. GLP-1 RAs may diminish inflammation by directly acting on immune cells expressing GLP-1 receptors or indirectly via glycaemic control and BW loss [22, 71]. The results of the study of liraglutide’s effect on monocytes obtained from healthy volunteers revealed that it diminished tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) expression and considerably repressed monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 expression [71]. Also semaglutide was found to decrease systemic inflammatory cytokines, TNFα and interferon (IFN)-γ levels as well as immune cell recruitment in a murine model of acute inflammation [72]. GLP-1 RAs are able to limit the migration and infiltration of monocytes irrespective of BW loss. The confirmation of the characteristic immune effect of GLP-1 RAs was provided by the observation of decreased interleukin (IL)-1β production by M1 macrophages and an enhanced synthesis of IL-10 by M2 macrophages in response to these drugs in patients with obesity and T2D [73]. In the study of patients with inadequately controlled T2D on insulin or other antihyperglycaemic drugs, 12-month therapy with either dulaglutide or liraglutide decreased local or systemic inflammation, independently of the changes in glycaemic control and BW [74]. However, reduction in IL-6 significantly correlated with the changes in waist circumference (r = 0.347; p = 0.006) [74]. In another study, liraglutide reduced high-sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) more effectively than metformin [75]. The same effect was reported for both subcutaneously and orally administered semaglutide vs. comparators (placebo, exenatide extended-release or empagliflozin) [76]. Moreover, liraglutide also stimulated a significant reduction in the mean concentration of CRP in a retrospective study of 110 patients with T2D and obesity. A sub-study of a randomized trial of individuals with T2D treated for 26 weeks with liraglutide revealed that this GLP-1 RA drug intensely reduced the production of TNFα and IL-1β but also increased chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 5 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared to placebo. Gupta et al. [77] demonstrated significantly diminished cell necrosis and apoptosis following the therapy with GLP-1 RA. Through the modulation of vascular inflammation and beneficial impact on endothelial dysfunction, GLP-1 RAs may protect patients against atherosclerosis [78, 79].\n\nImpact of GLP-1 RAs on Liver Functioning\n\nGLP-1 RAs have also been shown to exert beneficial effects on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) which is a hepatic manifestation of MetS and is commonly associated with T2D and obesity [80,81,82]. GLP-1 RA administration protects against hepatotoxicity and hepatic steatosis [83]. The beneficial effects on liver function could stem from the anti-inflammatory effect of GLP-1 RAs and protection against lipotoxicity [84,85,86]. The results of a pilot study of liraglutide effects in MASLD with glucose intolerance (LEAN-J) demonstrated that 24 weeks of treatment with liraglutide at the dose of 0.9 mg/day was associated with significant improvement in BMI, visceral fat accumulation and liver function [87]. When the treatment was prolonged and the therapy was continued for 96 weeks, an additional reduction in inflammation, fibrosis and MASLD activity score was reported. The authors suggested that mechanisms behind metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) improvement could be associated with decreased BW and HbA1c [87]. The therapy with liraglutide was also demonstrated to directly decrease liver fibrosis and steatosis in patients with MASLD and T2D compared to sitagliptin and pioglitazone [88].\n\nSimilarly, a systematic review and meta-analysis of eight studies including 2413 patients with MASLD/MASH treated with semaglutide revealed that this therapy was associated with a decrease in serum alanine transaminase (ALT) (MD 14.07 U/L, 95% CI 19.39 to − 8.75; p < 0.001) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (MD 6.89 U/L, 95% CI 9.14 to − 4.63; p < 0.001) levels as well as significant amelioration of liver fat content (LFC) (MD 4.97%, 95% CI 6.65 to − 3.29; p < 0.001) and liver stiffness (MD 0.96 kPa, 95% CI 1.87 to − 0.04; p = 0.04) [89]. Newsome et al. demonstrated that in patients at risk of MASLD (with T2D and obesity) ALT levels were reduced by 6–21% (p < 0.05 for doses ≥ 0.2 mg/day in BW management trial) and by 9% vs. placebo for 1.0 mg/week semaglutide (p = 0.0024; in CV outcome trial) [90]. However, no improvement was observed in patients treated with 0.5 mg/week semaglutide in the second trial [90]. The study assessing the impact of dulaglutide on LFC, pancreatic fat content and liver enzyme levels demonstrated that 0.75 mg subcutaneously administered dulaglutide each week for 4 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg weekly for 20 weeks plus standard treatment vs. standard treatment alone revealed a greater decrease in LFC, pancreatic and liver stiffness than that of the control group (p < 0.001 for all) [91]. In turn, Hartman et al. [92] observed that tirzepatide (a dual agonist of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP] and GLP-1 receptors) reduced levels of ALT, AST, keratin-18 (K-18), procollagen III (Pro-C3) and considerably increased adiponectin from baseline compared with placebo after 26 weeks.\n\nImpact of GLP-1 RAs on Adiposity Components\n\nThe systematic review of 10 trials, including 625 patients, demonstrated that GLP-1 RA treatment could considerably reduce visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in patients with diabetes and obesity [93]. It appears that the VAT reduction (11.23%) is preferential over SAT (8.34%). VAT and SAT reduction positively correlate with BW loss. The extent of SAT and VAT is associated with metabolic RFs, i.e. VAT accumulation correlates with a higher risk of T2D hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, heart failure and CV death [94,95,96,97]. The VAT-to-SAT rate determines the severity of atherosclerosis and CV risk [98, 99]. Since the abnormal distribution of VAT and SAT is very frequent in patients with T2D, treatments that decrease both glucose level and VAT content appear to be highly beneficial. A meta-analysis of RCTs demonstrated that GLP-1 RA therapy resulted in significant reductions in VAT, SAT and adipose tissues that correlated with BW loss [93]. The observed decrease in VAT could be ascribed to lower appetite and calorie intake due to the treatment [93]. It has been suggested that GLP-1 RA administration may be associated with distinct effects on VAT and SAT since GLP-1 receptors are more abundant in VAT [93].\n\nImpact of GLP-1 RAs on Kidneys\n\nSome studies suggested renoprotective effects of GLP-1 RAs [100, 101]. Renoprotective effects stem from greater glycaemic control and BW loss; however, it is plausible that these drugs may also exert direct effects on renal function, for example via actions on systemic BP and kidney hemodynamics [102]. In the SUSTAIN 6 trial beneficial effects of semaglutide on composite renal outcome (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46–0.88; p = 0.005) and significant reduction (46%) in the risk of developing macroalbuminuria (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.37–0.77; p = 0.001) were observed [103]. Moreover, in this trial, semaglutide significantly diminished the estimated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio from baseline to end of treatment, compared with placebo (treatment ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.67–0.81; p < 0.001) [104]. Also, the results of a post hoc analysis of SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 trials showed significant differences in the rate of annual estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline in all GFRs groups. Estimated treatment difference (ETD) was 0.59 (95% CI 0.29, 0.89; p < 0.0001) for the overall population, 1.06 (95% CI 0.45, 1.67; p = 0.0007) for the ≥ 30 to < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 subgroup and 0.46 (95% CI 0.12, 0.80; p = 0.0083) for the ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 subgroup [104]. However, it should be underlined that not all GLP-1 RAs exert renoprotective effects and there are safety issues in advanced renal disease for some GLP-1 RAs. Exenatide, which is mostly eliminated via the kidneys, is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease; in those with moderate renal disease, this drug should be administered with caution [105]. In general, all GLP-1 RAs should be used cautiously in patients with T2D and severe (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) renal impairment since there is not enough evidence confirming their safety in this population [106, 107].\n\nImpact of GLP-1 RAs on Cardiovascular System\n\nApart from the beneficial impact on glucose control and BW management, most GLP-1 RAs (liraglutide, semaglutide and dulaglutide) positively influence the CV risk profile [107]. They diminish CV risk, lower the incidence of myocardial infarctions and strokes as well as improve quality of life and prolong the survival of patients [108,109,110,111]. Many clinical trials confirmed the favourable impact of GLP-1 RAs on the CV system. Liraglutide, dulaglutide and subcutaneously administered semaglutide were shown to decrease major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) [112]. Beneficial CV properties of GLP-1 RAs appear to be associated with their impact on blood lipids, endothelial function and BP decrease as well as anti-inflammatory state. Long-acting GLP-1 RAs were found to be superior to placebo in reduction of the primary MACE endpoint in the following trials: Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) (liraglutide), SUSTAIN 6 (semaglutide QW), REWIND (dulaglutide), Harmony Outcomes (albiglutide) and Effect of Efpeglenatide on Cardiovascular Outcomes (AMPLITUDE-O) (efpeglenatide) [113]. The LEADER trial [111] showed the superiority of liraglutide compared to placebo in decreasing cardiovascular mortality and nonfatal cardiovascular events (e.g. MI, stroke) (HR 0.87, CI 0.78–0.97; p = 0.01). SUSTAIN 6 trial demonstrated a 26% lower rate of CV death, nonfatal MI or nonfatal stroke in patients with T2D administered injectable semaglutide (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) in comparison to placebo (HR 0.74 (0.58; 0.95), number needed to treat 45 over 24 months) [110]. Also, a systematic review and meta-analysis of aforementioned RCTs demonstrated that GLP-1 RAs reduced the risk of MACEs by 14%, with a HR of 0.86 (95% CI 0.80–0.93; p < 0.0001), all-cause mortality by 12% (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82–0.94; p = 0.0001) and hospital admission for heart failure by 11% (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82–0.98; p = 0.013) [114]. Recently published data from the randomized, double-blinded SELECT trial, which included individuals who were overweight or presented obesity accompanied with established CVD but without T2D, demonstrated that 2.4 mg of semaglutide once-weekly significantly decreased MACE, defined as CV death, non-fatal MI or nonfatal stroke, compared with placebo [115]. The results from the SELECT trial may have indeed a significant impact on future treatment recommendations for GLP-1 RAs as well as guidelines for people with obesity and pre-existing atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD), and therefore the results of the tirzepatide cardiovascular outcome trial in patients with overweight/obesity are now highly anticipated [116]. In addition, a 4-month retrospective, real-world study of individuals with T2D revealed that injectable semaglutide significantly decreased HbA1c levels and carotid intima-media thickness, which means that this drug appears effective in the treatment of subclinical atherosclerosis, irrespective of disease duration [117]. However, not all drugs from this class showed a beneficial impact on CV events. Lixisenatide and exenatide QW failed to significantly decrease the risk of MACE in the corresponding CV outcome trials—ELIXA and EXSCEL [118, 119].\n\nTreatment of Overweight/Obesity Focus on GLP-1 RAs\n\nThe recommendations for the treatment of obesity in patients with T2D have been changing over time. Currently, in addition to diet and physical activity modifications, behavioural therapy as well as metabolic surgery and new pharmacotherapies are suggested [120, 121]. Moreover, there is a strong focus on obesity management which reaches beyond BW loss alone, as it covers risk reduction and health improvement [122]. The European guidelines for obesity management state that even a modest BW loss of 5–10% of initial BW combined with lifestyle modification brings significant clinical benefits [122]. Loss of at least 15% of BW can exert a disease-modifying effect in T2D, which extends the results obtained using glucose-lowering intervention. The results of clinical trials have demonstrated that in 25–60% of patients with prediabetes, the progression to T2D can be prevented via lifestyle intervention that also leads to weight loss [123].\n\nFurthermore, according to these guidelines, obesity management should not only concentrate on the reduction of weight and BMI but also on waist circumference (indicating a decrease of visceral adiposity) and the improvement in body composition (improvement of fat-free mass and reduction of fat mass). BW loss targets should be established individually for each person, and they ought to be realistic in the long term. Focus should be also put on the long-term maintenance of BW loss, as repeated loss and regain of BW (weight cycling) was found to increase the risk of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and gallbladder disease [124]. Moreover, BW variability was shown to increase the risk of CV complications of diabetes [125].\n\nAccording to the US guidelines, in patients with a BMI > 30 kg/m2 or with a BMI > 27 kg/m2 and weight-related comorbidities, including T2D, dyslipidaemia and hypertension, pharmacotherapy is recommended as an adjunct to lifestyle modifications [126, 127]. However, the options for anti-obesity pharmacotherapy are because the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved only a few drugs, including phentermine/topiramate extended-release (ER) (only in the USA, not approved by EMA), orlistat, naltrexone (ER)/bupropion (ER), tirzepatide and the GLP-1 RAs liraglutide 3.0 mg daily and semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly [128]. EMA and FDA-approved second-generation anti-obesity medications such as semaglutide and tirzepatide have created a paradigm shift in the current management of obesity and are currently predominantly used for the treatment of diabetes with comorbidities. Many guidelines recommend GLP-1 RAs in the treatment of patients with T2D and concomitant obesity owing to their high efficiency in BW management and glycaemic control of T2D [129,130,131]. Despite the fact that subcutaneous injections of GLP-1 RA may be less tolerated/accepted by patients compared to oral obesity treatments, the efficacy and safety profile of these drugs appear superior to oral treatments and give hope for the reduction of obesity burden and greater prevention of T2D [132] also according to the American Diabetes Association Standards of Care in Diabetes 2024 [133].\n\nThe impact of GLP-1 RAs on BW loss has been demonstrated in many clinical trials. In the phase III SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes clinical trial, the treatment of patients without diabetes with a BMI of at least 30 or a BMI of at least 27 with dyslipidaemia or hypertension with once-daily subcutaneous injections of liraglutide at a dose of 3.0 mg was associated with a mean BW loss of 8.4 ± 7.3 kg (a difference between treatment and control groups of − 5.6 kg, 95% CI − 6.0 to − 5.1; p < 0.001) [134]. The mean total BW loss described in SCALE studies was in the range of − 6% to − 8% with liraglutide 3.0 mg used in individuals with overweight/obesity, dyslipidaemia, prediabetes, T2D and hypertension [48, 135, 136]. In patients with obesity but with normal glucose tolerance, the treatment with GLP-1 RAs has been demonstrated to effectively protect against the development of overt T2D [108]. GLP-1 RAs are also recommended for initial diabetes treatment intensification [28]. In the PIONEER 3 study, orally administered semaglutide at a dose of 7 mg proved more effective than sitagliptin in terms of HbA1c reduction as well as BW reduction [137]. Semaglutide 2.4 mg has been found to promote the greatest BW loss compared to other GLP-1 RAs. In a phase II clinical trial, BW loss was higher in patients on orally administered semaglutide at doses of 2.5–40 mg once daily (dosage-dependent range, − 2.1 to − 6.9 kg) and subcutaneously administered semaglutide (− 6.4 kg) compared to placebo (− 1.2 kg) [138]. Recently, the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has recommended the approval of semaglutide 2.4 mg/day for the management of obesity as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management. Such treatment is indicated in either patients presenting obesity (≥ 30 kg/m2) or overweight individuals with at least one weight-related comorbidity (e.g. prediabetes or T2D, CVD, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnoea, etc.) [139].\n\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head, phase 3 RCTs demonstrated that compared to other GLP-1 RAs, semaglutide induced a significantly higher reduction in HbA1c levels (by 0.44%), in fasting plasma glucose (by 0.48 mmol/L), as well as in BW (by 2.53 kg) and BMI by 0.91 kg/m2 [140]. Individuals treated with semaglutide had significantly higher odds of achieving target HbA1c, and BW loss > 5% and 10% [140].\n\nTreatment of T2D: Focus on GLP-1 RAs\n\nAccording to the American Diabetes Association Standards of Care 2024, metformin should be used as the initial first-line therapy for T2D in patients not meeting the criterion for the presence of ASCVD/increased risk for ASCVD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease [141]. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines [142] advocate the use of GLP-1 RAs (or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 [SGLT2] inhibitors) as first-line therapy in drug-naïve patients with T2D and ASCVD, or high/very high CV risk (target organ damage or multiple RFs). Moreover, GLP-1 RAs are suggested as a second line of therapy, when metformin monotherapy does not allow one to reach the glycaemic target, in drug-naïve patients without ASCVD or those with high/very high CV risk. However, in patients with metformin intolerance or other contraindications, GLP-1 RA can be initiated straight away after the diabetes diagnosis. The introduction of GLP-1 RAs should also be considered in patients who failed to achieve glycaemic goals with other antidiabetic medications or if their HbA1c exceeds the target by 1.5% or more [143].\n\nSemaglutide, dulaglutide and liraglutide have been found to exert the strongest effect on HbA1c reduction [144,145,146]. Semaglutide received approval for the treatment of T2D inadequately controlled on at least one oral glucose-lowering medication [147, 148]. The phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, dosage-finding, 26-week trial demonstrated that semaglutide both orally administered at doses of 2.5-40 mg once daily (dosage-dependent range, − 0.7% to − 1.9%) and subcutaneously (− 1.9%) considerably reduced HbA1c level compared to placebo [138]. Also phase III clinical trials confirmed the efficacy of GLP-1 RA drugs. The effectiveness of once-weekly subcutaneously administered semaglutide in decreasing HbA1c and BW was confirmed in phase 3 SUSTAIN clinical trials [149]. The efficacy of orally administered semaglutide at doses of 3, 7 and 14 mg was also confirmed in a series of 10 phase 3 multicentre, RCTs—the Peptide InnOvatioN for the Early diabEtes tReatment (PIONEER) programme [150]. In terms of HbA1c reduction from baseline, PIONEER 2–4 trials indicated that in patients with established T2D on oral antidiabetic drugs, orally administered semaglutide at a dose of 14 mg was more effective than empagliflozin 25 mg (ETD − 0.4%; p < 0.0001), sitagliptin 100 mg (ETD − 0.5%; p < 0.001) and similar to liraglutide 1.8 mg (ETD − 0.1%; p = 0.0645) after 26 weeks [137, 151, 152]. The effectiveness of dulaglutide in the reduction of fasting plasma and BW was evaluated in the AWARD clinical trial program. HbA1c decrease was − 1.36 ± 0.08% versus exenatide BID in AWARD-1 trial and − 1.08 ± 0.06% versus insulin glargine in the AWARD-2 trial [153,154,155]. In turn, the efficacy of BW lowering was − 0.30 ± 0.29 kg (AWARD-1 trial) and − 1.87 ± 0.24 kg (AWARD-2 trial) [153,154,155].\n\nTreatment of Both Diabetes and Obesity: Focus on GLP-1/Insulin Fix Ratio Combinations and Dual GLP-1/GIP Agonists\n\nThe administration of many drugs used to lower glucose levels, such as insulin, most sulfonylureas (SUs) and glinides causes BW gain due to several mechanisms, including defensive overeating to avoid hypoglycaemia [156]. Therefore, when making a decision concerning treatment, the problem of BW gain should be considered. Drugs that both treat hyperglycaemia and facilitate BW loss, especially GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2is, should be considered in patients with diabetes and obesity [157, 158]. Since the obesity and diabetes form a vicious circle in which one disorder aggravates the other, only the therapy of both can bring expected and satisfactory effects. The administration of GLP-1 RAs promote weight loss; however, the extent depends on type of drug from this class. While lixisenatide (0.7 kg difference vs. placebo) and dulaglutide (1.5 kg vs. placebo) induce small but considerable weight loss, the effects are more pronounced with liraglutide (− 2.3 kg vs. placebo) and semaglutide (− 4.3 subcutaneous and − 3.4 kg oral vs. placebo) [109,110,111, 159]. In cases in which the use of antihyperglycaemic drugs with BW-reducing effects is not possible for any reason, medications that have a neutral impact on BW, including metformin and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors, should be administered [121, 157, 160]. The selection of appropriate treatment requires careful analysis of existing comorbidities, as well as patient preferences and therapy costs [108]. Treatment with SGLT2i is associated with modest BW reduction [161,162,163].\n\nPatients requiring insulin therapy are often recommended to use a fixed-ratio combination comprising long-acting insulin and GLP-1 RA (e.g. degludec/liraglutide or glargine/lixisenatide) since GLP-1 RA neutralizes the insulin-induced BW gain and mitigates the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with insulin. This prevents the drug-related increase in weight [157]. The combination of insulin with GLP-1 RAs was found to mitigate insulin-related BW gain [164, 165]. Moreover, the results of a clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of iGlarLixi (a fixed-ratio combination of insulin glargine and lixisenatide) compared with insulin glargine in inadequately controlled, basal insulin-treated patients with T2D showed that iGlarLixi not only promoted beneficial reductions in HbA1c (from baseline) but also BW loss by 0.7 kg as compared to the increase in patients’ body mass by 0.7 kg with iGlar (1.4 kg difference, p < 0.0001) [164]. In a phase 3b clinical trial (NCT02420262) estimating the effects on BW, IDegLira (insulin degludec/liraglutide fixed-ratio combination) was compared with iGlar U100 and insulin aspart up to four times per day [165]. This trial demonstrated that IDegLira reduced BW, while basal bolus insulin increased it (ETD − 3.6 kg, 95% CI − 4.2 to − 2.9). Moreover, the occurrence of hypoglycaemic events was significantly lower in the IDegLira group. However, no differences between these two treatment alternatives were observed in terms of HbA1c reductions [165].\n\nThe results of large-scale trials (e.g. SURPASS-3, SURMOUNT-1) indicated that the use of dual GLP-1/GIP agonist tirzepatide provided greater BW loss benefits in patients with obesity with/without T2D compared with GLP-1 RAs [166, 167]. The effects were even greater when tirzepatide treatment was accompanied by the implementation of moderate intensity lifestyle interventions [31, 166]. Tirzepatide has been demonstrated to exert various favourable effects on most ‘cardiometabolic continuum’ components and suggested that its beneficial effectiveness related to insulin sensitivity, glycaemia, BW control and β-cell function might be higher compared to GLP-1 RAs [168]. Moreover, it appears to show comparable safety as GLP-1 RAs. In the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 SURPASS-1 trial [169] tirzepatide in different doses (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg) not only significantly improved HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels vs. placebo but also induced a dose-dependent BW loss ranging from 7 to 9.5 kg. Moreover, more than 80% of patients receiving the study drug met HbA1c level targets of < 7% (87–92% vs. 20% on placebo) and ≤ 6.5% (81–86% vs. 10%) without facing increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The safety profile of tirzepatide was consistent with that of GLP-1 RA [169]. Similarly, another clinical study demonstrated that significant reduction in BW associated with the administration of other dual GLP-1/GIP RA (NNC0090-2746, also known as RG7697) was accompanied by improved HbA1c in individuals with T2D, over a 12-week period [170, 171]. BW loss was greater than that of liraglutide [170, 171]."
