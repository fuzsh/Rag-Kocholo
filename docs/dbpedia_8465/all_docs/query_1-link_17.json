Limited data suggests that reduced pamidronate doses (30 to 60 mg) with slower infusion rates (over 4 to 6 hours) may be considered when other agents are not available (Ref); use with caution and only when potential benefits outweigh risks.\n\nPeritoneal dialysis: Avoid use; consider alternative agents. Limited data suggests that reduced pamidronate doses (30 to 60 mg) (Ref) may be considered when other agents are not available. Prolonged infusion (over 4 to 6 hours) should be considered as well (Ref). Monitor closely; nephrotoxicity is a concern as this patient population often has residual kidney function (Ref). Use with caution and only if potential benefit outweighs the potential risk (Ref).\n\nDosing adjustment in patients who develop kidney toxicity during pamidronate therapy:\n\nOsteolytic bone lesions/metastases: Treatment should be withheld for deterioration in kidney function (increase of SCr ≥0.5 mg/dL in patients with normal baseline [SCr <1.4 mg/dL] or ≥1 mg/dL in patients with abnormal baseline [SCr ≥1.4 mg/dL]). Resumption of therapy may be considered when serum creatinine returns to within 10% of baseline (Ref).\n\nMultiple myeloma: American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline recommendations:\n\nKidney function deterioration without an apparent cause: Withhold therapy; may resume at the prior dose when kidney function returns to within 10% of baseline (Ref).\n\nUnexplained albuminuria >500 mg/24 hours: Withhold dose until returns to baseline, then recheck every 3 to 4 weeks; consider reinitiating at a dose not to exceed 90 mg every 4 weeks and with a longer infusion time of at least 4 hours (Ref).\n\nDosing: Hepatic Impairment: Adult\n\nMild to moderate impairment: No dosage adjustment necessary.\n\nSevere impairment: There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer’s labeling (has not been studied).\n\nDosing: Adjustment for Toxicity: Adult\n\nAtypical femur fracture: Consider interrupting bisphosphonate therapy; assess for fracture in the contralateral limb.\n\nHypocalcemia, symptomatic: Initiate short-term calcium therapy as clinically indicated.\n\nMusculoskeletal pain: Consider discontinuing pamidronate in patients who experience severe symptoms; symptoms usually resolve upon discontinuation. Some patients experienced recurrence when rechallenged with same drug or another bisphosphonate.\n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw: Patients developing osteonecrosis of the jaw during therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon (Ref). Clinical judgement should guide management based on assessment of individual patient risks versus benefits.\n\nDosing: Older Adult\n\nRefer to adult dosing. Begin at lower end of adult dosing range.\n\nDosing: Pediatric\n\n(For additional information see \"Pamidronate: Pediatric drug information\")\n\nNote: Due to increased risk of nephrotoxicity, single doses should not exceed 90 mg.\n\nHypercalcemia\n\nHypercalcemia: Limited data available: Children and Adolescents: Dosing based on several case reports and retrospective studies for treatment of hypercalcemia due to malignancy and/or immobility. Administer as a single infusion. Retreatment may be necessary if serum calcium does not return to normal or does not remain normal after initial treatment; reported interval for multiple doses is ≥24 hours.\n\nInitial treatment: IV: 0.5 to 1 mg/kg; maximum dose: 90 mg (Ref)\n\nSevere, life-threatening: IV: 1.5 to 2 mg/kg; maximum dose: 90 mg; in one case report, a higher dose of 4 mg/kg was used to treat a serum calcium concentration of 18.9 mg/dL associated with bone metastases in a 4-year old child with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Ref)\n\nOsteogenesis imperfecta\n\nOsteogenesis imperfecta: Limited data available: Note: Reported dosing regimens variable (ie, weight-directed vs BSA-directed); duration of treatment has not been established; however, the most benefit has been shown to occur in the first 2 to 4 years of treatment (Ref).\n\nWeight-directed dosing (Ref):\n\nInfants and Children <2 years: IV: Initial: 0.25 mg/kg once on day 1, then 0.5 mg/kg/dose daily days 2 and 3 of the first cycle, then 0.5 mg/kg/dose once daily for 3 days for subsequent cycles; cycles are repeated every 2 months for a total yearly dose of 9 mg/kg\n\nChildren 2 to 3 years: IV: Initial: 0.38 mg/kg once on day 1, then 0.75 mg/kg/dose daily days 2 and 3 of the first cycle, then 0.75 mg/kg/dose once daily for 3 days for subsequent cycles; cycles are repeated every 3 months for a total yearly dose of 9 mg/kg\n\nChildren >3 years and Adolescents: IV: Initial: 0.5 mg/kg once on day 1, then 1 mg/kg/dose daily days 2 and 3 of the first cycle, then 1 mg/kg/dose once daily for 3 days for subsequent cycles; cycles are repeated every 4 months for a total yearly dose of 9 mg/kg\n\nBSA-directed dosing: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: Initial: 10 mg/m2/dose once a month for 3 months, then increase to 20 mg/m2/dose once a month for 3 months, then increase to 30 mg/m2/dose once a month for subsequent doses; maximum dose: 40 mg/m2/dose was used in six patients after 1-2 years due to skeletal pain and less bone mineral gain; improvements in mobility and vertebral height was noted in patients who received this regimen for 3 to 6 years (n=11, median age at initiation of therapy: 3.6 months, range: 3 to 13 months) (Ref); another study used the same dosing in 14 prepubescent patients with mild disease (Ref)\n\nOsteopenia associated with cerebral palsy\n\nOsteopenia associated with cerebral palsy (nonambulatory): Limited data available; dosing regimens variable: Children and Adolescents: IV: Initial: 1 mg/kg/dose daily for 3 days; administer every 3 to 4 months; minimum dose: 15 mg; maximum dose: 35 mg. Dosing based on two trials; the first included 14 pediatric patients (age range: 6 to 16 years, treatment group: n=7), and reported an increase in bone mineral density; therapy was used in combination with calcium and vitamin D supplementation (Ref). In the other trial (n=25, age range: 3 to 19 years), a decreased incidence of fractures was noted after 1 year of therapy (Ref). A lower dose was used in a trial of 23 pediatric patients (age range: 4 to 17 years); the initial dose was 0.37 mg/kg on day 1, followed by 0.75 mg/kg on day 2, then 0.75 mg/kg/dose once daily for 2 days was used for subsequent cycles; cycles were repeated every 4 months for 1 year; maximum single dose: 45 mg (Ref).\n\nDosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric\n\nThere are no pediatric-specific recommendations; based on experience in adult patients, dosing adjustment suggested for baseline or renal impairment during therapy.\n\nDosing: Hepatic Impairment: Pediatric\n\nThere are no pediatric-specific recommendations. Based on experience in adult patients, no dosing adjustment recommended for mild to moderate hepatic impairment and for severe impairment, there are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling (has not been studied).\n\nAdverse Reactions\n\nThe following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.\n\n>10%:\n\nCentral nervous system: Fatigue (osteolytic bone metastases: 32% to 40%;

breastfeeding.\n\nWarnings/Precautions\n\nConcerns related to adverse effects:\n\n• Bone fractures: Atypical femur fractures (AFF) have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates. The fractures include subtrochanteric femur (bone just below the hip joint) and diaphyseal femur (long segment of the thigh bone). Some patients experience prodromal pain weeks or months before the fracture occurs. It is unclear if bisphosphonate therapy is the cause for these fractures; atypical femur fractures have also been reported in patients not taking bisphosphonates, and in patients receiving glucocorticoids. Patients receiving long-term (>3 to 5 years) bisphosphonate therapy may be at an increased risk (Adler 2016; NOF [Cosman 2014]).\n\n• Musculoskeletal pain: Infrequently, severe (and occasionally debilitating) bone, joint, and/or muscle pain have been reported during bisphosphonate treatment. The onset of pain ranged from a single day to several months. Symptoms usually resolve upon discontinuation. Some patients experienced recurrence when rechallenged with same drug or another bisphosphonate.\n\n• Electrolyte abnormalities: Pamidronate has been associated with asymptomatic electrolyte abnormalities (including hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia). Rare cases of symptomatic hypocalcemia, including tetany, have been reported.\n\n• Kidney function deterioration: Pamidronate has been associated with kidney function deterioration, progressing to kidney failure and dialysis; kidney function deterioration may occur following the initial or single doses. Glomerulosclerosis (focal segmental), with or without nephrotic syndrome, has also been reported.\n\n• Osteonecrosis of the jaw: Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), also referred to as medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), has been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates. Known risk factors for MRONJ include invasive dental procedures (eg, tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), cancer diagnosis, concomitant therapy (eg, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, ill-fitting dentures, and comorbid disorders (anemia, coagulopathy, infection, preexisting dental or periodontal disease). Risk may increase with increased duration of bisphosphonate use and/or may be reported at a greater frequency based on tumor type (eg, advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma). According to a position paper by the American Association of Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS), MRONJ has been associated with bisphosphonates and other antiresorptive agents (denosumab), and antiangiogenic agents (eg, bevacizumab, sunitinib) used for the treatment of osteoporosis or malignancy; risk is significantly higher in patients with cancer receiving antiresorptive therapy compared to patients receiving osteoporosis treatment (regardless of medication used or dosing schedule). MRONJ risk is also increased with monthly IV antiresorptive therapy compared to the minimal risk associated with oral bisphosphonate use, although risk appears to increase with oral bisphosphonates when duration of therapy exceeds 4 years. The AAOMS suggests that if medically permissible, initiation of IV bisphosphonates for cancer therapy should be delayed until optimal dental health is attained (if extractions are required, antiresorptive therapy should delayed until the extraction site has mucosalized or until after adequate osseous healing). Once IV bisphosphonate therapy is initiated for oncologic disease, procedures that involve direct osseous injury and placement of dental implants should be avoided. Patients developing ONJ during therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon (AAOMS [Ruggiero 2014]).\n\nDisease-related concerns:\n\n• Hypoparathyroidism: Use caution with a history of thyroid surgery; patients may have relative hypoparathyroidism, predisposing them to pamidronate-related hypocalcemia.\n\nWarnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n\nMaintain adequate hydration with therapy (pediatric patients: 2 to 3 L/m2 [Kerdudo, 2005]) and urinary output during treatment; use with caution with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs.\n\nBisphosphonate therapy may not be appropriate for patients with mild osteogenesis imperfect; risk:benefit has not been established. Potential adverse effects in growing children include infusion reactions and effects on bone growth. Influenza-like reactions are common after the first dose occurring at 12 to 36 hours after the infusion and may include fever, rash, and vomiting; treatment with standard antipyretic therapy is usually adequate and symptoms do not generally recur after later doses. Increased height has been reported and theoretical effects of diminishing bone remodeling in a growing child may result in bone malformation or delayed recovery after fractures (Rauch, 2004).\n\nDosage Forms: US\n\nExcipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.

Longer infusion times (>2 hours) may reduce the risk for kidney toxicity, especially in patients with preexisting insufficiency. The manufacturer recommends infusing over 2 to 24 hours for hypercalcemia of malignancy; over 2 hours for osteolytic bone lesions with metastatic breast cancer; and over 4 hours for Paget disease and for osteolytic bone lesions with multiple myeloma (Ref). ASCO guidelines for bisphosphonate use in multiple myeloma recommend infusing pamidronate over at least 2 hours; if therapy is withheld due to kidney toxicity, infuse over at least 4 hours upon reintroduction of treatment after kidney function recovery; infuse over 4 to 6 hours in patients with preexisting severe kidney function impairment and extensive bone disease (Ref).\n\nAdministration: Pediatric\n\nParenteral: IV: Infusion rate varies by indication; longer infusion times (>2 hours) may reduce the risk for renal toxicity, especially in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency. In pediatric trials, infusion times were 4 hours for osteogenesis imperfecta, 3 to 4 hours for osteopenia from immobility, and 4 to 6 hours for hypercalcemia; a 24-hour infusion has also been used (Ref).\n\nHazardous Drugs Handling Considerations\n\nHazardous agent (NIOSH 2016 [group 3]).\n\nUse appropriate precautions for receiving, handling, storage, preparation, dispensing, transporting, administration, and disposal. Follow NIOSH and USP 800 recommendations and institution-specific policies/procedures for appropriate containment strategy (NIOSH 2016; USP-NF 2020).\n\nNote: Facilities may perform risk assessment of some hazardous drugs to determine if appropriate for alternative handling and containment strategies (USP-NF 2020). Refer to institution-specific handling policies/procedures.\n\nUse: Labeled Indications\n\nHypercalcemia of malignancy: Treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, with or without bone metastases, in conjunction with adequate hydration.\n\nOsteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer and osteolytic lesions of multiple myeloma: Treatment of osteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer and osteolytic lesions of multiple myeloma, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy.\n\nPaget disease, moderate to severe: Treatment of patients with moderate to severe Paget disease of bone.\n\nNote: Guidelines recommend IV zoledronic acid as the preferred treatment (ES [Singer 2014]; Ralston 2019).\n\nUse: Off-Label: Adult\n\nProstate cancer, bone loss associated with androgen deprivation therapy, prevention; Thyroid carcinoma, symptomatic bone metastases\n\nMedication Safety Issues\n\nSound-alike/look-alike issues:\n\nAredia may be confused with Adriamycin\n\nPamidronate may be confused with papaverine\n\nMetabolism/Transport Effects\n\nNone known.\n\nDrug Interactions\n\nNote: Interacting drugs may not be individually listed below if they are part of a group interaction (eg, individual drugs within “CYP3A4 Inducers [Strong]” are NOT listed). For a complete list of drug interactions by individual drug name and detailed management recommendations, use the drug interactions program by clicking on the “Launch drug interactions program” link above.\n\nAminoglycosides: May enhance the hypocalcemic effect of Bisphosphonate Derivatives. Aminoglycosides may enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Bisphosphonate Derivatives. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n\nAngiogenesis Inhibitors (Systemic): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Bisphosphonate Derivatives. Specifically, the risk for osteonecrosis of the jaw may be increased. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n\nCapecitabine: Bisphosphonate Derivatives may enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Capecitabine. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n\nDeferasirox: Bisphosphonate Derivatives may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Deferasirox. Specifically, the risk for GI ulceration/irritation or GI bleeding may be increased. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n\nInhibitors of the Proton Pump (PPIs and PCABs): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Bisphosphonate Derivatives. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n\nNonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Bisphosphonate Derivatives. Both an increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and an increased risk of nephrotoxicity are of concern. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n\nThalidomide: May enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Pamidronate. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n\nReproductive Considerations\n\nBisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix and gradually released over time. Because exposure prior to pregnancy may theoretically increase the risk of fetal harm, most sources recommend discontinuing bisphosphonate therapy in patients who could become pregnant as early as possible prior to a planned pregnancy. Use in premenopausal patients should be reserved for special circumstances when rapid bone loss is occurring; a bisphosphonate with the shortest half-life should then be used (Bhalla 2010; Pereira 2012; Stathopoulos 2011).\n\nPregnancy Considerations\n\nIt is not known if bisphosphonates cross the placenta, but based on their lower molecular weight, fetal exposure is expected (Djokanovic 2008; Stathopoulos 2011).\n\nInformation related to the use of pamidronate in pregnancy is available from case reports and small retrospective studies (Baretić 2014; Green 2014; Koren 2018; Levy 2009; Stathopoulos 2011).\n\nBisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix and gradually released over time. The amount available in the systemic circulation varies by drug, dose, and duration of therapy. Theoretically, there may be a risk of fetal harm when pregnancy follows the completion of therapy (hypocalcemia, low birth weight, and decreased gestation have been observed in some case reports); however, available data have not shown that exposure to bisphosphonates during pregnancy significantly increases the risk of adverse fetal events (Djokanovic 2008; Green 2014; Levy 2009; Machairiotis 2019; Sokal 2019; Stathopoulos 2011). Exposed infants should be monitored for hypocalcemia after birth (Djokanovic 2008; Stathopoulos 2011).\n\nBreastfeeding Considerations\n\nIt is not known if pamidronate is present in breast milk.\n\nPamidronate was not detected in the milk of a breastfeeding patient receiving pamidronate 30 mg IV monthly (therapy started ~6 months postpartum). Following the first infusion, milk was pumped and collected for 0 to 24 hours and 25 to 48 hours and each day pooled for analysis. Pamidronate readings were below the limit of quantification (<0.4 micromole/L). During therapy, breast milk was pumped and discarded for the first 48 hours following each infusion prior to resuming breastfeeding. The infant was breastfed >80% of the time; adverse events were not observed in the breastfed infant (Simonoski 2000). Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant, the manufacturer recommends a decision be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of treatment to the mother.\n\nDietary Considerations\n\nMultiple myeloma or metastatic bone lesions from solid tumors or Paget disease: Administer adequate daily calcium and vitamin D supplement (if patient is not hypercalcemic).\n\nMonitoring Parameters\n\nSerum creatinine (prior to each treatment); serum electrolytes, including calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and potassium; CBC with differential (patients with preexisting anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia should be closely monitored during the first 2 weeks of treatment); monitor for hypocalcemia for at least 2 weeks after therapy; in addition, monitor urine albumin every 3 to 6 months in patients with multiple myeloma. Dental exam and preventive dentistry prior to therapy for patients at risk of osteonecrosis, including all patients with cancer, as well as ongoing monitoring for jaw pain, gum swelling/infection, and other signs/symptoms of osteonecrosis of the jaw. Evaluate for femur fracture in patients presenting with thigh or groin pain with a history of receiving bisphosphonates. If femoral fracture occurs, assess for fracture in the contralateral limb.\n\nMultiple myeloma: Monitor serum creatinine (prior to each dose), serum calcium (regularly); vitamin D levels (intermittently), spot urine sample for albuminuria (every 3 to 6 months; for unexplained albuminuria, obtain 24-hour urine collection to assess urinary albumin; reassess every 3 to 4 weeks with 24-hour urine collection for total protein and urine protein electrophoresis until kidney function returns to baseline) (ASCO [Anderson 2018]).\n\nPaget disease: Serum total alkaline phosphatase at 6 to 12 weeks for initial response to treatment (when bone turnover will have shown a substantial decline) and potentially at 6 months (maximal suppression of high bone turnover); following treatment completion, monitor at ~6 to 12-month intervals (Endocrine Society [Singer 2014]); monitoring more specific biochemical markers of bone turnover (eg, serum P1NP, NTX, serum beta-CTx) is generally only warranted in patients with Paget disease who have abnormal liver or biliary tract function or when early assessment of response to treatment is needed (eg, spinal compression, very active disease) (Endocrine Society [Singer 2014]); serum calcium and 25(OH)D; phosphorus and magnesium; symptoms of hypocalcemia, pain (posttreatment pain may not strictly correlate with increased biochemical markers [Ralston 2019])\n\nProstate cancer: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-associated osteoporosis: Monitor BMD every 18 to 24 months (IOF [Cianferotti 2017]).\n\nMechanism of Action\n\nPamidronate is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate; it inhibits bone resorption by disrupting osteoclast activity (Rogers 2011).\n\nPharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n\nOnset of action:\n\nHypercalcemia of malignancy: Reduction of albumin-corrected serum calcium: Children: ~48 hours (Kerdudo 2005); Adults: ≤24 hours for decrease in albumin-corrected serum calcium.\n\nPaget disease: ~1 month for ≥50% decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase.\n\nMaximum effect: Hypercalcemia of malignancy: ≤7 days.\n\nDuration: HCM: 7 to 14 days; Paget disease: 1 to 372 days.\n\nAbsorption: Poorly from the GI tract.\n\nDistribution: Binds to hydroxyapatite crystals in bone; distribution to bone is incompletely understood (Cremers 2019; manufacturer's labeling).\n\nMetabolism: Not metabolized.\n\nHalf-life elimination: 28 ± 7 hours (plasma elimination); rate of elimination from bone has not been determined.\n\nExcretion: Urine (exclusive route of elimination; 30% to 62% of dose as unchanged drug within 120 hours [remainder of dose retained in the body]; lower in patients with kidney dysfunction)."
