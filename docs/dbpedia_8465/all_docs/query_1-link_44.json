        "text": "Antibiotics, corticosteroids and xanthines\n\nWhen treating an exacerbation adding oral or intravenous corticosteroids and/or antibiotics is recommended, depending on symptom severity and the presence of infection.1,4,6–8,31 Antibiotics should only be used for the treatment of infectious4,6,8,31 or severe exacerbations.31 The GOLD 2018 and NHS 2014 documents recommend antibiotics for patients with COPD exacerbations who have three cardinal symptoms – increase in dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence7 (Evidence B)1; have two of the cardinal symptoms, if increased purulence of sputum is one of the two symptoms7 (Evidence C)1; or require mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive) (Evidence B).1\n\nAntibiotics have been shown to reduce the risk of short-term mortality, treatment failure and sputum purulence, and a study in COPD patients with exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive) indicated that not treating with antibiotics was associated with increased mortality and a greater incidence of secondary nosocomial pneumonia.1 A Cochrane review concluded that antibiotics for very severe COPD exacerbations showed wide and consistent beneficial effects across outcomes of patients admitted to an ICU,32 but this conclusion was based on data from a single study.32\n\nThe NHS protocol for management of COPD exacerbations in primary care states that bronchodilators and corticosteroids are the mainstay of exacerbation treatment.7 However, a systematic review of 19 COPD guidelines reported that the criteria for treating patients with antibiotics were largely based on an increase in respiratory symptoms, while systemic corticosteroids were often universally recommended for all patients with acute exacerbations.33 The authors also concluded that current COPD guidelines are of little help in identifying patients with acute exacerbations who are likely to benefit from treatment with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics in primary care, which might contribute to overuse or inappropriate use of either treatment.\n\nSome biomarkers have been suggested as useful for optimizing antibiotic treatment. The GOLD 2018 document1 does not recommend that CRP be used routinely but state that several studies have suggested that procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment reduces antibiotic exposure and side effects with the same clinical efficacy. This observation is corroborated by a Cochrane review demonstrating that procalcitonin can guide antibiotic therapy.32 In contrast, other authors reported that CRP might be a more valuable marker,34 and a real-life primary care study concluded that performing CRP rapid tests led general practitioners to prescribe fewer antibiotics than those who did not.35\n\nFor all patients, the choice of antibiotic should be guided by the local bacterial resistance pattern,1,8 the microbiology story of the patient and his/her risk factors.\n\nUsually initial empirical treatment encompasses aminopenicillin with clavulanic acid, a macrolide, or a tetracycline.1,8 However, the long-term use of macrolides may be associated with important side-effects and the risk of developing bacterial resistance.36 Sputum should be sent for culture (in the case of patients with frequent exacerbations, severe airflow limitation, and/or exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation1), as gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas species) or resistant pathogens that are not sensitive to the above-mentioned antibiotics may be present.1\n\nAlthough the most effective duration of treatment is still to be defined,32 the recommended length of antibiotic therapy is usually 5–7 days (Evidence D)1 but treatment duration will depend on the antibiotic used.\n\nThe management of exacerbations in primary care should include maximization of bronchodilator therapy and systemic corticosteroids if not contraindicated (30mg prednisolone) for 7 days.1,7,8 Therapy with oral prednisolone is equally as effective as intravenous administration.1 The GOLD 2018 document recommends a dose of 40mg prednisone per day for 5 days1 whilst NICE 2016 recommends a dose of 30mg for 7–14 days, and further recommends that a course of corticosteroid treatment should not be longer than 14 days as there is no advantage in prolonged therapy.8 The use of systemic corticosteroids in COPD exacerbations have been shown to shorten recovery time, improve lung function, improve oxygenation, decrease the risk of early relapse and treatment failure, and decrease the length of hospitalization.1\n\nA meta-analysis confirmed that the rate of treatment success increased with systemic corticosteroids in comparison to usual care of COPD exacerbations. Corticosteroids seem to be beneficial to the whole population in terms of treatment success rate.37\n\nSome studies suggest that corticosteroids may be less efficacious in treating acute COPD exacerbations in patients with lower levels of blood eosinophils.15,38\n\nAs for methylxanthines in the management of COPD exacerbations, current evidence does not support their use, given that the possible beneficial effects in lung function and clinical endpoints are modest and inconsistent, whilst adverse events are significant.1,4,6,31 Intravenous methylxanthines (theophylline or aminophylline) may be considered second-line therapy and used as an add-on when there is insufficient response. When using theophylline, it is necessary to monitor blood levels, side effects and potential drug interactions.8,31\n\nTherapeutics – risk stratification\n\nExacerbations of COPD may be classified as mild, moderate, severe6 and very severe. Very severe exacerbations require admission to the ICU, with invasive ventilation, and are outside the scope of this paper.\n\nAs previously mentioned, exacerbations of COPD are very heterogeneous making it particularly relevant to determine their etiology, pathology, severity and risk as all of these factors will have implications in the prognosis, pharmacological treatment and place of treatment.\n\nIn terms of pharmacological treatment and place of treatment, if exacerbations are mild and non-infectious,1,4,7,8,31 they may be treated at home with an increase in the dosage of maintenance bronchodilators.6,17 If the exacerbation is infectious4,8,31 an antibiotic should be given.1,7\n\nModerate exacerbations should be treated in the ER and the patient then discharged as these exacerbations do not require hospitalization, unless the hospitalization occurs for socioeconomic reasons. The dosage of maintenance bronchodilators should be increased6,17 and the patient been given an oral corticosteroid6,17,18 for 5 days.1,38,39 If the exacerbation is infectious4,8,31 an antibiotic should be given.1,7\n\nIn the case of a patient who has had a severe exacerbation, requiring hospitalization, the patient should be reclassified as a frequent exacerbator. Usually, hospitalization due to a severe exacerbation requires modification of inhaled maintenance treatment including O2 if the patient is hypoxemic and non-invasive ventilation if patient has hypercapnia, greater than 52cm H2O and/or acidemia,1,4,6,8 oral or intravenous corticosteroids (for 5 days)1,38,39 and antibiotic if infectious,1,7 xanthines if there is an inadequate response to treatment4,8,16,31 and prevention of pulmonary thromboembolism."
