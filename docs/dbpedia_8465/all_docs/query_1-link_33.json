        "meta_description": "Objective Digital healthcare systems could provide insights into the global prevalence of heart failure (HF). We designed the CardioRenal and Metabolic disease (CaReMe) HF study to estimate the prevalence, key clinical adverse outcomes and costs of HF across 11 countries.\n\nMethods Individual level data from a contemporary cohort of 6 29 624 patients with diagnosed HF was obtained from digital healthcare systems in participating countries using a prespecified, common study plan, and summarised using a random effects meta-analysis. A broad definition of HF (any registered HF diagnosis) and a strict definition (history of hospitalisation for HF) were used. Event rates were reported per 100 patient years. Cumulative hospital care costs per patient were calculated for a period of up to 5 years.\n\nResults The prevalence of HF was 2.01% (95% CI 1.65 to 2.36) and 1.05% (0.85 to 1.25) according to the broad and strict definitions, respectively. In patients with HF (broad definition), mean age was 75.2 years (95% CI 74.0 to 76.4), 48.8% (40.9–56.8%) had ischaemic heart disease and 34.5% (29.4–39.6%) had diabetes. In 51 442 patients with a recorded ejection fraction (EF), 39.1% (30.3–47.8%) had a reduced, 18.8% (13.5–24.0%) had a mildly reduced and 42.1% (31.5–52.8%) had a preserved left ventricular EF. In 1 69 518 patients with recorded estimated glomerular filtration rate, 49% had chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages III–V. Event rates were highest for cardiorenal disease (HF or CKD) and all cause mortality (19.3 (95% CI 11.3 to 27.1) and 13.1 (11.1 to 15.1), respectively), and lower for myocardial infarction, stroke and peripheral artery disease. Hospital care costs were highest for cardiorenal diseases.\n\nConclusions We estimate that 1–2% of the contemporary adult population has HF. These individuals are at significant risk of adverse outcomes and associated costs, predominantly driven by hospitalisations for HF or CKD. There is considerable public health potential in understanding the contemporary burden of HF and the importance of optimising its management.\n\nNo data are available. The data sources used in the present are all underlying local, ethical and privacy restrictions for data transfer abroad or into public domain, limiting data availability on request. Therefore, the data that support the findings of this study are not available on request.",

        "text": "A population burdened by comorbidities\n\nThe average age (75 years) of the patients in this study was higher than that of the populations included in several randomised clinical trials and cohort studies focused on heart failure.4–8 Although the burden of comorbidities differed between countries, this study demonstrated that overall, around 50% of patients had ischaemic heart disease, one third had diabetes and about 50% had eGFR verified stage III–V chronic kidney disease (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2), of which most (78%) were stage IIIa or stage IIIb. This indicates that contemporary patients with heart failure in clinical practice are generally older and burdened with more comorbidities than previously reported in single country studies (routine healthcare settings) that are now ageing.11 13 17 This might partly be explained by a general trend of increasing survival, highlighting the importance of access to contemporary data to better understand the current population with heart failure.\n\nCardiorenal syndrome (heart failure and chronic kidney disease) has been associated with a substantially higher mortality risk than atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.18 19 This study reports a high prevalence of cardiorenal syndrome. The highest hospitalisation rates after the first year were related to cardiorenal causes, further emphasising the deleterious interaction between heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and highlighting the importance of detecting chronic kidney disease in patients with heart failure.19\n\nHospital healthcare costs in a population with heart failure\n\nThe cumulative costs analyses account for repeated events, rather than the time to first event. This provided the capacity to demonstrate that, over a 5 year period, hospital healthcare costs in patients with heart failure were mainly driven by cardiorenal events, and to a lesser extent by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events, further highlighting the need for improved cardiorenal prevention and management.\n\nObservational data collected from contemporary, real world, routine, clinical practice settings at all healthcare levels are of increasing importance given that heart failure management is rapidly changing due to paradigm shifting trials3–8 and updated guidelines.9–11 Hence real time understanding of the characteristics of patients with heart failure, as well as its burden and treatment, in routine real world clinical practice is warranted to understand unmet clinical needs and the current implementation of new guidelines.23 24 For instance, it displays a truer comorbidity pattern of patients in need of intensified prevention, and thus informs how healthcare resources could be optimised. Further, it illustrates more realistic patterns and event rates resulting from heart failure than does the clinical trial setting, including more per protocol follow-up or disease specific registries where patients are often selected based on hospitalisation for heart failure. Moreover, data from the present study have been collected by all types of healthcare professionals interacting with patients with heart failure, and not only in a cardiology setting. Indeed, event rates in the present study were also higher than those in the most recent HFrEF trials, as discussed above. Finally, for researchers planning and interpreting clinical trial findings, the understanding of differences in characteristics and event rates across countries might be important to acknowledge if unexpected heterogeneity is seen in relation to treatment effects.25\n\nThis study used digital healthcare data to characterise over 600 000 patients with heart failure who were in routine clinical care. The recorded diagnoses for heart failure and chronic kidney disease used in that protocol have been validated previously, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity (online supplemental material (3–6)).\n\nDespite the strengths of this study, the findings should be interpreted with caution. The generalisability of our results to populations with very different circumstances in terms of race, resources or care is unknown. The prevalence of heart failure was not obtained in three of the 11 participating countries since estimation of the background population was missing. However, the robustness of the findings were supported by their consistency across heterogenous data sources (figure 2), representative population data (all countries) and different ethnicities (American, Asian and European; figure 1). Undetected and unreported heart failure in patients was not possible to assess in this study and might therefore underestimate the true prevalence. This study only assessed outcomes requiring hospital care, which might have also underestimated event rates with less severe conditions (eg, those managed in primary care). Some variables were not available in the registries (eg, ejection fraction (available in 20% of the population), eGFR (available in 62%), hypertension history, diabetes duration, body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, physical activity, stress, socioeconomic and environmental factors), limiting the descriptive capacity of this study. Further, data sources were limited to high income countries.\n\nAlthough hospital healthcare costs were obtained in six out of the 11 participating countries, the available data covers 74% of the total population with heart failure, providing an indication of what healthcare costs could amount to across all countries in the analysis. It was assumed that the national healthcare and reimbursement structure specifics would affect different diseases similarly, and that within country ranking of costs for different diseases would therefore be possible. Renal replacement therapy costs were handled differently in different countries and this is likely to affect some within country rankings; notably, rankings were nonetheless quite similar between countries. However, ultimately, total healthcare costs are likely to be underestimated in this study as most costs are attributed to hospital care and do not account for non-hospital related costs (eg, primary care, drugs, indirect disease burden (eg, sick leave), etc)."
