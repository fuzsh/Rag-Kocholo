After the initial dose, may administer cyanocobalamin on the same day as pemetrexed; administer with oral folic acid supplementation.\n\nPralatrexate:\n\nIM: 1,000 mcg every 8 to 10 weeks, beginning within 10 weeks prior to pralatrexate treatment initiation; administer with oral folic acid supplementation (Ref). After the initial dose, may administer cyanocobalamin on the same day as pralatrexate.\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency, treatment\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency, treatment:\n\nNote: Folic acid supplementation may also be required.\n\nSevere/Symptomatic anemia or neurologic/neuropsychiatric findings:\n\nInitial therapy:\n\nIM, deep SUBQ: 1,000 mcg 1 to 3 times/week or once daily for 1 week, then 1,000 mcg once weekly for 4 to 8 weeks (Ref). Alternatively, if neurologic symptoms are present, may initiate 1,000 mcg every other day for up to 3 weeks or until no further improvement in signs or symptoms, then switch to 1,000 mcg once weekly for up to 12 weeks (Ref).\n\nMaintenance therapy:\n\nNote: Continue parenteral therapy until the deficiency has been corrected and signs and symptoms have resolved before switching to oral therapy (Ref).\n\nIM, deep SUBQ: 1,000 mcg once monthly (Ref).\n\nOral, Sublingual: 1,000 to 2,000 mcg once daily (Ref).\n\nMild symptoms or asymptomatic:\n\nIM, deep SUBQ: Initial: 1,000 mcg once weekly for 4 to 8 weeks; maintenance dose: 1,000 mcg once monthly (Ref).\n\nOral, Sublingual: 1,000 to 2,000 mcg once daily (Ref). Note: In patients with impaired GI absorption (eg, pernicious anemia, bariatric surgery), or in whom adherence must be assured, parenteral administration may be required (Ref).\n\nIntranasal (Nascobal): Initial: 500 mcg (1 spray) in 1 nostril once weekly. Consider an alternative route if vitamin B12 levels are persistently low after 1 month of treatment. Note: Some experts do not use intranasal formulations due to variable absorption (Ref).\n\nDuration of therapy: Continue indefinitely in patients with pernicious anemia or other irreversible cause of deficiency (eg, bariatric surgery); may discontinue therapy if a reversible cause of deficiency (eg, reduced dietary intake) has been addressed (Ref).\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency, prevention\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency, prevention:\n\nNote: For use in patients with risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency (eg, bariatric or gastric surgery, disorders of the stomach or terminal ileum, vegan or vegetarian diet) (Ref).\n\nOral, Sublingual: 350 to 1,000 mcg once daily; in patients with pernicious anemia, higher doses (eg, 1,000 to 2,000 mcg/day) are required (Ref).\n\nIM, deep SUBQ: 1,000 mcg once monthly or 1,000 to 3,000 mcg once every 6 to 12 months (Ref). Note: May be preferred in patients with impaired GI absorption (eg, pernicious anemia, bariatric surgery), or for whom adherence to oral therapy is challenging (Ref).\n\nIntranasal (Nascobal): 500 mcg (1 spray) in 1 nostril once weekly. Consider an alternative route if adequate vitamin B12 levels cannot be maintained. Note: Some experts do not use intranasal formulations due to variable absorption (Ref).\n\nDuration of therapy: Continue indefinitely in patients with pernicious anemia or other irreversible cause of deficiency (eg, bariatric surgery); may discontinue therapy if a reversible cause of deficiency (eg, reduced dietary intake) has been addressed (Ref).\n\nDosing: Kidney Impairment: Adult\n\nThere are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling. Some formulations may also contain aluminum, which may accumulate in renal impairment.\n\nDosing: Hepatic Impairment: Adult\n\nThere are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling.\n\nDosing: Older Adult\n\nRefer to adult dosing.\n\nDosing: Pediatric\n\n(For additional information see \"Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12): Pediatric drug information\")\n\nPernicious anemia\n\nPernicious anemia: Note: Concurrent folic acid supplementation may also be needed.\n\nManufacturer's labeling: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IM, SubQ: 100 mcg once daily for 6 to 7 days; if improvement occurs, administer 100 mcg on alternate days for 7 doses, then every 3 to 4 days for 2 to 3 weeks; once hematologic values have returned to normal, maintenance dose: 100 mcg monthly.\n\nAlternate dosing: Limited data available: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IM, SubQ: Initial: 1,000 mcg/day for 2 to 7 days based upon clinical response; followed by 100 mcg once weekly for 4 weeks and then maintenance dose: 100 mcg/month; for severe anemia, a lower initial dose of 0.2 mcg/kg/dose for 2 days followed by the above regimen has been recommended due to potential hypokalemia observed during initial treatment of adults with severe anemia (Ref); however, in more recent experience, while some adult patients may experience hypokalemia with initial treatment, this is unlikely to be clinically significant (Ref). For infants and young children, some experts have recommended doses as low as 50 to 100 mcg (Ref).\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency, severe\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency, severe: Limited data available; dosing regimens variable:\n\nDietary deficiency: Infants (breastfed with vitamin B12 deficient mothers): IM: 250 to 1,000 mcg once daily for 1 to 2 weeks, followed by weekly dosing until patient recovers (Ref); patients with neurologic symptoms have been treated with doses of 1,000 mcg (Ref).\n\nMalabsorption: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IM: 250 to 1,000 mcg daily or every other day for 1 week, then weekly for 4 to 8 weeks, and then monthly for life; younger children should receive monthly doses of 100 mcg (Ref). For infants and young children, some experts have recommended doses as low as 50 to 100 mcg (Ref).\n\nDosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric\n\nThere are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling. Some formulations may also contain aluminum, which may accumulate in renal impairment.\n\nDosing: Hepatic Impairment: Pediatric\n\nThere are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling.\n\nAdverse Reactions\n\nThe following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.\n\n>10%:\n\nCentral nervous system: Headache (IM: 20%; intranasal: 4%)\n\nInfection: Infection (12% to 13%)\n\nNeuromuscular & skeletal: Asthenia (IM: 16%; intranasal: 4%)\n\n1% to 10%:\n\nCentral nervous system: Paresthesia (4%)\n\nGastrointestinal: Glossitis (nasal: 4%), nausea (4%)\n\nRespiratory: Rhinitis (4% to 8%)\n\nFrequency not defined:\n\nCardiovascular: Cardiac failure, thrombosis (peripheral)\n\nDermatologic: Pruritus, skin rash (transient)\n\nEndocrine & metabolic: Hypokalemia\n\nGastrointestinal: Diarrhea\n\nHematologic & oncologic: Polycythemia vera, thrombocythemia\n\nHypersensitivity: Anaphylactic shock (IM/SubQ)\n\nRespiratory: Pulmonary edema\n\nMiscellaneous: Swelling\n\nContraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), cobalt, or any component of the formulation\n\nWarnings/Precautions\n\nConcerns related to adverse effects:\n\n• CNS effects: Vitamin B12 deficiency for >3 months results in irreversible degenerative CNS lesions; neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid unless vitamin B12 is also given. Spinal cord degeneration might also occur when folic acid used as a substitute for vitamin B12 in anemia prevention.\n\n• Hypokalemia: According to the manufacturer, treatment of severe vitamin B12 megaloblastic anemia may result in severe hypokalemia, sometimes fatal, due to intracellular potassium shift upon anemia resolution; however, in more recent experience, while some patients may experience hypokalemia with initial treatment, this is unlikely to be clinically significant (Carmel 2008).\n\n• Thrombocytosis: Treatment of severe vitamin B12 megaloblastic anemia may result in thrombocytosis.\n\nDisease-related concerns:\n\n• Leber disease: Patients with Leber disease who received vitamin B12 treatment have suffered from severe rapid optic atrophy. Use of cyanocobalamin in these patients is not recommended.\n\n• Megaloblastic anemia: Vitamin B12 doses >10 mcg daily may produce a hematologic response in patients with folate deficient megaloblastic anemia and mask previously unrecognized folate deficiency; vitamin B12 is not a substitute for folic acid.\n\n• Polycythemia vera: Vitamin B12 deficiency masks signs of polycythemia vera; vitamin B12 administration may unmask this condition.\n\nDosage form specific issues:\n\n• Aluminum: The parenteral product may contain aluminum; toxic aluminum concentrations may be seen with high doses, prolonged use, or renal dysfunction. Premature neonates are at higher risk due to immature renal function and aluminum intake from other parenteral sources. Parenteral aluminum exposure of >4 to 5 mcg/kg/day is associated with CNS and bone toxicity; tissue loading may occur at lower doses (Federal Register, 2002). See manufacturer's labeling.\n\n• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension and cardiovascular collapse (AAP [\"Inactive\" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.\n\n• Intranasal administration: The effectiveness of intranasal cyanocobalamin in patients with allergic rhinitis, nasal congestion, and upper respiratory tract infections has not been determined. Defer treatment until symptoms have subsided.\n\nOther warnings/precautions:\n\n• IV administration: Avoid intravenous route; anaphylactic shock has occurred.\n\n• Test dose: Intradermal test dose of vitamin B12 is recommended for any patient suspected of cyanocobalamin hypersensitivity prior to administration.\n\nDosage Forms Considerations\n\nNote: Not all available strengths or formulations may be represented in Dosage Forms.\n\nDosage Forms: US\n\nExcipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.

Do not cut, crush, or chew. Switch to an IR tablet, chewable tablet, orally disintegrating or sublingual tablet, oral solution drops, or a nonoral formulation such as injection or nasal spray.\n\nAdministration: Pediatric\n\nOral: Not generally recommended for treatment of severe vitamin B12 deficiency due to poor oral absorption (lack of intrinsic factor); oral administration may be used in less severe deficiencies and maintenance therapy; may be administered without regard to food\n\nParenteral: IM or deep SubQ are preferred routes of administration: Avoid IV administration due to a more rapid system elimination with resulting decreased utilization\n\nUse: Labeled Indications\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency: Treatment of pernicious anemia or vitamin B12 deficiency due to dietary deficiencies, gastrointestinal malabsorption, folic acid deficiency, parasitic infestation, inadequate secretion of intrinsic factor, or inadequate utilization of B12 (eg, during neoplastic treatment); prevention of vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with increased B12 requirements (eg, due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemorrhage, malignancy, liver or kidney disease).\n\nUse: Off-Label: Adult\n\nAphthous stomatitis, simple, recurrent\n\nMetabolism/Transport Effects\n\nNone known.\n\nDrug Interactions\n\nNote: Interacting drugs may not be individually listed below if they are part of a group interaction (eg, individual drugs within “CYP3A4 Inducers [Strong]” are NOT listed). For a complete list of drug interactions by individual drug name and detailed management recommendations, use the drug interactions program by clicking on the “Launch drug interactions program” link above.\n\nChloramphenicol (Systemic): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vitamin B12. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n\nFood Interactions\n\nHeavy ethanol consumption >2 weeks may impair vitamin B12 absorption.\n\nPregnancy Considerations\n\nWater soluble vitamins cross the placenta. Absorption of vitamin B12 may increase during pregnancy. Vitamin B12 requirements may be increased in pregnant women compared to nonpregnant women. Serum concentrations of vitamin B12 are higher in the neonate at birth than the mother (IOM 1998).\n\nBreastfeeding Considerations\n\nVitamin B12 is found in breast milk. Milk concentrations are similar to maternal serum concentrations and concentrations may be decreased in women who are vegetarians. Vitamin B12 requirements may be increased in nursing women compared to nonbreastfeeding women (IOM 1998).\n\nMonitoring Parameters\n\nVitamin B12, hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte and reticulocyte count; obtain serum folate and iron levels prior to treatment; vitamin B12 and peripheral blood counts should be monitored 1 month after beginning treatment (and vitamin B12 1 month after each dosage adjustment if using intranasal formulation), then every 3 to 6 months thereafter.\n\nEvaluate serum methylmalonic acid and total homocysteine levels at baseline (prior to supplementation) in untreated patients to confirm vitamin B12 deficiency (and extent of deficiency); repeat to confirm adequate supplementation (Stabler 2013).\n\nMegaloblastic/Pernicious anemia: In addition to normal hematological parameters, serum potassium and platelet counts should be monitored during therapy. Note: Some patients may develop hypokalemia during initial treatment; however, this is unlikely to be clinically significant (Carmel 2008).\n\nBariatric surgery: Vitamin B12 levels at baseline and once a year postoperatively then every 3 to 6 months if supplemented; every trimester during pregnancy (Mechanick 2020). In patients on chronic administration of medications known to increase risk of B12 deficiency (eg, colchicine, metformin, neomycin, nitrous oxide, proton pump inhibitors, seizure medication), screen every 3 months for the initial postoperative year and then annually (Parrott 2017). Serum methylmalonic acid is the recommended assay to evaluate vitamin B12 levels for patients who are asymptomatic, symptomatic, have a history of B12 deficiency, or preexisting neuropathy (Parrott 2017). Monitor for early signs/symptoms of B12 deficiency, including pernicious anemia (pale skin/eyes, glossitis, fatigue, anorexia, diarrhea) or neuropathy (numbness, paresthesia in extremities, ataxia, decreased reflexes), lightheadedness or vertigo, dyspnea, tinnitus, palpitations, and /or increased heart rate; monitor for advanced signs/symptoms of B12 deficiency, including angina, heart failure symptoms and/or mental status changes (Parrott 2017).\n\nReference Range\n\nNormal range of serum B12 is 200 to 800 pg/mL (SI: 147.5 to 589.8 pmol/L); this represents 0.1% of total body content. Metabolic requirements are 2 to 5 mcg/day; years of deficiency are required before hematologic and neurologic signs and symptoms are seen. Occasional patients with significant neuropsychiatric abnormalities may have no hematologic abnormalities and normal serum cobalamin levels, 200 pg/mL (SI: 147.5 pmol/L), or more commonly between 100 to 200 pg/mL (SI: 73.7 to 147.5 pmol/L).\n\nGastric bypass surgery patients: Normal B12 range: 200 to 1,000 pg/mL (SI: 147.5 to 737.3 pmol/L); Deficiency critical range: B12: <400 pg/mL (SI: <294.9 pmol/L) (suboptimal) and <200 pg/mL (SI: <147.5 pmol/L) (deficient) (Parrott 2017).\n\nMechanism of Action\n\nCoenzyme for various metabolic functions, including fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis, used in cell replication and hematopoiesis\n\nPharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n\nOnset of action:\n\nMegaloblastic anemia: IM:\n\nConversion of megaloblastic to normoblastic erythroid hyperplasia within bone marrow: 8 hours.\n\nIncreased reticulocytes: 2 to 5 days,\n\nComplicated vitamin B12 deficiency: IM, SUBQ: Resolution of:\n\nPsychiatric sequelae: 24 hours.\n\nThrombocytopenia: 10 days.\n\nGranulocytopenia: 2 weeks.\n\nAbsorption: Oral: Variable from the terminal ileum; requires the presence of calcium and gastric \"intrinsic factor\" to transfer the compound across the intestinal mucosa.\n\nDistribution: Principally stored in the liver and bone marrow, also stored in the kidneys and adrenals.\n\nProtein binding: Transcobalamins.\n\nMetabolism: Converted in tissues to active coenzymes, methylcobalamin and deoxyadenosylcobalamin; undergoes some enterohepatic recycling.\n\nBioavailability: Intranasal (Nascobal): 6.1% (relative to IM); Oral: Pernicious anemia: 1.2%.\n\nTime to peak, serum: IM, SUBQ: 30 minutes to 2 hours; Intranasal: 1.25 ± 1.9 hours.\n\nExcretion: Urine (50% to 98%, unchanged drug)."
