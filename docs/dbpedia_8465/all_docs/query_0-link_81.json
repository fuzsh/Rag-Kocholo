        "text": "During this last year, Technophage has been dedicated to the development of a new biologic product for COVID-19. The company has been working together with Medinfar Group in a joint effort to make available a new biologic that will help to tackle this devastating disease, specially in immunocompromised patients. The new TA-201 is included in Technophage’s product pipeline.\n\nA while ago, this project was featured in the Portuguese Journal ‘Expresso’.\n\n“Problems” is the word Miguel Garcia uses most often during an hour of conversation. “We’ve solved ten problems and another twenty appear.” “It takes resilience to face problems.” “It’s a long road full of problems.”"
