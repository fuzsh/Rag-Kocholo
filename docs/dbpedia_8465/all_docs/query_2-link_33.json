His work contributed to the validation of a stem cell therapy product, and pre-clinical work using these cells. He later continued his studies and obtained his doctorate degree from the University of Queensland. His PhD work laid the groundwork for the development of novel antibody-based immunotherapeutics for viral infections following transplantation. Dr Martins is currently a post-doctoral researcher at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR) where he continues to develop novel immunotherapies for the treatment of virus-related cancers.\n\nCURRENT APPOINTMENTS\n\nSince 2018: Research Officer, Tumour Immunology Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer\n\nSince 2020: ITAS TT tutor, Oodgeroo Unit, Queensland University of Technology\n\nPREVIOUS APPOINTMENTS\n\n2017 – 2018: Research Assistant and Research Officer, Bone Marrow Transplantation Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer\n\n2014 – 2017: PhD scholar, Bone Marrow Transplantation Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer\n\n2006 – 2014: Research Scientist and Laboratory Manager, ECBio S.A., The Medinfar Group, Portugal\n\nORCID NUMBER\n\n0000-0002-2360-403X\n\nRESEARCHER ID\n\nP-5735-2014\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\nTo view Google Scholar list of publications, click here\n\nCURRENT AREA OF RESEARCH\n\nDr Martins’s main research interest is cellular immunotherapy. His primary focus is to translate research towards the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of virus-associated cancers.\n\nRESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS\n\n2020: Co-authored a study demonstrating that cytomegalovirus – specific adoptive cell therapy can be safely used as an adjuvant therapy, and may improve the overall survival of glioblastoma patients (PMID: 32750039)\n\n2019: Identified that strain-specific serotherapy prevents cytomegalovirus reactivation after transplantation (PMID: 30655443).\n\n2016: Patented an optimised and defined method for isolation and preservation of precursor cells from human umbilical cord (WO2009044379A2)\n\n2014: Adapted a method to isolate, expand and cryopreserve a well-characterized population of human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs (PMID: 24438697)\n\nPROFESSIONAL MEMBERSHIPS\n\nAustralasian Society of Immunology (ASI)\n\nInternational Society for Cell and Gene Therapy (ISCT)\n\nPortuguese Society for Immunology (SPI)\n\nAWARDS RECOGNITION\n\n2019: UNSW Eureka prize for Scientific Research, Australian Museum\n\n2019: Prize for Cancer Research Excellence, Australian Cancer Research Foundation\n\n2016: Young Investigator Award, Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand\n\n2013: International Postgraduate scholarship, QIMR Berghofer\n\nEDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND"
