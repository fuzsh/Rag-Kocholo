        "text": "The place is fabulous, I think I was unlucky or went at the wrong time and those who are going to take macro photographs do not need good visibility.\n\nNature is like that. Of course, when we've been waiting a year for these holidays and things go this way, we're not satisfied. It's not the resort's fault.\n\nI have to come back another time\n\nGood morning\n\nEven without AC, there wasn't any problems with mosquitos or high temperature inside the room.\n\nFor the mosquitos, I used repellent every evening when arriving at the dining area.\n\nThat was not a problem for me nor for the other guests.\n\nI always carry with me the malaria tablets and take them as prescribed.\n\nAccording to other divers I have talked to and who visited this place, February and March are the best time in terms of visibility but marine life is not as abundant. The visibility increases from October through March.\n\n@ppina Thanks so much for your response! It is very helpful to us.\n\nWhat kind of mosquito repellent did you use (and worked there)? DEET? Picaridin? Lemon eucalyptus?"
