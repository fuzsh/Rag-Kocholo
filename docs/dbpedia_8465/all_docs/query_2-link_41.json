        "text": "Case\n\nLearning Experiences Design, Culture Design, Facilitation\n\nLEAP: Leadership Acceleration Program\n\nOne small step in knowledge, one giant leap to leadership.\n\nWe didn't meet yesterday, we just weren't lucky enough to work together yet\n\nSONAE Capital had been identifying the topic of leadership as one of its priority development areas for a number of years. In 2021, it felt it was time to accelerate the development of people-leaders in the different business units.\n\nWas it love at first sight? Not really. It was a relationship that, based on empathetic listening, clarity of requests and deliveries, commitment, proximity, has matured over time always in the sense of responsibility and autonomy that allow greater degrees of freedom of thought, decision and action.\n\nChallenge, Commitments and Program\n\nSONAE Capital challenged Way Beyond to design a program for the development of the organization's leading people, with a view to:\n\nDevelop cross-cutting leadership competencies in people with that kind of responsibility in the organization;\n\nAlign with the existing leadership model in the SONAE Group: Lead Better;\n\nCreate your own identity, despite the diversity and dispersion of your business;\n\nConsolidate a distinctive culture that aligns with the group's values and principles.\n\nIn the expectation of creating and consolidating an own identity that was aligned with a distinctive culture, taking into account the history and particular characteristics of the organization, namely the diversity and dispersion of its businesses, we contributed to the development of:\n\n200\n\npeople\n\n5\n\ncompanies\n\n4\n\ngeographies\n\nTo this end, we jointly designed the:\n\nPhase #1\n\nFrom Research to Knowledge\n\nBecause we do not give up knowing the reality, expectations, desires and needs of the people we are going to work with, we started by researching and listening to people leaders and people led (Phase #1) to build knowledge from information about:\n\n15 Individual Interviews\n\nLeaders from each of the business areas and 3 members of the Executive Board in order to access individual perspectives on the culture of the organization and their role as leaders.\n\n2 Focus Group\n\nThe 17 of 24 planned to provide participants with a space for reflection and conversation about the scope of this project.\n\n1 Climate Survey Analysis\n\nWe cross-checked the data from the climate survey with those obtained from the individual interviews and focus groups to find patterns, omissions and coincidences.\n\nPhase #2\n\nProgram co-design and co-construction\n\nWe knew what people thought about the leadership culture of the organization, how they saw themselves as leaders and what they would like the LEAP programme to be. We were therefore in a position to move forward to build the program. As we always prefer to do this in partnership with our clients, we invited a representative sample of the population to a workshop to co-design and co-construct the program.\n\nInspired by what they considered to be the worst leadership program in the world, this group reflected on the desired outcomes for the LEAP program. Having considered these outcomes, the design proceeded in a \"world café\" format to detail on themes and content, formats and methodologies, critical success factors and other aspects deemed relevant.\n\nAt the end of this 8h face-to-face session, we still did not have this mascot but we already had the material to shape it.\n\nPhase #3\n\nImplement and Live the Transformation\n\nOnce the topics to be worked on had been identified and the formats with the greatest predicted effectiveness and effect validated, and in order to better organize ourselves and share information to the minute with the SONAE Capital project management team, we used a tool that we are big fans of, SessionLab.\n\nConsidering the different geographies, we needed to add more partners to the program. We then invited our former and always partner, the European Coaching School to deliver the short and long sessions for non-Portuguese speaking participants.\n\nFor each theme, we decided together that there would be two types of sessions: the Short Leaps and Long Jumps.\n\nOnline sessions, lasting 1h30, to spark interest, provoke reflection and initiate/endow participants with a common language regarding leadership principles, with participants from all business units.\n\nIn order to ensure the greatest possible attendance, for each theme we held 2 sessions, at 2 different times. Because we had people whose official language was not Portuguese, in each theme one of the sessions had simultaneous translation, with the excellent help of Calliope Interpreters, and our alumna, friend and colleague Laurence Corréard.\n\nWe started with an Opening Session, of course, which included a masterclass on \"Leadership Myths\". Then there were 12 sessions, 2 for each of the following themes, between June and July 2022:\n\nLeading Through Culture\n\nEmotions: (Un)Blockers of Action and Relationships\n\nLeader as Coach\n\nConscious Communication\n\nExpectations and Commitments\n\nDifficult Conversations\n\nThe sessions on Emotions did not go as expected. Talking with our clients, because neither they nor we were satisfied, we decided to hold two new sessions on the topic called \"Emotions 2.0\", already in September.\n\nShort Leaps\n\nA setback? No, a new life!\n\nIn December 2022, due to strategic redefinitions at Sonae Capital, we were challenged to rethink the project and the training path, so that the groups of leaders could be grouped by each business unit. With the effort and dedication of the various \"people of people\" from the different companies, we maintained a mixed project team that coordinated the rest of the program.\n\nAs for us, we also had to adjust the way we were in this partnership, keeping our commitment to deliver our work with the best possible quality, knowing that the context was demanding and people were even busier than usual.\n\nWe have done everything to ensure that the Long Jumps will start in March 2023.\n\nWorkshops aimed at providing participants with specific skills and strategies to apply directly in their leadership.\n\nThey took place in a face-to-face format and varied in duration between 4h and 12h, organized by business unit/company.\n\nIn all, over 3 months - in Porto, Lisbon, Tróia, Barcelona and Madrid - 16 Long Jumps were held for a total of about 190 people, on three different themes:\n\nLeadership Principles\n\nConscious Communication and Principles of Effective Feedback\n\nLeading While Coaching\n\nLong Jumps\n\nTo conclude, we returned to a familiar format to tackle a new topic\n\nTo close the program, at the beginning of June 2023, we gathered again online. 200 people were listening and participating in a conversation facilitated by João Sevilhano, in which we had 2 invited specialists, Manuel Salavessa, child psychiatrist, and Inês Mega, psychotherapist. The topic was, if you haven't guessed, Mental Health.\n\nThis was one of the programs that has given us the most pleasure, enthusiasm and joy in recent times. From the construction of the proposal to the closing and debriefing conversations, namely because of the closeness and trust we felt in the relationship with the management team of this project, the dynamics of the work we created, the candor and capacity of both parties to adapt to changes, the adherence and curiosity of the participants, the feedback. And, at the same time, for the feelings of rigor and lightness, seriousness and humor, close accompaniment and freedom.\n\nMuch of this is the responsibility of Nuno Sousa (responsible for the transversal management of the project), Mariana Aguiar and Miguel Tolentino who have always tried to provide us with the best conditions to think and work. Thank you for your trust.\n\nWe hope that the future will bring new and good collaborations!\n\nWant to know more?\n\nPrevious\n\nPrevious\n\nLeading the Medinfar Culture\n\nNext\n\nNext\n\nLeadership @Kelly"
