The Medinfar Group's industrial vocation has been present since its inception in 1970.

In recent years, the group has substantially strengthened its industrial activities through a significant reinforcement of production investments, which are currently concentrated in the Condeixa-a-Nova plant.

The growth of our industrial business has followed this trend. Our volume of production has had a fourfold increase in the first decade of the 21st century. A significant part of this growth is based on the provision of contract manufacturing services, that is, companies that over the years have entrusted MEDINFAR Group with the manufacture and supply of their products.
