It is not lightly that I tell you: Nyasha is a visionary and an iconoclast. Here’s some words about the project from the man himself, but please don’t take his (or my) words for it. Check out the tracks. This is something else, and something wonderful. From NC:\n\nenid ze is a continuation and reimagining of the Southern African tradition of Zamrock—W.I.T.C.H. Keith Mlevhu, Wells Fargo—where global pop and rock come to cohere in specific existential experiences of living many worlds at once. Listen to the panting on the title track “Better is Gold” and remember Letta Mbulu. When you hear “Marechera” recall modernist African writer Dambudzo Marechera’s poem, Punkpoem:\n\nIn the song\n\nAre waterfruits;\n\nIn the plush and flow\n\nFirestars eternally fixed.\n\nGuitar strings lash\n\nMy back, draw blood –\n\nThe out of control voice\n\nSkids shrieking across\n\nTarmac audiences.\n\nWhen you hear “Shuwa” hear the word “sure” but also the waves on the beaches of Maputo, Mozambique. Or the beer gardens of downtown Harare. Also listen to how far home and how close it is, how unrest and rest lie together like a lion and lamb.\n\n“Better is Gold” is about the condition of seeking more than you see—not in the future but in the things that you find along the way. “Better” is better than gold.\n\nDownload my new track “Derniers Préparatifs” here:\n\nEight days ago I found an ancient Italian polysynth at a local pawn shop. Called the Crumar Orchestrator, it’s an odd combination of string synth, ‘electronic piano,’ and monosynth all in one rather heavy package. The sound is effortlessly evocative of circa 1980 Euro cinema, and this track came to me instantly. You can see pics of the Crumar, hear my original live performance of the piece, and even see the drumkit mic’ing for this track at my Instagram page.\n\nAs with the rest of my Camerro project, this track was recorded entirely on a four-track cassette recorder: in this case, a Tascam 134. Here’s how it went down:\n\nTrack 1: Ace Tone ‘Rhythm Ace’ drum machine w/heavy Yamaha E1010 16th note echo; Track 2: Crumar orchestrator (this is the bulk of what you’re hearing). Track 3: Bass guitar. Track 4: add elec guitar while submixing with tracks 1, 2, 3.\n\nAfter the bounce, I added live drumkit to track one (overwriting drum machine), and add two passes of Roland Alpha Juno synth + Hohner Pianet electric piano to tracks 2+3 (overwriting bass+ Crumar). The kit was recorded with two mics, submixed thru a basic mic preamp and heavily compressed to tape.\n\nSONG TO WELCOME THE SPRING /// the first track I’m releasing from my solo recording project CAMERRO.\n\n‘control-click’ on the player below to download the MP3.\n\nThis song is inspired by my trip last yr visiting ancient pagan churches in Estonia. Everything you hear is played live by me and the track was entirely recorded on a cassette 4-track. For me this music is as raw and personal as it gets. The 4-track cassette process requires that everything be performed carefully and with great intent as ‘fixes’ are not possible. For yall techy-types here’s how it went down:\n\nTascam 134 4-track cassette deck with Maxell XLII-S tape. Click to track three, elec gtr (finger picked rh+melody) to track one, drums to track two, bass to track four;\n\nSubmix gtr, drums, bass while playing congas all to track two (erasing click);\n\nadd electric organ on track two (overwriting drums), add sitar and cello (in sections) to track one (overwriting gtr), add percussion to track to 4 (overwriting bass). Two microphones were used: Bang&Olufsen ribbon for drums and perc, Neumann TLM170 for congas and cello, gtr bass sitar organ were direct. FX are Yamaha PROR3 reverb and Yamaha E1010 delay.\n\nTonight Thursday June 18 at 9PM: “Bully. Coward.Victim.” will air for the first time on HBO. Nathan Halpern and I scored this outstanding documentary for director Ivy Meeropol, our second collaboration following her award-winning 2015 doc “Indian Point.”\n\nCohn was an infamous and complicated figure, and Meeropol’s film paints a detailed and nuanced portrait. The incredible, horrible closeness that Meeropol has to Cohn gives her a unique vantage point from which to tell this story.\n\nThis was a wonderful project to work on; I got to create music in a variety of styles that I don’t often get a chance to play with in a film context.\n\nLearn more about and view the trailer at HBO dot com.\n\nThis month’s Preservation Sound Radio show has aired. This program is a mix of 1950s+60s ‘Academic’ and ‘new music’ combined with spiritual jazz, New Age, and ambient, assembled and broadcast from the original LPs.

The later ‘red paint’ iterations often have pinout data printed on the cases, but the earlier ‘metal-badge’ versions sometimes do not. Despite the wealth of vintage UTC transformer data already available online, I could not find this particular document on the internet so I have scanned it for y’all. This particular document has a March 1956 date code so i assume that it covers the line at-that-point.\n\nCNTRL-CLICK TO DOWNLOAD 4PP PDF:\n\nUnits covered include output transformers CG-2L6, 4L6, 15, 16, 19, 710; power transformers CG-422, 428, 429, 431; bias units CG-315, 316; low-level audio units CG-131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 1347, 140, 141, 233, 235, 333, 433; and power transformers CG33, CG120, CG122, CH124, CG125, CG126, CG300, CG301, CG302, CG303, CG34.\n\nI wanted to see how compact I could make a high-voltage, point-to-point wired Tweed Champ. Here’s the result. Leo Fender’s 5F1 circuit, but with a solid-state rectifier, built into a tiny vintage NOS Bud hammertone chassis. Front panel is gain (standby switch at zero), pilot lamp, input; rear panel is fuse, power switch, IEC and speaker jack. See my Instagram page for sound sample."
