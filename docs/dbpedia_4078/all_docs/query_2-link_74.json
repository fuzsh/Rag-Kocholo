        "text": "starting back up with ...\n\nmore Cramps!\n\nThe Cramps – Songs The Lord Taught Us\n\nIRS Rainbow Label\n\nThe Cramps - Songs The Lord Taught Us\n\nNuthin’ fancy here. Straight psychobilly rampage drenched in all the Sam Philips echo that the tape can hold, with Alex Chilton again manning the controls. Even a deranged dirge covers of Strychnine and Fever alongside the sick twisted originals. Stick out your can – I’m the Garbage Man! Next trip through the alphabet, we’ll get Psychedelic Jungle (great title) and A Date With Elvis. For now, on to …\n\nCream – Fresh Cream\n\nOriginal purple and gold Atco label\n\nCream (2) - Fresh Cream\n\nIt was shocking to hear the hard stereo separation of the instruments here. I’m scrolling back to see the last album that I listened to that was this old, recorded in 1966, that was in stereo. Aha! That’s the issue. We have A Love Supreme, but that wasn’t recorded that way and is a different animal. The only others that old (Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Eddie Cochran, Byrds, Beatles, Beach Boys) were all mono. Well, what a great band and what a great album. Leading off with the “hit” I Feel Free. Although he dropped it by the time he hit the US shores in the fall, Bowie was featuring I Feel Free as an extended set piece on the first Ziggy tour of the UK in the spring and summer of 1972. Make no mistake, Cream was Jack Bruce’s band. He wrote all the songs on Side 1 except for Sweet Wine (Side 2 is all covers except for Ginger’s Toad). He sang lead on all the songs (Eric helped on Four Until Late). He is front and center on the first two album covers. Rolling and Tumbling is a great blues workout here with everyone at peak form, even Jack’s harp. So we get I Feel Free, but no Spoonful on this version. There are US versions that go both ways, like the VJ Introducing the Beatles. And as for Toad, yeah we all always skip that one, and they politely put it as the last track so we could, but it’s really quite wonderful. Ginger Baker’s such a complex dude and drummer. I’m glad I’m listening to all my albums and not skipping a note.\n\nCream – Disraeli Gears\n\nOriginal purple and gold Atco label Monarch press\n\nCream (2) - Disraeli Gears\n\nIf ever an album cover announced its contents, it was Disraeli Gears. This Monarch pressing smokes, again with the hard separation of the instruments. Back with even better songs and new guitar effects Cream’s second album remains their peak. Everything works, except arguably Clapton’s shadow vocals on Sunshine of Your Love. I’m ok with them; they’re just so weak compared to Bruce’s. A little surface noise between tracks makes me say I’ll clean it when I’m done listening. This one is great and I haven’t listened to it all the way through in too long. Side One impeccable except for Blue Condition, which again is thoughtfully tacked on the end. Side Two not as strong, but perfectly great. Tales of Brave Ulysses remains my favorite Cream song, as it has been since the first time I heard it.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival – Creedence Clearwater Revival\n\nOriginal blue and silver label Fantasy with Susie Q cover blurb\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival - Creedence Clearwater Revival\n\nThree of the first four tracks are covers, but Fogerty makes this his own show. Sinister and swampy. Underrated guitar work that holds up with any of the San Francisco peers this side of Carlos, and there were plenty (Airplane, Dead, Big Brother, Moby Grape, Quicksilver, and more). The solos don’t noodle and meander. They drive it home. Even the eight plus minutes of Susie Q is over too soon. Dim Stars did a great cover of the closer Walk On The Water that’s just a slight notch below Ike & Tina’s Proud Mary and Gun Club’s Run Through The Jungle as great CCR covers.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival – Bayou Country\n\nOriginal blue and silver label Fantasy\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival - Bayou Country\n\nThose verdant sun-dappled covers. A perfect invitation to the high times inside. Opens with Born On The Bayou, the best song not on Chronicle. How in the world did they miss it? Only the Penniman rave-up is a cover this time. JC came back with more and stronger songs, and wouldn’t let up for a few years.\n\nWhat a day! The Cramps, Cream, and Creedence. Oh my.\n\nWe'll finish up the C's with CSNY, The Cult, and The Cure, before we head into the D's ...\n\nNext up CSNY\n\nCrosby Stills Nash & Young – Déjà vu\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young - Déjà Vu\n\nI love the opening track, Carry On, on headphones. Stills’s open tuned guitar drone in the left channel, then joined by the rumbling bass (is that also Stills?) and real rock band in the right, on one of his best songs, abetted by a liberal coda of Questions by the Buffalo Springfield, slightly more blatant than Clapton borrowing the tune for Let It Rain. The title track is one of Crosby’s best, Our House one of Graham’s strongest. Neil’s Helpless almost sounds weak on Side 1, which ends with a crushing take on Joni’s Woodstock. Side 2 isn’t quite as good, with Neil’s Country Girl revisiting some of the melodic themes of Broken Arrow.\n\nCrosby Stills Nash & Young – So Far\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Crosby-Stills-Nash-And-Young-So-Far/release/8049317\n\nIn shrink with title hype sticker\n\nLet’s get this out of the way – why in the world is Long Time Gone missing here? I don’t get it. Could we bump Find The Cost Of Freedom? Ok, that said, a solid collection of their otherwise best, notable mostly for the inclusion of the Ohio single. Thanks Joni for the cover art. We think Croz still isn’t over her. Well, hey, that’s an annoying tick at the end of Déjà Vu we’d never heard before. Can’t see anything. Guess we’ll try another cleaning. So frustrating when someone suggests it’s VG+ and it has more than a pop or tick (or two) per side. Beautiful voices they had. I’m going to watch that crazy video of CSNY with Tom Jones doing Long Time Gone now to get my fix.\n\nThe Cult – Love\n\nThe Cult - Love\n\nI found this in the bins at Amoeba Hollywood in NM shape for $15 recently. Bridging the worlds of goth and hair metal in 1985, think Lords of the New Church meets Guns And Roses. Yes, The Cult were that good, for this album at least. Blasting off with Nirvana (no, not them) straight into the jangling rumbling Pretty Vacant opening riffage of Big Neon Glitter, these ain’t love songs. The sound is a little thin, but we turn up the subwoofer and the bottom appears. Side 1 ends with my favorite, Rain. Side 2 continues the relentlessness, opening with a fuzzed out wah-ed out Stooges I Wanna Be Your Dog riff into Phoenix. Fire! I’m On Fire! The riffs don’t stop. Another great one to lead off Hollow Man. The acoustic guitar upstrokes on She Sells Sanctuary are a great touch. Black Angel tells it true – a long long long goodbye. What a great album. Takes me back to the mid-80s.\n\nThe Cure – Happily Ever After\n\nThe Cure - ...Happily Ever After\n\nIf you don’t know, this compilation houses both Seventeen Seconds and Faith, so a great way to get both of the “difficult” albums at once.\n\nWe’ll start with the Seventeen Seconds disc. The simple and stark guitar and piano instrumental A Reflection sets the mood. What the hell is that – a child crying? Then an echoed rubber band fade into … more familiar Cure territory, familiar from Three Imaginary Boys / Boys Don’t Cry with Play For Today. Secrets then mixes those two sounds – the skewered pop slightly slowed down with atmospherics. I haven’t listened to this one in years, put off by what I remembered as being too dark, slow, and inaccessible. It’s none of those. In Your House is up next and sounds great. Yeah, it’s dark and slow-ish, but great. Yeah, there it is, the Side 1 closer Three is just a three note dirge disintegrating into electronic drum heart attack to end the side. Side 2 also starts with a quick instrumental followed by a familiar sounding pop rock track, this time the great A Forest. Into the trees! At over six minutes, the longest and best thing on this, The Cure’s second album.\n\nUp next is Faith. More dirge-y to open with The Holy Hour and the more poppy Primary in the two-hole, just like on Seventeen Seconds. Then it all comes together on Other Voices, great vocals, great foreboding melody and atmospherics, so good. The Funeral Party leads off Side 2 and gives us a glimpse of what The Cure would explore much more fully on Disintegration a few years later, the lengthy slowed down two chord instrumental synth wash.\n\nThese discs do sound great, pressed on the “Secret Quiex” translucent vinyl that A&M used sporadically at the time.\n\nThe Cure – Pornography\n\nThe Cure - Pornography\n\nThis is my favorite Cure album by a pretty substantial margin. Phil Spector in hell. We open with drums burbling from the bottom of a well sliced with snake guitars – It doesn’t matter if we all die … waiting for the death blow. A whole new sound fully realized and executed. Pretty simply, every track here is great, with the possible exception of the closing title track which is merely very good. Great lyric fragments from a scream for help, tribal drums, sinister basslines, and forgotten rituals. Great stuff! Made me miss Joy Division a little less at the time.\n\nThe D's are up next, and that means Dylan, The Doors, Miles, and more treats. Looking forward to it!\n\nAnd I’m back listening to all my albums in alphabetical order. To remind our readers of our hero’s journey, we’re going alphabetical by artist. Chronological within artist. To avoid artist fatigue, I’m limiting myself to two albums per artist this time through; we’ll do the next two albums of the artist (chronologically) the next time through the alphabet. An album is an album whether it’s a single disc or multi-disc. We’re only playing the 33s for now. 45s later. All vinyl is at least VG+ unless otherwise noted. I’ve also included Discogs links for the albums so that you can check out which pressings I’m enjoying if you’re interested.\n\nSo where were we? Right, we just ended the Cs. So on with the Ds.\n\nThe Damned – Damned Damned Damned\n\nThe Damned - Damned Damned Damned\n\nI rank this great debut album by The Damned up there with the debuts by The Jam, The Sex Pistols, and The Clash, as a brilliant document of that fleeting first burst of British punk. The Damned were even the first British punk band to put their album out in early 1977 and it’s great and this Porky cut the only way to hear it. Brian James wrote nearly everything here and was also a mesmerizing force live when I saw him with The Lords of the New Church. Virtually every song is perfect, from the singles New Rose and Neat Neat Neat, to the sinister Fan Club, Feel The Pain, 1 of the 2, to the Stooges 1970 cover here retitled I Feel Alright. James’s great guitar work and Dave Vanian’s mostly dead-panned vocals up front in the mix with bass and especially drums fairly buried by Nick Lowe’s production, although the drums are propelled up front on the one minute Stab Your Back, the only song written by drummer Rat Scabies. A sadly overlooked classic, often written out of the history of British punk, and not even mentioned in Spin’s Alternative Record Guide.\n\nThe Dammed - Music For Pleasure\n\nThe Damned - Music For Pleasure\n\nRush released 9 months after the debut and barely produced by Pink Floyd’s Nick Mason (the band wanted Syd Barrett initially), Music For Pleasure pales badly in comparison to their iconic debut, despite some perfectly good songs like the opening pair of Problem Child and Don’t Cry Wolf. Side 2 is not very good. Brian James again wrote almost everything on this sophomore slump album and left the band promptly thereafter.\n\nMiles Davis - Kind of Blue\n\nMiles Davis - Kind Of Blue\n\nMuch like A Love Supreme, I’m not sure what is the point of my adding any thoughts about the music contained here. From the opening bars of So What, even on this pirate mono blue vinyl issue, I’m transported and next weekend I’ll pull out my MFSL 2x45 box and spin that with some other 45rpm vinyl. I do like this package, with its die cut cover and blue vinyl. The sound is veiled and a far cry from the best sounding versions of this title, but the music overcomes. OK, I’ve only listened to side 1. This looks better than it sounds. I know the MFSL sounds SO much better. Looking forward to spinning that this weekend.\n\nMiles Davis - Greatest Hits\n\nMiles Davis - Miles Davis' Greatest Hits\n\nThis is a strange one that I didn’t even know existed until a few years ago. Do you know this one? 1960s Columbia before In A Silent Way. Some studio. Some live. Some great choices. Some great ones missing, of course. But I’m going to sit back and listen to this sublime music instead of quibbling over the track listing. What a great track list! Beautiful music.\n\nDead Kennedys – Fresh Fruit For Rotting Vegetables\n\nDead Kennedys - Fresh Fruit For Rotting Vegetables\n\nFrom the provocative band name to the album title to the song titles (Kill The Poor, Drug Me, I Kill Children (with its opening line “God told me to skin you alive”), Ill In The Head, Holiday In Cambodia), you’d be excused if you weren’t expecting the intelligent thought-provoking lyrics and even the occasional borderline radio friendly melodies (Let’s Lynch The Landlord, Holiday In Cambodia), for me this album stands atop the California punk mountain, even more so than the great albums by The Germs, Fear, Circle Jerks, Black Flag, and others. The highlight is the truly frightening California Uber Alles. No this ain’t for the faint of heart, but it is for thinking people who like to rock hard. While it didn’t win a Grammy for best engineering, the sound on this UK pressing is clear and punchy, just what I want from this music.\n\nDeath Cab For Cutie – TransAtlanticism\n\nDeath Cab For Cutie - Transatlanticism\n\nOur resident forum Beatle fanatics will recognize that the band took their name from the Magical Mystery Tour song. This is where they broke “big.” I bought this on CD when it was released, but haven’t listened to it for a while since I’ve always considered that it required attentive listening. I picked up the vinyl based on the SHFtv recommendation as one of the better sounding vinyl releases of this millennium. It sounds great in case you were wondering. Big and expansive and immersive with a great epic guitar sound and a solid low end and drum sound. Side B ends with Tiny Vessels and Side C opens with the title track. Both are epic and are the highlights for me this time through. I never understand people who complain about having to turn an album over, or that the music is spread over four sides of vinyl. I love the ritual. Tactile.\n\nDeep Purple - Shades of Deep Purple\n\nDeep Purple - Shades Of Deep Purple\n\nThis is the Rod Evans led “Mach I” shade of purple and is a little unfocused and only sometimes recognizable as the band whose sound would culminate on their run from In Rock through Who Do We Think We Are. We lead off with a nice enough instrumental, And the Address, and then to the “hit” Hush, which is good. I hope to never hear the Partridge Family-like One More Rainy Day again. Yuck. The covers here are largely unnecessary, none more so that I’m So Glad, which Cream had definitively covered on their debut just a year or two previously. Side 2 has Mandrake Root, not dissimilar to what Mach II would dig into further, a rather subdued reading of Help!, more like Help?, Love Help Me which is like what Pink Floyd and other bands were grappling with in the wake of the Beatles exploding what was possible in the pop rock format for exploration, and another cover, this time Hey Joe, with a Spanish lilt and a Bolero coda. I don’t need to hear this again any time soon. It may well go into the “For Sale” pile.\n\nDeep Purple - Machine Head\n\nDeep Purple - Machine Head\n\nAh, the old WB Artisan greenie of Machine Head. How many times has this been played LOUD? A little crackly to open Highway Star which is overcome once the band joins in this ode to a car. Still a little more surface noise than I remember during the solo, so we’ll call this one VG although it looks clean. If I can hear surface noise during a song, it’s VG at best. Guess it’s been too long since I visited this old friend. Never Before sounds so good, a poppier melodic side that they didn’t explore often enough, I say. Side 2 is where the legend lives. Without Smoke on the Water, would we be discussing Deep Purple anymore than, say, Montrose (not Montreux). That we also get Space Trucking and its nearly as iconic riff is a bonus. Oh no, a skip in Smoke On The Water. Guess I need to replace this copy. What’s the forum census? Another Greenie? An original UK Purple Records? The new purple vinyl? The Japanese palm tree label?\n\n… up next is Derek is Eric ...\n\nDerek and the Dominoes – Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs\n\nOriginal Atco 1841 Broadway\n\nDerek And The Dominos* - Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs\n\nAfter listening to the extraordinary DVDA surround version of this, the one that places Eric and Duane in separate rear channels throughout most of the album, I thought I’d give this one a try on headphones. Despite its reputation as a muddy mess, this sounded great. Bobby Whitlock’s backing vocals the perfect foil to Clapton’s emerging confidence as a vocalist. Not so much when Bobby takes center stage on Keep On Growing or Thorn Tree In The Garden. Whitlock also got a solo or co-write credit on six of the album’s nine originals. There’s a pulsing quality to the toms that I hadn’t noticed before. And those guitars. God, those guitars. Just a great immersive listening experience. And Discogs has VG+ / VG+ copies of this original pressing starting at $18.99.\n\nDerringer – Derringer\n\nOriginal Blue Sky WLP\n\nDerringer (2) - Derringer\n\nI want to like Rick Derringer. A lot. I recently saw him do a nice little unplugged storyteller type show at a small club which was good fun. After leading the McCoys, he was a highly sought-after studio hired gun axe-slinger, playing on albums by Steely Dan, Alice Cooper, Todd Rundgren, his friends the Winter Brothers, and others. It was only natural that he might seek some solo success. He sure isn’t much of a singer or lyricist. His songs, even the best ones, too often seem simplistic or forced, and rarely really rock hard enough. Let Me In opens this album off well enough and is by far the best thing here. All the best songs here, and there aren’t many, sound better on Derringer Live. I wanted to like this one, but it goes into the For Sale pile. Oh, and for SHFtv sake, this album sounds just fine production wise and sonically, as do many of his studio albums.\n\nDerringer – Live\n\nOriginal Blue Sky WLP\n\nDerringer (2) - Live\n\nFinally, little Rick Derringer gets it right. Slogging through his albums up to this point to find one or two good songs per album had become a drag. So, like Kiss and Frampton and others had done so well in the mid-Seventies, for acts that had no real “hits” and couldn’t really justify a “Greatest Hits” album, put all your best songs out as a “Live” album. Mission accomplished. Everything you want is here, Let Me In, Teenage Love Affair, Uncomplicated, RNR Hoochie Coo, Still Alive And Well, and more. Apparently cobbled together from multiple concerts, and not every segue is clean, but this one rocks harder than any of his other records. Cool cover shot with his BC Rich too.\n\nDevo – Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!\n\nOriginal WB JW press\n\nDevo - Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!\n\nLike many of you, I was introduced to Devo on their groundbreaking performance on Saturday Night Live in 1978, the very next week after the Rolling Stones had taken over Saturday Night Live to promote their then-new Some Girls album. Devo’s sacrilegious deconstruction of Satisfaction was jarring and exhilarating and still is. Side 1 here is pretty near perfect. Mongoloid is the highlight. In 1978, most of the first wave of punks (except the Ramones) were moving on from the initial three chord fury and Devo was the first I remember featuring synthesizers so prominently, helping usher in that next catch-all New Wave.\n\nDire Straits – Dire Straits (S/T)\n\nOriginal cream WB label Winchester press\n\nDire Straits - Dire Straits\n\nI’ll start off this one with a quote from the Better Records webpage about “Becoming An Expert Listener.” Michael Port tells us that in order to become knowledgeable about listening to music, an “audiophile” as it were, one must, at a minimum, devote “ten years of hard work. This means full time -- not weekends, not a few hours after work to relax, but full time: forty, fifty, sixty hours a week, for years and years.” I’ll let that be the reason that, although I can tell the difference in sound quality improved by a GK Every Picture Tells A Story or a debut B-52’s with the promo yellow custom label or a Monarch Dist. By Atco Sticky Fingers or a UK TimTom London Calling, I cannot determine why this Dire Straits album is held in such high esteem by so many on this forum. And I’ve tried. I’ve listened multiple times. I will say the same about my Monarch Crime of the Century and my AB Aja. I just don’t get it. What I’ve concluded is that unless the music speaks to me, I’m not going to be impressed by what I’m hearing. So while those three albums are all just fine, I would have never purchased any of them if I hadn’t been influenced by this forum to listen to great sounding records. Sultans of Swing sounds great to me, and is by far my favorite thing on this album, but I don’t hear anything else here otherwise revelatory in performance or sound. If you love this album, then that is great and fantastic and you likely don’t love everything I love either. I do not plan on buying any more albums just because they “sound great” if I don’t also love the music – hey that means you Tea for the Tillerman or Ambrosia or 10cc. And hey, if you can edify me, I’d love to learn more about what I’m missing here.\n\nDire Straits – Making Movies\n\nDire Straits - Making Movies\n\nBy far my favorite Dire Straits album, and I’ve picked up several of them due to this forum’s love of Dire Straits: The Self-titled Debut, Love Over Gold, and Alchemy in addition to this one. For me, I enjoy this one so much more than all the others combined.\n\nWhen we last left off, our hero had worked through the beginning of the D’s on his way to The Doors and Dylan. As a reminder to our readers, we are going alphabetically by artist, chronologically within artist, limited to two albums per artist to avoid burn out, and skipping those playing at 45rpm (for now). We’ve also included Discogs links so you can check out which pressing we’re listening to. On our journey, we find this gem, a great way to start off today’s listening.\n\nDirty Looks – Dirty Looks (Self-Titled)\n\nOriginal Stiff Records\n\nDirty Looks - Dirty Looks\n\nCriminally overlooked pure power punk circa 1980. The highlights here were featured on one of the great cassettes ever, the legendary Entertainment! cassette alongside The Police, The Jam, other like-minded turn of the decade music. For a moment, singer Marco Sin and the other Dirty Looks were featured in the British music press NME, Trouser Press, and rightly so. This, their debut on Stiff Records, rocks plenty hard with a subtle quirk, kind of like how I wish Marshall Crenshaw or Squeeze would rock. The highlights are Take A Life and 12:00 High, and both hold up perfectly well today. “Don’t you know rock n roll is still the best drug?”\n\nThe Doors – The Doors (Self-Titled)\n\nThe Doors - The Doors\n\nThis sounds so d@mn good. One of those many albums that I enjoy exponentially more when played LOUD. Side One ends with the great seven-minute Light My Fire. Side Two bursting open with some crawling king snake Back Door Man grunts. Take it easy baby take it as it comes the unlikely pairing of the Transcendental Meditation slogan with hard rocking beats. Which leads us to the oedipal climax lost in a Roman wilderness of pain. The West is the best.\n\nThe Doors – Strange Days\n\nThe Doors - Strange Days\n\nI love these Elektra gold label Doors albums. Strange Days will always be the inextricable companion to the debut in my mind, with many of the songs here written previously. Of course, on Strange Days, they were able to explore the studio more, with an 8-track and even a Moog. Once again, Robby writes a big hit single, the ode to second helpings Love Me Two Times. The highlights for me are the side closers, Moonlight Drive and When The Music’s Over, although the pair of Strange are most excellent as well. And though I don’t need to hear Horse Latitudes again, it does give the correct flavor to understand that The Doors were never only bubblegum pop singles hitmakers nor pretentious bombastic experimentalists. Much like U2, The Doors were all of these things, and more, and wanted to explore what more they could become from the base of their little shamen fronted four man tribe.\n\nThe Dream Syndicate – The Days of Wine and Roses\n\n2019 Record Store Day Reissue\n\nThe Dream Syndicate - The Days Of Wine And Roses\n\nFrom the first drum crack and shiny shiny Velvety guitar tearing through the opening track, I knew this music was for me and became an important part of the soundtrack of my 1982-83. Not a bad track here, mostly in the Velvet Underground style, with Then She Remembers veering partially into Raw Power territory, Until Lately with pre-hipster shuffle, and When You Smile coolly channeling Heroin. Too Little Too Late would not have been out of place on another of 1982’s greatest albums, Shoot Out The Lights (thanks Kendra). Also of note is the great Halloween, written by the band’s original bassist / guitarist, Karl Precoda. With the band name and album title both evoking the Velvet Underground, paired with the sound in the grooves, a VU renaissance was in the air - Polygram finally getting the old VU catalog back in print along with the “VU” album the next year. I had this initially on cassette, then CD, and was thrilled to pick up the expanded vinyl version at RSD last year. It sounds great and the addition of the EP and single are delicious icing, just like on the 2001 Rhino CD reissue. Listening to Side B for the second time in a row now and lost in Too Little Too Late. Quite lovely.\n\nBob Dylan – The Freewheelin’\n\nBob Dylan - The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\n\nOriginal Columbia Mono First Release\n\nThe vinyl has some pops, so we’ll call it VG. I got this in a big batch of Dylan mono years and years ago and can’t say that I’ve ever listened to it all the way through. I’ll just reiterate how much I love going through all of this vinyl! Of course I know nearly all the songs well, but to hear this, on vinyl, in mono, all the way through, with the pops, with just Dylan’s commanding voice, immediately identifiable guitar and harmonica, and amazing lyrics and songs, transports me like I’m listening to an old bluesman. The audacity to open with Blowin’ In The Wind. Assuredly laying down Masters Of War and A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall, among others, before we even get to side two. Of course the cover, Bob commanding the center of the Greenwich Village street with Suzy holding on tight, gives you a hint that he was the legendary man all the women want and all the men want to be. Side two starts off with my favorite early Dylan, Don’t Think Twice, and keeps going with some lesser-heard songs every bit as good as the first side. A stone classic.\n\nBob Dylan – The Times They Are A-Changin’\n\nBob Dylan - The Times They Are A-Changin'\n\nOriginal Columbia 1F Mono First Release with insert\n\nLike Freewheelin’, this album was part of that mono lot, and an album that I haven’t listened to many times, and not for years and years. The lyrics to With God On Our Side still shock and One Too Many Mornings sounds so foreign after hearing the 1966 live versions so many more times. It used to go like that; now it goes like this. After being really moved by Freewheelin’, The Times suffers slightly in comparison for me, although The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll delivers as it did when I saw him perform it live in 1988. Now’s the time for your tears.\n\nThe Eagles – Hotel California\n\nEagles - Hotel California\n\nSterling x2, LH side 1 only, with credits inner sleeve and poster\n\nPerhaps the album in that I’ve listened to in this project so far that the most SHFtv members own, currently the 16th best selling album of all-time, right ahead of Sergeant Pepper’s. Everyone over 30 has heard the title track and it remains a high-water mark for 70s rock music, the layered guitars singing throughout and betrayed by the setting in of hopelessness in the lyric. The addition of Joe Walsh to the fold obviously got everyone’s attention and forced the other Eagles to step up their games. Following the epic title track, Glen puts up his strongest track, New Kid In Town featuring Walsh on keyboards for what would be a highlight on many other Eagles albums, but seems like an afterthought here, slotted between Hotel California and Life In The Fast Lane. The Walsh effect is most pronounced on Life In The Fast Lane, the hard riff-rocking ode to the debauchery the boys were tempting. Quick note on Henley’s often overlooked drumming – listen to the restraint on Life In The Fast Lane. Many drummers may have taken the opportunity to attack an out-of-character hard rocker like this with abandon. Henley instead keeps it tight and tasty, with a funky kick drum emphasis. The well-sequenced Side One ends with the soulful symphonic Wasted Time, which then gets its brief reprise to start Side Two. Don Felder wrote the tough rocker Victim of Love that follows and was “promised” the lead vocal which of course the “other” Don ended up singing. Also writing the title track, Felder really shone on this album. Joe Walsh’s vocal showcase is up next and is unfortunately the low point on the album. The biggest surprise listening to this classic is how great the melody of Randy Meisner’s last vocal turn for the Eagles, Try and Love Again, is. And it is a great Burritos-flavored tune. A great album by any measure, and has always paired with Rumours in my mind, the twin 1976 L.A. cocaine masterpieces.\n\nThe E’s. As a reminder to our readers, we are going alphabetically by artist, chronologically within artist, limited to two albums per artist to avoid burn out, and skipping those playing at 45rpm (for now). We’ve also included Discogs links so you can check out which pressing we’re listening to so you can play along at home.\n\nEcho and the Bunnymen – Crocodiles\n\nEcho And The Bunnymen* - Crocodiles\n\nThe US version tops the UK version by adding the great Do It Clean and the Julian Cope collaboration Read It In Books. The opening ominous fade in of Going Up, the driving Do It Clean with its Stepping Stone homage, the Gang of Four jangle of Stars Are Stars, what a way to start. 1980 was one of my favorite years of music with Scary Monsters, Zenyatta Mondatta, Pretenders, Crocodiles, Too Much Pressure, Sinsemilla, Closer, Remain In Light, Sound Affects, End Of The Century, Get Happy, Psychedelic Furs, Joan Jett, The River, Double Fantasy, Boy, Sandinista, Dirty Looks, More Specials, and so many more. And hey, this album has Rescue and Villiers Terrace too. One of my happiest surprises going to concerts was how great and muscular and hard-rocking Echo and the Bunnymen were live when I finally was able to see them in concert in 1988.\n\nEcho and the Bunnymen – The Stars, The Ocean, & The Moon\n\nEcho & The Bunnymen - The Stars, The Oceans & The Moon\n\n2LP picture discs signed by Will and Mac!\n\nReimagined versions of their classics, this was a lengthy pre-order that finally arrived in a beautiful package, although all four sides of vinyl have the identical album cover image, which is a little disappointing. The music also unfortunately lacks most of the magic of the original versions. More than anything it makes me want to listen to my digital version of Songs To Learn and Sing. Pleasant background music, nothing more, sadly.\n\nElectric Light Orchestra – Eldorado\n\nElectric Light Orchestra - Eldorado A Symphony By The Electric Light Orchestra\n\nLegacy 2016 reissue\n\nI snagged this as part of the insane Barnes & Noble 50% off sale between Christmas and New Year’s. Read about THAT here: Barnes & Noble in-store Bl. Fri. music deals? (my damage is listed on page 4). Anyway, I’d never owned this title on vinyl. I had the 2001 remaster digitally and hadn’t paid it enough attention. Like I had for so many artists, I had long ago created my own iTunes playlists for ELO and had neglected much of the rest of their catalog. So what a pleasant surprise was Eldorado, with great song after great song and no duds to be found. I’m no fan of the usually too-polite, too-tame modern vinyl reissues, but this Sony Legacy reissue (on the Epic label?!) sounds very good.\n\nElectric Light Orchestra – Ole ELO\n\nElectric Light Orchestra - Olé ELO\n\nTan United Artists label\n\nI’m often confused how ELO ended up on the non-rock label United Artists, with really only Traffic on their roster of rock bands I enjoy. Mostly a soundtracks label in my mind. I think that UA may have just distributed ELO’s Jet label like they did with The Grateful Dead label. Some of you may know more. But this release, featuring their greatest hits prior to A New World Record and their big breakthrough Number One album Out of the Blue, is a joy from start to finish. So, you’re releasing your greatest hits album, and you take up half of side one with the 11 minute non-hit Kuiama? Puzzling for sure. But to have 10538 Overture and the relentless rush of Side Two on one album is bliss. I just listened to Side Two again. Monumental towering stuff there. Showdown, Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, Can’t Get It Out Of My Head, Boy Blue, Evil Woman, and Strange Magic. Try to top that for 1973-75 smart pop magic. Maybe just a half a notch below what Elton and Bowie were conjuring. You're sailing softly through the sun, in a broken stone age dawn. These UA pressings are notoriously noisy, and this one suffers from the stray invisible pop and click.\n\nThe Electric Prunes – The Electric Prunes (s/t debut)\n\nThe Electric Prunes - The Electric Prunes\n\nReprise tri-color label\n\nOn this first album, the band mostly performed the songs written by Annette Tucker, who co-wrote with Nancie Mantz and Jill Jones, including the druggy nuggets I Had Too Much To Dream (Last Night) and Get Me To The World On Time. After the near-perfect psychedelic nugget I Had Too Much To Dream, quality falls off fast. I was hoping for an album of similar music, but instead got embarrassing stuff like About A Quarter To Nine and The King Is In The Counting House. Rarely a nugget like the Standells-like Try Me On For Size will rear its head.\n\nEno – Here Come The Warm Jets\n\nEno* - Here Come The Warm Jets\n\nBlue Island night and day label\n\nOoooh they’re weird and they’re wonderful, oh they’re so spaced out. Released at the beginning of 1974, Elton was probably singing about Bowie, but this beautiful freak of an album was much weirder and every bit as wonderful. Credited only as “Eno,” the album hit #26 on the UK album charts (charting for only two weeks) and only #151 on the U.S. Billboard charts, but showed the way to more experimental pop twists. Ultimately, it is his most song-focused album with actual melodies and pop tendencies underlying the chaos in amazing stretches of Cindy Tells Me, Baby’s On Fire, and the lovely On Some Faraway Beach. Oh yes, he’d get weirder, but never more wonderful than on this, his debut.\n\nEno – Taking Tiger Mountain By Strategy\n\nEno* - Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)\n\nBlue Island night and day label\n\nEno’s second album of 1974 and the introduction of Oblique Strategies. The highlights are each side’s opening tracks, Burning Airlines Give You So Much More and the incessant assault of Third Uncle, later beautifully covered by Bauhaus, plus the infectious The True Wheel. We are the 801. Ding Ding. Looking for a certain ratio. Uh oh, nothing there this time. We saw the lovers, the Modern Lovers. The punks were listening. And you should too. If you like this, and haven't heard it, check out 801 Live (801 - 801 Live ).\n\nCruising right along into the F’s. As a reminder to our readers, we are going alphabetically by artist, chronologically within artist, limited to two albums per artist to avoid burn out, and skipping those playing at 45rpm (for now). We’ve also included Discogs links so you can check out which pressing we’re listening to so you can play along at home.\n\nMarianne Faithful - Broken English\n\nMarianne Faithfull - Broken English\n\nBlue night and day Island label with Promo Stamp and Sticker. Sterling x2. Other Island albums inner sleeve.\n\nMarianne was ravaged in every possible way by the end of the seventies and unrecognizable as the chanteuse of the mid-sixties, and in many ways left for dead after bouts of addiction and even years of homelessness. We get started here with the Eurodisco propulsed title track and Marianne’s damaged voice and soul front and center. Witches’ Song is up next with slightly calmer propulsion and vocals, almost lovely and soothing, until the lyrics come to the fore and we hear “danger is great joy” and other disturbances through the sing-song melody. Seems strange to be listening to this album in the daylight. Without a scotch. Her thumping version of Working Class Hero is brave and works wonderfully in the context of the album. The funky angular near-reggae anger of Why D’Ya Do It is a fitting closer. Please avoid watching her contemporary SNL performance. Even worse than her bizarre I Got You Babe duet with Bowie from the 1980 Floor Show, donning a backless habit. Remember back to 1979 as the year of The Wall, London Calling, Unknown Pleasures, Fear Of Music, Candy-O, Lodger, Metal Box, Tusk, and Eat To The Beat, and this fits in nicely.\n\nBryan Ferry – The Bride Stripped Bare\n\nBryan Ferry - The Bride Stripped Bare\n\nUK Polydor custom labels. Sadly missing the custom inner sleeve.\n\nFerry’s solo triumph (his fifth solo album!) released during Roxy Music’s hiatus between Siren and Manifesto is mostly Ferry originals with some tasty covers thrown in for good measure. Why this one doesn’t get the love some of his other solo albums do remains a mystery to me. He is in superlative voice with great material. The covers are so well-chosen. The wait for it orgasmic Hold On I’m Coming is sinister and slinky, and Take Me To The River is the natural bridge between Al and David. The drumless traditional Carrickfergus is beautiful and wouldn’t be out of place on a Richard Thompson album. My only complaint of That’s How Strong My Love Is is I want even more aggressive sax. If not as consistently great as Siren, it’s still leagues ahead of Manifesto.\n\nThe Fixx – Reach The Beach\n\nThe Fixx - Reach The Beach\n\nWith the weird MCA gold stamp front and center on the cover. Still in shrink.\n\nOn the heels of their inconsistent but sometimes very good debut album Shuttered Room, The Fixx took over the airwaves, radio and MTV, in the spring and summer of 1983 with the funky One Thing Leads To Another, the first track here. Bassist Alfie Agies was fired during the recording sessions and added the funk to that single and a couple other songs here. The album and single both went top 10 in the US and sold millions. Great sound on this album. A number of the tracks have a cinematic sweep like the title track, although not everything here works, like Changing and Outside, and Side Two in general isn’t as strong as Side One. There was a great KBFH radio broadcast of The Fixx live right before the album was broadcast in tandem with a Psychedelic Furs show. It was from Rosyln and was released in the File Under series and is a great way to hear the band.\n\nQuarantine version ...\n\nFleetwood Mac – Then Play On\n\nFleetwood Mac - Then Play On\n\nTan Reprise labels with Oh Well\n\nA few pops are audible. Anytime I hear more than 2 pops per side, that means it’s VG and not VG+. VG is still very good, but has some audible defects. It’s very frustrating to buy an album advertised as EX or VG++ or VG+ that has audible defects. Just be honest with your grading. Anyway, what a treasure trove of an album this is. The best Peter Green era album leads off with then new member Danny Kirwin’s Coming Your Way, highlighted by Mick Fleetwood’s unique and instantly identifiable drumming. Kirwin wrote a couple more here also, leading off both sides, plus Like Crying. The second track is the beautiful Closing My Eyes before we finally get to some blues with Show-Biz Blues. Side 1 closes with the great Oh Well. I was first introduced to Oh Well by The Rockets, who were some of Mitch Ryder’s Detroit Wheels. The song has it all: great imaginative lyrics, great imaginative call and response song structure, incredible performance, if a little drawn out in its album version instrumental coda. Oh Well replaced When You Say and My Dream (two more Kirwin compositions) on this quick reissue to capitalize on the success of the single. Rattlesnake Shake is another tough blues highlight and I would be ok with maybe only a couple minutes of the Madge blues jams. If you want to hear what the Peter Green Fleetwood Mac was all about in one song, check out the album finale, Before The Beginning, where each band member’s sound is featured.\n\nSo back to my grading rant, the rest of the album plays beautifully, but those 4 or 5 pops on the first track and maybe 1 or 2 more pops the rest of the album puts the grading firmly in VG territory. There’s no shame in a VG record, and many VG albums are quite acceptable and enjoyable, as this one is. VG means very good. Not it’s a mess. Or it’s pretty noisy. VG means very good. Rant over.\n\nFleetwood Mac – Greatest Hits\n\nFleetwood Mac - Fleetwood Mac Greatest Hits\n\nThe UK gatefold collection, not the later Buckingham – Nicks focused collection of the same name.\n\nAn early cross-label (Kinney / Warner / Reprise, Immediate, Blue Horizon) licensing coup put all these amazing 1968-1972 tracks on one album. Leading off with The (Peter) Green Manalishi, and also including Oh Well, Black Magic Woman, Albatross, Man of The World, Love That Burns, and more, this is the perfect introduction to the Peter Green era of Fleetwood Mac. Really great sound quality too. The highlight of today’s listening.\n\nFlying Burrito Brothers – The Gilded Palace Of Sin\n\nThe Flying Burrito Bros - The Gilded Palace Of Sin\n\nA&M 1976 Pressing RE-1\n\nDead quiet perfect NM pressing. Wild shaking acoustic guitars, exotic (to me at the time) Sneaky pedal steel in the right channel, and vocals in the left channel then in both. Great opener she’s a devil in disguise. Nudie Cohn set em up with pot covered suits. The album never has sold a lot, but the right people heard it. I don’t have much country, but this one holds a special place in my collection and I listen to it a lot. The sublime non-Hillman / Parsons Hot Burrito #1 is my favorite. You may be sweet and nice but that won’t keep you warm at night. Once upon a time you let me feel you deep inside. I’m your toy. I’m your old boy. But I don’t want no one but you to love me. Gram slays.\n\nPeter Frampton – Frampton Comes Alive\n\nPeter Frampton - Frampton Comes Alive!\n\nPicture disc numbered 10000/10000\n\nIs that Peter F-ing Frampton?! Single disc compilation of the surprise runaway hit of the summer of ’76, sporting less than perfect sound quality, being a mid-seventies picture disc and all, but surprisingly listenable. The trio of US Top 15 hits Show Me The Way, Baby I Love Your Way, and Do You Feel Like We Do still hold up surprisingly well. Bob Mayo on the keyboards Bob Mayo!\n\nAretha Franklin – I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You\n\nAretha Franklin - I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You\n\nOriginal Atlantic green / blue label in shrink\n\nThe Queen’s tenth (10th!!!) studio album, but first on Atlantic broke her huge. What a rush of essential soul: R-E-S-P-E-C-T, I Never Loved A Man, Baby Baby Baby, Dr. Feelgood, Do Right Woman, Save Me, and so much more.\n\nAretha Franklin – Lady Soul\n\nAretha Franklin - Lady Soul\n\nOriginal Atlantic green / blue label in shrink\n\nLeading off with Chain Chain Chain Chain of Fools and also including You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman (Woman!) and Since You’ve Been Gone. A hidden gem is Good To Me As I Am To You, featuring Eric Clapton sitting in during his tour of the Atlantic studios, as featured prominently in the Life In 12 Bars 2019 documentary. The extended Chain of Fools featured on the Quad Best Of album and later included as a bonus track on the reissued CD is every bit as great as the edited single version.\n\nFunkadelic – Maggot Brain\n\nFunkadelic - Maggot Brain\n\nReissue\n\nNo use talkin’ ‘bout anything else here except for Eddie Hazel’s ten minute epochal title track damaged face melting guitar orgasm that builds to unbearable exaltation and then keeps building more. Turn your friends on to this one if they’ve never heard it. It remains among a handful of the greatest electric guitar events in recorded history. That’s not opinion or legend. That’s fact.\n\nPeter Gabriel – So\n\nPeter Gabriel - So\n\nIn shrink with hype sticker. Secret Quiex translucent Artisan Specialty press\n\nLeading off with the epic Red Rain, which is a brilliant bridge from the music Gabriel had offered on his first four self-titled albums to some of the more pop influenced sounds on this breakthrough to stardom of an album. And yeah, there’s sssssome ssssssibilance present already on this first track on the ssssseeing no rain. Listening to the next Peter Gabriel album US, my friend Scott and I were sitting slack-jawed in awe of the artistry in every detail. Sarcastically Scott said, he really doesn’t bring much to the table does he? Bizarrely up next is the faux soul of Sledgehammer, which while pleasant enough, is one of the least interesting things here and one I’ll always pair in my mind with Little Stevie Winwood’s Higher Love, Brit art vets breaking big with soul lite in ’86. Side one continues to devastate with the beautiful and heartbreaking Don’t Give Up, fleetingly featuring Kate Bush and That Voice Again. Side two is dominated with In Your Eyes, one of his best and most beloved songs, inexplicably left off the Shaking The Tree comp and famously hoisted by John Cusack. We also get the lovely Mercy Street, the churning funk work-out Big Time, and ends with a relative whimper, the pensive We Do What We’re told. One truth. One dream. So complete was Gabriel’s personal devastation by the success this album and his simultaneous divorce, he would release only the instrumental soundtrack Passion during the next six years.\n\nAnd we’re back listening to all my albums in alphabetical order. To remind our readers of our hero’s journey, we’re going alphabetical by artist. Chronological within artist. To avoid artist fatigue, I’m limiting myself to two albums per artist this time through; we’ll do the next two albums of the artist (chronologically) the next time through the alphabet. An album is an album whether it’s a single disc or multi-disc. But it’s vinyl only. We’re only playing the 33s for now. 45s later. All vinyl is at least VG+ unless otherwise noted. I’ve also included Discogs links for the albums so that you can play along at home and check out which pressings I’m enjoying if you’re interested.\n\nBack at it with the Gs.\n\nGame Theory – Lolita Nation\n\nGame Theory – Lolita Nation (1987, Vinyl)\n\nRecommended by a friend and picked up in a used bin in great shape still in the Enigma inner sleeves. Game Theory is mostly Scott Miller and this California band shares a jangly sheen with similarities to R.E.M. and their Paisley Underground brethren. Fans of R.E.M. can’t help but notice the title of the mostly instrumental lead-off track, “Kenneth – What’s the Frequency,” if not many of the song structures not dissimilar to what R.E.M. was doing in 1987. Of course, not everything is R.E.M.-y, with many slower dreamy pop falsetto tunes floating through sometimes discordant basic guitar sounds, that don’t always quite connect with its obvious Big Star aspirations. Throughout the two discs and 27 (!) tracks, there is some great stuff and plenty to digest in a single sitting. Just tune in with an open mind, without expecting R.E.M. or Big Star. I hadn’t the patience for this one before and it’s a great rewarding listen. By the time Side 1 gets into gear with the pop perfection of “We Love You Carol and Alison” and the lengthier and tougher “The Waist and the Knees,” you can’t help but wonder why Lolita Nation isn’t a better-known touchstone of 1980s indie pop rock. “Look Away” and “Mammoth Gardens” are nice change-ups, written by and featuring Donnette Thayer on vocals, and are near Go-Go’s straight pop rock. Perhaps the best track is “Chardonnay,” buried near the end of Side 4.\n\nGang of Four – Entertainment\n\nGang Of Four – Entertainment! (1980, Vinyl)\n\nWhen I first heard Entertainment in 1980, I didn’t have any context for it. The closest I knew was the more experimental moments of Candy-O. There still isn’t anything quite like Entertainment, rightly regarded as one of the truly great original pieces of art of the turn of the decade from the 1970s to the 1980s. I’m pretty sure this shared a similar release schedule with London Calling – UK in late 1979 and US in early 1980. I love this album quite a lot and love the opportunity to sit down, play it loud and all the way through. There is no weak track here, only classics. All killer no filler. That first listen is permanently etched, holding the provoking cover and lyric inner sleeve, trying to grasp the rhythm structures and competing melody lines. Forty years later and this is still challenging and lovely. All you need to know is in the lead-off track Ether. The jagged guitar slashing through the popping bass and drums with competing lyrics (shown in parentheses on the lyric sleeve). Then the rush of Natural’s Not In It and Damaged Goods, a pair of perfect post-punk rock for contortion dancing. The closest this comes to conventional pop is the brilliant I Found That Essence Rare, one of a handful of the very best songs of the turn of the 70s / 80s, which leads off Side 2. The ultimate track is 5:45. If you’re down with that one, you’re a friend of mine.\n\nGang of Four – Gang of Four\n\nGang Of Four - Gang Of Four (1980, Jacksonville pressing, Vinyl) | Discogs\n\nWhat a treat this one is. The “Yellow EP,” a four track EP hot on the heels of Entertainment! with two new tracks and two pre-Entertainment tracks, all of which share a consistent sound, vibe and general badassery with the album. So pleased that this is 33 and not 45 so I could include it in this pass, but that also means that the great Songs of the Free will need to wait. I’d rate Outside the Trains Don’t Run On Time as the best and He’d Send in the Army as the fourth best and the only track not quite up to the standard of all the other Gang of Four spinning today.\n\nJerry Garcia – Garcia\n\nJerry Garcia - Garcia (1972, Vinyl) | Discogs\n\nI’m not a certified Dead-Head, but like some of their stuff just fine, American Beauty / Reality and Workingman’s Dead chief among them. This album came recommended by someone I trust and it sounds like it could be a proud companion to those other two albums. This Artisan greenie sounds really fine and has the 12x6 sticker over the offending half of the album cover. I think Jerry played most of the instruments here – a true solo album. The songs are uniformly good and if you like the early 70s Dead albums, this 1972 release fits right in and includes Dead favorites Sugaree, The Deal, To Lay Me Down, and The Wheel as well as Loser, which some of you may know from Cracker’s cover on Kerosene Hat.\n\nMarvin Gaye – What’s Going On\n\nMarvin Gaye - What's Going On (1971, Indianapolis Press, Vinyl) | Discogs\n\nOriginal Tamla press\n\nI know this album gets lavish praise and is often cited as one of the very best albums of all time. I like it just fine, but I don’t rank it among the best albums ever. Of course Marvin’s Gaye’s vocals are flawless and the song cycle was influential, now 50 years ago. I find myself more drawn to the rhythm section, sometimes buried under the strings and backing vocals. Yes, that’s James Jamerson on bass on most of the album.\n\nMarvin Gaye – What’s Going On\n\nMarvin Gaye - What's Going On (1987, Vinyl) | Discogs\n\n1987 Motown Classic Vinyl Reissue\n\nIt’s shootout time! On recommendation from the SHFtv, I picked up this reissue and it is wonderful and sounds unquestionably better than my Tamla original, above. It’s more detailed and everything that I like about the album, the vocals, the bass, and the percussion, really shine on this pressing. This one seems to be getting harder to find, but I highly recommend it if you like this album.\n\nMarvin Gaye – Let’s Get It On\n\nMarvin Gaye - Let's Get It On (1973, Gatefold, Vinyl) | Discogs\n\nThe opening title tracks bursts out of the speakers. Drums, guitars, bass, great vocals, and other little flourishes, like the sax. This sounds surprisingly great. Is this album known for its great sound? Hot stamper? I don’t know, but it sounds great. And I’m enjoying it even more than its more famous predecessor listed above. I know many who dismiss this whole album as make out mood music, but it stands on its own as great 70s soul. A lovely listen without any of the weight or expectations of What’s Going On.\n\nThe J. Geils Band – Bloodshot\n\nThe J. Geils Band - Bloodshot (1973, Red Translucent, Santa Maria Pressing, Vinyl) | Discogs\n\nI’ve now picked up two copies of this red vinyl issue of Bloodshot, both advertised as VG+. Neither was. Both were really VG- at best, with plenty of surface noise. Maybe really just “G” since the surface noise is so distracting to be unpleasant. I’m reviewing the best of the two until I can get a cleaner copy. Some great music here nonetheless. The opening cover of House Party is one of the best things they ever did and a concert favorite. I recall that the finale of the reggae-ish Give It To Me is pretty great too. Sandwiched between are the early rock homages Make Up Your Mind and Hold Your Loving, the throw away joke track Don’t Try To Hide It, along with other typical Geils blues rockers. It’s very difficult to listen to albums with this much surface noise and I couldn’t even make it through Side 2. Ouch and Yuck.\n\nThe J. Geils Band – Sanctuary\n\nThe J. Geils Band - Sanctuary. (1978, Winchester Pressing, Vinyl) | Discogs\n\nSo much better! In the shrink with a promo punch with NM vinyl. That last crappy platter really makes me appreciate the slinky sound on this one and J.’s tasteful slide on the first track is perfect, melting just right into Magic Dick’s harp. The band is finally starting to create its own sound, rather than just imitating their heroes. Of course, their next two albums would be monsters, but the seeds are sown here. Handclaps doubling the drums, nice understated keyboards, muscular bass, and well-recorded vocals all sound great on this one. Brings back memories of seeing them play the title track live on SNL, what now 40+ years ago. Ugh. Great sound on this disc, certainly compared to that last one.\n\nGeneration X – Generation X\n\nGeneration X - Generation X (1984, Vinyl) | Discogs\n\nOne of the British punk bands we all loved and really only because of this album. I never heard any of their other recordings until years later. In 1978, we imagined this album stood up there with Never Mind the Bollocks, Damned, Damned, Damned, In the City, and the 1st Clash album that I lucked into finding as the import. Yeah, the sound is muddy. Yeah, the lyrics are silly. Yeah, they’re trying to be pop-py. Yeah, that’s Billy Idol. Yeah, they included a “dub” track. Yeah, the first track is a Lennon cover. And one is called Your Generation. But it has Kiss Me Deadly, which is really great. And Ready Steady Go is great fun too. Promises Promises sounds great. Cuz she’s in love with rock and ro-o-oll. I’ll listen again soon.\n\nGo-Go’s – Beauty and the Beat\n\nGo-Go's - Beauty And The Beat (1981, Terre Haute Pressing, Vinyl) | Discogs\n\nFirst press blue cover in the shrink, really close to NM with no surface noise at all, but it’s been played so can’t be NM. Oh My Cecile. That’s how I heard the big first MTV video hit, and the lead-off track here, initially. I hadn’t heard the Fun Boy 3 version either. It sounds big and full here. Plenty of beach blanket fun follows on side 1, though not up to the quality of Our Lips Are Sealed, although side 1 closer This Town comes closest. Side 2 leads off with slammin’ Schock drums and the Ramones borrowed riff of We Got The Beat and it’s still pretty hot, 40 years later. Side 2 closer hints at the follow-up Vacation. I don’t need much else on side two, but those four mentioned songs, the openers and closers on each side, are all real good.\n\nnext up is ...\n\nGrateful Dead – Workingman’s Dead\n\nThe Grateful Dead - Workingman's Dead (1970, Vinyl) | Discogs\n\nI paid $10.50 for this original green label press with the upside down back cover. From the start with Uncle John’s Band, this is a great sounding disc. The bass, the extra percussion, the vocals, the guitar, all so good. Deadheads probably know this, but I was surprised to see that Robert Hunter wrote or co-wrote every song on this album. The band’s new emphasis on harmony vocals, pedal steel guitar, and Bakersfield country are on display on the next track High Time, and maybe even more so on Dire Wolf. Pigpen gives a great and tough vocal on the bluesy Easy Wind.\n\nGrateful Dead – American Beauty\n\nGrateful Dead* - American Beauty (1970, Warner Bros. Records Inc., Vinyl) | Discogs\n\nI paid $7.50 for this and it’s a solid VG cover with some wear, which befits the vintage cover art, and VG+ greenie vinyl. This greenie doesn’t disappoint. Warm and rich and detailed as so many of these WB shields are. Some slight IGD on Candyman. The Dead upped their ante on the style of Workingman’s Dead and Robert Hunter again co-wrote every song on this album, except Operator, written by Pigpen. Hunter is listed in the credits simply as songwriter. Box of Rain is my favorite Dead song which is a rare Phil Lesh tune, and on which we get extra guitar and bass players. Very possibly the Dead’s single greatest studio album. Everything here works.\n\nGrateful Dead – American Beauty\n\nThe Grateful Dead - American Beauty (180, Vinyl) | Discogs\n\nShootout time. I got duped on this one at the time thinking it was an original, only to discover on inspection that it was a Rhino reissue. With “GI RM Mastered By Capitol” in the deadwax run out, which I think means it’s the 2003 Ron McMaster cut. Well, for the $10 I paid for this, I can have both; they both sound great. Dare I say this reissue may even sound a little better than my original in some respects? It’s a little more detailed in the midrange anyway. Jerry’s floating in the center of the speakers. I miss that dude. I think this was a Rainbo pressing, which would explain the sn, more so than on my original. I don’t know much about this pressing, other than the 2003 Rhino copyright notice on the back cover.\n\nGun Club – Fire of Love\n\nThe Gun Club - Fire Of Love (1981, Vinyl) | Discogs\n\nPink with yellow Ruby cover. The band must have spent between $5 - $10 on the album cover design for this their debut. The recording is not audiophile, but clear. I could have used more bass, but that’s easy enough to fix. Sex Beat is the classic and it’s over before it begins. JLP is a little too close for comfort on the crazy voodoo psychobilly cover of Robert Johnson’s Preaching The Blues and I needed to look closely to confirm that neither man’s ghost was in the room. For the Love of Ivy, Jack on Fire, and others, are definitely not for everyone, but they rock. Fire Spirit reveals a new embryonic melodic sound that would be explored more on the band’s future releases. The cover of Cool Drink of Water overstays its welcome at over 6 minutes.\n\nGun Club – Miami\n\nThe Gun Club - Miami (1982, Vinyl) | Discogs\n\nWhite label Animal. Come down to. The willow garden with me. It’s a dare more than an invitation. This is where our heroes’ story gets really interesting. I know some will point to the raw ragged debut, but Miami is where it’s at for me. JLP has added melody and lyrics to the assault. Bigger and better sounding production and still a pet project of Chris Stein and even a STERLING in the runouts, but far from audiophile, more ghostly. Side 1 is ferocious: Carry Home sets the tone, Dixie-fried Calling up Thunder, the rumbling menace of Brother Sister (Yeah!), and the reimagined drug-fueled baptismal descent of Run Through The Jungle are a relentless barrage into another world. Side 2 can’t quite keep up and stumbles out of the gate with Watermelon Man, but Fire of Love and Mother of Earth are Side 1 worthy.\n\nGuns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction\n\nGuns N' Roses - Appetite For Destruction (1987, Uncensored Cover, SRC Pressing, Vinyl) | Discogs\n\nOriginal cover with inner sleeve, all in great condition. From the “when you’re high you never …” bridge in G-side opener, there’s a tease of the melodic capabilities in the hurricane. These dudes brought the tunes. Man, such great songs. So far ahead of what their supposed peers were doing, you can see why they so quickly gained acclaim with this album, now what nearly 35 years ago!??!!? The R side isn’t quite as good as the G side, but it does feature the breakout Sweet Child O’ Mine and the great Rocket Queen. Once upon a time, there was a reason for the monster success these outlaws enjoyed.\n\nGuns N Roses – Greatest Hits\n\nGuns N' Roses - Greatest Hits (2020, Paradise City Splatter, Vinyl) | Discogs\n\nStumbled on this on a random Wal-Mart trip. Saw there was a modest vinyl selection so flipped through and picked up this and Kiss Love Gun, both on splatter colored vinyl. This is a very good selection of tracks that hits a lot of the high points and most popular tracks, and like nearly every other collection leaves out some things that I would have included. That’s not the test though. The test is whether or not it’s a good listen, and it is. It sounds fine, nothing special. But it’s a great reminder of how many iconic songs GnR had on Appetite and Illusion (1987 and 1991)."
