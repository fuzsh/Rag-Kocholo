        "text": "[Album 799/1001]\n\nFull credit to The Electric Prunes – they know how to craft an intriguing title.\n\nBeginning with the seemingly oxymoronic band name, The Electric Prunes. If asked to name an bold / exciting / invigorating fruit, how many people would choose dried / humiliated plums?\n\nThen there’s the album name, I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night). Had anyone else previously considered that there might be an optimal quantity of dreams in a given sleep? Or that exceeding that desired amount would be a problem to be addressed through song?\n\nAnd perhaps most thought-provoking of all, the track, Are You Lovin’ Me More (But Enjoying It Less).\n\nIt got me thinking about long-term relationships between bands & fans.\n\nIn my case, Radiohead.\n\nWith each subsequent album, I find my love / respect / admiration for the band continues to grow. Though at the same time, with the odd exception, I find I’m enjoying the newer albums less than their predecessors.\n\nSo I’m curious as to how that will one day apply to a relatively new-to-me group like The Electric Prunes.\n\nWith their debut, thus far, enjoyment hasn’t been hard to come by.\n\nFor starters, Train for Tomorrow feels like a preview of Nirvana’s About a Girl. Its followup track, Sold to the Highest Bidder features an electric mandolin-esque sound (which delightfully brings Flight of the Conchords to mind). Then there’s a dash of harpsichord in The King Is in the Counting House…so there’s plenty to enjoy within the sub-30-minute running time.\n\nBut I wouldn’t say I’m head over heels just yet.\n\nOver time though, will I fall deeper in love?\n\nAnd will it inevitably be offset by a decrease in enjoyment?\n\nWe shall see!\n\n.\n\n…..\n\nVerbalize the Positive\n\nFor fans of The Onion, there’s a Canadian comparable named, The Beaverton."
