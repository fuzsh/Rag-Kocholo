One series I have here is called \"back from the grave\" just amazing how these small unknown bands can flat out rock\n\nMar 28, 2004 at 8:55 AM Post #4 of 9\n\nservoled\n\n100+ Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nMar 28, 2004\n\nPosts\n\n102\n\nLikes\n\n0\n\nI'd agree that the Nuggets box sets are a great place to start. Another series is the Teenage Shutdown series. If your interested in finding more bands I highly reccomend listening to the following radio shows from WFMU:\n\nDave the Spazz - Music to Spazz By\n\nBilly Kelly - Teenage Wasteland\n\nBoth shows are broadcast weekly in real audio and streaming mp3 and play a fair amount of 60's music. Dave the Spazz plays more rockabilly, r&b, blues, soul, and rock while Bill Kelly plays more straight up garage rock or as he says \"Real Rock n' Roll\". There are also archives in real audio format and playlists going back to sometime in 2000 for both shows so you can listen whenever you want.\n\nMar 29, 2004 at 8:07 PM Post #5 of 9\n\nZ-Tab\n\nHead-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nAug 14, 2003\n\nPosts\n\n57\n\nLikes\n\n0\n\nI went through a big phase of buying up obscure 60's stuff. A few highlights...\n\nThirteenth Floor Elevators - Easter Everywhere\n\nThe United States of America - S/T\n\nMonks - Black Monk Time\n\nSpirit - 12 Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus\n\nThe Move - Omnibus (a singles comp.)\n\nMoby Grape - S/T and 1969\n\nAnd I definitely agree that the Nuggets sets are well worth picking up.\n\nMar 30, 2004 at 3:43 AM Post #6 of 9\n\ndaycart1\n\nCeremonial old guy, bifocals and all.All the philosophy he can muster can't solve the mysterious double-post.\n\nJoined\n\nMar 28, 2002\n\nPosts\n\n4,710\n\nLikes\n\n13\n\nI second the Electric Prunes.\n\nEven better:\n\nGraham Bond Organisation\n\nElectric Flag\n\nTen Years After (or are they not obscure?)\n\nMar 30, 2004 at 6:16 AM Post #7 of 9\n\nslipkid\n\nNew Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nJan 5, 2004\n\nPosts\n\n43\n\nLikes\n\n0\n\nManassas\n\nJohn Mayall\n\nTen Years After - Not obsurec hear, but d__m hard to find in any format.
