        "text": "Here are thirty more great albums, to complete my top 100.\n\nThe Next 50 Albums,\n\nfor My Top 100 of the ’60s\n\n(Part 2, 1967-1969)\n\nJump to the playlist at the bottom of each post to listen while you read.\n\nWithin each tier (Top 5, Top 10, Top 20, etc.), all albums are listed roughly chronologically (all release dates from Wikipedia, unless otherwise noted).\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nBetween the Buttons [UK]\n\nReleased 1967/01/20\n\nThis was always one of my favorite Stones albums, even when I knew it was a notch below their greatest. Somehow, I unknowingly ended up with the UK import version of the LP when I was younger, and I was surprised to discover later that the US version was best known for “Ruby Tuesday” and “Let’s Spend the Night Together,” which weren’t even on my copy. My version had no real hits to speak of, but the album tracks were just terrific. It was clear that they were on the cusp of great things ahead.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1967, Top 20\n\nListen to more Rolling Stones.\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 107\n\nRolling Stone: 100 Best Albums of the Past 20 Years (1987), No . 070\n\nRolling Stone 100 Best Albums of All Time (1997), No . 086\n\nRolling Stone: 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2003), No . 355\n\nThe Mothers of Invention\n\nAbsolutely Free\n\nReleased 1967/03/26\n\nTheir debut album was good, but this, their second album, was the one where it all clicked. Both were new to me for this compilation.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1967, Top 30\n\nListen to more Mothers of Invention.\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 182\n\nMoby Grape\n\nMoby Grape\n\nReleased 1967/06/06\n\nI picked this up on vinyl sometime in my grad school days, when I had already switched over primarily to CDs, and was mostly listening to alternative rock. I liked the album, but didn’t listen to it much. It was nice to delve back into it for this project. It’s a very good slice of early psych-rock—perhaps a little too typical of that type of thing, but still a classic listen.\n\nPlaylist Note: Most of this album seems to be unavailable of Spotify. I could find the album, but most tracks were greyed out. Of my three selected tracks (“Hey Grandma,” “Sitting by the Window,” and “Indifference,”) only one was available. Worth the effort to track down, I’d say.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1967, Top 30\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 085\n\n1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005)\n\nRolling Stone: 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2003), No . 121\n\nNME Writers All-Time 100 (1974), No. 090\n\nSmall Faces\n\nThere Are But Four Small Faces [US]\n\nReleased 1967/06/23\n\n(U.S. release in Dec-1967)\n\nSmall Faces was easily one of my biggest discoveries on this compilation. I don’t believe I heard much of them on the album-oriented classic rock radio of my high school and early college years, the primary time in my life that I actually listened extensively to ‘60s music. Back then, my awareness of the ‘60s UK scene was to some extent limited to prominent British Invasion acts—the Beatles and Stones, of course, the Who and the Kinks (although it was mostly the ‘70s and later stuff of both bands that I knew and liked best)—and a few later acts like Led Zeppelin. I knew a few radio hits by the Yardbirds. I knew next to nothing of Small Faces and Pretty Things, let alone more obscure bands like the Creation.\n\nOne of my goals for this project was to dig deeper and discover “new” old music (at least to me). To a true ‘60s expert, I probably haven’t unearthed any revelatory gems; but for me, I found plenty.\n\nThe Small Faces had a number of excellent albums. Any doubt of the extent of their greatness (and obvious influence) could be quickly dispelled by a cursory listen to a few key tracks from their eponymous 1966 debut (“You Need Loving” comes to mind), which should sound eerily familiar to Led Zeppelin fans.\n\nThis album, on the other hand, comes a year and a half later, and it’s probably their best. I’ve listed it here under its U.S. version, There Are But Four Small Faces, which is a repackaging of their (second) eponymous album (released 1967/06/23 in the UK by Immediate Records), incorporating some excellent UK non-album singles into the mix of the best tracks from the UK album. Terrific stuff here.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1967, Top 20\n\nListen to more Small Faces.\n\nPlaylist Note: For the playlist itself, I’ve included the eponymous UK release (not the US release mentioned here). Some of the key singles, included only on the US release, will pop up in the singles playlists. More great music for you!\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 306\n\nThe Creation\n\nWe Are Paintermen\n\nReleased 1967\n\n(released only in Germany, Netherlands, France, Sweden)\n\nAnother great find. Is it the music I’m drawn to, or the story behind it?—a UK band playing in relative obscurity (but well-known enough that the Who tried to recruit their guitarist), never even seeing a record released in their own country, finally getting their due by garage rock obsessives, record collectors, and the occasional movie director.\n\nThe story isn’t that fabulous, actually—similar tales are far too common, I’d guess. But the music is. Yes, the album is uneven, in the way that many excellent albums of the time were, as bands tried to find their voice in a musical landscape that was rapidly changing before their very eyes; there are the obligatory unnecessary covers, and they try on perhaps too wide a variety of styles. But the album as a whole is just great. The classic nugget cut “Making Time” (featured on countless ‘60s compilations, as well as the Rushmore soundtrack) features perhaps the first recorded use of electric guitar played with a violin bow, and there are many other great tracks here to fall for. Terrific stuff.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1967, Top 20\n\nListen to more Creation.\n\nPlaylist Note: This album itself appears to be unavailable of Spotify. However, all the tracks from the album are available on the compilation Our Music is Red… with Purple Flashes, as well as How Does It Feel to Feel? and others.\n\nMagic Sam\n\nWest Side Soul\n\nReleased 1967\n\nThis was one of my nicest finds of this project. Chicago soul crooner Magic Sam belts out passionate bursts of emotion punctuated by a warbling vibrato that seems to me to have been a big influence on Cream.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1967, Top 30\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 215\n\nBuffalo Springfield\n\nBuffalo Springfield Again\n\nReleased 1967/10/30\n\nStephen Stills, Neil Young, and the rest of the band crank out a varied disc of country twang and psychedelic-tinged rockers. It’s not entirely consistent (none of their albums were), but the high points are classic. I knew many of the band’s songs but none of their albums before this project.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1967, Top 30\n\nListen to more Buffalo Springfield.\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 081\n\n1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005)\n\nThe Rolling Stone 200 Essential Record Collection (1997)\n\nRolling Stone: 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2003), No . 188\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience\n\nAxis: Bold As Love\n\nReleased 1967/12/01\n\n(first release date given, UK)\n\nI’ve had this one a long time, probably since high school, and for me it was always the lesser of the three big Hendrix albums. Are You Experienced? of course reigns supreme, one of the very best albums of all time, and Electric Ladyland stood out for its spacy excursions into the stratosphere, leaving Axis stuck somewhat in the middle. It wasn’t as good as Experienced, nor as distinctive as Ladyland. Honestly, I don’t think I listened to it much. For this project, I listened more, and further listening pays off. Nothing here grabs me like on the other albums, but my ears now tell me it’s an album almost as good as his others.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1967, Top 30\n\nListen to more Jimi Hendrix.\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 043\n\n1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005)\n\nThe Rolling Stone 200 Essential Record Collection (1997)\n\nRolling Stone: 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2003), No . 082\n\nUncut 200 Greatest Albums of All Time (2016), No . 085\n\nPaste 60 Best Albums of the 1960s, No . 053\n\nThe Who\n\nThe Who Sell Out\n\nReleased 1967/12/15\n\nI was always a bigger fan of The Who’s more serious, bombastic early ‘70s material than their more spritely ‘60s work. I didn’t have this one until I somehow got addicted to a 2005 a capella version of the album by Petra Haden (whose father Charlie Haden would certainly be featured on this compilation if I had included jazz). What this album lacked in hits (only one) it makes up for in wit. The Who’s sense of humor is on full display, both on the cover and in the songs and commercial interludes which make up the music of the album. Today it is often considered one of their best, and for good reason. (I still secretly prefer the a capella version better, but don’t tell any of the many friends who mocked me for it.)\n\nYearly Ranking: 1967, Top 20\n\nListen to more of The Who.\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 060\n\n1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005)\n\nRolling Stone: 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2003), No . 113\n\nNME Greatest Albums of the ’60s (1993), No. 044\n\nUncut 200 Greatest Albums of All Time (2016), No . 191\n\nPaste 60 Best Albums of the 1960s, No . 039\n\nLeonard Cohen\n\nSongs of Leonard Cohen\n\nReleased 1967/12/27\n\nBefore this project, I knew Leonard Cohen mostly through his 1992 album The Future and a greatest hits package of his early work (whose cover was humorously co-opted by Ween on an album I bought around the same time). I rarely find myself in the mood to listen to Cohen for an entire album, but just about all his albums are worthwhile. This one—like all his early releases—is a collection of hushed, brooding, acoustic poetic musings, and it ranks among his very best.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1967, Top 30\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 032\n\n1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005)\n\nSPIN: The Top 100 Alternative Albums of the 1960s, No . 015\n\nSPIN: 25 Greatest Albums of All Time (1989), No . 019\n\nRolling Stone 100 Best Albums of All Time (1997), No . 051\n\nNME Greatest Albums of the ’60s (1993), No. 026\n\nPaste 60 Best Albums of the 1960s, No . 027\n\nAretha Franklin\n\nLady Soul\n\nReleased 1968/01/22\n\nAlong with I Never Loved a Man…, I picked this one up from the recommendation of the 1987 Rolling Stone magazine list. Both are terrific.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1968, Top 12\n\nListen to more Aretha Franklin.\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 033\n\n1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005)\n\nSPIN: 25 Greatest Albums of All Time (1989), No . 013\n\nThe Rolling Stone 200 Essential Record Collection (1997)\n\nRolling Stone: 100 Best Albums of the Past 20 Years (1987), No . 048\n\nRolling Stone 100 Best Albums of All Time (1997), No . 097\n\nRolling Stone: 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2003), No . 084\n\nUncut 200 Greatest Albums of All Time (2016), No . 152\n\nPaste 60 Best Albums of the 1960s, No . 042\n\nDr. John, the Night Tripper\n\nGris-Gris\n\nReleased 1968/01/22\n\nTripped out psychedelic voodoo weirdness, unlike anything else you’ve ever heard—and good, too! I didn’t know this until quite recently, when Dr. John had a comeback album in 2012, and I didn’t listen to it extensively until this project.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1968, Top 20\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 116\n\n1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005)\n\nRolling Stone: 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2003), No . 143\n\nNME Writers All-Time 100 (1974), No. 093\n\nUncut 200 Greatest Albums of All Time (2016), No . 199\n\nThe Wire: 100 Records That Set the World on Fire (When No One was Listening)\n\nThe Velvet Underground\n\nWhite Light/White Heat\n\nReleased 1968/01/30\n\nThis is the Velvets’ most abrasive, dissonant album. I can only listen to it in certain moods, but it’s still a milestone in the formation of my musical aesthetics. Back in late high school, when most of my friends were satisfied checking out the latest Rush album, this was a revelation.

Hazlewood, whom I’d never even heard of at all, first wrote and recorded that number for himself, but it went nowhere before Nancy sung it.\n\nHazlewood has a deep, resonant voice and a quirky sensibility and theatricality that seems at odds with the country and pop music he writes. He’s truly an original. He and Nancy Sinatra had a lengthy, intermittent musical partnership, that yielded many wonderfully catchy (often witty and/or delightfully odd) pop songs. Few of her albums are good all the way through, but Miss Sinatra easily had a full best-of disc of superb material, almost all of which Hazlewood had a hand in somehow. (The mix I made of her work is one of the surprise highlights of my discoveries in this project.)\n\nThe best album by either of them is their collaboration Nancy & Lee, which contains a few older tracks added to more recent material he and Sinatra had recorded together, and it’s just excellent.

Pepper. One of their best, and one of the best of the ‘60s-concept-rock mini-genre. I’ve heard it’s too quintessentially British for an American like me to fully appreciate, so if you’re a Brit you might rank this even higher.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1968, Top 20\n\nListen to more Small Faces.\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 079\n\n1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005)\n\nNME Greatest Albums of the ’60s (1993), No. 022\n\nThe Band\n\nMusic from Big Pink\n\nReleased 1968/07/01\n\nI’ve never been all that much of a Band fan. I first bought their first two, highly acclaimed, albums after reading that 1987 Rolling Stone list. They were good, yes. But they didn’t fill me with passion. I always preferred the innovative side of ‘60s music to the retro roots country-rock movement that reacted against it. I understand the need to simplify an art form that was starting to get overblown and a bit ridiculous. But the Band’s music was, frankly, less interesting to me. I felt similarly about the other roots album that helped close the door on the psychedelic movement, The Byrds’ Sweetheart of the Rodeo.\n\nI did like many of the Band’s songs, however, especially those on this album. Listening to it now, I like it even more. I’m not about to put it on my Desert Island Top 10, but this one fits in my ‘60s top 100 quite nicely. It’s really very good.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1968, Top 20\n\nListen to more of The Band.\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 024\n\n1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005)\n\nRolling Stone: 100 Best Albums of the Past 20 Years (1987), No . 041\n\nRolling Stone 100 Best Albums of All Time (1997), No . 073\n\nRolling Stone: 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2003), No . 034\n\nNME Writers All-Time 100 (1974), No. 010\n\nNME Writers All-Time 100 Albums (1985), No. 072\n\nNME Greatest Albums of the ’60s (1993), No. 039\n\nUncut 200 Greatest Albums of All Time (2016), No . 066\n\nPaste 60 Best Albums of the 1960s, No . 012\n\nEtta James\n\nTell Mama\n\nReleased 1968/08/21\n\nThis is a great blast of Southern soul, worthy of a place alongside other great ‘60s R&B classics from Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, and more. I prefer this one slightly to the standard critics’ darling, 1961’s At Last, which is also quite fine. Tell Mama is more upbeat and dynamic, which I generally prefer to the slow-burning grooves. Both were new to me before this project.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1968, Top 20\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 213\n\nDavid Axelrod\n\nSongs of Innocence\n\nReleased 1968/10\n\nI first heard of Axelrod with his eponymous 2001 comeback album, which was released in a critical fanfare prompted by the influence he’d had on many contemporary artists, such as DJ Shadow. He’s a frequently sampled and referenced guy, apparently. This is the best of his early albums, when he was first blending rhythmic orchestration into pop songs. (His first experiments came with the hijacking of the The Electric Prunes for Mass in F Minor and Release of an Oath.) These are great orchestral pieces with pulsing beats and eerie dissonant string sustains, 30 years ahead of their time. I can’t imagine what people must have thought of this stuff back then, but to me now it sounds just great.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1968, Top 12\n\nListen to more David Axelrod.\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nSPIN: The Top 100 Alternative Albums of the 1960s, No . 064\n\nBonzo Dog Band\n\nThe Doughnut in Granny’s Greenhouse\n\nReleased 1968/11\n\nI knew nothing of this bizarre novelty act before this project, and it’s easy to see why: no classic rock radio station would ever get within 10-foot-pole striking range of it. If it sounds like something straight out of a Monty Python musical, there’s good reason for that; these guys were Python contemporaries and collaborators. They’re cut from the same silly cloth, and the musical world is all the better for it. Great, quirky stuff.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1968, Top 12\n\nListen to more Bonzo Dog Band.\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music , bubbling under the top 3000 albums of all time\n\nThe Soft Machine\n\nThe Soft Machine\n\nReleased 1968/12\n\nI picked up Soft Machine’s third album sometime in the early 21st century, but didn’t know their other stuff at all. Their third album is quite good, and this one, their debut, is probably even better. Great prog-rock. And no, that’s not an oxymoron.\n\nListen to more Soft Machine.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1968, Top 20\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 142\n\nNME Writers All-Time 100 (1974), No. 040\n\nCaetano Veloso\n\nCaetano Veloso [1969]\n\nReleased 1969\n\nOther than an Os Mutantes disc that I rarely listened to, I didn’t have much Brazilian music to speak of, although I’d heard plenty of it during the Tropicalia rediscovery of the late ‘80s (led by David Byrne) when I was in college. This is a terrific album that infused traditional Brazilian music with a heavy dosage of psychedelia and Western pop influence. Great stuff. There are more Brazilian artists and albums further down in my top 200, but this might be the best place to start.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1969, Top 30\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music , bubbling under the top 3000 albums of all time\n\nSPIN: The Top 100 Alternative Albums of the 1960s, No . 067\n\nThe Flying Burrito Bros\n\nThe Gilded Palace of Sin\n\nReleased 1969/02\n\nI knew most of this album from a Gram Parsons compilation I picked up around the turn of the century. And I knew Gram Parsons from his brief stint in the Byrds for Sweetheart of the Rodeo. I like the psychedelic Byrds albums more than Sweetheart, and I like this Flying Burrito Bros album better, too. The three tracks I’ve selected—all of which I’d heard before, without knowing what they were—are the standouts, but there are certainly plenty of other good tracks here, making this the best place to hear Parsons at his finest. Gram Parsons is an iconic figure in popular music history, regarded as the father of country rock and a genius whose live was tragically cut shot. I’m not convinced, entirely, but this album is certainly worth getting to know.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1969, Top 20\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 045\n\n1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005)\n\nSPIN: The Top 100 Alternative Albums of the 1960s, No . 005\n\nSPIN: The Top 100 Alternative Albums (SPIN Alternative Record Guide, 1995), No . 033\n\nThe Rolling Stone 200 Essential Record Collection (1997)\n\nRolling Stone 100 Best Albums of All Time (1997), No . 078\n\nRolling Stone: 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2003), No . 192\n\nNME Greatest Albums of the ’60s (1993), No. 030\n\nUncut 200 Greatest Albums of All Time (2016), No . 095\n\nJoe Cocker\n\nWith a Little Help from My Friends\n\nReleased 1969/05\n\nI had heard several of Cocker’s terrific songs before, but I didn’t know any of his albums. He didn’t write many songs himself, but he was a master of reinterpretation of other people’s material. It’s rare to find an artist who can competently cover songs by The Beatles and Traffic and not make listeners rush back to the originals; it’s another level of accomplishment entirely to make the definitive versions of songs originally written and recorded by those artists. Cocker, with his soulful pleading and charged delivery, backed by a star-studded band and terrific soul singers, can make any song his own and fill it with irresistible urgency.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1969, Top 20\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 212\n\nNME Writers All-Time 100 (1974), No. 072\n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash\n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash\n\nReleased 1969/05/29\n\nI expected to hate this one, simply because I had long ago rejected this band. I couldn’t remember exactly when it was that I loved Crosby, Stills, and Nash. A little research tells me that their album Daylight Again, which I had and listened to a ton, came out in 1982, so that would place my CSN-loving days around eighth grade or so. I had Daylight plus a best-of compilation called So Far that contained most of this one, their debut, and I had my parents’ copy of Déjà Vu, with Neil Young (the rare rock album my parents owned—they had a few rock and pop albums but are mostly classical music lovers).\n\nI really liked the band at the time, among many other bands I later cast aside. I assume it’s common to reject the music you liked as a young teen in one’s later years. Certainly, I can’t imagine myself not condemning CSN by my mid-college days, a mere six or seven years later, when I was hooked on Sonic Youth, the Pixies, and Public Enemy.\n\nAt some point between then and this project, I also picked up this debut album on vinyl. The album is excellent, a great blend of rock with country and folk sensibilities. At times, though—especially when the vocal harmonies kick in—a little of that old alt-rock-aesthetic scorn creeps in; Crosby and Stills almost uniformly contribute good stuff, but Nash often comes across as a touch too saccharine-sweet for me. (I would notice a similar trend during my ’70s listening binge, when I explored their solo works.) Regardless, the album is a classic.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1969, Top 20\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 071\n\n1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005)\n\nRolling Stone: 100 Best Albums of the Past 20 Years (1987), No . 074\n\nRolling Stone: 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2003), No . 259\n\nNME Writers All-Time 100 (1974), No. 023\n\nPaste 60 Best Albums of the 1960s, No . 028\n\nFairport Convention\n\nUnhalfbricking\n\nReleased 1969/07/03\n\nThe critics’ favorite of Fairport Convention seems to be Leige and Lief, which was hailed as their return to traditional British folk, after a couple albums spent absorbing contemporary rock influences. But as with the Byrds, Dylan, and plenty of others, I prefer the less traditional-sounding stuff. I bought both Unhalfbricking and Liege and Lief around the turn of the century, I believe, and I loved one and liked the other. Here, singer Sandy Denny is in peak form, contributing two of the best songs, and guitarist Richard Thompson and the band really dig into the traditional “A Sailor’s Life,” turning it into a genuine folk-rock epic. Great stuff.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1969, Top 20\n\nListen to more Fairport Convention.\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 090\n\n1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005)\n\nNick Drake\n\nFive Leaves Left\n\nReleased 1969/07/03\n\nAlthough I remember hearing of Nick Drake in college—someone I knew must have had the 1986 Fruit Tree box set—I don’t remember actually hearing his music. I became more familiar with his actual music around the turn of the century, around the same time I first heard Fairport Convention. I was living with a bunch of guys in a mildly beat-up place we called “The Central” because the name was inscribed on the building (on Central Street, Somerville), and I believe it was one of my roommates who introduced me to both Drake and Fairport. Pretty soon, I had all of Drake’s three official album releases. Although he got better with each release, all three albums are great. In this, his debut, he emerges with his hushed, melodic vocals and gentle guitar picking already presenting a coherent artistic vision.\n\nI recall reading the comments section of the Paste Magazine list (below), and discovering a reader who was incensed that the album was on the list. He called the list revisionist history because it included Drake and a few other artists whom nobody knew in the ‘60s themselves. He seemed to suggest that only people who had lived through and experienced the ‘60s were qualified to judge its music. It’s an interesting opinion, I suppose; one should always look back to the source when studying an era.\n\nHowever, it’s such a misguided idea. From what I know of mid-19th century American literature, for example, Hawthorne and Twain were quite well-respected by their contemporaries, but others like Poe and (especially) Melville were relative unknowns. To us now, of course, all four authors seem critical to an understanding of the writing of the age. Likewise, a great album that is unknown at the time (such as any of the Velvets’ albums) can be of tremendous importance to future generations.\n\nNick Drake may not have been as well-known then as now, but his albums are still terrific. And all history is revisionist, the past seen through the eyes of the present. The shame in this occurs when untruths are created, not when undiscovered gems are unearthed.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1969, Top 20\n\nListen to more Nick Drake.\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 036\n\n1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005)\n\nSPIN: The Top 100 Alternative Albums of the 1960s, No . 027\n\nRolling Stone: 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2003), No . 283\n\nNME Writers Top 100 Albums (1993), No. 074\n\nNME Greatest Albums of the ’60s (1993), No. 037\n\nUncut 200 Greatest Albums of All Time (2016), No . 183\n\nPaste 60 Best Albums of the 1960s, No . 044\n\nKing Crimson\n\nIn the Court of the Crimson King\n\nReleased 1969/10/10\n\nMy peak prog-rock period (during which Yes was my favorite band) began sometime during my freshman year of high school and had peaked and faded by the end of my sophomore year. But my big King Crimson-listening days came later in high school. They were the prog band I still listened to as my tastes were shifting toward more critically acclaimed rock, in the general direction of what would later be called alternative. (Even now, King Crimson seems to get more cred from alt-rock critics than their other prog-rock brethren.) My favorites then were a trio of ‘80s albums and a late-‘70s Fripp solo album, but I was also into this one.\n\nEven then, I knew that about half the album sounded dated. Yet the shocking abrasiveness and moments of unbridled chaos in “21st Century Schizoid Man” and the less ear-splitting sustained Mellotron melodies of the title track still hold their own even now. A somewhat corny but groundbreaking classic.\n\nYearly Ranking: 1969, Top 20\n\nNotable Critical Mentions:\n\nAcclaimed Music top albums of the ’60s, No. 030\n\n1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005)\n\nNME Writers All-Time 100 (1974), No. 037\n\nPaste 60 Best Albums of the 1960s, No . 022\n\nHere’s a playlist of the albums discussed in this post—three tracks per album.
