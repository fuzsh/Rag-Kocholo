        "text": "Part# 6 –“the Leather Souls”.\n\nThe Jam session would go on for hours and the Leather souls would again start at 8:00 PM and play until 1130: PM. The Sunday group was older people due to the fact that the 6% bars were closed. One of the frequent customers to the club on Sunday night was Ken Palmer. Ken was the owner of KIMN Radio Station in Denver. It was the top AM rock and roll station in Denver 950 on the dial. Pogo Poge, Danny Davis was two of my favorite DJ’s. Ken Palmer would always invite me down to the station for a tour. He liked our group a lot and always told me he would play our originals on KIMN if we would do a record. He was a powerful man in the Denver Rock scene. I remember one Christmas he invited me to the KIMN Christmas party at Lafitte’s Restaurant in downtown Denver. It was an annual party that people would fight for invitations to. Everyone that was anyone was at the party. It was the biggest event of celebrities and business men that I had ever gone to. Great food, conversation and networking opportunities, that’s what I saw there. I was the only long haired person there. I felt like a thorn amongst the roses.\n\nPeople would look at me and give me this puzzled look, like what are you doing here. Long hair was unusual when I got out of the service. It was really only musicians that let their hair get long for awhile there. Then you started to see it everywhere. I can’t tell you how many times I was hassled for having long hair. I had long hair and a beard. I will never forget some lady coming up to me and asking if she could feel my beard. I declined. I was at the biggest party I had ever been to and some chick wants to rub my face with her hands in front of all those people. Get out of here. This party later on in my life led to some big life changes for me. I met the Sr. Vice President of the station at the party, named Byron Holton who basically ran the station. He took a liking to me and we over a period of time became the best of friends. Byron came from New Mexico where he was a disc jockey that operated under the stage name of Jerry Jackson. He is the first disc jockey to play a Glen Campbell single on the air in Gallup New Mexico. He later went on to Chicago to start a company consulting to radio stations before being hired by Ken Palmer to work in Denver at KIMN. I remember the sales manager Tom Jones. He dated a singer in Denver named Lanny Garrett. He was a big guy and appeared to me to be a real tough. I was around him a few times in the future and was eventually a customer of the radio station when I went into the nightclub business.\n\nThe Leather Souls would play a circuit in Colorado before settling down again in Denver at JB’s and the Galaxy on Monday Night. We would play in Colorado Springs, Gunnison at the Ramble Inn and The Last Chance Saloon. From there we played a college in Alamosa and then to Aspen, we played for Don Fleisher at the Galena Street East. On the way back to Denver we would rent a hall in Glenwood Springs and do a night there for the kids. From Glenwood Springs we would head to Grand Junction to play The Goal Post then back to Denver and from there to the Library in Greeley and then to the Green Onion in Ft. Collins. When you play out of town and the night is over and the patron all go home we all would be wide awake. It was hard to go to sleep after you were pumping out rock and roll all night and your adrenaline is pumping and you get higher and higher on the music and the sound you make. The fact that you are watching people having a fantastic time all night and you are up on stage working in a way gets to you every now and then. I think that’s why so many musicians get high. You have to be in music for the music. So many of the guys I worked with were doing music for the peripheral benefits, the groupies, the drugs and the fact that they were lazy.\n\nI was engaged to Sheila Morgan, Ron Morgan’s sister when I was drafted in 1964. I had not seen her since my leave in July of 1965 and had lost track of her and Ron Morgan. I knew he was in California but that is all I heard. I was living with Corky Young when I was in town. He had a house in East Denver and I rented a room from him. He was playing in The Mothers Children and doing well with his nightclub gigs. One night when I came home Ron Morgan was there. He was staying there for awhile with Corky and had just returned from California where he was doing studio work. He worked with the Standell’s, The Association, Moby Grape, The Electric Prunes, and did studio work for Three Dog Night and the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band. He was out of money and needed to go to work. I told him about the Leather Souls and how I would like to get rid of Bob Yaezel and get a new lead guitar player. I invited him down to JB’s to sit in with us.\n\nWhen Ron Morgan was in California he was a member of Moby Grape, and a couple of other bands. He also did the studio work for Three Dog Night with Jimmy Greenspoon the red headed organ player. Jimmy and Ron also did the studio work for an attorney named Bob Markley that called his album The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band. Ron had come back to Denver broke and when I saw him he asked if I could use him in The Leather Souls. I helped him out. We did not make any more money with him in the band and we all had to divide our payments five ways instead of four which was okay. Ron asked if the band wanted to tour as the Wet Coast Pop Art Band. Bob Markely had called and was looking for a group to learn the album and do the Teenage Fair Tour. I talked to Bob Markley several times about taking the name and touring as the West coast Pop Art Band and I asked him to provide me a contract, which I wanted from anyone we worked for. I wanted a contract from him regarding payment for the show schedules, payment for practice to learn the album, travel expenses and all the essentials that you want included as a band and he never wanted to do that. I guess it was to business like and he was a attorney. He wanted to be a musician and run up and down the aisles rattling a tambourine. That’s all he could do. He couldn’t sing and he couldn’t play and instrument he was like a male groupie.\n\nI refused to go without a firm contract. When I told Ron and the rest of the group that Markley wouldn’t give me a signed agreement Ron Morgan took Bob Yaezel (who was drugged out anyway) and Roger Bryant and they went to Boulder City Nevada to work out the album. I felt that Ron Morgan ended up stuffing me after all I had done to help him. When there was an article published about the band Bob Yaezel said that Bob Markly did not want the drummer because I was too old. What crap. He was an attorney. He did not want anything in writing, why would he, he didn’t want to commit and he eventually sent them back to Colorado the hard way hitchhiking home. The great musicians did what Bob Markely wanted them to do. They came home broke and without any equipment. Bob Yaezel hitch hiked back to Denver with his guitar, no money and no place to stay. He told me the story about the long hours and the hardship they endured travelling around the country playing as the West Coast Pop Art Band. It wasn’t what he signed on for. He said it was like slave labor. He told me he was left homeless in Los Angeles and was selling newspapers on Sunset Blvd for 25 cents a paper just to eat. When he came back to Denver his parents would not let him move back in with them. I let him stay in a room at a Hotel I was involved with at that time. He never paid a nickel. Ron Morgan and Jimmy Greenspoon came back to Denver a short time after Yaezel did.\n\nWhen Ron and Jimmy Greenspoon came back to Denver they wanted to start another group. At the time I owned a Bar and restaurant and was involved with the Hotel in Downtown Denver around the corner from the Exodus. They formed a band called the Superband. Roger Bryant, Bob Yaezel, Ron Morgan, Jimmy Greenspoon and Myron Pollack the drummer that used to hang around JB’s at the Sunday jam sessions."
