        "text": "Overview of the events of 1969 in music\n\nList of years in music (table)\n\n+...\n\nList of notable events in music that took place in the year 1969.\n\nSpecific locations\n\n[edit]\n\n1969 in British music\n\n1969 in Norwegian music\n\nSpecific genres\n\n[edit]\n\n1969 in country music\n\n1969 in jazz\n\nEvents\n\n[edit]\n\nSummary\n\n[edit]\n\nPerhaps the two most famous musical events of 1969 were concerts. At a Rolling Stones concert in Altamont, California, a fan was stabbed to death by Hells Angels, a biker gang that had been hired to provide security for the event. In retrospect, some commentators have concluded that the violence signaled the end of the \"hippie\" movement, which espoused an ethos of free love and peace. Even more famous than the Altamont concert was the Woodstock festival, which consisted of dozens of the most famous performers in the world at the time, playing together in an atmosphere of peace with nature and love, with many thousands of concert goers; it is still one of the largest concerts in the history of the world. One of those who performed was Ravi Shankar, his presence reflecting a growing interest in Indian and other Eastern music; Shankar later said that the 1960s \"got India wrong\".[1] \"Black Woodstock\", the Harlem Cultural Festival, took place in New York City.[2] The Beatles' rooftop concert was the last time the band played together in public.\n\nThe 1967 musical Hair generated the same-named 1968 album, whose cuts include \"Aquarius\" and \"Let The Sunshine In\", \"Hair\", \"Good Morning Starshine\", \"Easy to Be Hard\" (covered, chronologically and respectively, by The 5th Dimension at number 1, The Cowsills at number 2, Oliver at number 3, Three Dog Night at number 4, on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1969), and others, and a London Cast album released in April 1969.\n\nThe Isle of Wight Festival saw the return of Bob Dylan to live music after his motorbike accident in 1966.\n\nUS and UK pop music remained popular worldwide, with few European acts making the charts outside their home countries; exceptions included Jane Birkin & Serge Gainsbourg, Shocking Blue, Georges Moustaki and Christian Anders.[3]\n\nDavid Bowie's \"Space Oddity\" became a huge hit in this year, being released at the time that American astronauts first landed on the Moon. The song, the story of an astronaut named Major Tom who goes into space and is entranced by the beauty of seeing Earth from such a great distance and consequently lets himself float off into space, never again to return, was chosen by the BBC as the theme song for the television coverage of the Moon landing. The remainder of the album, Man of Words/Man of Music, was too eccentric for mainstream acceptance, though it established a devoted fanbase for Bowie, who would go on to become one of the most popular musicians in the world.\n\nKing Crimson's In the Court of the Crimson King is a pioneering album in the development of progressive rock. The album drew upon influences like Procol Harum, The Moody Blues and The Nice to form a sound melding rock and roll with classical influences in long pieces of music. Similar albums by The Moody Blues, Procol Harum and The Nice, as well as Genesis, Yes and Pink Floyd were also released this year, expanding the range of prog rock and developing it into a full-fledged genre.\n\nThe Stooges' eponymous debut, The Stooges, was also released this year to little critical or popular acceptance. The album, however, went on to become one of the most important recordings in the early development of punk rock, as did Kick Out The Jams by Detroit protopunkers MC5.\n\nJohnny Cash's At San Quentin included his only Top Ten pop hit, \"A Boy Named Sue\". The album was a sequel to last year's At Folsom Prison. Also in country music, Merle Haggard's Same Train, Different Time, a tribute to Jimmie Rodgers, was enormously popular and influenced the development of the Bakersfield sound into outlaw country within a few years.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival cement their success from the previous year. Having had a single US number 11 hit in 1968 with \"Suzie Q\", they release not only their second, but also their third and fourth proper studio album in 1969, as well as drawing a total of four top 3 hits from these three albums. Starting with Bayou Country, including the US number 2 hit \"Proud Mary\", and continuing with Green River and finally Willy and the Poor Boys, which, during the year, transformed them from an up-and-coming underground act to bona fide rock stars. During 1969, Creedence Clearwater Revival had number 2 hits in the US with \"Proud Mary\", \"Green River\" and \"Bad Moon Rising\", and also have a number 3 hit with \"Down on the Corner\"/\"Fortunate Son\".\n\nGilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso released enormously popular albums in Brazil, Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, respectively. The pair's fusion of bossa nova, samba and other native Brazilian folk influences, melded with politically and socially aware lyrics, kickstarted what came to be known as Tropicalia. Both musicians moved to London after a period of imprisonment for anti-government activities in Brazil.\n\nFamily released their second album, Family Entertainment, in their native Britain. It is their first top 10 album in the United Kingdom, hitting number six. \"The Weaver's Answer\", which opens the record, becomes their most popular song in their concert performances. By the end of the year, however, they lose and replace two members, and their first attempt to break through commercially in the United States backfires miserably.\n\nElvis Presley returned to live performances at the International Hotel in Las Vegas; breaking all attendance records in his 57-concert run. He also enjoyed great success with his songs \"In the Ghetto\" and \"Suspicious Minds\".\n\nThe Wendy Carlos album Switched-On Bach was one of the first classical albums to sell 500,000 copies, and helped bring classical music into the popular sphere, as did Mason Williams' \"Classical Gas\", played on classical guitar, in addition to being accompanied by one of the first successful music videos.[4] The composition won three Grammy Awards: Best Instrumental Composition, Best Contemporary-Pop Performance, Instrumental, and Best Instrumental Arrangement.[5] In the meantime, German trumpeter Manfred Schoof's free jazz album, European Echoes, a recording of his half-hour free improvisation broadcast on German radio in June 1969, featured international musicians and is regarded as a seminal album in the genre.[6]\n\nChutney music was also first recorded in 1969, in Trinidad and Tobago by Sundar Popo.\n\n1969 was the last year in which the United States government gave greater financial support, through the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) \"Music Program\" to opera than it did to other classical music, and the first year in which it gave any support at all to jazz and folk music.[7]\n\nNew York City Ballet celebrates their 25th anniversary with performances at the David H.

He decides before returning to the UK to leave The Beatles permanently. During the show, a chicken is somehow in a feather pillow that Alice Cooper normally uses as a stage routine during his band's performance.

These recaps, as well as the weekly charts, do not reflect actual sales figures. The ratings take into account the number of weeks the disk was on the chart, plus the weekly positions it held during its chart life. Each disk was given points accordingly for its respective chart. These recaps were compiled by the staff of the Billboard Popularity Charts Department, under the direction of Andy Tomko. NOTE: Since the singles charts listed the most popular single sides and not the single record (with both sides) for the first 47 weeks of the year, the recaps list single sides in order of strength. In the case of a two-sided hit single, both sides were listed in the recaps based on the individual strength on the weekly chart.\n\nThe 1969 Billboard year-end list is composed of records that entered the Billboard Hot 100 during November–December 1968 (only when the majority of chart weeks were in 1969), January to November–December 1969 (majority of chart weeks in 1969). Records with majority of chart weeks in 1968 or 1970 are included in the year-end charts for those years, respectively, and multiple appearances are not permitted. Each week thirty points were awarded to the number one record, then nineteen points for number two, eighteen points for number three, and so on. The total points a record earned determined its year-end rank. The complete chart life of each record is represented. There are no ties, even when multiple records have the same number of points. The next ranking category is peak chart position, then weeks at peak chart position, weeks in top ten, weeks in top forty, and finally weeks on Hot 100 chart.\n\nThe chart can be sorted by Artist, Song title, Recording and Release dates, Cashbox year-end ranking (CB) or units sold (sales) by clicking on the column header. Additional details for each record can be accessed by clicking on the song title, and referring to the Infobox in the right column of the song page. Billboard also has chart summaries on its website. Cashbox rankings were derived by same process as the Billboard rankings. Sales information was derived from the RIAA's Gold and Platinum database, the BRIT Certified database and The Book of Golden Discs,[22] but numbers listed should be regarded as estimates. Grammy Hall of Fame and National Recording Registry information with sources can be found on Wikipedia.\n\nRank Artist Title Label Recorded Release Date CB Sales Charts, Awards 1 The 5th Dimension
