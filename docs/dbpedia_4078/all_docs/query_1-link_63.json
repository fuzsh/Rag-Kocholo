        "text": "Bubble Puppy was a psychedelic rock band formed in 1967 in Austin, Texas by Rod Prince and Roy Cox. Looking to form a \"top gun rock band\" based on the concept of dual lead guitars, Prince and Cox recruited Todd Potter, a gymnast, saxophone player and guitarist.\n\nWith the addition of Danny Segovia, the original line up of Bubble Puppy was complete. Bubble Puppy's live debut was as the opening act for The Who in San Antonio.After several line-up changes, the final roster for Bubble Puppy settled at Rod Prince and Todd Potter on lead guitars, Roy Cox on bass guitar and David 'Fuzzy' Fore on drums.\n\nIn 1967, Bubble Puppy moved to Austin, Texas and signed a recording contract with Houston-based International Artists, home to the 13th Floor Elevators and the Red Krayola.Bubble Puppy had a minor hit for International Artists in 1968 with \"Hot Smoke & Sasafrass\".\n\nAlthough the single was popular in Europe it languished in the United States, never climbing above 14 on the Billboard 100. Its lack of performance at home was the source of considerable friction between the band and International Artists, as was the label's refusal to sign a licensing deal for the single with the Beatles' Apple Records.\n\nIn 1969, Bubble Puppy released their only full-length LP A Gathering of Promises. After continuous conflict with International Artists over financial issues, the band eventually left the label. Signing up with Nick St.\n\nNicholas of Steppenwolf as a manager, Bubble Puppy moved to Los Angeles in 1970, changed their name to Demian and signed to ABC-Dunhill.The members of Bubble Puppy continued to be active in the music industry after the band's demise.\n\nPotter and Prince played with Sirius through the late 1970's, and Fore drummed with the Texas punk rock band D-Day, co-writing their cult hit \"Too Young to Date\".The name \"Bubble Puppy\" was taken from \"Centrifugal Bumble-Puppy\", a fictitious children's game in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World.\n\nDemian was named after Herman Hesse's 1919 novel, and \"Hot Smoke & Sasafrass\" was a line lifted from an episode of The Beverly Hillbillies."
