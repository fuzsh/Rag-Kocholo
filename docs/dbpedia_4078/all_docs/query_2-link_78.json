Side one is a neo classical prog rock epic in the style of Renaissance and Continuum, inspired by the wild and pagan isles of St Kilda where, as a 16 yr old, the composer Peter McKerrow was taken by military launch to conduct a census on the rare Soay Sheep that live there. A storm blew away his tent on the first night. The other side is by his Canadian pal who attended the same Uni in england, deeply homesick for Canada and surviving a broken relationship these songs are melancholic and Leonard Cohen-esque. The original Lp is astonishingly gorgeous and one of the most desirable artifacts of the prog era.” Gatefold edition, limited to 500x copies. LP  $22 SKU:24143ANTORCHA- ST( lincredible late 60s/early 70’s anarchistic acid/psych rock tracks )  Label:VAM MEXICO   Housed in nice gatefold cover, with liner notes, pictures, discography and poster insert. Official limited edition vinyl from the original masters, featuring incredible late 60s/early 70’s anarchistic acid/psych rock tracks with fuzz, organs and all around great vibe. After the split of Las Antorchas, Victor Motta Aviles and band mate Omar Cortes Gaviño teamed up with Victor&#039;s brother Guillermo and continued as Antorcha. Along with Náhuatl and Toncho Pilatos, Antorcha were one of the few groups in Mexico that managed to break the influences of foreign bands—and government oppression—and find their own (demented) sound. In fact, Antorcha set out to cerate an anarchist awareness among young people in the era; they understood anarchy as “respect to youth, the right to free-thinking, and breaking political and religious taboos.” And the music—acid psychedelic rock, with intelligent use of fuzz guitar and a strong rhythm section. Greats stuff from start to finish—all originals—that we can easily rate as some of the best psych rock ever made in Mexico! This LP has all of the band’s EP and single tracks, plus one from their only album, which came out at the end of their career.  LP  $12 SKU:19497BOOGIE - IN FREAK TOWN (1968 S.F power trio)w insert SAALE-Label:OUT SIDER  Here&#039;s an LP of awesome, previously unreleased recordings of a very loud power trio from San Francisco, modeled after Cream, Blue Cheer and The Jimi Hendrix Experience. Included are a fantastic studio demo from 1968 plus raw and wild live tracks from 1969. Comrades of Moby Grape and The Sons Of Champlin, this power-trio was formed by Barry &quot;The Bee&quot; Bastian (Canned Heat, Lee Michaels...) on guitar and vocals, John Barrett (The Rhythm Dukes) on bass and Fuzzy John Oxendine (Roky Erickson &amp;amp; The Aliens, Jerry Miller Band...) on drums. The LP comes with an insert featuring rare photos and detailed liner notes, and a download for the full album plus bonus material.  LP  $22 SKU:25204BRIGG- ST (collectable psych/folk/hard-rock album from 1973.) SAALE Label:GUERSSEN First ever legit vinyl reissue, sanctioned by the band members, of this collectable psych/folk/hard-rock album from 1973. Brigg were a rural Pennsylvania folk-tinged psychedelic band formed by three high school friends: Rob Morse, Jeff Willoughby, and Rusty Foulke. In 1973, they borrowed the money to record their first album together. They called it Brigg after one member saw the name in a dream. It was recorded at a grocery store converted into a 4-track studio. The photos for the cover were taken in a purportedly haunted house in Danville. The band members pressed 1000 copies and sold some to their friends but never played a live show together. They divided the remaining copies between them and went their separate ways. Several decades later, the Brigg album became a collector&#039;s item and was bootlegged all over the world.

Original artwork. Includes one-sided insert with liner notes.  One of the holy grails of American psychedelic rock and the rarest album originally released by the collectable Metromedia label. Christopher were an underground acid rock trio featuring future Josefus drummer Doug Tull. They evolved from United Gas, a psychedelic band from Houston who rubbed shoulders with legends like The 13th Floor Elevators and Moving Sidewalks. After relocating to Los Angeles - where they changed their name to Christopher - they played at numerous biker parties and recorded their sole album in 1970 for the Metromedia label. It&#039;s an amazing example of West Coast psychedelia/acid-rock featuring strong fuzz-wah guitar, great compositions and superb musicianship. It was housed in a terrific cover depicting the band at the same hippie crash-pad where some scenes from the &#039;The Trip&#039; movie were filmed. Repress in hard cardboard sleeve with obi and insert with liner notes. Remastered.  LP  $19 SKU:24219DOMINIQUE BLANC FRANCARD -AILLEURS- (Trippy weird Floyd meets T REX)Label:LION  Dominique Blanc-Francard’s “Ailleurs” is trippy and weird... and yet… the songs are catchy and the album rocks out. Fuzzy guitar, chunky drums, weird effects, a thick mix of layers of sound — all tasty ingredients. Pink Floyd meets T-Rex? It’s a terrific recipe, which surely must describe other albums? Even so, we can’t think of another album that sounds quite like “Ailleurs.” •Eight page insert booklet includes an interview of Dominique Blanc-Francard by Jean-Emmanuel Deluxe, in French and English LP  $15 SKU:24345HONEST JOHN - SAILOR (Unreleased underground Texas hard rock from 1975)-Label:SHROOMANGEL (USA) Unreleased underground Texas hard rock from 1975! First release anywhere, anytime! Heavy grooves with dense, layered guitars and Deep Purple/Black Sabbath style vocals from bassist T.J. Sanders. Honest John was a band that meant business at a time when most bands were softening their sound for radio. Not these guys! Honest John did release an extremely rare 7&quot; on the Baron label (BRN45006): slinky track &#039;Brighter Day&#039; b/w the chunky and hard driving  &#039;Face the Crowd&#039;); but that was all that ever emerged from the sessions until now. It was in fact all the world knew of Honest John, aside from folks blown away by hearing them on tour in Texas playing frat parties, bars, military bases, and sleazy rock clubs in the early 1970&#039;s. Honest John&#039;s &quot;Sailor&quot; is a living, breathing tribute to Ottis Coleman, who should have long ago been celebrated as a true Texas guitar great. Features Coleman&#039;s stellar guitar and engineered by future Mojave Audio honcho and key figure in 1970&#039;s rock in Houston, Dusty Wakeman. Coleman and Wakeman both later joined Houston blues rockers Buzz Bone, which featured Dan Mitchell and Tom Moore post-Moving Sidewalks. But it has always been the Honest John sessions that they longed to have released., at long long last.

What makes this album different is there is a mix of country covers by the Gosdin Brothers and Patty Smith to a new original song that sounds very Raspberry-esque (Nobody Told You) to acoustic renditions of some of Hopkins&#039; older songs like Paraguay and Dark Side of the Spoon. This album captures the band in a new light.

Side A contains 5 pleasant xian folk-rock ballads, with beautiful female vocals and excellent flute and keyboards work, reminiscent of early 70&#039;s UK bands. Side B seems to be different enough, containing three extended rock (you could even call them heavy rock) tracks with female and male vocals as well and lots of fuzzy, distorted guitars, and wild flute leads. 3 tracks of the album are (co-)written by Jim and Vicky Tsapatoris of Last Call Of Shiloh fame.

This record was originally a demo cassette made in 1981 that was hawked around record labels with a view for release. Later Color Tapes released a 100 copies edition. To support their demo at the time the band played such gigs at the Marquee, Rock Garden and The Bridgehouse supporting bands such as Fad Gadget, Modern English and Henry Padovani (Ex-Police) in London. This sublime minimal basement krauty synth LP was inspired by bands such as Neu, Amon Duul ll, and &quot;Vienna&quot; period Ultravox. The album features guitar work of Gerald O&#039; Connell who was a big fan of Ash Ra Tempel&#039;s guitarist Manuel Gottsching. A year later he went on to form Lives Of Angels who made the classic cold wave album &quot;Elevator To Eden&quot; which was originally released on Color Tapes in 1983. Mystery Plane have been featured on the sold out Cold Waves Of Color compilation series. The album has been remastered by Denis Blackham and comes complete with a poster insert.

Because anybody who gets in touch with Mick Collins and can cough up a small fee for studio time can release a Dirtbombs single, some of the Dirtbombs’ very best tracks have seen the light of day only on seven inches pressed in small quantities (often released in foreign countries) that go out of print almost immediately. Hell, some singles were given to labels that never actually released the damn things. This 52-song double-CD collects Dirtbombs singles sides and comp tracks - including eight brand new songs and several previously unreleased older recordings, all re-mastered. A handsome 24-page booklet of photos and notes by the band augments this massive package.

The sound is filled out by Green On Red and Dream Syndicate keyboardist Chris Cacavas (who appeared on the 1984 Chris D. / Divine Horsemen album Time Stands Still) and classically trained violinist Elizabeth Wilson.

GREG SHAW  CD  $15 SKU:27016FLOWERZ-FLYTE 1967-1968 Garage Rock From Reading PALabel:ARF ARF This CD is proof why Reading, PA&#039;s Flowerz may be one of the coolest &#039;60s combos this planet has ever produced. What sets Flowerz apart from the masses is they&#039;re just so damn good! Fortunately, this body of work recorded by engineer Clay Barclay captures their fired-up raw energy at its peak. Not only do Flowerz blossom with some mighty originals (Flyte, I Need Love Now, Talkin&#039; About Love) but they plow through high-octane covers including plenty of Stones, Animals, Kinks, Byrds plus the rockin&#039; hits of the day. Vocalist Jeff Stout bleeds teen spirit (Mick who&#039;) while the band kicks royal butt, creating a solid 10 on the Richter and Roll scale. (Attention garage-a-holics: No Justice mediocrity here.) Added bonus is priceless on-stage banter by local WXAC emcees during Flowerz performance on February 18th, 1968 at the Albright College Field House. All 22 tracks are actual studio recordings which were piped through the gymnasium&#039;s PA system while the band that night performed [mostly] in sync with the pre-recorded tape--thus creating twice the energy! A truly amazing historical document wrapped in a groovy 16-page fact-filled booklet.Flowerz rule!

Spencer Gets It Lit is classic Jon Spencer taken to the extreme—electro-boogie, constructivist art pop, and a psychedelic swamp of industrial sleaze and futurist elegance. It is an epic master work of freak beat from the world’s weirdest garage. Across brain-boggling layers of fury, fuzz guitar, and a crash-bang battery of phaser blasts, photon torpedoes, and otherworldly zounds, he frantically spits, croons, rhapsodizes, and seduces. Spencer Gets It Lit is his most complex and groovy record in years, a dark, danceable odyssey—both a studied take-down of the early 21st century, and a celebration of the place where electricity meets the mind.  \r\nThirteen wicked hot songs of love, loss, lust, life—from the Farfisa-fueled, warped psycho-punk rave-up of “Junk Man,” to the intimate lover’s plea of “My Hit Parade,” to the outer-space, end-of-days country funk of “Worm Town,” Spencer Gets It Lit delivers all of the friction, excitement, and post-modern depravity one could ever ask for! \r\nSays Spencer, “Send out the Hit Signal! This is the most uncompromising album I’ve ever made!” CD  $10 SKU:26850LAZY SMOKE -  Corridor Of Faces  ( legendary 68 psych BEATLES STYLE ) - Label:ARF ARF  Like the Velvet Underground and Big Star, Lazy Smoke has become more famous in death than life. Basically a local phenomenon during its existence, the Massachusetts band&#039;s Corridor of Faces LP has become one of the most revered collectables among &#039;60s enthusiasts. Included on this CD are 12 previously unheard demos produced a few months prior to the recording of the album. All music has been transferred from the original mastertapes. Informative 16-page booklet includes the band history plus rare photos. CD  $10 SKU:27017LEGENDS, THE- High Towers DBL CD   ( 60&#039;s psych ) - Label:ARF ARF  Featuring their four locally released singles and a promotional-onlyflexi from 1970, the first CD documents the Legends from 1967 to 1973, their most renowned era. But the listening pleasure doesn&#039;t end with rare 45 sides like the stompin&#039; freakbeat cover of &quot;Baby Get Your Head Screwed On&quot; from &#039;67 and the quirky wah-wah piano of &quot;High Towers&quot; from &#039;69. CD number one is rounded out by a bevy of previously unreleased material, including seven more power-trio psych-outs from 1969, three pounding hard rockers from 1973 that should have the stoner rock crowd in air-guitar heaven, and even a CD-ROM of a video made by band ally Jerry King Musser in 1972 to promote &quot;Rock and Roll Woman,&quot; a regional smash (later licensed to Epic Records) that almost got the Legends on American Bandstand. Some people know &#039;em as the spawning ground for Dan Hartman of Edgar Winter Free Ride/I Can Dream About You fame. Other people know &#039;em for their four excellent singles. But until you&#039;ve heard Arf! Arf! Records&#039; new double-CD High Towers compilation retrospective, you haven&#039;t gotten the full perspective on the Legends. From &#039;64 to &#039;73, the Legends were as synonymous with Central Pennsylvania as a Hershey Bar with almonds, and every bit as tasty. They got the audiences dancing with their mix of pop, rock and soul in the mid-&#039;60s, freaked &#039;em out with heavy psychedelia in the late &#039;60s, then rocked &#039;em back outta their shells with even harder rock in the early &#039;70s. All phases are documented on High Towers, which traces the rise of the Legends from their garage band roots playing teen hops and fire halls into seasoned rockers blowing the doors off larger venues. Featuring their four locally released singles and a promotional-only flexi from 1970, the first CD documents the Legends from 1967 to 1973, their most renowned era. But the listening pleasure doesn&#039;t end with rare 45 sides like the stompin&#039; freakbeat cover of Baby Get Your Head Screwed On from &#039;67 and the quirky wah-wah piano of High Towers from &#039;69. CD number one is rounded out by a bevy of previously unreleased material, including seven more power-trio psych-outs from 1969, three pounding hard rockers from 1973 that should have the stoner rock crowd in air-guitar heaven, and even a CD-ROM of a video made by band ally Jerry King Musser in 1972 to promote Rock and Roll Woman, a regional smash (later licensed to Epic Records) that almost got the Legends on American Bandstand. And then there&#039;s the second CD, which throws a life preserver to those &#039;60s fanatics who abandon ship when the captain&#039;s into psychedelia or hard rock. Fear not, garage fiends, as CD number two completes the Legends&#039; voyage with 26 previously unissued cuts from 1965 and 1966, including a few band originals and teen-fueled renditions of Shakin&#039; All Over, You Really Got Me I Need You, Don&#039;t Bring Me Down and even the Shadows of Knight&#039;s fuzz ripper, I&#039;m Gonna Make You Mine. Perhaps the coolest garage vault find of all, however, is a pair of cuts by the Donshires (featuring future Legend Joe Caloiero) from 1965, Sad and Blue and Tripeline, which would be lighting up eBay if the songs had ever been pressed on a single. The musical experience is only enhanced by a 24-page booklet lined with pictures, memorabilia and a detailed band history (including interviews with six former members) by Doug Sheppard of Discoveries/Ugly Things. Whether you&#039;re into garage, psych, hard rock or even Dan Hartman himself, High Towers is guaranteed to scale the rock and roll heights for you. CD  $14 SKU:27010LIGHTNING - 1968-1971 (Mpls 60s garage LEGENDS)Label:ARF ARF Lightning was an offshoot of Minneapolis &#039;60s legends Litter that featured guitar wizard Tom &#039;Zippy&#039; Caplan. After recording the Litter&#039;s 1966 garage classic Distortions and 1968 psych masterpiece $100 Fine, Caplan split from the Litter and formed Lightning. The band started out as a power trio and cut one fierce Cream-inspired single &#039;William&#039; b/w &#039;Of Paupers And Poets&#039; in 1968 under the White Lightning moniker with Twin Cities record producer Warren Kendrick. The band regrouped into a quintet and scored a record deal with P.I.P. which issued their eight-song album. That album has since become a highly collectable LP. Lightning became one of the Midwest&#039;s hardest working rock acts and toured extensively throughout the region during their three-year tenure. This authorized CD reissue includes their entire LP, the aforementioned 45, plus six additional bonus tracks (including edited 45 mixes of two album tracks) all wrapped in an archival 12-page booklet with lots of photos and liner notes by Litter-scribe Doug Sheppard. Between this package and Arf Arf&#039;s White Lightning Strikes Twice [1968-1969] release, the band&#039;s entire musical legacy has been properly archived. Fans of Blue Cheer, Cream, Hendrix, and Arf Arf&#039;s four psychedelic Dose comps will really dig this new disc CD  $10 SKU:12952LITTER-   $100 Fine  (60&#039;s garage psych classic) -Label:ARF ARF  1968 classic garage lp w/ unre demos. 20 page booklet  The 1968 follow up to their stunning debut, Distortions, finds the Litter heading into psychedelic territory with a stunning remake of &#039;Kaleidoscope&#039; as well as their first original songs on record.

From a cache of moody ballads tohighly-charged, all-out flashing teen rock, everything here is broodingly and sensationally played out, including highly-personalised covers of Love’s ‘Message To Pretty’, ‘In The Midnight Hour’ and The Remains’ gold-plated nugget ‘Don’t Look Back’. The album’s mix of deep beat-pop introspection and thoroughly intense modern R&amp;amp;B-instigated rock remains unique among most of their peers’long-play outings, and thus played a big part in the inordinately strong pull the group would have on many young ’60s-fixated longhairs in the ’80s and ’90s.” - Shindig Magazine.

CD  $10 SKU:23477WOLFMANHATTAN PROJECT -  Summer Forever and Ever DIRTBOMBS /GUN CLUB/CRAMPS MEMBERS-Label:IN THE RED  Summer Forever And Ever succeeds Blue Gene Stew, 2019’s debut by the Wolfmanhattan Project, a collective unit co-starring three musicians familiar to In The Red listeners: singer-guitarist Mick Collins, front man of the seminal Detroit-bred garage units the Dirtbombs and the Gories, singer-guitarist Kid Congo Powers who played in such legendary bands as the Gun Club, the Cramps, and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, and drummer-vocalist Bob Bert, whose skin work has distinguished albums by Sonic Youth, Pussy Galore, Lydia Lunch’s Retrovirus, and Jon Spencer and the HITmakers. The group was founded as a studio project by three musicians who are kept busy by their primary bands. Blue Gene Stew was written and recorded quickly. Powers says, “I think that the new record was much more a group effort. I think there’s more of a group kind of sound, as eclectic as it is. I feel like we all played together, as opposed to playing on each other’s songs.” Bert notes that the band’s music is grounded in spontaneity: “Me and Mick went in and had a couple of rehearsals, and I would come up with a beat, he would come up with a riff. I still have a cassette Walkman, believe it or not, and we’d put it down on that. It wasn’t even a full song. We’d just put down a bunch of ideas. When it came to recording we’d lay down the basic tracks and work out different things, and a lot of it was made up on the spot. It really is a great collaboration.” Recorded and engineered by Mark C. of Live Skull at his studio, Summer Forever And Ever finds Powers playing piano and the Kaoss touch-pad effects unit and Collins playing synthesizer, in addition to their usual instruments. The album reflects the same eclectic mix of musical styles heard on the debut. References and sometimes even direct quotes from sources as diverse as the Andrea True Connection, Captain Beefheart, the Count Five, and Eurythmics leap out of the speakers. CD  $10 SKU:26847ARF!

The good people who put together this compilation set out to accomplish no less daunting a task than collecting the most bizarre and extreme underground psychedelic music recorded in the 1960&#039;s, and, for the most part, the choices seem to be right on the money. The collection starts off with &quot;The Trip&quot; by Park Avenue Playground, a song that bursts out of the gate with an explosion of fuzz guitar, organ, and mad siren-like oscillating effects, coming at you from all directions, seemingly. Next up is &quot;Suzie&#039;s gone&quot; by Afterglow, definitely one of the weirdest singles ever. The singer moans &quot;so...my...world...is...messed...up!&quot; in the most detached voice possible over a staccato organ and drum part, leading to a guitar solo that soon collapses into no recognizable conventional song structure. No less amazing is &quot;Mt. Olympus&quot; by The Flower Power, which starts off as an innocuous and somewhat introspective sounding piece until a wild heavily chorused guitar break, which only slightly warns you of the totally anarchic feedback and free-form noise ending -- which goes on for over a minute in a 3:40 single! Then you get a bizarre sci-fi/horror tale in &quot;The pulse&quot; by Burritt Bradley, and an incredible reading of The Electric Prunes&#039; &quot;I had too much to dream last night&quot; by Rasputin and the Mad Monks, with weird proto-techno sound effects, backwards vocals, and production effects making the backing track fade in and out, creating a disturbing sensory assault. Other highlights include &quot;An experiment in terror&quot; by The Greek Fountains, which is a strange polyrhythmic instrumental, and &quot;Up in my mind&quot; by The Spontaneous Generation, which surely has to rank as one of the most aggressive 60&#039;s psych records ever made, with waves of vibrato guitar and insistent wah wah riffing. Also worthwhile is &quot;The electronic insides and metal complexion that make up Herr Dr. Krieg,&quot; by The Riders of the Mark, which musically isn&#039;t quite as strange as its title, but comes close! The weirdness factor decreases somewhat as the c.d. progresses, and a sloppy but straightforward cover of &quot;In a gadda da vida&quot; by Six Feet Under makes for a pretty uninteresting closer, but the good material here makes this an essential purchase. Buy it if you like psychedelia, experimental or Incredibly Strange Music.

All 32 tracks on Eastern PA Rock--Part One were recorded in his &quot;Mr Wizard&quot; approved recording studio (also doubling as his parents&#039; living room and basement) centrally located in Orwigsburg. Later he teamed up with established music industry types and relocated his facility to Reading, where he experienced a second wind of activity which has been resurrected on Part Two [1966-&#039;69] of this reissue series. COMP CD $12 SKU:23198EASTERN PA  ROCK -  BARCLAY STORY PART 2 - 66-69   ( 60s garage ) -Label:ARF ARF   This 30-song collection documents highlights of the rock recordings produced by engineer/entrepreneur Clay Barclay circa 1966-&#039;69. Originally based in his parents&#039; Orwigsburg, PA home and later relocating to Reading, Barclay&#039;s facilities captured the top regional acts, producing over two dozen highly-coveted 7-inch singles.Included in this retrospective is a 40-page booklet bursting with photos, memorabilia and extensive band bios. Both collections are highly recommended for fans of &#039;60s garage, punk, and 100% pure pre-Woodstock era muscular rock.Part Two opens up with the Starlites apocalyptic &quot;I Can&#039;t See You,&quot; a snarling 5-star punker if there ever was one.

COMP CD $10 SKU:27013GARAGEAHOLIC - VA Psychedelic! Outsider Music!-Label:ARF ARF  Obscure sixties garage punk and psychedelic rock may be the imprint’s main thrust, but every so often they wander outside such territories and release music that is just plain weird. For those not hip to the Arf! Arf! label, this thirty- track sampler serves as a fine overview of what they’re all about. And for those who have been supporting the record company’s cause all these years, you’re still in for a treat, as how nice it is to have such groovy tunes situated in one place. From the spit and swagger of “I Can’t See You” by The Starlites to the absolutely stupid yet utterly charming “Stinky Poodle” by Tangela Tricoli, here’s a disc that offers something for everybody. On the instrumental front, there’s the acid damaged delight of &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; from Peter Pan and The Good Fairies and Erik Lindgren’s totally gorgeous version of The Edgar Winter Group’s &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; which takes classical muzak to new and improved heights. Erik further shares his talents on “Route 28-American Kids Still Wanna Rock,” a super catchy pop rocker where his inner Rick Springfield meets Bryan Adams is revealed. Charted of shuffling rhythms, The Rising Storm’s “Love Starvation” pays loving homage to Bo Diddley, “Flyte” by The Flowerz pairs social oriented prose with the bracing bite of The Rolling Stones and The Standells, The Legends unveil a dosage of wah-wah battered guitar reflexes on “High Towers” and Changin’ Tymes travel a heavy duty psychedelic route on “Blue Music Box.” A strong Jefferson Airplane influence arises on the rebellious tones of 6 Feet Under’s “Inspiration In My Head,” The Victors turn in a loyal cover of Them’s “Little Girl” and The Litter quake and shake on “Mindbreaker.” Stacked from top to bottom with enjoyable sounds, “Garageaholic! Psychedelic! Outsider Music!” is the best greatest hits album that never was.

Expected to be a series, no additional installments ever appeared, which leads me to believe there were simply no funds to keep the project going. Perhaps the record label’s money all went up in smoke - pun purposely intended!\r\n\r\nMarked of mouth-watering bubblegum ingredients, it’s no surprise Ron Dante, whose merry pipes inhabit sugar-coated ear candy by the likes of the Archies and the Cufflinks, is the vibrant vocalist behind the Two Dollar Question’s hook-happy “Aunt Matilda‘s Double Yummy Blow Your Mind Out Brownies,” and then there’s The World’s hilarious “Pot Party,” which should actually be called “LSD Party,” as it consists of a gaggle of people laughing themselves silly while a bluesy surf rock band noodles away in the background.

Side one is a neo classical prog rock epic in the style of Renaissance and Continuum, inspired by the wild and pagan isles of St Kilda where, as a 16 yr old, the composer Peter McKerrow was taken by military launch to conduct a census on the rare Soay Sheep that live there. A storm blew away his tent on the first night. The other side is by his Canadian pal who attended the same Uni in england, deeply homesick for Canada and surviving a broken relationship these songs are melancholic and Leonard Cohen-esque.

Official limited edition vinyl from the original masters, featuring incredible late 60s/early 70’s anarchistic acid/psych rock tracks with fuzz, organs and all around great vibe. After the split of Las Antorchas, Victor Motta Aviles and band mate Omar Cortes Gaviño teamed up with Victor's brother Guillermo and continued as Antorcha. Along with Náhuatl and Toncho Pilatos, Antorcha were one of the few groups in Mexico that managed to break the influences of foreign bands—and government oppression—and find their own (demented) sound. In fact, Antorcha set out to cerate an anarchist awareness among young people in the era; they understood anarchy as “respect to youth, the right to free-thinking, and breaking political and religious taboos.” And the music—acid psychedelic rock, with intelligent use of fuzz guitar and a strong rhythm section. Greats stuff from start to finish—all originals—that we can easily rate as some of the best psych rock ever made in Mexico! This LP has all of the band’s EP and single tracks, plus one from their only album, which came out at the end of their career.

SAALE Label:GUERSSEN First ever legit vinyl reissue, sanctioned by the band members, of this collectable psych/folk/hard-rock album from 1973. Brigg were a rural Pennsylvania folk-tinged psychedelic band formed by three high school friends: Rob Morse, Jeff Willoughby, and Rusty Foulke. In 1973, they borrowed the money to record their first album together. They called it Brigg after one member saw the name in a dream. It was recorded at a grocery store converted into a 4-track studio. The photos for the cover were taken in a purportedly haunted house in Danville. The band members pressed 1000 copies and sold some to their friends but never played a live show together. They divided the remaining copies between them and went their separate ways. Several decades later, the Brigg album became a collector's item and was bootlegged all over the world.

After relocating to Los Angeles - where they changed their name to Christopher - they played at numerous biker parties and recorded their sole album in 1970 for the Metromedia label. It's an amazing example of West Coast psychedelia/acid-rock featuring strong fuzz-wah guitar, great compositions and superb musicianship.

First release anywhere, anytime! Heavy grooves with dense, layered guitars and Deep Purple/Black Sabbath style vocals from bassist T.J. Sanders. Honest John was a band that meant business at a time when most bands were softening their sound for radio. Not these guys! Honest John did release an extremely rare 7\" on the Baron label (BRN45006): slinky track 'Brighter Day' b/w the chunky and hard driving 'Face the Crowd'); but that was all that ever emerged from the sessions until now. It was in fact all the world knew of Honest John, aside from folks blown away by hearing them on tour in Texas playing frat parties, bars, military bases, and sleazy rock clubs in the early 1970's. Honest John's \"Sailor\" is a living, breathing tribute to Ottis Coleman, who should have long ago been celebrated as a true Texas guitar great. Features Coleman's stellar guitar and engineered by future Mojave Audio honcho and key figure in 1970's rock in Houston, Dusty Wakeman. Coleman and Wakeman both later joined Houston blues rockers Buzz Bone, which featured Dan Mitchell and Tom Moore post-Moving Sidewalks. But it has always been the Honest John sessions that they longed to have released., at long long last.

What makes this album different is there is a mix of country covers by the Gosdin Brothers and Patty Smith to a new original song that sounds very Raspberry-esque (Nobody Told You) to acoustic renditions of some of Hopkins' older songs like Paraguay and Dark Side of the Spoon.

Side A contains 5 pleasant xian folk-rock ballads, with beautiful female vocals and excellent flute and keyboards work, reminiscent of early 70's UK bands. Side B seems to be different enough, containing three extended rock (you could even call them heavy rock) tracks with female and male vocals as well and lots of fuzzy, distorted guitars, and wild flute leads. 3 tracks of the album are (co-)written by Jim and Vicky Tsapatoris of Last Call Of Shiloh fame.

Hell, some singles were given to labels that never actually released the damn things.

What sets Flowerz apart from the masses is they're just so damn good! Fortunately, this body of work recorded by engineer Clay Barclay captures their fired-up raw energy at its peak. Not only do Flowerz blossom with some mighty originals (Flyte, I Need Love Now, Talkin' About Love) but they plow through high-octane covers including plenty of Stones, Animals, Kinks, Byrds plus the rockin' hits of the day. Vocalist Jeff Stout bleeds teen spirit (Mick who') while the band kicks royal butt, creating a solid 10 on the Richter and Roll scale. (Attention garage-a-holics: No Justice mediocrity here.) Added bonus is priceless on-stage banter by local WXAC emcees during Flowerz performance on February 18th, 1968 at the Albright College Field House. All 22 tracks are actual studio recordings which were piped through the gymnasium's PA system while the band that night performed [mostly] in sync with the pre-recorded tape--thus creating twice the energy!

Spencer Gets It Lit is classic Jon Spencer taken to the extreme—electro-boogie, constructivist art pop, and a psychedelic swamp of industrial sleaze and futurist elegance. It is an epic master work of freak beat from the world’s weirdest garage. Across brain-boggling layers of fury, fuzz guitar, and a crash-bang battery of phaser blasts, photon torpedoes, and otherworldly zounds, he frantically spits, croons, rhapsodizes, and seduces. Spencer Gets It Lit is his most complex and groovy record in years, a dark, danceable odyssey—both a studied take-down of the early 21st century, and a celebration of the place where electricity meets the mind.\n\nThirteen wicked hot songs of love, loss, lust, life—from the Farfisa-fueled, warped psycho-punk rave-up of “Junk Man,” to the intimate lover’s plea of “My Hit Parade,” to the outer-space, end-of-days country funk of “Worm Town,” Spencer Gets It Lit delivers all of the friction, excitement, and post-modern depravity one could ever ask for!\n\nSays Spencer, “Send out the Hit Signal!

Basically a local phenomenon during its existence, the Massachusetts band's Corridor of Faces LP has become one of the most revered collectables among '60s enthusiasts. Included on this CD are 12 previously unheard demos produced a few months prior to the recording of the album. All music has been transferred from the original mastertapes. Informative 16-page booklet includes the band history plus rare photos.

But the listening pleasure doesn't end with rare 45 sides like the stompin' freakbeat cover of \"Baby Get Your Head Screwed On\" from '67 and the quirky wah-wah piano of \"High Towers\" from '69. CD number one is rounded out by a bevy of previously unreleased material, including seven more power-trio psych-outs from 1969, three pounding hard rockers from 1973 that should have the stoner rock crowd in air-guitar heaven, and even a CD-ROM of a video made by band ally Jerry King Musser in 1972 to promote \"Rock and Roll Woman,\" a regional smash (later licensed to Epic Records) that almost got the Legends on American Bandstand. Some people know 'em as the spawning ground for Dan Hartman of Edgar Winter Free Ride/I Can Dream About You fame. Other people know 'em for their four excellent singles. But until you've heard Arf! Arf! Records' new double-CD High Towers compilation retrospective, you haven't gotten the full perspective on the Legends. From '64 to '73, the Legends were as synonymous with Central Pennsylvania as a Hershey Bar with almonds, and every bit as tasty. They got the audiences dancing with their mix of pop, rock and soul in the mid-'60s, freaked 'em out with heavy psychedelia in the late '60s, then rocked 'em back outta their shells with even harder rock in the early '70s. All phases are documented on High Towers, which traces the rise of the Legends from their garage band roots playing teen hops and fire halls into seasoned rockers blowing the doors off larger venues. Featuring their four locally released singles and a promotional-only flexi from 1970, the first CD documents the Legends from 1967 to 1973, their most renowned era. But the listening pleasure doesn't end with rare 45 sides like the stompin' freakbeat cover of Baby Get Your Head Screwed On from '67 and the quirky wah-wah piano of High Towers from '69. CD number one is rounded out by a bevy of previously unreleased material, including seven more power-trio psych-outs from 1969, three pounding hard rockers from 1973 that should have the stoner rock crowd in air-guitar heaven, and even a CD-ROM of a video made by band ally Jerry King Musser in 1972 to promote Rock and Roll Woman, a regional smash (later licensed to Epic Records) that almost got the Legends on American Bandstand. And then there's the second CD, which throws a life preserver to those '60s fanatics who abandon ship when the captain's into psychedelia or hard rock. Fear not, garage fiends, as CD number two completes the Legends' voyage with 26 previously unissued cuts from 1965 and 1966, including a few band originals and teen-fueled renditions of Shakin' All Over, You Really Got Me I Need You, Don't Bring Me Down and even the Shadows of Knight's fuzz ripper, I'm Gonna Make You Mine. Perhaps the coolest garage vault find of all, however, is a pair of cuts by the Donshires (featuring future Legend Joe Caloiero) from 1965, Sad and Blue and Tripeline, which would be lighting up eBay if the songs had ever been pressed on a single. The musical experience is only enhanced by a 24-page booklet lined with pictures, memorabilia and a detailed band history (including interviews with six former members) by Doug Sheppard of Discoveries/Ugly Things. Whether you're into garage, psych, hard rock or even Dan Hartman himself, High Towers is guaranteed to scale the rock and roll heights for you.

After recording the Litter's 1966 garage classic Distortions and 1968 psych masterpiece $100 Fine, Caplan split from the Litter and formed Lightning. The band started out as a power trio and cut one fierce Cream-inspired single 'William' b/w 'Of Paupers And Poets' in 1968 under the White Lightning moniker with Twin Cities record producer Warren Kendrick. The band regrouped into a quintet and scored a record deal with P.I.P. which issued their eight-song album. That album has since become a highly collectable LP. Lightning became one of the Midwest's hardest working rock acts and toured extensively throughout the region during their three-year tenure.

From a cache of moody ballads tohighly-charged, all-out flashing teen rock, everything here is broodingly and sensationally played out, including highly-personalised covers of Love’s ‘Message To Pretty’, ‘In The Midnight Hour’ and The Remains’ gold-plated nugget ‘Don’t Look Back’. The album’s mix of deep beat-pop introspection and thoroughly intense modern R&B-instigated rock remains unique among most of their peers’long-play outings, and thus played a big part in the inordinately strong pull the group would have on many young ’60s-fixated longhairs in the ’80s and ’90s.” - Shindig Magazine.

The group was founded as a studio project by three musicians who are kept busy by their primary bands. Blue Gene Stew was written and recorded quickly. Powers says, “I think that the new record was much more a group effort. I think there’s more of a group kind of sound, as eclectic as it is. I feel like we all played together, as opposed to playing on each other’s songs.” Bert notes that the band’s music is grounded in spontaneity: “Me and Mick went in and had a couple of rehearsals, and I would come up with a beat, he would come up with a riff. I still have a cassette Walkman, believe it or not, and we’d put it down on that. It wasn’t even a full song. We’d just put down a bunch of ideas. When it came to recording we’d lay down the basic tracks and work out different things, and a lot of it was made up on the spot. It really is a great collaboration.” Recorded and engineered by Mark C. of Live Skull at his studio, Summer Forever And Ever finds Powers playing piano and the Kaoss touch-pad effects unit and Collins playing synthesizer, in addition to their usual instruments. The album reflects the same eclectic mix of musical styles heard on the debut. References and sometimes even direct quotes from sources as diverse as the Andrea True Connection, Captain Beefheart, the Count Five, and Eurythmics leap out of the speakers. CD $10 SKU:26847\n\nARF!

The good people who put together this compilation set out to accomplish no less daunting a task than collecting the most bizarre and extreme underground psychedelic music recorded in the 1960's, and, for the most part, the choices seem to be right on the money. The collection starts off with \"The Trip\" by Park Avenue Playground, a song that bursts out of the gate with an explosion of fuzz guitar, organ, and mad siren-like oscillating effects, coming at you from all directions, seemingly. Next up is \"Suzie's gone\" by Afterglow, definitely one of the weirdest singles ever. The singer moans \"so...my...world...is...messed...up!\" in the most detached voice possible over a staccato organ and drum part, leading to a guitar solo that soon collapses into no recognizable conventional song structure. No less amazing is \"Mt. Olympus\" by The Flower Power, which starts off as an innocuous and somewhat introspective sounding piece until a wild heavily chorused guitar break, which only slightly warns you of the totally anarchic feedback and free-form noise ending -- which goes on for over a minute in a 3:40 single! Then you get a bizarre sci-fi/horror tale in \"The pulse\" by Burritt Bradley, and an incredible reading of The Electric Prunes' \"I had too much to dream last night\" by Rasputin and the Mad Monks, with weird proto-techno sound effects, backwards vocals, and production effects making the backing track fade in and out, creating a disturbing sensory assault. Other highlights include \"An experiment in terror\" by The Greek Fountains, which is a strange polyrhythmic instrumental, and \"Up in my mind\" by The Spontaneous Generation, which surely has to rank as one of the most aggressive 60's psych records ever made, with waves of vibrato guitar and insistent wah wah riffing. Also worthwhile is \"The electronic insides and metal complexion that make up Herr Dr. Krieg,\" by The Riders of the Mark, which musically isn't quite as strange as its title, but comes close! The weirdness factor decreases somewhat as the c.d. progresses, and a sloppy but straightforward cover of \"In a gadda da vida\" by Six Feet Under makes for a pretty uninteresting closer, but the good material here makes this an essential purchase. Buy it if you like psychedelia, experimental or Incredibly Strange Music.

All 32 tracks on Eastern PA Rock--Part One were recorded in his \"Mr Wizard\" approved recording studio (also doubling as his parents' living room and basement) centrally located in Orwigsburg. Later he teamed up with established music industry types and relocated his facility to Reading, where he experienced a second wind of activity which has been resurrected on Part Two [1966-'69] of this reissue series.

Outsider Music!-Label:ARF ARF Obscure sixties garage punk and psychedelic rock may be the imprint’s main thrust, but every so often they wander outside such territories and release music that is just plain weird. For those not hip to the Arf! Arf! label, this thirty- track sampler serves as a fine overview of what they’re all about. And for those who have been supporting the record company’s cause all these years, you’re still in for a treat, as how nice it is to have such groovy tunes situated in one place. From the spit and swagger of “I Can’t See You” by The Starlites to the absolutely stupid yet utterly charming “Stinky Poodle” by Tangela Tricoli, here’s a disc that offers something for everybody. On the instrumental front, there’s the acid damaged delight of \"Kaleidoscope\" from Peter Pan and The Good Fairies and Erik Lindgren’s totally gorgeous version of The Edgar Winter Group’s \"Frankenstein,\" which takes classical muzak to new and improved heights. Erik further shares his talents on “Route 28-American Kids Still Wanna Rock,” a super catchy pop rocker where his inner Rick Springfield meets Bryan Adams is revealed. Charted of shuffling rhythms, The Rising Storm’s “Love Starvation” pays loving homage to Bo Diddley, “Flyte” by The Flowerz pairs social oriented prose with the bracing bite of The Rolling Stones and The Standells, The Legends unveil a dosage of wah-wah battered guitar reflexes on “High Towers” and Changin’ Tymes travel a heavy duty psychedelic route on “Blue Music Box.” A strong Jefferson Airplane influence arises on the rebellious tones of 6 Feet Under’s “Inspiration In My Head,” The Victors turn in a loyal cover of Them’s “Little Girl” and The Litter quake and shake on “Mindbreaker.” Stacked from top to bottom with enjoyable sounds, “Garageaholic! Psychedelic! Outsider Music!” is the best greatest hits album that never was.

Subject aside, which is not nearly as shocking or rebellious as it was when these tracks were conceived, this is a really great collection of songs as it examines an array of musical moods and measures. Expected to be a series, no additional installments ever appeared, which leads me to believe there were simply no funds to keep the project going. Perhaps the record label’s money all went up in smoke - pun purposely intended!\n\nMarked of mouth-watering bubblegum ingredients, it’s no surprise Ron Dante, whose merry pipes inhabit sugar-coated ear candy by the likes of the Archies and the Cufflinks, is the vibrant vocalist behind the Two Dollar Question’s hook-happy “Aunt Matilda‘s Double Yummy Blow Your Mind Out Brownies,” and then there’s The World’s hilarious “Pot Party,” which should actually be called “LSD Party,” as it consists of a gaggle of people laughing themselves silly while a bluesy surf rock band noodles away in the background.
