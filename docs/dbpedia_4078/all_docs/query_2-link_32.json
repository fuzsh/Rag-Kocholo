Recorded at the legendary Boston Tea Party in 1969, The Remains rip through an absolute killer of a set list, featuring road tested covers of “Hang On Sloopy,” “Johnny B.

Ten Years After's self-titled debut hit the British blues scene with the subtlety and precision of a wrecking ball in 1967, serving notice that what had once been confined to steamy haunts in London was now there for the world to hear.

Cut live with...\n\nSoaked with the vibe and essence of New York City in the 1960s and seasoned with a rich variety of styles from breathy, beatnik pop to moody & magnificent jazz, folk and soul, the singles issued by Ranny Sinclair are uniformly brilliant, soft, sexy soundscapes--uncollected on a single album until now! Sinclair attended Juilliard as a dance major, but ultimately landed a singing contract with Columbia Records. Her issued discography features several tracks that were turntable hits of the era or...\n\nSTELLAR GOOD VIBRATIONS FROM THE INVENTOR OF THE ELECTRO-THEREMIN! Light years ahead of its time, the eerie sound, colorful orchestral blending, and haunting melodies of Music For Heavenly Bodies has become a crate digging classic. America's fascination with space and its mysteries was at a peak during the 1950s, and this astral awareness got the attention of professional musician, Paul Tanner. Tanner, a trombonist, got his start in the original Glenn Miller Orchestra. The theremin first...\n\nA 1965 journey into found sound; this is John Cage. Another seminal volume of indeterminate music, from an icon of experimental sounds. Reissued for the first time and thematically on gorgeous clear vinyl!

With instrumental backup by the Jeff Beck Group (including Rod Stewart and Ron Wood) on several tracks, as well as an all-star cast that includes Madeline Bell, Aynsley Dunbar, Lesley Duncan, Nicky Hopkins, John Paul Jones, Graham Nash and legendary British...\n\nA time capsule of atomic-age country, radioactive rockabilly, and other-worldly melodies! Sheldon Allman (the singing voice of Mr. Ed!) brings you this long-out-of-print bunker full of plutonium-charged songs about space and destruction. Featuring “Crawl Out Through The Fallout” as heard in the award winning video game Fallout 4! Modern Harmonic proudly resurrects this wonderfully mystifying LP! A true creative treasure, the Chicago born and Canada raised Sheldon Allman was a graduate of...\n\nA private pressing treasure of epic proportions! A gritty rocking record that commands 4 figures if you're lucky enough to find one. \"Like seeing God in a burst condom stuck to the tailpipe of a rusty pimpmobile, finding out Jesus stole your mama, looking for the meaning of life in a puke pile by a truckstop motel - kinda scary how real this dude is! Deep level real people music that sounds like no other LP in the universe. Everything about this sound could not possibly add up in anybody...\n\nBeyond hip! From cool jazz to hard bop. This extraordinary soundtrack, featuring many of the finest jazz musicians this side of anywhere, is a collection of small ensemble and large band arrangements so perfectly indicative of its era. It's beyond hip and runs the gamut from cool jazz to hard bop. Moreover, it authorized the virtuosic freedom of the best of New York's jazz community.

Sun Ra is still trying to get our attention 50 years after dispatching this transmission. Humanity's path since then makes his message even more urgent today.

Sax-man Al Cohn, best known for his work with fellow Lester Young tenor-sax disciple Zoot Sims, has all the pots bubbling on this classic 1956 LP. Five stars in DownBeat? You bet! Al Cohn first sprung on the national scene as one of the saxophonists on the Woody Herman hit \"Four Brothers,\" a crazy arrangement of \"Jeepers Creepers\" featuring each \"brother\" on a wild-and-crazy swingin' sax solo. Along with fellow \"brother\" Zoot Sims, Cohn became...\n\nThe Standells' key albums for the Tower label (Dirty Water, Why Pick On Me, and Try It) perfectly bottled a rebellious wave of sound sweeping across Mid-1960?s teen clubs, radio playlists and record racks. Starting with the genre-defining, proto-punk smash \"Dirty Water,\" through a series of equally memorable underdog anthems (\"Sometimes Good Guys Don't Wear White,\" \"Why Pick on Me\") and obscenities (the banned \"Try It\"), the Standells left an indelible mark on their era.

A seminal example of indeterminate music from an icon on experimental sounds. It could be argued that there is no more controversial figure in music history as avant-garde electronic composer John Cage. Perhaps best known for his composition \"4'33,\"\" which consisted of Cage sitting at a piano for four-plus minutes of total silence, Cage was both loved and loathed in the 60s and 70s as a leading light in avant-garde music and as an...\n\nMono Edition! Captain Beefheart's 1967 debut album Safe As Milk introduced the world to a one-of-a-kind visionary whose unique output had no precedent in contemporary music. Beefheart, aka Don Van Vliet, filtered the raw influence of the blues and R&B through his own singular musical sensibility and left-field lyrical wordplay, and surrounded himself with some of the most talented and inventive young musicians around. The result was an album that, even in the heady year in which it was...\n\nDouble LP on clear vinyl!!If you were going to envision the ultimate avant-garde meeting-of-the-minds jam session, who would you pick? Even the most hopeful fan of strange and innovative music couldn't have seen this one coming: on one afternoon in 1986, at Coney Island's dilapidated freak show, space-age avant-jazz genius Sun Ra met avant-garde \"serious music\" composer John Cage in an unforgettable performance. You couldn't imagine two figures more opposite. Cage was known for his unusual...\n\nVERY LIMITED COPIES!

Sundazed Music is proud to present a genuine psychedelic landmark: Live by Moby Grape, the first official collection of concert recordings by the legendary San Francisco band at its blazing late-Sixties peak. At that time, in rock's hippest city, there was no other band like the original Grape: Jerry Miller, Skip Spence, Bob Mosley, Peter...\n\nHailing from NYC, The Blues Magoos took the folk/blues soundtrack of their mid-sixties Greenwich Village contemporaries and forged it into a tough, garage/psych hybrid that attracted fans as quickly as it angered folk club owners, incensed by the band's volume and unhinged stage show! Signed by Mercury Records in 1966, their inaugural single for the label, a reading of John D. Loudermilk's \"Tobacco Road,\" was a churning 4 1/2 minute(!) plunge into crazed guitar/organ/drum/bass pyrotechnics...\n\nCaution: Positively Electrifying Sounds Within!!! The complete Electric Prunes Reprise-label singles 1966 - 1969!! The original mixes from the master reels! The Electric Prunes perfectly bridged the edgy, fuzz-fueled garage-rock of contemporaries like the Blues Magoos and the Thirteenth Floor Elevators with a diligent, progressive studio craft reminiscent of the Beatles and Beach Boys. And now, we're extremely proud to present a deluxe Sundazed gatefold-edition double-LP set, compiling the...\n\nHow do you top The Litter's godlike '67 longplayer, Distortions? Well, you don't. But leave it to The Litter to deliver the equally essential (not to mention hopelessly rare) '68 follow-up, $100 Fine. From the ultra-explosive album opener, \"Mindbreaker\" (where the Distortions sound now takes on Blue Cheer-like heaviosity) to the LP's epic finale; a nine-minute, ambitiously retooled \"She's Not There,\" $100 Fine ranks as one of its era?s masterpieces. In a tradition established on...\n\nThe Moray Eel Eat The Holy Modal Rounders is another indisputable masterpiece. This exact vinyl repro of their elusive '68 album spotlights the anthemic \"Bird Song,\" a standout in the Easy Rider soundtrack. Track Listing: 1. Bird Song 2. One Will Do For Now 3. Take-off Artist Song 4. Werewolf 5. Interlude6. Dame Fortune 7. Mobile Line 8. The Duji Song 9. My Mind Capsized 10. The STP Song 11. Interlude 2 12. Half A Mind 13.

Though only on Sun from 1955-58, Johnny made some of his most legendary recordings there. When he moved on to Columbia Records, Johnny left behind a large cache of material which Sun happily compiled and released on LPs throughout the 60?s, mixing Cash?s singles-sides with previously unissued recordings.

Filmmaker George Greenough was unencumbered by any commercial reasons for designing boards, boats, or in his wave riding technique, a true SOUL SURFER if there ever was one. With the means, and ideas, to use underwater camera gear that had not been previously used - and still rarely used to such great effect - Greenough's two late '60s cinematic...\n\nA Sundazed deluxe, gatefold double-LP collection of 36 amazing Everly-composed selections, recorded as publishing demos during the Brothers' tenure at Cadence Records. At the peak of their abilities both as performers and writers--most tracks feature only the Everly's voices and guitars. Hear familiar songs like \"Maybe Tomorrow\" and \"When Will I Be Loved\" near their genesis, along with many other strong works in the sweet romantic style in which the brothers specialized. Sundazed is proud to...\n\nLimited Edition Colored Vinyl The late L.A. session guitar genius Jerry Cole has long been worshipped for his work with everyone from the Beach Boys and the Byrds to Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley and by surf fans as the leader of the Spacemen. But unbeknownst to many, Cole was also the driving force behind the Animated Egg, a fictitious band whose lone, self-titled 1967 LP is one of the greatest psychedelic exploitation records ever to hit the budget bins of U.S. chain stores--and eventually...\n\nBy far the most ominous-sounding of the Bay Area's 1960s psychedelic bands, the music of Berkeley's Mad River comes across like a spiraling, acid-spiked descent into hell. With a raw, garagey style marked by Lawrence Hammond's quavering vocals and the interlocking exchanges of guitarists David Robinson and Rick Bockner, Mad River's sound conjures a darker, more menacing version of Quicksilver Messenger Service or early Country Joe and The Fish. No wonder the quintet's self-titled 1968 debut...\n\nGarage fans agree: We The People's raging, tough-as-nails punk tracks \"Mirror of Your Mind\" and \"You Burn Me Up and Down\" rate among the era's best. But believe it or not this band was capable of even more. Along with the above two hammer-down classics, Too Much Noise collates everything the seminal--and surprisingly diverse--Central Florida outfit cut for the Challenge label during the band's mid-'60s heyday, including the raga-rock fave \"In the Past\" (covered by the Chocolate Watchband) and...\n\nStripped down and funky beyond words, 1973's Fresh is quite simply the last great album by Sly & the Family Stone. Funkadelic guru George Clinton, a man who knows something about genre cross-wiring, tabbed Fresh as one of his all-time favorites and convinced the Red Hot Chili Peppers to cut \"If It Were Left Up To Me\" for their 1985 Clinton-produced LP Freaky Styley. Jazz icon Miles Davis reportedly sat his band down to soak up inspiration from multiple playings of Fresh, a work ranked #186 in...\n\nLIMITED EDITION, NUMBERED PRESSING OF 1000! The pounding garage-rock din emanating from the jungles of deepest Connecticut could overwhelm the senses, causing the weary NY commuter to become disoriented! Who knew that the most deranged '66-'68 teenage mayhem imaginable would come from Wallingford's Trod Nossel Studios, whose owner/producer Thomas \"Doc\" Cavalier (a former dentist) recorded top-flight acts as diverse as the tough 'n' melodic Shags (\"Don't Press Your Luck\"), the R&B-consumed...\n\nThe short-lived Viva Records label was one wildly eclectic outfit. Helmed by hitmaker Snuff Garrett, this Los Angeles-based imprint targeted the teen marketplace with a series of extraordinary garage / psych / pop singles. The label’s command of popular styles prevailed across these Top 40 hopefuls, ranging from the stomping beat of the Shindogs to the psych-fuzz nirvana of the Sound Sandwich. And there’s Class of ’66 garage-grunge from the Wailers and the Second Helping (yes, that’s a teenage...\n\nWhat's in a name? In Lowell Fulson's case, plenty! During his long and storied career he recorded under his own name as well as Lowell Fullsom and Lowell Fulsom.
