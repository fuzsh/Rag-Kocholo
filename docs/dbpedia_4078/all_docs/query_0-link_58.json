        "text": "I was in my late 40s – call it 2018 – when I miraculously found Love’s Forever Changes on compact disc. I don’t recall but it was at a thrift store and if you’re like me – an aficionado of thrift – you know the feeling. To find really good albums in thrift stores occurs rarely enough that its a wonderful thing when it happens. It always begs the question – here’s a really unique album. If someone was cool enough to buy this and own it, why did they donate it to a thrift store?\n\nAnyways, great find. Don’t judge me but I had never before heard this record from Love, a band that suffered somewhat from existing in the shadow of another Los Angeles band on Elektra Records, the Doors. I had heard about the record, though, usually in relation to the Beach Boys’ Pet Sounds of ’66, the idea being that both were pivotal records and two of the greatest of all-time and most important of the mid-1960s.\n\nListening to Forever Changes in the spring the last few years always gets me thinking about similar records released at the same time. Psychedelic rock, they call it, and it comes in many shapes and sizes. Like a lot of things in music, it started with the Beatles. Famously, the Fab Four charted new territory with 1965’s Rubber Soul which in turn inspired Brian Wilson to create Pet Sounds which then prompted John, Paul, George, Ringo and George Martin to go further with the iconic centrepiece of psychedelic rock and 1960s music in general, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. And a quick aside; for those scoring at home, that is five men doing battle against one. It took the four Beatles and their producer to keep up with my main man, the dumb angel, Brian Wilson.\n\nThis genre came to something of a close when the Beatles slammed on the brakes, went to India and came back strumming acoustic guitars and going with a plain, white jacket. Brian retreated and his band – without him – invented lo-fi and Dylan went back to acoustic sounds. Finding psychedelic music’s roots is almost as hard as identifying the first rock & roll record. This is due mostly to the many defining elements that identify psychedelic rock. It takes many forms and incorporates various and sometimes disparate things like guitar feedback, tape manipulation, Indian/Eastern music and instruments, electronic keyboards and lyrics referencing drugs or surreal childhood imagery. So, if you look at reverb, for example, you can trace things back to “Telstar” by the Tornados or even “I Feel Fine” by the Beatles though neither tune might be considered “psychedelic”. Neither can the 1960 instrumental by the Gamblers called “LSD 25” but there it is, referenced in the title. For our purposes here, we’re going to look at the seminal year of 1967 for the first real bloom of psychedelia in music. Purveyors of pop/rock and folk artists all added psychedelia to their music, established artists took the side trip and one-offs emerged perhaps hoping to cash in on the train of trippy sounds.\n\nThere were better than 50 albums released in 1967 that could qualify as “psychedelic” in some way, shape or form. And a couple of things to note: on this list we’ll see many debut recordings and, indeed, 1967 saw the the first records released by many a legendary band. First records were issued by the Doors, the Velvet Underground, the Grateful Dead, Country Joe and the Fish, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Pink Floyd, Vanilla Fudge, Procol Harum and Traffic. Also, we mentioned Bob Dylan’s return to acoustic that happened with his John Wesley Hardin record as a herald of the beginning of the end of the preeminence of psychedelic rock. Well, that record was released December 27 of 1967. That’s how short-lived the dominance and prolificacy of psychedelic rock was, arguably little more than one calendar year though certainly psychedelic rock records did continue to be released in the ensuing years.\n\nWhat follows then is a chronological perusal of the psychedelic records released in that magical year of 1967, some of them iconic and all are emblematic of the genre – some perhaps more than others. So, turn off your mind, relax and float downstream…\n\nThe Doors – the Doors // File Also Under: art rock // The lad’s debut is still their biggest seller and is one of the most stunning debuts in rock history, boasting many classic songs. Listen again to the full-length album version of “Light My Fire”. Why? Two words: Ray Manzarek.\n\nSurrealistic Pillow – Jefferson Airplane // File Also Under: folk rock // Their second LP but the first with Grace Slick – so you could call it their first, in a way. The Airplane’s fusion of folk and psychedelia was innovative and this may be the quintessential psychedelic rock album. “White Rabbit” and “Somebody to Love” are bona fide classics.\n\nYounger Than Yesterday – the Byrds // File Also Under: raga rock // This 4th record from the Los Angeles folk rockers sees them continuing their country-influenced ways but on this record they add some tape effects and electronic sounds. Produced by Gary Usher. Features “So You Want to Be a Rock ‘n’ Roll Star”.\n\nMellow Yellow – Donovan // File Also Under: pop // All ten songs written by Scotland’s Donovan Leitch including the #2 US hit “Mellow Yellow”. Here Donovan presents lyrics that depict the trippy side of psychedelia. Leitch based this title track on the idea that you could achieve a high by smoking dried banana skins, a proposition presented to Donovan by Country Joe. “E-lec-trical banana…”.\n\nThe Velvet Underground and Nico – The Velvet Underground, Nico // File Also Under: proto-punk // An incredibly influential record and considered one of the most significant of all-time. The Velvets were managed at the time by Andy Warhol and this record combines the styles of Lou Reed & Co. and Andy reaching into territory far outside the mainstream. Interesting that it was released on jazz label Verve. Not understood at the time, lauded years later. Includes “I’m Waiting for the Man” and “Heroin”, blatant drug songs and “Femme Fatale” that Lou wrote about my girl, Edie Sedgwick.\n\nThe Grateful Dead – The Grateful Dead // File Also Under: garage rock // The debut from the original San Francisco band, this record could not capture the magic the Grateful Dead conjured when playing live. But it was a big deal in the Bay Area even though it found little radio airplay; the burgeoning FM radio formatting that would soon embrace this music was not yet thoroughly established.\n\nEmotions – Pretty Things // File Also Under: blues // Kent’s Pretty Things were born out of the same milieu that produced the Rolling Stones and like the Stones they adhered strictly to Chicago blues. Here’s an example of a band dabbling in psychedelia, adding it briefly to their established sound.\n\nContrast – Tages // File Also Under: freakbeat // Sweden’s Tages were one of the most popular bands in their homeland in the 1960s. Their third studio album, 1966’s Extra Extra, was one of the first psychedelic albums recorded and Contrast was the follow-up.\n\nElectric Comic Book – Blues Magoos // File Also Under: acid rock // Blues Magoos, out of the Bronx, were rockers with a sense of humour. The group’s debut album, Psychedelic Lollipop from 1966, was one of the earliest records to feature the word “psychedelic” in its title. The band was short-lived, splintering in the early 70s.\n\nThe Electric Prunes – The Electric Prunes // File Also Under: garage rock // After the success of their single, “I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)”, the group’s handlers rushed them into the studio to record an album. In the old story, most songs were written by others and producers pushed them on the group, much to their chagrin. The band’s follow-up albums were real oddities; psychedelic versions of Latin and Greek masses and Jewish and Christian church services. They returned to rock & roll but after the 2 minutes and 55 seconds of “I Had Too Much to Dream”, no one was listening.\n\nElectric Music for the Mind and Body – Country Joe and the Fish // File Also Under: folk rock // Like the Dead, Country Joe & Co. were part of the San Fran music scene. Again like the Dead, Country Joe got some love from nascent FM radio. This iconic album has been called an “enduring document”; certainly emblematic of this age.\n\nAre You Experienced – the Jimi Hendrix Experience // File Also Under: hard rock // What can be said about maybe the most iconic record from one of the 4 or 5 most significant artists of popular music history? An immediate critical and commercial success, the record contains many Jimi classics like the title track, “Foxy Lady” and “Manic Depression”. Jimi’s take on psychedelia, of course, was marked by blistering blues-based guitar.\n\nSgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band – the Beatles // File Also Under: pop // Maybe the greatest rock record ever made is credited with “bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art”.\n\nSuper Psychedelics – the Ventures // File Also Under: surf rock // The Ventures go trippin’ with a record loaded with groovy covers; “Strawberry Fields Forever”, “A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You” and “Happy Together”. They added originals they gave appropriate titles; “Psychedelic Venture”, “Guitar Psychedelics” and “Psyched-Out”. Groovy.\n\nThe Zodiac: Cosmic Sounds – Paul Beaver // File Also Under: spoken word // A real period piece, this was conceived by the head of Elektra Records and contains spoken word recitations against a back drop fleshed out by the Wrecking Crew and the Moog synthesizer. “Must Be Played in the Dark”, read the back cover.\n\nMoby Grape – Moby Grape // File Also Under: power pop // More sounds out of San Francisco, this debut record has been called by some “one of the very few psychedelic masterpieces ever recorded”. They released fully five singles from this bad boy but ol’ Moby never really did have much chart success.\n\nEvolution – the Hollies // File Also Under: pop // The Hollies may represent the quintessential example of a Sixties group’s “evolution” from beat rockers to more introspective songwriters to psychedelic explorers. Evolution is the band’s sixth record and was recorded at Abbey Road Studios during the same time the Beatles were creating Sgt. Pepper. Seems the Hollies – or their label – were hedging on the psychedelic thing, though; the lovely straight pop song “Carrie Anne” is the lead-off track on the US version of the record.\n\nWe Are Paintermen – the Creation // File Also Under: garage rock // This mystery band from the UK released this compilation of earlier music in dark corners of Europe. The Creation lasted about as long as this LP’s runtime of 33:40.\n\nBee Gees’ 1st – Bee Gees // File Also Under: baroque pop // Seemingly light years before Saturday Night Fever, the Brothers Gibb issued this their first internationally released album and saw it reach the Top Ten on both sides of the Atlantic. Features “To Love Somebody”.\n\nLittle Games – the Yardbirds // File Also Under: rock // Jimmy Page and the boys were drifting from straight ahead blues-rock and incorporating more varied material. Page wasn’t happy with pop music-minded Mickie Most producing and after this release the band was no more and Page went on to the heights.\n\nThe 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion – the Incredible String Band // File Also Under: psychedelic folk // You could say Elektra Records were at the forefront of psychedelic rock. The label released this second album from the Scottish group who had reformed after their first record and took their folk music to the next level incorporating African and Middle Eastern instruments and influences.\n\nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn – Pink Floyd // File Also Under: space rock // Their only album created under the leadership of Syd Barrett and before David Gilmour arrived. This debut combined long-form improvisational pieces with whimsical psychedelia. The record was a sign of things to come for this rock juggernaut.\n\nVanilla Fudge – Vanilla Fudge // File Also Under: proto-metal // Few could cover pop music the way Vanilla Fudge could. You’ve never heard “Ticket to Ride” or Sonny Bono’s “Bang Bang” like this before. Stunning debut from an incredibly unique band.\n\nProcul Harum – Procul Harum // File Also Under: proto-prog // You could say Procol Harum wrote the book on large-scale, orchestral baroque pop psychedelia and their “A Whiter Shade of Pale” – with its enigmatic lyrics – is a prototypical example of the genre. The track – a Top 5 worldwide smash – is on the US version of the LP. But dig also the mighty “Conquistador”.\n\nWe Are Ever So Clean – Blossom Toes // File Also Under: freakbeat // Sneaky good London band who issued this debut on short-lived Marmalade Records. Their next – and last – LP was more in a rock vein. Makes this record a real hidden gem.\n\nEaster Everywhere – the 13th Floor Elevators // File Also Under: garage rock // Formed in Austin and included an electric jug player. These guys may be the pioneers. They were the first to refer to their music as “psychedelic rock”; the term appeared on their business card in January of 1966 and the jug player, Tommy Hall, apparently coined the phrase.\n\nGorilla – Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band // File Also Under: avant-garde // Basically a bonkers comedy record. The group wanted to savagely parody trad jazz so they did. The whole record is a send-up of many genres.\n\nWinds of Change – Eric Burdon & the Animals // File Also Under: experimental // Eric Burdon walked away from the rhythm & blues of the original Animals, moved to San Francisco and opened a new branch of his band. This time he experimented with reciting stories to psychedelic backings. The debut from “the new Animals” includes “San Franciscan Nights” (Top 10 internationally).\n\nForever Changes – Love // File Also Under: chamber pop // With Pet Sounds, this is where I came in. On this the original group’s swan song, Arthur Lee “explored darker themes alluding to mortality and his creeping disillusionment with the 1960s counterculture”.\n\nPisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd. – the Monkees // File Also Under: pop // Another group straying from their pure pop origins. The Monkees were fresh off their album Headquarters, a record they were finally able to make on their own. They continued to branch out here particularly in Micky Dolenz’ early use of the Moog. Dig “Daily Nightly”.\n\nDays of Future Passed – the Moody Blues // File Also Under: symphonic prog // The first concept album from this legendary outfit. Critics have said the Moodies created a genre here marrying psychedelic rock ballads with orchestral interludes played by a symphony. Includes “Nights in White Satin”.\n\nDisraeli Gears – Cream // File Also Under: blues rock // Produced by Mountain’s Felix Pappalardi, this second of four studio albums for the original supergroup contains their monster hit, the iconic “Sunshine of Your Love”. The album was recorded in under four days.\n\nBuffalo Springfield Again – Buffalo Springfield // File Also Under: country folk // Second album from Buffalo Springfield. Though contributing “Mr. Soul” and “Expecting to Fly”, Neil Young was in and out and Richie Furay was coming to the fore, helping to invent country rock.\n\nTangerine Dream – Kaleidoscope // File Also Under: art rock // This UK band was short-lived – they released only one more record before breaking up and reforming 20 years later. This the group’s unheralded debut has been compared to Pink Floyd’s first record, mentioned above.\n\nThe Amboy Dukes – the Amboy Dukes // File Also Under: hard rock // Another debut record, this time from the American rockers known for giving Ted Nugent his start and their hit “Journey to the Center of the Mind”. Critics have likened this record to the music of Blues Magoos and Hendrix.\n\nButterfly – the Hollies // File Also Under: experimental pop // The Hollies returned in November of ’67 with their second foray into psychedelia inside a five-month stretch. Final Hollies record to feature Graham Nash.\n\nThe Time Has Come – the Chambers Brothers // File Also Under: psychedelic soul // The first record from the guys from Los Angeles highlighted by their 11-minute hit, the spectacular “Time Has Come Today” (“Time!”). A pioneering psychedelic soul album, maybe the most significant one not made at Motown or by Norman Whitfield. “Time!!”\n\nMr. Fantasy – Traffic // File Also Under: jazz rock // Traffic? Steve Winwood? Forget it. He’s my man, as my regular readers will know. This first album from Stevie’s second band features great music, one song – at least – for the ages. “Dear Mr. Fantasy”? For. Get. It.\n\nTheir Satanic Majesties Request – the Rolling Stones // File Also Under: acid rock // The Rolling Stones deviated briefly from their good, old, down home, check-it-out-tasty rock & roll and ventured into Beatleland in sound and visuals. “She’s a Rainbow” is one of their finest creations.\n\nCauldron – Fifty Foot Hose // File Also Under: electronic rock // All of one LP record did these boys from San Fran issue. The record – featuring the sounds of a homemade synthesizer – sold sparingly and the band was around for seemingly only minutes. They broke up when most of the players joined the cast of Hair.\n\nClear Light – Clear Light // File Also Under: psychedelic folk // Another Sunset Strip band signed to Elektra. This is their one and only album. Became “underground heroes” when, during a gig, the organist got into a screaming match with a heckler. Another footnote group that lasted just long enough to record their album.\n\nH.P. Lovecraft – H.P. Lovecraft // File Also Under: folk rock // These folk rockers from Ol’ Chi released this their debut containing a haunting ambiance inspired by their namesake’s writings. Jazz, folk, Gregorian chant and singer-songwriter stuff are in the gumbo here. Another group that wasn’t long for this earth.\n\nIncense and Peppermints – Strawberry Alarm Clock // File Also Under: acid rock // The debut record from Glendale’s Alarm Clock features their major contribution “Incense and Peppermints”, a psychedelic staple. Their rep was helped when their music was featured in the AIP film Psych-Out. Three more records appeared in the next 11 months and the band was spent.\n\nInner Views – Sonny Bono // File Also Under: folk rock // Sonny’s only solo record he produced himself and it contains only five songs, one clocking in at 12 minutes and another at over seven. A real rarity.\n\nNo Way Out – the Chocolate Watch Band // File Also Under: garage rock // Big in San Jose, the boys put out this their first record on Tower Records. One of the many groups from this era that went through more line-up changes than years in existence.\n\nThe Parable of Arable Land – the Red Crayola // File Also Under: avant garde // Formed in Houston, the Red Crayola – today its “Krayola” – were labelmates of the 13th Floor Elevators, who’s frontman, Roky Erickson, plays on this record. The album “features free improvised pieces involving industrial power tools and a revving motorcycle dubbed ‘Free Form Freak-Out’.”. OK, then.\n\nPtooff! – the Deviants // File Also Under: proto-punk // UK freakbeaters who released three albums in the 60s before drifting into the ether. This debut was initially released only through mail order.\n\nThe Story of Simon Simopath – Nirvana // File Also Under: baroque pop // The album tells the story of young Simon who dreams of flying. This less tiresome band named Nirvana recorded for Island Records and this their first album was produced by label founder Chris Blackwell. The title of this group’s second album? The Existence of Chance Is Everything and Nothing While the Greatest Achievement Is the Living of Life, and so Say ALL OF US.\n\nSupernatural Fairy Tales – Art // File Also Under: pop // The only album from Art, also on Island. Features a cover of “For What It’s Worth”. Another case where the band broke up maybe only days after the record’s release. The members then joined Gary Wright to form Spooky Tooth."
