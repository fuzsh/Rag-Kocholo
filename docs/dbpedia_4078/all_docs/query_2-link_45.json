What does your list look like? Here's a stab at the albums that jarred me. It's hard to cut the list down. Too many favorites. (no particular order)\n\n1. Layla (Derrick and the Dominoes)\n\n2. Aja (Steely Dan)\n\n3. Blood on the Tracks (B. Dylan)\n\n4. Tommy (The Who)\n\n5. Led Zeppelin IV (L. Zeppelin)\n\n6. Eat a Peach (Alman Bros.)\n\n7. Dark Side of the Moon (P. Floyd)\n\n8. Workingmans Dead (Grateful Dead)\n\n9. Night at the Opera (Queen)\n\n10. Born to Run (B. Springsteen)\n\n11. White Album (Beatles)\n\n12. The Wall (P. Floyd)\n\n13. Heavy Traffic (Traffic)\n\nThese are some of the best albums but in no order , it would be more easy to write the best 100.\n\nElvis Presely - The Sun Sessions\n\nThe Beatles - Rubber Soul\n\nThe Rolling Stones - Let It Bleed\n\nThe Rolling Stone -Sticky Fingers\n\nThe Rolling Stones- Exile On Main Street\n\nThe Velvet Underground - First Album\n\nThe Loving Spoonful- Hums Of The Loving Spoonful\n\nLed Zepplin- 3\n\nBob Dylan- Blonde On Blonde\n\nGreatful Dead - American Beauty/Workingman's Dead (should be a double album,same sessions)\n\nQueen -A Night At The Opera\n\nAlso a # 11\n\nDavid Bowie -Ziggy Stardust\n\nExcellent choices so far.\n\nSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Beatles\n\nRubber Soul, Beatles\n\nRevolver, Beatles\n\nHighway 61 Revisited, Bob Dylan\n\nBringing It All Back Home, Bob Dylan\n\nThe Band, The Band (second album)\n\nDisraeli Gears, Cream\n\nBlues Breakers, John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton, AKA the \"Beano\" album\n\nMy Generation, The Who\n\nLed Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin\n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash, Crosby Stills & Nash\n\nBuffalo Springfield Again, Buffalo Springfield\n\nLive Dead, Grateful Dead\n\nAfter Bathing at Baxters, Jefferson Airplane\n\nEast/West, Paul Butterfield Blues Band\n\nAre You Experienced?, Jimi Hendrix\n\nBeggars Banquet, Rolling Stones\n\nHmmmm. How do I fit in the amazing, startling, vital tracks by the Beach Boys, the Kinks, Traffic, Steely Dan, Van Morrison, Frank Zappa, Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye, James Brown, the Zombies, the Hollies, Jeff Beck, Wilson Pickett, the Doors, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Byrds, Pink Floyd, the Youngbloods, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Stevie Wonder, Ten Years After, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Blind Faith, Aretha Franklin, Jethro Tull, Neil Young, and the rest of the '60s-vintage albums by Dylan, the Beatles, Stones, Cream, Hendrix, and the Who? All of those albums were surprising, stop-me-in-my-tracks releases.\n\nIs that ten yet?\n\nWhat the heck was going on in the '60s, anyway?\n\nThese are in no particular order -\n\n1. Blows Against the Empire / Jefferson Airplane\n\n2. Bridge of Sighs / Jeff Beck\n\n3. London Calling / the Clash\n\n4. After the Goldrush / Neil Young\n\n5. Are You Experienced / Jimi Hendrix\n\n6. Fragile / Yes\n\n7. The Gilded Palace of Sin / Flying Burrito Brothers\n\n8. The Doors (self titled 1st album) / The Doors\n\n9. Four Way Street / CSN&Y\n\n10. At Folsom Prison / Johnny Cash\n\nKind of an unfortunate subject title as it's just not possible to say which albums were/are \"the best.\" #But I'll list some really olde albums that I loved at the time and have played songs off of in the last few months.\n\nBlind Faith - Blind Faith (Do What You Like!)\n\nThe Who - Who's Next (Love Ain't for Keeping)\n\nThe Dead - Mars Hotel (US Blues)\n\nDylan - Hwy 61 (Takes a Train)\n\nBrewer and Shipley - Weeds (Rise Up)\n\nJimi Hendrix -Axis Bold as Love (Little Wing)\n\nFOW - Welcome Interstate Managers (Bright Future in Sales)\n\nMaybe I'll add more later - gotta go now. #But this is the sorta thing what comes from jamming regularly with other olde doods.\n\nI like the varous flavors that are emerging. Rather than really listing the 10 best, how about the 10 whose introduction really turned heads in terms of wow factor. I remember getting my first FM radio and hearing some long song with flutes in it that kind of built up to crescendo, and talking to my friends who had heard it too, but none of us had caught the name. I also remember talking to my friends about how great the summer of 1975 was going to be now that school was ending, and turning on the stereo and hearing Layla for the first time. It simply floored us.\n\nThere are so many essential rock 60's through 80's rock albums, but these are in the top ones that made a major impact on me\n\nBeatles: Revolver\n\nBeatles: White Album\n\nBeatles: Abbey Road\n\nMcCartney: McCartney\n\nLennon: Plastic Ono Band\n\nHarrison: All Things Must Pass\n\nThe Band: Music from Big Pink\n\nPink Floyd: Meddle\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd: first album\n\nJethro Tull: Thick as a Brick\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\nRobin Trower: Bridge of Sighs\n\nDire Straits: Any\n\nJoe Cocker: Mad Dogs and Englishman\n\nThe Police: Any, but especially Synchronicity or Zenyatta Mendatta\n\nAlso:\n\nThe Band-The Band\n\nX- Los Angeles\n\nThe Blasters - The Blasters\n\nNeil Young - With Crazy Horse\n\nTen Years After - Ssssh\n\nThe New Riders Of The Purple Sage - Panama Red\n\nJohn Prine -John Prine\n\nRod Stewert -Every Picture Tells A Story\n\nJames Taylor - Sweet Baby James\n\nThe Kinks - Muswell Hillbillys\n\n&\n\nT-Rex- Warrior\n\nRoxy Music -Roxy Music\n\nIggy Pop oh well the list of the vintage years 1955-1985 is endless\n\nSo are the Vinatge years of Jazz 1955-1965\n\nAnd for film 1935 -1955\n\nand on and on and on and on it goes..........\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival: Bayou Country, Green River, Willy & The Poor Boys\n\nJefferson Airplane: Surrealistic Pillow, Volunteers\n\nQuicksilver Messenger Service: Quicksilver Messenger Service (1st), Happy Trails\n\nJimi Hendrix: Are You Experienced, Axis Bold As Love, Electric Ladyland\n\nRolling Stones: Beggar's Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers\n\nButterfield Blues Band: East-West\n\nCrosby Stills & Nash: Crosby Stills & Nash\n\nNeil Young: Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\n\nJethro Tull: Stand Up, Benefit, Aqualung\n\nBeatles: Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt.

(There's probably a couple from 65 or 66, and a few from 1972.)\n\n72 onwards....? (but still just the 70s) ......Commander Cody, ZZ Top, Robin Trower, (Nicks era) Fleetwood Mac, Steeleye Span, Richard & Linda Thompson, Sandy Denny, Genesis, Nick Lowe, Ry Cooder, more Pink Floyd, etc. etc. etc\n\nNH\n\nBoy...Deja Vu big time!!!\n\nI was listening to one today that blew me away when it first came out and I can't believe I am listing it on this forum...\n\nDavid Bowie\n\n\"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\"\n\nIt was so ahead of it's time 30 years ago and I still enjoyed it today.\n\nTHis is great...Living in the past aren't we?\n\n1972-1979\n\nPink Floyd: Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here\n\nGrateful Dead: Grateful Dead (Skull & Roses), Europe 72, Mars Hotel\n\nJerry Garcia: Garcia (\"Deal\" \"Loser\" \"Sugaree\" etc.)\n\nCopperhead: Copperhead (John Cipollina)\n\nMan: Back Into The Future, Rhinos Winos & Lunatics, Slow Motion\n\nRobin Trower: Bridge of Sighs\n\nBob Seger: Smokin' OPs, Seven, Live Bullet\n\nFleetwood Mac (Buckingham-Nicks): Fleetwood Mac, Rumours\n\nAllman Brothers: Eat A Peach\n\nBlue Öyster Cult: Blue Öyster Cult (first), Agents of Fortune\n\nCaptain Beefheart & His Magic Band: Trout Mask Replica (1969), Shiny Beast/Bat Chain Puller\n\nCommander Cody & His Lost Planet Airmen: Hot Licks Cold Steel & Trucker's Favorites, Live From Deep In The Heart of Texas\n\nEmmylou Harris: Luxury Liner\n\nSandy Denny: Sandy\n\nSteeleye Span: Hark The Village Wait, Please To See The King, Ten Man Mop, Below The Salt, Parcel of Rogues\n\nRichard Thompson: Henry The Human Fly, I Want To See The Bright Lights Tonight, Hokey Pokey, Sunnyvista\n\nJohn Martyn: Bless The Weather\n\nSteve Ashley: Stroll On\n\nAlan Stivell: Renaissance of the Celtic Harp, Chemins De Terre\n\nOsamu Kitajima: Benzaiten\n\nJohnny Winter: Johnny Winter And\n\nBrinsley Schwarz: Nervous On The Road\n\nRory Gallagher: Irish Tour 74\n\nZZ Top: Tres Hombres\n\nRy Cooder: Paradise & Lunch, Chicken Skin Music\n\nRandy Newman: Good Ole Boys, Little Criminals\n\nKinks: Lola\n\nLinda Ronstadt: Prisoner In Disguise\n\nDire Straits: Dire Straits (first)\n\nJethro Tull: Songs From The Wood\n\nGenesis: Selling England By The Pound\n\nNick Drake: Pink Moon\n\nDeep Purple: Machine Head\n\nAC/DC: Highway To Hell\n\nBrian Eno: Another Green World\n\nTom Waits: Blue Valentine, Foreign Affairs\n\nDr. John: Gumbo\n\n80s - Chris Isaak, SRV, Eric Johnson, Los Lobos, Shoukichi Kina & Champloose, Robert Palmer, Bonnie Raitt, Chris Rea, Spinal Tap\n\n.....more Ry Cooder, Randy Newman, AC/DC, RT, Waits\n\nDejaVue all over again for sure.\n\nI agree with Sgt. Peppers and Dylan.\n\nDidn't have much of a budget for record (Mom, what is a 'record'?) albums back then, but made the exception for Crosby, Stills, Nash, and the other guy Young. And Dylan, too. Acoustic music. As far as 'rock' was concerned. And the Beatles used quite a bit of acoustic guitar in their art.\n\nI was mostly a folkie back then, playing the guitar. The thought of playing a mandolin never occurred to me. When I discovered bluegrass it was right to the 5-string initially.\n\nBut boy, the memories awakened here.\n\nNot all rock but were in a lot pf collection\n\nJohn Coltrane - Love Surpreme\n\nMiles Davis - Kind Of Blue\n\nElectric Prunes -Electric Mass\n\nDave Peel and The Lower East Side - ?\n\nMile Davis -Witchs Brew\n\nJohn Hartford -Areoplaine\n\nWoody Guthrie re-issues\n\nIron Buterfly -In A Gada da Vida\n\nBlack Oak Ark\n\nSteppenwolf - Monster\n\nalso The Fugs, Canned Heat and the MC5 put out some prett cool grooves.\n\nThier coming to take me away ha ha\n\nand the beat goes on....."
