Episode Notes

James Lowe was the singer for The Electric Prunes, the psychedelic rock band that had a big hit with the song “I Had Too Much To Dream Last Night” in 1967. They charted again with the song “Get Me To The World On Time”. The Prunes toured with Cream, the Beach Boys and Steppenwolf among others. James went on to work with Todd Rundgren, Van Dyke Parks and Ry Cooder.

My featured song is “Cousins”, from the album Trippin’ by my band Project Grand Slam. Spotify link.
