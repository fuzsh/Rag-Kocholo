For the full review – please watch the video above

My exposure to The Electric Prunes was from hearing the single ‘I Had Too Much To Dream (Last Night) on a compilation called Nuggets many years ago. I saw them as a psychedelic pop-rock band from the 1960s but did not know any of the album material.

Having reviewed the Iron Butterfly and Rhinoceros Box sets I was very keen to hear this set when it was scheduled by Grapefruit Records (which is part of Cherry Red Records).

Then Came The Dawn is a 6CD Box Set featuring the complete recordings by The Electric Prunes from 1966 – 1969.

The Box Set includes Stereo / Mono mixes of The Electric Prunes (1967) Underground (1967) Mass in F Minor (1967) – yes that’s three albums in one year!

Release of An Oath and Just Good Old Rock and Roll are on one CD in a gatefold sleeve and also included is the 1967 live album from Stockholm and a CD of single mixes, rare tracks and extended versions.

The 36-page booklet tells the story of the band with interviews with the surviving members with plenty of photos and memorabilia.

The remastering is superb and was carried out by Alec Palao and the process is also described in the booklet.

Being new to the band and in many ways seeing myself as a student to this period of rock history I had expected everything to be like the single. This is so not the case. The albums Mass in F Minor and Releases of an Oath are like embryonic PROG and so adventurous. Everyone should hear these!

The last album Just Good Old Rock and Roll reminds me of Book of Taliesin by Deep Purple in places. Other reference points are Syd Barrett period Pink Floyd and early Who.
