The latest twist in the spiral is so sharp because of two independent processes. The first is the modernization of anti-Semitism in the West, where they long stopped talking about ritual murders and now claim that the Holocaust was a hoax, and simultaneously, that the Israelis are creating a “Palestinian Holocaust.” The second is the new state haven, Iran, given to anti-Semitism in the East. These two processes, until recently independent of each other, have now been joined into one and definitely need study. The purely scholarly problem of determining the number of victims, like other aspects of the demography of the Holocaust, have suddenly been closely embroiled in geopolitics and the phenomenon of Holocaust denial, which is now a context that has been forced upon it. Our book is imbued with these ties and interrelationships. This book consists of three parts and appendixes. Parts one and three are written by the editors, while the second is a kind of primer of selected articles on the demographics of the Holocaust which formed the basis for preparing part 3. We must tell you that in the course of working on the book, its very concept changed internally, and at one point we thought that the “floor” (that is, space in the book) should be given to the opposing view. Literally: we wanted to include a separate section with demographically relevant texts by the deniers, thereby hoping to model a kind of debate with them. < vii >\n\nALFRED KOKH AND PAVEL POLIAN\n\nWe would be showing our readers deserved trust, we hoped. We assumed that once they saw what the scholars and deniers had to say, the readers would compare the arguments, decide how serious and scientific they were, and come to their own independent and correct conclusion. Theoretically, they could do that without our help, but to find the primary sources for both sides would require major effort. Public libraries rarely carry works by the deniers (and certainly specifically “demographic” ones would be even rarer). Internet users would find the deniers (and with a little more effort, their demographic works) more easily than they would the classic works by historians and demographers of the Holocaust. Overcoming this parallel existence was part of structural plan — a plan that we had to give up at the last moment. We did it when we learned that publications that included texts by deniers could be considered — at least in Germany — as distribution and propaganda of works that were harmful to young people. The context is taken into account, of course, but there was a high likelihood that the book would indexed, that is, rated as literature unacceptable for distribution in Germany. Writing or editing such a work is a criminal offense, and the book would be listed in the special Index of literature and other mass media harmful to young people and therefore fully or partially banned in Germany (only special scholarly libraries would be able to have the book legally in their collections). Just as it would be wrong to delete Germany from the audience of this book, it would be just as wrong, in our opinion, to ignore its legal field. We did not want to end up after a year and a half of intensive work as authors of a book at risk of having the same legal status as Mein Kampf. In our context, this is absurd, but let’s not forget what the other extreme cost Germany and accept this situation with humility and understanding. It is actually a fairly good illustration of the content and issues of part of our book. That is Part 1, which has Alfred Kokh’s Foreword and Pavel Polian’s article “The Denial of the Holocaust and its Geopolitics.” We examine the issues of evolution and structure of the denier movement, including aspects of their historical and legal reasonability as well as problems of its anti-Semitic and geopolitical instrumentalization, especially in view of the open threat to the existence of the state of Israel from its political enemies, primarily Iran. The writers in the second part can be divided into three groups. The first is professional demographers who use a specific demographic method < viii >\n\nFROM THE EDITORS\n\nof analysis, primarily balance models: Sergio Della Pergola (director of the Harman Institute of Modern Jewry, Jewish University of Jerusalem) analyzes global and European Jewry, and Mark Kupovetsky (executive director of the Russian-American Center of the Bible and Judaica, Russian State University of the Humanities, Moscow) the Jewish population of the Soviet Union and neighboring countries. The second group is professional historians, who analyze the situation in individual European countries affected by Shoah and then summarize the results from each into a whole. This is what Wolfgang Benz (currently director of the Center for Studying Anti-Semitism, Berlin Technical University) did with country studies within an existing fundamental project carried out in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which he headed. Dieter Pohl (scholar at the Institute of Contemporary History, Munich) did the same thing, but in the 2000s and incorporating numerous new data that were discovered in the archives of Eastern Europe. The third group is archivists and historians from Yad Vashem, who are creating a unique data bank on the victims of the Holocaust. Alexander Avraham gives a detailed characterization of the history of the creation and structural functioning of the data bank, while Aron Shneer shows, on the relatively small example of Latvia, what research potential it contains. The texts by Della Pergola and Benz are in translations made from the original publications. Pohl, Kupovetsky, and Shneer reworked their original articles for this book and Avraham wrote his text especially at our request. References to the publications in the second part are given in the first footnote of each article. Part 3 consists of Polian’s article and Kokh’s Afterword. Polian gives an overview of the history of demographic analysis of the Holocaust and attempts to analyze the data and introduce as many corrections as possible (the corrections are insignificant per se). He also raises some structural questions (for example, on the relationship between Shoah and the question of Jewish identity) and analyzes specifics of methodology, which in the case of the deniers borders on lack of conscientiousness. The book ends with three appendixes. The first gives a selected bibliography of works both of the deniers and authors who analyze their activity. The second is documents of the Soviet administration that record and in part analyze the horrible reality that the liberators found in Auschwitz and Birkenau. The third is a compilation table showing almost all the many structural variations in estimating the number of victims of the Holocaust. < ix >\n\nALFRED KOKH AND PAVEL POLIAN\n\nThe editors thank Alexander Avraham, Wolfgang Benz, Sergio Della Pergola, Dieter Pohl and Aron Shneer for taking part in the project and providing all kinds of support.

One was cypress, the other, rosewood. Imagine a couple of barely finished logs, one of which was to be buried deep into the ground, so that the body on the cross would not topple over. Massive logs, heavy, with axe marks and sharp splinters . . . . By today’s standards it seems that an impoverished prophet would be crucified on a cross made of valuable woods. But historians have an easy answer. Today, cypress and rosewood are rare and valuable and used for furniture and musical instruments. But at the beginning of the new era, there were forests of them in Palestine. It was cheap, cypress and rosewood lumber abounded. Perhaps Jesus had made something from that wood himself, he was a carpenter after all, like his stepfather, Joseph. Then the forests were chopped down. Agriculture gradually faded out. The Arabs took over the empty lands after banishing the Jews. They tried to make it habitable, but new cypress groves, cedar woods, and plantations of palms and olives did not grow. After the Crusades that land lay another eight hundred years in dust and stones, turning into a desert. But in the twentieth century, Jews from all over the world returned to the Promised Land and they began planting trees. When you travel through Israel today, you never stop marveling at the human energy expended on the country. The mountain slopes along the road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem are hand planted with cedars and cypresses. There are orange and tangerine orchards from Jerusalem to the south. All of Galilee is olive gardens and wheat fields. On the way to Eilat you see kibbutzim with huge plantations of date palms. None of this had been there before. It was all done by people.\n\nALFRED KOKH\n\nPerhaps, in a few decades, cypress and rosewood lumber will be found in every scrap pile, as they did in the days of Christ. Now, when the discussion has grown heated once again about the right of Jews to the land of Israel, you hear various arguments from all sides. Excerpts are read from the Torah, the Bible, and the Koran. There are appeals to prophets and promises of suffering in hell. Orators use diplomatic chicanery and blatant historical sophistry. There are bribes and threats. In this discussion the arguments include dynamite, armies, and blackmail. But I don’t hear anyone using what I consider the most important argument, which is simple and clear. Does not land belong to those who make it better and cleaner, who restored it to its former beauty, who replaced the woodcutter’s ax with the gardener’s watering can? Who brought water to the lifeless desert, who irrigated the fields that had not known the plow for a hundred years, who built marvelous white cities in place of miserable clay huts, who laid roads instead of camel paths, constructed hospitals, destroyed epidemics, and liquidated hunger. But the discussion does not quiet down. A new generation of politicians is using new approaches in this struggle. What needs to be done to put an end to Israel’s existence? The answer is easy — make the West, in its broadest sense, including Russia, that is, the entire Christian world, stop supporting the Jews and their state in Palestine. For all the skill of the Israeli Army, it simply will not have the resources to withstand Islamic pressure for long. Oil, military equipment, and human resources are not limitless, and the Arab (and more broadly, the Islamic) world has significantly more of them than Israel would without the support of the West. What needs to be done to rupture the tie between the West and Israel? The most important impact would come from a revision of twentiethcentury history. And of the Holocaust in particular. If people in West can be taught that there was no Holocaust, that it was just “a Jewish trick,” that Jews exploited being victims for vast riches incommensurate with their real losses, then I’m sure that the support of people in the street will be undermined. And if the mood of the voters changes, then sooner or later, so will the actions of politicians and therefore of nations. And then, they could declare war on Israel, especially if they prepared for it. Get the atom bomb, buy up a lot of conventional weapons, missiles, and tanks with petrodollars. This is precisely what Iran is doing. The current Iranian president is a very smart man. He began in just this way — he held a conference on the Holocaust in Teheran where they wanted to show that there had been no Holocaust.\n\nA DENIAL OF DENIAL\n\nThis book is devoted to this topic. Here’s the point. Polemics between proponents of the historical, traditional concept of the Holocaust and the so-called deniers, or, as they call themselves, revisionists, always takes place long-distance. The only place where they can be placed for a face-toface discussion is a courtroom, where the denier is the defendant and the traditionalist is the expert witness. As in the worst days of the Inquisition (whose greatest victims were the Jews, by the way), today, in the heart of Europe, people are being put in prison for their thoughts and feelings! Yes, it’s very possible that these people are devious and have evil intentions. Yes, probably, they violate facts and practice filthy intrigues. But is that reason enough to put someone behind bars? Then they should be joined by the authors who publish articles on the superiority of the Jews and their chosen status on the basis that most of the Nobel laureates are Jewish. Isn’t that an example of intrigue and evil intent? And don’t these people do a disservice for the Jews and help the revisionists? Russian history scholarship has an entire movement that denies the Tatar-Mongol yoke. Should all those people be sent to prison for mocking the memory of the victims of Batyi? The discussion on permissible methods of having a discussion about the Holocaust has turned into an independent discipline. On the one hand you have millions of innocent victims, and on the other people sitting in prison whose guilt is openly claiming that those victims do not exist. Today, more than sixty years after the end of World War II, nothing plays into the hands of the revisionists more than being tried and nothing incites anti-Semitic feelings in neutral observers than the harsh sentences for the deniers. Practice has shown that attempting to have direct dialogue with the revisionists has been an extremely difficult and thankless task for the scholars, the majority of deniers are fanatically anti-Semitic, and they are not interested in the truth but in a platform for the propaganda of their phobias and the inevitable scandals that will follow. So, scholars can, of course, continue to pretend that the deniers no longer exist and refuse to debate with them. But on the other hand, I understand that the rejection of public debate even with the most unpleasant and despicable opponent, combined with the constant threat of a prison cell, creates sympathy among the unsophisticated public for the “innocent victims of Zionism” and casts doubt on the existence of real and incontrovertible evidence about the scale of the Holocaust.\n\nALFRED KOKH\n\nIf this “strange war” continues, then through the efforts on the one hand of the devious messengers of radical Islamic circles and sincere proponents of the “renaissance of the Aryan spirit” and on the other, of the linear and short-sighted actions of the traditionalists, there will be a change in Western public opinion and the seeds of doubt being sown by both sides will grow into a harvest: the denial of the Holocaust will no longer be a marginal point of view but a commonplace, an unquestionable fact. And what will happen then? Here is what will happen: after some time, the gardens of Israel will wither and flourishing groves will be replaced by dusty deserts. Filthy, shaggy dogs and hungry Arab urchins will wend their way down roads, begging — some for bones, others for money from passing tourists. Impoverished Bedouins, as they did a thousand years ago, will brew coffee in their tents. Some of the Jews will be killed, some will move to Europe and America. And Palestine will be silenced for many centuries again except for the muezzin’s call to morning prayer for the faithful Muslims in Jerusalem. Palestine will turn into a bad copy of Egypt, Syria, or Jordan, with their filth, petty trade, and complete absence of progress. But if you think it will end there, you are an incurable optimist. Inspired by their success, Islamic leaders will call upon their brethren in Europe to wage holy war against the infidels, and millions of Muslims in France, Great Britain, Holland, Germany and all over Europe will rise under the green banner of the Prophet. After that 9/11 will seem but a minor, insignificant episode. They will decide that the uncovered beauty of European women offends their Muslim religious feelings. They will demand the women don the burqa. No? You refuse? Then a few public murders, a few terrorist acts, and European women won’t wait for official decisions by the authorities and put on the black floor length sacks and cover their faces. You want to teach Darwin? Deny that the world was created by Allah? How about a few school burnings and executions of teachers? Ninety percent of school children are Muslim! You want to believe in Christ and deny the divine nature of the Koran? Bombs in churches and monasteries, beatings of priests and monks will bring you to your senses. Remember how the Kosovar Albanians treated Christian sites. And don’t even try to imagine what will happen to European Jews. They won’t be able to hide in Europe. The holy wrath of the religious fanatics will find them just as easily as in the Middle East.\n\nA DENIAL OF DENIAL\n\nI may be exaggerating, but this is how I see it. It’s totally wrong for some of the deniers to think that they are merely restoring “historical truth” and rehabilitating the “unjustly slandered” German people. Since I, Alfred Kokh, contrary to public opinion, am half German and half Russian, and not Jewish, I have nothing against the rehabilitation of the German people. But not at any price. I am prepared to hear the deniers’ arguments, but only if they are factually reliable and logical. But if the arguments boil down to a search for the mythical Jewish conspiracy, then I pass, because conspiratology is as false a science as alchemy. And if the proponents of the traditional version use no other argument but “Shame on you for denying!” then I (and many others, by the way) am not likely to support that turn in the discussion. We (that is, my colleague in this work, Pavel Polian, and I) decided to publish this book to respond finally (or perhaps, just one more time?) to what should be long-closed questions. I don’t want to preempt the contents, but I will tell you that we tried to present as strictly as possible the demographic arguments of both the traditionalists and the deniers, thereby modeling some semblance of discussion between them and most importantly between their arguments. In compiling the second part of the book, the anthology, we tried to limit ourselves to articles that reflect the issues to the greatest degree. We intentionally did not include any individual stories, despite their indisputable drama and tragedy, because even the most heart-breaking personal story cannot be proof when millions of deaths are turned into statistics. In that sense, demographic materials, the data of censuses, studies of migration, and even forensic reports are more important for establishing the truth than a personal drama, even though these dry materials may not seem convincing at first on an emotional level. We do not imagine that after the publication of this book, when all the existing arguments on both sides will be seen and heard, the discussion between traditionalist historians and the deniers will come to an end. But for unprejudiced people capable of attending to logical arguments, the discussion will become much clearer. If we achieve that goal, we will consider our work done.\n\nPAVEL POLIAN\n\nPavel Polian\n\nTHE DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ITS GEOPOLITICS\n\nWe are not responsible for the political consequences of revisionism. Of course I do not like Zionists very much, but I am not an anti-Semite and I do not hate Jews . . . < . . . > The State of Israel does not have the right to exist. What is to be done with these Jews? We are a cultured people, we cannot destroy them. What is to be done with them? I don’t know. Jürgen Graf. From a 2002 interview.1 Either these people really don’t know anything, or they just want to pull the wool over people’s eyes. What took place cannot be denied any longer. For it indeed did take place. From an interview with Joseph Erber, former Commandant of the women’s camp in the concentration camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau.2 It would be interesting to know what the current status of the “JewishOswiecim Lie” is. Is it acceptable again in high society salons, can it be uttered in high society conversations or street talk? Or is it still forbidden? I will not spend another day of my life telling my German people again and again how it exterminated my Jewish people . . .

Historians keep correcting each other; they scrutinize each other’s theories to find things to be redefined, adjusted or even disproved. They engage in fruitful discussions that help shed light on certain details, review interpretations, offer well-justified and unbiased revisions.\n\nTHE DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ITS GEOPOLITICS\n\nIn the heat of polemics, concepts are blown to pieces, professors’ reputations are ruined, and even whole countries may occasionally find themselves in the epicenter of disgrace, in the not-so-pleasant-situation of history falsifiers and political liars, as, for example, the USSR in the case of Katyn or Poland in the case of Kielce or Jedwabno. All of this is part and parcel of the normal historical process, and everything would have been fine had it not been for those whose idée fixe became not the study of history but its distortion. But are they up to wearing the robes of historicity, they whose “historicism” boils down to a denial of the Holocaust and, by the same token, a whitewash of Hitler’s regime? After the end of World War II, in various European countries publications began to appear that questioned the veracity of many of the findings of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg that tried the major Nazi war criminals. In most countries these authors are called “Holocaust deniers” or “Holokaustleugner” in German (disseminators of lies about the Holocaust). Though they themselves refer to each other in the flattering and deferential way as “revisionists,” thereby crediting themselves with an ineradicable disposition toward a quest for truth and, as a consequence, toward the scholarly revision of the prevailing views based on newly found or newly reinterpreted data, etc. Such self-designation makes them feel good about themselves and bolsters their claim to legitimacy. Moreover, such legitimization occurs not so much from their association with the subject they purport to revise but from appearing to be in the service of the highly respectable Dame, the Science of History.4 They see themselves as the reverse side of the coin, but one as important as the face of that coin which is written history. Moreover, they want to bring history down to their own level: the historians with whom they clash, they, the “revisionists,” call nothing other than “Holocaustniks” or “exterminationists,”5 i.e. adherents of another “theory” based on the patently absurd assumption that somebody was exterminating Jews. An important peculiarity of the deniers is that they are pathologically serious. Like hyenas, they dig through texts and testimonies, in search of what they believe might be “weak point.” And should something “suitable” arise, then like a school of Piranhas, gripped by collective predatory rapture, they pounce upon the seemingly easy prey. If, for example, one of the witnesses to the events dropped words to the effect that he had seen in Treblinka a whole mountain of shoes, probably about 40 meters high, then one can rest assured that they would ascribe to this observation the highest category of credibility as almost the cornerstone of the “exterminationist” history\n\nPAVEL POLIAN\n\nof the Shoa, while the Journal for Historical Review would soon publish a couple of articles exposing the deception with charts, graphs, and snide remarks about the 190 million people whose shoes might have been capable, according to calculations, make up such a “mountain.” Another article will aim to prove, once and for all, how such a construction is not possible. Fazit: all witnesses are mercenary liars, all “exterminationists” — charlatans, therefore, excuse me, but there was no Holocaust!6 Such stylistics and argumentation are from the arsenal of propagandists, not scholars. The question is begged: are those people fit to wear the robes of historicity, they who do not even try to hide behind the halo of reasoning the asinine ears of anti-Semitism? Can a decent person shake their hand? Most certainly not, these folks are not handshake-worthy. But to just despise or ignore them, not noticing or replying to them, that too is not an option! Golda Meyer once let it drop: “No, we shall not lower ourselves to propaganda.” A recent echo of the same sentiment typical of Israel’s establishment was uttered by Simon Perez: “Good and correct politics do not need advertising, it speaks for itself.” Unfortunately this has become one of the components of the State of Israel’s worldview. As a result, Israel has to constantly defend itself and wrestle for every inch of the information ground, which was ceded without a fight to begin with.7 How successful the deniers’ propaganda can be and how well anyone who so wishes can “educate himself ” is exemplified in an episode at the beginning of Kenneth Stern’s book. He refers to an exchange between an NBC correspondent and one of the protesters against NBC’s showing of the film “Holocaust,” which took place in New York on 9 September 1979. This typical demonstrator explained: Because this is a Zionist attempt to force upon Americans a guilt complex so that we would not be able to react objectively to our Middle East policies that is costing our taxpayers billions of dollars, thrown away at Israel’s military needs.” — “But wasn’t the Nuremberg Tribunal proof of the authenticity of the Holocaust?” — “No, these days not a single serious historian perceives it to be anything other than the unjust court of the victors.” — “And so Jews were never killed in Germany?” — “No, in Germany there was discrimination against the Jews, and the government aimed to deport them, but not destroy them.8\n\nTHE DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ITS GEOPOLITICS\n\nAnd this — in America! So must one struggle against this? Proving that two times two is still four? But the boundless hyperactivity of the deniers thrown against the equally outstanding passivity of neoliberal politicians, journalists, and, sometimes, historians, with all their heads in a postmodernist muddle, proves that, yes one needs to fight them! But how? “Getting oneself “dirty” by participating with them in public “debates”? Proving to them point by point that they are incorrect here and there and explaining why? Or smiling haughtily and contemptuously during joint talk shows? Or else to do neither and completely turn over the initiative into their unlazy hands? 2 The denial of the Holocaust is not that young, in 2007 it could have celebrated its 60th anniversary. Moreover from the very start it was a fully international pastime. The first to engage in it and even, for a while, set its tone were the French — at first a convinced fascist collaborationist, and later — a convinced communist and socialist. As early as 1947, one of them, Maurice Bardeche, aired his doubts in the press concerning the authenticity of at least part of the documents from the Nuremberg Tribunal about the concentration camps:9 he was the first to “realize” that it wasn’t the SS-men that were behind the Nazi crimes, but the exceptionally harsh war-time conditions causing the emaciation of the population and epidemics, as well as, last but not least, the prisoners themselves, who were, as is well known, an embittered and cruel lot. An even more refined argument in the same spirit was presented by Paul Rassinier, a French parliamentarian who had been an anti-Nazi French Resistance fighter and a prisoner of the German concentration camps, Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora. In 1948 he published a book, Le Passage de la Ligne (The Crossing of the Line), in which, without denying the politics of terror and the extermination of Jews in concentration camps, he puts the blame for all this on the so-called “prisoner-functionaries” — the kapo, the wardens of the barracks, blocs, etc.10 Moreover he refused, in principle, to accept the reliability of any witness testimony. In 1964, in his book, The Drama of the European Jews, Rassinier went even further and was the first to insist that there had been no gas chambers. His other important claim to fame is his conspiracy theory: that\n\nPAVEL POLIAN\n\nthe myth of the six million exterminated Jews is a “cynical falsification” that is needed only by Israel in order to extract reparations from Germany which are calculated based on the number of fatalities. It should be noted that in 1961 there appeared the monumental historical epic by Raul Hilberg, The Destruction of the European Jews. It had the effect of a matador’s red cloth on Rassinier, inspiring his series of demographic-statistical “denunciations,” realized mainly with the help of misquoting and out-of-context juxtaposition of various archival sources and quantifications.11 In 1978, Rassinier’s major works were united under one book cover — Debunking the Genocide Myth — and published in the US in English.12 In Germany of the 1950-1960s there was something going on as well. In 1952 in Tubingen, Dr. Herbert Grabert established the Institute for German Post-War History, while in 1958 in Hannover, a Committee for the Restoration of Historical Truth was organized, and it felt no shame about using such familiar expressions about the Jews being a “cancerous tumor on the body of people.” Right-wing radical newspapers in 1962-1963 disseminated information about Hitler not knowing anything about the crimes, and though the Holocaust was not great, it was, nevertheless, the well-deserved punishment for the Jewish trade practices and for the murder of patriots by the Bolsheviks.13 In 1967 in Austria, Franz Sheydl’s three-volume The History of How Germans Were Outlawed, which once again alleged that there had been no gas chambers and that it was all based on propaganda pranks of the Allies. Though when it came to the actual denying of the Holocaust, the Holocaust which still stood before the eyes of millions of testifiers and eyewitnesses, no one then would dare to go that far. The galvanizing spark flew later, in the 1970s, when a series of publications about Auschwitz appeared stating that it was a patently deceitful myth.14 The demon of Holocaust denial must have reached the US in the early 1950s. It arrived and fell on fertile soil, manured by those who in the US were called “isolationists.” I am referring to those politicians,15 journalists, and historians16 who considered US participation in WWII to be an unjustifiable mistake, and the crimes perpetrated by the US (the bombing of German and Japanese cities, the postwar proscription of Germans, the famine in postwar Germany) to be atrocities no lesser than the German crimes. Clearly such an approach, fraught with the search and the quick “detection” of those population groups (i.e. Jews) interested in the war, inevitably relativized all German crimes, including the Holocaust. < 10 >\n\nTHE DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ITS GEOPOLITICS\n\nIn the US, this great nation of emigrants, the denial of the Holocaust initially took on a rather specific form of the myth, the myth about how all or most of the Jews remained intact: none of them perished, or at least not the majority of them, but safely emigrated to either Palestine or the US, and still live among us, and nobody — under the pressure of the Jewish lobby — bothers to conduct a population recount.17 And as to the numbers, there were never any 6 million, there were no more than 600,000 people, the maximum amount of Jews that ever lived in Germany (such an assumption is especially curious not so much in its use of demographical data, but in how it was applied, namely by “ignoring” millions of Eastern-European Jews, it dissected and rudely distorted the data!). The key figure of early American isolationism was Harry Elmer Barnes, a respectable professor, a German history specialist who already from the times of WWI justified German policies and condemned American policies.18 Germany, according to Barnes, was beyond any blame: it was England and Poland that forced it to tangle in that war. The same thesis served as the foundation of the book by David L. Hoggan, The Forced War, which was published in German in 1964.19 The “forced war,” the “preventive strike,” the “peaceful and happy life under Hitler” — all of these were the favorite themes of deniers’ historiography. It would have been swell if this mythography could totally do without Jews! But to do without them (even in their absence) was just impossible. Barnes also took the first place in the public accusations of the State of Israel: in 1968 he accused the 20-year-old state in receiving billions of deutschmarks from Germany for non-existent corpses. Another key figure among the Holocaust deniers in the US was Austin J. App, who was a professor of English Literature at Scranton University (before the war) and at the La Salle College (after the war), he also served for many years as the president of the Federation of Americans of German descent, and a tireless and shameless anti-Semitic enthusiast. In the first months after the war, even as he justified German policies, he did not deny the Holocaust. He even called for the punishment of the culprits, including those on the winning side — people guilty of plundering or violating the rights of the civil population. But his world-view, as he set upon his chosen path, could not help but evolve, and in 1974 he published the book, The Six Million Swindle: Blackmailing the German people for hard marks with fabricated corpses, in which he laid down his “Eight Axioms,” that have become a kind of catechism for the Holocaust deniers.20 < 11 >\n\nPAVEL POLIAN\n\nHere is the gist of them: 1. As it tried to solve the Jewish question, Germany had in mind the deportation and not the annihilation of Jews. If they had intended to exterminate, then would they have left half a million of Jews alive in the concentration camps? Of course not. And they did survive, and then moved to Palestine, and are continuing to tirelessly milk Germany. 2. Not a single person died in a gas chamber in any of the concentration camps on German soil, and there is more and more proof that no one was killed by gas in Auschwitz. The Nazi gas chambers simply did not exist. Those that were built in Auschwitz were merely for disinfection purposes, while in the crematoria they were incinerating the corpses of the dead, and people could have died for thousands of different reasons, including British-American bombings. 3. Most of the Jews about whose fates nothing is known were from the territories that were under the Soviets and not the Germans. (The subtext here being that if they really were killed, could it have been by the Soviets?) 4. In the majority of the cases where the Jews were liquidated by the Germans, these were subversive elements, partisans, spies, saboteurs — i.e. criminals, whose punishment is not prohibited by international law. 5. If there was any likelihood that the Nazis had indeed exterminated 6 million Jews, then the World Jewry would have allocated funds for an investigation, and Israel would have opened up its archives. However, none of this has happened, and instead they are harassing everyone who is trying to expose their cheating. So what is this “six million” if not forgery? 6. Neither the Jews nor their mass media have the slightest proof of the veracity of their tales. All of the confessions by Höss, Eichmann, and others were given under extreme duress or else falsified. 7. It is the accusers and not the accused who must prove that the number of victims was 6 million, but the Talmudists and Bolsheviks forced Germany into paying without asking too many questions. 8. But even in the calculations of the number of victims made by Jewish scholars, there are such absurd discrepancies, that it is beyond any doubt that there is no scientific basis for their accusations. Very characteristic of App is his passionate desire to harness the Jews together with the Bolsheviks in one relay team. Both were interested, first, in the blowing out of proportion the lies about their own losses, and, < 12 >\n\nTHE DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ITS GEOPOLITICS\n\nsecondly, in the masking of their own crimes against the Jews, which were greater, as App assumes, than those of the Germans.21 No less interesting is App’s tendency to personify any pro-Jewish policies: for the US, such an incarnation was the Secretary of Finance, Morgentau, while for the USSR, for some reason, it was Ilya Ehrenburg. In the policy-setting article that opened the first issue of Journal of Historical Review, App arrogantly threw down the gauntlet to all “exterminationists”: Those who throw around large round numbers, like six million gassed, four million in Auschwitz, two million by mobile units in Russia, let them come up with the proofs — the graves, the bones, the ashes. Six million corpses do not just disappear. They accuse, so they must prove. But in their default, it seems that it is up to us Revisionists to show that the figure of six million is a totally unsubstantiated, brazen lie. What slender means I have had at my disposal, including some ten trips to Europe, including Dachau, Arolsen, and many interviews, induce me to estimate the number of Jewish casualties under the Third Reich at 300,000 in round numbers. Until Jewish publicists come up with solid evidence to the contrary, which so far they have not even realistically tried to do, I will consider 300,000 casualties — some from executions, from reprisals, most of them (like Anne Frank) from diseases.22\n\nThough perhaps App’s greatest peculiarity was that the anti-Semite in him was so much stronger than the anti-historian, he did not confine himself just to Holocaust denial or WWII in general. He would throw bridges to the Doomsday War in the Middle East or the energy crisis of 1973, for all of which the same were to blame, namely the Jews. In other words, he was the first denier of geopolitical persuasion who began to consciously “dig” under Israel’s right to exist. In the 1970s there appeared a whole series of publications that were specifically devoted to Auschwitz, in particular, Hexeneinmaleins der Lüge (Dubious Combinations of Lies) by Emil Aretz and Auschwitzlüge, 1973, by Thies Christoferson, the ex-sondefuhrer of the SS for agriculture in one of the Auschwitz branches in 1944, who had priority in coining the very promising term — “Auschwitz lie.” In 1973, a lawyer from Hamburg, Wilhelm Stäglich, published a short essay, “The Myth of Auschwitz,” which in 1979 came out under separate cover, published by the Grabert publishing house in Tubingen.23 Having laid his legal skills on the altar of the denier pathos, he found himself a part in the < 13 >\n\nPAVEL POLIAN\n\ndenier choir: his main role became the disavowal of documentary and witness testimonies. Having analyzed the proceedings of the Wannsee conference, Staglich threw out all the phrases whose meaning was clear in the Jewish context, and what remained was a text that was imbued with an almost paternal concern by the Third Reich for the Jews who were being resettled to the East, enough to make one cry. He also questioned the testimonies of the eyewitnesses to the selection and gassing in Auschwitz — the doctors and the members of the sonderkommando.24 By rights, one of the more “successful” authors among the deniers is Richard Harwood, whose book, Did Six Million Really Die? Truth at Last came out in 1975 practically at the same time in England and in Germany.25 A. Suzman and D. Diamond from South Africa took it upon themselves to verify the author’s identity.26 The results proved to be negative: there was not a single instructor, student, or even graduate from London University by that name.27 In essence, in all of these books, practically regardless of the author or his surreptitiousness, the same theme is endlessly harped upon — that of the Jewish world conspiracy and the peaceful evacuation of Jews from the camps. In this connection, there is an interesting episode related in the late 1970s to a film journalist Ebbo Deman by Joseph Erber, the ex-director of a woman’s camp at the concentration camp in Birkenau and a participant in one of the Auschwitz trials in the 1960s. Once (while in prison!) he came across the book by the above-mentioned Emil Aretz in which he read, with amazement, that no Jews had been exterminated in Auschwitz. This agitated him to such an extent that he wrote the publishing house, asking for the writer’s address, who was clearly misled by his informants, and whom he wanted to enlighten, as it were, strait from the horse’s mouth. The publishing house informed him that the poor author had gone the way of all flesh. Erber’s words in this connection, as pronounced during the trial, are cited as an epigraph to this article (see).28 3 The old guard of deniers, Bardeche, Berns, Rassinier, Hoggan, and App, did not scruple of anything: they resorted to any, including the most absurd, accusations and “arguments,” often contradicting not only the historical truth and common sense, but each other as well.29 Far from making them any more convincing, it rather served to discredit the movement in the < 14 >\n\nTHE DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ITS GEOPOLITICS\n\neyes of many, which is why the new generation of deniers that took their place started by conducting a “revision” of their own historical “legacy.” The revision, however, was not of the strictest kind: having rejected the most incongruous of their accusations, the deniers of the late 1970s set to work with the same enthusiasm, but with a new elegance and in new clothes. Their incontestable leader, Arthur R. Butz, was an American of German-Italian descent and an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.30 In 1976 he published a book, “The Hoax of the Twentieth Century: The Case Against the Presumed Extermination of European Jewry,”31 which proved to be a turning-point for the new generation of Holocaust deniers. For the first time in this field there appeared a book equipped with the full scholarly apparatus — references, footnotes, etc., that polemicized not only with the opponents, but with the “inaccuracies” of the previous deniers themselves. The consistently calm tone, without hysterics, that was maintained throughout the entire book, was also something new. Thus it comes as no surprise that the book received significant attention and was reviewed by many reputable newspapers. But what is even less surprising is that this book was published by that same “brown” American publishing house, Noontide Press, and that it was translated into German, moreover it was published in parts in issue after issue of the right radical newspaper, Deutsche Nationalzeitung. Behind the scholarly packaging and the lulling gauze of calm objectivity there hid the same poorly camouflaged anti-Semitism. Just the mocking quote marks alone (“Holocaust”) are worth a thousand words for those who suffered through the Holocaust and did or didn’t survive! Butz did not ignore the demographic aspects. He reiterated that after the war America quietly took in those same millions that the Jews came up short of after the war. It makes one wonder why the Americans did not also take in the SS St. Louis with merely a couple of hundred Jews on board? The victorious nations, according to Butz, even on the eve of their victory had conducted an incredibly concerted campaign of falsifying thousands of documents with the help of which they later put Germany in the dock at Nuremberg. (It makes one wonder why, given that falsifying drive, they did not dash off some decision of the Wannsee conference or another centerpiece document about the extermination of the Jews?) Even the Nazi criminals, according to Butz, were driven by the global Jewish backstage manipulators to the point where they did everything in their power to wrongfully incriminate themselves at the celebrated trials at Nuremberg, Frankfurt, or < 15 >\n\nPAVEL POLIAN\n\nJerusalem. (It makes one wonder also, if those Jewish conspirators were so powerful, how is it possible that Hitler was able to come to power and be so triumphant over some ten plus years?) An event that caused a veritable commotion, if not panic, in the American deniers’ milieu was the airing by NBC in the spring of 1978 of an 8-hour and 4-part TV series, “Holocaust,” by Herbert Brodkin and Robert Berger, which was watched by 49% of the nation’s viewers.32 A feeble attempt to counter this powerful media blow was the publication, in the middle of the summer of 1978, of the previously mentioned collection of denier studies by Rassinier. At the same time the “Holocaust” TV series and its incredible success served in no small measure to consolidate and institutionalize the deniers. In 1978, in the small town of Torrance near Los Angeles a private Institute for Historical Review (IHR) was established. Its first director was Lewis Brandon,33 who had recently arrived in California from England. However, the real master of the institute, who kept in the background, was Willis A. Carto, the treasurer of the organization, Liberty Lobby, and one of the most infamous racists and anti-Semites in the US. In the early part of 1981, due to internal differences, he fired Brandon and appointed Tom Marcellus as director. Formally, the activities of the institute and of its quarterly publication, Journal of Historical Review (JHR),34 was not only devoted to the Holocaust, but all other “departures from the historical truth,” regardless of the time and place of their occurrence. Though it precisely brings to mind the comment by Russia’s ex-Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin: “Whatever social organization we try and establish, we still get the CPSU,” — even the research on the prisoners of war from the times of the American Civil War inevitably managed to get compared and juxtaposed with the Holocaust. Corresponding “bridges” — and this probably is the most notable fact — were thrown not only into the past, but into the future, i.e. into the current politics: IHR seemed to be cautioning its tax-paying fellow Americans about the perils and catastrophic consequences which could result from the US following the track of pro-Zionist and pro-Israel policies.35 In other words, already toward the end of the 1970s, the theme of Holocaust denial was fully perceived as an instrument of political pressure on Israel. Be it in a veiled manner or openly, the question was stated as follows: if the deniers of the Holocaust are correct, then the State of Israel is no longer legitimate, as it was created on the foundation of the non-existent bones and ashes of millions of victims. < 16 >\n\nTHE DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ITS GEOPOLITICS\n\nIn September 1979, IHR held its first Conference of Revisionists in Torrance, California, which subsequently became an annual event. The second one took place in the summer of 1980 at the Pomona College in Claremont, California.36 These conferences were highly conducive to the consolidation of the deniers’ movement.37 When it came to participating in other anti-Semitic forums, the deniers were not forgotten. Thus, Butz took part in the so-called Nation of Islam Saviors’ Day organized in 1985 by Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Black Muslims in America.38 In another similar forum — the International AntiZionist Conference, that had been scheduled to take place in November 1992 in Stockholm, and where Farrakhan, David Irving, Robert Fauirisson, and Fred A. Leuchter were supposed to participate.39 (By the way, sessions of the Soviet Anti-Zionist Committee which existed in 1983-1994, comprised exclusively of “helpful” Jews and preside over by Colonel General David Dragunskiy, had a pronounced “anti-Zionist,” i.e. anti-Israel orientation, could hardly be listed among such events: the Committee never dealt with the issue of the Holocaust or its denial, because according to the ideological doctrine of the CPSU, there was no Holocaust in the USSR, instead there were the crimes of the Nazi savages against the Soviet people regardless of nationality). However, the conference did not take place in Stockholm, instead on 19 November 1992 another conference was held, in Germany, in the city of Weinheim, and was organized by the chairman of the right-wing radical National Party of Germany, Günter Deckert. Approximately 120 deniers participated, including F. Leuchter, who told about the results of his research and concluded his presentation with the following: “The Holocaust was not technically possible.” The audience applauded: 45 years of repentance was more than enough, especially for sins which, it turned out, had never taken place. At the end of the conference Deckert called for the establishment of an international commission which would verify whether or not the Holocaust ever took place. “It is time to get rid of the lie! Let’s do away with the Holo!” he concluded.40 A major event in the denier community was the international conference held by the so-called “Adelaide Institute” and organized by Frederick Toeben in 1994.41 It took place in Australia on 7-9 March 1998. Around fifty people participated, including Arthur Butz, Jürgen Graf, Robert Faurisson and others.42 The latest events of this kind were two international conferences with the pretentious title — On the Global Problems of World History — one of < 17 >\n\nPAVEL POLIAN\n\nwhich took place on 6-7 October, 2001 in Trieste,43 and the other on 2627 January, 2002 in Moscow.44 But conferences aside, perhaps the more effective instrument of public opinion manipulation was, despite its total non-recognition by professional historians, the Institute of Historical Review’s periodical, the JHR quarterly which was published in Torrance and tried, as much as it could, to pose as a scholarly publication (its first editor was Mark Weber).45 The journal very quickly became the central forum for the deniers of the entire world. The first issue came out in the spring of 1980, and the last, 96th one, in MayAugust 2002.46 About the time of the JHR’s first appearance, at the very end of the 1970s, there climbed two more “stars” in the deniers’ sky, and both were from Europe. The first one was the German professor Helmut Diwald from Erlangen, a well-known expert on ancient history and the author of the monumental work, History of the Germans, which was published in October 1978. Only a brief a couple of pages were devoted to the monstrous events of modern times, and only in terms of their being full of “deliberate errors, falsifications and exaggerations aimed at a total disqualification of an entire people.” The genocide of the Jews was seen by him as the history of an incomplete emigration: The term “general solution” or “final solution” during the war should be understood as follows: since emigration after the war became impossible, all Jews were supposed to be evacuated from Central Europe to the East, isolated from the German population, and concentrated in new ghettoes. This plan was outlined by the Chief of the RSHA, Reinhard Heydrich on 24 June 1940. What actually took place in the subsequent years remains, despite all the literature, unclear . . . .\n\nAnd about the gas chamber in Dachau he wrote that it had been built by the Americans, about the high death rate in Auschwitz — that it was due to its inmate contingent having a high concentration of the weakest and most unfit people, and all this long after a series of “Auschwitz trials” in Frankfurt in 1963-1965! The second “star” was the French literary scholar, Robert Faurisson, from the University of Lyon.47 In his book In Defense of Memory — Against Those Who Falsify History: The Question of Gas Chambers (1980), both the Shoa and the gas chambers were declared to be Zionist fabrications and on that basis they were denied. To eliminate such a number of people, he insisted, was simply technically impossible. Moreover he claimed that the < 18 >\n\nTHE DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ITS GEOPOLITICS\n\nAnne Frank diaries had been forged by her father. Faurisson was fired from his job for all this, and later, accused of falsifying history, he was tried and imprisoned for 3 months and fined 21,000 francs. The case by itself was not that exceptional, but it became significant as hundreds of people stood up for Faurisson’s right to express his thoughts, and a petition to that effect was even signed. They were joined by the Holocaust denier, John Bennett, from Australia, as well as the famous scholar and publicist, Noam Chomsky, who is Jewish and resolutely opposed to Faurisson’s views, and yet he defended Faurisson’s right to conduct any kind of research, even if considered unpopular by society. Specifically in “Noam Chomsky’s Search for the Truth” he had written: I see no anti-Semitic implications in denial of the existence of gas chambers, or even denial of the holocaust. Nor would there be anti-Semitic implications, per se, in the claim that the holocaust (whether one believes it took place or not) is being exploited, viciously so, by apologists for Israeli repression and violence.48\n\nThis statement instigated heated polemics in the academic and public circles of Europe, America, and Israel. The “Faurisson Case” proved how significant divergences and interpretations of the concept of “human rights” can be, as well as the boundaries of its application. In 1985 yet another French denier, Henry Roques, had his say. In his dissertationn which he defended in the University of Nantes, he likewise denied the existence of gas chambers and accused the SS Officer, Kurt Gerstein, who was one of the first to notify the Allies about what was going on in Auschwitz, of making it all up.49 Such aggressive institutionalization of the deniers, in turn, forced — a better word could not be found — both the scholars and the politicians not only to begin paying attention to them, but to respond as well. An impressive form of such a response was the International Conference of the Liberators of Nazi Concentration Camp Prisoners, which was organized by the American council of remembrance of Victims of the Nazis and which took place on 26-28 October 1981 at the US State Department in Washington. One of its main goals became the refutation of neo-Nazi propaganda that, allegedly, there was no mass extermination of Jews and people of other nationalities in Hitler’s concentration camps on the German-occupied territories.50 < 19 >\n\nPAVEL POLIAN\n\nWith the emergence of the JHR, the deniers got their hopes up for the long-awaited (even if partial!) recognition by the world of real, serious historians. With this goal in mind, the first issue of the JHR, which came out in the beginning of 1980, was sent out for free to 12,000 members of the Organization of American Historians, thereby causing heated discussion among the members as to whether or not they should react to the JHR. Carl Degler, the president of this Organization, supported the idea of creating a group of independent experts for the assessment of the contents of the received journal, but this idea was never realized. A similar discussion took place some 10 years later, in 1990-1991, this time inside the Association of American Historians, the main issue being whether or not the papers published in the JHR should be included in bibliographies. The Association finally declined to have anything more to do with the JHR because of the Holocaust deniers’ glaring lack of professionalism as historians, and especially because of the anti-Semitism that they exuded from everywhere: the Association basically likened speaking or corresponding with the deniers to discussing affirmative action with practicing Ku-Klux-Klanners. Incidentally, the “revisionists” were the first to begin compiling their own bibliography; their works through 198151 were provided in an annotated list prepared by Keith Stimely: http://www.ihr.org/books/stimely/stimely. shtml. The autobibliography of the JHR publications has been fully developed as well.52 What one cannot deny the deniers is the extent of their energy and creativity. An example of their very original form of activity became the JHR’s establishment of the “Revisionism Followers’ Conference Prize” in the amount of $50,000 that would be awarded to anyone who could present to the jury uncontestable proof of the Nazis’ extermination of the Jews in gas chambers during World War II. By publishing the Prize Charter in April 1980 and circulating it to potential contestants, the organizer were hoping to lure their opponents into the trap of a dialogue (and a scandal to boot) that would normally be inevitable in such a case. And there were two rather prominent figures who accepted the challenge despite its obviously provocative nature.53 They were Simon Wiesenthal54 and Mel Mermelstein, an Auschwitz survivor, who had been attacking the IHR in his contributions to the Jerusalem Post newspaper. Mermelstein not only took up the gauntlet but also threatened to sue the IHR in case its reply was not received by January 20, 1981. < 20 >\n\nTHE DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ITS GEOPOLITICS\n\nWiesenthal’s contest was the first to come to an end as he proposed submitting the case for adjudication to a justice of California’s Supreme Court. The IHR did not accept and proposed instead a jury composed of Arthur Butz, Robert Faurisson, and Ditlieb Felderer,55 who were all members of the JHR Editorial Board and well-known deniers. On learning about that triumvirate, Wiesenthal called off his application, refusing to take part in a farce where one of the sides was claiming the roles of both the judge and the prosecutor. However, Mermelstein was undaunted and filed, in February 1981, a lawsuit against the IHR, Carto, and Brandon. Already at the preliminary hearing judge Thomas T. Johnson entered it on the record that the question of whether Jews were or were not gassed at Auschwitz would not be debated because that was an indisputable fact. The opposite side was not even heard, and that’s quite a shame. After all, it was then unclear what the process of adjudication was all about. It would have been much more effective and compliant with due process not to dismiss the accusations as patently absurd, but to expose their absurdity and record it in a court decision.56 However that may be, the court ordered the IHR to pay Mermelstein $90,000 ($50,000 in prize money and $40,000 in damages) and to publish an apology to all Auschwitz survivors, repeating the wording of the indictment.57 The case was materially conducive to the loss of “standing” and “scientific reputation” by the IHR. It also demonstrated that an open confrontation with Holocaust deniers, presided over by an independent third party, could be much more effective than simply ignoring them. A contemptuous and belittling stance taken vis-à-vis those people, based on the belief that they deserve no better, and avoidance of a direct clash with them is even more of a windfall for them than contact and engagement. They invariably interpret that as a fear of the truth on the part of the “exterminationists” and celebrate a “victory.” In today’s situation where Holocaust denial can also be seen as law infringement such “contact” is unavoidable anyway, at any rate when pursuing legal action against deniers. And it is not a matter of Jews and true historians against the opposing deniers; it is a fight for the minds of all the others, that is, the public at large. It cannot be overlooked that this struggle has long brought the deniers and those whom they attack into a competitive kind of relationship. And the deniers’ aggressive and often inventive and creative tactics have been scoring more and more points for them. < 21 >\n\nPAVEL POLIAN\n\nAn ad campaign for denier-sponsored lectures in university newspapers can serve as a typical example. The ads ran something like this: “The History of the Holocaust: What’s Wrong with It? A Case for a Wide Debate.” The campaign was launched by Bradley Smith from California, who drove it in a big way. Together with Mark Weber,58 he organized in 1987 The Committee on Open Debate on the Holocaust (CODOH) which was sponsored by William Curry, an entrepreneur and an anti-Semite from Nebraska, who had come up with the idea in the first place. His own attempt to place such a paid ad in The Daily Nebraskan in 1986 failed,59 but Smith was the ideal man for his project — one who was both aggressive and success-driven. Curry’s failure told Smith that he had no hay to make with large regional newspapers whose ad revenues ran into millions of dollars. So he changed his target audience opting for small-circulation papers published by major American universities. Out of something like 35 universities contacted by Smith starting in 1989, 15 responded favorably60. Announcements of the CODOH lectures appeared on the first pages, but were usually accompanied by editorial comments critical of the project’s ethics and scholarly value. Nonetheless, thousands of young people read that “information” and hundreds surely took the bait. But the campaign’s main achievement was elsewhere. Probably without planning it in advance, the deniers squarely hit the “carotid artery” of American democracy, the First Amendment to the US Constitution which enshrines the freedom of speech. It was this subject that most of the university debates were centered upon, some of them spilling over into university newspapers and even into some major national ones.61 In early 1992, Smith decided to take a second go at it and circulated a new ad to university papers, titled in Latin: “Falsus in Uno, Falsus in Omnibus” (False in one thing, false in everything) in which he was accusing Simon Wiesenthal and Stephen Wiese of spreading rumors of the so called “Jewish soap,” which had allegedly been made by the Nazis from Jewish corpses. But this time he had zero success: none of the papers agreed to run the ad, including those that had carried the first one. Yet on the whole, Smith’s “campus” campaign did not only achieve its objective, but even surpassed it. Firstly, almost a half of the universities contacted did not shut their doors before him; secondly, many students, teachers, and even managers were quite enthusiastic about the project; and, thirdly, TV stations showed an interest in the deniers for the first time. < 22 >\n\nTHE DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ITS GEOPOLITICS\n\nHowever, there was an unintended side effect, too: as a result of the campaign, many universities introduced or expanded their courses in the history of the Holocaust. But that was more of a response to the success of Smith’s campaign than a sign of interest in its content.62 4 One of the central figures in the Holocaust denier community is doubtless Ernst Zündel, a.k.a. Cristof Friedrich),63 a photo touch-up artist by trade originally, who has been residing in Cananda since 1958. He is the author of the book The Hitler We Loved and Why,64 as well as the “Holocaust 101” digest. However, his contribution to the denier movement is not so much as a creative person (he seldom ventures into anything more than leaflets and brochures) but as an organizer — the deniers’ global manager of sorts and their most effective showman. Just like G. Grabert Zündel was early to realize the role that could be played by the media in the advancement of their common cause. The publishing house Samizdat Publication he had founded in Toronto back in 1976 soon became all but the largest one in the right-wing extremist universe. It prints and sends to Germany and all over the world both the deniers’ writings and other kinds of anti-Semitic and racist literature, as well as recordings of Hitler’s speeches, period films and songs, in particular, the film “A German and A Jew Visiting Auschwitz. Since 1990, he has been disseminating his views over the radio waves and, starting in 1994, the Internet as well (www.zundelsite.org). The site is developed and administered by his wife and comrade-in-arms Ingrid Zündel-Rimland. Holocaust denial being against the law in Canada, Zündel has had to stand several trials there. In 1985, he was sentenced to 15 months in jail for fomenting hatred through the publication and dissemination of false and provocative writings, but soon was released on appeal citing procedural irregularities65. In early 1988 he was again tried and sentenced in Canada, but this time to only 9 months in jail. Appearing at the trial as witnesses were J. Burg,66 R. Faurisson, D. Irving, and F. Leuchter, an engineer from Boston who had consulted several State governments and individual penitentiaries on matters of setting up equipment for death sentence execution.67 The latter’s role and “services” deserve a special mention. The Zündel trial was already in progress when Irving and Faurisson got in touch with Leuchter and, after two days of shoulder-rubbing, sent him on a generously financed (by Zündel) “expedition” to the German death camp sites in < 23 >\n\nPAVEL POLIAN\n\nPoland. His retinue was comprised of his wife, a drafstman, a cameraman and an interpreter. While in Oswiecim and Majdanek, he took samples of the air and the concrete rubble on the gas chamber ruins, which he then sent for chemical analysis to a laboratory based in his native Massachusetts. The direct product of that “blitz analysis” was Leuchter’s An Engineering Report on the Alleged Execution Gas Chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau and Majdanek, Poland,68 which soon saw two separate publications: one by Zündel’s Samizdat and the other by Focal Point Publications in London (which belonged to D. Irving).69 The analysis which, incidentally, had been performed with numerous violations of the air sampling protocol did not reveal any significant traces of the Zyklon-B gas but did find them in the disinfection chamber at Auschwitz-1. Leuchter’s testimony at the trial detailing his newly obtained “scientific findings” certainly produced a strong impression on both the Judge and the public. The prosecution was definitely taken aback and chose to concentrate on trying to call into question Leuchter’s qualifications for conducting such experiments,70 rather than on the report itself. Only gradually, as experts were invited to evaluate the report, did the fog enveloping it started to dissipate — much like the cyanide vapors whose traces he had been so unsuccessfully searching for. Capitalizing on his success, Leuchter established, in 1989, a company that offered advice on execution techniques as well as equipment for practically any type of capital punishment. As a result of a lawsuit that was brought against him by Shelly Z. Shapiro, President of the Holocaust Survivors and Friends in Pursuit of Justice,71 and Beate Klarsfeld, Leuchter had to admit to the abuse of a Doctor’s title and engineering activity, recanted on his Report and other dubious writings and pledged to keep away from all those things in the future. But all that did not change much in the perception of Leuchter by his former and future comrades. His contribution to Holocaust denial proved far more significant than his courtroom achievements. The Leuchter Report, despite its obviously unscientific, speculative, and dubious nature (or perhaps thanks to it), clearly hit the bull’s eye, and many perceive it as the ultimate scientific proof that no Holocaust has ever taken place. That is why the Report has become for the deniers as much of an icon as the forged Protocols of the Elders of Zion are for the anti-Semites in general. As for Zündel himself, his trial came to an end in 1992, and he was declared a wanted man in a number of countries. In 2003, he was extradited < 24 >\n\nTHE DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ITS GEOPOLITICS\n\nfrom the US to Canada and from there to Germany where he stood trial in November 2005 and then in February 2006 for fomenting interethnic enmity and was sentenced to 5 years in prison, the maximum punishment for that offence. He is serving his term in Mannheim.72 The same Manheim court sent Zündel’s lawyer, Silvia Stolz,73 to jail as well. She got 3.5 years for her classically perfect, unadulterated, animal antiSemitism. However, as Zündel languishes in jail, his site74 keeps publishing his letters from captivity, documentary evidence from his trial, and references to other deniers’ web pages. In Zündel’s forced absence, the denier orchestra, although not as loud as before, has not fallen apart. The first fiddle, however, is now played by other soloists, like D. Irving and the new star in the denier constellation Jürgen Graf,75 the author of The Holocaust Swindle, The Holocaust on the Test Stand, and other books and brochures.76 These writings were ruled anti-Semitic and racist by the District Court of Baden in north Switzerland, which sentenced him, on 21 July 1998, to 14 (some say, 15) months in jail, while his publisher Foerster got 12. In addition, both were fined 8,000 Swiss francs (5,500 USD), and told to surrender the 55,000 francs (about 38,000 USD) received from the sales of Graf ’s writings.77 The court ordered the publications themselves to be confiscated and destroyed. As a result, Graf was fired from the private school where he was teaching literature. In a bid to escape the punishment, Graf emigrated first to Byelorussia, and then to Russia, where they welcomed him with open arms and where he resides to this day. Back in 1995, Graf and an Italian by the name of Carlo Mattogno paid two visits to Russian archives: the State Archive of the Russian Federation (SARF) and the Russian State Military Archive (RSMA), where they went through tens of thousands of pages, making copies of some four thousand. Here are the conclusions they contrived to come to: We now know not only what documents are in these two archives, but also what documents are not there . . . Documents showing clearly that no prisoners were killed in gas chambers, or which disprove the existence of a wartime German extermination program, would probably have been removed or destroyed.78\n\nThe Myth of the Holocaust and other writings by Graf (for example, Treblinka. A Critical Analysis of the Official Version) are available in Russian as well, on the internet site Russkaya Liniya.79 J. Graf never tires of pleading < 25 >\n\nPAVEL POLIAN\n\npolitical innocence: “We are not responsible for the political consequences of revisionism. Of course I do not like Zionists very much, but I am not an anti-Semite and I don’t hate Jews . . . ”80 “I don’t hate Jews”! Bravo! Another noted denier of the new generation, along with Mattogno and Graf, is Germar Rudolf,81 a professional chemist, who came to prominence as a denier back in the 1990s when he published the book Dissecting the Holocaust under the pen name of Ernst Hauss. In 1993, following his illegal attempt to analyze the samples he had taken from the walls of the Oswiecim gas chambers in 1991, he was fired from the Max Plank Institute in Stuttgart. Nevertheless, he did publish the so-called “Rudolf ’s Conclusion,” an article on how he found no traces of cyanide on the gas chamber walls at Auschwitz, something that was touted as an irrefutable proof of no Holocaust having ever taken place, the only basis for the whole thing being a collusion between the Allies and the World Jewry. Starting in 1992, Rudolf was reading lectures on Holocaust denial. He was a contributor to the anti-Semitic Arab newspaper Alshaab and initiated the preparation of a consolidated collective monograph The Fundamentals of Recent History in which he played a key role. Rudolf became a member of the narrow circle of German deniers who were coordinating and defining the different efforts and actions undertaken by the “revisionists.” Central to that circle was the figure of a retired Major General Otto Ernst Remer, Director of the Remer-Heipke publishing house and the President of J.G Burg Society. He was also the publisher of the anti-Semitic Remer-Depeche magazine. In early 1993, Remer and his group, fearing renewed persecution in Germany, moved the center of their activity to Britain where they founded a twin publishing house named “Cromwell.” Already in Aaugust 1993, it started publishing a monthly magazine Deutschland Report which mimicked the RemerDepeche format. From November 1994 to June 1995 the Stuttgart Land Court had held a trial of Germar Rudolf82 which once again showed the entire arsenal and even a certain finesse of the deniers’ methods of proving the “non-existence” of the Holocaust (which combined both legal and illegal techniques, playing games with aliases, confusing cross-references, etc.). Rudolf was sentenced to 14 months in jail for publishing the above-mentioned “Rudolf ’s Conclusion,” which was branded anti-Semitic. Trying to escape imprisonment, Rudolf fled to Spain, then to Britain (where he set up a publishing house in Hastings) and, finally, to the US where he got married and asked for political asylum, which he was denied. < 26 >\n\nTHE DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ITS GEOPOLITICS\n\nIn October 2005, he was arrested in the US and extradited to Germany. The trial that was held in Mannheim sentenced him to 30 months in jail and confiscated the publisher’s bank account. Six months prior to that, in March 2005, Rudolf published his Lectures on the Holocaust, written in the form of a dialogue between Rudolf the Teacher and the Listener, a pretty intelligent student who asks questions that are answered by his wise and knowledgeable instructor. As time wore on, the revisionists’ argumentation was becoming increasingly sophisticated and, at the same time, ever more impudent. In the last count, as was noted by a historian from Munich Jürgen Zarusski, for the deniers “ . . . it is not a matter of science or scientific integrity in one form or another, albeit based on erroneously conceived tenets, but a specific form of political propaganda whose starting point and the ultimate goal is anti-Semitism.”83 Were it otherwise, they simply could not have possibly ignored the numerous and uncontestable witness accounts given by both the victims of the Holocaust (suffice it to cite the recovered notes written by sonderkommando members and buried in the ash pits near the crematoria84) and its survivors. Instead, we hear ravings of world Jewish conspiracy, of millions of survivors passed off as victims, millions of documents fabricated by the Jews, some of them on behalf of their very executioners. They stubbornly keep on “referencing” statements by certain organizations that had been fully disavowed back in the 1950s (like, for instance, claims of gas chambers having been used in Dachau). Another typical method of theirs is using the least reliable sources of information on the Holocaust, such, for example, as the “Hitler Diaries” discovered by Irving or the collection of documents brought to Switzerland on April 29 and 30 by the former GESTAPO Chief Mueller. The deniers also love to look for Jews in their ranks, and they do find them. This, in their view, acquits their movement of any accusations of antiSemitism and imparts it a patina of tolerance and, consequently, legitimacy. If such “helpful Jews” fail to materialize, they are bred in a test tube. Like, for instance, a certain Roger Dommergue Pollacco de Menasce who sprang into existence 1999. He had allegedly written a letter to Steven Spielberg consisting of incredibly hackneyed denier rhetoric but crowned with an extremely original title “Was There Really a Holocaust?”85 A relatively late addition to the deniers’ toolkit were the chemical tests of air samples made by America’s Leuchter in February 1980 and Germany’s Rudolf, in 1991. From the scientific point of view (taking into account the volatility of gaseous substances), the very idea of such sampling < 27 >\n\nPAVEL POLIAN\n\nis preposterous, to say nothing of such “material evidence” as empty gas cans found in great numbers at Auschwitz. But here again, it is not a matter of chemistry, nor is it that of history. The so-called Leuchter Report and “Rudolf ’s Conclusion” were hailed by the revisionists and readily included in their arsenals. As well as the democratic rhetoric invoking the freedom of speech and of scientific research, etc. The deniers keep saying that they are political prisoners and nothing less than martyrs in the cause of Germany’s national resurrection. There are few people as adept at passing themselves off as sufferers for the truth as the actual enemies of the truth — the Holocaust deniers. 5 Not infrequently, and more and more often of late, the deniers have been openly supported and reinforced by professional (or, at least, universityeducated) historians. One of the most important among those historians who have effectively sided with the deniers is the already mentioned professor from Erlangen Hellmut Diwald who, according to J. Zarusski,86 has established something of a “bridgehead for the revisionists” in the academic milieu. However, a virtual godsend for the deniers was professor Ernst Nolte. His name is linked to the debate on totalitarianism that flared up in the 1980s and was obviously shouldered by the deniers. Though not a de facto denier, Nolte, while examining misdeeds committed by other countries, was seeking to relativize Germany’s crimes (including the Holocaust), thus creating the necessary prerequisites for revising and glamorizing German history. In discussing the Holocaust, he maintained that Aryan victims at Auschwitz outnumbered Jewish ones, and that the Wannsee Conference may have never taken place at all. The einsatzkommandos and einsatzgruppen operating in the occupied territories were not killing Jews because they were Jews, but because they were partisans. He did not overlooked the fact that most books on the Holocaust were written by Jews. He believed that Hitler had a right, as he put it, to “intern” Jews. In his eyes, that was sufficiently justified by Haim Weizman’s statement made in September 1939 to the effect that after Germany’s invasion of Poland all the Jews of the world will join the fight on Britain’s side.87 As was noted by J. Zarusski, Nolte was the first and probably the only professional historian who paid a tribute of respect to the “revisionists” and < 28 >\n\nTHE DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ITS GEOPOLITICS\n\nwho, in all seriousness, referenced some of their writings. In so doing, he was extending his hand to the deniers — ostensibly, on behalf of the science of history itself, a hand which they had long been eagerly waiting for and which gave a blessing to what later came to be known as “moderate revisionism.” The latter, as opposed to “radical revisionism” did not dispute or deny all of the Holocaust wholesale, but did so partially and selectively.88 However, the most flamboyant and passionate figure among Holocaust deniers is the British historian David Irving, who is the movement’s unofficial guru.89 His first world bestseller, The Destruction of Dresden came out in 1963 and contained significantly exaggerated estimates of Germans killed during the British bombings of the city. In 1997, he published Hitler’s War90 in which he whitewashes Hitler and puts the entire blame for the mass killings on Himmler. Shifting the center of gravity to the question “Who is to blame?” and thus recognizing, albeit selectively, the Nazi crimes, Irving, in a sense, revised the early revisionists themselves, who had been denying all and everything. In the 1991 edition of the book, he replaced references to the Holocaust as a reality by far less definitive characterizations. In 1987, he claimed that the diary of Ann Frank was a forgery and publicly denied the existence of the gas chambers. And in 2000, he sued an American researcher Deborah Lipstadt for calling him one of the most noted and dangerous deniers in her book Relative: the Denial of the Holocaust.91 Irving lost the lawsuit and was ordered to pay the Penguin Books publishers 3 million pounds in damages and legal costs. Unable to do so, Irving declared bankruptcy, forfeiting his house in London. Despite his declared renunciation of his old views, the full texts of his books are available on the Internet, including Nuremberg: The Last Battle where he says that the Nazis’ gas chamber atrocities were exaggerated by the Allies. Published on the Internet are also the different versions of his Hitler’s War. In 2005, Irving was arrested in Austria on a warrant issued back in 1989. He was tried and sentenced to three years in prison on charges of neo-Nazi activities one of which is, according to Austrian law, a public denial of the Holocaust.92 He was released on parole in 2006 and deported from the country. How deeply the poison of denial can penetrate the minds of even highly educated historians is evidenced by the case of Erwin Adler, assistant professor of Munich’s Brothers Scholl Institute of Political Science, who < 29 >\n\nPAVEL POLIAN\n\nbecame the center of a resounding scandal in 1996. When asked about the destruction of Jews during the war he had this to say: “I just have no knowledge of that, I wasn’t there when it happened.”93 The Institute interceded in his behalf, but the University removed him +from the faculty nonetheless. But if one takes Adler’s words, “I just have no knowledge of that, I wasn’t there when it happened,” and compare them the deniers’ staple utterances, the ugly sound of it will be all too familiar, epitomizing as it does the entire poisonous philosophy of Holocaust denial: “Whether it happened or not, we don’t know for sure, but most likely it didn’t.” Holocaust denial is one of the few remaining niches for today’s antiSemite to take (“Criticizing Israel” is another such outlet). Masquerading as “revisionism,” anti-Semitism is regressing to its national-socialist sources with their well-developed system of Aesopian figures of speech.94 In essence, the revisionists are targeting not only the Jews, they are targeting everybody. A perfect breeding solution for denialism, notes J. Zarussi, is provided by pseudo-pluralism with its “Anything Goes” credo or, in broader terms, the all-conquering atmosphere of post-Modernism with its historical projection of “Nothing Was!” The circle of those interested in “revisionism” is so far narrow enough, at least on the European stage, but its adepts are so active that the noise they manage to make is quite audible and is growing ever louder. Besides, they have now discovered a new vast space for extensive growth — in Russia, Ukraine, and, perhaps, Poland and the Baltic states.95 In many countries, anti-Semitic and denier passcodes are quite recognizable, even in election campaigns. Incidentally, the United States is one of them. Here, the presidential race of 1992 saw as many as two deniers on the Republican ticket: the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke — who proposed relegating Jews to “West Israel,” a reservation to be set up in Manhattan and Long Island96 — and Patrick Buchanan.97 Also, the very elegant Jean-Marie Le Pen of France does not only combat the Magrebians’ onslaught, but somebody else’s as well. He does not deny the Holocaust, but speaks of it as a very minor detail of the Second World War; and yet his National Front party garners 15 to 20% of the national vote. In Austria, Germany, and Italy right-wing radicals can count on 5-10% of the votes, but if the same electoral slogans were taken up by a larger traditional party, that share could shoot up to the “Le-Penian” 15-20%. < 30 >\n\nTHE DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ITS GEOPOLITICS\n\nAnti-Semitic politicians do not always lose elections, they win them, too. Like, for example, the late Croatian President Franjo Tudjman who never used the word Holocaust other than in quote marks. Similar leanings are popular in another former satellite and ally of the Nazi Germany — Slovakia.98 The last and the most dangerous case in point is President Ahmadinejad, whom we will keep coming back to in this article.\n\nSOVIET AND POSTSOVIET TRADITIONS OF SILENCING AND DENYING THE HOLOCAUST 1 Carrying on the “traditions” of Czarist Russia, the USSR was a country that practiced state-sponsored anti-Semitism. As distinct from the official anti-Semitism of Nazi Germany where it took on truly cannibalistic forms, the USSR practiced it in a more “humane” variety which comprised a system of open and concealed discrimination and prohibitions, as well as the struggle against “cosmopolitism,” “Zionism,” and other euphemistic designations of the Jewish nation. There were no pogroms or anything like that in the USSR, and claims that a massive deportation of Jews was being prepared in 1953, logical as this might seem from circumstantial evidence, have to this date practically no documentary support.99 Based on their place of residence as of June 22, 1942, almost a half of the Holocaust victims died on the territory of the USSR. But in the context of that country’s politics, showing any respect for the Jewish victims was out of the question. The war was still in progress, but officers of the Red Army’s Main Political Department were already busy thinking how to best present its results. If the Jew-slayer Nazis were using Zyklon B to exterminate none other but Jews and were surfeiting themselves with Jewish blood, the internationalist-minded Bolsheviks were using political peroxide of their own making to expurgate that particular ethnic component from the monstrous crimes committed at Auschwitz and Baby Yar. Their strategy was not to minimize the number of victims, but to supplant one specific group of victims (Jews) by another, far less defined one (“Soviet people”). Already in possession of exhaustive information on Auschwitz, the USSR issued, using the ESC as its mouthpiece, a statement dated May 8 (!), 1945 “On the Monstrous Crimes of the German Government in Oswiecim” which < 31 >\n\nPAVEL POLIAN\n\nsaid that “over the period in existence of the Oswiecim camp the German executioners have exterminated no less than 4 million citizens of the USSR, Poland, France, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Holland, Belgium, and other countries.” Well, what do you know — the Shoa of peaceful Soviet citizens! A Jewish catastrophe without Jews!100 When the war was over, the ban was extended to the very memory of the Holocaust and its enshrinement. Only in postwar Minsk was there built a monument telling the story of the Holocaust and bearing an inscription in Yiddish. A monument in Nevel had its six-point star of David “circumcised” to a five-pronged Communist one. Initiatives in building monuments to Jewish victims of Nazism were punished, too: the scientist and inventor V. Fundator, one of the designers of the famous Soviet T-34 tank, lost his job as the result of his intention to put up a memorial sign in his native shtetl Cherven in Byelorussia, while the seven people who wanted to build such a monument in Odessa were sentenced to 8-10 years in a labor camp for attempting to set up an “anti-Soviet and nationalist organization.” In 1948, the well-known Soviet actor Mikhoels was killed, and permission was denied for the publication of the “Black Book”; in 1949, the Jewish Museum in Vilnius was closed down. The Spectre of “Cosmopolitism,” conjured up in the Kremlin, was roaming the country and it was Jews — yes, none other but the surviving Jews! — who were filling the disgraceful lists of victims of not one, but two dictatorships.101 Soviet ideology, which was called upon to both sing the praises of the regime and cover its shame, had no place for a number of historical facts: golodomor, occupation, ostarbeiter slave labor, Soviet POWs, Vlasov’s army and other collaborationists, Jewish genocide, etc. — all such topics were taboo, unmentionable not only in writing but even in conversation! Ideology cannibalized history. With regard to the Holocaust, the ideological response of the Soviets was conceived of in a peculiarly internationalist spirit: to repeat, the main thing here was to obscure the purely ethnic, anti-Jewish element of Nazi policies, coupled with deliberate nonseparation of Jews, as a specific group, from the rest of the Nazi Germany’s victims. Accordingly, they were denied recognition of many of their civil and human rights, including the right to remember. As for the historiography and victim commemoration, the above-described “Internationalism” was expressed in the absence of Jewish attribution of the victims, their verbal proxies being “peaceful citizens” and, a particularly frequent one, “Soviet people.” Thus, the public was instilled with the belief that the Holocaust was nothing unique, that the Nazis were destroying all Soviet citizens: < 32 >\n\nTHE DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ITS GEOPOLITICS\n\nRussians, Ukrainians, Tatars, Poles, and, well, Jews, too, it seems. Even in the poignantly clear cases like Baby Yar, the struggle for fair treatment and, if anything, compromise wordings was encountering stubborn ideological resistance and the unbendable dictatorial “No.” Maria Altman, the author of the book The Denial of the Holocaust. The History and Contemporary Trends is quite right when she writes: . . . Everything that was happening with this theme in the fields of history and socio-political writing in prior years (the 1950s through the 1980s) could be safely classified as a variety of Holocaust denial. This was expressed in silencing and concealing both the fact of the Holocaust itself (above all, that of Soviet Jews) and the existing documentary evidence of it that is kept in the state archives.102\n\nM. Altman identifies the following six distinct tendencies in Holocaust depiction or interpretation in the Russian nationalist-patriotic materials: 1) direct and complete Holocaust denial; 2) calling into question its existence or, at least, some of its facts; 3) understatement of the scale of the tragedy; 4) distortion of events and facts; 5) misinterpretation of the term “Holocaust” itself; and 6) justification of Holocaust. Their favorite tools are claims that the Germans, in collusion with the Zionists, were destroying only Soviet Jews, and, above all, claims of the “Russian Holocaust” allegedly organized by Jews in the USSR. There is also a version of the “surviving Jews” myth contending that they were secretly evacuated to Tashkent in 1941.103 In everyday life, elements of Holocaust denial were already present in the Soviet “anti-Zionist” literature104 which accused “Zionists” of “capitalizing” on the sufferings of Jewish victims, exaggerating their number and, most importantly, being in a collusion with the Nazis. A classical example of such an approach is provided by a Candidate of History Sciences thesis which was defended at a closed session of the Scientific Council of the Order of the Red Banner Institute of Oriental Studies of the USSR Academy of Sciences. The title of the thesis was a telling one: “On the Ties between Zionism and Nazism.” The aspirant was the current Head of the Palestine Autonomy Mahmud Abbas who was mentored by the former Director of the Institute, former Chief of the Main Intelligence Department of the KGB, and the former Prime Minister of Russia, Academician Evgeniy Primakov.105\n\n< 33 >\n\nPAVEL POLIAN\n\n2 Until the late 1980s, the Holocaust as a historical phenomenon and a research subject was off-limits to Soviet historians. The situation changed under Gorbachev, and even more so, under Yeltsin. It was during their office that the Soviet (and then, the Russian) state gradually renounced statesponsored anti-Semitism as an ideological doctrine: Suslov’s ideological reins, saturated with tellings-off of dissenters at staff meetings and faculty councils, slipped out of the trembling hands. That had at least three consequences. First, post-Soviet Jewry used the fruits of liberty to initiate a virtual renaissance of Jewish life in Russia, both in its confessional and secular-cultural aspects. One of the expressions of that process was the revitalization of the Russian, Ukrainian, and Byelorussian Judaica which certainly could not obviate the central Jewish problem of the 20th century — the study of the Holocaust. The ensuing resurgence of such research projects could only be compared to the recoil of a powerful spring. Very indicative in that context was the creation, in June 1992, of the Holocaust Science and Education Center and the appearance of the first articles and even monographs on the Holocaust in the territory of the former USSR. The second consequence of the de-etatification of anti-Semitism was its privatization. Anti-Semitism became a private matter for Russian citizens, and those of them who had such a propensity could now indulge that phobia with reckless abandon and, basically, with impunity, because the State, while discarding its anti-Semitism, did not give much thought to the legal bounds within which it would agree to put up with that form of its citizens’ private initiative. In those years, though, anti-Semitism lost its leading role in the context of general xenophobia. Now the main enemies were the peoples living in the Caucasus or, as they were called then and are still referred to today “persons of the Caucasus ethnicity.” Anti-Semitism as a phobia was reincorporated into a broader spectrum of worldview concepts, such as right-wing radicalism, chauvinism, and even Fascism, all of which feel quite at home in Russia. Sure enough, the deniers also found a place in that constellation, but Russian patriots had to content themselves with remakes of their Western colleagues’ creations because local-based expertise in the matter had yet to be generated, except for the pathological “exotics” like “raceologists” and “geo-politicians.”106 Not long ago, the Fuhrer of the “geo-politicians,” Alexander Dugin, came out in defense of Ahmadinejad. The latter, according to Dugin, does not < 34 >\n\nTHE DENIAL OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ITS GEOPOLITICS\n\ndeny the Holocaust (oh no, nothing of the sort really!) but is simply trying (“maybe somewhat clumsily, at times”) to draw the world’s attention to the "
