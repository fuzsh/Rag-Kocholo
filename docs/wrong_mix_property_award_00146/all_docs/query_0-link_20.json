TILLYARD Cambridge University A work that may well become a classic of criticism, this book deals primarily with seven English works best em ing the nature of the epic: Piers Plowman, The Faerie Queene, Arcadia, Paradise Lost, The Holy War, Pope's Iliad, and The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Its range, however, is from Homer through the English neo- classical period, giving a comprehensive view of the epic spirit at work. $5.00 The Italian Element in Milton’s Verse By F. T. PRINCE University of Southampton This study establishes for Milton's poetry as a whole what has already been established for the sonnets: a definite link to the Italian Renaissance tradition. It demonstrates that the diction and prosody devised in imita- tion of classical models owes much to the Italian poets, and traces the development of Milton's technique to show assimilation of sixteenth- century ideas and ideals. $2.20 Metaphysical, Baroque, and Précieux Poetry By ODETTE DE MOURGUES Cambridge University This study of French and English poetry during the late Renaissance shows their inter-relatedness and attempts to distinguish clearly the qualities of the three kinds of poetry which flourished at that time. The analysis also provides an answer to the question of what happened to French poetry between Ronsard and La Fontaine.

These rooms will be allocated to interested members of the Association under the following conditions: 1, A petition signed by seven or more members, stating the topic and aim of the conference, and designating a discussion leader, must be sent to reach the Secretary of the Association not later than October 10. 2. Legitimate petitions will be honored in the order of their receipt and up to the limit of available accommodations. The normal conference ,eriod will be one hour and a half. Requests for specific periods should include several periods in the order of preference. §- The conference rooms to be made available will accommodate no more than twenty-five or thirty-five persons, and it will be the responsibility of the discussion leader to refuse admission to additional persons. 4 The topic, place, and leader of the conference will be named in the printed Program. If the conference is being held by invitation only, this fact will also be stated. Otherwise, it will be the responsibility of the discussion leader to handle requests for admission; the Program will explain that interested persons should write to him, and that he will grant requests for admission up to the limit of accommodations. §- Only sharply defined topics, supported by explanations of the purposes of the conference, will be honored. 6. Conference rooms will be allocated with the understanding that the object of the meetings is not the reading of papers.

Caldwell, Assistant Commissioner for International Education, U. S. Office of Education, in School Life for December 1953 (XXXVI, 36, 45). In it he said: “We need a basic review of the philosophy of public education in relation to our new per preadient ye preg participants in the world.

Today, in the time of our greatest national crisis, our educational statesmen face their greatest opportunity to serve the American people.” NO NEED FOR FL? Have the 160 million people in the U.S. no occasion to talk with the 160 million in the 20 Latin-American republics? Back in 1928, only about 300,000 travelled between our continents, but last year the traffic had increased to 1,073,763 (883,459 by plane). U.S. private enterprise has $6 billion invested in Latin America (about 40% of our total private investment abroad). In 1952 the 20 republics spent $3,300,000,000 on U.S. merchandise —six times the 1938 figure— and in the same period our imports climbed from $443,000,000 to $3,450,000,000. PUERTO RICO, N.Y.

We have revised, augmented, brought up to date, and recently our report (1953 Sept. Supplement) on FL entrance and degree require- dean \"We have © copy tor you Mi You ened is tn Your lowl Ghuhdion os sche ammunition. The current national picture: Of the 768 accredited institutions that t the B.A. degree, 230 (30%) have a FL entrance requirement, 648 (84.3%) Sve a FL degree requirement, and an additional 9 with no formal degree require- ment are among those with the entrance requirement, a total of 647 (85.5%) that formally declare FL an essential element in any kind of liberal education, Of the 57 colleges in this list which are devoted usively to the training of teachers, 43 require FL for graduation (only 1 requiring FL for entrance). Some of the 111 institutions lacking the degree tera mer Fi ey ee course, sie con laee oder dams adsenems, te te Ids. Of these same 111, at least 31 never had degree requirement. That leaves, then, 79 (information on one is still lacking) institutions which abandoned—all except 25 of them since 1940 The FL P, rogram—Continued wit nl eee et ee ee ee t. These 79 (or 56 since 1940) places caused that “trend” against ao cee we used to hear about. From now on, let’s talk about the 657 that quietly held the line, sure of what they believed in. And let's invite the prodigal 81 home. PROFICIENCY. ri la ion whether or not the degree i it in most institutions is sufficient the proficiency acquired meaningful enough in terms pl 's needs. In ‘oaly a few places (17) is the requirement expressed solely as proficiency; in most it is, conventionally, a matter of hours and credits. If we oe mA normal equating of one high-school unit with 3 semester hours in college, we can get some notion of the quantity (though not the quality) of FL currently re- garded as essential to liberal education. In 85 (out of 645) colleges the total re- st including high school and college study, is less than 12 semester hours. 240 it is 12 hours; in 146, from 13 to 17 hours; in 105, 18 hours; in 28, from 19 to 22; in 24, 24 hours; in 27, more than 24 semester hours. In only 10% of all the 645 is the degree requirement more than 3 years of college study. If we consider idea of a FL requirement sound, and want to maintain it, we must in all conscience see to it that results demonstrably warrant its continued existence. Isn’t it time to stop putting any premium upon mere course credits and insist instead upon es irement in terms of some clearly defined and land defensible degree of pro- othing else will make much sense to our critics, and even this will make olten-cnamnienush df swidiauses che-quendeed of peeing ts fuaaiindhtaoess atte colleagues in other departments before fixing it arbitrarily or, worse, despairingly. READING MATTER, Last year there were 82 U.S. daily newspapers, with a gross daily circulation of at least 1,200,000, published in FLs; and there were at least 550 other pericdicals, a triweeklies to quarterlies, published wholly or partly im at least 45 different THREE’S A TREND. Don’t conceal this news! Middlebury College has restored its FL entrance requirement, abandoned in 1940, and has also restored its FL de- ptr wna ne Aig nme men\" p 1938, That makes three colleges which within a ear have restored the FL degree requirement. The world has changed, and col- are catching up. (We earnestly hope that FL teachers will, as this happens, recognize their new, more important responsibilities.) The Middlebury action, taken by faculty vote on 21 March, will become effective in September 1957. CONVERT.

I venture to predict that teaching in elementary schools (may it prosper!) will improve the teaching at the high school ‘Tevel.” FL WORKSHOP.

An Alliime Low E thought you'd like to know. On 25 January, 1954 General W. Bedell Smith, Under Secretary of State, testified as follows before the House Appropriations Committee: “. .. Our training in the Department has reached a sort of an alltime low. . . . we found to our astonishment that we did not have one single officer or staff officer in the Czech Embassy who spoke Czech. The orly official who speaks Czech in the Czech Embassy at the present time is the Assistant Air Attaché. I got to looking at our training setup, and I found that it is not what you or we would like to have to support the foreign activities of the United States. We only had, for instance, people taking language training last year. In Finnish, Thai, and the Indian dialects there was not one single per- son. We have | man studying Serb and Croatian, 2 studying Persian and Turkish, 7 studying Russian, 2 studying Indonesian, 1 studying Vietnamese, and 10 studying the Arabic languages, where we need so many. That is just about an allzime low. .. . “We have 2 or 3 in the Department [of State] who speak Czech. . . . The training program has not been effective. . . . This new program will give us about 100 more [under training], and that will see us throvah, but we will not get the dividends for a while. . . .” On 27 January the Committee heard George F. Wilson, Director of the Office of Personnel, testify as follows: “After having made a study I am convinced that the present number of officers of the Foreign Service who have been given intensive {full-time training in the language and areas pertinent to critical spots throughout the world is inadequate to meet the needs of the Service. For example, in the language and area training for important countries such as Indonesia, only 6 officers have been given this intensive specialized training; in Korea only 2 officers; and in Russia only 35. Totally, there are approximately 141 officers in the Foreign Service who have been given specialized intensive training under the direction of the Foreign Service Institute in the language and area of Iron Curtain coun- tries or areas of the Near East and the Far East, which are critical because of the danger of Communist takeover. In the fiscal year 1954 under our normal plans we would only train 34 more specialists in but 10 of these language areas. This number will scarcely replace the loss of these skills by attrition, and most certainly will not supply an adequate number of replacements and reserves for the trained and experienced officers who are on the firing line. “The necessary action is clearly evident. We must substantially expand our training in the langu and areas of the world, particularly in the areas of the Far East, Eastern Europe, the Near East, and southeast Asia . . . If the funds I have mentioned, the $785,000, are appropriated, we will be able to: (a) Increase from 34 to 66 the number of ers taking full-time language and area training, thereby increasing the total availability of officers with this kind of training to about 241 over a period of 2 or 3 years; (b) to increase from 20 to 80 the number of officers taking 3 months’ language and area training, which would be the primary training; (c) to increase from 275 to 6oo the number of employees to be given on-the-job language training, increasing the number of posts where such training is available from the present 31 to a new high of 57 posts. . . Failure to meet these needs means that the Govern- ment is not sending overseas the best-informed and best-equipped representa- tives it could supply at a time when only the best will suffice. xv SPECIAL SUMMER LANGUAGE SCHOOLS designed primarily for teachers” ALLIANCE Cottece Summer School of Pol- ish, Cambridge Springs, Pa.: 28 June-6 Aug.

SHUSTER OT so long ago ours was a country of many languages and dialects. To- day it is, no doubt, on the verge of becoming, at least in its ceaselessly expanding urban areas, the most linguistically monolithic part of the civilized world. A dwindling microscopic minority still study the classical tongues. Were it not for the religious seminaries, Greek studies would long since have vanished to the point of extinction. The fate of Latin is only somewhat less dire. And what shall we say about the modern languages other than English? Fortunately, scholarly concern with and proficiency in them are widespread and notable. But so far as one is able to make out, the amount which in prac- tical life sticks to the ribs of high school and college students is about as slight as is the aroma of a cup of Ersatzkaffee. Certainly when our people get scat- tered about the wide world, with which they are now perforce concerned in multifarious ways, they are like nothing so much as Missouri farmers after an ice storm that has snapped all the telephone wires and coated all the roads. That this omnipresent isolation of the American is a grave misfortune is surely clear enovgh. The nature of the calamity would seem, however, to be in need of further analysis. First, one should probably not see in our collective inability to use other people’s languages the major reason why the United States is so much criticized and disliked in the world. This phenomenon of opprobrium is complex, indeed; and I should myself be tempted to assign priority to the fact that so many of our untutored and, upon occasion, raucous fellow citizens have so much money to spend abroad. After all, it is not very reasonable to expect that countless thousands of men and women transported because of an emergency to alien parts of the world will carry in their baggage linguistic skills which they had not previously seemed to need. But when one discerns, for example, that resistance to contagion is virtually absolute, over a period of years of exposure—-that college graduates in positions which cry out for means of communication with the environment keep right on con- tentedly knowing nothing of the language, literature and art of the country in which they find themselves—one can only conclude that there has been brought to light something like a seismic fault in the basic structure of our education. Still more bewildering is the circumstance that these same Ameri- cans will often have had, during some semesters of study, training in the very * An address delivered at a General Meeting of the Modern Language Association of America in Chicago, 29 December 1953. 3 4 Foreign Language Teaching and International Conciliation language which they ought to be using abroad. Can it be that this time and efforts were wholly wasted? Undeniably, answers to such questions as this need to be found. The people of the United States are not merely losing heavily in terms of prestige, influ- ence and insight. Something much harder to discern, describe and define is at stake here. I shall try to deal with it, however fumblingly, first through re- course to a generalization, which you will no doubt be good enough to accept for what it is worth, and secondly through an analogy. Venturesomely we may say that, in general, we Americans, and, of course, also other peoples of the West, face no greater hazard to the beneficent extension of our interna- tional influence than that which grows out of the cleavage between tech- nological assistance and cultural exchange. This could, it seems to me, be quite clearly demonstrated from various segments of the national history. In Latin America, for example, we are still attempting to live down the after effects of well-intentioned but otherwise indefensible acts of political and social intervention in such countries as Mexico and Chile. Coming as these did on the heels of forceful, significant but often, of necessity, socially disrup- tive efforts to develop the natural resources and industrial potential of these and other lands, and occurring prior to any serious effort to establish a meas- ure of cultural solidarity with the peoples involved, they were quite unavoid- ably looked upon as moves which appended political imperialism to capital- istic aggrandizement. Here no doubt is the root cause why what is so widely accepted as American ‘‘capitalism’’ has undeservedly come by its sorry repu- tation. One may add that although we have on the whole acted with con- siderably more discretion in Europe as well as elsewhere since the rise and defeat of Nazism, the danger to which I have alluded is still omnipresent. It is one thing to suggest or foment social change when one has the hearty en- dorsement and the confident cooperation of the peoples involved, and another to act wholly outside the realm of cultural thinking and living to which they are committed. This point has seldom been more effectively made than it was by the panel of experts in the natural sciences which met at the University of Minnesota during the 1953 National Conference of UNESCO. No doubt you will wish to refer to the conclusions to which they arrived, if only because these distin- guished devotees of physics, chemistry and other sciences that are arcana to most of us made a vigorous plea for the intensification of foreign language study. What interested them primarily in languages, however, was the fact that technological change can breed many almost insurmountable problems of social adjustment unless those who foster it adapt themselves carefully and understandably to the cultural patterns of the peoples affected. If we depart for the moment from the sphere of American influence, we shall no doubt recognize for instance that the situation now obtaining in South Africa would be far less disturbing were it not for the fact that the rapid expansion there of urban industrial and commercial centers, largely the resuit of the recent second World War, had brought to the boiling point cultural tensions and emotions with which no one had reckoned with the necessary care. George N. Shuster 5 And now, for the sake of the promised analogy, I shall cite a passage from Goethe's Conversations with Eckermann, in which the admirable listener tells of a conversation between the great poet and an English guest. ‘For fifty years,’ said Goethe, ‘‘I have been busy with the English language and litera- ture, so that I am well acquainted with your writers, your ways of living, and the administration of your country. If I went to England, I should be no stranger there.”’ It is true that the poet went on to remark—and one may hope that any classicists who may be among you will pardon the reference to this weakness of genius—that it was no longer necessary to study Latin and Greek, because excellent translations from both languages were now avail- able. Debatable though this opinion may be, the truth implicit in the sen- tences quoted remains obvious. If one wishes really to visit another country, one must prepare diligently to make the journey. No doubt relatively few of us will be able to devote fifty years to the task, but in all truth only a long period of reading will equip anyone for even a brief time of effective living in another land. The history of short cuts is a disillusioning one. You will recall how un- happy Wordsworth was when, having been persuadet¢l to do so by his friend Coleridge, he went to the continent for some months in the hope of learning the German language. Let us try to make the point in another way. Driving through Poland early in 1938, we had the not unprecedented experience of finding that whenever we stopped in a village hundreds, sometimes thousands, of persons would gather to stare delightedly at our plutocratic Pontiac. In- variably there ensued exercises in German conversation with the audience. One day a proud father pushed his son forward with the remark that the lad had been diligently studying English in school, and would I not please engage him in conversation. The lad, manifestly as ill at ease as if he were attending his first dance, responded to a question in unintelligible gibberish. This I glossed over in his behalf as best I could. The conclusion, sadly and reluc- tantly arrived at, is this: if one witnesses the linguistic antics of one’s American countrymen abroad, it is impossible to avoid conjuring up memories of that far-off lad. Can we hope that something will be done about all this? Manifestly the de- bate about methods of language teaching cannot fruitfully be continued here. Through a brilliant summary and analysis of what has been pertinently writ- ten on this topic, Professor Parker has put us all so greatly in his debt that a reference to his paper will suffice. New points of view— indeed, rudiments of whole new disciplines—have emerged. One cannot, for example, read the Re- port of the United States Delegation to the UNESCO Seminar on the teach- ing of Modern Languages, held at Nuwara Eliya, Ceylon, during the summer of 1953, without realizing that linguistics and anthropology must be taken seriously by language teachers. It may of course be that some observers of the controversies now in progress will be tempted to emulate Mr. Krook, of Bleak House, who decided that he would teach himself because he did not wish to “lose anything by being learned wrong now.’’ Yet even they will probably eventually conclude that while pedagogy, like taste, is the last 6 Foreign Language Teaching and International Conciliation refuge to which ultra-rugged individualism can repair, there is value in an institutionalized approach to the task. I shall, however, permit myself the luxury of two comments. Are not many teachers of ‘oreign languages still living in the age of the general store and doing business by the light of a kerosene lamp? And are not others so enam- ored of new ways of teaching that they quite forget some bright little text is not all the content which the course requires? It seems to me that Goethe was entirely correct in emphasizing writers, customs and government. All these should certainly get into the texture of the instruction, even if it means that the instructor would have to run the risk of contamination by what are known as the social sciences. When one stops to reflect, one remembers that Dante, Schiller, Pascal, Cervantes—to mention only a few—were men whom all things human interested profoundly, and whom the social conscience spurred to thought and action. Is it not apparent that their approach to lan- guage and literature is likely to prove vastly more stimulating than one which insulates writing from the rest of life? Yet obviously even the perfect method, if it is ever discovered, will help little unless we can somehow make young people think that language study is of exciting importance. Much of the stock advertising is not very persua- sive. Classicists, for example, have been wont to contend that if one bought their wares one’s knowledge of the English language would wax by leaps and bounds. But, though familiarity with the word pneumon will lead one to sur- mise fairly easily that pneumonia is something wrong with the lungs, it will not help at all either to explain what that something is, or to produce a remedy. (Interestingly enough, this also has a Greek name.) In like manner it will not help much to insist that since the United States is today just one aspect of global consciousness, its young people must hurry up and learn to speak the varied languages of the world. How shall any given student find out which one he ought to learn, for his own benefit as well as that of his country? We Americans have a particularly difficult time wrestling with motivation in this area. Well-nigh every generation of youngsters born to immigrant par- ents has gloried in its ignorance of the ancestral language and thus sought to prove itself unadulteratedly American. The nasty anti-newcomer words, from Paddy and Heine to Wop and Hunyak, which have resounded through our schools, inculcated the speediest possible acquisition of bad English. And when we did teach some other tongue—say French to the Germans, or Ger- man to the Italians-——how great was the student's disillusionment following the discovery that what one had painfully acquired was probably not the genuine article at all. Who among us does not recall the shock of finding out that the comment allez-vous of the classroom was the ga va of everyday France? And how many, having engraved the genders of German nouns on the facades of their subconscious minds, have not come a cropper over some innocent seeming word not on their lists? Finally, of course, our schools are well sup- plied with teachers who, thoroughly versed in ultra-modern pedagogy, look upon anything more painful than a discussion of the weather as certain to breed in pupils a hundred forms of hitherto uncatalogued neuroses. George N. Shusier 7 But of course the problem is a world-wide one and other peoples have their troubles too. Under the auspices of the United Kingdom's National Commis- sion for UNESCO there was brought out recently a little book, Teaching for International Understanding, which discusses the situation with a good deal of insight. Like many other valuable and delightful English pedagogical es- says, it combines understatement with a measure of whimsy, Thus we read: Clearly, if the justification for a person's learning a foreign language is solely to enable that person to communicate with foreign people, the ultimate logic of the argu- ment would be that, in order to communicate with foreign people, he must learn all the foreign languages which, as Euclid said on more than one famous occasion, is absurd. But the authors go on to say: . . + we would urge in the case of modern languages that it is an understanding of the spirit of a foreign people—their culture, their art, their way of life and their achieve- ments as a community—which should be the aim of learning their language. . . . For a student to get down to the roots of a single culture other than his own is in itself an exercise in international understanding, even in its universal sense, since if he learns the great art of sympathy with one foreign people he can more readily apply it to all the rest than he could hope to do through the most intensive study of so-called international history. In other words, if one wishes to acquire a global point of view, it is not necessary or even desirable to go stand on a space ship and look down. May I append some previously uttered wisdom of my own: Through the effort to master another tongue, one crawls as a young man or woman out of one’s parochial and nationalistic chrysalis. For not a few of my generation this was achieved above all through the study of Latin and Greek, which are still perhaps uniquely excellent keys to a world of universal truth and beauty and con- stant quest beyond the special urgencies of the time in which any individual of necessity lives. Yet the language need not be a classical one. If within the years which lie immediately ahead, a million young Americans can get out of their shells of American English and learn to move about inside the world inhabited by some other people, we shall be vastly better prepared than we now are for our role in history.* It is when seen from this point of view that the limitations of Esperanto and similar “international” languages become quite obvious. For Esperanto embodies no culture, art or way of life. Yet we might perhaps remember that, commenting on George Moore and the dreams of the Gaelic League, Humbert Wolfe wrote, ‘‘All lost languages are lost causes, but nobody except a dolt will do other than feel a pang for the age-long triumph over hope of experi- ence.\"’ No student of Western cultural history will fail upon occasion to regret that there no longer exists a universal scholarly language employable in Ox- ford, Naples, Paris and Prague, to mention only a few famed seats of learning. We may or may not hanker after the time when Robert Lowth discussed the poetry of the Hebrews in Ciceronian periods, or when Milton could hardly 1 By C. F. Strong (London, 1952), pp. 50-51. * Cultural Cooperation and the Peace, by George N. Shuster (Milwaukee, 1952), p. 44. 8 Foreign Language Teaching and International Conciliation decide whether Latin or English was the proper medium of verse. But it seems just as obvious that we shall never reacquire Latin as it is that we shall never woo Esperanto away from the bosoms of its admirers. Accordingly, the task is to give as many young people as possible, through language study, that widening and deepening experience which has always been the coveted treasure of humanistic studies—the sense that nothing which is genuine and significant in the intellectual and aesthetic tradition of mankind is remote from the wise man’s concern or estranged from his sym- pathy. Humanism is the discipline of unity which antedates the ‘‘one world\"’ of international government and transportation. While we must sadly enough admit that despite the ennobling and civilizing influence it exerted on the best in many centuries, it could not remove the curse of war, we can also not cease reminding ourselves that unless it continues to abide with us, as a spur and a source of hope, we shall not see peace in our or any time. For the poets who make the universe habitable are those who alone can bring the children of men to sit at the same fire. And learning is that which maintains for the poets their own habitations. It is in this sense that I cite, on behalf of the humanist in the present anxious hour, familiar lines from the Agamemnon: And when God's summer melteth into wine The green grape, on that "
