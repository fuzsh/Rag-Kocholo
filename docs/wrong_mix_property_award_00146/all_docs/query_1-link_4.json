Mauriac is known for his works 'Le Desert de l’amour' and 'Thérèse Desqueyroux.'\n\nMauriac's work is coloured with deep spiritual themes, which were influenced by his belief in Jansenism, a movement within Catholicism asserting that an individual’s fate was predestined by God. The movement focused on original sin and the mystery of God’s grace. \n\nMauriac's writing revolved around the themes of humanity's helplessness without God's grace and the hypocrisy that bourgeois families espoused. The religious aspects of his novels have puzzled many critics due to their focus on the darker side of humanity and the religious content is not immediately seen. \n\nOften his novels would novels examine human nature in the light of Catholicism with his characters grappling with the very human emotions of greed, self-righteousness, and feelings of guilt. \n\nAs a result of his writings, Mauriac has sometimes been depicted as a misanthrope, but he responded to this criticism himself by saying that the recurring messages in his books about divine grace and love were intended to spread hope and confidence.\n\nMauriac was an outspoken opponent of Franco’s regime in Spain and supported the French resistance movement against Nazism during World War II. \n\nMauriac received the 1952 Nobel Prize in Literature “for the deep spiritual insight and the artistic intensity with which he has in his novels penetrated the drama of human life.”\n\nPhoto: Agence de presse Meurisse, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons \n\n#NobelPrize\".",
