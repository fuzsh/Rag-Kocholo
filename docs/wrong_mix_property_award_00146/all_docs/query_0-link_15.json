It was found impossible to give sufficient detail of the whole World in one volume, and it was decided to give an Atlas to each Continent, whose special features could there be adequately treated. Extending the lines of the Classical Atlas , this book attempts to cover the geography of Europe, mapped out not only to define the frontiers and countries, but to illustrate history and literature — especially English literature. The changes in the face of Europe that have marked the growth of nations, that went on through the Middle Ages, and have continued to the times of Wellington and Napoleon, the Franco-Prussian War, and to the merging to-day of the military in the industrial struggle, may be followed in the 96 pages of coloured maps which come first in the volume. In addition, some 32 pages of maps in outline will be found covering — (a) The great battles of the world. These are devised with an eye to Creasy’s Fifteen Decisive Battles , and they go back to classic times; but it will be found that they help to illustrate many modern books too. {b) Maps which relate to English literature. These do not exhaust the field, but they serve as examples of what the student, carrying on the process, may do for himself. By illustrating certain proverbial books and special authors, they show the reader how he may, with the coloured map for his guidance, go on to trace a map to illustrate his own favourite literary region or history- book. (c) An Outline Map of England and Wales showing the situation of the greater monasteries and religious houses, vii Introduction viii (< d ) Two extremely interesting Outline Maps which illustrate Mediaeval and Revolutionary Paris. ( e ) The Map of London as it was rebuilt after the Fire, and up to the end of the eighteenth century, must be of very great interest to all readers of Pepys, Evelyn, Johnson, and Goldsmith, and of many other great spirits who haunted these streets, for here are pictured the absolute houses in which Johnson and some of his contemporaries lived. The small scale of the Map of the Arthurian regions, now for the first time included in an atlas, compels the omission of the local details in each district or region; but the student who shall be tempted by it to make a special map for individual romances, such as Sir Percival, Sir Tristram, or the Twrch Trwyth in the Mabinogion , will find in the end that he has gained a new idea of what romance means. The map of the Dickens country, again, covers nearly all the chief places of interest in the novels; but it would require a series of charts to represent each book in detail. One would like to add a Dickens London; but that, any student can make who will profit by example and trace for himself the localities of the different London stories. To do this, he will require, however, a pretty early nineteenth-century map stated in some street- detail. Another feature which we believe to be quite unique is that we have been able, by the kindness of Mr. Bernard Roth (the eminent orthopaedic surgeon), to add a sketch of the English Coinage from 150 b.c. up to King Edward VII. ’s time, and to illustrate it with eight pages of examples from his own unique collection. This indeed brings reality into romance, for no longer is Shakespeare’s “ Cymbeline ” a mythical person, but a living king who coined his own coins in his mint at Colchester, and many other dim historic personages stand out vividly when we see their image and superscription upon their own coins. This could only have been possible through the kindness of Mr. Roth, and we owe him our most hearty thanks. We have to thank Miss Edwardes, too, for the careful com- pilation of a Gazetteer, drawn up with definite bearing upon local events and historic and literary associations, which, with the maps themselves to lend it reality, helps to make topography alive and human. A few places of note, it may be, are not to be Introduction IX found in the maps, but this is usually because they are mere villages, fields, or roads which it would require a map of an immense scale to contain; but the latitude and longitude in each case is given so that the reader may easily locate the spot . It is intended to follow this Atlas speedily with one of America, which will be treated on the same lines, and with the same full illustrative detail, and that in turn will be followed by separate atlases of Asia and of Africa and Australia, so that the world’s geography and history will be very fully covered when the set is complete. The publishers would like to say how much they are indebted to the skill and knowledge of Dr. Bartholomew, who has been exceedingly fruitful in suggestion and prodigal to liberality in making new plates whenever any new value could be given to the maps. Indeed, their enterprise would have been impossible, and lacking in many of its most essential features, but for his skilled aid and interest in the venture.

A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE ENGLISH COINAGE FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES TO THE PRESENT DAY 98 PLATE I. 9/j n /X I m U, A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE ENGLISH COINAGE FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES TO THE PRESENT DAY By BERNARD ROTH, F.S.A. Vice-President of British Numismatic Society and Member of Council of Royal Numismatic Society. The ancient Britons were intimately related to their neighbours the Gauls on the other side of the English Channel, and through them early obtained a knowledge of a well designed coinage, chiefly of gold, which was minted for nearly 250 years. According to Sir John Evans, the gold uninscribed coins of the south coast were probably first issued between 200 and 150 b.c. These gold coins are usually described as staters, because they are degenerate copies of the beautifully executed gold staters of Philip II., King of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great (b.c. 382-336). Fig. I., Plate I., is a gold stater ot that king; on the obverse, i.e., the more important side, of the coin, which usually carries the king’s head or the chief symbol, is a laureate head of Apollo or Hercules looking to the right; on the other side ( reverse ) is a charioteer in a biga, or two- horsed chariot, with two wheels. Fig. II., Plate I., is an ancient British gold coin of about b.c. 150, which is a barbarous copy of the perfect Greek art seen in Fig. I. On the obverse is a large head to the left with extremely ornate hair, etc., while on the reverse is a very disjointed horse with the remnants of a winged charioteer. Fig. III., Plate I., is a fine specimen of a later ancient British inscribed coin of Cunobelinus (Shakespeare’s Cym- beline), a British king who flourished about a.d. 5: his 99 TOO The English Coinage capital was Camulodonum, on the site of which is modern Colchester. On the obverse is a horse with CVNO below, and on the reverse is an ear of wheat with CA MV on either side. The latest and most barbarously designed ancient British coins were those of the Brigantes, a tribe who in- habited Yorkshire, Lancashire, and other northern counties. Some years before their conquest by the Romans in a.d. 69, their queen was Cartismandua, who is said to have treacher- ously delivered up to the invaders Caractacus who had taken refuge in her court. Fig. IV., Plate I., is a gold stater of the Brigantes, in which it is still possible to find some distant resemblance to the design on Philip’s coin. On the obverse there are re- mains of the wreath with locks of hair, but it is difficult to picture any likeness to a face. These ancient Britons were far more civilised than many historians have described them to be. I have several contemporary forgeries of ancient British staters in my collection. They consist of copper covered with a thin plating of gold: a high degree of mechanical skill was required to produce such a forged coin. For several centuries after the Roman invasion all traces of a native coinage disappear till we come to the period of the Sceats and Stycas. The sceats were the earliest Saxon coins struck in England, and were chiefly in silver, although gold specimens are known. Fig. V., Plate I., is a gold sceat which is supposed to have been struck by Abbo, a Frankish moneyer who accompanied St. Augustine to England in a.d. 596: on the obverse is a rude bust to the left with E behind; on the reverse traces of letters around a dotted inner border enclosing a large H-shaped ornament in centre, with letters above and below. The stycas resemble the sceats, but are usually of very base silver or copper. Fig. VI., Plate I., is a copper styca of Vigmund, Arch- bishop of York (a.d. 837-854). The silver penny or, as it was called in early days, the novus denarius was of Frankish origin, and was first struck by Pepin the Short in 755. This coin rapidly became popular all over Europe, and drove out, not only the up to then current Roman coins, but also the sceats and the stycas. Offa, King of Mercia (a.d. 757-796), was the first English prince to strike silver pennies, and all his coins are of beautiful types. IOI The English Coinage Fig. VII., Plate I., is a silver penny of King Offa, while Fig. VIII., Plate I., is one of his widowed queen, Cynethryth, who reigned for one year after his death. Contrary to the almost universal custom, the queen’s name is on the reverse of the coin, while the name of the mint master, or moneyer, EOBA, is on the obverse, in front of the queen’s bust. For many centuries the silver penny was the only current Eng- lish coin, and when smaller change was required it was cut into halves and quarters to form halfpennies and farthings, an operation which was often helped by the large cross on the reverse. Fig. IX., Plate I., is a penny of Alfred the Great (871-901 ), with the monogram of London on the reverse : the portrait of the king on the obverse is fairly good, but the whole coin is far inferior in execution to those of King Offa and his queen. Aethelred II. (979-1016) struck a large number of different types; one of the most interesting of his pennies is shown in Fig. X., Plate I., with the king’s head on the obverse and the so-called hand of Providence between A and o) descending from the clouds on the reverse. Our Danish King Canute (1016-1035) issued a number of different pennies, of which Fig. XI., Plate I., is one which was minted at Dover. Fig. XII., Plate I., is a penny of Harold I. (1035-1040), and Fig. XIII., Plate II., a penny of Harthacnut (1040-1042). Silver pennies of Edward the Confessor (1042-1066) were struck in upwards of sixty dif- ferent English towns, and are of various types. Fig. XIV., Plate II., represents his “ sovereign ” type. On the obverse the king is seen sitting on his throne, holding the sceptre in the right hand and the orb in the left; on the reverse we have what is termed a short cross voided with a martlet (bird) in each of the four quarters: this has usually been described as the Confessor’s arms. Harold II. (1066), although he reigned only a few months, struck some coins of which Fig. XV., Plate II., represents a penny, with the king’s head to the left with the sceptre in front; on the reverse we find PAX (Peace) across the coin, which is rather incongruous, seeing he met his death so soon after at the Battle of Hastings. William the Conqueror (1066-1087) struck pennies with a good portrait of himself, of which Fig. XVI., Plate II., is a fine specimen: it is usually termed the bonnet type, owing to the curious head-dress or crown 102 PLATE II 24 23 24 103 The English Coinage on the king’s head. William Rufus (1087-1100) did not vary much the coins of his father, and Fig. XVII., Plate II,, represents a penny of his struck at Ipswich. Henry I. (1100- 1135) struck several types, of which Fig. XVIII., Plate II., minted at London, is an interesting specimen. Stephen’s troubled reign (1 135-1 1 54) is reflected by the clumsy and badly struck pennies of his coinage. One rarely ever meets with a well struck and round coin of this king. Fig. XIX., Plate II., is a Stephen penny struck at Gloucester. The Empress Matilda, daughter of Henry I., was Queen of England for a year during this reign, and struck coins in several towns. Fig. XX., Plate II., represents what is considered a fine specimen of a Matilda penny. In spite of the bad execution of the coins of Stephen and Matilda, the silver employed was not debased. Henry II. (1154-1189), after his first issue, struck the “ short cross ” penny, of which Fig. XXI., Plate II., is a specimen minted at Worcester. This same “ short cross ” penny was struck without alteration of type and with the same name, Henricus, during the succeeding reigns of Richard I. (1189-1199) and John (1199-1216), and was continued unchanged during the greater portion of the reign of Henry III. (1216-1272), till the year 1248, when the “ long cross ” penny was struck: in this, the voided or double-lined cross on the reverse extends to the margin of the coin instead of only to the inner circle, as in the short cross variety. This king also added the numerals III. (or the Latin equivalent) after his name, to distinguish himself from his predecessors, the first time this device was em- ployed in the English coinage (see Fig. XXII., Plate II., which is a long cross penny of Henry III.). Edward I. (1272-1307) coined for the first time halfpennies and farthings, instead of having pennies cut into halves and quarters, as had been the custom till that time. Fig. XXIII., Plate II., is a farthing struck at York. The coinage of Edward II. (1307-1327) is so similar to that of Edward I. that even experts differ amongst themselves as to whom they should be assigned. Edward III. (1327-1377) made several important innovations: he not only issued a gold coinage, but also larger silver coins, viz., groats (fourpence) and half groats (twopence); his second gold coinage was the Noble, shown in Fig. XXIV., Plate II. This beautiful 28 The English Coinage 105 work of art was current for six shillings and eightpence. On the obverse the king standing in the ship, is supposed to refer to the victory over the French fleet off Sluys in 1340. Fig. XXV., Plate III., is a groat of Edward III. During this king’s reign there was a great expansion of the Norman possessions of the English crown, with a corre- sponding increase in the output of Anglo-Gallic coins. Fig. XXVI., Plate III., is a gold Pavilion or Royal d’Or of his son, Edward the Black Prince. It is interesting to note that there are four ostrich feathers on the obverse of the coin, two on each side of the bust of that prince. Richard II. (1377-1399) and Henry IV. (1399- 1413), Henry V. (141 3-1422) and Henry VI. (1422-1461), made little changes in the coinages, except that the last king struck two new coins, the angel and half angel. Fig. XXVII., Plate III., is the angel, which was current for six shillings and eightpence. On the obverse is the Archangel St. Michael piercing the dragon, and on the reverse a ship to the right with the mast shaped like a cross, surmounted by a top castle. Edward IV. (1461-1483) issued one new coin, the rose noble, shown in Fig. XXVIII., Plate III., which differs from the noble by having the rose on the side of the ship and in the centre of the reverse. Rose nobles were not only struck at the Tower, but also at Bristol, Coventry, York (Ebora- cum), and Norwich, and to distinguish these several mints the initial letter of the town was placed on the waves below the ship: thus in the rose noble figured there is a B for Bristol. The coins of Edward V. (1483) were exactly like his father’s, and are only to be distinguished by their mint marks. Richard III. (1483-1485) had no distinguishing coins. Henry VII. (1485-1509) struck a very fine new gold coin, the sovereign, double the weight of the noble, viz., 240 grains, and was current for twenty shillings: it is shown in Fig. XXIX., Plate IV. This same king also issued the first shilling or testoon. Henry VIII. (1509-1547) struck two new gold coins, the gold crown and the gold George noble, which were current for five shillings, and six shillings and eightpence respectively. Fig. XXX., Plate IV., is the crown and Fig. XXXI., Plate IV., the George noble, which has on the reverse St. George in armour on horseback and io6 PLATE IV. 33 PLATE V. 107 36 io8 The English Coinage piercing the dragon. The shilling or testoon (Fig. XXXII., Plate IV.) gives a good portrait of the king. Edward VI. (1547-1553) struck the first silver crown, shown in Fig. XXXIII., Plate IV. Mary (1553-1558), after her marriage with Philip II. of Spain, struck coins with the portrait of her husband as well as of herself, as seen in the shilling (Fig. XXXIV., Plate V.). The Spanish king’s name is invariably placed first, before that of the English queen. Elizabeth (1558-1603) issued a dated sixpence yearly for upwards of forty years, and Fig. XXXV., Plate V., is a milled sixpence of the year 1562: her dress is very ornate, as is the rule on all her coins. When James VI. of Scotland became James I. of England (1603-1625) he struck several coins to symbolise the union of the kingdoms. Fig. XXXVI., Plate V., is the gold unite or sovereign. The reverse legend — “ Faciam eos in gentem unam ” — is from Ezekiel xxxvii. 22, liI will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two king- doms any more.” Charles I/s troubled and tragic reign (1625-1649) pro- duced innumerable new coins. While at Oxford, the gold three-pound piece (Fig. XXXVII., Plate V.) and the silver pound or twenty shilling piece (Fig. XXXVIII., Plate VI.) were made out of the melted-down plate of the Oxford colleges. Amongst the many siege pieces of this reign, the shilling of Pontefract Castle (Fig. XXXIX., Plate VI.) is very typical. The Commonwealth coinage (1649-1660) is remarkable in having all the legends in good honest English instead of in Latin, and Fig. XL., Plate VI., represents the gold broad or twenty-shilling piece. Oliver Cromwell (1653-1658) had some coins struck with his portrait, but it is doubtful whether they were ever in circulation. The crown, by Thomas Simon (Fig. XLI., Plate VII.), is a fine work of art. Charles II. (1660-1685) gave us the first five guinea piece (Fig. XLII., Plate VII.). His example was followed by James II. (1685-1688), William and Mary (1688-1694) (see Fig. XLIII., Plate VII. ), William (1694-1702), Anne (1702- 1714), and the first two Georges (1714-1760). George III. (1760-1820) was the last king to issue the PLATE VI. 109 no PLATE VII. 43 PLATE VIII. hi 47 112 The English Coinage guinea, of which the spade variety (Fig. XLIV., Plate VIII.) is well known. The modern sovereign of twenty shillings was first struck by this king (Fig. XLV., Plate VIII.). The coinages of George IV. (1820-1830) and William IV. (1830-1837) have no new features. Queen Victoria (1837-1902) issued two new silver coins, the double florin of four shillings and the florin of two shillings. The first florin (Fig. XL VI., Plate VIII.) was issued in 1849, and as the words “ Dei Gratia ” were omitted, it is known as the “ godless or graceless florin.” Edward VII. (1902-19 10) issued the same coins as his mother, from the five-pound piece down to the farthing, with the exception of the double florin. Fig. XLVII., Plate VIII., is his five-pound piece. All the illustrations are from photographs of casts taken from coins in the author’s collection.
