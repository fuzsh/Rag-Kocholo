By François Mauriac

The Lamb probes the darkest corners of the human heart to produce an inventive, provocative, and deeply moving chronicle of fear and hope. When Xavier Dartigelongue encounters the tragically charismatic Jean de Mirbel and learns of his failing marriage, he decides to postpone the priesthood for the sake of “saving” two particular sinners. His visit to the Mirbel household will immerse him in the demands of lust and the darkness of despair and his salvific mission is rapidly in danger of becoming simply a project of self-preservation.

“I know now that love does exist in this world. But it is crucified in the world and we with it.”

François Mauriac (1885–1970) was a French, Roman Catholic novelist, poet, critic, and journalist. Critically acclaimed and respected, Mauriac received the Grand Prix du roman de l’Académie française for his novel The Desert of Love; was awarded the Grand Cross of the Légion d’honneur; and named laureate of the 1952 Nobel Prize in Literature.
