I would also like to thank Larry DeMartino, who also helped me with the gingers at this critical time, and W m . R. P. Welch for his excellent help with the tazetta narcissi. I'd also like to thank John Fellers for the use of some of his slides. Belated posthumous thanks are extended to the late Katherine Clint and her daughter, the late Marcia Clint Wilson, for the use of their slides. Their spirit lingers. The slides from their collections were priceless in helping to illustrate this book. I'd like to thank former students Chris Abee, Jim Bauml, Charles Curtis, Wayne Curtis, Jeff Fields, Dylan Hannon, Reggie Jackson, and Steve Lowe for their help in collecting the bulbs of Mexico. Thanks also to companions David Jordan, James Giridlian, Les Hannibal, Jane Kersey, Herb Kelly, Scott Ogden, and David Lehmiller, who accompanied me on various trips and also assisted in collecting many of the bulbs mentioned here. Thanks too, to the authors of other books on bulbs, for helping me keep in focus when I found myself foundering. At times we must lean on the experiences and observations of others if we are to go forward. And finally I would like to thank Matt Cady and Orlando Renaud for their help with the computer. After several false starts in which I lost parts of my manuscript, they were able to find them again and get me back on the right track.\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 9\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:49 PM\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nBULBS\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 11\n\nFOR W A R M\n\nCLIMATES\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:49 PM\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis book is devoted to plants growing as monocotyledonous geophytes, a fancy way of referring to bulbs. Generally the word \"bulb\" means a swollen underground rootstock. Botanically, rootstocks are defined according to their morphology. They are true bulbs, corms, rhizomes, tubers, or tuberous roots. The onion is the most familiar example of a true bulb. Others in this book are bulbs ofCalochortus, Crinum, Erythronium, Hippeastrum, Hyacinthus, Narcissusy Tigridia, and Tulipa. In this book, little space is given to certain bulbs for one reason or another. Some bulbous plants, such as Gladiolus, Iris, and Dahlia, deserve books of their own, as do orchids. Many herbaceous perennials, including Hemerocallis, Hosta, and Kniphofia, are sometimes considered \"bulbs,\" but they are not covered here. This book includes a broad spectrum of bulbous plants for warmer areas, particularly favoring the longneglected bulbs of the Americas along with many bulbs from other countries. I write about gardening in central, south central, and southeast Texas, an area that includes San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Houston, Beaumont, Austin, Waco, Tyler, and the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, in USDA zones 8 and 9. These zones also extend through the Southwest to the West Coast, as well as to the southeastern United States and Florida. Some plants discussed in this book can be grown farther north, in zone 7, while others can be grown in zone 10, but when I state that plants grow \"in our area,\" \"in our climate,\" or \"here,\" I am speaking principally of zones 8 and 9, where we get some winter frost each year. It is too cold for plants that need a frost-free environment but not cold enough for those that require a minimum number of chill hours. Bulbs are composed of old leaf bases and enlarged scales arranged concentrically. The roots and shoots develop from basal plates. The terminal shoots may contain\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 13\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:49 PM\n\n2\n\nBULBS\n\nFOR\n\nWARM\n\nCLIMATES\n\nonly leaves, or leaves and flower embryos. They can be easily identified by slicing the bulb longitudinally. Many though not all true bulbs have tunics, which can be useful in identification. Some bulbs are multitunicated, while others have a single layer. Some have papery tunics, and others have net-like, reticulated tunics that appear to have been woven. Non-tunicated bulbs consist of overlapping scales; some examples of these are Lilium, Fritillaria, and some Oxalis species. True Bulbs versus Corms In spite of older literature, Calochortus, Erythronium, Tigridia, and their allies (Alophia, Cypella, Eleutherine, Gelasine, Herbertia, Nemastylis, etc.) produce tunicated bulbs, not corms. The rootstocks of Erythronium are similar to the tunicated bulbs of species tulips. They are fleshy bulbs with several fleshy tunics, some of them forming what looks like the fang of a dog. Thus we have the term \"dog's-tooth violets.\" To my knowledge, there are no cormous native irids in the Americas, but there are some that grow from rhizomes (Iris, Neomarica) or fibrous roots (Sisyrinchium). Corms resemble true bulbs but are solid in structure, with the growing bud atop the center or off to the side. The corm itself acts like an enlarged basal plate, producing roots from the sides or the bottom and a growing bud at the apex or the sides. Often corms are enclosed in tunics, just like true bulbs. Many plants annually form a new corm above the old corm; the old corm shrivels and is absorbed into the new one prior to dormancy. A few corms, such as those found in Ferarria, are not absorbed and will form a corm-chain. If the corms in the chain are separated, the slumbering old corm can be reactivated into growth and will in time produce a new mature corm that will flower once more. Examples of true corms are to be found in many plants of the Old World, such as Colchicum, Crocus, Freesia, and Gladiolus, and in New World plants such as Brodiaea, Bessera, Mil/a, and Tecophilaea. Some early taxonomists were careless in classifying the rootstocks, as many true bulbs were said to be corms. It is time to set the record straight. Bulb Refrigeration Bulbs are sometimes refrigerated to hold them back and extend the season. Tazetta narcissi can be retarded by planting at intervals until early spring, so that they will be in bloom over a long period. The same retardation works for lilies and gladioli, which can be held back for later planting. Tulips are refrigerated in warm climates to provide an extended winter situation, without which they will not bloom. Most bulbs do not need refrigeration and should be planted in the ground as soon as\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 14\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:49 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\npossible, so as to prevent deterioration. They are safer rooting in the ground than in a state of enforced limbo in a refrigerator. Bulbs in the Landscape Bulbs may be used to fill temporary needs. Once they have fulfilled those needs, we can then move on to something else. For instance, a bed of tulips can give way to gladioli, which in turn can give way to summer annuals. In this way one can use a given space several times during the year. Or one can naturalize or perennialize a given space for a show for a short period of the year and then allow this space to rest. Bulbs for Dry Areas Xerophytic bulbs, which are perfect for dry areas, include Iris albicans, Cooperia drummondii, C pedunculata, C morrisclintii, Schoenocaulon drummondii, S. texanum, Hymenocallis glauca, H arenicola, Manfreda spp., Rhodophiala bifida, Zephyranthes lindleyana, Habranthus concolor, and Crinum album. These bulbs need little care and can be left to fend for themselves. In extremely dry situations they may need occasional watering. Most bulbs will want a bit more care than this. If you don't mind dragging the garden hose around during dry spells, you can try Allium, Brodiaea, Cooperia, Crinum macowanii, Hymenocallis acutifolia, and Sprekelia, as well as many Zephyranthes. These bulbs will get you through hard times. Bulbs with Scented Flowers Among the most fragrant bulbs are Cooperia, Crinum, Hedychium, Hyacinthus, Hymenocallis, Muscari, Narcissus, Nothoscordum, Polianthes tuberosa, and some species of Schoenocaulon. If carefully selected, these plants can scent any spot in the garden. Avoid ill-smelling flowers such as some of the aroids, unless you just don't care. Their scent does not last very long (only a day), but it is enough to startle an unwary person. Potpourris Many small bulb flowers are well suited to being dried for potpourris. Put bulb flowers into a container along with some borax and work it in carefully around the flower, positioning the tepals the way you want them, and allow to dry for a few days. W h e n you have enough of them dried, add some scented oil, and you then have the makings of a potpourri. This works especially well with small flowers such as crocuses and narcissi.\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 15\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:49 PM\n\n4\n\nBULBS\n\nFOR\n\nWARM\n\nCLIMATES\n\nInexpensive Bulbs The monetary costs involved in accumulating a collection of bulbs cannot be ignored. Those finding it necessary to start off modestly should begin with simple things. Generally one will want to start with Dutch irises, anemones, and ranunculuses. With these you can have a nice little bulb garden the first year without straining the budget. At this point, you need to know how to go about enlarging your collection. At times it may be necessary to broadly hint to neighbors or strangers in order to obtain some treasure. The worst that they can do is to say no. If you offer to buy the plant or offer another plant in trade for it, the other party can decide if he or she wants to part with one. Often you will find that people are willing to share generously. In the past, this has been a strategy of mine, and it nearly always works. Bulbs on Sale Another strategy in collecting bulbs is to wait and see if they go on sale. The problem here is that you need to find a dealer who is willing to sell them at a discount when the demand for them drops off at the end of the season. A good dealer knows when to do this, but there are always a few die-hards who hang on to the bulbs until they are all dead. Such dealers make careful buyers wary of buying from them in the future. Another problem in waiting for bulbs to go on sale is that the selections are smaller, and many bulbs perform poorly when planted late. You should inspect bulbs thoroughly to determine if they are still firm and succulent. Often they are hard and dead. Collecting Bulbs in the Wild If you happen to be fortunate enough to live in an area rich in wild bulbs and the opportunity arises, you might consider collecting them, provided that you can give them a chance to survive in their new environment, and provided that the local laws allow it and that you obtain permission. By all means collect them if they are in the path of future development, such as the widening of highways, and development involving bulldozers. Otherwise, take care to collect only seeds or bulbs that are plentiful, as we must conserve bulbs known to be rare. The best time to collect is when the plants have finished flowering. Then one may (preferably) collect seed. Growing new plants from seed takes a little longer, but in time there should be a good supply.\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 16\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:49 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nBulbs from Specialists In time you may want to look around for rarer bulbs not usually found in catalogs, and you may want to get in touch with other gardeners. These gardeners may be willing to sell some of their bulbs, or they may wish to trade for things that they don't have. Either way, a new bulb collector benefits. Many bulbs which otherwise would be unavailable are available from collectors in seed form. Joining a bulb society is a good way to get in touch with experienced collectors and growers. Hybridizing Bulbs One way to obtain bulbs that no one else has is through your own hybridization. Normally hybridization works only with members of the same genus, such as a Zephyranthes with another Zephyranthes, or a Crinum with another Crinum. This can start you on the road to a lifetime hobby. If you care to embark on this route, you must first obtain a variety of bulbs that will set seed. Accumulating them can take many years. Flowering the new plants from seed takes time, and the first hybrids may not amount to much. And finally one must learn to cull them ruthlessly in order to select only the best. Geophytes from Hell: Weedy Bulbs Most bulbs are a challenge for us to grow and keep, so it comes as a surprise that some bulbs are weeds and hard to get rid of. Some bulbs are tolerable and rarely become a problem, even though they can stray from where they were originally planted. We don't mind seeing a few bulbs reseeding themselves here and there about a garden as long as they don't get carried away with it. But within the genera Allium, Nothoscordum, and Oxalis are monsters that are waiting to get a foothold and are nearly impossible to eradicate. Perhaps the worst is Nothoscordum inodorum, a lovely fragrant thing with the tenacity of a bulldog. There are plenty of decent nothoscordums that mind their ways, so we don't have to deal with these rough ones. If you are so unfortunate as to have them get into your garden, you can deal with them with certain weed-killers carefully applied. Mulches In warm climates, mulches are valuable in winter and summer. They stabilize the soil temperature, but more importantly they help retain moisture during dry spells and protect bulbs against cold or heat. Almost any kind of mulch will do, but ideally it should be a covering of leaves an inch or two deep in summer, and deeper in\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 17\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:49 PM\n\n6\n\nBULBS\n\nFOR\n\nWARM\n\nCLIMATES\n\nwinter. An occasional light dressing of bug bait will discourage sowbugs, snails, and cutworms. Withering Leaves The most critical time for bulbs is when they have finished blooming. It is then that they must ripen their foliage in order to bloom the following year. While doing this they turn from green to yellow and become unsightly. Gardeners may want to conceal this process and permit the poor things to ripen in peace. It's the price that one must pay in order to keep them healthy. It's a tough time for them, but it doesn't last long. Some gardeners bind the ripening leaves or weave them into bunches, but to my mind this only draws attention to them. Actually the longer the ripening process, the bigger are next season's bulbs. Under no circumstances should the leaves be cut. Diseases and Pests Basal rot is caused by a Fusarium fungus that attacks dormant bulbs during warm, damp weather. Some bulbs are more resistant than others. The disease can be devastating, and explains why a successful planting sometimes fails to return a second season. It is best to avoid susceptible cultivars, while concentrating on cultivars known to be resistant to the fungus. Rhizoctonia, Sclerotiurn, and Sclerotinia are other forms of rot, and can also be treated with Benlate, a systemic fungicide and the chemical of choice. Viruses. A number of viruses (mosaic, yellow stripe, white streak, and chocolate spot) can attack all amaryllids, irids, and many other bulbs. Virus diseases are easily spread by sucking and chewing insects, along with contaminated tools and the contaminated hands of gardeners and unthinking visitors who seem obsessed with handling and rubbing every leaf of every interesting plant that they see. Like the classic \"Typhoid Mary,\" such visitors inadvertently transfer diseases as they go from one plant to another (including suspected virused plants), rubbing and feeling leaves. My advice for them is to look, but not touch, unless they are willing to wash their hands between plants. That should stop them. Virused plants generally do not recover from their ailment and should be destroyed. On the other hand, there are plants that show virus-like symptoms, but later seem to recover. This leads me to believe that some stresses often mimic viruses, but the plants outgrow them. While aphids, mealybugs, grasshoppers, slugs, and snails are usually blamed for the spread of viruses, I find that thrips (see below) are equally guilty. They can fly and are very active and so tiny that they easily go unnoticed, but they can disfigure flowers and disseminate virus diseases faster than any other insects but grasshop-\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 18\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:50 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\npers. They seem particularly attracted to white flowers, where they gather in large numbers. Spraying regularly with insecticidal sprays is the best method to keep them in check during the warmest months. W h e n they are not busy bothering daffodils, they will be found on Crinum, Hippeastrum, Hyrnenocallis, and Gladiolus, to name but a few flowers in their diet. Being so active, they can travel from virused plants in your neighborhood to your garden and back again. Perhaps the solution to viruses is to breed plants resistant to them. Nematodes can be commercially devastating to daffodil growers, particularly in sandy soils. Formerly nematodes could be controlled by sterilizing the soil with the chemical Vapam, but it has been outlawed by the Environmental Protection Agency and is no longer available. It may help to plant nematode-deterring plants such as marigold and rye, which can later be turned under. Bulb mites are pests that attack plants already under stress. They rarely bother healthy plants, but woe to a plant that already has problems. They multiply rapidly and can kill a plant in a short time. Red spider mites are particularly attracted to irids. Spraying or dusting with insecticides works. There are all sorts of sprays, but powdered sulfur is also valuable in treating them. One must begin early; by the time you have discovered that you have spider mites, it is already late. Snails and slugs. These slimy things are noxious, but can be controlled with bug bait. Beer is also recommended for snails and slugs, but I have never tried this. It is said to work. Thrips. Tiny black insects. Sometimes a problem with crinums, which they can defoliate. Spray with a systemic poison. See also Viruses (above). Grasshoppers are killed by liberal dusting, or with baits. Mealybugs and aphids are controlled by spraying with insecticide, but it must be repeated frequently as they can be very bothersome. Mammalian pests. Deer and rabbits can temporarily be kept away from bulb plantings with applications of blood meal. They hate it. But it must be reapplied after each watering or rain. This can get to be a bit of a nuisance in rainy spells, but it is a harmless way to add extra fertilizer to plants at odd times. One can also get similar results with sulfur powder or a mixture of blood meal and sulfur. Garden Tools There are many kinds of garden tools for digging, but my favorites are a good sharp shooter spade and a sturdy garden fork, preferably with all-metal handles. These can be hard to come by and cost a bit more than those with wooden handles, but they are well worth the extra effort. For lesser hand work, I prefer aluminum trow-\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 19\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:50 PM\n\n8\n\nBULBS\n\nFOR\n\nWARM\n\nCLIMATES\n\nels and forks. The kinds with wooden handles don't last long. You will find good quality tools paying for themselves many times over in money saved by not buying new ones again and again. I always place a bit of fluorescent tape around the handles in order to find them quickly should I leave them lying about. Because this book employs a mixture of common and technical terms, a glossary has been included to smooth over the rough edges. I hope that you find it useful.\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 20\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:50 PM\n\nAGAVACEAE\n\nPolianthes x blissii\n\nThe genera Manfreda, Polianthes, and Prochnyanthes differ from Agave in being herbaceous and bulbous. Some authors combine Manfreda with Polianthes, but they are distinct. Manfreda is a genus of robust herbaceous plants with rosettes of mottled, often thick, succulent leaves, and tall scapes with one flower per node. The stamens are exerted and brownish, greenish, yellowish, or whitish in color. The underground structures are cormous or rhizomatous. Polianthes plants have bulbs with well-developed basal plates, rosettes of thin herbaceous leaves, and racemes of white, purple, red, green, or yellow flowers, usually with two, sometimes fragrant, flowers at each node. The stamens are not exerted. Manfreda Salisbury Twenty or more species of Manfreda are native to the southeastern United States, Mexico, and Central America. These are bulbous herbaceous perennials mostly with dull white, yellow, green, or brownish flowers solitary at the nodes, on a tall raceme or spike. The flowers are generally tubular, with long-exerted filaments, and generally have some kind of scent. Manfredas usually grow from slender corms or bulbs with very large basal plates or rhizomes and have succulent or thin leaves that are plain green or mottled. They do best in full sun in a dry part of the garden. W h e n collecting manfredas, I generally prefer to look for specimens with the greatest number of spots on the leaves, as these are the most attractive and accentuate their best features. About the only problems with Manfreda are grazing deer and root-knot nematodes. Avoid the use of river sand, which might contain nematodes, and give the plants a warm, sunny spot. M. longifiora (Rose) Verhoek-Williams. A rare species from the upper Texas Rio\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 21\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:50 PM\n\nAGAVACEAE\n\n10\n\nGrande Valley and adjacent Mexico. The fall-flowering scapes are 18-24 inches tall and have pinkish flowers which turn purplish red with age. They are not as tall as the other species and have striated rather than spotted leaves. Unfortunately, overgrazing and over-collecting have made finding them increasingly difficult.\n\nManfreda maculosa\n\nM. maculosa (W. J. Hooker) Rose. A fine succulentleaved species from south Texas, with stems about 2 feet tall. The racemes of flowers open greenish white and turn reddish with age. They have a peculiar fragrance that some people find unpleasant and medicine-like. T h e leaves are often spotted and are toothed along the margins. This species has been crossed with Polianthes tuberosa > resulting in very good waxy white-flowered hybrids\n\nwhich turn reddish with age. M.potosina Verhoek-Williams 1975. Mexico, in the sandy northern desert of the state of San Luis Potosi.The flowers of this small plant look like those of M. virginica, but the striated, succulent leaves are more like those of M. longiflora. M. sileri Verhoek-Williams. Upper Rio Grande Valley of south Texas, usually found growing under shrubbery. A handsome plant with wide glaucous flaccid spotted leaves and tall racemes of chartreuse-yellow flowers. Needs dry conditions. This plant has become rare. M. variegata (Jacobi) Rose. South Texas and northeastern Mexico. This is a large plant with spotted or unspotted succulent foliage. The tall scapes of olive-green flowers have long chocolate stamens with the peculiar scent of menthol. I have grown this plant for many years, and it continues to increase in spite of occasional setbacks from the predations of deer. M. virginica (Linnaeus) Salisbury ex Rose. This is the most easterly species in the United States, with racemes of sweet-scented green tubular flowers on tall scapes. Unfortunately the tepals are much reduced, but the long protruding stamens try to make up for it. It does well in the lower half of the United States, from zone 7 southward. A few years ago Susan Verhoek-Williams crossed M. virginica with the tuberose {Polianthes tuberosd), obtaining tall (to 6 feet) hybrids with large greenish white flowers and thin, spotted leaves. Planted outside, they at first thrived but were eventually lost, but not before we learned some positive lessons in hybridizing manfredas with tuberoses. They easily set seed. Since the original cross has been lost, it should be repeated. Does well in pots.\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 22\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:50 PM\n\nManfreda-Polianthes\n\n11\n\nPolianthes Linnaeus Polianthes (syn. Bravoa) is somewhat like Manfreda, but the flowers are paired (except for P. howardii and P. densiflora) and showier, with thinner leaves and often well-developed ovoid bulbs. Besides the ones listed here, there are five or more additional species of white-flowered Polianthes species found in Mexico, each different, and from different regions and elevations. But the existing information and descriptions are confusing and of little value in determining their nomenclature. W h e n tuberoses are crossed with the more colorful species, the fragrance is usually diluted, but the colors are enchantingly enhanced. P densiflora Rose. Native habitat not known, but probably Chihuahua. Formerly thought to be a separate genus, Pseudobravoa, because the flowers were unpaired, it is now placed in Polianthes, along with P howardii. The tubular flowers are yellow, closely spaced, single at the nodes, and produced on short scapes. P. geminiflora (La Llave and Lexarza) Rose 1903. A widespread, variable species found in central Mexico. It has a rosette of glossy basal leaves and paired tubular flowers in shades of red, rose, and orange. W h e n in bloom, the plants glow like miniature Chinese lanterns. If it has a fault it is that there is too much space between the paired flowers. Were they more closely spaced they would be much more effective. P. geminiflora hybridizes freely with other species. P. geminiflora var. geminiflora (Rose) McVaugh 1989. The type form. The flowers are in shades of pink, orange, and red and are easy to grow and flower. Pgeminiflora var. clivicola McVaugh 1989. Jalisco. A large form from steep, shaded slopes, barrancas, and gullies, in oak or oak-pine woods in the mountains of the Pacific slopes of Jalisco. Although it has the appearance of P. geminiflora in the flowers, the plant is easier to grow, and taller, with wider leaves and larger bulbs. It is usually confined in Jalisco to subtropical wooded areas where the habitat is often encircled by P geminiflora. There is disagreement that this form belongs with P. geminiflora, and it may deserve status as a separate species. Pgraminifolia Rose 1903. Aguascalientes, Jalisco, Zacatecas. McVaugh lists this as another form of P. geminiflora because it has pendant red flowers, but there is strong disagreement with this treatment. In addition to the obvious foliar differences, P. graminifolia has slightly larger flowers. It comes from a drier part of Mexico, and it has small hairs along the leaf margins. I regard it as a separate species. P. howardii Verhoek-Williams 1976. Colima and adjacent Jalisco. A recently discovered plant endemic to southwestern Mexico. P. howardii grows in partially shaded tropical deciduous forests at mid-elevations. The pendant tubular flowers are on a long raceme, solitary at the nodes, with blackish interiors and red exteriors separated by yellow, ending in green. The bulb is narrowly elongated. As the bulbs enjoy\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 23\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:50 PM\n\n12\n\nA G A V A C EA E\n\ngrowing shallowry, they need protection in winter if left in the ground.\n\nPolianthes tuberosa\n\nP tuberosa Linnaeus 1753. Tuberose. This is an antique Mexican plant without a place to hang its hat. It probably ceased to exist as a wildflower before the coming of the conquistadores, having long been in cultivation in the gardens of the Aztecs. W h e n grown from seed, it can be variable and more nearly approaches what can be construed as a link to wild forms. It does well in pots. Currently in cultivation is a variety known as the \"Mexican Single,\" plus a variegated leaf form and several double forms, including one called \"Pearl.\" All are grown for their sweet, heady fragrance. Of the older forms, one had closely spaced paired flowers, and looked somewhat like a hyacinth, but this one has ceased to be listed. P. tuberosa hybridizes easily with other Polianthes\n\nspecies. Five white-flowered species are listed (Rose 1903): P. longiflora> P nelsonii, Ppalustrisy P. platyphylla, and P. pringlei. At various times I may have collected them, but based on the skimpy descriptions, could not identify them. P. sp. #1. Oaxaca. A red-tubed, green-tepaled species from Oaxaca with Christmas colors. Unfortunately the colors fade in hot weather. It is now nearly extinct due to overgrazing, over-collecting, and activities by the Mexican Highway Department. W h a t a pity, as the nodding red-and-green tubular flowers are enchanting. P. sp. #2. Oaxaca. A reddish-tubed smallish species from around Huajuapan de Leon. Bulbs similar in appearance to P tuberosa. It enjoys growing at low elevations on low, sloping hills. One of the best. P. sp. #3. Oaxaca. A tall red-tubed, yellow-tepaled species, from the Miajuatlan area of Oaxaca. Nearly extinct. P. sp. #4. Guanajuato. A lovely roadside species with waxy flowers, shaped like a tuberose, but smaller. The flowers may be white, yellowish, or pinkish. P. sp. #5. Nayarit. A low-elevation species, looking like a tuberose, with smaller white flowers tinged pink. P. sp. #6. Jalisco. Found at mid-elevations with a few large white zygomorphic flowers and slender foliage and bulbs. The flowers are placed singly or in pairs at the nodes. P. sp. #7. Durango. A slender species with white flowers, tinged purplish, flowering in August. The flowers are placed singly or sometimes in pairs at the nodes.\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 24\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:50 PM\n\nPolianthes-Pseudobravoa\n\n13\n\nP. sp. #8. Guanajuato. Intermediate between sp. #4 and P. geminifiora. The flowers run from pure white to red. Found in the mountains north of the city of Guanajuato. Rare. Hybrids\n\nP x blissii (P. geminifiora x P tuberosd) combines the tuberose with the drooping orange-red flowers of P geminifiora to give horizontally held pink flowers with a subtle fragrance. The flowers are paired at the nodes. P x bundrantii ('Mexican firecracker') is a modern hybrid between P. howardii and P. tuberosa that has paired flowers more closely spaced at the nodes, marked internally in shades of wine or purple and externally in red or rose and green. The bulb resembles that of a tuberose, and the plant is quite vigorous. P. 'Sunset.' P sp. #2x7? tuberosa. A modern hybrid with pinkish or reddish exteriors and yellow interiors. The faintly fragrant flowers are paired at the nodes. The bulbs resemble those of tuberoses and multiply rapidly. Easy to grow in full sun. Prochnyanthes S. Watson\n\nA small genus allied to Manfreda and Poiianthes. Found in grasslands, hillsides and rocky ravines, and pastures, commonly in oak or pine forests. Though attractive, it does poorly at lower elevations. The nodding Fritiiiaria-Wke flowers are paired on long pedicels on stems to 6 feet high. P. mexicana (Zuccarini) Rose 1903. Although said to be a single species, it is found in far-flung areas within Mexico in several distinct color forms. All forms are currently lumped together, but perhaps they are in need of further revision. Pseudobravoa Rose\n\nP. densiflora is now considered to be in the genus Poiianthes.\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 25\n\nProchnyanthes mexicana\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:50 PM\n\nAllium mobilense\n\nALLIACEAE\n\nThe onion family (Alliaceae) differs from the lily family in having the flowers produced in umbels, and from the amaryllis family in having superior ovaries. The rootstock maybe a bulb, corm, or rhizome. Some species possess a characteristic alliaceous (garlic) odor when the plant tissues are bruised. Examples of the Alliaceae are Allium, Ipheion, Leucocoryne, Nothoscordum> Tristagma> and Tulbaghia. Allium Linnaeus The large genus Allium contains the culinary species such as chives, garlic, leeks, shallots, and onions, along with numerous ornamentals. There is no agreement as to the total number of species, with workers placing the number anywhere between 500 and 1,000. More than likely the number approaches the higher mark, as new species continue to be discovered. They are found around the globe in the northern hemisphere to Central America and North Africa. In South America they are replaced by the allied genus Nothoscordum. Nearly all Allium species share the characteristic alliaceous odor of sulfur in the plant tissues when bruised. Surprisingly the flowers of many of them are delightfully fragrant, including scents of honey, hyacinths, and cloves. The Old World members of the genus are found across Europe and Siberia and around the Mediterranean in North Africa, to Asia Minor. In our warmer climates, some of these succeed while others fail, either because they need colder winters or cooler summers or because they rot if given moisture while dormant. They are well represented in North America, and the number of species found in Texas and Mexico has seen an upswing as the list continues to grow. The southernmost known Allium species is reported from Central America. (I have found A. glandulosum in the mountains of Oaxaca, Mexico, but it is also known from Honduras.) No blue-flowered species\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 26\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:50 PM\n\nAllium\n\n15\n\nhave been reported from the New World, but one yellow-flowered species (A. coryi) occurs in the Davis Mountains of west Texas. The vast majority of species are in shades of pink, lavender, wine-red, or white. Natives of the U.S. Southwest and Mexico are most successfully grown where there is ample moisture while growing, followed by a long dry spell when dormant. Listed below are some of the alliums that I have tried. A. altaicum Pallas 1773. Siberia and Mongolia. This is closely allied to A. fistulosum but is slightly smaller. It is easy to grow and flower, but is treated here as an annual or biennial. The stems and leaves are hollow, while the umbels are torch-like, with crowded heads of creamy-white flowers. It makes a very effective accent in the border in early summer but does not last long. A. ampeloprasum Linnaeus 1753 (syn. A. porrum). Wild leek, elephant garlic. Introduced from Europe by early settlers and now widely naturalized as a roadside and pasture wildflower. The bulb tastes something like garlic but is too mild to be of use where a serious garlic flavor is wanted. The dense umbels are composed of mauve florets on tall, twisting stems in early summer. Aside from culinary uses, the umbels can be used for dry winter arrangements and are particularly realistic when sprayed with mauve paint, matching the original color. A. atropurpureum Waldstein & Kitaibel 1800. The Balkans. Firm, healthy bulbs were planted in a sunny, well-drained spot in good dirt but still failed to appear. This suggests that they are unsuited for cultivation where winters are too mild. A. bulgaricum (Janka) Prodan. A synonym for Nectaroscordum siculum subsp. bulgaricum. A. caeruleum Pallas 1773. Steppes of Russia. A medium-blue-flowered species, lovely and inexpensive, but unsuited to our warmer winters. They may flower the first year but will often melt away from bacterial rot even while in full bloom. A. caesium Schrenk 1844. Siberia to Central Asia. Somewhat similar to A. caeruleum, but shorter, and with paler, grayish blue flowers. This is less easily obtained than A. caeruleum. It performed satisfactorily in a well-drained bed the first year but failed to reappear the next year. A. canadense Linnaeus 1753. Wild garlic. Eastern half of the United States. The plants have starry white or pink florets mixed with many bulbils on stems a foot or more tall. This first New World Allium discovery was found in Canada around the Great Lakes, but the bulk of its population is in the lower eastern half of the United States. Usually the inflorescence consists of bulbils alone, or mixed with a few flowers, but a few modestly attractive forms have colorful red or wine bulbils with an almost respectable ratio of flowers (about 8) to the umbel. They are especially ornamental when the colorful bulbils are topped by green leaflets, giving a striking illusion of a\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 27\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:50 PM\n\n16\n\nALLI\n\nACEAE\n\nred-and-green \"Christmas\" effect. One will want to avoid forms with few or no flowers. With the exception of rare floriferous forms, most are too invasive for anything but the wild garden, and likely even there. Some taxonomists recognize several related, wholly floriferous species as \"varieties,\" such as A. canadense var. ecristatum, v&r. fraseriy var. hyacinthwides, var. mobile-rise, and var. lavendulare, but such wholesale \"lumping\" has been rejected by other botanists, as each form has its own geographical divisions and subdivisions. Realistically, each \"variety\" differs in enough separate characters (i.e., bulb, bulb coat, leaf form, umbel, flower form, habits, and habitat) to merit separate species status. In the course of looking for forms with higher bud counts, a rare floriferous clone of A. canadense was discovered within a large colony of otherwise normal bulbiliferous forms east of Waco, Texas, and was found to be particularly decorative. It was dubbed \"White Flag\" for the impression it made as it waved within the large population of normal forms. It is many-flowered, with 30-60 florets of typical A. canadense form and a few (1-6) bulbils, and is seed-fertile. Otherwise it is identical to Allium canadense var. florosum\n\nthe normal forms. Correctly it should be des-\n\nignated as A. canadense v&v.florosurn, but it has not been published as such. It has continued to maintain its amazing floriferous behavior without any invasive tendencies for more than a decade and is quite handsome. A different form with grayish leaves and whitish or pinkish flowers was found in a ditch in the middle of bulbiliferous forms near Denton, Texas. The leaf color reminds one of A. hyacinthoides, but it is later-flowering and taller, with flowers more like^. canadense. The flowers of this one usually lack the bulbils of its bulbiliferous kin. Although a handsome plant, it is less impressive than \"White Flag.\" Clearly these special forms have earned a prominent place in the garden and prove that if one looks long enough, one can find that elusive needle in a haystack. Perhaps they are throwbacks to a more primitive time when all alliums were seed-fertile. A. carinatum Linnaeus 1753. Keeled garlic. Europe. I have only tried subspecies pulchellum and have yet to flower it or keep it for more than one season in our heat. Bulbs that I obtained showed virus mottling in the foliage. It seems to need cooler conditions than we can offer. A. cernuum Roth 1798. Nodding onion. This allium is widely distributed across\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 28\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:50 PM\n\nAllium\n\n17\n\nNorth America, including the mountains of west Texas and northern Mexico. As might be expected from a hardy species with such a wide range, it is variable in time of bloom, color, and height (it can be 4-30 inches tall). The flowers of the nodding onion occur in shades of pink, lavender-purple, or white, appearing from late spring to fall, depending on its place of origin. In hot climates it is best grown in some shade, since it likes cool, moist situations. It makes an excellent pot plant. The nodding character is accentuated by a \"crook\" at the base of the umbel and repeated at the apex of the pedicels, creating a very graceful effect. A. christophii Trautvetter 1884. Central Asia. This has failed repeatedly for me, but I once saw it flowering in the planted landscape at the local zoo. I doubt if it persisted, as it belongs to a group that routinely fails in our climate. A. coryi NL. E.Jones 1930. Golden garlic. Native to the Davis Mountains of west Texas. The bulbs are small and have loose, open meshes. One of the brightest and most unusual spring-flowering North American alliums, it is becoming endangered by livestock overgrazing. In cultivation the golden garlic will occasionally extend its flowering season into the summer if precipitation and sunlight are to its liking. One can never be certain. It reAllium coryi quires spring moisture and careful summer watering.\n\nAllium drummondii\n\nA. coryi will hybridize freely with A. drummondii, yielding some of the loveliest color combinations within the genus, e.g., white with yellow centers and midribs, maroonred with golden yellow centers, lavender with yellow centers, etc. The hybrids are easier to grow and maintain in a garden than A. coryi, as they tolerate moisture better, and they remain fertile. The trick is to get both parents to flower together, not an easy task, as A. coryi normally flowers several weeks later than A. drummondii.\n\nA. cozoanii Lindley 1823. Europe. Believed to be a selected commercial form of A. neapolitanum. The flowers are white. It is said that this plant came full circle when it was exported to Peru, where it escaped, naturalized, and then was re-collected and imported into Europe as a new species. See A. neapolitanum. A. cyaneum Regel 1875. Northwest China. An enchanting little blue-flowered miniature with thread-like leaves, thriving in cool conditions in moist, peaty soils and unsuited to our hot, dry summers. I once obtained a small clump and was able to see it flower before it finally expired in our relentless summer heat.\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 29\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:50 PM\n\n18\n\nALLIACEAE\n\nA. drummondii Regel 1875. Prairie onion. Texas, New Mexico, western Nebraska, and northeastern Mexico; prairies and hillsides in limestone areas. In its best forms this is one of the showier native species for cultivation, with loose umbels of starry flowers in pink, white, or the rare wine-red. The small bulbs have tightly meshed tan-colored tunics and increase by division. They require good drainage and full sun and will withstand average summer precipitation while dormant. W h e n planted near A. coryi, it will hybridize, yielding some of the finest and most colorful Allium hybrids. A. durangenseTraub 1968. Mexico, state of Durango, in grassy pastures and gentle slopes east of the city of Durango. A rhizomatous species with slender, spiraling leaves. The 10-20 whitish starry flowers with pinkish crested ovaries are produced in a loose umbel in July. A. ecristatum M . E.Jones 1935. Endemic to the Texas coastal prairie. This flowers in spring and when well grown is particularly fine, quickly forming showy clumps. The scapes are about 10 inches tall, and although the umbels are usually few-flowered (5-20), in cultivation they can become many-flowered (30-40), but will revert to their normal few-flowered condition if left alone. The starry campanulate flowers are in shades of lavender-pink, or rarely white, and have a faint fragrance. They prefer growing in moist alkaline soil in full sun but will tolerate some shade and will tolerate moisture while dormant. Although nearest to A. hyacinthwides, A. ecristatum has been lumped as a variety of A. canadense, but it differs sufficiently in all of its characters to be a different species. A. elmendorfii M. E.Jones 1935. Sand onion. South Central Texas. A. elmendorfii performs best in an acid soil, as all the sand onions detest alkalinity. The bulb coats are membranous, with the outer coats having broadly spaced, reticulated, vestigial tunics, which normally do not persist. Many stalked bulblets form around the base\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 30\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:50 PM\n\nAllium\n\n19\n\nof the bulb. The pinkish or whitish urn-shaped flowers have the fragrance of hyacinths. A. runyonii is identical, save that the reticulated bulb tunics are layered and persist. Since the same characters that apply to A. elmendorfii apply to A. runyonii as well, it would make more sense to make the latter a variety ofA. elmendorfii. It is an instance in which two related geographic sandy-land forms, separated by a 30-mile band of black, alkaline clay soil, differ only in the degree of reticulation in the bulb tunics. Some workers might explain this as parallelism, but common sense suggests that both plants share a single ancestor. Where both forms overlap, it becomes impossible to determine which is which, as bulb coat characters merge. A. eulaeT. M . Howard 2001. Central Texas. Endemic to rocky outcroppings on granite hills near the Colorado River, seeking seepy places or saucer-like basins and flowering in late spring. This species enjoys full sun and is similar to A.fraseri, but has erect, somewhat spiraling slender gray-green leaves appearing in late summer and early fall, several months before A.fraseri begins leafing out. The globose bulbs of A. eulae may or may not have reticulated bulb coats, depending on whether they grew in wet or dry situations. Their reticulated tunics may not persist in wet situations, which they seem to favor. The umbel of starry white (rarely pinkish) flowers is scentless and many-flowered (20-90) and blooms here in late April or May on stems 18-24 inches tall. Often the flowers of A. eulae have spoon-shaped segments, giving them a distinct appearance from other alliums. A. eulae, A. texanum, &n&A. zenobiae are among the last spring-flowering alliums to bloom in central Texas. A. eulae is well suited for gardens, as it is not fussy, tolerating moisture, heat, and drought with equanimity, unlike A. fraseri, which must have a well-drained situation. A. fantasmoense Traub 1968. Mexico, San Luis Potosi, at Valle de las Fantasmas, flowering in autumn. Closely related to A. glandulosum, with which it is said to be sympatric, it is said to differ in having smaller mahogany-red flowers with more slender pedicels in a fewer-flowered umbel, and in having canaliculate leaves. More likely they are the same species. A similar form has been collected in the state of Tamaulipas, with slightly paler, reddish brown flowers. All of these probably represent variations within A. glandulosum. A.fistulosum Linnaeus 1753. China and Japan. Japanese bunching onion. An edible onion closely allied to A. altaicurn, but slightly larger, with attractive torch-like heads of densely packed cream-white flowers. As the name suggests, the leaves and stems are hollow. It is widely cultivated as a vegetable and is underappreciated as an ornamental, but its many white torches can serve as a pleasing accent in a border. It is easy to grow and flower in cool weather but is not permanent during our hot, humid summers.\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 31\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:50 PM\n\n20\n\nALLIACEAE\n\nA.flavum Linnaeus 1753. Southern and south-central Europe. A variable evergreen species. The flowers are mostly in shades of yellow, but other colors are known, including white, orange, and reddish, with the lemon-yellow form being the most sought after. Some forms are said to be quite fragrant. The species should be a favorite in warmer climates, were it not for the fact that it will flower the first year and then die. It may be better suited as a container plant if given afternoon shade and not allowed to become too dry during dormancy. A.fraseri (Ownbey) Shinners 1951. Central Texas, in the Edwards Plateau and hill country. The narrowly linear leaves are dark green, suberect, and spreading, and appear in winter from ovoid bulbs with heavy grayish tan reticulations. The starry campanulate flowers are faintly scented or scentless, and a greenish cream-white color, in many-flowered (16-80) umbels. They are easily grown in well-drained alkaline soil if kept reasonably dry while summer-dormant, in full sun or light shade. This form was inadvertently made the type form for the species by Marion Ownbey, who failed to note the major differences between it and A. pseudofraseri. Several other white-flowered Texas species (A. eulae, A. pseudofraseri, A. texanum, and rare white-flowered forms of A. hyacinthoides) are confused with A.fraseri, but each has its own distinctive characteristics and habits. A. giganteum Regel 1883. Central Asia, Iran, and Afghanistan. A large, spectacular onion in the North but usually a failure in the lower South. This is lamentable, as the tall scapes support densely packed spherical umbels with hundreds of starry violet-purple flowers. The few times that I managed to flower them, the scapes were stunted and the umbels disappointingly small. I knew they were not happy here. In every case they failed to reappear the following year. A. glandulosum Link & Otto 1828. Mexico, in states of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, Michoacan, and Oaxaca, in wooded mountainous areas. One of a small group of alliums that form bulbs at the end of lateral rhizomes. This is a fall-flowering species with fragrant mahogany-red starry flowers. They have a small gland at the base of each segment. Several other stoloniferous Mexican species have been confused with this one but grow in wet meadows in full sun and have whitish or pinkish flowers, while this species grows at higher elevations on hillsides and mountain slopes and has brown-red flowers later in the season. It tolerates partial shade and is excellent for pots. A. guatema/enseTrzub 1967. Guatemala, near Huehuetenango, on dry grassy slopes, flowering in July. A tall, robust plant bearing pale pinkish stars in loose, many-\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 32\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:51 PM\n\nAllium\n\n21\n\nflowered umbels. The leaves are gray-green, channeled, and rather thick. Propagation is from seed, as the bulbs increase slowly by division. A. guatemalense is very rare in cultivation and is becoming scarce from overgrazing. It is suitable for pot culture. A. howardii Traub 1967. West Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and northern Mexico, on sunny hillsides and mountains. This species has membranous-coated bulbs and narrowly linear, gray-green channeled foliage. The starry white flowers are in bloom in late summer on stems less than a foot tall. Sometimes confused with the related A. kunthii, which is native to the central Mexican plateau. Good for pots if watered carefully. A. huntiaeTrzub 1969. Mexico, state of Durango, in mountain woodlands west of the city of Durango, flowering in early summer. The membranous-coated bulbs are not rhizomatous. The lax umbel has 10-20 dainty campanulate flowers in pink, keeled darker pink, with pedicels of unequal length and spirally twisted leaves. A. hyacinthoides Bush 1906. Endemic to north-central Texas and adjacent Oklahoma in calcareous soil. Sometimes classified as a variety of A. canadense, but the many-flowered umbels grow on drier chalky hills in north Texas and flower weeks earlier, with urn-shaped florets in pink or lilac, rarely white, and sweetly scented with a hyacinth-like perfume in midspring. The bluish foliage is linear and glaucous with a faint purplish edge, and the bulbs are heavily reticulated. They love an open, sunny upland spot. A. karataviense Regel 1875. Central Asia. A popular species of modest stature with glaucous tulip-like leaves and round umbels of dingy grayish lavender stars on short stems. It is a curious allium and demurely attractive, but is handicapped by our lack of consistently cold winters and is thus not permanent in the deep South. A. kunthii G. Don 1827. Mexico in the central plateau region. A. kunthii is confused w i t h ^ . howardii, but is said to have flatter, wider, striate leaves and whitish or pinkish flowers with reddish midribs and keels. It flowers in midsummer. As H a m ilton P. Traub defined the two species, plants identified as A. kunthii north of the Mexican border are really^, howardii, and those from central Mexico are^i kunthii. Their culture is similar. A. longifolium (Humboldt, Bonpland, &Kunth) Sprengel 1825, emend.Traub 1968. Central Mexico, in Jalisco and Michoacan, flowering July-August. One of several rhizomatous species. Traub created a tempest in a teapot when he correctly observed that a photograph of the lectotype showed that the specimen was in the process of producing a rhizome beneath the bulb base. He was later challenged by his critics, who claimed that what he observed was not a rhizome, but roots. I have observed that most rhizome-producing bulbs produce new rhizomes in this man-\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 33\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:51 PM\n\n22\n\nALLIACEAE\n\nner, starting with a thickened, pointed basal protrusion, at first growing vertically downward, then becoming horizontal. A. longifolium is a tall, slender plant that has starry pinkish or whitish flowers with pinkish keels. It grows in moist meadows and cornfields in rich soil in midsummer. A. mannii Traub & Howard 1968. In poorly drained swaley pastures and ditches in heavy clay soil east of the city of D u rango, Mexico, often in standing water following rains. The bulbs increase vegetatively by vertical splitting, and they usually don't form rhizomes. The evergreen leaves are grayish green and spiraling. The tall, slender scapes are nearly 2 feet high and bear 15-25 starry whitish or pinkish florets with purplish keels, opening a few at a time. They will grow well in containers if kept constantly moist in the growing season. A. mexicanum Traub 1967. Northeastern state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. The oblong bulbs are characterized by producing coarse roots and splitting vertically. They flower in July, with 8-12 pinkish campanulate flowers, keeled purplish. A. michoacanumTrzub 1970. Mexico, state of Michoacan.This very small species is found in woodlands in the mountains east of Morelia and flowers in late summer or autumn. The umbel is few-flowered (4-7) with tiny campanulate white flowers keeled brownish. The bulbs are small and rhizomatous, and there are two to four slender leaves. A. mobilense Regel 1875. Southeastern United States. Widespread in sandy soils of the U.S. southern coastal plains, flowering in midspring. The small flowers are faintly fragrant and have slender pedicels and small purplish ovaries. The dense umbels are many-flowered and spherical, in shades of pink or lilac. The foliage is narrowly erect, nearly rush-like, and bright green. A bulbiliferous, few-flowered form occurs near College Station, Brazos County, in central Texas, with the same dainty small flowers and slender, erect leaves. The bulbils are quite tiny. Although bulbiliferous, this species lacks the coarser aspect of A. canadense. Most forms of A. mobilense have bulbs that split into two of equal size, but forms with small basal offsets are known. Because the bulbs ofA. mobilense are small and the bulb coats are reticulated, it has been lumped as another variety of A. canadense, but since A. mobilense is distinctive in its own physical characters, it deserves separate species rank. A. moly Linnaeus 1753. Golden garlic. Eastern Spain and southwestern France. This resident of shady rocky areas ought to thrive in our climate but is usually a total failure. This is a shame, as it has starry golden yellow flowers and is inexpensive and widely available. The flowers are larger and lighter in color than those of\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 34\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:51 PM\n\nAllium\n\n23\n\nour own A. coryi. I was successful with it the first time I tried it, but it has consistently failed for me since. A. neapolitanum Cirillo 1788. Naples garlic. Mediterranean and Iberian Peninsula, in dry, open environs. In the Naples garlic we have an attractive white-flowered European allium, persisting as a perennial, flowering in late winter and early spring, happily reseeding itself and naturalizing in lawns. It is never a problem here, as it flowers early and then becomes dormant before the lawn is in need of its first mowing. This allium lacks the usual alliaceous odor when crushed and is excellent for cutting. Several varieties are known, including an improved commercial selection listed as A. cowanii. A. nigrum Linnaeus 1762 (syn. A. multibulbosuni). Southern Europe, North Africa, Asia Minor, and western Asia. Usually a species found growing over a wide geographical range is more likely to be adaptable to diverse growing conditions, and thus can endure garden culture better than those species endemic to small regions. A. nigrum is one of the few Old World alliums that seems adaptable in the deep South, when given a warm, dry garden situation. The fairly large umbels of whitish (rarely pink) flowers with greenish black ovaries are attractive. The halfdozen or so linear leaves are produced in a basal rosette. This is becoming widely available and affordable, and is worthy of a try. A. oreophilum C. A. Meyer 1831 (syn.A. ostrowskianum). Asia Minor, in screes and dry, rocky places at higher elevations. Like ^4. moly, this is a lovely, inexpensive, easily obtained species, but it is also one that refuses to grow where winters are warm and where summer rainfall and high temperatures go hand in hand. After several attempts I did get to see it grow and flower in my garden, and then it failed to reappear the following year. There were two leaves per plant, and they began withering as the rounded umbels revealed broad, showy carmine-red bells. This behavior is normal for many alliums. A. ownbeyi Traub 1968. Mexico, state of Nuevo Leon at the western edge of Monterrey, on the grassy slopes of Cerro del Obispado, in company with Mil/a rosea. Blooms in October, with 7-13 starry lavender-pink flowers. The spiraled leaves are broadly canaliculate, edged and ribbed with tiny denticulations. The scape is also denticulate. A. ownbeyi shares a similar range and flowering period with A. traubii but grows at a lower elevation. Although the flowers of the two are similar, foliage details are slightly different. They may be forms of the same species. A. paniculatum Linnaeus 1759. Europe and Central Asia. A variable species that is still not fully tested. It seems to go to pieces in a hot, dry situation, but does well as a pot plant if given afternoon shade and some moisture. The many-flowered umbels\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 35\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:51 PM\n\n24\n\nALLI\n\nACEAE\n\nare hemispherical, with small bell-shaped flowers on slender pedicels of unequal lengths in late spring or early summer. Floral colors vary from pinkish to whitish to brownish or nearly gray. The narrow leaves seem to clasp one another. In my garden grows a related, unidentified form collected in Greece prior to the Second World War by a friend, the late Georgia Harris, which keys out as this species. It produces typically long, bivalved beaked spathes and bell-shaped buff-white flowers with a faint green line on each tepal. Although the flowers are more somber than colorful, it is modestly handsome because of the fluffiness of the spherical umbels. As with many of this group, the foliage begins to yellow as it begins flowering. Having managed to keep this species for more than 40 years, I feel it is safe to say that it is permanent. A.perdulce S. V. Fraser 1939. North-central Texas, eastern New Mexico, to southeastern South Dakota and adjacent Iowa, in plains and sandy soils, flowering in early spring. The 5-25 large rosy-purple campanulate flowers have the sweet-spicy scent of cloves or Dianthus on scapes 4-8 inches tall. Ownbey recognized two wellmarked forms, varietyperdulce and variety sperryi. The type form is the most familiar and the favorite because of its bright color and intense fragrance. It prefers sand or sandy loam in full sun. Var. sperryi is a remote form from west Texas with fragrant pale pink flowers and probably deserves the rank of species or subspecies. A. potosiense Traub 1969. Mexico, state of San Luis Potosi, on dry hillsides and plains around the city of San Luis Potosi. Allied to A. kunthii, but smaller. The bulbs are rhizomatous and the narrow subterete foliage is channeled. The umbels of 12-14 starry campanulate flowers are white with pink keels, on stems about 8 inches tall, flowering in July and August. It needs careful watering while growing and no water at all when dormant. Traub published this new species as A. subteretifolium in 1968, but a year later switched the name to A. potosiense with no explanation. Perhaps the first name was occupied by an Old World species? In a genus as large as Allium, such are the possibilities. A. pseudofraseriT. M . Howard 2001. Central Texas and Oklahoma. This species was one of several that have been lumped under A. fraseri (syn. A. canadense var. fraseri), but differs from that species in several characters. It is a denizen of open woodlands in acid sandy soil. The flowers are sweetly fragrant, much like A. hyacinthoides and A. elmendorfii, but are urn-shaped, on slender pedicels, like those of A. mobilense. The umbels are many-flowered (20-100) on stems 6-12 inches tall. The flowers are usually white, rarely pink, with pinkish or whitish anthers and greenish ovaries. The leaves are bright green, broadly spiraled, erect or suberect. The netted bulb coats are grayish tan and in many layers. The plants flower in midspring in\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 36\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:51 PM\n\nAllium\n\n25\n\nthe Post Oak Savannah, Cross Timbers, and prairies of the eastern half of Texas, in sandy soil. The type for A. fraseri was based on a different species, but most references to this epithet are misapplied to A. pseudofraseri. It makes a fine garden plant where conditions are favorable and will tolerate moisture while dormant. A. pueblanum Traub 1968. Mexico, state of Puebla, at elevations of 6,000-7,000 feet, on rocky outcroppings in pine forests, flowering in July and August. The umbel is few-flowered (5) with whitish campanulate flowers keeled reddish, above two or three narrowly linear leaves. A. pulchellum G. Don. A synonym for A. carinatum subsp. pulchellum. A. ramosum Linnaeus 1753. Central Asia. This easy-to-grow allium has much the same habits as A. tuberosum, but the leaves are hollow rather than flat, and the umbel is funnel-like, with bell-shaped white flowers with red keels. They are said to be sweetly scented, but this has escaped my attention. Culture for this species is easy, and the plant seems permanent, but it is not very conspicuous. A. rhizomatum Wooton 8c Standley 1900. New Mexico and Davis Mountains of west Texas, in transition zone in broad wooded valleys on gravelly, grassy exposure. The umbels are few-flowered, with about six campanulate white flowers that have pinkish or purplish keels. The bulbs form slender, scaly rhizomes. Ownbey acknowledged (personal correspondence, 1962), \"In Allium in Texas, I confused^, rhizomatum with the Mexican A. glandulosum, but I now find that they are distinct.\" W h a t was not then understood was that no fewer than a half-dozen distinct west Texas and Mexican Allium species have rhizomatous bulbs. These are A. durangense, A. glandulosum, A. longifolium, A. michoacanum, A. potosiense, and A. rhizomatum. A. roseum Linnaeus 1753. This species is widely distributed around the Mediterranean and seems much at home in the lower South. In nature it is found in dry open spaces or where soils have been disturbed. It blooms here in spring with pinkish cup-shaped flowers intermingled with bulbils. The best forms are said to have good color and to lack the bulbils, but the ones I have from commercial sources have pale pink flowers and red bulbils. I have not found it to be an invasive weed pest. A. runyonii Ownbey 1951. South Texas, in sandy soil. Because of its heavier bulb coats, Ownbey regarded this as a distinct species, but in reality it seems to be a variety of^. elmendorfii (which see), and identical in all of its characters, except for greater reticulations in the bulb coats. A. sativum Linnaeus 1753. Garlic. The edible garlic needs no introduction, but is included here because a few forms are marginally ornamental, with many pinkish flowers in the umbel. Also they are easy to grow and can perform double duty as ornamentals and as culinary objects for the kitchen. The rule here is to plant them when the days are shortest and dig them when the days are longest. Unfortunately\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 37\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:51 PM\n\n26\n\nALLI\n\nACEAE\n\nsome people are more sensitive to the odor of garlic than are others. I am reminded of a very old movie in which a cook was instructing a stuffy character to add \"a little garlic\" to a recipe, whereupon he icily replied, \"Sir, there is no such thing as a 'little' garlic!\" A. scaposum Bentham 1840. Mexico, state of Aguascalientes. A. scaposum has been confused with A. kunthii but is taller and more robust, with the leaves nearly terete rather than flat. The membranous-coated bulbs reproduce slowly by splitting vertically. It is a many-flowered species with starry whitish flowers that have reddish keels. A. schoenoprasum Linnaeus 1753. Chives. Chives are another familiar double-duty edible herb, widely grown for their mild onion-like leaves, but equally worthy as an ornamental. Few people are aware that this plant's native habitat encircles the northern hemisphere, including Alaska, Canada, Washington state, Maine, and Newfoundland, and that it is quite variable over its extensive range. In addition to the usual lilac color, its flowers are sometimes found in white, pink, purple, and rose. Since they enjoy cool, moist growing conditions, they appreciate regular watering, thriving in pots if watered regularly and given a bit of shade during the hottest weather. The species name is pronounced SKEE-no-pray-sum. A. schubertii Zuccarini 1843. North Africa and eastern Mediterranean. A personal favorite, in our climate it is inclined to be permanent. A. schubertii is a most unusual species with basketball-like umbels loosely composed of starry lilac flowers on pedicels of markedly unequal lengths atop a short, sturdy scape. The leaves form a rosette of about half a dozen bright green, wavy linear leaves 2V2 inches wide. Though somewhat rare and expensive, A. schubertii is occasionally available, but is considered tender in colder climates. In spite of its price, it is an excellent investment where winters are mild. Autumn-planted seeds germinate well the following spring, and it is amazing to see how deeply the young seedlings will pull themselves into the soil, driving down nearly a foot the first season. Apparently this species likes to be planted deep so that it can revel at a cooler, moister depth. A. senescens Linnaeus 1753. Europe and Central Asia to Siberia. German garlic. In the North, this variable rhizomatous allium is regarded as an ornamental perennial, but in the deep South it suffers from our hotter, dry summers and warmer winters. It is a pity, since the fluffy pink umbels and the attractive grayish foliage of some forms are highly regarded by northern gardeners. Would that we could grow them all, but the trade-off is that for every species we lose because of climate differences, we gain others, and that is what this book is about. A. siculum Ucria (syn. Nectaroscordum siculum). Southern Europe to Asia Minor, in woodlands. Authorities disagree as to whether this genus belongs with Allium or\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 38\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:51 PM\n\nAllium\n\n27\n\nin a separate genus Nectaroscordum. Since the differences seem minor (the number of nerves in each tepal), it is convenient to include it with Allium. The tall stems are topped by umbels of elegant pendulous flowers, greenish in color, flushed pinkish and edged whitish. Until recently they were commercially unobtainable, but now they are becoming widely available and as a result more affordable. Bulbs usually flower here the first season, but may fail to reappear unless kept perfectly dry while dormant, and so it probably should be regarded as an annual. A. sphaerocephalon Linnaeus 1753. Round-headed leek.^. sphaerocephaloris tall stems are topped by wine-red umbels of small, closely set, bell-like florets in early summer. These are unusual in that the central florets open first, followed by the outer florets, ultimately giving the umbel an egg-shaped appearance. The first year it flowers unfailingly, but afterward it \"peters out\" until it is gone. Because of this and the fact that it is readily available and inexpensive, it is worth the effort of replanting every few years. It is only marginally successful where winters are warm and its dormancy is punctuated with high heat and rainfall. The species name is curiously ended with -on or sometimes -urn, depending on the authority, but the consensus is that the -on ending is the correct one. A. stellatum Ker-Gawler 1813. Midwestern United States on prairies, rocky hills, and dry slopes, to north Texas, west to Wyoming and Saskatchewan. It flowers in warm climates in September-October, and the purplish pink rounded umbels are especially attractive at that time. This species is closely related to A. cernuum, but though the umbels nod prior to flowering, the starry flowers open widely and face outward. It is happy in a sunny, well-drained situation and is perfectly hardy to extremes of heat or cold. A. subhirsutum Linnaeus 1753. Native to the Mediterranean in sandy, dry, or stony areas. My personal stock of this dainty allium came from a single unidentified bulb inadvertently mixed with commercially obtained bulbs of A. neapolitanum three decades ago. It flowered several weeks after these s a m e ^ . neapolitanum, with two or three basal leaves with hairy margins. The umbels of starry pinkish white florets have greenish ovaries. Thirty years would pass before the descendants from that original bulb would be properly identified as A. subhirsutum, emphasizing its durability in the lower South. Although not commercially available, it may occasionally turn up on the lists of specialists, and it is worth Allium subhirsutum seeking because of its dependability.\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 39\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:51 PM\n\n28\n\nALLIACEAE\n\nA. subteretifolium Traub 1968. Mexico. A synonym for A. potosiense Traub 1969. Traub published it as A. subteretifolium but a year later renamed it A. potosiense with no explanation. A. telaponense Traub 1968. Mexico, state of Mexico. This is said to be a small alpine species flowering in grassy meadows on the volcanic slopes of Ixtaccihuatl at elevations of 11,500 feet. The umbel is few-flowered with two or three campanulate whitish flowers with purplish keels on very short pedicels (V2 inch) in late summer to autumn. There are only two narrowly linear leaves, and it may turn out to be Nothoscordum bivalve. A. texanumT. M . Howard 1990. Central Texas and adjacent Oklahoma. Manyflowered (60-100) umbels of white starry flowers with greenish ovaries appear in late spring on scapes nearly 2 feet tall. The bulb coats are poorly reticulated, often lacking or not persisting, and may be membranous. The robust foliage is distinctive, being flat, about Vi inch wide, glaucous, and spiraling. This species grows in seepy, wet situations in alkaline clay soil where A.fraseri cannot grow, and can tolerate water while dormant. It needs to be kept well watered while flowering, or the buds will abort. Along with A. zenobiae, this is one of the largest-flowering Texas wild onions. A. texanum was previously included in A. canadense as variety fraseri, but it is obviously a distinct species with a distinctive set of physical and ecological characters. A. traubii T M. Howard 1967. Mexico, near the border of Coahuila and Nuevo Leon, in the dryish mountain peaks west of Monterrey, flowering September through October. This is a charming species with starry flowers in light pink with a darker keel. The leaves are grassy, and this species appears to be allied to A. stellatum and A. cernuum, but the flowers are upfacing. The bulbs increase by division and require a sunny, dry situation. It belongs in collections with other autumn-flowering alliums. Its cold-hardiness is unknown, but as it grew near the top of a tall mountain, with a full northern exposure, it must experience winter cold. Traub recognized two forms, differing only in how well they performed in pots. A. triquetrum Linnaeus 1753. Lily-of-the-valley onion. England and western Mediterranean in woodlands and damp places in part shade under trees. The gracefully loose umbels are composed of nodding white bells keeled with a fine green line. Said to be invasive. As the name implies, it has a triangular, fleshy flower stem, bending over until prostrate with ripening seed. The fleshy keeled foliage repeats the triangularity of the stem, hence the name. In our climate it fails to reappear after the first season. A. tuberosum Rottler ex Sprengel 1825. Eastern Asia. Chinese chives, garlic chives. This quasi-ornamental is so invasive that I have resorted to weed-killers to keep it\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 40\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:51 PM\n\nAllium-lpheion\n\n29\n\nin check, and failed. I finally had to dig it out by hand. The bulb-rhizomes seem impervious to anything but the most aggressive and ruthless strategy, so if you must grow it, be sure to decapitate the ripening seedheads or you may never be rid of them. W i t h this warning aside, it has tall stems of starry greenish white flowers produced from midsummer until fall. Luckily, the foliage is a tasty substitute for chives, and thus it seems to have found its niche as a culinary herb. My advice is to snip away at it on a regular basis and make this weed justify its keep. Never allow it to set seed, for every seed will germinate and grow into more invaders! A. vineale Linnaeus 1753. Wild garlic, crow garlic. Europe. The common form is a weed pest, widely naturalized in lawns and pastures in the United States and producing overly generous numbers of basal bulblets and aerial bulbils mixed with pinkish bell-shaped flowers. The flavor and scent of garlic predominate, but in my opinion it fails to be a culinary match for true garlic. Rare floriferous forms lacking bulbils have been reported which produce pink to red or even greenish flowers. Such forms may be interesting, but they are just as weedy as the type. A. zenobiae Cory 1953. East and central Texas. Its discoverer, the late Victor L. Cory, was so impressed with this plant that he dubbed it the \"Queen of the Texas Onions\" and named it for his wife, Zenobia. Marion Ownbey, another Allium authority, considered it to be no more than a robust version ofA. mobilense and lumped it as a variety within his concept of A. canadense. Theoretically the purpose of this concept was to make for easy identifications, but in practice it was awkward and produced as many questions as it did answers. Many of Ownbey's \"varieties\" were actually distinct species or subspecies, which in turn broke down into their own varieties, making for a top-heavy concept. Cory and Shinners rejected Ownbey's concept, and thus A. zenobiae remains in controversy There is no question that its nearest relative is A. mobilense, but they differ sufficiently to justify giving them separate taxonomic rank. A. zenobiae is a more robust and later-flowering plant than A. mobilense, with larger, paler, rounder, many-flowered (30-175) umbels on scapes 2-3 feet tall. They often grow near one another, but never together. Mature bulbs of A. zenobiae produce one to three large, basally attached offsets, whereas most forms of A. mobilense split into two bulbs of equal size. The Zenobia onion flowers in May and is one of the easier species to grow, tolerating alkalinity and shade. Ipheion Rafinesque 1836 A South American genus native to Argentina, southern Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay, and collectively called \"spring star flowers,\" Ipheion has a garlic odor typical of Allium when crushed. In a nomenclative sense, the genus has been shuffled around and listed as Brodiaea, Milla, and Triteleia, to none of which is it remotely related, as\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 41\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:51 PM\n\n30\n\nALLIACEAE\n\nwell as Tristagma, which indeed is a near relative. Early botanists apparently ignored whether some New World bulb members grew from true bulbs or corms, and whether their tunics were membranous or reticulated. They also ignored whether the species had solitary or multi-flowered umbels, whether the spathe valves were split at the top only or down to the base, and whether the filaments were in one or two rows, etc. Thus we had the seemingly never-ending transfers from one genus to another. In the case of Ipheion, the plants grow from true bulbs, the flowers are solitary, with spathe valves split only in the upper third, and the filaments are in two rows. The flowers are often fragrant and are found in shades of blue, violet, and purple or pure white. Rare pinkish-flowered forms are reported, but are apparently not in cultivation. There are also species with solitary yellow or white flowers that are now placed in the genus Nothoscordurn, since the spathes are bivalved and split to the base, while the flowers have filaments in a single row, rather than in two rows. Modern terminology does not allow them to fit into other families, such as the Themidaceae. I. dialystemon (Guaglianone) Crosa. A synonym for Nothoscordurn dialystemon and\n\nN.filipponei. I. hirtellum (Kunth) Herter. A synonym for Nothoscordurn hirtellum. L peregrinans (syn. Tristagmaperegrinans). Uruguay. This was sometimes dubbed \"Rolf Fiedler\" in commerce before its true identity was established. It is unique in\n\nn peregrinans\n\nthat it is a true, mid- to cobalt-blue-flowered (sometimes called \"electric blue\") species with starry, bluntly overlapping perianth segments. It is also unusual in that it produces bulblets at the ends of slender stolons, while also increasing by seeds. It needs more moisture than the other species while growing. The flowers of this species are produced in smaller numbers than those of the others, but they last well in the garden. Apparently only now becoming commercially available, the blue flowers of j peregrinans are most welcome to spring gardens.\n\nI. sellowianum (Kunth) Traub. A synonym for Nothoscordurn filipponei. I. sessile (Philippi) Traub 1953. Chile and Uruguay. The stemless flowers are white, striped purple, and held aloft by the elongated perianth tube, while the foliage is low and nearly prostrate. Spring. Rare in cultivation. L setaceum. A synonym for Nothoscordurn setaceum. L tweedianum (Baker) Traub. Argentina, Uruguay. Now feared to be extinct. The nearly tubular, darkly striped white flowers were reported to be smaller than I. uni-\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 42\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:51 PM\n\nIpheion-Leucocoryne\n\n31\n\nflorum. The margins of the leaves were papillate and the small bulbs were solitary. I. uniflorurn (Graham) Rafinesque. The best-known member of the genus, with several important varieties. The starry, upfacing flowers are an inch or so broad, sweetly scented, and only a few inches tall. Ordinarily they are in shades of violet or whitish, suffused bluish or purplish, with purple keels. Considering their origin, the bulbs are amazingly hardy to cold, thriving out of doors in Denver, Colorado. A newer, darker purple-flowered form is available under the name 'Froyle Mill,' even though it is a seed-grown strain ofvar. purpureum rather than a true clone. This colorful form is showy and appealing as a border plant. A new robust whiteflowered form, Alberto Castillo/ is listed as a clone but probably is a selection of var. album, since it is grown from seed, making it a strain. Such well-intentioned, non-botanical merchandising is frowned upon by taxonomists, who prefer to have names assigned in an orderly, systematic fashion according to the rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Another strain receiving similar nomenclatural treatment is a seed-grown strain (a form of var. violaceum) widely marketed as 'Wisley Blue.'This strain was first named in the United Kingdom as an \"improvement,\" but while attractive, it is similar to common purplish forms grown here. All colors are attractive and harmonize well, and many gardeners may wish to try them all. They are hardy, permanent, and inexpensive, and if allowed to reseed themselves they will hybridize, yielding interesting color combinations. They love reseeding themselves into lawns, which they will carpet if left undisturbed, and where they really look their best in early spring. By the time the lawn is in need of mowing, the dormant bulbs will be delightful memories. I. vittatum (Grisebach) Traub 1949. A synonym for Nothoscordum vittatum. Leucocoryne Lindley 1830\n\nAbout 15 species, all native to Chile, with or without an alliaceous odor, and growing from sea level to 3,000 feet in elevation. They are related to Nothoscordum and Ipheion, and occur in white, blue, and violet. The leaves are narrowly linear, and the bivalved scape is slender with an umbel of 2-12 more or less showy pedicellate flowers, usually with three functional stamens and three large staminodes.The fragrant species are long-lasting and useful for cutting. They grow in cool weather and are wonderful for pots, or out of doors in a frost-free environment, if kept dry while dormant. They are ideal for Mediterranean climates, as in coastal California, and can be propagated from basally produced offsets or from seed. L. alliacea Lindley has greenish white flowers with slender tepals. As the name implies, it has an alliaceous odor. L. angustipetala has small whitish flowers with narrow, lance-shaped tepals.\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 43\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:51 PM\n\n32\n\nALLI\n\nACEAE\n\nL. appendiculata has white flowers with purplish appendages at the apex and yellow staminodes. L. conferta has narrow-tepaled white flowers with yellow staminodes. L. coquimbensis has three to ten fragrant flowers in tight umbels, pale violet-blue, striped and zoned white with green in the center. The staminodes are deep yellow. A pure white form is reported. Said to be one of the easiest of the genus to cultivate. L. dimorphopetala (Gay) Ravenna 1978 (syn. L. oxypetald). Chile, Atacama and Coquimbo regions in the arid and semi-arid steppe. The flowers have six stamens and three epitepal androecium appendages. L. ixioides (W. J. Hooker) Lindley. Glory of the sun. The most popular species, with 6-12 flowers in shades of purple, blue, or white. L. odorata was once considered a variety but is now regarded as a separate species, which see. L. macropetalum has up to a dozen large white flowers per scape, with yellow staminodes. The segments are acute and lanceolate. L. narcissioides Philippi i860. Chile, Atacama Province. The flowers have six stamens with six androecium appendages. L. odorata Lindley. This species has smaller, paler flowers on shorter pedicels than L. ixioides. These two species are the ones most apt to be encountered in cultivation. L.pauciflora. A miniature with violet-veined white flowers and white staminodes, on short pedicels. L. purpurea Gay has five to eight large flowers. It is arguably the most impressively flowered in the genus with its darkly colored flowers centrally marked violetred and outwardly marked light violet-blue. The beautiful flowers are produced as the leaves begin yellowing in late spring. L. violascens. The flowers are large, purplish or violet, with orange staminodes. Nothoscordum Kunth 1843 The onion-like genus Nothoscordum replaces Allium in the New World below the equator. The name translates into \"false garlic,\" since most species lack a characteristic alliaceous odor. Most have an uninteresting bland flavor, but a few, such as N entrerianum, N hirtellum, and TV. gaudichaudianum are reported to have an alliaceous odor like that of onions. The leaves of N inodorum have no odor when bruised but when chewed will leave a subtle garlicky aftertaste. N bivalve is sometimes called \"crow poison,\" an old-timers' myth, since there is no evidence that any members of this family are toxic. That name likely resulted from its being a tasteless (and therefore useless) onion-like weed, \"unfit for crows.\" O n the other hand, the flowers of many Nothoscordum species are wonderfully fragrant and could be recommended for this reason alone, were it not for the fact that a few are also noxious\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 44\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:51 PM\n\nLeucocoryne-Nothoscordum\n\n33\n\nweeds. Among these are N nudicauk, N inodorum, and some of the latter's subspecies (subsp. inodorum and subsp. angustius), none of which should be admitted into civilized gardens. If you must grow them out of doors, consign them far away to the wild garden, where they can do minimal harm. In a greenhouse the weedy ones flower over much of the year, on lax stems that rampantly ripen seeds, scattering them into adjacent pots. Until recently Nothoscordum was considered a small genus of mostly uninteresting weeds, but new discoveries and recollections of rare old species have changed this. There are now over 30 recognized species, some of which are choice and attractive, but many of which are rare and unavailable. This situation may improve as South American collectors become more aware that a demand exists for the smaller \"miscellaneous\" bulbs. Contrary to popular belief, some Nothoscordum species are slow to propagate and make few, if any, offsets. Some have brightly colored flowers in yellow or lilac, but most of them are white, with the keels often striped purple, brown, or green. Unlike many bulbs, they tolerate some moisture while dormant, and as a result they are surprisingly easy to grow and are most enduring. Many of them have two distinct flowering seasons, in spring and fall, and if conditions are to their liking, a few species are nearly evergreen and everblooming. All do well in pots, and some make fine garden plants in full sun, increasing slowly by the few seeds or offsets. On the other hand, one must beware of those few rampant weedy ones (cited above) which have the alarming ability to set copious seeds and numerous offsets no larger than a grain of rice. These offsets detach at the slightest movement in the digging, to contaminate the soil. So determined are they to increase that small seedlings and offsets are already forming offsets of their own! W i t h that warning for the prolific species aside, I will list a few of the more attractive and interesting harmless forms for cultivation. Unfortunately the white-flowered species with contrasting keels predominate, and only a collector would want them all. For this reason we are grateful that there are brightly colored species with jewel-like yellow flowers, often retaining the added feature of a wonderful fragrance. Some examples of these are N.filipponei and N montevidense and its subspecies. A potful of these will perfume an entire greenhouse. T h e golden yellow N. ostenii and N hirtellum are equally attractive but lack any perceptive scent. N striatellum is reported to have pale yellow flowers but apparently is not in cultivation. N bivalve var. lilacinum has pinkish or lilac-colored flowers, which harmonize nicely with yellow or white sorts. Nothoscordum flowers are normally produced in umbels, but several species have only solitary flowers in yellow or white. These were once classified with the genus Ipheion but are now considered as true Nothoscordum because the base chromosome\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 45\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:51 PM\n\n34\n\nALLIACEAE\n\nnumber is 5 (rather than 6), the spathe is bivalved rather than univalved, and the tepals are free to the base instead of being united into a tube, while the filaments are in a single series instead of two. The saucy TV hirtellum has scentless golden blooms in autumn, while the equally charming N.filipponei has fragrant lemon-yellow flowers in spring. TV vittatum has solitary white flowers, keeled with a violet line. All of the solitary-flowered species make outstanding pot plants and are quite rare and scarce in cultivation. Of the multi-flowered species with white flowers, TV balaenense is outstanding, since the snowy white florets are deliciously scented, and flower in spring and fall. The charming TV castilloi gives us a change of pace, with waxy white nocturnal flowers broadly banded a rich purple. TV bivalve is a reasonably well-behaved sort without the alarming invasive tendencies. There are many others that fit this category. TV arenarium increases very slowly for me, only by seed. Casually it looks much like TV bivalve, without the yellowish interiors, and with longer pedicels.\n\nThe Species TV andalgalense Ravenna. Argentina, Catamarca Province. A recently described white-flowered species of which little is known, it is likely a spring bloomer, is reported to be somewhat similar to TV arenarium, and is probably not in cultivation. TV. andicolum Kunth 1843. Argentina, in Andean northwest, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru, around Lake Titicaca. A small high-elevation (10,000-12,000 feet) mountain species with four to ten funnel-shaped white flowers externally flushed purplish on short (i%—3-inch) scapes. The filaments are united at their bases. The small bulb is usually solitary and conical in shape and when boiled is used for medicinal purposes by natives. Reportedly cultivated as a greenhouse plant in the United Kingdom, where it is considered modestly attractive. There is no report of any fragrance. It may fail in hotter climates but might succeed where winters are colder. Like other alpine bulbs, it may need melting spring snows to complete its growing cycle. Perhaps precooling the bulbs by refrigerating them, as with tulips, and growing them in an unheated greenhouse might facilitate their culture. TV andinum (Poeppig) Fuentes 1921 (syn. Zoellnerallium andinum). Chile, flowering in spring on arid plains. Sometimes confused with TV. andicolum, it is taller and has one or two scapes of 4-11 florets with erect, oddly twisted, narrow white tepals and broad purplish keels. The flowers do not open wide, and the yellowish filaments are free to their bases. There are no reports of fragrance. TV andinum is found at lower altitudes (6,000-10,000 feet) than TV. andicolum and might be of somewhat easier culture where winters are warmer. This species differs from other Nothoscordum species\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 46\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:52 PM\n\nNothoscordum\n\n35\n\nin having bulb coats that turn from white to purplish when dry. Mature bulbs are subglobose with many bulblets and are said to have an alliaceous odor. This plant is more strangely fascinating than beautiful. It occasionally turns up on seed lists as Zoellnerallium andinum. Like N. andicolum, it would need an alpine culture. N. arenarium Herter 1937. Argentina. Like most Nothoscordum species, N. arenarium has tall, wiry scapes in full sun, but these become lax in part shade. There are a dozen or so starry, fragrant white flowers on pedicels of noticeably unequal lengths, produced in spring and autumn. The flowers open in the afternoon and close at sunset. The bulbs make few or no offsets and must be propagated by seed. Attractive, but rather similar to the ubiquitous N. bivalve. N. balaenense Ravenna 1971. Uruguay, at Punta Ballena. This is one of my favorites. The flowers are snowy white, somewhat like those oiAllium neapolitanum, but they appear in both spring and fall on pedicels of uniform length and are sweetly scented. The stems are not overly tall, so the plant's proportions are all in proper balance. The bulbs seem not to form offsets, but injured bulbs will heal and regenerate when cut into a few large pieces. This species' cold-hardiness is not well established, but it should be considered tender north of zone 8. N. bivalve (Linnaeus) Britton. The ubiquitous N. bivalve is one of the commonest species, as it is found in the southeastern quarter of the United States, northeastern and central Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. The loose umbels of honey-scented Nothoscordum balaenense flowers have pedicels of slightly unequal lengths, opening in the early afternoon and closing at sundown. The tepals are cream-white, externally striped purplish, brownish, or greenish, and the filaments and style are yellowish. The flowers are not conspicuous unless massed, but a large colony can perfume a neighborhood on warm, sunny afternoons in the spring or fall. The individual flowers open a few at time and Nothoscordum bivalve var. last only a few days, so that the umbels are never lilacinum crowded. As a result they become somewhat unkempt in appearance, with a mixture of buds, flowers, and rapidly developing seed capsules, looking as if they had slept in their clothes. O n the positive side, the scapes are produced in succession in spring and fall, stopping only with winter's cold or summer's drought. Under favorable moist conditions, they may continue flowering\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 47\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:52 PM\n\n36\n\nALLIACEAE\n\nthroughout the summer. Luckily the bulbs increase with restraint, and thus the main method for propagation is by seed. I have never found their increase to be a problem in cultivation. Several forms are now recognized, with var. bivalve being the one most often encountered. I recently found ultra-rare lilac-colored forms mixed within large colonies of normal white-flowered forms in south Texas. Till then, the existence of such colored forms was unknown. These are being grown as var. lilacinumy and they significantly expand the color range. As might be expected, they harmonize nicely with yellow-flowered forms such as N. montevidense var. minarum and the immaculate white-flowered N. balaenense, all being of similar size, height, fragrance, and habits and flowering at the same times in spring and fall. N. bivalve var. nanum. Argentina. A stoloniferous form, otherwise identical to the type. In nature it is supposed to be smaller, but given optimum culture it becomes larger and loses this distinction. Aside from forming short stolons, it is indistinguishable from the common form. N. boliviense Ravenna 1978. As the name suggests, this is a Bolivian species with five to nine large, funnel-shaped white flowers, sometimes tinged purplish on their outer surface, and carinate leaves. There is no report of fragrance, but this character is often overlooked by collectors and cannot be determined in dried specimens. No mention is made of offsets in the description of the bulb of iV. boliviense, but often these may shake loose from dried specimens. N. bonariense (Persoon) Beauverd 1909. Confused with N. spathaceumy or perhaps a synonym for it. N. brevispathum Philippi 1896. Chile, in the Andes near the town of Illapel. Flowers following melting snow, in late winter or early spring, at 6,000 feet in elevation. There are umbels of three to four fairly large white flowers, keeled with a narrow purple line, on scapes 8-10 inches high. The solitary bulbs are small and grayishcoated, and the leaves are narrowly linear. The spathes were originally reported as being short, but this can be variable. There is no report of any fragrance. N. capivarinum Ravenna 1978. Brazil, in sandy soil on the banks of the Capivari River in the state of Parana. There are four to eight starry white flowers, keeled greenish or purplish, in the umbel. They are reported as scentless or slightly fragrant, but this may depend on the time of day. The leaves are broad (2-3% inches), and the bulbs produce many bulblets. N. castilloi T M. Howard 1994. Brazil, state of Rio Grande do Sul.This is a nightblooming species that I discovered in southern Brazil in 1986 and named in honor of Alberto Castillo, a plant-collecting companion. The umbels are composed of four to six waxy white flowers, attractively keeled a rich purple. The incurved filaments\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 48\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:52 PM\n\nNothoscordum\n\n37\n\nare broad and flat, touching one another to form what resembles a cylinder-like trumpet. The scent is strange, sometimes sweet but more often rancid, and unusual for this genus. The flowers are crepuscular, opening at dusk and closing by sunrise. The plant's cold-hardiness is not established, but as is the case with so many of these \"tender\" species, it can take light frosts. N. dialystemon (Guaglianone) Crosa 1975 (syn. Ipheion dialystemon). Argentina and Uruguay. The yellow-flowered TV. dialystemon is considered a variation otN.filipponei, differing mainly in the filaments being free, not connate at the base. Sometimes there are also extra tepals. It blooms in spring and produces basal offsets, and like most members of this small group, it is rare in cultivation. N. entrerianum Ravenna 1973. Argentina, in Entre Rios Province, in sandy clay along the Parana River. Umbels of seven to ten fragrant white flowers lacking the usual (for this genus) purple stripes. The bulbs are said to have an alliaceous odor and produce bulblets. Not in cultivation, but possibly worth growing. N. exile Ravenna 1978. Brazil. In stony fields at Guarapuava, state of Parana. There are seven to ten white flowers with purple keels on stems 5-12 inches high. Apparently not in cultivation. N.filipponei Beauverd 1921 (syn. Ipheion sellowianum). Uruguay. A solitary-flowered species with satiny lemon-yellow blossoms and the same honey-like fragrance as N. montevidense and N. bivalve. It is quite rare in cultivation and is truly one of the crown jewels of the genus. The flowers, no taller than crocuses, open before noon and close before sunset. The leaves form a small, spreading rosette, and the bulbs form offsets slowly while maintaining live roots even when dormant. Because of this, the bulbs should never be dried out completely. Seed forms only if there is more than one clone present, which is a pity, since few people have the luxury of having extra clones.\n\nNothoscordum filipponei\n\nHoward_1225.pdf 49\n\n11/22/2013 2:10:52 PM\n\n38\n\nA LLI ACE A E\n\nTV gaudichaudianum Kunth 1843. Argentina and Uruguay. The tongue-twisting epithet is used for a man whose surname was Gaudichaud. Normally flowering in autumn, the plant is said to have narrow leaves and the usual starry white flowers, keeled violet and open during daylight hours. As usual, its fragrance is unreported, and there is disagreement as to whether or not it makes offsets. Perhaps this confusion stems from some taxonomists considering it as a synonym for TV. bonariense. TV goianum Ravenna 1978. Brazil, state of Goias, in calcareous rocky outcroppings. A dwarf type with six to eight campanulate whitish flowers. Probably not in cultivation. TV grossibulbum Beauverd 1908. Thought to be a synonym of TV gaudichaudianum. TV hirtellum (Kunth) Herter 1928-1929 (syn. Ipheion hirtellum). Argentina and Uruguay. Once considered an Ipheion, this solitary-flowered species blooms in autumn with golden yellow flowers "
