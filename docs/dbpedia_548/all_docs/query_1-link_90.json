        "text": "The classic Calla Lily Giant White, immortalized in painting and tapestry for centuries, and yet so easy to grow in home or garden. The large white flowers are elegant, long-lasting, and very dependable, and the plant thrives in sun or deep shade and moist areas that most other bulbs can't tolerate. What more could one ask?\n\nThe huge 3- to 4-inch blooms of purest white on the Calla Lily Giant White open wide for greater color show, revealing the neat pastel-yellow spadix within. And even when these plants aren't blooming, the glossy, arrow-shaped foliage adds great texture to the garden. Expect the blooms in late spring or early summerÂ—about 2 months from planting time, or year-round when grown as a houseplant. (Just give it a 3-month dormancy period at some point during the year.)\n\nCalla Lily thrives in sunny or shady beds in the summer garden, as well as in containers of all kinds. In all but tropical areas, the bulbs should be dug up in fall and stored indoors for replanting in spring (or the container moved to a frost-free area, such as indoors near a bright window). Every few years, when the flowering diminishes, dig up the bulb in early fall and divide it into new plants. Feed heavily during the growth period for even bigger, better blooms. You will love this Calla Lily Giant White."
