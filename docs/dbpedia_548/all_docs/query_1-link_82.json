Segeren\n\nAbstract\n\nConsidering that nutrient requirements in plants varies according to the phenological stages, species, varieties and the scarcity of information about Zantedeschia sp., the objective of this study was to evaluate the nutritional requirements and nutrient uptake in two species under fertigation conditions to providing supports for nutritional management and contribute to the efficacy of fertigation. The experiment was set up as a randomized block design with a split plot arrangement and four replications. The treatments consisted of two species: Z. elliottiana and Z. rehmannii, and established six evaluation periods: 14, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 84 days after planting. Fertigation was performed by the micro-sprinkler method. Every fourteen days dry matter production and nutrient uptake (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) in leaves, tubers and roots was evaluated. The results showed different behaviors between species in dry matter and nutrient uptake, where Z. elliottiana showed a higher biomass production and greater nutritional requirements in relation to Z. rehmannii. The percentage differences of nutrient uptake at the end of the cycle between them were evaluated in the following magnitude: 59% N, 46% S, 44% K, 43% Ca, 38% Mg 38% Zn, 33% Mn 22% P, 15% B, 8% Cu and 6% of Fe. The amount of nutrients uptake in the plant in both species followed a decreasing order: K>N>Ca>P>S>Mg. As for the micronutrients: Fe>Zn>B>Mn>Cu.\n\nCitation\n\nFonseca, A.S. and Segeren, M.I.
