        "text": "A member of the Arum family, the calla lily (Zantedeschia sp.) is an herbaceous, bulbous perennial grown for its elegant trumpet-shaped “flowers” or bracts (spathes), which surround a thick and fleshy central spike (spadix), as well as for its large, arrow- to lanceolate-shaped foliage that is usually green, sometimes very glossy, and often spotted. Although the flowers are typically shades of white or purple, they come in a range of colors, including red, pink, orange, and yellow. The flowers are often used in floral arrangements.\n\nZantedeschia is a genus of approximately 8 species that grow between 1 to 3 feet tall and 1 to 2 feet wide, including Z. elliottiana (golden calla lily or Elliott’s calla), Z. albomaculata (spotted calla lily), Z. aethiopica (lily of the Nile), and Z. rehmannii (pink arum or pink calla lily). Calla lilies are easy to grow with minimal care. In regions with cool summer climates, they grow best in full sun. In hot climates, morning sun with dappled afternoon shade is best. Calla lilies prefer consistently moist, humus-rich soils and grow well in boggy areas around ponds and along streams. The plants are deer and rabbit resistant. Plant calla lily bulbs in spring for summer color and dig up the corms to store in winter. Calla lilies are also great container plants, indoors or out."
