        "text": "Calla lily, also known as arum lily, is not a true lily. It belongs to the genus Zantedeschia which originates from South Africa. The huge, flower-like spathes of the calla lily are now coming in a lot of different colors, making it a more popular house plant as well as a garden and patio plant.\n\nCalla lillies flower from early to late summer on sturdy upright stems. They look nice because they have pretty leaves. The broad, bright green leaves are often speckled with white or silver. You can store the rhizomes, or fleshy roots, of most calla lilies over the winter and plant them again in the spring. The exception is white arum lily (Zantedeschia aethiopica) which is hardy outside in mild areas.\n\nWatch out for confusion with the hardy pond plant bog arum (Calla palustris). Calla palustris needs to be grown in shallow water at the edge of a pond, even though the name and white flowers may sound alike.\n\nHow to plant calla lily (Zantedeschia)\n\nCalla lily grows from thick rhizomes or fleshy roots that are sold when dormant in winter or spring. Ready-grown plants can be bought in spring and summer, often when in full flower.\n\nBuy in the winter or spring and plant 8–10 cm deep in a good, peat-free multipurpose potting compost to grow from rhizomes that are dormant. Either pot up and start into growth indoors for earlier flowers, or plant outside after the frosts. Plants that were grown indoors need to be “hardened off” or acclimatized to the outdoors by being left out for longer and longer periods of time.\n\nIf you want to grow calla lilies in the ground, make the soil better by adding a lot of well-rotted compost or a special soil conditioner. Space plants 30-45 cm apart.\n\nHow to care for calla lily (Zantedeschia)\n\nRegular watering is important to maintain the handsome lush growth of calla lilies. Ideally, keep compost moist but take care not to over-water either. Once the calla lily shoots start to flower, feed them every three to four weeks with a liquid fertilizer that is high in potash, like tomato fertilizer. Regularly remove dead and faded flower stems and leaves.\n\nOnce the flowers are gone, feed and water the calla lily every few weeks, but be careful not to give it too much water, until the leaves start to fall off. Bring potted plants indoors before the frosts and leave in the pot whilst dormant. If you want to keep your calla lilies alive all winter, dig them up and put the rhizomes in trays of just-moist compost. Make sure they are kept somewhere cool and out of the frost. Moving the roots to a new pot with wet compost in late winter and setting it somewhere warm will help it grow.\n\nDividing Calla Lilies\n\nHow do you divide calla lily bulbs?\n\nDividing calla lily bulbs is a simple process that can help propagate and rejuvenate your plants. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do it: Timing: The best time to divide calla lily bulbs is during their dormant period, which is typically in late winter or early spring.\n\nShould you divide calla lilies?\n\nIncrease in Quantity: Dividing calla lily bulbs allows you to multiply your plant collection. Each division can be replanted separately, resulting in more calla lilies in your garden or for sharing with others. Space Management: If your calla lilies have outgrown their designated area, dividing the bulbs helps manage space.\n\nWhen is the best time to divide calla lily bulbs?\n\nTiming: The best time to divide calla lily bulbs is during their dormant period, which is typically in late winter or early spring. Preparation: Start by preparing the necessary materials, including gardening gloves, a spade or garden fork, a clean and sharp knife or garden shears, and potting soil or compost.\n\nWhat happens if you divide calla lily bulbs?\n\nThere are a few potential problems that can arise when dividing calla lily bulbs: Damage to the bulbs: Dividing calla lily bulbs involves physically separating them into smaller sections. If not done carefully, there is a risk of damaging the bulbs, which can affect their ability to grow and thrive."
