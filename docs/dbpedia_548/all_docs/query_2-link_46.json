        "text": "This information is provided as a free service to viewers. We do not sell these plants.\n\nSoil: They like moist, rich spoils with plenty of organic matter added like compost. Originating from the swamps of South Africa you will need to ensure they have regular access to water, so a layer of mulch will help retain it in warm weather.\n\nChoose a sunny location, though a little shade throughout the day is well tolerated.\n\nMaintenance: When they are actively growing you should keep them well watered and feed with a liquid formulation once a fortnight. However do not feed while in flower.\n\nThey are not frost hardy so ensure they are well protected in winter or you can dig them up and dry them out and store in a dry location, to re-plant again in springtime.\n\nDiseases: None of note.\n\nInvasiveness: It has escaped cultivation to become naturalised in many parts of the world including South Western Australia where it is known to clog up waterways and wetlands.\n\nToxicity: Arum lily contains a mineral called calcium oxalate. All parts of the plant, especially the flower, are poisonous to humans, livestock and pets and can cause:\n\n- eczema and dermatitis\n\n- irritation, burning and swelling of the mouth and throat\n\n- breathing difficulties\n\n- severe nausea, vomiting and stomach pain\n\n- diarrhoea\n\n- shock and exhaustion\n\n- death in rare cases.\n\nOther Species: There are six species in the Zantedeschia genus of tuberous perennials including Zantedeschia aethiopica\n\nZantedeschia odorata\n\nZantedeschia elliottiana\n\nZantedeschia jucunda\n\nZantedeschia pentlandii\n\nZantedeschia rehmanii\n\nAuthor: Bob Saunders."
