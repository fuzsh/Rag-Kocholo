Spathe to about 15 cm long, bright yellow outside, greenish-yellow inside.\n\nThe possible hybrid background of this species is still under investigation.\n\nZ. albomaculata (Hook.) Baill., Spotted Lily, from S Africa has translucently spotted leaves like Z. elliottiana and is occasionally available; it differs in having much larger and more narrowly ovate leaves to about 40 cm long and 20 cm wide.\n\nZ. rehmannii Engl., Pink or Red Calla, from S Africa is distinctive for its elliptic-lanceolate leaves with blades to about 40 cm long and 6 cm wide, and its mostly rosy purple spathes in spring to summer.\n\nS Africa (but unknown in nature)."
