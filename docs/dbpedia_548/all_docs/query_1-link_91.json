        "text": "Calla lily (Zantedeschia aethiopica) is a distinctive, long-blooming plant with impressive trumpet-shaped flowers atop sturdy green stems. This South African native, which can reach mature heights of 3 feet (1 m.), is considered a marginal aquatic plant, which means it grows in moist soil along riverbanks, ponds or streams, or around the edge of a water garden or rain garden. While calla lily is a relatively low-maintenance plant, it won’t tolerate excessively dry conditions or soggy, poorly drained soil. Read on to learn about calla lily water requirements.\n\nWhen to Water Calla Lilies\n\nYour calla lily's watering needs depend on whether they are grown in the garden or in containers. Your current growing conditions, like the amount of light or soil type, should be factored in as well. How much water do calla lilies need in the garden? Water outdoor calla lilies regularly, providing sufficient water to keep the soil evenly moist. If the soil doesn’t drain well, improve it by adding compost or other organic materials. How to water calla lilies in pots? Potted calla lilies should also be watered frequently to keep the potting mix evenly moist but not soggy. Use a well-draining potting mix; although calla lilies like moisture, they don’t do well in saturated, poorly drained soil. A soilless mix containing coarse materials, such as pine bark, mulch, or sand, can provide proper drainage. Remember that calla lilies in pots will dry out much more quickly than lilies planted in the ground.\n\nTips on Calla Lily Watering"
