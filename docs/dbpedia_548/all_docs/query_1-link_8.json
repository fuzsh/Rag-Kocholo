        "text": "Although called the arum lily, Zantedeschia aethiopica is neither an arum (the genus Arum) nor a lily (genus Lilium). However, it is associated with the lily as a symbol of purity, and these elegant flowers have graced many bridal bouquets, as seen in this picture of a South African bride in 1934.\n\nIt is an excellent cut flower and lasts a long time in water. Nowadays there are other forms of this species which will enliven an old theme: the 'Marshmallow' with a creamy pink spathe (outer \"petal\" which is actually a modified leaf) and rose-pink throat, and the 'Green Goddess' with a green and white spathe. There is also an attractive form with leaves spotted white.\n\nZantedeschia aethiopica grows from 0.6-1 m but may get taller in the shade. It has lush-looking dark green leaves with an arrow head shape. The size varies according to the amount of shade. The flowers appear in a main flush from August to January, although there may be the odd flower at other times of the year also. The white arum forms large colonies in marshy areas ranging from the coast to an altitude of 2 250 m. Thus one will find them contending with humid, salt laden air at the coast and freezing, misty mountain grasslands at high altitudes. They are very versatile in the garden as a result."
