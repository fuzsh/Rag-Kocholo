        "text": "These were sent to me as a seedling by a member on another forum about 16 months ago. They were supposedly Gloriosa lutea but I'm beginning to question that. To be fair, when I potted them on a few weeks ago the tubers looked right - like crooked fingers. But I'm not sure at the moment.\n\nThe leaves.................\n\nLeaves emerging.....................\n\nStem detail...................\n\nThe whole plants today....................\n\nI could ask him, but as he is dealing with a family illness I'd rather not bother him at this time.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nI have loads of that already - the tubers are different to these.\n\nSome regard A.maculatum as a weed, but I love it. There is a clump growing in the car park behind the offices over the road that has a rich purple picotee edge - I'll be having some of those when they die back (marked with a rock already).\n\nI was expecting a coloured flower (given the mottled foliage), but I suppose Zantedeschia doesn't always follow the rule of \"plain leaf, white flower, hardy\" and \"Mottled leaf, coloured flower, not hardy\" ?\n\nI had assumed that they are not hardy. Easy in a pot, so easy to store once dormant.\n\nPersonally, I was relieved about the colour. I had nightmares about it being pink!\n\nI'm growing Calla lilies for the first time this year from corms and I bought them because they were gaudy! Not in bloom yet but they should be bright yellow and I wanted them to cheer up a dull spot amongst plants that are mostly foliage."
