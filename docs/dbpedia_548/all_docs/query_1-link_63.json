        "text": "Growing Requirements for Calla Plants\n\nCalla Lilies should be planted in a location that gets full sun for most of the day, but some late afternoon shade, particularly in hot summer regions. Callas grow best in a moist, well drained soil that has been enriched with compost and other organic matter.\n\nFertilize monthly with a good all-purpose fertilizer when actively growing.\n\nKeep well mulched to preserve soil moisture.\n\nTake precautions to protect your Callas from slugs and snails.\n\nIn areas where Callas are not hardy, dig the rhizomes in early fall, clean off excess soil,\n\nlet dry out of the direct sun for a few days, and store them\n\nin vermiculite or dry peat moss in a cool (50°-55°), dry place.\n\nHow to Plant Calla Lily Rhizomes\n\nCalla Lily rhizomes can be planted in either the spring or fall in zones 8-11.\n\nIn other areas, they can be planted in the spring after daytime temperatures remain above 55 °.\n\nPrepare your planting hole by mixing in compost, peat moss and bone meal.\n\nPlant the tubers horizontally, 12 inches apart, with the eyes facing up.\n\nZ. aethiopica and Z. albomaculata rhizomes should be planted 4-5 inches deep in warm areas\n\nand 6 inches deep in zone 7.\n\nZ. elliottiana and Z. rehmannii rhizomes should be planted 2 inches deep.\n\nAfter planting, water your Callas generously, soaking the soil.\n\nGrowing Calla Lily Plants in Containers\n\nWhen they are grown in pots, Calla Lilies should be kept constantly wet and should be given a weak solution of liquid plant food every 3 weeks while they are showing signs of new growth.\n\nIndoors, grow them in a sunny window at a temperature of about 70° F.\n\nRemove the flowers when they begin to fade.\n\nWhen the plant has finished blooming, allow the foliage to mature and gradually reduce watering until the leaves have all died back.\n\nAllow the tubers to rest for two or three months in the dry pot. The tubers of the Golden Calla should be left exposed in a warm, dry room for 3-4 weeks.\n\nAfter the ripening period, the tubers can again be repotted in fresh soil, and the process begun again.\n\nWater sparingly until the new growth is well above the surface of the soil, then keep the soil constantly moist again.\n\nPropagating Calla Lilies and Growing them from Seed\n\nWhen large clumps of Calla Lilies get crowded and the flower size decreases, they should be dug up and divided into sections containing a minimum of three rhizomes per section. Pink and Golden Calla Lily Plants are somewhat more difficult to divide because their rhizomes sometimes rot after they have been cut. Dusting the fresh cuts with a rooting hormone may help.\n\nSince Calla seeds tend to get gobbled up by birds and rodents when planted directly in the garden, it is a good idea to start your seeds indoors in small pots and then move your plants into the garden at an appropriate time.\n\nDo not cover Calla seeds, because they require light for germination!\n\nSow seeds indoors in early spring and maintain a temperature in the moist growing medium of 70°-75° during germination, which takes 30-35 days.\n\nCalla Lily\n\nZantedeschia aethiopica\n\nPink Calla\n\nZantedeschia rehmannii"
