        "text": "Calla Lilies love full sun and require at least 6 hrs a day to produce good blooms. They should produce between 3 and 7 flowers in their first year, becoming stronger and more vigorous once settled in, plants should provide pups in a year or two.\n\nCalla Lilies or Zantedeschias comprise several types; including Zantedeschia aethiopica (commonly known as Arum Lilies) and Zantedeschia hybrids. The hybrid varieties or Calla Lilies are similar to Zantedeschia aethiopica, though they do not like shade or wet areas and tend to be smaller plants that multiply less readily."
