Zantedeschia elliottiana, golden arum or golden calla lily, yellow calla lily, is a herbaceous ornamental plant in the family Araceae. It grows from a bulb. It is said to occur in the province of Mpumalanga in South Africa,[1] although other sources say that it is not found in the wild but appears to be a hybrid of garden origin.[2]
