        "text": "PRIME MINISTER\n\nTRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE CONCLUSION OF\n\nTHE SPECIAL PISHERS' CONFERENCE WITH THE FEDERAL\n\nTREASURER PAUL KEATING, PREMIERS NICK GREINER, JOAN\n\nKIRNER, WAYNE GOSS, JOHN BANNON, MICHAEL FIELD AND CARMEM\n\nLAWRENCE, CHIEF MINISTERS TREVOR KAINE AND MARSHALL\n\nPERRON AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN LOCAL\n\nGOVER1MT ASSOCIATION, GRAKNE FRBCKR, PARLIAMENT HOUSE,\n\nBRISBANE, 31 OCTOBER 1990.\n\nH OZ PROOF ONLY\n\nPM: OK I'll be making a brief introductory\n\nstatement, then asking my colleagues to follow, then\n\nwe'll be available for questions.\n\nAt the outset of course I want to thank my colleague the\n\nTreasurer and Deputy Prime Minister for his involvement\n\nand cooperation and then particularly to thank my\n\ncolleagues trom the States and the Territories and the\n\nrepresentative of local government for their\n\nparticipation and the attitude that's been displayed and\n\ninvolved in this Conference. No doubt in the lead up to\n\nand during this Conference there's been a lot of jargon,\n\nsome rather complex concepts tossed around. Today very\n\nsimply what wo can say is that out of this Conference\n\nthere has been introduced a new commonsense constructive\n\ndimension into Comonwealth-State Federal relations of a\n\nkind that I cartainly haven't witnessed before in my\n\nperiod of Prime Ministership and which I think none of us\n\ncan probably recall in recent memory. And again, as I\n\nsay, I thank all those who have contributed to that both\n\nat the level of leadership and I believe we also owe a\n\nconsiderable debt of gratitude to our officials at the\n\nCommonwealth and at the State level as well. Their\n\ncontribution should be recognised and it is.\n\nWhat we have done in this Conference is to have jointly\n\naccepted responsibility for doing these things. Firstly\n\nfor creating a more efficient, competitive infrastructure\n\nin this country. Without being exhaustive, you've seen\n\nwhat we've done in the area of rail freight, roads and\n\nelectricity und reform of Government trading enterprises.\n\nWe have accepted the responsibility for reducing the vast\n\nregulatory overlapping and overlay that exists between\n\nCommonwealth and States. We are going to simplify that\n\nsituation which will be of benefit to consumers and to\n\nbusiness. We have committed ourselves to the more\n\neffective delivery of a wide range of services to the\n\ncitizens of this country. We have committed ourselves to\n\ngetting a more effective and efficient cooperative\n\nrelationship and identification of roles and\n\nresponsibilities in the increasingly important area of\n\nthe environment. And in the area of industrial relations\n\nwe have committed ourselves to continuing to improve the\n\nincreasing cooperation which is existing between\n\nCommonwealth and State Tribunals. Let me make this\n\nimportant point that what we have done is to make already\n\ncertain specific decisions that's done. In the area,\n\nfor instance, of having signed together the Heads of\n\nAgreement for the establishment of the National Rail\n\nFreight Corporation; also in regard to uniform food\n\nstandards. But importantly what we've done then is to\n\nestablish a process with deadlines, with specific time\n\nframes. he I said briefly in the press conference I had\n\nyesterday, if-you look at the range and the complexity of\n\nthe issues with which we've dealt, it would of course\n\nhave been beyond any intelligent analysis to assume that\n\nin that whole range of issues you just sit down and make\n\ndecisions today on those issues. What we had to do was\n\nto identify the issues and then establish not simply a\n\nreview system but a process of dealing with these issues\n\nwith specific firm deadlines to come to conclusion. And\n\nthat's what has been done. Importantly, of course, from\n\nthe point of view of the States, we have agreed to\n\naddress the issue of Commonwealth-State relations with a\n\ncommitment on our part to aim at a reduction of the\n\nfiscal imbalance with the States accepting in that\n\nprocess the obligation which must be with the\n\nCommonwealth to retain the capacity for proper macroeconomic\n\nmanagement. But that's a commitment on our part\n\nto aim at the reduction of the vertical fiscal imbalance\n\nwith that condition there in everyone's mind and we have\n\nalso given unqualified commitment to a reduction in the\n\nproportion of grants that go from the Commonwealth to the\n\nStates which are in tied form.\n\nSo, if I can bring all those things together, what we've\n\nbeen about is accepting and discharging the\n\nresponsibility of creating more of fici ent and more\n\neffective government in this country. Put very simply we\n\nall recognise that there is a need in the community for\n\nAustralia to become more efficient and more competitive;\n\nthat we've accepted the reality that neither the\n\nCommonwealth or the States, separately or together$ can\n\nbe going to the community and saying and that includes\n\nbusiness and trade unions saying we want you to be more\n\nefficient and more competitive if we don't accept on our\n\npart the responsibility of making our own operation more\n\nefficient, more cooperative, more effective and that's\n\nwhat we've been about. So that from the point of view of\n\nGovernment, we can create the more efficient, more\n\ncompetitive infrastructure and delivery of services to\n\ncitizens through better government and better relations\n\nand from that basis say with authority to the community\n\nI\n\nthat in totality we want a more efficient, a more\n\ncompetitive community.\n\nNow let me finally make this point that when I announced\n\nthis initiative in July of this year I made the point\n\nthen that I wanted to see two streams of action going on\n\nin this period of the last decade of the first century of\n\nFederation. There was this process which was started\n\nthen and which with the magnificent response of my\n\ncolleagues we have efficiently started with the results\n\nalready there and with future results guaranteed within\n\nan established time frame. But the next time that I meet\n\nwith my colleagues will not be at the next Special\n\nConference in May. We'll be meeting in April and that is\n\nwhen we have that centenary meeting if you like, that is\n\nthe meeting which will deal with the question of the\n\nConstitution. What we're doing now is to make the\n\ndecisions which are necessary within the existing\n\nconstitutional framework, that we are committed at the\n\nFederal level, and I believe that the States are going to\n\nbe cooperative in this, to having a process of review of\n\nthe Constitution. We will be having that Conference in\n\nApril which will be the centenary of the first meeting of\n\nthe colonies in April 1891. So that together, not by way\n\nof imposition but together, we can examine whether there\n\nare amendments of our Constitutional compact which we can\n\nagree on to make for better governance in this country.\n\nSo we are working within the existing system, as we must\n\ndo, to make it more efficient but we are also going to be\n\nlooking I hope to whether we can get in some respects a\n\nmore relevant constitutional framework for the future.\n\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, I conclude as I began. I had\n\ngreat hopes in July when I launched this initiative but I\n\nsaid then that success was going to depend upon\n\ncooperation and a commitment of leadership. And in both\n\nthose respects my expectations have been more than\n\nexceeded and for that, colleagues, I extend to you my\n\nsincere gratitude. Nick.\n\nMR GREINERI Thank you Prime Minister. I think the\n\nmost significant potential gain is actually not in the\n\ncommunique. It's the first point the Prime Minister made\n\nand that is that this Conference has, I hope,\n\nirretrievably changed some of the political mindsets in\n\nAustralia. And we've consistently, over our history, had\n\na mindset that was adversarial rather than cooperative,\n\nthat was negative rather than positive, and that's\n\nbedevilled so much in politics and public policy in\n\nAustralia. And I think its certainly started a dramatic\n\nchange as far as those attitudes go and I think the\n\nchange in attitude is very consistent with the feelings\n\nof the public in Australia. I hope its also started to\n\nbreak down some of the shibboleths about Federal and\n\nState. The word ' national' appears quite often in the\n\ncommunique. I think it is important to say that\n\n' national' isn't the same as ' federal'. National means\n\nthat everyones cooperating. In some cases it may mean\n\nI\n\n4.\n\nits going to be ' done' by Canberra. In many other cases\n\nit will be ' done' by the States. But the point is that\n\nthere is a national perspective and that's very different\n\nfrom the normal black and white approach that we've\n\nconsistently had is this Canberra's or is it the\n\nState's. I think that's a significant change as well.\n\nIt goes without saying that this is only the first step.\n\nIn many ways the first step is the hardest. I think I\n\nshould warn that I suspect the empires will. strike back.\n\nI don't think any of us believe that the next Federal\n\nstages of the procesas are likely to be easy. I believe\n\nthe empires include some of the Ministers, some of the\n\nbureaucracies and some of the private vested interests,\n\nand none of that's at all surprising, in fact its all\n\nobvious. But there is no doubt that the process of\n\nchange, which is undoing what are often narrow vested\n\ninterests that have been long established and well\n\nestablished, is going to be difficult. And I certainly\n\nwant to say as far as I'm concerned that I don't propose\n\nto brook any opposition from any of those empires within\n\nNew South Wales and I would be confident that will be the\n\nattitude of the Heads of Government because the process\n\ndepends, fundamentally depends, on maintaining the\n\npolitical momentum from the top. The only other point\n\nI'd like to make, Prime Minister, is that I'd also like\n\nto thank the bureaucracies I'm not always known for\n\nbeing the greatest booster of the public sector, I think\n\nthe bureaucracies at each level have done a tremendous\n\njob in laying the groundwork for this Conference and they\n\ndeserve some plaudits for it. But I do think it has been\n\nthe most constructive thing that I've done in two and\n\nthree quarter years as Premier, certainly the most\n\nconstructive meeting of this kind. I hope that in a year\n\nor two we'll be able to genuinely say that its historic\n\nas well.\n\nPM: Thanks very much Nick. Joan...\n\nXIRNER: Thank you Prime Minister. May I start by\n\nsaying Prime Minister again thank you for having the\n\nvision and the leadership and the patience to enable this\n\nconference to happen and to thank your officers and our\n\nofficers and advisers for the work they've put in in\n\nensuring that there was a cooperative framework and real\n\nresults from the Conference. I always think I'm very\n\nfortunate that as a new Premier at this Conference, to\n\nhave been denied by the Conference for ever the\n\nmisfortune of attending Premiers' Conferences which are\n\nabout division and no results, and so I'm very pleased\n\nthat we've now got a framework which will enable future\n\nPremiers' Conferences, whether on these issues or in the\n\nfinancial area, to be productive. And I'm quite sure the\n\nAustralian community will welcome that as well. For\n\nVictoria, there are three very important issues. The\n\nfirst one, Commonwealth-State financial relations will\n\nas Nick Greiner said yesterday the result of that will\n\nreally only be seen at the end of twelve months' hard\n\nwork. And I can assure you Prime Minister that Victoria\n\nwill put in the hard work on that issue. The two other\n\nareas are national rail freight and road reform.\n\nVictoria has been important as the largest manufacturing\n\nindustry state, requires that, as the nation does, that\n\nthose two reforms and we're well on the way to being part\n\nof that historic reform. The third area is the area of\n\nurban consolidation and we look forward to working with\n\nthe Commonwealth and the private sector to ensure that\n\nthe kinds of cities we have in the year 2000 are the\n\nkinds of cities that people would want them to be.\n\nPM: Thanks very much Joan. Wayne\n\nGOSS: Thanks Bob. I'm not sure if there's any\n\nhistoric or original lines left. I'll just make two or\n\nthree points. And that is that I think just as important\n\nas the Agreement itself today is the approach that's been\n\nbrought to bear, the cooperative approach, the approach\n\nof striving to seek agreement rather than make a point,\n\nand that's important because it not only represents a\n\nfundamental change in the way in which these Conferences\n\nproceed, but its absolutely vital to the program of work\n\nthat we've set ourselves. As has already been pointed\n\nout, some of the very big decisions come from the Special\n\nPremiers' Conferences next year and its going to be vital\n\nextent of the achievement of those big decision that\n\nthe cooperative approach, an approach based on, I think,\n\nthe national good, is maintained. The second point I\n\nwant to make is that this could not have occurred but for\n\nthe Prime Minister's initiative and it could not have\n\nsucceeded but for the fact that not only did all their\n\ntake a very responsible and cooperative approach, but\n\nthe Commonwealth was prepared to put on the table the\n\nPrime Minister and the Treasurer were prepared to put on\n\nthe table more than has ever been put on the table\n\nbefore. And I think that was vital to the securing of\n\nthe cooperation of the States which I think this State\n\nwas very much inclined to do, but I think, of course,\n\nvery conducive to that. And lastly I suppose, as the\n\npoint out, how the warm sunny climate of Queensland is so\n\nconducive to friendly agreement.\n\nPM: Thank you Wayne. And Carmen, Western Australia.\n\nLAWRENCE: Thank you very much. Just to pick up on\n\nWayne's last point, given that the next principal one\n\nwill be in Porth in November. I expect that the hard\n\nwork that we all know has to be done for negotiations to\n\ndetailed discussions will come to fruition of a kind that\n\nwe believe is possible as the result of decisions that\n\nwere made in the last day and a half. Like the other\n\nPremiers and the Prime Minister, I think its important we\n\nall recognise that this is a beginning and that all of us\n\nhave a responsibility to break down some of the barriers\n\nof the past, those ideodlogies, those inflexibilities\n\nthat have meant that we've been rivals rather than\n\npartners. What we've seen here is the development of a\n\npartnership where ideology and sectional interests have\n\nbeen set aside and I think set aside for ever. I don't\n\nbelieve that we can now go back to those old positions.\n\nIt will mean that many of us have a hard job in selling\n\nthe initiatives that we have set in place today and, as\n\nhas been said, there will be resistance, there will be\n\ndifficulties. We're talking about substantial reform of\n\nthe entire government in Australia. We're talking about\n\nchanges to finances, we're talking about changes to work\n\npractices, we're talking about changes to our\n\norganisations of a very fundamental kind and I think\n\nwhat's needed here is a maintaining of that political\n\nmomentum. so that what is I think a break through, will\n\nresult in tangible benefits in addition to the few that\n\nwe've seen coming out of this Conference. Significant\n\nbenefits I might say, but they need to be built on and\n\nthey need to be built on firmly. In the end what we're\n\nall talking about is a more effective government, more\n\neffective services at a reduced cost both to business and\n\nfamilies. If we can't deliver on that then we will have\n\nraised expectations unhelpfully. I believe we can\n\ndeliver and I know the commitment is there from Western\n\nAustralia to ensure that we are, perhaps for the first\n\ntime in heart, part of the Federation.\n\nPM: Thanks very much Carmen. John.\n\nBANNON: Prime Minister, in its own way I think this\n\nConference represents one of the most rapid and farreaching\n\nchanges we've seen in Australia. Reflecting in\n\na sense twelve months or so in Central and Eastern\n\nEurope. And I say that because you may recall that its\n\njust four months ago that a similar Conference of the\n\nHeads of Government was being held in Canberra after the\n\nPremiers' Conference, with two notable absentees, the\n\nPrime minister and the Federal Treasurer, and certainly\n\nwith a very different tone and attitude. How we got to\n\nthis stage so quickly I think the answer lies obviously\n\nin a number of areas, but I'd just like to mention three.\n\nI think at last we are waking up as a nation to our place\n\nin the world. How vulnerable we are, how international\n\ntrading, political and other relationships are changing\n\nso quickly that Australia is going to be left behind and\n\nbadly behind if we can't internationalise. We can only\n\ninternationalise if we are operating as an efficient\n\nFederation. If we continue to produce the division, the\n\nlack of national approach and national unity here we are\n\nin diabolical trouble. That message is now I think\n\ngetting across generally in our community but certainly\n\nvery apparent at this Conference. The second thing, I\n\nthink, is that experience of four months ago. That\n\nPremiers' Conference, and I've been to more than any of\n\nthose sitting along this table, I'm a sort of relic of\n\nthe Fraser age in fact, which is a dangerous thing to be\n\nin politics. But the fact is that I've seen a consistent\n\nand steady deterioration over the last few years, after\n\ninitial first flush of enthusiasm when Bob Hawke and his\n\nGovernment was elected, relations have deteriorated\n\nsharply. They've got tense, some were difficult. The\n\nPremier's Coniference has been a less and less\n\nsatisfactory procedure and it reached its nadir in June\n\nof this year. Thank goodness its now picked up and I\n\nthink the taking stock that followed that Conference\n\nresulted in all of us thinking we cannot see a repeat of\n\nthat, we've got to pull ourselves together and make this\n\noperate better. The third factor I'd like to mention is\n\nthe leadership the Prime minister has shown which we all\n\nvery much acknowledge and the willingness of all the\n\nStates and Territories to cooperate in that project.\n\nThis is just a beginning. I talked about the pace of\n\nchange a minute ago. We've really got to maintain the\n\nsense of urgency and pace in the working tasks we've set\n\nourselves. if we can't show tangible progress within the\n\nnext six to twelve months then all this goodwill and the\n\nbeautiful climate in Queensland will have been wasted.\n\nPM: Thanks very much John. Michael Field, Tasmania\n\nFIELD: Thanks. Just a couple of comments. Its very\n\ndifficult to try and be original at this stage. But a\n\nfew things. It does represent at this Conference a\n\nchange in mindset that I think is obvious to every\n\nobserver at the Conference. That for the first tine\n\nPremiers are talking beyond give me and the Federal\n\nGovernment saying no we won't rather than constructively\n\ntrying to work through solutions to problems. That's\n\nwhat's happened here and everybody here recognises the\n\nurgent need for Australia to address problems that the\n\npolitical will hasn't been capable of even coming\n\ntogether to talk about them and certainly not trying to\n\nresolve them. So its important that that change in\n\nmindset continues and continues back in the States and at\n\na national level where there's a lot of people who would\n\nbe looking at alarm at what's happened here because their\n\nmindsets And so its up to the Premiers to go back\n\nto their States and convince those cynics back in the\n\nStates that there can be great achievements made and we\n\nhave to keep the momentum going and we have to\n\nauthentically lead our States through to where these\n\nissues have now openly discussed can be resolved\n\nbecause,, as I think John Bannon said, given the nature of\n\nAustralia's place in the world it is essential now that\n\nwe work as one nation to resolve the emerging issues that\n\nare putting such pressure on all of us in Australia,\n\nevery State and, of course, the national Government.\n\nPM Thanks very much Michael. Trevor Kaine, the ACT.\n\nKAINE: Well, the question is how many different ways can\n\nyou say it. But in my opening remarks yesterday I noted\n\nthat this Conference had the potential to make decisions\n\nthat would lead to fundamental change in the way\n\ngovernment was performed in Australia. And I think that\n\nwith the Prime Minister leading the debate we have taken\n\nthe decisions that now can potentially fundamentally\n\nchange the relationship between government in Australia\n\nand the way government is performed. It has to do with\n\naccountability. If all of the changes are put into\n\neffect it could put a higher l. evel of accountability on\n\nthe States for what they do and the Territories. It has\n\nto do with the better use of resources, it has to do with\n\neliminating duplication and in effect that can lead to\n\nreduction in the expenditure of public money. I think\n\nthey are decisions that collectively can do something for\n\nthe Australian economy and if its good for the Australian\n\neconomy its good for the States and it doesn't matter\n\nwhether an Australian lives in the ACT or in Perth or in\n\nBrisbane, whatever is good for the economy directly or\n\nindirectly, is good for the individual Australian. And I\n\nthink, Prime Minister, that we've laid the groundwork.\n\nIt has yet to be put into effect. I think the\n\nestablishment of two more special Premiers' Conferences\n\nnext year where we can review, these are the things that\n\nwe've decided are in fact being put into effect, Its a\n\ngood thing to do to monitor and to ensure that our\n\ndecisions are in fact carried out. I'll be looking\n\nforward to seeing the results. I think it has been\n\nproductive, we've had a spirit of cooperation, we've had\n\na positive approach to our collective problems. It's\n\nbeen a great Conference.\n\nPH: Thanks Trevor. Marshall Perron from the Northern\n\nTerritory. PERRON: Prime Minister. Yes, despite it being the last\n\ndecade of the first century of Federation, the remnants\n\nof colonial administration are still alive and well in\n\nAustralia today but hopefully the new founded infectious\n\nspirit of cooperation that we all have and there is\n\ncertainly a new atmosphere about this Conference which\n\nhasn't been to the previous ten Premiers* Conferences\n\nthat I've attended hopefully that new spirit will mean\n\nthat from our point of view the Commonwealth will\n\nseriously look at the remnant powers that it has in the\n\nNorthern Territory which it does not have in the States\n\nand put us on a true footing as equal hustralians,\n\nsetting aside the Federal political representation\n\nquestion. I think that the decisions that have been made\n\ntoday, providing they are followed up properly by the\n\nworking parties they've all been referred to, and I'm\n\nsure they'll be monitored very closely, can produce a\n\nsignificant step forward in more efficient administration\n\nfor Australia and that's what we're all here for.\n\nPM: Thanks very much Marshall. And finally, the\n\nrepresentative of Local Government, Graeme.\n\nFRECKER: Thank you Prime Minister. I guess you keep the\n\nbest till last and if you want a symbol of the change in\n\nattitude towards Federalism that's the very presence of\n\nlocal government in these discussions for the first time.\n\nLocal government has a great deal to offer and the States\n\nand the Commonwealth have to recognise that in this\n\nConference and we owe particular thanks to the Prime\n\nminister for having the to see that coming about.\n\nI' Local governments stand and deliver services to the\n\npeople of Australia and my 9,000 colleagues would have me\n\nsay that they are working in the national interest as\n\nPremier Greiner has said, working in the national\n\ninterest to see if we can't be more efficient. And you\n\nneed better relationships if you are to be more efficient\n\nand that is what we are on about. There is a world-wide\n\nmovement of localism and the Premiers and the Prime\n\nMinister have! captured that thought and in our presence\n\nhere and the work that must flow from this I believe that\n\nwe can build a better Australia.\n\nPM: Thanks very much Graeae.\n\n~ JOURNALIST: seriously address the degree of vertical\n\nfiscal imbalance.\n\nKEATING: You', I think that's yes but the part of that\n\nhas come about by virtue of the fact that, well, the\n\noperation of policy under this system over a very long\n\nperiod of timie. So it's not a fact, it's not about the\n\nfact that thet States have been starved of funds. It's\n\njust that their discretion over the funds and the growth\n\nof the funds is the issue. I think that's an issue we're\n\nprepared to look at. But it is important, as both the\n\nPrime Minister and I have said and the Communique Bays,\n\nto at the same time preserve Commonwealth macro-economic\n\noptions. in relation to the national expenditure and\n\nrevenue effort which has been such an important part of\n\nbuilding national savings. Now within that constraint I\n\nthink it's highly desirable to look at the issue in a\n\nbasic way to see if some of that imbalance can be\n\nredressed. flow, a number of Premiers have talked about\n\nmaintaining t: he principle of equalisation. Equalisation\n\ncan't be maintained without some vertical imbalance.\n\nBecause if there is no vertical imbalance there can be no\n\nequalisation. So nobody's talking about an absolute\n\nabolition of the vertical imbalance but a redressing of\n\nit and I think, you know, we're happy enough to look at\n\nin in that context.\n\nJOURNALIST: substanial and do you see any scope for\n\nnew State taxes? What is your view to the Commonwealth\n\nmoving somewhat out of the income tax field to give the\n\nStates some\n\nKEATING: Well that's what the inquiry's about. That'* s\n\nwhat it's about. It's not about what my view is.\n\nJOURNALIST: What are your views?\n\nKEATING: Well it's not about my views. Not now anyway.\n\nJOURNALXST: But can you just answer the first part of\n\nthe question. Do you think there's much scope the\n\nsubstantial change opening remarks yesterday I think\n\nthe mood is one of substantial change. So as Treasurer\n\ndo you think that is possible?\n\nKEATING: Well I think it's about we've now got to the\n\npoint where macro-economic policy is really cast into a\n\nset of optimums in terms of the size of the general\n\nGovernment recurrent surpluses, the discipline on\n\ncommonwealth and State recurrent budget outlays, the\n\noperation of monetary policy and wages policy. So\n\nmicro-economic reform and change in the way in which the\n\nmicro areas of the economy function are very important.\n\nThe largest new issue, the largest new issue, coming\n\nissue in Australian economic policy is the infrastructure\n\nof the States. So if, as a result of these arrangements,\n\nwe see improved performance in the infrastructure\n\nparticularly in transport and much of what's been done\n\nhere yesterday is about that road and rail then we're\n\ngoing to end up with a more efficient economy. And that\n\nkind or an economy, I think, one which is operating\n\nbetter and operating more with a national complexion\n\nrather than the complexion of a number of States, I think\n\nprovides certainly some scope economic scope and\n\npolitical scope for having a perhaps more desirable\n\nbalance from the States' point of view in this question\n\nof the revenue and expenditure efforts.\n\nJOURNALIST: Won't any imbalance though reduce your\n\nmacro control?\n\nKEATING: Well not necessarily. That's part of the\n\nexamination. JOURNALIST: Mr Greiner, last week you set four tests..\n\nthe Liberal Council to be judged on whether or not\n\nits success. Has it met those four tests? So what will\n\nyou be saying to your federal counterparts?\n\nGREINER: I think the meeting has clearly jumped the\n\nfirst hurdle of those tests. And those tests were the\n\nmajor agenda items and I think any realistic assessment\n\nis that significant progress has been made in terms of\n\nsetting direction, establishing principles. so I don't\n\nthink you could reasonably any that any of those four or\n\nfive tests that I set have been failed. As far as my\n\nfederal counterparts are concerned, I've got no doubt at\n\nall that they would be supportive of the process that has\n\nbeen started here. And whilst they'll no doubt have\n\ntheir own differences of emphasis and nuance, I would be\n\namazed if they were other than supportive of the change\n\nwhich as I said in my earlier remarks, the best part of\n\nthe change that's been started is that it is out of the\n\nframework of adversarial. politics.\n\nJOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you've had the opportunity to\n\ncanvas certain opinions of the other Premiers on\n\nconstitutional reform. Do you think you can get\n\nagreement for four year term over the next couple of\n\nyears?\n\n3.1\n\nPM: I haven't specifically addressed that with each of\n\nthe Premiers. But my answer is Yes I believe we can.\n\nReasons? The majority of States themselves have four\n\nyear terms. At the federal level the opposition is in\n\nprinciple in agreement. The problem we have at the\n\nfederal level and I hate bringing politics into it,\n\nNick but the problem that we have at the federal level\n\nwhen it comes to constitutional change we get a\n\nconceptual agreement from the Opposition. But when it\n\ngets down to the line they start to find problems. But\n\nthat's precisely why I'm initiating and supporting a new\n\nprocess. I mean the realities of political life in this\n\ncountry when you come to the question of constitutional\n\nchange is that you've got to have agreement across the\n\nmajor parties and within major community organisations.\n\nSo the processes of constitutional conference that will\n\nstart in April at next year and which I see as a\n\ncontinuing process through this last decade of this\n\ncentury, will be aimed to establish basis of agreement\n\nfor change with the States involved, with all the major\n\npolitical parties involve and with community\n\norganisations. In regard to your specific question, I\n\nwould think yes that we can get agreement of the States\n\nand of the major political parties. It's quite clear\n\nthat major community organisations like the Business\n\nCouncil, trade unions and so on, they all agree that it's\n\nappropriate so I'm very optimistic on that one.\n\nJOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, if you try and achieve\n\nbipartisan support will you bring Mr Hewson into that\n\nprocess? PM: In the constitutional change. Yes, that's been made\n\nquite clear that we want the oppositions in that and\n\nthat's a matter of public record.\n\nJOURNALIST: Mr Greiner, did you also have the Treasurer\n\nin mind whent you talk about the Empire strikes back?\n\nPM: It's bipire clocks not Empire.\n\nGREINER: 1: was going to say I've never thought of the\n\nTreasurer other than In the context French Empires. But\n\nthe PM: Borrowed my line.\n\nGREINER: The Treasurer's got a legitimate interest\n\nwhich has been common ground amongst everyone at this\n\ntable in preserving and it would be common ground with\n\nDr Hewson and Mr Reith. If I was Peter Reith I would\n\nwant to make sure that I had the control of the levers of\n\nmacro-economic policy. I mean I think the starting\n\npresumption, as I did say to the Treasurer during the\n\nConference, the starting presumption given that Australia\n\nis at one end of the spectrum in the world in terms of\n\nthis imbalance, the starting assumption is that you can\n\nin fact do better without any serious way undermining\n\n12.\n\nnational economic policy. out that is what the procoss\n\nof discussion is going to be about over the next twelve\n\nmonths. So I'm sure the Treasurer shares in that spirit.\n\nJOURNALIST: Premier Kirner, could you to an election\n\nselling a dual income taxation system?..\n\nKIRNER: Well we're not going to an election, Vic, so\n\nit's really a hypothetical question.\n\nJOURNALIST: Within two years you might have that\n\ndecision in place.\n\nKIRNER: Within twelve months we'll have an agreed\n\nCommonwealth/ State financial set up and we'll go to an\n\nelection twelve months after that.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how would you rate the\n\nlikelihood of a State income tax twelve months down the\n\ntrack? PM:. Well I've got to go back to the point again that\n\nboth Nick and Paul have gone to. I just don't think it's\n\nterribly helpful for any of us having agreed to establish\n\na process where our officials, under the guidance of our\n\npolitical leadership, are going to examine all the\n\nramifications for us to sort of pre-empt or pre-judge. I\n\nmean what you've got to understand is it's an enormously\n\ncomplex issue. I mean there are constitutional issues\n\ninvolved, there are institutional issues involved, there\n\nare political issues involved and for either me or Paul\n\nor Nick or anyone to say well I think that's what ought\n\nto happen or I think there's a chance this is happening,\n\nit just seems to be a futile exercise. I think the\n\ntruth is that from the point of view of Paul and myself,\n\nwe as political leaders will be instructing our officials\n\nto go into this with an open mind, Say to them, anything\n\nthat the States want to put onto the table or we want put\n\non it, should be there, should be examined, look at what\n\nthe impact is and I think we'd share the major criterion\n\nbetween us. What in the end is going to be best for the\n\ncitizens of this country? Now I don't mind in that\n\ncontext frankly that if they want to say well let's have\n\na look at whether some sort of State income tax, if they\n\nwant to say that, OK, let it be looked at. I don't think\n\nit's helpful if any of us in advance say well I think\n\nthat's the way it ought to go or that's the implication\n\nif you look at that. But it's a very complex issue, you\n\ncan't look at one sort of tax without saying well what's\n\nthe implication of that for the other area of revenue\n\nraising. I just don't think it's helpful.\n\nJOURNALIST: Do you believe that at that process there\n\nmay arise great disparities if there were services\n\noffered between the States and less of a role from the\n\nGrants Commission\n\n13.\n\nPM: Well what you have seen I mean it's very\n\nimportant point. i'm glad you've raised it again because\n\nit enables me to supplement what I said before and what\n\nPaul's gone to. You will see in the terms of reference\n\nwhich are attached to the Communique that there is a\n\nremaining, as there must be, commitment to the concept of\n\nfiscal equalisation. Because if I can put it relatively\n\nthe richer, the better off States, understand that a part\n\nof the federal compact which is now written into a sense\n\nthe very fabric of this nation is the concept that we are\n\nall Australians and we've got to have a situation where\n\nthere is a capacity in the smaller, loe prosperous\n\nStates to provide to the Australian citizens resident in\n\nthose States standards which are comparable to the rest\n\nof Australia. And, as a matter of logic, as I've said\n\nbefore and Paul went to today, if you're going to have\n\nthat concept of fiscal equalisation operative there's got\n\nto be by definition some fiscal, vertical fiscal\n\nimbalance. By definition you can't have fiscal\n\nequalisation if that doesn't, if that's not there. That\n\nwill never mean, of course, it hasn't meant at any stage\n\nof Australia's history and it won't mean at any stage of\n\nthe future, that in terms of per capita income in each\n\nState that it'll1 be exactly the same because that will be\n\na reflection of different resources, different levels of\n\nactivity. But as far as the provision of services via\n\nGovernment, the concept of fiscal equalisation to enable\n\nthem to have similar fiscal effort as far as Governments\n\nare concerned will remain intrinsic and it's reflected in\n\nthe terms of reference.\n\nJOURNALIST: Hr Hawke, would you outline for us what your\n\nplans would be for the April Conference on\n\ncnetitutional change\n\nPM: Well we haven't finalised our position on that.\n\nFrom our point of view, and you remember that we alone\n\nhave not got the responsibility for this, we'll be doing\n\nit in association with the academic institutions and the\n\nStates and other interested bodies, so it is very much a\n\njoint exercise, I will be talking with my people and\n\ngetting what I see from the Commonwealth point of view,\n\nour priorities. I emphasise that I see this as a process\n\nwhich in a uray will replicate that last decade of the\n\nnineteenth century. They took ten years, as you know, to\n\nwork towards; Federation with the they had actually\n\nthree conventions, 91, 97 and 98. Now I think it ought\n\nto be an ongoing process. So that we could hopefully see\n\nas a nation a series of referenda I mean I'm not\n\ntalking about thousands of them -but a series of\n\nreferenda through this decade which would put us in a\n\nposition thatt as we launch into the second century of\n\nFederation vie will be both constitutionally better\n\nequipped anti as a result of these processes in machinery\n\nterms, better equipped. Now without therefore\n\nidentifying all the priorities that I'll take into that\n\nConference, I would pick up the one that was mentioned, I\n\nthink it was by Amanda, about the four year term, I think\n\n14.\n\nthat's something that's got to be dealt with immediately.\n\nI would hope, really hope, that out Of that conference in\n\n91, we will establish the basis whereby i'll be able to\n\ngo into the next election with a referendum on the four\n\nyear term.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you think this new found\n\nnational spirit extend itself to a situation where in the\n\ndeep future we'll see no State Governments at all?\n\nPM: We will see no State Governments at all?\n\nJOURNALIST: Yes,\n\nPM: No, I haven't let me not avoid I mean it is a\n\nmatter of record that in 1979 I said if you were starting\n\nafresh you wouldn't have the system we've got now.\n\nThat's common-You just wouldn't have that system.\n\nIf you were starting perhaps you would have a\n\nnational government and some series of regionals. But\n\nthat's not the reality and I'm about dealing with\n\nrealities. That is not going to be that sort of change\n\nin my lifetime or in the foreseeable future. So the\n\nobligation upon us all is to say this is what we've got,\n\nlet's cooperate to make it work as efficiently as\n\npossible. JOURNALIST: inaudible\n\nKEATING: No, because the area in which the States can\n\napproach the Commonwealth for any further support under\n\nthe globals is for the provisions of upfront costs to\n\nreduce the costs of their infrastructure, particularly\n\nfor redundancies. This is often the problem of trying to\n\nreduce staff levels within Government trading enterprises\n\nthat there is a big upfront cost which with a delayed\n\nbenefit and the fact is most governments just can't\n\nafford that upf ront cost from their general or current\n\nposition. So, you know, in terms of the national\n\neconomic outcome while there is a higher level of public\n\nborrowing. There is a very clear and measurable economic\n\nefficiency benefit down the line and, you know, economic\n\npolicy is all about those kind of trade-of fs and this is\n\na sensible one, in my view.\n\nJOURNALIST: The States have gone beyond that want\n\nspecial payments..\n\nKEATING: No they haven't. well that's not true. That's\n\nnot true. I mean some States may want it but the\n\nCommonwealth is basically not operating the trading\n\nenterprises of the States. That's their responsibility,\n\nnot ours, except for the specified, defined areas, such\n\nas the Rail Freight Corporation, etc.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if you were starting afresh\n\nyou'd probably have a single system of industrial\n\nrelations and those who know moving towards that,\n\n06regareded as just too difficult for the Premiers\n\nPM: No, let's be quite direct about this. There is an\n\nattitude in some quarters in the States that the Concept\n\nof one national system would be ideal. The realities are\n\nthat within the trade union ranks and may i say to some\n\nextent in employer ranks but certainly in the trade\n\nunion ranks, they are happier with a system to which they\n\nare accustomed where they have two jurisdictions. It\n\nsimply is, in the judgement of all of-us, not politically\n\nrealistic at the moment to be saying all right it all\n\ncomes to Canberra. In that circumstance what we've\n\nagreed is alright there's been quite a significant amount\n\nof progress been made in the last 12 to 18 months. I\n\nmean let me tie specific about that. We've now just\n\nconcluded the, process of appointing senior members of\n\nState tribunals to vice presidential positions on the\n\nIndustrial Relations Commission, Which is, you know, an\n\nenormous advaince in terms of integrating approaches to\n\nthe resolution of industrial problems. Co-location of\n\nregistries and actual tribunals and in that sense\n\nsignificant progress has been made and we are committed\n\nto continuine. that sort of process. Now it may well be\n\nthat as that process goes on that a greater degree of\n\nconfidence will arise in the industrial community, both\n\ntrade unions and employers, that it would make sense to\n\nmove to one system. But the community is not ready for\n\nthat yet.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the Communique equity\n\nparticipation in the national railway By that do you\n\nmean private enterprise\n\nPH: We're talking about the possibility of equity\n\nparticipation at the Government level. We don't exclude\n\ncooperation with, involvement of the private sector and\n\nindeed in our~ case the Commonwealth has already allocated\n\n$ 5034 for upgrading rail infrastructure, preparatory to\n\nthe establishment of the Corporation and in that process\n\nit is going -to involve a facilitation of involvement by\n\nthe private isector in developing our rail freight\n\ninfrastructure and making it more efficient. So the\n\nrealities in Australia are the the economic realities\n\nare simple and unavoidable. That is firstly, that\n\ntransport by definition is a fundamentally significant\n\nelement in our economic infrastructure, much more so than\n\nsome of the smaller European countries. Secondly, that\n\nour transport infrastructure involves now an\n\ninter-relationship between the public and the private\n\nsector and we shouldn't have any ideological hang-ups in\n\nour Judgement, and I think I reflect the view of all the\n\nPremiers, we! should have no ideological hang-ups about\n\nthe way that. you get the greatest degree of\n\ncomplementarity and involvement of both sectors to make\n\nit more efficient. I don't think there's any\n\ndifferentiation on that point.\n\n16.\n\nJOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how much difficulty do you expect\n\nto encounter\n\nPM: Well it won't be without difficulty. Let's take the\n\ntwo sectors. Lot's take rail first. It is the case that\n\nalready in the States in varying degrees they have\n\nundertaken reform which has involved addressing the\n\nquestion of over-manning, other side of that reduction of\n\njobs and there have been varying degrees, as I say, of\n\ndifficulty there. What we say in regard to the National\n\nRail Freight scheme, it's going to involve in the phrase\n\nwe've used, a clean sheet industrial award. Now in the\n\nnegotiation of that there's going to be sone\n\ndifficulties. Let me say that in the work that's already\n\ngone in to the establishment of this National Rail\n\nFreight Corporation, we've had the involvement of the\n\nACTU, they've been involved in the preparatory work. So\n\nyes, there'll be problems but they are I am very\n\nconfident of the timetable we've set for the lint of July\n\n91, will be achieved and it will be, in my Judgement, a\n\nvery significant contribution to improving the economic\n\ninfrastructure of this country. Now, roads. well we're\n\ngoing to have some problems there. No, we shouldn't\n\nattempt to avoid this. The fact is that we've had an\n\nentirely stupid situation in this country and one which\n\nin the judgement of all of us is untenable if you were\n\nreally serious about micro-economic reform. The people\n\nand the elements of our economy who use our roads, the\n\nheavy users, have not been meeting in cost terms the\n\ndamage and the impact of their usage on the roads. In\n\nthat sense you've got to have a system of user\n\ncontribution which reflects much more than at present\n\nimpact of that usage upon the roads system. As part of\n\nthis conceptual approach also you'll see talk about the\n\nneed to have a national, and in a sense that Nick uses\n\nthat word, a national approach to regulation and so on.\n\nNow I only have to state those things for you to\n\nunderstand that anyone who under the present system is\n\ngetting a significant advantage from an under cost\n\nrecovery is not going to be standing out there and saying\n\nhooray for Bob and the Premiers. They are really going\n\nto attack this problem in a way which will mean a greater\n\nreturn. So there will be problems. But two things that\n\nhave to be understood about that, the one that I've\n\nalready said that it Just simply doesn't make sense in a\n\ncountry which depends so much upon the transport of goods\n\nby road. It doesn't make any sense to have a system for\n\nthose who are using that system and imposing the most\n\ndamage on it are not effectively contributing to the\n\nmaintenance of that system. And secondly, it makes no\n\nsense at all for Paul or myself, on behalf of the\n\nCommonwealth and our colleagues from the States, to be\n\nestablishing a National Rail Freight Corporation and\n\nwanting it to be commercial and competitive if the road\n\nsystem is not having to meet a level of charges\n\ncommensurate with the impact of its operation. I mean\n\nyou'd be pouring money down the drain in establishing a\n\nNational Road Freight Corporation if they weren't in a\n\n17.\n\nposition where they could be competitive. So in meeting\n\nthose challenges, yes there will be some problems. But\n\nI'm very confident that in this situation if we're going\n\nto have some angst and anger that all of us as\n\nGovernments are going to be able to say well we're in\n\nthis together.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, in the past\n\ndeclaration of war, isn't it?\n\nPM: No, certainly I'm not in the declaration of war.\n\nBut what we are jointly in the declaration of is this; a\n\ndeclaration of our commitment to have the most efficient\n\nand competitive economic infrastructure. That's what we\n\nare declaring. We're not declaring war, we're declaring\n\nour commitment to do everything we can as Government to\n\ncreate the most efficient economic infrastructure. That\n\nincludes most particularly in the transport area. Now\n\nif, in declaring our commitment to do that is going to\n\ninvolve some problems with some areas, well so be it. I\n\ndon't think together we're going to walk away from that.\n\nBut let me say this with respect to the transport\n\nindustry generally. We have there are indications of\n\ntheir understanding as an industry of the need to address\n\nthese issues. So I don't think it's just going to be a\n\nsort of black and white confrontation.\n\nJOURNALIST: going to mean increased costs for a lot\n\nof truck drivers and on the roads.\n\nPM: I don't know, I mean it will mean increased costs\n\nfor some. I mean you've got differentials amongst the\n\nStates now and in giving effect, as we have said\n\ntogether, to the principles that are involved in the\n\nInterstate Commission report, yes it will mean some\n\nincreased costs for some. None of us avoid that.\n\nAlthough you will appreciate that there is a recognition\n\nin the Communique that there will have to be some account\n\ntaken of certain regional differences. For instance, in\n\nrespect of Queensland and the Northern Territory, there\n\nhas been an acceptance of the particular circumstances of\n\nthe road trains that operate across there. We've got to\n\ntake those things into account. But what you've got to\n\nunderstand, it never, well as far as I know never, you\n\nnever have economic reform without some pain. I don't\n\nknow where you get it without some pain. The point is\n\nthat in the long term, or the medium to long term, the\n\nnation as a whole benefits from change.\n\nJOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on the question of costs of\n\ninfrastructure, what is your attitude now to\n\nprivatisation program the airlines\n\nPM: I've made it quite clear at all times that when\n\nyou're talking about using the proceeds you are talking\n\nabout the permanent on-going savings. Forget $ 2 billion,\n\n$ 3 billion or whatever you want to talk about from sales,\n\nit's not that figure. It is your permanent on-going nett\n\nI jl\n\n18.\n\nsavings. I have a view that it is appropriate to use\n\nthose things in this area, those elements. Let me make\n\nthis point; within the constraints of overall economic\n\npolicy which we refer to in the Commiunique just let me\n\ngo to the opening point that we make about\n\ninfrastructure. The very first point is leaders\n\nrecognise that Australia's economic difficulties require\n\ncontinuing restraint in public spending and borrowing and\n\nthat this will need to be taken into account ini\n\nconsidering capacity for new infrastructure spending.\n\nNow within that framework where we recognise that we just\n\ncan't, you know, spend money like that it may be that our\n\ndecision over a period of time will be that fixcing up and\n\nimproving the economic infrastructure may require over a\n\nperiod of time perhaps even more than that. But as far\n\nas what you will use from the sale of assets conceptually\n\nall that's involved is the nett permanent savings. I\n\nmade that clear at all times. But it may be, as part of\n\nlooking at infrastructure, we may decide as part of\n\noverall economic policy that improvement of\n\ninfrastructure requires could be more than that. But\n\nit will still have to be done within the constraints\n\nrecognised in the very first paragraph of the Communique.\n\nJOURNALIST: Hr Keating a matter of principle that\n\ngiving the States any access to an increased tax base..\n\nKEATING: Well I've answered that earlier. But the fact\n\nis now Commonwealth payments to the States has declined\n\nsignificantly as a proportion of the commonwealth budget.\n\nSo we're talking about a base which is in macro-economic\n\nterms quite acceptable. All the changes which have been\n\nmade at Premiers' Conferences are about the last couple\n\nof percentage points. It's not about the great bulk of\n\nthese funds. It's about the growth factors or lack of,\n\nor whether there's a cut in real terms. But we're\n\ntalking about a couple of percentage points. So, you\n\nknow, it may be possible to devise a system where those\n\nkinds of discretions are still open for public policy\n\nquestions. But where there is perhaps more control of\n\nrevenues by the States. Again, as the Prime Minister\n\nsaid, that's something we can look at. That's the point\n\nof the study.\n\nPM: There was one over here.\n\nJOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, about the four year term. What\n\n0 0\n\nPM: Well that goes back to the point I was Baying\n\nbefore. If there's one truth that's obvious in regard to\n\nconstitutional reform in this country it is that you will\n\nnot get change without agreement of the parties. I mean,\n\nas I use the classic example; if you can't get through a\n\nreferendum which sought to enshrine Into the Constitution\n\nthat any citizen who had his or her property compulsorily\n\nacquired by a government would have the right to fair\n\ncompensation from government. If you can't get that\n\n19.\n\nthrough, and we couldn't get that at the last ref erendum*,\n\nyou're battling to get anything through. So if you've\n\ngot any brains you come to the conclusion that you must\n\nhave cross-party agreement and involvement of States.\n\nNow, therefore, that means in regard to your question we\n\nare going to have to work out some basis of agreement\n\nbetween ourselves and the other parties on that aspect of\n\nthe question. So I recognise that it's been a problem in\n\nthe past. We're Just going to have to sort that one out.\n\nJOURNALIST: do you mean a fixed four year term or a\n\nmaximum four year term?\n\nPH: Well speaking from my, what happens in some of the\n\nStates is that they have four year terms and then there's\n\na minimum of three years, I think, with tour which you\n\nhave any discretion. I mean, that's not true in all of\n\nthem. But speaking for myself if you're going to have\n\nfour year teirms well then I think it should be a real\n\nfour years. with a minimum period within which there's a\n\ndiscretion. That's my own view but that's, I mean, it's\n\nsomething I've got to discuss with my colleagues.\n\nJOURNALIST: Mr Greiner, what's your view on Senate\n\nterms? GREINER: My view on Senate terms.\n\nJOURNALIST: On Senate terms.\n\nGREINER: Tom's question? I'd have a strong view\n\nabout. I mean the options are fairly limited aren't\n\nthey. They're either out of whack and they're six years\n\nor they're eight years which is the obvious double of one\n\nLower House ' term. I don't have a strong view. For what\n\nit's worth I obviously support four year terms for the\n\nLower House of the Federal Parliament. Anyone of any\n\nbrains does.\n\nJOURNALIST: Mr Greiner, what about four year terms for\n\nthe Senate as well as the House of Representatives?\n\nGREINERt No. I mean, that was rejected as I recall last\n\ntime and I think that is, there's nowhere in the world\n\nwhere that operates, Amanda, and I think it is unlikely\n\nto be the outcome of the process the Prime Minister\n\ndescribes. But it's not really a problem that I'm losing\n\ntoo much Bleep over.\n\nJOURNALIST: This option that you just outlined in your\n\npersonal view, Mr Hawke, the fixed minimum period. Is\n\nthis the one that you'll be pushing in talks both within\n\nthe Government and with Dr Hewson?\n\nPM; Look, I'm simply going to, when I discuss this, when\n\nwe get to the point of discussing this with my colleague\n\nwhich will be, can't be too far in the distance, as we\n\nare getting up to that April meeting. I really want to\n\nlisten to what they've got to Bay. I'm simply at this\n\nstage expressing no more than a personal view that it is,\n\nthat what people want is to have a situation where\n\nthey've got a Government which is going to be in there\n\nfor a longer period and the concept of four years seems\n\nto be about right. I mean, for instance, some people\n\ntalk about five. You've got five years in the United\n\nKingdom. I happen to think five years is too long. I\n\nthink four years is right. Now if you think four years\n\nis right then the logic of that to me suggests that it\n\nshould be done in a way which guarantees as far as\n\npossible is that it is going to be as close to four years\n\nas you can. But, you know, I want to hear what my\n\ncolleagues have to say about it. That's the view I'll be\n\nexpressing when the debate takes place.\n\nJOURNALIST: Hr Greiner, how closely will you link\n\nprogress on financial relationships with across the board\n\nprogress. In other words, if you don't get what the\n\nState regards as satisfactory outcome in about 12 months\n\ntime on the financial relationship is there a danger that\n\nthe federal political will be forgotten?\n\nGREINER: I would hope not. I mean, I think we should be\n\nprogressing on all these fronts and there are very many\n\nof them at the same time and as diligently as we can. I\n\ndon't see it as a trade-off, you know, that we'll give on\n\nnational recognition, mutual recognition of various\n\nthings in return for a change in the tax base. I think\n\nthat's back to the traditional mindset. No, I mean, I\n\nthink each of these things in and of themselves has got\n\nmerit and I don't think we're really about trying to\n\ntrade-off micro-economic reform against Federal/ State\n\nfinancial reform. That would be cutting of your nose to\n\nspite your face.\n\nJOURNALIST: Mr Keating, on the question of obtaining\n\nmacro-economic\n\nKEATING: What's that. Keep control of\n\nJOURNALIST: find the macro-economic control\n\nKEATING: That's not been the issue. The balanced budget\n\nhas not been the issue. It's about levels. You can have\n\nreceipts and outlays at this level or at that level.\n\nThey're both balanced but what level would you like?\n\nJOURNALIST: KEATING: Well that's what the communique said.\n\nPM: That's what the Communique said.\n\nJOURNALIST: Mr Keating, after the Premiers' Conference\n\nof Mr Bannon. That told us that there's a very\n\nclever and sophisticated process going on with those\n\nbureaucrats. I mean, what has happened since?\n\nKEATING: Well it's an efficient process. An efficient\n\nprocess. It may not be the most agreeable process but,\n\nin fact, I was saying to Premier Kirner earlier there's\n\none place not to be in this system is between a Premier\n\nand a bucket of money.\n\nKIRNER: That's why I'm sitting next to him.\n\nKEATING: Is that you can be in grave bodily danger. No\n\nI've often found myself in this position with Premier\n\nBannon. Given the fact he's more athletic than me means\n\nthat I've often been at risk. Personal risk. But\n\nbecause we always get along so well, all of us, we mostly\n\nget it togethter. The point I made after the last\n\nPremiers' Conference was that, I don't think we ought to\n\nbe too of this process. There's been a requirement\n\nin this country to cut back the call by the public sector\n\non Australian savings. That's now backed by seven to\n\neight percentage points of gross domestic product. Now\n\ntoday that's worth $ 30 billion and nobody in this room\n\nhas to be an economic genius to know what sort of\n\ninterest rat-ss Australia would have if the Commonwealth\n\nand the Stats were putting $ 30 billion worth of paper\n\ninto the market to be sold this year. Now there's\n\nobviously been some knashing of teeth in getting that\n\nchanged. But that change has been required by the fact\n\nthat the world decided not to pay us the income we\n\nbelieve was always ours. I don't, at the last meeting, I\n\nmade this point yesterday. We overturned 40 years of\n\ndebt management practice by returning to the States the\n\ndebt, the management of their own debt. Debt raised for\n\nthem under the financial agreement by the Commonwealth.\n\nNow if that was done in a ministerial meeting we'd be\n\ndoing it over a period of years. We did it-in one day.\n\nSo the meetings have been efficient. Most premiers'\n\nconference meetings have been efficient, as indeed\n\nyesterday's was in the very large agenda.\n\nJOURNALIST: But aren't always going to occur when\n\nmoney is at stake. In other words, the harmony we've\n\nseen here is not necessarily going to be repeated in\n\nfuture years when you are carving up the money.\n\nKEATING: No but it'. a matter of what the ambience is.\n\nWhat the ambience is about. What I would contend that\n\nthe ambience at this meeting and indeed the last four or\n\nfive premiers' conference meetings has been an acceptance\n\nby the States of the need for the public sector to reduce\n\nits call on savings. Now there may be arguments about\n\nwhat the levels are and who gets special additions and\n\nwhether Grants Commission formulas are accepted or not.\n\nThere's been generally a cooperative ambience in\n\nJOURNALIST: But John Bannon just said the ambience was\n\nKEATINGs No but I credit John with being a contributor\n\nto this cooperation in years past.\n\n21.\n\n22.\n\nBANNON: Yes i. t's true to say there's a level Of\n\ncooperation but I must say also that I think we should be\n\nvery careful of any definition of efficiency that means\n\none party to a gets everything their own way.\n\nUnfortunately the premiers' conference efficiency was\n\ntrembling in that direction. I think it needed to change\n\nand indeed it is changing.\n\nJOURNALIST: But surely this is the real point because\n\nisn't there ultimately conflict because the states are\n\nsaying we are now prepared to take more economic\n\nresponsibility. We're now more economically efficient\n\nunits. If that's to be realised then the States must\n\nhave more power which is what they're seeking here\n\nparticularly finance and tax powers. But surely\n\nultimately that does cut across the overall macro\n\nmanagement of the Commonwealth.\n\nPM: Read the Communique. I mean, what the Communique\n\nsays reflects the nature of the discussion that we had\n\nboth before we got to the Conference and in the\n\nConference itself. What we have said, and indeed, read\n\nthe States' paper. The States' paper prepared for this\n\nConference. In their paper they recognise unequivocally\n\nthe responsibility that the Commonwealth has for\n\nmacro-economic management. We didn't impose that view\n\nupon them. That's their view. Now they are saying that\n\nthey hope that accepting that view there will be room to\n\nreduce the imbalance that exists. it is the case that it\n\nis, on the evidence seems to be, a somewhat larger\n\nimbalance than in other federations. They say wall\n\naccepting that you've got to have that responsibility we\n\nwant to have a process of examining whether it can be\n\nreduced. We've said we'll go into that with the aim of\n\nreducing it provided that there is an acceptance of the\n\nneed to have an outcome in the end which gives us the\n\nassurance that we can discharge our responsibility. Now\n\nthere's no problem about that. We've accepted that. The\n\nStates have accepted it. I go back to the answer I gave\n\nbefore. These are by definition exceedingly complex\n\nissues. The States accept that they are complex but\n\nwe've gone into it with good intent. A declaration of\n\nour intent to work towards that and achieve it if we can.\n\nThere is nothing, I mean, you've got to say both from our\n\npoint of view and from theirs, there is nothing magical\n\nabout a precise imbalance that exists now. It isn't\n\nbecause it exists now necessarily perfect and the only\n\none. JOURNALIST: inaudible\n\nPM: No. In all the discussion that we've had there's\n\nbeen no suggestion that there be an absolute balance. No\n\nsuggestion at all\n\nJOURNALIST: with the responsibilities.\n\n23.\n\nPM: That doesn't mean exact balance. Because as I said\n\nbefore by definition you can't have fiscal equalisation\n\nif you've got an absence of imbalance. I mean that is\n\nJust a question of arithmetical logic which is understood\n\nand accepted by\n\nJOURNALIST: true but it's not exactly what he said.\n\nPM: Not exactly what who said.\n\nJOURNALIST: What the States' Paper said.\n\nPH: All I'm saying is that in the discussion with the\n\nStates, Michelle, there was never any proposition that\n\nyou have absolute balance.\n\nJOURNALIST: One other question on that. There's one\n\narea that's been fenced of f from micro-economic reform\n\nhere and that is there are questions of fiscal\n\nequalisation. Now every Premier and Prime Minister\n\nat this table is in the process of cutting services to\n\ncountry areas on the grounds that maintain that level\n\nof service into those places yet every family in Victoria\n\nand New South, Wales has been taxed $ 100 a year to keep\n\npeople who live in the Northern Territory and Tasmania\n\nand so on. Is it time that we re-evaluate this\n\nGREINER: I can see you're trying to divisions\n\namongst the group there. It is perfectly true, of\n\ncourse, with Victoria and New South Wales hold the view,\n\nregardless of which side of politics is in, that the\n\nexisting fiscal equalisation arrangements reflect a\n\nsituation that no longer applies. That doesn't mean\n\nthat, sorry we totally accept the notion of fiscal\n\nequalisation. I think that I would have the view, and I\n\nsuspect Joan Kirner would, that the detail of the way\n\nthat is implemented needs to be under continuing review\n\nand that includes the Grants Commission as well. So I\n\ndon't think you would expect that process to be frozen in\n\ntime. I don't think it's so much a matter of it being\n\nfenced of f. We certainly all accept and certainly I\n\naccept on behalf of New South Wales, which is the most\n\ndisadvantaged with Victoria, that there needs to be\n\nfiscal equalisation. It is part of the basic compact Of\n\nthe ground rules. The question of exactly how that\n\napplies between all the States as their respective\n\neconomic positions change is obviously something we think\n\nought to be reconsidered.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister before you go could I ask\n\nyour comment on the latest Morgan Gallup poll figures.\n\nIt shows that for the first time in seven years..\n\nPM: It's taken seven years. Now it's happened I really\n\nhave nothing to add to what I said yesterday. That is I\n\nwouldn't like to go to a poll now, frankly. But I\n\nGREINER: I would.\n\n24.\n\nPM: Yes. Well you, that's within your power to make a\n\ndecision. KEATING: We've just won one. We're not going to throw\n\nit away.\n\nPM! The point is that we've just won one. We've got\n\nover two years. I am supremely confident that if I and\n\nPaul and my colleagues go about the business of\n\ngovernment, as we are in this exercise and other things\n\nwe are doing, that when the time comes that we will get\n\nthe support. I'm not surprised that we're down in the\n\nPolls at the moment because as I've said we know that\n\npeople are hurting but we've had to do the things that\n\nwe've done. There are a range of other circumstances\n\nwhich are involved. I find, let me say, I find this\n\nperiod a very exciting and challenging one. One that I'm\n\nlooking forward to.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister could I just ask you on the\n\nGulf. Does your intelligence lead you to any greater\n\nassessment of the war?\n\nPM1: No. You'll appreciate that I'm not in a position\n\nwhere I can go to all the intelligence and confidential\n\ninformation I have. But I think the honest answer is\n\nthis that there is no-one who at this point can say with\n\ncertainty what the likely path of events is. But I can\n\nsay from my knowledge of United States and other powers\n\nthat are involved in the region in attempting to enforce\n\nthe sanctions and to redress the situation that exists\n\nthat there is no-one who wants war. I mean, we're not\n\nbeing led by some compulsive desire to have a war* We\n\nwould much rather have a situation where Saddam Hussein\n\nwas to respond to the realities and those realities are\n\nthat the world will not accept the attempt at acquisition\n\nof Kuwait by Iraq. There is all the evidence continuing\n\nto come through of solidarity, of the rest of the world,\n\nreflected in the continuing application of sanctions, the\n\ncontinuing votes of the Security Council of the United\n\nNations. So it's my hope that Saddam Hussein will\n\nrecognise those facts and that there will not be war.\n\nBut I can't on the basis of all the evidence I've got not\n\nnow, say I know with certainty what the course of events\n\nwill be. I don't think there's anyone, anyone, who can\n\ngive you that answer with precision and with\n\ndefiniteness. So I don't pretend to make an answer which\n\nI don't believe, on the facts, I'm entitled to.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the Melbourne Herald-sun has\n\n.* to guarantee its freedom of speech. in two weeks\n\nhas been pulled by unions..\n\nPM: Well, you know, when you look over the history of\n\nthe Melbourne Herald and its attitude to my Government.\n\nNo newspaper in the country dedicated itself more to the\n\ndestruction of this Government on a fundamental issue of"
