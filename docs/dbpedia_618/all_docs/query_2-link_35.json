I have been honoured to represent Australia as Consul-General in a wonderful country that is a longstanding friend and partner to Australia. Carolyn and I have greatly enjoyed our time in New York and hope to have contributed to strengthening Australia’s relationships in the United States. My time as Consul-General has given me the opportunity to meet many talented and fascinating people and I hope to see many of you before I leave at the end of February 2023."
