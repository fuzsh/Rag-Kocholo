        "text": "It is unlikely the Liberal Party will reach its target of 50 per cent elected female MPs by 2025, federal president Nick Greiner says.\n\nMr Greiner told the ABC's National Wrap program: \"It's a continuing struggle to get the party up to what I think is a representative appearance and reality in terms of female representation.\n\n\"It's tough from where we are now, given the realities of the timetable. The important thing is to maintain the pressure, to maintain the direction and to try and win the argument within the party about the importance.\n\n\"It's a continuing process and we will get there, whether we get there precisely by that target in seven years' time, we'll have to wait and see.\"\n\nIn a 15-year low, just 18 of the 84 Liberal MPs and senators in Parliament are women.\n\nThe Coalition's \"woman problem\" resurfaced last week, after the dumping of Jane Prentice, LNP member for the federal seat of Ryan and Assistant Minister for Disability Services.\n\nMr Greiner believed Ms Prentice's defeat was \"about the numbers\".\n\n\"It's about politics, it's not about gender,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's a bit easy to conflate everything in these sorts of situations, the nature of political parties and political process is that you do have competition and the Liberal Party certainly believes, as does the National Party, in a competitive process and the right of individual members to put their names forward.\"\n\nBrisbane City councillor Julian Simmonds was selected as the LNP's party candidate in the seat's preselection ballot.\n\nLiberal Party Women's Committee chairwoman Helen Kroger warned the Coalition, \"can't have blokes contesting incumbent women within the party\".\n\nMs Kroger told the RN Drive the party, \"cannot go backwards\" in terms of female representation.\n\nMr Greiner echoed the former senator's remarks, admitting the presence of women on the party ticket, \"is in the interests of its competitive position\".\n\nAlthough Mr Greiner is determined to boost the presence of female representation, he rejected gender quotas as the solution.\n\n\"We don't believe in quotas, we don't think that women ought to be there on some sort of mathematical formula,\" he said.\n\n\"The Liberal Party's got a clear, and I think philosophically coherent position about that.\n\n\"We think they should be the best candidates for whatever positions are up.\"\n\nThe former NSW premier also stressed diversity in Canberra goes beyond gender representation.\n\n\"Both major parties are underrepresented in terms of the ethnic backgrounds of their elected representatives,\" Mr Greiner said.\n\nAustralia and China need 'sustainable long-term relationship'\n\nMr Greiner appeared on National Wrap just hours after returning from Beijing.\n\nHis personal trip coincided with Trade and Tourism Minister Steve Ciobo's visit to China, which ended an unofficial eight-month freeze on Australian government representatives being invited to the country.\n\n\"Australia and China need to develop a sustainable long-term relationship,\" Mr Greiner said.\n\n\"There will be from time to time, as there has been this year, issues where the Australian Government is standing up for what it perceives as the national interest.\"\n\nBilateral relations appeared to sour following the Government's announcement of new foreign interference laws and commentary on the South China Sea.\n\n\"There is more tension now than there was a year or two ago in the Australia-China relationship and I'm sure that there'll be ups and downs.\""
