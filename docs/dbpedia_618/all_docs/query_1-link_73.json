        "text": "Two years after taking the stand at an Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) inquiry, former NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian has been found to have engaged in serious corrupt conduct.\n\nMs Berejiklian is the ICAC's latest high-profile political casualty, but she's not the first.\n\nThe former premier joins a long list of powerful political careers derailed after being investigated by the nation's longest-running corruption watchdog.\n\nThe NSW Premier, Chris Minns, says he doesn't believe members of parliament should automatically resign or be suspended amid an ICAC inquiry.\n\nHere are a few big names who have been investigated, with different results.\n\nThe first big political scalp\n\nIn 1992, Liberal leader Nick Greiner became the first premier to be brought down by the ICAC, just three years after he'd fought for its establishment in 1989.\n\nHe claimed the \"jobs for the boys\" scandal which was his undoing, was \"politics\", not corruption.\n\nThe ICAC disagreed, it found him \"technically corrupt\" for misusing his position as Liberal Party leader to secure independent MP Terry Metherell's resignation from state parliament, to achieve a political advantage.\n\nMr Greiner was later cleared of wrongdoing by the Court of Criminal Appeal.\n\nThe bottle of Grange\n\nIn April 2014, then Liberal premier Barry O'Farrell fell on his sword over what he described as a \"massive memory fail\" in the ICAC witness box.\n\nWhile under oath, he denied being given a bottle of 1959 Grange Hermitage by Australian Water Holdings executive Nick Di Girolamo as a gift, in the wake of his 2011 election victory.\n\nMr O'Farrell resigned in spectacular fashion the following day, after learning a thank you note he'd written about the wine would be tendered to ICAC as evidence.\n\nThe former premier said at the time he still didn't recall the gift, but \"as someone who believes in accountability … I accept the consequences of my actions\".\n\nHe maintained the gift had not swayed his treatment of a public private partnership sought by Australian Water Holdings, which was at the centre of the ICAC's investigation.\n\nICAC later cleared him of any wrongdoing and found \"there was no intention on Mr O'Farrell's part to mislead\".\n\nEddie Obeid and Ian MacDonald\n\nBetween 2012 and 2014, disgraced former Labor powerbroker Eddie Obeid became a frequent face in the ICAC witness box, his conduct coming under the microscope in multiple separate corruption inquiries.\n\nIn 2013, the ICAC found he and former resources minister Ian Macdonald had engaged in corrupt conduct when they'd conspired to rig the tender process for a mining exploration licence over Obeid's family farm in the Bylong Valley, netting them a $30 million windfall.\n\nBoth have served jail time for criminal convictions following ICAC investigations."
