        "text": "It’s not every day you get the chance to rub shoulders with dignitaries at the Australian Consulate-General in New York.\n\nBut—that’s exactly what close to three dozen Aussie women had the chance to do last month when they had morning tea with the Australian Consul-General Nick Greiner and his partner, AWNY patron, Carolyn Fletcher.\n\nThe room was adorned with spring flowers, yummy morning tea, and Australian art—which proved quite a talking point.\n\nThe crowd enjoyed hearing from AWNY Patron Carolyn Fletcher on the day, and sharing stories about life as an Aussie woman in the city that never sleeps.\n\nOn behalf of AWNY and the women who attended, we thank Nick and Carolyn for hosting us and look forward to continuing to work with Carolyn in her role of patron of AWNY.\n\nSave the Date for AWNY’s Emotional Transitions Event\n\nDo you feel the struggles and isolation of relocating to NYC?
