        "text": "Former NSW Premier Nick Greiner has joined the Board of the Refugee Council of Australia.\n\nMr Greiner, who migrated from post-war Hungary as a young child, says it’s time for Australia to move on and resolve some of the long running-issues in refugee policy.\n\n“These issues should not be reduced just to matters for political debate but we should recognise that there is a duty for us all to consider the humanity of refugees and people seeking asylum,” he said in a statement.\n\n“I look forward to bringing forth my passion for social justice and humanitarian efforts to the work of the Refugee Council of Australia.”\n\nMr Greiner served as Premier and Treasurer of NSW between 1988-92. He was elected Federal President of the Liberal Party between 2017-20 and served as Australian Consul General in New York from 2021-23, as well as holding numerous senior corporate roles.\n\nRCOA President Jasmina Bajraktarevic-Hayward said Mr Greiner has supported the not-for-profit NGO in an advisory capacity in the past.\n\n“We are delighted that he has agreed to deepen his engagement by joining the RCOA Board,” Ms Bajraktarevic-Hayward said.\n\nThe RCOA is a national refugee umbrella body, which states as its mission the promotion of humane, lawful and constructive policies around refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nComment below to have your say on this story.\n\nIf you have a news story or tip-off, get in touch at editorial@governmentnews.com.au."
