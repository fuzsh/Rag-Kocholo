        "text": "The Australian directors’ club is way too tight so Crikey is going to\n\nstart tracking who has held the most number of board seats. First out\n\nof the blocks is Nick Greiner and we doubt we’ll find anyone busier\n\nthan him.\n\nFormer NSW Premier Nick Greiner is an obvious starting point\n\ngiven he is chairing the $300 million-plus Bradken steel float which\n\nwas launched on April 27. Since resigning from the NSW Parliament in\n\n1992, these are all the directorships that we know Greiner has held and\n\nif anyone can beat this please email boss @crikey.com.au.\n\nChairman dstore\n\nChairman Bradken\n\nChairman British American Tobacco Australasia\n\nChairman Baulderstone Hornibrook Australia\n\nChairman Iama\n\nChairman United Utilities Australia\n\nChairman CRC for Biopharmaceutical Research Pty Ltd\n\nChairman Australian Subscription TV and Radio Association (ASTRA)\n\nChairman Nuance Global Traders\n\nChairman BMC Media\n\nChairman of wool company AWG\n\nDeputy chairman Stockland Trust Property Group\n\nDeputy chairman Coles Myer\n\nDeputy chairman Castle Harlan Australia\n\nDirector QBE\n\nDirector Australian Stationery Industries\n\nDirector South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club\n\nDirector SOCOG\n\nDirector Brian McGuigan Wines\n\nDirector Supertex Industries\n\nConsultant to Phillips\n\nConsultant to PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\nConsultant to Deloittes Touche Tohmatsu\n\nConsultant to Clayton Utz\n\nConsultant to Turnbull Porter Novelli\n\nConsultant to Salomon Smith Barney\n\nCRIKEY: That is an impressive tally of 11 chairs, three deputy\n\nchairs, five directorships and six consultancies. Is it any wonder that\n\nGreiner is said to be one of the richest retired politicians in\n\nAustralia?\n\nNaturally, he pulls that taxpayer funded pension\n\nin whilst getting paid for all these gigs. It would be interesting to\n\nchart the matrix between the Greiner consultancies and work given to\n\nthe firms he chaired over the years. This sort of thing is distinctly\n\npasse in 2004 as directors strive to be completely independent.\n\nHowever,\n\nthis hasn’t stopped Greiner keeping his snout in the consultancy trough\n\nas the 2004 Who’s Who reveals that the Deloitte and Citigroup (owner of\n\nSalomons) gigs are ongoing.\n\nThe amazing Dick Warburton workload\n\nCrikey is sitting on a panel with Dick Warburton at the\n\nAustralian Institute of Company Directors annual conference in Port\n\nDouglas next week so we may as well lay out his huge portfolio of\n\ndirectorships over the years.\n\nManaging Director Du Pont Australia\n\nChairman Caltex\n\nChairman Star City Casino\n\nChairman David Jones\n\nChairman Goldfields Kalgoorlie\n\nChairman Gibson Chemicals\n\nChairman Board of Taxation\n\nChairman AurionGold\n\nChairman NSW Olympic Business Roundtable\n\nChairman AusIndustry\n\nChairman Wool International\n\nChairman Worksafe Australia\n\nChairman HIH Claims Support Company\n\nPresident Plastics and Chemicals Industry Association\n\nPresident Australian Institute of Company Directors\n\nPresident American Chamber of Commerce\n\nDirector Tabcorp\n\nDirector Southcorp\n\nDirector Nufarm\n\nDirector Fernz Corp\n\nDirector Heart Research Institute\n\nDirector Reserve Bank\n\nDirector Note Printing Australia\n\nDirector Allen Allen &amp; Hemsley\n\nDirector Microsearch Foundation\n\nDirector O’Connell Street Associates"
