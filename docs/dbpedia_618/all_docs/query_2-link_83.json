        "text": "New Liberal Party president Nick Greiner has rejected former prime minister Tony Abbott's plan for winning the next election saying it is \"never going to happen\".\n\nMr Abbott has laid out a five-point plan which he argues the Coalition has to implement to win the next federal election.\n\nThe speeches he has given while campaigning on the plan this year have been seen as a critique of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his policies.\n\nMr Greiner has dismissed Mr Abbott's ideas.\n\n\"I frankly think if you look at Tony's five-point plan, most of that's never going to happen,\" he told Radio National.\n\n\"No-one is going to reform the constitution with respect to the Senate, whether that is desirable or not,\" he said referring to Mr Abbott's idea of overcoming deadlocks between the two houses of Parliament.\n\n\"So if you are in government putting that sort of stuff up it is politics rather than government.\"\n\nHe said the way Mr Abbott has been speaking out is not helping the Coalition's standing.\n\n\"I think Tony, plus a range of the media, have certainly contributed. Everyone knows in Australian politics that disunity is essentially political death … of course that has contributed to the polls I think it would be idle to pretend otherwise,\" Mr Greiner said.\n\nBut the former NSW premier said Mr Abbott's disappointment at losing the Liberal Party leadership was understandable.\n\n\"Of course there are some legacy feelings from Tony's loss of the prime ministership 18 months ago — it would be strange and almost counter to human nature if there wasn't a significant element of that,\" he said.\n\nAs well as a referendum to change the Senate rules, Mr Abbott's five-point plan includes cutting immigration and the renewable energy target and government spending.\n\nBut Mr Greiner's focus as incoming president is to tackle the party's membership.\n\n\"Party membership is meagre on both sides and not representative of the broader community,\" he said.\n\nHe said the Liberal Party needed to improve the way it selects candidates to boost the number of women.\n\n\"I think the Liberal Party has a problem with women and clearly have not done as well as our political opponents in terms of gender diversity but indeed diversity generally,\" he said.\n\n\"I think the argument about how do you select candidates is really part of a broader need how to make the party reflective of the community.\""
