        "text": "The annual pink test at the SCG may be adorned in pink but breast cancer is decidedly gender neutral. Just ask Nick Greiner.\n\nThe former NSW premier was diagnosed with breast cancer after finding a pin prick of blood on his shirt and, after it reappeared and a cream was prescribed, a subsequent mammogram and ultrasound on an emerging lump behind his nipple six months later.\n\nWhile Greiner is one of the lucky ones – although he had his left breast removed he didn’t require chemotherapy or radiotherapy - male breast cancer is rarely diagnosed early and spreads to other parts of the body at higher rates than women.\n\nGALLERY: Where cancer is hiding on your body\n\nMale breast cancer is rare with around 150 cases in Australia each year, compared to 15,270 new diagnoses in women.\n\nHowever, in men around 60 per cent of male breast cancer has spread beyond the breast compared to 45 per cent in women.\n\nAccording to Cancer Australia, the types of breast cancer found in men are similar to those found in women with the most common form - invasive ductal carcinoma showing up as a lump.\n\n“I have seen many patients who have seen their doctor with a lump or discharge from their nipple, to be told it was a fatty lump or “man boobs” or enlarged tender breasts due to a hormone imbalance or medications,” says oncologist Professor John Boyages.\n\nMORE: How Wallaby great tackled the loss of his father to cancer"
