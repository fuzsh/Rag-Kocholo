        "text": "Trump stood for something\n\nI have read Michael Hicks column about the positives and negatives of President Trump’s 4 years in office. I want to say that President Trump loved this country and its citizens.\n\nHe was not racist because he was building a wall; he was intelligent enough to realize we have to protect our borders and take care of our citizens at home before we can take on more immigrants. Our veterans deserve the best health care available and to receive decent housing and food. We already have hungry, homeless families here at home that deserve to be assisted before illegal immigrants! Do we want another 9/11?\n\nMr. Biden’s first day in office, he put many thousands of people out of work! And the election was fraudulent, I’m sure they did not hire people off the streets to testify the fraud that went on! Doesn’t it make you wonder why Nancy Pelosi is so deathly afraid of Donald Trump she will do anything to get him out of office? They have her lap top!\n\nHave you not already seen they are censoring our speech, they want to take our guns, etc.? The socialism is already starting! At least President Trump stood for something, and stood on his own feet, not on the take by China. Believe what you wish, but when you are standing in bread lines and going hungry, and have no means of protecting yourselves against government, remember who you voted for!\n\nLisa C. Thornbro\n\nDaleville\n\nAdvice for drivers on snowy days\n\nSlow down. Start a bit earlier for work, give yourself distance, and PLEASE respect the city and county's efforts to clear the roads. Too many times I have heard from snow plow drivers that a vehicle would pass the final truck to where they were behind the second or first truck.\n\nHey, this is Indiana and you cannot prepare enough when you are in these positions. Take it slow and allow the plow drivers and the departments to do the best they possibly can. These days materials are very expensive and decisions have to be made according to department managing. Most times it costs more for materials than it does manpower.\n\nBut in my opinion I would just like our citizens to realize it is dangerous out there if you don't recognize the situation and take your time. Give our street crews some credit, and more so give them room to work.\n\nDuke Campbell\n\nMuncie\n\nDon't make the same mistake I made\n\nFrom 2000-2004 I made a donation to the Indiana State Police via a fundraising center phone solicitor. For my donation I was repaid by having my phone number distributed or possibly sold to several fundraising companies. Since then I get a call from an ISP solicitor every week wanting money. I asked nicely on four occasions to remove me from the call list. Then several times, not so nicely. I am on the Do Not Call List but that's a waste of time.\n\nI wrote the attorney general and my lawmakers trying to stop the harassment and never heard back from them. I work two jobs and am required to answer my phone. I get calls from firefighters, veterans and several others weekly.\n\nMy advice; under no circumstances should anyone donate to a phone solicitor. I fully support the men and women of law enforcement as well as the other groups that beg me for money every week. But my reward is continuing harassment during business hours when I am trying to make a living. Now the insurance industry is sending me voicemail and robocalls. This is a disgusting way to do business. If you are too lazy to speak to me directly, I am certainly not buying your insurance. Shame on all of you who use this practice.\n\nJeffrey Ginn\n\nDaleville\n\nThanks to Maplewood Animal Hospital\n\nI wanted to thank and acknowledge the phenomenal veterinarian care from Dr. Fipp and his staff at Maplewood Animal Hospital. Our cat was attacked by a neighborhood dog and we called and went to a couple of different vets close by to get him seen. We were turned down by three different places even after bringing the cat to one of the vets that we normally go to. A vet tech told us he would need to be seen in Fishers or Anderson and that he was not in good shape.\n\nKnowing he was in pain and not wanting to take a chance of driving that far, we finally called Maplewood. They got us in immediately. While our cat did have to be euthanized, the staff and Dr. Fipp got him in right away and notified us of his condition and treatment options. They were very caring and their priority was our cat. Although the outcome was sad we left knowing that he was truly cared for by veterinarian staff in his last minutes of life. Two days later we received a card with our cat's paw print which meant a lot to our kids.\n\nFrom now on we will be taking our other pets to Maplewood Animal Hospital.\n\nIt’s truly sad that we were turned down by the very place we have spent a lot of money for our pets' wellness over the years, just because they didn't want to deal with it. This showed us how completely heartless some veterinarians can be.\n\nLeah Alexander and Nick Greiner\n\nMuncie\n\nA good neighbor for Huntsville Center\n\nThe Huntsville Community Center is important to my family; it offers an invaluable gathering place for area residents. When COVID-19 forced the community center to lose revenue, we were worried about potentially having to close our doors and how losing such a gathering place would impact our community. But thanks to the local presence of EDP Renewables North America (EDPR NA), things are looking up.\n\nEDPR NA is the owner and operator of the Riverstart Solar Park, currently under construction in Randolph County near the Huntsville Community Center. Because of that proximity, Ames Construction, the company working on Riverstart, supported the community center by renting office space. I am by no means exaggerating when I say that during COVID-19, that rental income helped save our community center.\n\nWhile this rental is not directly from EDPR NA, they helped make it happen. Their company has proven to be an excellent neighbor to Randolph County time and time again. From the beginning, EDPR NA has always come forward and supported their words with actions that if they can make an opportunity happen for our community, they will.\n\nDuring COVID-19, this support is needed more than ever. Our communities need corporate partners who are involved in and care about the long-term impact of their work for community members. EDPR NA is such a company. Whether it’s helping to save our community center, working with local organizations, or growing renewable energy in our area, EDPR NA is the type of partner Randolph County needs.\n\nGreg Beumer\n\nExecutive director of the Randolph County Economic Development Corporation\n\nHow to send a letter to the editor\n\nLetters to the Public Letter Box should be emailed to letters@muncie.gannett.com.
