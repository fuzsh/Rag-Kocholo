        "text": "My name is Dylan Greiner. In the summer and fall, I play attack for the Express North lacrosse club (Darien, CT). In the winter, I play box lacrosse on the Superstar Box Lacrosse High School Elite Club team (Ridgefield, CT) and the Superstar Nationals High School Elite Team (Ridgefield, CT). In the spring, I am an attackman for the St. Joseph High School Varsity lacrosse team (Trumbull, CT). I also lettered on Varsity in my Freshman year.\n\nIn addition to lacrosse, I wrestle in the winter. I'm also an avid double-black diamond and terrain park snowboarder, and my favorite place to ride is Snowbird, Utah. I also enjoy Olympic weightlifting in the off-season. My favorite hobby is chess.\n\nI'm taking Pre-Calculus, Physics, and Honors Spanish at St. Joseph High School.\n\nLacrosse continues to be an incredibly positive part of my life, and I love this sport. I am an extremely dedicated and tirelessly hardworking student-athlete looking to play at the highest possible level of college lacrosse."
