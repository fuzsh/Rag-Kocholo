He was born May 1, 1979 in Toledo, OH to Thomas Edward Greiner, JR and Judith Lynn Latham Kaufman.\n\nFollowing his graduation from North Central High School, Chris attended Kendall College School of Culinary Arts.\n\nChris was an amazing chef who worked at several high-end restaurants within Central Indiana and the Chicago area. He was skilled and creative and enjoyed creating new and unique dishes.\n\nAs an avid athlete in his youth, Chris played baseball, basketball, and soccer. He especially excelled at soccer and had a passion for the sport. Chris enjoyed drawing and working with his hands. He could often be found hiking, camping, and spending time in the outdoors with nature.\n\nChris was always learning and exploring. He loved animals, especially his dog, Smooth and puppy, Trooper, whom he loved dearly. Chris enjoyed sitting and talking with his family over a game of cards or next to a hot bonfire. Chris was happiest when he was spending time with family because they were so important to him. He had a special place in his heart for his niece, Charlotte and nephew, Cooper and attended all their activities.\n\nChris was preceded in death by his mother, Judith Lynn Kaufman.\n\nSurvivors include his father, Thomas Edward Greiner, Jr.; stepmom, Julia Greiner; siblings, Alison (David) Burnett, Lara (Jeremy) Streby, Matthew (Heidi) Greiner, Tyler Greiner; nephews, Cooper Burnett, Owen Streby; and nieces, Charlotte Burnett, Vivian Streby and Haliegh Greiner.\n\nA Time of Remembrance and Celebration of Life will be held later.\n\nBussell Family Funerals is privileged to assist the family with arrangements."
