        "text": "Just as Marc Antony came to bury Caesar not to praise him, this blog post on the occasion of John Fahey’s death will look at the rather odd period of government in the late 1980s and early 1990s in NSW.\n\nNSW has a pattern where Labor governments always reek of corruption and the raw exercise of power by the union-backed factions, and the succeeding Liberal governments have what looks like an easy job of just shoving that knife in – usually in the form of some sort of Royal Commission or similar. There may also be an attempt to undermine the unions by confecting some financial crisis (that may or may not have a link to real world economics) to justify cutbacks. Thus it was in the most recent change from Carr/Iemma/Rees/Kenneally to O’Farrell/Baird/Berejiklian. Some comparison with the ends of the Cain/Kirner and Bracks/Brumby Victorian governments is worth making, just click the links.\n\nAnd these Liberal governments lose power when their coalition conflicts (as bad as it ever gets at the writing of this post) and the public tiring of austerity, but also must wait for an acceptable Labor leadership team – which has not happened in 2020 and can’t yet be fathomed.\n\nAs it is now it was then.\n\nThe Previous Government\n\nThese state government posts can only start by immersing in the issues of the previous government. Neville Wran had delivered a competent though far from perfect rendition of managing the NSW railways. After a baptism of fire with the disaster at Granville (which highlighted not just the poor condition of the system, but also how large numbers of people were now commuting very long distances, but on old trains).\n\nLots of branchline services had ended and the headline day trains out of Sydney had been replaced with the ‘futuristic’ XPT though the implementation of this had been scattered and without any guiding direction. The system had endured many strikes as the freight rail network moved from a classic rail operation to a commoditised system of single traffic trains (coal, wheat and containers dominating) which did not require train guards, large numbers of sidings or signalling that entails. Meanwhile those other traffics that had sustained country rail transport like fertiliser, fodder, animals, general parcels and freight all but disappeared.\n\nProbably the two major legacies from the passenger point of view was the electrification of the mainlines to Newcastle and Port Kembla, joining the Lithgow route as long routes where the fleet of double deck interurban cars (later christened V sets) could stretch their legs – and allow the increasing numbers of commuters to stretch theirs. As freight projects they failed – they used the same low voltage DC and low kilowattage locomotives substantially unchanged since the original 1920s, while other systems pursued high voltage AC traction. But the passenger operation is what people remembered after the horrors of Granville.\n\nPhoto based on Tyson George photo\n\nThe other legacy was (very late in the piece) the rolling out of the original Tangara design for suburban passenger, though this roll-out itself became part of the final political turbulence.\n\nWran had left office at ‘just the right time’ – with the smell of corruption very ripe (notwithstanding being ‘cleared’ by inquiries) and no sign yet of financial trouble.\n\nThe uncharismatic Barrie Unsworth, the union heavy from central casting, took the captain’s chair just in time for the ship to founder on the rocks dead ahead. He had been Transport Minister, so initiatives like the Tangara were as much his touchstone as Wran’s.\n\nWith the government in trouble, it was time to open the chequebook, and start promising and spending. In some ways the possibility of spending their way out of trouble might have worked under more inspirational leadership. The change from the Phillip Shirley-PTC to the David Hill SRA had given them a good template for communicating with the public, and the new trains had engaged the public. Some of the promises were clearly silly, like running passenger trains from Campbelltown to Wollongong along the cursed Maldon-Dombarton line. But while the Premier lacked the gift of leadership, the railways themselves were clearly working for the government.\n\nThe final gasp of Unsworth was provided by the cover of the Australian and NSW Bicentennial celebrations – the excuse to cut every ribbon and flog every train old and new in front of TV cameras. Nobody minded if it might have been a tad unaffordable.\n\nUnlike the Cain/Kirner to Kennett transition in Victoria, the sense of financial panic had not yet set in. Global and local ‘bubbles’ had not yet burst and the public had otherwise been in a good mood.\n\nBut time is never on the side of a long term government. Going into the election of 1988, it was clear Labor was gone, and would be for a while.\n\nA Landslide\n\nNicholas Frank Greiner looked like the sort of managerialist right winger that would, in John Howard’s words, have ‘the times suit him’. He had been caricatured by his looks as Kermit the Frog, but ‘scrubbed up well’ compared with the cardigan-clad Unsworth. His team looked like the expected mix of urbane, well spoken city Liberals, allied with the rough ‘sucking on a wheat stalk’ National Party hicks led by Wal Murray. While in some ways, joined together they might have looked like an odd team, this is fairly normal in Australian politics for L-NP coalitions.\n\nHe did not hide from the public what would be two major policy thrusts in his term – to go after the Labor Party for suspected corruption (Wran had almost taunted the Liberals for his ‘getting away with it’ and they were livid about this) but also to tackle the size of the public sector, somewhat under the influence of the newly-minted ‘Think Tanks’ that were pushing what was then called ‘New Right’ ideology of small government and privatisation. The railways would be clearly in their sights.\n\nReaders, who may not have pondered this deeply, should be aware that while some of these ‘Liberals’ might genuinely believe in small government, most don’t, but do want to remove from government their political enemies in the Labor Movement, which is not just the elected politicians but also the unions, and the blocks of employees that support them in heavy industry, the public service, teaching and healthcare. Hence the need for a full-frontal assault on the public service, the public schools and government enterprises like the railways. Thus it was with Kennett in Victoria, but the 1990s cycle started with Greiner.\n\nIn addition to these major thrusts were the usual LNP tropes of ‘Law and Order’; a nod towards the anti-environmentalism and pro-gun politics of the National Party; though Greiner knew his base was in the city where the National policies were very unpopular and would not push too hard on these.\n\nCorruption would be tackled by instituting a British Hong Kong style Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), basically a permanent Royal Commission. It was assumed that a steady stream of scandals from the time of the previous government would emerge, that would keep Labor out of government for generations. Fate always has the last laugh – Greiner not knowing when he himself would be the first major scalp for ICAC!\n\nIn other portfolios it can be argued Greiner was using up the government’s political capital far too quickly. It looked like a single term government by the middle of the period without really any solid reason why. The government picked a fight with the teachers it might have won with a better plan and narrative, but in this blog’s opinion, seemed to be overtly ideological in tone but with little practical change behind it. The National Party shtick might have worked for their MPs but was alienating city voters.\n\nAnd this blog is never convinced by the politics of ‘Laura Norder’ – it makes a good line to use in opposition against the crimes of the day, but when in government they become your high crime rate, and unless you magically find a way of jailing or hanging all the criminals it is a hard cow to milk from government.\n\nIt would be going too far to suggest that policies towards rail were somehow determinate of the fortunes of the Greiner and Fahey governments, as plenty else was happening. But because this blog is about rail politics, it is time to get into it.\n\nMinister Bruce Baird\n\nHe was the father of later premier Mike Baird, and though the latter represented the Manly area, the father was synonymous with the Sutherland Shire, and held the state seat as well as the federal one before the current Prime Minister Scott Morrison did.\n\nHe started as the hard and sharp voice of the New Right within the Greiner Government, the father who says ‘no’ to his children. Though he did make some conciliatory noises to the portfolio, such as praising the Tangara program, he was committed to the Greiner roads policy, including the ‘3×3’ petrol tax which would pay for some long-standing commitments to extend freeways, as well as promoting the M4, M5 and M2 tollway projects that would later steal a lot of suburban rail passenger traffic.\n\nOddly, Baird later went on to be a moderate voice within the Liberal Party federally, though whether that represents his movement along the ideological spectrum, or the party’s shift rightward, could be debated.\n\nCancellation of the Maldon Dombarton link\n\nThe Wran post went into some detail on this folly.\n\nFolly it was to start it, but also folly to stop it too, as Greiner did as his first act. He had to pay off the tunnel contractors an amount that must have been a fair proportion of completing the job, and so the job could have been completed. Yes, coal prices and volumes were down from the business case assumptions, and that is why Wran should not have been so quick to push it. Yes, Unsworth’s plan was not a plan.\n\nBut by the time the tunnel would have been finished, the situation was likely to have changed, and an alternative to the Moss Vale route, prone to landslides and problems, would have been good. The line, its uncompleted bridges and cleared alignment sit there to this day.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (later Booz)\n\nIt must be good marketing for consultants to have their names attached to major reports, though the risks can be great. What if your name becomes the ‘whipping boy’ for every hatred or discontent about the recommendations you make (or even related policy areas you didn’t make recommendations on)? Sort of like Beeching, though he wasn’t a consultant, became for every downgrade of the UK rail system for 40 years after his famous report. The government hires you so that some of the blame can be shared, and plausible distance created to provide room for a government to back-pedal.\n\nBut the converse is also true – if you were hired by ideologues and Treasury bureaucrats to recommend cuts, does your reputation hang on how good a job of that you did?\n\nAnyway the firm of Booz was hired by the incoming government to make recommendations for the NSW rail system, recommendations that would look extremely draconian in terms of services being ended, lines closed and jobs lost. Even without the report it looked like the Northern line could not survive beyond Tamworth, and many of the usual suspects of the time such as the line south of Unanderra, the Murwillumbah line, what was left of the Mudgee or Cowra lines would all go.\n\nTony McLaughlin photo, the XPT shunting for the night at Armidale. This service was a joke.\n\nThere was however a glimmer of hope buried in the gloom. The same firm had reported on the NZ railways a few years earlier, and though losses there had been heavy, there was a commitment to modernise and improve – unlike NSW the major routes there were having their tracks replaced with concrete sleepers, and freight was being actively chased (and not commoditised freight as in NSW). The CEO of the NZ Railways would also become a key player in this.\n\nThe report went down like a tonne of bricks – predictably. The worst of it would affect country voters – an odd reward for voting National – though the National elements of the government, like the Liberal, would not hide their own preference for road transport. No doubt some personally were linked to road companies, though this rarely matters as the railways do enough themselves to explain their own malaise. Still, even a National who personally despises rail is not going to get far with his constituents, the grain farmers expecting local silos to deliver to cheaply, the old ladies who want the passenger train to get to the Sydney doctors, or just the local mayors who want to take pride in their town.\n\nThe report expectedly over-egged the issue, thereby giving the government room to retreat. But it wasn’t a wholesale slaughter as some expected. Amongst the closures and losses were some shoots of new growth, or at least some good ideas that did endure.\n\nCancellation of the DKM/DKT double deck interurban order\n\nIn a similar vein to the folly of the Maldon-Dombarton line. Unsworth had made this order a sitting target for Greiner. Though the contract was signed, Unsworth had insisted the trains be somehow decorated Tangara-style with some sort of chiselled-front, though imagery released to the public is scant. The Tangara itself was being built by Goninan, a different contractor from Comeng who had built these cars. And the front of the Tangara was integral to the design, not just a fibreglass ‘face’ stuck on the front like so many. The public would be able to see it was just dressing up an existing design in a silly way and at extra expense. And Greiner would make sure everybody knew about the waste of money.\n\nOf course, Greiner was able to use that to reduce the overall size of the order, a terrible thing for the Comeng Granville plant (their last order) but also for the Interurban zone (which Unsworth had foolishly named Intercity to the confusion of many) where demand for such cars was still strong and some loco-hauled trains, as well as the single deck (later U-sets) were still hanging around. Had the order been fulfilled and more still, all such cars could have found use. Only a small number of the DKM/DKT cars were delivered.\n\nThey went on to repurpose part of the later batch of Tangaras for ‘outer suburban’ use, named the G sets, with one toilet between four cars, and the limit of operations being Wyong to the north and Springwood to the West. So the demand was still being met, albeit with a vastly inferior car (from the passenger point of view).\n\nRoss Sayers\n\nAs Booz had reported on the NZ Railways and seemed the inspiration for the Greiner project, so hiring the same CEO to replace the union-friendly Pat Johnson made some sense. Perhaps both sides might hope he delivered what they wanted – a commercially-minded rather than community service-oriented railway; but one that had not just closed everything.\n\nThings were getting a bit difficult for our Kiwi ring-in. Politics here was much tougher than it had been under a Labour government, albeit very pro-market like the Lange Government. Sayers had to turn up at very rowdy events like the last Silver City Comet to Broken Hill. This train, though had once been a classic and worked by the original classic rolling stock, but the service had become so silly, with the potential for no service between Orange and Parkes, that the train might run but connect with a bus to Orange or even Lithgow. A token service that was becoming hard to justify with life-expired stock.\n\nHe also copped it in Parliament. The cuts were unpopular and Labor was able to make good political wind of them, despite the recent resounding defeat. The poor man was not in his Kiwi culture, and it hit him. On his way to an appearance in Parliament, he had a heart attack. He survived thankfully, but he was not a long term fixture in the railways after this point.\n\nThe Silver City Comet, credit Rolf Bezier\n\nPossibly this was a defining moment for the railways going forward, as this commercial state-owned enterprise, run on ‘community service obligation payments’ seemed to gradually disappear. Though that may have owed just as much to other changes, such as the fragmentation of the business through on-rail competition, privatisation of operators and so on.\n\nElectrification to Richmond and Dapto\n\nWhile people fully expected massive closures the Booz sentiment was that if you were going to keep these things, you might as well fix them up. The Richmond line, an isolated diesel shuttle at the end of an electrified suburban branchline, would be electrified rather than closed, as had been speculated. At first it was on the ultra cheap – only the 2-car double deck sets would be able to run so low would the power to the wire be. Still, better than closure. Later, in better financial times, the power was boosted and some extra trackage put in to make the service more frequent and able to cope with longer trains.\n\nDapto was on the line to Nowra, diesel-operated up to that point beyond the Port Kembla junction at Coniston. There had been some work done to extend the wires along the double track from Coniston to Unanderra, for the junction to the ill-fated Maldon-Dombarton line. It would not cost particularly much to extend it one station (the racecourse station at Kembla Grange not counting) to Dapto. In a second compromise, trains would continue to Nowra but not the loco-hauled through to Sydney trains that had once run. Everything would be shuttles from this point.\n\nStill, it was a better outcome than closure which had been speculated and leaked to the media, and passengers at two Illawarra stations now had the benefit of electric trains to Sydney. In later years under a different government electrification was extended to Kiama, though again, liberties have been taken to not provide sufficient power to the trains.\n\nThis project is an example of how the Greiner ethos was transmuted from hard ideological and cost-driven closure politics, to a form of ‘win-win’ or at least ‘every child gets a prize’. We will still cut costs, but give out little improvements to take the sting out.\n\nIncongruously for this blog post, an Endeavour train in Cityrail colours running under the Dapto wires which were installed to avoid the need for this. Brad Peadon photo\n\nClosures of the Mail trains and the Tenterfield line beyond Tamworth, other closures\n\nWran had largely finished off the last of the country branchline trains when Mudgee, Griffith and Moree lost their day trains. Moree though, and its parallel destination of Tenterfield had bizarrely kept the Mail trains, though the mail sorting contract with Australia Post (Travelling Post Office) had long gone, and nobody but hardened rail enthusiasts want to ride them. The one to the South had already gone (replaced briefly by an XPT stopping all stations, but then just abandoned). The Western one had stopped going to Forbes, leaving it to just Parkes and Dubbo, though the Silver City Comet had been retimed for an extremely long day connection to the XPT at Orange.\n\nOttley Irwin photo of the Guyra, north of Armidale, on the abandoned Northern line, in snow and not looking too badly worn.\n\nIt was pretty easy for Booz to recommend these be cancelled, and they were. The Tenterfield leg actually became the last regular train north of Armidale and the line had been maintained just for this train. So it was a particularly sorry loss for the fans, more than the others.\n\nOther bits and pieces unattended to by Wran also fell. The Toronto line, a short shuttle from Fassifern on the main Short North, really should have been electrified when Newcastle was, even if ‘on the cheap’ but was instead closed. The death knell for the overnight trains the Brisbane Limited, Gold Coast Motorail Express and the remnant of the Southern Aurora and Spirit of Progress called the Sydney/Melbourne Express (or SEX/MEX) was sounded.\n\nThe depot location for the Tangaras had never been properly sorted. The truncated Ropes Creek line at Dunheved had been mooted, but at the end, not proceeded with. A new depot/workshop called Maintrain at Auburn was ultimately settled upon. This also represented a quasi-privatisation as this would be operated by a contractor.\n\nRolfe Bezier photo from NSWRAIL.NET – Dunheved Yard showing ample room for passenger facilities if required.\n\nCityrail and Countrylink\n\nOne interesting outcome of the Booz work and the Transport Administration Act was the separation of country passenger trains from urban ones. That alone was not new, Victoria, SA and WA had been down that path already for some years and had gone further with a combined management for the bus and tram operations as well as rail. The new operators, really (at the start anyway) just marketing names for the same State Rail Authority passenger services. Freight would be split off into Freight Rail, later Freightcorp, and then just privatised into small fragments.\n\nWhat was a real shot in the arm was placing the entire area from Scone to Nowra, west to Lithgow and south west to Goulburn under the Cityrail umbrella. An area north to south around 370km long and 150km east to west. The numerous provincial suburban, interurban and ex-urban services would all have a firm identity and future under this name. This was quite unexpected in a time of cuts. If the government was prepared to recognise not just the Maitland and Fassifern suburban services, but also even the Scone/Dungog ones, then maybe they would be safe from further cuts. It also gave them the benefits of emerging changes such as computerised ticket machines, which set an upper limit for the fare that could be charged, and was a pathway for the frequency of these services to be improved, and new cars to be ordered.\n\nEven the humble Dungog service had a place in ‘Cityrail’. Photo credit Rob Rouse.\n\nAn unfortunate side-effect of that was the two operators’s train operations would diverge, as had happened with The Met and Vline, or with STA Adelaide and AN. A ticket from Sydney to Newcastle Broadmeadow would now be a very different thing, booked differently and costing differently depending on whether you went by Cityrail or Countrylink. But this was of less significance as the frequency of interurban services offered by Cityrail slowly increased.\n\nCountrylink would be the brand name for the remnant country services. Booz had recommended that if trains were to be kept, they should be run by XPTs. These should also extend to Brisbane and Melbourne, with new trains ordered including a small number of sleeping cars. The Canberra service would cop it in the neck though it would go on to a very strange tale which this post shall relay below.\n\nBob Richardson photo – all XPT service under Countrylink\n\nThe Nationals were demanding their pound of flesh for the bush, and it came in the form of reinstatement of a service from Tamworth to Armidale (the line had been all but closed), the Canberra service, a reinstated service to Moree. This would require a fleet of new self-propelled railcars called Xplorers – the poor man’s XPT with a lower top-speed of 140km/h (though probably enough for the poor track).\n\nOne line they were unable to get right, and haven’t to this day, is the section from Moss Vale to Goulburn. So infrequent is the ‘Cityrail’ service on this section that the relative proportion of Countrylink services is quite high. With a lack of integration between the two, it can be confusing which service is running for the Goulburn passenger.\n\nSayers also brought to Cityrail the concept of ‘Line Manager’ and ‘Customer Manager’. Cynics scoffed, but it was a good idea. Put the bureaucrat’s photo up at stations to humanise them, and convey the notion that one person has a handle on the issues with the line, rather than separate ‘traffic departments’ or ‘civil branch’ or would not care for passenger (sorry, customer) feedback.\n\nIn addition to the customer-facing ‘Line Manager’ stuff, operationally the service was increasingly broken up into ‘Sectors’ with the Illawarra-Eastern Suburbs as one, the large south western group as another and finally the West, North and North Shore as a third for the metropolitan services.\n\nWith some new paint, a few electrification extensions and a smiling face on the station noticeboard, it did look like maybe the worst was over, the railways had bounced off the bottom and would rise again.\n\nFreightrail and the end of the electric locos.\n\nWhile not specifically a Booz outcome, corporatising Freightrail was going to be the first nail in the coffin of the electric freights. With multiple rail authorities who would pay for the volts in the wires?\n\nBut that was only the half of it. The locos were failing ahead of their time, the power supply was not strong enough and who would want to run a loco for just a few hours along the track before it had to be shunted off and replaced with a diesel? The diesels they were buying, now the 81, 82 and 90 classes, were more powerful than the electrics (which was scandalous and not the way in Europe, where electrics of 3 times the power were in use). They certainly were no longer needed merely to ascend Cowan Bank or the Blue Mountains. Soon National Rail would be in place, and they would expect their new NR class to run for days at a time coupled to the one train, if needed from Brisbane to Perth.\n\nIt is probably fortunate that the electrification’s failure on freight haulage was somewhat offset by the success with growing passenger demand. It was though, a lost opportunity for high voltage long distance electrification that might have covered the Hunter Valley and as far as Gunnedah and Kandos for the freight, and a lost opportunity to have realigned the track for a genuinely fast run to Newcastle and Wollongong.\n\nStill, with the lines to Newcastle, Wollongong and the Mountains running at respectable frequencies (while the Moss Vale line doesn’t), the benefits to passengers are obvious.\n\nDuring the Greiner period some classic country lines, ones that nobody expected to see the end of, such as Cooma, Bourke and Mudgee effectively stopped running, though it was rarely a firm announcement. In NSW, abandoned rails are just left down with the pretend claim they are still ‘open’.\n\nAbove-rail competition\n\nThe first glimmers of what would become a normal part of the industry started appearing, with the Lachlan Valley preservation group starting LV railfreight, to run trains to Canowindra when the government railways had clearly lost interest. Not many such trains ran, and the line was in poor condition, but was an interesting prelude to the movement that would get going in earnest as the other states privatised their rail freight operators and open access regimes took hold. It would also provide an opening for the Greiner-Fahey government, and its Labor successors, to privatise the remnant Freightrail/Freightcorp. Near the end of this government, the negotiations federally for a new federal operator to be called National Rail would move into the space Freightrail was still occupying carrying the NSW portion of interstate intermodal trains.\n\nDalliance with Scandinavia\n\nThis has been covered before in this blog’s posts on Sweden and Denmark. When Minister Baird and Ross Sayers tired of being the voices who said no, and out of the blue, there seemed to be some interest in Swedish and Danish trains. Maybe the then Swedish-dominated successor to Comeng, ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB, later taken over by Daimler Benz then by Bombardier) had put them up to it.\n\nTo wit, a SJ X2000 tilt train set, or rather, a driving trailer and two sitting cars, were brought out to NSW and at considerable expense in modifying trackside and some XPT power cars, the train ran as a scheduled service for a few months between Sydney and Canberra, and in an amusing homage to the Neville Wran they so despised, recreated his 1981-2 tour with the XPT power cars, taking the Nordic trains out to the flyblown heat of Moree and Condobolin among many places. Places which would never hope to see the train in service, and some would never see a passenger train again.\n\nBut NSW and Australia had never seen anything like them. The cafeteria section looked like it was actually designed for ‘normals‘ ie people riding the train for business or paying at their own expense rather than the welfare class that increasingly dominated country passenger travel. They actually tried to get to Canberra as fast as they could, a novelty since the late 1930s when the Spirit of Progress train did the same. Most other train timetabling in Australia was about putting plenty of padding in the timetable so you didn’t have to worry about reliability.\n\nThe X2000, a train for ‘normals’\n\nIt did attract a lot of interest and ridership – despite them not cancelling the other train to Canberra that still ran – but struggled even then to beat the Murray’s bus in time and price.\n\nWhen it was all over they went home – no tilt trains were ordered in the event (and foolish to think they would be as they had just placed the order for more XPTs and the Explorers, which were by then as conventional a train as you could get. A parliamentary inquiry was held – it supported the idea but also noted at 160km/h you didn’t need them if you just fixed the track, as QR had.\n\nThe speculation of the period also rolled on to Denmark, with their IC3 class trains that were then new being talked about. These did not tilt. Apart from the loading gauge being wrong for using them ‘as built’ for Denmark, others asked sensible questions of whether traction gear and airconditioning equipment would cope with the differences in temperature and alignment. No Danish train ever needed to climb 1 in 33 grades in 40 degree heat.\n\nThe period did exemplify though, how the Greiner Government, by then, had quite lost interest in its hard right-wing edge to the blade.\n\nElectric variant of the original Danish IC3, seen here in Kalmar, Sweden, on a Copenhagen service\n\nGreiner exits\n\nThey won again in 1991 but only just. To retain government, this was the first emergence of moderate right wing independents, MPs who would keep a Liberal Government in office but take the sharp edges off.\n\nNot for the last time (the next government under O’Farrell had an eerie re-run) did a Liberal Premier, the white knight, stumble onto the trap he had himself laid. Having set up the ICAC to catch the corrupt Labor Ministers (which it spectacularly failed to do, instead catching middle level bureaucrats of different sorts), he fell into the same trap.\n\nAnother of his dapper and well-spoken hard men Terry Metherell, supposed to catch out the teachers, instead buckled under the weight of the education portfolio. Then, when Metherell rebelled, Greiner sought to pay him off with a sinecure at the Electricity Commission, a move ICAC interpreted ‘strictly’ as corruption, at which point Greiner had no choice but to resign.\n\nThe late John Fahey, his Finance Minister of no great charisma or prominence became the Premier. Bruce Baird ran against him for Premier but stayed on in Transport.\n\nBy now, it was hard to discern what this government was about. Labor had improved with patient oppositioning by Bob Carr. With Metherell gone and the government now in minority it would be at the mercy of the independents and there was no great resistance to the idea of handing government over to Carr if he got the numbers on the floor of Parliament.\n\nAirport line\n\nIn great contrast to the situation in Victoria, where recession had knocked the stuffing out of Joan Kirner’s government and the first Kennett government, NSW had continued to grow and the need for rail expansion had not eased. Wran had extended the East Hills line to Glenfield quite successfully and opened the Eastern Suburbs line but longstanding gaps in the network, to Sydney’s Hills District, through North Ryde and through the Inner South to the Airport had not been filled.\n\nThere had also been a long standing need to expand the Sydenham to Redfern section to six tracks, however, on examining the cost and how any new project would need much wider track bases than was assumed back when Joe Cahill had a go, merging this project with the Airport line, and providing the 3rd track pair as the Airport line through to Turrella, seemed a good idea.\n\nAfter some to-ing and fro-ing about whether the line would be the ‘whole hog’ to Chatswood (which made some sense, as the ridership of passenger aviation is dominated by people who live in Sydney’s north and east), but at considerable extra cost for a harbour crossing; or the minimal option of just using the Botany (freight) Line, in the end a new passenger standard line would be built from Turrella with a new station at Wolli Creek, two airport stations and two other stations, but would terminate short of Central where it would merge into the normal network and use the City Circle. In so doing, it boosted the capacity of the network over the effective Sydenham/Tempe to Redfern section, but did nothing to help the capacity through the city let alone across the harbour.\n\nReaders may have forgotten but the dig through the sandy soil at the airport was not without its hitches and media beat-ups at the time. Whatever the problems along the way, the fate of the project was tied to the other big Fahey achievement (though his government would not last the distance) – winning the rights to host the Olympics.\n\nWhen the line did open, under Carr, various problems from the high cost of fares, overcrowding and undercrowding of the trains, and general reliability problems, gave the line a poor reputation, which it has since shaken off. Fahey did not stay in government to see it, but commencing it was one (of few) achievements for his government.\n\nEndeavour Cars\n\nThe final look of the NSW urban railways as we know today was almost achieved with the removal of the remaining loco-hauled cars, DEB 900 cars and most of the 620 class railcars through the ordering of the Endeavour self-propelled cars, basically the same as the Xplorer with the Cummins-Voith traction package but a less comfortable fitout, for use on the diesel suburban and interurban routes around Newcastle and Wollongong. Sensing electoral problems, more Xplorer cars were ordered in 1994.\n\nXplorer leaving Armidale – photo credit Bailey Thorpe\n\nExeunt\n\nFahey lingered on the the 1995 election with police corruption becoming the issue (remember this was the other bookend to their government, that they would nail Labor for corruption) and lacking any direction and purpose, they did not fall across the line but hoped some independents might back them. When that ultimately failed, Carr became Premier by a small margin.\n\nCarr promised to reintroduce the Griffith and Broken Hill services (albeit token weekly services) and the last Xplorer cars became instrumental in being able to deliver that promise.\n\nThe Rail Legacy\n\nApart from the Airport line there is not a lot positive to put down to this government. Though the Cityrail arrangement was later reversed by the next Liberal government, the actual operation of the trains beyond Berowra, Emu Plains, Waterfall and Macarthur still seems more aligned with the suburban trains than the former Countrylink operations. The ticketing remains the same. The attitude to rail also became noticeably pragmatic within the Liberal National Coalition, placing them at odds with their Federal parties. The Federal members for the same seats, people like Tony Abbott or Scott Morrison, or even in those days John Howard or John Hewson, had so much less love for rail than even Greiner or Bairds.\n\nGreiner went on to the private-corporate sector and this blog used to see him frequently in the lift at work. When he became Chair of the Infrastructure NSW quango, some of his hard-right anti-rail attitude was back, though again there were surprises, like his recommendation to finish the Eastern Suburbs line to Kingsford as before.\n\nThis blog will, for the moment, skip over the Labor Government and note that Mike Baird, Baird the Younger, seemed to have some of his father’s interest in the rail portfolio, notwithstanding that the seat of Manly is not much of a place to promote it from, and definitely reflects an accommodation the state LNP seems to have made with its voting base, who do need to see both rail and road well funded and operated.\n\nBoth the Labor and current Liberal governments are for a later post."
