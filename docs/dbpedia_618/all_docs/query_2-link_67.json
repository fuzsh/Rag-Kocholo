        "text": "NSW taxpayers are coughing up more than $1 million dollars a year providing offices, drivers, telephones and stationery for former premiers and governors.\n\nSome of them left government decades ago, including former premiers Nick Greiner and Bob Carr.\n\nPast premiers cost over $1 million from 2016-2017\n\nLatest figures from the NSW Department of Premier and Cabinet show Nick Greiner, who was premier 26 years ago, cost NSW $318,942 for the 2016-2017 financial year.\n\nMr Greiner — who is now a member of multiple company boards such as QBE Asia Pacific (where he is chairman), Rothschild Australia Limited and Crosby Textor, as well as being a consultant to Transurban Limited — had his office rent worth more than $192,000 paid for.\n\nFormer Labor premier Bob Carr cost NSW taxpayers $168,247 on office rent. While $123,000 was spent on staff salaries and $9000 on telephones.\n\nIn total the NSW Government paid out $1.132 million dollars on offices, salaries, drivers, transport, car parking, phones and other stationery for past premiers in 2016-2017.\n\nFormer premier John Fahey, who left state politics in 1996, spent $22,517 on car transport and telephones.\n\nCosts have crept up over the past five years\n\nAustralian Taxpayers Alliance Director of Public Policy Satya Marar said it was \"absolutely terrible\" to see the \"post office perks\".\n\nFormer premier Barry O'Farrell tried to axe the program in 2011 but faced heated legal opposition from Bob Carr and Nick Greiner.\n\nIn order to rein in ballooning costs — in 2011-2012 the total was $1.6m — Mr O'Farrell announced only premiers who had served five years or more could access the scheme.\n\nIt meant a number of Labor premiers missed out, as did Mike Baird and Mr O'Farrell himself.\n\nBy 2012-13 the scheme's total had dropped to $662,000 but it has slowly crept back up over the past five years.\n\nGreens MP David Shoebridge said the Government was \"cutting funding for National Parks and women's shelters\" while it coughed up for former premiers' hire cars and offices.\n\nA spokeswoman from Premier Gladys Berejiklian's office said there were no plans to make any changes to the scheme."
