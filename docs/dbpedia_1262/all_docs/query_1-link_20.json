        "text": "“Death is not extinguishing the light;\n\nit is putting out the lamp\n\nbecause the dawn has come.”\n\n~Rabindranath Tagore~\n\nJanavi Held, also known as Sri Jahnavi Devi Dasi, left behind an eclectic collection of work spanning across various mediums of expression, including artistic photography, cinematography, essays, short stories, digital art, and especially, poetry. Her voluminous literary oeuvre consists of over four thousand poems, which will be curated for a series of anthologies.\n\nOriginally born, Judith, she first began writing poetry and wandering around with her father’s camera as a child in New York. Later, her spiritual father, Hridayananda Das Goswami, bestowed the name Sri Janavi Dasi upon her, as per the Bhakti yoga lineage tradition. ​"
