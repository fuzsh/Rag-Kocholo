        "text": "This citadel of learning named after the medieval poet of Humanity, Chandidas, was founded in 1972 at the village of Khujutipara under Nanoor police station in the district of Birbhum with a motto of imparting higher education to the rural youth.\n\nIt grew out of the long-standing desire of the people of this underdeveloped area for higher education. It was almost impossible for the local students, coming largely from economically and socially backward classes, to attend the college either at Bolpur or Katwa as commuters. Realising their plight, some educationists struggled hard to establish this college, defying all odds, mostly financial. The sapling they planted has now branched out in many directions, now blossoming forth with colours and fragrance.\n\nThe college stands nearly midway between Burdwan and Suri (Via Khujutipara) and between Burdwan and Berhampure (Via Khujutipara).\n\nThe College breathes natural air of human relations among students and the staff beyond the boundary that prides in it.\n\nThe College facilitates the students to take-up their desired course to cope with the changing academic scenario. In addition to this college strives to promote and develop their employability skill in the changing global atmosphere including women empowerment.
