        "text": "Sexual Harrasment in Educational Institutions: While this is not new, what is new is that many are speaking up against it. There are very few precedents one can cite in which the perpetrator has been penalized adequately. Therefore, we are at our wit's end in assuring our students, \"Don't lose patience; you will get justice!\" But justice barely arrives! But, every one of you, whether you are a student or someone working somewhere, please acquaint yourself with the Vishakha Guidelines - what may tantamount to harrassment, what is molestation, what is an attempt to rape, how may you report a perpetrator, in what language you should call out a perpetrator, what should you do when you feel exploited, but have no \"concrete evidence\" - these and much more is what every single person should know! Not just heterosexual cis-women, queer persons too, for the 2018 verdict by the Supreme Court of India in favour of reading down Sec 377 of the IPC, does allow queer people to report sexual harrasment. Because there is no formal sex education at any academic level - school, college or university - most of us are not aware of the law! And this is the advantage most perpetrators take. So, to begin with acquaint yourself with the law. #sexeducation #sexualharassment #sexualmisconduct #students #knowthelaw #lgbtq\n\nI'm seeing a lot of posts, articles, and comments about the Great Resignation, mostly from older hiring managers who cannot comprehend why a huge group of people are willingly leaving their jobs. As an older millennial, I'm happy to break it down for you: We saw two planes slam into buildings on live tv while we were in our teens, our college years were fraught with our peers serving in a needless war, we entered the job market during the worst recession this country has ever seen, we graduated with crippling student loan debt, we witnessed innocent people dying in real-time on social media and the upheaval that followed those events, we've been edged out of the housing market, and now we're cruising into year two of a global pandemic that has forced us to make pretty harrowing choices about our own health and the health of those we love. We're exhausted. If you find yourself scratching your head and thinking \"why can't I find good talent?!\" it's because we're no longer impressed with ping pong tables and beer on tap. We don't care about those things. Working remotely isn't a perk - it's the bare minimum. Let's start treating hiring with a little more human kindness and compassion. We're leaving jobs because we have nothing to lose. We've seen it all and we've lived through the worst. For the last time, your grey cubicles and happy hours aren't cutting it anymore. Companies everywhere: step up your comp packages, your health insurance, your 401k matches. Bring your best to the table and maybe we will, too. If not, we'll be fine. We're a resilient bunch. #jobs #hiring #kindness #health #talent #greatresignation\n\nWhen people ask what I do, I tell them that I \"manage a freelance writing business\" rather than call myself a \"freelancer.\" That was a simple mindset shift that literally altered my life! Because freelance writing IS a business, and I'm a business owner. The sooner you change your mindset to reflect your reality, the sooner you will reap the benefits of your hard work. You'll go from being a scared content writer to asserting yourself and demanding the respect and value you deserve. A simple mindset shift can change your life too! #freelancewriter #contentwriter #saasmarketing\n\nMost new managers think that becoming a manager is the “graduation.” Truth is, it’s the reverse. Leaders work for their employees. That means you have to understand what your employees want at a deep level. You have to be constantly adapting to their needs and what they want from the organization. When you go from being someone who “executes” to someone who’s managing a team, you go from trading on IQ to trading on EQ. You go from doing the actual work to listening to employees, catering to what they want, taking the blame, and being the bigger person.\n\nAs a social media manager (just one of the things I do) for Cactus Communications, I have profiled close to 70 Cactizens for a series called 'CACTUS stories'. One theme that I keep seeing in the writeups I receive is people talking about how the company truly cares about its people - and not something it just declares on the About Us page of its website. I came across this sentiment echoed in a writeup I was editing today and I was reminded of the time the pandemic was announced and we were asked to work from home. Soon after the move to WFH, leaders at the organization (anyone managing a team) received an email from HR asking them to give team members time off, check in frequently, and be sensitive to their needs. The email didn't discuss anything about monitoring productivity or business goals. TAKE CARE OF YOUR PEOPLE is what the email said. I remember reading horror stories on social media about other companies insisting that their employees work from the office despite the threat of infection (things weren't too bad in India back then, but the government had asked offices to restrict commute) or work over the weekend and extra hours to make up for lost time. And I thought to myself how lucky I was to be working for a company that places the wellbeing of its employees first. This is only one of the many times CACTUS has shown that it's a great place to work for."
