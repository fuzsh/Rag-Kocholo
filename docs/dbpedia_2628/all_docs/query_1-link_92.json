        "text": "Keane, Donovan and Gerrard are all out of contract at the end of the year. If we could expose them in the draft, I would, but I thought that there was a proviso that you must protect DP's. Does that apply where the contract expires in a month? (And I know LD is not a DP, but I am sure he could be exposed because everybody else knows he's not about to agree to play for them).\n\nUnless that's new a rule added to the new CBA, DP's have been made available in past drafts. Claudio Bieler, Jairo Arrieta, Tim Cahill and Thierry Henry were all left unprotected in the last expansion draft.\n\nHowever if a DP has a no trade clause in their contract they must be left protected.\n\nSo how do you move to having a mature and sophisticated enough fan base to come for \"just\" good soccer? Are we forever destined to be captives of the casual people who follow the \"flavor of last month.\" I am NOT saying you are wrong, but I am searching for a strategy to getting past where we are now and take the next step as a fan base.\n\nI've said this before: Hollywood MAKES the next stars. Why can't LA's team do the same?\n\nOf course, it would present a marketing challenge.....\n\nIt’s a very good question. Most of the original MLS teams have failed to make or even try making the transition to what Seattle and TFC have, but Sporting KC has shown it’s possible. I’d say part of the problem is the feedback loop LA has, their “big name” player strategy has largely paid off. SKC didn’t have much to lose by targeting the market they did, LA does.\n\nMy working theory is second and third generation Galaxy fans will demand it. If 1996-2016 represent first generation fans, they were a mix of soccer moms & dads taking their AYSO kids to see a game, immigrants who were desperate for anything and weirdos like you and I who liked soccer despite its pariah status in America.\n\nPicking an arbitrary point in soccer history, let’s say soccer became “cool” when Landon scored that goal against Algeria. I think the kids who were 10-12 years old for that game who didn’t grow up with the stigma that soccer was for losers will demand it. When they have the purchasing power to replace that first generation in enough numbers. The ones who sit at centerfield with their parents buy look over at ACB and LARS and want to enjoy the game from there. That’s long term, short term …\n\nTaking out my dead horse bat, yeah marketing. It genuinely stumps me the Galaxy were unable to parlay the 2010-2012 are in to sell outs. How do you squander a double-winning side of Landon Donovan David Beckham and Robbie Keane? Ditto Landon’s “retirement” season?\n\nI don’t see anything about the marketing side of our organization that shows they know how to address creating a sustained and engaged fanbase outside of riding the coat-tails of Dan Bekerman’s rubber stamp.\n\nLAFC will spur them on, like Chivas USA did for a brief period when they actually tried. For as much grief as I give them and their “fans” they are doing a remarkable job of building brand equity. Between their stadium size, branding efforts and yes, location I’m certain LAFC will sell out every game. I’ve seen commentary from Klein they’re ready for LAFC, but I don’t think they are. There’s a gap in LAG’s institutional knowledge they don’t seemingly recognize is there. I’m interested to see what happens in 2018 if and when AEG steps in with a more direct hand and who in the front office steps up and who gets dismissed.\n\nhttp://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/...t-hell-be-mls-2017-other-galaxy-vets-stay-mum\n\nCOMMERCE CITY, Colo. – Just after losing out to the Colorado Rapids on penalty kicks, the questions started flying about the future of a veteran-heavy LA Galaxy team – and its coach.\n\nTwo of LA’s Designated Players – Robbie Keane and Steven Gerrard – are out of contract at the end of the year, and did not start any of LA’s three playoff games. Head coach Bruce Arena is also out of contract, and has so far stayed mum on his future.\n\n“The makeup of your team changes a fair amount year to year but never keep a team together in the long term because of our various rules and the salary cap,” said Arena when asked about not only his own status but those of some key players from recent championship runs.\n\nAlthough Gerrard did not speak to media, Keane did address his future after the game, noting that he could wind up an opponent of the Galaxy in 2017. When asked by reporters post-match about his next step, Keane said confidently, “I’ll be playing next year, somewhere. Whether that’s here or somewhere else I’ll 100% be playing in the league.”\n\nThe future of Landon Donovan, Major League Soccer’s all-time goals and assists leader, is also up in the air after his surprise return to the Galaxy for the stretch run. Donovan, who originally retired at the end of the 2014 season before making his comeback, stayed mum when asked about his next move.\n\n“It’s not the time to talk about that,” said the US International legend before trailing off, “you’ll see me – I don’t know where, but…”\n\nArena gave a similar reply regarding Donovan’s future, saying, “I don’t know anything about next year. We just finished playing. I haven’t got in to 2017 yet.”\n\nAs for Arena, the Galaxy head coach and GM seemed to indicate that a return is on the cards, but didn’t offer anything concrete to the assembled media one way or the other.\n\n“I don’t talk about my contract,” the five-time MLS Cup winner said. “As of now I am [going to be back] but we’ll see.”\n\nOk, I got it. Bruce is GM/Director/Czar/High Priest. Sign Keane as a Player/Coach so part of his salary won't count against the cap. He comes on as a sub if/when needed(though if he's coach, he may sub himself in at 10'). Then use a DP spot for LD and get a DP #9 (or winger and start Zardes up top).\n\n---------------Keane---------\n\n---------Gio------------------\n\nEma--Lletget--LD--Zardes\n\nRogers---JVD---Steres--AJ\n\n-------------Rowe------------\n\nMaybe McBean or Lassiter to start up top? If Cole stays, I'd rather AJ at CB.\n\nI'd rather see Donovan as a non-DP super sub/spot starter. If he's a player coach too, I'm cool with that as well.\n\nI can almost guarantee the Keane doesn't want to come off the bench. He'll want to start and wear the armband. If Keane wants to start, score goals, and be treated like a hero he should move to Shamrock Rovers."
