        "text": "Videodensitometric Methods for Cardiac Output Measurements\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMischi, Massimo; Kalker, Ton; Korsten, Erik\n\n2003-12-01\n\nCardiac output is often measured by indicator dilution techniques, usually based on dye or cold saline injections. Developments of more stable ultrasound contrast agents (UCA) are leading to new noninvasive indicator dilution methods. However, several problems concerning the interpretation of dilution curves as detected by ultrasound transducers have arisen. This paper presents a method for blood flow measurements based on UCA dilution. Dilution curves are determined by real-time densitometric analysis of the video output of an ultrasound scanner and are automatically fitted by the Local Density Random Walk model. A new fitting algorithm based on multiple linear regression is developed. Calibration, that is, the relation between videodensity and UCA concentration, is modelled by in vitro experimentation. The flow measurement system is validated by in vitro perfusion of SonoVue contrast agent. The results show an accurate dilution curve fit and flow estimation with determination coefficient larger than 0.95 and 0.99, respectively.\n\nInvestigation of a continuous heating/cooling technique for cardiac output measurement.\n\nPubMed\n\nEhlers, K C; Mylrea, K C; Calkins, J M\n\n1987-01-01\n\nCardiac output is frequently measured to assess patient hemodynamic status in the operating room and intensive care unit. Current research for measuring cardiac output includes continuous sinusoidal heating and synchronous detection of thermal signals. This technique is limited by maximum heating element temperatures and background thermal noise. A continuous heating and cooling technique was investigated in vitro to determine if greater thermal signal magnitudes could be obtained. A fast responding thermistor was employed to measure consecutive ejected temperature plateaus in the thermal signal. A flow bath and mechanical ventricle were used to simulate the cardiovascular system. A thermoelectric module was used to apply heating and cooling energy to the flow stream. Trials encompassing a range of input power, input frequency, and flow rate were conducted. By alternating heating and cooling, thermal signal magnitude can be increased when compared to continuous heating alone. However, the increase was not sufficient to allow for recording in all patients over the expected normal range of cardiac output. Consecutive ejected temperature plateaus were also measured on the thermal signal and ejection fraction calculations were made.\n\n[Measurement of cardiac output by thermodilution with a diode as a temperature sensor].\n\nPubMed\n\nDÃ­az FernÃ¡ndez, A; BenÃ­tez, D; SÃ¡nchez Tello, G; MÃ¡rquez, L A\n\n1979-01-01\n\nAn area integrator for the thermodilution curve in cardiac output measurement is described. A new temperature sensor is used, a diode with some advantages over the thermistor normally used. The main advantages are: easy calibration and replacement, and broad range of linearity. The cardiac output values obtained in dog with the integrator follow a linear relationship with those of the flowmeter. In simultaneous measurements the correlation is R = 0.96. Using a diode as temperature sensor a modification of the Steward Hamilton equation (used for thermistor) is necessary. With this new equation a monogram is performed to calculate the cardiac output from the area given by the numerical integrator.\n\nMathematics and the Heart: Understanding Cardiac Output\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nChampanerkar, Jyoti\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis paper illustrates a biological application of the concepts of relative change and area under a curve, from mathematics. We study two biological measures \"relative change in cardiac output\" and \"cardiac output\", which are predictors of heart blockages and other related ailments. Cardiac output refers to the quantity ofâ¦\n\nCorrelation of carotid blood flow and corrected carotid flow time with invasive cardiac output measurements.\n\nPubMed\n\nMa, Irene W Y; Caplin, Joshua D; Azad, Aftab; Wilson, Christina; Fifer, Michael A; Bagchi, Aranya; Liteplo, Andrew S; Noble, Vicki E\n\n2017-12-01\n\nNon-invasive measures that can accurately estimate cardiac output may help identify volume-responsive patients. This study seeks to compare two non-invasive measures (corrected carotid flow time and carotid blood flow) and their correlations with invasive reference measurements of cardiac output. Consenting adult patients (nÂ =Â 51) at Massachusetts General Hospital cardiac catheterization laboratory undergoing right heart catheterization between February and April 2016 were included. Carotid ultrasound images were obtained concurrently with cardiac output measurements, obtained by the thermodilution method in the absence of severe tricuspid regurgitation and by the Fick oxygen method otherwise. Corrected carotid flow time was calculated as systole time/âcycle time. Carotid blood flow was calculated as ÏÂ ÃÂ (carotid diameter) 2 /4Â ÃÂ velocity time integralÂ ÃÂ heart rate. Measurements were obtained using a single carotid waveform and an average of three carotid waveforms for both measures. Single waveform measurements of corrected flow time did not correlate with cardiac output (ÏÂ =Â 0.25, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.49, pÂ =Â 0.08), but an average of three waveforms correlated significantly, although weakly (ÏÂ =Â 0.29, 95% CI 0.02-0.53, pÂ =Â 0.046). Carotid blood flow measurements correlated moderately with cardiac output regardless of if single waveform or an average of three waveforms were used: ÏÂ =Â 0.44, 95% CI 0.18-0.63, pÂ =Â 0.004, and ÏÂ =Â 0.41, 95% CI 0.16-0.62, pÂ =Â 0.004, respectively. Carotid blood flow may be a better marker of cardiac output and less subject to measurements issues than corrected carotid flow time.\n\nComparison Between Doppler-Echocardiography and Uncalibrated Pulse Contour Method for Cardiac Output Measurement: A Multicenter Observational Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nScolletta, Sabino; Franchi, Federico; Romagnoli, Stefano; CarlÃ , Rossella; Donati, Abele; Fabbri, Lea P; Forfori, Francesco; Alonso-IÃ±igo, JosÃ© M; Laviola, Silvia; Mangani, Valerio; Maj, Giulia; Martinelli, Giampaolo; Mirabella, Lucia; Morelli, Andrea; Persona, Paolo; Payen, Didier\n\n2016-07-01\n\nEchocardiography and pulse contour methods allow, respectively, noninvasive and less invasive cardiac output estimation. The aim of the present study was to compare Doppler echocardiography with the pulse contour method MostCare for cardiac output estimation in a large and nonselected critically ill population. A prospective multicenter observational comparison study. The study was conducted in 15 European medicosurgical ICUs. We assessed cardiac output in 400 patients in whom an echocardiographic evaluation was performed as a routine need or for cardiocirculatory assessment. None. One echocardiographic cardiac output measurement was compared with the corresponding MostCare cardiac output value per patient, considering different ICU admission categories and clinical conditions. For statistical analysis, we used Bland-Altman and linear regression analyses. To assess heterogeneity in results of individual centers, Cochran Q, and the I statistics were applied. A total of 400 paired echocardiographic cardiac output and MostCare cardiac output measures were compared. MostCare cardiac output values ranged from 1.95 to 9.90âL/min, and echocardiographic cardiac output ranged from 1.82 to 9.75âL/min. A significant correlation was found between echocardiographic cardiac output and MostCare cardiac output (r = 0.85; p < 0.0001). Among the different ICUs, the mean bias between echocardiographic cardiac output and MostCare cardiac output ranged from -0.40 to 0.45âL/min, and the percentage error ranged from 13.2% to 47.2%. Overall, the mean bias was -0.03âL/min, with 95% limits of agreement of -1.54 to 1.47âL/min and a relative percentage error of 30.1%. The percentage error was 24% in the sepsis category, 26% in the trauma category, 30% in the surgical category, and 33% in the medical admission category. The final overall percentage error was 27.3% with a 95% CI of 22.2-32.4%. Our results suggest that MostCare could be an alternative to echocardiography to assess\n\nMeasurement of cardiac output using improved chromatographic analysis of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).\n\nPubMed\n\nKlocke, F J; Roberts, D L; Farhi, E R; Naughton, B J; Sekovski, B; Klocke, R A\n\n1977-06-01\n\nA constant current variable frequency pulsed electron capture detector has been incorporated into the gas chromatographic analysis of trace amounts of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) in water and blood. The resulting system offers a broader effective operating range than more conventional electron capture units and has been utilized for measurements of cardiac output employing constant-rate infusion of dissolved SF6. The SF6 technique has been validated against direct volumetric measurements of cardiac output in a canine right-heart bypass preparation and used subsequently for rapidly repeated measurements in conscious animals and man.\n\nValidity of cardiac output measurement by the thermodilution method in the presence of acute tricuspid regurgitation.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoerboom, L E; Kinney, T E; Olinger, G N; Hoffmann, R G\n\n1993-10-01\n\nEvaluation of patients with acute tricuspid insufficiency may include assessment of cardiac output by the thermodilution method. The accuracy of estimates of thermodilution-derived cardiac output in the presence of tricuspid insufficiency has been questioned. This study was designed to determine the validity of the thermodilution technique in a canine model of acute reversible tricuspid insufficiency. Cardiac output as measured by thermodilution and electromagnetic flowmeter was compared at two grades of regurgitation. The relationship between these two methods (thermodilution/electromagnetic) changed significantly from a regression slope of 1.01 +/- 0.18 (mean +/- standard deviation) during control conditions to a slope of 0.86 +/- 0.23 (p < 0.02) during severe regurgitation. No significant change was observed between control and mild regurgitation or between the initial control value and a control measurement repeated after tricuspid insufficiency was reversed at the termination of the study. This study shows that in a canine model of severe acute tricuspid regurgitation the thermodilution method underestimates cardiac output by an amount that is proportional to the level of cardiac output and to the grade of regurgitation.\n\nEvaluation of concordance among three cardiac output measurement techniques in adult patients during cardiovascular surgery postoperative care.\n\nPubMed\n\nMuÃ±oz, L; Velandia, A; Reyes, L E; Arevalo-RodrÃ­guez, I; MejÃ­a, C; Asprilla, D; Uribe, D V; Arevalo, J J\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe standard method for cardiac output measuring is thermodilution although it is an invasive technique. Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) offers a dynamic and functional alternative to thermodilution. Analyze concordance between two TEE methods and thermodilution for cardiac output assessment. Observational concordance study in cardiovascular surgery patients that required pulmonary artery catheter. TEE cardiac output measurement at both mitral annulus (MA) and left ventricle outflow tract (LVOT) were performed. Results were compared with thermodilution. Correlation was evaluated by Lin's concordance correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. Statistical analysis was undertaken in STATA 13.0. Twenty-five patients were enrolled. Fifty two percent of patients were male, median age and ejection fraction was 63 years and 35% respectively. Median thermodilution, LVOT and MA -measured cardiac output was 3.25 L/min, 3.46 L/min and 8.4 L/min respectively. Different values between thermodilution and MA measurements were found (Lin concordance=0.071; Confidence Interval 95%=-0.009 to 0.151; Spearman's correlation=0.22) as values between thermodilution and LVOT (Lin concordance=0.232; Confidence Interval 95%=-0.12 a 0.537; Spearman's correlation 0.28). Bland-Altman analysis showed greater difference between MA measurements and thermodilution (DM=-0.408; Bland-Altman Limits=-0.809 to -0.007), than the other echocardiographic findings (DM=0.007; Bland-Altman Limits=-0.441 to 0.428). Results from cardiac output measurement by doppler and 2D-TEE on both MA and LVOT do not correlate with those obtained by thermodilution. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U. y SEMICYUC.

CO measured by pulmonary artery catheter thermodilution is considered the gold standard but carries a small risk of severe complications. Stroke volume and CO can be measured by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), which is widely used during cardiac surgery. We hypothesized that Doppler-derived CO by 3-dimensional (3D) TEE would agree well with CO measured with pulmonary artery catheter thermodilution as a reference method based on accurate measurements of the cross-sectional area of the left ventricular outflow tract. The primary aim was a systematic comparison of CO with Doppler-derived 3D TEE and CO by thermodilution in a broad population of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A subanalysis was performed comparing cross-sectional area by TEE with cardiac computed tomography (CT) angiography. Sixty-two patients, scheduled for elective heart surgery, were included; 1 was subsequently excluded for logistic reasons. Inclusion criteria were coronary artery bypass surgery (N = 42) and aortic valve replacement (N = 19). Exclusion criteria were chronic atrial fibrillation, left ventricular ejection fraction below 0.40 and intracardiac shunts. Nineteen randomly selected patients had a cardiac CT the day before surgery. All images were stored for blinded post hoc analyses, and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess agreement between measurement methods, defined as the bias (mean difference between methods), limits of agreement (equal to bias Â± 2 standard deviations of the bias), and percentage error (limits of agreement divided by the mean of the 2 methods). Precision was determined for the individual methods (equal to 2 standard deviations of the bias between replicate measurements) to determine the acceptable limits of agreement. We found a good precision for Doppler-derived CO measured by 3D TEE, but although the bias for Doppler-derived CO by 3D compared to\n\nComparison of pulsed Doppler and thermodilution methods for measuring cardiac output in critically ill patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nDonovan, K D; Dobb, G J; Newman, M A; Hockings, B E; Ireland, M\n\n1987-09-01\n\nWe obtained 145 consecutive cardiac output measurements in 38 critically ill patients, using the invasive thermodilution and the noninvasive pulsed Doppler methods. The mean thermodilution cardiac output (TDCO) was 5.7 +/- 1.87 L/min and the mean pulsed Doppler cardiac output (PDCO) was 5.16 +/- 1.66 L/min. The mean difference between the two measurements was 0.51 L/min with an SD greater than 1.6 L/min, reflecting the scattering of results. The overall correlation coefficient was .58. The intercepts were large and the regression equation some way from the line of equal values (TDCO = 2.28 + 0.66 PDCO). When the results were analyzed according to diagnosis or by group experience, there were some differences in the bias of the estimate; however, the SD of the difference between methods was greater than one liter/min in all groups. Thus, the pulsed Doppler method failed to estimate accurately TDCO in critically ill patients.\n\nMeasurement of cardiac output from dynamic pulmonary circulation time CT\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nYee, Seonghwan, E-mail: Seonghwan.Yee@Beaumont.edu; Scalzetti, Ernest M.\n\nPurpose: To introduce a method of estimating cardiac output from the dynamic pulmonary circulation time CT that is primarily used to determine the optimal time window of CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Methods: Dynamic pulmonary circulation time CT series, acquired for eight patients, were retrospectively analyzed. The dynamic CT series was acquired, prior to the main CTPA, in cine mode (1 frame/s) for a single slice at the level of the main pulmonary artery covering the cross sections of ascending aorta (AA) and descending aorta (DA) during the infusion of iodinated contrast. The time series of contrast changes obtained for DA,moreÂ Â» which is the downstream of AA, was assumed to be related to the time series for AA by the convolution with a delay function. The delay time constant in the delay function, representing the average time interval between the cross sections of AA and DA, was determined by least square error fitting between the convoluted AA time series and the DA time series. The cardiac output was then calculated by dividing the volume of the aortic arch between the cross sections of AA and DA (estimated from the single slice CT image) by the average time interval, and multiplying the result by a correction factor. Results: The mean cardiac output value for the six patients was 5.11 (l/min) (with a standard deviation of 1.57 l/min), which is in good agreement with the literature value; the data for the other two patients were too noisy for processing. Conclusions: The dynamic single-slice pulmonary circulation time CT series also can be used to estimate cardiac output.Â«Â less\n\nDetermination of Cardiac Output and Ejection Fraction with the Dual Cardiac Probe\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCardenas, Carlos G.; Depuey, E. Gordon; Thompson, Wayne L.; Garcia, Efrain; Burdine, John A.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nCardiac output and left ventricular ejection fraction were determined noninvasively at the bedside in 26 patients by using a dual scintillation probe. The probe is a nonimaging detector that records a high frequency time-activity curve of the passage of an intravenously injected radioactive bolus through the heart. Results were correlated with ejection fraction measured by biplane cineangiography (r = 0.80) and cardiac output determined by green dye dilution (R = 0.86). It is concluded that the dual probe provides an accurate noninvasive means of measuring these parameters, and that it may be particularly applicable to serial measurements in patients in the intensive care unit.

CO was measured using three methods: (1) thermodilution (TD), (2) electromagnetic (EM) flow meter placed on the pulmonary artery and (3) transoesophageal echo-Doppler (OD) placed on the descending aorta. Measurements of CO were obtained before (steady state) and after induction of a low CO state with thiopentone 5 mg kg-1 i.v. After CWB injection, mean CO measured by EM and OD increased by 26% and 27%, respectively (P < 0.05) during steady state, and by 85% and 75% (P < 0.05) during the low CO state. This transient increase was produced by an increase in stroke volume, while heart rate did not change. Frank Starling's law may explain this variation by a sudden increase in preload produced by CWB injection. These results indicate that thermodilution overestimated CO during low CO states when CWB injection was used.\n\nAgreement of Bioreactance Cardiac Output Monitoring With Thermodilution During Hemorrhagic Shock and Resuscitation in Adult Swine.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerlin, David A; Peprah-Mensah, Harrison; Manoach, Seth; Heerdt, Paul M\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe study tests the hypothesis that noninvasive cardiac output monitoring based upon bioreactance (Cheetah Medical, Portland, OR) has acceptable agreement with intermittent bolus thermodilution over a wide range of cardiac output in an adult porcine model of hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation. Prospective laboratory animal investigation. Preclinical university laboratory. Eight ~ 50âkg Yorkshire swine with a femoral artery catheter for blood pressure measurement and a pulmonary artery catheter for bolus thermodilution. With the pigs anesthetized and mechanically ventilated, 40âmL/kg of blood was removed yielding marked hypotension and a rise in plasma lactate. After 60 minutes, pigs were resuscitated with shed blood and crystalloid. Noninvasive cardiac output monitoring and intermittent thermodilution cardiac output were simultaneously measured at nine time points spanning baseline, hemorrhage, and resuscitation. Simultaneous noninvasive cardiac output monitoring and thermodilution measurements of cardiac output were compared by Bland-Altman analysis. A plot was constructed using the difference of each paired measurement expressed as a percentage of the mean of the pair plotted against the mean of the pair. Percent bias was used to scale the differences in the measurements for the magnitude of the cardiac output. Method concordance was assessed from a four-quadrant plot with a 15% zone of exclusion. Overall, noninvasive cardiac output monitoring percent bias was 1.47% (95% CI, -2.5 to 5.4) with limits of agreement of upper equal to 33.4% (95% CI, 26.5-40.2) and lower equal to -30.4% (95% CI, -37.3 to -23.6). Trending analysis demonstrated a 97% concordance between noninvasive cardiac output monitoring and thermodilution cardiac output. Over the wide range of cardiac output produced by hemorrhage and resuscitation in large pigs, noninvasive cardiac output monitoring has acceptable agreement with thermodilution cardiac output.\n\nPulse Wave Transit Time Measurements of Cardiac Output in Septic Shock Patients: A Comparison of the Estimated Continuous Cardiac Output System with Transthoracic Echocardiography.\n\nPubMed\n\nFeissel, Marc; Aho, Ludwig Serge; Georgiev, Stefan; Tapponnier, Romain; Badie, Julio; BruyÃ¨re, RÃ©mi; Quenot, Jean-Pierre\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe determined reliability of cardiac output (CO) measured by pulse wave transit time cardiac output system (esCCO system; COesCCO) vs transthoracic echocardiography (COTTE) in mechanically ventilated patients in the early phase of septic shock. A secondary objective was to assess ability of esCCO to detect change in CO after fluid infusion. Mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the ICU, aged >18 years, in sinus rhythm, in the early phase of septic shock were prospectively included. We performed fluid infusion of 500 ml of crystalloid solution over 20 minutes and recorded CO by EsCCO and TTE immediately before (T0) and 5 minutes after (T1) fluid administration. Patients were divided into 2 groups (responders and non-responders) according to a threshold of 15% increase in COTTE in response to volume expansion. In total, 25 patients were included, average 64Â±15 years, 15 (60%) were men. Average SAPSII and SOFA scores were 55Â±21.3 and 13Â±2, respectively. ICU mortality was 36%. Mean cardiac output at T0 was 5.8Â±1.35 L/min by esCCO and 5.27Â±1.17 L/min by COTTE. At T1, respective values were 6.63 Â± 1.57 L/min for esCCO and 6.10Â±1.29 L/min for COTTE. Overall, 12 patients were classified as responders, 13 as non-responders by the reference method. A threshold of 11% increase in COesCCO was found to discriminate responders from non-responders with a sensitivity of 83% (95% CI, 0.52-0.98) and a specificity of 77% (95% CI, 0.46-0.95). We show strong correlation esCCO and echocardiography for measuring CO, and change in CO after fluid infusion in ICU patients.\n\nCardiac output and systemic vascular resistance: Clinical assessment compared with a noninvasive objective measurement in children with shock.\n\nPubMed\n\nRazavi, Asma; Newth, Christopher J L; Khemani, Robinder G; Beltramo, Fernando; Ross, Patrick A\n\n2017-06-01\n\nTo evaluate physician assessment of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance in patients with shock compared with an ultrasonic cardiac output monitor (USCOM). To explore potential changes in therapy decisions if USCOM data were available using physician intervention answers. Double-blinded, prospective, observational study in a tertiary hospital pediatric intensive care unit. Forty children (<18years) admitted with shock, requiring ongoing volume resuscitation or inotropic support. Two to 3 physicians clinically assessed cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance, categorizing them as high, normal, or low. An investigator simultaneously measured cardiac index (CI) and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) with USCOM categorized as high, normal, or low. Overall agreement between physician and USCOM for CI (48.5% [Îº = 0.18]) and SVRI (45.9% [Îº = 0.16]) was poor. Interobserver agreement was also poor for CI (58.7% [Îº = 0.33]) and SVRI (52.3% [Îº = 0.28]). Comparing theoretical physician interventions to \"acceptable\" or \"unacceptable\" clinical interventions, based on USCOM measurement, 56 (21%) physician interventions were found to be \"unacceptable.\" There is poor agreement between physician-assessed CI and SVRI and USCOM, with significant interobserver variability among physicians. Objective measurement of CI and SVRI may reduce variability and improve diagnostic accuracy. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A.; Sawin, C. F.; Mauldin, D. G.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nThe single-breath cardiac output measurement technique of Kim et al. (1966) has been modified for use in obtaining cardiac output measurements during exercise-stress tests on Apollo astronauts. The modifications involve the use of a respiratory mass spectrometer for data acquisition and a digital computer program for data analysis. The variation of the modified method for triplicate steady-state cardiac output measurements was plus or minus 1 liter/min. The combined physiological and methodological variation seen during a set of three exercise tests on a series of subjects was 1 to 2.5 liter/min. Comparison of the modified method with the direct Fick technique showed that although the single-breath values were consistently low, the scatter of data was small and the correlation between the two methods was high. Possible reasons for the low single-breath cardiac output values are discussed.\n\nValidation of cardiac output studies from the Mostcare compared to a pulmonary artery catheter in septic patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nGopal, S; Do, T; Pooni, J S; Martinelli, G\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThe Mostcare monitor is a non-invasive cardiac output monitor. It has been well validated in cardiac surgical patients but there is limited evidence on its use in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. The study included the first 22 consecutive patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in whom the floatation of a pulmonary artery catheter was deemed necessary to guide clinical management. Cardiac output measurements including cardiac output, cardiac index and stroke volume were simultaneously calculated and recorded from a thermodilution pulmonary artery catheter and from the Mostcare monitor respectively. The two methods of measuring cardiac output were compared by Bland-Altman statistics and linear regression analysis. A percentage error of less than 30% was defined as acceptable for this study. Bland-Altman analysis for cardiac output showed a Bias of 0.31 L.min-1, precision (=SD) of 1.97 L.min-1 and a percentage error of 62.54%. For Cardiac Index the bias was 0.21 L.min-1.m-2, precision of 1.10 L.min-1.m-2 and a percentage error of 64%. For stroke volume the bias was 5 mL, precision of 24.46 mL and percentage error of 70.21%. Linear regression produced a correlation coefficient r2 for cardiac output, cardiac index, and stroke volume, of 0.403, 0.306, and 0.3 respectively. Compared to thermodilution cardiac output, cardiac output studies obtained from the Mostcare monitor have an unacceptably high error rate. The Mostcare monitor demonstrated to be an unreliable monitoring device to measure cardiac output in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock on an intensive care unit.\n\nThe relationship between cardiac output and dynamic cerebral autoregulation in humans.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeegan, B M; Devine, E R; Geraghty, M C; Jones, E; Ãlaighin, G; Serrador, J M\n\n2010-11-01\n\nCerebral autoregulation adjusts cerebrovascular resistance in the face of changing perfusion pressures to maintain relatively constant flow. Results from several studies suggest that cardiac output may also play a role. We tested the hypothesis that cerebral blood flow would autoregulate independent of changes in cardiac output. Transient systemic hypotension was induced by thigh-cuff deflation in 19 healthy volunteers (7 women) in both supine and seated positions. Mean arterial pressure (Finapres), cerebral blood flow (transcranial Doppler) in the anterior (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA), beat-by-beat cardiac output (echocardiography), and end-tidal Pco(2) were measured. Autoregulation was assessed using the autoregulatory index (ARI) defined by Tiecks et al. (Tiecks FP, Lam AM, Aaslid R, Newell DW. Stroke 26: 1014-1019, 1995). Cerebral autoregulation was better in the supine position in both the ACA [supine ARI: 5.0 Â± 0.21 (mean Â± SE), seated ARI: 3.9 Â± 0.4, P = 0.01] and MCA (supine ARI: 5.0 Â± 0.2, seated ARI: 3.8 Â± 0.3, P = 0.004). In contrast, cardiac output responses were not different between positions and did not correlate with cerebral blood flow ARIs. In addition, women had better autoregulation in the ACA (P = 0.046), but not the MCA, despite having the same cardiac output response. These data demonstrate cardiac output does not appear to affect the dynamic cerebral autoregulatory response to sudden hypotension in healthy controls, regardless of posture. These results also highlight the importance of considering sex when studying cerebral autoregulation.\n\nThe accuracy of PiCCOÂ® in measuring cardiac output in patients under therapeutic hypothermia: Comparison with transthoracic echocardiography.\n\nPubMed\n\nSouto Moura, T; Aguiar Rosa, S; Germano, N; Cavaco, R; Sequeira, T; Alves, M; Papoila, A L; Bento, L\n\n2018-03-01\n\nInvasive cardiac monitoring using thermodilution methods such as PiCCOÂ® is widely used in critically ill patients and provides a wide range of hemodynamic variables, including cardiac output (CO). However, in post-cardiac arrest patients subjected to therapeutic hypothermia, the low body temperature possibly could interfere with the technique. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (ECHO) has long proved its accuracy in estimating CO, and is not influenced by temperature changes. To assess the accuracy of PiCCOÂ® in measuring CO in patients under therapeutic hypothermia, compared with ECHO. Thirty paired COECHO/COPiCCO measurements were analyzed in 15 patients subjected to hypothermia after cardiac arrest. Eighteen paired measurements were obtained at under 36Â°C and 12 at â¥36Â°C. A value of 0.5l/min was considered the maximum accepted difference between the COECHO and COPiCCO values. Under conditions of normothermia (â¥36Â°C), the mean difference between COECHO and COPiCCO was 0.030 l/min, with limits of agreement (-0.22, 0.28) - all of the measurements differing by less than 0.5 l/min. In situations of hypothermia (<36Â°C), the mean difference in CO measurements was -0.426 l/min, with limits of agreement (-1.60, 0.75), and only 44% (8/18) of the paired measurements fell within the interval (-0.5, 0.5). The calculated temperature cut-off point maximizing specificity was 35.95Â°C: above this temperature, specificity was 100%, with a false-positive rate of 0%. The results clearly show clinically relevant discordance between COECHO and COPiCCO at temperatures of <36Â°C, demonstrating the inaccuracy of PiCCOÂ® for cardiac output measurements in hypothermic patients.

In this study, a commercial bathroom scale was modified to measure the BCGs of nine healthy subjects recovering from treadmill exercise. During the recovery, Doppler echocardiogram signals were obtained simultaneously from the left ventricular outflow tract of the heart. The percentage changes in root-mean-square (RMS) power of the BCG were strongly correlated with the percentage changes in cardiac output measured by Doppler echocardiography (R(2) = 0.85, n = 275 data points). The correlation coefficients for individually analyzed data ranged from 0.79 to 0.96. Using Bland-Altman methods for assessing agreement, the mean bias was found to be -0.5% (+/-24%) in estimating the percentage changes in cardiac output. In contrast to other non-invasive methods for trending cardiac output, the unobtrusive procedure presented here uses inexpensive equipment and could be performed without the aid of a medical professional.\n\nCardiac output monitoring using indicator-dilution techniques: basics, limits, and perspectives.\n\nPubMed\n\nReuter, Daniel A; Huang, Cecil; Edrich, Thomas; Shernan, Stanton K; Eltzschig, Holger K\n\n2010-03-01\n\nThe ability to monitor cardiac output is one of the important cornerstones of hemodynamic assessment for managing critically ill patients at increased risk for developing cardiac complications, and in particular in patients with preexisting cardiovascular comorbidities. For >30 years, single-bolus thermodilution measurement through a pulmonary artery catheter for assessment of cardiac output has been widely accepted as the \"clinical standard\" for advanced hemodynamic monitoring. In this article, we review this clinical standard, along with current alternatives also based on the indicator-dilution technique, such as the transcardiopulmonary thermodilution and lithium dilution techniques. In this review, not only the underlying technical principles and the unique features but also the limitations of each application of indicator dilution are outlined.\n\nClinical Validation of Non-Invasive Cardiac Output Monitoring in Healthy Pregnant Women.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcLaughlin, Kelsey; Wright, Stephen P; Kingdom, John C P; Parker, John D\n\n2017-11-01\n\nNon-invasive hemodynamic monitoring has the potential to be a valuable clinical tool for the screening and management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The objective of this study was to validate the clinical utility of the non-invasive cardiac output monitoring (NICOM) system in pregnant women. Twenty healthy pregnant women with a singleton pregnancy at 22 to 26 weeks' gestation were enrolled in this study. Measures of heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output were obtained through NICOM and compared with Doppler echocardiography. NICOM significantly overestimated measures of both stroke volume and cardiac output compared with Doppler echocardiography (95 Â± 4 vs. 73 Â± 4 mL, P < 0.0001; and 7.4 Â± 0.2 vs. 5.6 Â± 0.2 L/min, P < 0.0001; respectively). There is no gold standard for the measurement of cardiac output in the setting of pregnancy. However, once normal values have been established, NICOM has the potential to be a useful clinical tool for monitoring maternal hemodynamics in pregnant women. Further investigation regarding the validity of NICOM is required in larger populations of healthy and hypertensive pregnant women to determine whether this device is appropriate for maternal hemodynamic assessment during pregnancy.

Prospective observational clinical trial. Pediatric cardiac operating theater in a university hospital. In 21 children (6.1 Â± 2.6 kg, mean Â± SD) undergoing heart surgery, cardiac output was simultaneously recorded by ultrasound dilution (extracorporeal arteriovenous loop connected to existing arterial and central venous catheters) and a transit-time ultrasound probe applied to the ascending aorta, and when possible, the main pulmonary artery. The pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio estimated from ultrasound dilution curve analysis was compared with that estimated from transit-time ultrasound technology. Bland-Altman analysis of the whole cohort (90 pairs, before and after surgery) showed a bias between transit-time ultrasound (1.01 Â± 0.47 L/min) and ultrasound dilution technology (1.03 Â± 0.51 L/min) of -0.02 L/min, limits of agreement -0.3 to 0.3 L/min, and percentage error of 31%. In children with no residual shunts, the bias was -0.04 L/min, limits of agreement -0.28 to 0.2 L/min, and percentage error 19%. The pooled co efficient of variation was for the whole cohort 3.5% (transit-time ultrasound) and 6.3% (ultrasound dilution), and in children without shunt, it was 2.9% (transit-time ultrasound) and 4% (ultrasound dilution), respectively. Ultrasound dilution identified the presence of shunts (pulmonary to systemic blood flow â 1) with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 92%. Mean pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio by transit-time ultrasound was 2.6 Â± 1.0 and by ultrasound dilution 2.2 Â± 0.7 (not significant).

(Inventor); Sherman, Derin A. (Inventor); Mukkamala, Ramakrishna (Inventor)\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe present invention provides methods and apparatus for determining a dynamical property of the systemic or pulmonary arterial tree using long time scale information, i.e., information obtained from measurements over time scales greater than a single cardiac cycle. In one aspect, the invention provides a method and apparatus for monitoring cardiac output (CO) from a single blood pressure signal measurement obtained at any site in the systemic or pulmonary arterial tree or from any related measurement including, for example, fingertip photoplethysmography.According to the method the time constant of the arterial tree, defined to be the product of the total peripheral resistance (TPR) and the nearly constant arterial compliance, is determined by analyzing the long time scale variations (greater than a single cardiac cycle) in any of these blood pressure signals. Then, according to Ohm's law, a value proportional to CO may be determined from the ratio of the blood pressure signal to the estimated time constant. The proportional CO values derived from this method may be calibrated to absolute CO, if desired, with a single, absolute measure of CO (e.g., thermodilution). The present invention may be applied to invasive radial arterial blood pressure or pulmonary arterial blood pressure signals which are routinely measured in intensive care units and surgical suites or to noninvasively measured peripheral arterial blood pressure signals or related noninvasively measured signals in order to facilitate the clinical monitoring of CO as well as TPR.\n\nQuantification of mitral regurgitation by automated cardiac output measurement: experimental and clinical validation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSun, J. P.; Yang, X. S.; Qin, J. X.; Greenberg, N. L.; Zhou, J.; Vazquez, C. J.; Griffin, B. P.; Stewart, W. J.; Thomas, J. D.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVES: To develop and validate an automated noninvasive method to quantify mitral regurgitation. BACKGROUND: Automated cardiac output measurement (ACM), which integrates digital color Doppler velocities in space and in time, has been validated for the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract but has not been tested for the LV inflow tract or to assess mitral regurgitation (MR). METHODS: First, to validate ACM against a gold standard (ultrasonic flow meter), 8 dogs were studied at 40 different stages of cardiac output (CO). Second, to compare ACM to the LV outflow (ACMa) and inflow (ACMm) tracts, 50 normal volunteers without MR or aortic regurgitation (44+/-5 years, 31 male) were studied. Third, to compare ACM with the standard pulsed Doppler-two-dimensional echocardiographic (PD-2D) method for quantification of MR, 51 patients (61+/-14 years, 30 male) with MR were studied. RESULTS: In the canine studies, CO by ACM (1.32+/-0.3 liter/min, y) and flow meter (1.35+/-0.3 liter/min, x) showed good correlation (r=0.95, y=0.89x+0.11) and agreement (deltaCO(y-x)=0.03+/-0.08 [mean+/-SD] liter/min). In the normal subjects, CO measured by ACMm agreed with CO by ACMa (r=0.90, p < 0.0001, deltaCO=-0.09+/-0.42 liter/min), PD (r=0.87, p < 0.0001, deltaCO=0.12+/-0.49 liter/min) and 2D (r=0.84, p < 0.0001, deltaCO=-0.16+/-0.48 liter/min). In the patients, mitral regurgitant volume (MRV) by ACMm-ACMa agreed with PD-2D (r= 0.88, y=0.88x+6.6, p < 0.0001, deltaMRV=2.68+/-9.7 ml). CONCLUSIONS: We determined that ACM is a feasible new method for quantifying LV outflow and inflow volume to measure MRV and that ACM automatically performs calculations that are equivalent to more time-consuming Doppler and 2D measurements. Additionally, ACM should improve MR quantification in routine clinical practice.\n\nValidation and application of single breath cardiac output determinations in man\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLoeppky, J. A.; Fletcher, E. R.; Myhre, L. G.; Luft, U. C.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe results of a procedure for estimating cardiac output by a single-breath technique (Qsb), obtained in healthy males during supine rest and during exercise on a bicycle ergometer, were compared with the results on cardiac output obtained by the direct Fick method (QF). The single breath maneuver consisted of a slow exhalation to near residual volume following an inspiration somewhat deeper than normal. The Qsb calculations incorporated an equation of the CO2 dissociation curve and a 'moving spline' sequential curve-fitting technique to calculate the instantaneous R from points on the original expirogram. The resulting linear regression equation indicated a 24-percent underestimation of QF by the Qsb technique. After applying a correction, the Qsb-QF relationship was improved. A subsequent study during upright rest and exercise to 80 percent of VO2(max) in 6 subjects indicated a close linear relationship between Qsb and VO2 for all 95 values obtained, with slope and intercept close to those in published studies in which invasive cardiac output measurements were used.\n\nExercise cardiac output following Skylab missions - The second manned Skylab mission\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBuderer, M. C.; Mauldin, D. G.; Rummel, J. A.; Michel, E. L.; Sawin, C. F.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nCardiac output was measured during preflight and postflight exercise-stress tests on the Skylab astronauts. In the postflight tests immediately following the 28-, 59-, and 84-d earth orbital missions, the astronauts exhibited an approximate 30% decrease in cardiac output coupled with an approximate 50% decrease in cardiac stroke volume during exercise. These changes were accompanied by elevated heart rates and significant increases in total systemic peripheral vascular resistance. Mean arterial pressure was unchanged. All parameters returned to normal preflight values within 30 d of the end of the orbital period. Duration of the zero-G exposure did not appear to influence either the magnitude of the hemodynamic changes or the time-course of their return to normal. These results are discussed in relation to other cardiovascular findings and possible mechanisms responsible for the observations are outlined.\n\nAccurate, noninvasive continuous monitoring of cardiac output by whole-body electrical bioimpedance.\n\nPubMed\n\nCotter, Gad; Moshkovitz, Yaron; Kaluski, Edo; Cohen, Amram J; Miller, Hilton; Goor, Daniel; Vered, Zvi\n\n2004-04-01\n\nCardiac output (CO) is measured but sparingly due to limitations in its measurement technique (ie, right-heart catheterization). Yet, in recent years it has been suggested that CO may be of value in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment titration of cardiac patients, especially those with congestive heart failure (CHF). We examine the use of a new noninvasive, continuous whole-body bioimpedance system (NICaS; NI Medical; Hod-Hasharon, Israel) for measuring CO. The aim of the present study was to test the validity of this noninvasive cardiac output system/monitor (NICO) in a cohort of cardiac patients. Prospective, double-blind comparison of the NICO and thermodilution CO determinations. We enrolled 122 patients in three different groups: during cardiac catheterization (n = 40); before, during, and after coronary bypass surgery (n = 51); and while being treated for acute congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation (n = 31). MEASUREMENTS AND INTERVENTION: In all patients, CO measurements were obtained by two independent blinded operators. CO was measured by both techniques three times, and an average was determined for each time point. CO was measured at one time point in patients undergoing coronary catheterization; before, during, and after bypass surgery in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery; and before and during vasodilator treatment in patients treated for acute heart failure. Overall, 418 paired CO measurements were obtained. The overall correlation between the NICO cardiac index (CI) and the thermodilution CI was r = 0.886, with a small bias (0.0009 +/- 0.684 L) [mean +/- 2 SD], and this finding was consistent within each group of patients. Thermodilution readings were 15% higher than NICO when CI was < 1.5 L/min/m(2), and 5% lower than NICO when CI was > 3 L/min/m(2). The NICO has also accurately detected CI changes during coronary bypass operation and vasodilator administration for acute CHF. The results of the present study indicate\n\nMechanisms Regulating the Cardiac Output Response to Cyanide Infusion, a Model of Hypoxia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLiang, Chang-seng; Huckabee, William E.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nWhen tissue metabolic changes like those of hypoxia were induced by intra-aortic infusion of cyanide in dogs, cardiac output began to increase after 3 to 5 min, reached a peak (220% of the control value) at 15 min, and returned to control in 40 min. This pattern of cardiac output rise was not altered by vagotomy with or without atropine pretreatment. However, this cardiac output response could be differentiated into three phases by pretreating the animals with agents that block specific activities of the sympatho-adrenal system. First, ganglionic blockade produced by mecamylamine or sympathetic nerve blockade by bretylium abolished the middle phase of the cardiac output seen in the untreated animal, but early and late phases still could be discerned. Second, beta-adrenergic receptor blockade produced by propranolol shortened the total duration of the cardiac output rise by abolishing the late phase. Third, when given together, propranolol and mecamylamine (or bretylium) prevented most of the cardiac output rise that follows the early phase. When cyanide was given to splenectomized dogs, the duration of the cardiac output response was not shortened, but the response became biphasic, resembling that seen after chemical sympathectomy. A similar biphasic response of the cardiac output also resulted from splenic denervation; sham operation or nephrectomy had no effect on the monophasic pattern of the normal response. Splenic venous blood obtained from cyanide-treated dogs, when infused intraportally, caused an increase in cardiac output in recipient dogs; similar infusion of arterial blood had no effects. These results suggest that the cardiac output response to cyanide infusion consists of three components: an early phase, related neither to the autonomic nervous system nor to circulating catecholamines; a middle phase, caused by a nonadrenergic humoral substance released from the spleen by sympathetic stimulation; and a late phase, dependent upon adrenergic receptors\n\nCardiac output by pulse contour analysis does not match the increase measured by rebreathing during human spaceflight.\n\nPubMed\n\nHughson, Richard L; Peterson, Sean D; Yee, Nicholas J; Greaves, Danielle K\n\n2017-11-01\n\nPulse contour analysis of the noninvasive finger arterial pressure waveform provides a convenient means to estimate cardiac output (QÌ). The method has been compared with standard methods under a range of conditions but never before during spaceflight. We compared pulse contour analysis with the Modelflow algorithm to estimates of QÌ obtained by rebreathing during preflight baseline testing and during the final month of long-duration spaceflight in nine healthy male astronauts. By Modelflow analysis, stroke volume was greater in supine baseline than seated baseline or inflight. Heart rate was reduced in supine baseline so that there were no differences in QÌ by Modelflow estimate between the supine (7.02âÂ±â1.31 l/min, meansâÂ±âSD), seated (6.60âÂ±â1.95 l/min), or inflight (5.91âÂ±â1.15 l/min) conditions. In contrast, rebreathing estimates of QÌ increased from seated baseline (4.76âÂ±â0.67 l/min) to inflight (7.00âÂ±â1.39 l/min, significant interaction effect of method and spaceflight, P < 0.001). Pulse contour analysis utilizes a three-element Windkessel model that incorporates parameters dependent on aortic pressure-area relationships that are assumed to represent the entire circulation. We propose that a large increase in vascular compliance in the splanchnic circulation invalidates the model under conditions of spaceflight. Future spaceflight research measuring cardiac function needs to consider this important limitation for assessing absolute values of QÌ and stroke volume. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Noninvasive assessment of cardiac function during human spaceflight is an important tool to monitor astronaut health. This study demonstrated that pulse contour analysis of finger arterial blood pressure to estimate cardiac output failed to track the 46% increase measured by a rebreathing method. These results strongly suggest that alternative methods not dependent on pulse contour analysis are required to track cardiac function in spaceflight\n\nThe correlation between the first heart sound and cardiac output as measured by using digital esophageal stethoscope under anaesthesia.\n\nPubMed\n\nDuck Shin, Young; Hoon Yim, Kyoung; Hi Park, Sang; Wook Jeon, Yong; Ho Bae, Jin; Soo Lee, Tae; Hwan Kim, Myoung; Jin Choi, Young\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThe use of an esophageal stethoscope is a basic heart sounds monitoring procedure performed in patients under general anesthesia. As the size of the first heart sound can express the left ventricle function, its correlation with cardiac output should be investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cardiac output (CO) on the first heart sound (S1) amplitude. Methods : Six male beagles were chosen. The S1 was obtained with the newly developed esophageal stethoscope system. CO was measured using NICOM, a non-invasive CO measuring device. Ephedrine and beta blockers were administered to the subjects to compare changes in figures, and the change from using an inhalation anesthetic was also compared. The S1 amplitude displayed positive correlation with the change rate of CO (r = 0.935, p < 0.001). The heart rate measured using the esophageal stethoscope and ECG showed considerably close figures through the Bland-Altman plot and showed a high positive correlation (r = 0.988, p < 0,001). In beagles, the amplitude of S1 had a significant correlation with changes in CO in a variety of situations.\n\nIncreased cardiac output elicits higher VÌO2max in response to self-paced exercise.\n\nPubMed\n\nAstorino, Todd Anthony; McMillan, David William; Edmunds, Ross Montgomery; Sanchez, Eduardo\n\n2015-03-01\n\nRecently, a self-paced protocol demonstrated higher maximal oxygen uptake versus the traditional ramp protocol. The primary aim of the current study was to further explore potential differences in maximal oxygen uptake between the ramp and self-paced protocols using simultaneous measurement of cardiac output. Active men and women of various fitness levels (N = 30, mean age = 26.0 Â± 5.0 years) completed 3 graded exercise tests separated by a minimum of 48 h. Participants initially completed progressive ramp exercise to exhaustion to determine maximal oxygen uptake followed by a verification test to confirm maximal oxygen uptake attainment. Over the next 2 sessions, they performed a self-paced and an additional ramp protocol. During exercise, gas exchange data were obtained using indirect calorimetry, and thoracic impedance was utilized to estimate hemodynamic function (stroke volume and cardiac output). One-way ANOVA with repeated measures was used to determine differences in maximal oxygen uptake and cardiac output between ramp and self-paced testing. Results demonstrated lower (p < 0.001) maximal oxygen uptake via the ramp (47.2 Â± 10.2 mLÂ·kg(-1)Â·min(-1)) versus the self-paced (50.2 Â± 9.6 mLÂ·kg(-1)Â·min(-1)) protocol, with no interaction (p = 0.06) seen for fitness level. Maximal heart rate and cardiac output (p = 0.02) were higher in the self-paced protocol versus ramp exercise. In conclusion, data show that the traditional ramp protocol may underestimate maximal oxygen uptake compared with a newly developed self-paced protocol, with a greater cardiac output potentially responsible for this outcome.\n\nThromboresistant surface coatings for the measurement of cardiac output through continuous low flow peripheral A-V shunts.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDeeb, G M; Borovetz, H S; Griffith, B P; Hardesty, R L\n\n1980-01-01\n\nThe dilution technique for determining cardiac output using indocyanine green dye is limited in patients weighing less than 20 kg because of the obligatory volume loss. Reproducible achieved using the green dye dilution method by the establishment of a low flow peripheral arteriovenous shunt. The shunt materials were treated with thromboresistant agents--TDMAC (7%) and albumin (1 g/dl)--to facilitate the use of this technique without heparin. For A-V shunt flow rates of 8-30 cc/min reproducible values of cardiac output were obtained for up to 38 hours which were in good agreement with determinations made using the conventional technique of dye dilution.

This can be associated with decreased cardiac output and cerebral hypoperfusion, and possibly, inadequate cerebral oxygenation. In the present study, cerebral oxygen saturation was measured during neurosurgery in the sitting position and correlated with cardiac output. Perioperative cerebral oxygen saturation was measured continuously with two different monitors, INVOS Â® and FORE-SIGHT Â® . Cardiac output was measured at eight predefined time points using transoesophageal echocardiography. Forty patients were enrolled, but only 35 (20 female) were eventually operated on in the sitting position. At the first time point, the regional cerebral oxygen saturation measured with INVOS Â® was 70 (sd 9)%; thereafter, it increased by 0.0187% min -1 (P<0.01). The cerebral tissue oxygen saturation measured with FORE-SIGHT Â® started at 68 (sd 13)% and increased by 0.0142% min -1 (P<0.01). The mean arterial blood pressure did not change. Cardiac output was between 6.3 (sd 1.3) and 7.2 (1.8) litre min -1 at the predefined time points. Cardiac output, but not mean arterial blood pressure, showed a positive and significant correlation with cerebral oxygen saturation. During neurosurgery in the sitting position, the cerebral oxygen saturation slowly increases and, therefore, this position seems to be safe with regard to cerebral oxygen saturation. Cerebral oxygen saturation is stable because of constant CO and MAP, while the influence of CO on cerebral oxygen saturation seems to be more relevant. NCT01275898. Â© The Author 2016.

As heart rate usually does not change with PEEP, the entire fall in cardiac output is a consequence of a reduction in left ventricular stroke volume (SV). PEEP-induced changes in cardiac output are analyzed, therefore, in terms of changes in SV and its determinants (preload, afterload, contractility and ventricular compliance). Mechanical ventilation with PEEP, like any other active or passive ventilatory maneuver, primarily affects cardiac function by changing lung volume and intrathoracic pressure. In order to describe the direct cardiocirculatory consequences of respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation and PEEP, this review will focus on the effects of changes in lung volume, factors controlling venous return, the diastolic interactions between the ventricles and the effects of intrathoracic pressure on cardiac function, specifically left ventricular function. Finally, the hemodynamic consequences of PEEP in patients with heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome are discussed.

This study preliminarily describes the regional distribution of cerebral WMH in the context of a normal cerebral perfusion atlas and aims to determine if these variables are associated with reduced cardiac output. Thirty-two participants (72 Â± 8 years old, 38% female) with cardiovascular risk factors or disease underwent structural MRI acquisition at 1.5T using a standard imaging protocol that included FLAIR sequences. WMH distribution was examined in common anatomical space using voxel-based morphometry and as a function of normal cerebral perfusion patterns by overlaying a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) atlas. Doppler echocardiogram data was used to dichotomize the participants on the basis of low (n=9) and normal (n=23) cardiac output. Global WMH count and volume did not differ between the low and normal cardiac output groups; however, atlas-derived SPECT perfusion values in regions of hyperintensities were reduced in the low versus normal cardiac output group (p<0.001). Our preliminary data suggest that participants with low cardiac output have WMH in regions of relatively reduced perfusion, while normal cardiac output participants have WMH in regions with relatively higher regional perfusion. This spatial perfusion distribution difference for areas of WMH may occur in the context of reduced systemic perfusion, which subsequently impacts cerebral perfusion and contributes to subclinical or clinical microvascular damage.

Recent studies have cast doubt on the usefulness of cardiac output as an indicator of LVSD. In impedance cardiography (ICG), the dZ/dt waveform has a systolic wave called the E wave. This study looked at measurements of the amplitude and area of the E wave compared with ICG-derived cardiac output, stroke volume, cardiac index, and stroke index as methods of assessing LVSD. ICG data were obtained from patients (n=26) admitted to a coronary care unit. Clinical LVSD severity was stratified into 4 groups (none, mild, moderate, and severe) based on echocardiography data and standard clinical assessment by a cardiologist blinded to ICG data. Statistical analysis showed that the E wave amplitude and area were better indicators of the level of LVSD than cardiac output, stroke volume, cardiac index, or stroke index. ICG waveform analysis has potential as a simple point-of-care test for detecting LVSD in asymptomatic patients at high risk for developing heart failure and for monitoring LVSD in patients being treated for heart failure.\n\nCardiac output variations in supine resting subjects during head-out cold water immersion.\n\nPubMed\n\nVogelaere, P; Deklunder, G; Lecroart, J\n\n1995-08-01\n\nFive men, aged 31.2 years (SD 2.3), under semi-nude conditions and resting in a dorsal reclining position, were exposed to thermoneutral air for 30 min, followed immediately by a cold water (15 degrees C) immersion for 60 min. Cardiac output was measured using a dual-beam Doppler flow meter. During immersion in cold water, cardiac frequency (fc) showed an initial bradycardia. The lowest values were reached at about 10 min after immersion, 58.3 (SD 2.5) to 48.3 (SD 7.8) beats min-1 (P < 0.05). By the 20th min of exposure, fc had gradually risen to 70.0 beats min-1 (SD 6.6, P < 0.05). This change could be due to the inhibition of the initial vagal reflex by increased catecholamine concentration. Stroke volume (Vs) was significantly increased (P < 0.05) during the whole cold immersion period. Cardiac output, increased from 3.57 (SD 0.50) to 6.26 (SD 1.33) l min-1 (P < 0.05) and its change with time was a function of both Vs and fc. On the other hand, systolic flow acceleration was unchanged during the period of immersion. The changes in the respiratory variables (ventilation, oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide output and respiratory exchange ratio) during immersion showed an initial hyperventilation followed, as immersion proceeded, by a slower metabolic increase due to shivering.\n\nPostoperative Hydrocortisone Infusion Reduces the Prevalence of Low Cardiac Output Syndrome After Neonatal Cardiopulmonary Bypass.\n\nPubMed\n\nRobert, Stephen M; Borasino, Santiago; Dabal, Robert J; Cleveland, David C; Hock, Kristal M; Alten, Jeffrey A\n\n2015-09-01\n\nNeonatal cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is often complicated by morbidity associated with inflammation and low cardiac output syndrome. Hydrocortisone \"stress dosing\" is reported to provide hemodynamic benefits in some patients with refractory shock. Development of cardiopulmonary bypass-induced adrenal insufficiency may provide further rationale for postoperative hydrocortisone administration. We sought to determine whether prophylactic, postoperative hydrocortisone infusion could decrease prevalence of low cardiac output syndrome after neonatal cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Double-blind, randomized control trial. Pediatric cardiac ICU and operating room in tertiary care center. Forty neonates undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized (19 hydrocortisone and 21 placebo). Demographics and known risk factors were similar between groups. After cardiopulmonary bypass separation, bolus hydrocortisone (50âmg/mÂ²) or placebo was administered, followed by continuous hydrocortisone infusion (50âmg/mÂ²/d) or placebo tapered over 5 days. Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing (1 Î¼g) was performed before and after cardiopulmonary bypass, prior to steroid administration. Blood was collected for cytokine analysis before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Subjects receiving hydrocortisone were less likely to develop low cardiac output syndrome (5/19, 26% vs 12/21, 57%; p = 0.049). Hydrocortisone group had more negative net fluid balance at 48 hours (-114 vs -64âmL/kg; p = 0.01) and greater urine output at 0-24 hours (2.7 vs 1.2âmL/kg/hr; p = 0.03). Hydrocortisone group weaned off catecholamines and vasopressin sooner than placebo, with a difference in inotrope-free subjects apparent after 48 hours (p = 0.033). Five placebo subjects (24%) compared with no hydrocortisone subjects required rescue steroids (p = 0.02). Thirteen (32.5%) had adrenal insufficiency after cardiopulmonary bypass.

We compared serial measures of CO using various methods to determine which provided the least variability. Ten patients with spontaneous pregnancy had estimation of CO at baseline prior to becoming pregnant and at the end of the first and third trimesters. Echocardiographic data were used to estimate CO using the Teichholz method, Simpson's biplane method, and the Doppler determined velocity time integral (VTI) method. In addition, a Bioz Dx device was used to estimate CO by impedance cardiography. CO estimated with the VTI method had the lowest beat-to-beat variability. CO estimated with the VTI method was higher than CO estimated with the 2D-Teichholz method and Simpson's method. The percent change in CO during pregnancy was similar for all echo methods (VTI, Teichholz, and Simpson's biplane). Baseline CO determined with impedance cardiography was higher than CO determined with the VTI method. However, change in CO during pregnancy was significantly lower when measured with impedance cardiography. There was marked heterogeneity in the degree of rise in CO during the first trimester (-3 to 55%). The wide variation in the gestational rise in CO was unexpected, and at least in part secondary to variable increase in heart rate. We recommend the use of the Doppler determined VTI method for the estimation of CO in pregnancy. Â© 2017 The Authors.

Cardiac output was measured using a dualbeam Doppler flow meter. During immersion in cold water, cardiac frequency ( f c) showed an initial bradycardia. The lowest values were reached at about 10 min after immersion, 58.3 (SD 2.5) to 48.3 (SD 7.8) beats min-1 ( P < 0.05). By the 20th min of exposure, f c had gradually risen to 70.0 beats min-1 (SD 6.6, P < 0.05). This change could be due to the inhibition of the initial vagal reflex by increased catecholamine concentration.

Cardiac output, increased from 3.57 (SD 0.50) to 6.26 (SD 1.33)1 min-1 ( P < 0.05) and its change with time was a function of both V s and f c.

Previous studies suggested that hydrocortisone administration may improve haemodynamic stability in case of resistant low cardiac output syndrome in critically ill children. This study was set up to test the hypothesis that the effects of hydrocortisone on haemodynamics in children with low cardiac output syndrome depend on the presence of (relative) adrenal insufficiency. A retrospective study was done on paediatric patients who received hydrocortisone when diagnosed with resistant low cardiac output syndrome after paediatric cardiac surgery in the period from 1 November 2005 to 31 December 2008. We studied the difference in effects of treatment with hydrocortisone administration between patients with adrenal insufficiency defined as an exploratory cut-off value of total cortisol of <100 nmol/l and patients with a serum total cortisol of â¥ 100 nmol/l. A total of 62 of patients were enrolled, meeting the inclusion criteria for low cardiac output syndrome. Thirty-two patients were assigned to Group 1 (<100 nmol/l) and 30 were assigned to Group 2 (â¥ 100 nmol/l). Haemodynamics improved after hydrocortisone administration, with an increase in blood pressure, a decrease in administered vasopressors and inotropic drugs, an increase in urine production and a decrease in plasma lactate concentrations. The effects of treatment with hydrocortisone in children with low cardiac output after cardiac surgery was similar in patients with a low baseline serum cortisol concentration and those with normal baseline cortisol levels. A cortisol value using an exploratory cut-off value of 100 nmol/l for adrenal insufficiency should not be used as a criterion to treat these patients with hydrocortisone.\n\nComparison of two methods for cardiac output measurement in critically ill patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaraceni, E; Rossi, S; Persona, P; Dan, M; Rizzi, S; Meroni, M; Ori, C\n\n2011-05-01\n\nThe aim of recent haemodynamic monitoring has been to obtain continuous and reliable measures of cardiac output (CO) and indices of preload responsiveness. Many of these methods are based on the arterial pressure waveform analysis. The aim of our study was to assess the accuracy of CO measurements obtained by FloTrac/Vigileo, software version 1.07 and the new version 1.10 (Edwards Lifesciences LLC, Irvine, CA, USA), compared with CO measurements obtained by bolus thermodilution by pulmonary artery catheterization (PAC) in the intensive care setting. In 21 critically ill patients (enrolled in two University Hospitals), requiring invasive haemodynamic monitoring, PAC and FloTrac/Vigileo transducers connected to the arterial pressure line were placed. Simultaneous measurements of CO by two methods (FloTrac/Vigileo and thermodilution) were obtained three times a day for 3 consecutive days, when possible. The level of concordance between the two methods was assessed by the procedure suggested by Bland and Altman. One hundred and forty-one pairs of measurements (provided by thermodilution and by both 1.07 and 1.10 FloTrac/Vigileo versions) were obtained in 21 patients (seven of them were trauma patients) with a mean (sd) age of 59 (16) yr. The Pearson product moment coefficient was 0.62 (P<0.001). The bias was -0.18 litre min(-1). The limits of agreement were 4.54 and -4.90 litre min(-1), respectively. Our data show a poor level of concordance between measures provided by the two methods. We found an underestimation of CO values measured with the 1.07 software version of FloTrac for supranormal values of CO. The new software (1.10) has been improved in order to correct this bias; however, its reliability is still poor. On the basis of our data, we can therefore conclude that both software versions of FloTrac/Vigileo did not still provide reliable estimation of CO in our intensive care unit setting.\n\nContinuous cardiac output measurement - Aspects of Doppler frequency analysis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMackay, R. S.; Hechtman, H. B.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nFrom the suprasternal notch blood flow velocity in the aorta can be measured non-invasively by a Doppler probe. Integration over systole after frequency analysis gives a measure of stroke volume if a separate diameter observation is incorporated. Frequency analysis by a zero crossing counter or by a set of parallel phaselock loops was less effective than a set of bandpass filters. Observations on dogs, baboons and humans before and after exercise or surgery suggest the indications to be useful. Application to judging heart failure by the effect of introducing a volume load is indicated. Changes in output also are measured in freely moving subjects.\n\nImproved Accuracy of Automated Estimation of Cardiac Output Using Circulation Time in Patients with Heart Failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nDajani, Hilmi R; Hosokawa, Kazuya; Ando, Shin-Ichi\n\n2016-11-01\n\nLung-to-finger circulation time of oxygenated blood during nocturnal periodic breathing in heart failure patients measured using polysomnography correlates negatively with cardiac function but possesses limited accuracy for cardiac output (CO) estimation. CO was recalculated from lung-to-finger circulation time using a multivariable linear model with information on age and average overnight heart rate in 25 patients who underwent evaluation of heart failure. The multivariable model decreased the percentage error to 22.3% relative to invasive CO measured during cardiac catheterization. This improved automated noninvasive CO estimation using multiple variables meets a recently proposed performance criterion for clinical acceptability of noninvasive CO estimation, and compares very favorably with other available methods.

Provided that calibration is accurate and 5.0 mg of dye are injected for each curve, then the percentage standard deviation of measurement using this computer is about 8.7%. Included in this are the errors inherent in the computer, errors due to baseline drift, errors in the injection of dye and acutal variation of cardiac output over a series of successive determinations. The size of this error is comparable to that involved in manual calculation. The mean value of five successive curves will be within 10% of the real value in 99 cases out of 100. Advances in methodology and equipment are discussed which make calibration simpler and more accurate, and which should also improve the quality of computer determination. A list of suggestions is given to minimize the errors involved in the clinical use of this equipment. Images Fig. 4.

However, these techniques usually require a central venous line, an additional catheter, or a special calibration procedure. A new arterial pressure-based cardiac output (COAP) device (FloTracâ¢, Vigileoâ¢; Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) only requires access to the radial or femoral artery using a standard arterial catheter and does not need an external calibration. We validated this technique in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) using COPAC as the method of reference. Methods We studied 20 critically ill patients, aged 16 to 74 years (mean, 55.5 Â± 18.8 years), who required both arterial and pulmonary artery pressure monitoring. COPAC measurements were performed at least every 4 hours and calculated as the average of 3 measurements, while COAP values were taken immediately at the end of bolus determinations. Accuracy of measurements was assessed by calculating the bias and limits of agreement using the method described by Bland and Altman. Results A total of 164 coupled measurements were obtained. Absolute values of COPAC ranged from 2.80 to 10.80 l/min (mean 5.93 Â± 1.55 l/min). The bias and limits of agreement between COPAC and COAP for unequal numbers of replicates was 0.02 Â± 2.92 l/min. The percentage error between COPAC and COAP was 49.3%. The bias between percentage changes in COPAC (ÎCOPAC) and percentage changes in COAP (ÎCOAP) for consecutive measurements was -0.70% Â± 32.28%. COPAC and COAP showed a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.58 (p < 0.01), while the correlation coefficient between ÎCOPAC and ÎCOAP was 0.46 (p < 0.01). Conclusion Although the COAP algorithm shows a minimal bias with COPAC over a wide range of values in an inhomogeneous group of critically ill patients, the scattering of the data remains relative wide.

Cardiac output was calculated from stroke volume and heart volume using the PDE method as well as the Fick procedure for comparison. The mean value for the cardiac output via the PDE method (4.42 L/min) was only 6% lower than for the cardiac output obtained from the Fick procedure (4.69 L/min) and the correlation between the two methods was excellent (r=0.967, p less than .01). The good agreement between the two methods demonstrates that the PDE technique offers a reliable noninvasive alternative for estimating cardiac output, requiring no active cooperation by the subject. It was concluded that the Doppler method is superior to the Fick method in that it provides beat by beat information on cardiac performance.\n\nDecreased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration in low cardiac output patients and its influence on the determination of in vivo p50.\n\nPubMed\n\nPiccioni, Marilde A; Cestari, IdÃ¡gene A; Strunz, CÃ©lia M C; Auler, JosÃ© O\n\n2003-08-01\n\nWe investigated whether 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) is altered in patients with low cardiac output and the influence of its concentration on the calculation of in vivo P(50). Biochemical and blood gas analysis were performed along with the measurement of cardiac output and body temperature in 13 patients submitted to cardiopulmonary bypass surgeries without the use of donor blood. In vivo P(50) was calculated using the measured (P(50m)) and the estimated 2,3-DPG (P(50e)). 2,3-DPG concentration was lower in these patients when compared to the values obtained in normal volunteers (6.9 +/- 2.2 vs. 11.9 +/- 2.4 microm/gHb). P(50m) was lower than P(50e) (21.6 +/- 1.1 vs. 30.1 +/- 1.2 mm Hg) at all time points. Our data show that in patients with low cardiac output, 2,3-DPG concentration is reduced. Therefore, in these patients, the use of standard values for this variable may introduce an error in the calculation of in vivo P(50).\n\nSarcomeric protein modification during adrenergic stress enhances cross-bridge kinetics and cardiac output\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGresham, Kenneth S.; Mamidi, Ranganath; Li, Jiayang; Kwak, Hyerin\n\n2017-01-01\n\nMolecular adaptations to chronic neurohormonal stress, including sarcomeric protein cleavage and phosphorylation, provide a mechanism to increase ventricular contractility and enhance cardiac output, yet the link between sarcomeric protein modifications and changes in myocardial function remains unclear. To examine the effects of neurohormonal stress on posttranslational modifications of sarcomeric proteins, mice were administered combined Î±- and Î²-adrenergic receptor agonists (isoproterenol and phenylephrine, IPE) for 14 days using implantable osmotic pumps. In addition to significant cardiac hypertrophy and increased maximal ventricular pressure, IPE treatment accelerated pressure development and relaxation (74% increase in dP/dtmax and 14% decrease in Ï), resulting in a 52% increase in cardiac output compared with saline (SAL)-treated mice. Accelerated pressure development was maintained when accounting for changes in heart rate and preload, suggesting that myocardial adaptations contribute to enhanced ventricular contractility. Ventricular myocardium isolated from IPE-treated mice displayed a significant reduction in troponin I (TnI) and myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C) expression and a concomitant increase in the phosphorylation levels of the remaining TnI and MyBP-C protein compared with myocardium isolated from saline-treated control mice. Skinned myocardium isolated from IPE-treated mice displayed a significant acceleration in the rate of cross-bridge (XB) detachment (46% increase) and an enhanced magnitude of XB recruitment (43% increase) at submaximal Ca2+ activation compared with SAL-treated mice but unaltered myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation.

We aimed to describe the relationships between cerebral regional tissue oxygen saturation (CrSO 2 ), perfusion index (PI), echocardiographic, and clinical parameters in extremely preterm infants in their first 72Â h of life. Twenty newborns born at <â28Â weeks of gestation were continuously monitored with CrSO 2 and preductal PI. Cardiac output was measured at H6, H24, H48, and H72. The median gestational age and birth weight were 25.0Â weeks (24-26) and 750Â g (655-920), respectively. CrSO 2 and preductal PI had r values <â0.35 with blood gases, lactates, haemoglobin, and mean blood pressure. Cardiac output significantly increased over the 72Â h of the study period. Fifteen patients had at least one episode of low left and/or right ventricular output (RVO), during which there was a strong correlation between CrSO 2 and superior vena cava (SVC) flow (at H6 (râ=â0.74) and H24 (râ=â0.86)) and between PI and RVO (at H6 (râ=â0.68) and H24 (râ=â0.92)). Five patients had low SVC flow (â¤â40Â mL/kg/min) at H6, during which PI was strongly correlated with RVO (râ=â0.98). CrSO 2 and preductal PI are strongly correlated with cardiac output during low cardiac output states. What is Known: â¢ Perfusion index and near-infrared spectroscopy are non-invasive tools to evaluate haemodynamics in preterm infants. â¢ Pre- and postductal perfusion indexes strongly correlate with left ventricular output in term infants, and near-infrared spectroscopy has been validated to assess cerebral oxygenation in term and preterm infants. What is New: â¢ Cerebral regional tissue oxygen saturation and preductal perfusion index were strongly correlated with cardiac output during low cardiac output states. â¢ The strength of the correlation between cerebral regional tissue oxygen saturation, preductal perfusion index, and cardiac output varied in the first 72Â h of life, reflecting\n\nMeasurement of cardiac output in children by pressure-recording analytical method.\n\nPubMed\n\nUrbano, Javier; LÃ³pez, Jorge; GonzÃ¡lez, Rafael; Solana, MarÃ­a JosÃ©; FernÃ¡ndez, Sarah N; BellÃ³n, JosÃ© M; LÃ³pez-Herce, JesÃºs\n\n2015-02-01\n\nWe evaluated two pressure-recording analytical method (PRAM) software versions (v.1 and v.2) to measure cardiac index (CI) in hemodynamically stable critically ill children and investigate factors that influence PRAM values. The working hypothesis was that PRAM CI measurements would stay within normal limits in hemodynamically stable patients. Ninety-five CI PRAM measurements were analyzed in 47 patients aged 1-168 months. Mean CI was 4.1 Â± 1.4 L/min/m(2) (range 2.0-7.0). CI was outside limits defined as normal (3-5 L/min/m(2)) in 53.7% of measurements (47.8% with software v.1 and 69.2% with software v.2, p = 0.062). Moreover, 14.7% of measurements were below 2.5 L/min/m(2), and 13.6% were above 6 L/min/m(2). CI was significantly lower in patients with a clearly visible dicrotic notch than in those without (3.7 vs. 4.6 L/min/m(2), p = 0.004) and in children with a radial arterial catheter (3.5 L/min/m(2)) than in those with a brachial (4.4 L/min/m(2), p = 0.021) or femoral catheter (4.7 L/min/m(2), p = 0.005). By contrast, CI was significantly higher in children under 12 months (4.2 vs. 3.6 L/min/m(2), p = 0.034) and weighing under 10 kg (4.2 vs. 3.6 L/min/m(2), p = 0.026). No significant differences were observed between cardiac surgery patients and the rest of children. A high percentage of CI measurements registered by PRAM were outside normal limits in hemodynamically stable, critically ill children. CI measured by PRAM may be influenced by the age, weight, location of catheter, and presence of a dicrotic notch.\n\nBeat-by-beat analysis of cardiac output and blood pressure responses to short-term barostimulation in different body positions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHildebrandt, Wulf; SchÃ¼tze, Harald; Stegemann, J.\n\nRapid quantification of the human baro-reflex control of heart rate has been achieved on a beat-by-beat basis using a neck-chamber with quick ECG-triggered pressure changes. Referring to recent findings on heart rate and stroke volume, the present study uses this technique to compare cardiac output as well as blood pressure changes in supine and upright position to investigate feedback effects and to confirm postural reflex modifications not revealed by RR-interval changes. A suction profile starting at +40 mmHg and running 7 steps of pressure decrease down to -65 mmHg was examined in 0Â° and 90Â° tilting position while beat-by-beat recordings were done of heart rate, stroke volume (impedance-cardiography) and blood pressure (Finapres tm) (n=16). The percentual heart rate decrease failed to be significantly different between positions. A suction-induced stroke volume increase led to a cardiac output almost maintained when supine and significantly increased when upright. A decrease in all blood pressure values was found during suction, except for systolic values in upright position which increased. Conclusively, (a) it is confirmed that different inotropy accounts for the seen gravitational effect on the cardiac output not represented by heart rate; (b) identical suction levels in different positions lead to different stimuli at the carotid receptor. This interference has to be considered in microgravity studies by beat-by-beat measurement of cardiac output and blood pressure.\n\nImproved hepatic arterial fraction estimation using cardiac output correction of arterial input functions for liver DCE MRI\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChouhan, Manil D.; Bainbridge, Alan; Atkinson, David; Punwani, Shonit; Mookerjee, Rajeshwar P.; Lythgoe, Mark F.; Taylor, Stuart A.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nLiver dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI pharmacokinetic modelling could be useful in the assessment of diffuse liver disease and focal liver lesions, but is compromised by errors in arterial input function (AIF) sampling. In this study, we apply cardiac output correction to arterial input functions (AIFs) for liver DCE MRI and investigate the effect on dual-input single compartment hepatic perfusion parameter estimation and reproducibility. Thirteen healthy volunteers (28.7ââÂ±ââ1.94 years, seven males) underwent liver DCE MRI and cardiac output measurement using aortic root phase contrast MRI (PCMRI), with reproducibility (nââ=ââ9) measured at 7 d. Cardiac output AIF correction was undertaken by constraining the first pass AIF enhancement curve using the indicator-dilution principle. Hepatic perfusion parameters with and without cardiac output AIF correction were compared and 7 d reproducibility assessed. Differences between cardiac output corrected and uncorrected liver DCE MRI portal venous (PV) perfusion (pââ=ââ0.066), total liver blood flow (TLBF) (pââ=ââ0.101), hepatic arterial (HA) fraction (pââ=ââ0.895), mean transit time (MTT) (pââ=ââ0.646), distribution volume (DV) (pââ=ââ0.890) were not significantly different. Seven day corrected HA fraction reproducibility was improved (mean difference 0.3%, Bland-Altman 95% limits-of-agreement (BA95%LoA)ââÂ±27.9%, coefficient of variation (CoV) 61.4% versus 9.3%, Â±35.5%, 81.7% respectively without correction). Seven day uncorrected PV perfusion was also improved (mean difference 9.3âml min-1/100âg, BA95%LoAââÂ±506.1âml min-1/100âg, CoV 64.1% versus 0.9âml min-1/100âg, Â±562.8âml min-1/100âg, 65.1% respectively with correction) as was uncorrected TLBF (mean difference 43.8âml min-1/100âg, BA95%LoAââÂ±586.7âml min-1/ 100âg, CoV 58.3% versus 13.3âml min-1/100âg, Â±661.5âml min-1/100âg, 60.9% respectively with correction\n\nRelationship between cardiac function and resting cerebral blood flow: MRI measurements in healthy elderly subjects.\n\nPubMed\n\nHenriksen, Otto M; Jensen, Lars T; Krabbe, Katja; Larsson, Henrik B W; Rostrup, Egill\n\n2014-11-01\n\nAlthough both impaired cardiac function and reduced cerebral blood flow are associated with ageing, current knowledge of the influence of cardiac function on resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effects of cardiac function on CBF. CBF and cardiac output were measured in 31 healthy subjects 50-75 years old using magnetic resonance imaging techniques. Mean values of CBF, cardiac output and cardiac index were 43.6 ml per 100 g min(-1), 5.5 l min(-1) and 2.7 l min(-1) m(-2), respectively, in males, and 53.4 ml per 100 g min(-1), 4.3 l min(-1) and 2.4 l min(-1) m(-2), respectively, in females. No effects of cardiac output or cardiac index on CBF or structural signs of brain ageing were observed. However, fractional brain flow defined as the ratio of total brain flow to cardiac output was inversely correlated with cardiac index (r(2) = 0.22, P = 0.008) and furthermore lower in males than in females (8.6% versus 12.5%, P = 0.003). Fractional brain flow was also inversely correlated with cerebral white matter lesion grade, although this effect was not significant when adjusted for age. Frequency analysis of heart rate variability showed a gender-related inverse association of increased low-to-high-frequency power ratio with CBF and fractional brain flow. The findings do not support a direct effect of cardiac function on CBF, but demonstrates gender-related differences in cardiac output distribution. We propose fractional brain flow as a novel index that may be a useful marker of adequate brain perfusion in the context of ageing as well as cardiovascular disease.

We sought to establish whether marathon performance is associated with the ability to sustain high fractional use of maximal SV and CO (i.e, cardiac endurance) and/or CO, per meter (i.e., cardiac cost). We measured the SV, heart rate (HR), CO, and running speed of 14 recreational runners in an incremental, maximal laboratory test and then during a real marathon race (mean performance: 3 hr 30 min Â± 45 min). Our data revealed that HR, SV and CO were all in a high but submaximal steady state during the marathon (87.0 Â± 1.6%, 77.2 Â± 2.6%, and 68.7 Â± 2.8% of maximal values, respectively). Marathon performance was inversely correlated with an upward drift in the CO/speed ratio (mL of CO Ã m(-1)) (r = -0.65, P < 0.01) and positively correlated with the runner's ability to complete the race at a high percentage of the speed at maximal SV (r = 0.83, P < 0.0002). Our results showed that marathon performance is inversely correlated with cardiac cost and positively correlated with cardiac endurance. The CO response could be a benchmark for race performance in recreational marathon runners.\n\nNoninvasive continuous cardiac output by the Nexfin before and after preload-modifying maneuvers: a comparison with intermittent thermodilution cardiac output.\n\nPubMed\n\nBubenek-Turconi, Serban Ion; Craciun, Mihaela; Miclea, Ion; Perel, Azriel\n\n2013-08-01\n\nThe Nexfin uses an uncalibrated pulse contour method for the continuous measurement of cardiac output (CO) in a totally noninvasive manner. Since the accuracy of pulse contour methods and their ability to track changes in CO have been repeatedly questioned, we have compared the CO measured by the Nexfin (NAPCO) with the CO measured by the pulmonary artery catheter (PACCO) in cardiosurgical patients before and after preload-modifying maneuvers. Twenty-eight patients who underwent on-pump cardiac surgery, of whom 18 were receiving vasopressor and/or inotropic therapy, were studied during the first postoperative hours. Preload modification, in the form of either a fluid challenge or a passive leg raising maneuver, was done whenever clinically indicated, with PACCO and NAPCO being simultaneously measured before and after each intervention. A fluid challenge was administered to 22 patients, and the passive leg raising maneuver was performed in 6 patients. These interventions were repeated in 19 patients producing a total of 47 pairs of measurements. At baseline, mean (Â±SD) CO was 4.9 Â± 1.1 and 5.0 Â± 1.4 LÂ·min(-1), for the PACCO and NAPCO, respectively, bias 0.1 Â± 1.0, 95% prediction interval -2.5 to 2.4 LÂ·min(-1), and 39% of error. After preload modification, the mean CO was 5.6 Â± 1.3 and 5.6Â± 1.5 LÂ·min(-1) for the PACCO and NAPCO, respectively, bias -0.0 Â± 1.1, 95% prediction interval -2.6 to 2.7 LÂ·min(-1), and 38% of error.
