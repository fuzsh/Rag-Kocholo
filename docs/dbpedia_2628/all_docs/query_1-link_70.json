        "text": "Belgrano were in need of a boost having lost their opening two Primera fixtures and despite trailing from the first leg against Estudiantes, El Pirata secured a stunning 2-0 in the Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes to snatch a place in the last 16 of the Copa Sudamericana.\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 65th minute when Augusto Solari was adjudged to have handled Matías Suárez’s volley providing Claudio Bieler to level the tie from the penalty spot.\n\nIt didn’t stay that way for long as two minutes after slotting the ball past Mariano Andujar, Bieler struck again. This time a cross from the right found its way to the back post and the 32-year-old chested the ball down and rifled it inside the near post.\n\nEstudiantes needed just a goal to go back in front courtesy of the away goals rule but despite throwing on the in-form Ignacio Bailone, El Pincha were unable to find a way back.\n\nBelgrano will face Brazilian side Coritiba in the next round as the last 16 line-up is now complete.\n\nBelgrano 2 – 0 Estudiantes (AGG 2-1)"
