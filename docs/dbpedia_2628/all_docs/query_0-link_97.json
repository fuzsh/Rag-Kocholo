        "text": "Early studies\n\nEarly epidemiological studies: The earliest carcinogens to be identified were generally associated with specific occupations. Bernardino Ramazzini[9] observed in 1713 that nuns suffered from high rates of breast cancer which he attributed to their celibate life. Percivol Pott[10] documented in 1775 that chimney sweeps frequently developed cancer of the scrotum which he deduced to be caused by their heavy exposure to soot. A century afterwards, reports emerged that a variety of other occupations were associated with increased rates of cancer. Richard von Volkmann[11] diagnosed three cases of scrotal cancer in 1875 among coal tar distillers in Germany, which was quickly followed by similar reports by other physicians[12]. Joseph Bell[13] described two cases of scrotal cancer among shale oil workers in Scotland in 1876, and commented that the cancer was quite common among shale oil workers. Harting and Hesse documented in 1879 that miners in the Black Forest regions of Schneeberg in Germany and Joachimsthal in Czechoslovakia suffered from a high mortality due to lung cancer[14,15]. Ludwig Rhen[16,17] reported in 1895 that long term dye workers in Germany frequently perished of bladder cancer. Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen[18] discovered X-rays in 1895, which were heralded as a phenomenal discovery, because they permitted the painless visualization of bones. The early radiologists routinely tested the performance of their equipment by exposing their hands. Then a few days after a prolonged exposure, an extremely painful skin condition termed radiodermatitis developed[19,20]. A decade after Röntgen’s discovery of X-rays, case reports began emerging from many diverse areas of the world, that radiologists were succumbing to skin cancers[21,22].\n\nA few non-occupational agents were also identified during this period. John Hill[23] reported in 1761 that immoderate use of tobacco snuff was associated with the occurrence of nasal cancers[24]. Sir Johnathan Hutchinson[25] observed in 1881 that patients who used a tonic which contained arsenic for extended durations frequently developed keratosis lesions which sometimes progressed to skin cancer.\n\nEarly experimental studies: In the late 1800s, there were three fundamental theories of the cause of cancer[26-28]. Virchow proposed that cancer was a product of chronic irritation[28,29]; Lobstein and Recamier, and later Cohnheim hypothesized that cancer was the result of displaced embryonal tissue[28,29]; others surmised that cancer was caused by an infectious (or parasitic) agent[27,28,30]. Numerous researchers attempted to induce cancer in experimental animals, based on one of these theories. However, experiments to produce tumors with irritating chemicals produced only benign growths[31]. Work to prove Cohnheim’s theory by transplanting embryonal or fetal tissue into adult hosts similarly failed to induce malignant growths[32]. A broad range of microbes were identified in cancerous growths. However attempts to extract the microbes and produce cancers, could not induce cancers reproducibly[28]. Experimental induction of cancer was considered to be important, because this was expected facilitate the development of preventative measures and effective treatments[32].\n\nIn 1908, Ellermann and Bang[33,34] reported that a cell-free filtrate caused a leukemia in chickens, and Peyton Rous[35,36] reported that a cell-free filtrate produced a sarcoma in chickens shortly afterwards. However, work with chickens seemed to be irrelevant to humans, so efforts to produce experimental cancer based on the other theories continued unabated.\n\nJean Clunet designed an experiment which simulated the procedures of early radiologists, who developed radiation burns after prolonged exposures to X-rays[37,38]. He administered X-rays to four rats, at dosages sufficient to induce epidermal ulcerations, then allowed the lesions to heal for a few days, and repeated the exposure[37,38]. Cancer developed in one of two surviving rats at the site of ulceration. However, the experiment was not widely accepted as a success for three reasons: Only one rat developed cancer, the tumor resembled spontaneous tumors of rats, and other experimenters had difficulty reproducing the experiment[39].\n\nKatsusaburo Yamagiwa was a young associate professor, whom the Japanese government considered to have good potential. They sent him to Virchow’s Institute in Germany, where he studied pathology from 1892-1894[26]. von Volkmann’s study of skin cancers among coal tar workers had become very well known by the time of Yamagiwa’s studies, with numerous other investigators reporting additional cases[40,41]. Yamagiwa was intrigued by these reports, so he devised to induce skin cancer in rabbits, by exposing them to conditions which resembled occupational exposure to coal tar. The ears of rabbit’s were not known to be susceptible to spontaneous cancers, so he decided to apply tar to their ears. He reasoned that, since previous attempts to induce experimental tumors produced only benign lesions which regressed, then he should continue to apply tar when the benign lesions emerged. He surmised that the application of tar to benign lesions could promote further changes, which would progress to malignancy[40,41].\n\nWhen Yamagiwa returned to Japan, he applied tar to the ears of 137 rabbits, and repeated the application every two or three days. Seven rabbits eventually developed cancerous lesions. The average cancer developed after five months of tarring; some cancers only emerged after a year of tar application[40,41]. Yamagiwa recorded the occurrence of metastasis in two of the rabbits, which confirmed the malignant nature of the tumors, and the experiment became widely regarded as the first successful experimental induction of cancer.\n\nNumerous experimenters attempted to replicate Yamagiwa’s experiment. Many endeavors to reproduce the experiment failed, which led investigators to decipher why Yamagiwa’s experiment was efficacious. It became evident that many previous experimenters failed because they did not continue their treatments for a sufficient duration. Woglom colorfully reflected in 1926, that Yamagiwa and Ichikawa were possessed of “infinite patience”, because they continued to apply tar for many months without evidence that cancers would develop[42]. Murray Shear[43] similarly conjectured that other investigators had terminated their experiments early, because they thought they were hopelessly “kicking a dead horse”. Another reason for failure was because an insusceptible species had been chosen, since it was not appreciated that most carcinogens are species specific[42]. A further reason for Yamagiwa’s success was that he chose to use many animals, because only seven of 137 rabbits developed cancer, and only two developed metastases.\n\n1950-1980\n\nNumerous notable occupational studies: A strong groundswell of interest in cancer began to emerge in the 1950s and the disease received more systematic study. Some carcinogens were reported which caused very high rates of cancer. Robert Case worked to identify which of the 100s of chemicals used in the dyestuffs industry in England and Wales caused the high rates of bladder cancer among dye workers. Case analyzed the various combinations of chemicals had been used by persons who developed bladder cancer, and after a meticulous analysis, he deduced that 30%-50% of the workers who had long term exposure to β-naphthylamine developed bladder cancer[55]. He also estimated that about 10% of workers exposed to benzidine developed bladder cancer[55].\n\nAnother study reported that seventeen percent of a subset of workers involved in the production of 4-aminobiphenyl, (a chemical that was used as an antioxidant in the rubber industry), developed bladder cancer[56]. Six of eighteen (30%) of workers exposed to bis(chloromethyl)ether, (an important intermediate in the synthesis of organic compounds), were reported to have developed lung cancer after only six years of exposure[57,58]. A similar compound, chloromethyl methyl ether, induced lung cancer in 14 of 91 (15%) of exposed workers[59,60]. Thirty three cases of the extremely rare mesothelioma were reported among the residents of the asbestos mining area of North Western Cape Province in South Africa[61]. Karin is a small village in the Anatolian region of Turkey, which has high deposits of erionite, an asbestos-like mineral, which occurs naturally near the surface of the earth in the region. Erionite is easily cut into large blocks which have been traditionally used for construction of homes and multiple other purposes in the region[62]. Eighty-two of 179 (45.8%) deaths in the village of Karain have been reported to be due to mesothelioma[63,64].\n\nThere were discoveries of additional occupational exposures which cause cancer which were also significant, though less striking. Three cases of a very rare cancer, angiosarcoma of the liver, occurred among workers employed in the manufacture of vinyl chloride[65]. A case series of workers occupationally exposed to benzene, reported a high rate of hemocytoblastic leukemia[66]. The cause of the high rates of lung cancer among miners had been a mystery. Arsenic and cobalt were each been suspected, but during this period, it was deduced that radon emitted from uranium was the principal cause[67]. A follow-up of the British veterans of the 1914-1918 war was published. The report estimated that the veterans who were exposed to mustard gas had a twofold increase in death due to cancers of the lung and pleura over the expected number[68]. Follow-up of the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb explosions of 1945 was published, and it was reported that they had increased rates of leukemia, as well as other types of cancer[69].\n\nThe cigarette smoking and lung cancer controversy: Sophisticated methods for statistical analysis were developed to detect additional causes of cancer during this period. By the mid-1940s, it was evident that the rate of lung cancer was increasing at epidemic proportions, but the cause was unknown. Austin Bradford Hill sought to study medicine, but was unable when he contracted tuberculosis, so he completed a BSc in economics by correspondence while convalescing. Following this, Professor Major Greenwood mentored him in statistical methods[70,71]. Hill developed an interest in formulating mathematical methods to discern the health effects of exposure to chemicals introduced since 1900. He became involved in a committee, which designed a comprehensive epidemiological study to attempt to decipher the cause of the increasing rates of lung cancer[72]. Hill hired Richard Doll, a young physician who preferred to work with mathematics over patients[72]. A case-control study was designed which would investigate the effects of a wide variety of exposures that were new to the 1950s, which included automobile exhaust, road tars, atmospheric pollution, and cigarette smoking[72]. Doll and Hill[72,73] were surprised when their analysis showed that only cigarette smoking was correlated with the incidence of lung cancer. Doll himself was a cigarette smoker, as the harmful effects of smoking were generally unsuspected[74]. They decided to follow up with a prospective trial, in order to test for possible undetected flaws of the case-control study. After 29 mo of follow-up, thirty five lung cancer deaths occurred among 24, 389 men. The highest proportion of lung cancer cases occurred among the heaviest smokers in both the case-control and prospective studies which was interpreted as confirming that smoking was the cause[75]. Numerous other studies of smoking and lung cancer were published both before and after Doll and Hill’s studies, which reported similar results. The studies were reviewed by the Royal College of Physicians of London in Great Britain in 1962[76], the United States Surgeon General in 1964[77] and more recently by Doll[78].\n\nThe studies of smoking and lung cancer were initially received with incredulity by the medical community. Firstly, because smoking was considered a benign activity, with some physicians recommending cigarette smoking because there were suggestions that smoking had various health benefits[74,79,80]. Secondly, the usefulness of mathematics to discern the cause of a disease, was a new discipline and not universally accepted[81-83]. The conventional approach to demonstrate disease causation was experimentation. The controversy concerning whether cigarette smoking causes lung cancer prompted extensive discussions of the criteria to determine whether exposure to an agent causes a disease[81,84], and was the impetus for Hill to develop a seminal list of principles to discern whether epidemiological associations are causal[85]. The smoking and lung cancer controversy contributed strongly to the establishment of modern cancer epidemiology[1].\n\nPharmaceutical studies: Beginning in the late 1960s, pharmaceuticals began to be frequently identified as carcinogens. Users of high doses of analgesic mixtures containing phenacetin were reported to develop high rates of carcinoma of the renal pelvis[86]. Organ transplant recipients, who used the immunosuppressant drug azathioprine, were reported to develop high rates of lymphomas[87]. Studies of women who took diethylstilboestrol during pregnancy revealed that their female children had high rates of the extremely rare adenocarcinoma of the vagina in adulthood[88]. Postmenopausal women, who used estrogen replacement therapy, were reported to have a high risk of developing endometrial cancer[89]. Four of 5 patients who received high cumulative doses (200 g or more) of chlornaphazine, a chemical related to β-naphthylamine for treatment of Hodgkin’s lymphoma, developed invasive bladder carcinomas[90,91].\n\nResearch concerning chemical warfare agents had shown that the sulphur and nitrogen mustards (β-chloroethyl sulphides and amines) exerted strong cytotoxic activity on rapidly proliferating tissue, especially lymphoid tissue, bone marrow and epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract[92]. Subsequently, numerous analogues were developed for use as therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. Melphalan[93], busulfan[94], and cyclophosphamide[95] were each shown to be associated with increased rates of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL).\n\nMedical radioisotopes were also found to be associated with high rates of cancer. Patients suffering polycythaemia vera were treated with radioactive phosphorus (32PO4) during this period. They developed high rates of leukemia[96]. Patients who were administered a contrast medium which contained radioactive thorium, for imaging purposes, developed high rates of the rare angiosarcoma of the liver[97,98]. The use of thorium was curiously preceded, by numerous cautions predicting its probable carcinogenic effects due to its radioactivity[99,100].\n\n1980-present\n\nSophisticated occupational studies: The most obvious agents were already identified in previous periods, so many studies published after 1980 were frequently re-examinations of previously tested agents. Cogliano et al[101] described how the IARC relaxed the criteria which are required to classify agents as carcinogenic during this period. They recounted how agents which lacked epidemiologic evidence of carcinogenicity were permitted to be classified as group 1 carcinogens based only on mechanistic evidence. The author observed that epidemiological studies generally became larger, employed more sophisticated methods of analysis and frequently only reported modest increases.\n\nOrtho-toluidine is an aromatic amine which belongs to the same class of chemicals as β-naphthylamine. It is used in the synthesis of dyes, herbicides, synthetic rubber and other chemicals[102]. Ward et al[103] reported that six of 73 workers exposed to ortho-toluidine for over ten years in a synthetic rubber manufacturing plant developed bladder cancer which yielded a standardized incidence ratio of 27.2.\n\nA study of workers in Vermont granite manufacturing plants, reported that exposure to silica dust was associated with increased rates of lung cancer. A standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 1.81 was reported for workers exposed to silica dust for over 30 years[104]. Exposure to diesel exhaust was also reported to be associated with a higher risk of lung cancer. A cohort of 54973 United States railway workers who were exposed to diesel exhaust for 24.8 years were estimated to have a relative risk of lung cancer of 1.40 based on 4351 lung cancer deaths[105].\n\nSulfuric acid has been used to remove oxides from the surfaces of steel in preparation for painting and other coating processes. Exposures to mists of sulfuric acid have been found to cause laryngeal cancer. A study of 879 steelworkers who were exposed to mists of sulfuric acid for a mean of 9.5 years reported a standardized incidence ratio of 2.30 for laryngeal cancer based on nine cases[106].\n\nExposure to formaldehyde was determined to cause nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) during this period. Eight of 25619 workers succumbed to nasopharyngeal cancer after exposure to formaldehyde for a median of 35 years. A SMR of 2.10 was estimated from this study[107].\n\n1,3-butadiene is a chemical used in the production of synthetic rubbers and polymers, which has been ascertained to cause non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Four of three hundred and sixty-four men involved in 1,3-butadiene production died of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas for a SMR of 5.77[108,109].\n\n2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), is a large complex molecule which occurs as a by-product of some industrial chemical reactions, which has received much media attention as a probable carcinogen. Fingerhut et al[110] conducted a study of mortality among twelve plants in the United States, which produced chemicals contaminated with TCDD. They reported a slight increase in all cancers combined, though the increase was limited to workers with the heaviest exposures to TCDD[110].\n\nTrichloroethylene is a solvent which has been used in the dry cleaning industry and for degreasing metal machine parts that has been determined to cause renal cell cancer. A case-control study from France reported an odds ratio of 1.96 for the development renal cell carcinoma among workers with high cumulative exposure, after adjusting for various factors[111].\n\nEthylene oxide is used mainly as a disinfectant and sterilizing agent in medical facilities for the manufacture of sterile disposable items, which has been determined to cause lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers. The IARC examined the epidemiological evidence concerning exposure to ethylene oxide, and concluded that mortality from lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers were “only marginally elevated”[112].\n\nBeryllium is a metal with a high strength and excellent electrical conductivity which is commonly used in electronics, which has been concluded to cause lung cancer. A study of 689 patients with beryllium lung disease estimated a SMR of 2.0 for the mortality due to lung cancer based on 28 deaths[113]. The IARC has concluded that beryllium is a group 1 carcinogen[114], though various investigators have challenged the conclusion[115].\n\n4,4’-Methylenebis(2-chlorobenzenamine) (MOCA) is a chemical used in the synthesis of some polyurethane products which has been designated as a bladder carcinogen. Screening of 540 workers exposed to MOCA detected two noninvasive papillary tumors of the bladder[116]. The IARC designated MOCA as carcinogenic to humans based on mechanistic rationale[117].\n\nSome of the early nuclear industry personnel in Russia were exposed to high levels of plutonium. However, the reports were originally published in Russian in “classified” reports or journals, which were unavailable to western scientists. The 1990s witnessed a relaxation of this secrecy, and it was reported that workers exposed to high levels of plutonium developed high rates of lung, liver and bone cancers[118,119]. The Chernobyl accident in 1986 resulted in release of iodine-131 into the atmosphere, which was followed by increased rates of childhood thyroid cancers in the nearby areas of Belarus, Russian Federation and the Ukraine[120].\n\nAdditional pharmaceutical studies: Additional pharmaceuticals were identified as carcinogens. Patients who had been treated with MOPP (nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone) for Hodgkin’s disease, were reported to have an increase in ANLL[121]. A randomized trial of polycythemia vera patients reported a thirteen fold increase in ANLL among those receiving the nitrogen mustard drug chlorambucil, which was strongly related to the dosage[122]. A dose-response relationship was reported between the use of the nitrosourea drug semustine and the occurrence of ANLL[123,124]. Patients who were treated with cyclosporine immunosuppressive therapy, developed increased frequencies of lymphoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma and skin cancer[125]. Patients who used tamoxifen were reported to have an increased risk of endometrial cancer[126], but to have a reduced risk of recurrence of breast cancer[127].\n\nEtoposide is a semi-synthetic derivative of an extract of the roots and rhizomes of species of the genus Podophyllin[128]. Ratain et al[129] reported that 4 of 21 lung cancer patients who survived longer than one year, of a chemotherapy regimen which included etoposide, developed ANLL. Thiotepa and treosulfan are alkylating agents used in chemotherapy which have each been shown to increase the risk of various types of leukemia[130-132].\n\nThe use of combined (estrogen/progestin) oral contraceptives was reported to be associated with decreases in ovarian and endometrial cancers[133,134]. Epidemiological studies concerning the association between oral contraceptive use and breast cancer produced inconsistent results which were difficult to interpret. Some studies reported higher rates, others reported lower rates, and still others reported no effect. A reanalysis of 53297 women with breast cancer and 100239 controls from 54 epidemiological studies reported a relative risk of 1.24 (95%CI: 1.15-1.33) among current users, and a relative risk of 1.07 (95%CI: 1.02-1.3) among previous users who discontinued usage for 5-9 years[135].\n\n1980-present\n\nMajor advances in the establishment of the roles of viruses in human cancer occurred during this period for numerous reasons. Laboratory methods were improved which enabled the analysis of much lower levels of viruses. The epidemiological methods which had been developed to evaluate the association of tobacco smoking with lung cancer were revised for analysis of infectious agents with other types of cancer. However each virus presented unique difficulties, as described below.\n\nHuman T-cell leukemia virus: Robert Gallo’s only sibling was diagnosed with leukemia when she was only five years of age, and Robert was eleven. Influenced by his sister’s physician, Gallo enrolled as a medical student in 1960, and studied the biochemistry of blood cells[216]. In 1970, it was discovered that RNA viruses replicate using the reverse transcriptase enzyme[217,218], and Gallo decided to work developing enzyme assays to detect viral reverse transcriptase, as a more sensitive method of detecting possible cancer causing viruses[219] (The EM had become the gold standard, but it was tedious and time consuming).\n\nGallo et al[219] were determined to search for a retroviral cause of human leukemia when other researchers were abandoning the search. They were provoked by the discoveries of a retrovirus which caused leukemia in nonhuman primates[220], and another retrovirus which caused leukemia in cattle[221]. The discovery of the bovine leukemia retrovirus intrigued them because it induced leukemia with only very low levels of replication. They reasoned that human leukemia could have similarly low levels of replication, and therefore be difficult to isolate[210].\n\nThey eventually found a retrovirus in a T-cell line established from a patient with a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which they termed the human T-cell leukemia retrovirus (HTLV-1) in 1980[169,210]. Hinuma et al[222] reported in 1982 that 140 of 142 patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) were positive for the virus from certain areas of Japan. Southern blot analysis showed that all cases contained the virus, and that it was integrated into the host genome in monoclonal form, indicating that infection and integration occurred before clonal expansion of the tumor cells[223]. The discovery of HTLV-1 has been reviewed[210,224,225].\n\nThe virus causes only a particular type of leukemia, which is common in some areas of Japan, but it is rare in the United States. Parkin et al[226] estimated that the global fraction of leukemia due to HTLV-1 is only about 1%, but the principle that viruses could cause human cancer, was finally proven. Convincing evidence that a retrovirus causes common forms of leukemia has still not emerged, though evidence concerning other infectious agents continues to be intriguing[227].\n\nThe mechanism by which HTLV-1 causes leukemia is only partially understood. The virus integrates into the host genome as a component of its regular replication cycle. It is found as a single integrated provirus in around 80% of ATL patients, with the remaining ATL patients displaying either two integration sites or multiple clones[228]. The virus codes for a protein termed Tax, which has multiple effects which are predicted to induce transformation[229]. However, it is perplexing that about 60% of patients with ATL have lost expression of the tax gene[230], so investigators have been searching for another mechanism to account for how HTLV-1 causes ATL. It has been reported that the HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) gene is transcribed in all cases of ATL[231]. HBZ RNA promotes T cell proliferation[231], and transgenic mice which express the HBZ gene in CD4+ cells develop lymphomas[232]. For recent reviews of HTLV-1 replication and ATL see[233,234].\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus: In the summer of 1981, the first reports of a mysterious new syndrome emerged. Young male homosexuals in New York City and California were reported to have phenomenally high rates of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia[235], and unprecedented rates of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS)[236].\n\nThe etiology of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) perplexed the medical community and many bizarre theories were suggested. Max Essex suggested to Gallo that some feline leukemia retrovirus variants caused immunosuppressive syndromes[224,237]. Gallo reasoned that HTLV sometimes caused immunosuppression, and that the geographic distribution of HTLV across Africa resembled the distribution of AIDS in Africa[238]. He wondered if AIDS could be caused by a retrovirus closely related to HTLV. He decided to abandon the search for retroviral causes of human leukemia/lymphoma, in order to investigate whether the cause of AIDS was a retrovirus, and possibly intercept an impending worldwide epidemic[215]. Luc Montagnier et al[239] at the Pasteur institute in France had also been searching for oncogenic human retroviruses, when the AIDS epidemic emerged. Inspired by Gallo’s theory, they decided to redirect their resources to search for a retroviral cause of AIDS as well. Using a reverse transcriptase assay Luc Montagnier and Francois Barre-Sinoussi reported identification of a retrovirus in the lymph node biopsy of a patient in the early stages of AIDS in May of 1983[172].\n\nMontagnier et al[240] reported detection of antibodies to the retrovirus in the serum of 60% of patients with the pre-AIDS lymphadenopathy syndrome, but in only 20% of patients with AIDS, so the significance of their discovery was initially uncertain. Following this, Sarngadharan et al[241] reported that they had developed an improved method to detect antibodies to the virus, and that they found around 90% of cases with AIDS were seropositive in May of 1984. This was followed a few months later by two independent reports of detection of antibodies to the virus in around 90% of patients with AIDS[242,243], which confirmed the virus as the cause of AIDS. Shaw et al[224] also developed a cell line capable of yielding sufficient quantity of the virus to be studied and they produced a commercial blood test for the virus in May of 1984[244]. Montagnier et al[245] reported development of a comparable method of production of the virus in July of 1984, and a reliable method to detect antibodies in Oct of 1984[246]. Of course the virus was later termed the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n\nLuc Montagnier and Francoise Barre-Sinoussi received the prestigious Nobel Prize for their identification of the virus in 2008 (http://nobelprize.org). A succinct review of the chronology of events concerning the discovery of HIV has been published[247]. Gallo and Montagnier have both written detailed accounts of their personal reflections of this period[248,249]. Robin Weiss has also written a concise informative review of the discovery of HIV[250].\n\nAround 50% of patients diagnosed with AIDS, were also diagnosed with KS at the time of their AIDS diagnosis in the early 1980s[251,252], which would seem to be unequivocal proof that HIV causes KS. However, KS cells were found to be curiously not infected with HIV[253]. Large trials also demonstrated that non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma occurred in around 4% of patients with AIDS at the time of their diagnosis, and is the second most common cancer among AIDS patients[254]. However, B cells of AIDS related lymphomas have also been reported to be devoid of the virus[255,256].\n\nThe mechanism of how HIV causes cancers is not straightforward. The virus infects T cells and macrophages which release an HIV encoded protein known as Tat, which is taken up by other cell types in the microenvironment. Tat has numerous effects which are also predicted to promote angiogenesis and carcinogenesis[257-259]. It appears that immunosuppression caused by HIV is a potent cofactor in KS and lymphomas, rather than a cause of these cancers, since they also occur at increased rates in transplant patients [Also see the discussion of human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) below for additional discussion of KS].\n\nThe IARC concluded in 2012 that HIV causes not only Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but also Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and cancers of the cervix, anus, and conjunctiva[260].\n\nHBV: Baruch Blumberg was formally educated as a physician in the United States, and relates that his education left him “woefully ignorant about viruses”[261,262]. In the early 1960s he was searching for genetic polymorphisms which could account for differences among individuals in their susceptibility to diverse diseases. Harvey Alter was assisting him in this, when they found a precipitin in a serum which they were hoping was caused by a genetic polymorphism[167,263]. Following this, Blumberg became intensely interested in studying every detail about the precipitin. After many months of study, they noticed that a couple of patients who were negative for the antigen became positive, and that the patients coincidentally developed hepatitis[264-266]. Blumberg collaborated with some experienced electron microscopists and reported visualization of small particles in the serum of the patients which were later identified as the surface antigen of HBV[267].\n\nIt was not evident that HBV caused hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when it was discovered. The geographical correlation between the distributions of the rates of HBV infection and HCC became recognized a decade after the discovery of the antigen[268]. However, aflatoxin had been previously demonstrated to induce liver cancers in rodents[269] and it was proven to cause liver cancers in primates as well[270], so aflatoxin seemed more likely to be the cause of HCC in humans. Furthermore, serum antigens of the virus were not reproducibly detectable at the time of diagnosis of HCC using the methods that were available in the 1970s[271,272]. Moreover, viral antigens were only present at much reduced levels in the tumor tissue compared to the surrounding normal liver tisue[273-275]. In spite of this evidence, Robert Beasley was determined to definitively test whether HBV caused HCC. He decided to study a healthy population without HCC, and to test them for serum HBV antigens using newly developed and highly sensitive radioimmunoassay techniques. He devised to follow subjects prospectively to determine which individuals developed HCC. It was difficult to get funding for a large study when the evidence seemed to indicate that aflatoxin was the cause of liver cancer. He recruited 22707 healthy male government employees in Taiwan, and tested them for a variety of indicators of HBV infection[170]. After three years of follow-up, forty one deaths due to HCC occurred. Only 15% of the employees were seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), but forty of the 41 men who developed HCC were seropositive for the antigen. The relative risk of HCC among men who were seropositive for HBsAg was calculated to be 223 (95%CI: 28-1479)[170]. This was evidence which could not be dismissed[276]. Vaccination of Taiwanese children has resulted in a pronounced decrease in the incidence of childhood HCC[277,278], which is confirmation that HBV causes HCC.\n\nWhile epidemiological studies have provided convincing evidence that HBV causes HCC, investigations of the mechanisms of how it causes cancer have been less straightforward. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed, which can be divided into three general categories; viral proteins, inflammation and genetic instability. The virus produces oncogenic proteins; HBsAg and HBx have received the most intensive investigations. Mice which are transgenic for HBsAg or HBx have been reported to develop liver cancers[279,280]. The second general mechanism involves the immune response to the virus which results in a state of chronic inflammation, which produces cirrhosis that deteriorates into HCC[281,282]. The third general mechanism involves the integration of the virus into the host genome, which generates genetic instability. The normal replication cycle of HBV does not include integration into the host cell genome. However, the virus has been found integrated into the host cell genome in around 80% of HCC cases associated with HBV[283]. The integrated virus is fragmented and rearranged, so that it cannot produce infectious particles[284-286]. However, the integrated virus is attributed to induce chromosomal instability of the host cell[287]. Each of these mechanisms likely causes a few cases of HCC, with most cases involving two or all three of the above mechanisms. Cases of HCC which develop without cirrhosis are caused by viral integration and viral proteins. Cases which develop without viral integration are caused by inflammation/cirrhosis and viral proteins.\n\nHuman papillomavirus: Harold zur Hausen was intrigued by the fact that epidemiological evidence indicated that the risk of cervical cancer was correlated with sexual promiscuity, which suggested an infectious cause[288,289]. Herpes simplex virus type 2 seemed like a plausible agent, so he analyzed cervical cancer biopsies for the virus. However, the samples were found to be devoid of the virus, so he decided to investigate papillomaviruses[289]. The early methods of analysis for human papillomavirus (HPV) were crude and did not produce convincing evidence of a causal role. In the mid-1970s recombinant DNA technology was developed, and zur Hausen’s group used the technology to sequence the virus. They discovered that the HPV exists as a variety of different types[290,291]. They identified HPV-16 and HPV-18 in cervical cancer biopsies[171,292]. Following this, the early epidemiological studies still did not consistently identify HPV DNA in cervical cancers, because the methods of analysis of HPV DNA varied substantially in sensitivity and specificity[293,294]. As the sensitivity of the techniques increased, HPV DNA became detectable in 97%-98% of cervical cancer biopsies[295,296].\n\nHPV-16 and HPV-18 produce a number of proteins (E5, E6, and E7) which have various oncogenic activities[297,298]. E6 induces chromosomal instability by binding to the tumor suppressor protein p53, interfering with its normal function and inducing its degradation[299]. E7 also induces chromosomal instability by interfering with the normal functioning of the retinoblastoma family of proteins and inducing their degradation[300,301]. HPV replicates as an episome, in a cycle that does not involve integration into the host’s cell genome[302]. However, the virus has been frequently found integrated into the host cell’s genome. It is not known precisely how the virus becomes integrated, but it likely results when DNA breaks occur, which are likely promoted by episomal E6 and E7[303,304]. The integrated virus is found in a truncated form, though E6 and E7 usually remain intact, and continue to be transcribed. Numerous reports have found that E6 and E7 are transcribed at higher levels when it is integrated into the host genome[305], and the proteins produced by the integrated virus may have increased stability[306]. Studies which have analyzed the frequencies of integration in premalignant and invasive cancers have consistently reported higher rates of integration among invasive cancers[307,308]. It has also been consistently reported that the infectious episomal form of the virus is detected less frequently in invasive cancers than in premalignant lesions[308].\n\nRecent prospective cohort studies have reported strong associations among women in whom HPV was detected on multiple occasions, which is consistent with cervical cancer developing from persistent infections. Analysis of ten years of follow-up of a cohort in Copenhagen, reported that 13.6% (167/1229) of women who were positive for high risk HPV at enrolment developed high grade lesions (severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ), while 20.0% (83/414) of women who tested positive at enrolment and tested positive again two years later developed high grade lesions[309].\n\nConfirmation of the causative role of HPV in cervical cancer is expected to emerge, with the successful clinical trials of vaccines for HPV. Vaccine efficacy for a bivalent vaccine (HPV 16, 18) was tested in over 10000 HPV naïve women who were followed for 4 years. The efficacy was 64.9% (95%CI: 52.7-74.2) for protection against CIN2 irrespective of HPV DNA in the lesion, and 93.2% (95%CI: 78.9-98.7) for prevention of CIN3 irrespective of HPV DNA in the lesion. Seven cases of adenocarcinoma in situ occurred in the unvaccinated controls, whereas zero cases occurred in the vaccinated women[310]. Results of the efficacy of HPV vaccination against cervical cancer are expected to emerge in 5-10 years[311].\n\nInitial studies with HPV focussed on identification of the cause of cervical cancer. Further studies have shown that mucosotrophic HPV types also cause cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis, oropharynx, oral cavity, and tonsil[312,313]. Zur Hausen was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work with HPV in 2008 (http://nobelprize.org). Robin Weiss has written a concise reflection of zur Hausen’s work[250].\n\nHepatitis C virus: After the discoveries of HAV and HBV, it was found that most cases of transfusion associated hepatitis were caused by neither HAV nor HBV[314]. A non-A non-B (NANB) infectious agent was suspected of causing transfusion associated hepatitis. The NANB infectious agent was also suspected of causing HCC, based on case reports of transfusion recipients who developed chronic hepatitis, which progressed to cirrhosis, and then HCC[315,316]. However, the identification of hepatitis C virus (HCV) was excruciatingly difficult. The NANB hepatitis agent could be transmitted to chimpanzees; however efforts to isolate the virus using traditional methods, based on antigens and antibodies were without success for over fifteen years. Numerous tests were published, but none could be confirmed by independent laboratories[317,318]. The results were so perplexing and inconsistent, that it was speculated that the agent might only be present at very low levels[318], and/or the immune response could be very weak and therefore difficult to identify[318,319].\n\nFinally, a massive systematic search was initiated by Michael Houghton et al[320] at the Chiron Corporation together with Daniel Bradley at the Centers for Disease Control. Their approach was to clone the agent before isolating it, using a “blind” immunoassay. The identification began in the early 1980s, and utilized the recombinant DNA techniques which had been recently developed. Michael Houghton et al[320] searched intensely for the elusive NANB hepatitis agent(s), using many different approaches to screen hundreds of millions of cDNA clones. After seven years, they identified the elusive agent, as a single stranded RNA molecule of about 10000 nucleotides, and termed it HCV[173]. Choo et al[321] have written a detailed review of the discovery of HCV.\n\nAfter the identification of the clone, the development of an ELISA test for the detection of circulating antibodies was promptly published[322], and many reports of high rates of detection of antibodies to HCV in the serum of patients with HCC soon followed[323,324].\n\nHCV is considered to cause HCC, though conclusive proof has been elusive. HCV induced HCC evolves through a progression of chronic hepatitis, to cirrhosis, to HCC which generally requires 20-30 years, or longer to develop, so prospective trials have been few. A meta-analysis of HCV positive cirrhotics reported that 17%-30% of patients developed HCC over five years of observation[325]. An eleven year prospective study followed 925 patients with antibodies to HCV. They reported a cumulative risk of HCC of 1.1% among those with undetectable HCV RNA levels and 14.7% among those with the high serum levels of HCV RNA[326].\n\nConfirmation that HCV causes HCC has also been elusive. Treatment of HCV infection with α-interferon (or α-interferon plus ribavirin) results in decreased rates of HCC[327]. However, the demonstration that α-interferon reduces the incidence of HCC is complicated by the evidence that α-interferon has anti-carcinogenic effects independent of its antiviral effects[328-330]. A meta-analysis by Kimer et al[331] reported that the rate of HCC was reduced in both sustained virological responders [risk ratio (RR) = 0.15, 95%CI: 0.05-0.45] and also in non-responders (RR = 0.57, 95%CI: 0.37-0.85). The improved prognosis among non-responders is consistent with α-interferon having an anti-carcinogenic effect in addition to its anti-viral effect. Interferon-free treatment regimens are very recently becoming widely prescribed[332], so the long term effect of viral clearance by these treatments should provide a definitive confirmation of the causative role of HCV in HCC.\n\nHCV has an interesting and complex life cycle. The virus replicates using an error prone polymerase which lacks proofreading activity. Consequently, HCV circulates in an individual as a heterogeneous population of sequences or quasispecies, which is very complex for the immune system to clear[333]. A systematic review estimated that 75% of individuals fail to eradicate the virus, because their immune response is only partially effective[334]. The principal mechanism by which HCV causes HCC is considered to be the chronic immune inflammatory response[335]. Around 40% of patients with chronic HCV develop cirrhosis after 30 years[336]. While HCC develops mostly among cirrhotics, it also develops at low rates among patients devoid of cirrhosis[337], which is interpreted as evidence that the virus may possess some directly carcinogenic effects. The virus replicates in the cytoplasm and does not integrate into the host genome as a component of its replication cycle or incidentally, unlike some of the viruses discussed above."
