        "text": "#TBT The Last Home Game I Missed\n\nI'm going to be a little selfish tonight with my Throw Back Thursday. This weekend I'll be coaching my son's soccer team at 5:25pm on Sunday. What that means is that for the first time in almost 10 years I'll be missing a Sporting KC/KC Wizards home game. Come Sunday, it will be 3,600 days since I last missed a KC home game, a 3-0 win over the expansion (and now defunct) Chivas USA on June 25th, 2005.\n\nKC scored all three of their goals in the second half, with Jimmy Conrad starting things off with a goal just after half time. Davy Arnaud doubled the lead in the 70th minute, before Sasha Victorine finished things off in the 85th minute in front of over 13,000 people, many of them Chivas Guadalajara fans who attended Chivas USA games in away cities over the team's first few years. Sadly there don't appear to be any highlights online that I can find now to share about the game.\n\nI missed that game because at the time I was on my honeymoon after getting married. Since then, my wife has put up with me being gone to Wizards and Sporting games whenever the team is at home, and many times when they were away and I traveled as well.\n\nOver these almost 10 years, I've seen KC go from being on the selling block to seeing the team be one of the envies of the league. I've gone from seeing games played in front of announced crowds four to five thousand at Arrowhead to sold out crowds of over 20,000 at Sporting Park. I've seen the team struggle at the beginning of seasons (2011) and end of seasons (2005). I've seen greats like Preki and Jimmy Nielsen retire from the game, I've seen the beginning of great careers like Roger Espinoza, Matt Besler and Graham Zusi start in KC.\n\nDuring this string of games I've seen 156 league games, and 186 games in all competitions since the middle of the 2005 season. KC has gone 71-39-46 at home over that time frame in league play, averaging 1.66 points per game, scoring 239 goals while conceding 173. In all competitions I've seen KC play 186 games going 88-46-52 scoring 293 goals and allowing 202.\n\nWell here's to starting another 10 year run, and go Orange Smash on Sunday!\n\nJuliao Loaned Again - Former SKC Wizards Update\n\nFormer Sporting KC defender, Igor Juliao is going on loan from parent club Fluminense again. But this time he will not be leaving Brazil. Juliao has been loaned to Brazilian club ABC, which plays in the Brazilian Serie B. Since returning to Fluminense after the 2014 MLS season, he'd been unable to beak into the team at Fluminense, just making the bench a couple times.\n\nHere's the rest of this week's update.\n\nActive without a club or unknown\n\nFederico Bessone\n\nBobby Convey\n\nMechack Jerome\n\nWill John\n\nMichael Kafari\n\nNeal Kitson\n\nJonathan Leathers\n\nCarlos Marinelli\n\nNelson Pizarro\n\nIvan Trujillo\n\nKonrad Warzycha\n\nMLS\n\nDavy Arnaud - DC - Did not dress in DC's 2-1 win over Vancouver.\n\nTeal Bunbury - New England - Started and played 68 minutes in New England's 4-0 win over Salt Lake.\n\nAurelien Collin - Orlando City - Started and played 90 minutes in Orlando's 2-0 loss to Toronto.\n\nLuis Gil - Salt Lake - Started and played 90 minutes in RSL's 4-0 loss to New England.\n\nMichael Harrington - Colorado - Started and played 90 minutes in Colorado's 1-1 draw with Dallas.\n\nJack Jewsbury - Portland - Started and played 90 minutes in Portland's 1-0 loss to Seattle.\n\nEddie Johnson - DC - Out on leave.\n\nKei Kamara - Columbus - Started and played 77 minutes, getting a goal and an assist in Columbus' 4-1 win over Philadelphia.\n\nChris Konopka - Toronto - Dressed but did not play in Toronto's 2-0 win over Orlando.\n\nEric Kronberg - Montreal - Not eligible for Montreal's CCL game.\n\nCJ Sapong - Philadelphia - Started and played 90 minutes, recording an assist in Philadelphia's 4-1 loss to Columbus.\n\nKhari Stephenson - San Jose - No game this week.\n\nTyson Wahl - Columbus - Came off the bench and played 34 minutes in Columbus' 4-1 win over Philadelphia.\n\nSal Zizzo - New York - Started and played 75 minutes in New York's 1-1 draw with LA.\n\nNASL\n\nStefan Antonijevic - Tampa Bay - Started and played 90 minutes in Tampa Bay's 3-2 win over Jacksonville.\n\nJames Marcelin - Fort Lauderdale - Did not dress in Fort Lauderdale's 3-1 win over Ottawa.\n\nRauwshan McKenzie - Atlanta - Started and played 90 minutes in Atlanta's 0-0 draw with New York.\n\nKyle Miller - Atlanta - Started and played 90 minutes in Atlanta's 0-0 draw with New York.\n\nUSL\n\nChristian Duke - Oklahoma City - Did not dress in OKC's 2-1 loss to St. Louis.\n\nBrian Fekete - Austin - Came off the bench and played 31 minutes in Austin's 1-0 win over Colorado Springs.\n\nAdnan Gabeljic - Sacramento - No game this week.\n\nCyprian Hedrick - Oklahoma City - Started and played 81 minutes in OKC's 2-1 loss to St. Louis.\n\nEric Kronberg - Montreal (loan) - Started and played 90 minutes in Montreal's 1-0 loss to Richmond.\n\nAlex Martinez - Charlotte - Started and played 90 minutes in Charlotte's 1-1 draw with Harrisburg.\n\nVictor Munoz - Arizona - Did not play in Arizona's 2-0 loss to Portland.\n\nTony Rocha - Austin - Came off the bench and played 9 minutes in Austin's 1-0 win over Colorado Springs.\n\nMichael Thomas - Oklahoma City - Started and played 90 minutes in OKC's 2-1 loss to St. Louis.\n\nYomby William - Richmond - Started and played 90 minutes in Richmond's 1-0 win over New York.

It was a roller coaster throughout, from the highs of an early lead through Krisztian Nemeth, to giving up three straight, to KC clawing their way back only to fall back behind, to finally ending up level thanks to an amazing strike by Benny Feilhaber. It wasn't the best game that KC played, marred by defensive mistakes, goalkeeper mistakes, and missed chances, but for the neutral, it would have been a fun game to watch.\n\nKC was able to jump out to an early lead against the Dynamo thanks to Nemeth. A give away at midfield led to Nemeth leading a counter the other direction. Nemeth dribbled in on Raul Rodriguez, causing the Dynamo defender to back pedal. Near the top of the box Nemeth fired a shot into the far corner that beat Tyler Deric and gave KC the 1-0 lead early. The lead didn't last too long though as the Dynamo equalized in the 11th minute. A throw-in by Brad Davis wasn't handled by Will Bruin, the ball fell to Matt Besler whose attempted clearance went off of Servando Carrasco into the path of Giles Barnes who made no mistake firing the ball past Luis Marin and into the net tying the game at 1-1. From there, KC continued to have the better of the early going, but could not retake the lead. Dom Dwyer had two fantastic chances, once being set up by Jalil Anibaba, and the second coming from a fantastic ball from Feilhaber who played a call that was just out of reach of Deric, but Dwyer couldn't turn the effort on goal and it went wide. The earlier misses came back to haunt KC as the Dynamo came back and for the final 25 minutes of the half controlled play. They were helped by some very poor distribution by Luis Marin in KC's goal as he gave up a number of throw ins by kicking the ball directly out of bounds. Late in the half some more poor distribution by Marin led to another goal. After Marin misplayed a goal kick and it ended up leading to a Dynamo corner, Brad Davis played a great ball into the box that Will Bruin flicked on and into the net past Marin to give the Dynamo a 2-1 lead as they headed into the half time break.\n\nThings got worse for KC less than a minute into the second half. Barnes picked up a pass near midfield with no one around him and turned and raced up field. No one stepped up to shut down his run and from about 30 yards out he let fly with a shot that went inside the near corner for a goal to put the Dynamo up 3-1. Like with the distribution earlier, questions have to be asked of Marin's positioning and his dive, as it immediately brought back memories of the goal Jermaine Jones scored on Eric Kronberg at Sporting Park last year. After the goal, the Dynamo started to sit back more, looking to focus on their strong defense, the Dynamo looked to just contain KC's attack. KC still had their chances though and should have pulled a goal back when Nemeth was played through on goal by Roger Espinoza. One on one with Deric though, Nemeth couldn't round the Houston goalkeeper and put the shot wide of the goal. The Dynamo's defense did it's job until the 74th minute when a mistake by Barnes gave KC a way back into the game. Being chased backward by Espinoza, Barnes tried to play a ball across the back towards Deric, but Dwyer read the pass and got to the ball first, touching it by Deric. The Houston keeper brought Dwyer down in the process, but Dwyer quickly got back to his feet and tapped the ball into the empty net to make it 3-2. Now within a goal, KC threw numbers forward looking for the equalizer. And within a couple minutes of the goal, they had two penalty shouts, both courtesy of Nemeth. First, Nemeth was brought down in the box by a Dynamo defender, but referee Kevin Stott didn't even look twice. Then less than a minute later in the 77th, KC again came forward and again just outside the box the ball ended up at the feet of Nemeth. The Hungarian cut inside his defender and around another before trying to put a shot past Deric. Dynamo defender Jermaine Taylor got back though and knocked the ball away with his chest, although there were immediately shouts of a hand ball. Stott put his whistle in his mouth, but allowed play to continue as the ball fell to Dwyer who tried to back heel the ball into the net, eventually Deric collected the loose ball in the box, at which point Stott called the play back and gave the penalty kick for a hand ball on Taylor. The Dynamo defender also was given a red card for the hand ball. Replays showed that the ball had in fact hit Taylor's chest and no call should have been made. Feilhaber though stepped up to take the PK and slotted it into the corner to tie the game at 3-3 and with a man advantage, thoughts turned from the poor performance and stopping the bleeding to thoughts of actually taking all three points from the game.\n\nUnfortunately those thoughts were dashed minutes later when the Dynamo won a free kick in KC's half. Brad Davis played the ball into the box where Raul Rodriguez beat Matt Besler to the ball and headed it past Marin and into the net to put the Dynamo back on top. Down a man, the Dynamo again sat back as Sporting KC attacked looking for another equalizer. In the 5th minute of stoppage time they again found it, and again Feilhaber was the hero. The ball got played wide to Dwyer who tried to cross the ball into the middle of the box, but his cross was deflected on it's way through and floated towards the top of the box where Graham Zusi was, Zusi played a cushioned header right into the path of Feilhaber who let the ball bounce a couple times before firing a laser of a shot right into the post at Deric's left side, tying the game at 4-4 as both teams took a point from the game.\n\nWizards Man of the Match - Benny Feilhaber - Him and Ike Opara had been the best players on KC since the start of the season. With Opara out, Feilhaber has continued to play strong and was fantastic for KC last night. Better finishing by Dwyer would have seen him get an assist in the first half, tied the game once from the penalty spot, and his blast in second half stoppage time secured a point.\n\nPlayer Ratings: Marin 2, de Jong 3, Besler 4, Ellis 3, Anibaba 4, Carrasco 4, Espinoza 5, Feilhaber 8, Zusi 6, Dwyer 5, Nemeth 6. Subs Mustivar 5, Dia 5, Hallisey NR.\n\nMatch Day 8: Renewing Another Rivalry\n\nSporting KC will renew another of their rivalries tomorrow night against the Houston Dynamo at BBVA Compass Stadium. Since Houston moved to the Eastern Conference in 2011, these two teams have met in the playoffs three of the last four seasons. Including a US Open Cup qualifier back in 2011, tomorrow's meeting will be the 17th meeting between the two teams since that time. Making it one of the most played rivalries of the last five years.\n\nHouston comes into the game with the exact same 2-2-3 record that KC has, the only difference is the goals each team has scored an conceded. While KC has scored seven and conceded eight, the Dynamo have scored six, but given up a league low of four. Their defense has been very good, as Tyler Deric has recorded three shutouts for the Dynamo. In the other seven games, Houston has yet to allow more than a single goal. Not great news for a KC offense that continues to struggle to create chances in the run of play. Offensively though the Dynamo have struggled more than KC has. The Dynamo have six goals, but three of those came in one game against a Montreal Impact side that was focused on the Champions League. So while the defense is playing extremely well, outside of one game, the Dynamo haven't been lighting things up offensively.\n\nThat might be exactly what the Kansas City defense needs to get their feet back under them after the loss of Ike Opara. The defense was shaky at the start of last week's game against LA, but settled down and bent but didn't break until second half stoppage time when Omar Gonzalez scored the winner. The defense will still need to account for the likes of Giles Barnes, who has caused KC issues in the past. Offensively though this is going to be another game that I have a feeling will really frustrate the KC offense.\n\nMarin\n\nAnibaba - Ellis - Besler - de Jong\n\nCarrasco\n\nFeilhaber - Espinoza\n\nNemeth - Dyer - Zusi\n\nNumber to Remember - 0 - That's the number of goals that Houston has scored the last two years in all competitions at BBVA against KC. In the three games, KC is 2-0-1, winning the two regular season games 1-0 and 2-0, while drawing 0-0 in the 2013 Conference Finals.\n\nKey Match Up - Benny Feilhaber vs Ricardo Clark - The MLS leader in assists will have a difficult match up against the former US international Clark, who has been having himself a very good season for the Dynamo, including scoring two goals to be tied for the team lead. Feilhaber has arguably been KC's best player (easier to argue for it now with Opara out). For KC to be successful tomorrow, Feilhaber is gonna need to win this battle.\n\nPREDICTION - The way both teams are playing right now, this is going to be a low scoring, fairly unattractive game. Neither team has been able to have much success on the offensive side of the ball. And while KC's defense hasn't been playing great, their offense, especially without Oscar Boniek Garcia. If there is any scoring, I expect the game to be decided by just one goal. But I'm not sure we see it.\n\nSKC - 0\n\nHOU - 0\n\n#TBT Best Comeback Ever\n\nA couple weeks ago, Sporting Kansas City scored two goals in stoppage against the Philadelphia Union to turn a 2-1 deficit into a 3-2 win at Sporting Park. At the time the question was asked whether or not that was the greatest comeback for Kansas City all time. At the time I said it wasn't, and I still believe that. Instead, the greatest comeback in the team's history came against this weekend's opponent, the Houston Dynamo back in 2010.\n\nAt the time, Kansas City had never defeated the Dynamo in Kansas City since Houston had moved from San Jose ahead of the 2006 season. When the Dynamo came to Kansas City in late September in 2010, KC was trying to get back to the playoffs for the third straight year, having fired head coach Curt Onalfo two months earlier. To keep their hopes alive, KC desperately needed the win over the Dynamo, who were set to miss the playoffs for the first time since moving.\n\nThe Dynamo though grabbed the early lead as in the 13th minute, Cam Weaver was able to get in front of Roger Espinoza and slide a shot past Jimmy Nielsen and into the net giving Houston the lead. Shortly after that, Kei Kamara should have equalized as he got played in alone with Pat Onstad in the box, but Kamara hit the post keeping the score at 1-0. That miss came back to haunt KC in the 33rd. On a clearance into the middle of the field, Jimmy Conrad stepped up to challenge Weaver for the ball. Conrad left Dominic Oduro to do that, but Weaver won the header. Conrad's center back partner, Shavar Thomas didn't slide over to cover Oduro who was able to race in on goal and put the ball past Nielsen and into the net to make it 2-0. Kansas City responded immediately to going down 2-0 though as Craig Rocastle picked out Kamara and this time he made no mistake burying his effort past Onstad to make it 2-1. Unfortunately, Houston did the same to KC. After a foul in KC's end that appeared to be actually on Houston was called on KC, the ball was played into the box where Thomas' attempted clearance when right into the path of Adrian Serioux who knocked the ball into the net. The Dynamo went into the half with the 3-1 lead.\n\nAt half time, KC brought on rookie Teal Bunbury in place of Birahim Diop, and a new effort saw KC have the better of the start of the second half. In the 60th minute, Bunbury took advantage of a mistake by Onstad. The Dynamo goalkeeper slipped on a goal kick playing it directly toward Bunbury who reacted first and raced in on Onstad and slotted the ball between Onstad's legs to get KC within a goal again. KC continued to pressure, looking for the equalizer and in the 71st minute found it. The ball got played wide to Michael Harrington who beat his man 1v1 before crossing into the box towards Ryan Smith, who one timed it with his right foot. The ball deflected off Serioux and into the net tying the game at 3-3. As the minutes ticked off, it looked like KC would come all the way back, but in second half stoppage time, Nielsen cleared a ball well up field into the path of Harrington who had raced into the offensive end. Harrington one timed a ball into the box where Josh Wolff met it and flicked the header into the far post to give Kansas City the 4-3 lead and the win over the Dynamo.\n\nFor me it's the greater comeback because of the situation that KC was in at the time needing a win really to keep their playoff hopes alive (even if they didn't make it). Also because of the futility I felt at half time after watching the team down 3-1. Against the Union, while KC was down, Philadelphia wasn't playing well at all and goals were certainly there for KC, against Houston at the time I just didn't feel it.\n\nGomez and Puebla Win Copa MX - Former SKC Wizards Update\n\nMexican club, Puebla may be relegated this year, but they'll go down as Copa MX champions. This week, Herculez Gomez and his club Puebla won the cup competition in Mexico with a 4-2 win over Chivas. Gomez was an unused sub for Puebla in the game as they jumped out to a 2-0 lead before Chivas came back to tie at 2-2 before Puebla scored two more to win 4-2.\n\nHere's the rest of this week's update.\n\nActive without a club or unknown\n\nFederico Bessone\n\nBobby Convey\n\nMechack Jerome\n\nWill John\n\nMichael Kafari\n\nNeal Kitson\n\nJonathan Leathers\n\nCarlos Marinelli\n\nNelson Pizarro\n\nIvan Trujillo\n\nKonrad Warzycha\n\nMLS\n\nDavy Arnaud - DC - Started and played 90 minutes in DC's 1-1 draw with Houston.\n\nTeal Bunbury - New England - Came off the bench and played 29 minutes, getting a goal and an assist in New England's 2-1 win over Philadelphia.\n\nAurelien Collin - Orlando City - Started and played 90 minutes in Orlando's 3-0 loss to Columbus.\n\nLuis Gil - Salt Lake - Started and played 90 minutes in RSL's 1-0 loss to Vancouver.\n\nMichael Harrington - Colorado - Started and played 90 minutes in Colorado's 3-1 loss to Seattle.\n\nJack Jewsbury - Portland - Started and playd 90 minutes in Portland's 1-0 win over NYCFC.\n\nEddie Johnson - DC - Out on leave.\n\nKei Kamara - Columbus - Started and played 90 minutes, scoring a goal and getting an assist in Columbus' 3-0 win over Orlando.\n\nChris Konopka - Toronto - Dressed but did not play in Toronto's 3-2 loss to Toronto.\n\nEric Kronberg - Montreal - No game this week.\n\nCJ Sapong - Philadelphia - Came off the bench and played 32 minutes, scoring a goal in Philadelphi's 1-1 draw with NYCFC.

For most of the second 45 it looked like they'd just be able to hang on to that one point, but in stoppage time, KC was crushed by a late goal by substitute Omar Gonzalez as Sporting KC fell 2-1 to the defending MLS Cup champion LA Galaxy.\n\nKC's defense look out of sorts from the start last night struggling to deal with the Galaxy's attack early on. KC paid for it in the 9th minute. A cross field ball by Juninho found Stefan Ishizaki on KC's left side. Ishizaki brought the ball down and dribbled at Marcel de Jong 1v1. Ishizaki turned de Jong and fired a shot on goal. Luis Marin got down and made the save, but only pushed the rebound into the path of the unmarked Baggio Husidic, who knocked the ball into the empty net giving LA the lead. Teenager, Bradford Jamieson caused all sorts of problems for KC with his speed. Twice he was going 1v1 with KC's center backs, but both times Matt Besler and Kevin Ellis were eventually able to stand up the U20 international.\n\nKC found a way back into the game in the 22nd minute, completely against the run of play. Dom Dwyer collected a long ball deep in the Galaxy's end. Dwyer dribbled inside to the top of the box before sliding a ball through to Benny Feilhaber. Feilhaber immediately touched the ball to Krisztian Nemeth who had made a run into the box, Nemeth took a touch and then chipped the ball over Jaime Penedo and into the net to tie the game at 1-1. After the goal Kansas City started to look a lot more dangerous offensive, getting more of the ball and putting more pressure on the Galaxy back line. Marcel de Jong created two of KC's better chances, first in the 35th with a long run and firing a shot from near the corner of the box. The ball took a deflection on the way through, but Penedo adjusted well and was able to get a hand to it and the rebound was cleared. Minutes later, de Jong had another opportunity in a similar situation, but his shot skimmed the outside of the post and went out.\n\nAfter the way the first half ended with KC on the front foot, there was a level of confidence heading into the second half that KC could come out and possibly steal all three points in the game. Unfortunately things didn't work out that way in the second half. LA came out and started taking the game to Kansas City again, keeping KC's offense from really getting involved in the play. KC's best chance of the second half came in the 68th minute after some good work down the week the ball was played into the middle for Dwyer near the penalty spot. Dwyer's shot though was well over the bar. Much of the half though LA controlled, Juninho forced a save out of Marin on a shot from distance in the 72nd. KC's defense was bending but not breaking as the game came to a conclusion, even with an injury forcing Vermes to substitute de Jong for Amadou Dia. Late in stoppage time though LA found their deserved winner as a corner from Juninho was sent towards Gonzalez at the back post where he'd beaten Anibaba to the ball, getting a leg on it. His shot was headed towards goal, but deflected off Bernardo Anor as Marin dove; the deflection sent the ball the opposite direction and into the net as Marin dove the other way giving the Galaxy a late win.\n\nWizards Man of the Match - Krisztian Nemeth - A well taken finish by Nemeth after some good interchange, between Dwyer and Feilhaber. Overall though there really wasn't anyone that stood out as deserving the award that much over anyone else.\n\nPlayer Ratings - Marin 4, de Jong 4, Besler 4, Ellis 4, Anibaba 4, Carrasco 4, Espinoza 3, Feilhaber 5, Zusi 4, Dwyer 3, Nemeth 5. Subs Dia 4, Anor 3, Peterson NR.\n\nMatch Day 7: Sporting Head to the West Coast\n\nFor the first time this season, Sporting KC is headed to the West Coast as a member of the Western Conference as they take on the LA Galaxy. The two teams will meet for the 54th time in regular season play, the most games that KC has played against any team in league play.\n\nThe Galaxy come into the game having ended their two game losing streak last week against the Seattle Sounders. They ended a scoreless run of over 200 minutes in the 1-0 win over the Sounders, doing so without captain Robbie Keane in the lineup for the game. Keane is still questionable for the game tomorrow and his absence would be a bonus for a KC back line that is in a bit of flux right now. They'll also have two of their starters returning from San Antonio where Omar Gonzalez and Gyasi Zardes both started and played 90 minutes for the US in the 2-0 win over Mexico. With them playing 90 minutes and flying back to LA, the two may be a little fatigued for this weekend's game.\n\nMeanwhile, the question on KC's national team call up, Matt Besler, is his health. Kansas City's captain sat out the friendly against Mexico with an illness. With KC's other issues in defense, I'd expect Besler to be in the lineup tomorrow night. The rest of KC's defense is limited at the moment as Erik Palmer-Brown was called up by the US U20 team and will not be available, Seth Sinovic is questionable with a groin injury that kept him out of last week's game, and then there's the long term injury to Ike Opara. With all of that, KC will only have five defenders available for tomorrow's game with Besler being joined by Marcel de Jong, Kevin Ellis, Jalil Anibaba, and Amadou Dia. The big question is who replaces Opara in the middle of defense. My feeling is that Peter Vermes will change as little as possible about the team that played against Salt Lake last week. That means inserting Ellis into the center of defense with Besler while Anibaba stays out wide right. The only other change that I could see from the lineup against RSL is if Graham Zusi is ready to return from his hamstring injury. If he's ready to go he slots right back into the lineup in place of Jacob Peterson on the wing.\n\nMarin\n\nAnibaba - Ellis - Besler - de Jong\n\nCarrasco\n\nFeilhaber - Espinoza\n\nZusi - Dwyer - Nemeth\n\nNumber to Remember - 25 - That's how many games in a row that the Galaxy are unbeaten at the Stub Hub Center. They have not lost there since the season opener of last season across all competitions. Twenty-three of those 25 games have come as the \"home\" team, the other two were as the visitors when playing Chivas USA. So KC winning tomorrow, they'll have to do something that hasn't been done in over a year.\n\nKey Match Up - Dom Dwyer vs Omar Gonzalez and AJ de la Garza - Kansas City has been getting Dwyer more involved in the games lately than he was earlier in the season. Over the last two games, Dwyer has been much more involved, scoring one and having three others ruled out either due to an offside call or foul. But the key is that he's getting the ball in dangerous positions. Earlier in the season Dwyer was left all alone up top against center backs who usually had a couple inches on him. With that, Dwyer was starved of service. Tomorrow KC will need to keep him involved against one of the better central defensive pairings in the league.\n\nPREDICTION - Sporting's offense, while looking more dangerous than the 1 shot on goal suggests, the team has still scored just one goal from the run of play this season in six games. That's really just not good enough, especially with Opara out, this team can't rely solely on set pieces. Against a Galaxy defense that could have a fatigued Gonzalez in the lineup, KC should really try to run at him more tomorrow. But I just don't think that KC is clicking well enough right now in the offensive third of the field to win this game. With or without Keane, I think that the Galaxy are just better than KC is right now.\n\nSKC - 1 (Nemeth)\n\nLA - 2 (Gordon, Husidic)\n\n#TBT The Last Time KC and LA Were Conference Rivals\n\nFor the first time since 2004, Sporting KC will be playing the LA Galaxy this weekend as a conference rival. With the additions of Real Salt Lake and Chivas USA back in 2005, KC has played the Galaxy in cross conference match ups. KC has played the Galaxy more than any other team in the league, 53 times in league play going 19-23-11 (across all competitions they've played 62 times, four fewer than the 66 KC has played against Colorado).\n\nThe last time these two teams met as conference rivals was in the 2004 MLS Cup playoffs. Having won the regular season Western Conference, the Wizards earn the right to host the Conference Finals after turning around a 2-0 deficit in the conference semifinals to win 3-2 on aggregate over the San Jose Earthquakes. Meanwhile, the Galaxy had qualified after a 2-1 aggregate win over the Colorado Rapids, losing the first leg 1-0 in Colorado.\n\nAt Arrowhead a day before Pitt State and Northwest Missouri State met at Arrowhead, the Wizards and Galaxy took the field to decide the Western Conference representative at MLS Cup. KC scored the opening goal just 24 minutes into the game as a ball was played up top to Josh Wolff who beat Tyrone Marshall to the ball, touching it inside and played it into the path of Davy Arnaud who was racing into the box. Arnaud put the ball between Kevin Hartman's legs and into the net giving KC a 1-0 lead. Shortly after that, tempers started to boil over after a Peter Vagenas foul on Jimmy Conrad. Arnaud came up and got in the face of Vagenas, who was also on the ground after the foul. Galaxy forward, Carlos Ruiz came up from behind Arnaud and grabbed him by the back of the neck pulling him away. This led to a larger scuffle between the two teams, with Nick Garcia surprisingly enough playing peacemaker trying to pull his players away from Ruiz.\n\nKC continued to dominate the play for most of the game, looking like a team that had already won the US Open Cup and had lost out on the Supporters' Shield on a tiebreaker, the Galaxy were over matched on the night. It wasn't until the 69th minute though when KC doubled their lead, with Arnaud again being the scorer as he continued his break out season that saw him score 14 goals over the course of the season across all competitions. Alex Zotinca played a nice ball into the box that Arnaud ran on to. As Hartman came sliding out to try to grab it, Arnaud touched it past him towards the end line. Arnaud turned and fired a shot from a tight angle that squeezed into the net, possibly with a little help, but either way it doubled KC's lead.\n\nAt the time it was one of the best parties I've enjoyed with the Cauldron, or at a game period (probably only topped by the win over LA in the 2000 MLS Cup playoffs). The season ended disappointingly in LA a little over a week later when KC lost 3-2 to DC United in MLS Cup.\n\nSaturday though KC and LA will meet up as conference rivals again.\n\nJohnson's Career Appears to be Over - Former SKC Wizards Update\n\nEddie Johnson hasn't played for DC United this year, he's been on an excused leave from the team because of an issue with his heart that was found last year during the playoffs. It now appears that the heart condition will force the one time Wizard and US international to retire from the game. While Johnson scored the third most goals in a single season for Kansas City, he's probably best remembered for his miss in the 2012 US Open Cup final when he was a member of the Seattle Sounders.\n\nHere's the rest of this week's update.\n\nActive without a club or unknown\n\nFederico Bessone\n\nBobby Convey\n\nMechack Jerome\n\nWill John\n\nMichael Kafari\n\nNeal Kitson\n\nJonathan Leathers\n\nCarlos Marinelli\n\nNelson Pizarro\n\nIvan Trujillo\n\nKonrad Warzycha\n\nMLS\n\nDavy Arnaud - DC - Started and played 90 minutes in DC's 2-2 draw with New York.\n\nTeal Bunbury - New England - Started and played 90 minutes in New England's 0-0 draw with Columbus.\n\nAurelien Collin - Orlando City - Started and played 90 minutes in Orlando's 2-0 win over Portland.\n\nLuis Gil - Salt Lake - Started and played 65 minutes in RSL's 0-0 draw with KC.\n\nMichael Harrington - Colorado - Started and played 90 minutes in Colorado's 4-0 win over Dallas.\n\nJack Jewsbury - Portland - Came off the bench and played 45 minutes in Portland's 2-0 loss to Orlando.\n\nEddie Johnson - DC - Out on leave.\n\nKei Kamara - Columbus - Started and played 90 minutes, scoring two goals in Columbus' 2-2 draw with Vancouver.

Opara will now miss at least four months and could be out for the season recovering from the injury. It's the fifth time in six professional seasons that Opara has had his season end early due to injury, four of those seasons were due to leg injuries of some kind.\n\nIt's certainly disappointing for one of the better defenders in the league this year to have his season end disappointingly like this. Hopefully he'll be able to return and pick up where he left off. But with his injury history that certainly has to be a big question of whether KC can afford having this happen to a defender they expect a lot from. It's not that Opara doesn't have the talent, he certainly does, but it's a question of whether KC can continue with the threat of having to use their third center back regularly when Opara picks up an injury.\n\nAs for this season though, the question is where KC goes from here in regards to their center back situation. The team still has three players that can play center back with Jalil Anibaba, Kevin Ellis, and Erik Palmer-Brown. Anibaba probably has the most experience at the position having played there for Chicago and Seattle before coming to KC. Ellis got the most time there last season after Opara's injury, having a decent if unspectacular season. Finally teenager Palmer-Brown got some experience last year filling in, but is still green as a professional.\n\nAnibaba right now is probably best utilized in the right back position, moving him centrally with Matt Besler would mean that either Amadou Dia or Ellis would have to come into the right back position. The likely choice though for the center back position is Ellis. The KC home grown player started at center back with Opara in the only game that Opara and Besler did not start together this season. It won't be an easy game this coming weekend against Los Angeles, especially if Robbie Keane is back and able to start, but it's what KC is likely going to need to do at this point.\n\nUnlike last year when Opara went down and KC still had Besler and Aurelien Collin to start for a majority of the season (minus the World Cup) still. Now with Opara down and 28 games left in the season, KC is looking at a likely platoon next to Besler to finish out the season. That's not ideal as we saw for periods of time last year. While I wasn't of the opinion that KC needed to go out and get a defender last year, I think the team may need to consider looking at bringing in another central defender that can start next to Besler every game, especially with the Gold Cup and the U20 World Cup both coming this summer.\n\nSporting Play Better but Can't Find the Net\n\nLast night at Sporting Park Sporting had an improved performance over their late win over Philadelphia, the team's defense was able to shut down the RSL attack, unfortunately things still aren't coming together for the club on the offensive end of the field where they're still struggling to finish chances.\n\nSporting KC had a good start and probably should have taken the lead in the 6th minute through Jalil Anibaba. Benny Feilhaber played a quick short free kick to Servando Carrasco. Carrasco got forward and played the ball to Ike Opara, the center back cut back inside and away from the goal before sliding a great through ball for Anibaba who took a touch and tried to fire the ball past Nick Rimando, but the Salt Lake keeper got a leg to it knocking the ball away and the ball was eventually cleared. KC dominated the run of play throughout the game, but couldn't put their chances on goal. Opara had a few chances himself when he came forward for set pieces, but put his headers over the bar. In the 29th, KC had a half chance to take the lead, as the ball got played wide to Marcel de Jong, where the Canadian played a fantastic ball on the ground through the box, but Dom Dwyer couldn't quite reach it to try to direct it into the net.\n\nIn the second half, KC continued to dominate play and should have taken the lead in the first minute of the second half. After a cross by Krisztian Nemeth made it all the way through the box, the ball was recollected by KC on the far side and eventually crossed back in to Nemeth who redirected the ball towards goal, but it hit off the post, the rebound fell to Jacob Peterson who couldn't put his effort on frame with Rimando out of position. KC continued to pressure offensive, creating chances but still unable to test Rimando in goal. On the other end of the field, KC's defense was solid, shutting down the RSL attack, holding them without a shot on goal all game. KC did get the ball in the net in the 55th minute on a counter attack after a offside call at the other end, but Peterson's cross into the box that Dwyer was able to redirect into the net didn't count as Dwyer was offside. KC suffered a big blow in the 81st minute. Off a Feilhaber corner kick, the ball was floated to the far post towards Opara, the centerback jumped for the ball but as soon as he went up something appeared to be wrong and Opara ended up just going to the ground. Opara appeared to be holding his calf after going down and was immediately substituted out of the game for Kevin Ellis. KC ended up having to settle for a single point from the dominating performance, one they may regret by the end of the season.\n\nWizards Man of the Match - Matt Besler - The defense in front of goalkeeper Luis Marin last night was on point, they were able to completely shut down the RSL attack, with the team's captain, Matt Besler leading the way.\n\nPlayer Ratings - Marin 6, Anibaba 7, Opara 7, Besler 8, de Jong 7, Carrasco 7, Espinoza 7, Feilhaber 6, Nemeth 5, Dwyer 4, Peterson 4. Subs Anor 4, Ellis NR.\n\nMatch Day 6: A Cross Conference Rival Now in Conference\n\nSince the rebranding of the KC Wizards to Sporting KC, the team has developed a rivalry with Real Salt Lake in the Western Conference. From preseason tackles by Roger Espinoza leading to benches clearing in 2011, to a Chris Wingert deserving a first minute sending off for a challenge on Kei Kamara in 2013 (Wingert was eventually sent off), to an MLS Cup match up between the two that saw KC come out on top in a 10 round penalty kick shootout. Now the two teams are in the same conference after the additions of NYCFC and Orlando City. That means that the teams will be facing off three times in the regular season, giving the two teams plenty of time to build on the rivalry that has started.\n\nSalt Lake comes into the game as the only remaining unbeaten team in the league, currently sitting with a 2-0-2 record after they handed San Jose their first loss in their new stadium with a 1-0 win last Sunday. Despite Jason Kreis' departure before last season, Garth Lagerwey's before this season, and losing two valuable squad players in the expansion draft, Salt Lake is still a tough team. With the offense being led by Alvaro Saborio and Javier Morales and the likes of Kyle Beckerman, Chris Schuler, and Nick Rimando in the defensive half, Salt Lake is still a formidable, if a little older (Schuler is the only one of those five under the age of 32). They do have some younger talent though that KC will need to account for in the likes of Luke Mulholland and home grown talent Jordan Allen, who scored the winner in Salt Lake's 2-1 win over Toronto a couple weeks ago.\n\nKC still seems to be attempting to really find their identity. Against Philadelphia KC got the win, but looked less than convincing in the process. Benny Feilhaber has been moved further up the field with the insertion of Servando Carrasco, but against Philadelphia KC's offense continued to struggle during the run of play with all three of KC's goals coming courtesy of a set piece or immediately after one. Of the six goals this season,all but one (Espinoza against Dallas) have come from set pieces. Even with the likes of Ike Opara, KC cannot continue to rely on set pieces as the way they're going to continually win games. Hopefully the return of Krisztian Nemeth to the starting lineup will bing a bit more dynamic style to the offense instead of pounding it forward to an undersized Dom Dwyer against two center backs over six foot.\n\nOther than inserting Nemeth I don't see many/any changes coming to the lineup that started against Philadelphia last week. With Seth Sinovic questionable due to an injury, Marcel de Jong will come back into the starting 11. Who Nemeth comes in for may be the question. Neither Jacob Peterson or Jimmy Medranda had much of a role in KC's win over Philadelphia. Based on the substitution I'd think that Nemeth is going to come in for Medranda, leaving Peterson in the lineup, which doesn't thrill me. Peterson does a lot of the dirty work that doesn't get a ton of credit defensively as a forward, but I'd prefer one that's more likely to contribute to the offense.\n\nMarin\n\nAnibaba - Opara - Besler - de Jong\n\nCarrasco\n\nFeilhaber - Espinoza\n\nNemeth - Dwyer - Peterson\n\nNumber to Remember - 61 - Salt Lake fans and staff like to talk about how they don't play KC's \"physical\" style, claiming they like to play a more possession based style while KC likes to pound on you and pressure. Sixy-one is the number of fouls that both teams have so far this season. Kansas City has reached that number through five games, averaging 12.5 a game, while RSL reached that number in one fewer, averaging almost three more a game than KC at 15.25.\n\nKey Match Up - Benny Feilhaber vs Kyle Beckerman - KC's main offensive creator, especially with Graham Zusi still likely out against RSL's defensive muscle. This should be a good one to watch, both directions as Beckerman's assist in MLS Cup 2013 shows that the defensive midfielder can be a major threat on offense as well.\n\nPREDICTION - It will be interesting to see how this game turns out. KC has been less than impressive this season, even in the win against Philadelphia KC didn't look that good. Meanwhile, Morales is playing some really good soccer right now for RSL. KC is going to have to be more organized as a whole, especially on defensive set pieces when RSL will bring up the big bodies of Schuler and Jamison Olave to join Saborio. RSL will be better defensively on set pieces than Philadelphia was. For KC to win this game, they're really going to need to create more chances from the run of play. The way KC has looked this season I'm not seeing how it's going to come the way the team is playing.\n\nSKC - 1 (Dwyer)\n\nRSL - 1 (Morales)\n\n#TBT - The Worst Signings in KC History\n\nAfter this past weekend's lost to Kansas City, combined with a number of other issues since his signing, Philadelphia benched goalkeeper Rais M'Bolhi, and his future with the club is now in question. This has led me to think about Sporting's signings throughout their history, and what player has been the worst signing in the team's history. So for this week's throw back Thursday I'm taking a look at some of the worst signings in my opinion in KC history.\n\nFirst to clear up, I'm going to look at signings, not necessarily draft picks or end of roster signings, guys like Victor Munoz or Scott Lorenz who were signed and didn't do a whole lot for the club may not have been great signings, but they're not horrible signings because they weren't expected to be that much of a contributor either. I also debated it and I'm not going to include trades in this, horrible trades may be something I look at later, so the trade that brought Jeff Baicher here in early 2000 only for him to retire saying KC were 10 years away from winning MLS Cup will not be included. I'm going to focus on guys that were signed to the league for the first time or signed as returning players to the league.\n\nSo here are a few of the signings.\n\nJermaine Hue - Signed late in the 2005 season, Hue was expected to give Kansas City some attacking help in the midfield. In his time in Kansas City though Hue barely got himself onto the field. Over parts of two seasons Hue played in just five games, starting just two. In those two starts he didn't play more than 45 minutes in either of them. Hue was waived in the middle of the 2006 season to make room on the roster for the impending signing of Dave van den Bergh.\n\nJeferson - The team's third designated player, signed on loan in the middle of the 2011 season, the team's first as Sporting KC. Jeferson was brought in to play the team's attacking midfield position and be the playmaker that KC fans had been wanting since Preki. The problem is that KC already had that playmaker emerging that season in Graham Zusi. His time started well for KC as he picked up an assist in his first appearance for KC as they topped Toronto 4-2. The assist was the only point that he picked up for Kansas City in nine league games and 11 across all competitions. Jeferson lost his spot to Zusi and ended up playing in just three of KC's final seven games, including the playoffs, starting just one of those games.\n\nWhile Jeferson's loan status saves him a little bit, the fact that he took up a designated player spot definitely finds him on this list.\n\nVuk Rasovic - The former Serbian international was signed by Kansas City early in the 2004 season after impressing in the team's preseason. The then 31 year old defender was a bit of a surprise signing though as the Wizards defense at the time was quite solid with a back line of Alex Zotinca, Shavar Thomas, Jimmy Conrad, and Nick Garcia making up the back four. And with the likes of Diego Gutierrez and Jose Burciaga in reserve to play defense it seemed like the move didn't make sense.\n\nRasovic played just one game for Kansas City, starting a home game against Dallas. Rasovic looked slow and off the pace of the game. He was pulled at half time in favor of Thomas and never saw the field again for Kansas City.\n\nAntti Sumiala - Like Hue, Sumiala was signed late in the 2005 season to help Kansas City's push for the playoffs. Sumiala also had a minimal effect, playing just two games for Kansas City, the clubs final two of the 2005 season. He started both games and did end up getting an assist on Josh Wolff's opener as the Wizards blew 2-0 lead at home and ended up drawing 2-2 with New England. He also started KC's season finale against Dallas before being pulled at half time with the game tied and Kansas City needing a win to make the playoffs.\n\nKlopas Leads Montreal to CCL Final - Former SKC Wizards Update\n\nThe second player ever allocated to Kansas City back in 1996, Frank Klopas, has led the Montreal Impact to the CONCACAF Champions League Final. Klopas and the Impact took a 2-0 lead from the first leg down to Costa Rica against Alajuelense. The Impact grabbed a lead late in the first half to make it 3-0 on aggregate. The Impact then held on, picking up a second goal while Alajuelense scored four. The two away goals though carried Montreal through to the final.\n\nHere's the rest of this week's update.\n\nActive without a club or unknown\n\nFederico Bessone\n\nBobby Convey\n\nMechack Jerome\n\nWill John\n\nMichael Kafari\n\nNeal Kitson\n\nJonathan Leathers\n\nCarlos Marinelli\n\nNelson Pizarro\n\nIvan Trujillo\n\nKonrad Warzycha\n\nMLS\n\nDavy Arnaud - DC - Started and played 90 minutes in DC's 1-0 win over Orlando.\n\nTeal Bunbury - New England - Came off the bench and played 19 minutes in New England's 2-0 win over Colorado.\n\nAurelien Collin - Orlando City - Started and played 90 minutes in Orlando's 1-0 loss to DC.\n\nLuis Gil - Salt Lake - Came off the bench and played 14 minutes in RSL's 1-0 win over San Jose.\n\nMichael Harrington - Colorado - Started and played 90 minutes in Colorado's 2-0 loss to New England.\n\nJack Jewsbury - Portland - Came off the bench and played 9 minutes in Portland's 3-1 win over Dallas.\n\nEddie Johnson - DC - Out on leave.\n\nKei Kamara - Columbus - No game this week.\n\nChris Konopka - Toronto - Dressed but did not play in Toronto's 3-2 loss to Chicago.\n\nEric Kronberg - Montreal - Not eligible for Montreal's 4-2 CCL loss.\n\nCJ Sapong - Philadelphia - Came off the bench and played 18 minutes in Philadelphia's 3-2 loss to KC.\n\nKhari Stephenson - San Jose - Did not dress in San Jose's 1-0 loss to RSL.\n\nTyson Wahl - Columbus - No game this week.\n\nSal Zizzo - New York - No game this week.\n\nNASL\n\nStefan Antonijevic - Tampa Bay - Started and played 90 minutes in Tampa's 3-1 win over San Antonio.\n\nJames Marcelin - Fort Lauderdale - Came off the bench and played 76 minutes in Fort Lauderdale's 1-0 loss to New York.\n\nRauwshan McKenzie - Atlanta - Started and played 90 minutes in Atlanta's 1-1 draw with Indy.\n\nKyle Miller - Atlanta - Started and played 90 minutes in Atlanta's 1-1 draw with Indy.\n\nUSL\n\nChristian Duke - Oklahoma City - Did not dress in OKC's 2-1 win over Colorado Springs.\n\nBrian Fekete - Austin - Did not play in Austin's 3-0 loss to Vancouver.

The game was book ended by goals as both the beginning and end saw the activity with the ball ending up in the net.\n\nJust three minutes into the game the Union grabbed the lead. Off of a Sebastien Le Toux corner kick, Luis Marin came and completely missed the ball, which then hit off the shoulder of Sporting forward Jacob Peterson. The ball headed towards net where Jalil Anibaba tried to kick it clear but could not before the ball crossed the line giving the Union the 1-0 lead. The lead would last only 13 minutes before Sporting equalized on a set piece of their own. A corner kick by Benny Feilhaber was played to the back post for Dom Dwyer. Like Marin on the Union's opener, Rais M'bolhi completely whiffed as he came for the ball giving Dwyer a free header to put into the empty net and level the game at 1-1. The game was only level for three minutes though, as a foul by Marcel de Jong led to a Union free kick near the sideline. Le Toux played the ball into the box where Fernando Aristeguieta just out muscled Sporting KC captain Matt Besler for the ball and headed the ball from near the penalty spot past Marin and into the net giving the Union a 2-1 lead.\n\nFrom there KC controlled possession in the game but couldn't find an equalizer that would count, although KC twice had goals called back due to offside calls or fouls. Dwyer was the culprit on both of them. The Union also had one of their own called back as a free kick into the box was knocked down by Marin into the path of Aristeguieta who put the ball away, but Maurice Edu was offside and the goal was called back. A couple minutes, Dwyer had his second goal waived off as he rose to head a Feilhaber corner kick in, but he used Union defender Raymon Gaddis to help him get height on his jump and the score remained at 2-1 Union.\n\nThe Union really should have put the game away late on as Aristeguieta striped Roger Espinoza of the ball in the Union's half and raced down the field towards goal. Espinoza caught The Venezuelan, tackling the ball away, but it fell to Le Toux who tried to curl his effort into the far corner, but Marin got a touch that carried the ball onto the post. The rebound fell to Michael Lahoud, but from close range he put his effort well over the bar. KC looked set to lose at home for the first time this season when a Feilhaber free kick from the sideline was headed clear towards Espinoza. The Honduran played the ball back into the box where it was met by Jalil Anibaba who headed the ball on goal towards the corner. Substitute, Krisztian Nemeth could reach the ball, but his play on it seemed to freeze M'bolhi who didn't make a play on the ball until it was past him and into the net tying the game at 2-2. With six minutes of stoppage time displayed on the board, KC still had plenty of time to find a winner and they did in the fourth minute of stoppage time as a corner by Feilhaber was flicked on to the back post by Matt Besler, where it was then turned in by Nemeth to give Kansas City the win. In the end, watching replays I'm not sure that Nemeth will get credit for the goal in the end, more likely it'll be a Raymond Lee (former SKC academy player) own goal. But they all count the same and Kansas City was able to escape with a 3-2 win over the Philadelphis Union.\n\nThere are plenty of questions to ask about KC though with regards specifically to the left back now after Marcel de Jong looked out of his element on the left side, being replaced at half time by Seth Sinovic who seemed to settle that side of the field down. We'll see if that has a long term effect on that Canadian international's playing time. But for tonight, KC will walk away with all three points.\n\nWizards man of the match - Benny Feilhaber - As of right now, a pair of assists for KC's midfielder. More was expected of him in the offense with Graham Zusi out and Servando Carrasco sitting deeper, and Feilhaber delivered with some very good set pieces that allowed KC to pull out the win.\n\nPlayer Ratings - Marin 5, de Jong 4, Besler 5, Opara 5, Anibaba 5, Carrasco 6, Espinoza 5, Feilhaber 7, Peterson 4, Dwyer 5, Medranda 4. Subs Sinovic 6, Nemeth 6, Mustivar 6.\n\nMatch Day 5: The Union Visit Looking to Bust Another Slump\n\nSporting Kansas City return home, one week after getting their first win of the season. This weekend they'll play a team that's made Sporting Park a bit of a second home over the past few years. The Philadelphia Union, who I mentioned in this week's Throw Back Thursday is unbeaten in their last three trips to Sporting Park, going 2-0-1 in the three games played here. In fact, two of those three games have seen the Union bust slumps here with wins.\n\nAnd like those times, Philadelphia again comes into the game in a slump, having gone 0-2-2 so far this year and haven't won in five dating back to a 2-1 win over Kansas City last year at PPL Park. The Union have scored three goals this year, all three came in one game, the club's 3-3 draw in Salt Lake. Two of the goals have been scored by Fernando Aristeguieta while the third was an own goal. Not only have the Union had trouble scoring, but they've also has issues with injuries. At one point this week in practice, they had just 13 players available for practice. They will be without Cristian Maidana, who scored the winner in Philly's 2-1 win in KC last year, defender Sheanon Williams, and Conor Casey, who scored the winner in the Union's 1-0 win in KC in 2013. Also likely out is former Kansas City forward, CJ Sapong who is recovering still from a concussion and facial fracture. On top of all that they will also be without Zach Pfeffer and Fred who are both suspended due to red cards and disciplinary committee actions.\n\nWhile Sporting's injury concerns are fewer, they are no less sever, as the team will be without Graham Zusi for tomorrow's game due to the hamstring injury that he picked up in the 1-0 win over NYCFC. While Zusi hasn't contributed to a goal this season, he has been very involved in the offense and will leave a hole on the wing for KC. Also of question is the health of the likes of Marcel de Jong, who left Canada's friendly win with a knock, Jimmy Medranda, who also left the NYCFC game with a knock, and Krisztian Nemeth, who just returned to training just this week from a knee sprain. So there are plenty of questions to ask about KC's lineup, specifically when it comes to KC's wing play. Peter Vermes has said that Nemeth would be available and in the 18 this week, the question is if he's available to start for KC. If he can you would expect him to slot in on one of the wings with Medranda if he's able to go on the other wing. If not one would think that Bernardo Anor would get the start on the opposite wing for KC.\n\nThe other question on KC's lineup is probably in the midfield, where Sporting will welcome back Roger Espinoza from international duty this week. The question is who he enters the lineup for. Last week at New York Servando Carrasco came in for the Honduran international, sitting a little deeper, allowing Benny Feilhaber to get forward more and more involved in KC's attack. For me I think that Carrasco has earned himself another start in the midfield, mainly because it gets Feilhaber into the attack more. I'd insert Espinoza for Paulo Nagamura in KC's midfield, let him work from end to end in his normal role, allow Feilhaber to create more and let Carrasco distribute deep.\n\nMarin\n\nAnibaba - Opara - Besler - de Jong\n\nCarrasco\n\nFeilhaber - Espinoza\n\nMedranda - Dwyer - Nemeth\n\nNumber to Remember - 600 - Sporting KC play it's 600th game in league play in team history tomorrow. Like when they hit 500 games, KC will become the first team in MLS history to hit 600.\n\nKey Match Up - Ike Opara vs Fernando Aristeguieta - Aristeguieta has scored two of the Union's three goals, keeping an eye on him tomorrow is going to be key for Kansas City. That duty will likely fall to Kansas City's leading scorer, Opara. If KC can keep him in check this is a game that KC should be able to win.\n\nPREDICTION - This game is perfectly set up for a let down for Kansas City. As I mentioned earlier, any time Philadelphia has come into Sporting Park in a slump, KC has played the part of slump buster and Philadelphia has left with all three points. Like those other games, this is a game that KC should win and really should win going away, and should be an opportunity for Dom Dwyer and Nemeth to get themselves off the mark for this season. Whether that happens or not we'll see, KC's not shown the ability to really put their foot on someone's throat. It really is time for the team to prove they can beat a team they know they are better than.\n\nSKC - 2 (Dwyer, Nemeth)\n\nPHI - 0\n\n#TBT Sporting's History at Home vs Philadelphia Since The Last Win vs the Union\n\nNot going to be going as far back into history this time for this week's Throw Back Thursday. Instead I'm going to use it to build on this weekend's game against the Philadelphia Union at Sporting Park. Since Philadelphia came into the league in 2010, they've not had much success, making the playoffs just once along with making the US Open Cup final last year, losing to Seattle. But while Philadelphia has never been that great of a team, that hasn't kept them from making Kansas City their slump buster when they come to visit. Since Sporting Park opened in 2011, Kansas City has picked up just one win against the Union at home, and since then, the club has gone 0-2-1.\n\nLast year, KC went 0-1-1 against the Union at Sporting Park. The first meeting, on a Wednesday in May last year saw the Union come in with a 1-5-5 record (having zero wins in their last nine) and then head coach, John Hackworth was very much on the hot seat for the Union. The Union came in and while KC dominated in possession 66% to 34%, they couldn't find a goal in the first half. The Union grabbed the very early in the second half as Danny Cruz pounced on a rebound of a shot by Cristian Maidana that had been saved by Eric Kronberg. Cruz immediately signaled for his teammates to join him in running over to the bench for a group hug with Hackworth. KC pushed the game the rest of the way looking for an equalizer and found it in the 80th minute from Dom Dwyer who scored after a give and go with Paulo Nagamura. The game wasn't tied long though as Philadelphia came right back down the field with Andrew Wenger finding Maidana unmarked on the back side, he calmly slotted it home to put Philadelphia back on top 2-1 which is how the game finished.\n\nThe second meeting at Sporting Park saw Kansas City again control the game, this time with 68% of the possession, but again it took until the second half for one of the teams to find the net. This time it was KC grabbing the lead early in the second half as Graham Zusi was played in behind Philadelphia's defense by Toni Dovale. Zusi slotted his shot past Zac MacMath to give KC the lead. Unfortunately the Union found their leveler through recent loan signing, Brian Brown who got himself some space away from Kevin Ellis and headed it past Andy Gruenebaum.\n\nIn 2013 things didn't go much better at Sporting Park. While KC bookended the season with wins on the road in Philadelphia (3-1 and 2-1), KC again couldn't get it down at home. The Union came into the game at Sporting Park having not scored since the 50th minute of a 5-1 loss to New England, which was their only goal in what at the time was an 0-4-1 winless streak. Once again Kansas City had over 60% possession against Philadelphia and dominated play. But like the other games I've mentioned above they were unable to find net. Conor Casey was able to though in the 36th minute as he capitalized on a rebound knocking the ball past a number of KC bodies to give the Union a 1-0 lead and end a scoreless streak of almost four games. Like the other games against Philadelphia, KC had a number of scoring opportunities but still couldn't find a goal to level the game.\n\nTo get to KC's last home win against the Union, one has to go back to 2012, the final game of the season for KC. The Union were already eliminated from the playoff race while KC was looking to flinch the top spot in the Eastern Conference. Just before half, KC grabbed the lead as Jacob Peterson finished off an excellent cross from Kei Kamara to put KC on top. As seems to be habit, the lead didn't last long, as in the 53rd minute, Philadelphia won a penalty kick after a foul by Matt Besler on Cruz. Michael Farfan stepped up but Jimmy Nielsen made the save. Antoine Hoppenot was the first to react to the save by Nielsen though and put the rebound away to tie the game. Philadelphia almost grabbed the lead minutes later as a Jack McInerney header hit the post and was eventually cleared away. KC looked like there were going to have to settle for a draw when Kei Kamara collected a ball near midfield and turned up the field in the 82nd. Kamara dribbled past three Union defenders before picking up speed and running at the Union back line. Kamara then slotted the ball through to CJ Sapong who fired his shot past MacMath and into the net. KC would be able to hold on and take the 2-1 win to clinch first in the East.\n\nLike two of the previous three meetings, the Union head into this weekend's game against KC as the wounded animal, having gone 0-2-2 on the season, scoring three goals, all of which came in one game, while allowing six. The also haven't won since the 2-1 win over KC at PPL Park to close out their home season last year. The game is certainly set up for the Union to once again get their slump busting win. Hopefully KC has learned and will be able to step up this time."
