Obese people often suffer from diseases which acute decompensation requires a prompt prehospital therapy. The Emergency Medical Service will be confronted with difficulties in clinical diagnostic, therapy and especially with a delayed management of rescue and transport. It is most important to avoid prehospital depreciation in quality and time management. This article reviews the specific requirements of prehospital care of obese persons and discusses possible solutions to optimize the prehospital therapy.

Patients can lose control of their body and encounter unfamiliar faces in an emergency situation. To describe what specialist ambulance nurse students experienced as preserved and humiliated dignity in prehospital emergency care. The study had a qualitative approach. Data were collected by Flanagan's critical incident technique. The participants were 26 specialist ambulance nurse students who described two critical incidents of preserved and humiliated dignity, from prehospital emergency care. Data consist of 52 critical incidents and were analyzed with interpretive content analysis. Ethical considerations: The study followed the ethical principles in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The result showed how human dignity in prehospital emergency care can be preserved by the ambulance nurse being there for the patient. The ambulance nurses meet the patient in the patient's world and make professional decisions. The ambulance nurse respects the patient's will and protects the patient's body from the gaze of others. Humiliated dignity was described through the ambulance nurse abandoning the patient and by healthcare professionals failing, disrespecting, and ignoring the patient. It is a unique situation when a nurse meets a patient face to face in a critical life or death moment. The discussion describes courage and the ethical vision to see another human. Dignity was preserved when the ambulance nurse showed respect and protected the patient in prehospital emergency care. The ambulance nurse students' ethical obligation results in the courage to see when a patient's dignity is in jeopardy of being humiliated. Humiliated dignity occurs when patients are ignored and left unprotected. This ethical dilemma affects the ambulance nurse students badly due to the fact that the morals and attitudes of ambulance nurses are reflected in their actions toward the patient.\n\nArchitecture of a prehospital emergency patient care report system (PEPRS).\n\nPubMed\n\nMajeed, Raphael W; StÃ¶hr, Mark R; RÃ¶hrig, Rainer\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn recent years, prehospital emergency care adapted to the technology shift towards tablet computers and mobile computing. In particular, electronic patient care report (e-PCR) systems gained considerable attention and adoption in prehospital emergency medicine [1]. On the other hand, hospital information systems are already widely adopted. Yet, there is no universal solution for integrating prehospital emergency reports into electronic medical records of hospital information systems. Previous projects either relied on proprietary viewing workstations or examined and transferred only data for specific diseases (e.g. stroke patients[2]). Using requirements engineering and a three step software engineering approach, this project presents a generic architecture for integrating prehospital emergency care reports into hospital information systems. Aim of this project is to describe a generic architecture which can be used to implement data transfer and integration of pre hospital emergency care reports to hospital information systems. In summary, the prototype was able to integrate data in a standardized manner. The devised methods can be used design generic software for prehospital to hospital data integration.\n\nDevelopment of key performance indicators for prehospital emergency care.\n\nPubMed\n\nMurphy, Adrian; Wakai, Abel; Walsh, Cathal; Cummins, Fergal; O'Sullivan, Ronan\n\n2016-04-01\n\nKey performance indicators (KPIs) are used to monitor and evaluate critical areas of clinical and support functions that influence patient outcome. Traditional prehospital emergency care performance monitoring has focused solely on response time metrics. The landscape of emergency care delivery in Ireland is in the process of significant national reconfiguration. The development of KPIs is therefore considered one of the key priorities in prehospital research. The aim of this study was to develop a suite of KPIs for prehospital emergency care in Ireland. A systematic literature review of prehospital care performance measurement was undertaken followed by a three-round Delphi consensus process facilitated by a broad-based multidisciplinary group of panellists. The consensus process was conducted between June 2012 and October 2013. Each candidate indicator on the Delphi survey questionnaire was rated using a 5-point Likert-type rating scale. Agreement was defined as at least 70% of responders rating an indicator as 'agree' or 'strongly agree' on the rating scale. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Sensitivity of the ratings was examined for robustness by bootstrapping the original sample. Of the 78 citations identified by the systematic review, 5 relevant publications were used to select candidate indicators for the Delphi round 1 questionnaire. Response rates in Delphi rounds 1 and 2 were 89% and 83%, respectively. Following the consensus development conference, 101 KPIs reached consensus. Based on the Donabedian framework for quality-of-care indicators, 7 of the KPIs which reached agreement were structure KPIs, 74 were process KPIs and 20 were outcome KPIs. The highest ranked indicator was a process KPI ('Direct transport of ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients to a primary percutaneous intervention (PCI)-capable facility for ECG to PCI time <90â min'). Improving the quality of prehospital care requires the development and implementation of\n\nSevere sepsis in pre-hospital emergency care: analysis of incidence, care, and outcome.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeymour, Christopher W; Rea, Thomas D; Kahn, Jeremy M; Walkey, Allan J; Yealy, Donald M; Angus, Derek C\n\n2012-12-15\n\nSevere sepsis is common and highly morbid, yet the epidemiology of severe sepsis at the frontier of the health care system-pre-hospital emergency care-is unknown. We examined the epidemiology of pre-hospital severe sepsis among emergency medical services (EMS) encounters, relative to acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Retrospective study using a community-based cohort of all nonarrest, nontrauma King County EMS encounters from 2000 to 2009 who were transported to a hospital. Overall incidence rate of hospitalization with severe sepsis among EMS encounters, as well as pre-hospital characteristics, admission diagnosis, and outcomes. Among 407,176 EMS encounters, we identified 13,249 hospitalizations for severe sepsis, of whom 2,596 died in the hospital (19.6%). The crude incidence rate of severe sepsis was 3.3 per 100 EMS encounters, greater than for acute myocardial infarction or stroke (2.3 per 100 and 2.2 per 100 EMS encounters, respectively). More than 40% of all severe sepsis hospitalizations arrived at the emergency department after EMS transport, and 80% of cases were diagnosed on admission. Pre-hospital care intervals, on average, exceeded 45 minutes for those hospitalized with severe sepsis. One-half or fewer of patients with severe sepsis were transported by paramedics (n = 7,114; 54%) or received pre-hospital intravenous access (n = 4,842; 37%). EMS personnel care for a substantial and increasing number of patients with severe sepsis, and spend considerable time on scene and during transport. Given the emphasis on rapid diagnosis and intervention for sepsis, the pre-hospital interval may represent an important opportunity for recognition and care of sepsis.\n\nPsychological consequences of aggression in pre-hospital emergency care: cross sectional survey.\n\nPubMed\n\nBernaldo-De-QuirÃ³s, MÃ³nica; Piccini, Ana T; GÃ³mez, M Mar; Cerdeira, Jose C\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPre-hospital emergency care is a particularly vulnerable setting for workplace violence. However, there is no literature available to date on the psychological consequences of violence in pre-hospital emergency care. To evaluate the psychological consequences of exposure to workplace violence from patients and those accompanying them in pre-hospital emergency care. A retrospective cross-sectional study. 70 pre-hospital emergency care services located in Madrid region. A randomized sample of 441 health care workers (135 physicians, 127 nurses and 179 emergency care assistants). Data were collected from February to May 2012. The survey was divided into four sections: demographic/professional information, level of burnout determined by Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), mental health status using General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) and frequency and type of violent behaviour experienced by staff members. The health care professionals who had been exposed to physical and verbal violence presented a significantly higher percentage of anxiety, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and burnout syndrome compared with those who had not been subjected to any aggression. Frequency of verbal violence (more than five times) was related to emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Type of violence (i.e. physical aggression) is especially related to high anxiety levels and frequency of verbal aggression is associated with burnout (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization). Psychological counselling should be made available to professional staff who have been subjected to physical aggression or frequent verbal violence. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Data were collected at sites in Sweden and Norway. Focus group interviews were conducted to enable the collection of data from paramedics, ambulance nurses and nursing students, while individual interviews were utilized to gather data from older people. There is little research on the quality of care older people over 65 years old receive in prehospital emergency care. Older people often present with multiple pathology and diverse needs that nurses are well equipped to deal with, but presently there is no clearly defined role for nurses in prehospital emergency care in the United Kingdom, although other countries such as Sweden and Norway are developing an ambulance nurse role. If the multiple needs of older people were addressed in the prehospital field, a reduction in readmissions and increased functional ability might be achieved. Comprehensive training is required for ambulance staff to enable them to meet such needs. While nurses have a great foundation for this care, additional specialist ambulance training is required alongside a need for education on older people's needs and attitudes to older people. The introduction of ambulance nurses will result in role differentiation between paramedics and ambulance nurses, which has the potential for creating role conflict. To ensure a smooth transition appropriate training and education for nurses and paramedics should be provided. The end result is a potentially greatly enhanced ambulance care provision, enabling high quality care to all patients.\n\nPrehospital Trauma Care in Singapore.\n\nPubMed\n\nHo, Andrew Fu Wah; Chew, David; Wong, Ting Hway; Ng, Yih Yng; Pek, Pin Pin; Lim, Swee Han; Anantharaman, Venkataraman; Hock Ong, Marcus Eng\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPrehospital emergency care in Singapore has taken shape over almost a century. What began as a hospital-based ambulance service intended to ferry medical cases was later complemented by an ambulance service under the Singapore Fire Brigade to transport trauma cases. The two ambulance services would later combine and come under the Singapore Civil Defence Force. The development of prehospital care systems in island city-state Singapore faces unique challenges as a result of its land area and population density. This article defines aspects of prehospital trauma care in Singapore. It outlines key historical milestones and current initiatives in service, training, and research. It makes propositions for the future direction of trauma care in Singapore. The progress Singapore has made given her circumstances may serve as lessons for the future development of prehospital trauma systems in similar environments.

Little is known about prehospital care in childhood arterial ischemic stroke (AIS). We aimed to determine emergency medical services call-taker and paramedic diagnostic sensitivity and to describe timelines of care in childhood AIS. This is a retrospective study of ambulance-transported children aged <18 years with first radiologically confirmed AIS, from 2008 to 2015. Interhospital transfers of children with preexisting AIS diagnosis were excluded. Twenty-three children were identified; 4 with unavailable ambulance records were excluded. Nineteen children were included in the study. Median age was 8 years (interquartile range, 3-14); median Pediatric National Institutes of Stroke Severity Scale score was 8 (interquartile range, 3-16). Emergency medical services call-taker diagnosis was stroke in 4 children (21%). Priority code 1 (lights and sirens) ambulances were dispatched for 13 children (68%). Paramedic diagnosis was stroke in 5 children (26%), hospital prenotification occurred in 8 children (42%), and 13 children (68%) were transported to primary stroke centers. Median prehospital timelines were onset to emergency medical services contact 13 minutes, call to scene 12 minutes, time at scene 14 minutes, transport time 43 minutes, and total prehospital time 71 minutes (interquartile range, 60-85). Emergency medical services call-taker and paramedic diagnostic sensitivity and prenotification rates are low in childhood AIS.

Therefore, prehospital emergency physicians (EP) are confronted with 'end of life decisions'. No educational content exists concerning palliative medicine in emergency medicine curricula. Over the course of 6 months, we interviewed 150 EPs about their experiences in 'end of life decisions' using a specific questionnaire. The total response rate was 69% (n = 104). Most of the interviewed EPs (89%, n = 93) had been confronted with palliative care medical emergencies and expressed uncertainties in dealing with these difficult situations, especially in the area of psychosocial care of the patients (50%). The emergency treatment of palliative care patients can become a particular challenge for any EP. A large percentage of interviewed EPs felt uncertain about aspects of social care and in the assessment of decisions at the end of life. Further information and training are necessary to amenable EPs to provide adequate patient-oriented care to palliative care patients and their relatives in emergency situations.\n\nImproving medical students' understanding of prehospital care through a fourth year emergency medicine clerkship.\n\nPubMed\n\nMerlin, Mark A; Moon, Jeffery; Krimmel, Jessica; Liu, Junfeng; Marques-Baptista, Andreia\n\n2010-02-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to survey medical students for a measurable opinion or knowledge increase in prehospital care after a fourth-year clerkship in emergency medicine (EM). The goal of the mandatory prehospital care aspect of the clerkship was twofold: to diminish the prehospital knowledge gap in medical school by teaching students about prehospital protocols and disaster medicine and to increase student interest. The study setting was within a university-based academic EM department with a prehospital system of 250 prehospital personnel. Data were collected from two similar questionnaires administered pre- and post-rotation to 49 fourth-year medical students. Statistical analyses were applied to collected data to quantify the changes of opinion and knowledge. Questions used a Likert five-point Scale. The data verified the improvement of students' knowledge in multiple areas of assessment. Greater than 35% opinion change (two points on the Likert Scale) was found in areas of prehospital care, 911 dispatch and education differences in prehospital providers (all p<0.0001; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.02, 0.66 to 0.90 and 0.66 to 0.90, respectively). Greater than 35% opinion change was also found in understanding triage (p=0.03; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.58) and general teaching of prehospital care, fellowship opportunities and use of a monitor/defibrillator (p<0.0001, p<0.0001 and p=0.04, respectively). We found medical students developed a significantly improved understanding of prehospital care. Without extraordinary effort, academic emergency departments could easily include a significant experience and education within fourth-year EM clerkships.\n\n[Recruitment and training of prehospital emergency care nurses in Paris].\n\nPubMed\n\nPladec, Boris Martin le; Menoret, Romuald; Rodes, RaphaÃ«l\n\n2016-11-01\n\nIn collaboration with the ambulance driver and the emergency doctor, the prehospital nurse provides care in a universe which is often difficult and sometimes hostile. Whether they are a nurse from the Samu (urgent medical aid service) or from the Paris fire service, how are they recruited and what training do these emergency care professionals receive?

Pediatric prehospital emergency medical services are less likely to be used by Latinos. We identified perceptions of and barriers to prehospital pediatric emergency care (911) access among Spanish-speaking parents. A qualitative study involving six focus groups was conducted. Spanish-speaking parents participated with a bilingual moderator. Topics discussed included experiences, knowledge, beliefs, fears, barriers, and improvement strategies. All groups were audiotaped, transcribed, and reviewed for recurring themes. Forty-nine parents participated. Though parents believed 911 was available to all, many were uncertain how to use it, and what qualified as an emergency. Barriers included language discordance, fear of exposing immigration status, and fear of financial consequences. Parents strongly desired to learn more about 911 through classes, brochures, and media campaigns. Prehospital emergency care should be available to all children. Further quantitative studies may help solidify the identified barriers and uncover areas needing improvement within Emergency Medical Systems. Addressing barriers to 911 use in Spanish-speaking communities could improve the equity of health care delivery, while also decreasing the amount of non-emergency 911 use.\n\nSpinal immobilisaton in pre-hospital and emergency care: A systematic review of the literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nHood, Natalie; Considine, Julie\n\n2015-08-01\n\nSpinal immobilisation has been a mainstay of trauma care for decades and is based on the premise that immobilisation will prevent further neurological compromise in patients with a spinal column injury. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the evidence related to spinal immobilisation in pre-hospital and emergency care settings. In February 2015, we performed a systematic literature review of English language publications from 1966 to January 2015 indexed in MEDLINE and Cochrane library using the following search terms: 'spinal injuries' OR 'spinal cord injuries' AND 'emergency treatment' OR 'emergency care' OR 'first aid' AND immobilisation. EMBASE was searched for keywords 'spinal injury OR 'spinal cord injury' OR 'spine fracture AND 'emergency care' OR 'prehospital care'. There were 47 studies meeting inclusion criteria for further review. Ten studies were case series (level of evidence IV) and there were 37 studies from which data were extrapolated from healthy volunteers, cadavers or multiple trauma patients. There were 15 studies that were supportive, 13 studies that were neutral, and 19 studies opposing spinal immobilisation. There are no published high-level studies that assess the efficacy of spinal immobilisation in pre-hospital and emergency care settings. Almost all of the current evidence is related to spinal immobilisation is extrapolated data, mostly from healthy volunteers. Copyright Â© 2015 College of Emergency Nursing Australasia Ltd.

In addition, the National Ambulance Service was commissioned initially in 2004 and has developed to include both prehospital transport services in all regions of the country and Emergency Medical Technician training. Over a decade of domestic and international partnership has focused on making improvements in emergency care at a variety of institutional levels, culminating in the establishment of comprehensive emergency care training programs. We describe the history and status of novel postgraduate emergency physician, nurse, and prehospital provider training programs as well as the prospect of creating a board certification process and formal continuing education program for practicing emergency physicians. Significant strides have been made in the development of emergency care and training in Ghana over the last decade, resulting in the first group of Specialist-level emergency physicians as of late 2012, as well as development of accredited emergency nursing curricula and continued expansion of a national Emergency Medical Service. This work represents a significant move toward in-country development of sustainable, interdisciplinary, team-based emergency provider training programs designed to retain skilled health care workers in Ghana and may serve as a model for similar developing nations.

Communication difficulties due to lack of mutual language is a challenge in health care systems around the world. Little is known about nurses' strategies while caring for patients with whom they do not share a mutual language in an unstructured, unplanned prehospital emergency environment, the ambulance service. A qualitative study design based on interviews was used and a purposeful sample and snowball technique was used to identify nurses with prehospital emergency experience of caring for patients with limited Swedish-English proficiency. Eleven nurses were interviewed, and the main strategy they used was adapting to the patients' need and the caring situation. The nurses used their own body, and tone of voice for creating a sense of trust and security. The nurses also used structured assessment in accordance with medical guidelines. Translation devices and relatives/bystanders were used as interpreters when possible. Another strategy was to transport the patient directly to the emergency department since they had not found a secure way of assessing and caring for the patients in the ambulance. The nurses used a palette of strategies while assessing and caring for patients when there was no mutual language between the caregiver and care seeker. This article is protected by copyright.

This study aims to review studies conducted on the pre-hospital emergency status in Iran. Data were sourced from Iranian electronic databases, including SID, IranMedex, IranDoc, Magiran, and non-Iranian electronic databases, such as Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar. In addition, available data and statistics for the country were used. All Persian-language articles published in Iranian scientific journals and related English-language articles published in Iranian and non-Iranian journals indexed on valid sites for September 2005 - 2014 were systematically reviewed. To review the selected articles, a data extraction form developed by the researchers as per the study's objective was adopted. The articles were examined under two categories: structure and function of pre-hospital emergency. A total of 19 articles were selected, including six descriptive studies (42%), four descriptive-analytical studies (21%), five review articles (16%), two qualitative studies (10.5%), and two interventional (experimental) studies (10.5%). In addition, of these, 14 articles (73.5%) had been published in the English language. The focus of these selected articles were experts (31.5%), bases of emergency medical services (26%), injured (16%), data reviews (16%), and employees (10.5%). A majority of the studies (68%) investigated pre-hospital emergency functions and 32% reviewed the pre-hospital emergency structure. The number of studies conducted on pre-hospital emergency services in Iran is limited. To promote public health, consideration of prevention areas, processes to provide pre-hospital emergency services, policymaking, foresight, systemic view, comprehensive research programs and roadmaps, and assessments of research needs in pre-hospital emergency seem necessary.\n\nAttitudes of prehospital emergency care professionals toward refusal of treatment: A regional survey in Turkey.\n\nPubMed\n\nErbay, Hasan; Alan, Sultan; Kadioglu, Selim\n\n2014-08-01\n\nPrehospital emergency medicine is a specific field of emergency medicine. The basic approach of prehospital emergency medicine is to provide patients with medical intervention at the scene of the incident. This special environment causes health professionals to encounter various problems. One of the most important problems in this field is ethics, in particular questions involving refusal of treatment and the processes associated with it. The objective of this study is to identify emergency health professionals' views regarding refusal of treatment. This study was conducted with 356 health professionals who were on active duty in prehospital emergency health services. The data were collected through a form which included 10 statements. The participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement with the statements given by rating them between 0 and 10. Before conducting the research, permission was received from the local ethics committee. Participants were given written information about the purpose of the study. Participants were assured that their participation was voluntary. The healthcare professionals with fewer years of experience in the profession and female participants adopted an attitude of giving priority to providing care. Young participants, in general, respected patient autonomy. However, paradoxically, when it comes to emergency medical cases, they expressed an opinion closer to paternalism. This study has found that prehospital emergency health professionals generally respect the patient's right to refuse treatment; however, they do not prioritize this right when there is a life-threatening situation or when the person does not have decision-making capacity. In these cases, prehospital emergency health professionals tended to adopt a more paternalistic approach.

The aim of this study was to implement an incident report (IR) system in prehospital emergency care management with a view to detecting errors occurring in this setting and guiding the implementation of safety improvement initiatives. An ad hoc IR form for the prehospital setting was developed and implemented within the EMDC of Verona. The form included six phases (from the emergency call to hospital admission) with the relevant list of potential error modes (30 items). This descriptive observational study considered the results from 268 consecutive days between February and November 2010. During the study period, 161 error modes were detected. The majority of these errors occurred in the resource allocation and timing phase (34.2%) and in the dispatch phase (31.0%). Most of the errors were due to human factors (77.6%), and almost half of them were classified as either moderate (27.9%) or severe (19.9%). These results guided the implementation of specific corrective actions, such as the adoption of a more efficient Medical Priority Dispatch System and the development of educational initiatives targeted at both EMDC staff and the population. Despite the intrinsic limits of IR methodology, results suggest how the implementation of an IR system dedicated to the emergency prehospital setting can act as a major driver for the development of a \"learning organization\" and improve both efficacy and safety of first aid care.\n\n(Non-)utilization of pre-hospital emergency care by migrants and non-migrants in Germany.\n\nPubMed\n\nKietzmann, Diana; Knuth, Daniela; Schmidt, Silke\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis study was designed to explore the utilization and non-utilization of pre-hospital emergency care by migrants and non-migrants, and the factors that influence this behaviour. A cross-sectional representative German survey was conducted in a sample of 2.175 people, 295 of whom had a migration background. An additional sample of 50 people with Turkish migration background was conducted, partially in the Turkish language. Apart from socio-demographics, the utilization of emergency services and the reasons for non-utilization were assessed. Migrants had a higher utilization rate of pre-hospital emergency care (RRÂ =Â 1.492) than non-migrants. Furthermore, migrants who were not born in Germany had a lower utilization rate (RRÂ =Â 0.793) than migrants who were born in Germany. Regarding non-utilization, the most frequently stated reasons belonged to the categories initial misjudgment of the emergency situation and acting on one's own behalf, with the latter stated more frequently by migrants than by non-migrants. To prevent over-, under-, and lack of supply, it is necessary to transfer knowledge about the functioning of the medical emergency services, including first aid knowledge.\n\nOrganizational health and quality of life: survey among ambulance nurses in prehospital emergency care.\n\nPubMed\n\nSili, A; Fida, Roberta; Vellone, E; Gianlorenzi, Alessandra; Alvaro, Rosaria\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe workplace plays a central role in causing stress and different kinds of syndromes and diseases. More generally, organizational procedures and practices could have an impact on nurses' quality of life. Although several studies have investigated this link, none of them considered nurses working in prehospital emergency care. To investigate the role of organizational health factors that affect the quality of life and psychosomatic complaints of ambulance nurses. Our sample included 411 ambulance nurses. Workers were administered two questionnaires to assess organizational health and quality of life. Descriptive and correlational analyses were used to test our assumptions. Several organizational health dimensions provided an explanation for the complaints reported by nurses working in prehospital emergency care in terms of quality of life and psychosomatic disorders. The results allowed identification of possible interventions focusing on specific duties and organizational aspects that would improve the quality of nurses' health.\n\n[Emergency care in the autonomous regions of Spain. Improvement in pre-hospital emergency care and welfare coordination. SESPAS Report 2012].\n\nPubMed\n\nMiguel GarcÃ­a, FÃ©lix; FernÃ¡ndez Quintana, Ana Isabel; DÃ­az Prats, Amadeo\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThe present article describes the general organization of pre-hospital emergency care in the autonomous regions and provides data on activity corresponding to 2010, drawn from the information available in the Primary Care Information System of the Ministry of Health, Social Policy and Equality. Emergency care is provided through various organizational structures covering 24-hour periods. Family medicine attended 17.8 million emergency consultations and nursing attended 10.2 million (year 2010, 14 autonomous communities, 79.7% of the National Health System population). Emergency department utilization ranged between 0.11 and 0.83 urgent family physician consultations per inhabitant/year and between 0.05 and 0.57 nursing consultations per inhabitant/year. Any reform in the management of pre-hospital emergency care will involve organizational changes and aims to produce measurable improvements in healthcare coordination. In the new organizational designs, most of the responsibility lies with human resources in order to achieve the new goals for the future aims to be presented in an operational teamwork structure. Undoubtedly, the main challenge is to achieve optimal coordination with other welfare levels, including the police, social services, nursing homes, etc. If optimal care of the population needs to count on the efforts of all these groups, mobility, individual differences, consistent achievement of high standards, and -most of all- the use of these services by citizens will determine the final result. The results can be quantified in various ways, but evaluation should concentrate on the resources used, the degree of satisfaction among all the parties involved and optimal management of demand, which will help to disseminate the need for a rational resource use.

It can help to minimize deaths, injuries, morbidities, disabilities and trauma caused by the road traffic incidents (RTIs). This study identifies the weaknesses and capacities affecting the pre-hospital emergency care for the victims of RTIs in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (GKMA). A cross-sectional study was conducted in the GKMA using a three-part structured questionnaire. Data related to the demographics, nature of RTIs and victims' pre-hospital experience and existing Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were collected from victims and EMS specialists in 3 hospitals and 5 EMS institutions respectively. Data was descriptively analyzed, and after the principal component analysis was employed to identify the most influential weaknesses and capacities affecting the pre-hospital emergency care for the victims of RTI in the GKMA. From 459 RTI victims (74.7% males and 25.3% females) and 23 EMS specialists (91.3% males and 8.7% females) who participated in the study between May and June 2016, 4 and 5 key weaknesses and capacities respectively were identified to affect the pre-hospital emergency care for RTI victims in the GKMA. Although some strengths exist like ambulance facilitation, EMS structuring, coordination and others), the key weaknesses affecting the pre-hospital care for victims were noted to relate to absence of predefined EMS systems particularly in the GKMA and Uganda as a whole. They were identified to involve poor quality first aid treatment; insufficient skills/training of the first responders; inadequate EMS resources; and avoidable delays to respond and transport RTI victims to medical facilities. Though some strengths exist, the weaknesses affecting prehospital care for RTI victims primarily emanate from the absence of predefined and well-organized EMS systems in the GKMA and Uganda as a whole.\n\nWhere there are no emergency medical services-prehospital care for the injured in Mumbai, India.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoy, Nobhojit; Murlidhar, V; Chowdhury, Ritam; Patil, Sandeep B; Supe, Priyanka A; Vaishnav, Poonam D; Vatkar, Arvind\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIn a populous city like Mumbai, which lacks an organized prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) system, there exists an informal network through which victims arrive at the trauma center. This baseline study describes the prehospital care and transportation that currently is available in Mumbai. A prospective trauma database was created by interviewing 170 randomly selected patients from a total of 454 admitted over a two-month period (July-August 2005) at a Level-I, urban, trauma center. The injured victim in Mumbai usually is rescued by a good Samaritan passer-by (43.5%) and contrary to popular belief, helped by the police (89.7%). Almost immediately after rescue, the victim begins transport to the hospital. No one waits for the EMS ambulance to arrive, as there is none. A taxi cab is the most popular substitute for the ambulance (39.3%). The trauma patient in India usually is a young man in his late-twenties, from a lower socioeconomic class. He mostly finds himself in a government hospital, as private hospitals are reluctant to provide trauma care to the seriously injured. The injured who do receive prehospital care receive inadequate and inappropriate care due to the high cost of consumables in resuscitation, and in part due to the providers' lack of training in emergency care. Those who were more likely to receive prehospital care suffered from road traffic injuries (odds ratio (OR) = 2.3) and those transported by government ambulances (OR = 10.83), as compared to railway accident victims (OR = 0 .41) and those who came by taxi (OR = 0.54). Currently, as a result of not having an EMS system, prehospital care is a citizen responsibility using societal networks. It is easy to eliminate this system and shift the responsibility to the state. The moot point is whether the state-funded EMS system will be robust enough in a resource-poor setting in which public hospitals are poorly funded. Considering the high funding cost of EMS systems in developed countries\n\n[Prehospital emergency care in Mexico City: the opportunities of the healthcare system].\n\nPubMed\n\nPinet, Luis M\n\n2005-01-01\n\nUnintentional vehicle traffic injuries cause 1.2 million preventable deaths per year worldwide, mostly affecting the population in their productive years of life. In Mexico, unintentional vehicle traffic injuries are one of the main causes of death; in Mexico City they account for 8% of deaths. Prehospital systems are set up to provide hospital medical care to the population, by means of a complex network that includes transportation, communications, resources (material, financial and human), and public participation. These systems may be designed in a variety of ways, depending on availability, capacity and quality of resources, according to specific community needs, always abiding by laws and regulations. In Mexico, several institutions and organizations offer prehospital services without being overseen in terms of coordination, regulation and performance evaluation, despite the high rates of morbidity and mortality due to injuries and preventable conditions amenable to effective therapy during the prehospital period. Prehospital care may contribute to decrease the morbidity and mortality rates of injuries requiring prompt medical care. Emphasis is made on the importance of assessing the performance of prehospital care, as well as on identification of needs for future development.\n\nClinical decision-making described by Swedish prehospital emergency care nurse students - An exploratory study.\n\nPubMed\n\nNilsson, Tomas; LindstrÃ¶m, Veronica\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the PECN students' clinical decision-making during a seven-week clinical rotation in the ambulance services. Developing expertise in prehospital emergency care practices requires both theoretical and empirical learning. A prehospital emergency care nurse (PECN) is a Registered Nurse (RN) with one year of additional training in emergency care. There has been little investigation of how PECN students describe their decision-making during a clinical rotation. A qualitative study design was used, and 12 logbooks written by the Swedish PECN students were analysed using content analysis. The students wrote about 997 patient encounters - ambulance assignments during their clinical rotation. Four themes emerged as crucial for the students' decision-making: knowing the patient, the context-situation awareness in the ambulance service, collaboration, and evaluation. Based on the themes, students made decisions on how to respond to patients' illnesses. The PECN students used several variables in their decision-making. The decision- making was an on-going process during the whole ambulance assignment. The university has the responsibility to guide the students during their transition from an RN to a PECN. The findings of the study can support the educators and clinical supervisors in developing the programme of study for becoming a PECN. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It evaluates the present state of prehospital care and recommends how change, via clinical governance, can ensure a paradigm shift from its currently fragmented state to a seamless ongoing patient care episode. Furthermore, it identifies the drivers of a quality revolution, examines the monitoring and supervision of quality care, and evaluates the role of evidence-based practice. A frank and open view of immediate care doctors is presented, with recommendations to improve the quality of skill delivery and reduce the disparity that exists. Finally, it reviews the current problems with pre-hospital care and projects a future course for quality and patient care excellence.

Previously, specific training in sports prehospital-immediate care was lacking or not of a comparable standard to other aspects of emergency care. Many principles have been drawn from general prehospital care or in-hospital training courses. This article discusses sports prehospital-immediate care as a niche of general prehospital care, using spinal injury management as an illustration of the major differences. It highlights the need to develop the sport-specific prehospital evidence base, rather than relying exclusively on considerations relevant to prolonged immobilisation of multiply injured casualties from motor vehicle accidents, falls from height or burns.\n\nDevelopment and Testing of an Algorithm for Efficient Resource Positioning in Pre-hospital Emergency Care\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSaini, Devashish; Mazza, Giovanni; Shah, Najaf; Mirza, Muzna; Gori, Mandar M; Nandigam, Hari Krishna; Orthner, Helmuth F\n\n2006-01-01\n\nResponse times for pre-hospital emergency care may be improved with the use of algorithms that analyzes historical patterns in incident location and suggests optimal places for prepositioning of emergency response units.

Majority of these deaths occur before arrival in the hospital and can be reduced with prompt and efficient prehospital care. The aim of this study was to highlight the burden of road traffic injury (RTI) in Lagos, Nigeria and assess the effectiveness of prehospital care, especially the role of Lagos State Ambulance Service (LASAMBUS) in providing initial care and transportation of the injured to the hospital. A three-year, retrospective review of road traffic injured patients seen at the Surgical Emergency Room (SER) of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja, Nigeria, from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014 was conducted. Parameters extracted from the Institution Trauma Registry included bio-data, date and time of injury, date and time of arrival in SER, host status, type of vehicle involved, and region(s) injured. Information on how patients came to the hospital and outcome in SER also were recorded. Results were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS; IBM Corporation; Armonk, New York USA) version 16. A total of 23,537 patients were seen during the study period. Among them, 16,024 (68.1%) had trauma. Road traffic crashes were responsible in 5,629 (35.0%) of trauma cases. Passengers constituted 42.0% of the injured, followed by pedestrians (34.0%). Four wheelers were the most frequent vehicle type involved (54.0%), followed by motor cycles (30.0%). Regions mainly affected were head and neck (40.0%) and lower limb (29.0%). Less than one-quarter (24.0%) presented to the emergency room within an hour, while one-third arrived between one and six hours following injury. Relatives brought 55.4%, followed by bystanders (21.4%). Only 2.3% had formal prehospital care and were brought to the hospital by LASAMBUS. They also had significantly shorter arrival time.

Few countries can afford the relatively expensive formalised Western model of a prehospital emergency medical system. The WHO has highlighted the development of layperson first responder programmes as the most basic step in the development of a functioning prehospital system. To describe the first training programme of its kind, run in Mahajanga, Madagascar. The faculty was invited by Mahajanga Medical School. Local input was taken into account in developing the curriculum. 26 taxi drivers were invited to attend in cooperation with the local municipality. The faculty consisted of five instructors from the Division of Emergency Medicine and EMSSA, plus local doctors from University Hospital Mahajanga. The 1-day course included workshops on prehospital scene management, bleeding and broken bones, immobilisation and patient movement, and labour and delivery. The workshops made use of commonly available items only including packets, string and towels; French and Malagasy translators were available throughout. Both faculty and candidates deemed the course a success and plans for formal evaluation of knowledge and skill retention are underway. Future plans are to continue the training using local instructors and in rural districts.\n\nPre-hospital policies for the care of patients with acute coronary syndromes in India: A policy document analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nPatel, Amisha; Prabhakaran, Dorairaj; Berendsen, Mark; Mohanan, P P; Huffman, Mark D\n\n2017-04-01\n\nIschemic heart disease is the leading cause of death in India. In high-income countries, pre-hospital systems of care have been developed to manage acute manifestations of ischemic heart disease, such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, it is unknown whether guidelines, policies, regulations, or laws exist to guide pre-hospital ACS care in India. We undertook a nation-wide document analysis to address this gap in knowledge. From November 2014 to May 2016, we searched for publicly available emergency care guidelines and legislation addressing pre-hospital ACS care in all 29 Indian states and 7 Union Territories via Internet search and direct correspondence. We found two documents addressing pre-hospital ACS care. Though India has legislation mandating acute care for emergencies such as trauma, regulations or laws to guide pre-hospital ACS care are largely absent. Policy makers urgently need to develop comprehensive, multi-stakeholder policies for pre-hospital emergency cardiovascular care in India. Copyright Â© 2016.

Given the increased interest in pediatric prehospital research, there is a need to identify specific research priorities that incorporate the perspective of prehospital providers and other emergency medical services (EMS) stakeholders. To develop a list of specific research priorities that is relevant, specific, and important to the practice of pediatric prehospital care. Three independent committees of EMS providers and researchers were recruited. Each committee developed a list of research topics. These topics were collated and used to initiate a modified Delphi process for developing consensus on a list of research priorities. Participants were the committee members. Topics approved by 80% were retained as research priorities. Topics that were rejected by more than 50% were eliminated. The remaining topics were modified and included on subsequent surveys. Each survey allowed respondents to add additional topics. The surveys were continued until all topics were either successfully retained or rejected and no new topics were suggested. Fifty topics were identified by the three independent committees. These topics were included on the initial electronic survey. There were 5 subsequent surveys. At the completion of the final survey a total of 29 research priorities were identified. These research priorities covered the following study areas: airway management, asthma, cardiac arrest, pain, patient-family interaction, resource utilization, seizure, sepsis, spinal immobilization, toxicology, trauma, training and competency, and vascular access. The research priorities were very specific. For example, under airway the priorities were: \"identify the optimal device for effectively managing the airway in the prehospital setting\" and \"identify the optimal airway management device for specific disease processes\n\nAcute cyanide poisoning in prehospital care: new challenges, new tools for intervention.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuidotti, Tee\n\n2006-01-01\n\nEffective management of cyanide poisoning from chemical terrorism, inhalation of fire smoke, and other causes constitutes a critical challenge for the prehospital care provider. The ability to meet the challenge of managing cyanide poisoning in the prehospital setting may be enhanced by the availability of the cyanide antidote hydroxocobalamin, currently under development for potential introduction in the United States. This paper discusses the causes, recognition, and management of acute cyanide poisoning in the prehospital setting with emphasis on the emerging profile of hydroxocobalamin, an antidote that may have a risk:benefit ratio suitable for empiric, out-of-hospital treatment of the range of causes of cyanide poisoning. If introduced in the U.S., hydroxocobalamin may enhance the role of the U.S. prehospital responder in providing emergency care in a cyanide incident.\n\nPrehospital emergency medicine services in Europe: structure and equipment.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuemer, G; Pernerstorfer, T; Mauritz, W\n\n1994-06-01\n\nIn order to get an update on prehospital emergency medicine practice all over Europe we submitted questionnaires with a total of 61 questions concerning prehospital emergency medicine in Europe, to 123 European members of the World Association of Emergency and Disaster Medicine (WAEDM). Sixty (49%) questionnaires were returned. One up to seven questionnaires from 22 European countries were analysed: 37 (62%) from urban and 23 (38%) suburban or rural areas; 12 being from former Eastern European countries. Sixteen of the questions--those concerning rescue systems and equipment--are analysed and presented in this paper. A fleet of ambulance cars staffed with paramedics/nurses based at the emergency organization is the most frequently used system in 59% (10/17) of the countries. The same percentage claims to have a ground-based coverage of its area of 80-100%. Airborne coverage between 80-100% and below 60% of the areas is given in the same percentage of 35% (6/17). Physicians are frequently involved in prehospital emergency care in the Eastern European Countries, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium and Turkey, rarely in Switzerland, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Greece, Ireland and Finland, never in the Netherlands and Sweden. In more than 50%, a combination of national, regional and local organizations provide emergency care, which results in large differences of standards. We discovered remarkable differences which could be overcome by enhanced co-ordination and information exchange provided by the European Society for Emergency Medicine, WAEDM, the European Red Cross or the European Academy of Anaesthesiologists.\n\nPrehospital trauma care: a clinical review.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeuran, M; Paun, S; Gaspar, B; Vartic, N; Hostiuc, S; Chiotoroiu, A; Negoi, I\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThere are many controversies related to the trauma patient care during the pre-hospital period nowadays. Due to the heterogeneity of the rescue personnel and variability of protocols used in various countries, the benefit of the prehospital advanced life support on morbidity and mortality has been not established. Systematic review of the literature using computer search of the Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health International PubMed Medline database using Entre interface.We reviewed the literature in what concerns the basic and advanced life support given to the trauma patients during the prehospital period. Although the organization of the medical emergency system varies from a country to another, the level of patient'scare can be classified into two main categories: Basic Life Support (BLS) and Advanced Life Support (ALS).There are many studies addressing what to be done at the scene.The prehospital care can be divided into two extremes: stay and play/treat then transfer or scoop and run/load and go. A balance between \"scoop and run\" and \"stay and play\" is probably the best approach for trauma patients. The chosen approach should be made according to the mechanism of injury (blunt versus penetrating trauma), distance to the trauma center (urban versus rural) and the available resources.

To improve timely patient care and expand provider scope of practice, nations leverage cellular phones and call centers for real-time online medical direction. However, there exist several barriers to adequate communication that impact the provision of emergency care. We sought to identify obstacles in the cellular communication process among GVK Emergency Management and Research Institute (GVK EMRI) EMTs in Gujarat, India. A convenience sample of practicing EMTs in Gujarat, India were surveyed regarding the barriers to call initiation and completion. 108 EMTs completed the survey. Overall, ninety-seven (89.8%) EMTs responded that the most common reason they did not initiate a call with the callÂ center physician was insufficient time. Forty-six (42%) EMTs reported that they were unable to call the physician one or more times during a typical workweek (approximately 5-6 twelve-hour shifts/week) due to their hands being occupied performing direct patient care. Fifty-eight (54%) EMTs reported that they were unable to reach the callÂ center physician, despite attempts, at least once a week. This study identified multiple barriers to communication, including insufficient time to call for advice and inability to reach callÂ center physicians. Identification of simple interventions and best practices may improve communication and ensure timely and appropriate prehospital care.\n\nMobile prehospital emergency care: an analysis of implementation in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nO'Dwyer, Gisele; Machado, Cristiani Vieira; Alves, Renan Paes; Salvador, Fernanda GonÃ§alves\n\n2016-06-01\n\nMobile prehospital care is a key component of emergency care.

The methodology employed included document analysis, visits to six SAMU emergency call centers, and semistructured interviews conducted with 12 local and state emergency care coordinators. The study's conceptual framework was based on Giddens' theory of structuration. Intergovernmental conflicts were observed between the state and municipal governments, and between municipal governments. Despite the shortage of hospital beds, the SAMUs in periphery regions were better integrated with the emergency care network than the metropolitan SAMUs. The steering committees were not very active and weaknesses were observed relating to the limited role played by the state government in funding, management, and monitoring. It was concluded that the SAMU implementation process in the state was marked by political tensions and management and coordination weaknesses. As a result, serious drawbacks remain in the coordination of the SAMU with the other health services and the regionalization of emergency care in the state.\n\nPrehospital paediatric emergencies treated by an Australian helicopter emergency medical service.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarker, Claire L; Weatherall, Andrew D\n\n2014-04-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to describe the mechanism and severity of injuries in the paediatric population treated by an Australian helicopter emergency medical service and to examine the frequency and nature of interventions performed. This information is important for planning education and continuing professional development in prehospital medicine. The study is a retrospective cohort analysis of 349 patients under the age of 16 treated by CareFlight in Sydney, Australia, between April 2007 and April 2012. Data collected included age, type of incident, medication and fluid administered, procedures performed, receiving hospital, 24 h and 30-day mortality and injuries sustained. Falls (33%), motor vehicle incidents (30%), sport injury (14%) and immersion injury (12%) were the most common mechanisms. A total of 27 children died within 30 days; nontrauma cases were proportionally overrepresented in the deaths. With respect to tasking, 59% cases involved a severely or significantly injured child. Among the children, 97% with a traumatic mechanism were transferred directly to a paediatric trauma centre.In addition, 81% of children had at least one intervention by the helicopter emergency medical services team at the incident scene, most commonly intravenous cannulation (61%), crystalloid bolus (29%), intubation (21%) and intravenous analgesia administration (15%). Paediatric prehospital patients can be of high dependency, requiring urgent critical care procedures. Training in prehospital medicine should include paediatrics. It is essential that practitioners maintain skills in venous access, airway management and provision of adequate analgesia in children.\n\nNovel wireless electroencephalography system with a minimal preparation time for use in emergencies and prehospital care\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Although clinical applications such as emergency medicine and prehospital care could benefit from a fast-mounting electroencephalography (EEG) recording system, the lack of specifically designed equipment restricts the use of EEG in these environments. Methods This paper describes the design and testing of a six-channel emergency EEG (emEEG) system with a rapid preparation time intended for use in emergency medicine and prehospital care. The novel system comprises a quick-application cap, a device for recording and transmitting the EEG wirelessly to a computer, and custom software for displaying and streaming the data in real-time to a hospital. Bench testing was conducted, as well as healthy volunteer and patient measurements in three different environments: a hospital EEG laboratory, an intensive care unit, and an ambulance. The EEG data was evaluated by two experienced clinical neurophysiologists and compared with recordings from a commercial system. Results The bench tests demonstrated that the emEEG system's performance is comparable to that of a commercial system while the healthy volunteer and patient measurements confirmed that the system can be applied quickly and that it records quality EEG data in a variety of environments. Furthermore, the recorded data was judged to be of diagnostic quality by two experienced clinical neurophysiologists. Conclusions In the future, the emEEG system may be used to record high-quality EEG data in emergency medicine and during ambulance transportation. Its use could lead to a faster diagnostic, a more accurate treatment, and a shorter recovery time for patients with neurological brain disorders.

The timely and adequate management including quick referral of the trauma patient into a designated trauma center may limit secondary injury and may thus improve outcomes already during the prehospital phase of care. The professional treatment of multiple injured trauma patients begins at the scene in the context of a well structured prehospital emergency medical system. The \"Primary Survey\" is performed by the emergency physician at the scene according to the Prehospital Trauma Life Support (PHTLS)-concept. The overall aim is to rapidly assess and treat life-threatening conditions even in the absence of patient history and diagnosis (\"treat-first-what-kills-first\"). If no immediate treatment is necessary, a \"Secondary Sur- vey\" follows with careful and structured body examination and detailed assessment of the trauma mechanism. Massive and life-threatening states of hemorrhage should be addressed immediately even disregarding the ABCDE-scheme. Critical trauma patients should be referred without any delay (\"work and go\")toTR-DGUÂ® certified trauma centers of the local trauma networks. Due to the difficult pre- hospital environment the number of quality studies in the field is low and, as consequence, the level of evidence for most recommendations is also low. Much information has been obtained from different care systems and the interchangeability of results is limited. The present article provides a synopsis of rec- ommendations for early prehospital care for the severely injured based upon the 2011 updated multi- disciplinary S3-Guideline \"Polytrauma/Schwerstverletzten Behandlung\", the most recently updated European Trauma guideline and the current PHTLS-algorithms including grades of recommendation whenever possible.\n\nThe identification of criteria to evaluate prehospital trauma care using the Delphi technique.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosengart, Matthew R; Nathens, Avery B; Schiff, Melissa A\n\n2007-03-01\n\nCurrent trauma system performance improvement emphasizes hospital- and patient-based outcome measures such as mortality and morbidity, with little focus upon the processes of prehospital trauma care. Little data exist to suggest which prehospital criteria should serve as potential filters. This study identifies the most important filters for auditing prehospital trauma care using a Delphi technique to achieve consensus of expert opinion. Experts in trauma care from the United States (n = 81) were asked to generate filters of potential utility in monitoring the prehospital aspect of the trauma system, and were then required to rank these questions in order of importance to identify those of greatest importance. Twenty-eight filters ranking in the highest tertile are proposed. The majority (54%) pertains to aspects of emergency medical services, which comprise 7 of the top 10 (70%) filters. Triage filters follow in priority ranking, comprising 29% of the final list. Filters concerning interfacility transfers and transportation ranked lowest. This study identifies audit filters representing the most important aspects of prehospital trauma care that merit continued evaluation and monitoring. A subsequent trial addressing the utility of these filters could potentially enhance the sensitivity of identifying deviations in prehospital care, standardize the performance improvement process, and translate into an improvement in patient care and outcome.\n\nQuality Indicators for Evaluating Prehospital Emergency Care: A Scoping Review.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoward, Ian; Cameron, Peter; Wallis, Lee; Castren, Maaret; Lindstrom, Veronica\n\n2018-02-01\n\nIntroduction Historically, the quality and performance of prehospital emergency care (PEC) has been assessed largely based on surrogate, non-clinical endpoints such as response time intervals or other crude measures of care (eg, stakeholder satisfaction). However, advances in Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems and services world-wide have seen their scope and reach continue to expand. This has dictated that novel measures of performance be implemented to compliment this growth. Significant progress has been made in this area, largely in the form of the development of evidence-informed quality indicators (QIs) of PEC. Problem Quality indicators represent an increasingly popular component of health care quality and performance measurement. However, little is known about the development of QIs in the PEC environment. The purpose of this study was to assess the development and characteristics of PEC-specific QIs in the literature. A scoping review was conducted through a search of PubMed (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, Maryland USA); EMBase (Elsevier; Amsterdam, Netherlands); CINAHL (EBSCO Information Services; Ipswich, Massachusetts USA); Web of Science (Thomson Reuters; New York, New York USA); and the Cochrane Library (The Cochrane Collaboration; Oxford, United Kingdom). To increase the sensitivity of the literature, a search of the grey literature and review of select websites was additionally conducted. Articles were selected that proposed at least one PEC QI and whose aim was to discuss, analyze, or promote quality measurement in the PEC environment. The majority of research (n=25 articles) was published within the last decade (68.0%) and largely originated within the USA (68.0%). Delphi and observational methodologies were the most commonly employed for QI development (28.0%). A total of 331 QIs were identified via the article review, with an additional 15 QIs identified via the website review.

Survey using telephone interviews. Emergency physicians on duty in the 37 emergency departments in charge of prehospital care in Paris area were called by one investigator. They were asked to answer a questionnaire about their own use of mannitol in the prehospital setting. Ninety-six questionnaires were recorded. Physicians were anaesthesiologists (9%) or emergency physicians (87%). In three departments, mannitol was not available in the ambulances. Thirty-five per cent (n = 34) reported no use of mannitol and 17% (n = 16) just once. Fourteen physicians (15%) did not want to use it. The reasons for not using mannitol were lack of knowledge about efficacy for five, need for previous brain imaging for seven or neurosurgeon's agreement before using mannitol for three. For those who had already used mannitol or were ready to use it, the main indication was increased intracranial pressure with clinical signs of brain herniation after severe brain injury for 92% of physicians. Thirty-one % reported not knowing the dose of mannitol, 33% having a memorandum immediately available and among those who answered the question, 63% gave a value compatible with guidelines. A significant percentage of physicians tacking part in the French prehospital care system, do not follow published guidelines on the use of mannitol. Actions improving implementation of those guidelines should be supported.\n\n[Miscommunication as a risk focus in patient safety : Work process analysis in prehospital emergency care].\n\nPubMed\n\nWilk, S; Siegl, L; Siegl, K; Hohenstein, C\n\n2018-04-01\n\nIn an analysis of aÂ critical incident reporting system (CIRS) in out-of-hospital emergency medicine, it was demonstrated that in 30% of cases deficient communication led to aÂ threat to patients; however, the analysis did not show what exactly the most dangerous work processes are. Current research shows the impact of poor communication on patient safety. An out-of-hospital workflow analysis collects data about key work processes and risk areas. The analysis points out confounding factors for aÂ sufficient communication. Almost 70% of critical incidents are based on human factors. Factors, such as communication and teamwork have an impact but fatigue, noise levels and illness also have aÂ major influence. (I)Â CIRS database analysis The workflow analysis was based on 247 CIRS cases. This was completed by participant observation and interviews with emergency doctors and paramedics. The 247 CIRS cases displayed 282 communication incidents, which are categorized into 6 subcategories of miscommunication. One CIRS case can be classified into different categories if more communication incidents were validated by the reviewers and four experienced emergency physicians sorted these cases into six subcategories. (II)Â Workflow analysis The workflow analysis was carried out between 2015 and 2016 in Jena and Berlin, Germany. The focal point of research was to find accumulation of communication risks in different parts of prehospital patient care. During 30â¯h driving with emergency ambulances, the author interviewed 12Â members of the emergency medical service of whichÂ 5 were emergency physicians and 7Â paramedics. A total of 11Â internal medicine cases and one automobile accident were monitored. After patient care the author asked in aÂ 15-min interview if miscommunication or communication incidents occurred. (I)Â CIRS analysis Between 2005 and 2015, 845 reports were reported to the database. The experts identified 247 incident reports with communication failure. All\n\nMediating Systems of Care: Emergency Calls to Long-Term Care Facilities at Life's End.\n\nPubMed\n\nWaldrop, Deborah P; McGinley, Jacqueline M; Clemency, Brian\n\n2018-04-09\n\nNursing home (NH) residents account for over 2.2 million emergency department visits yearly; the majority are cared for and transported by prehospital providers (emergency medical technicians and paramedics). The purpose of this study was to investigate prehospital providers' perceptions of emergency calls at life's end. This article focuses on perceptions of end-of-life calls in long-term care (LTC). This pilot study employed a descriptive cross-sectional design. Concepts from the symbolic interaction theory guided the exploration of perceptions and interpretations of emergency calls in LTC facilities. A purposeful sample of prehospital providers was developed from one agency in a small northeastern U.S. city. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 43 prehospital providers to explore their perceptions of factors that trigger emergency end-of-life calls in LTC facilities. Qualitative data analysis involved iterative coding in an inductive process that included open, systematic, focused, and axial coding. Interview themes illustrated the contributing factors as follows: care crises; dying-related turmoil; staffing ratios; and organizational protocols. Distress was crosscutting and present in all four themes. The findings illuminate how prehospital providers become mediators between NHs and emergency departments by managing tension, conflict, and challenges in patient care between these systems and suggest the importance of further exploration of interactions between LTC staff, prehospital providers, and emergency departments. Enhanced communication between LTC facilities and prehospital providers is important to address potentially inappropriate calls and transport requests and to identify means for collaboration in the care of sick frail residents.\n\nThe prehospital emergency care system in Mexico City: a system's performance evaluation.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeralta, Luis Mauricio Pinet\n\n2006-01-01\n\nMexico City has one of the highest mortality rates in Mexico, with non-intentional injuries as a leading cause of death among persons 1-44 years of age. Emergency medical services (EMS) in Mexico can achieve high levels of efficiency by offering high quality medical care at a low cost through adequate system design. The objective of this study was to determine whether the prehospital EMS system in Mexico City meets the criteria standards established by the American Ambulance Association Guide for Contracting Emergency Medical Services (AAA Guide) for highly efficient EMS systems. This retrospective, descriptive study, evaluated the structure of Mexico City's EMS system and analyzed EMS response times, clinical capacity, economic efficiency, and customer satisfaction. These results were compared with the AAA guide, according to the soc ial, economic, and political context in Mexico. This paper describes the healthcare system structure in Mexico, followed by a description of the basic structure of EMS in Mexico City, and of each tenet described in the AAA guide. The p aper includesdata obtained from official documents and databases of government agencies, and operative and administrative data from public and private EMS providers. The quality of the data for response times (RT) were insufficient and widely varied among providers, with a minimum RT of 6.79 minutes (min) and a maximum RT of 61 min. Providers did not define RT clearly, and measured it with averages, which can hide potentially poor performance practices. Training institutions are not required to follow a standardized curriculum. Certifications are the responsibility of the individual training centers and have no government regulation. There was no evidence of active medical control involvement in direct patient care, and providers did not report that quality assurance programs were in place. There also are limited career advancement opportunities for EMS personnel. Small economies of scale may not allow\n\nLow oxygen saturation is associated with pre-hospital mortality among non-traumatic patients using emergency medical services: A national database of Thailand.\n\nPubMed\n\nSittichanbuncha, Yuwares; Savatmongkorngul, Sorrawit; Jawroongrit, Puchong; Sawanyawisuth, Kittisak\n\n2015-09-01\n\nPre-hospital emergency medical services are an important network for Emergency Medicine. It has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality of patients by medical procedures. The Thai government established pre-hospital emergency medical services in 2008 to improve emergency medical care. Since then, there are limited data at the national level on mortality rates with pre-hospital care and the risk factors associated with mortality in non-traumatic patients. To study the pre-hospital mortality rate and factors associated with mortality in non-traumatic patients using the emergency medical service in Thailand. This study retrieved medical data from the National Institute for Emergency Medicine, NIEMS. The inclusion criteria were adult patients above the age of 15 who received medical services by the emergency medical services in Thailand (except Bangkok) from April 1st, 2011 to March 31st, 2012. Patients were excluded if there was no treatment during pre-hospital period, if they were trauma patients, or if their medical data was incomplete. Patients were categorized as either in the survival or non-survival group. Factors associated with mortality were examined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. During the study period, there were 127,602 non-traumatic patients who used pre-hospital emergency medical services in Thailand. Of those, 98,587 patients met the study criteria. For the statistical analyses, there were 66,760 patients who had complete clinical investigations. The mortality rate in this group was 1.89%. Only oxygen saturation was associated with mortality by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The adjusted OR was 0.922 (95% CI 0.8550.994). Low oxygen saturation is significantly associated with pre-hospital mortality in a national database of non-traumatic patients using emergency medical services in Thailand. During pre-hospital care, oxygen level should be monitored and promptly treated. Pulse oximetry devices should be available in all\n\nThe prehospital intravenous access assessment: a prospective study on intravenous access failure and access delay in prehospital emergency medicine.\n\nPubMed\n\nProttengeier, Johannes; Albermann, Matthias; Heinrich, Sebastian; Birkholz, Torsten; Gall, Christine; Schmidt, Joachim\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIntravenous access in prehospital emergency care allows for early administration of medication and extended measures such as anaesthesia. Cannulation may, however, be difficult, and failure and resulting delay in treatment and transport may have negative effects on the patient. Therefore, our study aims to perform a concise assessment of the difficulties of prehospital venous cannulation. We analysed 23 candidate predictor variables on peripheral venous cannulations in terms of cannulation failure and exceedance of a 2âmin time threshold. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted for variables of predictive value (P<0.25) and evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC>0.6) of their respective receiver operating characteristic curve. A total of 762 intravenous cannulations were enroled. In all, 22% of punctures failed on the first attempt and 13% of punctures exceeded 2âmin. Model selection yielded a three-factor model (vein visibility without tourniquet, vein palpability with tourniquet and insufficient ambient lighting) of fair accuracy for the prediction of puncture failure (AUC=0.76) and a structurally congruent model of four factors (failure model factors plus vein visibility with tourniquet) for the exceedance of the 2âmin threshold (AUC=0.80). Our study offers a simple assessment to identify cases of difficult intravenous access in prehospital emergency care. Of the numerous factors subjectively perceived as possibly exerting influences on cannulation, only the universal - not exclusive to emergency care - factors of lighting, vein visibility and palpability proved to be valid predictors of cannulation failure and exceedance of a 2âmin threshold.\n\nThe 2017 International Joint Working Group White Paper by INDUSEM, the Emergency Medicine Association and the Academic College of Emergency Experts on Establishing Standardized Regulations, Operational Mechanisms, and Accreditation Pathways for Education and Care Provided by the Prehospital Emergency Medical Service Systems in India\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSikka, Veronica; Gautam, V.; Galwankar, Sagar; Guleria, Randeep; Stawicki, Stanislaw P.; Paladino, Lorenzo; Chauhan, Vivek; Menon, Geetha; Shah, Vijay; Srivastava, R. P.; Rana, B. K.; Batra, Bipin; Kalra, OP.; Aggarwal, P.; Bhoi, Sanjeev; Krishnan, S. Vimal\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe government of India has done remarkable work on commissioning a government funded prehospital emergency ambulance service in India. This has both public health implications and an economic impact on the nation. With the establishment of these services, there is an acute need for standardization of education and quality assurance regarding prehospital care provided. The International Joint Working Group has been actively involved in designing guidelines and establishing a comprehensive framework for ensuring high-quality education and clinical standards of care for prehospital services in India. This paper provides an independent expert opinion and a proposed framework for general operations and administration of a standardized, national prehospital emergency medical systems program. Program implementation, operational details, and regulations will require close collaboration between key stakeholders, including local, regional, and national governmental agencies of India.

Emergency medical services and emergency department personnel commonly address the health care needs of patients with ASD at times of crisis. Unfortunately, there is little education provided to front-line emergency medical technicians, paramedics and emergency nurses on the characteristics of ASD and how these characteristics can create challenges for individuals with ASD and their health care providers in the pre-hospital and emergency department settings. This paper describes the development of educational materials on ASD and the results of training of emergency medical services and emergency department personnel.\n\nPrehospital telemedicine electrocardiogram triage for a regional public emergency medical service: is it worth it? A preliminary cost analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrunetti, Natale Daniele; Dellegrottaglie, Giulia; Lopriore, Claudio; Di Giuseppe, Giuseppe; De Gennaro, Luisa; Lanzone, Saverio; Di Biase, Matteo\n\n2014-03-01\n\nTelemedicine has been shown to improve quality of health-care delivery in several fields of medicine; its cost-effectiveness, however, is still a matter of debate. Pre-hospital telemedicine electrocardiogram triage for regional public emergency medical service may reduce costs. An economic evaluation (cost analysis) was performed from the perspective of regional health-care system. Patients enrolled in the study and considered for cost analysis were those who called the local emergency medical service (EMS; dialing 1-1-8) during 2012 and underwent prehospital field triage with a telemedicine electrocardiogram (ECG) in the case of suspected acute cardiac disease (acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia). The prehospital ECGs were read by a remote cardiologist, available 24/7. Cost savings associated with this method were calculated by subtracting the cost of prehospital triage with telemedicine support from the cost of conventional emergency department triage (ECG and consultation by a cardiologist). During 2012, the regional EMS performed 109â750 ECGs by telemedicine support. The associated total cost for the regional health-care system was â¬1â833â333, with a â¬16.70 cost per single ECG/consultation. Given the cost of similar conventional emergency department treatment from a regional rate list of â¬24.80 to â¬55.20, the savings was â¬8.10 to â¬38.40 per ECG/consultation (total savings, â¬891â759.50 to â¬4â219â379.50). The cost for ruling out an acute cardiac disease was â¬25.30; for a prehospital diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, â¬49.20. With 629 prehospital diagnoses of ST-elevation myocardial infarction and reported reductions in mortality thanks to prehospital diagnosis deduced from prior studies, 69 lives per year presumably could be saved, with a cost per quality-adjusted life year gained of â¬1927, â¬990/â¬â-â2508 after correction for potential savings. Prehospital EMS triage with telemedicine ECG in patients with suspected\n\nCase reports and case series in prehospital emergency care research.\n\nPubMed\n\nPatterson, P Daniel; Weaver, Matthew; Clark, Sunday; Yealy, Donald M\n\n2010-11-01\n\nResearch begins with a clearly stated question, problem or hypothesis.
