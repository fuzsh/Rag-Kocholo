        "text": "San Jose Earthquakes\n\nPlayers in: D Paulo Renato, Marvell Wynne; M Leandro Barrera, Sanna Nyassi, Fatai Alashe; F Innocent Emeghara, Mark Sherrod\n\nOut: GK Jon Busch, Billy Knutsen; D Jason Hernandez, Andreas Gorlitz, Tommy Muller, M Atiba Harris, Yannick Djalo, Sam Cronin; F Billy Schuler\n\nSummary: San Jose will be hoping the opening of their new Avaya Stadium will help fans to forget the misery of 2014, when they sank to a club-record 16 defeats and a last-place finish in the Western Conference.\n\nNew boss Dominic Kinnear – returning to the area after being an assistant and then head coach from 2001-05, after which the franchise moved to Houston – will certainly aim to re-create the golden days of two MLS titles in three seasons and a stronger presence in the league than they have managed in the past six years, with just two playoff appearances.\n\nAs well as a new head coach and stadium, the Earthquakes also possess a promising new designated player in the form of Swiss international striker Innocent Emeghara, who will be counted on to improve the team’s miserable goalscoring record last time out, when only Chivas USA managed fewer.\n\nUS international Chris Wondolowski managed 14 goals either side of his World Cup duty but will hope to get closer to his 2012 form when he was the league’s joint record scorer with 27. While the return to fitness of the team’s third DP, diminutive Argentine midfielder Matias Perez Garcia (who suffered a season-ending knee injury last August just six games into his MLS career), should also be a major boost to San Jose’s attacking potential.\n\nUncapped 25-year-old American David Bingham will take over in goal for departed veteran Jon Busch. Another injured warrior should return to play a key role in front of him, with Clarence Goodson aiming to resume his center-back pairing with Honduran Victor Bernardez. Goodson made just 10 league appearances last year before toe problems sidelined him, but he looks set to be fully fit from the start this year.\n\nKinnear has worked hard to bring in some younger, speedier squad members, several of whom could make the opening day line-up, notably new right-back Marvell Wynne and Argentinean midfielder Leandro Barrera. Portuguese prospect Paulo Renato could also be a valuable pick-up if either of Goodson or Bernardez are again hit by the injury jinx, which saw five different starters miss extended periods in 2014.\n\nTop draft pick Fatai Alashe – selected No4 overall – waits in the wings to add his youth and energy to the midfield cause, and the Michigan State product could be a handy back-up to the incumbent holding duo of Sam Cronin and Jean-Baptiste Pierazzi.\n\nLast season: 9th in Western Conference\n\nPrediction: Just about anything is going to be better than 2014, but Kinnear faces a tall order to snatch a playoff spot with so many new pieces and players returning from lengthy injury lay-offs. But if Wondolowski rekindles his spirit of 2012, the Quakes could sneak into fifth or sixth. SV\n\nSeattle Sounders FC\n\nPlayers in: GK Troy Perkins; D Tyrone Mears, Andres Correa; M Cristian Roldan; F Victor Mansaray, Darwin Jone, Andy Craven\n\nOut: GK Marcus Hahnemann, Josh Ford; D Onyekachi Apam, Djimi Traore, Jalil Anibaba, DeAndre Yedlin, Eriq Zavaleta; M Sean Okoli; F Sean Okoli, Cam Weaver, Tristan Bowen\n\nSummary: After seeing his team scrape into and crash out of the 2013 playoffs, Sigi Schmid was under unprecedented pressure in the off-season. But while the 2014 season didn’t deliver the long sought MLS Cup or even an MLS Cup final appearance, it did deliver a first ever Supporters’ Shield, the return of the Sounders’ beloved US Open Cup and an accompanying route back to the Champions League. This was a probably a rather more relaxed off-season for Seattle’s seventh-year coach.\n\n“If it ain’t broke” is the offensive theme. The strike force of Obafemi Martins and Clint Dempsey was deadly for much of last year and the supporting cast, when called on, suggested Schmid had learned his lessons from the time when the attacking dimensions could be summed up by the phrase “Fredy Montero”. Strength and variety in depth marked the Sounders attack, with Lamar Neagle, Chad Barrett and Kenny Cooper all playing a part. No big changes on that front.\n\nWhere the questions lie are perhaps further back, where of course DeAndre Yedlin has gone to Spurs and veteran goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann has retired. Troy Perkins has come in as a goalkeeping option, and Colombian Andres Correa brings wide defensive cover, though he’s naturally a left back. But like a certain US national team starlet, he likes to get forward at pace, so perhaps Yedlin’s loss can be somewhat compensated for on the other flank.\n\nPerhaps the real key to the Sounders’ fortunes this year will be the performances of Ossie Alonso – still probably the best defensive midfielder in the league but one who began to give the impression of dropping from his peak last season. The promising draft pack Cristian Roldan may develop to be a useful central midfielder, but is likely to not be ready for prime time for a while yet. Still, Seattle look solid across the field, and even if Alonso merely plateaus that should still be enough to keep the Sounders up there near the top of the West as the team to beat.\n\nLast season: 1st in Western Conference; conference finalists\n\nPrediction: Another high finish in the West. Another Cup run. And possibly another creative midfielder in the summer to help clear the hurdle they’ve always fallen at. GP\n\nSporting Kansas City\n\nPlayers in: GK Luis Marin, Tim Melia; D Jalil Anibaba, Saad Abdul-Salaam, Amadou Dia, Marcel de Jong; M Bernardo Anor, James Marcelin, Roger Espinoza, Connor Hallisey, Servando Carrasco, Soni Mustivar; F Krisztian Nemeth, James Ansu Rogers\n\nOut: GK Andy Gruenebaum, Eric Kronberg; D Christian Duke, Aurelien Collin, Igor Juliao; M Antonio Dovale, Michael Kafari, Victor Munoz, Lawrence Olum, Sal Zizzo, Martin Steuble, James Marcelin, Jorge Claros; F Claudio Bieler, Soony Saad, CJ Sapong\n\nSummary: The wheels fell off the high octane Sporting KC side last year as battles on multiple fronts, combined with injuries, suspensions, fixture pile-up and World Cup absences, saw Sporting limp over the line. A final-day home loss to the Red Bulls forced them on the road to New York for the wild card game, where Dom Dwyer’s goal was not enough to save a visibly tiring Sporting side from shipping two late goals and crashing out.\n\nIn truth it looked like something of a mercy. “We just ran out of bodies” was Peter Vermes post-game, indeed post-season verdict. His US World Cup players Matt Besler and Graham Zusi looked particularly exhausted. Besler in particular spent the second half of the season looking as if he was still flailing in Romelu Lukaku’s wake.\n\nAnd a lot will depend on Besler in particular this season. For one thing his defensive partner has gone: Aurelien Collin was traded to Orlando City in the off-season, though in truth 2014 wasn’t the French defender’s best year anyway, as he played his part in the errors that made Sporting’s defense look uncharacteristically sloppy at times. He might not have been helped by the season ending injury to full back Chance Myers, in fairness. Myers is slowly working his way back to fitness. Sporting need him.\n\nAnd if their high tempo 4-3-3 is to persist they’ll need to look carefully at the midfield fulcrums. There’s a fair argument that Sporting never recovered from the loss of the all-running Roger Espinoza, let alone Ori Rosell. So perhaps it’s good news that Espinoza’s back after his mixed fortunes with Wigan, though it would possibly be rather more exciting news if the recent rumors of Sporting meeting with Rafael Van der Vaart’s representatives in Europe have any truth to them.\n\nElsewhere Sporting had a busy draft, and have generally looked to be doing fairly thorough roster makeovers throughout their depth positions. Dwyer is back for another season leading the line and with his guile in the box, it’s possible that Vermes might consider the team that got worn ragged last year. One option: to vary the tempo a little, holding the ball longer and slipping it behind defenses for Dwyer to feed on.\n\nLast season: 5th in Eastern Conference; lost in play-in round\n\nPrediction: It’s looking like a transitional year in a new, and tougher, conference. Early on Vermes will settle for some recognizable discipline from his team in the belief that results will follow. With six playoff places available it isn’t impossible Sporting take one, but an adjustment period looks more likely. GP\n\nToronto FC\n\nPlayers in: GK Alex Bono; D Damien Perquis, Eriq Zavaleta; M Marco Delgado, Daniel Lovitz, Jay Chapman, F Robbie Findley, Benoit Cheyrou; M/F Sebastian Giovinco; F Jozy Altidore\n\nOut: D Doneil Henry, Bradley Orr, Ryan Richter; M Daniel Lovitz, Jeremy Hall, Kyle Bekker; F Andrew Wiedeman, Jermain Defoe, Dominic Oduro, Gilberto, Dwayne De Rosario\n\nSummary: It’s become something of an old joke among hardened Toronto FC fans: their club is the only team in the league that knows how to win the MLS Cup in January. That’s because at this same time last year, the team rolled out a major PR campaign involving the unexpected signing of two bona fide stars in Jermain Defoe and Michael Bradley, which featured a double-decker bus blazoned with the words “A Bloody Big Deal” parked outside their unveiling at a downtown Toronto press conference.\n\nA year later, Toronto FC have still yet to make the MLS playoffs since their inaugural season in 2007, Defoe has moved back to Sunderland and the Premier League after injury and rumours of disquiet derailed the second half of his season, and Bradley never quite hit the heights many expected he would in a World Cup year.\n\nIf you thought, however, that this would pressure the club to go for a quieter, 2014 DC United-style rebuild, you would be incorrect. Though the media fanfare has been dispensed with this time around, Toronto FC have had another banner off-season, pulling in Jozy Altidore in return for Defoe, picking up the playmaking midfielder Benoit Cheyrou from Marseille, adding a strong defender in Poland’s Damien Perquis, and somehow nabbing Sebastian Giovinco from Juventus.\n\nThe latter deal in particular turned heads throughout the league. While Defoe was a known commodity, he was 31 years old when joined MLS. Giovinco is in his prime at 28, with 21 caps for the Italian national team. If he follows through on his incredible promise – always an open question for Toronto – along with Bradley, Altidore and Cheyrou, TFC should have one of the more threatening midfields in MLS.\n\nIndeed, if this were literally any other club, most would predict Toronto to easily make the playoffs. And yet we’ve been down this road before only for the inevitable collapse, round of firings and hirings, and plenty of promises it will be better next time. After eight seasons – eight – of disappointment, it’s hard to tell how much goodwill the club has left to burn.\n\nLast season: 7th in Eastern Conference\n\nPrediction: If Toronto FC can’t make the playoffs with this team after eight attempts, the league should consider introducing relegation. RW\n\nVancouver Whitecaps FC\n\nPlayers in: D Diego Rodriguez, Pa Modou Kah; M Marco Bustos, Ben McKendry, Deybi Flores; F Octavio Rivero\n\nOut: D Jay DeMerit, Carlyle Mitchell, Andy O’Brien, Johnny Leveron; M Bryce Alderson, Mehdi Ballouchy, Sebastian Fernandez; F Omar Salgado, Mamadou Diouf\n\nSummary: One of the more entertaining battles in the dying stages of the 2014 regular season in MLS was the tussle for the final playoff spot between the two Cascadian rivals: the Portland Timbers and the Vancouver Whitecaps. Despite an overall lack of goals last year – Vancouver only managed to net 42, fewer than the Colorado Rapids and Toronto FC – Carl Robinson’s Whitecaps played some adventurous football in the final month of play, with Mauro Rosales’ adroit passes complimenting the speed and skill of Kekuta Manneh and Pedro Morales up front. The Caps won four of their five final matches to steal the final playoff spot from Portland, only to lose against FC Dallas in the play-in. Though the signs of life were brief, Vancouver ended the season with the promise of better things to come in 2015.\n\nThe biggest challenge for the club however will be to score a lot more often, and this is where Robinson has made some interesting additions. One of his innovations last season was to bring in the 6ft5in Costa Rican center-half Kendall Waston from Saprissa in August, which added some guile to Vancouver’s set-piece play. He’s now doubled his advantage by acquiring the Timbers’ defender Pa Modou Kah – the player has already impressed in pre-season warm ups – with Uruguayan defender Diego Rodriguez poised to help fill the gap left by out-of-contract defender Andy O’Brien. Vancouver will need to preserve their impressiv defensive record if they want to have any hope of making to the playoffs in a Western Conference that now features two of the traditionally stronger sides in the East: Houston and Sporting KC.\n\nHowever as a rule, teams shouldn’t rely on well-executed set plays to survive the season, and this is where Robinson still has some work left to go as kickoff draws near. His only major acquisition up front so far in the off-season has been the 23-year-old Uruguayan forward Octavio Rivero, who scored 10 goals in 16 appearances last season for Chilean club O’Higgins FC. Rivero needs to play a significant role in helping out Morales up front if Vancouver hopes to make solid progress on last season. Apart from that, with the successful midfield pairing of Gershon Koffie and Matias Laba, and Steven Beitashour and Jordan Harvey as starting full backs, Vancouver have a very good, if not great, team.\n\nLast season: 5th in Western Conference; lost in conference play-in round"
