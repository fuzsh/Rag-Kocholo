        "text": "January 10, 1985, READER Crime visits Balboa Park, by Gordon Smith.\n\nIntriguingly, a comparison of the number of car thefts and break-ins in Balboa Park with those in New York’s Central Park suggests the best way to eliminate most of the crime in Balboa Park is to eliminate the cars themselves. There are few parking lots in Central Park, and most of its visitors arrive via mass transit of some kind — bus, subway or taxi. In the first nine months of 1984, just six cars were stolen there — compared to one hundred stolen in Balboa Park. There were also 594 car break-ins in Balboa Park during the same period. (No equivalent figures for Central Park were available, but grand theft, a category of crime which includes many car break-ins is more prevalent in Balboa Park than in Central Park.\n\nVarious consultants hired by the city have long advocated getting rid of cars in the middle of Balboa Park, and the above statistics suggest the possibility that the park could end its chronic congestion and parking problems as well as much of its crime simply by banning automobiles.\n\nJanuary 10, 1985, READER.

San Diego Zoo fearful of cutbacks if tax is killed, by Daniel C. Carson.\n\nSacramento – A deputy director of the San Diego Zoo says the institution risks personnel and program cutbacks and admission fee increases if a special voter-approved zoo property tax is wiped off the books by the courts or the Legislature.\n\nWord of that “contingency plan” came in a telephone interview with Richard Binford, the zoo’s deputy director for finances and administration. While zoo officials are trying to interest lawmakers in efforts to preserve the zoo tax, they are already bracing for the loss of roughly $1.5 million a year.\n\nWhile the fall zoo budget is $45 million, Binford said, “we’ll have to scramble,” if the special tax is wiped out as being out of compliance with the 1978-tax-cut Proposition 13.\n\nAn appeal to the city to replace the funds had been virtually ruled out.\n\nEducational programs might be affected by the financial loss, he said, and some breeding programs to foster endangered species “might be put on the back burner. We would have to recover part in price increases. We would make some cutbacks in personnel.”\n\nMembers of the San Diego County legislative delegation, who gathered yesterday for breakfast, were urged to fight to keep the zoo tax. “We’re appealing to members of both house,” said San Diego city lobbyist John Witzel. “It’s a lot (of money) to the zoo.”\n\nThe object of Witzel’s concern is SB 149 by Sen. Milton Marks, R-San Francisco. The bill’s main impact would be to prevent cities from exploiting a so-called loophole in Proposition 13 by a court case to raise their property taxes above the limits set by the 1978 Jarvis-Gann initiative.\n\nThe object of the bill is to prevent those localities from imposing tax increases amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, ostensibly to pay for employee pension plans.\n\nThe Marks bill would spell out a narrow definition of debt that excludes pensions. It also excludes any extra property taxes to pay for ongoing local government activities — such as the zoo.\n\nMarch 1, 1985, San Diego Tribune, A-1, A-20.

Smaller organizations “can fly by the seat of their pants . . . on a month-to-month basis,” he said. “But an organization the size of this one requires you to project your plan out further.”\n\nParticular emphasis will be placed on the Wild Animal Park in San Pasqual Valley to make it self-supporting by 1987. So far, with the exception of one year, the park has spent more than it has received in revenues and since its opening in 1972 has had to be partially supported by the zoo to the tune of nearly $21 million.\n\nHere’s what’s in store because of the new plan, some of which has been phased in already or will be in the next couple of weeks. Other parts will be built as money is raised to finance extensive new construction projects.\n\n“Close Encounters” at the Wild Animal Park will begin March 30 and allow visitors a chance to meet the gorillas or elephants individually in their bedrooms or barns. Included in the price of admission for adults and children, “Close Encounters” is an attempt to make the Wild Animal Park more personal for visitors.\n\nMore graphics at the zoo and the park, more films and opportunities to talk with the keepers to find out about their work and the animals.\n\nMore bluegrass music and ballad concerts at the park instead of rock groups that have performed in the past, to draw families to the attractions.\n\nAn end to the $2 concert fee, begun last year, but stopped amid protests from any society members. The $1 parking fee at the park will continue. A proposed parking fee at the zoo is still under study by the city.\n\nA major change of exhibits at the zoo in which animals will be placed in settings similar to their native environments. Animals of the same region will be mixed together, not separated by species. As a result, the animals will have more room and may behave more as they would in the wild.\n\nThrough the exhibits, graphics and other means, visitors to the zoo will be able to better understand the ecology of plant, animal and human life.\n\nSome animals are still in cages at the zoo and exhibited according to species — as in Dog and Cat Canyon.\n\nDespite its financial difficulties and too few visitors, the Wild Animal Park is still considered a success in two important ways — propagation of endangered species, the purpose for which it was opened in 1972; and providing spacious grounds for animals to roam.\n\nHowever, the public has had little opportunity to see how the Wild Animal Park works to protect and propagate these animals.\n\nOne of the park’s greater accomplishments has been the raising of baby California condors, as the zoological society participates in a program it hopes will save the birds from extinction.\n\nBut the condor project perhaps best illustrates the important work done at the park and also the disadvantage to visitors, who by necessity are kept away from the birds. Scientists hope to release the condors to the wild when they grow strong enough and therefore keep them out of sight of humans, if possible, so that they can survive in the wild.\n\nMarch 12, 1985, San Diego Union, B-1, B-7. Zoo trustees okay “Diamond Edge: five-year plan, by Gina Lubrano.\n\nTrustees of the Zoological Society of San Diego yesterday approved a five-year strategy plan that will guide operations of the Zoo in Balboa Park and the Wild Animal Park in San Pasqual for the next five years.\n\nThe plan is called “Diamond Edge” because it will take the 69-year-old society to its diamond, or 75th anniversary in 1991. Implementation will begin immediately.\n\nThe plan for the first time places an emphasis on plants. In the past, the focus has been on animals and plants have been an afterthought, a Zoo spokesman said.\n\nThe plan addresses five key areas: a comprehensive plan to integrate animals, plants and facilities, making the Wild Animal Park self-sustaining; make the zoological organization more responsive to its operating environment; increasing revenues; and improving the visitor experience.\n\n“It is important here to note that the strategic plan did not begin as a reaction to any internal difficulties,” said Sheldon Campbell, president of the society. “From the start, it was wholly an initiative on the part of the staff and trustees who during a period of 69 years, have, with the good will of the media and the community, built the largest and most successful zoo operation in history.\n\n“That’s a staggering statement, but it’s true. The very success of the organization created the need for a long-range plan that would perpetuate it.”\n\nCampbell said the “Diamond Edge” name was selected because the plans calls for the society to maintain the “edge that our institution has had as far as the zoological world is concerned.”\n\nDiamond Edge is the first long-range plan developed for the society and for the first time defines a mission for the two parks. At present, the society’s bylaws define the goals of the parks as conservation, education, recreation and research.\n\nThe society, according to the new plan, “is dedicated to increasing understanding and appreciation of all life-forms by exhibiting animals and plants in natural settings and applying its efforts and influence to the conservation of the earth’s wildlife.”\n\nThe plan recognizes that the Wild Animal Park will continue to be dependent on the Zoo for another two years but should be able to pay its own bills by 1987. Since it opened in 1972, the park has received $20.8 million in subsidies from the Zoo.\n\nWork on the 118-page plan began on March 22, 1984. Before it was completed, it was worked on by 110 employees, trustees and other volunteers. Trustees saw the completed document for the first time on February 23 and approved it, with minor changes in wording at a meeting yesterday.\n\nThe nucleus group that prepared the plan, in addition to Campbell, included Charles Bieler, executive director emeritus; Dr. Kurt Benirschke, director of research; Richard Binford, deputy director of finance; and Zoological Society trustee Dallas Clark.\n\nOther members are horticulturist Chuck Coburn; Dr. James Dolan, curator of mammals; Pegi Harvey, director of education; Wild Animal Park general manager Robert McClure; Doug Myers, executive director of the Zoological Society; Jim Oosterhuis, head veterinarian at the park; David Rice, director of architecture; Carole Towne, director of public relations and marketing; society trustee Betty Joe Williams; and Zoo general manager Terry Winnick.\n\nMarch 13, 1985, San Diego Tribune, B-10.

Letter, Auto museum site hits sports groups, by David Freifelder.\n\nI would like to correct a serious error in your March 13 editorial about the newly planned auto museum in Balboa Park. I do not want to raise the question about whether San Diegans really need an antique auto museum as your article stated (I do have an opinion) but rather to comment on the proposed site of the museum.\n\nIn your article you stated ” . . . the Conference Building, now used for events only about 38 days a year, seems the perfect place.” This number is quite wrong.\n\nThe Conference Building is in use nearly 300 days per year by a variety of groups. It has been the home of the San Diego Table Tennis Club for, I believe, 24 years. This club, which has more than 500 members, has been producing nationally ranked players much of this time and sponsors play five nights a week, year-round. One night a week a local tournament is held in the Conference Building.\n\nTournaments sponsored by the U.S. Table Tennis Association and open to players throughout the United States and the world are also held several times a year.\n\nThe building is also the home for an important group consisting of several hundred handicapped San Diegans. Two nights a week for the past two years the handicapped play indoor field hockey.\n\nThese people have a great time and certainly know the Conference Building as their home.\n\nThe 38 days referred to in your editorial undoubtedly applies to weekend events, such as dart tournaments, dancing, rummage sales, etc. Since the table-tennis group and the handicapped use the building regularly for 260 days per year, The Tribune should have stated more correctly that “since the Conference Building is in use for 298 days per year, and on a regular basis by about 700 people, the Conference Building does not seem to be the appropriate place for the museum.”\n\nAs a relative newcomer to San Diego, I have been continually impressed with the extraordinary athletic facilities provided by the city for its variety of citizens. To me, this contributes significantly to the “Finest City” image and should not be changed.\n\nI have heard that the Parks and Recreation Board is trying to find usable facilities for the various groups that will be displaced by the potential conversion of the Conference Building to an auto museum. They should be commended. I hope, though, that a new place will be found before the eviction notice comes and that the City Council recognizes that facilities now in use by nearly 1,000 San Diegans have immediate value, neither tourists nor San Diegans will be left out by a delay in setting up the museum.\n\nApril 2, 1985, San Diego Tribune, B-6. EDITORIAL: Milestone for Children’s Museum.\n\nWe hope the Children’s Museum finds a permanent home in Balboa Park or downtown.\n\nApril 11, 1985, San Diego Tribune, A-1, A-6, A-7. Twelve trustees mold future of Zoo, by Ann Levin (photos of trustees).\n\nThe people who have served as trustees of the San Diego Zoological Society loom large in the city’s history.\n\nThey erected skyscrapers, courted commerce and industry, shaped public policy, raised millions for charity, nurtured the arts.\n\nThen they were rewarded with what many consider the city’s ultimate plum — a seat on the zoo board. While older Northeastern cities flaunt prestigious opera and museum societies, San Diego — young, exuberant and outdoorsy — loves its zoo.\n\nThe volunteer work is demanding. Dinner jackets and evening gowns collect no dust in their closets. Lengthy board meetings supplant quiet evenings at home.\n\nNot that the job lacks perks. In their official capacities, some have met the Duke of Edinburgh, petted a giant panda at a Chinese game reserve, drank free champagne on international flights.\n\nWho are these people that set policy for a 100,000 plus member society and allocate pieces of a $50 million pie?\n\nTheir average age is 63. Most are millionaires.\n\nThe Tribune, in an effort to shed light on the inner workings of a very private society, requested and received interviews with 11 of the board’s 12 voting members, as well as several trustees emeriti.\n\nThe Zoological Society of San Diego was incorporated as a non-profit organization in 1916 by founder Harry M. Wegeforth, known simply as “Dr. Harry.” A man who spent his boyhood in Baltimore as ringmaster of a backyard circus — built from candy animals, cigar-box wagons and a bigtop tent made from four sacks — Dr. Harry harbored secret dreams as a youth of being a circus high-wire walker.\n\nIf the frustrated showman were alive today, ironically enough he would hear zoo critics say his 69-year old stationary ark is fast becoming a stationary circus.\n\nComplaints are voiced privately that management has neglected the society’s slated goals of conservation and education in favor of theme park entertainment.\n\nEventually, the buck stops in the zoo’s board room where an elite group meets once a month beneath an artist’s interpretation of an African village to carry forward Dr. Harry’s dream.\n\nIn addition, trustees lead 10 individual committees composed of about 150 community volunteers, who advise the board on every aspect of the society’s operations.\n\nTo arrive at the board, one starts off on a committee. The waiting lists are long.\n\nBetty Jo Williams, the board’s only woman and one of three female trustees in the society’s history, joined the board in 1979 after a stint on the membership committee.\n\nA past president of the Junior League, former director of the Natural History Museum and major fund-raiser for her alma mater Stanford University, Williams knows volunteer work.\n\n“It’s great fun. It if volunteering you can’t have fun, move on,” said the Point Loma housewife who assists her stockbroker husband, Harold, with his Old Globe Theater fund-raisers.\n\nThough some zoo committee chairmanships are rotated every year, Williams has headed the education committee for six years. She is most proud of the zoo’s long-standing policy to admit all city school second-graders to the zoo for free.\n\nJoining her regularly at her committee meetings is colleague Robert Sullivan, the oldest voting trustee at age 72. He has seen the fruits of the zoo’s education efforts. “My little grandson is proud to tell me that a koala is not a bear, it’s a marsupial.”\n\nSullivan chairs the membership committee where he often runs afoul of colleagues and zoo officials unhappy with gate and concession receipts.\n\nSullivan rankles at their suggestion that paid-up members, admitted free on a variety of annual or life-membership plans, drain the zoo’s resources when they make frequent visits, picnic hampers in tow.\n\n“More power to bigger memberships,” Sullivan counters.\n\nThe board has always needed money, he points out, especially in the midst of the Depression when bankers were wary of loaning the zoo essential money for survival.\n\n“We did not have any collateral except animals. Bankers take a dim view of loaning money on a rhinoceros.”\n\nDuring the 1930s the society boosted the number of directors from nine to 12 — picking a banker, lawyer and newspaper publisher — to widen its influence in the community.\n\nSays Sullivan, “The board was always selected from people who were successful in their field of business and endeavor, because the zoo needed help in finance, business. . . . If you ever had to pay those fellas what they have been worth on the zoo board each year, it would be millions of dollars.”\n\nNext year, Sullivan will have served on the board 50 years — but has mixed emotions about retirement. While acknowledging that the board is in need of new blood, he hates to say goodbye to an old friend.\n\n“It gets to be so much a part of your life that what do you do without it.?”\n\nFormerly in the lumber business, Sullivan has served on the San Diego Civic Light Opera, Great American First Savings Bank and the Old Globe Theater boards. The prestige now associated with membership on the zoo board is a fairly new phenomenon, he said. In the beginning “Nobody seemed to care. They just knew there was a roar in Balboa Park.”\n\nSheldon Campbell, current zoological society president, was attracted to the roar at an early age.\n\nCampbell spent his 16th summer as an assistant to the reptile keeper, scrubbing the backs of turtles to keep them algae-free. For his labors he received a rattleskin from which he fashioned a belt — but the real payoff came later.\n\nThat summer he worked closely with his friend, the late Chuck Shaw. Shaw later became the zoo’s reptile curator, and in 1962 angles to get his old friend appointed to the zoo’s public relations committee.\n\nCampbell, then a stockbroker and writer, organized the zoo’s golden anniversary celebration with such zest he was asked to join the board when a vacancy arose in 1968.\n\n“Being on a zoo committee was seen by most San Diegans as one of the most desirable volunteer tasks you can undertake. The zoo was to San Diego what a symphony or an opera might be to another city.”\n\nIn 1978, flying home from Paris in the economy-class section, Campbell encountered a steward who noted the zoological society insignia on Campbell’s jacket. Delighted to meet a representative of the world-class zoo, the steward kept Campbell’s glass full of complimentary champagne from the first-class pantry for the rest of the flight.\n\nCampbell deftly deflects criticism of the zoo, proudly stating the zoo pumps $250 million into the local economy. Problems will be solved, he says, with the unfolding of the zoo’s “Diamond Edge Plan,” a five-year plan names in anticipation of the zoo’s 75th anniversary.\n\nAbout a number of recent Tribune articles based on U.S. Department of Agriculture inspection reports reporting deficiencies in the zoo’s sea lion tanks and large cat and bear housing, Campbell says the stories “left out factual material.”\n\nTrustees were aware of the problems, he says, and improvements were already in the works before the articles were published. “We’ll get it changed. It’s just a continual struggle,” he vows.\n\nNevertheless Campbell says some trustees responded with “indignation to the newspaper reports.” The zoo is not used to that. We’re used to a good press. We’ve created the largest and most successful zoo operation in the world due to the climate, the people of San Diego and the media. The media have contributed greatly.”\n\nWegeforth’s society was incorporated one drizzly September day in 1916 in the offices of a San Diego newspaper in what was to be the first of many fruitful collaborations with the press.\n\nDr. Harry had convinced Clarence McGrew, and editor of The San Diego Union, to publish a plea to start a zoological society. The day before, while traversing Balboa Park with his brother, Dr. Harry had overheard the roar of a lion on display at an exposition and remarked, “Wouldn’t it be splendid if San Diego had a zoo? . . . I think I’ll start one.”\n\nThe first animals Wegeforth adopted were the leftover lions, monkeys and bears from the 1916 Panama-California International Exposition. The next year, the zoo received animals from a beached Hollywood production about Noah’s Ark.\n\nIn its early years, inventory swelled by trading rattlesnakes and sea lions, readily available in Southern California. San Diegans would bring wild rabbits, bobcats, skunks and mountain lions from the countryside.\n\nIn 1924, a youthful Ivor de Kirby, destined to become a trustee, bought an $8 donkey with his brother, but after the braying disturbed neighbors, the brothers donated the beast to the zoo for rides.\n\nSailors supplied the society’s first Kodiak bears. After the bear grotto was full, Dr. Harry orders the surplus bears butchered and the meat sold to hotels.\n\nThough today’s zoo fans might condemn such a facile solution, his son, Milton, a board member for 40 years and now a trustee emeritus, explains, “I don’t think there was any concern in the preservation of wildlife up to 1941,” the year the elder Wegeforth died.\n\nDuring the zoo’s early days, when a payroll couldn’t be met, the newspaper would announce the feeding of a boa constrictor. Dr. Harry would charge a 10 cents admission to watch sailors stretch out a long snake, insert a hose down its throat, hook up a sausage grinder and grind it full of food.\n\nThe shows were popular. The payrolls were met. The zoo always had a friend in the media.\n\nHoward Chernoff, a former newspaper reporter, editor, television executive and now zoo trustee emeritus, joined the board in 1952, having served earlier on the public relations committee.\n\nHe lost no time pressing for one of then-director Dr. Charles Schroeder’s pet projects — a children’s zoo.\n\nHis colleagues received the idea coolly, but the patient and persistent Chernoff resolved to persuade them. With his wife, Melva, the traveled 20,000 miles through the United States to find out what a children’s zoo should look like. Back home, it took 18 months to raise the money.\n\nChernoff took baby animals from the zoo on the lunch and dinner fund-raising circuit as part of his sales pitch.\n\n“When a 6-year old looks at an elephant, he might as well look at the Empire State Building,” Chernoff recalls explaining to skeptics.\n\nChernoff took emeritus status in 1969 after he was asked to be U.S. ambassador to Japan’s Expo 70. That experience kicked off 11 years of intricate negotiations to obtain a pair of rare Manchurian cranes.\n\nThrough business contacts in the South Pacific, Chernoff became personal friends with the King of Tonga, from whom he acquired a pair of Tongan iguanas — three-foot long lizards.\n\nExplains Chernoff, with a twinkle in his blue eyes, “I asked the king. He said, ‘Sure.’ He got us the iguanas then he came here to see them.”\n\nChernoff, in his 80s, says the board would benefit from younger members — and more women. He suggests conferring emeritus status at age 65 instead of 75.\n\nWhen Chernoff was KFMB Channel 8 general manager in the 1950s, he asked station manager Bill Fox to produce “Zoorama,” a weekly program filmed at the zoo and syndicated on some 200 independent stations around the country during the 1950s and 1960s. Aired in Europe, Japan and Africa, it has been credited by zoo officials with putting the San Diego Zoo on the map.\n\nAfter six years of show production, Fox was invited to join the zoo’s public relations committee. In 1978, Fox replaced trustee Lucy Killea, the society’s second female board member. Killea, now in the California Assembly, left the board for the San Diego City Council.\n\nFox, now general manager of KCST Channel 39, tapped newspaper, radio, advertising and retail talent to serve on the public relations committee, which he chairs. Channel 39 recently started airing “Animal Express,” a show featuring zoo goodwill ambassador Joan Embery and zoo animals.\n\nAware of intense competition from other entertainment, Fox, 58, produced the packaging of exciting experiences to keep visitors returning to the zoo and Wild Animal Park.\n\n“There was a time when there was a zoo in San Diego and there was not a lot of competition. The zoo lived on its reputation and people went there because it was there. Not anymore. For the last 15 years competition for leisure time has been growing.”\n\nLt. Gen. Victor “Brute” Krulak, former newspaper executive, agrees. Says the retired U.S. Marine Corps officer, “There’s no doubt that Southern California is becoming a more recreation-intensive locality with every passing year.”\n\nA board member since 1968, Krulak, 70, was reluctant to express his individual opinions about zoo business.\n\n“The zoo should speak with a sold voice. That’s how we stick together. That’s how we get on so well. That’s way we’re a success story.”\n\nKrulak logs about nine hours a week as chair of the zoo’s buildings and grounds committee and vice-chair of the finance committee. He dismisses the notion that the board membership is “glamorous” preferring to call it hard work. He adds, “The zoo has always been like motherhood in San Diego.”\n\nFormerly a vice president of Copley Press, Inc., Krulak still writes an opinion column in The Tribune. Active in civic affairs, he has served on about 45 local and national boards.\n\nHis favorite zoo creature is the koala. “Koalas are very dear to this zoo and they’ve always been very dear to me. And they belong here. They eat only one thing — eucalyptus. That means they’re in Fat City in San Diego.\n\nThough local board members have diverse backgrounds, they have been criticized for a lack of botanical and zoological expertise. Some zoo employees say trustees reject the advice of expert professional staff, interfere with day-to-day decisions, commit money to impractical projects and play favorites among the staff.\n\nThe board also has come under fire for a “good old boy” system of director selection, resulting in few women and no minorities in its history.\n\nOne employee said some committee members are appointed, not because they have a specialty valuable to the committee, but because they are a friend of the chairman or other official.\n\nRecently, the board was criticized by Herbert Fredman, Tribune op-ed columnist, who accused it of operating a “non-profit oligarchy.” Fredman argued that because the zoo receives $1.5 million in annual city taxes, and, like all tax-exempt organizations is subsidized by other taxpayers, it should be accountable to the public.\n\nIndeed, some of the board’s unilateral actions, such as the decision to destroy eucalyptus trees in the Balboa Park parking lots, have enraged local citizens. Another storm of protest erupted when the zoo announced — and later delayed — plans to charge parking fees in the same city-owned lots. A parking fee was instituted at the Wild Animal Park.\n\nAnd some trustees say privately that San Diego’s changing demographics should be examined in selecting future board members. But publicly, they say their dazzling successes have been achieved because they have operated in private, free from the compromises required when negotiating for public money.\n\nTrustee Ivor de Kirby, 69, made his fortune in cars. A former city councilman and longtime Ford dealer, de Kirby was admitted to the zoo board in 1966. He was names Mr. San Diego four years later.\n\nA childhood friend of the Wegeforths, who donated his pet donkey to the zoo for rides, de Kirby ingested zoo talk with dinner as a guest in Dr. Harry’s home.\n\nChair of the animal park’s buildings and grounds committee, de Kirby admits the park’s “obscure” location next to Escondido worries him.\n\nBut with bullish optimism, he says improved signs, more advertising and a good road between Interstate 5 and the park will draw enough tourists from San Diego, Orange and San Bernardino counties to keep the breeding park alive.\n\nDe Kirby opposes further government aid to the society because of the strings it would attach.\n\nHe was among a group of 15 who tool former zoo director Schroeder on a five-week trip to the African wild as a retirement present.\n\nAnd he traveled with a delegation to Australia in 1976 to pick up six koalas, a gift from that country. En route, the cuddly marsupials dined on eucalyptus leaves and rode in the airplane’s passenger section from which seats had been removed to accommodate the bulky cages. During layovers, the koalas napped with the delegation at fancy hotels.\n\nAnother driving businessman is trustee A. Eugene Trepte, 59, president of one of San Diego’s larger and older construction firms.\n\nTrepte built the Old Globe Theater, a pioneer solar system at University High School, a surgical wing for Children’s Hospital, and, at the request of the Tom and Suzanne Warner family, the zoo’s $1.9 million Warner Administration Building two years ago.\n\nChair of the finance committee, Trepte says of the board. “Those 12 seats are very precious. We have always rowed the boat well together. . . . We have come to the realization that we are not going to think alike, and when the majority rules, we shut up.”\n\nTrepte also sits on the Old Globe Theater, San Diego Trust and Savings Bank and University of San Diego boards.\n\nA strong backer of the Wild Animal Park, Trepte considers it “the zoo of the future” as San Diego County continues its expansion north.\n\nLimited parking in Balboa Park will hold zoo attendance at about 3 million annually for years to come, he guesses.\n\nAlthough a parking structure has been discussed, the builder says he doesn’t think it likely.\n\nNoting the public has fought to leave as much greenery as possible in the park, Trepte says, “I kind of go along with them.”\n\nTrustee John Thornton, 53, ranks among the city’s top businessmen. The only member of the board who refused to be interviewed by The Tribune, Thornton recently resigned from Wavetek Corp., which had named him president and chief executive officer at age 32.\n\nHe earned a reputation as “boy wonder” for turning a small $1-million-a-year instrumentation firm into an $84 million company in 20 years.\n\nThornton joined the board in 1972, after serving on the public relations committee more than 10 years. In a deposition taken last year when the zoological society was sued, Thornton admitted the directors and top executives lack zoological backgrounds.\n\n“What I would loosely call the technicians, the people with the animal skills, didn’t necessarily have some of the other skills, and that’s why there frankly are very few if any with curatorial or animal skills in the administrative segment of the business.”\n\nThough trustees lack professional credentials in botany and zoology, as a group the dote on animals and tend lush gardens.\n\nDr. Harry kept turkeys, chickens and blue-ribbon stock on his 10-acre Paradise Valley ranch. One day he took some ranch bantam hens to the zoo because “the little children could care less about a tiger or an elephant, but they liked to chase the animals,” explains Milton Wegeforth.\n\nDr. Harry experimented with official fund-raising tricks. One he went to a businessman for help in efforts to buy an elephant. The man replied, “If you find me a white elephant, I’ll give you the money.” Wegeforth whitewashed an elephant and got the money.\n\nWegeforth’s successor, Belle Benchley, matched him in spirit. Though called an executive secretary, in fact, she ran the zoo from 1927 until 1953, blazing a trail as the first zoo director to keep leaf-eating monkeys alive in captivity. Her secret — feed then alfalfa.\n\nBenchley adored Mbongo and Ngagi, two male mountain gorillas, now cast in bronze inside the zoo’s gates. The pair was captured in the Belgian Congo in the 1930s by the husband-and-wife exploring ream of Martin and Osa Johnson, who donated them to the zoo.\n\nBenchley once barred cub reporter Sheldon Campbell from entering the zoo after his newspaper, the now-defunct San Diego Sun, ran a photograph of Ringling Bros. Circus gorilla Gargantua next to a Campbell story on the popular pair.\n\nBenchley said the zoo was a public trust. When Schroeder, a veterinarian employed as a production manager of New York’s Lederle Laboratories, replaced her in 1953, she gave him one piece of advice. “Just keep in mind this is not a business.”\n\n“This is a business,” Schroeder later recalled in an interview. “I immediately instituted all the things you would do in a business right away. We used to say at the zoo that you have a product and your concern is selling. It’s a continuous thing, money, money, money. You have to be very cold, very practical.”\n\nThe first thing the new director did was to buy a mechanical sweeper and a Dictaphone.\n\nThe debate between public trust versus the bottom line has raged ever since, as the society has grown from 41 members in 1917 to its present strength of 102,795.\n\nTrustee Dr. Albert Anderson, 61, admits that when he joined the board four years ago, succeeding Milton Wegeforth, he thought a little more commercialism was the way to go. He has since changed his mind.\n\n“I’m probably not quite as conservative as possibly some of the other board members and I was very interested in corporate programs and interested in some things which I felt would bring more people in. When I first went on the board, I felt that maybe we should be more like a Disneyland, doing some exciting things. Now I have learned that this is not what people really want. They want animals.”\n\nA dentist, board member of Children’s Hospital, Mr. San Diego of 1981, past president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau, member of the Stadium Authority, vice president of President Reagan’s Committee on Metal Retardation, and former campaign manager of Sen. Pete Wilson’s mayoral and U.S. Senate campaigns, Anderson says, “I’m a social prostitute. I just enjoy doing it.”\n\nHe was asked to serve on the board by two-term president George Gildred. Before joining he had served on the public relations committee about five years.\n\nOn a zoo’s trustee’s perks, Anderson mused, “We got to meet the queen’s husband . . . I travel a lot in Europe and whenever I do I always take my zoo cards with me, like a business card, if I visit any of the zoos around the world. It just gives us an entree that is sensational. It’s like a big fraternity. They minute you say you’re from the San Diego Zoo, they want you co come and see their best exhibits, the back of the zoo.”\n\nIf Anderson is a civic star, trustee Gildred shines as brightly.\n\nGildred, 51, remembers as a lad hearing zoo howls from the family’s Cypress Avenue house. His father, the late Philip Gildred, built the downtown Fox Theater and backed other projects — the Community Concourse — Anza-Borrego State Park and the county administration building. The elder Gildreds donated a half-million dollars to build the Fine Arts Gallery east wing.\n\nGeorge, now in a real-estate partnership with is brother, joined the board in 1973 after serving for years on the animal collection committee.\n\nHis three-page resume lists associations with more than 35 cultural and civic boards, including consul to the Republic of Chile, a post he inherited from his father.\n\nIn 1982 Gildred, then society president, joined a 13-member delegation on a visit to five Chinese cities, clearing the way for the subsequent arrival in San Diego of China’s golden-haired douc langur monkeys.\n\nIn a zoo near a giant panda game reserve in the Szechwan Province, Gildred and others were paid a great complement — keepers led a 13-month-old panda into a public area and let the U.S. visitors pet the rare animal.\n\nOne of the board’s youngest members, Gildred bubbles with enthusiasm when he talks of the golden monkey exchange — “more important than letting the pandas out” — or his dusk excursions on the Wild Animal Park monorail or the antics of his “dear friend” Kakowitz, a pygmy chimpanzee who died five years ago.\n\n“He was such a wonderful father. I loved watching his tribe grow up around him. He was an ideal family man.”\n\nFrom Gildred’s 20th-floor office in the sleek, modern Imperial Bank building downtown, it is two blocks to the old-fashioned San Diego Trust and Savings building, where trustee J. Dallas Clark works on the 10th floor. Clark’s grandfather founded San Diego Trust and Savings Bank in 1889.\n\nClark, an industrial developer, became a trustee in 1969 after having served on the buildings and grounds committee for 11 years.\n\nHis small office is decorated with a portrait of an African Masai woman, animal sculptures from the zoo gift shop and a painting done by one of his two daughters, an artist who paints botanical subjects.\n\nOn his desk is a large photograph of one daughter clutching his new grandchild. Clark is tall, soft-spoken, methodical. Freckles dot his balding sunburned scalp, fringed with white hair.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Clark started the development — or fund-raising — department — an activity that “you’re just always doing.”\n\nHe chairs the animal collection committee. It is typical, he says, for trustees to attend meetings of committees other than their own. When Trepte’s finance committee meets, for instance, in addition to its three board members, five others are likely to attend.\n\n“I’ve never known a board with such unanimity as this one.”\n\nClark laughs at the suggestion a trusteeship is glamorous or prestigious. “Maybe I’m kind of low-key, but I don’t go for that. It’s hard work.”\n\nWhat does he find exciting in 1975. Clark visited the Canton Zoo with a delegation that included mammals curator Dr. Jim Dolan. They passed by an enclosure for two rhinoceros given to the Chinese by zoo officials. When the beats heard Dolan speaking English, they trotted over to see him. Dolan reached out and stroked their scaly hides.\n\n“And that’s a sight I don’t think any of us will forget — this one rhinoceros running over and Dr. Dolan patted his head!”\n\nHeading up the research, conservation and health committee is Dr. Lee S. Monroe, a retired Scripps Clinic internist and author of several books on parasitic diseases.\n\nHe was drafted for the committee about 10 years ago because of his medical knowledge and appointed to the board about five years later. His committee meets once a month with about 12 zoo staff members. “It’s fun, but it’s some work. They have more meetings at the zoo than Carter has pills.”\n\nMonroe, 65, notes the zoo’s contributions to animal-disease research — including a project to study a virus killing African cattle and another to design a hormone pump to increase the reproductive abilities of an endangered Komodo lizard.\n\nBut Monroe warns than panic at the current financial squeeze could backfire. He cautions against luring visitors with flashy new programs of marketing. Instead management should “have a steady hand on the wheel and not get too excited.” He says the zoo’s natural attractions will suffice.\n\nMonroe vehemently opposes any more government aid to the zoo. He dismisses the current 2-cent tax levy, saying it “really doesn’t even pay the water bill.\n\n“The thrust should be toward making this a San Diego Zoo that is run for and by the people, with their money.”\n\nThese trustees have seen changes in animal husbandry unimaginable to the zoo’s founders — the disappearance from the wild of hundreds of species, forcing zoos to rely on expensive breeding programs, restrictions on animal trade since passage of the 1972 Endangered Species Act, sky-high prices for animals once donated to the zoo, unstable political situations in the rest of the world hampering certain animal exchanges.\n\nFurthermore, the environmental movement of the last two decades has caused people to view animals with greater reverence — as links in a complicated and vast network that ultimately supports man. Meanwhile, advances in science have revealed animals’ complex physical and psychological needs.\n\nBack in the days when Wegeforth patrolled the zoo’s chaparral-covered 100 acres o his Arabian stallion, “”people weren’t as considerate toward animals,” Campbell admits.\n\nNow, some zoo keepers with advanced degrees in animal behavior and the sciences assail the board and the administration for lack of scientific training.\n\nThey dismiss the board as a rich man’s social club, while envying its power.\n\nTrustees admit the board’s power is awesome, even compared to other boards on which they have served.\n\nSays Fox, “The society board is so involved in the operation that we are not an advisory board, we’re like the board of directors of a major corporation that makes the decisions.”\n\nSays Anderson, comparing the zoo board to the Stadium Authority, “I don’t think the Stadium Authority is as important as . . . the zoo board. The stadium authority is advisory. On a number of occasions where the stadium board has voted in favor of things, the city council has overriden them.”\n\nThe city council does not override the zoo.\n\nThose who wonder in what direction the zoo is headed might recall the answer to the question about where a 10,000-lb. elephant sleeps — anywhere it wants.\n\nSays president Campbell, noting the zoo’s multimillion-dollar needs, “There’s an old Chinese adage that says, ‘He who rides the tiger can’t get off.’ And we’re riding a tiger.”\n\n(Tribune staff writers Susan Duerksen and Rita Calvano also contributed to his report.)\n\nApril 11, 1985, San Diego Union, B-2. Board of Supervisors has agreed to allocate $20,000 to Balboa Park museums, whose county funding was cut last year.\n\nApril 12, 1985, San Diego Tribune, A-1. Talented trio shapes Zoo, Wild Animal Park, by Ann Levin and Susan Duerksen.\n\nThe trio that runs the San Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park knows the business of attracting and amusing tourists — each had made a career of organizing tours, designing show stages, and feeding hungry throngs.\n\nAll three came to the San Diego Zoological Society in the past three years, two from Universal Studios and one from an Anheuser-Busch theme park. Their ages range from 31 to 36. Two have no college degrees and the other finished college four years ago.\n\nThey are known for working long hours in an effort to bring innovative business sense to what has become a mammoth corporation facing strong competition for the entertainment dollar.\n\nDouglas Myers, 35, took over as the society’s executive director, the top administrator for both and zoo and park in February.\n\nAfter holding several managerial positions at the Busch Gardens parks in Los Angeles County and Williamsburg, Va., Myers was hired as general manager of the Wild Animal Park in January 1982.\n\nIn June of that year he brought in Robert McClure as operations manager of the park. McClure, 31, had been an assistant food-service manager at Busch Gardens before moving on to food management with Marineland and then Universal Studios tours in Los Angeles.\n\nWhen Myers became the society’s deputy director in 1983, McClure took over as general manager of the park.\n\nIn June 1982, Terry Winnick was hired as general manager of the zoo. Now 36, Winnick has spent 14 years with MCA Inc., a conglomerate that owns Universal Studios. Starting as a tour guide, Winnick worked his way up to managing shows, special effects and other visitor services for the studio tours. His former colleagues say he was a “whiz kid.”\n\nMyers worked as a bird-keeper at a sanctuary attached to a Busch brewery in Van Nuys for a year and a half. He then moved into what he calls “front level management” in charge of the animal collection.\n\nMyers then spend three years as a general services manager and director of park operations at the Williamsburg Busch Gardens. While there he finished a bachelor’s degree in interdisciplinary studies at Christopher Newport College in Newport News in 1981.\n\nWinnick studied architecture at the University of Southern California and McClure took business administration and biology courses at California State University at Northridge, but neither finished his degree.\n\nZoological Society President Sheldon Campbell said a business management degree is preferable but not necessary, for a general manager. “You can make an awful mistake hiring people on the basis of a piece of paper,” he said.\n\nThe lack of degrees and experience in animal care is offset by McClure’s food management expertise, which is important to the wild animal park and Winnick’s skill as an entertainment entrepreneur and construction manager, Campbell said. Both men supervise a staff of experienced curators with doctorates in animal sciences.\n\nCampbell said the board gives the executive director total authority to hire the two general managers. Winnick was hired by a former director, Andy Grant, who had worked with him at Universal and now manages tours of Leeds Castle in England.\n\nApril 12, 1985, San Diego Tribune A-1, A-12. New era dawns at Zoo; administrators juggle “show biz” research, by Susan Duerksen.\n\nLush greenery, shocking pink flamingos, screeching macaws, fragrant blossoms and towering palm trees overwhelm the visitor stepping inside the gate of the San Diego Zoo.\n\nFor many out-of-towners, already seduced by the sunshine and sea breezes, the jungle paradise confirms everything they’ve heard about the San Diego Zoo — it’s the best in the world.\n\nOver the years the zoo has become a worldwide legend. Its reputation spread by visiting military personnel, the internationally broadcast “Zoorama” and, more recently, by Joan Embery’s 45 appearances on Johnny Carson’s Tonight show.\n\nOther established cities had their operas and museums — San Diego was known first for its zoo. And its residents, who take the zoo’s pre-eminence as a tenet of San Diego life, have supported the non-profit zoological society with memberships, donations and generous bequests.\n\nBut take away the foliage and San Diego’s climate and you’re left with a 69-year old institution that some say is feeling its age and scrambling to keep up with younger competition.\n\nAnd for the past decade financial losses at the zoo’s Wild Animal Park near Escondido have further strained the budget at the main zoo, contributing to policy decisions that are being criticized by some animal specialists both within the zoo and elsewhere.\n\nAs the management experiments with new revenue-boosting attractions, discontent has swelled among animal “purists” who fear the venerable institution is going show-biz. The conflict erupts in sometimes rancorous accusations by animal caretakers who question the Hollywood occupation of a new breed of managers.\n\nWhile the zoo still is considered among the best in the world, zoological experts across the nation say some smaller zoos are overtaking San Diego with creative exhibits, biological research and conservation programs — on much thinner budgets.\n\n“The San Diego Zoo is, of course, very well known among other zoos — it’s one of the most highly advertised,” said Elvie Turner, director of the Fort Worth, Texas, zoo and president of the 156-member American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums. “But it’s not quite like it was. Other zoos are catching up. I’ve heard some complaints that it’s beginning to be an amusement-type operation rather than what is generally regarded as a scientific type of operation.”\n\nBut Sheldon Campbell, president of the San Diego Zoological Society board, which runs the zoo and the Wild Animal Park, said only three other zoos in the world — East and West Berlin and the Bronx Zoo in New York City — even come close to the number and rarity of animals in the San Diego collection.\n\n“The zoo operation we run is the largest and most successful in history. There’s no question about it.”\n\nTogether, the San Diego and Wild Animal Park’s expenditure of about $45 million, is more than double its main U.S. rival, the Bronx Zoo. The San Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park have 5,400 animals, surpassed only by the West Berlin zoo, which has 8,000 animals.\n\nWilliam Conway, director of the Bronx Zoological Society, said it’s hard to rate zoos, but San Diego has some stiff competition.\n\n“The best waterfowl collection in the world is in England (near Stroud). The best exhibit of nocturnal animals is in the Bronx. The greatest number of species is in West Berlin. The best gorilla exhibit is in Seattle. The best seals and sea lions are in Tacoma. San Diego has a long history with koalas but Los Angeles put together a much more exciting exhibit.”\n\nDavid Hancocks, a zoo-design architect and former director of Woodland Park Zoological Gardens in Seattle, made a harsher assessment. “My feeling is that if you took away those nice flowers and ferns the San Diego Zoo would be a pretty bleak place. All the animals ever see is the perimeter of the wall around them . . . but they don’t have places to get out of view.”\n\nIn response, San Diego Zoo officials point to their long-range plan to rebuild the entire zoo in roomy, natural exhibits. That plan will take at least 35 years to complete, but in the meantime the older enclosures are renovated as money becomes available, Campbell said.\n\n“The exhibits range from bleak to outstanding, and in they future they will all be outstanding,” Campbell said. “We’ll get it changed. It’s just a continuous struggle.”\n\nZoo directors in colder climates and with smaller budgets admit their criticisms sound like sour grapes. While viewing the San Diego Zoo with a tinge of jealousy, some also are annoyed by its unwavering claim to be No. 1.\n\nThey laud the zoo for its research, particularly genetic breeding and its program to raise California condors and return the endangered bird to the wild. About a third of the research department’s $800,000 budget is obtained through private donations and the rest comes from general zoo revenues.\n\nAnd they agree San Diego maintains the largest collection of animals, and is the most self-supporting of major zoos, using taxes for a tiny fraction of its $50 million budget.\n\nHowever, inside the zoo, dozens of employees, ranging from animal keepers to department heads, in confidential interviews with The Tribune have questioned the spending priorities of what has become a large corporation. In recent years, they say, the emphasis has been on recreation and entertainment at the expense of conservation, education and the quality of animal exhibits.\n\nSome animal handlers say privately that animal care is neglected, resulting in boredom, illness or even death. They say visitors who look closely would see monkeys crowded in substandard 5-year old pens, cats pacing old-fashioned concrete and wire cages and bears and rhinos without mates.\n\nBoard President Campbell counters that many employees are not aware of the money spent on “off-view” facilities benefiting the animals, including construction of a $1.4 million animal hospital in 1977 and two primate-breeding centers built in 1979 and 1983 for about $1.1 million.\n\n“All these most of our employees haven’t seen,” he said.\n\nThe highly visible food stands and gift shops, which have cost about $2 million to build in the past 10 years, have long ago paid for themselves and continue to support the rest of the zoo, Campbell said.\n\nConcessions such as food sales now account for 36 percent of the revenue, while another 28 percent comes from admissions and 9 percent from annual memberships.\n\nIn a five-year plan unveiled two months ago, zoo officials announced their intention to get half their revenue from as yet untapped sources by the end of 1989, reducing the reliance on gate receipts. Executive Director Douglas Myers said it “would not be good business” to reveal potential new revenue sources.\n\nIn addition to the ongoing courtship of monied animal lovers, the zoo is turning to sponsorship of specific exhibits or programs by corporations. For instance, local companies financed many of the zoo’s current tour buses and Eastman Kodak has become a major corporate sponsor, pledging $100,000 a year for five years.\n\nThe new $800,000 Hunte Amphitheater also is expected to increase revenue by drawing visitors away from the congested front areas of the zoo and improving crowd turnover, Campbell said. It was built with money from a donor who picked the amphitheater from a list of five zoo projects that needed financing, he said.\n\nThe $1.9 million Warner Administration Center, built in 1983, is another object of criticism from some employees. But donors Tom and Suzanne Warner specified their money was to be used to consolidate the zoo’s administrative offices, which had been scattered in several buildings.\n\nDonors are more inclined to given money to build “brand new things” than to repair the old, Campbell said.\n\nDay-to-day decisions on spending money are made by the zoo’s administrators, not donors. Many of the lifelong “animal people” who work for the zoo are chafing under the leadership of young executives whom they blame for tilting the zoo away from conservation and education and toward competition with a myriad of Southern California attractions, such as Disneyland, Knott’s Berry Farm and Sea World.\n\nExecutive Director Myers and the general managers of both the zoo and the Wild Animal Park were hired within the past three years. All three have management backgrounds with Universal Studios or Anheuser-Busch theme parks and none has zoo experience.\n\nThis hiring pattern bucks a national trend, said Bob Wagner of Jackson, Miss., executive director of the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums, which was headed last year by Charles Bieler, former executive director of the San Diego Zoological Society. About 15 years ago, zoos across the country tended to seek administrators with business or management backgrounds, but now have reversed that practice, he said.\n\n“In most cases in recent years, when there has been a change in zoo directors, the search committee has selected zoo-trained professionals,” believing it better to hire assistants with business expertise, Wagner said.\n\n“You need an animal person at the top, and put the business people under him,” said Edward Maruska, director of the Cincinnati Zoo. “The man at the top is the controlling factor on how well an exhibit is built, how well the collection is managed.”\n\nCampbell said that although Myers does not have a zoo background he is an “animal man” who worked closely with the 136-species bird collection at the now defunct Busch Gardens in Van Nuys. Beginning as a bird keeper, Myers also was a tour manager, animal collection manager and general service manager during his 11 years with Anheuser-Busch Co. Shortly before the bird sanctuary was closed five years ago to make way for expansion of a brewery, he moved to the Busch Gardens location in Williamsburg, Va.\n\n“I have a significant amount of animal experience,” he said, noting that the theme park also had a collection of otters, penguins,, sea lions and small primates.\n\nHowever, Campbell said Myers was hired “primarily as a manager” when he was selected to manage the Wild Animal Park in 1982. He was promoted to executive director of the society in February of this year.\n\nMyers, in turn, said both general managers who report to him, Terry Winnick of the zoo and Bob McClure of the Wild Animal Park, were hired for their management experience.\n\nMcClure had worked in food and merchandising for Busch Gardens in Van Nuys, Marineland in Palos Verdes and for Universal Studio tours. Winnick spent 14 years at Universal Studios, staring as a tour guide and working his way up to director of special effects and shows, including trained animal acts.\n\nMyers said their management strengths are supported by an unsurpassed group of curators who are in charge of the animals.\n\n“We need somebody to watch the business side, because we have tremendous professionals on the animal side,” Myers said. “It’s a balance.”\n\nMcClure said he depends on the animal and plant expertise of his staff and sees himself as the coordinator of a team that runs the park.\n\nBut to some of the animal caretakers they supervise, these newcomers have a distorted focus on the balance sheet instead of the animals.\n\n“Upper management doesn’t understand animal-health themes because that’s not a high priority for them,” one employee said. “So you go home with a twisted gut (when something happens to an animal) but they don’t because they’re worried about whether Canyon Café came up short that day.”\n\nSaid another, with 10 years experience at the zoo, “The emphasis of the management has certainly changed. Its’ gotten more and more removed from going a good job for the animals. When I first started at the zoo, money was not an overriding, all-encompassing concern.”\n\nAmong the controversial allocations in the zoo’s budget is $5 million a year for advertising and promotions — more than the entire budget of such other prominent zoos as Cincinnati, Denver and Los Angeles. Myers said the expenditure is necessary to draw the 4.5 million visitors to the zoo and park each year.\n\nIn addition to TV ads and a magazine, those promotions include trained-animal acts, one of the sharpest points of contention in the entertainment debate.\n\nThe Wild Animal Park features three such shows and the zoo just spent $800,000 to build it second amphitheater for a new show. But national association president Turner said the use of trained animals is becoming less common at other zoos.\n\n“Most of the zoos feel they are not in that kind of business,” Turner said. However, he added that San Diego has “a giant operation, and the revenues are very important. I know everybody has to try to make money.”\n\nWagner, the national executive director, said the animal acts he has seen in San Diego are “in good taste and educational,” but he would not use them at the Jackson, Miss., zoo where he is director.\n\n“I’m a bit of a purist,” he said. “I think trained-animal acts are fine for circuses and captive displays and conservation are for zoos.”\n\nSan Diego also excels in the scientific areas, Myers said, with a breeding program responsible for upgrading the status of white rhinos from endangered to threatened and unprecedented successes with many other species.\n\nMyers said San Diego’s shows are carefully planned to illustrate natural behaviors of the animals. Amid public criticism, Myers recently canceled plans to use non-zoo animals trained for movies in a show at the new zoo amphitheater. Zoo animals will be used instead.\n\nIn addition to questioning priorities, some zoo employees cite what they consider to be wasteful use of funds, including several exhibits they say were poorly designed, requiring repair and remodeling.\n\nA solar-heated room designed to hold up to 70 monkeys at the $809,000 breeding center, built in 1983, has been overly successful at stimulating tropical conditions. Temperatures have soared up to 150 degrees. The room has been empty since a marmoset died there last spring.\n\nCampbell said the design of the heating system is faulty, and estimates for fixing it range from $1,500 to $60,000.\n\nThe Heart of the Zoo, a facsimile of a Southeast Asian rain forest, has had several design and building changes during and after its construction two years ago. The original $2 million budget for the ape and bird complex has ballooned to $3.5 million, which even Campbell has said was “probably too much.”\n\nContractors had to uncover and reseal leaking basement walls, reshape moats around the monkey islands and darken a building to allow visitors to see through the glare in a glass enclosure. A Seattle architectural firm recently was hired to make the Siamang monkey islands escape proof.\n\nA $70,000 filtration system on fiberglass pools housing the sea lions that perform at Wegeforth Bowl has been inadequate to clear the water and has malfunctioned and drained the pools.\n\nAlthough a consultant advised replaced the filters at a cost of $150,000, zoo officials say they are withholding final payment for the system, hoping the contractor will fix it. In the meantime, sea lions are suffering from eye infections and other ailments and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has cited the zoo for potential violations of the Animal Welfare Act.\n\nIn-house workers spent several months last year renovating the Bongo exhibit, now widely scorned by zoo employees as an unnatural concrete fortress little changed by the massive remodeling effort. Although Myers said he “would have liked to see a little more softness built into it,” the exhibit has produced a burgeoning population of the exotic antelopes. “The bongos seem to like it,” he said.\n\nPlans to build a hydraulic lift for the tour bus loading docks were scrapped in 1982 after $32,000 was spent on a design and prototype that didn’t work, said zoo architect David Rice.\n\n“We see this and say, ‘Why couldn’t the money have been used for the animals? I think the animals are secondary now,” one employee said.\n\nExhibit renovation has lagged because the zoo has spent $20 million to subsidize the Wild Animal Park in the 13 years since it was opened.\n\n“I think that all their time and talent and their funds have gone to the Wild Animal Park, and they have just not kept up to date with the downtown facilities,” said Sue Pressman, former director of captive-animal exhibits for the Humane Society of America in Washington, D. C. Pressman now is a private consultant to zoos.\n\nCampbell said that spending pattern now is reversed and the park will be pushed to stand on its own.\n\nThe Wild Animal Park symbolizes the difficulty of balancing conservation with economics. The brainchild of Dr. Charles Schroeder, who retired in 1972 after 20 years as director, the Wild Animal Park was conceived as a breeding ground for endangered species. It covers 600 acres of an 1,800-acre site in the San Pasqual Valley.\n\nPart of Schroeder’s idea was to put people “in cages” by use of a monorail to view free roaming animals instead of old-fashioned exhibits in which visitors roamed free to view animals in cages.\n\nBut Schroeder’s vision of an animal preserve divided into areas resembling five geographical regions of the world did not attract the volume of visitors to put the park in the black.\n\nThus, concerts were added three years ago to draw crowds, and a “Close Encounter” program began this March 30 to make animals more accessible and the park more interesting to children. The new attractions include tours of the elephants’ bedrooms, photo opportunities with koalas, trivia questions on plaques near the exhibits and devices to test your strength against an elephant.\n\nTrustee Ivor de Kirby said reaction of visitors during the first week was enthusiastic but some animal keepers are wary of dangers and inconveniences of bring the public closer to the beasts. Myers said “all precautionary measures” have been taken to assure safety.\n\nWith the next two years, Myers hopes to build lodging — envisioned as a giant hut on stilts — where paying guests could spend the night watching the animals at the park.\n\nMyers said covered outposts will be built along the monorail this summer for daytime observation of the herds. He plans to conduct marketing surveys on the idea of the overnight accommodations, patterned after the Treetops safari hotels in Kenya.\n\nLocal developer Rick Taubman, whose family owns Seaport Village, said he originally suggested the “overnight resting place” as a way to boost the park’s income. No developer has been chosen.\n\nCampbell emphasized that the idea is “pure talk,” has not been approved by the board, and would not be built for at least four years if it were approved.\n\nTalk of future construction plans is too far off to satisfy some whose daily jobs involve animal care. While managers map out the elaborate rebuilding of the zoo and expansion of the park, animal custodians worry about the less glamorous but immediate needs of their charges.\n\nWhile some employees agree with a colleague’s assessment that the zoo has become “a madhouse of low morale,” many say they are happy and proud of their jobs caring for one of the world’s premiere collections of animals. Even those who complain bitterly insist that are not just grousing, but are hoping for constructive change.\n\nOne employee described zoo workers as “concerned professionals, people who feel let down in some of the priorities management has established.”\n\n“There are probably a lot of people on the board who think everything is fine, and then they hear a disparaging word and they think it’s coming from some troublemaker,” he said. “But it’s not. It’s from a loyal employee who wants to see things made better.”\n\n(Tribune staff writers Ann Levin and Rita Calvano also contributed to this report.)\n\nApril 18, 1985, READER.

Joan Kroc’s $3.3 million gift to Zoo, by Ann Levin, Susan Duerksen, and Rita Calvano.\n\nJoan Kroc, owner of the Padres and a millionaire philanthropist, today gave the San Diego Zoo the largest donation in its history, $3.3 million to rebuild a major portion of the zoo, including all of Cascade Canyon.\n\nKroc, the widow of McDonald’s restaurants founder Ray Kroc, pledged the money after The Tribune disclosed last month that the large-cat exhibits have failed to meet federal safety standards and that a variety of other problems plague the zoo.\n\nThe donation by Kroc will free up other money to correct problems in the area housing lions, tigers and other big cats, officials said.\n\nProblems cited by a federal inspector indicated crumbling walls and roofs, improper drainage, rusting gates and a lack of heat and light in the holding pens behind the exhibits. Some of the exhibits were built 50 years ago.\n\nZoo officials said Kroc decided to make the multi-million-dollar gift after reading newspaper reports of the structural problems.\n\nExecutive Director Douglas Myers today said the donation will be used to reconstruct the Cascade Canyon area into a major multi-species exhibit housing birds, reptiles and mammals found in Asian tropical rain forests.\n\nThe two-acre canyon will be renamed in honor of the Kroc family.\n\nThe reconstruction of the canyon is expected to cost $4 million. Zoo fund-raisers already have collected $800,000 from an anonymous donor for a Sumatran tiger exhibit that will be built at the base of the canyon.\n\nCharles Bieler, executive director emeritus of the Zoological Society of San Diego, said he received a phone call from Kroc’s office on Monday and met with her Monday afternoon to arrange the donation.\n\nAs he was presented with the check for $3.3 million today, Bieler said, “I’ve never seen so many zeroes at one time on a check. We think it’s a gift that has come at a most appropriate time, at a time of need.”\n\nThe largest prior gift to the zoo was $1.5 million in the 1960s from Elmer C. Otto. Thomas and Suzanne Warner gave $1 million to help construct the zoo’s Warner Administration Building, and $950,000 was given by Helen Woodward to help build the Heart of the Zoo exhibit.\n\nMike Sund, director of public relations of the Joan B. Kroc Foundation, read a statement from Kroc at the press conference today:\n\n“I am making this personal gift on behalf of my late husband Ray and our family because we have always felt that, in addition to being the finest zoo in the world, the San Diego Zoo literally provides something for everyone in this diverse community of our.\n\n“Much like the National League Championship our Padres brought home last year, the zoo is a source of pride and entertainment that young and old, rich and poor, can share and enjoy. Best of all, the zoo has never had a bad year!\n\n“We are especially pleased that our gift will help to create a simulated natural habitat where these animals can live in a way that reflects appreciation for the dignity of all living things.”\n\nSund said today’s $3.3 million contribution is a personal gift by Kroc.\n\nKroc also gave a personal $100,000 gift to establish a family survivors fund for the victims of the San Ysidro massacre. Which was followed by a $1million donation from McDonald’s restaurants.\n\nWith the new donation in hand, zoo officials expect to break ground for a new tiger exhibit this fall and complete it before next summer. Construction of new lion housing will begin next year, Zoo Executive Director Doug Myers said.\n\n“The dollars seem to be in hand to accomplish that schedule,” Myers said.\n\nWhen the new Sumatran tiger exhibit at the base of Cascade Canyon is completed next spring, the lions will take over the old tiger housing, which is in slightly better shape than the lion exhibit, Myers said. The lion building then will be torn down and rebuilt.\n\nEventually, the entire cat and dog canyon is to be rebuilt as part of a 35-year plan to reorganize the zoo into “bioclimatic” zones reproducing the vegetation and animal groupings of certain areas of the world. Plans call for a mountainous region exhibit in the canyon.\n\nIn the meantime, though, the antiquated exhibits must be rebuilt for the health and safety of animals and visitors.\n\nThe Asian rain forest complex will be located just inside the zoo’s entrance, between the reptile house and primate exhibits. It is expected to be completed within a year.\n\nThe architectural design of the complex will be done by Jones and Jones, a zoological architectural firm from Seattle. Bieler said he expects to take bids for construction by August or September.\n\nThe new exhibit will include enclosures for crocodiles, a python, Malayan tapirs and a species of wild swine as well as a variety of birds.\n\nThe concrete structures housing and displaying the lions, tigers, jaguars, leopards and some species of dogs failed a U. S. Department of Agriculture building inspection a year ago and a re-inspection yesterday.\n\nReports filed by federal veterinarian Frank Enders last year detailed cracks on the walls, crumbling roofs, rusting gates, improper drainage, and a lack of heat and light as deficiencies that must be corrected to meet federal standards.\n\nEnders had set a one-year deadline for the exhibits to be upgraded to meet federal standards. On a re-inspection yesterday, he found that the problems have not been fixed, but said the zoo is making substantial progress.\n\nEnders said he will recommend that the zoo be given another year to rebuild the structures before it is cited for violating the Animal Welfare Act.\n\nHe said some of the buildings must be torn down and rebuilt, and others housing jaguars and leopards require further remodeling.\n\nThe decision on granting the zoo a one-year extension of the deadline for correcting the problems will be made by the Department of Agriculture’s regional office in Sacramento, after Enders files his re-inspection report.\n\nAccompanied by zoo officials, Enders took a cluster of reporters on a tour of the cat and dog housing yesterday. He said he was impressed by the care animals are given, despite substandard conditions.\n\nSimilar problems were fund in the enclosures for Chinese dholes, a red dog. Several zoo employees linked the inadequate heat and housing to the hypothermia deaths of a litter of dhole pups in 1982.\n\nIn a recent series of articles examining the 69-year old zoo, The Tribune also disclosed water quality problems in the sea lion tanks and structural defects in a new $3.5 million primate exhibit.\n\nPart of the problem in the cat and dog canyon is a lack of electricity, which is needed for lighting, space heaters and water-heated sleeping pads. Some areas had temporary electricity from a power source at the top of the canyon, but City of San Diego building inspectors yesterday required the removal of indoor wiring that had been strung illegally through the trees.\n\nTwo days after The Tribune story noting lack of heat and light in Cat Canyon appeared, the zoo accepted bids from San Diego electrical contractors to bury a cable along the canyon.\n\nOne jaguar exhibit has been renovated and four other large cat areas are scheduled for the same treatment within the next two months. The renovation, at a cost of about $10,000 per exhibit, includes replacing concrete floors with dirt and grass, adding skylights to provide better lighting in the holding pens behind the exhibits and installing specially heated sleeping pads.\n\nApril 25, 1985, San Diego Tribune, A-12. Zoo removes unsafe wiring; some animals to lack heat.\n\nUnprotected indoor wiring was found strung through trees at the San Diego Zoo yesterday by city building inspectors.\n\nThe illegal wiring was immediately removed by zoo workers from the cat and dog canyon, where it had been used to power water-heated sleeping pads in some of the animals’ holding pens.\n\nCity officials decided this month to begin enforcing building codes at the zoo, after The Tribune reported that most construction there has been done without building permits or inspections. In the past, city officials said, they have not routinely inspected the zoo.\n\nThe Romex wiring used at the zoo is intended only for the inside of walls in residential buildings and must be enclosed in a metal sheath even inside walls in commercial structures, said Dan Cole, city supervisor of permit issuance. He said the wiring is not safe for outdoor use.\n\nCarmi Penny, mammals curator at the zoo, said the removal of the wiring has caused greater danger to the animals’ health because they no longer have the heated beds.\n\n“We’re not electrical engineers. It works; we’ve all used it,” Penny said.\n\nA temporary generator is expected to be installed today to provide power for lighting at some of the exhibits. Within a year, zoo officials said, permanent power sources should be installed throughout the zoo.\n\nMay 26, 1985, San Diego Union, E-1.

The Globe spins mightily; the artistic bastion is built on solid 50-year foundation, by Welton Jones.\n\nHumanity should have a history as evenly productive as the first half-century of the Old Globe Theater.\n\nSince Thomas Wood Stevens and Marc T. Nielsen signed an agreement 50 years ago Wednesday to provide the California Pacific International Exposition with bits of Shakespeare in a replica of his Elizabethan theater, that certain corner of Balboa Park has led a charmed existence as a bubble of culture in an environment often indifferent and occasionally hostile.\n\nEvery time there’s been a crisis, the necessary solution has been discovered close at hand and the Old Globe has emerged stronger than before.\n\nAt the end of its first half century, the Globe’s history falls into six eras, the Exposition years, the San Diego Community Theater years, the dormant war years, the long slow growth from 1947 to 1971, the maturing years around the 1978 fire and the professional era which began with the opening of the new Old Globe in 1982.\n\nHalfway through the fourth season of the latest era, it’s still too early to see the future. Programming since 1982 has been conservative, the risks have been carefully calculated. The theater’s artistic integrity is unquestioned but there are few surprises.\n\nToday the Old Globe Theater is the IBM of the San Diego cultural establishment, a trim, efficient and self-confident enterprise which also is the only performing arts management able to claim 50 years in the same or, for that matter, any location.\n\nRare indeed are the unsold seats to Globe shows, although the theater’s board of directors refuses to let the staff sell more than 90 percent subscriptions to the dozen productions each year, just so there will be something to sell at the box office.\n\nFew frontiers have been pushed back by the Globe during all those seasons, true. But theatrical frontiersmen usually find early graves, whereas the Globe just keeps on serving its audience, all its risk in context.\n\nJust as the politicians main job is to get elected, a theater company’s first task may be survival. As is shown by its production history, the Globe knows how to survive and even flourish.\n\nThe history of the Old Globe forms a long, smooth curve with a blank over the World War II years and an abrupt upsweep at the end.\n\nSoaring above the war, fire, fads, economic fluctuations, intrigue, personnel turnovers and all the other churning signs of life, the Old Globe’s productions have continued to flow in a serene, uninterrupted progression which says more about the theater’s management than any other tribute could.\n\nSince the traumatic arson fire which destroyed the original Globe that dismal morning in March 1978, the theater not only has recovered, it has prospered.\n\nThe annual budget that fire year was about $300,000. Today, it’s more than $6 million. The difference is that between a nice, cost-effective, amateur community theater and one of the country’s major professional companies.\n\nIn retrospect, as always with Globe history, the 1978 fire can be seen to have been a blessing in disguise, the biggest in an ongoing series of jolts which may explain why the theater never has sunk into atrophy.\n\nThe Globe was born fighting for its life. Thomas Wood Stevens was a scholar turned entrepreneur by the Depression. A 15-year veteran of the Carnegie Tech Drama Department in Pittsburgh, the country’s first college-level theater school, he had founded the Goodman Theater in Chicago only to be fired after five years for setting artistic standards too high.\n\nIn 1934, the “Century of Progress” exposition in Chicago was entering its second season and was in need of some good solid midway attractions like the successful “Belgian Village” and “Streets of Paris” exhibits. Stevens was hired to provide the centerpiece of a “Merrie England” exhibit, with an Elizabethan theme, specifically five short Shakespeare plays a day.\n\nAs is well-known now, Stevens and his assistant, B. Iden Payne, filled the bill so well that the operators of the 1935 California Pacific International Exposition in San Diego lured them to Balboa Park hoping to duplicate their success.\n\nWhat is frequently forgotten, though, is the fact than Stevens and his people were not opportunists or charlatans, butchering Shakespeare for a couple of bucks. “The really hard thing,” Stevens wrote to a friend in 1934, “is the cutting of the plays — we should have that done by somebody who hates Shakespeare, instead of people like Iden and me.” Still, 14 plays were eventually hacked to a length ranging from 36 minutes for “A Comedy of Errors” to 45 minutes for “Julius Caesar” and a company of actors which eventually numbered such luminaries as Martha Scott, Sam Wannamaker, MacDonald Carey, Bertram Tanswell and Irene Tedrow was hired to perform five of these a day.\n\nIn the second year of the San Diego exposition, Stevens and Payne were long gone, but the replacement troupe — called the Fortune Company — carried on with notable success until the fair closed that fall.\n\nThe structure built for the shows and called “the Old Globe” was intended to be a temporary building and the fair management already had sold it to wreckers for $400 before local theater patrons awoke to the fact that the only professional house in town was about to be trashed.\n\nThe first galvanizing crisis produced a fund-raising committee that found the money, purchased the building and prepared it for the first season of the newly-formed San Diego Community Theater. The Globe officially reopened December 2, 1937, with John Van Druten’s “The Distaff Side,” directed by Luther M. Kennett, Jr. and featuring, in a supporting role, a young San Diegan named Craig Noel.\n\nThe playhouse taken over by the San Diego Community Theater was no more a “replica” of the original Elizabethan Globe than Thomas Wood Stevens was the reincarnation of Shakespeare. What had started out as a vaguely authentic structure open to the sky had already been modified to an enclosed hall with a proscenium arch stage.\n\nAt the end of that first 1937-38 season, there was $17.70 in the treasury (according to John Eugene Donnelly’s invaluable 1957 San Diego State University’s thesis, which provided most of the historical material included here) and a second season was inevitable.\n\nBy the time World War II shut down the theater’s operations, Noel had replaced Kennett as the resident director and the company had presented 39 shows, including one world premiere (Lynn Rigg’s “A World Elsewhere”) and one tour to Los Angeles (Mark Reed’s “Yes, My Darling Daughter”).\n\nIndirectly, the war was yet another break for the Globe. Craig Noel had resigned from the theater to go to Hollywood that October, 1941. Both his career and the Globe’s might have been different if there hadn’t been a war to fight, but within a couple of months, along with most of his generation, Craig Noel joined the Army. He came home just in time to direct the first postwar show at the Globe, and he’s been there ever since, the premiere symbol of the theater’s leadership continuity.\n\nAfter the war, it took many months to jiggle the Globe loose from the Navy and from a city administration that seemed to have forgotten who had turned it into an asset. An exchange of correspondence in the Donnelly thesis indicates that the city wasn’t sure any group should be awarded exclusive use of the reopened Globe.\n\nThat crisis was the first big one for the new man of the hour at the Globe, Lowell Davies, who became president in January 1945 and served until 1976, when he became chairman of the board.\n\nIn Davies and Noel, the Globe had a leadership tandem of energy and sophistication unmatched in San Diego arts history before or since. Each respected the other and neither infringed on the other’s turf. Davies kept the theater open and Noel provided the reason why.\n\nFrom 1947 until 1962, when William Roesch was signed as second staff director, Craig Noel directed seven or eight shows a year. All but four were presented on the main stage of the Globe during that period and some for the summer Shakespeare festivals as well.\n\nThe first festival in the summer of 1949, brought B. Iden Payne back to town for a production of “Twelfth Night,” co-sponsored by San Diego State. Payne returned for two shows each summer through 1952, when San Diego State withdrew from the partnership, taking its financial support with it.\n\nYet another crisis loomed, with yet another smooth, natural solution. One of the biggest Broadway hits of the period, Joshua Logan and Thomas Heggen’s “Mister Roberts” came available that summer and gave the Globe its first really big, long-running (69 performances) hit.\n\nAnd the following season when the members began to grumble about the lack of Shakespeare, the Globe was able to reinstate the festival with the first of its three-show summer season of rotating repertory.\n\nTo this day, audiences still complain when there’s not enough Shakespeare in the Globe’s schedule.\n\nDuring the 1950s the Globe settled into a peaceful era of five or six amateur winter productions and three professional summer shows. Usually the former paid for the latter, but there were notable summer hits, too.\n\nIn the season of 1961-62, the Globe expanded its program to Sherwood Hall in La Jolla, with a three-play schedule of fare somewhat experimental — Jean Anouilh, Arch Oboler and Edward Albee that year. The audience was there, and, in 1963-64, the shows were moved from La Jolla to the Falstaff Tavern, an auxiliary building next to the Globe, originally built as a restaurant during the 1935 exposition.\n\nBy the 1968-69 season, the tavern had become the present Cassius Carter Center Stage and the Globe’s annual pattern had become five shows each on the main stage and the Carter during the winter with a three-show Shakespeare repertory and a fourth production at the Carter for summer. This arrangement continued until the 1978 fire, when the company moved its Globe winter productions downtown and its Shakespeare Festival to the temporary outdoor Festival Stage, designed and built in just four months.\n\nThe Globe was ill-prepared to mount a major fund-raising effort. Decades of careful management had brought the theater a stability rare in the business, with an enormous proportion of its operating budget earned at the box office. The theater board and staff had virtually no experience in soliciting grants or major donations, and the early efforts were painfully ineffective.\n\nBut new heroes emerged, a new generation of leadership, including Stacey Sullivan, Deborah Szekezy, James Mulvaney and James Milch, and the Globe gave itself on-the-job training so effective that the company emerged from the fire crisis with an entirely new, completely modernized approach to operations as a year-round professional company.\n\nWhen the new $6 million Old Globe was finished and opened in 1982 several changes took place. Noel replaced himself with three people — Artistic Director Jack O’Brien, Managing Director Thomas Hall and himself as executive producer — and the company replaced its winter company of faithful, unpaid, amateur actors with professionals performing a winter season of six shows on the two inside stages and a summer rotation of six other shows on all three stages.\n\nLast year, the Globe ended years of quiet struggle with environmentalists by securing City Council approval to make the outdoor Festival Stage a permanent facility, but plans to remodel it in memory of Lowell Davies, who died in 1983, seemed to languish.\n\nEnter the latest disguised blessing in the form of yet another arson fire which destroyed the Festival Stage. Once more the Globe was forced into fund-raising and rebuilding. The Lowell Davies Festival Theater will open this week.\n\nBut all the changes weren’t buildings or personnel. The Globe’s repertoire was evolving too.\n\nThe first two seasons of the San Diego Community Theater provided Broadway hits with certain whimsical variations — from “Once in a Lifetime” to “Hedda Gabler” in 1937-38, “Heartbreak House” to “Three Men on a Horse” the next season — but thereafter the programming settled into a steady diet of Broadway mainstream which persisted well into the 1970s.\n\nThere was an occasional musical comedy — “Lady in the Dark,” “On the Town,” “The Boy Friend” (twice) — and the most popular works by controversial new playwrights — Arthur Miller’s “Death of a Salesman” and “A View from the Bridge,” Tennessee William’s “A Streetcar Named Desire” and “The Rose Tattoo” — but the majority of the programming during the amateur winter seasons came from the middle of the road, the staple of stock theaters around the country.\n\nBetween 1947 and 1971, the playwright with the most plays produced on the Old Globe stage, second only to Shakespeare was Norman Krasna, with “John Loves Mary,” “Dear Ruth,” “Who Was That Lady I Saw You With” and “Sunday in New York.”\n\nBut the changes begun in the Sherwood Hall season of 1961-62 had continued to eat away at the theater’s reputation for winter fluff, with playwrights such as Jean Genet, Harold Pinter, Shaw, O’Neill, Pirandello, Brecht and Brendan Behan attracting enthusiastic audiences.\n\nIn 1971-72, the main stage fare began a slow shift away from the lightweight with productions of John Guare’s “House of Blue Leaves” and Tom Stoppard’s “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.” The Krasna days were gone for good.\n\nAfter that season, mainstage programming grew nearer to that on the Cassius Carter Stage. Arthur Kopit and Joe Orton were represented the next year. Tennessee Williams and Brecht the year after that. By the time of the 1978 fire, plays were being assigned based on which stage they fit best.\n\nPart of the change can be attributed to the beginning of subscription sales, in the 1973-74 season. Prior to that year, patrons could purchase coupons good for any show during the season, so box-office returns were carefully watched before plays were chosen. By buying subscriptions, theatergoers received preferred seating in exchange for their faith that the theater would provide good shows.\n\nBut another reason for the change in programming was the Globe’s participation in a national trend toward a more institutionalized theater, a theater not tied directly to box-office sales but free to pursue quality with the advance income of subscriptions and grants, a theater where artists could work in a situation which inspired quality while providing a decent wage.\n\nIn an era with no dominant playwrights, production became more important. Audiences all over the country began to realize that Shaw and Ibsen could be exciting, given the proper staging, as this season’s Broadway hits. With their future guaranteed at least for the season at hand, the institutional theaters could leave the commercial plays to tours and dinner theaters, concentrating more on mining the past and developing the future.\n"
