        "text": "Sporting Win Two More Preseason Games - Into Disney Soccer Final\n\nVince Lombardi said \"winning is a habit\" and Sporting KC is taking that saying to heart this preseason. KC picked up two more win this preseason to improve their record to 8-0-1 this preseason with wins against Indy Eleven and the Montreal Impact.\n\nIn both games Sporting KC was forced to come from behind to win the game. In their first game against the NASL side KC scored the first goal from the penalty spot by Claudio Bieler. Before half time though Indy scored two goals through Pedro Mendes. In the second half KC leveled the game as Bieler got his second off an assist from Adnan Gabeljic. Bieler then finished up his hattrick with another goal from the penalty spot, his fourth goal of the preseason. Bieler then turned provider on the fourth goal, feeding Mikey Lopez who touched the ball past the keeper to score. The assist was Bieler's sixth of the preseason. KC ended up winning 4-2. Here are the highlights.\n\nIn the second game, KC twice came from behind to top the Montreal Impact 3-2 and book themselves a spot in the final of the Disney Pro Soccer Classic. KC fell behind in the very first minute of the game as Sanna Nyassi beat Jon Kempin. Only a few minutes later though KC earned a penalty kick. Sal Zizzo crossed the ball into the box for Dom Dwyer. The English forward though ended up getting knocked down in the box and a penalty was called. Dwyer stepped up and buried the PK to level the score at 1-1. Montreal would retake the lead from the penalty spot themselves. After KC failed to clear a corner, the ball was crossed back into the box, over the heads of Aureilen Collin and Matt Besler to Collen Warner. Besler attempted to recover and ended up fouling the Montreal midfielder in the box. Felipe stepped up and buried the PK as Montreal retook the lead.\n\nUp to that point the Impact had been the team that had controlled much of the game keeping KC pinned back in their own end. But before the end of the half KC found themselves level again. Seth Sinovic picked out Graham Zusi running towards the end line. Zusi crossed the ball where Dwyer met it with a great snap header that went into the far corner leveling the game at 2-2.\n\nThe second half saw KC come out much better. They pressured the Impact and controlled more of the game. Some good goalkeeping by Evan Bush kept Zusi from getting on the score board after a give and go with Dwyer. The rebound fell to Zizzo but he couldn't get his shot on frame from a tight angle. In the 75th minute though KC took the lead. After some really good ball movement by KC that saw them move the ball from one side of the field to the other, the ball then went back into the middle for Alex Martinez. The draft pick slide a through ball into the box for Sinovic. Sinovic then played the ball across the box to an onrushing Zizzo who fired the ball home to take a 3-2 lead. KC continued to have the better of play for the final 15 minutes, but couldn't add to their lead.\n\nWith the win, KC advanced to the championship game of the Pro Soccer Classic on Saturday where they'll face the Columbus Crew.\n\nComets Get Second Win in 24 Hours\n\ness than 24 hours after their final regular season home game last night, the Comets traveled nearly 600 miles north to face the league leading Milwaukee Wave. Behind a solid defense that only gave up two goals in the run of play, the Comets got their second victory over the weekend, beating the Wave 15-9 at the U.S. Cellular Arena.\n\nThis matchup of the league’s top two scoring teams started out as a defensive showcase. The teams traded stretches of possession with goalkeepers Danny Waltman of the Comets and Marcel Feenstra of the Wave each standing tall in their nets. Missouri’s John Sosa broke the stalemate in the final minute of the opening quarter, as the Comets led 2-0 after the first fifteen minutes\n\nDefender Victor Quiroz got the Wave on the board after he caught Waltman too far off his line and launched a shot from just outside the Milwaukee zone. The Wave’s 3-2 lead only held for 34 seconds as Milan Ivanovic answered back for the Comets. Ivanovic found the net again three minutes later to grow the Comets lead to 6-3.\n\nJust prior to the end of the half, a Milwaukee pass sent across the Comets penalty box careened off the hand of Missouri’s Sosa. The Wave’s Guiliano Oliviero converted the resulting penalty kick to get his team within 6-5 at the halftime break.\n\nDefenses reasserted themselves in the third quarter as these two rivals fought for dominance in the game. The two teams traded goals in the third quarter with Lucas Rodriguez of Missouri and Marcio Leite of Milwaukee each finding the back of the net. After three periods, the Comets held a tight 8-7 lead.\n\nMarcio Leite briefly regained the lead for Milwaukee just after the fourth quarter began, beating Waltman to his right side. Holding a 9-8 lead, the Wave fell into a defensive shell to try and preserve the lead and extend their nineteen game home winning streak.\n\nAs the only team to defeat the Wave this season, the Comets were confident down the stretch. Sosa found himself with the ball in the left corner of the Milwaukee end and laid off an easy pass to Lucas Rodriguez who hit the far side netting with just over three minutes remaining in the game. Stefan Stokic and Brian Harris each scored on the Wave’s sixth attacker, giving Missouri the 15-9 victory.\n\nThe Comets improve to 12-6 on the season and give them a 1.5 game lead over Syracuse for the third seed in the MISL Playoffs. The Wave drop to 15-3, with all three losses coming at the hands of the Comets.\n\nThe Comets are on the road for their final two games of the regular season, February 27th against St. Louis and March 2nd against Milwaukee. Missouri returns home for Game #1 of the MISL Playoffs on March 9th at 3:10p.m. CT. Fans can receive FREE playoff tickets by purchasing 2014-2015 Missouri Comets Season Tickets by March 4th.\n\nComets Close Home Schedule With Win\n\nThe Missouri Comets closed out their regular season home schedule tonight in a tight game against their cross state rivals the St. Louis Ambush. Neither team was able to get too far ahead throughout the night as the teams traded goals for much of the game. The Ambush got the scoring just over a minute into the game as Danny Waltman tried to cut out a through ball. Unfortunately his sliding clearance hit off of St. Louis forward Corey Adamson and in for a 2-0 lead. The Comets responded immediately as Stefan St. Louis got the ball in the corner and then crossed to the back post where newly acquiured Max Touloute knocked it home to make it 2-2. A little over three minutes in though the Ambush were back in front. Danny Waltman got caught up field and the Ambush countered. Lucky for Waltman, Andre Braithwaite got back and was able to block the shot. Unfortunately off the insuing restart, Odaine Sinclair was picked out by Michael Roach and the Ambush were back in front. Again the Comets response was immediate and again it came from the combination of St. Louis and Touloute. St. Louis got played through on a break away, but cut back as his defender rushed past him. He squared to Touloute who fired home to make it 4-4. The Ambush high pressured for much of the rest of the quarter. The Ambush also got some help as John Sosa picked up a blue card. Jake Bleyenberg took advantage of the power play and scored to give the Ambush the lead. Before the quarter was through the Ambush had extended their lead to four as Mike Mesle fired a shot into the corner to make it 8-4 Ambush after one quarter.\n\nEarly on in the second quarter the Comets had a number of good opportunities, especially for Milan Ivanovic. He had one chance saved by St. Louis goalkeeper Greg Crook and another hit the inside of the post. Finally he found net just two minutes in on a cross by Leo Gibson that IVanovic headed home to cut the St. Louuis lead to 8-6. Just over five minutes in the Comets went on the power play after Gibson was knocked into the boards. It didn't take long for the Comets to take advantage. After passing the ball around at the top of the box, Lucas Rodriguez played the ball into the corner for Bryan Perez. Perez turned and fired a shot into the roof of the net to tie the game at 8-8. Less than a minute later, the Ambush were back on top. After a Comets attack, Sinclair sprung Jeff DiMaria on a counter. He fired a shot from just outside the 3 point line that beat Waltman and made it 11-8 Ambush. Once again the Comets responded almost immediately as Perez got his second goal of the game. A cross by Ramone Palmer was cut out, but Perez was crashing the box and knocked the deflected cross past Crook and into the net to make it 11-10 Ambush.\n\nShortly after the half way point of the quarter, tempers started to get a little heated. After a foul by Sinclair on Lucas Rodriguez, the Comets midfielder elbowed the Ambush forward earning him a blue card and bringing the teams together in the corner. After the teams were separated and the referees had a chance to talk it over, the Ambush's Roach was also sent to the box for pushing. With the game 4v4 for two minutes, the Comets were the agressors pinning the Ambush in their own end of the field. After the Comets lost the ball in the Ambush end, Gibson won the ball back and played it to Ramone Palmer. Palmer's shot to the back post hit the wall and bounced to an unmarked Alex Megson who tapped the ball home to give the Comets their first lead of the game at 12-11.\n\nOne thing over the course of the evening that turned into a problem for the Ambush was their distribution out of the back. They gave the Comets a number of restarts at the top of the arc because of their playing the ball out of bounds. With just under two minutes to play the Comets took advantage of one of those opportunities. Rodriguez touched the ball to John Sosa whose shot went through the wall and into the net to give the Comets a 14-11 lead. The Comets almost added to their lead in the final seconds but Crook made a couple saves and Touloute had a header saved off the line.\n\nEarly in the third quarter, the Ambush cut the lead to one point off a restart. The ball was played into the corner for Sinclair who tapped the ball across the box for Mesle who put the ball home to make it 14-13. The Comets continued to control the play in the game, keeping the Ambush pinned deep. Just after the six minute mark the Comets got the lead back to three as Gibson won the ball from Crook in the Ambush end. After turning to face up field he fired a ball to the back post. Sosa was there to turn the ball home and make it 16-13. As the quarter wore on though the Ambush started to get more of the play and they were the ones pinning the Comets in deep. The Comets tried to use Gibson as an outlet, but Crook did good coming off his line. Until with just over a minute left Gibson was used as an outlet and got a touch past Crook. In the corner with no angle at goal, Gibson hit the ball off the wall into the middle where Ramone Palmer had arrived to tap the ball home and give the Comets a five point lead. The Ambush closed the quarter book ending it with a goal in the final minute. Again the Comets were trying to clear their lines. This time the ball ran into the referee who couldn't get out of the way. This left the ball in the Comets end And Adamson fed the ball to Bleyenberg who hit a turning volley that beat Waltman to make it 18-15.\n\nIn the fourth quarter the Ambush continued to push while the Comets relied more on the counter. Again the Comets were using Gibson and it paid off about three and a half minutes in as Waltman played the ball down field to Gibson. The forward turned his man and fired a shot inside Crook's near post to make it 20-15. A couple minutes later the Comets found themselves back on the power play. Chad Vandergriffe had lost the ball to Ramone Palmer at the Comets yellow line. After the ball had been played wide to Stefan Stokic Vandergriffe came in with a sliding challenge that drew a blue card. It took less than 10 seconds for the Comets to take advantage as Rodriguez picked out Gibson just outside the yellow line. He shrugged off two defenders and fired from 3 point range beating Crook to make it 23-15. The Ambush didn't give up though and continued pushing Sinclair got his second goal of the night eight and a half minutes into the fourth quarter when his shot took a deflection and rolled past a wrong footed Waltman. Then Chris Mattingly got on the board to cut the lead to four. After a shot had skimmed around the top of the goal to the far side, Mattingly settled and fired inside Waltman's post to make it 23-19. A minute later though the Comets responded as Brian Harris raced the length of the floor down the sideline before cutting inside and firing a rocket from three point range that beat Crook to make it 26-19.\n\nWith the three score game and just two and a half minutes left, Waltman made way for Brendan Allen for his MISL debut. The Ambush controlled much of the play in the final couuple minutes but didn't go with the sixth attacker. With less than 30 seconds left the Ambush cut the lead back to five poinst as a Kory Dowell shot off the boards fell to Richard Schmermund who knocked the ball home to make close out the scoring.\n\nThe Comets now head out on the road for their final three games, a pair against Milwaukee with a game in St. Louis sandwiched in between before the playoffs. Current the Comets hold the three seed in the playoffs and would play the Baltimore Blast if the playoffs began today.\n\nSporting Win Two Preseason Games\n\nSporting KC picked up 2 more preseason wins today down in Florida. In the morning game, a reserve heavy lineup took on Florida Gulf Coast. Adnan Gabeljic scored a pair of goals and Jacob Peterson added a third. Florida Gulf Coast's goal came from the penalty spot. Only two players not under contract started the game for KC, Gabeljic and goalkeeper, Gorrick (who I assume is Devala Gorrick).\n\nIn the afternoon game, Sporting took on Fluminense's U23 team. Fluminense started the game well enough, but didn't really test Jon Kempin, who was getting his first minutes of the preseason. Going forward KC looked the better side. Jimmy Medranda forced a nice save by their keeper that turned into a corner for KC. Shortly after that, CJ Sapong had a fantastic opportunity as the ball was played in to Graham Zusi who took a touch then flicked the ball through to Sapong who got in behind Fluminense's defense, but a recovery tackle and interference from the goalkeeper saw the ball go wide of the goal. Finally in the 40th minute, KC's pressure paid off. Medranda won the ball near midfield and played the ball up field to Claudio Bieler. Bieler picked out Paulo Nagamura who fired a shot from distance. His shot skipped off the wet surface and through the hands of the Fluminense keeper and into the net for a 1-0 lead.\n\nThe second half saw KC come out and really control the game. It took only 10 minutes for KC to double their lead. Again it was Medranda helping to set it up, playing a chip in to the back post for Bieler. Bieler headed the ball back across the box to the penalty spot. There was no Sporting player there, but the ball continued to roll across the box to Medranda who fired a shot that went under the Fluminense keeper and into the net. Only three minutes later KC added another goal with Bieler again being involved. Chance Myers played the ball in to Bieler who cut the ball back to an on rushing Nagamura who fired a shot that went through the hands of Fluminense's goalkeeper. The Brazilian side had a few chances down the stretch, but didn't really test Kempin in goal much as KC went to the top of their group at the Disney Pro Soccer Classic with 6 points.\n\nBieler's three assists, even against inferior competition is very encouraging, and he looked good outside those three assists. He looks to have picked up his energy level on the field to fit more with what Peter Vermes wants out of his forwards. And if he is, that could be big for KC this year. The other player that had an impressive performance was Medranda who was aggressive both physically and attacking wise. He wasn't afraid to take on defenders. On the surface he looks like he'd be well able to take the minutes that KC looks like they could lose from Peterson Joseph.\n\nA Look at Heineman's Q/A on Twitter Tonight\n\nTonight while on his way to Orlando, Robb Heineman did another one of his impromptu Twitter Q/A's. As always, there were a number of lighthearted questions and some trolling, but there were some good questions in there as well that he answered.\n\nOne of the early questions that Heineman was asked had to do with the team adding players to the current squad. A number of fans have questioned whether KC would add to their roster and if they could possibly fall behind other teams. Heineman's response to the question doesn't sound to optimistic at least at this moment.\n\nIn regards to the recent rumors about Juniors signing, Erik Palmer-Brown and Juventus, Heineman responded \"Noooooo\" when asked if the team had agreed to sell him abroad. And take it for what you will, but Heineman also had some high praise for the 16 year old later:\n\nHe also fielded questions about the state of the league as it is now. Specifically he was asked if he felt he was concerned that KC hadn't done enough to improve while other teams like Toronto and DC had. Heineman said he wasn't concerned about that. But when questioned further about whether he was concerned about smaller market teams being \"out-priced,\" Heineman responded with an affirmative. And it's certainly a concern that I think many KC fans feel, especially having seen similar things happen with the Royals over the years as the team has been \"out-priced\" (plenty of that of their own doing). Another question in that same vein asked if a 4th designated player spot was inevitable, to which Heineman responded no. That topic had come up for discussion recently with the fact that the Seattle Sounders had been linked with Didier Drogba. With them already having three DP's on their roster, assumption immediately turned to the league adding another DP spot for teams to use for Seattle to bring in the Ivory Coast international.\n\nA topic that Heineman has used to troll numerous times in the past is the playing surface, starting the infamous \"blue turf\" a few years ago. When asked about the surface tonight, he said that the field would be changed to Bermuda grass this summer. When jokingly asked about the blue turf though, Heineman gave a response that I'm sure will cause worry for a number of fans around the league:\n\nThe bane of many MLS fans' existence, turf. It'd be extremely disappointing if KC were forced to install turf at Sporting Park, especially since only a few years ago Sporting's grounds crew were given awards for the work that they'd done at Community America Ballpark. Hopefully the fungus, or disease, or whatever was causing the problem is resolved with the switch to Bermuda grass and we don't have to see a game played on turf at Sporting Park.\n\nHeineman also reiterated a comment he made in an earlier Q/A in regards to a USL-Pro team for Kansas City. The team recently signed an agreement with the Oklahoma City Energy to be their affiliate, but Heineman said that OnGoal is still working on creating their own USL-Pro team, similar to the LA Galaxy II that was announced recently. Whether this team would be KC based or potentially in another market is certainly something that will likely be discussed.\n\nAnother thing in the Q/A tonight that I liked were his comments regarding a TV deal. Heineman was asked about an expanded TV deal that would see KC expand outside the KC area. In the past the team has made references to wanting to be a regional team that could have fans throughout the Midwest. Heineman in response to the question said that they are apparently looking to broadcast games in 5 states. Later in the Q/A when asked by the American Outlaws chapter of Sioux Falls, if they'd be able to watch games on local TV he said yes. So that would mean Kansas, Missouri, and South Dakota would seem to be three of the five states. I could also see the likes of Nebraska, Iowa, and Oklahoma being included in that list of five when things are all said and done. I love the idea of KC becoming a more regional team in regards to pulling in fans. They're solidifying themselves in the KC metro area, and with them doing that, they can now look to pull in people from around the region.\n\nThe topic that probably brought up the most questions tonight though was the possibility of a summer friendly for Sporting KC this year. Heineman shot down the idea of a friendly against a Bundesliga team and a rematch against Manchester United. But did say Sporting Park when asked about a venue, and that he'd \"given plenty of hints\" in regards to the team.\n\nSo the question becomes was this Tweet from the 14th a hint:\n\nIf so could it be a reference to the rumored Manchester City friendly that Oriol Rosell let slip in an interview? That would make some sense, but then again, City is playing in the Guinness International Champions Cup in the US from July 26th through August 4th. So who knows, it might not have been a hint at all, maybe he just likes Charles Dickens.\n\nOn one final question that is a personal crusade of mine, Heineman was asked about the soccer hall of fame and bringing it to KC. This is something I would truly love, specifically the archives (which I would love to work at). In the past it's something that's been brought up, specifically in conjunction with the training complex that OnGoal wants to build with US Soccer. This time Heineman again left the door open for it, but said that the format needs to be considered.\n\nComets Blow Away the Roar\n\nThe Missouri Comets blew out the Pennsylvania Roar in a lopsided win at the Independence Events Center, 24-4 thanks to four goals by Leo Gibson. A little over two minutes into the game, the Comets grabbed the lead. Brian Harris received a pass and set up a 3 point shot. His shot was going wide, but Lucas Rodriguez was at the back post to re-direct the ball into the net to give the Comets a 2-0 lead. The lead didn't last long though as the Roar came back down the field with Max Touloute roofing a shot on Danny Waltman to level the game at 2-2. That's the closest the Roar would get the rest of the night. The Comets regained the lead after four minutes as Ramone Palmer redirected a Gibson shot into the net to make it 4-2. Around the midpoint of the quarter, the Comets found themselves on the power play due to a dangerous play. It took almost the entire penalty but the Comets took advantage as Rodriguez picked out Gibson at the top of the box, his shot took a deflection and went in to make it 6-2. The Comets continued to pressure and just over 11 minutes in, Alex Megson got on the scorers sheet as he turned a rebounded shot by Stefan St. Louis into the net to make it 8-2. With just under two and a half minutes left, the Comets made it 10-2 as John Sosa picked out Bryan Perez unmarked at the back post on a restart and Perez fired home to make it 10-2 after one quarter.\n\nThe second quarter saw the Comets continue to pressure and just over six minutes in, Gibson had his second as he fired home from a Sosa free kick to give the Comets a 10 point lead. Just over the half way point in the quarter the Roar got a goal back as Chris Williams and Jerjer Gibson broke on a 2v1 with Danny Waltman. Williams laid it off to Gibson who tapped home to make it 12-4. A little over a minute later though Gibson completed his hattrick. On a long ball over the top, the Roar keeper, Scott Krotee over committed and Gibson was able to touch the ball around him and into the corner. Gibson raced to the ball and had little angle to shoot, but without much support took his chance and the ball hit off a Roar defender and in to make it 14-4. The Comets weren't done in the half either as St. Louis found the net off an assist from Harris. Then with less than a minute left the Comets twice found the net. First Megson won the ball in the corner and squared a pass into the middle where Harris bundled the ball into the net to make it 18-4. Then with 1 second left on a restart, Rodriguez touched the ball to Sosa who fired home to give the Comets 20 points in the first half.\n\nThe second half saw the Comets continue to dominate play but really laying back at the same time as the third and fourth quarter saw just two goals scored. The Roar, for their efforts had chances on the break to score, but each time, Waltman would come up with timely saves that would keep the Roar from closing the game. With under five minutes left in the third quarter, the Comets made it 22-4. Gibson scored his fourth of the game off an assist from Sosa, his third of the game. The fourth quarter was much of the same from the Comets, except they scored an early goal this time. Just over four minutes in, the Byron Alvarez picked out Andre Braithwaite after receiving the ball in the corner. Braithwaite fired the ball home to make it 24-4, which is how the game ended.\n\nThe Comets close out the home portion of the regular season next Saturday against the St. Louis Ambush."
