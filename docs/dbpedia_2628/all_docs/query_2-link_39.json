Vestibular physiotherapy exercises (VE) specifically address vestibular rehabilitation to reduce imbalances and improve physical condition, like therapeutic exercise (TE). During COVID-19, technology was used with the elderly for implementation. Objective: to determine if vestibular exercises are as effective as multicomponent exercises in improving functional capacity using technological tools. Methods: A randomized clinical trial compared two intervention groups of 21 subjects with functional limitations and frailty (average age 76.11 years). The intervention involved multicomponent exercise for the control group (Vivifrail protocol) and vestibular exercises for the experimental group (Cawthorne and Cooksey exercises) for 6 weeks with five sessions per week both groups. Two professionals implemented the exercises, and participants received tailored exercise videos. Primary outcomes were gait speed, dynamic balance, and physical capacity. Results: Both groups showed significant improvements. For physical function measured by SPPB (0–12 points), the multicomponent exercise group improved by 1.97 (0.91; 3.03), p < 0.001, and the vestibular exercise group improved by 1.63 (0.65; 2.60), p = 0.002. For dynamic balance measured by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the multicomponent exercise group improved by −0.88 (−1.33; −0.42), p < 0.001, and the vestibular exercise group improved by −0.79 (−1.21; −0.37), p < 0.001. There were no significant differences between groups. Finally, regarding gait speed, there were no differences in either group between pretest and post-test (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Both multicomponent exercise and vestibular exercises improve functional capacities via telerehabilitation as measured by the SPPB, although vestibular physiotherapy does not show superior outcomes compared to the control group.

While various medications have been tested for alleviating the symptoms associated with double-J stents, consensus on their effectiveness remains elusive. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of tamsulosin, solifenacin, mirabegron, desloratadine, and combination therapy using a Romanian-adapted version of the Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire (USSQ). Materials and Methods: A prospective, observational, randomised trial was conducted at the Urology and Renal Transplant Clinic of Dr. “C.I. Parhon” Clinical Hospital in Iasi between 1 January 2022 and 1 August 2023. Three hundred twenty seven patients who underwent their first double-J stent insertion were evaluated with the Romanian-adapted USSQ at baseline and 30 days post-insertion. Patients were randomly divided into six groups based on the prescribed medications: control, tamsulosin, mirabegron, solifenacin, desloratadine, and combination therapy. Results: The data suggest a significant reduction in symptoms in patients who received medication compared with the control group. Furthermore, the combined medication of solifenacin 10 mg and tamsulosin 0.4 mg was particularly effective in reducing pain with statistical significance compared to the control group (p = 0.001). The highest mean scores for urinary symptom severity were observed in the control group (12.37 ± 6.82), and the lowest was in the mirabegron group (9.94 ± 5.82). The individuals who received a daily dose of 50 mg of mirabegron saw the most notable influence on their job. Conclusions: While no single medication emerged as a “miracle drug” for managing symptoms related to double-J stent insertion, the combination therapy of solifenacin and tamsulosin is the most promising option for improving symptoms related to double-J stent insertion and QoL. Additional extensive research is required to validate these initial results.

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) represents a high-resolution, low-risk, and largely available non-invasive modality for the precise delineation of plaque composition, morphology, and inflammatory activity, further enhancing our ability to stratify high-risk plaque and predict adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring, derived from CCTA, has emerged as a promising tool for predicting future cardiovascular events in asymptomatic individuals, demonstrating incremental prognostic value beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors in terms of myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality. Additionally, CCTA-derived information on adverse plaque characteristics, geometric characteristics, and hemodynamic forces provides valuable insights into plaque vulnerability and seems promising in guiding revascularization strategies. Additionally, non-invasive assessments of epicardial and pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) further refine risk stratification, adding prognostic significance to coronary artery disease (CAD), correlating with plaque development, vulnerability, and rupture. Moreover, CT imaging not only aids in risk stratification but is now emerging as a screening tool able to monitor CAD progression and treatment efficacy over time. Thus, the integration of CAC scoring and PCAT evaluation into risk stratification algorithms, as well as the identification of high-risk plaque morphology and adverse geometric and hemodynamic characteristics, holds promising results for guiding personalized preventive interventions, helping physicians in identifying high-risk individuals earlier, tailoring lifestyle and pharmacological interventions, and improving clinical outcomes in their patients.

Yokuansan (YKS) is a versatile traditional Japanese herbal medicine with a wide range of applications, especially in pain management and neurological manifestations. YKS has analgesic properties for nerve damage and is a potential treatment for DM-induced neuropathic pain, especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Thus, we examined the anti-allodynic effect of YKS on DM-induced neuropathic pain. Methods: All experiments were performed on 6-week-old male Sprague–Dawley rats. DM and diabetic neuropathy were induced in rats with streptozotocin. Mechanical allodynia was assessed using dynamic plantar esthesiometry. Additionally, we conducted an immunological assessment of microglia cell changes in the spinal cord and an experiment to clarify the involvement of serotonin. Results: Diabetes significantly reduced withdrawal thresholds in rats during the initial two weeks of the experiment, which stabilized thereafter. However, this effect was not investigated in the control group. We assessed, using the dynamic plantar test, the anti-allodynic effects of orally administered YKS (1 g/kg). Daily YKS administration significantly increased the withdrawal threshold in DM animals. Additionally, oral YKS reduced the expression of Ibal-1-positive microglia. To elucidate the mechanism of action of YKS, we explored the involvement of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) receptors in mediating its effects. Intrathecal administration of 5-HT receptor antagonists (WAY-100635, ketanserin, and ondansetron) inhibited the protective effects of YKS. Conclusions: YKS exhibited an anti-allodynic effect, suggesting that YKS may activate 5-HT receptors in the spinal cord, thereby alleviating diabetic neuropathic pain.

The leading contributors to cirrhosis among pediatric patients are chronic cholestasis, metabolic disorders present from birth, and long-term hepatitis. Materials and method: Our narrative review aimed to synthesize literature data on the etiology, clinical picture, diagnostic techniques, optimal management of complications, and timely transplantation. Results: The epidemiology of liver cirrhosis in pediatric patients is evolving. The introduction of a universal vaccination and effective long-term viral suppression in viral hepatitis have significantly decreased complications rates. Liver transplantation programs worldwide have also improved the management of cirrhosis complications. Conclusions: Early diagnosis, comprehensive management strategies, and advancements in treatment modalities are critical for improving outcomes. Understanding these differences is crucial in providing age-appropriate care and support for those affected by cirrhosis.

Previously, capnogram analysis was used to detect this pathophysiological process. In other populations, quasi-static pressure–volume curves obtained during constant low-flow inflations are routinely used to detect intrathoracic airway closure. This study reports the first use of quasi-static pressure–volume curves to detect intrathoracic airway closure during prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Methods: Connecting a pressure and flow sensor to the endotracheal tube enabled the performance of low-flow inflations during cardiopulmonary resuscitation using a manual resuscitator. Users connected the device following intubation and performed a low-flow inflation during the next rhythm analysis when chest compressions were interrupted. Determining the lower inflection point on the resulting pressure–volume curves allowed for the detection and quantification of intrathoracic airway closure. Results: The research device was used during the prehospital treatment of ten cardiac arrest patients. A lower inflection point indicating intrathoracic airway closure was detected in all patients. During cardiac arrest, the median pressure at which the lower inflection point occurred was 5.56 cmH20 (IQR 4.80, 8.23 cmH20). This value varied considerably between cases and was lower in patients who achieved return of spontaneous circulation. Conclusions: In this pilot study, quasi-static pressure–volume curves were obtained during prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Intrathoracic airway closure was detected in all patients. Further research is needed to determine whether the use of ventilation strategies to counter intrathoracic airway closure could lead to improved outcomes and if the degree of airway closure could serve as a prognostic factor.

These can result in delays in drug availability for patients, even for those with important unfmet needs for whom it may be necessary and ethical to ensure access. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of ruxolitinib for patients with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) after EMA approval at the University Hospital of Catania. We analysed data about the use of ruxolitinib in patients with GvHD, describing their basic characteristics, their outcomes and the cost of the treatment. In the reference period, 24 ruxolitinib treatments were started according to the Summary of Product Characteristic. The average treatment duration was 10 months. Twenty patients showed a response, maintained over time, with no adverse reactions. The total expenditure amounts to EUR 963,424. The use of ruxolitinib in a real population confirms its role in an important therapeutic need. The quantification of costs requires a reflection on the sustainability of early access to medicines authorised by the EMA for serious diseases and in the absence of therapeutic alternatives.

Photobiomodulation with low-level laser therapy has been demonstrated to be an efficacious treatment for BMS. However, its long-term benefits remain relatively unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of prolonged Photobiomodulation with low-level laser therapy on BMS patients by examining the efficacy of an outpatient protocol in a real-world setting. Methods: A prospective study was designed to address the research question. Photobiomodulation was performed, irradiating the affected areas once every two weeks for 12 months. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire at the initial consultation and after 6 months and 12 months of treatment. Additionally, the patients’ pharmacological profile was also monitored. Nonparametric statistical analysis was performed (p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant). Results: The study was completed by 15 individuals, comprising 14 females and 1 male. The results indicated a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.001) in four of the five dimensions of the health-related quality of life questionnaire, namely self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, along with the patients’ perceived health level. A total of 13 participants reported suspending or reducing their intake of medications for Burning Mouth Syndrome. Conclusions: Therefore, Photobiomodulation with low-level laser therapy has a positive effect on improving patients’ quality of life and reducing BMS symptoms, contributing to a subsequent reduction or suspension of previous medications. These findings support the efficacy of the applied protocol. Given the innovative methodology and promising results, further research is warranted.

The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of patients ≥ 75 years with resectable EC, receiving either upfront esophagectomy or neoadjuvant treatment. Methods: We retrospectively identified 127 patients with resectable EC ≥ 75 years who underwent esophagectomy between January 2000 and December 2022 at our Clinic in the University Hospital of Padova. The included patients were stratified into two groups: patients undergoing upfront esophagectomy (SURG group) and patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment (NAT group). Results: There were no statistically significant differences in OS (p = 0.7708), DFS (p = 0.7827) and cancer-related survival (p = 0.0827) between the SURG and the NAT group, except for the OS of EAC with stage III-IV, where the NAT group experienced a significant benefit in OS (p = 0.0263). When comparing the two groups, patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment experienced a significantly higher rate of postoperative complications (p = 0.0266). At univariate analysis, neoadjuvant therapy was the only variable strongly associated with postoperative morbidity (p = 0.026). Conclusions: Considering the unique characteristics of elderly patients, the choice of a multimodal approach should be tailored to each case in a multidisciplinary setting and balanced with a potential higher risk of postoperative complications, as well as potential toxicity related to chemoradiation and reduced life expectancy.

This study aims to evaluate and compare the effects on pain levels of bupivacaine alone versus bupivacaine combined with dexmedetomidine and bupivacaine combined with dexamethasone in ultrasound-guided TAP block for postoperative pain after CS. Material and Method: In this randomized controlled trial, 120 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II scheduled for elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia were randomly divided into three groups. At the end of the surgery, an ultrasound-guided TAP block was performed on all patients: bupivacaine 0.5% (Group B), bupivacaine 0.5% + dexmedetomidine (1 µg/kg) (Group BD), and bupivacaine 0.5% + dexamethasone (4 mg) (Group BDx). Postoperatively, all patients were evaluated at 0, 1, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h for visual analog scores VASs, tramadol consumption, complications, and patient satisfaction. A p value of < 0.05 is statistically significant. Results: At 0 h, VASs in the sitting and supine positions were significantly higher in the BDx group (0.85 ± 1.61 and 0.85 ± 1.36, respectively) compared to the B group (0.05 ± 0.32 in both positions) and the BD group (0.15 ± 0.48 in both positions) (p = 0.005 and p = 0.001, respectively). At the 24th hour, VASs in the sitting and supine positions were significantly lower in the BDx group (1.7 ± 1.2 and 1.43 ± 1.05) compared to the B group (2.3 ± 0.68 and 2.2 ± 0.72) and the BD group (2.57 ± 1.01 and 2.28 ± 0.78) (p = 0.005 and p = 0.001, respectively). At 0 h, the tramadol requirement was highest in the BDx group at 12.5%, while it was not required in the B and BD groups (p = 0.005). At 0 h, the rate of nausea and vomiting was highest in the BDx group at 17.5%, compared to 2.5% in the BD group and 0% in the B group (p = 0.003). Patient satisfaction scores were higher in the dexamethasone group compared to the other groups. This was significant between Group B and Group BDx (p = 0.009 < 0.05). Conclusions: Adding dexmedetomidine or dexamethasone to bupivacaine in ultrasound-guided TAP blocks reduces postoperative pain and increases patient satisfaction after cesarean sections. Dexamethasone, due to its delayed onset but extended duration, achieves lower pain scores and higher satisfaction. Further research is necessary to confirm these findings.

In redo cases, especially after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery with patent mammary bypass grafts, establishing aortic clamping followed by antegrade cardioplegia application might be challenging. Here, we present the outcome of hypothermic ventricular fibrillation as an alternative to conventional cardioprotection. Methods: Patients who underwent MIMVS either received hypothermic ventricular fibrillation (study group, n = 48) or antegrade cardioprotection (control group, n = 840) and were observed for 30 postoperative days. Data were retrospectively analyzed and collected from January 2011 until December 2022. Results: Patients in the study group had a higher preoperative prevalence of renal insufficiency (p = 0.001), extracardiac arteriopathy (p = 0.001), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (p = 0.001) and chronic lung disease (p = 0.036). Furthermore, they had a longer surgery time and a lower repair rate (p < 0.001). No difference, however, was seen in postoperative incidences of stroke (p = 0.26), myocardial infarction (p = 1) and mitral valve re-operation (p = 1) as well as 30-day mortality (p = 0.1) and postoperative mitral valve insufficiency or stenosis. Conclusions: The patients who underwent redo MIMVS with hypothermic ventricular fibrillation did not have worse outcomes or more serious adverse events compared to the patients who received routine conventional cardioprotection. Therefore, the use of hypothermic ventricular fibrillation appears to be a promising cardioprotective technique in this challenging patient population requiring redo MIMVS.

The prevalence of nephrolithiasis in these patients varies between 0.1% and 6.3%, with a significant impact on graft longevity and function. Surgical access complications due to the renal graft’s position on the iliac vessels and the variety of urinary anastomoses complicate the treatment approaches. This study evaluates the effectiveness and outcomes of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and ureteroscopy (URS), two primary minimally invasive strategies for managing graft stones. Through a narrative review using the PubMed and EMBASE databases, it was found that PCNL offers high stone-free rates especially beneficial for large stones, whereas URS provides a less invasive option with a lower risk of complications for small stones. Both techniques require tailored approaches based on stone composition—mostly calcium oxalate—and specific patient anatomical factors. This review underscores the importance of early diagnosis, appropriate treatment selection, and continuous post-treatment monitoring to mitigate risks and promote long-term renal function in transplant recipients.

However, there is a lack of mechanistic studies in healthy subjects assessing the effects of bilateral transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) on HRV. Our study aims to investigate how taVNS can influence the HRV response, including the influence of demographic variables in this response. Methods: Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled study with 44 subjects, 22 allocated to active and 22 to sham taVNS. Results: Our results showed a significant difference between groups in the high-frequency (HF) metric. Active taVNS increased the HF metric significantly as compared to sham taVNS. Also, we found that age was a significant effect modifier of the relationship between taVNS and HF-HRV, as a larger increase in HF-HRV was seen in the older subjects. Importantly, there was a decrease in HF-HRV in the sham group. Conclusions: These findings suggest that younger subjects can adapt and maintain a constant level of HF-HRV regardless of the type of stimulation, but in the older subjects, only the active taVNS recipients were able to maintain and increase their HF-HRV. These results are important because they indicate that taVNS can enhance physiological regulation processes in response to external events.

The aim of this present study was to analyze the effect of successful kidney transplantations on the plasma FGF21 concentration and to study the factors which may influence plasma FGF21 concentration in patients in long time after kidney transplantation. Methods: This study consisted of two independent parts. The first part was a prospective observation of CKD patients in stage 5 before and then on the 14th and 30th day and 6 months after kidney transplantation. The second part of this study was the cross-sectional study completed in patients at least one year after kidney transplantation and the control group. In CKD patients directly before and during the early period after KTx, plasma FGF21 concentrations were measured four times (immediately before and 14 and 30 days and 6 months after KTx). In patients long time after kidney transplantation and in healthy subjects, plasma FGF21 concentration was measured once. Results: Forty patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who were either directly before or within the early period after kidney transplantation (KTx), 184 patients longtime after KTx and 50 healthy subjects were enrolled into this study. In CKD patients at the stage directly before receiving a KTx, the mean plasma FGF21 concentration was significantly higher than in the healthy subjects [1013.0 pg/mL versus 239.5 pg/mL, p < 0.001]. At 14, 30 days, and 6 months after the KTx, a significant decrease of plasma FGF21 was observed, with values of 322.5 pg/mL; 355.0 pg/mL; and 344.0 pg/mL (p < 0.001), respectively]. In patients long time after KTx, a negative correlation was found between the plasma FGF21 concentration and the estimated glomerular filtration rate and a positive correlation was found between the plasma FGF21 concentration and the BMI, the serum concentration of triglycerides, insulin, interleukin-6, CRP, and cystatin C. Conclusions: The plasma FGF21 concentration in patients with end-stage renal disease is higher than in healthy subjects and significantly decreases after a successful KTx. The plasma FGF21 concentration measured by ELISA in patients long time after kidney transplantation seems to be related to the degree of kidney function impairment and their metabolic status. The kidneys appear to be one of the main organs involved in the biodegradation and/or elimination of FGF21.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), an enzyme involved in immune response modulation, has been suggested to play a role in transplant immunological injury. The aim of the study was to explore the expression of IDO1 in the interstitial foci of transplanted kidneys and its potential association with rejection episodes. (2) Methods: This retrospective study analysed kidney transplant biopsies from 121 patients, focusing on IDO1 expression in interstitial foci. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect IDO1, and patients were categorised based on IDO1 presence (IDO1-IF positive or negative). The incidence of rejection was compared between these groups. (3) Results: Patients with IDO1 expression in interstitial foci (IDO1-IF(+)) exhibited higher incidences of rejection 46/80 (57.5%) vs. 10/41 (24.34%) patients compared to IDO1-IF(−) patients, which was statistically significant with p = 0.0005. The analysis of antibody-mediated rejection showed that IDO1-IF(+) patients developed AMR at 12/80 (15%), while only 1 IDO1-IF(−) negative patient did (2,44%), with p = 0.035. T-cell-mediated rejection was also more common in IDO1-IF(+) patients 43/80 (53.75%) than in IDO1-IF(−) patients 7/41 (17.07%), with p = 0.0001. (4) Conclusions: IDO1 expression in interstitial foci of renal transplant biopsies is associated with a higher incidence of rejection, suggesting that IDO1 could serve as a potential biomarker for transplant rejection. These findings highlight the importance of IDO1 in immune regulation and its potential utility in improving the management of kidney transplant recipients.

The systemic inflammatory profile of alopecia areata (AA) regarding IFNγ and Th1 cytokine dysregulation has previously been described, suggesting an increased incidence of CVDs in this population. No previous studies investigated the possible relationship between atherosclerosis and AA by cardiovascular imaging techniques. To determine the prevalence, distribution and burden of subclinical atherosclerosis in AA. Methods: We conducted a case–control study in 62 participants, including 31 patients with severe AA (SALT > 75) and 31 healthy controls, matched for age, sex and body mass index (BMI). The participants underwent a detailed history assessment and were subjected to the measurement of weight, height, abdominal circumference and blood pressure. A fasting blood sample was also collected. Subclinical atherosclerosis was evaluated by ultrasonography of the bilateral femoral and carotid arteries. Results: The AA patients had an increased prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis (54.7%) compared to the healthy controls (22.6%, p = 0.010). The prevalence of atheroma plaques was significantly higher in the carotid arteries (41.90% vs. 12.9%, p = 0.009), while no significant differences were found in femoral plaque prevalence. The AA patients with atherosclerotic plaques were older (p < 0.001) and had a longer time since AA diagnosis (p = 0.11) and increased serum levels of glycated hemoglobin (p = 0.029) and triglycerides (p = 0.009). In a regression analysis, duration of disease and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were the main predictors of atherosclerosis. Conclusions: AA patients have an increased prevalence of carotid subclinical atherosclerosis. The duration of AA, systemic inflammation and insulin resistance appear to play a role in the development of subclinical atherosclerosis in this population.

Several studies have shown that atherosclerosis in the carotid, coronary, and breast arteries is associated with an increased risk of stroke, CI, and dementia. In this review, we examine the association of subclinical atherosclerotic calcification detected by computed tomography (CT) in these arterial beds and the risk of stroke, CI, and dementia. A major advantage of CT is that it can accurately quantify vascular calcification in different parts of the vasculature during a single examination. However, the strength of the association between CT findings and CI and stroke varies with the location and severity of the arteries involved. Data are still limited on this topic, highlighting the need for additional investigations to further our understanding of the risk of cognitive impairment in patients with subclinical atherosclerosis. It is equally important to test preventive strategies for managing patients in whom vascular calcifications are identified incidentally in randomized controlled trials to study the effects on outcomes, including incidents of stroke and CI.

The presence of AKI increases in-hospital complications in these patients. Methods: The 2016–2020 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database consisting of adult admissions with IE and AKI was utilized. The primary outcome was all-cause inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes included fluid and electrolyte disorders, stroke, septic arterial embolism, septic shock, cardiogenic shock, valve surgery, vasopressor support, mechanical ventilation, length of stay (LOS), and total hospital charges. Results: Out of a total of 63,725 adult admissions with IE, 16,295 (25.5%) admissions had AKI. Patients with AKI were more likely to be males (63% vs. 57.6%, p < 0.001) and older (55.8 vs. 50.4, p < 0.001). A higher proportion of these patients were admitted to large hospitals (60.6 vs. 55.3%, p < 0.001) and urban teaching hospitals (81.9 vs. 75%, p < 0.001). Patients with AKI had higher LOS (17 ± 16.1 vs. 11.32 ± 11.7, p < 0.001) and hospital charges (USD 239,046.8 ± 303,977.3 vs. USD 124,857.6 ± 192,883.5, p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed higher odds of all-cause inpatient mortality (aOR: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.81–2.73, p < 0.001). They also had higher risk for fluid and electrolyte disorder (aOR: 2.31, 95% CI: 2.10–2.53, p < 0.001), septic arterial embolism (aOR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.42–1.84, p < 0.001), septic shock (aOR: 3.78, 95% CI: 2.97–4.82, p < 0.001), cardiogenic shock (OR: 3.37, 95% CI: 2.65–4.28, p < 0.001), valve surgery (aOR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.35–1.71, p < 0.001), vasopressor requirement (aOR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.52–2.60, p < 0.001), and mechanical ventilation (aOR: 2.75, 95% CI: 2.33–3.24, p < 0.001). The association with stroke was elevated but not statistically significant. Conclusions: This large retrospective analysis demonstrated that patients with AKI and infective endocarditis had increased mortality, adverse hospital outcomes, increased LOS, and hospital costs.

High tibial osteotomy is commonly practiced but has high recurrence rates. This study analyzed factors affecting treatment failure and recurrence in children undergoing opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO) for ITV. Methods: We retrospectively studied children with ITV who had OWHTO with a press-fit cancellous bone allograft between 2000 and 2020, with ≥2-year follow-up. Outcomes included recurrence (knee varus with tibiofemoral angle > 10°), complications, and reintervention. Results: We analyzed 39 knees in 29 patients (mean age: 4.8 ± 1.9 years; median follow-up: 7.4 years). Recurrence occurred in 22 cases (56%). Age at surgery significantly influenced recurrence, with rates of 16% before age 5 versus 95% later (hazard ratio: 12.0, p = 0.001). Langenskiöld stage also affected recurrence (β-coefficient: 2.7, 95% C.I. 1.0–4.5, p = 0.002; pseudo-R-squared: 0.50, p = 0.001), with recurrence in all stage IV or higher cases. Conclusions: Early diagnosis and treatment before age 5, ideally with Langenskiöld stage III or lower, are crucial for stable correction with OWHTO alone. Late, high-grade ITV may require combined, acute or gradual, and/or staged correction. Further evidence is needed for optimal management.

Many prehospital and perioperative haemorrhage control strategies and techniques have been available to clinicians for multiple decades, yet our understanding and utilisation of these practices continues to be refined and optimised. There is a particular focus in this article on issues related to resuscitation and coagulation in trauma. We examine the complex mechanisms that lead to coagulopathy in trauma patients as well as the transformative effect tranexamic acid has had in limiting blood loss. We also explore some emerging technologies such as endovascular interventions and clot-stabilising dressings and devices that are likely to have a significant impact going forward.

Methods: This systematic review was conducted by analyzing studies published from 2003 to 2023. The following keyword combination was utilized: prevalence, epidemiology, population, and bruxism. The PubMed database was analyzed, supplemented by manual searches using the Google search. Additionally, the snowballing procedure method was applied. A double assessment of the quality of publications was carried out to preserve the highest possible quality of evidence (e.g., Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist). Analyses were conducted using the R statistical language. Results: The global bruxism (sleep and awake) prevalence is 22.22%. The global sleep bruxism prevalence is 21% and awake prevalence is 23%. The occurrence of sleep bruxism, based on polysomnography, was estimated at 43%. The highest prevalence of sleep bruxism was observed in North America at 31%, followed by South America at 23%, Europe at 21%, and Asia at 19%. The prevalence of awake bruxism was highest in South America at 30%, followed by Asia at 25% and Europe at 18%. Conclusions: One in four individuals may experience awake bruxism. Bruxism is a significant factor among women. It was observed that age is a significant factor for the occurrence of sleep bruxism in women. Among the limitations of the study is the lack of analysis of the prevalence of bruxism in Africa and Australia due to not collecting an adequate sample for analysis. The study was registered in the Open Science Framework (10.17605/OSF.IO/ZE786).

Metabolic dysregulation, gastrointestinal microbiome alterations, and systemic inflammation are emerging as significant contributors to AIS pathogenesis. This review addresses the critical need to understand how these factors interact to influence AIS risk and outcomes. We aim to elucidate the roles of dysregulated adipokines in obesity, the impact of gut microbiota disruptions, and the neuroinflammatory cascade initiated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in AIS. Dysregulated adipokines in obesity exacerbate inflammatory responses, increasing AIS risk and severity. Disruptions in the gut microbiota and subsequent LPS-induced neuroinflammation further link systemic inflammation to AIS. Advances in neuroimaging and biomarker development have improved diagnostic precision. Here, we highlight the need for a multifaceted approach to AIS management, integrating metabolic, microbiota, and inflammatory insights. Potential therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways could significantly improve AIS prevention and treatment. Future research should focus on further elucidating these pathways and developing targeted interventions to mitigate the impacts of metabolic dysregulation, microbiome imbalances, and inflammation on AIS.

Although photodynamic therapy (PDT) is effective against CSC, the details of the mechanism are unknown. To verify the effect of PDT, we compared the time of choroidal circulation before and after PDT in CSC patients, using ICGA. Methods: Seven eyes of seven patients (six male, one female) who were diagnosed with chronic CSC associated with serous retinal detachment (SRD) in the macular area and who underwent half-dose PDT were included. Wide-field ICGA images with an angle of 102° were taken and evaluated at the superior and inferior temporal quadrants. Choroidal circulation time (CCT) was defined as the time from the start of contrast filling in the choroidal artery to the first appearance of contrast filling in the temporal vortex vein ampulla. Results: The average CCT before and after PDT in the superior temporal vortex vein was 3.96 s and 5.41 s (p = 0.018), and 4.12 s and 5.02 s (p = 0.046) in the inferior temporal vortex vein, respectively. All SRD and choroidal vascular hyperpermeability areas dissolved after PDT. Conclusions: In this pilot study, half-dose PDT prolonged CCT in CSC patients, indicating the effect of selective vascular obstruction in the choriocapillaris.

However, an individual’s susceptibility or the inadequate removal of subgingival biofilms could lead to unfavorable responses to NSPT. This study aimed to assess the potential of salivary and microbiological biomarkers in predicting the site-specific and whole-mouth outcomes of NSPT. Methods: A total of 68 periodontitis patients exhibiting 1111 periodontal pockets 4 to 6 mm in depth completed the active phase of periodontal treatment. Clinical periodontal parameters, saliva, and subgingival biofilm samples were collected from each patient at baseline and three months after NSPT. A quantitative PCR assay was used to detect the presence of Fusobaterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis in the biofilm samples. Salivary biomarkers including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and Annexin-1 were assayed both qualitatively (Western blot analysis) and quantitively (ELISA). Results: NSPT yielded significant improvements in all clinical parameters, including a reduction in bacterial load and decreased levels of MMP-9 together with increased concentrations of GST and Annexin-1. The binary logistic regression suggested that the overall accuracy of P. gingivalis identification, probing pocket depth, and interproximal sites was 71.1% in predicting successful site-specific outcomes. The salivary biomarker model yielded an overall accuracy of 79.4% in predicting whole-mouth outcomes following NSPT. Conclusions: At baseline, the presence of shallow periodontal pockets at interdental locations with a lower abundance of P. gingivalis is predictive of a favorable response to NSPT at the site level. Decreased salivary MMP-9 associated with increased GST and Annexin-1 levels can predict successful whole-mouth outcomes following NSPT.

Patients with vEDS present with severe tissue fragility that can result in arterial aneurysm, dissection, or rupture, especially of medium-caliber vessels. Although early reports have indicated a very high mortality rate in affected patients, with an estimated median survival of around 50 years, recent times have seen a remarkable improvement in outcomes in this population. This shift could be related to greater awareness of the disease among patients and physicians, with improved management both in terms of follow-up and treatment of complications. Increasing use of drugs acting on the cardiovascular system may also have contributed to this improvement. In particular, celiprolol, a β1 cardio-selective blocker with a β2-agonist vasodilator effect, has been shown to reduce rates of vascular events in patients with vEDS. However, the evidence on the true benefits and possible mechanisms responsible for the protective effect of celiprolol in this specific setting remains limited. Drugs targeting the extracellular matrix organization and autophagy–lysosome pathways are currently under investigation and could play a role in the future. This narrative review aims to summarize current evidence and future perspectives on vEDS medical treatment, with a specific focus on vascular prevention.

Many ABI patients exhibit oculomotor dysfunctions that impact their daily life and rehabilitation outcomes. Current clinical tools for oculomotor function (OMF) assessment are limited in their usability. In this proof-of-principle study, we aimed to develop an efficient tool for OMF screening and to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and relevance in a small sample of ABI and control participants. Methods: We created the Rehabilitation Oculomotor Screening Evaluation (ROSE) by reviewing existing OMF assessments. ROSE was pilot-tested on ABI patients (n = 10) and age-matched controls (n = 10). Data regarding the characteristics of the assessment, such as the duration, level of participant comprehension, and participant experience were also collected. Results: ROSE takes <20 min (x¯ = 12.5), is easy to complete (agreement x¯ = 4.6/5), and is well-accepted (x¯ = 4.8/5). Patients scored higher in all subtests and total score (x¯ = 34.8 for ABI vs. 8.9 for controls). Most subtests did not provoke any symptoms, especially for controls. There were no significant between-group differences in symptom provocation. This proof-of-principle study shows that ROSE is feasible, acceptable, and relevant for adult ABI patients. Conclusions: ROSE needs further evaluation for reliability testing and validation in larger samples and diverse neurological conditions. Establishing norms for various ages, sexes, and populations should be considered for the deployment of ROSE as an OMF clinical tool.

Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study that included secondary data from computerized health records of seven Spanish Autonomous Communities. Patients with a first major bleeding during treatment with a direct FXai were analyzed during a 3-year period. Results: Of 8972 patients taking a direct FXai, 470 (5.24%) had major bleeding (mean age (SD) 77.93 (9.71) years, 61.06% women). The most frequent indications for using FXais were atrial fibrillation (78.09%) and venous thromboembolism (17.66%). Among those with major bleeding, 88.94% presented with gastrointestinal bleeding, 6.81% intracranial bleeding, 2.13% trauma-related bleeding and 4.26% other major bleeding. Prothrombin complex concentrates were used in 63.19%, followed by transfusion of blood products (20.21%) and Factor VIIa (7.66%). In total, 4.26% of patients died in the hospital due to the first major bleeding. At the study end (after 3-year follow-up), 28.94% of the patients had died, 12.34% had a myocardial infarction and 9.15% an ischemic stroke. At year 3, overall bleeding cost was EUR 5,816,930.5, of which 79.74% accounted for in-hospital costs to treat the bleeding episode. Conclusions: Despite the use of replacement agents being high, major events were common, with a 29% mortality at the end of the follow up, and HCRU and costs were high, evidencing the need for new reversal treatment strategies.

This condition is associated with polycythemia, motor neurodegeneration with extrapyramidal features, and hepatic dysfunction, which can progress to cirrhosis in some patients. Materials and Methods: In this study, a consanguineous Saudi family with two affected individuals exhibiting symptoms of severe motor impairment, spastic paraparesis, postural instability, and dystonia was studied. Clinical and radiographic evaluations were conducted on the affected individuals. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed to diagnose the disease and to determine the causative variant underlying the phenotype. Moreover, Sanger sequencing was used for validation and segregation analysis of the identified variant. Bioinformatics tools were utilized to predict the pathogenicity of candidate variants based on ACMG criteria. Results: Exome sequencing detected a recurrent homozygous missense variant (c.266T>C; p.L89P) in exon 1 of the SLC30A10 gene. Sanger sequencing was employed to validate the segregation of the discovered variant in all available family members. Bioinformatics tools predicted that the variant is potentially pathogenic. Moreover, conservation analysis showed that the variant is highly conserved in vertebrates. Conclusions: This study shows that exome sequencing is instrumental in diagnosing undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, this study expands the mutation spectrum of SLC30A10 in distinct populations.

Recent clinical observations have underscored phenylalanine (PHE) as a prognostic marker in HF, although the mechanisms involving inter-organ crosstalk remain understood. Methods: This study adopted a dull approach, with a retrospective analysis of 550 HF patients to establish the prognostic value of pre-discharge PHE levels and a study on the inter-organ crosstalk of PHE among 24 patients. We analyzed the correlations between PHE concentrations and clinical outcomes, alongside a comprehensive examination of PHE metabolism across the skeletal muscle, liver, heart, kidney, and lung. Results: In the clinical prognostic analysis of 550 patients hospitalized for acute decompensated HF, elevated PHE levels (≥65.6 μM) were significantly and independently associated with increased all-cause mortality during a median follow-up of 4.5 years (log rank = 36.7, p < 0.001), underscoring its value as a prognostic marker in HF. The inter-organic crosstalk study elucidated the mechanism associated with PHE elevation in patients with HF, characterized by an increase in PHE output in skeletal muscle and a decrease in hepatic and cardiac PHE uptakes. Notably, PHE concentration gradients across these organs were correlated with HF severity, such as the NYHA functional class, B-type natriuretic peptide levels, and the presence of acute HF. Conclusions: Our findings confirm the prognostic significance of PHE in patients with HF and unveil the complex metabolic interplay among key organs that contribute to PHE dysregulation. These insights not only reinforce the importance of metabolic monitoring in HF management but also open avenues for therapeutic targets.
