BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- Veteran forward Claudio Bieler struck two late goals as 10-man San Martin Tucuman ended Racing Club's unbeaten run with a 2-1 victory in the Superliga Argentina on Sunday

The hosts were reduced to 10 men in the 17th minute when goalkeeper Ignacio Arce was shown a straight red card for handling the ball outside the penalty area.

Despite their numerical disadvantage the hosts continued to look dangerous and Augusto Solari put them ahead just after halftime by heading in after a Ricardo Centurian cross.

But San Martin Tucuman refused to surrender and 34-year-old Bieler equalized with a 71st-minute header. He then gave his side the lead by rifling home from 12 yards after Matias Garcia's pass.

The result ended Racing's unbeaten start to the season but they still have a two-point lead over second-placed Union with 20 points from nine matches.

San Martin Tucuman are 21st in the 26-team standings with seven points.

In other matches on Sunday, Atletico Tucuman drew 1-1 at Estudiantes, Union Santa Fe won 1-0 at Argentinos Juniors and Independiente secured a 3-1 home victory over Huracan.
