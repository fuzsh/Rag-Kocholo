        "text": "Often described as an open-air museum and a living piece of history, Valletta’s streets and sights will have you wandering around to marvel at all its beauty. The Baroque architecture adorns all corners of the small city, and there are plenty of historical buildings to admire.\n\nThough the city was built on a peninsula of only 1km by 600m, Europe’s southernmost capital is abundant in historical sights. UNESCO described Valletta as “one of the most concentrated historic areas in the world” when it named Valletta a World Heritage Site. You will find some of Europe’s finest artworks, churches and palaces in Valletta.\n\nFounded in 1565 by the Knights of St. John, it was stated that Valletta would be “a city built by gentlemen for gentlemen”, and it remains true to its 16th-century class. The fortified city walls overlook the Mediterranean Sea and provide a perfect setting for a relaxing yet intriguing holiday. Imagine yourself strolling around the small, picturesque side streets while grabbing a local snack and a coffee in one of Valletta’s many quaint cafés.\n\nMalta has been colonised throughout the ages and now stands proudly independent since 1964. Today, Valletta is the administrative and commercial heart of the islands, and locals and tourists alike flock to the city for its culture and vivacity. The city is dotted with little shops and cafés, and there is more than enough to explore – you definitely won’t get bored.\n\nAfter investments made in recent years, Valletta has transformed into an even safer and more popular place. Valletta was the European Capital of Culture in 2018, together with its Dutch sister city Leeuwarden. Cultural events were held all throughout the year, and the capital greatly benefited from the extra investments and visitors it gained.\n\nWhen arriving to Malta International Airport in Luqa, Valletta is just 10 kilometres away. There are several ways of transport to get to Valletta.\n\nGrab a taxi\n\nGetting from Malta Airport to Valletta by taxi will take around 15 minutes. You can buy a prepaid ticket at a fixed rate from a booth in the airport’s Arrivals Hall. The fixed fare is €15. You may also want to consider booking a taxi in advance online, using a service such as any.cab. This will ensure you of a hassle-free trip.\n\nHop on a bus\n\nTaking a bus from Malta Airport to Valletta takes about half an hour. You can hop on the X4 express bus, which goes every thirty minutes. Simply sit back till you are at the final stop (Valletta 18) and hop off just outside City Gate. Bus tickets are €2 in summer or €1,50 in winter. Make sure you have small cash with you!\n\nRent a car\n\nIf you are comfortable driving, you can rent a car at the airport and make your way to Valletta yourself. The drive will take around 15 minutes, and is easy to navigate. Prices for rental cars start from €7 per day, depending on the car and the season. Keep in mind that cars are right-hand drive, and you drive on the right side of the road.\n\nHowever, do keep in mind that there is little parking space inside the city, and driving in Valletta is like navigating a maze because of all the one-way streets. Both public and private parking is available right outside the city, which is within walking distance. Taking into account the traffic, busy streets and manic drivers, it might be easier to use the public transport rather than renting a car in Valletta.\n\nUse the airport shuttle service\n\nA cheaper alternative to taxis, the airport offers a shared shuttle service. This service can drop you off and pick you up from your accommodation. A one-way trip from Malta Airport to Valletta for two adults plus luggage costs €10.\n\nValletta is one of Europe’s smallest capital cities, and you can comfortably get around on foot. Unlike many European cities that are a fusion of small villages, the city’s layout is a convenient grid system, making it easy to navigate. The city is quite hilly, and even though there are steps in steep streets, you might want to consider other modes of transport to get around.\n\nIf you do not feel like strolling through the streets, you can take an electric minicab to get around. These minicabs can carry up to three people and cannot cost more than €5 per trip. Hail one in the street or at electric minicab stands.\n\nValletta does not lend itself to getting around by car. With limited parking space and both residents as well as businesspeople driving around, driving in the city can get frustrating quickly. Many visitors that drive to Valletta use the Park and Ride in Floriana and catch a bus to the city centre.\n\nThe streets of Valletta although tidily laid out do feature steep hills. This, together with the lack of cycle lanes, doesn’t make the city ideal to cycle in. While you can rent bikes near the City Gate, keep in mind that traffic can get hectic and that it is inevitable to go up- and downhill quite a bit.\n\nAnother option is to grab an electric scooter in the city. Download the Bolt app (Android | Apple) to use the electric scooters or get a cab out of the city. Renting an electric scooter is easy: find one on the map in the app, scan the QR and you’re ready to go. This is a cheap and convenient way of getting around town.\n\nGetting to other places in Malta\n\nMalta’s transport system is small but covers all corners of the islands. If you don’t mind spending some time on a bus to get to your destination, that’s the most economical way of getting around the islands. If you prefer to quickly get where you want to be, taxis are the best option for you. There are also ferries operating from Valletta to bring you to popular, nearby destinations.\n\nPublic buses\n\nThe main bus station hub is in Valletta, right outside the City Gate. Walk past the Triton fountain to find the bus stops at your left-hand side or follow the road downwards from Castille to end up at the bus stations. There are bus stops starting from Valletta A1 to Valletta C6, so you can catch a bus to any corner of the island.\n\nTIP: Use Google Maps to find out the best route for you to take to your destination. The app will show you the route and the details of the bus you need.\n\nTaxis\n\nIf you prefer taking a slightly more costly but faster alternative, taxis are the way to go. You can hail a white taxi at any place except for bus stops. These taxis operate at a fixed price.\n\nIf you are comfortable using apps to get a taxi, this is usually the cheaper option. We recommend using Bolt (Apple | Android) or eCabs (Apple | Android). If you are travelling alone, a cheap option is ride-sharing taxi app Cool (Apple | Android).\n\nFerries\n\nIf you want to visit Sliema or the Three Cities, your best option is to take a ferry from Valletta.\n\nFerry from Valletta to Sliema\n\nTo head from Valletta to Sliema by ferry, make your way to Marsamxett Harbour. Here you will find the Sliema ferry. Hop on board for €1.50 or €2.80 for a round trip. This will take you to the Sliema Ferry stop, right in the city. The trip takes less than ten minutes, so make the most of it by staying on the sunny top deck and admiring the views of the harbour.\n\nFerry from Valletta to the Three Cities\n\nViews of the Three Cities can be admired from Valletta’s Upper Barrakka Gardens, but you can also easily make your way there by ferry. To reach the Three Cities, take the Upper Barraka Lift down to the Grand Harbour and cross the road to the ferry. If you take the ferry, the lift is free on the way back up, too. Adult tickets are €1.50 or €2.80 for a round trip. Enjoy views of the Grand Harbour from the top-deck of the ferry!\n\nBesides museums and architecture, Valletta has a lot more to offer. Are you looking for exciting activities? Here are some good ideas to get you started.\n\nWalking tours\n\nValletta is a world heritage site and given the number of attractions and significant historical sites, it is easy to miss some of the best ones. A walking tour will take you to all the best sites in Valletta. As you stroll through the Upper and Lower Barrakka gardens, your local guide will provide you with historical context to what you are seeing.\n\nGrand Harbour Boat Tour\n\nThis Captain Morgan cruise is a half-day excursion, taking you around the Grand Harbour, where you’ll find majestic sea views of the island’s fortifications. The tour also includes the showing of “The Malta Experience”, a film presenting Malta’s 7000-year history, with a special focus on the Grand Harbour area. The tour is €25 for adults and €17 for children.\n\nSegway Tours of Valletta\n\nIf walking around the city is not for you, consider seeing it by Segway. Small groups are shown around the city by a guide with the whole group travelling on these two-wheel machines. Saves a lot of time and indeed energy!\n\nA night at the Opera or Theatre, or Embrace the Contemporary\n\nValletta’s commitment to the arts has become legendary. If you love watching actors and performers tread the boards, you have three excellent options to indulge your passions:\n\nManoel Theatre\n\nThe Manoel Theatre, known by locals as ‘The Manoel’, is Malta’s much-loved national theatre. Rebuilt and refurbished following the Second World War, the theatre underwent a rebirth in 1960. It has been educating, informing, and entertaining audiences of all ages ever since. The splendour of the building will take your breath away.\n\nPjazza Teatru Rjal – The Royal Opera House\n\nThe original Royal Opera House was carpet-bombed during the Second World War and remained totally destroyed. In the early 2000s, with the rehoming and building of Malta’s parliament building, it was decided that a new Pjazza Teatru Rjal would be constructed. In 2013, Malta once again had an Opera House.\n\nPay a visit to the Pjazza Teatru Rjal to experience diverse events and workshops, as well as world-class performances of classic operas.\n\nSpazju Kreattiv\n\nSpazju Kreattiv is a very vivid creative arts hub. Valletta-based, Spazju Kreattiv features a cinema, exhibition spaces and a theatre. The project has been established since 2000 and hosts an artist in residence programme. Most of the work is contemporary in nature and any visit is culturally enriching.\n\nFood Tasting Tours\n\nOne way to get to know a country is through its food. A food tasting tour will take you to the best places to sample Maltese cuisine. This includes savouries and sweet food paired with local beer and wine.\n\nOn any visit to Valletta, consider visiting these must-see places of interest. They are all fascinating and provide historical context to Valletta’s place in the world.\n\nSt. Johns Co-Cathedral\n\nBuilt between 1573 and 1577, St Johns Co-Cathedral is adorned with a lush Baroque interior. The cathedral is dedicated to John the Baptist. The interior is truly inspiring and every single inch is beautifully decorated. Even the floor is comprised of tombs of dead knights.\n\nGrandmaster’s Palace\n\nThe Grandmaster’s Palace was one of the first buildings to be built in Valletta, as it was built between the 16th and 18th century. It was originally the palace of the Grandmaster of the Order of St. John. Today it houses the office of the president of Malta, and the palace and its courtyard are open for visitors.\n\nUpper and Lower Barrakka Gardens\n\nIf you’ve been strolling around the city and need a peaceful break, pop by the Upper and Lower Barrakka Gardens. Located in the city centre, these serene gardens are the perfect spots to catch some shadow, sit back and relax. Located just 15 minutes away, you can easily visit both gardens on foot.\n\nTIP: When you’ve made your way to the Upper Barrakka Gardens and are not afraid of heights, take the 58-meter Upper Barrakka Lift down to the Grand Harbour. The way down is free, and you will arrive close to the ferry to the next must-see: The Three Cities.\n\nThe Three Cities\n\nJust across the water from Valletta’s Grand Harbour are the so-called Three Cities: Vittoriosa, Senglea and Cospicua. The Three Cities have been significant in the development and history of Malta, providing both a defence and a source of income for the Maltese people.\n\nToday they are largely unspoiled and one of the best places to experience local Maltese life.\n\nThe Saluting Battery\n\nHead towards the Grand Harbour and you will find the oldest operational saluting battery in the world. From here, you can see spectacular views of the harbour and surrounding towns. Tours include a close look at the guns – entirely authentic weapons from yesteryear.\n\nTop 5 Museums in Valletta\n\nThe Lascaris War Rooms\n\nMalta has always been in a strategic location from both a trading and military perspective. During the Second World War, the Lascaris War Rooms were constructed underground. That’s where the defence of the island and key battles were coordinated during the conflict.\n\nNow, the war rooms are a museum operated by volunteers. The guides are knowledgeable and the reconstruction of the rooms brings history alive.\n\nThe National Museum of Archaeology\n\nHead towards Republic Street and you will soon find the National Museum of Archaeology. It is housed in a magnificent building featuring Baroque architecture. Once inside, the stunning exhibits that date back to the Neolithic period will have you gazing in wonder and get you thinking about how people lived in days gone by.\n\nCultural treasures include:\n\nThe ‘Sleeping Lady’ (Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum)\n\nThe ‘Venus of Malta’ (Ħaġar Qim)\n\nBronze Age daggers – these were found at Tarxien Temples\n\nThe Horus and Anubis pendants (Phoenician period)\n\nThe anthropomorphic sarcophagus (Phoenician period)\n\nThe museum is a great introduction to the prehistory of Malta and provides insights into the cultures of these long dead civilisations.\n\nGreat Siege of Malta & the Knights of St. John\n\nThis exhibition depicts the events that became known as the Great Siege of Malta. Told through the eyewitness accounts of poet Francesco Balbi in a series of period dioramas, combined with digital telling of the siege in graphic depictions, the story of both Malta’s greatest victory and the history of the knights is brought to life.\n\nThe siege is significant to both Malta and the world and is the story of how 700 Knights of St. John and 8000 regular troops repelled a 40,000-strong Turkish invasion fleet. Paying a visit is like a pilgrimage into Malta’s roots, and it is definitely worth your while.\n\nMUŻA – The Malta National Community Art Museum\n\nMUŻA is a unique project which was created in 2018 as part of Valletta becoming the European Capital City of Culture in 2018.\n\nThe exhibits are from the local community and feature works from local groups. Ideas are often shared and debated at the museum, which makes for interesting and engaging discussions. The museum is powered by renewable energy sources and provides a local flavour of Valletta people’s thinking.\n\nIt is housed in the World Heritage Site of Auberge d’Italie on Merchants Street.\n\nFort St Elmo – National War Museum\n\nMalta has some amazing war museums and this one can stand proud among them. Although many of the displays are focused on the two world wars, there are weapons on display here that represent the history of Malta and in some ways tell the story of the island as it passed from one empire to another.\n\nSome of the gems of the museum are ‘Husky’, Roosevelt’s Jeep, the Maltese medal for gallantry, The George Cross and a Gloster Sea Gladiator N5520 FAITH.\n\nTo find the museum simply head towards St Elmo in Valletta’s historic district.\n\nJust a few years ago, Valletta used to go quiet after workers and shopkeepers left town at night. Today, nights in Valletta are enchanting as never before. Pubs and cafés welcome locals and visitors alike, and wine bars are dotted around the city. Whether you’re up for a classy night out or looking for a casual draft beer, you’ll feel right at home in Valletta’s many bars and pubs.\n\nWhat was once a red-light district with sailors’ bars is now the street to be in the after-hours. Strait Street, or Strada Stretta, is a small street filled with some of Valletta’s bars. While some bars still honour the street’s history, today Straight Street is a popular place to have a drink – whether you like it classy or casual.\n\nOther bars and restaurants can be found at Valletta Waterfront, where you can savour a meal while watching cruise ships and yachts making their way through the Grand Harbour. You can take a 15-minute walk from the Triton Fountain to the Valletta Waterfront, or take the lift down from the Upper Barrakka Gardens.\n\nThe main nightlife hub is Paceville, where you will find an array of places – from Latin bars to techno clubs and from karaoke cafés to Irish pubs. If you are looking to dance to the latest hits until the late hours, Havana and Footloose are your best bet.\n\nTop 5 Bars and Pubs in Valletta\n\nBridge Bar\n\nArguably the most popular bar in Valletta, and for a good reason. On any weeknight this may seem like a normal place, but on Friday nights you can enjoy live jazz on the bridge with spectacular views of Grand Harbour. Enjoy Bridge Bar at its best on warm summer nights.\n\nTrabuxu Wine Bar\n\nTrabuxu, “corkscrew” in Maltese, is a gem of a wine bar nestled in a 400-year-old cellar. They offer a large selection of local and foreign wines to be complemented with one of their cheese platters or charcuteries. Trabuxu is a great place to spend a cosy winter night inside.\n\nTico Tico\n\nLocated in Strait Street, Valletta’s former red-light district, Tico Tico is a hotspot known for its cocktails, wine and great atmosphere. Its retro interior and cosy couches make it homely, and it is the perfect place to go after dinner.\n\nYard 32\n\nAnother gem in Strait Street is the gin and tapas bar Yard 32. The first gin-bar in Malta has a selection of 200 gins and 42 tonic waters, so if you G&Ts are your go-to drink, this is your place to be. Enjoy some Spanish tapas on the side while you’re at it.\n\nĠugar Hangout & Bar\n\nWith a cosy interior and funky tunes coming from the speakers, Ġugar has real hippie vibes. Enjoy the cheap local dishes with a great beer of your taste and sit back and relax on the steps of Ġugar.\n\nFestivals in Valletta\n\nThe Maltese love their festivals, and among the numerous festivals across the islands, Valletta hosts some of the most extravagant ones. If you get the chance, try and time your visit to coincide with one of these:\n\nValletta Jazz Festival\n\nEven if jazz is not your thing, you can’t help but admire the musicianship on display at the Malta Valletta Jazz Festival. Both local and international stars descend on the city for the five-day event held in July.\n\nNotte Bianca\n\nNotte Bianca, translated as the White Night, is a celebration of the arts and sees artists of all crafts taking part. Music is once again a strong theme in the festival, as are the performing arts. If you are paying the islands a visit in October, Notte Bianca is not to be missed.\n\nMalta International Arts Festival\n\nIn the last weeks of June, the Malta International Arts Festival hits the streets. Featuring new and up and coming artists, displays, music and theatrical performances are held all over the city."
