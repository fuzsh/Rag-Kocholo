        "text": "Malta has been inhabited since approximately 5,900 BC. Its location in the centre of the Mediterranean has historically given it great strategic importance as a naval base, with a succession of powers having contested and ruled the islands, including the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, Romans, Greeks, Arabs, Normans, Aragonese, Knights of St. John, French, and British, amongst others.\n\nWith a population of about 516,000 (excluding tourists and expats) over 316 km2 (122 square miles), Malta is the world’s tenth-smallest country and the fourth most densely populated sovereign country. Its capital is Valletta, the smallest national capital in the European Union by area and population. According to the data from 2020 by Eurostat, the Functional Urban Area and metropolitan region covered the whole island and had a population of 480,134. According to the United Nations, ESPON and EU Commission, “the whole territory of Malta constitutes a single urban region”.\n\nMalta is increasingly referred to as a city-state and listed in rankings concerning cities or metropolitan areas. Malta is one of the two island countries in the Mediterranean, along with Cyprus.\n\nBritish Influences\n\nMalta became a British colony in 1813, serving as a way station for ships and the headquarters for the British Mediterranean Fleet. It was besieged by the Axis powers during World War II and was an important Allied base for operations in North Africa and the Mediterranean. The British parliament passed the Malta Independence Act in 1964, giving Malta independence from the United Kingdom as the State of Malta, with Elizabeth II as its queen. The country became a republic in 1974. Since independence, it has been a member state of the (British) Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations and joined the European Union in 2004.\n\nBritish influences can be seen in many aspects of the Maltese way of life, and more so in the island’s education, political system and the prevailing use of the English language.\n\nReligion\n\nMalta has had Christians since the time of Early Christianity, and this religion has been the dominating one ever since, if not for the Arab period during the early Middle ages, where Malta, like elsewhere in Southern Europe, fell under Arab rule. The Arab period ended with the Norman liberation of Malta by Roger I in 1091.\n\nToday, while Catholicism is the state religion, the Constitution of Malta guarantees freedom of conscience and religious worship.\n\nThere is a gradual increase in secularisation and various other religions appearing due to numerous factors, such as migration.\n\nThe Maltese language\n\nThe official languages are Maltese and English, and 66% of the current Maltese population is at least conversational in Italian.\n\nMaltese is one of the European Union’s official languages and is a living testimony to the island’s ancient history. The present-day Maltese language originated from Siculo-Arabic, the dialect in Sicily during the Middle Ages, from where most Maltese people trace their ancestry.\n\nWhile this Siculo-Arabic dialect slowly faded away on the neighbouring island of Sicily, it not only survived in Malta but gradually morphed into the fully-fledged language we know today.\n\nWhile the grammar remains mostly based on Siculo-Arabic, it is estimated that over 70% of the Maltese vocabulary is of Italian, English or French origin."
