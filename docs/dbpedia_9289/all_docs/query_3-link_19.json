        "text": "The fortifications of Valletta are a series of defensive walls and other fortifications which surround the capital city of Valletta, Malta. The first fortification to be built was Fort Saint Elmo in 1552, but the fortifications of the city proper began to be built in 1566 when it was founded by Grand Master Jean de Valette. Modifications were made throughout the following centuries, with the last major addition being Fort Lascaris which was completed in 1856. Most of the fortifications remain largely intact today.\n\nThe city of Valletta, along with Nicosia in Cyprus, was considered to be a practical example of an ideal city of the Renaissance, and this was due to its fortifications as well as the urban life within the city.[1] Valletta's fortifications are regarded as the most important of the fortifications of Malta,[2] and they form part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[3]\n\nHistory[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nThe construction of a fortified city on the Sciberras Peninsula was first proposed in 1524, when the Order of St. John sent a commission to inspect the Maltese Islands.[4] Back then, the only fortification on the peninsula was a militia watchtower built by the in 1488.[5] The tower was strengthened in 1533, but the proposed city was not built since the Order focused on building the fortifications of Birgu, which had become their base.[6]\n\nIn 1551, an Ottoman force briefly attacked Malta, and then sacked Gozo and captured Tripoli, and as a result, the Order set up a commission to improve the island's fortifications. In 1552, the Aragonese watchtower was demolished and Fort Saint Elmo was built in its place. The fort played a significant role in the Great Siege of Malta of 1565. It eventually fell after a month of fierce fighting (in which the Ottoman general Dragut was killed). The knights held out in Birgu and Senglea until a relief force arrived, and the siege was lifted.\n\nConstruction[]\n\nAfter the Order emerged victorious from the siege, it received financial support from Europe, which was used to construct the new capital city on the Sciberras Peninsula. The Italian engineer Francesco Laparelli was sent by the Pope to design the city's fortifications,[7] which were designed along the Italian bastioned system.[8] Laparelli's original design consisted of a bastioned enciente, with nine cavaliers and a ditch. The city was to be designed along a grid plan, and was to include a naval arsenal and a Manderaggio (a harbour for small ships).\n\nThe city's first stone was laid by Grand Master Jean de Valette on 28 March 1566, and the new city was called Valletta in his honour. The city walls were among the first structures to be built within the city, and were largely complete by the 1570s. Some changes were made to the design while the city was being constructed, and only two cavaliers were constructed, while the arsenal and Manderaggio were never built. Fort St. Elmo, which had been severely damaged in the 1565 siege, was also rebuilt and integrated in the city walls.[4]\n\nThe city of Valletta officially became the capital city of Malta and the seat of the Order on 18 March 1571, although it was still unfinished.[9] By the end of the 16th century, Valletta was the largest settlement in Malta.[8]\n\nImprovements and modifications[]\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Valletta's fortifications were strengthened with the construction of various outworks, consisting of four counterguards along the land front, as well as a covertway and a glacis. The northern end of the peninsula, including Fort St. Elmo, was also enclosed in a bastioned enciente (known as the Carafa Enciente) in the late 1680s to prevent a landing from the sea.[5]\n\nDespite the modifications, it was realized that the walls of Valletta were not strong enough to withstand a long siege. In 1635, construction of the Floriana Lines commenced, enclosing Valletta's land front. The Floriana Lines also modified until the 18th century. Later on, the suburb of Floriana developed in the area between the Floriana Lines and the Valletta Land Front, and it is now a town in its own right.[4]\n\nThe flanks of the city were further protected in the 17th and 18th century, with the construction of the Santa Margherita Lines, Cottonera Lines and Fort Ricasoli on the Grand Harbour side, and Fort Manoel and Fort Tigné on the Marsamxett side.[10] Further proposals, including construction of fortifications on Corradino and Ta' Xbiex, were also made but were never implemented.[11]\n\nFrench occupation and British rule[]\n\nThe fortifications of Valletta first saw use during the French invasion of Malta on 9 June 1798. The Order capitulated only three days later on 12 June, and Valletta and its fortifications were handed over to the French.\n\nA couple of months after the beginning of the French occupation, the Maltese people rebelled against the French and blockaded them in the Harbour area with British, Neapolitan and Portuguese support. The French managed to hold out in Valletta until September 1800, when General Vaubois capitulated to the British, who took control of the islands.[12]\n\nVarious modifications were made to Valletta's fortifications during British rule. The most significant of these was the construction of Fort Lascaris between 1854 and 1856. Other alterations included construction of retired batteries and concrete gun emplacements, changes to parapets and their embrasures, and the construction of gunpowder magazines. All three original Hospitaller gateways to Valletta were demolished, and two of them were replaced by larger gates.\n\nThe British proposed the demolition of the fortifications a number of times in the 19th century. The first proposal was made by Major-General Henry Pigot at the beginning of the century.[13] In 1872, the demolition of the city's outworks was proposed, while the demolition of the entire land front was suggested in 1882.[4] Eventually, the fortifications were left largely intact, and the only part that was demolished was St. Madeleine's Lunette, which was located near the entrance to the city (on the site now occupied by the Triton Fountain).\n\nThe fortifications were eventually decommissioned between the late 19th or early 20th centuries. Some parts, such as Fort Saint Elmo, Fort Lascaris and the Saluting Battery, remained in use until after World War II, with Fort St. Elmo being decommissioned in 1972.\n\nIn the 1960s, the 19th century Porta Reale was demolished to make way for a modern City Gate.[14]\n\nPresent day[]\n\nThe first plans to restore the fortifications of Valletta, along with those of Birgu, Mdina and the Cittadella, were made in 2006.[15][16] Restoration started in 2010, with the project being described as \"the biggest in a century\". Squatters were evicted from public lands around the fortifications.[17] The upper part of Fort Saint Elmo has been restored, while its lower parts have been cleaned up.[18] The Chapel of St. Roche on St. Michael's Counterguard, which was bombed in World War II, was rebuilt in 2014 as part of the restoration.[19]\n\nIn 2011, the City Gate built in the 1960s was demolished, and a new City Gate was completed in 2014.[20]\n\nLayout[]\n\nLand front[]\n\nThe Valletta Land Front is the large bastioned enciente enclosing the landward approach to the city. It consists of the following:[21]\n\nSt. Michael's Bastion – a demi-bastion on the western extremity of the land front. Two windmills were built on it in 1674, but they were demolished in the 19th century.[22][23] The bastion now forms part of Hastings Gardens.[24]\n\nSt. John's Curtain – the curtain wall linking St. Michael's and St. John's Bastions. It now forms part of Hastings Gardens.[25]\n\nSt. John's Bastion – a large obtuse-angled bastion with a reconstructed echaugette at its salient angle. It now forms part of Hastings Gardens.[26]\n\nSt. John's Cavalier – a pentagonal cavalier overlooking St. John's Bastion. It is now the embassy of the SMOM to Malta.[27]\n\nPorta Reale Curtain – the curtain wall linking St. John's and St. James Bastions. The city's main gate is located within the curtain wall.[28] The gate was rebuilt five times, with the present one being constructed between 2011 and 2014 to a design by Renzo Piano.\n\nSt. James Bastion – a large obtuse-angled bastion with an echaugette at its salient angle. Its thick parapets with embrasures have been dismantled. The bastion is occupied by the Central Bank of Malta and a car park.[29]\n\nSt. James Cavalier – a pentagonal cavalier overlooking St. James Bastion. It is now a cultural centre.[30]\n\nCastile Curtain – the curtain wall linking St. James and St. Peter & Paul Bastions. Its parapet has been largely dismantled to make way for the road leading from Floriana to Valletta.[31]\n\nSt. Peter and St. Paul Bastion – a two-tiered corner bastion on the eastern extremity of the land front. The upper part is now the Upper Barrakka Gardens, while the lower part contains the Saluting Battery.[32] The British built Fort Lascaris below the bastion.\n\nThe entire land front is surrounded by a deep ditch.[33] Remains of a flanking battery within the ditch were unearthed in 2012.[34]\n\nThe bastions are further protected by the following outworks:\n\nSt. Michael's Counterguard – a three-tiered counterguard built in 1640 near St. Michael's Bastion. Its lower tier contains an echaugette at its salient angle, and a small chapel dedicated to St. Roche.[35] The chapel was destroyed in World War II but was rebuilt in 2014.[19]\n\nSt. John's Counterguard – a pentagonal counterguard built in 1640 near St. John's Bastion. Its salient angle contains an echaugette, and it also contains a gunpowder magazine.

It was dismantled in the 19th century, and its site is now occupied by the Triton Fountain.[37]\n\nSt. James Counterguard – a pentagonal counterguard built in 1640 near St. James Bastion. Its salient angle contains an echaugette, and it also contains a gunpowder magazine. Its central platform houses the Central Bank of Malta annex.[38]\n\nSt. Peter and St. Paul Counterguard – a two-tiered counterguard built in 1640 near St. Peter and St. Paul Bastion. Its salient angle contains an echaugette, and it also contains a gunpowder magazine and a concrete observation platform.[39]\n\nThe outworks were surrounded by an advanced ditch, but only a part of it remains since most of it was filled in with rubble.[37]\n\nMarsamxett enciente[]\n\nThe enciente along the side facing Marsamxett Harbour starts from St. Michael's Bastion of the Valletta Land Front, and ends at St. Gregory's Bastion of Fort Saint Elmo. It consists of the following:[21]\n\nSt. Andrew Tenaille – a small tenaille beneath St. Michael's Bastion.[40]\n\nSt. Andrew's Bastion – an assymetrical pentagonal bastion. It is two-tiered, with its lower part originally containing the Marsamxett Gate, which was demolished in the early 20th century.[41] A small faussebraye is located beneath the bastion. Ponsonby's Column was built on the bastion in the 1830s, but it was destroyed by lightning in 1864.[42]\n\nManderaggio Curtain – the curtain wall linking St. Andrew's and San Salvatore Bastions. It was originally divided into two parts, to allow ships to enter the Manderaggio, but the breach was walled up when work on the Manderaggio was abandoned.[43]\n\nSan Salvatore Bastion – a flat-faced artillery platform. Various World War II air raid shelters were dug within the bastion.[44]\n\nGerman Curtain – a small curtain wall north of San Salvatore Bastion. Air raid shelters were also dug within its walls.
