        "text": "Positioned at the crossroads between Europe and Africa, the Maltese Islands boast a history and culture which reflect its geographical characteristic. After being subjected to foreign rule for centuries, Malta is now a free independent Republic island-state, member of the European Union since 2004. The official languages in Malta are Maltese and English. A complex derivative of Semitic and Romance languages, Maltese is a very particular language, having an Arabic sound but using Latin characters.\n\nThe particular language of the Maltese people is one of the numerous witnesses to Maltaâs turbulent narrative, which started around 7,000 years ago with a prehistoric community settling on our shores from nearby Sicily. With the arrival of the Phoenicians, Malta unveiled its historic period. Centuries of foreign dominion have left there imprint on the development of a rich history, influenced by the Ancient Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Spanish, French, Italian and British.\n\nThe capital city, Valletta, is considered the Baroque capital par excellence. Built in the 1560s by the Knights of St John to serve as the headquarters of the Order, Valletta is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and will be European Capital of Culture in 2018.\n\nThe Maltese climate is typically Mediterranean. Winters are mild and summers very hot. The lack of rain during the summer months results into very dry land, which limits agricultural activity. With a population of around 421,000, the Maltese people have developed an incredible flexibility and resourcefulness, adapting themselves to changing economic circumstances and developing a strong tourism industry.\n\nMalta offers the perfect atmosphere for any event, be it a large-scale conference or an exclusive study-trip. The diverse facets that the archipelago offers, along with the hospitable nature of the Maltese people, ensure peace of mind to the organiser and an unforgettable experience for the participants."
