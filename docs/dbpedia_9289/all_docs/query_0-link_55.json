With a past that includes the Phoenicians, the Arabs, the Knights of St. John as well as the French under Napoleon, Malta and history truly go hand in hand.\n\nAchieving Independence from the British in 1964, and becoming a Republic ten years later, Malta has always managed to adapt and develop through time. The Island has kept abreast with all the luxuries of the modern world, but there is evidence of the island’s vast and vivid past everywhere you look!"
