        "text": "Cospicua is the largest of the three cities and was previously known as Bormla or Cottonera. It was renamed by the Knights of St. John because of the brave and conspicuous role played by its residents during the Great Siege of Malta in 1565.\n\nMost of Cospicua’s shoreline has been developed as a Marina, with a good selection of Bars and Restaurants in the locailty.\n\nIts fortifications, protecting both the city and its neighbours Vittoriosa and Senglea, begun being built in 1638 but not completed for another 70 years. In 1722, Grand Master Marc Antonio Zondadari declared Bormla a city and in view of its strong bastions named it Città Cospicua. In 1776, the Order of St. John started to construct a dockyard, which was to play a vital role in the development of this city. During British rule in Malta, the Royal Navy made extensive use of the dockyard, particularly during the First World War and during the years preceding the Second World War. Bormla, along with the rest of the area around the Grand Harbour, was heavily bombed during second World War.\n\nSenglea, previously known and still commonly referred as Isla, is the smallest of the three cities. The old city is situated on a peninsula protruding into the Grand Harbour, facing the capital city of Valletta.\n\nThis locality is lovely and tranquil, being one of the oldest cities on the island which dates back to the 16th century, with many buildings and bastions built by the Knights of St. John making it one of the heaviest fortified areas on the Island. It is enclosed by spectacular bastions, with commanding views guarding the Grand Harbour.\n\nThere are a number of ferry services between Valletta and the Three Cities."
