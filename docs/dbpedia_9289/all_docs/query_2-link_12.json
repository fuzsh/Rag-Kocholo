        "text": "Built on a peninsula between two large natural harbours (Grand Harbour on the eastern side and Marsamxett Harbour to the West), the city sits perched on higher ground. Its streets were aligned in a grid-like layout, being wide and straight, which is said to have been chosen to allow the sea breeze to provide respite from Malta’s hot summer weather.\n\nValletta is Malta’s administrative and commercial hub, with several Maltese government departments occupying some of its historic buildings and several financial and logistics companies having their offices here.\n\nDespite its small size, Valletta is packed with sites of historical significance, with buildings dating back to the 16th century. So much so that it’s been an officially listed UNESCO World Heritage site since 1980.\n\nThat’s right, the city of Valletta as a whole is recognised by UNESCO for its historical and cultural value and is designated as having “outstanding universal value”. That doesn’t mean the place is swarming with tourists, however, although tour groups aren’t an uncommon sight, particularly during the summer months.\n\nIntrigued? In this article, I cover the basics of what you need to know about Valletta, what makes it so special and what’s worth seeing and experiencing when you decide to pay this magnificent city a visit.\n\nRestaurants & food recommendations\n\nValletta’s nightlife isn’t known for its clubs with loud music but rather for dining and casual drinks. There’s a good choice of quality restaurants, none overly expensive, although few budget options are around. In general, it’s always advised to book a table for dinner, especially on weekends.\n\nMost of the options mentioned are quite popular, so the earlier you book, the better a chance you stand of getting a table.\n\nThese are my personal recommendations: Best Valletta Restaurants Guide.\n\nRestaurants at the Valletta Waterfront\n\nFancy a 10-15 minute walk down to the Valletta Waterfront? You’ll find a number of restaurants and bars here, housed in the old (but recently renovated) storerooms. Apart from the international Hard Rock franchise, you should also try Tribelli and Brown’s Kitchen for a good selection of food that is reasonably priced.\n\nDrinks & bars in Valletta\n\nTrabuxu is a casual but cool wine bar set up in a semi-basement cellar and rustic decor. Great place to get a good bottle of wine and a platter of cold cuts, cheeses, etc.\n\nKingsway Bar & Restaurant is a popular place for both drinks and brunch/lunch. It’s a pretty classy place with both indoor and outdoor tables overlooking Republic Square\n\nCafé Society is one of the most popular bars in the city and is LGBTQ+-friendly. It’s a good bar to have a (cleverly named!) cocktail in a nice and chilled atmosphere. You can even sit outside on the stairs and enjoy the night breeze. Some evenings there is live music and jazz.\n\nBridge Bar is located close to Victoria Gate, on the South end of the city and is a wine bar known to host jazz sessions on Friday nights in summer. Casual seating on the steps and the bridge just outside, combined with atmospheric lighting and good wine and platters, make for a unique experience. The best place for info is their Facebook page.\n\nHistory of Valletta\n\nBesides being the smallest capital of the European Union, it’s also one of the youngest, having been founded a little over 450 years ago. The fortified city was built by the Knights of the Order of St. John (also known as the Knights of Malta or the Knights Hospitaller) on a peninsula with two harbours on its flanks.\n\nHaving survived The Great Siege by successfully warding off an attempt by the Ottoman Empire to invade the Maltese islands, the Knights strategically chose the city’s location for its highly defensible position. A small island in the Mediterranean Sea, Malta was always vulnerable and was considered to be located on the doorstep of Europe and its mostly Christian population.\n\nWith funding from the Vatican, amongst other benefactors, the Knights built the new city of Valletta to fortify Malta as a stronghold for Roman Catholicism. Despite its small size, Malta had a significant military advantage due to its location and was the perfect location for the Knights to accommodate the sick and injured, which was (and still is!) their core mission (as opposed to being a military order as such).\n\nEven if you’re not into history much, if you really want to understand Valletta at its core, it pays to read up on the city’s history. Why and how was the city built? Who were the people who built and designed it? How is it that there’s so much to see in terms of history and culture?\n\nI answer all of these questions here: Valletta’s history: A tale of conflict and cultural development"
