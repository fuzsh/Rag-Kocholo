        "text": "Public holiday in Malta today being Workers Day. We decided to visit Valletta which is only a 5 minute and 2 Euro ferry ride away. Valletta is the capital city of Malta. It is located between the Grand Harbour to the east and Marsamxett Harbour to the west. As Malta’s capital city, it is a commercial centre for shopping, bars, dining, and café life and at just 0.61 square kilometres, it is the European Union's smallest capital city. Being so small, I think we walked every street in the town, that included amazing views across the harbour.\n\nWell the good news is Tina is okay and was back at the hotel last night. She is sporting a small cut and a swollen eye but was in good spirits at breakfast. Said goodbye to everyone. It was a good group to travel with - everyone mixed well and lots of laughs. Now at the airport waiting for my flight to Frankfurt.\n\nThis morning we met our new guide, Cynthia. She is very organised and communicates well. We were given a glass of a locally made soft drink called Kinnie. So then a bus ride for about 20 minutes to Valletta, the capital of Malta. A walk along the Main Street which is the same as many other towns in that it becomes a pedestrian only road at a certain time in the morning until late afternoon. Malta was heavily bombed during the Second World War and the Opera House is testament to this with only a few pillars and the base still standing. To...\n\nWe were docked in Valetta, Malta by 7:00 in the morning. Marilynn was startled to see a man looking up at the ship when she opened the curtains, and we felt that we were docked just across the street from the apartment buildings lining the road beneath the ancient walls. Malta Is an island that has been invaded countless times, beginning with the ancient Phoenicians and followed by, just to mention a few, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans, Crusaders, Spain, Napoleon’s army and lastly, the British. Because of the British occupation, English...\n\nMy trip to Mdina, the former capital of Malta, by public bus got off to a slow start this morning. The bus stop is only 100 metres from the apartment & I got there in plenty of time for the 9:15 bus. It didn’t come & neither did the 9:30 one, then I realized that it didn’t look like a regular city bus so I’d let 2 of them go past. I finally got to the central bus station which is huge & the bus I needed was the furthest from the information booth. Of course, true to form, I just missed a bus but they were only 10 minutes apart & it was a...\n\nIt’s still hot but I planned a full day of sightseeing after my day off yesterday. The Hop-on Hop-off bus has 2 routes, the north & south so I started off on the first bus of the day which was the north route. Just as well I had plenty of time because the bus stop had moved closer to the cruise terminal to catch passengers from the huge Costa Pacifica out of Genoa, which was full of thousands of Italians. The bus was full by the time we left, but most of them got off in Mdina which I’ve decided to leave until tomorrow because, with an hour...\n\nOne of the great advantages of travelling independently instead of on a tour is that you can occasionally take the day off if you feel like it. That’s exactly what I did today. My weekly Zoom session with the family ended at 10:30am my time & it was forecast to be 34C today (93F) so I didn’t want to spend too much time in the sun after the hot day yesterday. I went up the hill to the supermarket I’ve found in the centre of town & bought the ingredients to make a chicken casserole because I wanted some home cooking for a change after eating...\n\nIt was forecast to be hot again (33C) so I got an early start. I walked along the seafront among the fishermen, to the fast ferry wharf which is also the starting point for the Hop-on Hop-off buses. After looking at the schedules, I decided to spend the day on Gozo, a small island to the north of Malta but still part of the Maltese Republic. The senior fare on the fast ferry was only 3 Euro so I don’t know how much less the regular one would be. It took 45 minutes to make the crossing, then there was a sightseeing bus waiting to meet the...\n\nI wasn’t feeling great yesterday, so I decided to have an easy day. There are still lots of places I want to see outside Valletta but every time I go into the town, which is just a short walk from the apartment, I find new treasures. This morning, I vowed to find St John’s Co-cathedral, supposedly the highlight of a trip to Malta. When I looked at the map, it seems I’d passed it a couple of times but hadn’t recognised it because it’s very plain on the outside in contrast to the lavishly decorated baroque interior. The main entrance is...\n\nThe closest attraction to the apartment seemed to be the best place to start today. It’s called The Malta Experience, an audio/visual presentation of 7,000 years of Maltese history in 45 minutes & it was excellent. There were only about 10 of us in a theatre which could seat hundreds & each seat was equipped with headphones where you could select the audio in 16 different languages. I noticed that the English version was narrated by Derek Jacobi. The original Knights of St John of Jerusalem (or Knights Hospitallers) were founded in the 11th...\n\nThe taxi was on time at 10:00 am & got to the airport in record time. The traffic here is crazy but it seems no-one will mess with a taxi even though there were plenty of instances when I was sure he’d have to give way to these very aggressive Sicilian drivers. He just kept going although the other cars were just inches away. I’m flying for the first, & maybe the last, time with Ryanair who invented low-cost, low-service airlines. I’m doing it not because I wanted to save money but they’re the only airline I could find flying from Catania...\n\nWe arrived in Malta, entering the Grand Harbor of Valletta. The harbor is protected on both sides by ancient fortresses. The entry and exit from the harbor is spectacular. The first of two days in Malta we went to the old capital of Mdina for a concert in the Mdina Cathedral. We were treated to an orchestra, choir, and operatic singers. The acoustics on the cathedral were amazing without any electronic enhancement. Mdina is called the “Silent City” as cars are not allowed in the streets, except for deliveries to local shops.
