The complete microfilm collection contains over 6,500 archival folders, volumes, and registers with records dating from the 12th century through the early 19th century. The primary microfilm project centered on the Archives of the Order of Malta and its two related collections, Treasury A and Treasury B. The project also microfilmed 33 volumes of the Archives of the Università of Città Notabile. Cataloging the Archives of the Order of Malta is an ongoing project, currently focusing on updating information from old repertoires and HMML's Legacy Catalog. Originals are periodically checked to verify data in the records.\n\nArchives of the Order of Malta\n\nThe pre-1798 historical archives of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem and its central offices are held in the National Library of Malta.
