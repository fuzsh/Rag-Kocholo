        "text": "Valletta, the capital of Malta, was founded in 1566 by Grand Master Jean Parisot de la Valette, after the victory of the Knights of the Order of St. John over the Ottoman Empire in the Great Siege of Malta in 1565.\n\nValletta was erected on the Sciberras Peninsula, a site that dominated the two main harbors of Malta: the Grand Harbour and the Marsamxett Harbour. This ensured the defense of maritime routes and offered a clear view of potential threats.\n\nThe city was initially conceived as a fortification to protect the island against future Ottoman attacks. Its design was the work of military engineer Francesco Laparelli, who proposed an urban plan based on a grid, something revolutionary for the time.\n\nUnder the rule of the Knights of the Order of St. John, Valletta became a cultural and administrative center. The inns or auberges housed the knights, while the Grand Master’s Palace functioned as the seat of government. St. John’s Co-Cathedral, with its opulent decoration and art collection, including the famous painting by Caravaggio, symbolized the religious power of the order.\n\nValletta fell into French hands in 1798 when Napoleon Bonaparte captured it on his way to Egypt. However, his rule was brief, as the Maltese, supported by the British, rebelled. In 1800, the British established their control, turning Malta into a military bastion. Valletta transformed into a vital port for the British Empire during the 19th century, consolidating itself as a key base for naval operations in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe strategic importance of Valletta made it a key target during World War II. Between 1940 and 1942, Valletta and the rest of Malta endured a constant siege. German Luftwaffe and Italian Regia Aeronautica planes relentlessly bombed the city. There were more than 3,000 air raids on Malta during this period, which destroyed much of Valletta, including the historic Royal Theatre.\n\nMalta was an outpost of the British Empire, and its port in Valletta became a vital base for the Royal Navy. From there, the British could disrupt Axis supply lines, especially fuel and supplies shipments to German and Italian forces in North Africa.\n\nThe population resisted bravely, and for their resilience, King George VI awarded the George Cross to the island in 1942. Malta was the only region to receive this high decoration, symbolizing the courage and unity of the nation. The Cross still represents the Maltese spirit and appears today on the national flag.\n\nGetting to Valletta, the capital of Malta, is relatively straightforward as it is well-connected to the rest of the Maltese archipelago. The most popular means of transport in Malta is the bus, which offers an extensive and economical network that connects virtually all points of interest on the island.\n\nIf you prefer driving, you can rent a car at Malta Airport. Driving is on the left, British style, and there are underground parking lots in Valletta for visitors. Keep in mind that traffic within Valletta is restricted, and some main roads are completely pedestrian.\n\nIf you are in Sliema or St. Julian’s and plan to visit Valletta, you can take lines 13, 14, 15, 16, or 21, which will take you directly to Valletta. These buses operate frequently throughout the day, and the journey lasts approximately 20 to 30 minutes, depending on traffic.\n\nAnother recommended option is to take the ferry from Sliema. The Sliema Ferry provides a service that directly connects to Valletta in less than 20 minutes. This option is not only quick but also offers a delightful travel experience with spectacular views of the harbor and the city skyline from the water.\n\nIf you are in Mdina or Rabat and plan to visit Valletta, you can easily take one of the direct buses that connect these localities with the capital. Lines 50, 51, 52, 53, and 56 offer regular services to Valletta.\n\nYou can find all bus schedules on the official website of Malta Public Transport.\n\nValletta, the historic capital of Malta, offers a rich blend of culture, history, and modern activities that attract travelers from around the world. It is an essential place to visit in Malta and discover the most emblematic sites.\n\nThere are several must-visit attractions in Valletta that you should include in your itinerary. Start by exploring the National Museum of Archaeology, which houses an impressive collection of artifacts that tell the rich prehistory of Malta. Do not miss the opportunity to visit the St. John’s Co-Cathedral, known for its luxurious baroque interior and the famous works of Caravaggio housed there.\n\nThe Upper Barrakka Gardens offer one of the best views of the Grand Harbour and the Three Cities, being a perfect place to escape the urban bustle and immerse yourself in stunning panoramas. Continue your journey with a visit to Casa Rocca Piccola, a fascinating window into Maltese aristocratic life through the centuries. It is also worth exploring Fort St. Elmo, which houses the National War Museum, offering detailed insights into Malta’s crucial role in European military history."
