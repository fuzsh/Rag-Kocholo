        "text": "A changing Capital\n\nUp until some ten years ago, the streets of Valletta were normally deserted after 9 pm. It sounds very unnatural for a European capital city but in the case of this city, Valletta was only considered as a place worth visiting only by day. Luckily, things have started to change. And this change came with a wave of drastic investment and a renewed interest into the arts and secrets which lie beneath the capital’s surface.\n\nArtists from all across the globe started to invest in the Maltese capital seeking inspiration through its unique architecture and Mediterranean charisma. Streets which were before considered as desolated and abandoned were now being transformed into hotspots for cafes, bars and restaurants.\n\nA perfect example of all this is Strait Street, a corner in the city which was infamous only due to its sinful past. The street, better known with locals as ‘Strada Stretta’, was the lane where soldiers travelling aboard ships during the wars would spend their nights in the company of local women. The place even became the source for novels and local TV dramas.\n\nBecause of this renewed interest, a Valletta which was otherwise left for the ageing local population was now seeing a lot of foreigners and Maltese from all across the island invest in the capital’s property. Whereas up until some years ago a property in Valletta was considered as a cheap and bad investment, now houses on the market in this area can go up to millions of euros. Recently the city has seen huge investment in magnificent boutique hotels, accommodations in old townhouses which were brilliantly restored to offer a unique experience. You can easily find accommodation in Valletta on Booking.com.\n\nWhat really pushed Valletta into a new era was the complete restructure and modernisation of some of its most iconic buildings such as the Triton Fountain and St Georges Square. The next big investment was in a new parliament. This injection of artistic touch came with a helping hand from a world-famous artistic director Renzo Piano (architect of the Chard in London among others). All of these major attractions (which will be mentioned later on) have helped Valletta take a giant leap forward.\n\nIn 2018, Valletta was also named as the European Capital of Culture, yet another huge source of investment into this wonderful city. Today, nights in Valletta are as fun as can be. Dozens of restaurants (we mention some of the best below) fill every corner and artistic activities go on practically all year round. It has become the home of painters, poets and writers, but also the hub for modern bars and restaurants. The old meets the new. Art meets politics and palazzos meet modern apartments. Dear readers, we’d like you to meet our beloved capital, Valletta.\n\nHistory\n\nOne thing which Valletta definitely manages to champion is history. The streets of Valletta have seen a lot of bloodsheds, French grandmasters, religious orders, violent conflicts and revolutions. If you are to visit this city you should equip yourself with, at least the very basics. Let’s start with the name.\n\nValletta is named after Grandmaster Jean Parisot de la Valette who was the head of the Knights of St John in the mid-1500s. It became Malta’s capital in 1570. The city itself was built right after the great siege of 1565, a battle of legendary proportions which saw the Knights of St John clash with the then infamous Ottoman powers. Malta left the siege victorious and historians today agree that this important point in history would have changed the faith of all of Europe.\n\nThe city was designed by military engineer Francesco Laparelli. The epicentre of the city was built on an area called Mount Sciberras. After Laparelli, Giolormo Cassar took over the structural works after spending years in Rome. He adopted the style into the Maltese capital. If you are a history enthusiast then make sure you listen to a BBC podcast called In Our Time about the Great Siege of Malta 1565. You can find it on BBC radio 4 or through Spotify.\n\nIn 1798 Malta’s capital was seized by the French. Only two years later the Maltese revolt against the French garrison and that same year the British occupied our land. By 1814, Valletta became a strategic British naval base in the Mediterranean. That is why during the Second World War, the city was heavily bombarded through air raids by the Germans and Italians.\n\nThe 7th of June is an important date in the Maltese calendar. On this date in 1919, Maltese workers were demonstrating in the streets of Valletta against the British rule and because the colonial rulers failed to help with supplies of food to the local population. The date remained marked in history because the British invaders had shot at the crowd and killed four people. This event was seen as the first step towards Maltese independence."
