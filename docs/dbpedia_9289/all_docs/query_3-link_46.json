        "text": "Malta is a beautiful, small, and rich European country located in the Mediterranean Sea between Sicily and the North African Coast with its three islands: Malta, Gozo, and Comino island. It is a lightly populated country with a population of around 533,286 in 2022 (as per the latest United States data) and its currency is the Euro. Malta is one of the favorite tourist destinations and film production places due to its warm climate and eye-catching landscape. It is believed that it is the oldest country with lots of old temples, like the Megalithic temple of Malta.\n\nThe capital of Malta is Valletta, which is a small walled city, established around the 1500s by the Knights of St.John, a Roman Catholic order.\n\nNow, let’s deeply explore “Where is Valletta Malta on a map”\n\nValletta is a beautiful fortified capital of Malta which is located on Mount Sceberras, which runs like a tongue dividing the bay into two harbors, Marsamxett harbor to the west and Grand Harbor to the east. On 18 March 1571, Valletta was chosen as the capital of Malta, a fortified city comprising bastions, curtains, and cavaliers with an area of 0.61 square kilometers, making it the smallest capital city of the European Union with a population of around 5730 (2016). The city was named after St Jean Parisot de la Valletta (Grand Master of the order of Saint John). Valletta is known for its 320 monuments and making it a tourist attraction spot, adding to its glory in 1980 it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Later, in 1552, Fort Saint Elmo was built in the place of the Aragonite watchtower. In 1565, Fort Saint put his weapons in front of the Ottomans and the Order of Saint came to protect the siege of Malta, the Grandmaster de Valletta started building a fortified city with the help of European kings and Princes and laid the first stone of foundation, which was later named as Our lady of Victories Church but his dream of making Valletta does not reach its endpoint as he died due to stroke. After the death of de Valletta, his dream was carried forward by his assistant, Girolamo Caser, and he designed the architecture of this beautiful city. In 1798, the French took over Valletta and in 1800 the British captured it by defeating the French.
