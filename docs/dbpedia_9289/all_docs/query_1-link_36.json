        "text": "By Cruise & Travel | 16 Oct 2023\n\nThis Mediterranean capital’s unique history and buzzing contemporary vibe are an irresistible combination for cruisers, writes Gillian Thornton\n\nFew Mediterranean ports pack quite as much of a punch as the Grand Harbour in Valletta, its entrance guarded by the twin forts of Saint Elmo and Saint Angelo. To the right, the ramparts of the Maltese capital tower over the waterfront. To the left, narrow inlets packed with pleasure craft divide the communities of the Three Cities. And all around, buildings of honey-coloured stone jostle for position around the water.\n\nFamously described as a city ‘built by gentlemen for gentlemen’, Valletta owes its existence to the Knights of St John, a military and hospitaller order founded in the 11th century to protect Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land.\n\nExpelled from Rhodes in 1522 by the Turks, the Knights were invited to Malta in 1530 by Holv Roman Emperor Charles V, ruling until 1798 when they surrendered the island to Napoleon. They settled first in Birgu – today one of the Three Cities – but after the Ottoman siege of 1565, began building Valletta on the peninsula opposite.\n\nToday, cruise ships dock on Lascaris Wharf, directly below the walled city, and just one euro buys a return ticket for the panoramic lift to the terraces of Upper Barrakka Gardens.\n\nStop first to enjoy the harbour view – one of the finest in the Mediterranean – bracing yourself at midday for the firing of the noon day gun.\n\nThings to do in Valletta\n\nMalta’s rich history is evident all over Valletta, a World Heritage Site since 1980. Designed on a grid pattern, the city is easy to navigate and English is the joint official language with Maltese, a legacy of British governorship that began in 1800 after two years of French occupation. Malta gained independence in 1964 with Queen Elizabeth I as head of state, before becoming a Republic in 1974 within the Commonwealth, but it has been part of the EU since 2004 (visitmalta.com).\n\nFrom the hilltop gardens, skirt the bastion to your left to arrive at the City Gate. Outside the ramparts, the vast Tritons’ Fountain stands in a pedestrian square bordered by bus stops that serve all corners of the island. Inside the city, compare and contrast the new parliament building with the adjacent open-air theatre on Republic Street, both designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano.\n\nBehind the theatre stands a statue of Jean de Valette, Grand Master of the Knights who gave his name to their new city.\n\nVisit the State Rooms of the Grandmaster’s Palace in St George’s Square, now the office of the Maltese president.\n\nAll from wealthy Catholic families, the Knights represented eight different languages and lived within their own language groups in imposing baroque buildings today repurposed for municipal and public use. Get a taste inside the Auberge d’Italie, now the National Museum of Community Art, or MUZA – Maltese for inspiration’.\n\nValletta’s must-see heritage site is St John’s Co-Cathedral (closed Sundays), built by the Knights for their own use and ranked second to the cathedral in the medieval capital of Mdina. Expect an eye-popping interior of intricate gold leaf, ornate marble floors, and monumental wall paintings, plus the only signed painting by hot-headed Italian artist Caravaggio, who was commissioned in 1607 by the Grand Master to create the piece, but then imprisoned for fighting another Knight. He escaped to Sicily but died in Italy in 1610.\n\nHistory enthusiasts are spoilt for choice with forts, tunnels, and war museums, as well as a moving Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery at nearby Karkala, all reflecting Valletta’s role as a strategic British naval base until 1979.\n\nBut one of the nicest things to do is simply wander Valletta’s undulating streets and keep your eyes open. I did just that, and chanced upon the Church of St Paul’s Shipwreck, which commemorates the saint’s dramatic arrival here in 60AD, and a jorful street procession for the Feast of St Joseph. Look too for the ornate wooden balconies, a sign of wealth on a rocky island short on native timber.\n\nWhat to eat in Valletta\n\nWhen it’s time to refuel, check out authentic Maltese snacks such as ftira flatbreads topped with pizza-style toppings and pastizzi pastries filled with peas or ricotta, perhaps with a glass of Maltese wine, but Valletta also boasts a number of restaurants featured in the 2023 Michelin Guide, including ION and Noni. Or treat yourself to afternoon tea at the elegant Phoenicia Hotel near Tritons’ Fountain – a stylish stopover in this elegant baroque city.\n\nBest Valletta sightseeing ideas\n\nSee Mdina by bus\n\nTake a local bus from Valletta – or a Hop-On-Hop-Off City Sightseeing tour (North Route) – to this central fortified city. Must-see sites include the Domus Romana villa; the cathedral; and the art treasures of Palazzo Falson. For souvenirs, try Mina Glass near the city gate and for an Arab-inspired lunch, sample Medina restaurant.\n\nHead to Vittoriosa\n\nTake a ferry or water taxi from Lascaris Wharf for the short ride to Vittoriosa, known as Birgu in Maltese. First settlement of the Knights of St John, this charming district is now one of Valletta’s Three Cities along with neighbouring Senglea and Cospicua, and offers great hilltop panoramas of Valletta.\n\nExplore the maritime history\n\nAlso in Birgu and dominating the waterfront, the National Maritime Museum occupies the former naval bakery. Closed until late 2023 for renovation, it promises a fascinating journey through Malta’s maritime heritage. Don’t miss the baroque splendour of St Lawrence Church, set back from the quayside, or the picturesque old streets on the hill behind.\n\nValletta to Gozo day trip\n\nThe neighbouring island of Gozo makes a delightful add-on for passengers embarking or disembarking in Valletta, as well as a day excursion, just 45 minutes by fast ferry from Valletta. Greener and less built-up than its larger neighbour, Gozo offers heritage sites, walking routes and adventure sports.\n\nTravel back in time to Gozo’s earliest inhabitants at the Ggantija Temples, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the centre of the island. I also enjoyed walking the ramparts of the hilltop citadel in the nearby Gozitan capital, Victoria.\n\nThe clear waters around Gozo offer some of the Mediterranean’s best dive sites, especially around the small resort of Marsalfon on the north coast and in Dwejra Bay in the west. Take a boat ride beneath towering cliffs from Dwerja’s ‘inland sea’ or hunt for fossils on the beach. Just want to chill out? Try the tranquil red sands at Ramla Bay near Marsalforn.\n\nCruise lines calling at Valletta\n\nP&O Azura is home-porting in Valletta this year, while visiting cruise lines include Fred Olsen (Bollette), Holland America Line (Oosterdam), Saga (Spirit of Adventure), Silversea (Silver Dawn and Silver Moon), and Oceania (Marina, Sirena, Nautica and Riviera).\n\nRead more:"
