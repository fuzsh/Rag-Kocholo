        "text": "In 1798 French army officer Napoleon Bonaparte (later Napoleon I) captured the island, but the French presence was short-lived. By the middle of 1800 British troops that had been called in to assist the Maltese had arrived. The French held out for three months before they surrendered the island to the British. The Treaty of Amiens returned the island to the Knights in 1802. The Maltese protested and acknowledged Great Britain’s sovereignty, subject to certain conditions incorporated in a Declaration of Rights. The constitutional change was ratified by the Treaties of Paris (1814–15).\n\nMaltese claims for local autonomy were dismissed by Britain, but they never abated. Malta’s political status under Britain underwent a series of vicissitudes in which constitutions were successively granted, suspended, and revoked. British exploitation of Malta’s military facilities dominated the local economy, and the dockyard became the colony’s economic mainstay.\n\nThe island flourished during the Crimean War (1853–56) and was favourably affected by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Self-government was granted in 1921 on a dyarchical basis whereby Britain retained control of foreign and military affairs, while a newly created Maltese legislature was responsible for local issues. This agreement was withdrawn in 1933, mostly as a result of Maltese resistance to the imposition of English in lieu of Italian as Malta’s official language. As such, Malta reverted to a strictly colonial regime in which full power rested in the hands of the governor. During World War II (1939–45) the island underwent intense and prolonged bombing by the Axis Powers but did not surrender. The heroism of the Maltese people was recognized when the island as a whole was awarded the George Cross, Britain’s highest civilian decoration. Self-government was granted in 1947, revoked in 1959, and then restored in 1962. Malta finally achieved independence on September 21, 1964, becoming a member of the Commonwealth and subsequently a member of the Council of Europe. Malta became a republic on December 13, 1974.\n\nSalvino Busuttil\n\nThe immediate pre- and postindependence period was marked by a hardening polarization between Malta’s two major political parties. From 1962 to 1971, Malta was governed by the Nationalist Party (Partit Nazzjonalista; PN), which pursued a policy of firm alignment with the West. In 1971, however, the Malta Labour Party (Partit Laburista; MLP) came to power, embracing a policy of nonalignment and aggressively asserting Malta’s sovereignty. The MLP formed a special friendship with China and Libya and negotiated an agreement that led to the total withdrawal of British forces from Malta by 1979. The closure of the British base was celebrated by the Maltese government as the arrival of “real” independence.\n\nThe PN returned to power in 1987 and sought full membership in the European Economic Community (later succeeded by the European Union [EU]). But when the MLP took the reins again in 1996, the party froze Malta’s application for membership in the EU. The MLP’s time in office was short-lived, however, because Prime Minister Alfred Sant called for new elections in 1998 (three years ahead of schedule) after having lost support from his own party. The PN was returned to office in 1998; it reactivated the application for accession to the EU and ushered in major social and economic changes in pursuit of that goal. After considerable political wrangling between the PN and the MLP, Maltese voters in a 2003 referendum chose to join the EU, of which Malta became a member on May 1, 2004. Malta adopted the euro as its currency on January 1, 2008. The PN was again returned to power in 2008, winning the general elections over the MLP by a small margin of votes.\n\nLino Briguglio\n\nIn May 2011 Maltese voters approved a referendum recommending the legalization of divorce. Until then Malta had been the only EU country, and one of only a few countries worldwide, without a divorce law. Legislation permitting divorce was passed by the parliament in June and put into effect in October.\n\nIn 2013 the MLP, now known as the Labour Party after the name was changed in 2008, was returned to power with a relatively large majority and broadly adopted the same policies as the PN. The Labour Party did, however, take a more progressive position on social issues; 2014 saw passage of a bill legalizing civil unions for same-sex couples in spite of strong opposition from the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn 2016 the leak of the Panama Papers revealed that two of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat’s cabinet ministers, including his chief of staff, owned offshore companies in Panama. Daphne Caruana Galizia, a journalist who had been investigating the Panama Papers, claimed that Muscat’s wife also owned an offshore company the following year. Amid the fallout and calls for his resignation, Muscat called snap elections in 2017. He campaigned on a booming economy with low unemployment, rapid GDP growth, and a budget surplus and promised additional economic benefits and civil liberties. When elections were held in June, he was returned to the premiership with the Labour Party enjoying an absolute majority in parliament.\n\nMonths later Caruana Galizia was murdered. An investigation was launched, and in November 2019 police arrested and interrogated Yorgen Fenech, a businessman close to Muscat’s chief of staff, in connection to the murder. Muscat’s chief of staff was also questioned. Protesters demanded Muscat’s resignation, and he announced on November 30 that he would resign after a new Labour Party leader could be selected. On January 12, 2020, Robert Abela, the son of a former president, was elected leader of the party, and he was sworn in as prime minister the following day. Although Labour under Abela’s leadership oversaw some government reform, the remainder of the parliamentary term focused primarily on navigating the health and economic crises brought on by the global COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022 the Labour Party handily won another majority in parliament."
