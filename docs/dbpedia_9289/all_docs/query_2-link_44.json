        "text": "Tour Duration: 4hrs or customised\n\nHalf day Valletta and Mdina\n\nExplore Malta’s historic splendors of Malta in two walled cities. The former capital, Mdina, in the middle of the island, is a medieval town whose heritage dates to the ancient Phoenicians. In Valletta, see landmarks such as the Upper Barracca Gardens, St. John’s Co-Cathedral and the Magisterial Palace.\n\nWe will start by travelling back in time and discover the secrets of Mdina, the ancient capital city of Malta. Mdina, rests in a very majestic way, on one of the highest plateaus on the island overlooking breath taking views. Mdina has had many names including Maleth (Pheonician), Melite (Roman), Medina (Arabic), Citta Notabile (Spanish) and Citta Vecchia (Knights Period). Today it is also called the ‘Silent City’ because of its literally quiet and narrow streets that give off a quaint, yet very homely atmosphere.\n\nWe will continue to Valletta, the present Capital city of Malta. Valletta, Malta’s capital and Europe’s Capital City of Culture for 2018, is nothing but short of an open-air museum. It is a living experience of Baroque architecture, a monument donated by the Knights of St John nearly five centuries ago. Throughout the years, Valletta has welcomed emperors, heads of state, artists and poets and is now the permanent seat of the Maltese government.\n\nDotted with quaint cafés and wine bars, this UNESCO city is today one of Malta’s main tourist attractions, hosting among others, Palaces, Auberges, Churches, cathedrals, imposing bastions and a treasure of priceless paintings. It also provides a stunning snapshot of Malta’s Grand Harbour, often described as the most beautiful in the Mediterranean.\n\nOur suggested itinerary includes a visit to\n\nMdina\n\nMdina Main Gate\n\nExternal visit of Palazzo Vilhena and Standard Tower, Palace of Justice\n\nVillgenion Street with its noble palace such as Palazzo Inguanez, Palazzo Testaferrata Bonici, Palazzo Santa Sophia and Palazzo Falson\n\nThe Cathedral Square including the Metropolitan Cathedral itself, the Archbishop’s Palace and the Old Priest Seminary\n\nBastion Square\n\nValletta\n\nThe Upper Baracca Gardens\n\nEntrance of Valletta including the Renzo Piano project (Ruins of Opera House and Parliament building)\n\nRepublic Street\n\nMerchant Street\n\nExternal visit of the Auberges and Palaces of the Knights\n\nInternal visit of St John’s co-Cathedral and Caravaggio masterpieces (closed on Saturday afternoons and all day on Sunday’s)."
