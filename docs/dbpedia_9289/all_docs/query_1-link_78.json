        "text": "Addressing the world’s most critical problems will cost trillions of dollars. That amount far exceeds the individual reach of traditional philanthropies or most governments. RF Catalytic Capital (RFCC) allows a range of stakeholders to partner better together to address these funding gaps.\n\nA charitable offshoot of The Rockefeller Foundation, RFCC allows social innovators, impact investors, and governments to combine their financing toward shared ventures and projects. We provide the support and core infrastructure – legal counsel, IT, Salesforce, finance, grants, contracts, donor and program management – that enables project innovators to focus on implementation and scale.\n\nRFCC leverages The Rockefeller Foundation’s expertise and resources while collaborating with partners and investors to multiply impact. By offering an innovative way for foundations, impact investors, and governments to combine their resources, RFCC helps to transform today’s greatest challenges into collaborative solutions."
