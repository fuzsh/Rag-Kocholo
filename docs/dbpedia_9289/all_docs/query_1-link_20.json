        "text": "MALTA’S CENTER UNTIL the 16th century, the golden-walled city of Mdina, sits on a hill with a view over its thick ramparts and across scrubby plains to Valletta, the current capital, and the glittering sea. My family and I had arrived there — having flown in from London the night before — by public bus from the busy terminal outside Valletta’s gates, along with a few taciturn locals bearing bouquets of flowers, presumably heading to Sunday lunch with relatives in the adjacent modern town of Rabat, and a gaggle of chatty Italians, keen, like ourselves, to visit the so-called “silent city.” And indeed, on this July afternoon, as the black-clad priest and his caretaker padlocked the vast doors of St. Paul’s Cathedral, passed us with their heads bowed and scurried away into the tiny city’s sun-washed maze, the streets were silent except for us, the tourists. The occasional decorated horse clopped by, pulling British or Italians upon a painted cart. Our own footsteps echoed in the silent canyons between cloistered monasteries, convents and private houses, until we rounded a corner into a square near the Carmelite Priory and were suddenly surrounded by young visitors buying trinkets and postcards, taking photographs, swigging, in the heat, from sweating plastic water bottles. A block farther on, all was quiet again. This small, perfect town felt as if I’d dreamed it, a hermetic Mediterranean fantasy, a curious and singular combination of Arab influence and profound Catholicism, the stretching vista of sandy earth and olive trees descending to the impeccable azure sea, punctuated by an occasional British red postbox.\n\nAll my life I’d wanted to visit Malta. My interest stemmed in part from family lore: My French grandfather’s grandfather was a Maltese immigrant to French Algeria, born in 1820 in Rabat, just outside Mdina’s walls; our name, Messud, is a distortion of Mifsud, to this day common in Malta. (I recently, and surprisingly, encountered the name in relation to the Mueller investigation: It was Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese national, who had allegedly offered to put the Trump campaign foreign policy adviser in contact with the Kremlin.) Then, too, I’d been intrigued by the few details passed on to me along with my ancestor’s birth certificate: details of the island’s particular, rich history from prehistoric times to the present. My interest was inevitably writerly: My ancestors crisscrossed the Mediterranean from France, Italy and Spain to Algeria and back to France, thence to Beirut, from Salonica to Istanbul to Morocco. Malta sits like a jewel in the middle of that storied sea, 100 miles south of Sicily and 240 miles northeast of Tunisia.\n\nWe started with Mdina because in Malta, on Sundays, most of the shops are still closed, and we’d been warned by our hotel that Valletta would be dozy. Religion and history are Mdina’s raison d’être, however, and the museums were open. In addition to visiting churches, we stopped at the Palazzo Falson, the former home of a prosperous local artist and collector named Olof Frederick Gollcher (whose Swedish ancestry made him no less passionately Maltese). Here, we could glimpse what lay behind Mdina’s millennium-old walled streets: the elegantly proportioned rooms of a typical townhouse, of course; but also the haven of its essential leafy courtyard, shaded from the midday sun and further calmed by its gently trickling fountain. The museum cafe was closed for renovations, and we ended up instead buying burgers from a stand outside the city walls, beyond the stately but unpeopled Howard Gardens (fashioned from the city’s former moat) in a municipal park of a kind familiar to me from my childhood in Sydney, Australia: It’s a British convention, the manicured open space with a green kiosk selling snacks and a separate structure housing well-kept public loos. Along its rim stood a row of Victorian-era terraced houses, looking for all the world as though they were in Margate or Brighton, each villa bearing a nameplate like “Winchester” or “Windward-ho.” If I hadn’t already known that Malta belonged to Britain for over 150 years, I would have deduced it then — we could only have been in a former British colony.\n\nBUT MALTA IS by no means trapped in its past. Named one of the two European Capitals of Culture for 2018, Valletta has been exhilaratingly revitalized by the architect Renzo Piano’s 2015 reconstruction and re-envisioning of its city gate, parliament building and opera house (badly bombed in World War II). The tourists on the city’s streets and at the island’s beautiful beaches — around 2 million visitors a year — are notably young: The nation is progressive on LGBTQ rights, has a lively party reputation and is justly famous for its scuba diving. In the past few years, it has become a trendy, readily accessible, less overrun alternative to Ibiza or Crete, and one where almost everyone speaks English. But the island has been in the news for darker reasons, too, most recently on Oct. 16, when the Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was assassinated near her home by a car bomb. She had been investigating government corruption in her home country, and in recent years had focused her attention on the infamous Panama Papers, drawing links to those surrounding Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
