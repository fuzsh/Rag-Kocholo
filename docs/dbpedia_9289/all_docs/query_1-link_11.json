        "text": "Explorations of the smallest capital city in Europe, belonging to one of the smallest countries.\n\nGo sky diving. Drive a race car. Take a cruise. Normal bucket list items.\n\nMe: visit every micro-nation in Europe; Vatican City, Monaco, San Marino, Andorra, Liechtenstein, and Malta. Four down, two to go. Weird, I know. (As of 2023, 5 down, 1 to go.)\n\nI’ve wanted to visit Malta for years, basically ever since I learned about this tiny nation. It’s just so tiny.\n\nMalta has a fascinating history, a history that I will be exploring with the next few posts. A bit backwards actually. I saw Malta’s Neolithic temples last but the capital city of Valletta first.\n\nMalta was at the crossroads of the Mediterranean, having been settled back in the Neolithic, then by the seafaring Phoenicians, then conquered by the Romans. The Maltese language stems from the time the islands were ruled by the Arabs. Maltese is the only Semitic language today that uses the Latin alphabet.\n\nEventually the Knights of Malta showed up in 1530 after being kicked out of Rhodes by the Ottomans, after being kicked out of Jerusalem first. Of course back then, they were still known as the Knights Hospitaller, or the Knights of St. John. They first settled in Birgu and then moved their capitol to Valletta in 1571. (They were later kicked out of Valletta by Napoleon and kept out by the British. They are currently in Rome.)\n\nValletta was named after Jean de Vallette, the Grand Master who defeated an Ottoman invasion of Malta. The peninsula where Valletta now sits contained only a lighthouse when the knights showed up. They built Fort St. Elmo, and then, they built their capitol city.\n\nValletta is the smallest capitol city in the European Union, only 0.8 km sq. It’s a tiny tangle of streets, very easy to transverse on foot but surprisingly hilly. Most of the buildings are all made of the local sandstone, but the wooden windows and covered balconies are painted in bright colors. I couldn’t stop taking photos of those Maltese balconies. Different styles can be found in the different towns throughout the island but they sure like them wooden and covered.\n\nBack on track. The biggest attraction in Valletta is St. John’s Co-Cathedral. While originally built in the late 16th century with the rest of Valletta, the inside was redone in the Baroque style in the 17th. And boy, it’s fantastic.\n\nAnother great stop for Maltese history is the Grand Master’s Palace. While Malta was under the rule of the Knights of Malta, the Grandmaster was in charge. He fulfilled the role of the monarch of the day and had state rooms in a palace in the center of Valletta. Today, theses rooms are used for the same functions by the President of Malta. When the rooms aren’t being used for official functions, you can visit them as well. The palace has a fantastic audioguide that guides you through the history of the palace.\n\nValletta, Malta, was just spectacular. I wish I had more than just one day there. I needed more street wandering time, more balcony staring time. I know, I’m weird. However, I did cover a ton of ground in just one day. I visited St. John’s Co-Cathedral, St. Francis of Assisi, the city gate area, Our Lady of Victory, the Upper Barracca Gardens (where the harbor views were), the Grandmaster’s Palace, Manoel Theatre and the National Museum of Archaeology, in one day. Plus, a ton of wandering and ferry rides to and from Sliema. You can seriously cover a ton of ground in the tiny country of Malta.\n\nCheck out my next update where I explore the “Silent City.”"
