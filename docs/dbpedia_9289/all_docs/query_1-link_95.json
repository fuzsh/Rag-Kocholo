        "text": "Reissued after routine periodic review with minor edits pursuant to Department of State standard processes.\n\nDo not travel to Venezuela due to crime, civil unrest, kidnapping, and the arbitrary enforcement of local laws. Reconsider travel due to wrongful detentions, terrorism, and poor health infrastructure.\n\nCountry Summary: In March 2019, the U.S. Department of State withdrew all diplomatic personnel from U.S. Embassy Caracas and suspended operations. All consular services, routine and emergency, remain suspended until further notice. The U.S. government has no ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Venezuela. U.S. citizens in Venezuela who require consular assistance should try to leave the country as soon as safely possible to do so and should contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in another country.\n\nViolent crimes, such as homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking, are common in Venezuela. Political rallies and demonstrations occur, often with little notice. Anti-Maduro demonstrations have elicited a strong police and security force response, including the use of tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets against participants, and occasionally devolve into looting and vandalism. Shortages of gasoline, electricity, water, medicine, and medical supplies continue throughout much of Venezuela.\n\nThe Department has determined there is a high risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals in Venezuela. Security forces have detained U.S. citizens for up to five years. The U.S. government is not generally notified of the detention of U.S. citizens in Venezuela or granted access to U.S. citizen prisoners there.\n\nColombian terrorist groups operate in Venezuela’s border areas with Colombia, Brazil, and Guyana.\n\nRead the country information page for additional information on travel to Venezuela.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Venezuela:\n\nAvoid all land border crossings into Venezuela on the Colombian border.\n\nEnsure you have a valid Venezuelan visa. Visas are not available upon arrival.\n\nBe prepared for the high risk of indefinite detention without consular access.\n\nDraft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.\n\nDevelop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization. Establish a “proof of life” protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).\n\nHave a contingency plan in place that does not rely on U.S. government assistance.\n\nKeep travel documents up to date and easily accessible.\n\nAvoid travel between cities, or between Simón Bolívar International Airport and Caracas at night.\n\nDo not take unregulated taxis from the Maiquetia “Simón Bolívar” International Airport and avoid ATMs in this area.\n\nConsider hiring a professional security organization.\n\nBring a sufficient supply of over the counter and prescription medicines for the duration of travel.\n\nConsider purchasing medical evacuation insurance.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nFollow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nReview the Country Security Report for Venezuela.\n\nVisit the CDC page for the latest Travel Health Information related to your travel.\n\nReview the Traveler’s Checklist.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State strongly recommends U.S. citizens do not travel to Venezuela. If you must travel to Venezuela, we recommend you avoid all land border crossings into Venezuela on the Colombian border. Detentions of U.S. citizens at formal or informal border crossings into Venezuela are common.\n\nTo enter Venezuela, you must have:\n\nA valid U.S. passport in good condition with at least six months of validity, and\n\nA valid Venezuelan visa. Visas are not available upon arrival.\n\nVisas: The Venezuelan embassy and consulates in the United States are not open for visa processing. Contact the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington at 202-342-2214 for updates about the future availability of visa services. You must have the proper visa class and appropriate accreditation before traveling to Venezuela or face refusal of admission, expulsion, or detention.\n\nImmigration officials often require proof of accommodation while in Venezuela, adequate means of support, and an onward departure itinerary. Use only official crossing points when entering Venezuela. You must obtain an entry stamp upon entry.\n\nIf you reside in Venezuela as a non-citizen, you must obtain legitimate Venezuelan residency documentation and renew your residency visa well in advance of expiration. Do not use intermediaries to purchase resident visas and/or work permits.\n\nTraveling with Children: Venezuela’s child protection law mandates that minors (under 18) of any nationality who are traveling alone, with only one parent, or with a third party, must present extensive, specific, and notarized documentation granting permission for travel. Consult the nearest Venezuelan embassy or consulate for further information.\n\nDual Nationality: Venezuelan law requires Venezuelan citizens to enter and depart Venezuela using Venezuelan passports. If you hold dual U.S. and Venezuelan nationality, you must plan to travel between the United States and Venezuela with valid U.S. and Venezuelan passports. Dual-national minors are only allowed to depart Venezuela with both parents present or with a legal authorization signed by the absent parent in a family court.\n\nImmunizations: Visit the CDC Traveler website for vaccination information, including Yellow Fever vaccination requirements. Carry your International Certificate of Vaccination (or yellow card) with you upon arrival or departure.\n\nHIV/AIDS: The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Venezuela. Be aware that HIV/AIDS medications, like other medications, are often not available in Venezuela.\n\nFind further information on dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction, and customs regulations on our websites.\n\nTerrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\n\nHigh-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)\n\nHotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists\n\nPlaces of worship\n\nSchools\n\nParks\n\nShopping malls and markets\n\nPublic transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)\n\nTerrorist groups such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia – People’s Army (FARC-EP), Segunda Marquetalia, and the Colombian-origin National Liberation Army (ELN) have expanded in Venezuela in recent years. We are aware of reports of cooperation between FARC dissidents and the ELN in the areas of road/border checkpoints, forced displacement of communities, and narcotics trafficking.\n\nFor more information, see our Terrorism page.\n\nCrime: Violent crime is pervasive throughout Venezuela. Venezuela has one of the highest homicide rates in the world, and kidnappings are a serious concern. Be alert of your surroundings at all times and take personal security precautions to avoid becoming a victim of crime. Maintain a low profile, travel in groups of five or more, and provide family or friends with your itineraries prior to departure.\n\nAvoid police activity. Corruption within the police forces is a concern, and criminals may be posing as police officers or National Guard members. National Guard members may target U.S. citizens, especially at remote land border crossings, for bribery, extortion, or detention, possibly in collusion with criminal organizations.\n\nCriminal gangs operate openly and with little repercussion, often setting up fake police checkpoints. Armed robberies, including with grenades and assault rifles, take place throughout the country, including in tourist areas and institutions such as banks and ATMs, national parks, shopping malls, public transportation stations, and universities.\n\nDrugs: Do not attempt to bring any narcotics or controlled substances into Venezuela, or substances that may be confused with illegal drugs. Do not accept packages from anyone and always keep your luggage with you. U.S. citizens have been actively recruited to act as narcotics couriers or “drug mules.” Arrestees can expect extended jail terms under extremely difficult prison conditions.\n\nTransportation: Do not use any taxis hailed on the street. Some taxi drivers in Caracas are known to overcharge, rob, injure, and even kidnap passengers. Use only radio-dispatched taxis from taxi services, hotels, restaurants, and airline staff. Do not use public transportation such as city buses and the metro (subway) in Caracas. If you drive, be aware of attacks in tunnels and avoid obstacles in the road.\n\nMaiquetía International Airport: Only travel to and from Maiquetía International Airport near Caracas in daylight hours. Kidnappings, robberies at gunpoint, thefts, and muggings are common. Do not pack valuable items or documents in checked luggage. Individuals wearing seemingly official uniforms and displaying airport or police credentials have been involved in crimes inside the airport, including extortion and robberies. Make advance plans for transportation from the airport to your hotel or destination using a trusted party or dispatch taxi service.\n\nATMs: Most ATMs do not accept U.S. debit or credit cards, and malfunctions are common. Use only those located in well-lit, public places. ATM data is often hacked and used to make unauthorized withdrawals. Criminals target ATM users for robberies. Many ATMs do not have cash.\n\nDemonstrations occur occasionally. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.\n\nDemonstrations can be unpredictable; avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.\n\nPast demonstrations have turned violent.\n\nCheck local media for updates and traffic advisories.\n\nInternational Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.\n\nInternet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Venezuela. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:\n\nRomance/online dating\n\nMoney transfers\n\nGrandparent/relative targeting\n\nVictims of Crime: The U.S. government has extremely limited means of providing consular services to U.S. citizen crime victims in Venezuela. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Bogota. Report crimes to the local police at 171, and contact the U.S. Embassy in Bogota by emailing ACSBogota@state.gov or dialing +57 (1) 275-2000 or +57 (1) 275-4021 after hours. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\n\nSee our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crimes overseas.\n\nWe can:\n\nHelp you find appropriate medical care\n\nContact relatives or friends with your written consent\n\nProvide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion\n\nProvide a list of local attorneys\n\nProvide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.\n\nHelp you find accommodation and arrange flights home\n\nIf you are able to travel to a U.S. Embassy, we can replace a stolen or lost passport and provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution\n\nDomestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Bogota for assistance.\n\nColombian Border: The area within a 50-mile radius along the entire Venezuela and Colombian border is extremely dangerous. U.S. citizens near the border are at risk of detention by Maduro regime authorities. U.S. citizens must obtain a visa to enter Venezuela legally. Visas are not available upon arrival. U.S. citizens attempting to enter Venezuela without a visa have been charged with terrorism and other serious crimes and detained for long periods. The Maduro regime does not notify the U.S. government of the detention of U.S. citizens and the U.S. government is not granted access to those citizens. Additionally, cross-border violence, kidnapping, drug trafficking, and smuggling are common. Some kidnapping victims are released after ransom payments, while others are murdered. Do not attempt to cross the land border.\n\nTourism: No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place on any level. Tourists participate in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Serious medical issues require costly medical evacuation complicated by restrictions on air travel to and from Venezuela. Air evacuations to the United States from Venezuela may not be possible.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. Application of local laws can at times be arbitrary and/or politically motivated.\n\nIn Venezuela, it is illegal to take pictures of sensitive buildings, including the presidential palace, military bases, government buildings, and airports.\n\nDrug trafficking is a serious problem in Venezuela and treated as such by Venezuelan authorities. Convicted traffickers receive lengthy prison sentences.\n\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, attempt to have someone notify the U.S. Embassy in Bogota immediately. See our webpage for further information.\n\nPlease note that the U.S. Department of State may not be informed of your detention, particularly if you also hold Venezuelan citizenship. Due to the suspension of operations of the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, consular visits to detained U.S. citizens are not possible. There have been instances of U.S. citizens in recent years who have been detained without being afforded due process or fair trial guarantees, or as a pretext for an illegitimate purpose, often due to their U.S. citizenship.\n\nCurrency and Exchange: Venezuela has started to allow dollarized commercial transactions and shopping, but policies and availability are subject to change. Some local businesses accept U.S. credit cards and electronic transfers through certain online vendors. “Black market” currency exchanges – often offering significantly favorable exchange rates – are technically prohibited under Venezuelan foreign exchange controls. Violators may be detained by Venezuelan authorities and face criminal penalties.\n\nWire Transfers: Wire transfers cannot be used reliably as a source of emergency funds, and receipt of funds is generally restricted to Venezuelan citizens and residents.\n\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report – see country reports\n\nHuman Rights Report – see country reports\n\nHajj Fact Sheet for Travelers\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nLGBTQI+ Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTIQ+ events in Venezuela.\n\nSee our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details.\n\nTravelers with Disabilities: The law in Venezuela prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Accessibility is more prevalent in the capital city of Caracas than in the rest of the country.\n\nThe availability of rental, repair, and replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices as well as service providers, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants, is limited.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nWomen Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers."
