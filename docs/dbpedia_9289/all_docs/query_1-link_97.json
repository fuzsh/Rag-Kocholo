        "text": "Malta\n\nThis was our first visit to Malta, a country we knew little about, especially given how much there is to know! This post contains much more text that normal, as we found the rich history of Malta so fascinating.\n\nMalta’s location in the middle of the Mediterranean has historically given it great strategic importance as a naval base, and a succession of powers, including the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans, Sicilians, Spanish, Knights of St. John, French, and British have ruled the islands.\n\nMalta gained its political Independence from Britain on September 21, 1964 as an independent constitutional monarchy, with Elizabeth II as Queen of Malta and Head of State. Elizabeth II remained the head of state of Malta until the amendment of the Constitution of Malta on December 13, 1974, which abolished the monarchy and established the Republic of Malta and the office of President of Malta. Interestingly, the President of Malta must hold or have held the office of Chief Justice or other Judge of the Superior Courts.\n\nThe country has some of the world’s most ancient standing buildings (the Neolithic temples), dating to 3600 B.C. It was also a very strategic base for the Allies during World War II.\n\nMalta became what it became because of the Knights of St. John, otherwise known as the Knights of Hospitaller, the Knights of Malta or the Order of St. John, who arrived to what is now Malta in the 1500s. We found the story fascinating; well worth a read here, or at least, watching this 3-minute video. The short version is this:\n\nThe Knights of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem were formed long before their reign on Malta. The Order was originally established in 1085 as a community of monks responsible for looking after the sick at the Hospital of St. John in Jerusalem. They later became a military order, defending crusader territory in the Holy Lands and safeguarding the perilous routes taken by medieval pilgrims. The Knights were drawn exclusively from noble families and the Order acquired vast wealth from those it recruited.\n\nThe Knights came to Malta in 1530, having been ejected from their earlier home on Rhodes by the Turks in 1522. Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, gave them the choice of Malta or Tripoli as a new base. Neither was to their liking, but nothing, they thought, could be worse than Tripoli.\n\nHaving chosen Malta, the Knights stayed for 268 years, transforming what they called ‘merely a rock of soft sandstone’ into a flourishing island with mighty defences and a capital city coveted by the great powers of Europe.\n\nAnd one last bit of history… the Maltese falcon. In 1530, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, as King of Sicily, ceded to the Order the island of Malta. At first, the Order’s Maltese dominion, which also included the nearby islands of Gozo and Comino was considered a fief of the Kingdom of Sicily, its Grand Master a vassal. It was for this reason that an annual feudal tax was paid, though it was largely symbolic. It included, annually, a “Maltese falcon.” Thus did the Order become known as the “Order of Malta.”\n\nWhy a Maltese falcon? Maltese falcons were already very famous, in part due to the treatise on falconry written in 1241 in Latin by Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, Holy Roman Emperor (1196-1250), among which titles is King of Sicily, at a time when Malta was a fief of the Kingdom of Sicily. So, Maltese falcons had long been very desirable, and given the popularity of falconry among the royals of Europe at the time, to be gifted a Maltese falcon is a sign of honor.\n\nTechnically, the grant was given by Charles V not as King of Spain — “Spain” didn’t exist yet — but as co-King of Aragon, of which Sicily was a fiefdom, of which Malta was part of. At the time of the grant, Charles V was jointly ruling Aragon with his mother Joanna, even if she was not an active ruler. So the falcon was paid not to the King of Spain, but to the Viceroy of Sicily.\n\nFurther, Charles V didn’t “give” Malta to the Knights, he rented it to them, under feudal contract. This is why the text of the grant specified what should happen in case of succession of the grand master, who should assign the bishop of Malta (the viceroy of Sicily, not the knights), how Malta should not engage in activities against Sicily, etc.\n\nEven today you can order a copy of the book, “The Art of Falconry”…. luckily translated in case your Latin is rusty."
