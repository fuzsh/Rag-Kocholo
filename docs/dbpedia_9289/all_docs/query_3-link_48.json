        "text": "The City of Valletta has been a UNESCO World heritage Site since 1980. It is fairly unusual in that the whole city (polulation ~ 6,000) has been included as a World Heritage Site. The UNESCO website explains that “Auberge de Castille, sits at the highest point in the heart of Valletta near the Upper Barrakka Gardens and the Barrakka Lift and, since 1972, houses the Office of the Prime Minster of Malta; it was built in the 1740s.”\n\n“Built in 1861, due the increasing popularity of opera on the Maltese Islands, the majestic Royal Opera House was designed by the English artist, Edward Middleton Barry. As resilient as it is beautiful, this superb performance venue suffered two devastating blows. The first, a fire in 1879 which destroyed its interior and resulted in its being rebuilt, the second, severe bombardment during World War ll, after which very little remained. Reconstructed in the twenty-first century, the magnificent Pjazza Teatru Rjal opened its doors to the public in 2013, and has been a musical hotspot ever since. A truly magical experience, a performance at this stunning theatre is strongly recommended!” — https://www.visitmalta.com/pl/attraction/pjazza-teatru-rjal-malta/\n\n“Malta’s capital Valletta is a fortified city located on a hilly peninsula between two of the finest natural harbours in the Mediterranean. The Siege of Malta in 1565 captured the European imagination and mobilised the resources needed to create the new city of Valletta, founded soon after, in 1566. The Knights of St John, aided by the most respected European military engineers of the 16th century, conceived and planned the city as a single, holistic creation of the late Renaissance, with a uniform grid plan within fortified and bastioned city walls. Since its creation, the city has witnessed a number of rebuilding projects, yet those have not compromised the harmony between the dramatic topography and the Hippodamian grid. The fabric of the city includes a compact ensemble of 320 monuments that encapsulate every aspect of the civil, religious, artistic and military functions of its illustrious founders. These include the 16th century buildings relating to the founding of the Renaissance city, such as the cathedral of St John, the Palace of the Grand Master, the Auberge de Castile et Léon, the Auberge de Provence, the Auberge d’Italie, the Auberge d’Aragon and the Infirmary of the Order and the churches of Our Lady of Victory, St Catherine and il Gesù, as well as the improvements attributed to the military engineers and architects of the 18th century such as the Auberge de Bavière, the Church of the Shipwreck of St Paul, the Library and the Manoel Theatre.” — https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/131/\n\n“The beautiful and impressive St John’s Co-Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral in the heart of Valletta dedicated to Saint John the Baptist… It was built between 1572 and 1577 by the Knights of Malta at the request of Grand Master Jean de la Cassière to act as the Conventual Church of Saint John. Its design is a prime example of Baroque architecture and as an attraction is a must-visit on a trip to Malta! Several artistic pieces of great value enrich the co-cathedral, with paintings from the great Caravaggio to works of art donated as gifts by past Grand Masters and Knights of the Order of St. John.\n\n“The building itself was designed by renowned Maltese architect Girolamo Cassar, who is also credited to have designed the Grandmaster’s Palace as well as the original design for the Knights’ hospital, La Sacra Infermeria. In the 17th century, Mattia Preti and other able artists gave the cathedral’s interior the Baroque imprint. Over the centuries several gifts and inheritances left by the various Knights further embellished the cathedral to become a true jewel.\n\n“St. John’s Co-Cathedral retained its title as the conventual church of the Order until the Knights left Malta with the French occupation in 1798. It is called a Co-cathedral since it shares the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Malta together with the older Cathedral of Saint Paul in Mdina. The Co-Cathedral is home to priceless works of art, including the Beheading of St. John, an internationally recognised masterpiece by Caravaggio. The interior of the church is considered to be one of the finest examples of high Baroque architecture in Europe. The cathedral contains nine richly decorated chapels on its two sides. Eight were made for each of the langues (or branches) of the Order of the Knights, while the ninth was built in honour of Our Lady of Philermos, the patron saint of the Order. The cathedral has three clocks on one of its towers. A second and third clock indicates the current day and week.” — http://www.maltauncovered.com\n\n“Auberge d’Italie was also called Berġa tal-Italja when it was built at the end of the 16th century. It was a hostel for the Italian langue of the Knights from the Order of Saint John who were responsible for guarding the Bastions of St. Peter and Paul. Th[e] ornate relief above the front door was installed during an enlargement in 1683. The design by La Fe’ included a coat of arms, the Trophy of the Arms and a statue of Grandmaster Gregorio Carafa which is now missing. Subsequently the building was the military headquarters for the French and later the British. [For 15 years, through 2017 it] house[d] the Ministry of Tourism and include[d] a tourist information office.” — https://www.encirclephotos.com/image/auberge-ditalie-ornate-sculpture-in-valletta-malta/\n\n“It is now converted to host the national collection (previously at national Museum of Fine Arts). In 2018 it became the new National Community Art Museum, MUZA (from the Maltese acronym Mużew Nazzjonali tal-Arti).” –- Wikipedia\n\n“The city is pre-eminently an ideal creation of the late Renaissance with its uniform urban plan, inspired by neo-platonic principles, its fortified and bastioned walls modelled around the natural site and the voluntary implantation of great monuments in well-chosen locations… The city is irrevocably affiliated with the history of the military and charitable Order of the Knights of St John of Jerusalem, which founded the city in 1566 and maintained it throughout two and a half centuries. Valletta is thus associated with the history of one of the greatest military and moral forces of modern Europe.” — https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/131/\n\n“The Upper Barrakka Gardens is a popular, yet quiet location on the southern side of Valletta, with magnificent views over Grand Harbour. It’s a great stop for a quick coffee and snack at its quaint kiosk and terrace. You can also enter Valletta from down at the harbour using the Upper Barrakka Lift and it’s a good place to be at noon and 4 pm sharp daily for the firing of the guns at the Saluting Battery down below.” — https://www.maltauncovered.com/valletta-capital-city/"
