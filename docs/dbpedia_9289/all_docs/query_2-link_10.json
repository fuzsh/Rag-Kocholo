        "text": "Valletta, a UNESCO world heritage site, is nothing short of an open air museum. This capital city is the brainchild of Grandmaster Jean de la Valette, who wanted a fortified city to protect the island from Turkish invasion. The architect Francesco Laparelli, who was Michelangelo’s assistant, was sent to Malta by the Pope to design this fortified city atop Mount Sciberras– a barren peninsula between two natural harbors. Fort St. Elmo and Fort Ricasoli protect the entrance to the harbor with bastion walls. Fort St. Angelo and the bastion walls of Birgu and Senglea shield its flanks.\n\nValletta is one the first cities in Europe to be developed entirely by plan and on a rectangular parallel grid, allowing the sea breezes to cool the summer heat.\n\nTowards the end of 1568, a Maltese architect Girolamo Cassar took charge of designing and building many of the buildings in the city.\n\nThe beautiful baroque style St. John co-cathedral designed by Girolamo Cassar 1573-1578. This cathedral also has one of the largest Caravaggio paintings in the world.\n\nThe Auberge de Castille was designed by Girolamo Cassar in 1570,due to lack of funding it was not completed until 1745 under Grandmaster Pinto. It now houses the offices of the Maltese Prime Minster.\n\nThis is the fifth entrance of Valletta since 1566 designed by the internationally recognized Italian architect Renzo Piano who also designed the Whitney Museum in New York City.\n\nTypical streets in Valletta, houses adorned with wooden balconies called “gallarija”. Yellow limestone gleaming in the summer sun.\n\nSacra Infermeria is now the Mediterranean conference center. Built by the Knights of Malta in 1574, this was one of the first hospitals in Europe. This building was also designed by Girolamo Cassar.\n\nValletta is full of history, art and culture. This is just a small sample of what you can see in this city, no wonder it has been designated as the European Capital of Culture 2018!"
