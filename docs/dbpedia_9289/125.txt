Valletta, the capital of Malta, was founded in 1566 by Grand Master Jean Parisot de la Valette, after the victory of the Knights of the Order of St. John over the Ottoman Empire in the Great Siege of Malta in 1565.

Valletta was erected on the Sciberras Peninsula, a site that dominated the two main harbors of Malta: the Grand Harbour and the Marsamxett Harbour. This ensured the defense of maritime routes and offered a clear view of potential threats.

The city was initially conceived as a fortification to protect the island against future Ottoman attacks. Its design was the work of military engineer Francesco Laparelli, who proposed an urban plan based on a grid, something revolutionary for the time.

Under the rule of the Knights of the Order of St. John, Valletta became a cultural and administrative center. The inns or auberges housed the knights, while the Grand Master’s Palace functioned as the seat of government. St. John’s Co-Cathedral, with its opulent decoration and art collection, including the famous painting by Caravaggio, symbolized the religious power of the order.

Valletta fell into French hands in 1798 when Napoleon Bonaparte captured it on his way to Egypt. However, his rule was brief, as the Maltese, supported by the British, rebelled. In 1800, the British established their control, turning Malta into a military bastion. Valletta transformed into a vital port for the British Empire during the 19th century, consolidating itself as a key base for naval operations in the Mediterranean.

The strategic importance of Valletta made it a key target during World War II. Between 1940 and 1942, Valletta and the rest of Malta endured a constant siege. German Luftwaffe and Italian Regia Aeronautica planes relentlessly bombed the city. There were more than 3,000 air raids on Malta during this period, which destroyed much of Valletta, including the historic Royal Theatre.

Malta was an outpost of the British Empire, and its port in Valletta became a vital base for the Royal Navy. From there, the British could disrupt Axis supply lines, especially fuel and supplies shipments to German and Italian forces in North Africa.

The population resisted bravely, and for their resilience, King George VI awarded the George Cross to the island in 1942. Malta was the only region to receive this high decoration, symbolizing the courage and unity of the nation. The Cross still represents the Maltese spirit and appears today on the national flag.
