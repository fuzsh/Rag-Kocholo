        "text": "INTEGRATING REWILDING INTO THE VOLUNTARY CARBON MARKET Joust found this insightful article by Nick Atkinson FLS, chief science officer at BeZero Carbon, who argues that #rewilding can avoid many of the practical difficulties associated with monitoring, reporting and verification, with the potential to integrate biodiversity into the voluntary carbon market (VCM). The carbon ratings agency BeZero Carbon explores some of the options to address the fact that rewilding projects are relative rare in the VCM, despite the apparent alignment of climate and nature objectives. üëâüèª https://lnkd.in/eUqw2SyA Improved scientific understanding of the capacity of natural landscapes to sequester and store carbon increasingly points to the role of non-woodland ecosystems. Grasslands can store great quantities of soil carbon, rewetted peatlands stop leaking carbon as they regain function, and coastal habitats such as saltmarshes and seagrass meadows have some of the most carbon-rich substrates on the planet. Here, though, the methodologies required to enable the registration of carbon projects, and the issuance of ex ante credits that provide the vital project finance, are lagging behind. As the economic outlook for agriculture, particularly in marginal land, shifts in places such as Europe, there is an opportunity to restore and integrate nature in ways that protect biodiversity and provide both climate abatement and mitigation solutions through #rewilding. Measuring #biodiversity is a significant challenge, making it difficult and/or expensive to demonstrate progress towards traditional conservation objectives. This is one of the reasons why markets for biodiversity credits are struggling to take hold. By shifting the focus towards restoration of ecological function instead, rewilding approaches have the potential to avoid many of the practical difficulties associated with monitoring, reporting and verification. #RestoreNature #WilderEurope #ScalingUpRewilding #RewildingAction Image Staffan Widstrand/Rewilding Europe Letea forest, Danube Delta, Romania üá∑üá¥\n\nInvitation to contribute to our special issue \"Implications of the new environmental agendas for Land Use Policy\" in the journal Land Use Policy (Elsevier) Environmental agendas such as Green Deal, carbon and biodiversity, sustainable agriculture and bioeconomy policies are high in policy agendas throughout the world. However, it is unknown how this might influence the dynamics of landscape change and land use policy. With this special issue we want to address the following questions: - How the environmental agendas from 2020 onwards are shaping land use policy and changing landscapes across the world? - How can we monitor and assess the pathways for transformative changes towards sustainability transition? This special issue analyses and discusses the nature, type, outreach, underlined processes and impacts in different sectors of activity, including energy, food fibre and timber production, tourism etc. Guest editors: Sonia Ribeiro (UFMG Universidade Federal Minas Gerais, Brazil), Isabel Loupa-Ramos (Tecnico, Tecnico Lisboa), Teresa Pinto Correia (Universidade de √âvora), Werner Rolf (Technical University of Munich), Britaldo Soares Filho (UFMG Universidade Federal Minas Gerais, Brazil) Feel free to distribute #GreenDeal #LandUse #LandscapeEcology #AcademicWriting Manuscript submission deadline: December 31, 2023 Read full call:"
