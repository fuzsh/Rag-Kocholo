        "text": "IN the late spring of 1944, Allied forces were grouping in the south of England for D‐Day. Cassino had just fallen and the road to Rome was open. The Russians had broken out of the Ukraine and the Crimea and were rolling ever faster toward the German border. And in Berlin, in his office at the War Ministry, a tall, thin, dark‐haired colonel, with one sleeve of his uniform neatly pinned up to cover his missing left arm and with a black patch over his useless left eye, practiced again and again to manipulate a pair of tongs with the three remaining fingers of his one hand so as to crush a tiny glass vial.\n\nHis name was Count Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg, and he was rehearsing the pro cedure for activating a time bomb with which he intended to kill Adolf Hitler. Stauffen berg was the key man in what has come to be known as the Generals’ Plot. For a group with the German Army General Staff's reputation for efficiency, it was an incredibly blundered affair.\n\nA handful of German officers had been considering an anti‑\n\nHitler putsch — off and on — ever since the Munich crisis. Their leader was old Col. Gen. Ludwig Beck, who had lost his job as chief of staff in 1938 for calling Hitler's military schemes impractical. When the war began to go badly, more and more officers joined in. Some worried about violating the loyalty oath they all had taken, but decided they could get around that stumbling block if somebody else did something about Hitler first— like, preferably, arresting him. As Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt said to Field Marshal Erwin Rommel: “You do it. You’re younger than I am.”\n\nAT the same time, various civilian groups, ranging from “romantic reactionaries” to Rousseauan Socialists, were sounded out on what form the new regime should take. There was much talk over tea tables and at country estates, but little agreement and less action.\n\nNot that there was no action. On the Russian front, a number of young officers had decided there was nothing for it but to kill Hitler as soon as possible. Maj. Gen. Henning Tresckow and his aide, Fabian von Schlabrendorf, a lawyer in civilian life, undertook the job. Their first attempt came in March, 1943. Their weapon was\n\na bomb of the same type that Stauffenberg was to use.\n\nIt was British‐built, one of hundreds parachuted in for saboteurs. The Czechs had used one to kill the Gauleiter Heydrich, whose death the Nazis avenged by the destruction of Lidice. The conspirators got theirs from friends in the Abwehr, the military intelligence service. Its advantage over any German bomb was that it was absolutely silent. It contained a vial of acid. When the glass was broken, the acid began to eat through a taut wire; when the wire was eaten through, it released a firing pin which struck a percussion cap, setting off the bomb. The thickness of the wire determined the timing.\n\nTresckow and Schlabrendorf chose a day when Hitler paid a flying visit to their headquarters. They asked one of the Führer's adjutants, a Col. Heinz Brandt, to carry back on the plane a present of two bottles of brandy for a mutual friend. The package contained the bomb, set to explode 30 minutes after take‐off. Nothing happened. Two hours later, word came that the plane had landed routinely in Berlin.\n\nCoolly, Tresckow called Brandt and asked whether he had yet delivered the brandy. Brandt said no. Good, said Tresckow, the wrong bottles had been wrapped by mistake; Schlabrendorf would be in Berlin on routine business next day with the proper ones and exchange them. Schlabrendorf did. When he unwrapped the bomb package he found the percussion cap had been defective.\n\nNow it was Stauffenberg's turn. He was 36, aristocratic (a great‐grandson of Field Marshal Count August Neithardt von Gneisenau, hero of the Napoleonic wars), devoutly Roman Catholic and poetic (admiring the misty works of Stefan George). He had been enlisted in the conspiracy by Tresckow and Schlabrendorf while serving on the Russian front. He had been maimed at the Kasserine Pass when his car drove into a minefield. From his hospital bed he told his wife: “I feel I must do something now to save Germany. We General Staff officers must all accept our share of the responsibility.”\n\nStauffenberg's first move was to get himself posted as chief of staff to Gen. Friedrich Olbricht, a co‐conspirator and deputy to Gen. Friedrich Fromm, commander of the Ersatzheer, or Reserve Army. The job gave Stauffenberg rea‑\n\nTwenty years ago, ‘the Generals’ Plot’ almost changed the course of history. son to attend an occasional briefing in Hitler's presence.\n\nThe Reserve Army consisted of half‐trained youngsters and over‐age garrison troops, but it was important to the conspirators for two reasons. It could fight the party's SS (Elite Guard) troops when the moment came to seize the capital. And it gave the conspirators an opportunity to send sealed orders—supposedly containing home‐defense plans —to all military‐district commanders. The envelopes were to be opened only upon receipt of the code word “Valkyrie.” What they actually contained was an announcement that Hitler was dead, and orders to arrest SS and other Nazi units and to obey the new regime. The assumption was that even those generals not in the plot would obey orders unquestioningly — as they had been taught.\n\nAS spring wore on into summer and the military situation worsened, the circle of conspirators grew dangerously large. There were hints that unless Stauffenberg acted quickly the Gestapo might nab them all. Anyway, unless he acted quickly it seemed there might be no Germany left for him to save.\n\nOn July 11, he was ordered to attend a briefing at Berch tesgaden. He took his bomb with him in his briefcase; he carried it back to Berlin. Hitler and Goring had been there, but not Himmler, and the plan was to get all three of the top Nazis.\n\nFIVE days later, Stauffen‑ berg was ordered to another briefing at the Fiihrer's head‑ quarters. Again he took along his bomb. This time Hitler failed to show up.\n\n“A horse that refuses a jump twice is not likely to go over a third time,” grumbled Gen‑ eral Beck. But Stauffenberg was determined not to fail again. On July 20 he was to report to Hitler at his East Prussian headquarters, the Wolfschanze (Wolf's Lair) . The night before, Stauffenberg worked late at the War Minis‑ try, then stopped by a church to pray.\n\nTwo bits of bad news were waiting for him when his plane landed at the Wolfschanze field. Göring and Himmler would not be present. And the scene of the day's briefing had been changed from the usual underground air - raid shelter to a wooden barracks, where the blast would be less effec‑ tive. No matter. Stauffenberg groped inside his briefcase and broke the vial of acid. The time was 12:32. The bomb was set for 10 minutes.\n\nThe briefing had begun when Stauffenberg entered. Some two dozen officers stood around a heavy oak table, covered with maps, where Hitler sat toying with a reading glass. It was an oddly constructed table, supported by two massive pedestals instead of legs. Gen. Adolf Heusinger was reporting on the latest Russian advances. Stauffenberg propped his briefcase under the table, about six feet from Hitler. The time was 12:37.\n\nMinutes later, Stauffenberg was summoned to an outer office to take a telephone call —carefully timed. (He had volunteered to stay with the bomb, but the conspirators considered him too valuable to lose.) He kept going until he reached his car, several hundred yards away.\n\nWITHIN the briefing room, Heusinger went on with his report. One of the men who leaned over to get a better view of the maps on the table was Col. Heinz Brandt—the same Colonel Brandt who had carried those supposed brandy bottles to Berlin. He felt something in the way of his foot; it was Stauffenberg's briefcase. Brandt reached down and moved it out of his way, a few inches farther from Hitler, to just the other side of the heavy oak pedestal.\n\n“If our army group around Lake Peipus is not immediately withdrawn,” Heusinger was saying, “a catastrophe . .” The time was 12:42.\n\n“I remember it as thunder . . . with a bright yellow flame and thick smoke,” recalled one of the survivors. “Glass and wood splinters shot through the air. The large table . . . collapsed.”\n\nThere was a seemingly interminable silence. Then Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel spoke. His words on that crucial occasion: “Where is the Führer ?”\n\nOutside, Stauffenberg watched. It looked, he said, as if a 155-millimeter shell had hit the barracks, and he was sure no one could have survived. Watching with Stauffenberg was Gen. Erich Fellgiebel, chief of communications at the Wolfschanze. His role was to telephone the conspirators in Berlin that Hitler was dead, and then to seal off all communications from the base until the coup was complete.\n\nTHE moment the bomb went off, all was confusion. Stauffen berg climbed into his staff car. bluffed his way through three check points, and took off in his waiting plane for Berlin. Fellgiebel made his call. He failed to shut off all subse quent calls ( just why will never be known; he was shot that evening without having talked), but his all‐important message to the plotters wait ing at the War Ministry got through.\n\nOne trouble was that none of them quite understood it. Had the bomb really gone off ? they asked one another. Was Hitler really dead?\n\nFurthermore, not very many of them had bothered to show up. General Olbricht had drifted in about noon, and so had Erich Hoepner, a former general who had been cashiered by Hitler with orders never to wear his uniform again. He brought a uniform along, in an overnight bag. just in case he should be released from his oath of fidelity to the Führer and have a chance to put it on. The two of them went out to lunch, and toasted Stauffenberg's success with a half‐bottle of wine.\n\nStauffenberg flew back under radio silence—because of the\n\nprevalence of Soviet fighter planes. It was 3.45 before he landed and could telephone from the airport; still nothing had been done. General Beck, the new head of state, and Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben, the new Commander in Chief of the Wehrmacht, had not yet appeared. The Valkyrie orders had not been issued. Everyone was waiting for Stauffenberg to tell them what to do. He told them: Issue the Valkyrie orders. But, fast as he might drive, he could not get to the War Ministry before 4:30.\n\nHitler, of course, was not dead. He was cut, bruised and scorched; he had lost most of his trousers; his right arm was paralyzed and his eardrums were punctured—but he was alive. Brandt, who probably had saved Hitler's life by moving the briefcase, was fatally wounded, as were two other officers; a stenographer was killed outright. The SS had quickly decided that Stauffenberg must have planted the bomb and ordered his arrest when he landed in Berlin. That call never got through.\n\nNOW, as Stauffenberg drove in from the airport, Hit ler was keeping an appoint ment at the railroad station near his headquarters. His visitor was Mussolini. They inspected the bombsite, and then went off to tea. Hitler sat si lently brooding, while those of his chieftains who were present began quarreling among themselves. Ribbentrop, the Foreign Minister, demanded that he be addressed as von Ribbentrop. “Shut your damned mouth,” said Göring, and threatened to hit him with his marshal's baton. Mussolini was shocked. Hitler leaped up, foaming at the mouth, and shrieked that his escape showed Providence had chosen him to shape the world's destiny.\n\nBack in Berlin, the coup was going badly. The Valkyrie orders were at last sent, and General Beck appeared on the scene. But by the time the conspirators began ordering out troops and tanks to seize key positions, enough telephone calls had leaked through from Hitler's headquarters to convince many unit commanders that he was indeed still alive. General Fromm refused to cooperate, so the conspirators arrested him and locked him up—in a suite with a back door. He had no trouble sending for help.\n\nWHEN Field Marshal von Witzleben, the General Long‐street of the affair, finally arrived at the War Ministry about 8 o’clock, to take up his duties as the new Commander in Chief, he sensed at once that all was lost. Pausing only to tell Beck and Stauffenberg that it was all their fault, he drove off to his country estate.\n\nAt 10:30, a half‐dozen or so junior officers who had been waiting to see which way the cat would jump, stormed into Olbricht's office waving sub‑machine guns. Stauffenberg walked in, was seized and tried to break away. There was a burst of shots, and Stauffenberg was wounded in his remaining arm.\n\nThe machine gunners herded Stauffenberg, Olbricht, Beck and three other conspirators into Fromm's office. Fromm appeared, and announced that they were now under arrest. “I will draw the consequences from this unhappy situation. myself,” said Beck, reaching for his revolver. “At this moment it is the old days that I recall .”\n\nNONE of the July 20 leaders escaped. A few men on the edges of the conspiracy survived, however. One was Gen. Hans Speidel, Rommel's chief of staff. He was held by the Gestapo for seven months—without cracking. When the new German Army was organized under NATO he became commander of Allied ground forces in Central Europe, a post he held from 1957 until his retirement this spring.\n\nAnother who survived was Schlabrendorf, the co‐conspir ator in the brandy‐bottles epi sode. He was brought before Judge Freisler, but just as the trial began an Allied bomb crashed through the courtroom ceiling, killed Freisler and destroyed all the records in the case. Schlabrendorf was still in prison—a man without a dossier—when the American Army rescued him. After the war, he wrote a book about the plot and returned to his law practice.\n\nThere are no public memorials or statues to any of the conspirators."
