This type combines the principled, reform-oriented nature of a Type 1 with the helpful, sacrificial tendencies of a Type 2. Von Witzleben demonstrates a strong sense of duty and moral conviction, indicative of the Type 1's desire for integrity and justice. His commitment to bettering the situation in Germany and opposing the Nazi regime reflects the Type 1’s focus on improvement and ethical standards. He is driven by an inner critic that motivates him to uphold his principles, which often leads to a desire for order and accountability in a chaotic context. The influence of the 2 wing manifests in Witzleben's desire to support others in their fight against tyranny. He exhibits qualities of warmth and a willingness to be of service to those who share his goals, showcasing the Type 2’s nurturing and interpersonal nature. His leadership style likely involves a balancing act of asserting his own standards while also encouraging and rallying his allies, reflecting a deep concern for the collective welfare. Overall, Witzleben's blend of principled leadership and a service-minded approach highlights the strength of a 1w2 , characterized by an unwavering commitment to righteousness paired with a genuine desire to help others, ultimately positioning him as a formidable figure in the struggle against oppression."
