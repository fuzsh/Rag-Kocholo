Erwin von Witzleben was put to death that same day at Plötzensee Prison in Berlin. By Hitler’s positive orders, he was strangled with piano wire that had been wound around a meat hook, and the execution was filmed. Through von Witzleben, Voss was connected to the Oberst der Kavallerie, Claus Graf Schenk von Stauffenberg‘s resistance group.
