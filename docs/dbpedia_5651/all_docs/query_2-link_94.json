Excerpt: World War II North African Campaign Battle of Normandy (1944)Erwin Johannes Eugen Rommel (Â )) (15 November 1891 14 October 1944), popularly known as the Desert Fox (WÃ¼stenfuchs, Â )), was a famous German Field Marshal of World War II. He is regarded as one of the greatest generals in military history. He was a highly decorated officer in World War I, and was awarded the Pour le MÃ rite for his exploits on the Italian front. In World War II, he further distinguished himself as the commander of the 7th Panzer Division during the 1940 invasion of France. However, it was his leadership of German and Italian forces in the North African campaign that established the legend of the Desert Fox. He is considered to have been one of the most skilled commanders of desert warfare in the war. He later commanded the German forces opposing the Allied cross-channel invasion in Normandy. As one of the few generals who consistently fought the Western Allies (he was never assigned to the Eastern Front), Rommel is regarded as having been a humane and professional officer. His Afrikakorps was never accused of war crimes. Soldiers captured during his Africa campaign were reported to have been treated humanely. Furthermore, he ignored orders to kill captured commandos, Jewish soldiers and civilians in all theaters of his command. Late in the war, Rommel was linked to the conspiracy to kill Adolf Hitler. Due to his wide renown, Hitler chose to eliminate him quietly; in trade for the protection of his family, Rommel agreed to commit suicide. Rommel was born on 15 November 1891 in Heidenheim, 45 kilometres (28 mi) from Ulm, in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg (then part of the German Empire). He was baptised on 17 November 1891. He was the second child of the Protestant headmaster of the secondary school at Aalen, Professor Erwin Rommel Senior (1860 1913), and Helene von Luz, who had two other sons and a daughter. Rommel wrote that 'my early years passed quite happily.' At age 14, Rommel and a frie. Seller Inventory # 9781156124932"
