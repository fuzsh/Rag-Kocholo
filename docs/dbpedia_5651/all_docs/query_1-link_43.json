        "text": "Despite media reports to the contrary at the recent passing of Phillip Freherr von Boeselager, Ewald Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin is at this date the sole survivor of the July 20, 1944 plot. Unlike many others, he was heavily involved in the July 20 plot but strangely escaped retribution.\n\nLeutnant von Kleist was the son of Ewald von Kleist, a Prussian landowner and early opponent of Hitler who consistently refused to be intimidated by the Nazis. Kleist the elder was heavily involved in Oster's 1938 coup attempt and he acted as liaison to the British government. Prior to the collapse of this effort at Munich, Kleist the elder visited the British government and Winston Churchill (then out of power) to lobby for a firm stand against Hitler. His son, Ewald Heinrich was a Leutnant in the famous 9. Potsdam Infantry Regiment, a unit that another famous resister, Axel von dem Bussche said was notorious for having more men involved in the German Resistance than any other. While serving in the regiment, Kleist was recruited as an active resister by his C.O. Fritz Graf von der Schulenburg. Schulenburg served as Helldorf's deputy chief of the Berlin police on July 20.\n\nIn January 1944, Kleist was approached by Claus Graf von Stauffenberg and asked if he would consider carrying out a suicide bomb attack on Hitler during the planned presentation of new army uniforms. Kleist's brother officer of the 9. Potsdam Regiment, Axel von dem Bussche, had previously volunteered for such an attack after witnessing an Einsatzgruppe atrocity in the East. However, the demonstration was delayed and before it could be rescheduled, von dem Bussche was temporarily posted back to his unit on the Russian front where he was wounded and lost a leg.\n\nKleist asked for some time to think the proposal over and returned him to see his father. Kleist the elder noted his son's distracted manner and asked what was wrong. After the son described Stauffenberg's plan, the father turned away and gazed out the window for a time before turning back to face his son. If Ewald Heinrich was expecting to be barred from carrying out the plan, he was in for a surprise. His father told him: \"Yes. You must do it. A man who is offered such a chance and who does not do it can never be happy in this life again.\" It can only be imagined what saying these words cost the father. Kleist returned to Stauffenberg and agreed to the plan. He attack was never carried out due to the fact that the demonstration was again rescheduled and the opportunity was lost.\n\nKleist is the last survivor of those who were actually present at the Bendlerstrasse on July 20. He has given several interviews, notably including appearances in the Oscar nominated documentary \"The Restless Conscience,\" in which he compellingly describes the tension that day. He states that normally there is a certain weight of the air upon one's skin but on that day, when \"history was balancing on the edge of a knife,\" the weight of the atmosphere on his skin seemed a thousand times heavier.\n\nKleist was one of four subalterns from 9. Regiment sent by Schulenburg to assist the plotters during the coup. He was there when Stauffenberg returned from Wolfschanze and he witnessed the drama that occurred when Fromm refused to co-operate in issuing the Valkyrie order. In company with Stauffenberg's ADC von Haeften, Kleist drew his pistol when Fromm threatened the plotters with arrest. He jammed his weapon into Fromm?s stomach and arrested him instead. Later in the day, between 6 PM and 7 PM, General Joachimm von Kortzfleisch, the Commander of Wehrkreis III, visited the Bendler and denied Hitler was dead. He too had to be arrested and Kleist again drew his weapon. Later in the eveing General Olbricht sent Kleist into the streets surrounding the Bendlerblock to review the posture of Remer's guard battalion and he was later sent out on missions to liaise with the city commandant and police.\n\nWhen the coup failed, Kleist was arrested as an active conspirator. There were ample witnesses to his involvement through the day. He made two attempts to escape. In the first he struck down a guard who was armed with rifle and fixed bayonet and in the second he struggled free of an officer. The second time, he fled into a room in search of a window to leap from and instead burst into a room full of SS. When Otto Skorzeny toured the premises early in the morning of the 21st, he walked into a room where Kleist was handcuffed to a chair. Not seeing the restraints, Skorzeny bowed and introduced himself thinking Kleist was a loyal officer who had assisted in retaking the building.\n\nAmazingly, Kleist was not executed that night. In fact he was not executed at all or even held in custody for a long time. He saw his father one last time in the Bendlerstrasse but he could not exchange words with him. He remembers a look from his father in the basement of the Prinzalbrechtstrasse that he interpreted as \"I hope you behave.\" Soon after, Kleist the elder was sentenced to death by Freisler and was decapitated in Ploetzensee. Ewald Heinrich was released for lack of evidence and he immediately made his way to the front in Italy where he was captured. Kleist wonders to this day why he was released when he had been arrested as an active conspirator and in a country where a negative statement about Hitler could send you to the gallows. One theory he has heard is that the Gestapo released him hoping that Kleist would lead them to his friend, Ludwig von Hammerstein-Equord.\n\nAfter the war, Kleist founded a respected publishing house and the annual Munich security conference that is to this day a key date on the international security calendar. The conference draws senior statesmen, soldiers and foreign service officers from around the globe.\n\nThis is the only signature in my collection that was signed for me personally and for that reason has a special place.\n\nThe photo below shows Kleist in a suit with Ludwig Hammerstein's brother Kunrat.\n\nEdited October 16, 2016 by ColinRF\n\nDr. Eugen Gerstenmaier was born in 1906, the son of a master toolmaker. He grew up in Swabia and completed his Abitur in Stuttgart in 1931.In university he studied philosophy and theology in Tuebingen, Rostock and Zurich. He qualified for a university professorship in 1936 after completing his thesis on the relationship between Church and Creation. He was refused a professorship as a result of a clear track record of opposition to the Nazis.\n\nIn 1936, he started working for Bishop Theodore Heckel as a scientific assistant the Berlin External Affairs Office of the Evangelical Churches, a group that did not publicly criticise Hitler. Gerstenmaier then with the established contacts Ecumenical Council in Geneva. During the war he assisted in providing spiritual support to POWs and slave labourers.\n\nEarly in the war he met two men who would ultimately became founding members of the resistance cell organised by Helmuth James von Moltke ? the Kreisau Circle. They where Hans Bernd von Haeften, brother to Stauffenberg's ADC Werner, and Adam vonTrot zu Solz, both of whom were foreign service officers. In 1942, Gerstenmaier became a full fledged member of the Kreisau Circle, a group of intellectuals who met periodically to discuss ideas for the governance of Europe after Hitler?s inevitable defeat. Within the circle, Gerstenmaier was a Christian conservative. He shared the views of Peter Yorck von Wartenburg. After he lost his home to allied bombing, Gerstenmaier moved in with Yorck and his wife.\n\nGerstenmaier was, unlike many in the Kreisau group, in favour of direct and violent action to remove Hitler. He was present at the Bendlerblock on July 20 and was heavily involved in attempting to push the coup ahead, providing the scripts for proclamations that were never delivered due to the conspirators? inability to gain control of the radio stations. As the day progressed, Gerstenmaier, who had left for the Bendlerblock armed with a pistol and a bible, proposed to ensure the radicalisation of the coup by adding some bodies. He proposed that the conspirators arrest and execute Dr. Goebbels and other senior Nazis in Berlin. He wanted to ensure that there was no turning back.\n\nDr. Gerstenmaier was arrested in the Bendler early in the morning of July 20. He was tried before the Volksgerichtshof and astonishingly received only 7 years hard labour for what should have been a no brainer death sentence. This seemingly soft sentence led to a lot of criticism of Gerstenmaier after the war as some presumed he had sold out his co-conspirators to the Gestapo. This is non-sensical as the Gestapo could have extracted any information through torture and would likely not have honoured a plea bargain arrangement. Gerstenmaier's wife recalls that People?s Court President Freisler probably spared Gerstenmaier to personally ingratiate himself with the wife of a friend who he had a bit of a crush on.\n\nAfter the war, he was released from prison by American troops. He was then active in the Evangelical Aid Organisation and in setting up the July 20 aid organisation to assist the families of executed conspirators. From 1945 to 1951, he was its leader. Gerstenmaier was elected to the Presidency of the Bundestag, Germany's federal parliament. On January 31, 1969, he resigned his post as Bundestag President after public controversy about claims of certain compensation benefits he received as a victim of Nazi oppression. While he was legally entitled to the compensation, he received far more than most who had suffered similar damages and his award was judged to be a scandal. Suspicions of political influence could not be allayed.\n\nThe document below is signed by Gerstenmaier (top right) and other former Bundestag presidents including (from top to bottom beginning with the left side): Rita Suessmuth, Wolfgang Thierse, Gerstenmaier, Kai-Uwe von Hassel, Annemarie Renger, Karl Carstens, Richard Stuecklin, Rainer Barzel and Philipp Jenninger.\n\nEdited October 16, 2016 by ColinRF\n\nJohannes Popitz studied political science and law in Dessau, Leipzig and Halle. After graduation he was a government lawyer in 1917. He served in the Reich Ministry of Finance since 1919, where he was appointed state secretary in 1925. He was married to Cornelia Slot, with whom he had a daughter and two sons. Chancellor Franz von Papen appointed him Reich commissar for the Prussian Ministry of Finance after deposing the government of Prussia on July 20, 1932. A year later on April 21, 1933, the National Socialist leaders appointed Popitz as the new Prussian minister of finance. Up to this time, he was still not a member of the Party. .From 1938 on, he worked together with Hans Oster from Amt Ausland Abwehr. After the burning and looting of Jewish places of worship and businesses on Kristallnacht in November 1938, Popitz offered his resignation in protest. Given his importance to the country's financial administration, it was rejected.\n\nPopitz has one of the old school within the resistance and saw eye-to-eye with Carl Goerdeler. He was a right wing conservative who looked to replace the Nazi government with a returned monarchy under Crown Prince Wilhelm. Popitz was also a member of the \"Wednesday Society,\" a small group of high officials and industrialists who had evolved from a debating club into a centre for conservative opposition to the National Socialist regime. Other members of this pseudo-political/intellectual group included Ludwig Beck and Ulrich von Hassel. Through these contacts Popitz became immersed in the various coup plans. He drew up a provisional post-Hitler constitution, the \"Provisional Basic Law of the State,\" to propose the implementation of his ideas following a successful coup. The provisions of this document were not democratic. Rather, they continued the authoritarianism practiced by the current government in another form.\n\nDuring the summer of 1943, Popitz and Carl Langbehn, a lawyer and friend of Himmler's, developed a plan to meet with Himmler in secret and to suggest that communications be opened with the West to remove Hitler, sue for peace and continue the war in the East. The two were discouraged form pursuing their high-risk plan but they opted for it anyway. Their real plan was to weaken the Nazi regime by encouraging Himmler to stage an SS coup, setting the stage for a counter coup by the conspirators. Interestingly, the fiction of an SS coup was introduced by the conspirators on July 20 to justify the launching of Operation Valkyrie. Himmler listened to their treasonous proposals and did not report them or arrest them. However, in September 1943 a compromising message was intercepted from Langbehn to Western contacts and Himmler had no option but to arrest his old friend. Popitz was not arrested and an order was given that Langbehn was not to be tortured. However, Popitz was put under Gestapo surveillance. Their days were clearly numbered and the day following the July 20 plot, Popitz was arrested as well.\n\nOn October 3, 1944, Popitz was tried before the Volksgerichtshof and was sentenced to death by Freisler. Popitz' execution was deferred by Himmler so that his contacts with the West could be kept available if needed. However, the time came when Himmler could delay no longer without drawing unwelcome attention to his involvement and on February 2, 1945, Popitz was hanged in barbaric fashion at Ploetzensee Prison in Berlin.\n\nThe document below is Popitz' acceptance to a state dinner invitation.\n\nEdited October 16, 2016 by ColinRF\n\nThanks again for the kind comments. Now, moving on to some signatures and bios related to July 20 in Paris:\n\nThis bio is a compilation from various internet sources:\n\nGeneralfeldmarschall Hans Guenther von Kluge holds a key position as one of the few officers who claimed adherence to the conspiracy between 1943 and 1944. Despite the fact that he was privy to the conspirators' detailed plans and agreed form time to time to support them, he could never follow through. He always pulled back before the decisive moment and as a result, he is counted among the conspirators but is generally viewed as the personification of the opportunity lost. In 1943, von Kluge was the commander of Army Group Centre. His chief of operations was Colonel Henning von Tresckow, the prime mover of the 1943 plots and of the rewriting of Operation Valkyrie to suit the plotters' plans. In 1944, von Kluge had switched to be Commander in Chief West, a role that was crucial to the outcome of the July Plot overall.\n\nKluge served on the General Staff from 1910 to 1918. During the inter-war period, he rose quickly through the ranks to colonel in 1930, major-general in 1933 and lieutenant-general the following year. After 1936, Kluge was given command of an army corps. His interest in mobile warfare soon won Hitler?s notice.\n\nKluge was personally repelled by Hitler's Capone-like political style and he was equally disturbed by the way in which the Jewish persecution was carried out, although it is unclear whether this was based on morality or a disagreement on tactics and optics. In the September 1939 campaign against Poland, Kluge proved to be an outstanding military leader. In Poland, von Kluge achieved spectacular successes. He also recoiled in horror at the crimes of the Einsatzgruppen. Consistent with his later moral cowardice, Kluge commented on these crimes but did nothing to impeded them.\n\nIn early 1939, von Kluge heard the shocking news that Hitler planned to wage war against the West at the earliest opportunity. He pondered whether or not to join the conspirators in their second major coup plan (the first being Oster's plan in 1938 that was scuppered by Chamberlain folding his hand at Munich). He decided to decline given Hitler's immense popularity with the German people and troops. But he did not report the conspirators, consistent with his ideas of honour and with their status as brother officers. The October 1939 coup attempt would be aborted by Army Chief of Staff General Franz Halder based on his belief that Hitler was aware of the conspiracy. This fear emerged from Hitler's vow to \"destroy the spirit of Zossen\" (the headquarters of the General Staff) as he became frustrated with lukewarm support for his aggressive plans from his generals.\n\nIn June '41, Hitler awarded Kluge a field marshal's baton and selected him to be a senior general in the invasion of Russia. Kluge served in Army Group Centre and was promoted to its command after Feodor von Bock was stricken with illness. Hitler's generalship and inability to come to terms with even the most requisite of retreats made Kluge come to doubt his fitness for command, possibly even his sanity. Throughout 1943, von Kluge began to establish contact with the resistance, welcoming senior resisters at his headquarters and attending secret meetings in Berlin. The resisters can be forgiven for assuming that von Kluge was on side with their plans.\n\nUpon taking over Army Group Centre, von Kluge found his conscience in operations officer, von Bock's nephew General Staff Colonel Henning von Tresckow. Tresckow was the heart and sole of the military resistance, perhaps doing more than any other officer to ensure that Hitler was removed form power. Tresckow immediately sensed an opportunity in von Kluge and he never missed an opportunity to turn von Kluge more toward the conspiracy. He also used von Kluge's general sympathy for the conspiracy as a chance to set up a resistance cell primarily of aristocratic general staff officers in Army Group Centre.\n\nHarold Deutsche noted that there are four general phases to the resistance: the first phase in 1938 was centred on the Abwehr; the second phase in 1939 on the Army High Command in Zossen; the third in 1943 was centred on the Tresckow cell in Army Group Centre in Russia and the final phase in 1944 was centred on the reserve army HQ in the Bendlerstrasse.\n\nIn March 1943, Tresckow succeeded in luring Hitler to visit Army Group Centre HQ near Smolensk. Several assassination attempts were planned and one was initiated (more on these when I get to the Army Group Centre bios). Despite knowledge of the plans, von Kluge did not assist. Rather, he obstructed Tresckow but again did not report any of his detailed knowledge. Von Kluge's tenure as commander of Army Group Centre ended with a serious traffic accident.\n\nWhen ready to report back for duty, von Kluge was assigned to the Western Front. On June 29, 1944 he was appointed Generalfeldmarschall von Rundstedt's replacement as Commander in Chief West following that officer's famous \"make peace you fools!\" exclamation to Keitel.\n\nKluge was now commander of all the German forces in France and was now in a position to give the conspirators the pivotal support they needed for their coup. Upon taking over the West, von Kluge was of the opinion that Rommel and von Rundstedt were overly pessimistic, until he arrived and observed how bad things truly were. After making a series of visits to the front, von Kluge landed firmly back in the conspirators' camp, particularly after a visit by the conspirators' liaison, Stauffenberg's cousin Colonel Caesar von Hofaecker.\n\nOn July 16, military governor for Paris and co-conspirator General Karl Heinrich von Stuelpnagel informed Rommel and Kluge here would be a coup attempt very soon. Kluge promised to help only if they succeeded in killing Hitler while Rommel promised to cooperate with fewer provisos. Rommel was seriously wounded by air attack the next day and the absence of his support and decisive leadership is sorely missed 3 days later.\n\nOn July 20, Stuelpnagel threw his weight decisively behind the coup, issuing orders for the arrest of all SS, SD and Gestapo personnel in Paris without informing von Kluge. Once von Kluge learned of Hitler's survival, it was clear that it was futile to expect any support from this quarter. In fact he is claimed to have stated: \"I would have gone along if the swine had been dead!\" As soon as von Kluge found out what Stuelpnagel had done, he countermanded that officer's arrest orders and took steps to free the arrested security personnel. He also lost no time in contacting Wolfschanze to express his loyalty and to report Stuelpnagel. Hitler was immediately suspicious about von Kluge but he was key to the defence of this front and could not be replaced.\n\nOn August 15, 1944, von Kluge decided to pay a front line visit to his troops near the deteriorating Falaise Gap. Caught by over powering allied air power, his command car and radio destroyed by airstrike, von Kluge and his close staff were incommunicado for more than 24 hours. That was too much for Hitler who immediately assumed that von Kluge was making contact with the Americans and readying the front for a unilateral surrender. He may have been right. Dr. Udo Esche, Kluge's son-in-law (who provided the cyanide capsule with which the field marshal later commited suicide) told Allied interrogators that Kluge had contemplated surrender and \"went to the front line but was unable to get in touch with the Allied commanders.\" Hitler removed him before he could regain contact and replaced him with Generalfeldmarschall Model and recalled von Kluge to Berlin. Unsure of his reception in Berlin and seeing his cherished military reputation in tatters, von Kluge took cyanide near Valmy France while having a rest stop on the drive to Berlin. He was one of three field marshals to die as a direct consequence of the July plot, the other two being von Witzleben and Rommel.\n\nVon Kluge left a final note for Hitler. It was delivered following his suicide. An excerpt follows:\n\n\"When you receive these lines I shall be no more. I cannot bear the reproach that I have sealed the fate of the West through faulty measures, and I have no means of defending myself. I draw a conclusion from that and am dispatching myself where already thousands of my comrades are. I have never feared death. Life has no more meaning for me, and I also figure on the list of war criminals who are to be delivered up.\n\nOur applications were not dictated by pessimism but by sober knowledge of the facts. I do not know if Field-Marshal Model, who has been proved in every sphere, will still master the situation. From my heart I hope so. Should it not be so, however, and your cherished new weapons not succeed, then, my Fuehrer, make up your mind to end the war. The German people have borne such untold suffering that it is time to put an end to this fnghtfulness. There must be ways to attain this end, and above all to prevent the Reich from falling under the Bolshevist heel.\"\n\nEdited October 16, 2016 by ColinRF\n\nHans Freiherr von Boineberg-Lengsfeld was born on June 9, 1889, in Eisenach. He served in WWI, and in armoured troops in the early years of WWII when he won a Knight's Cross. He was the Commandant of the Greater Paris area at the time of the July 20 attempt. However, Boineburg-Lengsfeld had stated to Generalfeldmarschall Erwin von Witzleben as early as 1942 that he was ready to take part in a coup, at the time that he was still with 23. Panzer Division. On July 20, his was a key position as he had personal command of Heer troops of the Paris garrison. Boineburg-Lengsfeld was fully briefed on the plans for the coup and was fully in support. He was recruited into the conspiracy against Hitler by General Karl Heinrich von Stuelpnagel, the military governor of France.\n\nHe helped Stuelpnagel and his aid Colonel Caesar von Hofacker develop an operational plan to seize control of Paris on X-Day (the anticipated date of the coup d'etat). On July 17, he was informed by Stuelpnagel that the assassination would be attempted within a few days and that he was to arrest all of the regime's security personnel in Paris. Boineburg-Lengsfeld then made sure that he had an up to date map showing all relevant locations.\n\nOn July 20, 1944. Boineberg-Lengsfeld led the 1st Garrison Regiment of 325. Security Division in a lightning strike against all SS, SD and Gestapo bases throughout the Paris metropolitan area. These were simultaneous raids intended to result in the disarming and arrest of all of the regime's security apparatus in Paris, and by extension across France. Within one hour, the entire SS, SD, and Gestapo contingent in Paris was in army custody, including senior SS police commanders Carl Oberg and Helmuth Knochen. Boineburg-Lengsfeld personally supervised the operation. The arrests were carried out flawlessly with absolutely no resistance being shown by the SS, despite the fact that some thought they were being taken prisoner by French resistance personnel disguised in German uniforms.\n\nBut within hours of Stuelpnagel's brilliant coup, Boineberg-Lengsfeld is compelled to release all SS officials following Hitler's radio broadcast and Kluge's refusal to back Stuelpnagel. Admiral Krancke, in command of about 5,000 marines camped outside Paris also threatened to intervene and with the collapse of Stauffenberg's coup in Berlin, the decision was made that continuing in Paris would risk civil war.\n\nOwing to Stuelpnagel and Hofacker's resourceful cover-up of the Paris-based conspiracy, Boineberg-Lengsfeld escaped the Gestapo's suspicion and survived the war. Given his close association with the conspiracy and his hand in the SS arrests, he was removed from his post as Commandant of Paris and succeeded by General Dietrich Von Choltitz of \"Is Paris Burning?\" fame. He was put in reserve in August 1944 and served as a commander of fortress troops thereafter. He was taken prisoner and was released June 30, 1946. He died November 20, 1980, in Felsberg-Altenburg, Hessen.\n\nThe signature below is on a book awarded as a prize.\n\nEdited October 18, 2016 by ColinRF\n\nErwin Rommel, Germany's \"Desert Fox,\" is probably the best known of Hitler's commanders. Despite serving a criminal regime, he managed to gain and retain the respect of both his countrymen and his enemies. Rommel is credited with doing his best to fight a chivalrous war, even under \"total war\" conditions. For example, he was one of the few commanders who refused to implement Hitler's infamous \"Commando Order\" that required the execution of all captured commandos and saboteurs, whether taken in uniform or not.\n\nA professional soldier, Rommel served in the elite Alpine Corps during the Great War. He was wounded three times, earned the Iron Cross (first and second class) and was awarded Prussia's highest decoration for valour, the Pour Le Merite or \"Blue Max.\" Between the wars, he was an instructor at the Dresden Infantry School from 1929 to 1933 and at the Potsdam War Academy from 1935 to 1938. In 1937, he published his lecture notes, base don his war diaries, as a much-read manual entitled \"Infanterie Greift An\" (Infantry Attacks). In 1938, Rommel, now an Oberst, was appointed to command Hitler's personal protection battalion, the Fuehrer Begleitbattalion. Promoted to Generalmajor in 1939, he commanded the Fuehrer's mobile headquarters throughout the Polish campaign.\n\nIn 1940, Rommel was given command of 7. Panzer Division, later nicknamed the Gespenster-Division (Ghost Division). Remarkably, this was Rommel's first command of a panzer unit. As a reward for outstanding performance in France, Rommel was given command of the German mobile troops that were being sent to North Africa to assist the defeated and dispirited Italians. It was in command of this \"Deutches Afrika Korps\" that Rommel would achieve his greatest notoriety in the fluid battles fought across the North African desert in 1942. He became the darling of the Nazi press and even Churchill saluted his skills in parliament. In 1943, he was invalided home from Africa, before the inevitable surrender of German forces.\n\nAfter his return from Africa, Rommel was unemployed for a period, although he did command the German forces entering Italy after that country's surrender and withdrawal from the Axis. Rommel did his best to shore up the beach defences of the \"Atlantic Wall\" after being placed in command of Heeresgruppe B and made responsible for defending the French coast against the expected Allied invasion. He sought Hitler's permission for his preferred strategy for deploying Germany's mobile reserves close to the likely invasion beaches. Hitler chose instead to keep his tanks in deep reserve until they could be used en masse after Allied intentions became crystal clear. History shows that Rommel's strategy would have served Germany better. The Allies gained a foothold in Normandy and for that point, Rommel judged that the war in the west was lost.\n\nSeveral members of Rommel's staff were heavily involved in the anti-Hitler conspiracy within the Wehrmacht including his Chief of Staff Hans Speidel, his chief naval aid Friedrich Ruge, and his personal aid Hellmuth Lang. In addition, other high ranking officers serving in the West were involved, particularly General von Stuelpnagel, the Military Governor of occupied France. During Rommel's command in France, several attempts were made to recruit him as an active resister. On several occasions, the conspirators directly approached him. Dr. Karl Stroelin, the Oberbuergermeister of Stuttgart lectured Rommel and appealed to his conscience on multiple occasions. Hans Speidel arranged for Stuelpnagel's adjutant and cousin, Caesar von Hofacker to approach Rommel and seek his approval to assist the plotters by surrendering in the West. On July 11, 1944, Hofacker returned to Berlin to brief Stauffenberg and Goerdeler, thinking Rommel was solidly behind the conspiracy. Lucie Rommel has always maintained that her husband would not have approved of an assassination plot and that he only wanted Hitler deposed, arrested and tried as a criminal.\n\nOn July 15, 1944, the same day that Stauffenberg made his first abortive attempt to kill Hitler at Wolfschanze, Rommel wrote to Hitler informing him that it was his opinion that the war was lost and imploring him to make peace. The letter was sent in early August by his successor Hans Guenther von Kluge after Rommel was seriously wounded on July 17, 1944 when his staff car was strafed, most likely by an RCAF spitfire flown by Flt Lt. Charlie Fox, DFC. The Generalfeldmarschall was returning from a briefing session with Sepp Dietrich, the commander of the 1. SS Panzer Korps.\n\nIn August, Rommel was well enough to return home to recuperate. From then on things started to go steadily downhill for him as various bomb plot conspirators were tortured and interrogated by the July 20 Special Commission. In October 1944, Rommel was invited to attend upon Hitler at his headquarters to discuss future employment, but he was not well enough to travel. Instead, Generals Burgdorff and Maisel were dispatched to meet with Rommel at his home. They brought with them the shocking news that Rommel had been implicated in the plot, ostensibly by von Hofacker and Speidel. Inclusion of his name on the conspirators' list of prospective members of a post-coup government did not assist his case. It is also possible that von Stuelpnagel mentioned Rommel's name after his suicide attempt while delirious.\n\nRommel was presented with the choice of honourably killing himself of facing the People's Court under Freisler. He realised that he would never reach Berlin alive if he selected the second option as his name was too important to public opinion to allow it to be publicly listed among the conspirators. He would clearly become the victim of a staged SS accident if he tried to get to Berlin and his family would suffer accordingly. On October 14, 1944, Rommel said goodbye to his family and personal staff and drove off with Burgdorff and Maisel. He took cyanide after the staff car stopped on a country lane not far form his home. He was given a state funeral with full honours and it was not until after the war that the truth of his fate and the nature of his involvement with the Stauffenberg plot became known in Germany and in the West.\n\nEdited October 18, 2016 by ColinRF\n\nKarl Stroelin was Lord Mayor of the Swabian city of Stuttgart. Like Carl Goerdeler, he was a conservative politician who was an initial admirer of the demonstrated strength and national priorities of the Nazis. Only when Nazi crimes became apparent did he begin to lose faith in Hitler and move into the opposition camp.\n\nHe was the son of a career officer and he fought in the First World War. He left the army as a direct result of the downsizing that resulted form the Versailles Treaty. He earned a doctorate with a thesis on the situation of the workers and middle class after the war. He was drawn into the sphere of the Nazi party in the 1920's and joined it in 1931. In 1931, Stroelin ran for election as Lord Mayor of Stuttgart as the Nazi candidate, he was decisively defeated. Instead, he ran for and succeeded in winning a position on the city council. After the rise of Hitler in 1933, Stroelin became Lord Mayor. His main administrative duties as Mayor focused on urban planning and housing matters.\n\nStroelin was also the chairman of the German Foreign Institute, effectively mayor of the notional administrative city that incorporated all overseas Germans. He was chosen for this role as a result of the fact that many emigrants form Germany were Swabians. After the war, he was accused of encouraging and administering German international intelligence and fifth column activities. It was established at Nuremburg that he intervened with Nazi authorities, including Freisler, to save several people from death sentences.\n\nStroelin was a close friend of Rommel. In the film \"The Desert Fox,\" he was portrayed by Cedric Hardwick who quite accurately applies influence on the Swabian Field Marshal to revolt against Hitler. It is thought that Stroelin's influence was key in getting Rommel to turn against Hitler, even in the limited way he did so. After the July 20 bomb attack, Stroelin's house was searched by the Gestapo but nothing incriminating against him was found. Nevertheless, he was still suspected given his contacts with Goerdeler and Rommel and he lost his party rank.\n\nAs French and American troops advanced on Stuttgart in April 1945, the Nazis declared the city to be a fortress and called for its defenders to fight to the last. As a former officer Stroelin knew that the city could not be defended. The city had already been significantly damaged by air attack and a ground assault could only lead to the loss of remaining buildings and inhabitants. Stroelin risked his life and reputation and made the bold move to secretly contact the French army and he offered the peaceful surrender of his city. The Gestapo learned of his contact with the Allies and obtained an arrest warrant against him. However, transmission of the arrest order was sabotaged and he was not arrested in the waning days of the war.\n\nStroelin as a Lord Mayor of a major German city and senior Nazi leader was initially seen as a major Nazi offender. When the Allies came to understand his involvement with the July plot and resistance, he was released on bail and quickly processed through the denazification courts. He was a witness at the Nuremburg war crimes trials, primarily in support of von Neurath. After the war, Stroelin was shunned by the left and the right given his Nazi past and as a result of his surrender of Stuttgart.\n\nEdited October 18, 2016 by ColinRF\n\nGeneralleutnant Hans Speidel was, like Rommel and Stauffenberg, a Swabian from the Wurtemburg area. He represented one of the younger and more energetic members of the resistance. He is sometimes presented as having come to the side of the conspirators only after experiencing two years of brutal and total war on the eastern front but it should be remembered that Speidel served as an aid to Beck for diplomatic assignments in the pre-war period and he was almost certainly influenced by him.\n\nSpeidel served in the First World War and he stayed with the Reichswehr in the inter-war period becoming a General Staff officer and reaching the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel by 1939. He served in the French campaign as Chief of Staff to the military commander in France and in 1942 he was transferred East, becoming Chief of Staff to V Corps. By 1943, he was Chief of Staff to Army Group South and a Generalmajor. In 1943, Speidel was Chief of Staff to General Hubert Lanz. In this role, he conspired with Lanz and one of his Corps commanders, Hyazinth von Strachwitz, to kidnap and, if necessary, kill Hitler during an expected front visit at Poltava on February 17. The plan failed when Lanz retreated in violation of \"stand fast\" orders and was relieved.\n\nIn April 1944, Rommel asked for him and Speidel was transferred west to become Chief of Staff to Army Group B, the primary defensive force for the coming Normandy invasion. In this position, Speidel did much to influence Rommel to join, or least not impeded the conspirators in their efforts to unseat Hitler. There is talk, mostly based on sloppy history by David Irving, that Speidel deliberately sabotaged German operational efforts to respond to the Normandy invasion by withholding panzer reserves that could have been committed. However, this has been discounted by Rommel's naval aid von Ruge: \"There does not exist any proof, and betrayal certainly was not in Speidel's nature.\"\n\nAfter Rommel's wounding in a strafing attack on July 17, 1944, Speidel continued in his role as Chief of Staff to Army Group B, now serving Generalfeldmarschall Hans von Kluge who was performing the dual roles of Commander of Army Group B and Command in Chief West. He was unaware of the pending July 20 attack even though he was engaged as a full member of the conspiracy. Given that just two full days had passed between von Kluge's assumption of command and the bomb attack on Hitler, Speidel had no opportunity to brief von Kluge on the conspirators? plans, despite the fact that he was known to be generally supportive of removing Hitler. During July 20 in Paris, Speidel had little opportunity to influence events as they played out very quickly between late afternoon when orders were given by von Stuelpnagel to arrest all SS and Gestapo personnel. Later in the evening, it became apparent that Hitler had survived and was still in control.\n\nAfter the collapse in Paris, very few officers were arrested compared to Berlin. Despite clear evidence of a pervasive resistance effort. This could have been due to a reluctance to disrupt the command structure on a critical front but was more likely due to a sham cover story agreed to between the army and SS to explain the reasons for the arrests.\n\nSpeidel was not spared however. He was arrested by the Gestapo and interrogated. David Irving says that he implicated Rommel under torture but Speidel's close post-war friendship with the Rommel family belies this accusation.\n\nIt is clear that Hitler believed Speidel guilty. However, he was one of the few, if not the only one, who was considered for expulsion from the Wehrmacht by the army court of honour chaired by von Rundstedt and who was not expelled. It is thought that Speidel's close contacts with senior officers like Guderian protected him. Expulsion from the Wehrmacht was a necessary pre-condition for trial before the Peoples' Court so Speidel was effectively protected from both the security service and Hitler's judiciary. Nevertheless Speidel was jailed by the Gestapo. At the end of the war he escaped and was saved by French troops.\n\nAfter the war, Speidel was involved in the creation of the Bundeswehr, rising to full general and Commander in Chief of all Nato ground forces in Europe.\n\nThe signed (on rear) portrait photo below is a rarely seen one of Speidel in his Heer uniform. The other photo is a pre-war shot of Speidel (left) with Beck on a diplomatic assignment.\n\nEdited October 18, 2016 by ColinRF"
