        "text": "To the Editor:\n\nMr. Reitlinger’s review of Annedore Leber’s Conscience in Revolt (February) creates the impression that Mrs. Leber in her selection of anti-Nazi resistance fighters permitted herself to be guided by motives not wholly compatible with the noble task she has set for herself. Exclusion of the Communists, says Mr. Reitlinger, creates conformity and, with regard to others, he asks: “Can it be that they were left out because they were Conservatives?”\n\nAs an expert on German questions, Mr. Reitlinger should have known that Annedore Leber, whatever the faults of her selection, could not have had questionable motives. Is it asking too much that he should also have known that the volume now published in New York and London represents less than half of Mrs. Leber’s selections? It is a translation—and not a complete one—of only the first volume of Mrs. Leber’s resistance documentary, a fact unfortunately not mentioned in the English and American editions. In Germany, the second volume was announced as early as 1955, and the prospectus of this second volume, inserted in the first and distributed at the Frankfort Book Fair in 1955, shows full-page photos of Ulrich von Hassell, one of the Conservatives whom Reitlinger describes as missing, and Eugen Bolz, another Conservative. In the second volume there appear, besides Bolz and Hassell, Johannes Popitz, Erwin von Witzleben, Hellmuth Stieff, Wilhelm Canaris, Erich Hoepner and Friedrich Olbricht, all of whom are mentioned by Reitlinger as left out for a purpose. And in the same volume, Harro Schulze-Boysen and the Rote Kapelle are discussed extensively enough to leave no doubt about this group’s political philosophy, Communism. “Execution,” says Mrs. Leber, “prevented their disillusionment and saved them from the practice of Communism in Germany.”\n\nMay I also take exception to a certain righteousness in this review. If Mr. Reitlinger terms an actor “a victim of accident” because “he could not bear to part from his Jewish wife,” in other words because a man’s love was greater than his fears, he betrays a strange lack of understanding for the reality of life under Hitler. And if Mr. Reitlinger professes not to be surprised that Bernhard Lichtenberg, this most noble of men, has not been canonized, such criticism of the Vatican seems, to say the least, premature.\n\nHans Wallenberg\n\nNew York City\n\n_____________\n\nMr. Reitlinger writes:\n\nIs it asking too much, Mr. Wallenberg demands, that I should have known that the volume I reviewed, which was published in London and New York, represented less than half of Mrs. Leber’s selections? I answer, yes, much too much. He himself complains that there is no mention in this volume of another to come. I have read the original German edition, which was published in 1953, and that contains no mention either. Nor does Mr. Wallenberg say whether the second volume, of which he has seen a prospectus dated 1955, was in fact published. I can only conclude that Frau Leber intended her book to be complete at the time she wrote it. I therefore feel justified in describing her first choice of biographies as politically biased. “Questionable motives” is a phrase I never used.\n\nI may have expressed myself ill in using the expression, “victims of accident.” I was endeavoring to say that it is not an act of resistance against tyranny to commit suicide sooner than be forced to part from one’s wife. The unhappy man who was overtaken by this nemesis, simply for having loved a Jewish woman, was surely a victim of circumstances, or as I put it, “accident.” As to Bernhard Lichtenberg, Mr. Wallenberg finds my criticism of the Vatican premature. Of course he may be in a better position than I to say what the Vatican is going to do in the future. I confined my remarks to the present; and, though he has been dead nearly fifteen years, Lichtenberg has not been canonized. I have already said why this causes me no surprise.\n\nMay I take this opportunity to correct a misstatement in the printed text of my review? By some oversight Fritz von der Schulenburg is described as having joined the “Gestapo” in 1937, when in fact he joined the Prussian police. There is of course a difference between serving in the Berlin Police Presidium and serving in the Gestapo, which carried a particular taint of its own.\n\n_____________"
