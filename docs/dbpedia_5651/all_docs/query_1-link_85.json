        "text": "We all know of the famous July 20 Plot, the failed attempt to kill Hitler and use Valkyrie to stage a coup, as well as the assassination attempts by Elser and Bavaud. There are other lesser known attempts too and this one piqued my interest:\n\nAn attempt to assassinate Hitler was planned for July 27, 1940, in Paris, where Count Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenberg planned to shoot Hitler from the reviewing stand during a military parade in Hitler’s honour. Hitler however secretly visited Paris in the early hours of July 23, visiting all the city’s famed buildings. He began his tour at 6am and by 9am he ended his tour and departed the city. A few days later Schulenberg received word that his hoped for July 27 military parade had been cancelled. Despite Schulenberg’s failure to lure Hitler to Paris for the special parade, Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben had plans of his own to assassinate Hitler. In May, 1941, he attemped to lure Hitler to Paris under a similar pretext. The visit was scheduled for May 21st but was abruptly called off at the last minute.\n\nSo what if the second attempt to kill Hitler in Paris on May 21st 1941 succeeded because the visit is never called off? Given Hitler's last will and testament, the fact that the Luftwaffe hasn't been blemished yet for failing to protect German cities from Allied bombers, and that nobody else has the clout to take over, Goering probably takes power (though feel free to point out other likely candidates, if there are any). But what then? Barbarossa is less than five weeks away. Goering was never a big fan, but would he or anybody else dare to cancel the largest military operation in history after so many months of preparations and make it all a wasted effort? Or would he press ahead and tweak the grand goals Hitler had set out, i.e. Lebensraum and racial war of annihilation?\n\nGoering was known for ruthlessness, but also being pragmatic: he once said \"I decide who is a Jew\" and appears to have been a racist largely because party ideology required him to be. But now he's probably in charge. What would change about Barbarossa, the Holocaust and the general poor treatment of Eastern Europeans in a Third Reich exit Hitler May 1941? If Barbarossa goes ahead, would Goering settle for Brest-Litovsk 2.0 perhaps? We know it was offered by Stalin, until it became clear he wasn't going to lose.\n\ngeneral poor treatment of Eastern Europeans in a Third Reich exit Hitler May 1941?\n\nI can't comment on the rest of the ideas, but unfortunately, any military that marches into the USSR will have to treat the civillians poorly, ideology or no. Up until the 1980s, only ten countries managed to produce enough food to support their own populations. Brazil, Australia, Canada, USA, USSR and 5 others I can't quite remeber, but all were in the Allies or Neutral at the time of WW2. Enlargement of the military is a net drain on resources, men in uniform produce nothing and only consume. No industrial goods to sell, no hard currency mined to trade for agriculture, no harvests brought in. The way to counterbalance this is by using foreign workers, or slave labor. Foreign workers need to be paid, which requires a civillian economy to create products to sell to provide cash to pay foreign workers. Slave labourers are well, slaves. German civillians were not bound by strict rationing until later in the war, this helped keep the population happy, but this happiness not only means all of the available food in Germany is eaten, food actively has to be taken from other countries. As Germany marched into the USSR, even leaving aside scorched earth taking place as the Red Army retreats, a lack of fuel, the call up of men to serve in the Red Army, and hard active combat renders large swathes of food producing terrain useless. There simply is not enough food in a Europe at war, for the German army to remain in the field, an army that was already stretched to the limit and did not have the resources to both carry out combat operations and maintain rear area security efficently. Even if the Germans had not planned a genocide, the numbers simply mean that \"take the food, shoot the ones that refuse\" is going to be the main plan.\n\nYou can essentially see the idea of \"What if Hitler had treated the Eastern People's nicely\" carried out in Greece, just based off my reading of \"Inside Hitler's Greece\" by Mark Mazower. Hitler essentially wanted to treat the Greeks as Western European's due to his partiality for Ancient Greek Culture/History and his fictional connection of Aryans and the Ancient Greeks. The realities of war led to food seizures, famine and a spiralling cycle of violence that led to Greece being the site of guerilla warfare familiar to any Soviet Partisan"
