The Parent and Merger Sub are sometimes referred to herein as the “Parent Companies.”\n\nRECITALS:\n\nThe respective Boards of Directors of the Company, the Parent and Merger Sub have deemed it advisable and in the best interests of the Company, the Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, and their respective stockholders that Merger Sub merge with and into the Company with the Company being the Surviving Corporation (as defined herein) in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (the “Merger”), and have approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;\n\nAs an inducement to the Parent entering into this Agreement, certain Persons in their capacities as stockholders of the Company are concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement entering into agreements in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Voting Agreements”).\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n\nARTICLE I\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nSection 1.01 Definitions. Certain capitalized and other terms used in this Agreement are defined in Annex A hereto and are used herein with the meanings ascribed to them therein.\n\nSection 1.02 Rules of Construction. Unless the context otherwise requires, as used in this Agreement: (a) an accounting term not otherwise defined has the meaning ascribed to it in accordance with GAAP; (b) “or” is not exclusive; (c) ”including” means “including, without limitation;” (d) words in the plural include the singular; (e) the terms “hereof,” “herein,” “hereby,” “hereto” and derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement and (f) the terms “Article” or “Section” refer to the specified Article or Section of this Agreement.\n\nARTICLE II\n\nTHE MERGER\n\nSection 2.01 Statutory Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof and in reliance upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL. The terms and conditions of the Merger and the mode of carrying the same into effect will be as set forth in this Agreement. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue its existence under the laws of the State of Delaware and in such capacity as the surviving corporation of the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “Surviving Corporation.”\n\nAgreement and Plan of Merger\n\n-1-\n\nSection 2.02 Effective Time. As soon as practicable on or after the Closing, the parties will cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL (the “Certificate of Merger”). The Merger will become effective (the “Effective Time”) upon filing and acceptance of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as shall be agreed upon by the Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger.\n\nSection 2.03 Effect of the Merger. From and after the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger will be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.\n\nSection 2.04 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws. The Certificate of Merger will provide that at the Effective Time (i) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended as of the Effective Time so as to contain the provisions, and only the provisions, contained immediately prior thereto in the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, except for Article I thereof, which shall read “The name of the corporation is “Marimba, Inc.,” and (ii) the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.\n\nSection 2.05 Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.\n\nSection 2.06 Closing. The Closing will take place at the offices of Xxxxxx & Xxxxxx L.L.P., 2300 First City Tower, 0000 Xxxxxx, Xxxxxxx, Xxxxx 00000, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the next Business Day following the date on which all of the conditions set forth in Article VIII have been satisfied or waived or at such other place, time and date as the parties hereto may agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the “Closing Date.”\n\nARTICLE III\n\nCONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES\n\nSection 3.01 Merger Consideration; Conversion and Cancellation of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent Companies, the Company or the holders of any of their securities:\n\n(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Article III, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Company Common Stock described in Section 3.01(b) or Dissenting Shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive $8.25 in cash, without interest (“Merger Consideration”). All shares of Company Common Stock will, upon conversion thereof into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time, cease to be outstanding and will be automatically cancelled and retired. The holders of certificates previously evidencing Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by Law.\n\nAgreement and Plan of Merger\n\n-2-\n\n(b) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share of Company Common Stock, if any, owned by the Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished without conversion thereof.\n\n(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.\n\nSection 3.02 Surrender and Payment.\n\n(a) Exchange Fund. Promptly following the Effective Time, the Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Disbursing Agent, for the benefit of the former holders of Company Common Stock and for payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article III, cash in an amount equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (exclusive of any such shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.01(b)) (such amounts being referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). The Disbursing Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by the Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section 3.01(a) shall be promptly paid to the Parent.\n\n(b) Letter of Transmittal. Promptly following the Effective Time, the Parent will cause the Disbursing Agent to mail to each record holder of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and other appropriate materials for use in surrendering to the Disbursing Agent certificates that prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Common Stock. Such letter of transmittal will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates formerly evidencing Company Common Stock will pass, only upon delivery of such certificates to the Disbursing Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Parent may reasonably specify.\n\n(c) Payment Procedures. The Disbursing Agent will pay to each former holder of Company Common Stock, upon surrender to the Disbursing Agent for cancellation of one or more certificates that theretofore evidenced shares of Company Common Stock together with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such certificate or certificates, after giving effect to any required withholding taxes. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of such certificate or certificates. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered certificate or certificates are registered, it will be a condition of payment that the surrendered certificate or certificates will be properly endorsed, with signatures guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment will pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered certificate or certificates or such Person will establish to the satisfaction of the\n\nAgreement and Plan of Merger\n\n-3-\n\nParent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Article III, each certificate that prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Common Stock (other than certificates evidencing shares described in Section 3.01(b) or Dissenting Shares) will be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender thereof the applicable Merger Consideration.\n\n(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any certificate that prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificates to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the Disbursing Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.\n\n(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration that remains unpaid by the Exchange Agent to the former holders of Company Common Stock six months after the Effective Time will be delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article III will thereafter look only to the Parent for payment of any Merger Consideration to which they are entitled.\n\n(f) No Liability. Neither the Disbursing Agent nor any party hereto will be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.\n\n(g) Withholding of Tax. The Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as the Parent (or any Affiliate thereof) is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Parent or any Affiliate thereof, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.\n\n(h) Stock Transfer Books. At the close of business on the date of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and there will be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the books and records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, certificates which prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Common Stock (other than certificates evidencing shares described in Section 3.01(b)) are presented to the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in Article III.\n\nSection 3.03 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are held by any record holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal\n\nAgreement and Plan of Merger\n\n-4-\n\nrights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due in respect of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL; provided, however, that any holder of Dissenting Shares who shall have failed to perfect or shall have withdrawn or lost his rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, in each case under the DGCL, shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted into the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration without interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3.03, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of any holder of Dissenting Shares to be paid the fair value of such stockholder’s Dissenting Shares shall cease. The Surviving Corporation shall comply with all of its obligations under the DGCL with respect to holders of Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give the Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal, any withdrawals of such demands received by the Company and any other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct and participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or negotiate, offer to settle or settle any such demands.\n\nSection 3.04 Adjustments. If during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of the shares of Company Common Stock, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted.\n\nARTICLE IV\n\nREPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY\n\nSubject to the Company’s Disclosure Letter, the Company hereby represents and warrants to the Parent Companies that:\n\nSection 4.01 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

No Equity Securities of the Company are reserved for issuance. There are no (i) outstanding securities, options or warrants, agreements or commitments of any character to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant, issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be granted, issued, delivered or sold, any Equity Securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) stock appreciation rights or similar derivative securities or rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any obligations by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the price or value of any Equity Securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) agreements or commitments of any character (contingent or otherwise) pursuant to which any Person is or may be entitled to receive any payment based on the level of consolidated revenues or earnings, or calculated in accordance therewith, of the Company.

None of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns, has agreed to purchase or otherwise acquire or holds any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any Equity Securities of any Person (other than the Subsidiaries of the Company).\n\n(c) All the issued and outstanding shares of Equity Securities of each Subsidiary of the Company, (i) have been duly authorized and are validly issued, and, with respect to capital stock, are fully paid and nonassessable, and were not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights and (ii) are owned by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens.\n\nAgreement and Plan of Merger\n\n-6-\n\n(d) Other than the Voting Agreements, there are no voting trusts, proxies or other agreements, commitments or understandings of any character to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound with respect to the voting of any Equity Securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.\n\n(e) Except for Company Stock Options and rights to purchase Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company Stock Purchase Plans, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holder of which has the right to vote or which are convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote with the stockholders of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on any matter.\n\nSection 4.04 Authorization of Agreement; Board Recommendation; Required Vote.\n\n(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the Required Company Vote, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the Required Company Vote). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the other parties hereto) constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting creditor’s rights generally or by legal principles of general applicability governing the availability of equitable remedies.\n\n(b) The Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held on April 27, 2004, has by unanimous approval of all directors determined that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and in the best interest of the Company’s stockholders and resolved to recommend that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock approve this Agreement and the Merger. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to approve this Agreement and the Merger (the “Required Company Vote”) is the only vote of holders of Company Common Stock or other securities (equity or otherwise) of the Company necessary to consummate the Merger.\n\nSection 4.05 Approvals.
