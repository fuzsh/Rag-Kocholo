This redirection happens at three areas - System32-SysWOW64 folder, ProgramFiles-Program Files(x86) folder and in registry WoW6432Node location. Based on the architecture of application writing to these locations, it will decide the location to write. Pre 8.2.02, we had a 32 bit engine. It used to write to 32 bit locations (programFiles(x86), SysWow64, WOW6432Node in registry). Now, we have 64 bit agent it will write at 64 bit locations (program files , System32 and outside WOW6432Node in registry). His question is if this is a right way and if their packages will place data properly in right location. From product side, this is the way we have designed it and it should work that way. We will hold a meeting to further explain the details. © Copyright March 25, 2013 Chris@CM-UG.com\n\n4. www.CM-UG.com Configuration Management – User Group (formerly: Marimba Users Group) 32/64 Bit Meeting Date: Thursday, March 28, 2013 Time: Noon Central Time - 10:30 pm, India Time (Mumbai, GMT+05:30) Meeting Number: 318 151 795 Meeting Password: 123 US Conferencing Number: 1-855-747-8824 NEW CODE: 239 – 774 – 3116 Toll: 1-719-325-2630 India: 000 800 100 7687 Germany: 0800 588 9225 1.
