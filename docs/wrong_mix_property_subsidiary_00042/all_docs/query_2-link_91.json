        "text": "Marimba got huge amounts of hype. It got a BusinessWeek cover, which used to mean something. There was a cover story in Red Herring, which used to exist.\n\nThen Marimba flopped.\n\nThe problem was that all the publicity came when Marimba had only been in business four months – and they only had four months of code written.\n\n\"For decades,\" says a still-active seriel entrepreneur from the era, \"that company had to deal with the fact that every programmer in the world who had to use their technology thought of them as just being hype – a big company full of hot air.\"\n\nEventually, Marimba pivoted and sold to BMC Software in Houston for a little more than twice the amount of venture capital it raised.\n\nWhy do we bring all this up?\n\nBecause the story of Marimba kind of reminds of another startup, on that's red hot right now – Quora.\n\nLike Marimba's was, Quora's hype is white hot. A Quora investor recently told us the startup wouldn't sell right now for a price less than $1 billion.\n\nMarimba was hyped because its founders, best known for their work at the prior company. Quora gets a lot of hype because its cofounders, Adam D'Angelo and Charlie Cheever, were early Facebook employees.\n\nMarimba's hype created unreasonable expectations for new users. Most tried it and walked away disappointed. It was supposed to be a way for companies to push news stories to people's desktops. It ended up being a tool used to push software updates.\n\nQuora's hype is also creating unreasonable expectations for new users. When New York Times columnist David Pogue tried the site, he was under the impression it would be able to help him find a camp for his kid. He came away disappointed and without an answer.\n\nHe ended his review with a question for Quora: \"Why not make this thing easier for normal people to figure out?”"
