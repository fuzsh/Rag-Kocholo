Not everything is managed through agents. Every organization uses a ‘parallel’ method to distribute packages / binaries. These binaries (mostly MSI) go down to machines that may or may not have agent installed. This gives IT admins more flexibility on managing their heterogeneous environment. It comes with limitation though. IT admins need parallel infrastructure. Think about a case when you can still have this ‘parallel process’ but it uses Marimba Infrastructure. Your team uses same packager to create installers. One common installer for machine with or without agent. And it uses the same infrastructure (Mirror/repeater). The download comes from the ‘right repeater’ and it uses global definition (bandwidth etc) © Copyright 8/21/2013 BMC Software, Inc 16\n\n17. A’less Deployment New Application Packager to allow ‘Generic’ installers These installers wont need a ‘tuner’ for installation User can browse transmitter, locate the channel and just ‘installs’ it on the machine (even when there is no tuner) The installer (comes in msi) will get installed on the machine. It will install package with all the settings that is defined in package (at the time of creating the package) After installation, it scan the machine, picks the software details and send it back to Inventory DB for tracking Administrator can query machines that install ‘Generic’ package. It can also help in tracking licenses All of it, without a tuner on the endpoint And it uses Marimba deployment infrastructure (Master / Mirror / Repeater) To be released during BETA © Copyright 8/21/2013 BMC Software, Inc 17\n\n18. www.CM-UG.com Configuration Management – User Group (formerly: Marimba Users Group) BBCA Training classes © Copyright August 21, 2013 Chris@CM-UG.com\n\n19. www.CM-UG.com Configuration Management – User Group (formerly: Marimba Users Group) CM-UG – Mailing List › User Email Group: – Sign up for the group email and subgroup emails here: http://Subscribe.CM-UG.com © Copyright August 21, 2013 Chris@CM-UG.com\n\n20. www.CM-UG.com Configuration Management – User Group (formerly: Marimba Users Group) CM-UG - User Interaction Join the LinkedIn Group = http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1774296 © Copyright August 21, 2013 Chris@CM-UG.com\n\n21. www.CM-UG.com Configuration Management – User Group (formerly: Marimba Users Group) CM-UG - User Interaction › BMC Developer Network Please register an account on the new BMC developer network.
