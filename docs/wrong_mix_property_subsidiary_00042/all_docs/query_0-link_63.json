        "text": "Overview:\n\nKeeping software updated in large pools of client devices such as laptops, PC’s, ATM’s, and kiosks is very time consuming and costly. The time it takes to manually deploy software patches and updates to vast numbers of clients impairs productivity. Clients that don’t have the latest patches are active security threats and hurt compliance. In large enterprises, automating client software management to improve speed and economy is a necessity.\n\nCelestix BMC Series appliances are the most cost-effective solution now available for providing the repeater function large enterprises need to deploy the BMC BladeLogic Client Automation system. Repeaters ensure that all managed client devices have current and compliant software. Celestix BMC Series appliances are the fast, easy, and economical way to insert repeaters into a BMC BladeLogic Client Automation infrastructure.\n\nAutomated Patch Management\n\nThe BMC BladeLogic Client Automation Patch Management Module that resides in Celestix BMC Series appliances is an extension to the BMC BladeLogic Client Automation (formerly Marimba) solution, which automates the entire lifecycle management of client devices. This system helps organizations:\n\nProvide patch and security compliance by detecting vulnerabilities and performing auto-remediation\n\nDramatically lower maintenance and support costs\n\nMaximize productivity via continuous patch management regardless of client location or access\n\nAutomatically verify and report on the compliance status of any system under management\n\nSimplifying the BladeLogic Patch Manager Repeater\n\nCelestix BMC appliances significantly reduce the time and risk of deploying BladeLogic Patch Manager Repeater nodes. BMC Series appliances come preconfigured with a hardened Linux operating system, appliance engine/UI, and BMC BladeLogic Patch Manager software. In a matter of minutes, Celestix BMC Series appliances are up, running, and connected to the BladeLogic Patch Management network, which greatly cuts the cost and time of deployment.\n\nCelestix repeaters include integrated update, configuration, and management tools embedded in an industry-standard web user interface, which provides a set of commands, reporting, alerting, and other core tools to ease administrators into routine management and use.\n\nCelestix Appliance Optimization\n\nCelestix purpose-builds their 5th generation 3500 appliance hardware to optimize the performance of BMC BladeLogic software and to deliver high reliability year after year. The Celestix 3500 appliance platform uses high-speed, highthroughput architecture and components throughout—without exteraneous components that add cost and complexity. You receive the performance you want with minimal points of vulnerability as compared to generic-server deployments.\n\nCelestix’ COSMOS appliance engine software delivers industry-leading features for fast, easy deployment and administration.\n\nWeb UI for convenient remote management of application and appliance\n\n1-button rollback to factory presets for fast, easy recovery\n\nJog dial and front panel display for fast deployment and easy on-site administration\n\nWhy Appliance?\n\nCelestix develops hardware platforms that ensure optimal performance and exceptional ease-of-use. Our appliances offer many competitive advantages for BMC deployments, including:\n\nProcurement\n\nWith BMC appliances you purchase integrated solutions from one source that are ready to use straight from the box. Otherwise, you purchase separate hardware, operating system, and BMC components—with each part requiring multiple levels of approval.\n\nCelestix Appliance Hardware\n\nCelestix purpose-builds their 5th generation X4 appliance hardware to optimize the performance of BMC BladeLogic software and to deliver high reliability year after year. The Celestix X4 appliance platform uses high-speed, high throughput architecture and components throughout—without exteraneous components that add cost and complexity. You receive the performance you want with minimal points of vulnerability as compared to generic-server deployments.\n\nCOSMOS Appliance Engine\n\nBased on a Linux kernel, the COSMOS engine provides several unique features for ease of use:\n\nJog Dial and LCD display enables headless communication with the network to set up, manage, and monitor the appliance on site.\n\nWeb UI to manage each BMC appliance for: simple setup, remote configuration of network settings, options to view logs/reboot/receive alerts/updating software, and others.\n\nDisaster Recovery – Each BMC appliance includes Last Good Version (LGV) functionality. LGV allows administrators to backup and restore units to predefined recovery points. You can also reset BMC appliance to factory default settings using Celestix' one button rollback feature.\n\nSoftware Update System – receive pre-screened updates and patches to all appliance software layers—OS, Appliance Engine, and BMC application—from one convenient management interface.\n\nOptimization and Security\n\nCelestix preconfigures each BMC appliance with a transmitter that extends the BMC Configuration Automation for Clients implementation. Celestix has optimized and hardened the operating-system and configuration options specifically for the BMC Configuration Automation for Clients solution.\n\nTime\n\nWith the BMC appliance there is no need to dedicate long hours of staff time to configure individual whiteboxes to act as repeaters for BMC Configuration Automation for Clients. Celestix has completed the packaging to minimize the burden on IT staff."
