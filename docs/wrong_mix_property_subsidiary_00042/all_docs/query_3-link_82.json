Tickets also available at may at the door for $15.\n\nThis year’s show theme is Por las Décadas (Through the Decades) featuring:\n\nMusical tributes to the decades of the 1940s through 1990s.\n\nSix Traditional Folk-Dance Regions: Aguascalientes, Coahuila, Tabasco, Nayarit, Veracruz, and Zoot Suit\n\n“The Big Show is truly a wonderful experience to be a part of, since our performance not only helps bring the hidden gems of Mexican culture to the community, but also helps us students embrace the gems of heritage and culture we find within ourselves as well,” said group president said Diego Melgoza, a senior, who is a folklórico dancer and trumpet player.\n\n“We’ve put a lot of love and effort into this show, so I hope our community will see our hard work bear fruit with our music and dance.”\n\n“Step into the magic of our 45th Big Show, a historic event that captures the heart and soul of our folklórico adventure,” said Brandee Tovar-Morales, a junior, folklórico dancer, and group treasurer. “Each twirl, stomp, and vivid costume tells a story of dedication, perseverance, and an unwavering passion for maintaining our cultural heritage.\n\n“As we take the stage again, we share a moment of reflection, thanks, and delight with our audience. Join us for our 45th Big Show, where we will celebrate tradition, embrace community, and create lasting memories.”"
