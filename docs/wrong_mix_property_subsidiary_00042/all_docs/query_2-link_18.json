(NYSE: BMC), a leading provider of enterprise management solutions, and Red Hat, Inc. (Nasdaq: RHAT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions to the enterprise, today announced that Red Hat has become the BMC Software Business Service Management (BSM) Foundation partner for Linux. Combined with BMC Software's long-standing support of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux platform, BMC Software and Red Hat will work together to enable companies to move beyond traditional IT management to better control their critical services from a business perspective, as part of BMC Software's BSM strategy. Extending its existing leadership position in the Linux market, the first component of this enhanced partnership will be an integrated cross-platform change and configuration management solution, based on BMC Software's Marimba® Configuration Discovery and Automation solutions and Red Hat Network, to manage and control application and patch changes to the IT environment. BSM Foundation Partners are industry segment leaders who have closely collaborated with BMC Software to create products and services that extend BSM solutions. Red Hat, a recognized leader in open source, is working with BMC Software in the areas of Linux and open source technology support, sales and marketing to extend BSM. The new aspect of the partnership will focus on delivering business-aware change and configuration management solutions and will include three key areas of collaboration:     *  Tighter integration between the Marimba Server and Client Management solutions by BMC Software and Red Hat Network in the areas of application management, patch management and configuration discovery     *  Integration between Remedy(R) Change Management and Red Hat Network (RHN), enabling dynamic change management workflow     *  Collaboration on industry-standards in the areas of systems management and software packaging. The initial collaboration, available in the first half of 2005, will link Marimba's Patch Management from BMC Software with Red Hat Network, providing customers with the following benefits:     *  A comprehensive cross-platform patch management solution across Windows, Unix and Linux systems     *  The ability to deploy software, both rpm as well as non-rpm packages, to Linux, Windows and Unix systems from a single point of control     *  The ability for customers to effectively use Marimba Patch Management by BMC Software in conjunction with Red Hat Network     *  Comprehensive cross-platform discovery and capture of critical licensing and registration information     *  The ability for enterprise customers to accurately report on the Red Hat Network registration status of Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems on the network Comprehensive Patch Management Reduces Downtime and Business Risks \"Intel has worked extensively with both BMC and Red Hat to enable software solutions that increase IT's value to the business both by improving performance and lowering the total cost of ownership.

Administrators can view a normalized display of all patch data, including patch dependencies, and can customize the patch information such as severity levels and descriptions. Administrators can then deploy patches based on security policies for ongoing operations or specific tasks for emergency deployments. \"As deployments of Red Hat technologies continue their rapid adoption in Enterprise computing infrastructures, integration of the Red Hat Network with BMC Software's BSM solutions will enable customers to implement more manageable and secure systems,\" said Alex Pinchev, executive vice president, Worldwide Sales at Red Hat. \"When a customer has a holistic view of the business infrastructure, organizations are then able to focus on scaling for future growth.\" BSM solutions provide a consolidated view of business and IT operations, tightly linking IT resources to business objectives and managing those resources based on business priorities. In support of BSM, the integration will deliver comprehensive change and configuration management capabilities, which deliver impact analysis and risk mitigation by making patch management seamless across open source and proprietary OS environments.
