        "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Global product development and innovation partner, Symphony Teleca Corporation (STC), today announced it will host the Symphony Teleca Confluence, bringing together Marimba users worldwide to network, discuss business operation challenges and get excited about the company's revolutionary product roadmap. The event will take place June 11-12, 2014 at the Marriott at Legacy Town Center in Dallas/Plano, Texas.\n\nMarimba helps IT departments ensure end-user security and corporate policy adherence by automating client management processes. Standing as a robust, customizable and extensive management platform for driving IT configuration and deployment needs, it is the tool of choice for automating patch deployments, asset discovery, license compliance, and numerous other IT processes that are critical to many organizations. Symphony Teleca took full ownership of BMC's Marimba product line in early 2013, providing full development support activities, and is planning to announce the release of Symphony Marimba Client Automation v8.5 ­ scheduled to be available to customers in December 2014.\n\nSymphony Teleca has demonstrated significant investment in the Marimba product line, opening a dedicated innovation lab where a talented team of experts are researching new feature sets and making the Marimba platform cloud-ready by extending support for Mobile Device Management. The company also recently launched a rapid development platform that allows Marimba customers the ability to customize the solution to their needs on-site in significantly less time. With an unprecedented, 24/7 support staff available to Marimba users, Symphony Teleca delivers the necessary foundation for customers' organizational success.\n\n\"As a long time advocate, I am excited to see Symphony Teleca place such an excellent team and significant amount of effort behind the Marimba product line. I believe we will see many new customers implementing the latest release, and our current customers who already understand the value included with Marimba will renew for years to come, \" said Chris Armstrong, Enterprise Architect, CM-UG chair, CISSP. \"The amount of customer interaction, support, and feedback has dramatically increased in the last 12 months and the Marimba meet up held at the Symphony Teleca offices in Dallas/Plano, Texas shows how committed the team is to a bright future in configuration management.\"\n\n“I have been automating processes for more than 10 years with the Marimba product line, with four of those at my current company. We have been able to reduce complexity, homogenize, and secure our environment allowing IT resources to focus on supporting and growing the business,\" said Eric Hoffman, Senior Systems Engineer at Dick’s Sporting Goods. \"We are excited to see Symphony Teleca’s vision for the product moving forward as we feel it will make an even more compelling case for Marimba in any environment. The Symphony Teleca Confluence will be a great opportunity to meet both peers in the industry using the product, as well as the people behind the Marimba product itself.”\n\nThe event will bring together existing Marimba customers to generate fruitful discussion that will inform Symphony Teleca as it continues delivering on its commitment to providing the best product features and enhancements. Symphony Teleca will also share its future revolutionary vision for Marimba with attendees.\n\n\"We love hearing the success stories of our esteemed Marimba customers and want to bring to light the new and exciting things in store for the product line,\" said Sandeep Kalra, EVP and General Manager, Symphony Teleca. \"Our team looks forward to sharing best practices to help customers and prospects understand the true power of Marimba and the bright future it has in the years to come.\"\n\nAbout Symphony Teleca\n\nSymphony Teleca Corporation (STC), headquartered in Mountain View, Calif., is a global innovation and development services company.
