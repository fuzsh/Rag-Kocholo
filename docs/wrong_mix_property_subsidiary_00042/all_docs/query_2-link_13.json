        "text": "BMC Software Inc. today announced a set of change and configuration management products that will be shipped later this summer and in the fall.\n\nThe new Configuration Discovery product is timed to coincide with BMC’s acquisition of Marimba Inc. in July, said Harold Goldberg, vice president of BMC marketing.\n\nConfiguration Discovery will be part of the new BMC IT Discovery Suite. In addition to Configuration Discovery, which defines how IT assets are configured, BMC will announce two other products this fall, Goldberg said. All three parts of the suite will populate a standards-based Configuration Management Database.\n\nPeter Pace, manager of change management for United.com and related Web sites run by United Air Lines Inc., said he plans to evaluate the new tools further once they are available.\n\nUnited has used BMC’s Change Management 5.0 for more than a year to predict how a system will perform if part of it is taken down for routine maintenance, a common occurrence that caused disruptions in the past. “It’s a very flexible and easy-to-use tool, and it automates a lot of our processes,” Pace said.\n\nUnited’s adoption of of Change Management, which BMC acquired through the purchase of Remedy nearly two years ago, “is having a positive impact” and has even led to end users praising IT staffers for giving them more control over systems, Pace said. “We’re now viewed as an enabler of getting things done,” he said."
