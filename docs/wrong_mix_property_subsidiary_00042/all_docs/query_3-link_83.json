        "text": "Testimonials from parents of Sue Ford’s former students:\n\n“My son has had such a wonderful experience in marimba. It gave him the freedom and confidence not only to play but to compose music as well. It was a refuge and Sue’s gentle leadership was a blessing.” (B)\n\n“For our son, a young person with social challenges yet who possesses natural musical ability, Marimba Band is a positive experience that provides an outlet for musical expression, collaboration and building friendships. The discipline of learning marimba repertoire and the interdependence of the instruments comes together in joyful performances that showcase the young musicians' dynamic teamwork. Sue Ford is magical and young musicians respond to her relaxed way of teaching, as well as her ability to treat them as mature, responsible young people. \" (MA)\n\n“My daughter has gained knowledge of rhythm, beats, cultures, and musicality in a format that is fun, engaging, and authentic. She has loved being with Ms. Sue and playing in a band with her friends. It has been a priceless opportunity that I feel she has been blessed to experience.” (HT)\n\n“I truly feel that marimba has changed my son’s life. I tell people it was the first thing that he could work at and really see steady improvement in his life. His severe dyslexia has always made school an exercise in frustration despite his obvious intelligence. And sports have always come somewhat easily. But marimba was a challenge that he could stretch into and achieve a dream/goal. “ (MB)"
