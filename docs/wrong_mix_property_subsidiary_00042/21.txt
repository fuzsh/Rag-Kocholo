Management software maker BMC Software Inc. will spend $239 million to buy configuration software developer Marimba Inc., the companies announced today.

Marimba’s discovery and provisioning tools will be a good complement for BMC’s Remedy service and support applications, BMC CEO Bob Beauchamp said in a statement. He touted the acquisition as a way to expand BMC’s portfolio and Marimba’s market reach.

BMC paid a significant premium over Marimba’s market price: BMC will pay $8.25 in cash for shares that ended trading Wednesday on the Nasdaq Stock Market at $4.87. Mountain View, Calif.-based Marimba brings to the merger $52.9 million in cash and equivalents, leaving BMC with a net purchase price it estimated at around $187 million. Houston-based BMC had $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents on hand as of March 31. Pending approvals from regulators and Marimba’s shareholders, BMC expects the deal to close in its second quarter, which ends Sept. 30.

BMC and Marimba today both announced results for the quarter that ended March 31. BMC reported earnings of $36.9 million on revenue of $400.2 million, up 5% from last year. Marimba showed a net loss of $1.2 million on revenue of $8.3 million, down 19%.

Executives from the companies planned to hold a conference call later today to discuss the acquisition.
