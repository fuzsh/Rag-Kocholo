BMC Software and Marimba have announced a merger agreement under which BMC Software will acquire Marimba for $8.25 per share, according to a media release from BMC Software.

BMC Software, which provides enterprise management solutions, said the acquisition of Marimba, which provides products and services for software change and configuration management, would help enterprises build solutions that simplify IT operations, and consolidate its position in Business Service Management.

BMC Software's Remedy business unit delivers Service Management software solutions that enable organisations to automate and manage internal and external service and support processes.

The deal will aid BMC Software's server software distribution and patch management, and broaden Marimba's customer base, the release claims.

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval of the regulatory authority and Marimba's stockholders. BMC Software expects the transaction to close in its second fiscal quarter.
