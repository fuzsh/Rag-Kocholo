Mary of Teck (born May 26, 1867, Kensington Palace, London—died March 24, 1953, London) was the queen consort of King George V of Great Britain and the mother of kings Edward VIII (afterward duke of Windsor) and George VI.

Mary was the only daughter of Prinz (Prince; or, after 1871, Herzog [Duke]) von Teck, who was a member of the royal house of Württemberg. She was also a great-granddaughter of George III of Great Britain.

In 1891 Mary became engaged to Albert Victor, duke of Clarence (elder son of the Prince of Wales, afterward King Edward VII), but he died a few weeks before the marriage was to have taken place. Later, she was engaged to and, on July 6, 1893, married the duke’s younger brother, George, duke of York, prince of Wales from 1901 and king from 1910.
