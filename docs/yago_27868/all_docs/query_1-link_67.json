That shows how little the world really knows what it is talking about.”\n\n- George to Mary\n\n“I am only looking forward to the time when you and I shall be alone at Sandringham. [...] I am very sorry that I am still so shy with you, I tried not to be so the other day, but alas failed, I was angry with myself! It is so stupid to be so stiff together and really there is nothing I would not tell you, except that I love you more than anybody in the world, and this I cannot tell you myself, so I write it to relieve my feelings.”\n\n- Mary to George, 1893\n\n“Thank God we both understand each other, and I think it really unnecessary for me to tell you how deep my love for you my darling is and I feel it growing stronger and stronger every time I see you; although I may appear shy and cold.”\n\n- George to Mary, 1893\n\n“I saw in you the person I was capable of loving most deeply, if you only returned that love [...] I have tried to understand you, and with the happy result that I know now that I do love you, darling girl, with all my heart, and am simply devoted to you. I adore you, sweet May.”\n\n- George to Mary, 1893\n\n“My darling sweet Tootsums I have been thinking so much of you today, oh, if you only know how I love love you my precious one & how I long be with you again, I shall count the hours till we meet. God bless you my own sweet wife with a kiss for your lovely little face from yr ever most loving & devoted husband.”\n\n- George to Mary, 26th November 1894\n\n“Darling May will be my comfort as she always has been.”\n\n- George, 1910\n\n“I found Queen Mary calm and composed, carrying out her duties with quiet competence and dignity, comforting her children, thinking of everyone but herself. But behind the facade of self-control was passionate grief for the husband who has been the center of her life for over forty years.“\n\n- Mabell, Countess of Airlie [after George’s death]"
