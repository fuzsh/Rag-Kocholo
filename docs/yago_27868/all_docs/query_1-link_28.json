It is fitting, therefore, that this happy union\n\nshould have been the result of one of the most romantic\n\nand touching love stories ever recorded.\n\nFor years it had been apparent to all observers that\n\nPrince George was more than ordinarily attracted to\n\nPrincess May. But, as with all women, the Princess's\n\nheart was in her own keeping, and rumor had it that\n\nthe Princess had fallen in love with Prince George's\n\nelder brother, the Duke of Clarence.\n\nWHEN the engagement of\n\nthe Duke and the Princess\n\nwas announced there were na-\n\ntional rejoicings, and Prince\n\nGeorge was the first to extend\n\nhis congratulations to the happy\n\npair.\n\nHow the Duke of Clarence suddenly\n\ndied from influenza in 1892 just when\n\nhis fiancee was busy making her\n\npreparations for the wedding, is now\n\nalmost national history.\n\nThe blow to young Prince George\n\nand Princess May was severe indeed,\n\nand it was their sense of common loss\n\nwhich brought them closer together\n\nthan they had ever been.\n\nPRINCE GEORGE was compelled to\n\nretire from the Navy, a step which\n\ngave him a hard wrench, and in a few\n\nweeks this practically unknown sailor\n\nPrince stepped into the fierce limelight\n\nof Royalty. He was now second in\n\ndirect succession to the Throne.\n\nIn the space of a few months he\n\nbecame the Duke of York, Earl of\n\nInverness, and Baron Killarney, and his\n\nevery movement in public was photo-\n\ngraphed and chronicled in the Press.\n\nIt was indeed a dramatic change for\n\na man who was looking forward to a\n\ncareer in his beloved Navy, and Prince\n\nGeorge by no means relished the trans-\n\nformation.\n\nHe knew that all the publicity and\n\nattention he was receiving was due to\n\nhis changed status, and as a blunt sailor\n\nhe valued it at what it was worth.\n\nAfter the Royal bereavement the Prince\n\nspent more and more time with Prin-\n\ncess May.\n\nIt was he who suggested that she\n\nshould go abroad for a complete change\n\nand rest, and the Duchess of Teck and\n\nher daughter took his advice. They\n\nwent to Paris and Cannes, and for nearly\n\na year settled down in the South of\n\nFrance.\n\nIt is said that the Prince wrote three\n\ntimes a week to the stricken Princess,\n\nand he made more than one trip over,\n\n\"incognito,\" to cheer and comfort her.\n\nThe Prince was then in his 28th year,\n\nand a man of the world. Yet he needed\n\nhelp and sympathy in the new role he\n\nhad to fill, and this he found in abund-\n\nance in Princess May and her kind and\n\npractical mother.\n\n\"I never thought that George was so\n\ntactful and understanding,\" remarked\n\nthe Duchess of Teck once to Queen\n\nAlexandra, who was delighted at the\n\ncompliment to her only surviving son.\n\nIn the Garden\n\nWHEN the Duchess and her daughter\n\nreturned home, the Duke of York\n\nwas the first to welcome them in London,\n\nand he became almost a daily visitor\n\nat White Lodge.\n\nIn the lovely gardens around\n\nthe residence the future King\n\nGeorge V wooed and won his\n\nboyhood sweetheart. It is said\n\nthat it was in a secluded part of\n\nRichmond Park that the actual\n\nproposal was made.\n\nHer year of grief had convinced Prin-\n\ncess May that her late fiance's brother\n\nwas a man who was genuinely devoted\n\nto her. The wife of a certain American\n\nAmbassador has recorded that in an\n\nintimate conversation with Queen Mary,\n\nHer Majesty declared that the Duke of\n\nClarence's death revealed to her for\n\nthe first time the love and devotion of\n\nnone Help\n\n[ABOVE: The present King and Queen photographed at the time of their\n\nwedding 42 years ago.

It says a great deal for\n\nthe love and tact of King George that\n\nhe was able to surmount this barrier.\n\n\"I am the happiest man in the world,\"\n\nhe exclaimed when a group of naval\n\nofficers entertained him to a private\n\ndinner at Portsmouth just after the an-\n\nnouncement of his engagement on May\n\n3, 1893.\n\nIT was long rumored in the Navy that\n\nthe Prince had proposed to Princess\n\nMay when he was 20, but that was prob-\n\nably a naval yarn. There is a story, how-\n\never, that as children the present King\n\nand Queen went through a mock\n\nmarriage in the garden of the White\n\nLodge, and there is one old lady still\n\nliving who swears that she witnessed it.\n\nQueen Mary is too practical to be\n\nsuperstitious, but once, as a girl, she had\n\nher hand read by a palmist at a garden\n\nparty, and she was told that she would\n\nfind great happiness after great sorrow,\n\nand hat she would live to a ripe old\n\nage.\n\nIt is said that it was in thc third\n\nweek of April, 1893, that the Prince made\n\n[SOME of the many\n\nwedding presents\n\nwhich were\n\nshowered on the\n\nRoyal pair from\n\nevery part of the\n\nglobe. A pair of\n\ngold opera glasses\n\nstudded with pearls\n\nand diamonds, a\n\npiano built like an\n\nold spinet, and a\n\nsolid silver dental\n\noutfit.]\n\nhis successful proposal, and, according\n\nto Court gossip, the anniversary of the\n\ndate is still celebrated by the King and\n\nQueen. On the evening of the day in\n\nquestion, only close relatives and intim-\n\nate friends of the King are invited to\n\ndinner, and His Majesty proposes the\n\ntoast of the Queen.\n\nLove stories of British royalties are\n\nnot made public, and only posterity will\n\nbe privileged, perhaps, to know the inner\n\ndetails of the romance of King George\n\nand Queen Mary, and what a wonderful\n\nstory it will make!\n\nThe Duchess of Teck, Queen Victoria.\n\nKing Edward and Queen Alexandra, and\n\nthe Duke of Edinburgh—Prince George's\n\nuncle—all had a part to play in en-\n\ncouraging the match, and that was all\n\nthat was needed to spur on the Royal\n\nsuitor.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh was the\n\nfavorite elder relative of Prince George,\n\nand his death in 1900 was a blow that\n\nPrince George felt severely.\n\nA sailor like himself, the Duke had\n\nnone Help\n\nnone Help\n\na great love and admiration for his\n\nnephew, and it showed what the Prince\n\nthought of his uncle when he asked him\n\nto be his \"supporter\" at his wedding.\n\nThe Duke gladly agreed.\n\nOnce the engagement was announced,\n\nevents moved swiftly. The marriage\n\nceremony was fixed for July 6 and the\n\nvenue the Prince selected was the Chapel\n\nRoyal, St. James. This, being a small\n\nand private chapel, did not meet with\n\nthe approval of the public, but both\n\nPrince George and Princess May wanted\n\nas quiet a wedding as possible, and held\n\nfirmly to their choice.\n\nDuring the period between the en-\n\ngagement and the wedding the betrothed\n\npair saw each other every day, and every\n\nmorning a bouquet of rare flowers ar-\n\nrived for the Princess from her fiance.\n\nA card or a note with a personal mes-\n\nsage always accompanied the flowers,\n\nwhich were picked from the gardens at\n\nSandringham by the Prince and sent by\n\nspecial messenger to White Lodge.\n\nPlease turn to Page 27\n\nTHE LOVE STORY of the KING\n\nand QUEEN\n\nContinued from Page 25\n\nIN the arrangements and pur-\n\nchases for the wedding the\n\nengaged couple showed patriotic\n\nspirit. The Queen—even as a bride—\n\nshowed her preference for British goods,\n\nand her wonderful wedding-dress was\n\ncomposed of materials from Scotland,\n\nEngland, and Ireland.\n\n\"I have bought nothing but British\n\nmade articles for fifty years,\" quietly\n\nremarked the Queen at a recent in-\n\ndustrial exhibition, and it was a per-\n\nfectly true statement.\n\nIt is said that, contrary to superstition,\n\nthe Queen donned her wedding-dress in\n\nfull the day prior to the ceremony, and\n\nher bridegroom cast a critical eye over\n\nit as well!\n\nThe actual wedding arrangements\n\nwere very well organised. King George\n\neven as a young man, had that passion\n\nfor smoothness and efficiency in public\n\nceremonies which he has to-day, and\n\nclose on midnight on the eve of his\n\nwedding he paid a private visit to the\n\nChapel Royal and took careful note of\n\nall the arrangements and positions. The\n\nwedding passed off without a hitch.\n\nQueen Victoria was so anxious to see\n\nher grandson getting married that she\n\narrived at the Chapel before even the\n\nwedding ushers! There were a great\n\nnumber of distinguished foreign guests,\n\nincluding the King and Queen of Den-\n\nmark and the future Czar of Russia,\n\nlater assassinated by the Bolsheviks.\n\nNo fewer than ten bridesmaids at-\n\ntended the bride, and the scene during\n\nthe ceremony was one of dazzling splen-\n\ndor.\n\n\"I'm so glad the sun is shining,\" ex-\n\nclaimed the bride as she drove to the\n\nceremony and it was indeed a happy\n\nand true omen of the future.\n\nThe London crowds gave the newly\n\nmarried Royal pair a tremendous re-\n\nception after the wedding, and at night\n\nthe illuminations were on a magnificent\n\nscale.\n\nTHE young couple spent their honey-\n\nmoon at York Cottage, a modest resi-\n\ndence on the Sandringham estate, and\n\na house destined to be their permanent\n\nhome for eight years. At York Cot-\n\ntage the Duke and Duchess of York were\n\nallowed ample privacy, although thou-\n\nsands of messages of congratulation were\n\nsent to them.\n\nThe King was especially well known\n\nto the tenants on the Sandringham es-\n\ntate, and there are many still living who\n\ncan recall the happy Royal couple on\n\ntheir honeymoon.\n\n\"I saw them once running in the woods\n\nhand in hand.\" said an old Sandring-\n\nham cottager a little time ago, while\n\nanother recalled seeing the King and\n\nQueen having an informal picnic by\n\nthemselves.\n\nThe married life of the future King\n\nGeorge and Queen Mary opened under\n\nthe happiest auspices, and soon under\n\nits influence the Queen was to shed\n\nsome of her gravity and reserve, and the\n\nKing some of his lack of self-confidence\n\nand timidity.\n\n\"You are like me, you have a good\n\nwife,\" said the King once to a miner in\n\nthe North whose humble home he had\n\nvisited and admired for its comfort and\n\ncleanliness.\n\nHe married for love and his has been\n\na lifelong romance over which neither\n\nhe nor the Queen has one single re-\n\ngret.\n\nIf you searched the country you\n\nwould not find a happier pair, for\n\ntheir love has grown with the\n\nyears, and has been sustained\n\nduring twenty-five momentous\n\nyears on the throne of the\n\ngreatest Empire in the world."
