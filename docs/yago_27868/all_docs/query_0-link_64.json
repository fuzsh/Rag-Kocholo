        "text": "Today marks the anniversary of the birth of Queen Mary, the late Queen Elizabeth II’s grandmother. A formidable character who became the matriarch of the Royal Family, Princess Victoria Mary of Teck was born at Kensington Palace on 26 May 1867 in the same room where Queen Victoria (who was a distant cousin) had been born 40 years prior.\n\nIn 1891, aged 24, Mary was betrothed to her second cousin once removed, Prince Albert, eldest son of the then Prince of Wales (future King Edward VII). However, six weeks after the announcement of the engagement, Prince Albert died unexpectedly during an influenza pandemic. The following year, Mary became engaged to his only surviving brother, Prince George (future King George V), marrying him in 1893. When he became Prince of Wales in 1901, she became Princess of Wales.\n\nIn 1910, following the death of his father, King Edward VII, King George V acceded to the throne and Mary became Queen. In 1936, her husband died, and was succeeded by her son, Edward VIII, until he abdicated in favour of his brother, George VI, in order to marry Wallis Simpson. When Queen Mary’s granddaughters, Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, were born, she took an active interest in their lives, taking them to London to visit art galleries and museums. She died on 24 March 1953 at the age of 85, 10 weeks before her granddaughter Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation.\n\nNow, on the anniversary of her birth, Tatler takes a look at some of the most glittering diadems worn by Queen Mary, which later became favourites of the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe Queen Mary Fringe Tiara\n\nThis was worn by Queen Elizabeth II on her wedding day, but on the morning of her wedding, the then Princess Elizabeth, heir to the throne, was unaware that her tiara was also a necklace, and accidentally touched the clasp. Luckily, royal jeweller Garrard was on hand to fix it, with the Queen adding, ‘I think he taped up the spring’. The Queen Mother reportedly remained calm as ever, saying: ‘We have two hours and there are other tiaras.’\n\nRead More\n\nPrincess Minnie de Beauvau-Craon, châtelaine of the magnificent Château de Haroué, dies aged 70\n\nThe princess, whose title was only honorific, oversaw Château de Haroué, which hosted Hubert de Givenchy and the Queen Mother\n\nThe Queen Mary Fringe tiara was also worn by Princess Beatrice on her wedding day in 2020, and by Princess Anne, who wore it on her wedding day in 1973. One of its last outings before Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi’s wedding in July 2020 was the Queen’s 2011 Diamond Jubilee Portrait for New Zealand.\n\nThe Vladimir Tiara\n\nQueen Mary purchased the Vladimir tiara following the death of the rather glamorous Grand Duchess Vladimir, the wife of the Tsar’s uncle, Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia, who lived between 1854 and 1920 and was known for her impressive collection of jewels.\n\nRead More\n\nThe Queen Consort’s coronation crown has a fascinating history\n\nThe Queen Consort’s coronation crown was originally worn by Queen Mary, the wife of King George V. Tatler delves into its intriguing history\n\nThe tiara was made for the duchess by court jewellers Bolin. When it arrived, the Vladimir tiara had been damaged in transit, so Queen Mary elected to have it repaired by Garrard, also adding 15 of her own emeralds, plus a mechanism to make it possible to switch from emeralds to the original pearls easily.\n\nIn 1988, Queen Elizabeth II had it repaired again, this time updating the frame. It was eventually passed from Mary to her granddaughter, who wore it frequently. Indeed, it was thought to be her favourite headpiece due to the number of occasions that she wore it, including during a 1963 trip to New Zealand.\n\nThe Girls of Great Britain and Ireland Tiara\n\nThis tiara, which was made by royal jeweller Garrard, was commissioned by the Girls of Great Britain and Ireland (a fundraising committee chaired by Lady Eva Greville, daughter of the 4th Earl of Warwick) as a gift to Princess Mary before her wedding to Prince Albert, the heir to the British throne – who died before the nuptials aged just 28.\n\nSo successful was the committee’s fundraising to purchase the tiara, that a £3,000 surplus was donated, at Mary’s request, to the widows and children of 350 lost sailors after the HMS Victoria maritime disaster in 1893. Designed to be transformable, the festoon-and-scroll diamond tiara can be worn as either a necklace or coronet and over the years Queen Mary requested that Garrard replace the original pearls with diamonds and separate the bandeau from the base so that she could wear it as a headband.\n\nIn 1947, Queen Mary gave the tiara to Princess Elizabeth as a wedding present and in 1969 the late Queen Elizabeth II asked for the bandeau and tiara to be reunited, as it remains today. It is seen everyday on English coins and banknotes, and was worn in the late Queen Elizabeth’s official accession photographs in 1952. She wore it more frequently for royal duties than any of her other jewels."
