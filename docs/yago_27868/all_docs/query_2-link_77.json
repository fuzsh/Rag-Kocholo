        "text": "Nine stars\n\nAs my 2017 biography binge winds down, so does my current exploration of the modern British monarchy. I have been lucky to collect a number of biographical pieces that link together, from George III and his daughters, to Victoria, to her five consort granddaughters, and now to Mary of Teck. Queen Mary’s life is an interesting piece of biographical glue all her own: great- granddaughter to George III, niece to Victoria, a fellow Queen consort, and the grandmother to Elizabeth II. Anne Edwards pulls all this together and formulates a fabulous biography of the women who stood by George V as the House of Windsor evolved while erasing its Germanic titular foundation. Mother to two kings and a woman of some intellectual renown all her own, Mary of Teck proved to be more that the ‘poodle-like’ coiffure for which she is known. She will surely go down in history has have many strong links during the late 19th and well into the 20th century, shaping the modern British Royal Family. A great piece for the curious reader, especially one such as myself who has seen this monarchical period from many angles already.\n\nBorn Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes in 1867, this Princess of Teck (who went by Mary or ‘May’) was raised in England and lived her entire life there. Daughter of Francis, Duke of Teck, and Princess Mary Adelaide, a granddaughter of George III, Mary had regal blood coursing through her. As a young princess, she proved highly intelligent and apt with numbers and engaging with others on a social basis, though Edwards does not spend much time on these early years. One theme that does pervade the early narrative is Mary’s desire to one day become Queen of England, married to the reigning monarch. At 24, Mary was betrothed to the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, Prince Eddie, but their engagement ended when he died of pneumonia. Still harbouring this queenly desire, Mary sought to win the heart of the next son of the Prince of Wales, the boisterous George. Mary and George quickly fell in love after Queen Victoria encouraged the royal cousins together and they married in 1893. They established themselves quickly with two sons, David and Albert ‘Bertie’, before adding three more boys and a single princess. George and Mary lived happily in successive titles as Duke and Duchess of York, then Cambridge, and eventually Prince and Princess of Wales, after Edward VII ascended to the Throne. Edwards speaks highly of Mary’s abilities to keep her family running smoothly, while devoting herself to George. The narrative builds on a tangential topic of the boys upbringing, with David and Bertie proving to be polar opposites. While David excelled at sport and in the classroom, Bertie developed a strong stutter and clung to the bottom rung of the scholastic rankings, something that would haunt him for much of his life, always living in the shadows of his father and elder brother. However, Mary would offer love to her children as best she could, including her youngest, Prince John, whose childhood epilepsy left him out of the public eye before his death at age 14. When Edward VII died in 1910, Mary and George ascended to the Throne. Mary finally earned her life-long dream to be Queen of England, while George V’s nightmare began, as he had little interest in the position."
