Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing George V, born in 1865, was the first monarch of the House of Windsor.\n\nKing George V and his wife Mary of Teck had six children together between 1894 and 1905. One of their children didn't survive into adulthood. Prince John, the baby of the family, had severe epilepsy and a learning disability. He died in 1919 at the age of 13.\n\nTheir eldest son, King Edward VIII, inherited the throne upon his father's death in 1936. Had he remained king, Edward VIII's hypothetical descendants would have inherited the British Crown.\n\nBut Edward VIII abdicated in 1937 in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. The controversial couple — who were rumored to harbor Nazi sympathies — never had children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing George VI's descendants dominate the current line of succession.\n\nAfter his older brother's abdication, King George VI took to the throne for a reign of nearly 15 years. He and his wife Queen Elizabeth had two daughters, Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret.\n\nGeorge VI's descendants are set to continue to inherit the throne in the foreseeable future. His eldest daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, was the longest-reigning British monarch in history. She died on September 8, 2022, at the age of 96.\n\nHer son Charles, Prince of Wales, is set to inherit the throne, adopting the title of King Charles III.\n\nIn 2020, a Clarence House representative confirmed the 71-year-old heir tested positive for the coronavirus in a statement — he is \"displaying mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health.\"\n\nAfter him in the line of succession would come Prince William, and then his son Prince George.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle announced in an Instagram post on January 8, 2020 that they were taking a \"step back as 'senior members' of the Royal Family,\" so they could raise their son Archie with more privacy, splitting their time between the UK and North America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lascelles family is descended from King George V's only daughter, whose husband passes on the Earl of Harewood title.\n\nMary, Princess Royal, was George V's only daughter.\n\nShe had two sons with her husband, Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood. The princess's sons went on to produce six grandchildren, 17 great grandchildren, and nine great great grandchildren. The Earldom of Harewood is still held within the Lascelles family.\n\nThe eldest two children of David Lascelles, the current 8th Earl of Harewood, were born before Lascelles married his first wife. They were therefore unable to inherit his title.\n\nLeo Cyrus Anthony Lascelles, the only son of Alexander Lascelles, Viscount Lascelles, is also not eligible to inherit his family's royal title, as his parents were not married at the time of his birth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dukedom of Gloucester is still held by the descendants of Prince Henry, King George V's third son.\n\nPrince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, and his wife, Lady Alice Montagu Douglas Scott, had two sons together. One, the Prince William of Gloucester, died in a 1972 plane crash. He hadn't had any children, so the title passed onto his younger brother Richard.\n\nPrince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, inherited his father's dukedom and went on to have three children and six grandchildren.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince George's great grandson is set to eventually become the Duke of Kent — but he will never inherit the throne.\n\nPrince George, Duke of Kent, and his wife, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, had three children before he was killed in a 1942 military airplane crash.\n\nToday, he counts seven grandchildren and 16 great grandchildren among his descendants.\n\nEdward Windsor, Lord Downpatrick, and Lady Marina Charlotte Windsor are both confirmed Roman Catholics, meaning they are banned from succession to the Crown.\n\nHowever, Downpatrick is still in line to inherit the Dukedom of Kent. He will potentially become the first Catholic Duke of Kent in centuries.\n\nEditor's note, October 18, 2022: The graphic in this article has been updated with the correct surname of Lord Nicholas Windsor, not Lord Nicholas Taylor.\n\nRead next\n\nBritish Royal Family Royal Family Queen Elizabeth II\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
