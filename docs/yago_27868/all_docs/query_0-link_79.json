        "text": "(1865–1936)\n\nKing of the United Kingdom and Emperor of India (1910–36).\n\nHe was born at Marlborough House in London, the second son of Edward VII, with whom he had excellent relations. He served in the navy from 1877 to 1892, when his elder brother, the Duke of Clarence, died and George became heir apparent. In the following year he married Clarence's fiancée, Mary of Teck (1867–1953), and in 1901 was created Prince of Wales. A year after his accession to the throne he became the only Emperor of India to hold a coronation durbar (court) in the subcontinent – at Delhi in December 1911. In 1915, during World War I, while visiting his troops in France, he was thrown from his horse and severely injured, never fully recovering his strength. The inappropriateness of the royal surname – Saxe-Coburg – at a time of war with Germany caused him to adopt the name Windsor in 1917. George became enormously popular after the war and was to prove an excellent radio speaker, recording frequent messages, which were widely appreciated. The warmth of his 1935 Jubilee celebrations testified to the affection and respect he commanded. George was succeeded briefly by his eldest son Edward VIII (see Windsor, Duke of) and then by his second son, George VI."
