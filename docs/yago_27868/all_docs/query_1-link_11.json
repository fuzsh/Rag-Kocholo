        "text": "Queen Mary (1867-1953) Part 1\n\nQueen Mary (1867-1953)\n\nQueen Mary had a rocky beginning when Albert Victor, in line to inherit the crown, died right before their mairrage. It was decided that she should marry his younger brother George. Queen Mary was a diffident, shy woman. Except in photographs she was almost totally unknown to the British people. She set a social example even more formidable than that of her husband, who behaved in sharp contrast to his father. She was a strong if not always intimate influence on her children, including her grandchildren. Queen Mary, like King George, were both caring and loving when their children were young but appeared unable to express their feelings once the children grew up. After Queen Mary's death, Sir Winston Churchill paid Queen Mary the compliment: \"She looked like a Queen and she acted like a Queen\". The ocean liner, The Queen Mary was named after her.\n\nParents\n\nPrincess Mary was related to the British royal family through her mother. Her father was a rather inconsequential German aristocrat.\n\nFather\n\nMary's father was Franz Paul Karl Louis von Teck, 1st Duke/Prince of Teck who was born in 1837. Mary's father was the son of Duke Alexander of Wurttemberg and his morganatic wife, Countess Claudine Rhedey. He inherited a dark complexion and good looks from his mother. When his cousin became King of W?rttemberg he conferred on Franz the Dukedom of Teck, which was a subordinate title of the House of Wurttemberg. Franz had lost his inheritance through his father's morganatic marriage. He became an officer in the Austrian 7th Imperial Hussars. He had to live on his military pay and the bounty of the Austrian Emperor, with whom he was a favourite. The Prince of Wales (Edward VII) met Franz at Hannover in 1864 and invited him to England. It was there that Franz met Princess Mary of Cambridge whom he subsequently married. Franz had to resign from the Austrian Army after he mairred Princess Mary. They lived in England on the allowance granted by Parliament to the Princess. This dependence and the lack of a career adversely influenced his outlook on life and probably aggravated the outbursts of temper to which he was prone and which became more frequent as he grew older.\n\nMother\n\nMary's mother was Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, Princess of Great Britain (1833-97), a daughter of the Duke of Cambride, and thus the grandaughter of George III. Princess Mary was compassionate and an enormously fat extrovert who knew how to raise children. She was, however, extremely extravegent and the family ran into financial problems. To economise, the Duke and Duchess of Teck moved with their children to Florence where Mary acquired a lasting interest in art. As a young woman she displayed great tact.\n\nTeck\n\nTeck is an ancient German principality named after a castle built on \"The Teck\", a limestone peak buit in the Wabian Alps, 12 km southeast of Stuttgart. The principality was held by various families beginning about the 11th century. After 1498 the principality passed to the Dukes of Württenberg. We have little information on Teck and do not yet have a page in our section on the royal families of the German states.\n\nBirth\n\nPrincess Victoria Mary was born in Kensington Palace in 1867. She was christened Victoria Mary Augusta Louis Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes, but known as Princess \"May\" in the family.\n\nSiblings\n\nPrince Mary was the oldest child (1867- ). She had three younger brothers. Her different titles included: Princess May of Teck (1867-1893), Duchess of York (1893-1901), Princess of Wales (1901-1910); Queen Mary (1910-1936); Queen Mother (1936-1953). Her brothers were: Cambridge, Adolphus II of Teck, Duke of Teck (1868- ); Francis Joseph Leopold Frederick of Teck, Prince, Major Dragoons (1870- ), and Cambridge, Alexander George of Teck, 1st Earl of Athlone 1st (1874- ). The only sibling we have any information on is Alexander. He was born in Kensington Palace and became a soldier. He waseduvated at Eton and the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. He became a captain in the 7th Hussars and in the Royal House Guards and later was brevetted lieutenany colonel in the 2nd Life Guards. He served in South Africa/Matabeland (1896), Boer War (1899-1900), and in World War I (1914-15), receiving hionoravle mention in dispatches. He was highly decorated in the Boer War. He mairred Princess Alice, daughter of the Prince Leopold (Duke of Albany) and granddaughter of Queen Victoria. He served as Governor General in South Africa after World War I (1923-31). He then served in several prestigious positions, including Governopr of Windsor Castle (1931), Chancelloe of London University (1932), and Frand Master of the Order of St. Micahel and St. George (1936). Hewas appointed Governor General of Canada (1940) during World War II.\n\nChildhood\n\nMary had a happy and industrious childhood. She was known in the family as May. As a young princess she was regarded as unimportant, in part because of her father's morganatic marriage. Her mother, often referred to as \"Fat Mary\", was the younger daughter of the Duke of Cambridge, an uncle of Queen Victoria. Because of her mother's extravagance and her father's vagueness about financial matters, the family gradually got into debt and had to retire to a villa in Florence for a couple of years to try to recoup their fortunes. When they returned to England they lived at White Lodge in Richmond Park.\n\nGoverness\n\nThe rather intelectual lady Mademoiselle Bricka was engaged as Mary's governess and reportedly had a great influence on here during her adolescene. Mary was apparently both clever and a hard working student. Mademoiselle Bricka was later hired to teach French to Mary's own children, but with less success\n\nQueen Mary (1867-1953) Part 2\n\nDespite their more limited financial resources, the Tecks socialized with the Prince and Princess of Wales, in part because of their family ties. Mary's mother was friendly with Princess Alexandra. The two hoped that their children would also become friendly. While the children were still in the nursery, Princess May would be invited to Prince George's birthday parties. (I'm not sure why she was not invited to Prince Eddy's birthday parties. Probably because before it was known how backward Prince Eddy was, Princess Mary was not considered a suitable potential bride.) She was invited to Marborough House to play whle the Wales were in London. Princess May and Prince George , however, apparently did not get on. The other children also did not become close. The Wales were also invited to the Tecks. Apparently the Tecks on such occasions would put the best toys in nursery away as the Prince of Wales' children were less disciplined and often broke toys when playing with them. Queen Victotria also complaimed about how rowdy her grand children were. as older boys Prince Eddy and George had little in common with the more sophisticated Teck boys. Princess May who became a rather serious, clever little girl found the three Wales princesses boring.\n\nDescription\n\nQueen Mary was tall with a long slender neck, golden brown hair, blue eyes. She had a regal and upright carriage, looking every inch a queen, to the point of being imperious. She was studious, sensible, and serious-minded. She was devoted to the monarchy and a traditionlist. Queen Mary shared her artistic interests with her son, the Duke of Kent (future George VI), the only one of her sons who had inherited her love for art and history. She also appeared stiff and unsmiling, but people weren't aware of how shy she was in public and a very different person at home.\n\nMarriage\n\nMary was bethrothed to Prince Albert, the Duke of Clarence who died shortly before their upcoming wedding. Prince George was now in line to inherit the crown, his marriage plans now assumed considerable importance. Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales had personally selected Princess Mary of Teck for Albert Victor to marry. The Princess and Princess of Wales at first hesitated over the chioce of Princess Mary for Prince George which they at first saw as an affront to the memory of their beloved Prince Eddy. After condsiderable thought and impecable behavior on the part of the Princess, they finally decided that Mary would marry the younger brother instead. Prince George apparently had little say in the matter. While this was going on, he was at Heildelburg attempting to learn German, or as hios mother put it, \"that old sauerkraut the German language\". [Battiscombe, pp. 194-195.] Eventually the two had a chance to get to know each other. Prince George liked her well enough. Certainly the Princess, a bright girl, must have seen that Prince George was a far more suitable partner than Prince Victor Albert ever would have been. The Prince proposed to her in the same place (the estate of his aunt the Duchess of Fife) that Prince Eddy had proposed. Princess Marry accepted. [Battiscombe, p. 195-196.] Prince George dutifully married Princess Mary of Teck in 1893. It was no love match, but the two grew to care for each other deeply. The future Queen Mary lived until 1953, outliving her husband by nearly 3 decades and some of her sons as well.\n\nPrince Albert Victor\n\nIt was because of this tact and ability to handle difficult people that she was chosen as bride for the heir-apparent. Prince \"Eddy\", Duke of Clarence and Avondale, was the eldest son of the Prince of Wales (King Edward VII) and therefor in line to inherit the throne. Like his mother he was congenitally deaf, a condition caused by otosclerosis, the effects of which were aggravated by his poor education. Many regarded him as backward, and only his mother, Alexandra, showed some understanding by recognising his artistic rather than academic bent. It was hoped a marriage to Princess Mary of Teck might steer him in the right direction. He officially died of typhoid shortly after their engagement but even his death is now questioned.\n\nPrince George\n\nWhile the two did not get on as children, after the death of Prince Eddy it was decided that Princess mary and Prince George should marry. It was not a love match although the two were on friendly terms. Mary, never regarded a beauty but with a regal bearing and dignity, made a much more suitable marriage when she married Eddy's younger brother, the future King George V. Over the years the two were to become devoted to each other.\n\nYoung Couple\n\nThe new Duchess was unsure of herself. The Teck family was a lesser European nobel family. Many of the Windsor's, especially her sister-in-law, considered the Tecks vastly inferior to their family. Had her family been on a par with the Imperial Windsors, the Duchess might of questioned her husband.
