He married Princess Mary of Teck in the Chapel Royal, St James’s Palace, on 6 July 1893. There were 10 bridesmaids – granddaughters and a great granddaughter of the Queen. The Duchess of Teck, sitting at the front of the painting to the right of the centre, wrote that she liked the picture, and that she herself was quite recognisable, although not flattered. Signed and dated: L Tuxen 1894.",
