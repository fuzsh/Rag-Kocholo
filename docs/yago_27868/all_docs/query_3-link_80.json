        "text": "For centuries, the British monarchy has captivated minds, hearts and countless newspaper headlines around the world.\n\nLiving life in the spotlight and under scrutiny, the British royal family continues to feed the global public's fascination with coronations, royal weddings, birth announcements -- and a few scandals.\n\nMost recently, the royal family has faced the death of Queen Elizabeth II, Britain's longest-reigning monarch, and the upheaval of Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, departing their senior royal roles.\n\nHere's a guide to the most well-known living members of the House of Windsor.\n\nMORE: How to watch the coronation of King Charles III live on Saturday\n\nKing Charles III\n\nKing Charles III is the current monarch of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms. Born in London in 1948, he was the first child of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nIn 1952, Elizabeth became queen at the age of 25 after her father, King George VI, fell ill and died. Charles was 4 years old at his mother's coronation in London's Westminster Abbey on June 2, 1953.\n\nThe queen made Charles the Prince of Wales in 1969, among other royal titles, after he had spent a term at the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth, where he learned to speak Welsh.\n\nIn 1981, Charles married Lady Diana Spencer, who became the Princess of Wales. The couple had two sons, William and Harry, before their marriage was dissolved in 1996. Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris a year later.\n\nIn 2005, Charles married Camilla Parker Bowles, who then became known as the Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nA 1992 biography on the late princess of Wales, \"Diana: Her True Story,\" in which she collaborated with the author, Andrew Morton, revealed further details on her troubled marriage to Charles, including her suspicion and jealousy over his clandestine romance with Camilla, and how she came to consider Camilla as the \"third person\" in their relationship.\n\nA 1994 biography authorized by Charles -- \"Prince of Wales,\" by Jonathan Dimbleby -- revealed that he felt pressured by his father to marry Diana and that he wasn't ever in love with her. According to the book, Charles began having an affair with Camilla in 1986. The two had met at a polo match several years prior.\n\nCharles became king after his mother, the longest-reigning monarch in British history, died at the age of 96 at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, on Sept. 8, 2022. Elizabeth's death came just over a year after her husband died at the age of 99 at Windsor Castle in the English county of Berkshire on April 9, 2021.\n\nCharles and Camilla will be coronated side-by-side at Westminster Abbey in London on May 2, per his mother's request that Camilla become queen consort -- the title given to the wife of a reigning king.\n\nCamilla, Queen Consort\n\nCamilla, the Queen Consort, is the wife of King Charles III.\n\nBorn Camilla Rosemary Shand in London in 1947, she grew up at her family's residences in East Sussex and South Kensington.\n\nIn 1973, Camilla married British Army officer Andrew Parker Bowles. The couple had two children -- a son and a daughter -- before divorcing in 1995.\n\nCamilla became a member of the British royal family and was made a duchess upon her marriage to Charles, then-Prince of Wales, in 2005. The couple were reportedly close friends for years before becoming involved romantically.\n\nWhen Charles succeeded his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in 2022, Camilla became queen consort -- the title given to the wife of a reigning king -- per Elizabeth's request. Charles and Camilla will be officially crowned on May 2.\n\nAnne, Princess Royal\n\nAnne, Princess Royal, is the second child and only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. She is currently 16th in line to the throne.\n\nBorn in London in 1950, Anne is known for her love of horses. She competed in the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games as a member of the British equestrian team.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II gave her daughter the title of Princess Royal in 1987.\n\nAnne married Capt. Mark Phillips in 1992. The couple had two children, Peter and Zara, before their marriage was dissolved in 1992.\n\nThe princess went on to marry Adm. Timothy Laurence in 1992.\n\nPrince Andrew, Duke of York\n\nPrince Andrew, Duke of York, was born in London in 1960, becoming the third child and second son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He is currently eighth in line to the throne.\n\nAndrew was made the Duke of York by the queen after his marriage to Sarah Ferguson in 1986. The couple had two daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, before divorcing in 1996.\n\nThe duke joined the Royal Navy in 1979 and departed from active service 22 years later.\n\nPrince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh\n\nPrince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, was born in London in 1964, as the youngest child of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He is currently 13th in line to the throne.\n\nEdward was made the Earl of Wessex by the queen after he wed Sophie Rhys-Jones in 1999. The couple have two children, Louise and James, who are currently 15th and 14th in line to the throne, respectively.\n\nAfter the death of their parents and Charles' ascension to the throne, Edward was named the new Duke of Edinburgh on his 59th birthday in 2023. His former title, Earl of Wessex, went to his son, James.\n\nThe duke lives with his family in Bagshot Park in Berkshire.\n\nWilliam, Prince of Wales\n\nPrince William is the heir apparent to the British throne. Born in London in 1982, he is the eldest son of King Charles III, the former Prince of Wales, and Diana, the late Princess of Wales.\n\nWilliam was 15 when his mother died.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, the prince went on to complete nearly eight years of full-time military service in the British Armed Forces. William then retrained to become an air ambulance pilot and worked for East Anglian Air Ambulance from 2015 to 2017.\n\nIn 2011, William married Catherine Middleton, whom he met at university. They were then bestowed the titles Duke and Duchess of Cambridge by William's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. After the queen's death in 2022, Charles took the throne while William and Catherine became known as the Prince and Princess of Wales.\n\nThe couple have three children: George, Charlotte and Louis. The family lives at Adelaide Cottage, a four-bedroom cottage on the grounds of Windsor Castle. They were previously living at Kensington Palace in London.\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, is currently fifth in line to the throne. Born in London in 1984, he is the younger son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, the late Princess of Wales.\n\nHarry was 12 when his mother died.\n\nThe prince served in the British Armed Forces for 10 years, during which he was deployed to Afghanistan twice. He left operational service in 2015.\n\nHarry was given the title Duke of Sussex after he wed American actress Meghan Markle in 2018. The couple have a son, Archie, and a daughter, Lilibet.\n\nHarry and Meghan officially stepped down as senior working members of the British royal family on March 31, 2021. They moved their family to Canada temporarily before settling in California. They were previously living at Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate in Berkshire.\n\nCatherine, Princess of Wales\n\nBorn into an upper middle class family in Reading in 1982, Catherine \"Kate\" Middleton became a member of the British royal family and was made a duchess upon her marriage to Prince William in 2011.\n\nThe couple, who are now known as the Prince and Princess of Wales, first met while studying at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. They have three children: George, Charlotte and Louis.\n\nThe family lives at Adelaide Cottage on the grounds of Windsor Castle.\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, California, in 1981, Meghan Markle became a member of the British royal family and was made a duchess upon her marriage to Prince Harry in 2018.\n\nPrior to becoming a royal, the future duchess graduated from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and pursued a career in acting. She was most known for her role in the American legal drama series \"Suits.\" She also ran a successful lifestyle blog called \"The Tig.\"\n\nMeghan retired from her acting career, shuttered her blog and deleted all her social media accounts following the announcement of her engagement to Prince Harry, whom she first met on a blind date. The couple, who are now known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have a son, Archie, and a daughter, Lilibet.\n\nMeghan was previously married to actor and producer Trevor Engelson. They divorced in 2013 after less than two years of marriage.\n\nHarry and Meghan officially stepped down as senior working members of the British royal family on March 31, 2021. They moved their family to Canada temporarily before settling in California. They were previously living at Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate in Berkshire.\n\nIn a bombshell interview with American television host Oprah Winfrey that aired on CBS on March 12, 2021, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex alleged that Meghan was the victim of racism and callous treatment during her time as a working member of the British royal family. Buckingham Palace later said in a statement that the allegations were \"concerning\" and would be \"taken very seriously.\"\n\nPrincess Beatrice of York\n\nBorn in London in 1988, Princess Beatrice is the elder daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York. She is currently ninth in line to the throne.\n\nBeatrice became the first member of the British royal family to complete the London Marathon in 2010.\n\nShe graduated from Goldsmiths, University of London in 2011 and currently has a full-time career in business.\n\nIn 2020, Beatrice wed British property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.

Mark Phillips. He is currently 17th in line to the throne.\n\nBorn in London in 1977, Peter is the eldest grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He did not inherit an official royal title at birth nor was he given a courtesy title. Hereditary titles are traditionally passed down through male heirs, and Peter's father does not possess one. The princess and her husband at the time were said to have declined an offer from the queen to give both her children courtesy titles.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Exeter in 2000, Peter pursued a career in sports sponsorship and management.\n\nPeter wed Canadian management consultant Autumn Kelly in 2008. The couple has two daughters, Savannah and Isla, who are currently 18th and 19th in line to the throne, respectively.\n\nZara Tindall\n\nZara Tindall is the daughter of Anne, Princess Royal, and her first husband, Capt.

Anne, Princess Royal, and her then-husband were said to have declined an offer from the queen to give both her children courtesy titles.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Exeter, Zara went on to have a successful equestrian career, sharing her mother's love of horses. She competed for the British equestrian team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Hong Kong and the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London, winning a silver medal at the latter.\n\nIn 2011, Zara married English rugby union player Mike Tindall, with whom she has three children, Mia, Lena and Lucas, who are currently 21st, 22nd and 23rd in line to the throne, respectively.\n\nPrince George of Wales\n\nBorn in London in 2013, Prince George of Wales is the first child of William, Prince of Wales, and his wife, Catherine, Princess of Wales.

He is currently sixth in line to the throne.\n\nArchie lives with his parents in California.\n\nArchie's surname of Mountbatten-Windsor is a combination of Queen Elizabeth II's surname of Windsor and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh's adopted surname of Mountbatten. Archie inherited that surname as a descendant of the queen without the title of prince or the style of His Royal Highness. After his birth and name were announced, Buckingham Palace confirmed in a statement that Archie will not carry a courtesy title \"at this time.\"\n\nUpon the accession of Charles III, Archie became entitled to use the title and style as the grandchild of the sovereign, pursuant to the royal rules set in 1917 by then-King George V, Elizabeth's grandfather.\n\nPrincess Lilibet of Sussex\n\nBorn in Santa Barbara, California, in 2021, Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor is the second child of Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. She is currently seventh in line to the throne.\n\nLilibet, nicknamed \"Lili,\" lives with her parents in California. While she was not the first royal baby to be born in the United States, Lili was the first of Queen Elizabeth II's great-grandchildren to be born on American soil.\n\nLili is named after her great-grandmother, whose family nickname was Lilibet. Lili's middle name was chosen to honor her late grandmother, Diana, Princess of Wales, according to a statement from the press secretary for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nUpon the accession of Charles III, Lili became entitled to use the title of princess and the style of Her Royal Highness as the grandchild of the sovereign."
