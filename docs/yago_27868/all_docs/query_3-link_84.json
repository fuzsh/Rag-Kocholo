        "text": "When Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born, she was not a direct heir to the throne since her father was the second son of King George V. But after her grandfather died and her uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated -- both within the same year -- Elizabethâs father became King George VI. The move made the young princess, who was just 10 years old, the next in line.\n\nFrom this moment on, her life changed as she began training to be the next monarch.\n\nElizabeth married Prince Philip a couple of years after World War II ended and he had returned from serving overseas in the navy in 1947. Soon after, they had their first two children, Charles and Anne.\n\nOn February 6, 1952, at age 25, Elizabeth acceded to the throne. After eight years as queen, she had her third child, Andrew, and in 1964 her last son, Edward.\n\nFrom an early age, Elizabeth understood the power of media and harnessed it to great effect throughout her reign. At her coronation in 1953, she requested cameras be allowed into Westminster Abbey to televise the event for the first time. She would go on to permit cameras at her daily engagements, allow unprecedented access to her private life in the 1969 BBC documentary âRoyal Family,â and even dipped her toe into social media when she joined Twitter in 2014.\n\nAs queen, she was served by 15 UK prime ministers, met 12 serving US presidents ,countless heads of state and visited over 120 countries.\n\nIn 2022, she celebrated her platinum jubilee â which marked an incredible 70 years on the throne â and three months later she died of old age in Balmoral, Scotland, at age 96. She was laid to rest alongside her husband of 73 years at Windsor Castle.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II is the King's\n\nmother\n\nconnection\n\nRecent news\n\nPrince Philip of Greece and Denmark was born in Corfu, Greece, as the youngest of five children. His father was Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and his mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, was Queen Victoriaâs great-granddaughter. This connection made Philip and Queen Elizabeth II third cousins.\n\nPhilip first met Elizabeth when she was a princess; they married a little over four years before she became monarch, in 1947. He renounced his former royal title and in 1957 became His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nPhilip had joined the Royal Navy at 18 and continued in active duty throughout World War II, only stepping down in 1951 as his wife became busier with royal duties. The duke took an active, public-facing role, accompanying the queen on royal tours and even presenting television programs.\n\nA keen environmentalist, Philip wrote a number of books on the environment and other subjects and was president of the World Wildlife Fund for decades. As a sportsman, he had a successful polo career spanning 20 years. He was also skilled in the sport of horse carriage driving and learned to fly aircraft, racking up almost 6,000 hours in the air.\n\nThe queen and Philipâs marriage lasted for 73 years until his death at age 99, making him the longest-serving royal consort in British history.\n\nPrince Philip is the King's\n\nfather\n\nconnection\n\nRecent news\n\nCharles Philip Arthur George Windsor acceded to the throne as King Charles III on the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on September 8, 2022. He was officially crowned in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey on May 6, 2023. As the Prince of Wales, he was heir apparent since the age of 3, making him the longest serving British monarch-in-waiting.\n\nCharles attended Cambridge University and studied archaeology and anthropology in his first year, then history. He has bachelorâs and masterâs degrees.\n\nAs his father did before him, Charles embarked on a naval career from 1971 to 1976, where he qualified as a helicopter pilot.\n\nHe married Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, with whom he had two children, William and Harry. Charles and Diana divorced 15 years later. Toward the end of their marriage, he admitted to an affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. Camilla and Charles have been married since 2005.\n\nAs prince, Charles established over 20 charities and was president or patron of hundreds more involving issues as diverse as helping disadvantaged young people to supporting Britainâs rural farming communities.\n\nA longstanding advocate for the environment, Charles first spoke publicly about the impact of pollution and plastic in 1970 and more than five decades later he has continued speaking at such events as the 2021 COP26 global climate conference. Charles has written several books on the subject of the environment for children as well as adults and has taken novel personal actions like converting his Aston Martin car to run on biofuel and installing solar panels on his official London residence.\n\nRecent news\n\nCamilla Rosemary Shand met then-Prince Charles at a polo match when she was in her early 20s, before her first marriage to Andrew Parker Bowles in 1973. The couple had two children, Thomas Henry and Laura Rose.\n\nAfter Charles married Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, Camilla was widely seen as âthe other womanâ and the reason for the breakdown of the royal marriage. Camilla and Charles divorced their spouses in 1995 and 1996, respectively.\n\nAfter a short hiatus out of the public eye, Camilla was photographed with Charles in 1999 and shortly afterward, she moved into royal residence Clarence House to be with Charles, and her name started appearing on official paperwork. Charles and Camilla married in a civil ceremony in 2005.\n\nâItâs always nice to have somebody on your side,â Charles told CNN in 2015. âSheâs an enormous support. The great thing is we laugh a lot because she sees the funny side of life, thank God. If you imagine, that adds an enormous amount to the whole thing.â\n\nCamilla is a working royal, supporting her husband in royal duties. She is also patron or president to about 100 charities involving such issues as violence against women and literacy.\n\nTraditionally the wife of a male sovereign is crowned in a simpler ceremony after her husband. Camilla became the 29th queen consort crowned at Westminster Abbey on May 6, 2023. She is titled as Queen Camilla, which Buckingham Palace has said is in keeping with former queens consort.\n\nQueen Camilla is the King's\n\nspouse\n\nconnection\n\nRecent news\n\nLady Diana Frances Spencer married Prince Charles in 1981 and became Princess of Wales.\n\nDiana was a member of the aristocracy; her father was an Earl and had been an equerry to King George VI from 1950 to 1952, and Queen Elizabeth II between 1952 and 1954, while her grandmother was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.\n\nAfter 11 years of marriage, Diana and Charles formally separated, with the divorce finalized in 1996.\n\nWhile being pursued by paparazzi in Paris the following year, Diana was killed in a car crash, along with her boyfriend and a chauffeur who was legally drunk at the time. Her death sparked widespread public mourning; an estimated 2.5 billion people around the world watched the funeral services.\n\nDianaâs legacy includes her commitment to charitable work. In particular, she helped break down stigma for people with HIV/AIDS and was an active campaigner against the use of land mines, bringing the issue to public attention.\n\nLady Diana Spencer is the King's\n\nex-wife\n\nconnection\n\nRecent news\n\nWilliam Arthur Philip Louis and his brother, Prince Harry, are the only two children of King Charles III and the late Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nPrince William holds a masterâs degree in geography. After university, he served in the military, where he participated in more than 150 helicopter search and rescue operations.\n\nIn 2011, William married Kate Middleton, whom he met at university a decade before. They have three children together.\n\nWilliam has been a vocal advocate of ending the stigma around mental health care. He is also committed to environmental causes and in recent years launched the Earthshot Prize, a 10-year initiative that aims to tackle some of the planetâs most pressing climate challenges.\n\nIn King Charlesâ first public address as monarch in 2022, he announced that William and his wife had become the new Prince and Princess of Wales. William had previously been using the Duke of Cambridge title, which was bestowed on him on his wedding day.\n\nPrince William is the King's\n\nson\n\nconnection\n\nRecent news\n\nCatherine Elizabeth Middleton married Prince William in 2011 and became the Duchess of Cambridge. Now the Princess of Wales, she and William have three children together.\n\nKnown casually as âKate,â the future member of the royal family grew up in a small village in England with her younger sister and brother. Her mother is a former flight attendant and her father worked as a pilot before they set up their own mail-order business.\n\nKate has a masterâs degree in art history from the University of St. Andrews â where she met her husband-to-be.
