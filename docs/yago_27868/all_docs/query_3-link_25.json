        "text": "Full Name: George Frederick Ernest Albert\n\nProfession: King of the United Kingdom\n\nBiography: George V was King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Emperor of India, from May 6, 1910, until his death in 1936. Born as the second son of Edward VII and Alexandra of Denmark, George was not initially expected to become king. His elder brother, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence, died in 1892, however, placing him directly in line for the throne.\n\nBefore becoming king, George served in the Royal Navy, but his naval career ended with the death of his brother. He married Princess Mary of Teck in 1893, forming a strong partnership that would last throughout his life. They had six children, including Edward VIII and George VI.\n\nGeorge V's reign was marked by a series of significant events, including World War I, a period that saw a profound change in the social, political, and economic fabric of Britain and its empire. During the war, George made over 450 visits to troops and over 300 visits to hospitals visiting wounded military personnel, boosting morale and showing solidarity with his subjects.\n\nIn response to anti-German sentiment in the UK during World War I, George famously changed the royal family's name from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the House of Windsor, thereby anglicizing the family name and distancing the monarchy from its German roots.\n\nGeorge V was also known for his role in establishing the modern image of the British monarchy. He was the first monarch to make a Christmas Day broadcast, a tradition that continues to this day. His silver jubilee in 1935 was celebrated with widespread enthusiasm, reflecting the respect and affection in which he was held by the public.\n\nHis reign also witnessed the rise of socialism, Irish republicanism, and the Indian independence movement, all of which signaled the eventual dissolution of the British Empire and the reformation of the British Commonwealth. George was king during the establishment of the first Labour government and the first steps towards the modern Commonwealth with the Statute of Westminster 1931.\n\nGeorge V's health declined in his later years, and he died on January 20, 1936, at Sandringham House. His eldest son succeeded him as Edward VIII, though he abdicated later that year, and his second son became King George VI.\n\nBorn: June 3, 1865\n\nBirthplace: London, England, United Kingdom\n\nStar Sign: Gemini\n\nDied: January 20, 1936 (aged 70)\n\nCause of Death: Suffering from chronic bronchitis and close to death following a cold, his doctor Bertrand Dawson euthanized the King via two consecutive lethal injections, ​3⁄4 g of morphine followed by 1g of cocaine shortly afterwards.\n\nArticles and Photos\n\nNine Kings in One Room\n\nNine sovereigns of Europe meet at the funeral of Edward VII\n\nStormy Birth for the House of Windsor\n\nBritain’s King with his German connections faced resentment when World War 1 bombs fell on London. It led, on this day, to a change of name for the monarchy.\n\nKing Abdicates for Love of Wallis Simpson\n\nOn this day King Edward VIII gave up his throne so that he could marry the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson. It was the first time a British king had abdicated.\n\nHistorical Events\n\nGeorge V becomes King of the United Kingdom upon the death of his father, Edward VII\n\nKing George V crowned King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and all his realms and territories beyond the sea\n\nEnglish suffragette Emily Davison is trampled and mortally wounded by a racechorse called Anmer, ridden by Herbert Jones and owned by King George V, during running of the Derby at Epsom Downs in Surrey; Jones thrown from horse, horse finishes the race jockey-less, Davison dies from her injuries 4 days later.\n\nKing George V grants Royal Letters Patent to New Zealand establishing office of Governor-General as Monarch's representative in the country\n\nMost Excellent Order of British Empire inaugurated by King George V to recognise the efforts of his people in WWI\n\nRoyal Proclamation by King George V changes name of British Royal family from German Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor\n\nSouthwark Bridge in London is opened to traffic by King George V and Queen Mary.\n\nJohn Masefield is appointed British Poet Laureate by King George V\n\nDuring King George V's Christmas dinner speech his chair collapses\n\nBritish King George V & Queen Mary celebrate silver jubilee\n\nPersonal Life\n\nBritish Prince George Duke of York (later George V) marries Princess Victoria of Teck (Queen Mary) at St James's Palace\n\nReferences\n\nGeorge V - Westminster Abbey\n\nGeorge V (r. 1910-1936) - The Royal Family\n\nTruth behind the death of suffragette Emily Davison is finally revealed - The Guardian\n\nFamous Kings"
