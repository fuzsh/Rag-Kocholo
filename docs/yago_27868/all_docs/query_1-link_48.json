        "text": "Location\n\nCountry: Turkey\n\nCity: Ankara\n\nPlace: British Embassy\n\nMary, Princess of Teck is depicted in her coronation robes of gold brocade, with an ermine cloak and a sumptuous selection of jewels. She was particularly noted for wearing splendid jewels for all formal events.\n\nMary of Teck was the daughter of Francis, Duke of Teck and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge. Through her mother she was great-granddaughter of George III and a second cousin to Queen Victoria. She was born at Kensington Palace in the month of May and was nicknamed May by her family.\n\nIn 1891, Mary was betrothed to Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and grandson of the Queen. However, shortly after the engagement, in 1892, he died of pneumonia. The following year, with the support of Queen Victoria, she became betrothed to his brother George, Duke of York. The couple married on 6 July 1893 at the Chapel Royal, St James Palace.\n\nWhen Victoria died in 1901, her eldest son, Edward, became King Edward VII and his son, George, Duke of York was made Prince of Wales. On 6 May 1910, Edward VII died and the Prince of Wales ascended the throne as George V, with Mary as his Queen consort. As Queen, she was a model of regal formality. Her only public address was made as she launched her namesake, HMS Queen Mary, on 26 September 1934."
