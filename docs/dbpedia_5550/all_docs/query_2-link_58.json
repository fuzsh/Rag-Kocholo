        "text": "Fifty years ago, when June Millington and her sister Jean formed the all-female rock band Fanny, they felt like they were living a secret. “As a girl, you couldn’t tell anyone ‘I’m in a band,’” June Millington recalled. “You might as well say ‘I’m flying to the moon.’ It just wasn’t in the realm of experience. We had to create our own frame – and then step into it.”\n\nIn fact, they did so confidently enough to become the first all-female rock band ever to release an album on a major label, a crisp, self-titled work on Reprise Records in 1970. Still, it frustrates the lead guitarist that more female rockers who rose in Fanny’s wake haven’t acknowledged their pivotal role. “All these women carved out their careers and I never once heard them mention Fanny,” she said. “I looked. I waited. I read interviews. And I never saw it.”\n\nAt least now a few are trying to make up for it. A new album arriving this week, Fanny Walked The Earth – the first issued under the Fanny banner in 43 years – features a song that boasts guest appearances from members of the Bangles, the Runaways and the Go-Gos. Millington said that happened only because Fanny’s drummer from the 1960s, Brie Howard (who plays on the album), knew the women and brought them onboard. Otherwise, only the most ardent followers of 1970s rock and pop remember the highs and lows of this pioneering band. Their rare tale intersects with a striking line of stars, including David Bowie, Todd Rundgren, Barbra Streisand and even Tiny Tim. “There’s some incredible musical DNA in our story,” Millington said.\n\nThere’s also an unlikely cultural background. The Millington sisters spent their early years in Manila, reared by a Filipina mother and a white father who served as a lieutenant commander in the US navy. A family of means, they had servants at their beck and call. “I didn’t even know how to iron my shirt until I was a teenager,” said Millington.\n\nIn her teen years, her parents brought the family to the US. “My dad didn’t like the Filipino culture,” she said. “He used to say ’Filipinos are so duplicitous.’ Did I really need to hear that?”\n\nIt got worse when the biracial girls tried to fit in at school in Sacramento, California, in the early 60s. “The other kids had no idea about Manila,” she said. “They figured we were Mexicans. Which they thought was bad.”\n\nThe siblings found refuge in music, using the ukuleles they played from childhood to learn the pop hits of the Everly Brothers and Neil Sedaka. For years, they had no friends. Yet, once they began performing Beach Boys and Motown hits at junior high school talent shows “people stopped us in the hall. That was a watershed moment. We didn’t come to this music for ‘sex, drugs and rock ‘n roll.’ It was about making friends.”\n\nBonding on music and companionship, the sisters formed their first all-female band in the mid-60s named the Svelts. But the pressures on women of the day made it hard to keep them together. Drummer Howard left after she married a man who told her to quit the band. “Back in the day, labels would say ‘we don’t want to sign a band of women because one of them is going to marry, have a baby and quit,’” Millington said. “And that happened to us – twice!”\n\nIt was only the sisters’ determination that kept the Svelts going. “This band was bigger than relationships,” she said. “We were never going to quit.”\n\nEven the doubters didn’t faze them. “There would be snickering from some people,” said Millington. “They’d say ‘not bad – for a chick.’ But that didn’t last long. After six or seven minutes of watching us, they had to give it up.”\n\nIronically, the women wound up getting their Reprise contract, in part, due to their gender. “We were signed as a novelty,” Millington said. “Mo Ostin signed us sight unseen.”\n\nIn fact, their producer, Richard Perry, had just scored a novelty hit with Tiny Tim’s Tiptoe Through the Tulips. To polish them, Reprise gave the group rehearsal space on the backlot of Warner Bros film studios, next to one for Little Feat, who became close friends. After seeing what the group, now dubbed Fanny, could do in their rehearsal space, the label was “1,000% behind us”, said Millington.\n\nWhile some other all-female bands had already gotten signed, including Goldie and the Gingerbreads, the Pleasure Seekers and the Freudian Slips (which included sometime Fanny drummer Howard), Fanny’s self-titled, 1970 debut was the first such major label album to appear. Afterwards, the group toured with top rock bands, like the Kinks, Procol Harum and Humble Pie. “They were great to us,” the guitarist said. “They liked seeing a band of chicks who could play.”\n\nWhen Barbra Streisand wanted to get a rockier sound for her hit albums Stoney End and Barbra Joan Streisand, she approached Fanny. “We met at the Whiskey,” Millington recalled. “She didn’t put on any airs. When we played with her in the studio, she told us she was nervous because she’d never sung with a small band live before.”\n\nThen, in 1972, they got a fan letter from David Bowie, which Millington ignored. “I didn’t know who he was,” she said.\n\nUndaunted, Bowie later invited them to a party he gave after gigs they were each playing in Liverpool. “He turned out to be the perfect host,” the guitarist said. “He knew how to mingle and tell stories. He even did a mime demonstration for us.”\n\nJune’s sister Jean wound up having an affair with Bowie that lasted about a year. “They were really into each other,” Millington said. “But David was on a trajectory. He had a vision.”\n\nIn 1999, Bowie gave an interview to Rolling Stone in which he called Fanny “one of the finest rock bands of their time. They’re as important as anybody else who’s ever been.”\n\nBut June began to bristle against the label’s insistence that the band hew to hard rock cliches, the better to prove that “chicks could kick ass”, as she sarcastically describes. She also disliked the designer clothes the label wanted them to wear. After four albums with Fanny (including one that broke the Top 40 and another produced by Todd Rundgren), June split. “I felt too hemmed in,” she said. “Also, I was tired. I needed to figure out who I was. I ended up in Woodstock, studying Buddhism.”\n\nAt the same time, she insisted that Jean continue the band. Upon hiring guitarist Patti Quatro (sister of Suzi and a former member of the Pleasure Seekers), Fanny scored a Top 40 single with Butter Boy, which Jean wrote about Bowie. The band issued one more album before they fizzled by 1975. Over the years, the Millingtons played together periodically, under different group names. Later, Jean married Bowie guitarist Earl Slick, while, by the late 70s, June came out as a lesbian and became a key player in the women’s music movement.\n\nIn 1983, June established the Institute for Musical Arts, a non-profit that supports women in music. Five years ago, the sisters joined up with Jean’s son by Slick, Lee, for an album that fell right in the Fanny mold, Play Like a Girl. A reunion concert held last year by the sisters, along with Howard, sparked the Fanny Walked the Earth recording, which they cut at the studio of the Institute for Musical Arts. The new music features more lead guitar work from June than ever, while the lyrics stress the band’s legacy. “We wanted to sing about why it’s so important that Fanny walked the earth,” Millington said. “There’s an arc from what we did to what all the women in bands do now. The point was to see what we started continue.”"
