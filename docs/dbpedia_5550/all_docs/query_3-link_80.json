TuneCore and parent company, global digital music company Believe, have committed to the Keychange global gender pledge for parity.\n\nSaid Gleeson, “Keychange’s mission aligns with TuneCore and Believe’s fierce commitment to gender parity across our artist and employee communities. While the discrepancy that exists currently in the music industry has become more recognized, the challenges and barriers facing female creators are still there and remain poorly understood and unsolved. We all need to be aware and ask ourselves what we can do to move the needle. I’m looking forward to working alongside my fellow Keychange ambassadors to break down unnecessary barriers in the industry and incite real change.”\n\nEarlier this year, TuneCore, partnered with entertainment industry leader MIDiA Research to execute the study BE THE CHANGE: Women Making Music 2021, examining the reasons why females continue to be underrepresented in the music industry. The study gained major traction, spotlighting the challenges female creators face, and led TuneCore and Gleeson to Keychange.\n\nBE THE CHANGE… gathered responses from 401 women creators from around the world, 81% of which felt it was harder for female artists to get recognition than male artists. Taking steps to remedy this is an area of focus for Gleeson, as 34% asked for female-friendly resources and safe workspaces, while 35% of female creators want more change to come from learning and shared experiences, in the form of coaching and mentoring. Gleeson turned these requests into action items, resulting in her first activation on behalf of Keychange, the Gender Equality Hub, sponsored by TuneCore and Believe, at the 16th Annual Reeperbahn Festival taking place from 22-25 September in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nThe Gender Equality Hub, curated by Gleeson, will be located at the Hamburger Ding throughout the week and will host networking, mentoring sessions and workshops with organizations such as TikTok, Nuclear Blast, Groove Attack, Sentric Music, SongTrust, Native Instruments, Beatport, FL Studio, and Groover. Female and gender minority advocacy community shesaid.so will run the speed mentoring program. Today’s press release announcing the Gender Equality Hub can be found here.\n\nMark Mulligan, managing director at MIDiA Research added, “When Andreea and TuneCore came to MIDiA with the impetus that drove the BE THE CHANGE..study, we saw it as an opportunity to incite real change, but only if the conversation continues beyond the study, and only if we understand that the blockers to gender parity are not “women’s problems” to be solved just by women. Men, women and gender minorities must join together with all the music industry’s organisations and constituents to activate a sea change. Andreea’s work in creating the Gender Equality Hub and her appointment as Keychange Ambassador are important steps in furthering the mission on a worldwide scale.”\n\nThe program will pilot at Reeperbahn Festival with expansion to other conferences planned for next year. By bringing together experts and resources from across all areas of the music industry, the Gender Equity Hub aims to provide women and gender minorities access to the tools they need to grow their careers in order to increase their participation and representation in the music industry and ultimately achieve parity.\n\nAbout TuneCore\n\nTuneCore is the global platform for independent musicians to build audiences and careers – with technology and services across distribution, publishing administration and a range of promotional services.
