        "text": "The creative community joins this statement to take a stand against anti-LGBTQ legislation and to advocate for equality.\n\nMusic has long been used as a form of advocacy and self-expression, to inspire social change. From the Civil Rights Movement to present day, music has united and inspired people to take action.\n\nAs musicians and artists, we strongly believe that all people should be welcomed and celebrated as their true, authentic selves.\n\nNow more than ever it is vital to stand up for LGBTQ rights. Over 30 states across the country have introduced legislation targeting trans youth, and at least 5 states have signed the legislation into law, taking away access to gender-affirming healthcare and banning them from participating in sports. Transgender and non-conforming young people are already subjected to harassment and bullying, and experience higher rates of family rejection, homelessness and mental health challenges. These discriminatory laws and legislation send a message to trans youth telling them that they are not welcome in their own communities.\n\nTaking away basic human rights is inhumane - all youth, especially trans youth, should be protected and given opportunities to thrive.\n\nWe believe that the passage of the Equality Act is an essential part in protecting trans youth and all LGBTQ people by providing full protections to the most marginalized communities from discrimination. And we believe each of us needs to do our part to make it happen. So on June 24, weâ€™re kicking off the national Equality Act week of action with a livestream event open to all! Join us and our artists for an extraordinary night of action to support LGBTQ rights."
