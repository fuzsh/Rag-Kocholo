        "text": "by Ali Killian, edited by Erik van Rheenen\n\nAt age four, Joey Ovalle knew he was not really a female. Physically, yes, but his brain did not agree with his biology.\n\n“I was sitting in my room watching a commercial for the premiere of ‘Blues Clues,’” Ovalle said of the Nickelodeon children’s show. “I remember looking around my room and thinking, ‘All this stuff sucks. Look at all this pink crap and Barbies. I don’t want any of this stuff. I don’t want to play with it.’”\n\nEven as a toddler, the Miami, Fla., native had challenged the 1990s society-prescribed gender roles, especially the Halloween, Joey says, when his mom announced, “‘You’re going to be every Disney princess.’ And I was like ‘What the fuck?’ There are videos of me just crying, screeching because they were going to put me in a dress… I hated it. So I knew, but I didn’t have words for it.”\n\nBefore any of that, though, there was always Ovalle’s interest in music — crawling out of his crib in the middle of the night to bang on pots and pans with his older brother Ruben, for example. Years later, Joey would cling to music as a personal stabilizer and public soapbox.\n\nAs he grew, Ovalle’s gender identity and music intertwined. Eventually, he identified as a transgender man, and all of his high-school bandmates were lesbians who introduced him to queer musicians. Tegan and Sara, an openly lesbian duo of identical twins internationally known for their indie-rock, became a favorite.\n\n“I remember hearing about a neighboring high school that had two out transgender students,” Ovalle said. “And I was like, that’s really cool. That’s really brave.” But at the same time Joey remembers thinking how much he hated the situation, too: “It shouldn’t have to be that you’re brave. People just shouldn’t be shitty, period.”\n\nThe term ‘transgender’ “refers to those who do not identify or are uncomfortable with their assigned gender and gender roles,” according to the University of Texas Gender and Sexuality Center. The medical world would say Ovalle deals with “gender dysphoria,” or intense feelings of detachment from one’s birth sex.\n\nMusic helped Ovalle cope with the particular isolation and health risks those in the LGBTQ community endure.\n\nLow representation and visibility may partly explain why equality and acceptance, by both peers and family, are still withheld from the LGBTQ — lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer — community.\n\nA 2012 Gallup survey found that, on average, 3.5 percent of Americans identify as LGBT. The population percentages seem to vary by state depending on social and political climates.\n\n“States with high LGBT percentages tend to be more liberal and have more supportive LGBT legal climates, while those at the lower end of the LGBT spectrum are generally the most conservative,” the survey analysis said. In Texas, 3.3 percent of the population openly identifies as LGBT, just .2 percent below the national average."
