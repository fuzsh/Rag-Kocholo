After a series of hit songs, this girl group toured extensively to entertain allied military forces during World War II. The trio continued to be popular throughout the rest of the 1940s. In the 1950s, Patty decided to pursue a solo career, and the Andrews Sisters officially broke up in 1953.\n\nWatch \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\"\n\nKey Songs\n\n\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\"\n\n\"Bei Mir Bist Du Schon\"\n\n\"Rum and Coca Cola\"\n\n\"I Can Dream, Can't I?\"\n\n\"I Wanna Be Loved\"\n\n02\n\nof 20\n\n1957 - Martha and the Vandellas\n\nThe group that became Martha and the Vandellas was first formed in 1957 by a group of three friends. Martha Reeves joined later and became the lead vocalist for the girl group in 1962. After signing to Motown that same year, the group's career took off. Their second single, \"Heatwave,\" was a smash, climbing to No. 4 on the pop chart and topping the R&B chart. Martha and the Vandellas became one of Motown's most consistently successful vocal groups of the 1960s. Due to infighting and Motown's focus on other recording acts, the group's commercial success faded in the 1970s, and Reeves left the group in 1974. In 1995, Martha and the Vandellas were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nWatch \"Dancing In the Street\"\n\nKey Songs\n\n\"Dancing In the Street\"\n\n\"Heatwave\"\n\n\"Nowhere To Run\"\n\n\"Jimmy Mack\"\n\n\"Quicksand\"\n\n03\n\nof 20\n\n1957 - Shirelles\n\nThe Shirelles were founded as a vocal group for a talent show in 1957 under the name Poquellos. Rock-and-roll pioneer Florence Greenberg met with the group and signed them to her Tiara Records label. The Shirelles' \"I Met Him on a Sunday\" was the first record released on the fledgling label. When Greenberg sold the group's contract to Decca Records for $4,000, she formed her label Scepter. After two singles did poorly for Decca, they sold the contract back to Florence Greenberg, and the Shirelles became stars on the Scepter label. In 1961, \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\" became the first No. 1 pop hit single by an African-American girl group. It was also an early success for the songwriting team of Gerry Goffin and Carole King. The Shirelles were one of the top vocal groups of the early 1960s, but their popularity faded with the arrival of the British Invasion. In 1996, the Shirelles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nWatch \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\"\n\nKey Songs\n\n\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\"\n\n\"Soldier Boy\"\n\n\"Dedicated To the One I Love\"\n\n\"Mama Said\"\n\n\"Baby It's You\"\n\n04\n\nof 20\n\n1959 - Supremes\n\nThe Supremes, the most successful girl group of all time, formed in the Detroit housing projects in 1959 under the name the Primettes, a sister act to the male vocal group the Primes. Florence Ballard recruited her best friend Mary Wilson for the group, and Mary Wilson recruited Diana Ross. The Primettes failed to be signed after their first audition with Motown Records in 1960. Finally, after the group persisted, Motown head Berry Gordy offered them a contract in January 1961. He insisted they change their name, and the Supremes were born. For their first three years at Motown, the Supremes failed to chart any major hits. Finally, in December 1963, the girl group broke into the top 40, and in 1964 they released \"Where Did Our Love Go,\" which became their first No. 1 pop smash. By the time Diana Ross left the group at the end of the 1960s, the Supremes had a dozen No. 1 pop hits to their credit, more than any group except the Beatles. But without Diana Ross, the Supremes failed to gain significant commercial success in the 1970s. In 1988, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nWatch \"Stop In the Name Of Love\"\n\nKey Songs\n\n\"Stop In the Name of Love\"\n\n\"Where Did Our Love Go\"\n\n\"You Keep Me Hangin' On\"\n\n\"Someday We'll Be Together\"\n\n\"Baby Love\"\n\n05\n\nof 20\n\n1973 - Pointer Sisters\n\nThe Pointer Sisters, made up of real-life sisters, first came together in the early 1970s in Oakland, California. They originally recorded in a style that was a throwback to classic jazz, which earned them both critical and commercial acclaim. In 1977, June and Bonnie Pointer left the group, leaving Ruth and Anita as a duo. They signed with producer Richard Perry, June was persuaded to return to the group, and they released a cover of Bruce Springsteen's \"Fire,\" which became a smash hit in 1979. They continued to release a string of hits, including the No. 2 charting \"Slow Hand\" in 1981 and four consecutive top 10 hits in 1984. Commercial success faded later in the decade, but the Pointer Sisters continue to perform live.\n\nWatch \"Slow Hand\"\n\nKey Songs\n\n\"Slow Hand\"\n\n\"Fire\"\n\n\"Jump (For My Love)\"\n\n\"Automatic\"\n\n\"I'm So Excited\"\n\n06\n\nof 20\n\n1978 - The Go-Go's\n\nThe Go-Go's began playing as a punk band in Los Angeles in the late 1970s. Their debut single, \"We Got the Beat,\" drew attention in dance clubs and found success as an import in the U.K. With the release of their album \"Beauty and the Beat,\" the Go-Go's became the first all-female band to write their own songs and play their own instruments on a No. 1 charting album. The Go-Go's earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best New Artist and \"We Got the Beat\" became a top 10 smash hit. The group broke up in 1985, but they have reunited multiple times since. Lead singer Belinda Carlisle also went on to have a successful solo career.\n\nWatch \"We Got the Beat\"\n\nKey Songs\n\n\"We Got the Beat\"\n\n\"Vacation\"\n\n\"Head Over Heels\n\n\"Our Lips Are Sealed\"\n\n\"Turn To You\"\n\n07\n\nof 20\n\n1979 - Bananarama\n\nWhen childhood friends Sara Dallin and Keren Woodward met Siobhan Fahey while studying fashion journalism in London at the end of the 1970s, they formed a band and called it Bananarama. Devotees of the punk rock scene, the all-girl group recorded their first demo with the help of Sex Pistols members Steve Jones and Paul Cook. Bananarama scored in the U.K. with the 1982 top 5 smash \"Shy Boy\" and a hit cover of \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye.\" Then U.S. success finally came in 1984, when \"Cruel Summer\" was included in the soundtrack for \"The Karate Kid.\" Bananarama's biggest international success came in the mid-1980s when their 1986 cover of \"Venus\" became a No. 1 smash in the U.S., and the trio followed it with the top 5 hit \"I Heard a Rumour.\"\n\nWatch \"Venus\"\n\nKey Songs\n\n\"Venus\"\n\n\"I Heard a Rumour\"\n\n\"Cruel Summer\"\n\n\"Shy Boy\"\n\n\"Love In the First Degree\"\n\n08\n\nof 20\n\n1981 - The Bangles\n\nThe Bangles formed in 1981 in Los Angeles as part of the Paisley Underground scene of groups playing 1960s-influenced rock music. After a series of single releases and an EP with little commercial success, the Bangles were signed to major label Columbia Records. The single \"Going Down To Liverpool,\" with a music video featuring Leonard Nimoy, broke into the U.K. pop singles chart. It paved the way for the single \"Manic Monday,\" a song given to this girl group by Prince. It became their first top 10 smash. They followed it with the No. 1 hit \"Walk Like an Egyptian.\" By the late 1980s, artistic differences and interpersonal difficulties pulled the group apart. Later reunions resulted in two additional studio albums.\n\nWatch \"Walk Like an Egyptian\"\n\nKey Songs\n\n\"Walk Like an Egyptian\"\n\n\"Manic Monday\"\n\n\"Eternal Flame\"\n\n\"Hazy Shade of Winter\"\n\n\"In Your Room\"\n\n09\n\nof 20\n\n1984 - Expose\n\nWhen Miami DJ Lewis Martinee decided to put together a freestyle dance-music-based vocal group in 1984, Expose was born. Their first single, \"Point Of No Return,\" became a No. 1 dance hit. Expose then became the first group to score four top 10 hits from their debut album, capped by the No. 1 pop smash \"Seasons Change.\" Despite their phenomenal streak of seven consecutive top 10 hits, Expose was dropped from their recording contract in 1995. They came back together in 2010 to record new music.\n\nWatch \"Seasons Change\"\n\nKey Songs\n\n\"Seasons Change\"\n\n\"Come Go With Me\"\n\n\"Point Of No Return\"\n\n\"Let Me Be The One\"\n\n\"I'll Never Get Over You Getting Over Me\"\n\n10\n\nof 20\n\n1989 - En Vogue\n\nEn Vogue was formed when producers Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy decided to put together a contemporary R&B group inspired by the golden era of girl groups. They held auditions in 1988, named the group En Vogue, and recorded a debut album, \"Born To Sing,\" released in 1990. The first single, \"Hold On,\" became a No. 1 smash. By the end of the decade, En Vogue had received seven Grammy Award nominations and released six top 10 pop hit singles. The group's commercial success faded after the 1990s, but they continue to perform live and record new music.\n\nWatch \"My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It)\"\n\nKey Songs\n\n\"My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It)\"\n\n\"Hold On\"\n\n\"Free Your Mind\"\n\n\"Giving Him Something He Can Feel\"\n\n\"Don't Let Go (Love)\"\n\n11\n\nof 20\n\n1991 - TLC\n\nIn 1990, producer Ian Burke and one of his clients, Crystal Jones, came up with the idea to create an R&B girl group with the kind of hip-hop attitude that could serve as a counterpoint to the all-male trio Bell Biv Devoe. After several incarnations, in which Jones was eventually replaced, the final lineup for TLC was set, consisting of Lisa Lopes, Tionne Watkins, and Rozonda Thomas. The group's successful debut album included three top 10 pop hits. The follow-up, \"CrazySexyCool,\" was an even bigger smash, containing the No. 1 singles \"Creep\" and \"Waterfalls.\" Following the success of the third studio album, \"FanMail,\" the group took a break to pursue other projects. Tragically, Lopes died in a car accident in Honduras in April 2002. The remaining two members soldiered on with the 2002 album \"3D,\" however, subsequent efforts failed to meet with significant commercial success. All in all, TLC earned 17 Grammy Award nominations and won five.\n\nWatch \"Waterfalls\"\n\nKey Songs\n\n\"Waterfalls\"\n\n\"Creep\"\n\n\"No Scrubs\"\n\n\"Unpretty\"\n\n\"Red Light Special\"\n\n12\n\nof 20\n\n1996 - Spice Girls\n\nThe five-member girl group Spice Girls was put together in the mid-1990s as an answer to such successful boy bands as Take That. The band was initially named Touch, but after departing with their management over creative differences, they renamed themselves the Spice Girls. Their debut single in 1996, \"Wannabe,\" was the first in a string of six consecutive No. 1 pop hits in the U.K. \"Wannabe\" also reached No. 1 in the U.S., and the next two singles broke into the top five there. The Spice Girls were not only popular for their music but also for their fashion sense and \"girl power\" message. By the end of 2000, the Spice Girls went on hiatus, with all five members embarking on solo careers. The group reunited in 2007 for a successful year-long tour. Although each is still active in the entertainment business in some form or another, Posh Spice, i.e. Victoria Beckham, has attained the greatest level of success. Married to soccer superstar David Beckham, with whom she has four children, Victoria is also an acclaimed designer of high-end women's fashions.\n\nWatch \"Wannabe\"\n\nKey Songs\n\n\"Wannabe\"\n\n\"2 Become 1\"\n\n\"Say You'll Be There\"\n\n\"Too Much\"\n\n\"Stop\"\n\n13\n\nof 20\n\n1997 - Destiny's Child\n\nBeyonce Knowles and Kelly Rowland were first part of the girl group Girl's Tyme in the early 1990s. They made an appearance on the TV talent show \"Star Search\" but lost the competition. Taking over management of the group, Beyonce Knowles' father, Matthew, reduced it from six members to four, keeping original member LaTavia Roberson and adding LeToya Luckett. In 1996, the group changed its name to Destiny's Child and signed a recording contract with Columbia Records. The self-titled debut album included the No. 3 pop hit single \"No, No, No,\" featuring Wyclef Jean. The next album, \"The Writing's On the Wall,\" broke the group wide open with two No. 1 charting pop hits, including their signature song, \"Say My Name.\" In 1999, Luckett and Roberson were replaced by Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin. In 2000, Franklin left the group. In early 2006, amid the success of solo projects for Beyonce Knowles and Kelly Rowland, the group broke up. Today, Beyonce is one of world's biggest pop and R&B stars.\n\nWatch \"Say My Name\"\n\nKey Songs\n\n\"Say My Name\"\n\n\"Bills, Bills, Bills\"\n\n\"Bootylicious\"\n\n\"Independent Women, Part 1\"\n\n\"Survivor\"\n\n14\n\nof 20\n\n1998 - Sugababes\n\nSugababes were put together as a trio in 1998 by Ron Tom, the manager of the girl group All Saints. All three members were under the age of 15 when the girl group formed. Their debut single, \"Overload,\" peaked in the top 10 in the U.K. in 2000 and earned a Brit Award nomination for Best Single. After that initial success, Sugababes hit the top 10 sixteen more times over the next decade. While the group never achieved success in the U.S., they did become international pop stars. After major personnel changes at the end of the decade, fans were angry and commercial success suffered. The original three members later performed together under the name Mutya Keisha Siobhan, a combination of their first names.\n\nWatch \"Push the Button\"\n\nKey Songs\n\n\"Push the Button\"\n\n\"Freak Like Me\"\n\n\"Hole In the Head\"\n\n\"Round Round\"\n\nAbout You Now\"\n\n15\n\nof 20\n\n2002 - Girls Aloud\n\nEnglish-Irish girl group Girls Aloud first gained fame as winners of the TV talent show \"Popstars: The Rivals.\" Although they never achieved major international success, Girls Aloud released 20 consecutive top 10 pop hits in the U.K. They won the 2009 Brit Award for Best Single with \"The Promise.\" Group member Cheryl Cole had significant solo success outside of the group. She appeared as a judge on \"X Factor\" and had seven top 10 pop hit singles of her own, including five that went to No. 1. After a three-year hiatus, Girls Aloud regrouped in 2012 to release the No. 2 charting single \"Something New.\" Less than six months later they announced a permanent breakup.\n\nWatch \"Sound of the Underground\"\n\nKey Songs\n\n\"Sound of the Underground\"\n\n\"I'll Stand By You\"\n\n\"The Promise\"\n\n\"Love Machine\"\n\n\"No Good Advice\"\n\n16\n\nof 20\n\n2003 - Pussycat Dolls\n\nIn the 1990s, choreographer Robin Antin came up with the idea of creating a contemporary burlesque troupe. After the girl group built significant public acclaim, Interscope Records signed the Pussycat Dolls to a recording contract in 2003. With Nicole Scherzinger, former member of the girl group Eden's Crush, as lead vocalist, the Pussycat Dolls exploded onto the pop charts with their debut single \"Don't Cha.\" It became a No. 2 hit. The group released two top 5 charting albums and three more top 10 pop hit singles. However, by late 2010 the group was no more, although Nicole Scherzinger pursued a moderately successful solo career.\n\nWatch \"Don't Cha\"\n\nKey Songs\n\n\"Don't Cha\" featuring Busta Rhymes\n\n\"Buttons\" featuring Snoop Dogg\n\n\"Stickwitu\"\n\n\"When I Grow Up\"\n\n\"I Hate This Part\"\n\n17\n\nof 20\n\n2007 - Wonder Girls\n\nWonder Girls are one of the more successful of the K-pop bands, a South Korean girl group formed in 2007 by JYP Entertainment.

In the summer of 2012, their first original song, \"Wings,\" soared to the top spot as well. Little Mix have earned ten top 10 charting singles in the U.K. in just five years. Along with Girls Aloud, Sugababes, and Spice Girls, they are one of the most successful U.K. girl groups of all time.

When they failed to make it to the judges' houses stage, the judges put them together as a girl group. The group finished in third place on the show but soon became the most successful contestants from the show's short-lived run. Their first five singles each performed better than the last, culminating in the top five smash \"Work From Home.\" The group released two top-five-charting, gold-certified albums.
