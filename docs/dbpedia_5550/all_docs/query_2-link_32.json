        "text": "OHIO â A new band based out of Central Ohio is proving thereâs nothing quite like some Rock 'nâ Roll to turn a calm, casual day into a fun-filled dancing kind of night.\n\nThe entertainers are an all-female band thatâs nothing short of unique. All the ladies are lifelong musicians, many of them successful solo acts, but who came together during the pandemic to make the band âRoxy Janesâ and play some rock 'nâ roll.\n\nâI think there were people that as soon as we launch into like Immigrant Song, Led Zeppelin, they're just like, what whoa, what's this going on?â said Gayla Smith, a band member of Roxy Janes. âI think they're just surprised to hear us doing that material. But that's our favorite. We just love rockers, we really do.â\n\nThey started practicing together on Zoom, debuted with a porch concert at Buckeye Lake, and now play on the main stage at restaurants and bars all throughout central Ohio.\n\nâIt's been such a blessing,â Smith said. âIt has I know for all of us, we feel that way. But I think also the response to it has been amazing as well. It's not like we're really trying to make a statement. But we just happened to be five women who are veterans in this industry and got lucky enough that somebody had the idea to bring us together.â\n\nThe band is named after lead singer Kay Harrisâs great-grandma, who they discovered is also related to Gayla Smith, a singer and pianist for the band.\n\nâI was on 23andme and Gayla Smithâs name pops up as my second cousin, related through my great-grandmother,â Harris said. âSo we're like, oh, this is meant to be. And we're gonna call it Roxy Janes.â\n\nThe band plays all types of rock' nâ roll from Heart to Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Bonnie Raitt and Prince.\n\nâWe're playing music that we grew up with, and everything from then in between, and, just we're having a really good time doing it,â said Mary Hough, a guitarist for Roxy Janes.\n\nThis is only their second summer playing and theyâre already a fan favorite. The band said theyâve played more than 30 concerts so far.\n\nâWe love Roxy Janes,â said Debbie Popo, a resident of Millersport. âGayla Smith is a Millersport girl and we try to support her and all the rest of the girls. They're one of the best rock groups you'll ever find, especially being an all-girl band.â\n\nThe band aims to provide an unprecedented experience, bring people together, and help them leave their stress at the door.\n\nâMusic just brings everybody together. It doesn't matter how old you are,â said Molly Pauken, a bass player, guitarist and backup vocal singer for Roxy Janes. âYou could be five or you could be 95 and it's gonna bring everybody together. I think it's the one thing that unites probably the planet is music, somehow. So if we can be that part of bringing people together, we're all for it.â\n\nThese ladies say music keeps them young as most of them are in their 50s and 60s and they hope to inspire others to take risks.\n\nâThe more you take a leap when you're older, and you keep doing things like that, the younger you will stay. You have to you have to and I just think it's good for you not to accept, you know, the norm,â Smith said. âI would hope when they watch us doing that, that's what they think, you know, like maybe something they're hesitant about getting into. They might think twice because we're crazy enough to do it.â\n\nThe band is proving to the world that life is short, but that itâs never too late to do what you want, when you want, especially if itâs something you love.\n\nâAnd I would highly recommend that nobody ever quit until you quit living,â said Linda Dachtyl, the drummer for Roxy Janes.\n\nHereâs Roxy Janesâ schedule for the rest of the season:\n\nSept. 5, Pappy D's Island House at 6:30 p.m.\n\nSept. 12, Pappy D's Island House at 6:30 p.m.\n\nSept. 24 Roxy Janes Trio, BLYC at 4:30 p.m.\n\nOct. 6, Italian Fest at 8:30 p.m.\n\nOct. 26, Monster Mash, time not set yet"
