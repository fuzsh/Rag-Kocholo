These attacks are harmful because they are directed at kids who need our support the most.”\n\nEarlier this year, the Alberta government said it would implement new policies regarding children and LGBTQ+ rights. These include bans on gender reassignment surgery for those aged under 17 and on hormone therapy for children aged 15 and under, as well as limits on sports participation for transgender athletes.\n\n“The government is introducing these policies across several ministries to preserve the choices children and youth have before potentially making life-altering and often irreversible adult decisions,” Sam Blackett, press secretary for Premier Danielle Smith, said in a written statement issued to Postmedia.\n\nBlackett also said the province was reaffirming its support for the LGBTQ+ community by providing health-care access and supports for transgender adults.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Additionally, we’re developing a counselling pilot project to help youth identifying as transgender and their families work through often difficult and complex issues and discussions,” he said.\n\nThe concerns echo Smith’s own statement in a video posted to social media on Jan. 31, ahead of the official announcement.\n\n“Prematurely encouraging or enabling children to alter their very biology or natural growth, no matter how well intentioned and sincere, poses a risk to that child’s future that I as premier am not comfortable with permitting in our province,” she said at the time.\n\nLegal experts have said the new rules could run afoul of the Canadian Charter of Right and Freedoms, as a court had already ruled against similar legislation put in place by Saskatchewan.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
