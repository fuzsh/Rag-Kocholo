        "text": "This is the first year that Canada is an official country partner in the Keychange movement for gender equality. This week, Canadian funders FACTOR and SOCAN Foundation, alongside lead festival partners Breakout West and MUTEK Montreal collaborate on a focus week to explore the barriers for women and gender minorities in Canada.\n\nKeychange along with Canadian partners are proud to announce the appointment of the next Canadian Ambassadors to further the movement for gender diversity: Tegan and Sara. Tegan and Sara have released 9 studio albums, slowly crafting a sound both unique and influential. Selling over a million albums before streaming came along, Tegan and Sara became indie darlings in the early aughts, playing every bar, club, theater, arena and festival stage along the way. They will be taking part in a private In Conversation session for Keychange participants, hosted by Canadian Keychange participant Mar Sellars on Thursday 12th November.\n\nTegan and Sara said: “We encourage members of our industry who have tremendous power to sign, fund, promote, nominate, support, acknowledge, and celebrate the diverse population working in the arts today. The demographic breakdown of awards nominations and festival lineups reflects the structural confines of our society and industry. We must do better as it sends an outdated message to the next generation about whose art and voice and message is valuable.”\n\nMeg Symsyk, FACTOR President and CEO Elect said: “As a national funding organization in Canada, we are proud to lead and join our partners on this global initiative. FACTOR is committed to ensuring that our programs raise the bar, with these objectives of creating a more equitable future for underrepresented genders in the music industry. We look forward to working with our colleagues in our collective industry to strive to meet the new industry standards for which we all wish to participate and thrive in.”\n\n“The Keychange initiative is paving the way forward to ensure greater diversity, inclusion, and equity in the music industry globally.” Said Charlie Wall-Andrews, Executive Director of SOCAN Foundation and Vice-Chair of Music Canada’s Advisory Council. “it’s important for our industry to collaborate collectively to challenge the status quo, and the Canadian partners and festivals are committed to ensuring the success of Keychange in Canada.”\n\nRobyn Stewart, Breakout West said: “BreakOut West is committed to highlighting the diverse voices or our artists and industry. Our commitment as Keychange partners is one part of this as we strive to support female and non-binary leaders and the incredible mix of talent in Western Canada.”\n\nMarie-Laure Saidani, MUTEK Montreal said: “Gender equality is one of MUTEK's core values. Joining the Keychange movement in 2018 has definitely acted as a catalyst as we have achieved parity in our programming since. We are proud to belong to this international network which advocates positive change in the music industry.”\n\nToday Keychange announces 7 Canadian organisations who have signed the Keychange gender pledge; the Polaris Music Prize, a not-for-profit organization that annually honours and rewards artists who produce Canadian music albums of distinction, MMF Canada, a non-profit trade association that offers education, networking and advocacy on behalf of its members, their artists, and the wider Canadian music community, plus Folk on the Rocks, Musique NB (MNB), Birthday Cake Media, Kaneshii Vinyl Press, and n10.as. These music businesses have signed the Keychange gender equality pledge towards achieving 50% representation of women and under-represented genders.\n\nAs campaigners for gender equality in music, Keychange invests in emerging talent with a yearly participation programme, whilst continuing to encourage festivals, conferences and a growing range of music organisations and institutions to sign a pledge to include at least 50% women and under-represented genders in their programming, staffing and beyond by 2022. The current list spans 40 countries and over 350 organisations. See the full list here.\n\nIn addition to the ongoing Keychange Pledge, 74 participants – a roster made up of emerging artists and innovators within the music industry – are selected each year from across Europe and Canada to take part in international festivals, showcase events, collaborations and a programme of creative labs. Exceptionally, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Keychange 2020 participants will see their involvement extended until December 2021, in order to allow for travel and development to take place in the following year, with online mentoring, panels, and workshops run by Capacity Building Lead, Chimes until then.
