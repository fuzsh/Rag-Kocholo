        "text": "You have a long-term creative partnership. Is writing music still complicated, or do you have it down?\n\nTegan: I definitely donât feel like we have it down. Every record poses new problems or challenges. In my opinion, whatâs kept our band interesting is that we definitely approach music, our career, production, all of it, pretty differently from one another. Weâre very Yin and Yang. We compliment each other. I do think we push each other, too. Weâre not making a Sara record or a Tegan record everâweâre always making some sort of compromise between where we both want to be.\n\nFor instance, Sara keeps saying to meâsheâs said it about about three times now in the last six monthsâshe keeps talking about Nashville and writing with country singers. That makes me want to quit our band. So annoying. Not because I donât think Nashville or country singers are great, I just wish sheâd stop projecting. I can feel her projecting. I donât know if this is true, but I feel like sheâs annoyed with pop music or annoyed with whatâs happening in the mainstream, so now sheâs picking some sort of alternative direction. I just hate that sheâs trying to influence me to go in that direction.\n\nFirst of all, I donât feel prepared to write a new record now anyway, so why are we even talking about it? Stuff like that will happen, but thatâs our process. Then Iâll start playing things. Like the other day I played some rough demos and Sara basically checked her text messages, then never commented about the song.\n\nSara: Thatâs not true. That is not true! [laughs]\n\nTegan: But thatâs part of the process between Tegan and Sara. Thatâs part of what makes our band cool. First of all, neither one of us is ever blowing hot air at the other one, neither one of us is ever saying what they think the other one wants to hearâneither one of us ever goes out of our way to do that. Itâs not that we donât want to compromise, but we donât start from a place of compromise. We negotiate until we get to a place where weâre both happy. So, we always start by truly projecting what we want. I think we do it in a way thatâs mostly conflict free because itâs a safe space. Sara doesnât have to get the cheerleader pom poms out when I play a new song. She doesnât need to. I know Sara respects me, I know Sara likes what I do. The process is super interesting. From my perspective itâs the same as it always was, it really hasnât changed.\n\nSara: To be fairâ¦ When I think about working in a band or collaborating with each other, itâs so much more serious than a hobby. This isnât a jam band where we get together on the weekend. Teganâs not my child who I have to coddle and help raise her self-esteem. I mean, we are grown women. Weâre 36 years old. At this point, weâve been very lucky to make ourselves a comfortable and exciting career. We didnât get there by lying to each other and saying, âNice song, Tegan. Youâve got some real skills.â Iâm just likeâeither I like it or I donât. Iâm not here to go, âWow, Tegan. It seems like you really spent a great deal of time on those demos.â [both laugh]\n\nTegan, you said youâre not necessarily ready to start working on a new record. When youâre in this space, between records, do you do anything to nourish your creative side? Do you have side projects or do other kinds of things? Or is it more like getting caught up on reading books and doing other stuff?\n\nSara: Kind of all of the above.\n\nTegan: Yeah. Itâs a bit of all of it. I mean, we both write. Even though Iâm not ready to go in and make a new record, I love making music all the time. I love repurposing old demos. Weâre always open to submitting stuff for soundtracks. I definitely keep the creative juices going.\n\nRight now, itâs almost like weâre just taking in everything we possibly can. I think that will influence the record. The longer we wait and the more we read and see films and experience stuff and let time pass, the more interesting our next record will be. Thatâs how I always think about it. Itâs not that I donât like writing, I write in between records. But I still like the longer we wait to write, or the longer we wait to really follow through with those ideas, the better the songs will be because more time will have passed.\n\nSara: Youâre absorbing and hunting and gathering. For me, itâs like all of the things that were influencing me leading up to the record, I need time for those things to get out of my system. I donât want to rush into doing something and then maybe accidentally be still drawn to the same sounds or the same sort of progressions. Right now, itâs really interesting listening to all the production and all the big singles and albums coming out. I almost feel like you have to let that wave go. For me, itâs almost like patience, waiting for that series of breaks to happen. Then I can potentially make space to see whatâs going to come down the pike later. I donât want to make records that sound like whatâs happening right now. You almost need time to absorb enough different things that you create something new.\n\nTegan: I think being uncomfortable, being outside your comfort zone, and being in a room with strangers are really great techniques to challenge yourself. I think also as women, thereâs probably been this thing where Sara and I do have to prove ourselves every time. There is no comfort for me in music. There is no comfort in writing. I canât imagine a timeâI donât know that this is a bad thing eitherâwhere Iâm like, âYeah. Iâm the best,â and so confident. When I see artists talking about how good they are, propping themselves up and talking about how theyâre geniusesâ¦ I just donât ever see a time where Iâll be like that, and Iâm okay with that. It makes me uncomfortable. It makes me have to try harder. I donât think Iâll ever become so comfortable that Iâd just phone it in. I think itâs a strength that we have to constantly prove ourselves.\n\nDo have techniques to help you move past creative blocks?\n\nTegan: If I start to feel bored or blocked or frustrated with something, Iâm comfortable walking away. When I was younger, I pushed through or forced itâ¦ but in the last five or six years, Iâll literally close a session and be like, âIâll go back to this in a day or in a week or two weeks.â The second I give it space, I tend to feel more motivated to go back into it.\n\nIf Iâve written a track and try to come up with a cool melody or whatever, and if I start to feel strained or I canât figure out what to do, I will all of a sudden change the way Iâm listening to it. Iâll put it on different speakers. Iâll walk around or do something else. I have this little trampoline in my studio office; Iâll jump on it and do other things. For me, itâs a change of scenery. Whether itâs something super temporary or a small change just in the house or actually shutting the session down.\n\nSometimes there just needs to be faith. Iâm an earworm person. If something isnât catchyâ¦ or if I work on something for 20 or 30 minutes, stop, and then canât sing the melody back to you, then to me itâs no good. So, I like to delete things. Often I find if Iâm struggling, Iâll erase something because I donât think itâs good. When Iâve written something thatâs good, I just know itâs good. I donât think you can force something to be good. Itâs either good or itâs not.\n\nSara: On one hand, I totally agree with Tegan. But, I also totally disagree. Iâm like, âNo way. You have to work on things for a long to make them good. You canât know after 30 minutes. Thatâs insane.â\n\nTegan: Well, thatâs why I walk away. Thatâs the thingâif Iâm doubtful, Iâll walk away and come back. Thereâs nothing more exciting than working on something, going for dinner or going on tour for three weeks, coming home, opening up a session and being like, âOh shit, that was really good. Why didnât I feel like it was good in the moment?â I have absolutely no problem walking away from things, but I also feel confident that Iâll be able to replace it with something better.\n\nSara: I think this is where weâre very different, because I have a hard time letting things go. I will definitely know when to stop working on something, but Iâll go back to it over and over and over and over again, and think to myself, âMaybe if I hear it fresh, Iâll still want to work on it.â Whereas I know that Tegan probably would have totally trashed the session. Iâll definitely still take little shots at it.\n\nI have songs from a few albums ago where Iâve kept certain lyrics or melodies. Iâll sort of hold onto them and think, âThe rest of this is garbage but this thing still means something. Iâm just not sure exactly how it will fit into the future.â But if I keep revisiting it, one day itâll work. I know this sounds so stupid, but sometimes I almost feel like itâs not the right time for it to happen now. Itâs almost like a science fiction thing where itâs foreshadowing, and it will eventually make sense. Then eventually Iâll open a session and think, âI know exactly what this needs. It needs these lyrics, that line, or that melody from that other thing I did five years ago.â\n\nDo you find the current political situation influencing how you think you want to go forward with your music, or what you want to say with your music?\n\nTegan: For most of our career there would be a push from the queer community, or the LGBTQ community, for Sara and me to be more outspoken about LGBTQ rights. Isnât it powerful enough that weâre two openly queer women who are on the radio? Weâre opening for Katy Perry or Neil Young. Isnât that in itself a really incredible, progressive act? Do we actually have to get up there and draw their attention to it? Then there was the whole part of our career where we were like, âWell, thatâs not good enough, we do want to draw attention.â\n\nOn some level, I often reject this idea that I have to be saying something intensely political to be political. I just feel like at this point, itâs still pretty obvious to me that being outspoken, queer, feminists in the mainstream is already still a pretty political move, if you think about it.\n\nSara: Tegan and I have talked a lot on this recent tour actually, about a few songs off of our new album. When we were making the album, I didnât necessarily think of them as being explicitly political. But in the months after we released the album, suddenly they took on a very different feeling. Thereâs a song on the record, âBe With You,â which for me is a political song about my choice as a queer womanâand just as a human beingânot to participate in marriage. I have an incredibly difficult time with the institution of marriage. I feel like itâs been a struggle for me to participate authentically in the marriage equality movement on a personal level because I just wish we were justâ¦ My politics are radical, and I want to dismantle the institution, not invite gay people in. But then when I step outside of my own personal views, Iâve been really moved by the movement and feel itâs really important in terms of establishing equal rights for LGBTQ people. But interestingly, when we were releasing the album I didnât necessarily think the song was that political.\n\nIn todayâs climate, every night that we play this song, thereâs this really intense, visceral response from people in the audience. I see grown men singing along at the top of their lungs. Iâm like, âWhat does it mean to them? Why is this song resonating?â Sometimes I think to myself, âOh, If Tegan and myself werenât 5â2, pop girls, would it be different?â âIf Fugazi was singing âBe With Youâ would it be like a political anthem?â Is it because weâre not men? Is it because weâre not screaming? Is it because thereâs no guitars, or swords, or blood?\n\nTegan: On this last tour, we just toured through Europe. The reaction to âBe With Youâ was much more visible. Sara and I were hypothesizing backstage about it a few nights in a row. She was saying, âAre they singing along because theyâre also feeling against marriage?â All these gay guys and all these people standing there. I was laughing and saying that my theory was that this was because in most of the countries we just toured in for the last month, gay marriage is not legal. So, to me, when I heard the song the first time, what moved me so profoundly was that I didnât hear it the way that Sara had written it, right? I listen to Saraâs music as if itâs just a song Iâm hearing.\n\nI heard the song as, even though I canât marry you, I donât care, I donât need it, so promise me your first born, so promise me these things, it doesnât matter. So, when I was looking out into the audience in Europe in most of these countries where gay marriage is still not legal, I was seeing these people say, âI love you anyway. It doesnât matter that the institution doesnât accept us.â Itâs just so interesting how differently even Sara and I see the audience and feel that political undertone."
