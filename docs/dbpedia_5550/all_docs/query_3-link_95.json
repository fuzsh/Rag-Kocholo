        "text": "“It is long overdue that those discriminated receive the same opportunities as privileged people. And 2022, there is still a lot to do before equality is achieved in the music business. That's why we support Keychange's work on this very thing…\n\n“I was extremely excited when I learned of the work Keychange is doing. I am humbled and honoured to be a part of a project that is doing so much tangible action on a matter that…\n\n“… I'm very honored to take part in an organization that really wants things to change now and for good, offering real solutions to bring equal opportunities for all genders.”\n\n“It gives me hope that a movement like Keychange exists. In an industry that has always been dominated by men, from labels to opportunities for musicians, I'm so happy I get to be alive to witness…\n\n“After 25 years as a woman in the music biz, I consider it both an honour and an obligation to actively shape the Keychange movement.”\n\n“I am supporting Keychange to recognize and elevate female identified, non-binary and trans people in the music to the level they deserve and need to be heard.”\n\n“Even though the statistics on gender equality in music continue to make for bleak reading, I am ever-hopeful for change when I see the impact Keychange is having and the potential we all have to do more…”\n\n“It is a pleasure to be a part of Keychange as an Ambassador, and to take part in this important aim for positive and necessary improvements in the various genres of the music industry. In the year 2021 it is frankly surprising that there is still a reason to ask questions on ‘what it is like to be a woman composer’ and the like…”\n\n“Music and culture are windows into the soul; they ought to reflect the diversity of the human experience. I applaud Keychange for encouraging those working in the music industry to maintain gender equality and diversity as a guiding principle, and I encourage all consumers of music to demand it….”\n\n“I support Keychange because I think it’s vital that no matter what your religion is, your skin colour, your gender, your sex, your country of origin – no matter who you are, you will have the same chance as anybody else.”\n\n“Creating awareness, finding new solutions together and committing to a better balance in the music industry will not only make it richer in perspective, experience and knowledge it will be more innovative and engaging. Intersectional gender equality requires that we all do the work and become aware of our own privileges. Knowing my own has made me more aware of what I can do in my corner of the world.”\n\n“First it was about making them hear that I could sing. Then it was making them see that I could write songs. And then it was making them understand I could produce. Express yourself in a nice tone and always be grateful! Step by step and never too much. Never be too much. Da Capo.”\n\nBeing a Keychange ambassador encourages me even more as an artistic agent and professional! My role is, and will be, to develop and diffuse artists among the different stages in the world, aswell as looking to add more festivals in Latin America to join the Keychange pledge. Equity today is essential to achieve a sustainable music industry, thats our goal!\n\n“Throughout history, mankind has developed mutual support as a lever for solidarity, to solve many problems and to survive. The world of artistic and musical creation requires a lot of mutual support and initiatives such as Keychange help us work towards balance, inclusion and a future in which all voices are heard in a sustainable music industry.”\n\n\"History tells us everything about what we are living today. From a social and political point of view, our history is very recent, therefore it is mandatory to give a contribution. The important thing, is doing it all together, men and women. The most important thing? increase the participation, artists will do everything else. A person needs participation, numbers and percentage to start a revolution. Emotions and irrationality plays and important role in our job. On the stage concepts are not explained, because they become tangible. \"\n\nWe encourage members of our industry who have tremendous power to sign, fund, promote, nominate, support, acknowledge, and celebrate the diverse population working in the arts today. The demographic breakdown of awards nominations and festival lineups reflects the structural confines of our society and industry. We must do better as it sends an outdated message to the next generation about whose art and voice and message is valuable.\n\n“It’s been challenging for me to cut my own path in the music industry - to stay brave and courageous, despite not quite fitting in with expectations. I’m proud to work with Keychange to make sure underrepresented artists get the opportunities they deserve and to encourage all women and gender minorities to stay true to themselves.”\n\n“Music should be an industry where creative people can express and explore every part of themselves. I found myself through my music, and it’s so important that we support and encourage others to do the same. We have to challenge the structures and stereotypes that exist, break down barriers, and make sure all genders have equal opportunities to be headliners and leaders.”\n\n“Throughout my career, I have often been the only woman in the studio. I've focused on being the best that I can be and and have been recognised with multiple GRAMMY Awards and nominations for my efforts. I hope that by working with Keychange I can inspire others, while advocating for equal opportunities and encouraging progress towards better representation in the studio and beyond.”\n\n“I grew up in Poland, a catholic and patriarchal society. It’s in my blood. It’s my heritage. Fortunately, I don’t know how, but there has always been freedom in my mind. Freedom is my truth. This is my everyday aim also in art. Everybody deserves it, without exception. Our words and actions have power, I believe we have influence on the world around us, even if it’s only our backyard.”\n\n“I’m thrilled to be an ambassador for Keychange for the same reason I’ve been fighting against injustice in Poland as a queer performer and member of Ciężki Brokat - so that everyone can participate in the scene with equal chances.”"
