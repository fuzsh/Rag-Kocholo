        "text": "In the 18 years since the Spice Girls' first album dropped, a long line of U.K. girl groups — and one very popular boy band — have followed the trail to global superstardom they blazed. And while the U.K. has the most robust history of female pop groups, women are riffing on the format all over the world. Here are some new girl groups to obsess over, along with a a couple well-loved favorites, like U.K. X-Factor champs Little Mix and K-pop crossover stars 2NE1.\n\nMembers: Annie, Nadine, and Frankee\n\nGood if you like: Sleek '90s throwback R&B, with rap beats and a dash of reggae swagger\n\nWhy they're killing it: These three can make a killer street banger just as easily as they do a soulful rendition of Brandy and Monica's \"The Boy Is Mine.\"\n\nKey Tracks: \"Wait Your Turn,\" \"Ain't Got Time,\" \"HOT\"\n\nMembers: CL, Dara, Bom and Minzy\n\nGood if you like: EDM, rap, and R&B, mashed into one flashy, trend-conscious package\n\nWhy they're killing it: With their new album, 2NE1 gave K-pop its best-ever sales week in the U.S., and they lead for good reason. They're amazing dancers, create wild, over-the-top videos, and each have a distinct personality.\n\nKey tracks: \"Come Back Home,\" \"I Am the Best,\" \"Lonely\"\n\nMembers: Georgia, Chalin, and Cherish\n\nSounds like: Feel-good '90s R&B/pop\n\nWhy they're killing it: They've been drawing comparisons to acts like the Spice Girls, and their single \"Call You Out\" is a perfect example of how they're pushing \"Girl Power\" in a more grown-up, slick way. (That song's video is an amazing TLC tribute.)\n\nKey track: \"Call You Out\"\n\nMembers: Moa Kikuchi, Yui Mizuno, and Suzuka Nakamoto\n\nGood if you like: Kesha and Slipknot together in one adorable package.\n\nWhy they're killing it: The trio's recently captured the attention of Western media for their sugary sweet pop hooks and badass metal screams, and their video for the hyper-aggressive \"Gimme Chocolate!!\" has clocked in over 4.5 million views on YouTube.\n\nKey tracks:: \"Gimme Chocolate!!,\" \"Megitsune,\" \"Ijime Dame Zettai (No more bullying)\"\n\nMembers: Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, and Jade Thirlwall\n\nGood if you like: Power-vocal R&B and pop music with a electronic house influence\n\nWhy they're killing it: Little Mix was the first group to win the U.K .X-Factor, and the girls have been dominating since — their 2012 debut album DNA hit No. 4 on U.S. Hot 200 chart, breaking the Spice Girls' record for highest debut by a British girl group.\n\nKey tracks: \"Move,\" \"DNA,\" \"How Ya Doin'?\"\n\nMembers: Ally Brooke, Camila Cabello, Normani Hamilton, Dinah Jane Hansen, and Lauren Jauregui\n\nGood if you like: Glossy, bright, and loud jams you can jump up and down to\n\nWhy they're killing it: It's hard to be a girl group in the States, but Fifth Harmony has found success after forming on Season 2 of the X Factor, releasing a debut EP last year and some killer covers on YouTube. But their debut album, they tell Billboard, will veer toward \"cooler\" R&B sounds.\n\nKey tracks: \"Miss Movin' On,\" \"Me & My Girls,\" \"Lego House (Ed Sheeran cover)\"\n\nMembers: Mutya Buena, Keisha Buchanan, and Siobhán Donaghy\n\nGood if you like: Sugababes. Because they are literally the Sugababes — all three original members of the group got back together to reform as MKS in 2011.\n\nWhy they're killing it: The Sugababes were one of the most popular girl groups of the 2000s in the U.K., and now reunited, they're working with artists like Blood Orange to create a sexy 2014 update of their sound. They plan to release an album later this year.\n\nKey tracks: \"Flatline,\" \"Lay Down in Swimming Pools\"\n\nMembers: Ah Moon and Kimi. Former members: Cha Cha, Htike Htike, and Wai-hin.\n\nGood if you like: A politically conscious version of The Pussycat Dolls\n\nWhy they're killing it: Though three of the group's members have departed in the last year, Me N Ma Girls have made quite an impact in the four years they've been together. Myanmar's first all-girl pop group was initially formed as The Tiger Girls by an Australian dancer and Burmese entrepreneur. The group was instrumental in challenging traditional gender roles and pushing for freedom of speech in an especially transformative political period in Burmese culture. They also challenged K-pop and J-pop's fascination with cookie cutter idol groups by addressing and rejecting the pressures in the industry to lighten their skin or adhere to a uniform appearance. The group is signed to American indie Power Music Inc., and while it's unclear whether the two remaining members will go on to release their music, the impact they've made on Myanmar make their music worth checking out, regardless.\n\nKey tracks: \"Girl Strong,\" \"Come Back Home,\" \"Fill Me Up\""
