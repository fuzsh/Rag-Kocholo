        "text": "The Canadian queer icons have become influential advocates, but how did they get here?\n\nBY REAGAN GONZALEZ, IMAGE BY PAMELA LITTKY\n\nTegan and Sara, the Canadian indie pop duo, have not only captivated global audiences with their evocative music but also emerged as influential advocates for the LGBTQIA community. By intertwining their identity and artistry, they have championed inclusivity and awareness, reinforcing their status as both celebrated musicians and prominent voices for change. But how did they get here?\n\nEarly seeds of justice\n\nTegan and Sara have been making music and touring since the late 90s when they were only 18. Their style has been an ever-evolving mix that sings directly to the souls of their loyal fans. Having been openly and proudly out since the very beginning, it was often a tumultuous journey against misogynistic magazine reviews and radio interviews. Unfortunately, these low blows often focused on their sexual orientation. Deciding to speak against these ignorant attacks helped create a safer space for the community and themselves.\n\nIt would be fair to say that the duo has seen more than their share of discrimination based on their gender and sexual orientation. In an ever-changing world, they used their music to help connect the community through concerts and interviews where they often spoke passionately about the issues they were facing. Using their platform to advocate and garner visibility became a way to advocate for themselves and their audience.\n\nBuilding together\n\nFor over 20 years, Tegan and Sara have used music to connect and explore with their fans and the queer community. They’ve made ten albums, toured across the world, and sold over a combined one million records! But they’ve also done other things like produce a TV show about their youth, co-author books, newsletters, and public service work – always connecting them to their love of music and passion for helping the LGBTQIA community.\n\nTegan and Sara have managed to collect many awards during this time, including JUNO Awards, a Governor General’s Performing Arts Award, an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Calgary, and a New York Civil Liberties Union Award in 2018. But one thing that they’re exceptionally proud of is their foundation – The Tegan and Sara Foundation. Helping the LGBTQIA community has meant a lot to them over the years and has made quite a difference in the community of those they strive to work for. At this year’s 2024 JUNO awards, they were honoured with the Humanitarian Award for their ongoing efforts involving the foundation.\n\nThe Tegan and Sara Foundation\n\nThe Tegan and Sara Foundation was founded by the sisters in 2016 after finding an increasing lack of federal funding for LGBTQIA services, undertrained healthcare providers for LGBTQIA patients, and severe workplace discrimination in high proportion toward women. They stated in a public letter, “Through the Tegan and Sara Foundation, we can be proactive with our support rather than wait to react to discrimination as it occurs.” This active approach is helping LGBTQIA youth through summer camp scholarships and community grants. They have also worked with GLMA to compile a list of healthcare providers who can help the LGBTQIA.\n\nInvolving their fan base in raising money for their cause has been effortless since one dollar from every concert ticket goes directly to the foundation. Merch can also be bought to support the foundation along with donating directly. At one show for their recent album, Crybaby, they started auctioning things off of the stage for eager fans. It started in jest when a twelve-year-old fan wanted Sara’s water bottle and evolved from there. They sold several guitar picks and a set list while thanking the fans and explaining more about the Tegan and Sara Foundation before continuing the show.\n\nIt is truly extraordinary how Tegan and Sara, who were already accomplished musicians in their own right, have devoted themselves to becoming notable activists for the LGBTQIA community. Their profound acknowledgement of the impact that they wield has inspired them to launch a successful charitable enterprise. By establishing campaigns aimed at increasing public awareness about healthcare, opportunity, and funding; this duo continues using their artistic platform effectively to create a safer environment for the youth and community.\n\nDIVA magazine celebrates 30 years in print in 2024. If you like what we do, then get behind LGBTQIA media and keep us going for another generation. Your support is invaluable."
