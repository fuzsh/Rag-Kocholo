        "text": "Girl Power is a phrase commonly associated with 1990s chart toppers Spice Girls.\n\nWhile it is destined to be linked to Geri and Co for some time to come, the concept it represents had become known a few years before the group became an international force - in fanzines dedicated to American feminist punk rock bands.\n\nThe power of an all-female band to enthral an audience goes further back into 20th Century history than you may at first think. Close harmony groups Three X Sisters and The Boswell Sisters had a following before and after the USAâs Wall Street Crash of 1929. As the Second World War eclipsed the globe, The Andrews Sisters, with their strong military theme, became a source of morale at home and for the troops posted hundreds of miles from family and friends.\n\nWhen the 1940s rolled into the 50s and 60s and beyond, acts with an all-female personnel continued to make their mark on popular culture, and the pop charts. Groups became involved in causes including the civil rights movement and spoke out on issues such as body image. Bitesize took a look at a few of those moments when music and real-life merged.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement was sweeping through the USA in the 1960s. In August 1963, The Shirelles performed at a fundraiser in Alabama, which aimed to raise enough money for activists to attend the March on Washington. A few weeks later, Martin Luther King would deliver his famous âI have a dreamâ speech in Washington DC.\n\nThe Shirellesâ music was popular with all audiences. Some see their success as a reflection of the Civil Rights Movement, and theyâre often credited as one of the pioneers of the girl group genre.They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\nBananarama\n\nBananarama were the biggest girl band of the 80s, scoring 10 top 10 hits â including the classic Venus - and a Guinness World Record for the most worldwide chart entries of any all-female group.\n\nFounded in 1979, in the aftermath of the punk era, the trio made their mark in an industry that was still mostly male dominated. Their signature look featured overalls, baggy t-shirts and leather boots.\n\nAs well as singer Jody Watley from R&B band Shalamar, Bananarama were the only women to feature in the Band Aid charity classic Do They Know Itâs Christmas?, which aimed to raise money for anti-famine efforts in Ethiopia.Five years later, Keren Woodward and Sara Dallin were back performing in Band Aid 2, another Christmas number one.\n\nFKA twigs recently told Louis Theroux of her admiration for Woodward and Dallin, as well as Siobhan Fahey â one of the group's founding members who went on to set up Shakespears Sister in the late 80s.\n\nTLC\n\nHIV and the importance of safe sex were ongoing global issues when this trio (Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins, Rozanda \"Chilli\" Thomas and the late Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes) from Atlanta, Georgia, were riding high in the charts.\n\nIn 1994, their second album CrazySexyCool promoted HIV awareness, as well as other warnings against harmful lifestyles. Their number one hit Waterfalls includes stories in its verses of two different people who meet a premature death through their behaviour. Although HIV is not explicitly mentioned, the lyrics refer to âthree little lettersâ which ended one personâs life. It was a first for a US number one single.\n\nDestiny's Child\n\nSay My Name remains one of this girl groupâs catchiest tunes, though it took Destinyâs Child nearly a decade since forming in 1990 to really get noticed.\n\nIn 2000, Independent Women Part 1 was a massive hit from the Charlieâs Angels soundtrack, with lyrics celebrating financial stability for women who donât need to rely on a man for their liefstyle.\n\nLater, BeyoncÃ© Knowles emerged from the group as one of the new millenniumâs powerhouse personalities, and among many stand out performances and hit singles was her rendition of Formation at the 2016 Super Bowl half-time show.\n\nIn keeping with a theme of independent women, the star decided to manage herself post Destinyâs Child and has become a figurehead for feminism and equality in the era of #metoo and Black Lives Matter."
