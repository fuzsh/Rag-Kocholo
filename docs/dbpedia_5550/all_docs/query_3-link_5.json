        "text": "Article content\n\nBetween selling over a million records, chart-topping singles and numerous awards along the way, multi-Platinum pop duo Tegan and Sara have always used their platform for good. The Calgary-born singer-songwriters have been a beacon for queer, female artists in an industry fraught by sexism; openly calling out the misogyny and homophobia they’ve been experiencing since their earliest career beginnings. At this year’s JUNO Awards, they’re set to be honoured with the 2024 Humanitarian Award for their many charitable contributions across their 25-year career.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEnjoy the latest local, national and international news.\n\nExclusive articles by Conrad Black, Barbara Kay and others.

Later singles such as “Feel It In My Bones,” and “Body Work” would see a move towards more traditional, synth-infused pop, and by late 2012, they topped the Billboard dance charts with “Closer.” Bolder and primed for the mainstream, their lyrics started to tackle the ups and downs of their romantic relationships with women in a more direct way; with songs like Love You the Death lead single “Boyfriend” exploring how heteronormative expectations and commitment issues collide.\n\nEschewing the strict gender norms of pop music meant doubling down on their identity, carving out space for queer visibility in their videos, and connecting with a global fan base who felt seen. Their work has even made inroads in other artistic mediums, reaching new audiences in the process. Their award-winning memoir High School, detailing their experience as queer teenagers growing up in the 90s, was developed into a critically acclaimed series for Amazon Freevee — but their advocacy extends beyond their own individual identities.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAppearing on the cover of Under The Radar Magazine’s protest issue back in 2012, the sisters held up a sign that read: The rights of the minority should never be subject to the whim of the majority,” a clear call to push back against the political power imbalances that deeply affect marginalized communities in both Canada and the U.S. It’s that advocacy, and its commitment to action, that acts as the pair’s north star—the throughline that connects all parts of their life’s work.\n\nThey credit their politically active mother for imbuing them with their understanding of the widespread need for social justice, taking them to pro-choice and women’s marches from an early age. “It felt very natural when we started our career to continue her work in our own. As our profile has grown, our investment in causes that matter to us has too,” they said in an interview with the Canadian Museum of Human Rights. Since then, they’ve lent their voices to causes that mattered to them; from the legislation of same-sex marriage across the U.S. to taking on sexism in the media.\n\nWhen North Carolina passed a bill to restrict public washroom use for trans people, the duo donated the proceeds from their Asheville show to Equality North Carolina; prompting other artists to do the same. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and a turning point for conversations about police violence, they joined the chorus of artists speaking out about racial injustice; “We must educate ourselves. We must volunteer. We must sign petitions. We must invest everything we have into the fight. The system is unjust,” they wrote in an Instagram post in early 2020 in the wake of the murder of George Floyd.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn 2016, they launched Tegan and Sara foundation with the goal of improving the everyday lives of LGBTQ+ women and girls; an intersection of identities that face economic, social and healthcare inequality. They work alongside other grassroots organizations and even major brands to offer important supports in the form of community grants, funding to support LGBTQ-focused summer camps and to increase the attendance of young women and girls from vulnerable communities, resources to improve healthcare access, and championing teacher-backed initiatives to bring more LGBTQ+ inclusive literature into to the classroom.\n\nThe impact of their work hasn’t gone unnoticed. Tegan and Sara received the Governor General’s Performing Arts Award in 2018 and Honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from the University of Calgary. At this year’s JUNO Awards taking place on March 24, Academy Award®-nominated actor Elliot Page will present them with the 2024 Humanitarian Award, joining them with previous honorees including Sarah McLaughlan and Chantal Kreviazuk.\n\nThis story was provided by The JUNO Awards for commercial purposes.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
