        "text": "Scroll Down\n\n— compiled by Debjani Hazarika\n\nNorth-east part of India has always been known for its nature, beauty and music. In the last decade, the region has seen tremendous growth in the indie music scene. While most of the festivals and events are dominated by male bands, females of the region aren't waiting for a better time. Although female music groups are not new among northeasterners, the region has seen rapid growth of all female bands who are well equipped to play from folk to jazz, rock 'n' roll to metal. Below are ten such female bands who have been defying the stereotypical thought process and building faith in women empowerment with their music and team spirit.\n\n1. Tetseo Sisters (Nagaland)\n\nTetseo Sisters from Nagaland\n\nThe Tetseo Sisters are the true cultural ambassadors of the North East performing the traditional folk music of Nagaland vocally as a band in many popular live shows across the country and abroad. The amazing four sisters known by the names, Mercy, Alune, Kuvelu and Azi have spent their young lives promoting the nearly forgotten music of the Chakhesang tribe that they have inherited. They have been featured in numerous cultural events and are regulars at Music Festivals around the country including Hornbill Music Festival, Storm Festival, North East Festival, Kalakshetra Foundation, Cultures of Peace series, Folk Nations and more recently at the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo 2014. The dialect in which they sing is known as the Chokriand the regional song that they sing is known as ‘Li’, from the traditional songbook better known as ‘Li Kukre Kutiko’ in which there are approx of 223 songs enlisted in it. Their pure dedication towards their work has helped them to add a lot of awards in their kitty. Traditional folk instruments like tati (an one-stringed instrument) and heka libuh (horn of mithun) are played along the songs to maintain the essence of the folk music.\n\n2. Afflatus (Meghalaya)\n\nAfflatus from Meghalaya\n\nAffalatus, the four young ladies band, began their blues influenced rock act in 2004. Affalatus are made up of experienced musicians in their own right with Mercy, Karen, Sharon and Grace. There is an enigmatic spirit within their rock and reggae mix music that’s highlighted by a more than strange female bravado. According to the band members, their journey was “inspirational” that never lost sight of the one thread, one passion, one love that binds them together; the love of creating music. Afflatus is said to be the emergence of a truly international sound, having the record label with India. Although the band is influenced simply by life itself, but the band can't deny the fact that they are also influenced by the sounds of the Beatles, RHCP, Flux Pavillion and Bruno Mars. Their debut performance as Afflatus in 2004 won them an award and that too at the national level. Since then, Afflatus, have come a long way with a debut album in the making, numerous high profile concerts under their belt and the emergence of a truly international sound.\n\n3.

The sisters Worshon, Singchon and Thotyaphy Muivah from Manipur, formed the New Delhi based group in the late October 2011. The band mainly plays classic rock punctuated by a stylized pinch of contemporary vocals and alternative riffs – an obsession with sweet medleys.\n\nMinute of Decay's preparatory is laced with a fine example of foresight and discipline from their parents. Their own love affair with music, they ensured, would survive into the next generation through their children, even if it means an all-girls situation.\n\n6. The Chosen (Mizoram)\n\nThe Chosen (Mizoram)\n\nA bunch of six talented girls from Aizawl got together by their same love for music in 2009.

Vivance - Naga Girls (Nagaland)\n\nVivance - Naga Girls (Nagaland)\n\nThis four piece pop band from Dimapur is an offspring of collective efforts punched by Mhonyamo Kikon and Meyi to introduce a catchy flavor of girl power into the Nagaland music scene. 'Vivance' consists of Livika Swu (Vocals), Nukshinaro Imchen (Guitars), Vekutalu Swuro (Piano) and Onen (bass guitar).\n\nFormed on November 25, 2013, the band’s style of playing is considered to have a blend of pop rock, and Indie, so they call themselves an experimental Pop/Indie rock band, the joy and to uplift and empower women in the state. In 2014, the band has released their Debut EP Dream Out Loud. Although the band is still quite young, their foot-tapping music has helped them gather quite the fanbase.\n\nEdited by - Jim Ankan Deka"
