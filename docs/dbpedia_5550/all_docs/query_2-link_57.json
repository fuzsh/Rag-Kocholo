        "text": "All tomorrow’s indies\n\nThe post-Yugoslav 1990s seemed to inspire women to take up guitars and synths merely in joint efforts with men. If there weren’t for Boye, one would have hard time finding, or listening to a serious female band at concerts. Noughties, nevertheless brought about a huge change. All-women bands have been popping up all over the place ever since.\n\nFor starters, let’s squeeze in here a band that technically isn’t 100% female. It comes from a small town near Požega, Croatia, and does not at all throw shame on melodic, pop punk. Funny enough, in the beginnings Tina and Ana, who are apparently sisters, used a rhythm machine instead of drums as nobody wanted to play with them. In the end, they managed to find a drummer, and The Rock Flock was ready for take-off. However, the flight hasn’t lasted for more than a few years which is a shame because they were awesome. This one is from their debut album.\n\nThe Rock Flock – Mess (You Can’t Catch Me In Your Collection LP, 2008)\n\nWhile the above flock that goes by the name of Rock arguably played punk, the girls from Vibrator U Rikverc, who are often addressing themselves as members of a punk band, most probably play all sorts of indie pop rock rather than punk. They are nevertheless fantastic and one cannot but love the power, genuinity and determination of their songs. Interestingly they formed to act as a band in a movie and kept playing for ten years. Here’s their kinky take on karaoke that even Boye might aprove of (hint: you might find an English version of this one on a certain horror film soundtrack released in Italy):\n\nVibrator u rikverc – Porno karaoke (single, 2009)\n\nPunčke are one of the most amazing all-female rock bands that came from the region in the last couple of decades. It’s not hard to like their early EPs and the first two albums. No wonder they supported the Queens of the Stone Age both at Ljubljana and at Zagreb gigs in 2014. They are currently on hiatus and we hope they will be back soon. In the meanwhile, go find a cool documentary about them on Youtube and check their videos, for instance this awesome dreamy, poppish single from a few years back:\n\nPunčke – Petra Pan (single, 2012)\n\nA cherry on top. Known as Ž/Buka in its former incarnation, this has been the most amazing all-women band in the region for a while now. Why? Well, it’s not like this is a competition or anything, but listening to them I have always felt much more puzzled than with other bands. I was irritated and contented at the same time so to speak. Whether it’s post-, kraut-, experimental-rock, shoegaze or whatever one detects in their efforts, it doesn’t really matter. It always feels like these sounds are here to stay. Plus the lyrics are just pure gold. Ladies and lads, here are Žen!"
