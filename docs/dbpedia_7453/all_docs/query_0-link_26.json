        "text": "The fact that Rob Ford, who has died of cancer aged 46, was filmed smoking crack cocaine did not make him unique among mayors of major North American cities; Marion Barry of Washington DC was actually re-elected after finishing a term in prison for drug possession. But the way in which Ford retracted his previous denials of the footage was unique. “Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine but am I an addict? No. Have I tried it? Um, probably, in one of my drunken stupors.”\n\nFord was mayor of Toronto from 2010 to 2014, a tumultuous term of office which bounced between scandal and controversy, going beyond the usual political infighting of a city government, with an escalating pattern of offensive speech, erratic behaviour and public intoxication, and accusations of serious crimes including domestic violence, blackmail and assault.\n\nEach charge against him was met with brazen denials and counteraccusations. He called a Toronto Star reporter who was photographing Ford’s house, and adjoining public lands which were in dispute, a paedophile sneaking shots of his children. When a female councillor accused him of making a lewd advance, he replied in insulting terms. His denials were often made through the talk-radio platform he shared with his brother Doug, who won Rob’s city council seat when his brother became mayor. Even the radio show was marked by scandal, when it turned out that Ford’s director of operations was also the frequent, supportive caller billed only as “Dave from Scarborough”.\n\nThis constituted part of Ford’s appeal as a rightwing populist. In some ways Ford was to Canada’s Progressive Conservative movement what Donald Trump has been to US Republicans, though his media presence echoed that of rightwing shock jocks such as Rush Limbaugh. But Ford’s political success grew from more traditional roots, in his effective performance on behalf of his city council constituency, Ward 2, which lies in Toronto’s north-west suburb of Etobicoke, one of six cities which had been independent parts of Metro Toronto until being “amalgamated” into the City of Toronto in 1998. Even after the scandals, Ford stepped down as mayor only because of his illness, and was re-elected to the city council in Ward 2 when he did.\n\nFord was born in Etobicoke, youngest of four children of Diane (nee Campbell) and Douglas Ford Sr. His father was a millionaire whose company, Deco Labels, made adhesive stickers for plastic-wrapped groceries. As a high-schooler, Rob was obsessed by Canadian (gridiron) football, and though he made the team when he started at Carleton University in Ottawa, he never played, and after his first year quit to return home and work as a salesman for his father.\n\nHe followed his father into politics; Doug Sr served as a Progressive Conservative member of the Ontario provincial legislature from 1995 until 1999; in 1997 Rob ran for city council in Ward 3, finishing fourth. In 1999, in an eerie prefiguring of later scandal, he was arrested in Miami and convicted of driving under the influence; charges of marijuana possession were dropped.\n\nIn 2000, he was elected to the Toronto city council from Ward 2. He capitalised on resentment of the “big-city” politicians; Ford’s campaigns, in a working-class district with a high immigrant population, portrayed him as an opponent of lifelong politicians, special-interest groups, and leftwingers in general. Independently wealthy, he chose the issue of councillors’ expenses as his showcase. Once in office, he was always available to constituents, following up quickly on their small concerns.\n\nSoon after winning the election, Ford married Renata Brejniak and moved to a smarter district. He was football coach at a local high school, until he was dismissed in 2001 after a conflict with a player. He was then hired by a Catholic high school, to which he donated funds for equipment; he also started a foundation to help school football in the area. He would later be found to have abused his position on the city council by using its stationery to write fundraising letters for his football foundation, and fined; this decision was overturned after he became mayor.\n\nHe voted against bicycle lanes, likening cycling in the city to “swimming with sharks”. He voted against programmes to fight Aids, because it struck only “gays or drug addicts”, then amended that to include “women who sleep with bisexuals”. He commented that “oriental people work like dogs”. In 2006, he was removed from a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey match after drunkenly insulting out-of-town tourists, and arrested on domestic violence charges which were later dropped. He was re-elected twice with large majorities.\n\nIn 2010, Ford won a three-way mayoral election in which he swept the six “amalgamated” cities, while losing most of central Toronto to the runner-up. At his inauguration, he was introduced by the ice-hockey commentator Don Cherry, who said: “Put that in your pipe, you leftwing kooks.”\n\nAs mayor, Ford balanced budgets by drawing on surpluses, cutting back on services, looking to sell off city assets, and raising property taxes in the midst of Toronto’s construction boom. His biggest battles came over public transport, Ford backing more expensive subway extensions into the suburbs rather than the light rail plans which had previously been mooted. He claimed: “Everyone deserves subways here.”\n\nHe was accused of using city agencies to benefit his family’s firm, but increasingly his personal behaviour became the focus of criticism, peaking with a wild St Patrick’s Day party in 2012 which moved between City Hall and a local bar. That year, his brother-in-law was convicted of possession of heroin and cocaine; he was beaten in prison and later sued Ford, saying the beating was to keep him quiet about Ford’s own drug use.\n\nThen, in May 2013, the website Gawker reported they had been offered a video of Ford smoking crack. Ford claimed this was “absolutely not true”, though it emerged that the drug dealers who shot the video had tried to blackmail him with it months earlier. His public behaviour became increasing erratic, while staff resigned and it became known he had been subject to police surveillance for months before the Gawker revelations.\n\nFinally, in mid-November, the courts released both the video and a full transcript of the investigations. The city council voted to strip Ford of most of his powers, and requested he take a leave of absence, which he refused. In 2014, when he cast the only votes against honouring both the Canadian Olympic team and Nelson Mandela, he claimed to have accidentally pushed the wrong voting button both times.\n\nFord finally took his leave of absence to enter rehab in April 2014 after another crack video appeared. He returned to the mayor’s office in the summer, intending to run for re-election, but that September was diagnosed with an abdominal tumour and withdrew. Treating the tumour, doctors discovered Ford was also suffering from a liposarcoma, an aggressive soft-tissue cancer.\n\nDoug ran for mayor in his place, and lost the election to the former Ontario Progressive Conservative leader John Tory, whom Rob had beaten in 2010. Ford won back his old city council seat, taking Ward 2 with nearly 60% of the vote. The tumour on his abdomen was removed and he went through prolonged chemotherapy before the cancer resurfaced in his bladder.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, his son, Doug, and daughter, Stephanie."
