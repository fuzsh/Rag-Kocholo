        "text": "Re-elected to city council, Rob Ford is already hinting at a mayoral run in 2018.\n\nJohn Tory was elected mayor of Toronto with 40.27 per cent of the vote on Monday night. That was approximately 64,000 votes ahead of Doug Ford, and 168,000 more than Olivia Chow.\n\nWhile the Ford brothers both congratulated Tory on his victory, Rob Ford hinted that he'll be back on the mayoral ballot for the next election.\n\n\"If you know anything about the Ford family it's that we never ever give up, and I guarantee you in four years you will see another example,\" he told supporters during his acceptance speech Monday night.\n\n\"Action speaks louder than words. Just watch in four more years, folks.\"\n\nRob Ford, who held Toronto's top job since 2010, dropped out of the race after he was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. He ran for city council in Ward 2, Etobicoke North instead, where he easily won with 58.8 per cent of the vote. His closest contender Luke LaRocque garnered 10.9 per cent support.\n\nAfter entering the mayoral race in his brotherâ€™s stead, Doug Ford campaigned against Tory, challenging his \"Smart Track\" transit plan and lack of experience in City Hall. In the end, the Fords conceded that the \"people have made their decision.\"\n\nEarly voter turnout tallies suggest more than 60 per cent of eligible voters cast ballots, the highest rate since amalgamation in 1998."
