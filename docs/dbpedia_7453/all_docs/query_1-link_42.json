        "text": "After a courageous battle with cancer, Fire Lieutenant Robert Ford Sr. passed away on October 24, 2021 at the age of 48. Lieutenant Robert was a 16-year veteran with the Wakefield Fire Department, Massachusetts.\n\nFord was born on December 3, 1972. He remained a lifelong resident of Wakefield and married his high school sweetheart, Michelle, with whom he raised three amazing children. Ford was a dedicated and compassionate man who loved his community. He displayed the American flag with great pride and all of his duty to serve, protect and save lives. His infectious positive energy, coupled with his warm, inviting nature, made you want to spend time with him.\n\nWhether sitting on the beach in Manomet, spending time around a fire pit, watching the Patriots, or skiing with friends and family, this was a man who lived his life to the fullest.\n\nLieutenant Ford’s family members recall that he met each day with a smile, and a joke or two. He was a loving husband and caring father and cherished his time with family and friends. He is survived by his wife, Michelle, of 21 years and three children, Robert Jr., Caroline, and Michael."
