        "text": "They say it is vital to collect history, but there are a few with passion. As people get older, we get it. There is always so much to learn about what went on in the past, and we want to save it for the future. It is only proper therefore that we pay our tribute to those historic forebears of ours who left their home and friends, in an old country to face unknown dangers and hardships in a new country. James Ford was born in Tullyaron, County Tyrone Ireland in 1801 and in 1830 he married Sarah Matilda McCallister (1810-1862) in Armagh County in Northern Ireland. Their children: Margaret Jane Ford, James Ford, Annabelle Ford, Letticia Marie Ford, Robert D. Ford 1840-1860, died at the young age of 20, Thomas William Ford, Richard J. Ford, Sarah M. Ford and Amelia C. Ford. James, his wife Sarah and Robert D. Ford were buried at the Coldsprings St. Paul’s United Church. Pictured below is the historical Daymon Family home.\n\nThis short post remembers two other founding families of Camborne Ontario. William Hore, his wife Elizabeth and a son arrived from Camborne, Cornwall England and raised eight children here at was originally named Spring Mills. William built the his first sawmill here northeast of the present day bridge crossing the Camborne stream. He utilized a primitive up/down saw blade operated by turbine power using a small pond of water to provide its power. Later, Mr. Hore’s second saw mill used a much larger dam with it’s mill pond water to power his rotary blade saw in his new tub and pail factory. At this time the mill was producing an amazing 6,000 buckets a year! William soon built his one and a half story frame house nearby and even later a steam powered grist mill. The original Mill House was later purchased by James Ford and was home to generations of Fords until the mid 1990’s when George & Velma Ford passed away. Another early settler, Joseph Lean and family must be mentioned here, having owned a large tract of land on which the southern half of the village later developed. The Lean family name has never been fully recognized for their many contributions to the village.\n\n“A Life Lease: William Hore, Camborne, miller, to his son’s Samuel and Joseph Hore being composed of the north half of Lot number 20, in the 4th Concession of Hamilton Township, County of Northumberland and the Province of Ontario. William Hore was granted a Crown Grant for the property in 1855. In 1869 for unknown reasons, this Life Lease was terminated and Mr. Hore sold both the farm and his mills”.\n\nFebruary 1869, a Deed of Land between William and Esther Hore to James Ford in consideration of $1840, sold sixty-five acres of Lot 20 to James Ford. April 1870, an Indenture between James Ford to Richard John Ford and to Thomas William Ford was issued, Richard was to receive 100 acres of the south half of Lot 26 on the 6th Concession of Hamilton Township, today the Dayman family on what is now Morton Road. Thomas William Ford was to receive the 65 acres on the 4th Concession of Hamilton Township on Mill Street, now known as Albert’s Alley. In 1883 Thomas Ford purchased the farm from a Mr. Hicks of the Union Loan & Savings Company. In 1901 Frederick Ford purchased this farm. A Deed of Land from March 19, 1947 between Frederick W. Ford and Mary Agnes Ford, his wife and George Francis Ford stated that George F. Ford also purchased Lot #19, east of the Gravel Road (Kennedy Road) consisting of 34 acres of land from Charles Yeaman. This property is now owned by Bordon and Barbara Taylor and families. The former Mill House on Albert’s Alley today is almost unrecognizable as it has gone through many changes and alterations over the years. Pictured below is the home.\n\nA deed of Land November, 1868: “A parcel of land containing Eleven Acres, (Camborne Grist Mills) more or less and also all that part of said lot now covered by water of the Mill’s pond on said lot and the right of all times to overflow by water of the said pond. The mortgage of which was for $800 which was assumed by James Ford”. There were many other Grist Mill owners and stakeholders over the years. Thomas R. Barker, James Clark, Isaac Moynes, Jesse Smith, Russell Witherington, Richard J. Blacklin, Truman McEvers, Bank of Montreal and the Union Loan & Savings Company. In 1881 the steam powered Grist Mill “with a substantial stone foundation of 35 to 40 feet in length” was destroyed by fire. A Conveyance of September 1883 between The Union Loan & Savings Company, Samuel Moore Hicks and Thomas William Ford stated “that a loan of $3900 by Hicks was in default in payment shortly after and the destruction of a certain mill by fire”. Thomas William Ford agreed to purchase the mill property. The former Grist Mill property is now owned by Pat and Carol Doyle of the former Camborne Ski Club.\n\nPictured above on the William Hore – James Ford Historical Pedestrian Bridge are seven of George & Velma Ford’s children. Left to right: Eleanor (Morris), Barbara, Linda (Tait), Patrica (Lang), Georgina (West), William (Bill), Edgar and Gary. Missing from the picture is Ronald Ford. Deceased children: Margaret (Purcell) and Sharon (Heath).\n\nRegards, Ranger."
