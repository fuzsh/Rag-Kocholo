        "text": "I live in Bristol and Chisinau, I am married to Genevieve and we have three daughters. I was born and educated in Shropshire where my father was a coal miner. I studied politics and history at the University of York before starting my teaching career at Bootham School in York. I was heavily influenced by the school's Quaker internationalism and went on to get my PGCE at Aberystwyth University. I taught and led my history department in Bristol for many years and set up the International Baccalaureate as a lead international education school. I obtained my Masters and NPQH and led the Sixth Form at Royal Wootton Bassett School and later as deputy head in Crickhowell in Wales. I am Director of Heritage International School in Chisinau, Moldova, the first international school in Moldova based on global learning principles. I was previously Principal of Wyedean School, Gloucestershire, where for fours years I led a school nationally and internationally known for its innovative holistic curriculum and developed model of global learning. I have been a senior leader in leading schools in Wales and England. I am committed as an educator and school leader to the principles of international education & global learning, the IB as well as the power of transformative digital learning, sustainability & creativity in developing the learner holistically. I am a long serving British Council Ambassador and have worked with and advised schools and school boards on global learning, leadership, curriculum and school improvement education policy around the World. I was the founder co-chair of the IB SW region of schools. I have served as a trustee of the Windfall Trust, a children's charity in mid Wales and of a trustee of the education training group Adfecto.\n\nRead full bio"
