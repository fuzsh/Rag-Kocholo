        "text": "Perhaps the last great western, The Assassination of Jesse James boasts an incredible cast, a brilliant and moving script, and, of course, Roger Deakins’ lush cinematography, which beautifully evoked 19th Century America, earning him another Oscar nomination.\n\nThe names ricochet through Western lore. Jesse James (Brad Pitt) was the most notorious outlaw of his time, wanted by the law in ten states yet celebrated as a Robin Hood in newspapers and dime novels.\n\nTeenaged Robert Ford (Casey Affleck) idolized Jesse, sought his friendship, rode with him. It wasn’t enough. The up-and-comer wanted his shot at fame. And when he got it, he took it.\n\nPitt gives a volcanic, charismatic performance as Jesse in this saga of celebrity and obsession adapted from Ron Hansen’s historical novel by director Andrew Dominik (Chopper). “They’re all lies,” Jesse says of the stories surrounding him. A deeper, more human truth awaits in this ambitious and stirring epic film."
