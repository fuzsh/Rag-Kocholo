        "text": "Father Douglas Bruce Ford (Sr.) represented the riding of Etobicoke-Humber in the Ontario provincial legislature from 1995 to 1999, for the Progressive-Conservative party. He was a \"backbencher\", meaning a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) that did not hold a position in Premier Mike Harris' cabinet.\n\n[to members of Toronto City Council, after being stripped of most of his mayoral powers] This, folks, reminds me of when, and I was watching with my brother, when Saddam attacked Kuwait, and President Bush said, \"I warn you. I warn you. I warn you. Do not.\" Well, folks, if you think American style politics is nasty, you guys have just attacked Kuwait."
