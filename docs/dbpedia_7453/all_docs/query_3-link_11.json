In his later years, he performed paid re-enactments of the killing at events.\n\nOn June 8, 1892, Ford was shot by Edward Capehart O'Kelley.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nRobert Ford was born in Ray County, Missouri, to James Thomas (1813-1890) and Mary Bruin Ford (1818-1893) as the youngest of seven.\n\nKilling Jesse James[]\n\nOn April 3, 1882, Bob Ford, his brother Charley, and James went into the living room of Jesse's home before travelling to Platte City. James turned around and noticed a dusty picture above the mantel in hus home, and stood on a chair in order to clean it. Robert Ford drew his weapon and shot James in the back of the head for the big reward, and for the fame."
