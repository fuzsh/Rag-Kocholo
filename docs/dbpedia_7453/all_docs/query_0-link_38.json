        "text": "Robert Bertram (“Bert”) Ford was an engineer and contractor. He was also involved in automobile sales for a short time.\n\nHe lived at 2060 Comox Street in 1915 and 1916.\n\nFamily Background\n\nRobert Bertram Ford was born on July 26, 1883, in London, England.\n\nHis parents were Robert Ford (1853–1901) and Susan Jane Sampson (1856–1925). They were married on October 17, 1882.\n\nRobert Ford was a dispensing chemist who lived at 20 Connaught Road, Stroud Green, London, in 1897. He died on May 26, 1901.\n\nSusan Ford died on April 6, 1925.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBert went to Merchant Taylors’ School from September 1892 to 1894.\n\nIn 1901, he was a student at King’s College in London.\n\nMarriage to Ethel Langer\n\nBert married Ethel Langler in Ealing, West London in early 1911.\n\nEthel was born in March 1886.\n\nHer parents were Charles Langler (1855-1909) and Martha Bowden Ekers (1854–1955).\n\nTo Vancouver\n\nShortly after their marriage, Bert and Ethel travelled to Canada.\n\nBy mid-1911, Bert was working in Vancouver as a road contractor.\n\nBert and Ethel were living in the Manhattan Apartments at 784 Thurlow Street in Vancouver.\n\nIn 1912 and 1913, Bert was in an engineering and contracting business with John S. Bruce and Robert Bruce, using the name of Bruce and Ford.\n\nBert and Ethel were living in apartment 32 of the Broughton Apartments at 1091 Broughton Street.\n\nIn 1914, Bert had become the managing director of the Forshaw Ford Automobile Company Ltd., which had a new building at 418 Georgia Street.\n\nThe company was the Vancouver distributor for Cole and Studebaker cars. The “Ford” in the company name was Bert Ford, and the company appears to have had no connection with the Ford Motor Company. Hamilton Read, a Vancouver lawyer, was the president of the company. Thomas Guy Forshaw was the sales manager of the company.\n\nBy 1915, Bert was back in the contracting business. He was living at 2060 Comox Street.\n\nThe 1916, Vancouver directory indicated that Bert was in the rubber goods business, along with Harry Ratheram Sayer (1876-1946), who also lived at 2060 Comox Street.\n\nMilitary Service\n\nIn February 1916, Bert enlisted as a lieutenant in the Canadian Expeditionary Force. He was with the Second Tunnelling Company.\n\nHis officer’s declaration stated that Ethel was living at “The Cottage, Creffield Road, Ealing, London, England.”\n\nBert was killed in action on June 2, 1916. He was commemorated at Ypres (Menin Gate) Memorial in West-Vlaanderen, Belgium.\n\nEthel: Later Life\n\nShortly after the war, Ethel was living at 232 Willesden Lane in London, England.\n\nIn 1930, she was living at 104 Maida Vale in London, England. (Her sister, Miss Mabel Langler, was at number 105 Maida Vale.)\n\nIt appears that Ethel was still living in 1941, when her son, Keith Langler Ford, died while on military service during the Second World War.\n\nNo further information is available for Ethel\n\nBert and Ethel had one son.\n\nKeith Langler Ford\n\nKeith Langler Ford was born on December 6, 1913.\n\nHe died on December 19, 1941.\n\nSources\n\nRobert Ford (grandfather of Robert Bertram Ford)\n\nRobert Ford (1811-1897), http://www.geni.com/people/Robert-Ford/6000000016429296075\n\nMarriage settlement: 1 Louisa Gent of Plymouth, spinster; 2 Robert Ford of Ivybridge, http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/rd/912c88a9-d1c9-46f2-bdb6-ee1f265598e6.\n\nLouisa Ford, detailed death certificate, date of death: April 1, 1878; place of death: Ivybridge Ermington; age: 66 years; occupation: wife of Robert Ford, a landed proprietor, http://www.bafhs.org.uk/research-room/certificates/unwanted-death-certificates/article/43-ford.\n\n“England and Wales Census, 1871,” index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:V5T2-DZ2 : accessed 17 May 2015), Robert Ford, Ridgway, Plympton St Mary, Devonshire, England; from “1871 England, Scotland and Wales census,” database and images, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : n.d.); citing PRO RG 10, folio 13, p. 20, Plympton St Mary registration district, Plympton subdistrict, ED 1, household 112, The National Archives, Kew, Surrey; FHL microfilm 831,791.
