        "text": "Robert Newton “Bob” Ford (January 31, 1862 – June 8, 1892) was an American outlaw best known for killing his gang leader, Jesse James, in 1882.\n\nIn the Oscar-nominated film, “The Assassination of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford” (2007), Casey Affleck (who bears a striking resemblance to the historical figure) played Robert Ford, opposite Brad Pitt, as Jesse James.\n\nThe film is considered as one of the most historically accurate portrayals of Jesse James and Robert Ford, even by James’ descendants, who found both performances more realistic and true to history than the dozens that came before them.\n\nVideo comes courtesy of YouTube:\n\nThat was Hollywood’s view.\n\nHere’s the history:\n\nFord’s Early years\n\nRobert Ford was born in Ray County, Missouri, to James Thomas Ford and his wife, the former Mary Bruin.\n\nAs a young man, he became an admirer of Jesse James for his American Civil War record, and for James’s criminal exploits. In 1880, he finally met James.\n\nFord’s brother Charles is believed to have taken part in the James gang’s Blue Cut train robbery in Jackson County near Glendale, Missouri (now part of Independence), on September 7, 1881.\n\nJoining the James Gang\n\nIn November 1881, Jesse James moved his family to St. Joseph, Missouri. He intended to give up crime, but first wanted to stage one last robbery at Blue Cut, Missouri.\n\nThe James gang had been greatly reduced in numbers by that time. Some had fled the gang in fear of prosecution, and many of the original members were either dead or in prison after a botched robbery in Northfield, Minnesota. After the train robbery, Frank James decided to retire from crime, settling in Lynchburg, Virginia.\n\nBy the spring of 1882, with his gang depleted by arrests, deaths and defections, James thought that he could only trust the Ford brothers.\n\nCharles had been out on raids with James before, but Bob was an eager new recruit.\n\nThe Fords resided in St. Joseph with the James family, where Jesse went by the alias of Thomas Howard. The Ford brothers passed themselves off as Bob and Charles Johnson, Howard’s cousins.\n\nBetrayal\n\nHoping to keep the gang alive, James invited the Fords to take part in the robbery of the Platte City Bank, but the brothers had already decided not to take part, looking instead to collect the $10,000 bounty placed on the James brothers by Governor Thomas T. Crittenden.\n\nIn January 1882, Robert Ford and Dick Liddil surrendered to Sheriff James Timberlake at their sister Martha Bolton’s residence in Ray County. They were brought into a meeting with Crittenden for being in the presence of the James’s cousin, Wood Hite, the day Hite was murdered.\n\nCrittenden allegedly promised Ford a full pardon, if he would also kill Jesse James – who was by then the most wanted criminal in the USA.\n\nKilling Jesse James\n\nOn April 3, 1882, after eating breakfast, the Fords and James went into the living room in preparation for the trip to Platte City.\n\nWhile reading the daily newspaper, James had just learned of gang member Dick Liddil’s confession for participating in Hite’s murder – and grew increasingly suspicious of the Fords for never reporting this matter to him.\n\nAccording to Robert Ford, it became clear to him that James had realized they were there to betray him.\n\nHowever, instead of confronting the Fords, James walked across the living room to lay his revolvers on a sofa. He then turned around and noticed a dusty picture above the mantle, and stood on a chair in order to clean it. Robert Ford then drew his weapon, and shot the unarmed Jesse James in the back of the head.\n\nJames’ wife Zerelda Mimms ran into the room and screamed, “You’ve killed him.”\n\nRobert Ford’s immediate response was “I swear to God I didn’t.”\n\nAfter The Assassination\n\nAfter the assassination, the Fords wired Crittenden to claim their reward. They surrendered themselves to legal authorities, but were dismayed to find that they were charged with first degree murder.\n\nIn one day, the Ford brothers were indicted, pleaded guilty, and were sentenced to death by hanging. But two hours later, Crittenden granted them a full pardon.\n\nDespite the deal that was made with Crittenden, the Ford brothers received only $500 – a fraction of the money they were originally promised.\n\nFord’s Later Years\n\nFor a time, Bob Ford earned money by posing for photographs as “the man who killed Jesse James” in dime museums. He also appeared on stage with his brother Charles, reenacting the murder in a touring stage show – but his performance was not well received. The way he had killed James – while his back was turned and he was unarmed – earned Ford much enmity from the residents of the various towns where they performed.\n\nCharles, terminally ill with tuberculosis and addicted to morphine, committed suicide on May 4, 1884.\n\nSoon afterward, Bob Ford and Dick Liddil relocated to Las Vegas, New Mexico, where they opened a saloon. By early 1885, Bob Ford had become a Las Vegas city policeman.\n\nAccording to legend, Ford had a shooting contest with Jose Chavez y Chavez, a comrade-in-arms of Billy the Kid during the Lincoln County War. Ford lost the contest and left town.\n\nOn December 26, 1889, Ford survived an assassination attempt in Kansas City, Kansas, when an assailant tried to slit his throat.\n\nWithin a few years, Robert Ford had settled in Colorado, where he opened a saloon-gambling house in Walsenberg. When silver was found in Creede, Ford closed his saloon and opened one there.\n\nOn the eve of Easter 1892, Ford and gunman Joe Palmer, a member of the Soapy Smith gang, were drinking in the local saloons and proceeded to shoot out windows and street lamps along Creede’s Main Street. With the help of friends and business partners of Smith, they were soon allowed to return.\n\nFord purchased a plot of land in the city, and on May 29, 1892, opened Ford’s Exchange, said to have been a dance hall. Six days later, the entire business district, including Ford’s Exchange, burned to the ground in a major fire. Ford opened a tent saloon, until he could rebuild.\n\nThe Death of Robert Ford\n\nThree days after the fire, on June 8, 1892, Edward Capehart O’Kelley entered Ford’s tent saloon with a shotgun.\n\nAccording to witnesses, Ford’s back was turned.\n\nO’Kelley said, “Hello, Bob.” As Ford turned to see who it was, O’Kelley fired both barrels, killing Ford instantly.\n\nO’Kelley thus became “the man who killed the man who killed Jesse James.”\n\nO’Kelley’s sentence was commuted because of a medical condition, and he was released on October 3, 1902.\n\nHe was subsequently killed on January 13, 1904 while trying to shoot a policeman.\n\nRobert Ford was buried in Creede, but was later exhumed and reburied in Richmond in his native Ray County at Richmond Cemetery.\n\nWhat goes around comes around.\n\nI hope you’ll be around, for our next installment.\n\nTill then.\n\nPeace.\n\nJesse Woodson James (September 5, 1847 – April 3, 1882) was an American outlaw, gang leader, bank robber, train robber, and murderer from the state of Missouri, and the most famous member of the James-Younger Gang.\n\nDespite popular depictions of James as a kind of Robin Hood, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, there is no evidence that he and his gang used their robbery gains for anyone but themselves.\n\nA celebrity even when he was alive, Jesse James became a legendary figure of the Wild West, after his death.\n\nBrad Pitt gave a remarkably nuanced portrayal of the outlaw in “The Assassination of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford” – the 2007 film that earned critical acclaim and an Oscar nomination, despite its clunky title.\n\nVideo is courtesy of YouTube:\n\nThat’s how Hollywood saw it.\n\nHere’s what history has to tell us:\n\nJesse’s Early Life\n\nJesse Woodson James was born in Clay County, Missouri, near the site of present day Kearney, on September 5, 1847. He had two full siblings: his older brother, Alexander Franklin “Frank”, and a younger sister, Susan Lavenia James.\n\nHis father, Robert S. James, was a commercial hemp farmer and Baptist minister in Kentucky, who migrated to Bradford, Missouri, after marriage to Zerelda Mimms, and helped found William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri. He was prosperous, acquiring six slaves and more than 100 acres (0.40 km2) of farmland.\n\nRobert James traveled to California during the Gold Rush to minister to those searching for gold, and died there when Jesse was three years old.\n\nAfter Robert James’ death, his widow Zerelda remarried twice, first to Benjamin Simms and then in 1855 to Dr. Reuben Samuel, who moved into the James home.\n\nJesse’s mother and Reuben Samuel had four children together: Sarah Louisa, John Thomas, Fannie Quantrell, and Archie Peyton Samuel. Zerelda and Reuben Samuel acquired a total of seven slaves, who served mainly as farmhands in tobacco cultivation in Missouri.\n\nPrelude to War\n\nThe approach of the American Civil War overshadowed the James-Samuel household.\n\nMissouri was a border state, sharing characteristics of both North and South, but 75% of the population was from the South or other border states.\n\nClay County was in a region of Missouri later dubbed “Little Dixie,” as it was a center of migration from the Upper South. The county counted more slaveholders, who held more slaves, than other regions of the state. In Missouri as a whole, slaves accounted for only 10 percent of the population, but in Clay County they constituted 25 percent.\n\nAfter the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, Clay County became the scene of great turmoil, as the question of whether slavery would be expanded into the neighboring Kansas Territory came to dominate public life. Numerous people from Missouri migrated to Kansas to try to influence its future.\n\nAmerican Civil War\n\nAfter a series of campaigns and battles between conventional armies in 1861, guerrilla warfare gripped the state, waged between secessionist “bushwhackers” and Union forces which largely consisted of local militia organizations (“jayhawkers”).\n\nThere was an escalating cycle of atrocities, on both sides. Guerrillas murdered civilian Unionists, executed prisoners and scalped the dead. Union forces enforced martial law with raids on homes, arrests of civilians, summary executions, and banishment of Confederate sympathizers from the state.\n\nThe James-Samuel family took the Confederate side, at the outset of the war.\n\nFrank James joined a local company recruited for the secessionist Drew Lobbs Army, and fought at the Battle of Wilson’s Creek – though he fell ill and returned home soon afterward.\n\nIn 1863, Frank was identified as a member of a guerrilla squad that operated in Clay County. In May of that year, a Union militia company raided the James-Samuel farm, looking for Frank’s group. They tortured Reuben Samuel by briefly hanging him from a tree. According to legend, they lashed young Jesse.\n\nQuantrill’s Raiders\n\nFrank eluded capture and was believed to have joined the guerrilla organization led by William C. Quantrill. It is thought that he took part in the notorious massacre of some 200 men and boys in Lawrence, Kansas, a center of abolitionists.\n\nFrank James followed Quantrill to Texas over the winter of 1863–1864. In the spring, he returned in a squad commanded by Fletch Taylor. After they arrived in Clay County, 16-year-old Jesse James joined his brother in Taylor’s group.\n\nIn the summer of 1864, Taylor was severely wounded, losing his right arm to a shotgun blast. The James brothers joined the bushwhacker group led by Bloody Bill Anderson.\n\nThe Clay County provost marshal reported that both Frank and Jesse James took part in the Centralia Massacre in September, in which guerrillas killed or wounded some 22 unarmed Union troops; the guerrillas scalped and dismembered some of the dead.\n\nThe guerrillas ambushed and defeated a pursuing regiment of Major A.V.E. Johnson’s Union troops, killing all who tried to surrender (more than 100). Frank later identified Jesse as a member of the band who fatally shot Major Johnson.\n\nAs a result of the James brothers’ activities, the Union military authorities made their family leave Clay County. Though ordered to move South beyond Union lines, they moved across the nearby state border into Nebraska.\n\nAfter Anderson was killed in an ambush in October, the James brothers separated. Frank followed Quantrill into Kentucky; Jesse went to Texas under the command of Archie Clement, one of Anderson’s lieutenants.\n\nHe is known to have returned to Missouri in the spring. Jesse was shot while trying to surrender, when he ran into a Union cavalry patrol near Lexington, Missouri, suffering a life-threatening chest wound.\n\nAfter the Civil War\n\nAt the end of the Civil War, the Republican Reconstruction administration passed a new state constitution that freed Missouri’s slaves. It temporarily excluded former Confederates from voting, serving on juries, becoming corporate officers, or preaching from church pulpits.\n\nThe atmosphere was volatile, with widespread clashes between individuals, and between armed gangs of veterans from both sides of the war.\n\nJesse recovered from his chest wound at his uncle’s boardinghouse in Harlem, Missouri, where he was tended to by his first cousin, Zerelda “Zee” Mimms (named after Jesse’s mother).\n\nJesse and his cousin began a nine-year courtship, culminating in marriage.\n\nMeanwhile, Jesse’s old commander Archie Clement kept his bushwhacker gang together, and began to harass the Republican authorities.\n\nThese men were the likely culprits in the first daylight armed bank robbery in the United States during peacetime – the robbery of the Clay County Savings Association in the town of Liberty, Missouri, on February 13, 1866. This bank was owned by Republican former militia officers who had recently conducted the first Republican Party rally in Clay County’s history. One innocent bystander – a student of William Jewell College (which James’s father had helped to found) – was shot dead on the street during the gang’s escape.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Jesse and Frank took part in this caper.\n\nAfter their later robberies took place and they became legends, there were those who credited them with being the leaders of the Clay County robbery. It has been argued, however, that Jesse was at the time still bedridden with his wound. No concrete evidence has surfaced to connect either brother to the crime, or to rule them out.\n\nArchie Clement continued his career of crime and harassment of the Republican government, to the extent of occupying the town of Lexington, Missouri, on election day in 1866. Shortly afterward, the state militia shot Clement dead – an event James wrote about with bitterness, a decade later.\n\nThe survivors of Clement’s gang continued to conduct bank robberies over the next two years.\n\nIn 1868, Frank and Jesse James allegedly joined Cole Younger in robbing a bank at Russellville, Kentucky.\n\nFame and Notoriety\n\nJesse James did not become famous until December 7, 1869, when he and (most likely) Frank robbed the Daviess County Savings Association in Gallatin, Missouri. The robbery netted little money, but it appears that Jesse shot and killed the cashier, Captain John Sheets, mistakenly believing him to be Samuel P. Cox, the militia officer who had killed “Bloody Bill” Anderson during the Civil War.\n\nJames’s self-proclaimed attempt at revenge, and the daring escape he and Frank made through the middle of a posse shortly afterward, put his name in the newspapers for the first time.\n\nThe 1869 robbery marked the emergence of Jesse James as the most famous of the former guerrillas and the first time he was publicly labeled an “outlaw.” Missouri Governor Thomas T. Crittenden set a reward for his capture.\n\nThis was the beginning of an alliance between James and John Newman Edwards, editor and founder of the Kansas City Times. Edwards (a former Confederate cavalryman) was campaigning to return former secessionists to power in Missouri.\n\nSix months after the Gallatin robbery, Edwards published the first of many letters from Jesse James to the public, asserting his innocence. Over time, the letters gradually became more political in tone, denouncing the Republicans and voicing James’ pride in his Confederate loyalties.\n\nThe letters turned Jesse James into a symbol of Confederate defiance of Reconstruction.\n\nThe James-Younger Gang\n\nThe James brothers joined with Cole Younger and his brothers John, Jim and Bob, as well as Clell Miller and other former Confederates to form what came to be known as the James-Younger Gang.\n\nWith Jesse James as the public face of the gang (though with operational leadership likely shared among the group), the gang carried out a string of robberies from Iowa to Texas, and from Kansas to West Virginia. They robbed banks, stagecoaches and a fair in Kansas City, often in front of large crowds – even hamming it up, for the bystanders.\n\nOn July 21, 1873, they turned to train robbery, derailing the Rock Island train in Adair, Iowa and stealing approximately $3,000 (about $55,000 in today’s money). For this, they wore Ku Klux Klan masks, deliberately taking on a potent symbol years after the Klan had been suppressed in the South by President Grant’s use of the Force Acts.\n\nThe gang’s later train robberies had a lighter touch. In only two train hold-ups did they rob passengers, because James typically limited himself to the express safe in the baggage car. Such techniques reinforced the Robin Hood image that Edwards created in his newspapers, but the James gang never shared any of the robbery money outside their circle.\n\nThe Pinkertons\n\nThe Adams Express Company turned to the Pinkerton National Detective Agency in 1874 to stop the James-Younger gang. The Chicago-based agency worked primarily against urban professional criminals, as well as providing industrial security, such as strike breaking.\n\nJoseph Whicher, an agent dispatched to infiltrate Zerelda Samuel’s farm was found killed, shortly afterwards.\n\nTwo others (Captain Louis J. Lull and John Boyle) were sent after the Youngers. Lull was killed by two of the Youngers in a roadside gunfight on March 17, 1874. Before he died, Lull fatally shot John Younger. A deputy sheriff named Edwin Daniels also died in the skirmish.\n\nAllan Pinkerton, the agency’s founder and leader, took on the case as a personal vendetta. He began to work with former Unionists who lived near the James family farm.\n\nOn the night of January 25, 1875, Pinkerton staged a raid on the homestead.\n\nDetectives threw an incendiary device into the house; it exploded, killing James’s young half-brother Archie (named for Archie Clement) and blowing off one of the arms of the James family’s matriarch Zerelda Samuel. Afterward, Pinkerton denied that the raid’s intent was arson, but biographer Ted Yeatman located a letter by Pinkerton in the Library of Congress in which Pinkerton declared his intention to “burn the house down.”\n\nThe raid on the family home outraged many, and did more than all of Edwards’s columns to create sympathy for Jesse James.\n\nThe Missouri state legislature only narrowly defeated a bill that praised the James and Younger brothers and offered them amnesty. Allowed to vote and hold office again, former Confederates voted to limit reward offers that the governor could make for fugitives. This extended a measure of protection over the James-Younger gang.\n\nThe James-Younger Gang’s Downfall\n\nOn September 7, 1876, the James-Younger gang attempted a raid on the First National Bank of Northfield, Minnesota.\n\nThe gang’s attempt began at about 2 p.m., but the robbery was bungled because several gang members had been drinking that morning – something Jesse James would never have permitted, had he been present in Northfield. This was the primary reason why Jesse James was never indicted for the Northfield crimes.\n\nNorthfield residents had seen the gang members leave a local restaurant near the mill shortly after noon, and they testified in Faribault at the Younger brothers’ trial that they smelled of alcohol, and that gang members were obviously under the influence.\n\nTo carry out the robbery, the gang divided into two groups. Three men entered the bank, two guarded the door outside, and three remained near a bridge across an adjacent square.\n\nThe robbers inside the bank were thwarted, when acting cashier Joseph Lee Heywood refused to open the safe, falsely claiming that it was secured by a time lock – even as they held a bowie knife to his throat, and cracked his skull with a pistol butt. Assistant cashier Alonzo Enos Bunker was wounded in the shoulder as he fled out the back door of the bank.\n\nMeanwhile, the citizens of Northfield grew suspicious of the men guarding the door, and raised the alarm.\n\nThe five bandits outside fired in the air to clear the streets, which drove the townspeople to take cover and fire back from protected positions. Two bandits were shot dead, and the rest were wounded in the barrage.\n\nInside, the outlaws turned to flee. As they left, one shot the unarmed cashier Heywood in the head. Historians have speculated about the identity of the shooter, but have not reached consensus on his identity.\n\nThe gang barely escaped Northfield, leaving two dead companions behind. They killed two innocent victims, Heywood, and Nicholas Gustafson, a Swedish immigrant from the Millersburg community west of Northfield.\n\nA massive manhunt ensued.\n\nThe James brothers eventually split from the others, and escaped to Missouri.\n\nThe militia soon discovered the Youngers and one other bandit, Charlie Pitts. In a gunfight, Pitts died, and the Youngers were taken prisoner.\n\nExcept for Frank and Jesse James, the James-Younger Gang was destroyed.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nLater in 1876, Jesse and Frank James surfaced in the Nashville, Tennessee, area, where they went by the names of Thomas Howard and B. J. Woodson, respectively.\n\nFrank seemed to settle down, but Jesse remained restless. He recruited a new gang in 1879 and returned to crime, holding up a train at Glendale, Missouri (now part of Independence, Missouri), on October 8, 1879.\n\nThis robbery was the first of a spree of crimes, including the holdup of the federal paymaster of a canal project in Killen, Alabama, and two more train robberies.\n\nBut the new gang did not consist of battle-hardened guerrillas; they soon turned against each other or were captured, while James grew paranoid to the point where he scared away one of his gang, and is believed to have killed another.\n\nWith the authorities growing suspicious, the brothers returned to Missouri where they felt safer.\n\nIn December 1881, Jesse rented a house at 1318 Lafayette Street, in Saint Joseph, Missouri – not far from where he had been born and raised. Frank, however, decided to move to safer territory, heading east to Virginia.\n\nThe Assassination of Jesse James\n\nWith his gang nearly annihilated, James trusted only the Ford brothers, Charley and Robert. Although Charley had been out on raids with James, Bob was an eager new recruit.\n\nFor protection, James asked the Ford brothers to move in with him and his family.\n\nJames had often stayed with their sister Martha Bolton and (according to rumor) he was “smitten” with her.\n\nJames did not know that Bob Ford had conducted secret negotiations with Thomas T. Crittenden, the Missouri governor, to bring in the famous outlaw.\n\nBarred by law from offering a sufficiently large reward, Crittenden had turned to the railroad and express corporations to put up a $5,000 bounty for Jesse or Frank.\n\nOn April 3, 1882, after eating breakfast, the Fords and James prepared to depart for another robbery. They went in and out of the house to ready the horses.\n\nAs it was an unusually hot day, James took off his coat, then removed his firearms, lest he look suspicious.\n\nNoticing a dusty picture on the wall, he stood on a chair to clean it. Bob Ford shot James in the back of the head.\n\nJames’ two previous bullet wounds and partially missing middle finger served to positively identify his body.\n\nA Legend, Even in Death\n\nThe murder of Jesse James became a national sensation.\n\nThe Fords made no attempt to hide their role. Indeed, Robert Ford wired the governor to claim his reward.\n\nCrowds pressed into the little house in St. Joseph to see the dead bandit, even while the Ford brothers surrendered to the authorities – but they were dismayed to find that they were charged with first degree murder. In the course of a single day, the Ford brothers were indicted, pleaded guilty, were sentenced to death by hanging, and two hours later were granted a full pardon by Governor Crittenden.\n\nThe governor’s quick pardon suggested that he knew the brothers intended to kill James, rather than capture him. The implication that the chief executive of Missouri conspired to kill a private citizen startled the public, and added to James’ notoriety.\n\nAfter receiving a small portion of the reward, the Fords fled Missouri.\n\nRumors of Jesse James’s survival proliferated almost as soon as the newspapers announced his death. Some said that Robert Ford killed someone other than James, in an elaborate plot to allow him to escape justice. These tales have received little credence, then or later.\n\nJames’ mother Zerelda Samuel wrote the following epitaph for him: In Loving Memory of my Beloved Son, Murdered by a Traitor and Coward Whose Name is not Worthy to Appear Here.\n\nJames’s widow Zerelda Mimms James died alone and in poverty.\n\nJesse and his cousin Zee had two children who survived to adulthood: Jesse Edward James (b. 1875) and Mary Susan James (later Barr) (b. 1879). Twins Gould and Montgomery James (b. 1878) died in infancy.\n\nJesse, Jr., became a lawyer who practiced in Kansas City, Missouri, and Los Angeles, California.\n\nThat’s your story, for now.\n\nNext time, we’ll look at “the dirty little coward who shot Mr. Howard”, as the famous old folk song puts it.\n\nTill then.\n\nPeace."
