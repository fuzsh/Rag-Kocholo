        "text": "Robert S. Ford began serving a recess appointment as the U.S. Ambassador to Syria in January 2011; his appointment was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in October 2011. He is the first American ambassador posted to Damascus since 2005, when the U.S. withdrew its diplomatic presence amid tensions over the Iraq war, human rights complaints, and the February 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Ford’s arrival in 2011 signaled a significant effort by the U.S. to reopen diplomatic dialogue with Syria. In Ford, the U.S. had dispatched to Damascus one of the most skillful and accomplished Arabists in the Foreign Service.\n\nRobert Ford has worked throughout the Middle East during his nearly thirty-year career in the United States Foreign Service. He began his career as a Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco from 1980 to 1982. Since 1985, he has served in various diplomatic capacities in Turkey, Egypt, Cameroon, Iraq, Bahrain, and Algeria. He was Deputy Chief of Mission to Bahrain from 2001 until 2004, Political Counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad from 2004 until 2006, and Ambassador to Algeria from 2006 until 2008. He served a second tour as a Political Counselor in Baghdad from 2008 until 2009. Ford has received numerous awards from the Department of State and the Department of Defense, including the 2005 James Clement Dunn Award for Excellence.\n\nIn January 2011, a few short weeks after Ford arrived in Syria, a wave of prodemocracy protests swept through the Middle East. Now commonly called the “Arab Spring,” these demonstrations eventually brought down oppressive regimes in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. In Syria, similar public protests have challenged the brutal regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad has sought to maintain control by deploying Syrian army ground forces and snipers to squelch the opposition movement with violence, even in residential, civilian neighborhoods. The United Nations has estimated that over 10,000 people had been killed in the Syrian uprisings between January 2011 and March 2012.\n\nOn the ground in Syria, Ford’s robust diplomacy centered on a strong show of support for the Syrian opposition movement. At personal risk, he has traveled all over the country, talking with the Syrian people and using social media to encourage dissidents to embrace forms of non-violent protest against government-backed brutality. In this way, as The Jerusalem Post observed, “he has carved out a niche for himself in the region, defying stereotypes about what diplomats can and should do.”\n\nFord’s courageous support for the opposition garnered global attention in July 2011, when he visited the city of Hama in advance of planned demonstrations there. Hama had become a focal point of the uprising against the government, and the Syrian Army had begun to ring the city in preparation for a major assault. Ford’s physical presence in Hama, without official sanction from the Syrian government, functioned as a visible statement of support for the demonstrators and an unambiguous rebuke of the government-backed violence against them.\n\nIn an August 2011 interview with ABC News, Ford acknowledged that his presence in Hama had displeased Assad’s regime. But he spoke resolutely against the government’s violent crackdown: “I don’t particularly care [if Syria is angry], because we have to show our solidarity with peaceful protestors. I’d do it again tomorrow if I had to…I’m going to keep moving around the country. I can’t stop.” This and other explicit displays of solidarity with the Syrian people stretched the usual bounds of formal diplomacy and put his own safety at risk.\n\nAfter his visit to Hama, the Associated Press reported that Ford’s residence was vandalized, his convoy was attacked in Damascus, and he was pelted with rotten eggs and tomatoes when he went to meet with dissidents or to visit mosques. In September 2011, as he arrived at a Damascus office building for a meeting with an opposition leader, Ford was assaulted by a pro-Assad mob and trapped inside the building for more than an hour. Embassy vehicles were vandalized as the mob tried to storm the building. Despite these and other attacks, and despite knowledge that Syrian intelligence agents were following him, Ford continued to support the opposition by attending protestor funerals, speaking with Syrians on the ground and through social media, and educating Americans via satellite images and descriptions of the conflict on the embassy’s official Facebook page.\n\nFord’s heroic, “muscular” diplomacy, as The Jerusalem Post wrote, represented “a departure from the long-standing practice of US State Department functionaries...toeing the line when it comes to dictators and human rights abuses.” The New York Times also praised Ford, saying, “his actions are giving hope to Syrians, and clearly frightening the regime.”\n\nIn October 2011, the U.S. government recalled Robert Ford from Damascus, citing credible threats to his safety. Despite continued violence, Ford returned to Syria in early December, but as the violence worsened, the U.S. recalled all but a few embassy staff. On February 6, 2012, the United States closed the American embassy and removed Ambassador Ford from the country. Robert Ford continues to serve his post from Washington, D.C.\n\nThe 2012 Profile in Courage Award is presented to Ambassador Robert Ford for the courageous example he has set and the light he has shone on the power of creative and robust diplomacy to serve as a vital tool for advancing human rights.\n\nIowa Justices Who Legalized Same-Sex Marriage Honored with 2012 John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award\n\n– Ambassador to Syria Recognized for Courageous Diplomacy –\n\nBoston MA – Three former Iowa Supreme Court Justices who were removed from office by Iowa voters after joining a unanimous decision to legalize same-sex marriage in that state were presented the prestigious John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award™ today by Caroline Kennedy at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. Former Iowa Chief JusticeMarsha Ternusand former justicesDavid BakerandMichael Streitwere chosen in recognition of the political courage and judicial independence each demonstrated in setting aside popular opinion to uphold the basic freedoms and security guaranteed to all citizens under the Iowa constitution.\n\nAlso honored with a Profile in Courage Award at today’s ceremony wasRobert Ford, U.S. Ambassador to Syria, whose bold and courageous diplomacy has provided crucial support to Syrians struggling under the brutal regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.\n\n“Courage is a rare and critical quality in our democracy,” said Caroline Kennedy, President of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. “Our honorees, Justices Baker, Streit, and Ternus, and Ambassador Ford, have put their lives and careers on the line to protect the fundamental civil rights of Americans who wish to marry the person they love, and to help bring the freedoms we enjoy to oppressed Syrians fighting for a better future. They are an example and an inspiration to us all.”\n\nThe John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award™ is presented annually to public servants who have made courageous decisions of conscience without regard for the personal or professional consequences. The award is named for President Kennedy’s 1957 Pulitzer Prize-winning book, Profiles in Courage, which recounts the stories of eight U.S. senators who risked their careers, incurring the wrath of constituents or powerful interest groups, by taking principled stands for unpopular positions. The John F. Kennedy Library Foundation created the Profile in Courage Award™ in 1989 to honor President Kennedy’s commitment and contribution to public service. It is presented in May in celebration of President Kennedy’s May 29th birthday. The Profile in Courage Award is represented by a sterling-silver lantern symbolizing a beacon of hope. The lantern was designed by Edwin Schlossberg and crafted by Tiffany & Co.\n\nDavid Baker, Michael Streit and Marsha Ternus, Former Iowa Supreme Court Justices\n\nOn April 3, 2009, Iowa Supreme Court Justices Marsha Ternus, David Baker and Michael Streit joined a unanimous opinion which struck down Iowa’s ban on same-sex marriage. The Varnum v. Brien decision was the first unanimous high court opinion on marriage for same-sex couples, and it made Iowa the third state in the U.S. and the first state outside of New England to allow same-sex marriage. When the justices cast their votes to legalize same-sex marriage, they were aware that national groups opposed to marriage equality were preparing to launch an unprecedented retaliatory campaign to oust them, but the Court stressed in its opinion that its responsibility was “to protect constitutional rights of individuals from legislative enactments that have denied those rights, even when the rights have not yet been broadly accepted, were at one time unimagined, or challenge a deeply ingrained practice or law viewed to be impervious to the passage of time.”\n\nAlthough the Court’s decision was unanimous, Ternus, Baker and Streit were the only three Iowa Supreme Court justices up for retention in 2010. A provision of Iowa’s court system established 50 years ago to protect the bench from unscrupulous or corrupt judges, retention votes were explicitly non-political. Despite the votes’ intended use, in the fall of that year, the three justices faced a million-dollar opposition campaign managed by the National Organization for Marriage. They did not campaign on their own behalf, believing it was inappropriate for members of the court to solicit votes in a political context and only spoke publicly about the vote shortly before Election Day. All three were defeated, marking the first time since Iowa’s modern judicial system was established that any high court judge was ousted in a retention vote. The National Organization for Marriage has planned to launch similar campaigns in 2012 and 2016 against the remaining four justices who decided Varnum v. Brien.\n\nThe 2012 Profile in Courage Award is presented to Marsha Ternus, David Baker and Michael Streit for their demonstrated political courage and judicial independence in upholding, in the face of popular opposition, the basic freedoms and security guaranteed to all citizens under the Iowa constitution.\n\nRobert Ford, United States Ambassador to Syria\n\nRobert S. Ford began serving a recess appointment as the U.S. Ambassador to Syria in January\n\n2011. A few short weeks after his arrival, a wave of prodemocracy protests swept through the Middle East and public protests in Syria launched an uprising against the brutal regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. A former Peace Corps volunteer and then career member of the U.S. Foreign Service, Ford’s robust diplomacy on the ground in Syria centered on a strong show of support for the Syrian opposition movement. At personal risk, he traveled all over the country, talking with the Syrian people and using social media to encourage dissidents to embrace forms of non-violent protest against government-backed brutality.\n\nFord’s courageous support for the opposition garnered global attention in July 2011, when he visited the city of Hama in advance of planned demonstrations there.

Kennedy Library Foundation’s prestigious award for political courage were selected by a distinguished bipartisan committee of national, political, and community leaders. Albert R. Hunt, executive Washington editor of Bloomberg News, chairs the 13-member Profile in Courage Award Committee. Committee members are U.S. Congresswoman Donna F. Edwards (D-Maryland); Kenneth R. Feinberg, Chairman of the board of directors of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation; U.S. Senator Lindsey O. Graham (R-South Carolina); Antonia Hernandez, president and chief executive officer of the California Community Foundation; Elaine Jones, former director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund; Caroline Kennedy, president of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation; Paul G. Kirk, Jr., former U.S. Senator (D-Massachusetts) and Chairman Emeritus of the board of directors of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation; Martha Minow, Dean and Jeremiah Smith, Jr. Professor of Law at Harvard Law School; Shari Redstone, President, National Amusements, Inc; John Seigenthaler, founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University; David M. Shribman, executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; and U.S. Senator Olympia Snowe (R-Maine). Tom McNaught, executive director of the Kennedy Library Foundation, staffs the Committee.\n\nThe John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum is a presidential library administered by the National Archives and Records Administration and supported, in part, by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, a non-profit organization. The Kennedy Presidential Library and the Kennedy Library Foundation seek to promote, through educational and community programs, a greater appreciation and understanding of American politics, history, and culture, the process of governing and the importance of public service.

Thank you very much.\n\nI would first like to mention that Ms. Jay Breen, my aunt and wonderful friend for almost five decades, is here with me today. Jay, my mother Marian, my father Jack and my two brothers, Bill and Brian, have all been supportive and understanding while I have spent most of the past thirty years working in Africa and the Middle East. Most of all, I owe special thanks to my wife, Alison, who is a diplomat herself and could not be with us because she is now on a work assignment in Kenya.\n\nI will admit to being quite surprised when I learned about receiving this award. I had a phone message saying that Caroline Kennedy had called and there was a phone number with a Massachusetts area code. I thought to myself, “Uh oh – I bet she’s going to ask me how to get a visa to Syria. And I’m going to have to convince her that visiting Syria now would be a really bad idea.”\n\nThese are indeed difficult days in Syria. I remember the picture of the Chinese student facing down an army tank in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Now, 23 years later, we are seeing that kind of courage, that kind of commitment in cities and towns across Syria on a daily basis. In this, the second year of the Arab Spring, Syrians are demanding freedom and demanding dignity more than ever.\n\nI want to emphasize that word ‘dignity’ because it is the essence of the aspirations of young Syrians today -- dignity. They no longer accept that security officers can kill and torture with impunity. They no longer accept that officials get bribes for even routine administrative actions or that the sons and cousins of the top leaders are always above the law. Instead, I found that in 2011 and 2012, Syrians demand respect, and they demand the boot of a vicious security state be removed from their necks.\n\nWhen I visited the protesters in Hama last July, without a suit and tie, the people there at first refused to believe that I was the American ambassador. They kept saying, “No, really? You?” I think they expected someone younger and with more hair – sort of like Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp. Once convinced that I was the American ambassador, dozens of people appeared, almost out of nowhere. They were grateful that a foreigner had come to hear their stories of abuse and their complaints of ill treatment. The people I met there, and elsewhere in Syria, wanted to be heard and they were happy that I could bear witness.\n\nThe Syrian government was furious that I had visited and accused me of smuggling weapons to the protesters. In fact, at that time, the Hama protests were peaceful and the reason we chose to visit Hama was that the tens of thousands of street protesters had stayed peaceful despite the constant threat of the Syrian army invading their city to try to crush the protest movement.\n\nAbout a week after my visit, a video appeared on YouTube. It showed an old, white, washing machine, the kind my grandmother had, with a round cylinder agitator that slowly churned around making a “Ker-chunk, ker-chunk” sound. Plopped on top of the old washing machine was a satellite TV dish that turned with the agitator, “Ker-chunk, ker-chunk.”\n\nOn the washing machine was a hand-written sign that said, in Arabic, “Gift of the American Ambassador to Hama.”\n\nA voice came on the video, in Arabic, and asked, “Ahmed, what is this?”\n\nAnd Ahmed replied, “This is the secret gift from the American ambassador to the people of Hama.”\n\nThe first voice asked, “But, what is it?”\n\nAnd Ahmed replied, “It is the latest American technology. Ker-chunk, ker-chunk. It cost one quarter of the American budget. It can locate and destroy jet aircraft. Ker-chunk. It can locate and destroy enemy tanks. Ker-chunk. And at the end of the battle, it can wash your clothes.”\n\nI didn’t take advanced weapons to Hama. I went to demonstrate our strong support for the respect of all Syrians’ freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. These are enshrined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights – a document the Syrian government signed in 1948.\n\nLast May, President Obama emphasized to all those in government who were working on the transitions in North Africa and the Middle East to help people there achieve freedom, dignity, and respect for their human rights. At the National Democratic Institute last November, Secretary Clinton reaffirmed our commitment to support the efforts of people in Syria, and the other nations in the region, to secure respect for their fundamental human rights.\n\nAnd thus, I deeply appreciate the recognition by the committee today, but in fact I was following the lead of the President and the Secretary, as do my fellow Foreign Service diplomats. A good many of my colleagues would have done the same things that I did in Syria had they been sitting at the desk of the American ambassador in Damascus. Foreign Service officers and specialists work every day around the world to promote the respect of freedom of speech, of freedom of assembly, of freedom of association. We are joined at the State Department by a professional cadre of political appointees, Civil Servants, locally employed staff, and contractors -- all dedicated to securing America's interests, including advancing a set of universal rights. I was especially lucky to work with a great team – a very dedicated, hardworking, and brave team – at the U.S. Embassy in Damascus. All of us on that team were working to support the Syrian people's right to get that boot off their necks.\n\nIn part, I understand the meaning of the Profile in Courage Award is that each person can make a difference, that those who receive it have in some manner restored belief in politics as a noble profession and a calling to public service. I look back at the body of work President Kennedy left behind, and that is enshrined around us today. And then I think of all the courageous Syrians who just want a chance... a chance to participate in an open, free political system. President Kennedy paid the ultimate price for his service to this nation. Many Syrians have also paid the ultimate price of service to their fellow countrymen. It is my fervent wish that the violence in Syria will end as soon as possible, that the Asad regime will depart, and that a new Syrian nation will emerge and take its place in the international community. For our part, we will re-double our efforts, working with a wide and diverse international coalition, to help the Syrians reach that goal.\n\nOn behalf of my team at the American Embassy in Damascus, and on behalf of those of us in the Foreign Service, and all those who choose public service as such a noble endeavor, thank you very much for this great honor.\n\nRemarks delivered by Robert Ford on accepting the 2012 John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, May 7, 2012. (As Prepared for Delivery)\n\nThis is a special day for my family and for the Kennedy Library and I want to thank all of you for coming to share it with us – especially half the population of the State of Iowa! It’s wonderful to have you all here to support our honorees and honor the memory of President Kennedy.\n\nAll my life people have told me that President Kennedy changed their lives – they decided to join the Peace Corps, run for office , volunteer in the inner city or in outer space, because he asked them to serve our country and do what they could to make this a more just and peaceful world.\n\nThe generation he inspired changed this country- they fought for civil rights, women’s rights, human rights and nuclear disarmament. They passed that inspiration down to their children and grandchildren. As the first truly modern President, he redefined America’s timeless values for a global audience and recognized the power of each individual to make a difference.\n\nAs we mark the 50th anniversary of his Presidency, my father’s time is becoming part of history – rather than living memory - yet President Kennedy’s words, his example and his spirit remain as vital as ever. At a time when young people are disillusioned with politics, we need to reach across the generations and recommit ourselves and our country to these ideals.\n\nOne way that we connect past and present is through the Profile in Courage Award. By honoring individuals who act on principle without regard for the personal consequences – we honor the quality that my father most admired in public life.\n\nThis is a special year for the Profiles in Courage Award because we are fortunate to recognize 4 outstanding Americans who demonstrate how critically important it is that men and women of courage serve in all branches of government.\n\nThe people we honor today each said they were surprised to learn that they had been chosen. They don’t think they did anything special, they were just doing their job. But for public officials, just doing their job often demands a special kind of courage. Standing up for human rights requires courage. Serving the interest of all citizens, not just the majority, requires courage.\n\nAs President Kennedy’s Ambassador to India, John Kenneth Galbraith, once observed, “It is far, far safer to be wrong with the majority than to be right alone.” We owe a great debt to the four people we honor today, for their courage and for the sacrifices they and their families have made to secure a more just future for all Americans.\n\n[LANTERN PRESENTATION TO FORMER IOWA SUPREME COURT JUSTICES]\n\nIn 2009, in the landmark decision VARNUM v. BRIEN, the Iowa Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision holding that a statute limiting civil marriage to a union between a man and a woman violated the equal protection clause of the Iowa State Constitution. Iowa Chief Justice Marsha Ternus, and Justices David Baker and Michael Streit voted with their colleagues to make Iowa the third, and the first Midwestern state to allow gay marriage. The eloquent opinion states in part,\n\n“Civil marriage must be judged under our constitutional standards of equal protection and not under religious doctrines or the religious views of individuals. This approach does not disrespect or denigrate the religious views of many Iowans who may strongly believe in marriage as a dual-gender union, but considers, as we must, only the constitutional rights of all people, as expressed by the promise of equal protection for all. We are not permitted to do less and would damage our constitution immeasurably by trying to do more...\n\nIn the final analysis, we give respect to the views of all Iowans on the issue of same-sex marriage—religious or otherwise—by giving respect to our constitutional principles. These principles require that the state recognize both opposite-sex and same-sex civil marriage.”\n\nThe decision of the Iowa Supreme Court sparked a political backlash. Nationally financed opponents of same-sex marriage ran an expensive and divisive political campaign intended to intimidate judges or legislators who opposed their views both in Iowa and beyond.\n\nUnder Iowa’s system, highly-qualified judges are appointed by the governor and then subject to a retention vote every eight years. The retention vote system is intended to provide a way to remove jurists who are unfit to serve, and the campaigns leading up to them have been characterized by the prevailing view that it is inappropriate for sitting judges to engage in political electioneering.\n\nYet in November 2010, despite their long and distinguished service to the state of Iowa, Marsha Ternus, David Baker and Michael Streit were ousted. They were the only three Supreme Court justices to stand for retention that year, and they are the only three judges in Iowa history to have lost a routine retention vote.\n\nThe justices were aware that they might pay a price even before they handed down their opinion. But they did not waver. In their decision, they wrote, “A statute inconsistent with the Iowa Constitution must be declared void, even though it may be supported by strong and deep-seated traditional beliefs and popular opinion.”\n\nIn 1963, as civil rights demonstrations throughout the South met with increasingly violent opposition, President Kennedy addressed the nation on television and said, “We are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the Scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution. The heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities, whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated.”\n\nJust as judges stood firm for civil rights fifty years ago, Marsha Ternus, David Baker and Michael Streit, their colleagues on the Iowa Supreme Court, and dozens of other public servants all across the country – legislators, governors, mayors, city councilors and judges – have put their own careers on the line to uphold the rule of law and extend the fundamental promise of equal rights to same-sex couples.\n\nThis award is usually given to elected officials in the legislative branch of government. But in honoring these three principled jurists, we seek to remind all Americans of the importance of an independent judiciary and its role in safeguarding our most fundamental rights.\n\nWe are fortunate to have with us today three other Iowa Supreme Court justices who voted with our honorees. Justices David Wiggins and Daryl Hecht are here, along with current Chief Justice Mark Cady, who wrote the opinion in Varnum v. Brien. I would like to ask them to stand and be recognized.\n\nAnd now I would like David Baker, former Iowa Supreme Court Justice, to come forward and accept the 2012 Profile in Courage Award.\n\n[Lantern presentation to David Baker]\n\nIt is now my pleasure to present the 2012 to former Iowa Supreme Court Justice Michael Streit.\n\n[Lantern presentation to Michael Streit]\n\nI am now honored to ask Marsha Ternus, the former Chief Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court, to accept the 2012 Profile in Courage Award.\n\n[Lantern presentation to Marsha Ternus]\n\n[LANTERN PRESENTATION TO AMBASSADOR ROBERT FORD]\n\nThe public officials who made civil marriage possible for same-sex couples in Iowa are not the only ones who will tell you they were just doing their jobs. Ambassador Robert Ford will say the same thing.\n\nRobert Ford answered President Kennedy’s call to service more than 30 years ago as a Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco, and he has been serving our country – and the world - ever since. As a career member of the United States Foreign Service and a fluent Arabic speaker, he has served in critical diplomatic positions in Turkey, Egypt, Cameroon, Iraq, Bahrain, and Algeria.\n\nEighteen months ago, in a bid to encourage political reform in Syria, the United States dispatched Ambassador Ford to the Syrian Arab Republic to reestablish a diplomatic dialogue that had been corroded by years of political tension.\n\nAmbassador Ford arrived in Damascus just when the glimmer of self-governance was sparking revolution all across the Middle East. As oppressive governments tried to extinguish the flames of democracy with violence, the people of the Arab world laid down their lives for the promise of a brighter future. Robert Ford might have watched all this unfold from the embassy.\n\nPresident Kennedy’s observation, “Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable,” is a prescient description of the Syrian situation. Yet Robert Ford advanced the American ideals of freedom and democracy against a brutal and oppressive dictatorship willing to use deadly force against its own citizens engaged in peaceful demonstrations.\n\nAs he became a pointed critic of the Syrian government, and in the process, Ford himself became a target of violence.\n\nIn the words of Thomas Jefferson, “All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent.” In Syria, Robert Ford did not remain silent. He walked through the streets all over Syria listening to those who yearned for the freedom to pursue their dreams. He used modern tools of communication to give voice to Syrians seeking a more just and peaceful society. He put his own safety at risk every time he met with a dissident or attended the funeral of a protestor. In all these ways, he redefined the role of American diplomacy and stood up for America ideals. But he will tell you he was just doing his job like so many other courageous diplomats, including his wife who is serving in Kenya and can’t be with us today.\n\nThis past February, the United States government closed its embassy and recalled Robert Ford to Washington, unable to ensure his safety. As the Middle East glows with the promise and the perils of freedom, Robert Ford’s public service is a tribute to my father’s belief that “one man of courage makes a majority”. He has shown the impact one person can have on the lives of millions and the obligation that each of us has to make a difference in this world.\n\nMy father would have been especially pleased to see a former Peace Corps Volunteer being honored in his name. I now ask Ambassador Robert Ford to come forward and accept the 2012 Profile in Courage Award.\n\n[Lantern presentation to Ambassador Ford]"
