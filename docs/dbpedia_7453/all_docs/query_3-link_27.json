        "text": "Robert Ford Jr., who as a journalist in the late 1970s was an early chronicler of the newly emerging hip-hop scene, and who then became a producer and mentor to a generation of influential figures, including Kurtis Blow and Russell Simmons, died on May 19 in Brooklyn. He was 70.\n\nHis wife, Linda Medley, who confirmed the death, said Mr. Ford had dealt with several chronic illnesses in recent years.\n\nHip-hop in its pre-commercial days was brought to life by a relatively small network of D.J.s, M.C.s and party promoters. It largely developed in parks, rec rooms and hotel ballrooms, far from the eye of the press.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Ford, who was known as Rocky, was writing about black music for the trade magazine Billboard when he received a tip from a co-worker about a curious trend in vinyl sales. He traveled to the Bronx to meet with Kool Herc, the D.J. now regarded as one of hip-hop’s fathers, to learn more.\n\nMr. Ford’s article, titled “B-Beats Bombarding Bronx: Mobile DJ Starts Something With Oldie R&B Disks,” ran in the July 1, 1978, issue of Billboard and is considered to be the first coverage of hip-hop’s germinal era in a mainstream publication.\n\n“Herc rose to popularity by playing long sets of assorted rhythm breaks strung together,” Mr. Ford wrote. “Since Herc was not completely satisfied with the new disco product coming out at the time, he started looking in cutout bins for tunes with good rhythm breaks.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
