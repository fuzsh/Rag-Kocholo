        "text": "Obituary Mom must have needed you more. The family of William Robert Ford “Pops” is deeply saddened to announce his unexpected, but peaceful passing at the age of 71, on July 31, 2019. William was predeceased by his wife Kathy (2013) who died way too young. William is survived by his children Susan Ford of Brigden, Rob (Zita) Ford of London and his boys Zack, Jaden and Josh Ford. William will be deeply missed by his siblings Betty (the late Jack) Morrish of Smithville, Jim (Pat) Ford of Dutton, Ed (Grace) Ford of Wallacetown, Audrey (Bill) Lyons of St. Thomas, Don (Karen) Ford of Wallacetown and David Ford of Wallacetown. William will also be deeply missed by many extended family members. William was predeceased by his brother John Ford (1969). William was born on August 15, 1947 in Wallacetown, Ontario. He was the son of the late James and Florence Ford. William was a retired CN employee. He enjoyed ripping things apart and putting them back together. William loved his family and friends. The family would like to extend their heartfelt appreciation to all the healthcare professionals involved in his care. To Scott Lunn and Jennifer Goodhue, we appreciate everything that you did for our “Pops”. Cremation has already taken place. Arrangements entrusted to the Shawn Jackson Funeral Home, 31 Elgin Street, St. Thomas (519-631-0570). A celebration of life will be held at the CASO Railway Station, 750 Talbot Street, St Thomas on Tuesday, August 6, 2019 from 2:00 - 4:00 p.m. & 7:00 - 9:00 p.m. A private family interment of ashes will be held at a later date in Elmdale Memorial Park Cemetery. If desired, donations to Heart & Stroke Foundation, Canadian Cancer Society or a charity of one’s choice would be appreciated. Personal condolences to the family can be made at www.sjfh.ca “Rest in peace Pops, you will be missed” To send flowers to William's family, please visit our floral section."
