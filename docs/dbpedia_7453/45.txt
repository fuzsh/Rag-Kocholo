Robert Arthur Douglas Ford, CC (January 8, 1915 - April 12, 1998) was a Canadian diplomat, who served as ambassador to the U.S.S.R. (Russia). He was also a Governor General's Award-winning Canadian poet.

Life[]

Ford was born in Ottawa, Ontario, the son of Mary Lavinia (Scott) and former London Free Press Editor-in Chief and University of Western Ontario Chancellor Arthur Rutherford Ford. He earned a B.A. in history and English in 1937 from the University of Western Ontario, and a M.A. in history in 1939 from Cornell University. He taught history at Cornell from 1938 to 1940.[1]

Ford joined the Department of External Affairs in 1940 and by 1946 was 2nd secretary at the Canadian Embassy to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) in Moscow, where he would serve much of his career.[2] He served as ambassador to Colombia, 1957-1959; Yugoslavia, 1959-1961; the United Arab Republic, 1961-1963; and the U.S.S.R. for 16 years, 1964-1980.[3]

On retiring, he served on the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues, and as a special adviser to the Canadian government on east-west issues.[3]

He was a fluent Russian speaker, who translated Russian poetry into English.

He died at Vichy, France.[4]

Writing[]

The Canadian Encyclopedia calls Ford's poetry "distinguished by a clinical despair and a precision of language and form."[2]

The Dictionary of Literary Biography remarks that Ford's "long absences from Canada have caused him to remain outside contemporary trends and movements in Canadian poetry, so that his poetry is more international in flavor than much written by Canadian poets, particularly as he has shown a wide-ranging interest in the poetry of the countries in which he has worked in Canadian embassies."[1]

Recognition[]

Ford's debut poetry collection, Window on the North (1956), won the 1956 Governor General's Award for English language poetry or drama.[2]

In 1971, Ford was awarded the Gold Medal of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, and made a Companion of the Order of Canada.[3]
