You'll have to dodge more than just raindrops.\n\nThe Five Boro Bike Tour will be making its way through New York City. The 40-mile route starts in lower Manhattan, going up Sixth Avenue into Central Park and through Harlem before crossing over into the Bronx briefly. It then comes back onto FDR Drive, crosses the Queensboro Bridge and into Long Island City.\n\nNext is a trip across the Pulaski Bridge into Greenpoint before going onto the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and the Gowanus Parkway. From there, the tour hits the Verrazzano Bridge and into Staten Island. The finish is at Fort Wadsworth.\n\n24/7 New York news stream: Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are\n\nIt all kicks off at the intersection of Franklin Street and Church Street at 7:30 a.m., though participants in Wave 1 should probably be there before that time.
