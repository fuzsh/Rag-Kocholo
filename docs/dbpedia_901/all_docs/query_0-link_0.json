        "text": "Skanska, as lead of a joint venture between Skanska USA Civil Southeast Inc. and Facchina Construction Company, Inc., was awarded a $260M design-build contract to reconstruct the 11th Street bridges and adjacent interchanges.\n\nInbound and outbound regional movements will be provided by two separate bridges, each with four lanes in one direction. Inbound and outbound local movements will be provided by a single bridge with four lanes, two in each direction.\n\nThe local bridge will provide a shared use path for pedestrian and bicycle traffic and will also accommodate a streetcar. The existing bridges will be removed, except for portions of the piers, which will be retained for use as osprey nesting platforms adjacent to the regional bridges and pedestrian viewing platforms along the local bridge.\n\nOn the east side of the river, the team will reconstruct the interchange to complete all regional and local connections between the Anacostia Freeway (I-295/DC 295) and the new river bridges, providing desired interstate route continuity. The new interchange has a lower overall height and is located further away from the adjacent neighborhood, thereby reducing impacts on the local community.\n\nOn the west side of the river, the team will construct a new three-lane connection to the Southeast Freeway (I-695). The team will also provide intersection enhancements along 11th Street.\n\nThe planning and execution of this project will be supported by Building Information Modeling (BIM). When completed, the project will connect the communities along the 11th Street Corridor to each other and the Anacostia River and complete the functional and operational requirements of the 11th St. Corridor interchange.\n\nOf additional relevance to the project is the fact that HNTB is providing design-build management as the customer representative, and consequently working closely with the Skanska team. The Skanska team is currently on target to exceed its 6% DBE goal on this project. The project is scheduled to be completed in July, 2013."
