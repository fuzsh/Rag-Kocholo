        "text": "KNOXVILLE â€” A University of Tennessee student jumped from the 11th Street pedestrian bridge onto Cumberland Avenue on Tuesday morning, police said.\n\nThe body was identified as Andrew Vermillion, a 22-year-old UT junior who authorities believe was 'suffering from depression due to several ongoing personal issues,' according to a Knoxville Police Department news release.\n\nDispatchers said at 6:24 a.m. the E-911 Center received a call of a threatened suicide. The caller said his roommate had been up all the night before threatening to kill himself.\n\nAt 6:30 a.m., a driver reported a man had jumped from the pedestrian bridge onto the westbound lanes of Cumberland Avenue. Officers with the University of Tennessee Police Department were first on the scene, emergency dispatchers said. The UT Police Department is near the pedestrian bridge.\n\nThis is the first time someone has jumped from the 11th Street bridge, according to UT spokeswoman Karen Simsen. At a height of 41 feet with a 4-foot rail, the bridge is the highest footbridge on campus, Simsen said.\n\n'We are always discussing how to improve safety and security on our campus,' she said.\n\nMore details as they develop online and in Wednesday's News Sentinel."
