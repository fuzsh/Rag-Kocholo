The extremely high incarceration rate of this neighborhood could mean that a prison, juvenile detention facility or other correctional facility occupies a large proportion of the neighborhood, or contains a large portion of the neighborhood's population.\n\nIn addition, neighborhoodScout's exclusive research revealed that 96.6% of the adult residents in the 11th Street Bridge neighborhood do not have a 4-year college degree, which is a lower rate of college graduated adults than found in 98.2% of the neighborhoods in America.\n\nAlso, of note, 62.4% of the children in this area live in poverty; an extraordinarily high percentage compared to other neighborhoods in the nation.

This is a higher proportion of walking commuters than we found in 95.9% of American neighborhoods. Get ready to put on your walking shoes if you move here!\n\nCar Ownership\n\nWe Americans love our cars. Not only are they a necessity for most Americans due to the shape of our neighborhoods and the distances between where we live, work, shop, and go to school, but we also fancy them. As a result, most households in America have one, two, or three cars. But NeighborhoodScout's exclusive analysis shows that the 11th Street Bridge neighborhood has a highly unusual pattern of car ownership. 28.9% of the households in this neighborhood don't own a car at all. This is more carless households than NeighborhoodScout found in 97.0% of U.S. neighborhoods.\n\nMigration / Stability\n\nDo you like to be surrounded by people from all over the country or world, with different perspectives and life experiences? Or do you instead prefer to be in a neighborhood where most residents have lived there for a long time, creating a sense of cohesiveness? NeighborhoodScout's analysis reveals that this neighborhood stands out among American neighborhoods for the uniqueness of the mobility of its residents. In the 11th Street Bridge neighborhood, a greater proportion of the residents living here today did not live here five years ago than is found in 96.7% of U.S. Neighborhoods. This neighborhood, more than almost any other in America, has new residents from other areas.\n\nDiversity\n\nDid you know that the 11th Street Bridge neighborhood has more African ancestry people living in it than nearly any neighborhood in America? It's true! In fact, 7.5% of this neighborhood's residents have African ancestry.\n\nThe Neighbors\n\nHow wealthy a neighborhood is, from very wealthy, to middle income, to low income is very formative with regard to the personality and character of a neighborhood. Equally important is the rate of people, particularly children, who live below the federal poverty line. In some wealthy gated communities, the areas immediately surrounding can have high rates of childhood poverty, which indicates other social issues. NeighborhoodScout's analysis reveals both aspects of income and poverty for this neighborhood.\n\nThe neighbors in the 11th Street Bridge neighborhood in Wilmington are low income, making it among the lowest income neighborhoods in America.

It is also different if most of the neighbors are clerical support or managers. What is wonderful is the sheer diversity of neighborhoods, allowing you to find the type that fits your lifestyle and aspirations.\n\nIn the 11th Street Bridge neighborhood, 30.8% of the working population is employed in clerical, assistant, and tech support occupations. The second most important occupational group in this neighborhood is sales and service jobs, from major sales accounts, to working in fast food restaurants, with 30.8% of the residents employed.

Some people also speak Spanish (3.3%).\n\nEthnicity / Ancestry\n\nCulture is shared learned behavior. We learn it from our parents, their parents, our houses of worship, and much of our culture – our learned behavior – comes from our ancestors. That is why ancestry and ethnicity can be so interesting and important to understand: places with concentrations of people of one or more ancestries often express those shared learned behaviors and this gives each neighborhood its own culture. Even different neighborhoods in the same city can have drastically different cultures.\n\nIn the 11th Street Bridge neighborhood in Wilmington, DE, residents most commonly identify their ethnicity or ancestry as Sub-Saharan African (9.8%). There are also a number of people of African ancestry (7.5%), and residents who report Puerto Rican roots (3.2%), and some of the residents are also of Jamaican ancestry (2.3%), along with some Mexican ancestry residents (1.4%), among others."
