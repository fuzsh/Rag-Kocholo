        "text": "Construction Update\n\nOn July 15, 2024, the Des Moines City Council approved construction of a new fire station to replace the station currently located at the intersection of 9th and University Avenue. The new Fire Station #4 will be located at 1505 Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway (north of Clark Street, between 19th and MLK Jr. Parkway).\n\nThe new station has been planned and designed to improve emergency response times in the northwest quadrant of the City (see Project Purpose and Goals below). Additionally, it will meet the evolving needs of the Fire Department and will include four drive-thru apparatus bays, living quarters, a training room, stair training tower, and underground stormwater detention. The station will be submitted for LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification.\n\nThe City Council has contracted with Ryan Companies to serve as the projectâ€™s construction manager. Site work is anticipated to begin in the last week of July 2024 and the project is scheduled to be completed by December 2025."
