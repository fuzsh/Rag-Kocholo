        "text": "by Nena Perry-Brown\n\n✉️ Want to forward this article? Click here.\n\nAs the 11th Street Bridge Park project continues to gear up for groundbreaking, more images are emerging from the design process.\n\nThe park would retrofit the obsolete former 11th Street Bridge (map), spanning the Anacostia River, into the city's first elevated park. The resulting amenity would create various activity nodes along a seesaw-shaped structure the length of three football fields.\n\nFeatures will include an environmental education center, a play area, café, boat launch, community farm, hammock grove, waterfalls, and an amphitheater. The structure will also include multiple pedestrian and bicyclist access points.\n\nThe project team, led by Building Bridges Across the River, is scheduled to complete the National Environmental Policy Act assessment process this summer. The National Capital Planning Commission remotely approved the preliminary plans for the elevated park earlier this month. The park could deliver as early as 2023.\n\nAdditional renderings are below.\n\nAll renderings courtesy of OMA and Luxigon.\n\nloading..."
