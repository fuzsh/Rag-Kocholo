        "text": "The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) has announced that construction on the Sherman Street (Route 1033) bridge spanning Interstate 83 and Mill Creek in York County is scheduled to begin soon. Work on the nearby Eberts Lane bridge continues.\n\nWeather permitting, the bridge will be closed June 11 so an additional span can be constructed on the existing 3-lane, 2-span bridge. The bridge is being lengthened for the relocation of Mill Creek as part of the I-83 North York Widening initiative.\n\nA detour will be in place for Sherman Street. Southbound traffic should take Route 30 east to North Hills Road south to Route 462 west to Sherman Street. Northbound traffic should take Route 462 east to North Hills Road north to Route 30 west to Sherman Street.\n\nThe Sherman Street bridge is expected to reopen in June of 2025.\n\nThis project also includes the replacement of the nearby county-owned bridge carrying Eberts Lane over Mill Creek. Work on this part of the project is ongoing and is expected to be completed in August of this year. In the meantime, a detour is in place for the bridge.\n\nSouthbound traffic should take 11th Street west to Sherman Street north to Route 30 east to North Hills Road south to Route 462 west to Eberts Lane. Northbound traffic should take Frederic Avenue west to Sherman Street south to Route 462 east to North Hills Road north to Route 30 west to Sherman Street south to 11th Avenue east to Eberts Lane.\n\nThis project also consists of approach work, guide rail updates, pavement marking updates, and other miscellaneous construction, a press release said. Deblin, Inc, of Mechanicsburg, is the contractor on this $10,117,734 project.\n\nMotorists can check conditions on major roadways by visiting www.511PA.com. 511PA, which is free and available 24 hours a day, provides traffic delay warnings, weather forecasts, traffic speed information and access to more than 1,000 traffic cameras. 511PA is also available through a smartphone application for iPhone and Android devices, by calling 5-1-1, or by following local alerts on X.\n\nSubscribe to PennDOT news and traffic alerts in Adams, Cumberland, Dauphin, Franklin, Lancaster, Lebanon, Perry and York counties at PennDOT District 8."
