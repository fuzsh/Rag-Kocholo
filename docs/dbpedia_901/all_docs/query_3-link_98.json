        "text": "One of the main freeway connections spanning the Anacostia River in Washington, DC is incomplete. Together, the two one-way bridges known as the 11th Street Bridges connect the Anacostia Freeway and the Southeast Freeway, linking regional traffic through the eastern sections of the District to the Federal core.\n\nDue to their original design, Southbound motorists on the Anacostia Freeway cannot access the bridges; nor can motorists on the bridges go north onto the Freeway. The ramps to make these connections do not exist. This results in increased commuter traffic on neighborhood streets.\n\nThe District Department of Transportation undertook the 11th Street Bridges Environmental Impact Study as a result of the Middle Anacostia River Crossings Transportation Study, which identified the need to improve connectivity across the Anacostia River for both northbound and southbound regional and local traffic.\n\nJustice and Sustainability Associates were selected to work on a team led by CH2M HILL a highly respected and global leader in full service engineering, construction and operations. JSAâ€™s charge was to design and facilitate a complex and fast-moving EIS process that would attract and engage the culturally and geographically divergent populations on either side of the Anacostia River and further build consensus through education at the community organization level.\n\nThe result was a successfully designed and facilitated process that built consensus through the use a variety of tools, including a project website, a newsletter, a project mailing list, informal meetings and workshops, public meetings, and agency coordination through the monthly Anacostia Waterfront Initiative meetings."
