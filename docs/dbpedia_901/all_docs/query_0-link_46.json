This innovative program provides a solid platform for growth and sustainability.\n\nThe Mobile Small Business Kiosk (MSBK) is designed to provide resources, tools, and support for small businesses looking to test their brand and allow consumers to learn about their business in multiple locations during their month-long tenure in the Mobile Kiosk. This program also provides one-on-one kiosk operations assistance, capacity building, and marketing support pro bono in collaboration with Accenture. For other TA needs, selected businesses can access the Anacostia BID’s Business Communications Access Portal (BCAP). In addition, participating companies can visit the BCAP resource library and the online helpdesk and network and share knowledge with other participants. Participating businesses could include art, retail, bath/body, clothing, produce, pre-packaged food, etc.\n\nWho is Eligible?\n\nEligible applicants include existing small businesses that meet the following criteria. In addition, core business aligns with the following:\n\nBusiness or primary residence is located East of the River in Ward 7 or Ward 8 in Washington, DC\n\nValid business license\n\nClean Hands Certification\n\nLess than $200,000 in annual revenue\n\nCommercial General Liability Insurance (“CGL”) – Proof of Coverage shall have limits of liability of not less than $500,000 for each occurrence, a $250,000 general aggregate (including a per location or per project aggregate limit endorsement, if applicable) limit, a $500,000 personal and advertising injury limit\n\nThis opportunity is not for third-party partners of the small business selected to participate.
