Find out what it’s like when audiences AND actors experience a play together for the first time.\n\nIt works like this: Auditions are held in secret. The play is cast in secret. Cast members rehearse the show individually and secretly. Actors are not told the identity of the other cast members. On the night of the performance, the actors arrive at the theater as though they are members of the audience. They take their seats, read their programs, chat with their neighbors, and when the house lights dim, and the play begins, each actor delivers their first line from their seat.\n\nIf that sounds like your cup of tea, check out the performance Monday night.\n\n7 p.m. Monday, Aug. 12, U.S. Bank Main Stage, The Armory, 128 N.W. 11th Ave.; tickets are pay-what-you-will beginning at $40; pcs.org/events/anonymous-romeo-and-juliet.\n\n- If you have events you’d like to see highlighted at OregonLive.com or in the weekly printed A&E section of The Oregonian, please email submissions to events@oregonian.com at least three weeks prior to the start of your event.
