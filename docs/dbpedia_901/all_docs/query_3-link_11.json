        "text": "When the cost to replace two spans with three bridges was deemed unaffordable, program manager HNTB presented the Department of the District of Columbia with new plan to replace and widen the 11th Street Bridges above the water line and build a third bridge for local traffic.\n\nHNTB began with a day-long success management workshop, which generated agreement among 40 stakeholders on five program goals. To foster innovation and flexibility, the firm recommended a design-build-to-budget procurement, resulting in the winning bidder offering 80 percent of the traffic movement identified in the record of decision for 60 percent of the cost. The innovative procurement cut the schedule by five years.\n\nDespite 17 items that threatened to inflate costs and delay the project, HNTB successfully reduced the overall budget by $500,000 without diminishing quality."
