After a seven-month design competition, the design team of OMA+OLIN was selected in October 2014. With the ongoing capital campaign securing more than $15 million to date, Bridge Park draws on extensive community outreach and consultative process, anchored by more than 700 stakeholder meetings for design development and impact. The park is expected to open by 2019.\n\nView Top Employees from 11th Street Bridge Park"
