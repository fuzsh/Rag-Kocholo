        "text": "by UrbanTurf Staff\n\n✉️ Want to forward this article? Click here.\n\nThe final designs for DC's 11th Street Bridge Park have been released as the team behind the city's first elevated park looks to finally put shovels in the ground later this year.\n\nThe designs for the park, along with a new equitable development plan, will be presented at a town hall on Thursday night. The equitable development plan will include updated affordable housing, workforce training, arts & culture and environmental justice goals associated with the park.\n\nThe new park will reuse the structural pillars of the former 11th Street Bridge (map) spanning the Anacostia River. The seesaw-shaped structure will have multiple pedestrian and bicyclist access points, as well as an amphitheater, an environmental education center, a play area, a café, a boat launch, a community farm, and a hammock grove.\n\nNearly 15 years in the making, the project is on track to have all its permits in hand by next month with the idea that a search for a contractor can begin shortly thereafter. Scott Kratz of Building Bridges Across America told UrbanTurf that the contractor search is expected to take about four months, putting a target date for a groundbreaking around September. Once construction begins, it will take 24-30 months for the park to be completed.\n\nAll renderings courtesy of OMA and Luxigon.\n\nloading..."
