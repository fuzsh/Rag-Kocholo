        "text": "The Engineer continues to work on the re-design of the bridge. Currently, they are working on completing the design and constructability package for the bridge. The drawings for the subaqueous utilities are complete, which includes replacing the 8” force main and the 12” water main shelf that runs alongside the current bridge. The Designer has submitted applications to South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and is pending approval. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) will be sending out new notices to residences affected by the bridge waterway. This new notice is to inform residences that there has been a change from the original design. For your convenience, we have added an (exhibit) to clearly show the current design intent as it relates to the waterway clearances. The documents that have been mailed out have also been added to this web site for your use and information. Once the Construction Documents are complete, the Engineer/City staff will present the project in a public meeting for informational purposes. Upon permit approval and project funding, the City will move forward with bidding and awarding the project to the qualified bidder. It is anticipated, that the construction timeline for the bridge and the underground utilities will take approximately 1 year (subject to change). Please continue to monitor this web site for updates and project timelines.\n\nFrequently Asked Question (FAQ):\n\nQ: Why is the city replacing this bridge?\n\nA; Although the current bridge is structurally sound, the Florida Department of Transportation’s Bridge Management system has classified this bridge as “Functionally Obsolete”, which means it does not meet current design standards. As such, there are recommended safety improvements to address the horizontal geometry, apex of the bridge, pedestrian access and traffic site lines. The replacement bridge will improve these hazards, making it safer for pedestrians and vehicular traffic.\n\nQ: Where can I obtain accurate information on the specific scope pertaining to the replacement of the SE 6 Terrace bridge?\n\nA: All information project specific information can be found on the City’s web site and is updated monthly. Any information obtained outside of the web site and/or city resources may be inaccurate and should be verified by visiting the city’s website.\n\nQ: Why can’t this bridge just be removed completely?\n\nA: The SE 6th Terrace bridge is a critical infrastructure providing access for fire personnel, emergency rescue and police services. The removal of this bridge could significantly increase response times for these emergency services and compromise the health and safety of the public. In addition, traffic overload onto Cypress Rd. may occur. For instance, for those that reside south of the bridge, if they desired to travel north or east they would be forced to cut through the neighborhood streets to exit onto Cypress Rd.\n\nFinally, without having the bridge, community ingress/egress flexibility and redundancy for our residents would be compromised – if an incident occurred along Cypress (construction activity, road closure, accident, etc.) it may prevent residents from being able to leave the area in the event of an emergency or non-emergency.\n\nQ: Why can’t this bridge have the same waterway clearance as the neighboring SE 5th Ave. bridge?\n\nA: While it would be ideal to have the SE 6th Terrace bridge raised to the same height as the SE 5th Ave bridge, there are several factors that prevent the SE 6th Terrace bridge from being raised to the same elevation as the SE 5th Ave bridge. These factors include: (1) geometry of the bridge, (2) length of the bridge, (3) utility shelf, (4) geometric constraints and (5) grade level terrain (see exhibit). As you can see, the site characteristics are not the same, therefore the same design principles cannot be applied to both bridges. Thus, the end result is having two bridges that have differing height elevations based on site conditions.\n\nQ: Will the new bridge be higher than the existing bridge?\n\nA: Yes. The new bridge design will have an increase of approximately +/-27” from the current bridge at the highest point of the structure or 10.9’ mean high water table (MHWT).\n\nQ: Why are they raising the bridge only +/-27” (inches)?\n\nA: Due to the fixed constraints of current conditions, i.e., horizontal alignment, driveways and existing road elevation on the north and south side of the bridge location, the maximum height the bridge can safely be raised without increasing safety hazards is +/-27” (inches).\n\nQ: The determination letter provided by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) as posted on the City’s web site indicates the replacement bridge will have a 10.4’ (feet) vertical clearance above mean high water. What is the definition of mean high water table?\n\nA: The USCG defines the mean high water table as follows: “The average of all the high water heights observed over the National Tidal Datum Epoch. for stations with shorter series, comparison of simultaneous observations with a control tide station is made in order to derive the equivalent datum of the National Tidal Datum Epoch.” In summary, the mean high water table is the average high tide. The precise high tide is impacted by weather, tidal phase and SFWMD flood control structures upstream and varies accordingly.\n\nQ: Will my boat fit under the new bridge?\n\nA: Boats vary in size and height, please reference the “mean high water table” definition listed above to determine sufficient clearance height, with consideration given to tidal conditions.\n\nQ: Will the replacement bridge increase or decrease my property value?\n\nA: Typically, improvements to infrastructure in the affected area increase property value. More importantly, the replacement of SE 6th Terrace bridge will improve traffic flow, reduce existing safety hazards and enhance the appearance of the community.\n\nQ: Will I have access to my home and/or the affected area while the bridge is under construction?\n\nA: Access in and around the area will be limited, however there will be detour signs posted with alternate routes.\n\nQ: When is the anticipated construction start date?\n\nA: Please refer to the timeline section at the top of this page (subject to change)"
