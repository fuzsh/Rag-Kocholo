        "text": "OMA/Jason Long’s 11th Street Bridge Park is slated to begin construction in 2021 and will create a communal gathering place to unite Washington, D.C., a long-divided city. It will be the first public space in the nation’s capital that will make a bridge a destination—a park above the river—where access to green spaces can significantly encourage physical activity while building social capital.\n\nPlans produced by the project team of OMA, landscape architects OLIN, structural engineers WRA and other members of the 11th Street Bridge Park design team were reviewed and approved by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) at the beginning of April. The team also received positive feedback from the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts and is planning a presentation to the full Commission this Fall. Since winning the international design competition together with landscape architects OLIN in 2014, OMA has been working with the District Department of Transportation, non-profit Building Bridges Across the River as well as multiple agencies and stakeholders to develop and improve the bridge design.\n\nJason Long, OMA Partner, said—“At a time when we are paradoxically isolated from one another but united in a common cause, public spaces that we all share and that benefit health have become more important than ever. Our work has focused on creating a new civic space that engages with the Anacostia River and refining the program for the park to ensure it will be a place for everyone in DC.”\n\nYusef Ali Dennis, OMA Associate, said – “This project would not have been possible without the efforts of key stakeholders and the community. Their comments and feedback truly shaped the bridge, from its overall design to its specific programs and features. It’s only fitting that a project of this size and importance has required such broad cooperation and collaboration.”"
