The 11th Street Bridge Park, a project of Ward 8 based nonprofit Building Bridges Across the River at THEARC will be Washington, D.C.â€™s first elevated public park located on the piers of the old 11th Street Bridge spanning the Anacostia River: a new venue for healthy recreation; environmental education and the arts. After a seven-month design competition, the design team of OMA+OLIN was selected in October 2014. With the ongoing capital campaign securing more than $15 million to date, Bridge Park draws on extensive community outreach and consultative process, anchored by more than 700 stakeholder meetings for design development and impact. The park is expected to open by 2019.
