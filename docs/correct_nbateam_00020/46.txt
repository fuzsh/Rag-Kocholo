New York Knicks guard Chauncey Billups is receiving a community service award from the Basketball Hall of Fame on Thursday night, and he plans to attend Friday’s formal induction ceremony for the 2011 class. But Billups also would like to make one more visit to the Hall sometime in the future – for his own induction. “That would be a dream of mine, to be elected into the Hall of Fame one day,” Billups said.

In a pregame media availability on Friday, Cheryl Miller ripped the league’s record new broadcast rights package and the negotiators who put it together. Miller called for a number four-times higher than the reported $2.2 billion over 11 years that the WNBA reportedly will receive starting in 2025. The new deal could be as much as six-times higher than the current deal struck in 2016. “I’m not great with numbers,” Miller told reporters in Phoenix. “That’s a lowball.”

In the USC legend and longtime basketball voice’s view, the NBA and its broadcast partners undervalued the WNBA in negotiations. “We certainly have come a long way, and I’m not about gauging, but it’s a long time overdue,” Miller said. “Women’s basketball is in a great place right now.” The NBA negotiated the new deals on behalf of the WNBA, as they have with each package since the women’s league was created nearly three decades ago.
