        "text": "GREENBURGH, N.Y. — David Fizdale has brought in several former players to spend some time with the Knicks.\n\nThe latest guest had a decorated career.\n\nFormer Knick and United States senator from New Jersey Bill Bradley spoke to the team Tuesday, discussing everything from commitment to service to managing finances.\n\n\"I figured who better to teach our guys about being a Knick, about service, about community more than Bill Bradley,\" Fizdale said. \"It was a really awesome 20- ,25-minute talk to the team. I think the guys heard him. I know for all of us that work here it was a real treat and his message was great.\"\n\nBradley played for the Knicks from 1967-1977 and helped them to a pair of championships before beginning his political career.\n\nHe spent 18 years in the Senate and ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2000.\n\n\"It was great,\" rookie Kevin Knox said. \"His name's up in the rafters. Every time you come across one of those people, you gotta listen. My eyes were locked in the whole time on him, making sure I was just locking in everything he was telling me, and just taking it in. He's a great person, a senator, he worked in the military, a two-time champion, so he knows what he's talking about. I'm young, and I want to be where he is one day, so that's something I really look forward to.\"\n\nBradley has a relationship with Knicks president Steve Mills through Princeton University, which they both attended.\n\nFizdale has made it an emphasis to bring in former players to talk to his team. Patrick Ewing, Clyde Frazier and Chris Bosh have addressed the Knicks while Rasheed Wallace worked with the team this week in practice.\n\nFizdale has mentioned Chauncey Billups as someone else he wants to bring in.\n\n\"I got a huge list of guys that I’m going to tap into all year that obviously I’m going have come back during the year and just be a part of it with us,\" Fizdale said, \"but it don’t get better than that, Bill Bradley.\""
