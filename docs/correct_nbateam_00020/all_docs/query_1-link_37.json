        "text": "Mr. Big Shot is headed to Rip City.\n\nChauncey Billups on Sunday night was announced as the new head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, replacing Terry Stotts, who mutually parted ways with the club on June 4.\n\n“I’m very excited and humbled to be the next coach of the Trail Blazers,” Billups said in a news release. “Portland is a special place and a unique franchise. As a player I always loved playing here because the passion and knowledge of the fans brought out the very best in me as a competitor. Now I’m looking forward to being on the other side of that energy and engaging with the Portland community on a whole other level.”\n\nBillups, 44, spent the 2020-21 season as an assistant coach with the Clippers.\n\n“Chauncey is a proven leader with an elite basketball IQ that has won everywhere he has been,” Blazers president of basketball operations Neil Olshey said in a news release. “He is prepared for the challenge of developing the Championship habits and strategic approach we need to achieve the expectations and goals for our franchise.”\n\nBillups, a Denver native, starred at George Washington High School and the University of Colorado before he was drafted by the Boston Celtics with the third overall pick in the 1997 NBA draft. He played 17 seasons in the league and was named the NBA Finals MVP in 2004 after leading Detroit to a championship. He also played for the Raptors, Nuggets, Timberwolves, Knicks and Clippers."
