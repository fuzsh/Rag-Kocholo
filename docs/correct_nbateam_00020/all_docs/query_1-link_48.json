He has also received numerous honors away from his sport. In 1995, Coach Porter was named \"Man of the Year\" by the Regis student body and was inducted into the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame in 2001. Coach Porter is widely recognized in the Denver area for leadership in community service and had a vision of creating a leadership academy to further serve the youth of the community beyond the school year. Coach Porter's vision became a reality in 1996. In May 2015, Regis University President Rev. John Fitzgibbons, S.J., awarded an honorary doctorate to Coach Porter, citing his commitment of giving hope and opportunity for a college education to a new generation of young people. Coach Porter is sincere in his commitment to the community in which he lives. \"Serving the community is a humbling experience,\" said Coach Porter. \"It helps me to realize how blessed I've been in my life. There is a tremendous need for us to use our talents to better the lives of those who may not be as fortunate as we are.\" In 2022, he was inducted into the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference Hall of Fame.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nChauncey Billups\n\nCo-Executive Director\n\n​\n\nNBA All-Star and Denver native Chauncey Billups announced his involvement and support of the Leadership Academy on March 1, 2006.

In 2007, he hosted 10 youngsters excelling in the PBLA to a Pistons home game, as well as a trip to the Charles H. Wright African American Museum and Motown Museum.
