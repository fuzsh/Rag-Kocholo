        "text": "Can a team without superstars — a team like the Knicks — go deep into the NBA playoffs?\n\nIt’s tough, but not impossible, according to Portland coach Chauncey Billups before the Knicks’ 112-84 win Tuesday night at the Garden.\n\nBillups, you may recall, was the NBA Finals MVP on the championship Detroit Pistons team that defeated the Lakers, 4-1, in 2004. That Lakers team had four future Hall of Famers, including Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O’Neal, Gary Payton and Karl Malone. The Pistons? Their sole future Hall of Famer was Ben Wallace, who got there almost exclusively because of his defensive prowess.\n\n“The game is obviously very different now, but I’m a big believer in if you can get a top-flight defensive team and you got enough people on offense that can score and get it going and you have three-point shooting, you got a chance to be elite,” Billups said. “It’s really all about having the right culture to win in today’s game. You don’t win without that at the highest level.”\n\nBillups added that he thought that Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau was establishing that culture in New York.\n\n“I think Thibs is doing a really good job going and getting a guy like OG, who is about everything Thibs is about,” Billups said, referring to the trade that brought OG Anunoby to New York.\n\nThat Detroit team with Billups made their run after trading for Rasheed Wallace at the deadline, finishing the season with a 16-3 run. The Knicks are 5-0 with Anunoby in the lineup.\n\nThe Knicks (22-15) are in sole possession of fourth place in the East. The three teams ahead of the Knicks — the Celtics, the Bucks and the 76ers — have multiple stars."
