        "text": "Former NBA Finals MVP Chauncey Billups will headline the latest class of inductees to the University of Colorado Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nBillups is one of 11 former Buffs who will be inducted Nov. 5. It represents the second-largest class in the history of the Hall, which opened in 1998. Only the 2012 class, with 12 members, was bigger.\n\nIn all, the 2015 class represents nine different sports. Joining Billups in the class will be: Jon Burianek (administrator, 1968-2006), Bill Fanning (baseball, 1946-49), Stephan Hienzsch (skiing, 1975-78), Frank Prentup (baseball and assistant football coach, 1941-69), Mike Pritchard (football, 1987-90), Erin Scholz (women’s basketball, 1993-97), Mark Scrutton (cross country & track, 1979-83), Nicole Vranesh (volleyball, 1990-93), Scott Wedman (men’s basketball, 1971-74) and Tom Woodard (golf, 1973-77).\n\nBillups played just two years for the CU men’s basketball team from 1995-97, but had a major impact during that time, and is still one of the most beloved Buffs of all time.\n\nA high school star from Denver, Billups had a sensational two-year stint at CU. During his sophomore year, in 1996-97, he led CU to a 22-10 record and its first NCAA Tournament appearance in 28 years.\n\nAs a sophomore, Billups was a first-team All-American. He declared for the NBA draft after that season and was selected No. 3 overall (highest ever for a CU player) by the Boston Celtics.\n\nBillups played 17 seasons in the NBA and achieved his greatest success as a member of the Detroit Pistons. He led the Pistons to the 2004 NBA title, while being named the MVP of the Finals. Billups retired after the 2014 season.\n\nIn terms of fan popularity, Pritchard might be No. 2 on the list. He was named the MVP of CU’s 1990 national championship football team.\n\nPritchard caught 47 passes for 1,241 yards and 10 touchdowns in his CU career, and his average of 26.4 yards per catch is still the best in CU history for players with at least 30 catches.\n\nOne of just 13 players in CU history to compile at least 500 yards rushing and receiving, Pritchard was the 13th overall pick (by the Atlanta Falcons) in the 1991 NFL Draft. He played nine seasons in the NFL.\n\nWhile Billups and Pritchard are probably the most recognized names on the list, there are a couple of champions among the class, too.\n\nHienzsch is a key figure in the illustrious history of CU skiing. He was a part of four NCAA championship teams at CU and was the first CU skier to win a national title in giant slalom, in 1977. He also won the national title in the slalom that year.\n\nScrutton won two national titles as a runner. He was the 1982 NCAA cross country champion, and in 1983, he won the national title in the two-mile run. He also took home a record 17 Big Eight Conference individual titles and was a nine-time All-American.\n\nThe 2015 class will be inducted during a gala in the Boedecker Gym at Coors Events Center on Nov. 5. The class will also be featured in the Pearl Street Stampede parade on Nov. 6 and will be introduced at halftime of the CU vs. Stanford football game on Nov. 7.\n\nWith this year’s class, the CU Hall of Fame now honors 79 individuals and one team, the 1959 ski team, which won CU’s first-ever national title.\n\nSince its inception in 1998, the CU Hall of Fame has added a new class every other year, until now. In an effort to honor more of CU’s greats, an induction is now planned for every year."
