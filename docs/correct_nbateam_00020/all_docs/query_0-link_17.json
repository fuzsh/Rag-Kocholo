        "text": "Chauncey Billups days as the New York Knicks’ point guard are over, according to a report by the New York Times.\n\nAccording to The Times’ website — Billups, the Denver native, star at Colorado and former Nuggets guard — will be cut as part of a complicated deal that will bring Tyson Chandler to New York.\n\nA league source told The Denver Post this afternoon that there isn’t a possibility right now that Billups will sign with Denver, his hometown team and the team that traded him to New York last February.\n\nChandler is expected to sign with the Knicks this afternoon when the NBA officially reopens for business. To make room for Chandler under the salary cap, the Knicks will waive Billups and trade center Ronny Turiaf.\n\n“It will be finished today,” a source told The Times.\n\nBillups will be waived under the league’s new amnesty provision, which means he will be paid his full $14.2 million but his salary will be removed from the cap."
