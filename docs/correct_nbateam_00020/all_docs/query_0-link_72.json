        "text": "They are point guards who own championship rings and began their NBA careers with the Boston Celtics.\n\nRajon Rondo and Chauncey Billups have those things in common, but when it comes to their respective games, the similarities end.\n\nThe 25-year-old Rondo, now in his fifth season with the Celtics, uses speed and basketball knowledge to flourish in the role of a limited shooting, true point guard.\n\nThe 34-year-old Billups, the No. 3 pick in the draft by the Celtics when Rick Pitino was in charge in 1997, is a powerful point guard with an outside shooting touch and an ability to get to the foul line.\n\nThe two opposite players will be in the spotlight when Rondo and the Celtics take on Billups and the New York Knicks in the opening round of the playoffs beginning tonight at the TD Garden (7:05; TV: Comcast SportsNet and TNT; radio: WEEI-850 AM).\n\n“You’ve got two great floor leaders,’’ said forward Paul Pierce, who joined the Celtics the year after Billups was drafted and quickly traded by Pitino. “You’ve got two guys who have won championships. A lot of experience behind Chauncey, and Rondo’s got a lot of experience even at a young age.\n\n“You’ve got two of the best point guards just going at it. It should be an exciting matchup. Chauncey, come playoff time, he’s one of those players who can turn it up and really control a game and take a team over. The same with Rondo. He’s shown an ability to do that. It’ll be a great matchup.’’\n\nThe two players went head-to-head in the Eastern Conference finals in 2008 when the Celtics eliminated the Detroit Pistons.\n\nBillups was bothered by a hamstring ailment in that series, and Rondo was able to use his quickness as an advantage, helping the Celtics win in six games.\n\nThis season, the two went head-to-head twice, once when Billups was playing for the Denver Nuggets on Dec. 8 and again on March 21 after he had been traded to the Knicks.\n\nIn that game, Rondo had 13 points and 12 assists while Billups missed 9 of 15 shots but had 21 points, hitting four 3-pointers.\n\nAsked what the key is to stopping Billups, Rondo said, “I can’t really give you the secret of stopping Chauncey Billups. After the series is over, hopefully, my secret (will have worked). So we’ll see. I try to attack him, just like anybody else.’’\n\nRondo struggled in the final six weeks of the season as he production decreased and he wound up finishing second to Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns in assists, getting 11.2 per game.\n\nThere was speculation that the trade of friend Kendrick Perkins was a factor and that Rondo was slowed by a case of plantar fasciitis and a sore finger.\n\n“They’re fine,’’ said Rondo of the ailments. “Everything’s fine with me.’’\n\nThe Celtics are going to need Rondo to improve his game from the end of the regular season when he was not consistent and was overwhelmed in losses to Derrick Rose and the Chicago Bulls and the Miami Heat earlier this month.\n\n“It’s an interesting one,’’ said Celtics coach Doc Rivers of the Rondo-Billups pairing. “It’s complete opposites: cerebral veteran vs. the high IQ young player, speed vs. power. It’ll be an interesting matchup.\n\n“(Billups) brings championship experience. Like we have guys who have won titles on our team, Chauncey is that guy for them and he’s that guy at point guard. He’s just a clever player and he’ll be big for them.’’\n\nThe Celtics are quite familiar with Billups, even if no one was around when he played just 51 games in Boston as a rookie.\n\nAn impatient Pitino sent Billups, who was traded behind Tim Duncan and Keith Van Horn, to the Toronto Raptors to get a veteran point guard in Kenny Anderson.\n\nBillups has also been with the Nuggets twice, the Minnesota Timberwolves (teaming with Kevin Garnett), the Pistons and was on the roster of the Orlando Magic, coached by Rivers, for part of the 1999-2000 season after being dealt by Denver.\n\nBillups never played for the Magic due to a left shoulder injury and was moved to the Timberwolves after that season, but Rivers has fond memories of him.\n\n“I didn’t know if he could play because he never played, but I knew he was one of the greatest guys,’’ said Rivers. “He didn’t play one game, but he never missed a practice, never missed a film session, never missed a team meeting. He was always on the floor, always instructing.\n\n“I called him ‘coach’ because that’s basically what he was for us. A lot of guys wouldn’t do that, especially a guy who was traded in the middle of the year.’’"
