        "text": "Despite the 2024 NBA Draft lottery, the impending draft, the upcoming trade and free agent season, and a hundred other items on the National Basketball Association calendar, no topic is capturing the attention of Portland Trail Blazers fans as persistently as Portland’s coaching situation. Head Coach Chauncey Billups remains a focus, often a lightning rod for public ire. The tour through the Blazer’s Edge Mailbag inbox keeps revealing questions like this one.\n\nCome on, Dave. Stop defending Chauncey. You know he should be fired. They should have already done it. We don’t need an apologist. Are you doing PR for the team now? Just say it. Let him go and get a new coach who can actually coach. And by the way, if they did, who do you want?\n\nBarry\n\nHa! I don’t think I’m a Coach Billups apologist. I’ve even mentioned a few times that it’s probably time to consider parting ways. But as I’ve considered this more, I can empathize with the team’s decision to retain him, and not just because of financial reasons. (The next year of his contract is guaranteed and they’d pay two coaches if they fired him.)\n\nI don’t know a soul in the universe that things the Blazers are going to win next season. That puts the team in a tough position regarding their coach.\n\nOn the one hand, there’s no compelling argument for Billups to remain at the helm. He’s already coached three losing seasons. A fourth will cement him, and his voice, in that role. It’s not ideal to keep playing the same tune when nobody’s dancing.\n\nOn the other hand, a new voice isn’t going to change that story immediately. Assuming the rookies from this year’s draft are going to be mid and the Blazers don’t execute spectacular, franchise-altering trades, the 2024-25 season is going to look a lot like 2023-24. That’s a tough situation to bring a new coach into.\n\nFirst of all, what kind of coach could you attract? You’re certainly not going to get a high-profile candidate or hot name. The team would be taking another gamble on a speculative, unproven coach much like Coach Billups was when he was hired.\n\nSecond, that coach is going to begin his or her career with 50-60 losses to their name. The losing pattern will be imprinted on their opening season, forcing them to inherit the same malaise that you’re firing Billups for. That’s not going to inspire confidence inside or outside the locker room. It’s just more of the same.\n\nFinally, what happens if the new coach doesn’t work out and you have to fire him or her a couple years down the road? Then you’re looking at Scoot Henderson and company going through three different coaches in five seasons. That’s a sure way to mess up young players and a good sign that your franchise is floundering.\n\nGiven that, it might make more sense to ride one more year with Coach Billups, keep the status quo, and reassess next season with a better draft and more talent coming on board, plus a natural break in the coach’s contract appearing. The Blazers might be figuring they’ll draw better candidates at that point, have a better idea what the future holds, and thus absorb less risk.\n\nIf that’s part of the reasoning, I can’t argue with it. It’s not a happy thought, but the Blazers aren’t in a happy place right now. So there you go.\n\nAs to what kind of coach they’ll eventually want, I’ve already talked a little about it. I know it’s predictable because the New York Knicks are the flavor of the month, but I was saying this before they ascended. The Blazers probably need a system-based coach who can hold a line in the vein of Tom Thibodeau, maybe not quite so extreme. They need discipline and a certain amount of rigidity along with the X’s and O’s...someone who will demand good habits and keep the focus on winning.\n\nThe Blazers are a nice franchise now. Part of the problem with being nice in the face of losing is that you become comfortable with it. Teams just kind of surrender to “getting along”. Portland needs less getting along, more getting out of the rut. Otherwise they’re going to find that players don’t really want to come here because they’re not challenged to, nor do they expect to, win. At that point, it doesn’t matter how happy your franchise supposedly is...nobody’s happy."
