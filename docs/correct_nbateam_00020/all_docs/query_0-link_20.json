        "text": "Greenburgh, N.Y.\n\nHe stepped to the foul line and the building boomed, with a sing-songy chant typically reserved for men wearing pinstripes.\n\nThe chorus was joyful, boisterous: “Chaun-cey Bill-ups”  clap, clap, clap-clap-clap.\n\nFor a few seconds Wednesday night, Madison Square Garden sounded like Yankee Stadium, with Chauncey Billups in the role of Derek Jeter. It was a moving moment for an overlooked new arrival, but Billups’s expression never changed. He swished his free throws, got his high-fives and soaked in his first Knicks victory.\n\nIt was a warm moment, a satisfying moment. But this was not the script Billups had written for this late stage of a distinguished N.B.A. career.\n\nIt was supposed to end in Denver, with his hometown Nuggets, at a booming Pepsi Center. Billups would peel off the No. 4 jersey one last time, slip into a suit and move into the front office, a Nugget for life.\n\n“That was the plan,” Billups said with a light smile Thursday. “But as you know, plans don’t always go that way.”\n\nThis alternate ending is jarring, but full of promise. On one side of the court, Billups has Carmelo Anthony, his teammate of three seasons, ready to drive and shoot. On the other, Amar’e Stoudemire, poised to soar. The Knicks are surging, New York is buzzing and Billups  a former N.B.A. finals most valuable player  is blessed with orchestrating a revival.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
