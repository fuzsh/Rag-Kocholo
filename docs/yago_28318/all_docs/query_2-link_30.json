        "meta_description": "\"Bee Movie\" is a comedy that will change everything you think you know about bees. Having just graduated from college, a bee by the name of Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld) finds himself disillusioned with the prospect of having only one career choice - honey. As he ventures outside of the hive for the first time, he breaks one of the cardinal rules of the bee world and talks to a human, a New York City florist named Vanessa (Renée Zellweger). He is shocked to discover that the humans have been stealing and eating the bees' honey for centuries, and ultimately realizes that his true calling in life is to set the world right by suing the human race for stealing their precious honey.",

        "text": "Bees shouldn’t be able to fly! Their bodies are too big for their wings, and yet…This is a cute film which kids will love. It has a few lines for the adults too. Who wouldn’t love a newspaper headline which reads: “Frisbee Hits Hive!” This of course is a real problem in the bee world. The laugh-out-loud funny moments are there. The audience laughed when a mosquito headed toward a blood mobile. Without giving any others away, my personal favorite is when a mosquito decides to become a lawyer, because, “I was already a blood-sucking parasite and all I needed was a brief case!”\n\nThe premise is that a bee named Barry, (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld), becomes friends with a lady named Vanessa Bloome (voiced by Renee Zellweger). As their friendship develops Barry learns that humans have been profiting from the bee’s honey for centuries and he decides to take the case to court to reclaim their rights to the honey. By the film’s end, everyone sees how much the bees are needed to pollinate and do other necessary duties, but will the bees forgive the humans?\n\nThere are a couple of innuendos in the film, and a few scenes of characters slapping each other in a cartoon kind of way, but the film is wholesome overall. We are pleased to award our Dove Seal to the film for all ages, with the suggestion that parents consult the content listing below to make their own informed decisions. Parents and kids will buzz over this movie, bee-cause it’s more fun than a barrel of honey!"
