        "text": "BATTLE CREEK, MI: Pop-Tarts had no involvement with Unfrosted, a fictional film about the pastry’s creation that is set for release by Netflix on Friday — in fact, the brand said it learned about it at the same time as everyone else.\n\nThe movie takes place in 1963 and follows the fictional race between Kellogg’s and Post to create Pop-Tarts. It stars Jerry Seinfeld in his directorial debut.\n\nA few people at Pop-Tarts parent Kellanova have seen “a version” of the film and thought it was “hilarious,” said Heidi Ray, Pop-Tarts’ senior director of brand marketing. Some of the brand’s staffers will attend this week’s premiere.\n\nKellanova spun off from Kellogg Co. last year. It’s other brands include Cheez-It, Eggo and Pringles.\n\nRay referred to Unfrosted as “the biggest fanfiction ever, and the ultimate flattery.”\n\nThe movie, she explained, is based on Seinfeld’s stand-up comedy routine.\n\n“At the heart of the routine is Jerry’s absolute love for our brand, which he continues to share at every turn,” said Ray. “So we couldn't be happier to be the muse for his directorial debut.”\n\nAlthough it’s obvious that Unfrosted is “absolute fiction,” Ray said Pop-Tarts has collaborated with the filmmakers for an unconventional integrated campaign that clearly highlights the theme of, “Not brought to you by Pop-Tarts,” but also encourages fans to enjoy them while watching.\n\nNetflix’s marketing partnerships team approached Pop-Tarts about the idea early this year. Pop-Tarts worked collaboratively with Netflix, the filmmakers, its internal teams, retailers and its agency partners — Le Truc, Weber Shandwick, Digitas and Starcom, among others — to drive awareness of the film and encourage consumers to enjoy it with a Pop-Tart in hand, Ray said.\n\nA Weber Shandwick spokesperson referred requests for comment to Pop-Tarts.\n\nAs part of its partnership with Unfrosted, Pop-Tarts produced a digital short written by and starring Seinfeld and a series of surprise cameos, available to watch on social and digital channels. The short imagines what happens when Seinfeld and fictional Pop-Tarts C-suite executives meet.\n\nThe brand is also giving consumers a chance to win limited-edition “Trat-Pops” boxes, the official box of Unfrosted. The charming typo will be explained when the movie is released, said Ray. The box offers a snack and cinematic collectible that “perfectly complements the delicious whimsy of Unfrosted,” the brand said in a statement.\n\nThere will be multiple in-aisle and online activations at retailers across the country, encouraging fans to “Stream It. Eat It. We got you either way.”"
