        "text": "NOTE: Barry and Vanessa's relationship is not meant to be sexual, so any mention of it will be reverted due to false information.\n\nBee Movie is a 2007 American animated comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and Columbus 81 Productions, and distributed by Paramount Pictures. Directed by Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner (in the former's feature directorial debut) from a screenplay by the writing team of Jerry Seinfeld, Spike Feresten, Barry Marder and Andy Robin.\n\nIt stars the voices of Seinfeld, Renée Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, and Chris Rock.\n\nThe film centers on Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld), a honey bee who tries to sue the human race for exploiting bees after learning from his new florist friend Vanessa Bloome (Zellweger) that humans sell and consume honey.\n\nBee Movie debuted in New York City on October 25, 2007, and was released in theaters in the United States on November 2. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its humor and voice cast but criticized its plot and lack of originality. However, it was a box-office disappointment, grossing $293.5 million worldwide on a budget of $150 million.\n\nNevertheless, it has since gathered a cult following, partly driven by memes of the film shared on social media, which most often lampoon the film's premise, script and celebrity cameos.\n\nPlot:\n\nBarry B. Benson, an idealistic honey bee who has the ability to talk to humans, has recently graduated from college and is about to enter the hive's Honex Industries honey-making workforce with his best friend, Adam Flayman. Barry is initially excited to join the workforce, but his ambitious, insubordinate attitude emerges upon discovering that his choice of job will never change once picked. Later, the two bees run into a group of Pollen Jocks, bees who collect pollen from flowers outside the hive, and they offer to take Barry with them if he is \"bee enough\". While on his first pollen-gathering expedition in New York City, Barry gets lost in the rain, and ends up on the balcony of a human florist named Vanessa Bloome. Upon noticing Barry, Vanessa's boyfriend Ken attempts to squash him, but Vanessa gently catches and releases Barry outside the window, saving his life.\n\nBarry later returns to express his gratitude to Vanessa, breaking the sacred rule that bees are not to communicate with humans. Barry and Vanessa develop a close friendship, bordering on attraction, and spend time together. When he and Vanessa are in the grocery store, Barry discovers that the humans have been stealing and eating the bees' honey for centuries. He decides to journey to Honey Farms, which supplies the grocery store with its honey. Incredulous at the poor treatment of the bees in the hive, including the use of bee smokers to incapacitate the colony, Barry decides to sue the human race to put an end to exploitation of the bees, with Vanessa agreeing to help.\n\nBarry's mission attracts wide attention from bees and humans alike, with countless spectators attending the trial. Although Barry is up against tough defense attorney Layton T. Montgomery, the trial's first day goes well. That evening, Barry is having dinner with Vanessa when Ken shows up. Vanessa leaves the room, and Ken expresses to Barry that he hates the pair spending time together. When Barry leaves to use the restroom, Ken ambushes Barry and attempts to kill him, only for Vanessa to intervene and break up with Ken. The second day at the trial, Montgomery unleashes an unrepentant character assassination against the bees, leading a deeply offended Adam to sting him. Montgomery immediately exaggerates the stinging to make himself seem the victim of an assault while simultaneously tarnishing Adam. Adam's actions jeopardize the bees' credibility and his life, though he recovers. The third day, Barry wins the trial by exposing the jury to the torturous treatment of bees, particularly use of the smoker, and prevents humans from stealing honey from bees ever again. Having lost the trial, Montgomery cryptically warns Barry that a negative shift of nature is imminent.\n\nWith Honex stopping honey production, every bee is put out of a job, including the vitally important Pollen Jocks, resulting in all the world's flowers beginning to die out without any pollination. Before long, the last remaining flowers on Earth are being stockpiled in Pasadena, California, intended for the last Tournament of Roses Parade. Barry and Vanessa travel to the parade and steal a float, which they load into a plane. They hope to bring the flowers to the bees so they can re-pollinate the world's last remaining flowers. When the plane's pilot and co-pilot both fall unconscious, Vanessa is forced to land the plane, with help from Barry and the bees from Barry's hive.\n\nBarry becomes a member of the Pollen Jocks, and they fly off to a flower patch. Armed with the pollen of the last flowers, Barry and the Pollen Jocks reverse the damage and save the world's flowers, restarting the bees' honey production. Later on, Barry runs a law firm at Vanessa's flower shop titled \"Insects at Law\", which handles disputes between animals and humans. While selling flowers to customers, Vanessa offers certain brands of honey that are \"bee-approved\".\n\nBad Qualities:\n\nThe main issue with this movie is that most of the plot and writing comes off poorly written with a unoriginal storyline and faulty premise that stole elements from a good number of other previous movies, most notably A Bug’s Life and Antz.\n\nSome parts of the humor consist of stale bee puns, which can last your nerves.\n\nWhile Barry's anger is understandable, he takes it out a bit too much as he attempts to sue the entire human race.\n\nWhile Jerry Seinfeld's voice acting is good, he sounds way too old to play Barry.\n\nThe ending, while it is good, doesn't portray a bee's work in a realistic way.\n\nDespite being funny to some, there are some infamous scenes, such as:\n\nLayton accusing Barry of being Vanessa's sex partner. (Are you her little...bed bug?). This is VERY INAPPROPRIATE for a kids' movie.\n\nBarry stating that every bee is each-other's cousin, which sounds like an incesteous joke.\n\nBarry imagining Vanessa crashing a plane on accident and her exploding.\n\nThe \"Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?!\" joke is very offensive to white people.\n\nWhen Barry suggests to Vanessa to do a suicide pact. (Yes, really! In a kids movie!)\n\nThere is some product placement every now and then such as Build a Bear, Bumblebee tuna, Yogi Bear etc.\n\nStunt casting: While Patrick Warburton did a good performance as Ken, it can get very annoying at times any time when he starts shouting.\n\nThere some plot holes:\n\nIf \"not talking to humans\" is a major bee law, how does Barry gets no repercussions or punishment for breaking it?\n\nThe bees decide to stop making honey because of having way too much. However, they had no reason to stop pollinating.\n\nSomeone claims that the Pasadena parade has the \"last flowers in the world.\" But Barry's lawsuit only affected the USA; bees in other countries are presumably still pollinating flowers as usual.\n\nAfter winning the case, all the honey that the humans had is returned to the bees thanks to Barry; However, there is a big difference between the natural bee-made honey and the human modified honey that it's sell in stores since they contain various types of chemicals and saturated fats that only humans are able make, if Barry took the human-made honey to all of the hives, it's likely that many of them ended up sick.\n\nThe movie actually stole Winnie the Pooh, without any permission! This would've led Disney suing DreamWorks for copyright infringement!\n\nGood Qualities\n\nAs with all DreamWorks movies, Bee Movie has wonderful and realistic animation that is very impressive.\n\nThere some decent/good characters:\n\nBarry is a cool and likable protagonist who tries to do good at his job as a pollen jock, and makes an iconic friendship with a human, and he develops an understandable anger towards humans since they steal their honey. He can even be a role model since he shows that you have to stand up for your community.\n\nKen is an entertaining antagonist who has funny quotes, such as \"When will this nightmare end?!\", and his motives behind his hatred for Barry is understandable enough since his own wife starts to like a bee better than him out of nowhere.\n\nThe idea of a bee meeting a human he becomes friends with and suing people for stealing their honey is quite an original premise.\n\nThe soundtrack is good.\n\nThere are some funny moments like the bathroom brawl.\n\nGreat voice acting.\n\nChris Rock's mosquito character is very funny.\n\nA good message, the message being that all life is valuable because we each play a major part in our ecosystem. Everyone has an important role in society. Bees are essential to our survival, and they can do so much more than win Supreme Court cases.\n\nIt shows the importance of bees and their pollination, as when the bees successfully sue humans, the trees and flowers becomes wilted and depressing, which shows that the reason nature is so pretty is because of bees.\n\nGreat humor, which is most likely due to Jerry Seinfeld, a popular comedian, working on the film, and his contributions are considered one of the best parts of the film.\n\nInteresting cameos from the late Larry King, Ray Liotta and even Sting.\n\nTrivia\n\nIt is one of the most famous memes, spawning memes such as \"Ya Like Jazz?\", \"That's a drag queen!\" and \"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly...\". In fact, the entire script itself is a meme.\n\nRenée Zellweger, who voiced Vanessa, also starred in another DreamWorks Animation film, Shark Tale.\n\nThe second DreamWorks movie to star Chris Rock, the first being Madagascar.\n\nPatrick Warburton would star in yet another DreamWorks project seven years later, doing voice-work for Mr. Peabody and Sherman, as Agamemnon.\n\nReception\n\nBee Movie has an approval rating of 49% based on 174 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 5.6/10. Its critical consensus reads, \"Bee Movie has humorous moments, but its awkward premise and tame delivery render it mostly forgettable.\"\n\nOMW rated the movie a 52% based on 199 users, the website’s concenus reads: “Bee Movie’s awkward premise and overabundance of bee related puns feels outdated especially in a post Bug’s Life world.”\n\nMetacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned the movie a score of 54 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale."
