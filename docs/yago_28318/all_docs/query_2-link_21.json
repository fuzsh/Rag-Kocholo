        "text": "This article contains spolers to the movie: “Bee Movie”.\n\n“Bee Movie” is a 2007 animated family movie. It was directed by Simon J. Smith and written by Jerry Seinfeld, who also dubs the main character. The movie is about a bee named Barry, which discovers the outside world. The movie’s main themes are working together and work ethics. Two of the secondary themes in the movie are the role of humans in the world and exploitation. In this article I’ll analyze the movie’s approach to these secondary subjects and express my opinion on how it deals with them.\n\nBarry is a bee who lives in an isolated hive that is divided to different honey – producing sections. The only bees that see the outside world are the jocks, and they aren’t supposed to interact with humans. One day Barry decides to join the jocks, so he flies outside and sees the outside world. He doesn’t listen to the rules he is told, meets a human girl named Vanessa, and soon enough becomes friends with her. One day they go to the supermarket, and Barry notices the honey section. He is surprised by that, and enraged to the fact that humans are taking away bees’ honey. He learns more about the situation, and finds out that bees are held captive and tortured by the humans they are forced to make honey for. He decides to tell the other bees in his hive about their family’s exploitation, and sues the major honey companies. The bees win the trial win, get all their honey back, and decide to stop working due to the sudden surplus of it. After some time Barry discovers that because bees are no longer working, they no longer scatter stamens, and all the flowers are dying. The bees decide to continue their honey producing, while allowing humans to take it.\n\nThe movie suggests that exploiting bees is the lesser of a two evils. It does so by claiming that if humans won’t exploit bees, bees won’t make honey, and all flowers would die (as happens in the third act of the movie). This is an intentional falsification of the truth, meant only to justify humans’ abuse and exploitation of bees (and other animals). I do not claim that humans shouldn’t consume honey and other animal – produced products, and one can even claim that it is some sort of a “necessary evil”. That being said, I think that hiding the truth about the moral implications of exploiting animals in a disguise of helping bees and flowers isn’t the way to go.\n\nAfter the bees start making honey again, Barry becomes a lawyer for animals who feel exploited by the human products industry. He represents a cow that claims her milk is used by humans, while she doesn’t get paid for what she produces. This scene suggests that if cows were paid for their exploitation, milking them will be moral. This is another case of hiding the truth, as the problem of the exploitation of cows isn’t them not getting paid (as they infect get paid in the form of food and showers), but being abused in the milk and meat industry.\n\nOn the other side, the movie answers this claim by presenting to the audience “bee approved honey” in a one of the later scenes. This would have answered my claim, if not for the fact that bees aren’t capable of deciding to give humans honey, and are forced to give it away.\n\nIn conclusion, “Bee Movie” is a fun and impressive movie. Its main ideas about work ethics and working together are nice, but its secondary idea of the role of humans as being served by bees has problems. I believe that one doesn’t have to be vegan nor vegetarian to agree that lying about the moral implications of exploiting bees isn’t the right way to convince kids to consume products taken from animals. The right way to do so is claiming that it is a “necessary evil”."
