[It] really was not intentional, but after it came out, I realized this is really not appropriate for children. Because the bee seemed to have a thing for the girl, and we don't really want to pursue that as an idea in children's entertainment,\" he said. Seineld wrote the script and also featured in it.\n\nFor those of you who are not in the know, Bee Movie saw Seinfeld as a bee named Barry B. Benson who develops romantic feelings for a human florist named Vanessa Bloome (voiced by Renée Zellweger).\n\nThe film eventually ended up being a legal thriller.\n\nAlso read: Hermes hosts fashion show at Paris airport hangar\n\nIt is this bizarreness of the screenplay that has led to multiple meme fests over the years. \"This was a reaction not just to the movie itself but to the realization among millennials that they'd been shown a truly odd movie as children and thought nothing of it. The Bee Movie memes are all, on some level, expressions of disbelief,\" as journalist Gabe Bergado said of the movie in 2017.\n\n'Bee Movie' is currently available to stream on Netflix."
