        "text": "\"None of this is important,\" the comedian and director reminded an irate crew member.\n\nNo temper tantrums for you!\n\nThat was Jerry Seinfeld's message to an irate crew member on the set of Unfrosted, his directorial debut about the invention of the world's most popular toaster pastry.\n\nAt the red carpet premiere of the Netflix comedy (streaming May 3), the Seinfeld mastermind told Entertainment Weekly how he diffused a tense situation during production of the film by reminding everyone not to take themselves too seriously.\n\n\"There was one moment where somebody on the crew lost their temper in a very bad way and started yelling really loud and everyone just froze,\" Seinfeld said. \"It was one of those, you know, 'lose it' moments that makes everybody freeze.\"\n\nHow did he handle the situation? \"I said, 'Everybody stop,'\" the comedian-turned-filmmaker recalled. \"I go, 'This is a Pop-Tart movie, we are not going to have anybody freaking out. None of this is important.' And everybody laughed and we just went back to work. It was fun.\"\n\nDirected by Seinfeld from a script he wrote with Spike Feresten, Barry Marder, and Andy Robin, Unfrosted chronicles the great breakfast pastry war of 1963, in which Kellogg's and Post competed to see who would be the first to bring a poppable tart to market.\n\nA testy crew member wasn't the only headache Seinfeld encountered on the project. During a recent Tonight Show appearance, Seinfeld called Hugh Grant, who plays actor Thurl Ravenscroft in the film, \"a pain in the ass to work with.\"\n\n\"We had lots of fights,\" Seinfeld joked. \"He tells you before you work with him, 'You're gonna hate this.’ And he's so right.\"\n\nThe two did eventually find a simpatico relationship, and Grant even quipped to EW that he had a \"grrrrreaaat\" time making the film and portraying Kellogg's mascot Tony the Tiger. \"Jerry brings different things to the table,\" he added. \"He's a brilliant comic, and he'd written a great script. He and his team are able to massage the scene and the whole time and come up with new jokes left, right, and center. He was lovely and very supportive of me.\"\n\nWant more movie news?
