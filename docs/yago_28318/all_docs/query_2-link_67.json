Benson (Seinfeld) soars out into the world in search of nectar and adventure. But when he breaks one of the cardinal rules of beedom and speaks to humans, including Vanessa Bloom (voiced by Ren√©e Zellweger), Barry sets off an un-bee-lievable chain of events that proves even a little bee can make a big difference.",

        "text": "Seinfeld's brand of observational humor is in full force, only imbued with more imagination and irony when applied to the bee world.\n\nMay 3, 2024\n\nSeinfeld's dry delivery makes for a certain adult sensibility, but even the horde of celebrity cameos can't really lift the story off the ground.\n\nAugust 22, 2017\n\nIts moral that even the smallest creature can make a world of difference is one to be appreciated. It is a shame, however, that it could not keep up its energetic and fun pace established within its first act.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
