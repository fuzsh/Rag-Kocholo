        "text": "Comedian Jerry Seinfeld is telling it how it is and thus recently did not hesitate to share a candid insight during an interview with GQ magazine. Despite his extensive experience in the industry and involvement across various genres, including his upcoming directorial debut, Seinfeld acknowledged a harsh reality and that the industry might be on the decline. Nonetheless, he moved forward with his directorial venture, undeterred by the current challenging landscape as per the actor himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy Jerry Seinfeld Thinks the Movie Industry is Over\n\nJerry Seinfeld complained about the lack of grand, enduring cinematic spectacles that once captivated audiences for months on end. He noted a decline in the impact of modern films compared to their predecessors.\n\nIn an interview with GQ, Seinfeld discussed his foray into a new realm, directing for Netflix. It was during this experience that he came to the realization that the current oversaturation of the market has diminished the overall quality of the experience. He said,\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It was totally new to me. I thought I had done some cool stuff, but it was nothing like the way these people work. They’re so dead serious! They don’t have any idea that the movie business is over. They have no idea.”\n\nHe further explained,\n\n“Film doesn’t occupy the pinnacle in the social, cultural hierarchy that it did for most of our lives. When a movie came out, if it was good, we all went to see it. We all discussed it. We quoted lines and scenes we liked. Now we’re walking through a fire hose of water, just trying to see.”\n\nSeinfeld expressed his lament over the considerable decline in the once-grand movie industry. The craze surrounding movies and movie stars has noticeably declined, attributed largely to the absence of mystery, perhaps. The abrupt change in trends has left people feeling perplexed. When discussing potential replacements for movies, Seinfeld remarked on the uncertainty of what might fill that void. He said,\n\n“Depression? Malaise? I would say confusion. Disorientation replaced the movie business. Everyone I know in show business, every day, is going, ‘What’s going on? How do you do this? What are we supposed to do now?’”\n\nWith the overwhelming availability and accessibility of information and numerous avenues for fame, the allure of cinema has diminished. This shift has led many to gravitate towards stand-up comedy, a profession that currently is attracting the most attention, according to the actor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy Jerry Seinfeld Made a Film Despite His Belief That the Industry is Declining?\n\nDespite his belief that the movie business is on the decline, why did Jerry Seinfeld choose to direct a new movie for Netflix? It’s for the experience and the pure ecstasy he feels when performing stand-up on stage. When asked about his decision to direct a movie in this dwindling industry, he explained in the same GQ conversation,\n\n“Being a director feels like running a ranch in the West. It’s kind of a mess. You’ve got horses and cattle and chickens and broken fences and filth. You’ve got a lot of people and a lot of physical things. Stand-up is this very pure experience. This is why I’m so addicted to it. The only other thing in life that I truly idolize is surfing. “\n\nHe further continued,\n\n“I watch a lot of Instagram surfing videos, and when somebody catches a great wave and they’re just sliding down it, it just hypnotizes me. That’s how it feels when you’re having a good set—like you’ve caught this gigantic energy and are just sliding down it. There’s nothing pure in making a movie. There’s no flow. It’s highly complex and messy.”\n\nFor his directorial debut, Jerry Seinfeld ventured into filmmaking driven by the pure energy the experience promised. Unfrosted narrates the 1963 saga of cereal rivals Kellogg’s and Post, engaged in a heated competition to invent breakfast pop-tarts that would revolutionize mornings forever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie also features a ton of funny people and they are Melissa McCarthy, Jim Gaffigan, Hugh Grant, Amy Schumer, Max Greenfield, Christian Slater, Sarah Cooper, and Bill Burr, to name a few."
