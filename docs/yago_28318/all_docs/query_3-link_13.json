        "text": "Seinfeld recently found a new home on Netflix, which means that Jerry Seinfeld is making the rounds on late night shows, and after appearing on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon, Jerry Seinfeld delved into a mistake from his past.\n\nSeinfeld apologized for a deeply inappropriate relationship (not the time he dated a teenager), but for the bizarre sexual tension in Bee Movie, the much-mocked children’s movie destined to gather dust in bargain bins, but ended up transcending into a powerful, persistent meme, thanks to the internet’s love for earnestly-made garbage.\n\n“I apologize for what seems to be a certain uncomfortable, subtle sexual aspect of the Bee Movie, which really was not intentional,” Seinfeld said to the audience. “But after it came out, I realized ‘This is really not appropriate for children.’ Because the bee seems to have a thing for the girl.”\n\nSeinfeld, who was one of the writers of the film, as well as the voice of Barry (the bee), surely had plenty of opportunities to remove the romantic undertones in the writer’s room, but perhaps the depth of the mistake only became obvious in hindsight.\n\nFellow Bee Movie writer Spike Feresten once said of the film:\n\n“Often we would lose sight of those characters in the room. They would just be Barry and Vanessa, and we would write this dialogue for Barry and Vanessa, and read it over and have to remind ourselves, well, this is a tiny bee saying this, and the tiny bee is fighting with her boyfriend, so let’s dial it back to friend, and make it less romantic, because it’s getting weird.”\n\nOf course, without the steamy relationship between Vanessa and Barry, it’s doubtful that the film (which ends with Vanessa leaving her boyfriend for a bee) would have left such an impression on the young minds who watched it. Those children eventually logged onto the internet to joke about the weirdness of the movie, which inspired thousands of increasingly elaborate memes.\n\nWithout Bee Movie, we wouldn’t have the phrase “beestiality,” or be able to buy T-shirts featuring the film’s script, word-for-word, squished for scale. The film has inspired so many jokes and memes that its pop culture footprint almost rivals that of Disney’s Frozen, although Bee Movie’s fandom is almost entirely ironic.\n\nOne man captured a real bumblebee and forced it to watch Bee Movie, while another re-edited the film so that every time the word “bee” is uttered, it speeds up - the video has been viewed more than 6 million times. In 2017, a Netflix user from the UK watched the film no less than 357 times.\n\nBee Movie is still available to stream on Netflix, if you’re curious to see what provoked Seinfeld’s tongue-in-cheek apology, and inspired some of the weirdest memes on the internet."
