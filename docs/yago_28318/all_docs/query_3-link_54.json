Comedian Jerry Seinfeld unveiled his latest project at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday (May 17) by flying in a bee costume from a Cannes hotel. Seinfeld leapt off the top of the Carlton Hotel and flew to the beach on a wire whilst joking that the stunt smacked of desperation.\n\nThe stunt was to promote new Dreamworks animated film \"Bee Movie\" which Seinfeld wrote. Seinfeld also provides the voice for the lead character in the movie.\n\n\"Bee Movie\" charts the adventures of a bee that leaves his hive and sues food manufacturers for stealing honey.\n\nSeinfeld has spent over three years on the project and is his first foray into film after his show 'Seinfeld' finished in 1998. He said he wrote a story about bees he found them amusing.\n\n\"I find them funny as a species. You know the big stripes and the fat little bodies and they work so hard, and the honey is the only, you know, except for like cows and milk, it's the only animal that makes something that everybody loves,\" he said.\n\n\"We have a close relationship with them, even though sometimes people are scared of them, everyone has honey and everyone eats honey and they don't know that we are taking it,\" he added about the off-beat plot.\n\nThe film also stars Chris Rock as a wise-cracking mosquito, who was also in Cannes to promote the film.\n\n\"I've been dying to get a good mosquito part. Scorcese sent me a script but it wasn't quite ready so I figured I'd do this one, I figured Jerry's was better,\" he quipped.\n\n\"Bee Movie\" is set to land in U.S. theatres on November\n\nCopyright Holder: REUTERS\n\nCopyright Notice: (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2011.
