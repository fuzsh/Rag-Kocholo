        "text": "Billionaire comedian Jerry Seinfeld is going to make his feature directorial debut with Unfrosted under the banner of streaming giant, Netflix. However, the legendary comedian has a different point of view when it comes to the movie business.\n\nJerry Seinfeld Claimed That Movie Business Is Over\n\nTo complement his legendary career in showbiz and as a comedian, Jerry Seinfeld has helmed a Netflix-backed movie, Unfrosted starring himself alongside a roster of stars including Melissa McCarthy and Jim Gaffigan. The movie is loosely based on the true story of the creation of Pop-Tarts toaster pastries.\n\nHowever, Seinfeld is skeptical of the movie business, in a chat with GQ, the actor/comedian/director revealed that making a movie is not the same as it used to be. “It was totally new to me,” the Seinfeld star said. “I thought I had done some cool stuff, but it was nothing like the way these people work,” he continued.\n\n“They’re so dead serious! They don’t have any idea that the movie business is over. They have no idea,” he continued. Explaining further Seinfeld said, “Film doesn’t occupy the pinnacle in the social, cultural hierarchy that it did for most of our lives. When a movie came out, if it was good, we all went to see it. We all discussed it. We quoted lines and scenes we liked. Now we’re walking through a fire hose of water, just trying to see.”\n\nThe perspective of the comedian is scary as he found the business to be distasteful at best.\n\nJerry Seinfeld Hailed Stand-Up Comedy\n\nSeinfeld is quite devoted to his career as a stand-up comedian while being a vehement critic of filmmaking. “Depression? Malaise? I would say confusion,” replaced cinematic prowess. “Disorientation replaced the movie business,” he continued. “Everyone I know in show business, every day, is going, ‘What’s going on? How do you do this? What are we supposed to do now?’”\n\nWith a hint of nostalgia, the actor recalled his early career. “I’ve done enough stuff that I have my own thing, which is more valuable than it’s ever been,” Seinfeld said.\n\n“Stand-up is like you’re a cabinetmaker, and everybody needs a guy who’s good with wood. … There’s trees everywhere, but to make a nice table, it’s not so easy. So, the metaphor is that if you have good craft and craftsmanship, you’re kind of impervious to the whims of the industry.”\n\nThe comedian further reflected on the rise of stand-up comedy. “Audiences are now flocking to stand-up because it’s something you can’t fake,” he said. “It’s like platform diving. You could say you’re a platform diver, but in two seconds we can see if you are or you aren’t. That’s what people like about stand-up. They can trust it. Everything else is fake.”\n\nSeinfeld Unfrosted also Amy Schumer, James Marsden, Jack McBrayer, Thomas Lennon, Bobby Moynihan, Maria Bakalova, Max Greenfield, Bill Burr, Dan Levy, Christian Slater, and Hugh Grant."
