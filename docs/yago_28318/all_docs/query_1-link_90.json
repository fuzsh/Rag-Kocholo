        "text": "So Toys\"R\"Us made an ad with GenAI (Sora). Is it any good? And what does it tell us about GenAI created ads? Letâ€™s start with the easy part. This is likely to be an effective ad for Toys \"R\" Us. Itâ€™s highly memorable, clearly linked to the brand, and looks to be driving a behavior change i.e. people are more likely to choose Toys R Us. All of this puts it well into the top third of our database. Ads that score here deliver on average a 21% higher sales lift than an average ad. Thatâ€™s typically worth millions of dollars. How does it work? ðŸ§“ Nostalgia is often a good tactic, when done the right way. Too many brands think average people care about their history, which we donâ€™t, but this was meaningful for many viewers who used to shop at the store. For more on nostalgia, see the incredible paper by Samira Brophy and Effie UK linked below. ðŸ¦’ Great branding. Not just brand on screen, but Geoffrey the Giraffe a key character and the Toys \"R\" Us brand central to the whole story. ðŸ—ž It contains news. The Macyâ€™s tie-in is important to people. Many viewers (myself included!) thought the brand had gone bankrupt and was no longer active. To think in Byron Sharp terms, the ad not only (re)builds the mental availability of a fallen iconic brand, but also informs of the physical availability of the brand in Macyâ€™s stores. Some will say that news = rational persuasion = not important for advertising. Nonsense. In fact, most ads arenâ€™t exclusively emotional or rational, they are non-binary. What matters most is if it works, not how it works. The â€˜howâ€™ can lead you to rules and formulaic advertising that inhibit creativity. This ad wraps up some interesting news in a warm, nostalgic hug, meaning you pay more attention and are more accepting of the message. But take out the Macyâ€™s information, and this wouldnâ€™t be so effective. So the big question, is GenAI going to takeover? Not so fast. We canâ€™t tell that from one ad. Our broader data, so far, would indicate that GenAI ads are slightly less effective than those made with human intelligence and real people exercising real creativity. More to come on this soon, in a broader Ipsos POV being authored by Diana Livadic It seems this what we have here is a very strong ad, so strong it potentially overshadows the slightly creepy factor. Because donâ€™t get me wrong, some people do notice it, but for everyone who says: ðŸ—£ \"Sorry to destroy the innocence of the ad; but I couldn't help but think that this kid was on an acid trip.\" There are many more who say: ðŸ—£\"I liked the almost cinematic approach that it took and the sense of nostalgia in sort of inviting you into a new world of magic. It seemed and reminded me of the old Willy Wonka movie.\" Always remember the first rule of Marketing, according to Mark Ritson. Market Orientation. You are not the consumer. In this case, for real people, production quality is secondary to the basics of good advertising. Like this?

Genuinely, yesterday was my favourite time ever on a golf course, and I wasn't even playing (which is probably part of the reason why). It was the climatic part of a lengthy, multi-location video shoot, and the objective was simple: play golf as terribly as humanly f**king possible. So, in other words, just play golf. I lost the plot when our outstanding actor took to the 16th green for some putting. Watching him repeatedly come in and out of shot as the ball rolled too far left and too far right was like the best Benny Hill sketch, but it was the final putt that destroyed me. All he was asked to do was hole it, and from a pretty close distance, too. Instead, he ignored this instruction and improvised, hitting the most spectacular sh*t putt that sent the ball straight into the flagpole, firing it off the side of the green and down to the next fairway at high speed. The \"DONG!\" sound just ended me (as you can see from Andrew Demetriou's photographic evidence). Woeful golf and hyperactivity aside, this video has been a seriously long time coming. I've been working on it since the end of October/November, so seeing it leap to life from my brain, to storyboarding, and finally, to the camera, has been flipping joyous. If I was *this* level of excitable puppy on the shoot, imagine what I'll be like when I get to see the final edit. Borderline friggin' unbearable. Finally Agency #branding #content #creative #video\n\nNeonâ€™s Brilliant Breadcrumb Campaign For LONGLEGS Proves That Sometimes Less Is More We love it when studios take an unexpected approach to film marketing. It needs to be recognized and celebrated. To that end, Neon is doing a masterful job unspooling its July release LONGLEGS. Twenty years ago, horror campaigns were fairly plug-and-play. Studios assumed that there was a finite audience for the genre, so there was no need to do long-lead marketing. Throw some money at it two weeks before release, and youâ€™re good to go. Thankfully, thatâ€™s not the case anymore. There is no better example of that than Neonâ€™s deeply unsettling campaign for LONGLEGS. We mean that as a compliment. So far it's paying off. At The Quorum, the four key tracking metrics show that the film is performing quite well. Interest in the movie is at 49%, which is easily above the average of 39% for other horror films at the same distance from release. Itâ€™s also well above the average in location and fee, meaning people are willing to pay to see the movie in a theater. See full story here: https://bit.ly/3w5TznN"
