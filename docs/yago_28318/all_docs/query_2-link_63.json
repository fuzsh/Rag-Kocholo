        "text": "Barry B. Benson (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld) wants to be no ordinary bee. The thought of working himself to death doesn’t appeal to him much and so he goes beyond the bounds of his hive and out into the world where he encounters Vanessa (Renee Zellweger), a florist, who saves him from being swatted by her angry boyfriend, Ken (Patrick Warburton). Barry breaks a cardinal rule of bees, talks to Vanessa and the two become firm friends.\n\nBarry’s life takes on a new dimension however, when he discovers that humans steal bee honey and enslave bees to produce honey for them. He takes his righteous anger to the high court but when he wins his case, Barry is unprepared for the disaster it unleashes."
