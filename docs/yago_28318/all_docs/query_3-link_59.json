        "text": "When Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld) graduates college he is disenchanted with the idea that, as a bee, he only gets to pick from one career path: making honey. So, he decides to leave the hive and encounters a New York florist named Vanessa (Renee Zellweger), who saves his life, and in the process learns that bees can talk. But, talking to humans is against bee law, as Barry’s best friend Adam (Matthew Broderick) is quick to remind him. However, Barry continues talking to Vanessa until he learns a horrible truth. Humans are harvesting honey from bees and selling it on a mass scale purely for consumption. Outraged that bee labor is being used to benefit humans, Barry decides to take legal action and sue the entire human race.\n\nBee Movie is exactly as it sounds, a clever animated movie about the work addicted lives of bees. Jerry Seinfeld (who both voices the lead role and wrote the script) shines in his classic fashion. There are enough jokes and slapstick to keep parents and kids engaged throughout. However, the movie has odd turns and spends over twenty minutes of its run time in a court scene. Yes, there are twenty minutes of witnesses and evidence in a children’s movie. Though the characters are fun, and the audience will certainly be rooting for Barry, there are things they will just have to accept- primarily the fact that the movie portrays a half-developed love interest between Vanessa (a human) and Barry the bee. As a kid, I don’t remember that confusing me, but watching it back now, it strikes me as odd.\n\nBee Movie also does not seem to have a central message. For part of the movie, I thought the message was one of inclusion as Barry tries to have a relationship with a human and is rejected by friends and family. Then the movie takes a more environmentally-conscious turn, by having Barry engage with “evil” beekeepers who are capturing hundreds of bees. But by the end of the movie, it looks as though the message revolved around humans and animals (in this case insects) living in harmony instead of animosity.\n\nBee Movie is a great movie for young kids. It will keep them engaged and laughing through its thankfully short run-time. Jerry Seinfeld is hilarious and has jokes that I found laugh-out-loud funny even now. But don’t watch Bee Movie looking for a clear message; instead enjoy it for what it does offer, and then let it be(e).\n\nCheck out Bee Movie here at the library.\n\n*review by Brennan Kress."
