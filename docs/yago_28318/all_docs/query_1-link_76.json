Pop-Tarts are the subject of Jerry Seinfeld's highly anticipated Netflix film, UNFROSTED, a fictional comedy about the Pop-Tarts' origin story, which was created without the involvement of the brand.\n\nWhile UNFROSTED is not brought to you by Pop-Tarts, to celebrate its release, and just in time for the brand's 60th anniversary, Pop-Tarts and the filmmakers are joining forces in an integrated campaign to inspire at-home fans to enjoy UNFROSTED with a Pop-Tarts® toaster pastry in hand.\n\nAs part of the partnership with UNFROSTED, fans can expect:\n\nA Pop-Tarts produced Digital Short written by and starring Jerry Seinfeld and a series of surprise cameos, available to watch on social and digital channels. In collaboration with Pop-Tarts, creative collective Le Truc, and Netflix Marketing Partnerships, the short imagines what happens when Jerry and fictional Pop-Tarts C-suite executives meet.\n\nA chance to win limited-edition \"Trat-Pops\" boxes, the official box of the UNFROSTED movie.

Sign up on poptarts.com/Unfrosted starting April 29. No purchase necessary. See full rules.\n\nMultiple in-aisle and online activations at retailers across the country, encouraging fans to \"Stream It. Eat It. We got you either way.\"\n\nSocial content and media partnerships that demonstrate the best way to stream this film is while enjoying Pop-Tarts.\n\nMore surprises and Crazy Good antics throughout the film's press tour.\n\n\"UNFROSTED is the ultimate flattery, and the biggest fanfiction ever,\" said Heidi Ray, Senior Director of Brand Marketing, Pop-Tarts. \"At every level of fandom, Pop-Tarts continues to spark creativity – from the user-generated Edible Mascot memes at the Pop-Tarts Bowl to a homemade recipe from arguably the world's biggest pop star, and now to Jerry Seinfeld's UNFROSTED film. We've been at the heart of culture for 60 years, and look forward to inspiring it for many, many more.\"\n\nFollow along on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook for Crazy Good surprises from Pop-Tarts – and don't forget to stream UNFROSTED on Netflix May 3.\n\nAbout Kellanova\n\nKellanova (NYSE: K) is a leader in global snacking, international cereal and noodles, and North America frozen foods with a legacy stretching back more than 100 years.
