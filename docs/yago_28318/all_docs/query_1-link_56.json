What isnât there to like about each of the characters? Moving from one adventure to another in every episode, most of the scenes take place in New York City.\n\nElaine Benes is a close friend of Jerry Seinfeld â they used to date, in fact, and remained close friends after the relationship cooled. Sheâs described as often âacid-tonguedâ, sarcastic and pessimistic but thatâs exactly what viewers loved about her.\n\nBut before we cover all of the characters in this much-loved sitcom, letâs talk about the main star of the show, Jerry Seinfeld. He is a comedian who lives a life that provides fodder for his comedy act. The funny part is, that his real life is indeed quite comedic!\n\nBeing the main character in the show, there is much to point out about his quirky personality. Jerry is a clean freak for instance and breaks off several relationships for reasons like his girlfriend eating her peas one at a time, or refusing to sample his pie at the restaurant.\n\nPart of the reason Jerryâs life gives viewers so much to laugh at is the ever conniving George. George Costanza is continuously getting into jams of one sort or another, usually by trying to pull one over on someone or planning some other dishonest or devious event.\n\nRounding up the famous four is Cosmo Kramer, affectionately known as Kramer. Heâs a guy who always has a money making scheme on the go and provides side-splitting anecdotes of his personal escapades.\n\nSeinfeld Locations\n\nThe production of Seinfeld takes place mostly in California at multiple studios. Desilu Cahuenga Studios and Ren-Mar Studios, now called Red Studios, were the home of the beginning of Seinfeld. The pilot took off here, and the best was yet to come!\n\nCBS Studio Center was the place where Jerryâs apartment was found and many outdoor scenes were created, like different shops where the castâs antics took place as they shopped and dined. However, besides the studio shoots, there are multiple funny scenes in Seinfeld episodes that take place in New York City. If youâd like to travel to New York City to walk in the steps of the Seinfeld characters, there are many walkable tours that can make you feel like a part of the show.\n\nThe infamous Monkâs Cafe, is actually Tomâs Restaurant, right on Broadway. Take a look below at our scene coverage to see more about this favorite eatery of the Seinfeld gang. And of course, Yankee Stadium plays a part as do other various locations. While in NYC scoping out Seinfeld locations, of course, you can also see wonderful sights like Times Square and The Empire State Building.\n\nDo you remember âThe Soup Naziâ? Kramer is raving over the soup at the new eatery nearby. Hilarious scenes ensue at the restaurant, including Elaine getting banned from buying soup for a year when she annoys the soup seller. Instead, she could have followed the soup rules.\n\nIn various funny Seinfeld scenes, George, Jerry, Elaine, Kramer and even Newman made their way to the soup shop. When Elaine gets a hold of some of the soup manâs recipes after she was banned from the establishment, she returns and says. âYouâre through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. NEXT!â\n\nVisit The Original Soupman on West 55th Street to try their chili or lobster bisque. Take the subway to the Columbus Circle stop, see some of Central Park to build up your appetite, and then grab a bowl of soup!\n\nLocate New York Filming Locations\n\nAre you someone who loves to see valuable pieces of days gone by? Sothebyâs is the place to go! Past auctions have included items from Karl Lagerfieldâs estates and incredible collections of wine compiled by philanthropists.\n\nIn âThe Bottle Depositâ, Elaineâs boss sends her to Sothebyâs to attend an auction and purchase JFKâs golf clubs. While there, she gets into a bidding war with an old rival â nothing is ever straightforward with Elaine, right? Although Elaine does win the coveted Sothebyâs item of the esteemed golf clubs, she pays double the intended price.\n\nIn the scene, youâll see Elaine and her rival Sue Ellen trying to outbid each other for the clubs. Elaine is the victor, only to have the clubs leave in Jerryâs car when the mechanic takes it for repair. Why not take a visit to Sothebyâs yourself? Found on York Avenue, you can peruse the galleries of this famous auction house and view some pretty cool art on exhibition the week before itâs auctioned off. Take the Eastbound M66 which runs every 12 minutes.\n\nFind New York Video Shoot Locations\n\nIf you want to see the actual building where Kramerâs apartment (as well as Jerryâs and Newmanâs) is, head to Koreatown in LA and 757 S. New Hampshire Avenue. How cool is it to stand in front of the iconic building where these 3 Seinfeld characters lived?\n\nThis crazy episode, called âThe Merv Griffin Showâ, has scenes with Kramer acting as though he is on stage at the Merv Griffin studio. He interviews everyone who enters his apartment. The talk show eventually gets changed to a tabloid talk show involving animals. Not only that, but Newman is Kramerâs trusty co-host, which adds an additional spin.\n\nParticipants in the Merv Griffin set scene were Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer, with Newman making an appearance also. When Elaine arrives, she is quite surprised at the whole setup and asks Kramer what is going on.\n\nShe does not want to cooperate with his interview-style banter and turns to Jerry and says, âI am going to sidle the sidler!â Sheâs referring to a character who sneaks up on her at work. Youâll see this Seinfeld location where so much took place every day by walking to the apartment building just a few minutes from Koreatown. Enjoy the stroll!\n\nNew York Film Shoot Locations Directory\n\nRemember the Seinfeld episode called âThe Beardâ, when George Costanza dons a wig and both looks and feels different? He gains confidence with a full head of hair and agrees to go on a date with Kramerâs friend, Denise.\n\nThe date is at Monkâs, of course, and George discovers that Denise is bald. He has a full head of hair because of the toupee and is not impressed with Deniseâs baldness. Upon returning to Jerryâs, George relays his disappointment and Elaine throws the wig out the window.\n\nBut the scene weâre talking about takes place back at Monkâs days later. Jerry and George are the characters in the scene. George says over a cup of coffee with his buddy, âI tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic. It's a pleasure.â Thatâs so George, isnât it?\n\nWhy not have a cup of coffee in the first or second booth, the favorite spot of the Seinfeld gang? While you wonât find Ruthie the waitress or Babu Bhatt the busboy, you can try a Lumberjack Breakfast or a Greek Salad.\n\nHead to Broadway; Cathedral Parkway subway station or buses M4 and M104 will get you there.\n\nUncover New York Production Spaces\n\nâThe Libraryâ episode opens with Jerry saying, âLet me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke, right? What are you? From a radio station?â Have you ever been late returning a library book? How about 25 years late? Jerry takes a trip to the New York Public Library to discuss his much overdue return of Henry Millerâs Tropic of Cancer. Mr. Bookman is the library investigations officer that Marion, the librarian, says will hear the case.\n\nAn overdue fine will not be overlooked, especially since Jerry has been enjoying the book since 1971. Itâs the letter from the library that alerts Jerry to the trouble and of course, antics ensue. George and Kramer accompany Jerry to the library. Kramer, ever the ladies' man, begins an affair with the librarian. George, when entering the building sees a homeless man that he is certain is his former gym teacher.\n\nThe library building that the Seinfeld crew went to is no longer a lending library; instead, itâs for research. But despite the fact that you cannot go here to borrow a book, why not visit the site for a trip down Seinfeld memory lane? Youâll find the library near the 5th Avenue subway station.\n\nHarlem Filming Locations Search\n\nOur last scene takes place in New York but was actually filmed in California. Mountain View Mortuary & Cemetery is a cemetery where a lot of stories await the history buff. After all, itâs been open since 1882! Historic gravesites are yours for the finding.\n\nItâs also where Georgeâs fiance is laid to rest after she dies. Remember, George did attempt a few breakups with Susan, to no avail. But after licking envelopes in the process of sealing wedding invitations (George bought the cheapest invitations available) for her and Georgeâs upcoming nuptials, toxic envelopes are Susanâs end.\n\nSusan is alone in this Seinfeld scene, licking the envelopes until she passes out. George returns to his apartment and takes Susan to the hospital but she dies despite his efforts. But George is secretly relieved by the chain of events. He asks the doctor, âLet me ask you. Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue?â\n\nYouâll see in the Seinfeld scene at the cemetery, George really does not have remorse, but he does show relief!\n\nHead to Mountain View Mortuary & Cemetery in Altadena via the Fair Oaks, Mountain View or Fair Oaks, Woodbury bus stops, where Susan was buried in âThe Invitationsâ episode. While there, you can pay your respects to George Reeves, TVâs original Superman.\n\nAltadena Filming Locations Exploration"
