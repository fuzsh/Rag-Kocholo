        "text": "Does Jerry Seinfeld‚Äôs Bee Movie live up to the buzz that he and NBC have been generating for what seems like months? This Queen Bee decided to leave the hive and take my little bees to their first premiere to see just how sweet Bee Movie really was?\n\nFresh out of college, Barry Benson (Seinfeld) has the whole world in front of him, or at least a single job making honey in his hive. But unlike his best buddy Adam Flyman (Matthew Broderick), Barry is unwilling to settle for a life of honey production. When Barry sets out on an adventure to discover the rest of the world, he meets Mooseblood (Chris Rock), a mosquito heading to Alaska, and ends up befriending a human. Vanessa Bloome (Renee Zellweger), a New York florist, becomes an unlikely companion sharing her passion for nature with Barry. Together the pair must rescue the world‚Äôs flowers.\n\nThe Bee Movie brings life in the hive alive. Who knew a bee‚Äôs life could be so much like a human‚Äôs ‚Äî cars, parents, school, jobs? üòâ The movie starts with Barry leaving the hive for the first time on what is literally a high flying adventuring. The animation during the opening sequence is so great you get a bee‚Äôs-eye view soaring through the air with Barry and the Pollen Jocks (What can I say? Every society has its class structure.)\n\nMy two-year-old twins were especially delighted during this first third of the movie. I heard little cries of ‚Äúweeeee‚Äù from my son as he stalled with a handful of popcorn midway to his mouth to watch Barry‚Äôs adventure in the big city.\n\nMy daughter was just as mesmerized as she peeked through her fingers covering her eyes exclaiming during on of Barry‚Äôs less majestic moments of flight ‚ÄúMommy, he fall. No Look.‚Äù (translated: Mommy, he‚Äôs going to fall. I can‚Äôt look.)\n\nThings slow down a bit during the middle of the movie as Barry sets his plan to change the world in motion. This portion of the movie is filled with an array of star cameos and one-liners that resulted in laughs disproportionally from the adults (don‚Äôt worry; nothing inappropriate for the kids).\n\nAt this point the twins each moved to a parent‚Äôs lap and concentrated on their twizzlers. Although not nearly as captivated as in the beginning of the movie, to my delight, my little ones were still buzzing with interest. It takes a lot to keep a toddler‚Äôs interest for 90 minutes.\n\nAfter Barry learns the consequences of his success at changing the world, the story gains momentum as Barry and Vanessa set out to save the day with a little help from his friends (the advantage of living in a hive ‚Äî lots of friends).\n\nAs a big fan of the Disney animation, I‚Äôm used to being hit over the head with the morale lesson. But I‚Äôm not sure what the lesson was from this film. My two guesses ‚Äî be careful what you wish for or take care of the environment.\n\nEither way, I did learn one new fact about bees that I didn‚Äôt know ‚Äî they can‚Äôt fly in the rain.\n\nOverall, a good tale, nicely done. For me, Patrick Warburton, the only other Seinfeld alum (Putty) in the movie stole the show as the narcissistic Ken, Vanessa‚Äôs boyfriend who is edged out of her life by Barry. And although his screen time is minimal, Chris Rock was hilarious as the blood-sucking Mooseblood.\n\nI have to admit that I‚Äôm not a huge Jerry Seinfeld fan. If I hadn‚Äôt been given free tickets, I probably would not have gone to see this movie and that would‚Äôve been a shame. I highly recommend the movie especially if you have little ones. This movie will definitely be added to our collection when it comes out on DVD.\n\nThe twins‚Äô verdict? Two thumbs up."
