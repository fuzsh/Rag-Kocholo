        "text": "No celebrity in the history of movie press junkets was more excited to discuss his latest project than Jerry Seinfeld.\n\nThe 53-year-old comic literally jumped to his feet to greet a visitor to his Westwood hotel suite on a recent Sunday morning. With a smile that stretched from ear to ear, he extended his hand in friendship and then offered something from the mini bar.\n\n“I can’t tell you how great it is to finally be showing my movie to people,” he enthused without prompting. I’m very excited.”\n\nFor a veteran stand-up comic accustomed to instant gratification from live audiences, the wait for reaction to his work on the animated “Bee Movie” has seemed an eternity.\n\nIn real time, it’s been four years since a fateful dinner with director Steven Spielberg at a Long Island, N.Y., restaurant, in which a throwaway line from Seinfeld about a funny title for a movie led to a big-budget DreamWorks Animation film. Co-written by Seinfeld, the film tells the story of a bee named Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld’s voice) who sues the human race after discovering that humans have been stealing and selling honey without the knowledge and permission of the insects that make it. It’s funnier than it sounds.\n\n“Bee Movie,” which opens Friday, is the latest and most ambitious venture undertaken by Seinfeld since his iconic TV series “Seinfeld” went off the air in 1998 after nine seasons.\n\nSince then, he performed his stand-up act for the last time, created a new stand-up act from scratch, starred in a documentary about creating his new act, got married and had three children.\n\nORANGE COUNTY REGISTER: I interviewed you before the TV series started, and what I admired most about you at that time was that you seem satisfied with just being a top stand-up comic. There seemed to be no show business ambition beyond that. What happened to that guy?\n\nJERRY SEINFELD(Nodding his head in agreement): I know. I know.\n\nOCR: Did ambition rear its ugly head?\n\nSEINFELD:I was very happy with my life back then. But I don’t think it was ambition that happened, as much as it was that they let me do my own thing on TV. I would never have entered that world unless I had control.\n\nOCR: Your show was named the greatest television show ever by TV Guide. Please explain how you are able to keep your head inside your skull?\n\nSEINFELD (laughing and slapping his knee): That’s a great, great question. I guess I can explain it this way. You know that feeling when someone gives you a compliment, like “Have you lost weight?” In that moment, you get this wonderful feeling inside. And then it passes. Later on that night, you feel like a miserable wretch again.\n\nOCR: So, you’re saying that this poll comes out, which is the biggest ego boost of all time, and then it passes?\n\nSEINFELD (chuckling): Barry, long ago I learned to sidestep the so-called ego-boost. Garry Marshall (the TV producer and film director) once said a great line about fame in show business. He said: “It’s perfume; you smell it, but you don’t drink it.”\n\nOCR: What are you trying to say?\n\nSEINFELD:I enjoy the lovely floral scent, but I don’t take it to heart.\n\nOCR: Come on, Jerry. They’re saying that your show was better than Lucy, Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore. That’s got to mean something?\n\nSEINFELD:The only thing that I will admit to you in public is that it is not a bad thing. That’s as far as I’ll go.\n\nOCR: You never let ego get in the way?\n\nSEINFELD:I have to say that I never put my ego or personal feelings on the line. It’s only about the quality of my work. If they don’t like it, then they don’t like my work. I never think that they don’t like me. I try not to take anything personally.\n\nOCR: I have always wanted to ask you and Larry David (the co-creator of the “Seinfeld” series) if there ever was a Paul McCartney-John Lennon-type rivalry between you?\n\nSEINFELD:No. Never.\n\nOCR: It never bothered you if he got credit for a classic bit on the show that was really your idea?\n\nSEINFELD:Barry, Barry, Barry. That is the secret of my success. If I had had any of those kinds of insecurities, would I have hired a cast (Michael Richards, Jason Alexander and Julia-Louis Dreyfuss) that could run rings around me? It was good for the show, and every decision was made on that basis.\n\nOCR: No insecurities at all?\n\nSEINFELD:I’m sorry for not being more insecure. I know it would make a better story. We need to spend more time together so you can get to know me a little better.\n\nOCR: Will you admit to being proud of what you accomplished on that show?\n\nSEINFELD:I am very proud, and it’s nice to hear you say these things because I don’t really think about it very much. I guess it’s a sad fact of human nature. I don’t get up in the morning and think: “Boy, I really did something good there.” I think about breakfast.\n\nOCR: OK, I understand. But our little successes in life aren’t repeated twice a night in syndication.\n\nSEINFELD (laughing): This is true.\n\nOCR: And now you’re in the movie business.\n\nSEINFELD:At least it’s not a romantic comedy. I know my limits.\n\nOCR: But you didn’t know anything about the world of animation, either. What did Jeffrey Katzenberg (DreamWorks honcho) have to teach you about making an animated movie?\n\nSEINFELD:Everything. I didn’t know anything. I didn’t understand how these movies were made.\n\nOCR: And what might be possible in animation?\n\nSEINFELD:What is possible, and what is impossible.\n\nOCR: Was anything impossible?\n\nSEINFELD:I don’t think I ever heard that phrase. What he’d say is that “this could be done, or that can be done, but we can’t do both. You have to choose one.”\n\nOCR: Explain.\n\nSEINFELD:Anything is possible, but everything is impossible. It gets down to going down the menu and ordering. You can have anything on the menu, but you can’t have everything on the menu.\n\nOCR: This film touches upon the importance of bees to the circle of life. Did you intend from the beginning to be topical, or is that something that came out later as you researched bees?\n\nSEINFELD:If you’re referring to how bees function in nature, I don’t consider that topical. That’s just fact. But the whole colony collapse disorder is something that came out later.\n\nOCR: Is the appreciation of bees the point of the movie?\n\nSEINFELD:The point of the movie originally was just to be funny. Then it kind of took on a life of its own. We looked at what the world would be like if the bees didn’t do this seemingly meaningless job. That is the other real theme of this movie – there are no meaningless jobs. Everything makes a difference to someone or something.\n\nOCR: Is the movie everything you imagined after that dinner with Spielberg?\n\nSEINFELD:Actually, it’s a little bit more.\n\nOCR: Was it such a great experience that you might quit doing stand-up?\n\nSEINFELD:Never.\n\nOCR: Why not? Don’t you ever get bored?\n\nSEINFELD:No. Stand-up is a little like surfing in that it’s the same thing, but the waves are always different. For me, the audiences are always different. There’s a different energy every night. It’s an energy that’s bigger and stronger than you, and you have to play with it.\n\nOCR: So, it’s about control?\n\nSEINFELD:It’s all about control.\n\nOCR: Is that why you became a stand-up?\n\nSEINFELD: No, I became a stand-up because I didn’t want to work at a real job, and because Bill Cosby wore sneakers. I wanted a job where I could wear sneakers all the time."
