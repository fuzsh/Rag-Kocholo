In spite of his spindly insect legs and two-toned apian stripe-suit, Barry B. Benson — the movie’s leading bee —is essentially another analogue for Seinfeld’s real-life personality. Rather than evolving Seinfeld’s funny features into something that steps wide from his familiar comedy persona, Barry’s job throughout this flick is to stand in as only a lightly fictionalized yellow-and-black version of Seinfeld himself./p pIt takes mere minutes into emBee Movie/em’s goofy but well-paced plot for viewers to realize that voicing a cartoon character doesn’t hand Seinfeld some kind of no-holds-barred license to cut loose from his signature entertainment traits. Seinfeld delivers every word of Barry’s dialogue in the same voice you’d expect him to use if he were playing a weekend stand-up stint in an arena somewhere near you. Fortunately, though, that’s no bad thing. Just as Seinfeld did on, well, emSeinfeld/em, Barry serves as the stable, regular-guy nucleus amid a supporting constellation of actors whose crazier qualities are free to bounce all over the place./p h2Sweet as honey: The emBee Movie/em story cast/h2 div data-embed-button=\"media\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embed\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"[]\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"aa8a8cca-6df8-4967-ba17-74bce76e4a85\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity\"div class=\"media__image\" style=\"max-width:862px\" div class=\"media__image-wrapper\" div div img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"low\" src=\"https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/scale_862/public/2024/03/screenshot_2024-03-04_at_11.29.28_am.jpg\" width=\"862\" height=\"575\" alt=\"Adam Flayman (Matthew Broderick) and Barry B.

Heck, since we’ve already droned on about courts and juries at this point, it’s probably worth pointing out emBee Movie/em’s main story beat here: In a horrifying, emMatrix/em-like moment of discovery, Barry learns that humans imprison bees in hives (unlike his happy, free-growing colony near Central Park) — and, worse still, that they co-opt his kindred a data-entity-href=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/honeybees-live-half-as-long-as-they-used-to\" data-entity-title=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/honeybees-live-half-as-long-as-they-used-to\" href=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/honeybees-live-half-as-long-as-they-used-to\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"bees/a’ hard work by stealing their honey and converting its many uses into cold, hard human cash./p pRather than follow his family’s wishes and committing to a lifelong bee career within the hive, Barry decides he just can’t abide humanity’s cold appropriation of bee-kind’s industrious labor, and files a civil suit that aims to keep people’s hands off his species’ prized product for good.That, in turn, leads to its own cascading cavalcade of unintended bad consequences. But the real delight in watching Barry’s plans crash and burn is the time it affords his almost-romantic relationship with Vanessa Bloome — an aspiring florist (and actual human) voiced by Renée Zellweger — to blossom into something kind of sweet./p pIn a movie populated by talking a data-entity-href=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/topic/insects\" data-entity-title=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/topic/insects\" href=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/topic/insects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"insects/a, it should probably seem odd that one of the ho-hum humans runs away with the voice acting show. But Zellweger singlehandedly gives emBee Movie/em a heart, even amid the peculiar Seinfeld brand of comedy that already was infamous for keeping real feelings at arm’s length. As Vanessa, she deftly navigates a family-friendly obstacle course of vast emotional range, a feat that Seinfeld and the rest of the movie’s writing team perhaps instinctively intuited that Zellweger was uniquely equipped to achieve./p pThat’s by no means a dig at the rest of emBee Movie/em’s eclectic (but excellent) voice acting cast, which features some genuinely hilarious cameo turns from Sting, Oprah Winfrey, producer Barry Levinson, and the late Larry King and a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/ray-liotta-instagram-tribute-to-late-cocaine-bear-actor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"Ray Liotta/a. In addition to Rock, Zellweger, Goodman, and Seinfeld, the broader emBee Movie/em casting list reads like a who’s-who yearbook page filled with Seinfeld's 1990s comedy friends./p pThere’s tons of fun to be found in figuring out (with no peeking!) where stars like Megan Mullally, Michael Richards, John DiMaggio, and even Matthew Broderick appear in the film. Though to be fair, there’s absolutely no mystery to emSeinfeld/em veteran Patrick Warburton’s role as Vanessa’s bumbling human boyfriend Ken; he sounds exactly like emSeinfeld/em’s David Puddy (and like Warburton's character Kronk in emThe Emperor’s New Groove/em, if we’re being totally honest.)/p pSome contemporary emSeinfeld/em TV fans came away from emBee Movie/em’s theatrical run slightly disappointed that it didn’t swing for more distant and ambitious comedic fences, that it actually was nothing more or less than a sweet, appropriately funny, and totally family-friendly entry in DreamWorks’ expanding animated feature-film catalog. But more than 25 years on from its release, emBee Movie/em’s charms are perhaps a bit easier to see. It looks as terrific as any animated movie that’s being made today, it tells a simple and relatable story, and it serves as an outlying oddity of Seinfeld’s entertainment output that —when you really step back and take Barry B. Benson at face value —maybe isn’t such a drastic Seinfeld outlier after all./p pemstrongBuzz over to Peacock now to catch Bee Movie,streaming a href=\"https://www.peacocktv.com/watch-online/movies/bee-movie/26272f7a-3578-3bf0-ac0a-8638f74b4f22\"here/a./strong/em/p"
