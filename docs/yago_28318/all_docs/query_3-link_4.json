        "text": "Animation fans have had their antennae tuned to \"Bee Movie\" for months, primed by a stream of teaser trailers, commercials and NBC promotional skits.\n\nNow the question can be answered. Does \"Bee Movie\" fly?\n\nYou bet, and it's not just flapping its wings. This DreamWorks Animation offering is one of the most visually exciting animated movies in years. It's understandable that Jerry Seinfeld wanted to give this project a big buzz. In addition to voicing the main character, Barry B. Benson, Seinfeld co-wrote the screenplay and co-produced the movie.\n\n\"Bee Movie\" has that \"Seinfeld\" flavor. It's not about nothing. It's about a lot of somethings, including destiny, workers' rights and cross-species cooperation. But it shares the same wry outlook and witty sense of humor.\n\nAnd, there's no mistaking Seinfeld's voice and attitudes in Barry, a disillusioned worker bee who isn't sure he wants to work.\n\nThere are other ways in which \"Seinfeld\" pollinated \"Bee Movie.\" The sitcom's writer/producers Spike Feresten and Andy Robin are co-writers, along with Barry Marder. \"Seinfeld\" actors Patrick Warburton and Larry Miller are among the cast.\n\n\"Bee Movie\" introduces us to Barry B. Benson, a young bee about to choose his first job at Honex Industries. But first, Barry grabs a chance to fly outside the hive with a squadron of pollen-gathering bees.\n\nIn a mind-blowing action sequence, he gets separated from the group and tangles with a tennis ball, kites and cars. Vanessa Blume (Renee Zellweger), an aspiring florist, saves him from being squished by her shoe-wielding boyfriend (Patrick Warburton).\n\nAs Barry explores the human world with Vanessa, he's appalled to learn that some bees are enslaved just to make honey for humans. Barry has found his calling -- to stop the exploitation of bees everywhere.\n\nBarry's actions have some unintended consequences that, although not biologically accurate, serve as a nice ending to this funny and magical movie. The visuals are half the fun; cotton-candy colors and whimsical machines fill Barry's hive.\n\n\"Bee Movie\" proves that an animated movie can entertain kids and adults without a lot of gratuitous pop-culture references and wink-wink clutter. Seinfeld was smart to keep the story tight and not spin it out longer than it should go.\n\nZellweger has a charming voice for Vanessa. Warburton, a veteran voice actor, is just as good here as you would expect him to be.\n\nListen for Chris Rock as Mooseblood the Mosquito, Megan Mullally as the Honex Tour Guide and Oprah Winfrey as Judge Bumbleden.\n\nHere's the final buzz: \"Bee Movie\" deserves to be queen bee at the box office.\n\nTo reach this Plain Dealer reporter:\n\njwashington@plaind.com, 216-999-4539"
