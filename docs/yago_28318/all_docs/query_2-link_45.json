        "text": "In 2007, Jerry Seinfeld made a blatant attack on humanity when he released Bee Movie. Some say he was high. Some say he was horny. Some say he was creating commentary on corporate society and capitalist propaganda, while shedding light on the potential effects of environmental issues involving the imbalance of nature. Whatever the truth is, this movie should not exist, and yet it does. Years later, the internet was overrun with memes about the film that changed the brain chemistry of a generation. In 2018, Brayden Martino and the folks at See Humans brought this story to the stage, satirically unpacking meme culture, bad movies, and Gen Z humor. The show was uploaded to YouTube in 2020 where it developed a cult following. Years later, a known cult at Boston Conservatory revived the production illegally.\n\nIn 2023, students from Boston Conservatory sought to revive the Bee Movie Musical. Against the school's wishes, they put on the show secretly in an underground studio late at night. The students involved were suspected of \"cult activity\" due to strange rehearsal rituals and marketing stunts. This is the footage they don't want you to see."
