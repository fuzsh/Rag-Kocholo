        "text": "Hear a snippet of Jerry Seinfeld's interview with Michigan journalists.\n\nSee the movie trailer\n\nRead the story belowTo bee or not to bee?\n\nJerry Seinfeld likes the buzz he's getting from high-profile animated film\n\nNOVI -- How does Seinfeld top \"Seinfeld\"?\n\nThe answer, direct from Jerry Seinfeld's mouth, is that he doesn't try to match the success of the TV show that ran for nine seasons, was heralded by some as the best sitcom ever and made him a gazillionaire.\n\nBut the question is inevitable, especially as Seinfeld tours the country promoting the animated feature film \"Bee Movie,\" which opens Friday. Co-written and produced by the comedian -- who also supplies its lead voice -- it is his highest-profile project in the nine years since he shut down \"Seinfeld\" while it was at the top of the ratings.\n\n\"By doing something like this, there's no attempt to match or top it. It's just doing something different,\" Seinfeld said of the long shadow left by the sitcom during a recent media chat at a theater in this Detroit suburb.\n\n\"(With) any artist, that's your responsibility, to create new things for the public, to entertain people and to divert their attention,\" he continued. \"So that's what they pay (me) for, to let (people) forget about (their lives) for a hour and a half. And the best way to do that is to make something new ... to step into a new world and try and bring the audience with me.\"\n\nFor someone of his stature in show business, Seinfeld, 53, has led a fairly low profile since \"Seinfeld\" ended. He's gotten married and fathered three children. He's toured the country enjoying his first love of stand-up comedy (he brought his act to The Whiting in Flint in 2003). He oversaw the \"Seinfeld\" DVD releases, guested periodically on TV and hosted the most recent Academy Awards.\n\nSeinfeld even made a movie, the 2002 documentary \"Comedian,\" in which he contemplated the direction of his career. But that was five years ago, and Seinfeld has spent most of that time in hands-on mode with \"Bee Movie,\" his first behind-the-scenes stab at animation. In the weeks before its release, he traveled the country promoting the film at stops such as the one in Novi, where he signed autographs for fans and amiably answered media queries.\n\n\"I don't think there's anything in this world that comes out well without someone really putting some effort into it,\" he said of the film. \"People say to me, 'Four years, that must have been awful, that was so long.' Well, the time was going to go by anyway, whether I made the movie or not.\n\n\"For the past three years, I (worked) almost all day, every day (on 'Bee Movie'). I was Involved with design, animation, directing, casting, recording. ... It was different because with the (TV) show: You don't have animation, you have live people, and someone's got to rehearse with those actors, someone's got to write those scripts, someone's gotta edit these scenes, someone's got to rewrite the stuff that didn't work.\n\n\"Showbiz is hard,\" he added. \"You put a lot of time into it. But the thing is, it's fun and you're making fun things. It's a toy department, so it's not so bad.\"\n\nIn the satirical but family-friendly \"Bee Movie,\" Seinfeld voices Berry B. Benson, a young bee whose personality isn't terribly unlike Jerry Seinfeld's. Barry wants out of an inevitable future making honey for the world's biggest corporate honey producer.\n\nHis quest to stray from the hive leads to his meeting a human, a Manhattan florist (voiced by Renee Zellweger), whom he befriends by breaking one of the cardinal rules of beedom -- he talks to her.\n\nSeinfeld admits to liking the fact that he's seen on screen as a bee, and not as himself, which is how viewers usually have seen him.\n\n\"It makes me more comfortable that I'm a bee,\" he said. \"If this were like a regular movie, with me just trying to be Jack Handsome, or some date movie where a girl walks into a pole with a miniskirt and everyone thinks that's funny ... I kinda did that. Romantic comedy is something I think I did (in 'Seinfeld').\"\n\nThe directors of \"Bee Movie,\" Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner, lauded Seinfeld's teamwork.\n\n\"He gradually got into the fact that there's a slight difference between Barry and Jerry,\" Smith said during a separate interview. \"It's 90 percent Jerry ... but there's a 10 percent difference in the scenes. It was great: He'd realize, 'Oh, this is what Barry should be doing,' and he started investing in Barry, and that was fantastic for us.\"\n\n\"Jerry is a real softie; he really is, although he won't tell you that,\" said Hickner. \"He's super-collaborative and very gracious.\"\n\nThe inspiration for the film came from an extemporaneous remark made by Seinfeld while he was having dinner with director Steven Spielberg. To fill a lull in their conversation, Seinfeld blurted out an idea about something called \"Bee Movie,\" a reference to the term for low-budget movies from Hollywood's golden days.\n\nSpielberg loved the title and paired Seinfeld with his partner at DreamWorks, Jeffrey Katzenberg. The plot -- and the casting -- emerged from that. Seinfeld's good friend Matthew Broderick signed on to voice Barry's sidekick. Pals Chris Rock and Larry Miller, as well as Kathy Bates, John Goodman, Megan Mullally and \"Seinfeld\" semi-regular Patrick Warburton, also are heard.\n\n\"I really just want people to have a good time and put a smile on their faces,\" Seinfeld said of his goals for \"Bee Movie.\" \"I don't ever have the ambition to break people's hearts or make them see the world in a totally different way. I just want them to go in and ... just have a good time.\"\n\nJust don't expect to see another animated film from him. Seinfeld likely will find another direction to take.\n\n\"I've never planned anything in my career,\" he said. \"The only thing I know is that I will continue to be a stand-up comedian; that is my real job. And, hopefully, the next thing I'll do will be as different from this as this was from other things, and that people will enjoy it.\""
