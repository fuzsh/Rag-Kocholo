        "text": "Seinfeld\n\nLarry loses quality time with Cheryl, who invited him over to review the reunion script, when he tries to return a favour and ends up fighting with a local coffee vendor.\n\nThe Reunion\n\nLarry is dead set against filming a `Seinfeld' reunion and is about to tell Jeff and NBC that he won't do it when he bumps into Cheryl. She tells him she's just got back into acting and encourages him to write a part for her. Realising that this might win Cheryl back, Larry convinces Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Michael Richards to come together for the reunion show.\n\nOfficer Krupke\n\nJeff's carelessness forces Larry to embrace his feminine side, Cheryl has yet more competition for her role in `Seinfeld', and Larry meets a police officer with an unusual name.\n\nThe Bare Midriff\n\nLarry is forced to talk to his and Jerry's assistant Maureen about her belly dancing clothes but his ham-fisted attempt offends her and she leaves the job. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who got Maureen the job, demands that Larry apologise so that the incident doesn't upset Maureen's mentally unstable mum. Meanwhile, Larry's mishap in Maureen's bathroom causes a misunderstanding about a weeping Jesus statue."
