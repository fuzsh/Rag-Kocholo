        "text": "The Bee Movie is about Barry the bee (Jerry Seinfeld) is a recent college graduate with what some might call high ideals. He is fed up with humans taking all the honey he and the other bees work so tirelessly to produce.\n\nHe finds Vanessa (Renée Zellweger), a human who understands him and believes in his mission, and together they sue the human race for taking advantage of bees. The presiding judge (Oprah Winfrey) declares victory for the bees.\n\n“The moral of the story — one of them, anyway — is that we and the bees are interdependent and that we should respect their hard work. This lesson is satirically driven home in a courtroom plot that erupts just as the love story starts to get sticky. When Barry discovers that honey is sold in supermarkets and that it is harvested from captive bees held in smoky, shoddy fake hives, he sues the human race, going after some of its notorious bee abusers. These include Ray Liotta, who sells his own brand of honey, and Sting, whose name is obviously offensive to bees. (Both celebrities make cameo voice appearances, as does Larry King, playing a character called Bee Larry King. It’s funnier than it sounds. Or maybe it’s exactly as funny as it sounds.).” – A. O. Scott. New York Times. A Drone No More: No Hive for Him! 2 Nov 2007"
