        "text": "For his place in entertainment history as the co-creator and star of TV Guide's \"#1 Greatest TV Show of all time,\" \"Seinfeld\" (NBC, 1989-98), Jerry Seinfeld's real life path seemed as simple and effortless as the sitcom that was supposedly \"about nothing.\" He became a successful stand-up comic, parlayed that into a sitcom based on his life as a successful stand-up comic, and after nine years on TV returned to being a successful standup comic. Without a doubt, Seinfeld was the definitive observational comedian, naturally funny and obsessively hard-working, but the oft-overlooked secret to his success was his singularity of focus. He knew what he did best - irreverent, observational humor about the everyday minutiae of modern life - and he became the best at it."
