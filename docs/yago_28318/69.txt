First, there was Fusilli Jerry. Now, there’s cartoon Jerry.

Jerry Seinfeld is trying out his animated side in a DreamWorks production called “Bee Movie,” due out in November 2007. In it, he is the voice of a bee who leaves the hive and discovers that humans have been stealing the insects’ honey.

The move co-stars Renee Zellweger, who is the voice of Vanessa, a New York City florist.

“I think I’m bringing a different humorous sensibility to an animated movie,” Seinfeld, who also is writing and producing the movie, told Newsweek magazine. “There’s a lot of attitude in the jokes, the same way it was on the show.”

The comedian, who starred in the NBC sitcom “Seinfeld,” still does standup and has three children under age 6. He said his home life provides him with tons of new material.

“There’s no way to even describe the gold mine in the comedic arts that family life is,” he told Newsweek. “I can’t believe I missed it for so long. If my life was total misery — which it’s not, it’s heaven, I love my wife, I’m having a great time — but if it was total misery, it would still be worth it for the jokes.”
