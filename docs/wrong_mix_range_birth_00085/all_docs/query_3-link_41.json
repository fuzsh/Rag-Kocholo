        "text": "He was the fourth of nine children of Johann Georg and Anna Regina Kant, German philosopher Immanuel Kant was born in Konigsberg, East Prussia in 1724. Son of a humble saddler, his family belonged to a Protestant religious group of Pietists ,religion was a very improtant part in every aspect of their lives. Even though Kant was critical of formal religion, he still admired the conduct of Pietists. Kant’s went to elementary school at Saint George’s Hospital School and then went to the Collegium Fredericianum, a Pietist school, where he studied from 1732 until 1740. There he gained a deep appreciation for the classics of Latin literature, especially the poet Lucretius. In 1740 entered the University of Konigsberg as a student of theology and was a student of Martin Knutzen, who introduced him to the rationalist philosophy of Leibniz and Wolff, and he likewise imbibed interest in natural science, in particular the mechanical Newton. His spent his life almost entirely in his hometown; he did not go more than a hundred miles only when he lived for several months in Arnsdorf as preceptor. Living in that city he worked as a private tutor to earn a living after the death of his father in 1746. When he was thirty-one years old he received his doctorate at the University of Konigsberg, then he started teaching. In 1770 after failing twice in trying to get chance to give a lecture and have rejected offers from other universities, he finally was appointed ordinary professor of logic and metaphysics. He taught at the university and remained there for 15 years, beginning his lectures on the sciences and mathematics, however over time he covered most branches of philosophy. The life he led has gone down in history as a paradigm of methodi... ... middle of paper ... ...feet tall and extremely thin, and his health was fragile. Toward the end of his life he became increasingly antisocial and bitter over the growing loss of his memory and capacity for work. Kant became totally blind and finally died on February 12, 1804, Kant died in his hometown, He was honored with a big funeral. By then the philosophy of Kant had reached widespread acceptance in the mainstream and cultural circles of Germany and a considerable echo in the rest of Europe.
