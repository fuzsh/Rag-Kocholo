His kingdom’s security was based on religious toleration and on the functional integration of Brahmans, Marathas, and Prabhus.\n\nEarly life and exploits\n\nShivaji was descended from a line of prominent nobles. India at the time of his birth, in 1630, was under Muslim rule: the Mughals in the north and the Muslim sultans of Bijapur and Golconda in the south. All three ruled by right of conquest, with no pretense that they had any obligations toward those who they ruled. Shivaji, whose ancestral estates were situated in the Deccan, in the realm of the Bijapur sultans, found the Muslim oppression and religious persecution of the Hindus so intolerable that, by the time he was 16, he convinced himself that he was the divinely appointed instrument of the cause of Hindu freedom—a conviction that was to sustain him throughout his life.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nCollecting a band of followers, he began about 1655 to seize the weaker Bijapur outposts. In the process, he destroyed a few of his influential coreligionists, who had aligned themselves with the sultans. All the same, his daring and military skill, combined with his sternness toward the oppressors of the Hindus, won him much admiration. His depredations grew increasingly audacious, and he overcame the minor expeditions sent against him.\n\nChallenging the Mughals\n\nWhen the sultan of Bijapur in 1659 sent an army of 20,000 under Afzal Khan to defeat him, Shivaji, pretending to be intimidated, enticed the force deep into difficult mountain terrain and then killed Afzal Khan at a meeting to which he had lured him by submissive appeals. Meanwhile, handpicked troops that had been previously positioned swooped down on the unwary Bijapur army and routed it. Overnight, Shivaji had become a formidable warlord, possessing the horses, the guns, and the ammunition of the Bijapur army.\n\nAlarmed by Shivaji’s rising strength, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb ordered his viceroy of the south to march against him. Shivaji countered by carrying out a daring midnight raid right within the viceroy’s encampment. The viceroy lost the fingers of one hand and his son was killed, which prompted him to withdraw his force. Shivaji, as though to provoke the Mughals further, sacked the rich coastal town of Surat.\n\nAurangzeb could hardly ignore such a challenge and sent out his most prominent general, Mirza Raja Jai Singh, at the head of a vast army, said to number some 100,000 men. Shivaji was compelled to sue for peace and to agree that he and his son would attend Aurangzeb’s court at Agra in order to be formally accepted as Mughal vassals. In Agra, hundreds of miles from their homeland, Shivaji and his son were placed under house arrest, where they lived under the threat of execution.\n\nEscape from Agra\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

On August 17, 1666, he and his son had themselves carried past their guards in these baskets. His escape, possibly the most thrilling episode in a life filled with high drama, was to change the course of Indian history.\n\nShivaji’s followers welcomed him back as their leader, and within two years he not only had won back all the lost territory but had expanded his domain. He collected tribute from Mughal regions and plundered their rich cities; he reorganized the army and instituted reforms for the welfare of his subjects. Taking a lesson from the Portuguese and English traders who had already gained toeholds in India, Shivaji also began building a naval force; he was the first Indian ruler of his time to use his sea power for trade as well as for defense.\n\nAlmost as though prodded by Shivaji’s meteoric rise, Aurangzeb intensified his persecution of Hindus: he imposed a poll tax on them, condoned forcible conversions, and demolished temples, erecting mosques in their places.\n\nIndependent sovereign\n\nIn the summer of 1674, Shivaji had himself enthroned with great fanfare as an independent sovereign. His coronation marked the formal beginning of the Maratha empire. The suppressed Hindu majority rallied to him as their leader. He ruled his domain for six years, through a cabinet of eight ministers. A devout Hindu who prided himself as the protector of his religion, he broke tradition by commanding that two of his relatives, who had been forcibly converted to Islam, should be taken back into the Hindu fold. Even though both Christians and Muslims often imposed their creeds on the populace by force, he respected the beliefs and protected the places of worship of both communities. Many Muslims were in his service. After his coronation, his most noteworthy campaign was in the south, during which he forged an alliance with the sultans and, by doing so, prevented the Mughals from spreading their rule over the entire subcontinent.\n\nShivaji had several wives and two sons. His last years were shadowed by the apostasy of his elder son, who, at one stage, defected to the Mughals and was brought back only with the utmost difficulty. The strain of guarding his kingdom from its enemies in the face of bitter domestic strife and discord among his ministers hastened his end. The man that British politician and author Thomas Babington Macaulay called “the Great Shivaji” died after an illness in April 1680, in the mountain stronghold of Raigad, which he had made his capital.\n\nShivaji breathed new life into a people that for centuries had resigned itself to serfdom and led them against Aurangzeb, a powerful Mughal ruler. Above all, he was one of the few rulers of his time who practiced true religious tolerance.\n\nRanjit Ramchandra Desai The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
