        "text": "Transcript\n\nImmanuel Kant\n\nWhy is Immanuel Kant important? Immanuel Kant was a German philosopher of the Enlightenment whose comprehensive work in ethics, in aesthetics, and in the theory of knowledge greatly influenced all subsequent philosophy, especially the schools of Kantianism and idealism. What was Immanuel Kant’s childhood like? Kant’s father was a saddler, and his mother was remarkable for her natural intelligence. Both were devoted Pietists, and the influence of their pastor made it possible for Kant to obtain an education. What did Immanuel Kant do for a living? After working as a family tutor for 9 years, Kant spent 15 years as a lecturer at the University of Königsberg, where he was later appointed to the chair of logic and metaphysics. What did Kant write? Kant’s most famous work, Critique of Pure Reason, was published in 1781 and revised in 1787. His other books included Critique of Practical Reason (1788) and Critique of Judgment (1790)."
