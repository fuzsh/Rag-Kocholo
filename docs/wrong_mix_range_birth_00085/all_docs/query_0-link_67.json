        "text": "We will inform you here about frequently asked questions on the examinations of the Goethe-Institut.\n\nWe will inform you here about frequently asked questions on the examinations of the Goethe-Institut.\n\nIf you have additional questions concerning the Goethe certificates A1 through C2, please arrange an informational, free-of-charge personal consultation at one of our testing locations (Goethe-Instituts, Goethe Centers or Goethe Examinations partners).\n\nFrequently asked questions on the examinations of the Goethe Institut\n\nThe exams of the Goethe-Institut are available to anyone interested, regardless of the exam candidate’s citizenship. They are designed to demonstrate knowledge in German as a second language and/or as a foreign language.\n\nWe do recommend a minimum age for taking the exams.\n\nExam Guidelines (PDF, 337 KB)\n\nThe testing locations make every effort to accommodate participants with special needs (such as chronic illnesses, visual or hearing impairment). The level and type of chronic illness/disability must be disclosed upon registering for the exam and be confirmed by a doctor’s attestation. The testing location is obligated to maintain strict confidentiality.\n\nMore detailed information can be obtained directly at the testing location at which you wish to take the exam.\n\nYou may leave the room for a reasonable time (bathroom). This absence will be noted in the “Report on the Administration of the Exam”.\n\nThe Goethe-Zertifikats A1 through C2 correspond to the ‘Common European Framework of References for Languages (GER)’. You can check the classification under:\n\nCommon European Framework of References for Languages (GER)\n\nAcknowledgements stating participation in a language course, an evaluation test, an exam, etc., are not sufficient.\n\nOnly an exam certificate of having passed a Goethe exam (A1 through C2, Kleines or Großes Sprachdiplom, respectively) are recognized as proof of the respective knowledge level in German as a Second Language.\n\nGoethe-Zertifikat C2: Großes Deutsches Sprachdiplom, Zentrale Oberstufenprüfung (ZOP), Kleines Deutsches Sprachdiplom (KDS) and Großes Deutsches Sprachdiplom (GDS) are recognized for study at a college/university in Germany, and exempt one from taking the TestDaF exam or any similar exam.\n\nTo find out more about the language requirement of a specific university and/or a course or field of study in Germany, request information directly from the university, or visit www.sprachnachweis.de.\n\nBinding for the scoring of the written part of all Goethe exams is the orthography introduced in August 2006. The basics are „DUDEN. Die deutsche Rechtschreibung“ (as of the 24th edition, 2006) and „WAHRIG. Die deutsche Rechtschreibung“ (editions as of 2006).\n\nThe currently effective rules can be found at:\n\nLearning is an individual process. How much time you need to attain a certain level depends on various and individual factors: your commitment, your time input, and your taking advantage of additional practice resources.\n\nShould you already have studied one or more languages, you may learn German faster. It makes a big difference if you participate in a language course in your home country or in Germany, where you will be exposed to the German language outside the classroom.\n\nAlso of relevance is the intensity of the instruction (intensive vs. evening courses, for example). Please consult the testing location of your choice and request a personal consultation.\n\nFor each exam level you will find “practice and info materials“ by downloading materials\n\nfree of charge\n\nby additionally ordering materials.\n\nYou also may receive materials from the language department of the Goethe-Institut nearest you.\n\nSome exams offer distance learning material and online courses.\n\nLearning German by correspondence course\n\nThe exam as a whole can be re-taken as often as needed. Details on re-taking the exam or part of the exam can be found under Terms and conditions for exam administration.\n\nThe exam Goethe-Zertifikat A1: Fit in Deutsch 1 is deemed to have been passed if at least 30 points (50% of the maximum point score) have been earned and if all sections of the exam have been completed.\n\nThe exam Goethe-Zertifikat A1: Start Deutsch 1 is deemed to have been passed if at least 60 points (60 % of the maximum point score) have been earned and if all sections of the exam have been completed.\n\nThe exam Goethe-Zertifikat A2 or Goethe-Zertifikat A2: Fit in Deutsch is deemed to have been passed when at least 60 points (60 % of the maximum point score) have been earned and if all sections of the exam have been complet-ed. Of these points, at least 45 points must have been earned in the written exam and at least 15 points in the oral exam. Otherwise, the entire exam will be deemed to have been failed.\n\nThe Goethe certificates B1, B2, C1 and C2 are modular exams.\n\nA module is deemed to have been passed if at least 60 points or 60% are attained.\n\nGoethe-Zertifikats A1 through C2 do not expire.\n\nMany institutions and employers, however, expect the certificate to be dated not more than two years ago.\n\nThe certificates of the Zentrale Oberstufenprüfung (ZOP), das Kleine Deutsche Sprachdiplom (KDS) und das Große Deutsche Sprachdiplom (GDS) will be valid after the introduction of the new Goethe-Zertifikat C2: Großes Deutsches Sprachdiplom and with the change of the the exam offers on the level C2 beginning 01.01.2012.\n\nNo duplicate will be issued.\n\nIf the exam was taken within the last ten years, the testing location where you took the exam will issue a substitute document for a small fee.\n\nIn the case of a name change (for example due to marriage, adoption, divorce, etc.), neither a new certificate nor a substitute document will be issued.\n\nA change of name can be verified either with an official document from the relevant authority (birth certificate, marriage license, etc.) or a notarized copy of the above.\n\nName/ spelling of name must be documented via photo ID during registration at the testing location. The certificate for the exam will be issued based on this previously recorded personal information.\n\nAn official translation can be prepared by a state-recognized translator or translation office.\n\nThe participation for the exam requires neither prior attendance at a specific language school or in a prep course nor the acquisition of a lower level certificate.\n\nHowever, we recommend participation in a prep course at the testing location. There you will learn the necessary linguistic and exam-specific skills that will help you succeed on the exam.\n\nFor more information, please contact the testing location of your choice and request a personal consultation.\n\nIf you took your exam at a Goethe-Institut and have not received any other information, you can view your exam results at Mein Goethe.de.\n\nHelp with registration on My Goethe.de:\n\n© Goethe-Institut\n\n​​​​​​​\n\nHelp with retrieving exam results:\n\n© Goethe-Institut\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact your Goethe-Institut directly.\n\nIf you took your exam with an examination partner working with the Goethe-Institut, please contact your examination centre directly.\n\nYou may have your certificate notarized – for example, for the purpose of studying in Germany – by any valid notary public (court, government office, school, bank, etc.). Employers usually require a notarization from a law firm."
