        "text": "Why Russia can’t have Kant?\n\n02.05.2024\n\nIn Königsberg (renamed by the Soviet Union as Kaliningrad after the annexation of the city in 1945), where philosopher Immanuel Kant was born, Russian authorities were celebrating his 300th birthday by updating the museum and hosting a philosophy congress. The region’s governor, Anton Alikhanov, called Kant a “Russian trophy” in his speech.\n\n“Kant is like a trophy for us Russians, along with everything else here in Kaliningrad. We need to appreciate what we’ve inherited,”\n\nhe said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences hosted the main event, succeeding the Prussian Academy where Kant was admitted in 1786. During his speech, the German Chancellor barred President Putin from mentioning Kant, stating Putin had no right to do so. Scholz accused the Putin regime of attempting to appropriate the philosopher and his works.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Russia has tried to claim the cultural achievements of other nations and foreign property as its own, as part of its imperial narrative. Some other claims include claims regarding returning Alaska to Russia.\n\nNo historical connection to Russia\n\nThe simple answer is that Immanuel Kant and his work are not connected with Russia in any way. Kant lived and worked in Königsberg, Eastern Prussia, between 1724 and 1804, and his main language of work was German and Latin, although he mastered many other languages, including Hebrew, French, and English.\n\nKant’s entire academic career was spent at the University of Königsberg, known as the Albertina. He famously never ventured beyond the city limits.\n\nAs a result of World War II, Russia annexed the city of Königsberg from Prussia and renamed it Kaliningrad, therefore the establishment was named Kaliningrad State University (1946–2005), and the German population that remained was either expelled or faced dire consequences.\n\nIn 2005, during the celebrations of the 750th anniversary of the founding of Königsberg, President Vladimir Putin of Russia and German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, announced that the university would be renamed Immanuel Kant Russian State University in honour of Immanuel Kant. From a Russian perspective, renaming the university after Immanuel Kant aligns with efforts to emphasize the region’s Russian identity and historical ties. The university is also interested in the historical connections between Königsberg and Russia.\n\nWords matter\n\nRussia’s interest in claiming the legacy of Immanuel Kant and the Albertina could stem from the absence of globally renowned figures linked to its oldest university, established in St. Petersburg in 1724. Throughout its active years from 1544 to 1945, the Albertina featured notable personalities like Franz Liszt. By associating Kant’s name with the university, Russia could be leveraging his reputation as the “father of modern ethics” to bolster its own image as a morally principled nation, even in the face of accusations of committing serious war crimes.\n\nThe Kaliningrad governor, Anton Alikhanov, referred to Kant as a “Russian trophy.” This statement could have significant implications rather than being purely accidental. It might symbolize the Russian military’s prowess in “liberating” Königsberg from the Nazis in 1945 and subsequently annexing the territory, thus claiming ownership of its legacy as a war trophy.\n\nThe Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact’s secret protocol designated Königsberg as part of the German sphere of influence, indicating that the Soviet Union did not initially plan to annex the territory. Consequently, this circumstance adds weight to the notion of Kant’s legacy being viewed as another war trophy.\n\nKant’s intellectual legacy originates from his life and work in Königsberg, yet his name is now used by Russia in political and symbolic contexts divorced from his true historical significance. The renaming of the university in Kaliningrad exemplifies attempts to redefine identity and heritage by leveraging figures like Kant. However, these actions spark debate and criticism, especially from those who stress Kant’s authentic ties to his birthplace and academic milieu.\n\nScreenshots from the internet pages mentioned in the text were used as illustrations."
